1362054,5,B00004W46H,"Chris and Jane are superb in every way. The plot is a little off-the-wall, but just too cute...a modern-day man projects himself several decades into the past, where he meets, romances and falls deeply in love with an actress. By some event he is sent back to his own time. What will become of his love in the past? Will he ever find her Somewhere in Time? Watch the movie and find out. I highly recommend...it will appeal to your inner 'Marshmallow' self.",1001635200,2,456,4.506024096385542
1362055,4,B00004W46H,"There is more to ""Time"" than I could absorb in one watching. The love story is simple enough, but the many-sided nuances of the story are hidden in almost every corner of the movie, and they don't reveal themselves to lazy or superficial examination. Trying to burden oneself with the minutia of time-travel theory simply complicates the story for the first viewing, or two. However, the nuances of the two lover's interplay across time is important to the story from the very beginning, as I found out.
I missed many of the facets of the story the first time through and I can see why so many have an almost a cultist fascination with ""Time."" A captivating movie that, like a good book, challenges you to pay attention and then rewards you with the type of ending that really makes you wish there was a sequel, or two, waiting in the wings.",999561600,4,841,4.5394736842105265
1362056,4,B00004W46H,"After reading several reviews for ""Somewhere in Time"", the one issue that jumps out at me as causing confussion amoung viewers is the matter concerning ""time travel"". As any fan of Sci-Fi knows, time travel is a very risky venture at best. Such events as meeting yourself, accidently causing the death of a relative, and altering the time-stream (as depicted in the original STAR TREK episode ""City on the Edge of Forever"") are just a few of the many pitfalls encountered. The sequence of time is also a major consideration. To quote perhaps the most famous time traveler of all (Dr. Who, of course!), ""Have I been here before... or am I yet to come?"". In this movie, none of this really applies. For in ""Somewhere in Time"", time travel... in the ""classic"" sense... is not the main event. This is NOT sci-fi, but a LOVE story that TRANSENDS time! Yes,there is one time ""loop"" here... starting when the ""old"" Elise gives Richard the watch. But the sequence of events should be taken just as presented in the movie, from both characters points of view. This is why Richard has no prior recollection of past events, even though the ""old"" Elise knows all. Only several years later, at the Grand Hotel, does he start to sence an affinity to the portrait of the ""young"" Elise, which causes him to realize that the old woman with the watch and the young woman in the portrait are one and the same. Thus begins his ""quest"" of love. In the final scene, he does what ""Sam"" does in the movie ""Ghost""... reuniting with loved ones that have preceded him to ""the other side"". It's as simple as that, and this is a great way to prevent repeating (that dreaded time-loop thingy)any events of the past. So don't try to over-think this flick... snuggle up with that ""special someone"", keep plenty of tissues on hand... and enjoy one of the GREAT movies of out times!",998956800,3,1848,4.586102719033232
1362057,5,B00004W46H,"It has been 21 years and still refreshing. I saw it in the big screen cinema that time, and loved this movie immediately. I just watched its VHS version, and the feeling is still so great for this movie. Although I have never thought a picture of the person in the past can be so impressive and attractive for someone to attempt traveling back in time to be with the person. Until last November, I went to a grave to pay salute to a Hong Kong movie classic star, Betty Loh Tih, who died in the age of 30 during the 60s. Her stunning classic beauty picture just like in this movie attracted me so greatly, and I finally convinced that what was made in that movie is so realistic. A great photography can make one falling in love with the person in the past. This movie is made to be the classic of its time, when 80s the romance story seldom hit the line, it was a stand out of its kind. Beautifully casted, scenes, music and the entire mode of the movie just made everything looked so romantic. I was not a Christopher Reeve or Jane Seymour fans before I watched this movie, but since I saw them and the made to believe in love looked, I started to like them ever since. It is a well deserved to collect a beautiful piece of a movie, than can stand through time. It is an ever lasting love story!",998870400,3,1296,4.188
1362058,5,B00004W46H,"I saw PART of this movie (from the famous ""Is it you?"" scene) on 'Dinner & A Movie.' I got REALLY mad when someone walked in front of the tv. I drove an hour away from my house the next day to buy a movie... that I had only seen half of. If that doesn't tell you that this movie is PERFECT I don't know what does.  I really love Jane Seymours acting, and I get tears EVERY TIME I watch this film. I obsesses easily yes, but, never ever so quickly, and never ever so truly. The movie was and still is a complete materpiece. Reeve's acting was incredible, though I did find the time traveling thing a little overdone. Definately a great buy and a timeless romantic movie.",980121600,5,669,4.1461538461538465

1362060,5,B00004W46H,"This is one of the best movies Christopher Reeve ever did.  It tells the story of a man in love, out of his own time.  He learns of an experimental psychological method of travelling through time (which is a stretch at best) and goes in search of his one true love.  The time travel element is the only thing that makes this movie scifi.  It is a love story.  Jane Seymour is spectacular as an early 20th century actress.  Christopher Plummer is a wonderful antagonist and protector of the young Seymour.  The characters in this movie are so well established that you cannot help but find yourself agonizing with them through their adventures and mishaps.  I'm trying not to give anything away to those of you who haven't seen it.  Hopefully, I've sparked your interest.  You wouldn't be disappointed with this one.",974419200,3,815,4.676056338028169
1362061,5,B00004W46H,"SOMEWHERE IN TIME IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME.  IT IS A PERFECT BLEND OF ULTRA ROMANTIC STORY LINE, LOCATION, CAST, AND DIRECTION.  I COULD WATCH THIS MOVIE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND NEVER GET TIRED OF IT  (AND USE AT LEAST 1/2 BOX OF TISSUES EACH TIME).  REEVE AND SEYMOUR WERE  COLLIER AND MCKENNA AND PLUMMER WAS SUPERB AS MCKENNA'S OVERPROTECTIVE  GUARDIAN.  THE LOCATION WAS PERFECT AND THE MOVIE AS A WHOLE REALLY MADE ME  WISH I COULD GO BACK IN TIME TO EXPERIENCE SUCH SERENE BEAUTY.  IT ALSO HAD  JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF COMIC RELIEF.  I MUST ALSO MENTION THAT I LOVED  THE MOVIE SO MUCH THAT I NAMED MY DAUGHTER AFTER SEYMOUR'S CHARACTER,  ALTHOUGH I SPELLED IT DIFFERENTLY, MY DAUGHTER'S NAME IS MAKENNA AND IF I  HAVE ANOTHER GIRL, HER NAME WILL BE ELISE...I'VE EVEN CONSIDERED COLLIER  FOR A BOY.  I ALSO HAD MY HAIR STYLED LIKE SEYMOUR'S CHARACTER'S FOR MY  WEDDING DAY AND I WOULD LOVE TO SPEND AN ANNIVERSARY AT THE GRAND HOTEL ON  MACKINAK ISLAND, MICHIGAN.  I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU GO OUT AND BUY A BOX OF  TISSUES,  GET THIS MOVIE, CURL UP ON THE COUCH AND ENJOY.",966902400,9,1096,4.434343434343434
1362062,4,B00004W46H,"It may not be one of the best films ever made, but I love it anyway.  The scenery and costumes are beautiful...not to mention the beautiful Jane  Seymour & Christopher Reeve. But what's fascinating about the movie is  element of time travel. It's not that Richard (Christopher Reeves) falls in  love with the woman in the picture (Jane Seymour); rather, the picture  stirs a remembrance within him. Not realizing what it is at first, Richard  seeks answers through research which eventually leads him to the belief  that...he was there. Thus the obsession with time travel and the quest to  return.
Watch for the details and the glimpses of things in the present  and see the connection when he's in the past. For instance, watch his  relationship with Arthur.
There are all kinds of details that I  appreciate about the movie. Notice the view from Miss McKenna's room at the  beginning of the movie and compare that with the view from Mr. Collier's  room at the end. Notice the use of camera angle, lighting and furniture  (namely the fabric) to transition Richard from the present to the  past.
Probably the most disappointing thing about the movie is the  ending. But as a hopeless romantic, it's none-the-less a favorite movie.",966384000,6,1231,4.846153846153846
1362063,5,B00004W46H,"Somewhere in Time is one of the most poignant and unforgettable  stories ever.  Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour tear your heart out - and put it  back together.  The setting, Mackinac Island, transports you back in time  and provides a remarkable, drop-dead gorgeous backdrop for a well-written,  well-directed love story.  You will love to hate the ending but you will  always love the movie.",966124800,,396,5.078125
1362064,5,B00004W46H,"For many this film takes the notion of ""soul mates"" and pushes it to extremes. We've all experienced at one time or another a ""first love"". It usually happens in our adolescence, this special relationship may last only weeks and sometimes years, but inevitably, it fades for a variety of reasons, though years can pass, and the thought of them returns when we least expect it - a conversation, a stranger at a restaurant or a song on the radio, all these things can spark their memory. What if there was a way to actually return to that time and see them again as they were...? What if a total stranger approaches you and gives you something, a memento, and asks you to come back to them? Only later you discover a photo of that person and feel with all your heart that you know them. You've never actually met them before, but you just `know' that you've met them somewhere, and you would do anything to see them again.

Somewhere in Time is a fantasy that takes this notion of ""lost loves' and turns it into reality. Our protagonist meets his soul mate and becomes so obsessed with seeing her again, that he actually transverses time and space in order to accomplish this. He succeeds, but there's always a catch. This is a sentimental tale that makes no apologies for being so, it is what it is, and maybe that's why it has retained its appeal for so many people over so many years.

The late Christopher Reeves does a fantastic job as the besotted time traveller - a naive, bumbling writer in love with a woman who existed before he was born. He delivers a wonderful performance at that moment when he finally goes back in time. His reaction is nothing less than perfect. When he sees his lost love for the first time at the hotel, the romantic soundtrack flowing in the background, the majority of us set our cynicism aside, and feel the protagonist's excitement and awe... I suppose that is one of the keys to watching this sentimental film, suspending our propensity for cynicism, our world-weariness, and relating to these people whose love for each other knows no bounds.

Chris Reeves will always be remembered as Superman, but for me, this performance as the besotted time traveller in search of his lost love, will always stand out as one of his greatest performances.",1100304000,4,2280,4.583333333333333
1362065,5,B00004W46H,"I've just finished watching the movie as part of a TV Valentine's Day Movie Weekend. It certainly belongs with a group of love and romance movies,and the touch of science fiction won me right away.
Did you ever lay in your bed and hope, and dream, that if you really concentrated, you could travel to Mars? I used to do it frequently when I was a teenager, and I guess I never concentrated enough, because I never quite made it to the Red Planet.
Well here Christopher Reeve tries and then tries again, to go back to 1912 to be with the every-lovely Jane Seymour, a noted actress from that period. Somehow he succeeds. Bravo on behalf of all romantics and science fiction fans out there!
Her manager tries to quench the hot and growing romance between these two,but he not only has to compete with their desire, but with the stately historic hotel in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, and all its trappings. Kind of like the Chicago Cubs trying to get to a World Series.
Anyway, see the movie, buy it and cherish it. Today when I saw it I started to think about poor Christopher Reeve, now paralyzed from an accident. I pray that he can overcome that affliction, just like he overcame decades of time to be with the woman he loved.

1362066,4,B00004W46H,"Yes, it is a chick flick.  Most guys would rather have a root canal with no anesthetic than sit through a chick flick.  Yes, the time-travel plot gimmick leaves the plot with gaping holes that would be appalling to any science fiction fan.  Yes, the soundtrack can be enough to make you swear off Rachmaninoff for life.  All this is true.
Strangely enough though, it is an enjoyable movie if used sparingly, like maybe once every two or three years.  It is a lot like some sugary confection; very enjoyable in and of itself, but if you eat it at every meal day after day, nothing good can come from it.
Ladies, follow those instructions and you can probably get the man in your life to submit to the occasional viewing.  Men, this movie will not kill you if approached with the proper caution.  If you feel you are in danger of overdosing, just watch a ""Lethal Weapon"" movie and you should be rehabilitated.",1065139200,,907,4.4939024390243905
1362067,4,B00004W46H,"This touching romantic classic is well done. The acting by Christopher Reeve, Jane Seymour, and Christopher Plummer (as the interfering manager W.F. Robinson) is superb. The musical score by composer John Barry is wonderful and also includes Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody. It has often been the musical choice of figure skaters for their skating programs and is actually where I first heard the music.
Richard Collier (Reeve) is a playwright who lives in Chicago in 1980. One day, out of the blue, he receives the gift of a watch from an elderly woman who says, ""Come back to me"". He becomes haunted by this experience and becomes attracted to a picture in the hotel of a famous actress, Elise McKenna (Seymour). Through research he realizes that she is the same woman who gave him the watch and also that she died on the same day. He then begins his struggle, through hypnosis, to make it back to 1912 to renew his acquaintance with Elise.
The movie is slow paced, but has some very touching moments. I love the scene of their first meeting when Elise says, ""Is it you?"" It contains a minimal amount of swearing (religious in nature)and also the ending love scene, although tastefully done, may cause it to be inappropriate for children under 12. I personally prefer the Hallmark movie, The Love Letter, which has a similar theme but is more appropriate for all ages.
It is not surprising that this movie has become a cult classic, with fans meeting every October at the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island, Michigan, where the story takes place and was filmed. It was also filmed in Chicago.
The special edition also includes an interesting featurette from 2000 about the making of the film and interviews with the actors. Christopher Reeve shares an experience from his own life that is very similar to what happens to his character in the film.  It must be noted that this featurette on the video is an edited version of the one on the DVD which is at least 15 min. longer.",1044057600,37,1966,4.698550724637681
1362068,5,B00004W46H,"i discovered this movie as a junior in highschool in 1984.  from the very first moment i saw it, it has been #1 on my list of favorites.  the impact of a love so very strong, that it transcends time, is a love that most of us (women) dream of.  guys (including male reviewers) call it gushy, and corny.  that's to be understood, for no man understands whats truely in a womans heart.  why?  because they don't want to deal with the stuff that's close to us, that they lable ""corny and gushy"".  is it any wonder men will never understand.  guy's, if you want a completely romantic evening with your lady love, get this one and watch it with her.  then, run out and buy her the soundtrack for a present.  and keep plenty of hankies at the ready.  **********  I give it 10 stars!",1039996800,3,776,4.239726027397261
1362069,4,B00004W46H,"This is a love story with a scientifical twist. I did not expect to like this movie but I did. Notice that the time travel relation is a loophole. The old lady tells him to go back to her so he travel back in time and do so but in order for that to happen he must been there previously otherwise she would never met him, in other words there is no beginning nor end to the timeloop, also the watch that she gives him was given to her by him which in turn was given to him by her and so on going in circles forever.

The story is based on a novel by Richard Matheson.  The story entails a romantic and intimate relationship between a young Christopher Reeves, (Richard Collier) and Jane Seymour (Elise McKenna).
The story begins with the opening of Richard Collier's first play during his college years.  At the end of the play an aging woman approaches him and gives him an old-fashioned pocket watch and says, ""Come back to me,"" before leaving.  The story moves forward eight years at which time Collier is a successful playwright.  After he becomes frustrated because he can no longer concentrate on his work, he leaves his office and decides to check into the Grand Hotel.  While he is a guest at the Grand Hotel a photo of the beautiful Elise McKenna who had stayed in the hotel in 1912 mesmerizes him.  He cannot get the photo out of his mind and tries to find out as much about her as he can.  He discovers she is the woman that gave him the watch eight years earlier.  He uses hypnosis and convinces himself to travel back in time to 1912 where he meets Elise McKenna, the woman in the picture from the Grand Hotel.  Elise's possessive manager, William Robinson, is determined to put an end to their relationship.  Her manager is very possessive of her and does not want Richard to be with her.  After Elise's manager has a scuffle to deter Richard from seeing Elise, the manager loses the power he had over her.  Richard and Elise spend an intimate afternoon together which ends suddenly when Elise tells Richard she is going to buy him a new suit.  Richard proceeds to explain to Elise all the advantages of the suite he has, pointing out all the pockets and how handy they are for his coins, at which time he pulls a shiny penny from the future.  Since the penny was not of that era, it caused Richard to go back to the future and he loses Elise.  Richard tried hypnosis again to try and get back to Elise, but it fails.  Richard is heart-broken and spends the next several days in his hotel room alone without any food or sleep.  Eventually he dies and in the final scene Richard is shown with Elise grasping hands in the clouds.
This film was very slow moving.  It is a romantic story, but the romance drags until the end of the film.
It seemed like it took forever for this film to finally end.
