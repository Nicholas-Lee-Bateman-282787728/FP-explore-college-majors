The shows are all in color and are the 60's alive again. Yes the black and white shows are great too. If you want the black and white shows look to columbia house, but don't pass these by.",984614400,,342,3.9
7914825,5,B00001U0EA,"I am 16 years old and I love the tv show My Favorite Martian.  I record it everyday on TV LAND.  My Favorite Martian is one of those tv shows that you could watch a million times and never get sick of watching it.  There was the characters and the actors that made this show unique.  Ray Walston as the Martian, Bill Bixby as Tim O' Hara, Pamela Britton as Mrs. Lorelei Brown, and later on Alan Hewitt as Detective Bill Brennen.
Sadly most of these actors are no longer with us the only one out of those four that is still here to entertain us is Ray Walston.
During all of these actors lifetime they entertained us so much.  These actors brought these characters to life.  It looked like they had so much fun in what they were doing.  The way they acted made you think that Tim, and Mrs. Brown, and Martin, and Detective Brennen were real people.
I would definitely recommend this show to anybody it is such a loveable show and if you watched it once you will remain a fan forever.
