8140660,5,B000HOMSS6,"His Holiness Rangjung Rikpe Dorje, the sixteenth Gyalwang Karmapa, supreme head of the Karna Kagyu lineage of Tibetan Buddhism performed the Vajra Crown ceremony publicly in Burlington, VT during the late 1970s. I was one who attended this extraordinary Empowerment. This film captures the essence of His Holiness' stunning presence.",1342828800,,333,5.68
8140661,3,B000HOMSS6,"Those studying the 16th Karmapa will find the documentary footage in this 1985 US film of some interest.  If you don't know your karma from your Karmapa, better to look elsewhere for an introduction to Tibetan Buddhism.

Director Mark Elliot sketches in 50 minutes the bare outlines of Buddhism, 20th century Tibetan history, and the life of the 16th Karmapa.  He includes footage from the mid-60's, when the 16th Karmapa's disciples, the ones that would play a central role in the dispute over the 17th reincarnation, were fresh faced children.  There is also film of the 16th Karmapa's visit to the United States in 1974 and his 1982 funeral and cremation at his spiritual home, Rumtek Monastery, Sikkim.  Unfortunately, there is no interview with the Karmapa himself and none of the footage includes the Karmapa's voice, except where he can be overheard talking to American children in a blessing procession.

The script does not question the assumptions, practices or institutions of Tibetan Buddhism, and claims of miracles and supernatural phenomenon are presented at face value, suggesting the film was produced by and for the faithful.

There's not much here to sink your teeth into.  Even students of Tibetan Buddhism will find little of substance beyond the visuals.

8140662,5,B000HOMSS6,"In addition to getting a sense of the flavor and presence of the wonderful Karmapa, there are cameos of Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, Situ Rinpoche, Osel Tendzin, Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche, and Kalu Rinpoche.  Especially now that many of these men have died, this provides an invaluable way for people to get to know them.",1201219200,5,317,4.981132075471698

8140665,5,B000HOMSS6,"This is a beautifully composed film with some amazing footage of many revered Tibetan lamas. As I had read Mick Brown's excellent book 'The Dance of 17 Lives' just before watching this film, it was particularly rewarding to actually see the story of the 16th Karmapa on screen and have the whole story brought to life in this way. Even though the film focuses on Karmapa, I also very much enjoyed seeing the footage on Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Ch&ouml;gyam Trungpa Rinpoche and Kalu Rinpoche. A rare treat, and a highly recommended film.",1168300800,38,537,4.8478260869565215
