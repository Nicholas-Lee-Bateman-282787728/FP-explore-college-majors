644434,1,6303336981,"Ok- listen..I realize there are people out there who. on the strength of a director's name or past accomplishments, will laud any and every attempt at 'ART'. The other reviews of this barking French Dog of an Art film are fawning in the extreme. This is the worst film I've seen in years. Rare is the film that that is so bad that you collapse in tears of laughter. It's quite as if an elementary school film class got hold of good equipment, managed to slip the entire cast prozac and ex-lax and then proceeded to film all the characters from the neck down. There are stunning shots of horses legs, men's legs, chain mail butts and the occasional shot of a horses eye. This had some significance to someone- but was laughable as anything other than a skewed attempt at symbolism. The battle scenes were the best of the bad- the red paint spewed out of the fake neck of an armored mannequin was hand pumped- and yes..the fake dime store plastic arrow glued to the head of the obviously frightened and probably sedated horse almost killed me with laughter. Every film student should buy this DVD and watch in over and over and take extensive notes on HOW NOT TO MAKE AN ART FILM. Jeez- I'm sorry..but the most remarkable thing about this film is that ANYONE actually spent money making it. This ART film makes Plan 9 From Outer Space look like Shakespeare.",1105488000,17,1355,4.512195121951219
644435,5,6303336981,"Bresson once more offers us his particular gaze about the Legend of The King Arthur and the Holly grial.
The script is a journey to explore without restrictions a bitter sight to the decline , the decadence and the loss of the epic sense of the life , majesty and the deep hole of uncertainity and dissapointment around the values that once were .
The tale is always permeated of a dark poetry . The images don't reflect the state of the honor . You only watch the loyalty from a perverse angle.
Watch for instance the glorious and countless sequences in which we never see the horses' faces . Bresson employed that smart device in previous films like Joan of Arc , for instance , in which we never see the faces of the executioners or A man escapes where the nazi officers faces are always hidden in a clever mix of blame and betray .
The film is loaded with countless poetic images and a clear resources economy. Bresson is concerned more in what we must imagine that in what we can see. He introduces us in a mythical journey , but at last with the fall of the last warrior and the unforgettable and awful sequence of the iron skeletons make useless any word , and the  powerful images talk by themselves.
Bresson employs the words in the its exact meaning ; he  avoids long speechs ; he goes to the images , whose expresiveness go far beyond any kind of language.
With the glorious exception of Andrei Tarkovsky no other film maker has employed so wisely the visual language to express with such deepness and beauty the powerful of his message.
The meaning value of the genius is that he's like anyone , but anyone is like him.",1087862400,15,1631,4.397350993377484
644436,4,6303336981,"The Arthurian Legend is the most interesting and powerful blend of Christian virtue and Medieval valor in literature. In Bressons hands, however, the search for the Holy Grail does not inspire acts of virtue or valor. In fact the search proves to be quite demoralising and leads to a lot of infighting. Once faith is lost so is unity and all that is left is a grab for power. Arthur is barely a character, he simply is the one who is slightly older and has slightly shorter hair and wears a crown. Lancelot is a kind of Hamlet who can't decide what he stands for. He loves Guinevere but he wants to do what is right for the kingdom as well. Ultimately he does the right thing and returns her to the king but too late--the favoritism shown him by both Queen and King has turned him into a target to the other Knights. Mordred is his most powerful detractor and the more Lancelot wavers the stronger and more resolute he becomes. In subverting the Arthurian legend or secularising it Bresson has turned the story into a Shakespearean tragedy about loyalty and betrayal. He's turned a story which dealt in absolutes (or at least in a search for absolutes)where people are defined by actions which can be deemed good or bad into a story which deals only in relative truths where all acts are marked with uncertainty and doubt. He's turned an old story into a new one.",1043712000,15,1363,4.5
644437,5,6303336981,"The story of Lancelot is one of loyalty, and who better to agonizingly dissect such a concept than Robert Bresson? His film is an investigation of the conceits of ""unifying poetic myth,"" and none of the values allegedly transmitted through shared tradition emerge without the taint of flawed humanity. As always, Bresson darkens and reduces: Arthur is an anti-figure, Camelot is stark and roughhewn (though it is never dwelt upon, his vision of the round table, and the chairs around the table, are to my mind as stunning a bit of set design as you will ever find), nowhere does magic or myth pervade the storyline. The camera moves with guilty severity, Guenivere is near comatose, a voice of (t?)reason frozen in rigid profile. There is no ""spectacle"" (the famous jousting sequence is consciously anti-spectacular, but still a riveting use of camera and sound), the sumptuous beauty of the film comes from Bresson's compositions of human figures, stark lighting, and muddy green-brown colors. Lancelot du Lac is a magnificent, beautiful movie, a perfect setting and story for Bresson's signature touches. Those looking for a swashbuckling Arthurian epic will be disappointed; those looking for a rigorous but rewarding investigation of conscience, fate, and tradition will be deeply rewarded.
  The film begins with the information that ""The Grail has not been found"" and ends with a single word and image that implode a whole universe of myth.",954979200,15,1446,5.148936170212766
7846750,5,6303336981,"Lancelot du Lac (1974) was Robert Bresson's 11th feature film and only his third in color. Though it came out to almost universal critical acclaim, it is now one of his most under-appreciated works which people rarely make reference to when talking or writing about the director. Still, at least we can still see the film properly courtesy of this excellent Artificial Eye release. That's more than can be said of his stunning first feature Les Anges du Pchs (1943) and his first two color films, Une femme douce (1969) and Quatre nuits d'un rveur (1971). All three are in desperate need of being released on DVD - does anyone know why they now seem to be available only on YouTube? At any rate, Lancelot du Lac is for me a masterpiece. It completely achieves what it sets out to do and although it is icy cold when set beside acknowledged masterworks like Pickpocket (1959) and Au hasard Balthazar (1966), its intellectual rigor is equally as impressive and the total effect is as profound as you are ever likely to get in the cinema.

At first glance Arthurian legend as related by the 12th century French poet Chrtien de Troyes may seem an unlikely choice of material for Bresson. His films are usually routed in contemporary France even if the literary sources (Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Diderot, Bernanos) are not. To date his only period film had been Le Procs de Jeanne d'Arc (1962), and that had been firmly based on historical fact even down to utilizing the transcript from the victim's trial as the screenplay. Nobody expected the austere iconoclastic French director to veer into Camelot (1967) territory. And yet look closely and we see that Lancelot du Lac is as Bressonian as any of his preceding films.

Put basically, Bresson's concern was always with the basic metaphysics underpinning the human condition - the reasons we live, the factors that propel human life from birth to death and beyond. As I have outlined in my other Bresson reviews his aesthetic is informed by Catholicism, in his case the peculiar French strain of predestinarian Jansenism. In a Bresson film protagonists function in any given narrative to fulfill whatever has been predestined for them to fulfill. They have no free will of their own and usually the film charts a journey which becomes in effect an unknowing search for spiritual redemption, for grace. Conventional character psychology has no place in a Bresson work - it doesn't matter what happens between life and death, the result will be the same - such is the nature of predestination. Throughout the protagonists will be `acted on' from on high as they are guided towards their fate.

In all of Bresson's b/w films up until Mouchette (1967), grace is always found. The protagonists may suffer greatly, but through good means or foul they always achieve a state of redemption. From Une femme douce onwards however, though the characters are acted on from on high and are still fulfilling their already decided destiny, grace is withdrawn and the protagonists finish in a kind of nihilistic abyss. It is as if Bresson withdraws any hope he ever had for the improvement of mankind as he demonstrates with a ruthless intellectual rigor how man has created his own fall. This is precisely what Lancelot du Lac is all about.

The narrative structure of the film is split into three clearly identifiable acts. The first sees the knights of the round table return to Camelot from Brittany where they have been searching for the Holy Grail. Their search has been fruitless and they return in disarray, 70 of the 100 knights having died in the process. The most senior knight is Lancelot (Luc Simon) who returns to the arms of Queen Guinevere (Laura Duke Condominas). At first he attempts to stop their affair. It is conflicting with his knightly code of honor consisting of his loyalty to Guinevere's husband King Arthur (Vladimir Antolek-Oresek). However, he is persuaded by the Queen to continue. The `affair' is observed from afar by the other knights who split according to their allegiances. Gawain (Humbert Balsan) and his followers take the side of Lancelot while Mordred (Patrick Bernhard) and his legion take up the King's honor. Act Two consists entirely of a jousting competition between rival knights in which Lancelot says he will participate, but which he actually uses as a diversion to have a tryst with the Queen. One knight dominates the contest. Gawain thinks it is Lancelot after all, but nobody is quite sure. Act Three charts the final split between the knights and how King Arthur, Lancelot and his supporters are ambushed by Mordred's archers in the forest. The film ends with all the knights slaughtered, piled on each other in their armor to resemble a trash heap.

Bresson lays his cards on the table right at the beginning of the film with his depiction of the knights in disarray. They wreak havoc on innocent people as churches are ransacked and homes are destroyed. For knights searching for the Holy Grail, their behavior is distinctly un-Christian. They show no brotherly love of man for fellow man and as the first part of the film continues Bresson depicts the knights as an aloof sect, living apart in their lofty castles not concerned at all with the subjects they are supposed to be looking after. There is a brief sequence towards the end of the first part where Lancelot advances towards a crucifix which is blurred just off-center of frame as he addresses it: ""Lord, do not forsake us. Do not forsake me. I struggle against a death worse than death. Deliver me from a temptation I can hardly resist"". But it is not a question of the Lord abandoning him and the other knights. Actually it is they who have abandoned the Lord. By treating the Holy Grail as a prize to be won in some knightly show of strength, by showing loyalty only to themselves and to their own senses of pride, and (in Lancelot's case) by knowingly committing adultery with the Queen of the land so that the land itself dies, the knights turn their backs on God and any values that can be called `Christian'. In this way, they engineer their own final demise.

Rather than Christian values, it is the chivalric code of knightly honor which the knights rigorously adhere to. Bresson demonstrates this code to be empty and meaningless. This is the point of the central jousting competition. Why are these knights attempting to knock each other off their horses with sticks? What is the relevance of this to anything other than a massaging of pride and an attempt to alleviate the boredom of an irrelevant life in a forest? Bresson underlines the pointlessness of it all by his unique way of shooting the sequence, the camera pointing at horses' bodies and parts of the contestants' armor as one by one they bight the dust. We never see who is fighting who, the armor preserving their anonymity and indeed throughout the film Bresson clearly highlights the clunking and the clanking of the armor as the knights strut around Camelot ridiculously still wearing it even when they don't have to. The armor becomes a badge of their irreligious anti-Christian moral code which has complete irrelevance to anyone except themselves. Note the final slaughter where Bresson has the knights one by one pull down their visors before riding into their destruction. They are not people so much as articulators of a corrupt bad code of misplaced honor which is fully worthy of destruction. Thus the final image of the suits of armor piled on top of each other to resemble a trash heap is Bresson's indignant and entirely logical response to a sad and sorry state of existence.

Now, you may say what does all this have to do with the human condition especially in the 20th century? Well, the Arthurian legend is a myth and like all myths, it conveys universal truisms which remain constant down through the ages. The search for the Holy Grail is acknowledged as a metaphor for the search for redemption, a search for true faith which we spend our lives pursuing. It is of course especially relevant for Catholics as the grail was the cup held by Joseph of Arimathea which supposedly captured the blood of Jesus Christ as he lay dying on the cross. The cup was later adopted by Catholics for the Holy Communion celebration of the Eucharist. This of course stays relevant to this day. In Lancelot du Lac Bresson is very careful to demonstrate the way the knights violate the 7 Catholic virtues (chastity, temperance, charity, diligence, patience, kindness and humility) in favor of the 7 deadly sins (lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy and pride) in the way they go about their business and the story of their demise conveys in microcosm the very same impurities which undermine the human condition to this day. In Au hasard Balthazar and Mouchette Bresson has his main characters negotiate the 7 Stations of the Cross in their life journey which relate the very same impurities. Those films were contemporary and are more obviously relevant, but just because Lancelot du Lac is set in an ancient pre-historical era, it doesn't make the central truisms spelt out in the myth any less so. In fact the film is every bit as Bressonian in theme as the rest of his work.

Visually of course, the film is unmistakably 100% Bresson. He employs a new cinematographer in Pasqualino De Santis, but one would never know it. The mise-en-scne remains typically grey, dreary and determinedly unspectacular despite its color presentation. Where battles, the joust and the trysts between Lancelot and Guinevere could have provided for some rip-roaring violent rumpy-pumpy  la Excalibur (1981, John Boorman), Bresson predictably stylizes the violence which is anything but realistic, ignores the crowds of the jousting contest (heard not seen), employs his usual amateur models to `act' expressionless throughout, and points his camera at spaces into which characters move to underline the predetermined fate they are moving towards, focusing on body parts and equipment instead of adhering to the customary Hollywood full-spectacle approach. In this way Bresson forces us to focus on the ideas underlying the narrative rather than the narrative itself, something which is rendered very elliptical especially towards the end. For those not used to Bresson this approach might seem eccentric, bizarre and off-putting, but trust me when I say there is method in his madness. The film demonstrates with crystalline clarity how the pursuit of non-Christian codes and values ends in a nihilistic abyss. This is very fitting for a director whose next film (The Devil Probably [1977]) demonstrates the effects the same neglect of Christian values will have on contemporary France. Both films are equally as bleak and uncompromising about the human condition. Not everyone will buy into this nihilism, but the films (especially Lancelot du Lac) are extraordinary for their beauty and the way Bresson matches theme with presentation to an amazingly precise degree.

As I alluded to earlier this AE release is excellent. It is given in the original aspect ratio (16:9 - 1.66:1) with Dolby digital mono sound. There are no extras which is a disappointment. The film is short (81 minutes) and surely an informed documentary could have been added or even a scholarly commentary. Never mind, like all Bresson this is a film which should be seen.",1411430400,3,11354,4.902705515088449
7846751,2,6303336981,"As a film teacher, a lifelong student of great cinema, and a fan of Bresson's work, I can't help but declare this to be surely Bresson's worst.

By virtually any standard this is an unmitigating failure with only its anti-epic qualities to recommend it; at least it can be taken as an honorable intent to subvert all of the things viewers expect in a costume epic.

It is true Bresson's minimalist style does succeed brilliantly in films like ""A Man Escaped"", ""Diary of a Country Priest"" and ""Pickpocket"" (Bresson's masterpiece) but one can't do Arthurian drama on the cheap. This time Bresson is way out of his league, even, at times, embarrassing. Both violence and sexuality are clumsily presented. In its pre-credit scene there is a beheading & a gory hacking as amateurish as the worst of Hershell Gordon Lewis, and the film's one 'love scene' is so naively and cliche-ridden with its silly fadeout as to seem that Bresson doesn't really understand this aspect of human nature. ""Lancelot du Lac"" is an extreme disappointment from this great French filmmaker --and let me remind you that it wasn't the stupid ""popcorn munching"" filmgoers who laughed and booed it at Cannes. It was the aesthete!

No matter: Bresson is a great filmmaker which this cannot diminish.

7846752,3,6303336981,"This is the grand Arthurian legend as told by a minimalistic French modernist who is completely fed up with the world and it's values and recoils in horror at modernity and plunges himself into nihilism. That's what kind of film you're getting yourself into if you venture here. It would be a great disservice to this wonderful filmmaker if the only film a viewer ever encountered by him was this obnoxiously formal treatment of a famous myth. All the Bressonian trademarks are there, the non-professional actors doing their best to be plastic models for the filmmaker to mold, the dispensement of most cinematic devices such as music or special-effects. The capture of reality with as little input from the production team as possible was always a prime motivation. It is not the actors or the story we care about when we watch this kind of anti-film, it's all about the style. However style has reached a nadir here and this film as much of late Bresson lacks the inward qualities that this filmmaker became renowned for earlier in his career.

Bresson without spiritual strength is all formality and pretense. Just imagine if Bresson made this film back in the 1950s or even 60s when he was on top of his game! What a masterpiece this could have been! As it is, this is not a film without merit but it lapses into stylized parody. Was Bresson even conscious of this or did he not care one bit like usual? Take the jousting sequence for one example. Endless shots of a musician playing the pipes, then endless shots of a flag being raised to denote a particular combatant, then endless shots of midsections of horses and combatants, then endless shots of crowd reactions. You could never tolerate anything like this from anyone but Bresson but here he's pushing it. Lancelot and Guinevere meet in secret to discuss their love and to discuss Lancelot forsaking that love to embrace a promise to God. The actors are rarely allowed to look at one another, their icy stares pointing downward. They meet again and again, say something half profound while staring at the ground and leave the scene. I can't go without mentioning Bresson's famous sound design. In prior films it is one of his strongest attributes, here in Lancelot of the Lake it turns into near comedy with the knights coming and going and their armor constantly clinking and rattling in every scene. It becomes ridiculous and even the most ardent of film fanatics will start to grin and possibly break out in a hearty laugh or two. It's a wild movie, what can I tell you. It is perhaps an anti-movie or one of the best examples of that.

Robert Bresson's work from the 1950s and 60s contain some of my all time favorite art in film form. Films like ""Diary of a Country Priest"", ""A Man Escaped"" and ""Pickpocket"". Quintessential films and not just for the movie buffs but for anyone capable of response to great art. Bresson's late period, from which all his color films spring, sport the same monumental technique but without the spiritual catharsis or rapture of the earlier work. If you are watching a black and white Bresson film, it will contain hope. If you are viewing a color film by Bresson, it will contain not much other than nihilism and despair. Well, it's all in French, so that makes it ok!",1256774400,14,3267,4.68
7846753,2,6303336981,"I don't think this is the worst film ever - but it comes close. I think R. Bresson is one of the greatest filmmakers ever - ""The Pickpocet"" is one of my favorite films - Joan of Arc is also very good. I also do love many of the ""artiest"" movies made, like Solaris,Stalker and The mirror by Tarkovskij or the Orpheus movies by Jean Cocteau.

7846755,1,6303336981,"I'm not sure what to make of the reviews in praise of this film. They reviewers are clearly not fans of Arthurian mythos or historical films either. Where they talk about understatement, minimalist approach or stripping the storyline down... I see only poor plotting, poor writing, bad direction and cynicism. There's room in Arthurian Mythos for chivalry to sit quite comfortably alongside anti-war, new age and early feminist messages but the Director fails to take advantage of this.

The action is atrocious. We have monty pythonesque blood spurting scenes and zero fight choreography - we might as well have been watching Ator the Fighting Eagle for all its authenticity. The armour clanks around uncomfortably on their gaunt frames - cuisses worn directly over tights (I pity the poor actors) and helmets worn without straps, padding or gorgets.

The acting is not so much restrained as wooden. On occassion we get a glimpse of emotion out of Guinevere but she seems emotionally worn out. The writing for Lancelot indicates that his character is self-involved and arrogant, but the actor appears simply bored with the role and never shows anything resembling the frustration and anger that Lancelot must be feeling. Gawain is the only decent character in this mess and contrary to legend, he manages to get killed by Lancelot whilst avenging his brother.

Then there's the endless shots of people arming and disarming - shooting sequentially what should have been simultaneous. Not to mention the raucus bird cries, the incessant horse neighing, the truly awful musette (and I love bagpipes...), the local peasant actors (they look like Bretons), the gaudy pink and orange saddles, the castles without gates, the lack of characterisation and the linear plot.

It all combines to make this the greatest waste of money I've ever spent. I'd rather have picked up a copy of Dungeons and Dragons the movie. If I could give it zero stars I would.",1149552000,10,1946,5.052959501557632
7846756,1,6303336981,"Anyone who can call this piece of Fench rubbish a 'masterpiece' is obviously caught up in that delusional mindset of Art moives having to be stripped of everything to make them powerful; therefore it must be a masterpiece is a myth; so much so there's nothing left but a depressing mess. The actors say or do nothing more than clump around in their shiny armour which they never seem to take off, all the time brooding woodenly, and talking to each other like robots, stripped of emotion. The soundtrack is appalling; all through the movie the sound intrudes with the nonstop clancking of armour and a single horse neighing over and over and over again in the background, the same horse, the same neighs. The jousting scene is so boring and repetitious you fall into a mind-numbed trance and you wonder how any director could make such a scene so DULL - and like the neighing horse in the background, it's played over and over again until you feel like screaming, ""Get on with it!"" like that brilliant scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail (a far better movie; buy that one instead).

How this film can be seen as a masterpiece can only be described as self-delusion; or is it just because it's French and therefore must be a masterpiece?  Lancelot of the Lake is a borish waste of a story that is in essense powerful and passionate and full of human struggles; there's no passion in this - Let's not go to this Camelot; tis a silly place...",1135987200,13,1446,4.53639846743295
7846757,5,6303336981,"This is a sombre version of the Arthurian legend, and in my view very much in tone with Thomas Malory's 15th century version. The latter is dark and foreboding, and so is this film. The deeds of arms of the knights are represented in terms that undermine the ideals of chivalry. There is only death, blood and severed body parts everywhere. The heap of bodies on which the last shot of the film focuses is the climax of this violence.

At the centre of this film stands the love between Guinevere and Lancelot, sublimely represented in the film: Guinevere waits for Lancelot's return in silence, and suffers for her love of him. Lancelot has come to the point where he tries to resist this love, for the sake of chivalry, but it is interesting to see the way in which he fails in his attempt to relinquish Guinevere.

I dare say this film is essential for anyone seriously interested in the Arthurian legend, and for anyone who has a clear understanding that the latter is not romance Hollywood style, but much darker. This is definitely not a film for everyone. There is a lot of blood and violence in the film, its atmosphere is dark, the dialogue is designedly monotonous, to match the sombre mood of the film, and there is no musical score throughout, except a very little in the beginning and end. It is exquisite in that it tells the story of a great love, accompanied by great suffering, and in that it demystifies any romantic notions we might have had about Arthur and his knights, as seen in other films of the genre. The austerity of the interiors also does away with our romantic illusions.

The acting is amazing, and I identified with the actor playing Guinevere in particular. The last scene of the movie, in which Lancelot, dying, says only one word: ""Guinevre"" (French version of Guinevere), stays with the viewer forever.",1122508800,24,1839,4.634969325153374
7846758,4,6303336981,"Robert Bresson is one of the most methodic directors of French cinema. In a way like Godard, you will either love his movies or find them a bit too intellectual - sometimes lacking the qualities that make us just sit back and enjoy. I found that I both love and hate his version of the Arthurian legend. At times the claustrophobia of the camera work is very effective - at other times it makes it very absurd. One thing is for sure, there are shades of genius in this film, the shots in the forest, in particular, bring some very relieving shades of green in the film. You also do get a sense of what the characters are wrestling with inside - and it is a very disturbing portrait, to be sure. Though I rate most of Bresson's previous work 5 stars - I think for now I will rate this 4 - but I still would like to watch it again to see what other impressions I get from it.",1113264000,4,873,4.111111111111111
7846759,3,6303336981,"French director Robert Bresson crafts this grim, anti-romantic, and super-artsy, somewhat low-budget deconstruction of the Arthurian legend.  As the films begins, the Knights return from a futile and spectacularly failed attempt to find the Holy Grail; Arthur's Camelot is a miserable, somewhat grubby encampment -- when riders from a neighboring hamlet come to challenge the remnants of Arthur's army to a jousting tournament, one senses that the ""king"" has lost his power amid a cloud of failure, impotence and doubt.  In terms of the story itself, in how Bresson subverts and undercuts the glamour of legend, this is an interesting film.  However, as an actual movie, it's rather stilted and pretentious, and not very enjoyable, outside of the ironic intellectual and filmic parameters set by the director.  It's practically a ""dogme"" film: the sound design is rather poor, and the camera work is (purposefully) irritating: the film's lasting motif is the constant tracking of legs -- the stockinged legs of the knights as they slowly traipse about, the legs of their horses which are shown in place of the action when the warriors ride to battle.  For much of the film, visually speaking, the actors do not exist above the waist... it's an artsy break with cinematic convention that's meant to wow films students and which mimics the loftiness of the direction.  Cool for academics, I suppose, but if you're looking for a sword-'n'-sandals flick, this one might really bug you.  I'm sure the guys from Monty Python must have been lampooning this when they made ""Holy Grail,"" but for many viewers, Bresson's version will seem funny-bad enough.",1108771200,8,1646,5.119402985074627
