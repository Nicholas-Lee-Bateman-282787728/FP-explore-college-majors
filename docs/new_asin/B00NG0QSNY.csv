8677793,5,B00NG0QSNY,"A beautiful movie about the friendship that develops between two people and the music that brings them together. This is a movie you can watch over and over again, listening to the music from Kate Tucker and viewing the scenery of the Pacific Northwest coast. Both Noah Drew and Kate Tucker are excellent in this ""must see"" film/musical written and directed by Dustin Morrow.",1431820800,,375,4.875
