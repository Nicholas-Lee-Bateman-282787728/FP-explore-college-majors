8456646,3,B0054G438K,"I LOVE Stacy McCarthy & her yoga videos... she does such a GREAT job encouraging you, explaining the poses, & making sure that you are continuously improving the poses! My 3 star review is reflective of the condition that the DVD was received. The listing said that the condition was ""very good."" It was far from very good condition! The DVD box doesn't even close because it's in such bad condition & smashed. There is a small part of the DVD that skips, but luckily it's not at an active yoga part, it's during the introduction part. So I love the DVD for the yoga, but I definitely wouldn't order from this seller again.",1503964800,,623,4.473684210526316

8456648,5,B0054G438K,"I am obsessed with this video.
  I am pretty much on the beginner's side of yoga.  I have dabbled in it for years but never stuck to it.
The video is fantastic.  Stacey breaks every move down for each level.  So, there's some thing for you no matter what level of yoga you are.  You can always find some way to push yourself.
The video is very professional looking yet simple.  Nothing too flashy or distracting.
Stacey is very pleasant to listen to.
I always feel fantastic when finished.  A little sore....but I still feel great.
It doesn't say on the cover but you most likely will need yoga blocks for several moves.
Other than that, a yoga mat and a quiet place and you're set!

10 out of 10! ",1441152000,3,698,4.3
8456649,5,B0054G438K,I love this video ! I'm not a mom but this was the 2nd yoga work video I got and it's great ! I recommend this yoga video !,1430611200,2,123,3.2758620689655173
8456650,5,B0054G438K,"Great workout; less than 40 minutes long.  Instructor is clear and gives poses for modifications.  It's very relaxing, and after I'm done, my low back and hips feel nice and stretched out.",1417478400,4,188,4.84375
8456651,5,B0054G438K,"I was able to do this video with my 1 year old playing around me, which is rare.  The poses are manageable and I love that Stacy offers 3 different levels.  Her explanations are easy to understand and I like how she explains the purpose of each position and what muscles we're working.  I stay relatively in shape and I still was very sore after this first workout.  It's a keeper and I recommend it to others!",1389744000,5,410,4.285714285714286
8456652,5,B0054G438K,I do this workout while my son is sleeping and I feel like I'm getting a good core workout while also feeling very relaxed after I'm finished. I saw she has 4 other yoga dvd's here on amazon. I think I'm going to purchase them all and choose one every week to get a different workout. Highly recommend!,1358899200,,302,4.224137931034483
8456653,5,B0054G438K,"I was wary about ordering this yoga DVD, partly because it was a new release without other reviews and partly because of the slighly cheesy 'busy mom yoga' title. I am so glad I took the leap of faith and this is becoming a regular part of my rotation! A little bit about my background--I began studying yoga asana when I was 14. Back in my early to mid 20's I had a fairly serious power/hot yoga practice and was hitting some advanced poses. Getting married, two years of miscarriages, having my now 2yr old son, and 8yrs in a full time desk job has translated into losing a lot of the energy, muscle tone and flexibility I once had (and finding about 10-15 extra, stubborn pounds along the way). I began making time for exercise this spring, but found running and Jillian Michaels (while effective) were just amping up my anxiety and I have been getting sick every few weeks. 5am is the only time I can reliably work out, and I struggle to find the motivation to take on an energetic workout regularly. I'm focusing on natural ways to deal with the anxiety and addressing the stress my current (blessed!) life brings, and reconnecting with yoga in a very different way; but I need new yoga DVDs since my focus has changed quite a bit.

It was wonderful to start the video and see her begin with some standing side and forward bends, rather than diving into full sun saluations; actually there are none in the video! The video includes cat/cow, leg balances, shoulder stretches, standing poses, core work, hip stretches and a brief savasana. The poses and sequencing definitely addressed my stiff neck/shoulder, lower back and hip areas, and I felt almost like I'd had a gentle massage afterwards. The core work is pretty mild for anyone with good conditioning, but in my current weak state I felt a slight challenge without feeling cranky about doing it. I wish the savasana was a tad bit longer with more transition to sitting, but find that's a common issue in many yoga videos. You absolutely need a block for a legs-in-the-air pose coming from a supported bridge position (setu banda sarvangasana). The DVD info doesn't indicate props at all, though she makes many suggestions using 2 blocks and a strap. Also I will caution that this video is not for complete novices to yoga. She does a great job with indicating level 1,2,3 pose options, she does pay some attention to form and breathing, and most of her cueing is on time (she's a few breaths late letting you know you're in downward dog at one point). So you should be familiar with yoga poses, and ideally have had some class time where an experienced instructor has given you pointers on alignment. The poses are not tricky and I like that she kept the program moving, but a true beginner might feel she is moving fast without enough guidance. The brief Metta/lovingkindness meditation bonus section is also nice and unintimitdating in case you are completely new to meditation; I wish more yoga DVDs provided some kind of guided meditation or pranayama instruction. She is also positive, friendly and informative without being overly chatty or sweet, and I think her style is very approachable--she uses English phrases for all the poses. With my background and needs right now, this busy mom is definitely glad to have found 'busy mom yoga' and I am definitely interested in adding more Stacy McCarthy videos to my routine.",1354147200,17,3388,4.703703703703703
8456654,5,B0054G438K,"I love that Stacy includes core muscles in this one. It''s a great practice for in between, when I have just enough time to take care of myself and well being. Besides that, Stacy has a soothing voice that keeps me inspired and focused every time. Love the music too. Great job!",1307923200,4,278,4.365384615384615
8456655,5,B0054G438K,This video is perfect for my busy life when I need a little break in my day and don't have time to run to the gym or yoga studio. This Yoga DVD helps me maintain my strength and flexibility. Stacy makes it easy to follow with each practice and gives me alternative choices when I can't get those challenging postures. It's like having my own private teacher come to my home and encourages me each time. I love it.,1307923200,4,413,4.2405063291139244
