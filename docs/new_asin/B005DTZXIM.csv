4662018,4,B005DTZXIM,"I love Gregory Peck and had not seen The Purple Plain before, I was not disappointed with this movie. I also had never seen Play Dirty either, so the ending was a surprise. Would advocate other to watch the set.",1373500800,7,211,4.3

4662032,5,B005DTZXIM,"I initially got this set for Play Dirty, which I had seen several times in my early teens on regular broadcast TV (not cable), and all the memories it brought. The other two had seen years later and are just as enjoyable so they were an added bonus to PD. This is a very good bargain since when I was looking for Play Dirty just that one by itself was $15 or more just on DVD format. Is an old movie so getting it on Blu-ray will improve it some but considering the technology of the time and its limitations on enhancement with today's tech, you might as well get on this DVD combo pack. A nice addition to your classic DVD war movie collection.",1455148800,,646,4.176
4662033,4,B005DTZXIM,"Three pretty interesting war movies, with good casts, good acting and great scenery.  None of these are academy award films but solid films that should hold your interest if you are into this type of film.  All three have strong phycological implications and strong character development.",1453248000,,288,5.239130434782608

4662057,5,B005DTZXIM,"A great collection of classic military movies starring Michael Caine, Gregory Peck and Christopher Walken.  These are must haves in any military action fan's collection!  As a Soldier, I like the direct action nature of these type movies - they don't waste time with a bunch of political correctness that seems in vogue these days.  These stars are from the old school - they act boldly without apology - and carry the movies alone on the weight of their acting skills.  Some films replace acting with action.  With these classics, the action complements the great acting of these leading men.  Highly recommend this great film collection - you get a lot for your money in one package!",1412726400,6,685,4.811965811965812

8467566,5,B005DTZXIM,"Bought it for Dogs of War, however the other two movies are great. Loved the cross desert travel and winching up scenes in play dirty. Liked purple plain as well. I don't remember seeing those 2 before.",1511049600,,202,4.486486486486487

8467569,4,B005DTZXIM,"I recall the movie from many years ago.  I liked it then, I like it now.  I've known people like Walken portrayed so it isn't much of a stretch to watch a piece of reality from Hollywood.  Walken did a good job on his rendition of a paid warrior, not able to see the future when he  plays a part in a ping pong movie.",1483920000,,317,3.830769230769231
8467570,4,B005DTZXIM,"I found play dirty a first-rate war film.  The Dogs of War and The Purple Plain came as the rest of the package.  Despite Gregory Peck in the latter movie, to rate the pair as so-so would be giving them a huge favor.  Nevertheless, the purchase was worth the effort on an overall basis.",1483056000,,286,4.2592592592592595
