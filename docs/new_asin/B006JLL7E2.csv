8499433,5,B006JLL7E2,I watched this film because of the title. Then I re-watched and finally bought it. It is a very good film to add to your library.,1521244800,,129,4.0
8499434,5,B006JLL7E2,"It was good to be able to see this film again close to  its original aspect ratio.  The print quality and packaging is fine.

Unfortunately when it is shown here in the US on TV it is always shown in a lower size and much of the film needs
 the larger aspect ratio",1480982400,,264,3.9245283018867925
8499435,5,B006JLL7E2,The only one to buy if you are looking for the original widescreen version.  My cable  system recently played the Fox version of the movie in the pan and scan format-it was not watchable.,1478908800,,187,4.470588235294118
8499436,5,B006JLL7E2,"If you really want this film on DVD, the Italian issue ""23 passi del Delitto"" is definitely the one to get.  Unlike the 20th Century Fox ""Cinema Archives"" MOD disc, which is a dismal ""pan and scan"" after the opening credits, this one maintains the Cinemascope image all the way though, and the video quality is as good as the MOD image, if not even better.  The top menu on the disc allows you to choose English, Italian, or Spanish languages, along with true scene access.  This is well worth the money.",1441065600,3,504,4.456521739130435
8499437,5,B006JLL7E2,"The movie is based on the book ""Warrant for X"" by Philip MacDonald. So it has a lot of the same characters as in the movie ""The List of Adrian Messenger"" (1963).

The story has changed a tad form the book. Van Johnson plays a blind playwright (they never say how he got blinded) At first being blind seems like a gimmick but you soon get swept up in the film and the great acting by Van Johnson and it seems perfectly normal.

Phillip Hannon (Van Johnson) over hears two people plotting something sinister but being blind he does not know what they look like. He tells the authorities but they fluff him off. So with the help of his man Bob Matthews (Cecil Parker) and his ex-betrothed Jean Lennox (Vera Miles) they track down their only lead Miss Alice MacDonald (Patricia Laffan who played Devil Girl From Mars""). We watch as Phil has to use his skills to find the plotters before it is too late.

I watch this movie about once a month like clockwork. I know most of the dialog by heart. At one point Phil tells Bob to call Miss Lennox a taxi; I cannot help myself and say ""Miss Lennox you are a taxi"".

All kidding aside you will also find yourself watching it again and again for the nuances and some things that seem missing as if they cut something out here and there.
