7982691,5,B00008G7PF,Amazing DVD,1501027200,,11,5.0
7982692,5,B00008G7PF,"This teaches most of what I learned when I was young and jamming with older players. I think most beginners will enjoy it and gain the basics
of playing this style of blues. I will also add that I have two other books by this individual that are not much more than a repeat of this information.
I not saying ""Don't purchase it. I am saying research this Persons offerings and decide which one you would prefer to spend your money on.",1478995200,,433,4.2926829268292686
7982693,5,B00008G7PF,"Keith Wyatt is the best instructor, by far. He doesn't just show demonstrations of the rhythm licks, but provides context so you can see how each lick is used in a song. This video would provide a good companion to Keith's book ""Blues Rhythm Guitar, The Complete Guide to Shuffles, Boogies, Jump, Slow Blues, and other Blues Styles"". The book goes into more detail and should be purchased if you want to continue learning blues rhythm styles. I bought the book first some time ago and find the DVD to more on a beginner level, but noticed it makes some of the book's examples easier to follow. Understanding the low, mid and high-range rhythm parts described in the book is easier because the DVD shows how they are used in demonstrations with a backing band. The book is probably the better product, but with the DVD, it helps to actually see someone performing the examples to get into the feel of the blues.",1448150400,,910,4.588957055214724
7982694,5,B00008G7PF,"Keith doesn't waste time with bogus courses or promises to disclose special secret guitar magic...he just shows you patiently how to proceed from beginner to the next levels using basic requirements in a reachable, do-able way. Nothing mysterious after he shows you the way...and his hands aren't hidden by bad camera work or a sudden burst of discourse of 23 minutes of bizarre theory...he goes from point A to the next stage nicely just like a normal individual...a rare breed...I've been at the guitar for 40 years and I'm still a beginner...good enough to get into a band but not  a pro player. I've bought a lot of music lessons...Wyatt is worth a  lot more than I paid. He takes you right to IT all you have to do is practice.",1365292800,4,732,4.580152671755725
7982695,4,B00008G7PF,"This DVD provides a great foundation for blues rhythm guitar.  There are a few places where the instructor could have taken just a bit more time to explain and shown what he was playing, but it gets the job done.  One great aspect to this lesson is the way the instructor takes what was taught and then models it with a band.  I like the way he introduces chords as well.  Too often, a bunch of chords are thrown at you and it becomes overwhelming. In this cse, however, the chords build and spiral repeatedly so that you pick them up more naturally.

I hope to make it through this DVD in a few weeks.  Then, I would definitely look for the next level of blues rhythm instruction by this teacher.",1356912000,2,697,4.282442748091603
7982696,5,B00008G7PF,"This DVD is great for pre-intermediate/intermediate players. I got it as a gift from my friend and it's amazing. The lessons cover many stuffs: styles ( woogie boogie, slow blues, minor blues), turnarounds, endings, timing, how to play in a band context ... Keith's approach is very clear and easy to follow. If you like this DVD, you should buy Blues rhythm guitar, an excellent book about blues rhythm by Keith Wyatt.",1344384000,3,419,4.833333333333333
7982697,1,B00008G7PF,"This product just lacked in quality. Plus, the disc was temperamental, it would get stuck, stop and start at regular intervals.",1239408000,2,127,5.095238095238095
7982698,5,B00008G7PF,I have several DVDs and Keith is by far the best teacher I've come across. Get it. It's worth 10 times what they're charging for it.,1185926400,3,132,4.115384615384615
