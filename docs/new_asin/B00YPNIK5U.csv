7223765,5,B00YPNIK5U,I don't know of many women who were not in love with Vince Edwards. The CDs were in great shape.,1450828800,2,96,3.85
7223766,2,B00YPNIK5U,Ben Casey is a great drama with good actors and great writing. The problem is that these are public domain episodes and the quality of the sound and video is really poor. If you can deal with the poor quality then this is a very good series.,1441065600,4,241,4.148936170212766

8718725,5,B00YPNIK5U,"At the time I purchased this DVD a few years ago it was very scarce. But I loved the show from watching it on TV reruns years ago.
I am very happy I chose to buy this. It brought back many memories and even though it is in black and white it was a total joy to watch.
The episodes were very clear. It is worth every penny and then some !!!",1533513600,,339,3.7222222222222223

8718730,5,B00YPNIK5U,"I believe that this is one of the best vintage TV programs in the American history. Seeing these stories we can feel not only humans virtuousness and benevolentness but also proactive spirits of American TV drama makers. We can find a lot of excellent dramas and moves about medical world, I believe this one has set a good example how they should be!",1495324800,4,351,4.587301587301587
8718731,4,B00YPNIK5U,"It's a pity that these were never digitally remastered, however I enjoyed watching them immensely, it was one of my favourite TV shows at the time, and it was great to see them again. The posted publicly as Betty Gray is incorrect, I have always used my full name Elizabeth and would like this corrected please. Thank you.",1484956800,5,322,4.568965517241379
8718732,5,B00YPNIK5U,"I started to write a review but it somehow got deleted. I don't know how profound Dr. Zorba would find that, but I guess it means that I'm required to start over again. I was supposed to receive this disc from Reel Deal Classics anywhere from February 1st to March 6th. Here it is January 12th and it's already here. The discs were grainy and the audio kind of fuzzy, but for a Public Domain show like Ben Casey it was definitely watchable. The acting by Vince Edwards, Sam Jaffe and Bettye Ackerman was outstanding. This was a riveting and intense show leaning towards the intellectual and cerebral. One of the most unforgettable shows ever made. It isn't HD but I still give it 5 Stars just because they really don't make shows like this anymore. I plan to buy Volumes 2 and 3 at a later time. Thanks again Amazon and to Reel Deal Classics. Well worth the gamble I took on this product.",1484179200,7,888,4.387878787878788
