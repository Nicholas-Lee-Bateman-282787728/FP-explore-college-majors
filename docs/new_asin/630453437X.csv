Directed by Ringo Lam  (""Twin Dragons"" with Jackie Chan) and featuring the world's  coolest actor, Chow Yun Fat, this film is an exercise in tension, image,  and style.
You know the plot if you've seen that *other* film, but for  those curious few who haven't seen it, Chow plays a young cop who works  outside the norm on the Kowloon police force. Asked to do one last job,Chow  infiltrates a gang of jewel thieves, led by Danny Lee. Lee, who you purists  know as the detective in ""The Killer"", shines in his  performance.
While its a feast for the eyes, this one can sometimes stall  from too many plotlines being examined at once. Hence, the four stars.  Still, watch this enough times, and you can start a career for yourself in  Hollywood too....",912470400,,937,4.452941176470588
