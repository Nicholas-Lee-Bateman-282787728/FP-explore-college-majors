7917294,3,B00003CX36,"Rather dull and listless I suppose my expectations were too high on the percussion side, Collins is no Buddy Rich he's a rock drummer without the feel of big band jazz. Rich needs no salute his performances are legend.",1402099200,,218,4.615384615384615
7917295,5,B00003CX36,"The Jazzband period of Phil Collins hasn't really been represented adequately on video. We'll get occasional videos through DVD or BLu-Ray bonuses (Phil Collins - The First Final Farewell Concert, and Phil Collins Live in Montreux come to mind) but not as stand-alone products.

This Salute to Buddy Rich is a fantastic tribute to the Genius of Buddy Rich and is also a great representation of Phil Collins' love for the jazz thing.

A recommended purchase in my case !",1382918400,,469,4.85

7917297,5,B00003CX36,"I watched this for the first time last night, and was amazed at the drumming of Phil Collins, as I had never heard him play jazz before.  Seeing and hearing him play with Buddy Rich's band was just the greatest, and he definetly fitted in.

I highly reccomend this DVD to all who love the music of the great Buddy Rich and all those who just like watching/listening to really good drummers. The other drummers on this album are all in a class by themselves, it's just that I had never heard Phil play jazz, and it touched me trmendously.",1168905600,2,537,4.36
7917298,5,B00003CX36,"Absolutely excellent DVD. Great sound and quality picture plus the major talents of Phil Collins, Dennis Chambers and Steve Smith really playing hard on some of Buddy's greatest stuff. Phil is (in my opinion) one of the greatest jazz drummers around and not too many people know how capable he is, as he is known for mainly for his rock drumming with Genesis and solo R&B/jazz stuff, but Genesis would from time to time utilize and add bits of jazz-fusion styled ideas into their music. Of course seeing them live it was obivious they were major talents. Phil still has it! Dennis also plays great (as he usually does). He is one of the busiest drummers on the jazz/rock scene with the bands Niacin, CAB and numerous sesions with cutting edge artitsts. Dennis really drives the music with lightning speed and precision. Steve Smith is always interesting as well. Seeing all these guys play incredible jazz performed live is well worth the money.",1096243200,11,945,4.803680981595092
7917299,4,B00003CX36,"You want to see some good drumming, don't get this tape.  You want to see some great drumming, then buy this tape.  The best part about this version of the Buddy Rich series is, of course, the addition of Phil Collins to the setlist.  Phil is without a doubt one of the best drummers in the world and his work speaks for itself.  He has proven himself time and again on numerous albums over the years in the genre of rock and pop, bu t this is indeed something different.  First, let me say this, I am a huge fan of Phil's.  I really like just about everything he has done (except his last album, ugh) and his drumming has always been top-notch.  That said, I feel he is a little out of his league here.  I give the man credit for taking on the whole big band project, I really do.  I think the songs he does here are better than the stuff he put on the live CD ""Hot Night in Paris"", on the whole.  In the end, I liked watching and listening and studying what all the drummers on this tape did.  If you like Phil for his drumming, get this tape and decide for yourself.",1016755200,,1069,4.0669856459330145
7917300,4,B00003CX36,"This concert is a tribute to THE drummer, Buddy Rich.  He STILL exists in every drummer's (mostly over 40) heart, mind and soul.  Phil Collins plays with Buddy's band on most of this video.  Unfortunatelly, with all due  respect to this great musician, Phil Collins, he should have been the MC  and let other well known drummers play with the band who have studied and  learned from Buddy. The other fantastic drummers mentioned that are part of  this video seem to be mostly talking about Buddy and do very little playing  on the video.  They should have been doing MOST of the playing instead of  Phil.  Before I go further let me say that I respect and enjoy Phil's  playing and style just as much as I do Buddy's.  Phil is an excellent  drummer, singer and all around musician's musician, as we all know, but his  style does NOT lend itself to the Buddy Rich band.  And, he sounded like he  had not been playing drums for a while (not practiced) on this video.  His  usual playing confidence was just NOT there.  He came no where near cutting  the charts with the power, sting, warmth and sensitivety of Buddy Rich.  However, four stars ARE in order for this video for the respect and  affection shown for this unbelievable drummer, Buddy Rich.  Phil Collins  has gained even more respect from me for doing this tribute.  I saw Buddy  five times in person in my life from The Cellar in Washington, DC in the  late 60's to one of his last performances at Billy Bob's (of all places) in  the Ft Worth Texas Stockyards.  I have been listening to everything I can  find by him since I was 14 and I'm now 54.  I play a little myself, but if  I ever felt like I was ""the drummer"" when playing professionally,  all I had to do was put on a side with Buddy.  It'll bring you to your  technical knees as a drummer and wipe that ""I'm the best""  attitude right out of your mind.  Maybe that was Phil's problem on the  video.  Buddy intimidated his playing as well, even from the grave.  No one  has come close to him , technically, and I don't think anyone ever will.",962323200,10,2060,4.355437665782493
