8207986,5,B000T7M8TA,"This movie came out while I was living in Paris and I loved it so much I saw it twice in theaters. I wanted so badly to share the movie with my friends and family in the states, but I was worried I wouldn't find a copy compatible with my DVD player. This copy is perfect, and everybody I've shown it to loves the movie!",1257897600,,319,3.923076923076923
8207987,3,B000T7M8TA,"In one of her most contemporary roles, Marion Cotillard plays Alice, one of many girls romanced by Yann (Bezace), an immature man whose life is limited by his fear of flying (and comittment).  With bottle-blonde hair, dressed in beatup jeans and a leather jacket, Alice is charming and sexy, with a great little walk and clear eyes.  She was bitterly disappointed by her marriage yet continues to seek companionship and love.  She and Yann become friends; one day he decides he has fallen in love with Alice, and asks her to dinner.  She arrives with an open face and heart, clearly vulnerable to being loved by someone whom she at least likes.  Before this moment can blossom, however, Alice hears a message left on Yann's answering machine by his former lover. In trying to explain how this happened, he lies to her.  Game and Match.  She gets up and leaves, and won't return to him. In such a light scene, Cotillard's face reveals the hurt so vividly that it's almost painful to watch.  This is reminiscient of a scene in LOVE ME IF YOU DARE, when Sophie is listening to what she thinks is a marriage proposal she's been waiting to hear for years, meanwhile hiding her feelings.  Her disappointment, too, is delicately  but memorably revealed by Cotillard, who at the same time reminds the viewer that such hurts can break the heart and spirit of a human being.  Great stuff here, and she's still in her 20s in these films.",1213228800,6,1426,4.6414342629482075
