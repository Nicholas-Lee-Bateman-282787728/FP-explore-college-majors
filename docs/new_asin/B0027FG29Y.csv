I never saw this coming.

I've read the SUPERMAN/BATMAN story of PUBLIC ENEMIES, but I never assumed that WB/DC animation would actually go through with adapting it as a straight-to-DVD work. Hopefully if is done with the same magic that produced SUPERMAN/DOOMSDAY, BATMAN: GOTHAM KNIGHT, WONDER WOMAN (WB/DC get wise: a sequel is needed, or at least an animated series) and hopefully with GREEN LANTERN: FIRST FLIGHT, it will be a winner.

If anything, aside from the TRINITY (soon to be adapted to DVD in the future, most likely), here is hoping DC and the WB Animation studios will take a look of these other heroes/characters and give them a greenlight for a potential shot for their own animated flicks down the road:

1. AQUAMAN

2. THE FLASH

3  JONAH HEX

4. THE DOOM PATROL

5. SGT. ROCK

6. JUSTICE LEAGUE: TOWER OF BABEL

7. THE FOURTH WORLD TRILOGY: THE NEW GODS, THE FOREVER PEOPLE, MISTER MIRACLE

8. SWAMP THING

9. THE WARLORD

10. ADAM STRANGE

11. CRISIS ON INFINATE EARTHS

12. KINGDOM COME

One more added dream project that I hope both the heads of both WB/DC Animation and Marvel Animation will consider: a DVD crossover event. Hopefully someone will get a clue and make this happen.",1248048000,9,1232,4.76303317535545

It perfectly captures the bromance that Batman and Superman have in the comic book series that this movie was adapted from. My only camplain with the film is that they put really interesting, and epic characters like Katana, Black Lightning, Starfire, etc. just to be there because, aside from some action moves, they didn't have one single line of dialogue in the entire movie.

If you have read any comics with Lex in it before, you know that he is the bad guy and he doesn't care about anyone but himself.  Therefore when it turned out he was just using the situation to his advantage in order to destroy Superman and Batman, I wasn't really surprised all that much.  I did like seeing Captain Atom and Power Girl there, they are pretty good characters.  However a lot of the villains that showed up in order to claim the bounty on Superman and Batman were pretty obscure and I didn't know who half of them were.

The comet is made of solid green Kryptonite that was left over from Krypton which exploded ages ago. The new President of the United States, Lex Luthor, not only wants to stop the comet, but he wants to do it completely on his own in order to satisfy his ego.

Being pressured to seek help from the world's superheroes, Luthor stages a meeting with Superman and frames him for a murder. To make things worst for the Man of Steel, Luthor places a one billion dollar bounty on his head. This action draws out many villains to claim the money, and several allies have sided with Lex Luthor only because he's the President. Together with Batman, Superman intends on stopping the comet but they must also fight off a legion of villains and superheroes. -summary

Superman Batman: Public Enemies is a 2009 straight to DVD animated feature directed by Sam Liu. It's the 6th animated film in the DC Universe line up. The movie is based off Jeph Loeb's graphic novel of the same name and despite alterations in the storyline; it's still a faithful adaptation of the original source material, and as a fan of the comic book I'm pleased with what I got here, even though the movie is nothing more than one slugfest after another.

The movie is heavily driven by its action scenes ,and as far as the die hard action fan may be concerned there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. The action scenes are full of the stuff superhero movies are made of, which are the performance of highly exaggerated physical feet and incredibly hard blows that can shake your living room if you have surround sound. There is way more than enough action to keep action junkies satisfied. Visually, the movie is pretty strong with the character designs being heavily influenced by Ed McGuinness art style. The heroes and villains both are amazingly huge, and female characters like Power Girl are huge in the right places. She can no doubt give Psylocke a run for her money.

I enjoyed the music score by Christopher Drake as it gives off that epic feel which helps the movie feel like it's more than an extended Justice League episode. The sound effects are very good with some earth-shattering blows to the face along with the energy blast mix-ups. I also have to commend the production staff for creating that retro feel, by bringing together the all star cast made up of Tim Daly (Superman), Kevin Conroy (Batman), and Clancy Brown (Lex Luthor). These three have some amazing chemistry together that can be felt through the performances, but I think Brown stood out the best here when going from the calm and collected to the psychotic Luthor.

The movie definitely has the style portion down to a science, and there is some good development on the friendship between Superman and Batman; but the action clearly tries to overshadow the under-developed story. There are certain elements that really aren't properly fleshed out and just aren't easy to buy in to. It never felt as if the comet was a huge threat, and at times I even forgot about it altogether, and this is something that really shouldn't happen. To me, a central plot device to a story should never feel like a side plot. Also, it was never really made clear how the public felt about Superman being a murderer. This story element felt way too forced and borderline into complete absurdity.

I give props to the writing team for injecting a who's who gallery of heroes and villains (especially). Comic geeks will have no problem keeping track of the faces pulled from many rogues galleries of heroes such as; Fire Storm, Flash, Aquaman, and even Wonder Woman. However, casual fans may not care at all,and will see nothing but a bunch of faces.

Overall, Superman Batman: Public Enemies is a very solid action romp, and one doesn't need to read the graphic novel to be clued in to anything else. Those whom are hoping to see a complete page by page re-telling of the book should set their expectations low. Parents whom are concerned about what their children watch should know the violence level is somewhat high, with there being a small amount of blood and a little bit of profanity. In any case, I enjoyed it quite a bit despite the small differences from the book. The movie has a 67 minute run time.

Pros: Lots of action, very solid voice acting and music score, animation and artwork

Cons: Length, half cooked story, not too friendly on casual fans",1428364800,2,4545,4.67125

The Man of Steel has been framed for the murder of Metallo.

Now on the publics radar as a wanted man, Superman must team up with his greatest allyand closest friendBatman, to clear his name and show the public what really happened the night Metallo died. But before he can do that, he must survive an onslaught of superheroes and supervillains alike, all of whom have come to cash in on the bounty for his capture.

Meanwhile, a giant kryptonite meteor is on a collision course for Earth, making things even worse for the Man of Steel who has no way to stop it, especially since the President of the United States, Lex Luthor, wants to destroy it himself with nuclear missiles.

Will the Earth survive and will Superman restore his good name?

This movie, based on the graphic novel by Jeph Loeb and Ed McGuinness, Superman/Batman: Public Enemies, is a comic book fans dream come true. Not only does it feature all of comicdoms two most popular icons, but also a super supporting cast consisting of Power Girl, Captain Atom, Major Force, Black Lightning, Starfire, Katana and a host of other familiar faces, including, but not limited to, Captain Cold, Mr. Freeze, Bane, Lady Shiva and a ton of others.

The story is solid, simple, but enough to really showcase each character: Superman as the one who doesnt kill; Batman as the disgruntled detective; Lex Luthor as the glory-seeking, power-mad Presidentit totally works. The pacing was bang on and not once was I bored. Even the humor was in-step with the rest of the movie and didn't come across like jokes from left field. Case in point, the giant robot in the end wouldve come across as goofy had not an explanation been given for the way it looked.

There was a good give-and-take between Batman and Superman in this flick, too, both in their banter with one another, their approach to doing things, and also in saving each others bacon. Sometimes it seems that whenever the two team up, its always Batman that saves Superman. It was awesome a balance was finally struck between who helps who and when.

Im a huge fan of Ed McGuinnesss rendition of Superman and to see that they mimicked that art style in this feature made this fanboy happy. His Superman is big and strong and powerful. His Batman is top notch, too, same with the other characters.

Of course, having Superman voiced by Tim Daly and Batman voiced by Kevin Conroy only adds to it as these guys were the voice talent behind these characters on their respective animated series. I really wish they wouldve been used for all the animated movies, but sadly thats not the case and, of course, therere different behind-the-scenes reasons as to why that is. Regardless, each actor captures each character perfectly, their tone, inflections and presentation reflecting the hero they're supposed to portray.

Superman/Batman: Public Enemies was one of the early feature-length DC animated movies and still holds up to this day as a classic.

Highly Recommended.",1428105600,,2989,4.773255813953488

3867271,5,B0027FG29Y,"This is the worlds finest here. Other stories have shown Superman and Batman to be at odds with each other. That's fine sometimes, but it is so much more enjoyable when they are a team. This is how it should be done! A true collaboration between a hero with powers and a hero with wealth and extended resources. I loved the friendship between Superman and Batman. Their banter between one another highlights that while they are different, they still have a common goal for good and protecting others.

My only complaint is that the storyline is just average. But in all honesty, I shouldn't expect Shakespeare. This is an animated superhero action adventure. Thus, other than the average story, I felt that this film is a great example of 2 of the best heroes in action. I also enjoyed the art style and character design. The animation itself is decent but nothing too special. It is fluid, and shows that it contains a bigger budget than animation for television series. That is not a knock on any animated TV series at all, because animated TV shows such as Justice League Unlimited and Wolverine and The X-Men are just as great. Overall, I highly recommend this to fans of Superman and Batman, DC fans, Comic book enthusiasts, and anyone else looking to explore the dynamic between Superman and Batman's friendship.

3867282,4,B0027FG29Y,"The two disc version included two episodes of the Superman the Animated Series from the late 1990s. Both excellent, especially when Superman had to pretend to be Batman in ""Knight Time"" Public Enemies collection contained two long extra features, one a documentary on the psychology of Batman and Superman, and the other was a dinner conversation with the producers, directors with Kevin Conroy (voice of Batman). This second feature went on too long and eventually got tiresome. I got exhausted from the talking heads of the crew of producers and writers--they actually discuss too much. Should just watch the main feature.
  The film itself had what it would be like if Lex Luthor became President of the U.S. For awhile he is perceived as good and the army (literally) of superheroes supports and works for him. But not Superman or Batman. They become outlaws and after a long series of battles they beat Luthor and a meteor that comes to Earth. Though only 66 minutes long it felt longer than that, in fact it felt a lot longer as so much happens, so many battles agasinst an army of costumed superheroes, most of which I did not recognize. Those I did recogize include Katana, Hawkman, Bane, Mr Freeze, Powergirl, and Metallo. But there were many others. There were several who could create ice from air. They battle Metallo (a cyborg), one of the few who could kill Superman, but he ends up being killed himself and Superman is blamed by Luthor for that murder. Although it was another energy being who killed Metallo (forgot the name). One of the plot strings in the film is the murders are a frame up devised by Luthor to destroy the public image of Superman. So the film also spends time with Superman trying to recover his good name. Of course, Luthor is defeated and Batman saves the Earth and Superman saves Batman. All ideas done before elsewhere.

Not to mention, Clancy Brown returns as the voice of Lex Luthor. These three provide their talents once more to these iconic characters in ""Superman/Batman: Public Enemies,"" one of many releases under the DC Original Animated Movie line.

The plot is thus: When the United States is at its lowest, Lex Luthor steps up as the nation's savior. After being elected President of the United States, he immediately sets out to clean up the country. The only one who is reluctant to trust the new president is the Man of Steel himself. When Luthor sets up Superman for murder, he places a bounty on the head of Superman and Batman for helping him. Soon, almost every hero and villain in the DC Universe come out of the woodwork to collect the bounty. It gets worse when a meteor made of Kryptonite is heading towards Earth. So now, the World's Finest must find a way to clear their names, expose Luthor and save the Earth once more from destruction.

Based on the comic of the same name, this movie does not stray too far from the original source material. It portrays Superman, Batman and the unique friendship they have.

3867300,4,B0027FG29Y,"The premise of the film is a bit unbelievable but once you can get past that, it holds up pretty well. In this version of the DC Universe, a ""reformed"" Lex Luthor has been elected President of the United States on the promise of pulling America out of the economic doldrums.

Government scientists find, to their horror, that a massive Kryptonite meteor is heading for earth. Luthor is determined that he does not need help and that he can handle this better than anyone, even Superman. He does, however, reach out to Superman, seeking, so he claims, to bury the hatchet and to ask him to join his team of government-sponsored and paid heroes, consisting of Captain Atom, Starfire, Katana, Black Lightning, Power Girl, and Major Force. Superman declines, of course, but then realizes that the meeting is a trap, as Luthor's chauffeur turns out to be Metallo. In the ensuing battle, Batman saves Superman but both heroes are badly injured and must escape through the sewers to the Batcave.

Luthor, meanwhile, has doctored the video of their encounter, making it seem as though an out-of-control Superman has viciously attacked him. He pretends that the radiation of the approaching meteor must have had an effect on Superman and he promises an award of $1 billion to anyone who can bring him in.

Superman and Batman are out trying to work out just what's going on when they are discovered and attacked by a whole army of villains, each eager to claim the bounty. Superman and Batman take care of most of the bounty hunters (Silver Banshee, Captain Cold, Icicle, Killer Frost, Mr. Freeze, Gorilla Grodd, Bane, Black Manta, Black Spider, Brimstone, Catman, Cheetah, Copperhead, Deadshot, Kestrel, King Shark, Brutale, Despero, Giganta, Girder, Lady Shiva, Mongul, Captain Boomerang II, Nightshade, Parasite, Solomon Grundy, and Shrike), and the remaining foes are dealt with by Luthor's pet super-heroes, who then promptly turn on Superman in an effort to bring him in.

Luthor's solution for the Kryptonite meteor threat fails and an appalled Amanda Waller discovers that Lex has been mainlining a Kryptonite-based drug, which has been making him stronger but also turning him into even more of a megalomaniac than he was before. He decides that there will be no further attempt to stop the meteor and that the resulting cataclysm will allow him to take over as lord and master of a new world order.

Superman and Batman discover what Luthor is up to when they infiltrate his stronghold after further battles with other DCU heroes. They have a plan to stop the meteor but Luthor escapes and does his best to block them.

I liked the action sequences; it was nice seeing all of these heroes and villains in pitched battle. However, it's a bit hard for me to accept that Superman's fellow heroes, in particular, could be so easily manipulated, and the ending had a bit too much of the deus ex machina to suit me but overall I found this to be an entertaining story and a solid adaptation of the original graphic novel. The only other thing I disliked was that the artwork was a bit more exaggerated than most of the other animation, with ridiculous abs, an even more ridiculous Power Girl (you can guess which body part, in particular, I'm referring to), and massively built-up chests, shoulders, and backs. Once you get into the story, though, that becomes less of an issue and it didn't bother me. On balance, I have no problem recommending this.",1390608000,3,3446,4.842105263157895

3867305,2,B0027FG29Y,"You might like this if you just like seeing a plot that creates the excuse for a pack of DC heroes/villians to go up against Batman and Superman, but I was ultimately disappointed for two main reasons: the pair wins too easily, and they don't look good doing so. Batman isn't on display as the brilliant tactician he is, and Superman doesn't go over the top with his powers, as he might against this many powerful foes. I will say that the banter between Superman and Batman is great. Frankly it's hard to get that wrong when a Super Boy Scout and an Amazing Criminal Artist are having a conversation. But Batman should know better their enemies than Kal-el does--that should be the point of the team--up. Superman is an idealist; Batman is not. Superman is the muscle, Batman is the brains, and that doesn't really hold well here in this film.

I won't pick on the writing, because it's a DC story that's been done before and I see nothing wrong with re-treading good comic plots as animation, especially in the brilliant way that ""The Dark Knight Returns"" 1 and 2 did; sticking almost word for word to a Frank Miller script. With this film, the plot is fine; the details just don't suss out. My technical knowledge of animated films is limited here, but, whoever blocks the Batman (director or animator, I'm not sure) was very much at fault for this movie being disappointing. Very little thought went into the Batman's tactical skills and any display of his prowess lacks creativity. Batman knows how to beat villains with more cleverness than using grenades to collapse a roof, or to use his own lines (when grabbed by a foe) to shift his momentum towards an attacker. Batman falls down a lot in this film in which he is a lead. This lack of blocking Batman in clever ways bleeds into the animation because there are too many moments where the Batman just stops in the middle of a fight. He should be constantly on the move, predicting the next attack, never sitting still, almost fluid. To that end, be it writing or blocking or animatics, he's just not used well here. (For a great example of the way Batman's moves should be choreographed in animation, consider Cowboy Beebop's ""Asteroid Blues"". I don't know if there's rotoscoping in that scene or not, but the fight in the cafe is tight, colored well, fluid, and believable.)

More importantly, every time Batman goes through a wall or has a ton of rocks piled on him is evidence of the writers' inability to think of something more clever that he might do to avoid the injury. He's a strong guy, but he can't take getting thrown through a wall constantly. Batman's ability largely stems from his thinking, he's not invincible.  He's smart, and the movie seems to miss this point entirely.

Regardless of that aspect of the film, my real problem with this animation is the animation itself. DC's showcases and other films have attained a certain standard with regard to art and motion, and this film just doesn't live up to that standard. Somebody cut the budget. Shading and colors are not fluid when compared to The Dark Knight Returns Parts 1 and 2 or Gotham Nights or Batman/Superman Apocalypse--most DC animated pieces. There again, the blocking is at fault first; the ""castling"" maneuver in the film--meant to be a moment when Batman and Superman switch enemies--just doesn't work because the proximity is foggy and the point of the maneuver even more questionable.

This is old advice about writing good stories--show, don't tell. This movie fails on this principle often. There's such a great role for the new Japanese Toy Man here--I must have missed something in the comics in that I don't know where he came from--but I like him, and I like what he can do for the story. What I can't stand is that Luthor's head is exposed in his suit and that Superman doesn't have to pull him apart but just head butt him. Superman, in the course of this movie beats Doomsday, beats Metallo, and beats Mongol, and he's having a hard time with Lex Luthor in a robot suit? Lex Luthor has plots on plots on plots; why let it come down to a fist fight with Superman, of all people?

The problem with this animated film is two-fold: One, the two central characters have to be displayed at the top of their talents and they just aren't. They manage to survive getting hit again and again, rather than figuring out ways to keep from getting hit. The second is that there is no fluidity in the animation that reflects the heroes' talents. Superman can move at speeds you can't imagine or animate, so you need to come up with clever ways to illustrate that. Same with Batman. You have to think carefully about how he beats a foe that appears beyond his means to beat. Batman has to be the most imaginative and forward-thinking guy in the world to beat these foes. But Superman and Batman win--they always win. And as a writer, director, animator, you've got to give constant thought to how that should seem plausible (within comic book rules) and make that effort.  It's got to be surprising, maybe impossible, very clever--these are smart heroes. They're not smart in this film.",1388620800,3,5125,4.637665198237886

3867317,4,B0027FG29Y,"For people who enjoyed Batman the Animated Series and Superman the Animated Series, think of ""Public Enemies"" as a more adult/bloody version of that condensed into a movie. Bruce Timm basically has more free roam to show death, blood, and have profanity featured in the dialogue. This was apparently based on a graphic novel or comic book; either way, the end result is a very good movie with excellent performances and great writing. Kevin Conroy is probably the definitive animated Batman and he proves it again here; Tim Daly is also a great Superman like he always was in the animated series. Lex Luthor is the most ruthless, vicious, and crazy I've ever seen him to date here I must say. The superheroes that are sent to find Batman and Superman when they are outlaws are lesser known DC figures such as Captain Atom, Powergirl, Shazam, Hawkgirl etc. However, they fit perfectly into the story and are also very interesting.

The movie ""Apocalypse"" with Superman and Batman teamed up again feels like a sequel to this (I would recommend buying the 2-disc package of both movies because they feel very connected).

This is a really good movie all in all but I recommend that you buy the bundle ""Public Enemies/Apocalypse"" because ""Apocalypse"" picks up right where ""Public Enemies"" left off.",1376956800,3,1437,4.721115537848606

3867322,2,B0027FG29Y,"I am a big fan of the Justice League series (and anything with Kevin Conroy voicing Batman) and I came across this movie which I had high hopes for.  Unfortunately it wasn't nearly as good as I had anticipated.

The dialogue is poorly written and hard to overlook - it's cheesy, awkward, and sometimes seems out of character.

And the main plot isn't a smooth story that unfolds but sort of a mish-mash of villianous events that have no grace or flow to add to the story-telling.

On the positive side, I really enjoyed this type of animation and there are a fair amount of appearances from other DC characters.  There's plenty of action and the fight scenes were well done.

In my opinion, skip this movie and go watch Justice League: Doom or Batman: The Animated Series.

Also, [SPOILER ALERT] when Lex Luthor kisses Dr. Waller, I didn't know who to be more grossed out for - him or her.  Yuck.",1372464000,2,896,4.487654320987654

The story line was believable -- as long as you accept the premise of a world populated with superheroes and supervillans -- up until the very end.  The rocketship was very -- odd.

3867357,4,B0027FG29Y,"Never got long-winded, tons of action and looked great.  Oddly enough, some of the scenes suffered from some noticeable jaggies (and my screen's only 32 inches, so it was definitely noticeable).  Once the action kicks in, you don't notice it anymore, so it's all good.  The animation style for this movie was pretty unique; this didn't have the stylings of the Superman show OR the Batman animated series, which is pretty rare for the DCU movies as far as I can tell.  Batman had a very Frank Miller-esque thing going, which I definitely can dig.

This is just a really good value; you've got the feature clocking in at an hour and a half, and there's TONS of extras.  Interviews with the creators, previews for other DCU projects AND they slapped a four-part Justice League Unlimited story arc and a couple Superman episodes as well.  I paid ten dollars for this.  I would gladly pay $20.

I'm more of a Marvel fan when it comes to the actual comic books, so keep that in mind, but as someone who can follow a bit of the DC mythos, I picked up on the story relatively quickly and enjoyed it start to end.  I do get a LITTLE confused from time to time when I see things like Lex Luthor being President (not much of a spoiler; you see this about two minutes into the movie) and I'm not sure if this is considered canon, is based loosely on canon, or is considered an alternate universe episode.  Not that this keeps me from enjoying it, regardless of what it actually is.

What meager plot exists is juvenile, poorly scripted and designed merely to string together a series of disappointing action sequences.  It's obvious the writers were thinking ""Wouldn't it be cool if Batman and Superman had to fight the entire DC Universe?"".  Regrettably, that's as far as they thought things out.

Still, the insipidness of the story could be almost forgiven if the action sequences delivered.
They don't.
The fights are only adequately staged.  Additionally, the power levels of various characters are altered willy nilly to serve the plot.  Superman gets Nerfed while Batman gets a serious buff anytime the writers can't think of a way for him to save himself.

On top of the poor concept and writing, the character designs are overly cartoony, thus sapping any drama that might still be left on the screen.  The seasoned cast and the fans certainly deserved better.

Do yourself a favor, save your money.  Or, better yet, pick up a copy of Superman/Batman: Apocalypse.  Now THAT is DC animation at its finest.",1338940800,5,1153,5.010526315789473

3867372,5,B0027FG29Y,"Bought a few years ago.  Have viewed it tons of times.  Fantastic comic book movie.  Should be on every comic fan's movie shelf.

This animated movie, which is geared toward an older audience, but fine for kids, is extremely action packed.  It's a tad lean on story, but there's enough.

Voice cast is none other than Tim Daley and Kevin Convoy.  Also Lex's voice is the same as the older Superman series as well...  For comic fans, Tim and Kevin ARE Superman and Batman.  We grew up watching them, and their voices will always be fixated as the only voices for the roles.

This movie we find Lex has cleaned up his public image and for the better of this country, or it's detriment, has become U.S. President.  Superman is of course not happy with this.

**Minor Spoilers**

The big elephant in the room in this film is a meteorite hurtling toward Earth the size of Texas.  Oh...did I forget to mention it's made of pure Kryptonite!!!  Thus Superman can not fly out and smash it or at least move it.  Lex has promised to save us all, but secretly he has other plans as well.

Throw in Batman, who has to save Superman and a few others...and you have one heck of a movie.  Our heroes are really up against a wall when Lex issues a one Billion dollar bounty for them to be brought in dead or alive.  Well every villian on the planet decides to cash in on the bounty thus impeding our heroes from saving the world even further.  Did I forget to mention most superheroes work for President Luther, so our heroes have no allies.

Loved this movie, I want to go watch right now before work after typing this review up.  Buy the single disc edition though, nothing spectacular about the 2-disc edition.

3867374,4,B0027FG29Y,"The Man of Steel and the Dark Knight are in the fight for their lives in Superman/Batman: Public Enemies, the new animated adventure from the creators of Batman: The Animated Series and Justice League Unlimited. As a massive kryptonite asteroid hurdles towards Earth, US president Lex Luthor (Clancy Brown) uses the upcoming threat against Superman (Tim Daly), turning him into an outcast and placing a one billion dollar bounty on his head. Batman comes to his friend's aid and together must expose Luthor's plan and stop the asteroid from destroying all mankind. Superman/Batman: Public Enemies is a satisfying animated adventure based on the comic book series by Jeph Loeb. Though not one of the best from the DC Universe Animated Original Movies, this breezy 67-minute animated romp offers some decent amusement for fans of the series. Superman/Batman: Public Enemies also features the voice talents of Allison Mack, Xander Berkeley, John C. McGinley, Ricardo Chavira, LeVar Burton and C. C. H. Pounder.

The Blu-Ray release of Superman/Batman: Public Enemies is pretty much similar to the previous DC animated movies by Warner Brothers. The animated adventure is presented in a 1.78 widescreen presentation. It features a fine high definition transfer and a decent 5.1 Dolby Digital audio track. Its special features include two behind the scenes featurettes (Dinner with DCU and Special Guest Kevin Conroy & A Test of Minds: Superman and Batman), six episodes of Justice League Unlimited and Superman:TAS (Question Authority, Flash Point, Panic in the Sky, Divided we Fall, Demon Reborn & Knight Time), a sneak peek of Justice League: A Crisis on Two Earths and trailers of recently released DC animated movies.

I've not read the comics this is evidently based on, but it barely sustained my interest and by the end, my wife and I were spending more time making fun of Power Girl than anything else.  (Really, she is just the dimmest bulb in the chandelier here, and as usual, hampered by her ridiculous costume.  Is her super-power the ability to capture men's attention? Why not just rename her ""Boob-Girl"" and be done with it?)

While the underlying satire  regarding Lex Luthor becoming president is apt, it may be a wee bit over the top and unduly contrived. The most intriguing aspect, potentially, is not explored: the quickness with which most of the champions of justice become good little stormtroopers and ""obey orders"" without question, turning from superheroes to enablers of Luthor's totalitarianism.  Of course, most of these heroes are second-tier no-names anyway.  There is a whole lot of punching, to the detriment of plot and characterization, which grows tiresome even in a comic book movie.  A bunch of villains AND heroes seem to turn into Transformer-bots frequently.  And the story defies logic at almost every turn (even for a comic book).  Where are the bystanders in those cityscape battles?  Where are the rest of the Justice League heavy-hitters? (Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, or Zatanna could have cleaned this mess up in just a few minutes.)  The rest of the Captain Marvel family?  Why is this such a fanboy's movie?

It is a little short and more than a little tedious.  I recommend the Justice League ""Crisis""  movie much more highly, a much more engaging story and more room for the characters to flex their minds as well as their muscles.",1325808000,,1737,4.8141891891891895

The rest of the film is a roster call of every half-way cool villain hunting him down. Well, almost....

From my understanding, this is fairly close to the comics; I haven't had the pleasure of turning those specific pages. The vast enjoyment of this film comes from the friendship between Supes and the Dark Knight, each saving the other's bacon at least twice a piece.

I wish the film was longer; weighing in at a modest 67 minutes, it is the shortest of the DCU animated features to date.

Special Features are a bit weak for a BD of this caliber:a behind the scenes, a dinner with Kevin Conroy (the voice of the animated Batman since the first episode of his acclaimed and award-winning series); choice episodes brought to you by animation guru Bruce Timm, some behind the scenes for the comic event of Blackest Night and a look at the Justice League: Crisis on Two earths. The Blackest Night is my preferred feature, providing some of the things that came to pass in that epic meta-plot.

3867389,4,B0027FG29Y,"Superman/Batman: Public Enemies is the 6th feature in DC's growing line of animated movies, and adapts the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/comic-of-the-same-name/dp/1401202209/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">comic of the same name</a>, which was originally by Jeph Loeb and Ed McGuinness. When a giant kryptonite asteroid is spotted heading for Earth, President Lex Luthor uses the situation as leverage to frame Superman and post a billion-dollar bounty on his head. Now Superman and Batman must outwit Luthor and destroy the asteroid all while being hunted down by heroes and villains alike.

This is one of the smarter direct adaptations in DC's animated movie line. Unlike&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-Doomsday/dp/B000PE0G0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman: Doomsday</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Justice-League-The-New-Frontier/dp/B000PFSYO4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Justice League - The New Frontier</a>&nbsp;which both tried to cram too much story into a limited runtime with varying results, Public Enemies has just the right amount to service this kind of project. In fact, once screenplay writer Stan Berkowitz has stripped away the fat (some extraneous side plots and ties to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Infinite-Crisis/dp/1401210600/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Infinite Crisis</a>) and added a few reasonable workarounds, you're left with a pretty tightly paced adventure that clocks in well below the usual 75-minutes (the case lists the film at 67). I've read the comic multiple times and while I can appreciate Jeph Loeb trying his hand at some Grant Morrison-esque plot twists involving a time-traveling Superman, the film takes out all that convoluted goofiness and is much more accessible to the casual fan.

What you lose in the comic-to-film translation however, are Batman and Superman's narration capsules that often presented dynamic, opposing views on the same situation. To make up for this, the film tries a bit of casting shorthand by using Kevin Conroy and Tim Daly as Batman and Superman, fan favourites from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-The-Complete-Animated-Series/dp/B001CTXUTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman: The Complete Animated Series</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-The-Complete-Animated-Series/dp/B002LWJ510/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman: The Complete Animated Series</a>. Clancy Brown and CCH Pounder also reprise their roles as Lex Luthor and Amanda Waller, so where the script puts emphasis on action over character, at least you've got some familiar voices to guide you through.

And yes, this is primarily an action movie whose main function is to serve up battles with characters from all over the DC Universe. One major action set piece throws out all kinds of notable and obscure cameos to the point where you'll probably give up trying to name everyone. The animation and direction are at their best when the characters are pounding on each other, and Ed McGuinness' bulky style translates well to motion. The lack of any deep plot really isn't an issue here - whereas I found&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Green-Lantern-First-Flight/dp/B0021AENIM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Green Lantern: First Flight</a>&nbsp;somewhat lacking as it failed to explore a character that's not as well known to the general public, here Batman and Superman are pretty much who we expect them to be. The fun buddy cop banter from the comics is intact, and Public Enemies rides  safely on their interaction. One plot point did leave me a bit confused, however, and that is the resolution to a certain tag-team battle seems to lack a bit of explanation as to how it actually went down (here, the comic was equally vague).

The Special Edition offers up a few extras - the lack of commentary is disappointing, but longtime fans will enjoy the casual dinner conversation with Bruce Timm, Andrea Romano, Gregory Noveck and Kevin Conroy as they discuss the legacy of Batman: The Animated Series. Overall this is a pretty fun and solid entry for hardcore and casual fans alike, and continues the high standard of DC animation.",1295740800,6,4421,6.5763293310463125

Outstanding voice acting and animation top this off and make it a must for any fan who is more interested in being entertained than complaining about how Superman's boot was heel was red, when we all know should be cranberry on Earth 2, while Batman's belt buckle was clearly the Earth S version.

3867391,4,B0027FG29Y,"In desperate times individuals rise to power with promises for new hope and restored sanity.  People who are desperate will accept the word of a madman if they believe it will aid them in their plight.

So, it is with this fine film.  The madman in this case is Lex Luthor who is elected President of the United States and brings the superheroes into his fold, except for Superman and Batman.

It is their reluctance to unite with President Luthor which results in them being branded Public Enemies with a trumped up murder charge.  Adding to the plot is a giant slab of Krypton hurling toward the earth with an extinction countdown for the human race. President Luthor believes he can save the earth with his intellectual brilliance without Superman.

A billion dollar bounty is placed on Superman and Batman. The pantheon of super villains and heroes come gunning for them.

This is well crafted--the story is first rate and the action is like an old fashioned Saturday matinee.  PG-13 is the rating.

One tidbit: Power Girl is voiced by Allison Mack, Chloe of Smallville.  Power Girl's character is well integrated with an obvious crush on Superman. The conversation between her and President Luthor is priceless as he attempts to convince her that Superman has been adversely affected by the approaching meteor and cannot be trusted. Her inward conflict is well demonstrated, but her belief in Superman is stronger than her conflict.

This 2-Disc set has plenty of extras and previews of upcoming DC films.  There are two nifty cartoons from Superman: The Animated Series--
1) The Demon Reborn
2) Knight Time

3867392,3,B0027FG29Y,"I finally got around to seeing this movie, and let me warn you die-hard fans I have not read the graphic novel, so I'm judging this solely as a film. I'm happy to report Clancy Brown is Lex Luthor, and both Kevin Conroy and Tim Daly reprise their roles. The animation is different than what I'm used to, but I grew accustom to it. The action is, as expected, is relatively entertaining and non-stop. Powergirl, voiced by Even Allison by the way, stars in this one, and despite this being aimed at primarily kids those E cups easily stand out in any scene. If this had been live action, it would've been ridiculous yet funny, but as a DC animated short I'll let it go.

My problem with this film, as with many DC flicks, is that it is way too damn short. Even though I haven't read the graphic novel, I'm under the impression there was a lot more substance than in this 70 minute movie. This is all action, spliced with ""political intrigue"" (as the DVD boast), and Powergirl's ridiculously large breast.

3867395,4,B0027FG29Y,"In exploring this 2 DVD set, the main event is of average standard, as compared to the other Bruce Timm-fueled endeavors by DC Comics Universe.  Based on the Jeph Loeb/Ed McGuinness graphic novel (which I'm still reading), Lex Luthor becomes president of the USA.

As president he stops the incredible violence and disaster caused by extreme unemployment and economic disaster (yeah, this was in 2008 before fiction became somewhat real in 2009, but I digress).  Essentially, Lex discovers a giant meteor of kryptonite the size of Brazil is heading towards the planet.  What to do?

Having an innate hatred of superheroes he nevertheless recruits a few to help fight crime in the world.  And he helps frame Superman for the supposed murder of Metallo.  Most of the movie is about capturing Superman as a 1 billion dollar bounty is on his super head.

It's a race to destroy the meteor and as well convince the heroes that they're playing the wrong side and need to get rid of Lex before he decides that the meteor killing billions may be a good thing after all!

Pros:  Lots of great fight scenes.  The Superman / Captain Marvel smackdown is worth the price of admission!

Cons:  From what I've seen in the graphic novel, chunks of the story were not able to make it to film, which I think weakened the story a bit.  I have watched other Timm-produced DC films, and this has to be the weakest because of its predictability and average ending, rather than something exciting (in my opinion!).

Features:

The DVD was produced in 2008 and so to 2010 and beyond viewers, much of the materal gone over is old hat.  The release of Darwyn Cooke's Justice League Frontier, Batman ""anime"", Green Lantern's First Flight and a great Wonder Woman film grace this release.  If anything it helped restore my interest and excitement in the DC Universe of characters and how these guys are putting together a great stable of writers and voice actors and making these characters relevant again.  Great job!

The second DVD goes over the relationships between Batman and Superman and goes over some of my favorite scenes from a sneak peek of Justice League Crises on Two Earths (an excellent animated flick if there ever was one).  I'm still exploring this second DVD and so far it's great!

The animation and storylines with The Demon Reborn for example, rivals the main event, Public Enemies!  It's really a Superman tale, but has the bad guy Ras A-Ghul, daughter Tallia, with Batman playing the Dark Detective in an exciting yarn of American Indian magic.

The second cartoon is called Knight Time for a very good reason which I'm sure the intelligent reader can guess.  Batman is missing and Superman takes his place!  Trippy tale.  Tim Daly voice-over as Superman is superb!

Recommendations:

The set is a great intro to the DC Universe of animation that will nto only re-introduce some of these classic characters, character-driven stories more than special effects -- with some secondary characters as Captain Atom and Hawkman and some fine Power-Girl action.  Great story and animation!

3867403,1,B0027FG29Y,"Superman is an idiot and Lex Luthor is in the right in this movie. That's how bad it is.

Let me explain.

DC got so stupid that at one point someone said it was a good idea to have mastermind and supervillain Lex Luthor, bane of the DC universe, become President of the United States. Mistake number one.

Now that he is President, there's a giant meteor coming to Earth, and Lex Luthor publicly asks for Superman's help. So they agree to a meeting. Lex Luthor brings along a robot guy with a Kryptonite power source. And you know what, this makes perfect sense. The President has his Secret Service to protect him from anything that may harm him. That means people with guns who want to assassinate him, or superheroes who tend to get retarded under the pen of Jeff Loeb. So good, have your kryptonite-powered bodyguard to slow down Superman a bit.

When Superman meets up with Lex Luthor, he immediately grabs Lex and tells him he's on to him and starts acting like an idiot. It doesn't matter if you're DC Jesus, you don't tug on the President and make threats. So Superman starts feeling weary because of the kryptonite cyborg dude, and Lex runs away, there's a fight that Superman should have lost and been humiliated for and then sent to his Fortress of Solitude to think about what he's done afterward.

Superman's actions in this movie are so mind boggling that it's difficult to describe what makes them so stupid. Every step Superman takes seems to be so Jeff Loeb can show how awesome Batman is. I know this isn't the comic, but it's based off the comic, so Jeff Loeb's getting the blame. After finishing Hush and The Long Halloween, it's not undeserved.

If you want a great Superman in the DC animated universe, watch The Justice League, The Justice League: Unlimited, anything but this crap.",1287446400,2,1806,4.593167701863354
3867404,2,B0027FG29Y,"I will admit, I'm not the biggest Superman fan. I'm mainly interested in Batman and his stories, but I enjoyed the ""The Batman Superman Movie"" episodes from the animated series', so I figured I'd give this a try. I'm a 22 year old female, and I watched this with my 16 year old brother. We were maybe halfway to 3/4 of the way through this movie when we both mutually decided it was really bad, and turned it off.

A couple other reviewers have pointed out some of the flaws: Batman and Superman's attitude toward each other comes across as very peculiar. I kind of cringed at some of the early scenes and dialogue. It's just ... somewhere between too buddy/buddy, or as another reviewer said, ""awkward date."" Another issue (that I was aware of before I started the movie) is this just feels like a Superman movie with Batman thrown in with no reason. From what we watched, it seemed like Superman is the only one being framed and hunted. Batman's just sort of ... along for the ride.

My biggest issue, however, is that the movie jumps from one fight to another without pausing for even a few minutes to give us some plot. Characters are thrown at you left and right to come attack Superman and Batman, and hardly any of them are mentioned by name. We have no idea who they are before they're dispatched. (I only recognized about two.) Starfire actually is randomly added to the government team at one point in the movie (despite not being there in the beginning), but so far as I watched she never had a speaking line or was even addressed by anyone. Fights are cool, but after a while, it's just frustrating since the plot is as paper thin as, ""Superman's been framed for murder, and there's a big reward if someone catches him!""

The character designs turned me off. Overly-bulky Batman and Superman, overly busty Powergirl. The voice acting was nice, featuring many of the familiar actors to the roles. Batman's voice recalled the animated series, but frankly, I feel like it was a waste on such a bad movie.

In short, not much of a plot, way too many throwaway characters, awkward Batman/Superman interactions, bad designs, and way too many fight scenes. If you like watching Batman and Superman going around and fighting, this is for you. If you prefer some actual story and character development, I'd pass on this one and watch the older ""The Batman Superman Movie,"" or even some of the other DC DTVs.",1284681600,9,2410,4.5846867749419955

3867411,4,B0027FG29Y,"The first DC animated movie to make an impact with me since New Frontier (I love team-ups and big action sequences), Public Enemies features the World's Greatest Heroes joining forces to stop President Lex Luthor.

First off, other than the first Superman serial, Superman and the Mole Men and Superman III, who has been the featured villain in every movie? Luthor of course and while he can be an interesting character, when he's reused as a villain over and over, I grow bored with the character. It's not like Superman doesn't have other villains that can be used in a movie. It's also a shame that they never use any Batman villains when he's teamed with Superman. Yes Joker, Harley Quinn and Ra's al Ghul were villains in team-up episodes of the animated series, but in the team-up episodes (except the one with Ra's) there's always a Superman villain involved and my favoritism of Batman and his Rogue's Gallery aside, the Bat-Villains have always proved more interesting due to their psychology. Granted, I never read the Public Enemies graphic novel or the comics that featured Luthor as the President, its just one of the problems I have with the Superman movies; the overuse of one villain over others and the fact that when Batman`s teamed with the Man of Steel, the impression I'm given is that his villains aren't a big enough threat (sort of why the only villains we ever saw in JL were Superman villains). And why does everyone but Batman and Superman go to Luthor's side? They've battled each other for years and then just because he's the President, they think he's turned over a new leaf. And they automatically attack the two heroes that they've known and worked with for years just because Luthor says so? I find that pretty hard to believe, let alone a man who's had no political background, wins everybody over with pretty speeches of promised change and then gets the presidency (that sounds so familiar doesn't it, if only this movie had been released around late 2007-early 2008). On the other hand, the thrill I get when I see heroes team up was satisfied. Even seeing the other heroes and all the villains was enough to satisfy my tastes. But at 67 minutes (the second shortest movie I own next to Dumbo at 64 minutes), it feels rushed and with all of the action sequences, there's barely enough time to catch my breath.

I'm a little divided on my feelings on the animation. On one hand, everyone looks different than what we've seen in previously, which I like since most of these movies are adaptations of comics with different art styles. We also get many heroes and villains making their animated debut like Power Girl, Major Force, Lady Shiva, Icicle, etc. Though I have two problems with the animation; first off, why is Amanda Waller so fat? I know in JLU she wasn't that skinny but in this she looks as big as a whale. I've never read any of her  appearances in the comics so JLU is the only reference I have to go by, but was she a bigger woman in her original appearances? Also why do all the males have six pack abs? I know they work out (Batman especially) but not in any comic I've read have the males been bulging out of their costumes.

A DCAU voice reunion as we get Kevin Conroy, Tim Daly, Clancy Brown AND CCH Pounder reprising their roles. Heck even Jennifer Hale has a small speaking role as Killer Frost! All still make their characters believable and its always to hear them voicing their iconic characters again. My only problem with the voicing is that, while I know not every character gets to speak, why they go through the trouble of promoting LeVar Burton as Black Lightning (going so far as to feature him in the preview feature on First Flight and getting an interview at The World's Finest) and the guy has one line of dialog! He's featured more than Hawkman and Captain Marvel and those two get much more to say than him (Hawkman's actor doesn't even get credited)!",1280102400,6,3925,4.602857142857143
3867412,4,B0027FG29Y,I love Superman since I was younger than 10 years old. Superman/Batman: Public Enemies I love it because it also have Powergirl with your big Breasts and other super characters that I did not know and some that I haven't seen in a long time. What I don't understand is why Batman is in it for the only reason for Batman is probably for Batman fans? Superman is the real public enemy not Batman so what is up with that? I recommend Superman/Batman: Public Enemies. I love you Superman! Hopefully Superman/Batman: Apocalypse will be as good or better.,1277337600,,549,4.612244897959184
3867413,4,B0027FG29Y,"Straight up No Spoilers!!!! The film was very good, the story line is very harsh in tone and finally we get to see just how powerful Superman is suppose to be...Batman & Superman are the Best Superhero team ever...Period..In any comic book in the Universe and this Cartoon did the heros greatness justice....My Only complaint is that the movie is waay to short and they could have added in some more of the top heroes....But you'll see what I mean...",1276560000,,450,4.6375
3867414,3,B0027FG29Y,"Since its about an hour or so, the characters aren't too developed.  The story line seems rushed.  It also seems to have been simplified to appeal to a broader range of audience, for newbies to kids.  You are better off purchasing the Justice League Complete Series DVD.",1274572800,2,270,4.702127659574468
3867415,3,B0027FG29Y,"The way I measure a movie's success is by how much I want to watch it again. I watched Watchmen five times in the first month of owning it, on the other hand, Superman/Batman: Public Enemies I've watch twice in the entire time I've owned it.

Lex Luthor is president, and a giant meteor made out of Kryptonite is headed for Earth. While ""trying to work with Superman,"" and I use that very loosely, Lex frames Superman for murder, and declares him and his ally, Batman, public enemies. The reward money Luthor offers has wave after wave of supervillains coming after them, and a few well intentioned superheroes searching for the Dark Knight and Man of Steel. While it all leads to a fairly entertaining climax, it's basically one big slugfest.

Part of what hurt the film from my point of view was the hype made about the voice cast. Sure Kevin Conroy, Tim Daly, and Clancy Brown all bring their normal brand of excellence to the voices they played in Superman and Batman the Animated series. But, for instance, I remember they made such a big deal about LeVar Burton playing Black Lightning, and he has ONE LINE in the entire film. Plus a handful of stars playing other bit parts. So, in the end, you have all these heroes and villains, and they have nothing to work with, because it's only a 72 minute film.

I must admit I haven't read the source material, Superman/Batman: Public Enemies by Jeph Loeb and Ed McGuiness, but from the few glimpses I've had, they do make a good attempt to replicate McGuiness' ""rippling muscles"" art style. And more than likely, the book was a slightly more complex slugfest. But whatever they cut, and I have heard stuff was cut, has left the plot pretty thin.

Extras on the two disk include, ""Behind the Scenes of Blackest Night"" DC's major summer event focusing on Green Lantern. A short Documentary ""A Test of Minds: Superman and Batman,"" it's fairly informative, especially for those viewers who don't understand the dynamic between the two heroes. And ""Dinner with DCU, with Special Guest Kevin Conroy"" where most of the team behind the film, and the other DC Animated series, converse over dinner about +10 years in animation. If you're the type of fan that likes to know the behind the scenes stuff, this is one conversation worth overhearing.

Finally, a look at Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths, and two episodes from Superman the Animated Series. The Demon Reborn, where Rah's Al Ghul tries to kill Superman, and Knight Time, where Superman impersonates Batman.

It's an okay film, but I say rent it first.",1273449600,8,2556,4.694196428571429
3867416,4,B0027FG29Y,Like a comic you don't have to read. Its a little short for a movie but gets the job done. I like how they put so many supers and villians in with out getting off the subject. Be careful if you have kids under 10 because there is some profanity and blood and of course violence.,1271635200,2,278,3.982142857142857

3867418,3,B0027FG29Y,"While I definitely enjoyed this movie to an extent, I thought it could have been done a little bit better. I thought the animation was decent (although, I did find the pointy facial shadows irritating). The voice-acting was as good as could be expected. As for the storyline, it's fairly straight-forward and is a good excuse to pit Supes and Batman against a whole slew of DC characters, both good and evil. The interactions between Superman and Batman were also enjoyable and done fairly well.

I definitely enjoyed a lot of the cameo appearances throughout the movie. I would have enjoyed a few of the more ""epic match-up"" battles to have lasted a bit longer. I found the ending to be a bit hokey, but considering that we're talking about a movie that is filled with super-heroes with fantastic abilities, I guess I don't really have the right to complain.

All-in-all, I'd recommend the movie to any comic fans or anybody who grew up watching the SuperFriends on Saturday mornings. It's a fun and sometimes mindless distraction, if nothing else.",1269648000,,1049,4.822222222222222
3867419,5,B0027FG29Y,"Apparently no one told the creators of this movie that :P.  It is too good.  Anytime you can get Kevin Conroy (Batman), Tim Daly (Superman), and Clancy Brown(Lex Luthor) together in the same show/film/etc, you know it's going to be great.  I didn't actually read the graphic novel this is based on so I actually went into it ""blindly"".  What I got was a totally entertaining experience that can't be match easily.  It was nice that Amanda Waller (voiced by CC Pounder) was included here as well because she was a personal fave of mine as a character although they way they drew her here was grotesque.  But it didn't take away from the overall product, especially because of these two words.....Power Girl (or is that one word?)",1269216000,,728,4.6484375

No seriously, it's like 40 straight minutes of nothing but punch punch punch and then the next wave of bad guys shows up and punch punch punch.  The end.  That's literally it.  Yawn.",1268697600,,347,4.516129032258065
3867422,2,B0027FG29Y,"Superman/Batman: Public Enemies is a disappointment, nowhere as good as some of the other DC Comics animated films like Superman/Doomsday or the Green Lantern or Wonder Woman films.  The confused plot has Lex Luthor elected President in a time of economic unease.  It is apparent quickly that Lex is unqualifed for his new job (sort of like our current President.)  Add to the fact that an enormous kryptonite asteroid is heading for earth (ala ""Armageddon."") and you've got problems.  First Lex sets up Superman in a confrontation with his number one secret service man (Metallo) and then deputizes several other super heroes like Captain Atom and Power Girl to arrest Supes.  This fails and we then get a surprisingly nasty Hawkman and Captain Marvel to go after Superman.  Finally there is a small subplot about Gorilla Grodd using mental telepathy to get some other fairly second-rate villains to do his bidding.  However by this time I really didn't care and began dozing off during parts of this surprisingly short (67 minute) film.  This film is basically about Superman and Batman gets the lesser role.  The ending is sort of a confused mess with President Luthor going nuts and donning his green and pink super-villain suit.  (There isn't much ""hope"" that Luthor will be a good President although he does ""change"" into his good old super-villain flying suit.)
I did not like the way Superman was drawn in this film, he had sort of a thuggish look to him.  Lois Lane appears fleetingly in the last minute of the film, she does not utter one word.  There is no Jimmy Olson or Perry White.
At least the voices are from the great Batman and Superman cartoons: Tim Daly as Supes, Kevin Conroy as Batman and Clancy Brown as Luthor.  (I understand on the latest DC Comics animated release, they replaced Kevin Conroy as Batman with Billy Baldwin.  Give me a break.)
The special features include a psychologist discussing the psychology of Superman and Batman.  There is also a rather strange luncheon discussion between Andrea Romano, the preson in charge of voices on these animated films, Bruce Timm, the producer of these films, someone else from DC Comics (whose name escapes me, sorry) and the voice of Batman himself, Kevin Conroy.  The most interesting thing about this is watching what they order for dessert. (Miss Romano has a nice cappucino, the guy from DC Comics drinks tea. I'm not sure what Kevin and Bruce drink.  They all have very delicious looking cakes and pastries. They look quite good and made me hungry.)  Two very good ""Adventures of Superman"" cartoons are also included.
As stated, I've enjoyed many of the DC Comics animated films.  I think ""Batman-The Animated Series"" is the greatest series of cartoons ever done.  However this film was basically silly, it did have a lot of action but it was basically a mediocre mess.",1268611200,,2850,4.849173553719008
3867423,2,B0027FG29Y,"This was a real disappointment. The quality of the animation is frequently jerky, artistically lower than Saturday morning fare and miles behind last year's Gotham Knight. There's no reason to spend the money on a Blu-Ray for something with so little detail. Bodies are blocky and distorted, faces are expressionless.

The voice acting isn't much better, with the exception of the always excellent Clancy Brown. Batman and Superman deliver their lines in virtual monotones that are barely distinguishable from each other. Dialogue is laughable, and the story isn't much better. The action sequences, while serviceable, don't rise to the level that they can redeem the movie's other flaws. If you're a fan of Superman or Batman, avoid this.",1268265600,,739,5.262711864406779
3867424,4,B0027FG29Y,"Based on the DC Comics graphic novel of the same name, the animated direct-to-DVD adventure ""Superman/Batman: Public Enemies"" posits a world where Lex Luthor takes advantage of this and that national crisis to get elected president, and then at the first opportunity (of course) manipulates events to make Superman Public Enemy Number One.  Being Superman's pal, Batman is soon in the crosshairs, as well.

This is an intense, entertaining hour-plus story with lots of cameos by DC's heroes and rogues gallery, all trying to capture Superman either because of misguided loyalty to President Luthor or because they want to collect Luthor's billion dollar bounty on Superman's head.  A sequence with longtime Superman foe Metallo trying to take down the Man of Steel is very effective and obviously owes a lot to ""The Terminator"".

I bought the two-disc edition of this animated film, because I generally enjoy the extra features put together for the deluxe editions of these films.  This particular two-disc set was no exception, as it included a decent twenty-something minute history of the various Superman/Batman team-ups in the comics (complete with psychological profiles of both heroes); and a fun conversation over dinner between Producer Bruce Timm, voice actor Kevin Conroy (who voices Batman in this film and countless other animated productions) and casting director Andrea Romano.

Though ""Superman/Batman: Public Enemies"" is a tad heavy on fights and action for my taste, I realize that this fact will actually be a plus for many viewers.  But whether you have quibbles or not, I think most viewers will consider such things exactly that: quibbles.  Because, in the end, this package delivers a more-than-decent story and more-than-decent craftsmanship, along with many engaging extra features.

3867427,5,B0027FG29Y,"OK...there IS NO VOICE OF BATMAN other than Kevin Conroy as far as I am concerned and he is in full effect on this dvd! Clancy Brown as well as Tim Daly are top-notch as usual. The other full-length movies just aren't worth a flip without the three of these guys behind the voices.
The plot is above average. Starts out with Lex being elected President and everyone (except old Supes and Bats) believes that Lex has seen the light and is now righteous and on the side of good. Supes is framed for killing a bad guy and a bounty is placed on his head by Lex. Meanwhile, a hunk of kryptonite the size of a state is hurling towards the planet and threatens to destroy humankind. End with Lex showing his true colors for the whole world to see. Didn't anyone see THAT coming?!?! And oh, yeah, the planet (thank goodness) is saved. Yeah!
Now I had to check the back of the box afterwards because I didn't realize the movie was PG-13. There were about 3 or 4 curse words thrown around for effect (h---,b----, d---); and a mention about the size of Powergirl's upward assets. Just a warning for those of you who have kids. The animation is good...a bit more stark and more defined than the Fox and WB series. Wish  it could have been longer. Worth a watch!",1267142400,,1249,4.337606837606837
3867428,5,B0027FG29Y,"By far, this is the best DC Universe animated movie that's been released up to this point.  It doesn't bog down the viewer with an origin story or ""meet and greets.""  Instead, it jumps right into the action, assuming that the DC superheroes have co-existed for awhile and know one another.

Lex Luthor has become president and has many superheroes in his employ.  Batman and Superman (rightfully) suspect something is up and try to figure out what it is, thereby becoming ""public enemies.""

Not knowing what to expect, I was very pleasantly surprised to see many lesser known heroes make appearances in the movie even if they didn't really say much (Starfire) or were slightly different (e.g., much more timid) from their comic book personalities (Power Girl).

The movie was short (just over an hour), but very concise.  It held my interest the entire time.  I hope DC continues the tradition of providing this type of animated movie that take place within the existing DC Universe for those of us already ""in the know.""  SUPERMAN/BATMAN: PUBLIC ENEMIES is definitely a keeper on DVD for me.",1266796800,,1092,4.859459459459459
3867429,5,B0027FG29Y,"I've followed BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES from the start. Bruce Timm, a co-creator of the series definitely had an eye for the look and feel of how a Batman cartoon should really be, and this cartoon just never really went on the cheap with dialogue or animation. While not being a huge fan of the Superman character, I generally avoided SUPERMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES, but the episodes I saw, I did enjoy. The animated film offerings they provided were excellent too, like BATMAN: MASK OF THE PHANTASM, or BATMAN: SUB-ZERO. Then came BATMAN BEYOND, which was an excellent 'Elseworlds'-style tale of the Batman of the future. They really took it to a dark place when they did their next film, BATMAN BEYOND: RETURN OF THE JOKER, which was an animated film so dark, they released a G-Rated version and a PG-13 version (The PG-13 version is better, by the way...) But when DC decided to really up the ante and create JUSTICE LEAGUE and JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED, they went to a place that they hadn't been before. Great story arcs, great chemistry between the heroes and villains, and massive battle royales. Unfortunately that series was cut way too short. Then DC started focusing on new Direct-to-DVD animated projects, and while they haven't been as successful as some of their previous efforts in animation, they were certainly watchable. SUPERMAN: DOOMSDAY was passable, but since that story bothered me anyway, I wasn't that into it going in. JUSTICE LEAGUE: THE NEW FRONTIER was a really good adaptation of Darwyn Cooke's new classic graphic novel. BATMAN: GOTHAM KNIGHT, while ambitious, was a bit of a misstep by making us believe that this is what happened between the big-screen outings of Batman. WONDER WOMAN was the best of the lot. It was really a joy to watch. GREEN LANTERN: FIRST FLIGHT left me incredibly cold. It's much too epic of an origin to tell in such a short time-span.

And now comes SUPERMAN/BATMAN: PUBLIC ENEMIES. Now, first off, I am so not a fan of Jeph Loeb. I think his writing work is incredibly overrated. However, I did enjoy this story arc of the SUPERMAN/BATMAN comic.

That being said, I have to give HUGE kudos to Timm and the team that adapted this work for this project. They jettisoned some of the more embarrassing moments and streamlined it and made it near-perfection. The writing, directing and animation are all top-notch.

And let's give a major shout-out to longtime DC Animation voice director Andrea Romano, who had the foresight to give us the original voices of these characters dating back to the original BATMAN series. Kevin Conroy as Batman, Tim Daly as Superman and Clancy Brown as Lex Luthor. These voices are the holy trinity of the DC Animation 'Verse and to have them together again is just a wonder. There has not been another voice actor who has been able to capture these characters as well as these three performers.

The best thing about this project, aside from the massive battle royales that it gives us, is that it gives a spotlight to the chemistry between these two titans and what makes their relationship work. Is there a bit of bromance between Batman and Superman? You bet. They are each other's reminders of what is right and what is necessary. Neither of them envy the other's life, but they understand that when they are together, they may very well be at their best whether they'll ever admit it or not.

This is the most entertaining of the DCU animated films and I hope they keep up this level of entertainment.",1266019200,4,3494,4.759075907590759

Well, this is the most beautiful American animation I've ever seen. The colors are so vibrant, it's like the cartoonists are coloring the scenes as you watch it. The flow isn't choppy & it looks like the damn movie was made yesterday. Kevin Conroy voices Batman, which is also super-cool.

SPOILER! The only issue I had with this was the way Superman/Batman saved the earth from the meteor; a big robot that goes into space to break the meteor up? I mean, seriously? I know it's a cartoon, but surely they could've come up w/something better. There are also some that would say that this movie isn't true to the comics. I'm not aware of this storyline in the comics, but if you take this movie for what it's worth, then surely the viewer can oversee that point. Another good thing is that there are some episodes from The Justice League Unlimited on the disc. I might go buy the series now.

The storyline was interesting and entertaining, although a bit rushed.  I think they definitely could have made it a bit longer.  There was a good dynamic set up between Batman and Superman that you don't usually get to see.  You really get the sense that even though they have their differences, they really do care about each other, almost like brothers.  The action sequences are really fun to watch.  Not only are our favorite heroes up against Lex Luthor but they go toe to toe with an entire rogues gallery of villains and even some other heroes.  They're literally fighting back to back, which is awesome to see.

The voice actors were stellar, as always.  I am so glad the went with their ""stock"" players instead of looking for new voice talent.  I've said it before and I'll say it again, Kevin Conroy is one of my favorite people to listen to.  Tim Daly and Clancy Brown aren't too shabby, either.

As for the animation, it was good but seemed a little weird in places.  Some of the characters just didn't look right.  Superman's face seemed odd at certain angles and Amanda Waller just looked like a toad, or something.  I'm not sure what they were going for but it didn't work, visually, for me.

All of the special features on Disc 1 are related to previous WB/DC releases, so nothing new there.  Fortunately, on Disc 2, we get three new featurettes.  The first discusses the psychology and relationship of Batman and Superman.  I thought this was pretty interesting.  I really enjoyed the ""Dinner with DCU and Special Guest Kevin Conroy"" feature, although it's not technically a dinner.  They just have dessert but it was fun to watch.

3867434,5,B0027FG29Y,"""Superman/Batman: Public Enemies"" is the best DC Animated release yet. It's fantastic! I read the graphic novel and liked it, but the movie blew me away! Everything good about the comic version was retained, and the parts that didn't make any sense (especially the ending) were rewritten, resulting in a much more fluid, action-packed adventure. Unlike the book, you don't have to know any of the DC Comics continuity to enjoy the story- it's completely self-contained, and also unlike the book, the ending does not depend heavily on viewers' prior affection for a character they may or may not be familiar with. Nods are given to the DC Animated Universe, which were fun for a DCAU buff like me, but the story is not dependant on them, and in fact, is completely separate from the DCAU continuity.

Fellow fans of the DCAU will be happy to see Kevin Conroy, Tim Daly, and Clancy Brown reprising their roles (Batman, Superman, and Lex Luthor, respectively), and for those who have not heard these three talents at work...well, you're in for a treat! Tim Daly's portrayal of Superman is smooth and natural, the blending of power and vulnerability perfectly balanced in every syllable. Clancy Brown gives his very best Lex Luthor performance to date, effortlessly navigating the character's gradual descent from cold, calculating evil into crazed, ego-driven madness. And Kevin Conroy...all I can say is, he is THE definitive Batman. After performing this role continuously for 17 years in the DCAU, his grasp of the character is simply flawless. You will not find a better Batman anywhere, period. If you've never heard him before, be warned: from now on, whenever you read Batman comics or books, you WILL hear his voice in your head. Guaranteed.

All in all, ""Superman/Batman: Public Enemies"" is a must-see. It doesn't matter if you like the DC Animated Universe, the comics, both, or neither. It doesn't really matter if you're even a Superman or Batman fan. With an intriguing story and awesome performances of terrific characters, this movie is entertaining for all. Enjoy!",1261785600,,2077,5.017391304347826
3867435,5,B0027FG29Y,"I really enjoyed this movie. I wasn't quite sure looking at the cover animation and not seeing the familar cartoon images but I was pleasantly surprised. Same voices and stunningly clear and sharp images. The story is Lex becomes President in a US that is very similar to the US of today. So of course being President is all about him and he concocts some scheme to put Superman and Batman into the position of wanted men, outlaws needing to be arrested. This comradery of Superman and Batman has EVERYTHING thrown at them and the kitchen sink. They are great together for they are really battling for their lives and eventually the life of the planet ( Earth, not the Daily Planet). There is no moral battles between the two only real unity and watching each others back, its Great!!!
  It is a very well done fast paced drag down battle royal with some great humor thrown in too. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. BTW I watched it in Blu Ray so visually that really impressed me. GOD bless JB",1259884800,,998,4.389189189189189
3867436,2,B0027FG29Y,"The movie is indeed a faithful adaptation of the mediocre comics story that inspired it. Like that story, it's misogynistic, feels the audience doesn't needs to build an investment in the main characters, and plays solely to the most die-hard of fans.

There ARE some very cool ideas here, yes, but as a movie it doesn't work.

While the movie is by no means as gratuitously violent as Superman/Doomsday or the recent Green Lantern: First Flight, I felt there were lines and scenes that may be a bit heady for kids. While I hate a movie that panders to wary parents or talks down to kids, this simply felt a bit too dark and violent for kids. And, although I can't recall the specifics any longer, there were a couple of lines that surprised me in the same regard.

The voice work is beautiful, bringing back the best voice actors who ever brought these heroes, and the evil Lex, to life, but that does nothing to make up for a threadbare story that has some twists which, ultimately, make little sense.

Stick to the Batman: The Animated Series, Superman, and Justice League cartoons (I can also recommend Batman Beyond and the current Batman: Brave and the Bold series if that's come out yet) -- they're much sharper, more kid-friendly, better animated, and ultimately just better cartoons.

The ""bonus"" materials are more about promoting further products than giving consumers and fans something interesting to see.",1259798400,,1418,4.795081967213115
3867437,5,B0027FG29Y,"Power Girl beeeewbs! (""ahem"") The superhero version of Lethal Weapon flies off in its own movie. Long time amigos Supes and Bats have partnered up in their own comic before titled World's Finest, but over the last few years they've had a different comic called Superman/Batman. The series started out with a story arc where our caped cohorts team up to stop the newly-elected President Lex Luthor from framing them while an asteroid is threatening to destroy the Earth. That became the basis for this superhero slugfest!

Lex Luthor wins the presidency despite how many people know he's a supervillain, and cons a couple of random heroes to work for him lead by Captain Atom. He then learns that an oncoming asteroid made of pure Kryptonite is gonna crash into the planet via Armageddon. Lex tries to convince Superman to stop it, although he turns it into an attempt to kill him with Metallo. Batman rescues him and escapes to the Batcave. Luthor then reports on live TV that Superman killed Metallo, and puts a billion smackers on his head. While trying to solve the mystery of what really happened to Metallo, B&S run across about half the villains in town trying to get their bounty, only to be rescued by Captain Atom and his Luthor-run hero crew. Captain Atom tries to arrest our heroes, but Batman & Superman make off with Power Girl, when Batman realizes it was the villain/hero Major Force who offed Metallo. They then make their way to Luthor's secret crib where they clash with Captain Marvel and Hawkman, but manage to trick Luthor into revealing his plan to letting the asteroid destroy all the life on Earth. Apparently, LL has been taking Kryptonite enimas to make himself deadly to Superman, but it's been making him crazy-as-hell. The World's Finest then scoot to Japan to get help from the young inventor/billionaire Toyman(not the evil one)who builds a giant Composite-Superman rocket-robot to stop the asteroid. However, Luthor shows up in a tacky armored-suit to fight Superman while Bats flies the rocket and blows up the asteroid with no nasty effects to the Earth's atmosphere. Luthor is then kicked out of office by his former superhero hit squad, and Superman is cleared of murder charges.

This movie took a different turn as far as the character designs than the regular DC Universe animated projects had. Instead of the generic style that we're accustomed to from Batman: The Animated Series and Justice League Unlimited, it stuck more to the look that Edward McGuinness' artwork had in the Superman/Batman comic. There is a huge cast of random villains and heroes showing up in it, most notably: Starfire, Black Lightning, Katana, Mongul, Solomon Grundy, Killer Frost, and Grodd, even though you'll need to keep a score card for the list of villains that appear in rumble during the middle. The animation is no exception to the other great production value that was put into Green Lantern: First Flight. Again, my only real complaint is like all the DC Universe movies is that its too short. In fact, its about ten minutes shorter than most of the previous ones. Anyway, this is by far the best best ""buddy cop"" in capes movie ever!",1259625600,,3162,4.842883548983364
3867438,5,B0027FG29Y,"Public Enemies was a reasonable close adaptation of the graphic novel.  The artwork evoked the feel of the comic book, and the dialouge was straight out of the book in a lot of important places (Best byplay/accuracy: check out the scene where Superman is shot and Batman is trying to get the Kryponite out of him quickly.  No spoilers here)
And getting the actors who did Batman, Superman, and Luthor to return to the roles from the TV series added to the fun, experience tells after all.
Now the only issue is that future DCU movies will not likely use actors who have popularized the characters from the TV shows for these DVDs and after Having Conroy, Daly, and Brown it may be a little disapointing.  DC - take a cue from your competation.
Hugh Jackman is now Wolverine, Robert Downey is Iron Man, etc.  Too late for the Crisis on two Eaths DVD I know(and the preview for that was fun), but future DVDs can use actors that have made these characters familiar to our ears.",1258934400,9,975,4.491525423728813
3867439,2,B0027FG29Y,"I had high high expectations for Superman/Batman: Public Enemies when I ordered it from Amazon earlier this month. The previous Bat-film in the DC animated collection Gotham Knight was a fairly impressive series of adult-oriented vignettes. This is basically an extended Saturday morning cartoon. If that is what they were going for, why bother to include the very brief ""crude comments"" which warranted it receiving a pg-13 rating? It seems as if DC was hemming and hawing over whether to make it for kids or adults.

Batman and Superman's actions are often strangely homoerotic, they keep being placed into situations which require hand-holding and manly grunting. In addition, what was probably intended to be friendly banter seems like (as one reviewer already pointed out) awkward first-date conversation. The score is bland and vanilla, and the animation blocky. Perhaps I am a bit biased, as I find most Bats/Sups team-ups suck, because the Superman cast is invariably the one most utilized. Batman's rogues and allies are far more interesting, and far less lame.

On the plus side, there are a few nice touches in the fight sequences (Batman vs Lady Shiva was pretty bad-ass), the few crude comments that were in there were fairly humorous, and Power Girl looked drop-dead sexy. Not a complete waste of money to watch with your child, or if you are a diehard who collects everything Bat or Supes related. Rent it though, don't waste $15 on 67 minutes of mediocrity.

P.S. (SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The very end of the film is unintentionally hilarious as it seems like Superman is asking Batman out on a date. The Dark Knight declines, leaving Superman to make out with Lois. One can't help but think Supes is thinking of his pointy-eared companion while he lip-locks with his female sweetie.)",1258416000,,1802,5.040268456375839
3867440,4,B0027FG29Y,"Superman/Batman: Public Enemies is a really nice presentation of the graphic novel in animated format. While we don't get to see as much action as in the comic itself, we do get the meat of things and still get to see some of the great matchups between these two heroes and their cohorts.

Taking off with the election of Lex Luthor to the Presidency, things quickly progress to Lex taking advantage of his position to turn public animosity against his hated nemesis Superman. With a dire threat looming over the entire Earth, he instead chooses to pursue his personal vendetta. Batman is caught in the crossfire, never branded with the same label that Superman receives, but certainly unwilling to bend a knee before Luthor in pursuit of the obviously innocent Superman.

The two heroes seek to save the Earth even while facing the opposition from cadres of villains after the reward for Superman and from well-meaning heroes deluded into following the letter of the law rather than its spirit. We get to enjoy the great Kevin Conroy as Batman's voice once again, along with Clancy Brown and Tim Daly reprising their roles as Luthor and Superman from the Superman Animated Series.

The second disc actually presents some nice special features. There is a good if typical feature on how they brought this graphic novel to the screen, along with an after-dinner gathering of creators and Conroy discussing the evolution of things from the early days of Batman the Animated Series through this film. There is also a nice preview of the Crisis on Two Earths movie that will be released next year, though why it has William Baldwin instead of Conroy as Batman is beyond me.

While I think they could have made a better single disc version by putting the specials from Disc 2 on Disc 1 in place of the rehashed features it has, the movie is worth getting. If you want to see the features, you'll need to get the two-disc set, since disc 1 has only features that have already appeared on other movies in this series.",1258243200,2,2010,4.717948717948718

But it's a cartoon movie where there are so few good ones nowadays (i.e. Superman/Doomsday GAG!), so I took a chance. This movie rocks! I cant say enough good things. First off they had all the voices from the series of the respective icons back for the show. I'm sorry but no one does a better voice over for Batman then Kevin Conroy, a better Superman then Tim Daly, or better Luthor then Clancy Brown. It's like the voice to Optimus Prime you just have to have THE guy that makes that character come alive. Secondly, the story was good, I mean making Batman/Superman bad guys?! How's that work? And i think for American animation it's quite good. I mean I love me some Anime and there's very few shows on this side of the pond to even hold a candle to that kind of detail but this works well mainly because of the animated series both of these characters had. You're just used to seeming them like this. Overall the only bad thing I could say about this show is there's only one of them! They need to get the exact same cast, writers, etc and do more! Enjoy!",1257984000,,1183,4.262222222222222
3867442,3,B0027FG29Y,"This was fun to watch, but I wanted something else.  I have the graphic novel and was ready for something closer to it.  But, alas it was not to be.

For a feature presentation based on the two biggest stars in the DC Universe, it was strange that the film only lasted about an hour.  Come on DC, these are your big guns!  Give them their due.

I was a little annoyed by the way the plot was handled.  Characters were under used and story lines were trimmed.  Although I absolutely love Allison Mack as Chloe on Smallville, her Power Girl was silly.  This definitely needed more back story to feel right.  Also, most people wouldn't know who Captain Atom is and this version makes him look like a smuck.  I get that he is the epitomy of the good soldier and always follows his orders patriotically.  But its never explained why he would think Superman is an outlaw when everyone knows all the good Superman has done and all the bad Luthor has done.  History is completely tossed on the trash heap with no explanation whatsoever.

Worst of all, I had a huge problem with one big plot hole.  *Spoilery tidbits coming* When Luthor frames Superman for Metallo's demise, Supes looks towards Bats and says ""You can't possibly believe this, you were with me the whole time.""  Now, technically, Batman wasn't.  But, they WERE together when we (and they) last see Metallo alive. Why Batman so quickly questions Superman's integrity makes no sense?  I understand the dynamics of their relationship, but, for whatever reason, that just bothered me.

On a side note, I did like what I thought was a nod to the old Composite Superman character from the 1960's (timewise I think).  You'll know what I mean towards the end of the movie, if you are familiar with the character.

Even though I'm critical, I would say this is an above average movie.  Voice acting of the main three is top-notch.  I'll leave all the discussion about animation and the like to others.  If you want to pass the time with some familiar heroes, you could do a lot worse than this.  But if you have read the graphic novel, you probably won't like it as much.",1257724800,2,2119,4.527704485488127

Interesting is the veiled political commentary from the comic when Luthor becomes president.  It took place during and parallel's many people's reaction to Bush's reelection there/then, it is slightly updated in the film however to be more modern and be less of a political statement and more of a true story arc.

3867447,5,B0027FG29Y,"First I'd like to say that the only problem I had with this film was that it was too short. It's only an hour. Now with that being said I'll talk about how awesome the film was.

I have always been a fan of team-ups. Whenever Batman was on the Superman series, I would scream with glee (literally). So for these two to have a film together was ah-mazing. These two kicked major butt in this film, and most of it was against their ""comrades"" which was interesting. Starfire made a guest appearance, which I thought was awesome, because I think this is the first time we've seen a grown Starfire in animation. Becasue I the only one I'm aware of is on Teen Titans and the name says it all. PowerGirl has somewhat of a major role.

WARNING: This film isn;t exactly for the younger generation. When they said PG-13, they meant it. From the opening with the newsanchor to the point when Luthor calls that woman a b----, it's really for the older set. So I'd be careful about letting younger children watch this. Other than that, it's an awesome movie, they say that a second one is in the works. Hoepfully that'll rock too.",1256774400,,1118,4.396135265700483

The animation was good and the voice work was excellent,but you didn't have to be a rocket scientist to go where the plot was going and how it would end. Considering the number of heroes and villians shown on screen,the absence of Flash,Wonder Woman,Green Lantern and Green Arrow was rather odd in my view. I did enjoyed the extras,particularly the discussion between Kevin Conroy,Greg Norvek(?)and Andrea Romano over dinner.

The story tells the story of Batman and Superman's friendship when they are marked as enemies of the president. The story is rich with good use of the characters and their new roles under Luthor, this is not your usual good vs evil story like you would see in the other DC cartoon series. Being that this not your usual cartoon series there are a few scenes that parents would use discretion for the kids.
I am pleased that they brought back Kevin Conroy who voiced Batman the Animated series, Justice League, Batman Gothom Knight and Batman Arkum Asylum. No Batman movie or video game is complete without Kevin Conroy voicing Batman.

3867454,3,B0027FG29Y,"This movie, unfortunately, is *NOT* the comic come to life.  It really is only based on the story.  They cut out a lot in favor of a short run time (cheap) and mindless action (why's the fight with Metallo got to go on forever?).  What's worse is they left in all the boring parts and cut out all of my favorite lines!  ""Your butler guards your cave with a shotgun?""  ""You always think we can take them.""  Hawkman explaining about the Amulet of Horus, and how he just hit Superman with the planet.  ""Since when does Hawkman pick a lock?  Why don't you just smash it open with your mace?"" ""I'm not Hawkman.""  In fact, there were really only two memorable quotes from the book retained in the movie: 1) Between Batman and Superman lying in the grave, 2) Toyman commenting on Power Girl's... assets.
Beyond the loss of clever spoken word, there is an even greater loss when translating this comic to film.  The real theme of Superman/Batman the comic is that we get to see each main character through the other's eyes.  This movie has no internal dialogue, so the heart of the comic is ripped out and forgotten.  It's only mentioned by Superman when he says that Batman was his best friend, and even then it just feels forced.
On the plus side, I love that it stars Kevin Conroy, Tim Daly, Clancy Brown, and C.C.H. Pounder reprising their roles in the DC animated universe.  On the downside, there are new and drastically different voices for Captain Marvel, Metallo, Captain Atom, Gorilla Grodd, heck, even Alfred (I seriously doubt Efrem Zimbalist Jr. was too busy).  So the classic voices clashing with new voices made things a little off-putting.  Of course, if you aren't already obsessed with the DCAU, you wouldn't even know the difference.  Obviously the vocal performances from the primary actors were the best of their careers, but the new voices just sounded generic.  The animation style is very much like the drawings from the comics and is actually preferable to the typical DCAU drawings, even if every character's torso starts to look the same after a while.  The title sequences and score all throughout the movie were amazing, I can't say enough about them.
All in all, this movie was entertaining and , but I really think it deserved to be better.  And I think the fans deserved that, too.",1255910400,3,2305,4.646913580246913

3867457,3,B0027FG29Y,"When I fist saw the trailer for S/B: Public Enemies, two things came to mind. It wasn't the fact that Tim Daly would reprise his voice role as Clark or that the true voice of Bruce would feature Kevin Conroy. It wasn't the fact DC Comics deemed it fit to take a pretty good graphic novel and strip it down to fill a TV screen. No, it was the simple fact - and keep in mind I'm about to utter thoughts that most fan-boys would not otherwise speak - but we'd finally get to see the bountiful Power Girl in action!
  From the first side-profile shot to the point where she hinted how uncomfortable she was around the 13-year old, hormone charged Toy-Man (preferably named, Hiro) - it became evident the creators may have had a bit too much fun putting her assets in animated action form. Don't kid yourself, you know it's comical - you know it's funny - you know that her endowments have been, and pardon the pun, poked at by every artist and writer out there. Plus there are many more lined up to do the same.
  That's too bad.
  The above dither about endowments and sexual pot-shots is meant to be in jest. Kara's injection into the comic storyline, as well as the animated feature is justified - she's a powerful agent for good. Her crisis of conscience is a key component of the story, where heroes not only battle a full gallery of baddies, but also other heroes, causing some to question their own loyalties - it's a very powerful concept which comes across in the animated feature quite nicely.  I just don't think it was necessary for the story-board artists to make Power Girl appear so stereotypically top heavy.
  All in all, the DVD main feature is well done. Yes, if you expect the DVD to run along-side the comic, you're in for a fall. Yes, the special features continue to be a disappointment, although the `Dinner w/ Kevin Conroy' piece was different, you find out why Andrea Romano is a voice director - she talks and talks and talks - ugh! The pimping of the comic story known as `Darkest Night' continues to air - not sure who promoted Geoff Johns as the second coming - whatever!

What's the sense of a DVD if there is not a motion DVD menu, chapters and extra stuff? I'm not talking about previews of other movies. Maybe an isolated soundtrack would be nice. The DVD box is getting thinner and cheaper. We might as well purchase this on itunes. When I buy a DVD or a CD, I want the media to be taken advantage of to the max. He-Man: Master of the Universe is an excellent example of what I'm talking about. This is packaged beautifully. Also, why is this made in 2:35:1 aspect ratio when it's a direct-to-DVD movie? I mean, this movie is wider than my widescreen tv so there is a black space above and below. I hate that. Go back to the 1:78:1 ratio as before. Why not package the movie with the CD soundtrack and charge a little more?
I don't have a blu-ray player yet but I hope DC Comics takes advantage of this technology when it comes to menus, etc. If not, what a waste of money. I still love the dirct-to-DVD movies their making but I think it's best to purchase it on itunes on Amazon video instead for the DVD format.",1255219200,,1178,4.216814159292035

I was very hopeful that this moview would restore some of the lost sheen of the DC animated features, since the end of the fantastic Justice League Unlimited series. It was close but unfortunately no cigar - not quite.

I've found the direct to video movies to be just so-so. New Frontier was a nice companion to the comic but couldn't stand on its own. Wonder Woman featured nice animation but terrible voice casting which made her sound more like a texas belle than an ancient Greek Princess and the characterization was way way off. Green Lantern was OK, but totally unexciting and the design was kind of ugly. Superman-Doomsday was just poor. It didn't help that similar plots with all these characters have been done in the animated Justice League series with far superior results (IMO).

This time the folks at Warner animation really tried to get everything right. They picked a fa favorite story with lots of action and broad appeal - not a great story but one that can appeal to a mass audience who are not heavily into comics etc. They mimicked the designs of the orginal comic artists with reasonable success. And most importantly they went back to the most popular voice talents for the casting of the key characters: Kevin Conroy as Batman, Clancy Brown as Luthor and Tim Daly as Superma. You really can't go wrong with this cast. Not only are they very talented but the've been doing the voices of these characters for years, and they know them to a T. The fact that a lot of fans will find the voices familiar should also help.

Still the result left me feeling ""if only""... It could have been so much better! The cast get the parts just right but the whole thing comes across like an unimaginative carbon copy of the comic. The point of an adaptation is to improve the original and adapt it to your medium. In this case they try to stay faithful, fail and also fail to create something new and compelling. Let me get specific:

The script is wooden and dull, having thrown out several great parts of the comic which contrasted the characters of Superman and Batman. Most of these were thoughts and bits of covnersation that brought the characters to life, but they happened in ""quiet"" moments. Since the movie aims for action, the quiet moments have been cut.

What's left is an hour long slugfest with a who's who of the heroes and villains in the DC universe - not bad but not nearly as exciting as it sounds. Especially when we've seen it all before. Superman vs. Captain Atom and Captain Marvel? Check. Luthor turning the world against our heroes - check. Amanda Waller turning against him - check. Lots of villains after Superman and Batman check.
And it was much much better in Justice League - I mean much much better. More tension, more drama, more exciting and better design on the animation.

That brings me to the design. The animation tries to mimic the style of comic artist Ed McGuinness, to stay faithful to the original. But why? Warner animation has some of the hottest talents around (arguably better than McGuinness) and they are much better at doing their own designs - you get the best of their creativity when you let them do their own thing rather than tell them to imitate someone. The original DCU animated series' design style evolved constantly, starting with Batman Adventures, then Superman Adventures, then Justice League, then Justice League Unlimited. By now it would have reached new heights but the artists instead try to be someone else instead.

So what's good? The whole package is still a pleasant movie especially if you haven't seen anything else byt he same studio so you're not comparing it. But it's still not great.
I wonder why they don't just get it through their heads that they had the best and most popular animated universe which went strong for  over a decade for a reason - it had the best talent, pushing their creativity with great guidance from people like Bruce Timm and Alan Burnet and it evolved constantly by trying to do something new.

Don't get me wrong - this isn't a bad movie. It's just disappointing when you know what the caliber of the talent working on it can do.
If they came up a with new animated movies based on the established animated DC universe, I bet it would be great and it would keep getting better. Instead we keep getting one animated feature after another that faintly echoes what we know is possible.

3867462,3,B0027FG29Y,"Superman / Batman: Public Enemies is a fan boys dream come true. This straight-to-DVD flick has everything a comic book fan could ever want. DC has thrown everything AND the kitchen sink into this project. The action never lets up.

DC definitely put together a really impressive list of creative minds to create this truly stellar animated film. Director Sam Liu comes with a resume that includes the upcoming Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths, Hulk Vs., The Batman series, Max Steel series, Roughnecks: The Starship Troopers Chronicles, Godzilla: The Series, and Extreme Ghostbusters. Then add Stan Berkowitz (Transformers: Animated, Legion of Super Heroes, The Batman, Justice League: The New Frontier, Superman: The Animated Series, Spider-Man) to script the film from the original graphic novel, written by Jeph Loeb (Batman: The Long Halloween, Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America, Hulk, Superman / Batman) and drawn by Ed McGuiness (Deadpool, Vampirella, Wolverine, Superman / Batman) and you've got a great combination.

They also spared no expense when it came to actors they chose to do the voices. You've got animated Batman veteran Kevin Conroy, who has voiced the caped crusader in pretty much every incarnation of the character since 1992 (except The Batman and Batman: The Brave and the Bold). Superman is again voiced by Tim Daly, who has done the job since 1996 in the original animated series, the movies, and video games. Clancy Brown also returns to the role of Lex Luthor, who he has voiced the arch nemesis since the animated series in 1996. The film also features a multitude of well-known actors voicing other characters as well - LeVar Burton (Star Trek: The Next Generation), Michael Dorn (Star Trek: The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine), Tony Todd (Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Candyman, The Rock, Star Trek, 24: Redemption), Hector Elizondo (Monk, Justice League, Avatar: The Last Airbender), Jerry O'Connell (Sliders, Scream 2, Jerry Maguire, Stand By Me), and Robert Patrick (Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Alien Trespass, The X-Files, Fire in the Sky). This impressive list of talent leads me to my next point as to why this is every geek's favorite new animated movie. It has so many cameos from different heroes and villains that it had my head spinning at times. You've got Captain Marvel, Captain Atom, Hawkman, Bane, Solomon Grundy, Lex Luthor, Mr. Freeze, Metallo, Power Girl (voiced by Allison Mack of Smallville), and several more.

One thing that is noticeable right off the bat is that this is not the typical animation these movies usually have. It really looks like they were trying to get away from the style of Justice League, Batman, Superman, and Batman Beyond, so they could try something new. It's kind of awkward feeling at first, but after a few minutes you get used to the new style and move on to just enjoy this visually.

I really don't know how they could have made this better. Maybe a bit stronger story and a little longer run time, but I kind of like the short get-to-the point animated features the best. There really is nothing left to want for. I mean, they even have a giant robot made in Japan that is half Batman and half Superman. You read it right - a giant Superman / Batman robot. Oh, and I also failed to mention the giant chunk of Kryptonite that is heading for the Earth. What story with Superman involved would be complete without the green stuff?",1255046400,2,3435,4.917241379310345
3867463,4,B0027FG29Y,"I would be lying if I said that I wasn't eagerly awaiting the release of Superman Batman Public Enemies Animated Original Movie since having first heard of it nearly a year ago.  In what has been a very busy year for the DC Universe/Warner Premier (this being the third release thus far), I had the absolute highest of expectations going in to the film.  I'm very pleased to report that the production met and exceeded my expectations on every conceivable level but before I get ahead of myself, let's talk a bit about the two-disc Special Edition from which my review has been derived.

The movie itself resides upon the first DVD and comes in at a runtime of 67 minutes.  In addition to the feature presentation, the first disc contains a fairly in depth look at four other DC Universe Animated Movies (Blackest Night, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern First Flight & Justice League The New Frontier).  Notably missing from this release is a full-length commentary track with the film's production team and/or vocal talent, a rarity for this type of movie (Wonder Woman had two of them after all).

The second disc is where some of the really cool special features hide, including a segment, which contrasts and compares the mindsets of the two leading characters, Batman and Superman.  This piece is quite interesting as it explores the unlikely duo's ever-evolving relationship and provides alarmingly simple yet accurate associations (such as Superman being essentially based from the fireman model of modern society whereas Batman is fundamentally the cop who's seen it all).  This segment is followed by a simple but fun feature entitled ""Dinner with DCU"".  In it Kevin Conroy (the voice of Batman) joins Andrea Romano, Bruce Timm, and Gregory Noveck for desert and drinks at a restaurant with the camera documenting the conversation.  It's probably the closest any of us are going to get to dining out with this ensemble and definitely worth a viewing.

The next special could certainly have been the paramount moment of the entire second disc for me on account of the fact that it looks ahead to the DCAU's next ambitious undertaking, which just so happens to be based upon my all time beloved franchise, The Justice League.  The next animated feature film will be titled ""Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths"" and will apparently play around with the concept of the multiverse and the Justice League's eventual entanglement with their inherent opposites: The Crime Syndicate.

Last but certainly not least are two bonus cartoons as selected by none other than Bruce Timm himself, this time two selections from Superman The Animated Series that featured crossover appearances from the Dark Knight (The Demon Reborn & Knight Time).

The robust extra features are worth the price of admission, but it's the feature film you've come to read about so let me waste no more time with technicalities.  For those who don't know, Public Enemies is the animated adaptation of the graphic novel of the same name by Jeph Loeb and Ed McGuinness.  The premise is fairly straightforward and while I'll do my best to avoid spoilers in the following summary, it may be wise to skip ahead if you have yet to see the movie.

The film, like the novel, literally opens with an intense look at the contemporary United States in the thralls of an all-out economic depression.  Amidst the looting, vandalism and plight of the inner city's residents, the shocking realization that none other than Lex Luthor resides as Commander in Chief is made known.  It turns out that Luthor had managed to buy his way into the Oval Office and rather than devote his governing power to improving the sad state of economic affairs, reveals that he has been busy assembling a task force of superheroes to govern over the remaining heroes who have yet to embrace his new regime.

Amidst this development, another far more dangerous revelation is made known that a radioactive chunk of the planet Krypton is apparently on a collision course with planet Earth.  Once made aware (by former CADMUS leader, Amanda Waller) that full-scale annihilation of the planet's inhabitants would leave nobody for Luthor to reside over, his priorities shift to doing all he can to avoid the calamity.

Disguised as genuine concern for Superman, Lex sets up a little impromptu meeting with the Man of Steel to discuss possible implications should his efforts to intercept the meteor fail.  Long story short, the meeting serves as an opportunity to frame Superman for the murder of one very Terminator-like Metallo.

When addressing the nation concerning these matters, Lex offers a billion dollar bounty on Superman's head.  Suddenly appearing public enemy number 1 to the entire globe, Superman finds himself on the run with help coming in the form of a wonderfully moody Batman.

Again, I do not wish to give too many key plot moments away so let's just say that the bounty motivates several DC Universe villains to make an appearance in effort to take down Supes.  Among them: Silver Banshee, Captain Cold, Icicle, Killer Frost, Mr. Freeze, Gorilla Grodd, Bane, Black Manta, Black Spider, Brimstone, Catman, Cheetah, Copperhead, Deadshot, Despero, Giganta, King Shark, Lady Shiva, Mongul, Nightshade, and Solomon Grundy.  As if all of this weren't enough, Lex's own newly appointed Superhero taskforce (Captain Atom, Starfire, Katana, Black Lightning, Power Girl, Major Force and Captain Marvel) are also attempting to bring Superman in on a Federal warrant.

The core of the story is essentially dual fold.  In the foreground you have a complete reversal of logic with a fledging superhero duo running from the law in a nation being controlled by none other than Lex Luthor.  This part of the tale, when taken at face value, is a roller-coaster ride of lightening-fast pacing, ultra cool hero/villain melees, and witty dialog as a direct result of the chemistry between the two lead characters.  Casual fans and action junkies will absolutely delight in this element as the plot never bogs down or takes itself too seriously.

Hidden beneath the surface is a second layer of depth that hardcore fans of either the DC Animated Universe or DC Comic threads will appreciate.  Among these are use of Amanda Waller in a sort of reprise/ evolution of her influence in the whole Task Force X thread, Power Girl's unmistakable, um endowments, and an homage to the old Superfriends days in Luthor donning his Power Suit to level the playing field between he and Superman.

It is within this second story element that we are given a bit of classic comic flare through Lex's rise to power to achieve sinister motives, Superman's struggle of attempting to clear his good name to a misguided and judgmental public, and Bruce Wayne's jaded view of society working for him in terms of the greater good.

The artwork is just fantastic throughout with character models derived directly from the graphic novel (rather than the animated incarnations).  This means some really welcomed detail in areas such as Superman's face and a Batman's suit.

Throughout most of the film, I was convinced that the fluid plot structure, beautiful pacing, stellar vocal work and charming visuals were enough to grant this a coveted 5-star score and it very nearly happened.  Believe it or not, my half star deduction comes from a few plot points that I never fully meshed with even in the graphic novel source material.  The first of these is the fact that we are shown stable wormhole generator technology for our spacecraft to instantaneously traverse the void of space.  A very cool premise for sure but one that poses the question, ""Why not simply create a wormhole to swallow up the meteor itself?""  Instantly transporting it to another point in the galaxy would be perhaps the most logical method of eliminating the threat.

My second complaint, which actually coincides with the first, would have to be the tool that is finally called into action to eliminate the radioactive chunk of krypton: A giant rocket designed by Hiro Okamura (Toyman) in the shape of a massive Superman/ Batman hybrid.  The odd and unexplained switch of Toyman from villain to hero notwithstanding, the rocket comes off as one of those corny visuals that will draw criticism from non-comic fan viewers who happen to walk into the room at that particular scene.

In all though, such complaints are minor when compared to the marvelously fun thrill-ride that is Public Enemies.  The quality is truly top-notch especially when you stop to consider the sheer quantity of material the DC Animated Universe has been churning out of late.  Fully satisfied with this piece, all that's left to wonder is how long until Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths comes out?",1254960000,,8753,4.9555403556771545
3867464,4,B0027FG29Y,"Now a week ago I got caught up in a discussion about DCU's dvd's being better than Marvel's. DC in my opinion is still top dog in this arena and DC Comics as a whole is still red-hot right now. Someone who reviewed Supes/Bats:Public Enemies said the pacing was a little too fast and that person is right. It did seem to move rather fast and got to the point basically. There was really no further explanation for the countless enemies fighting the ""World's Finest"" except that Luthor puts a billion dollar bounty out on their heads. My favorite part of this feature was with the Toyman and the robot he built in honor of his two favorite heroes. So this movie felt so much like a Justice League episode. That's not a bad thing because I miss the Justice League series,I really do! And the animation is not bad either. The characters are drawn in the Jeph Loeb style as seen in the Superman/Batman comic. So it makes perfect sense. This is the animated version of that world which is set aside from regular DCU continuity. A ""stand alone"" DC comic book series. Public Enemies also shows that Batman is willing or crazy enough to sacrifice EVERYTHING to save the world and what he loves. Also a cool treat is the roundtable dinner with Kevin Conroy(Batman)Bruce Timm(co-creator of Batman Animated Series),Andrea Romano voice director(who I have tons of respect for)and the guy who deals with DC's public image and affairs with the fans. Conroy shares a funny story about visiting a foster home dressed up as Batman. He drove his Volvo stationwagon in the costume to see those kids. How can you not show love to the guy that redefined who Batman is in the 90's? These have got to be the most interesting people in the animation and DC Comics world. Oh yeah the preview for Crisis On Two Earths was awesome. James Woods will be Owlman the head of the Crime Syndicate which includes Ultraman,an evil Green Lantern,a reverse Flash and a few others. So overall,a four-star is an appropriate rating just for two faults in the details. Too fast and not long enough. It's just so great to have Tim Daly,Kevin Conroy and Clancy Brown together on this one. A special moment in DC animation indeed. And a moment that will last forever in the hearts of true DC fans.",1254960000,,2252,4.576732673267327
3867465,5,B0027FG29Y,"This is my review which can also be seen on my website [...]

This is my first Blu-ray rental from Netflix since getting my PS3 this past weekend. It seems like we have been getting alot of these animated movies based off DC characters in the last few months, and that is not a bad thing at all. This past weekend I watched the Green Lantern movie, and I have the Wonderwoman movie in my queue as well, but this review is for a very special movie that focuses on two of the greatest comic book heroes ever, Superman and Batman.

  This movie takes place during a time when Lex Luthor is President of the United States, Lex has brought the country out of an economic depression and has created a force of superheroes to work for him consisting of Power Girl, Major Force, Captain Atom, Katana, Starfire, and Black Lightning. This team tries to recruit Superman, but he does not trust Lex and feels he is up to something more sinister. At the same time all this is going on we also discover a meteor made of Kryptonite is headed towards Earth and Lex publicly asks for Superman's help, this of course is a trap that ends up with Superman fighting Metallo. Metallo is winning this fight until Batman comes to the rescue. After the two make there escape underground to the Batcave Lex announces the death of Metallo to the rest of the country and twists things around to frame Superman, he then places a $1 billion bounty on Superman's head  claiming the Meteor made of Kryptonite is affecting his mind. This sets up the rest of the movie that has Superman and Batman facing off against villins and heroes alike to get to the truth of Metallo's death and find a way to stop the meteor from reaching earth.

  With great animation, lots of action, and a great voice cast including Allison Mack(Chloe of Smallville fame) voicing Power Girl, Tim Daly reprising his role as the voice of Superman, and Kevin Conroy as Bruce Wayne/Batman this is at the very least worth a rental, if not a buy. I am giving this movie a 5 out of 5 and if you have enjoyed any of the previous works such as Green Lantern First Flight I highly recommend it to you.",1254873600,,2134,4.412213740458015

3867468,3,B0027FG29Y,"Superman/Batman: Public Enemies is a direct-to-dvd animated movie produced by Bruce Timm and directed by Sam Liu for Warner's Animated movies line that gave us ""Wonder Woman"", ""Justice League New Frontier"" and ""Gotham Knight"". It is the 6th in the DCU animated line and is based on the opening story-arc in the Superman/Batman comic book series written by Jeph Loeb and illustrated by Ed McGuinness. It is a faithful adaptation with minor alterations in its storyline, and it has the feel of that Bruce Timm animated movie.

After a major economic collapse and a rise in crime, Lex Luthor (voiced by Clancy Brown) is elected president of the United States. In the beginning, Luthor had revitalized the U.S. economy and has won the approval of the general public including several heroes like Captain Atom (Xander Berkeley) and even Power Girl (Allison Mack). Superman (voiced by Tim Daly) and Batman (Kevin Conroy) aren't convinced and when a gigantic kryptonite meteor threatens to destroy the Earth, Luthor shows his true colors as he frames the man of steel. Superman becomes a wanted fugitive for killing reformed criminal Metallo (John McGinley). Now the two World's Finest heroes must avoid capture, being hunted by friends and foes alike while trying to find a way to stop the kryptonite meteor from destroying civilization....

It is amazing how director Sam Liu managed to fit almost all the characters from the original stories. This adaptation by Stan Berkowitz may have disposed of the assault on Wayne Manor, the alternate Superman doesn't show up and while it does sidestep some of the excess meat of a developed story from the comics, it does have some redeeming factors such as the credible appearance of Metallo. The script takes most of the elements from the comic series and makes it his own, juggling and rearranging them to fit the direction. I am not exactly a fan of Loeb's writing, and I have to admit that Berkowitz does manage to generate certain energy as well as effective homage in the movie's proceedings.

I've mentioned that the movie has more characters than you can count and while this may be a good thing, it also opens quite a large number of gaping holes. Captain Atom, Black Lightning, Starfire and company appear and disappear on their own accord, it just felt too convenient to have them have a beat down with Batman and Superman; then they disappear later in the screenplay when the two heroes encounter Capt. Marvel (of course, aside from Wonder Woman, he's the only one who can go toe-to-toe with Supes) and Hawkman. I also found that certain things in the 79 minute runtime feel a little too rushed, the fact that the general public was convinced that Superman went bad lacked development and credibility. Ok, Luthor offering a Billion dollar bounty for the heads of Superman and Batman is also a little too unbelievable.

Despite the flaws in the script, they do manage to get the ball rolling as we see Superman and Batman fight almost all the ""big name"" DC villains such as Mongul, Solomon Grundy (he may be the most inconsistent villain in DC), Grodd, Silver Banshee, Doctors Frost and Freeze, Giganta and many more. If you want to see Superman and Batman fighting against incredible odds, then you will not be disappointed. The fight with Metallo was arguably the best and the struggles with the heroes a close second; I was a little disappointed that the beat down between Capt. Marvel and Superman didn't last very long. Truth be told, the action and fights were good and exciting, but never for one minute did I doubt what the outcome would be. The film does feel like a summarized version of several Justice League episodes; this isn't a bad thing but the Justice League/JLUnlimited series just does what ""Public Enemies"" do much, much better.

I would like to commend the script for the reason that Superman and Batman do feel like they're close friends. I loved the dialogue exchanges between the two, they make quips about marriage and how Bats dislikes being flown. There are also some humorous interplay between the two and I was pleased as to how good the dialogue went from the comics to the movie. Hell, Alfred (Alan Oppenheimer) even makes an appearance and there are even some jokes about Power Girl's luscious ""bod"". ""Public Enemies"" does manage to sell the ""buddy"" and humorous angles pretty well.

The animation is also pretty good but looks a little different from the usual outings of the DCU animated line. It looked very inspired by the art of McGuinness, and I was a little puzzled as to how Superman looked a little too young at times. The atmosphere and feel of the movie does still have that Bruce Timm signature and this is almost certain to please his fans. While I am not exactly impressed with the designs and some of its aspects, the movements are smooth and fluid enough with its style of animation matching the energy and tone the movie is trying to exude.

""Public Enemies"" is pretty entertaining but the scope that it aspires to, just leaves this Bruce Timm production a little overreaching. It does manage to give some exciting scenes of action but I guess the threat of the meteor and the bounty feels a little too routine and underdeveloped to hinder our heroes. I just didn't feel any sense of unpredictability or thrills while I was watching the movie. It just doesn't give off that high-stakes or the world is in peril impact on its narrative. Maybe it's because I read the comic but I don't think so; despite some attempts at some PG-13 blood, the movie just didn't feel as intense or more compelling than I thought it should've been.

I am a comic book geek, but not a DC animated cartoon geek. I have seen the best the DCU animated line has to offer and this movie is found wanting. To its credit, it does provide decent entertainment for the whole family. However, it is not in the same `LEAGUE"" (get what I'm saying?) as the other outings in the DCU animated Universe.

But, to me, the clear-cut standard bearer so far has been&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Justice-League-The-New-Frontier-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000PFSYO4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Justice League - The New Frontier (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, and this one, SUPERMAN/BATMAN: PUBLIC ENEMIES, ain't no NEW FRONTIER. But I like it okay. It didn't suck my will to live like two past DC animated movies did (I'm looking at you, SUPERMAN: DOOMSDAY and BRAINIAC ATTACKS, and I don't care that BRAINIAC ATTACKS isn't from this same line of DC animation).

SUPERMAN/BATMAN: PUBLIC ENEMIES is based heavily on the first arc in Jeph Loeb and Ed McGuinness's SUPERMAN/BATMAN comic book, and it's worth noting that the in-the-toilet state of our economy has become so pressing and pervasive that it's even crept into DC's animated world. Things are so desperate that it's allowed Lex Luthor to make a bid for the American presidency - and he wins the damn office! So I note the colossal Luthor statue parked in front of the White House, and I snicker and think, ""Yeah, that's about right."" Under Luthor's regime, the crime rate plummets, there's a boost in the economy, and, according to Power Girl, ""there are no wars or anything."" So now Luthor has cachet with his constituency. Only Superman remains the outspoken skeptic.

But we know Lex is still dirtier than used toilet paper on chili night. Or, put another way, here's a quote from President Luthor: ""God bless America. God bless ME!"" And he still fosters his hate-on for the Big Blue Boy Scout. When a huge kryptonite meteorite is discovered hurtling towards Earth, Luthor takes the occasion to claim that the meteorite's proximity is addling Superman's mind, rendering him a danger to everyone. And, when someone on Luthor's security staff is murdered, it's pinned on the Man of Steel. The President declares Superman an enemy of the state and places a billion dollar bounty on his head.

If you like playing that ""Spot the guest metahuman"" game, then step on up, because it's not too long at all before all sorts of metahuman creeps set their sights on collecting. Casual fans may have trouble picking out semi-obscure folks like Silver Banshee, Killer Frost, Nightshade, or Lady Shiva from the mob. But, for hardcore comic book Joes, this is really fun stuff. And if the bad guys aren't enough, Luthor also deploys his own personal metahuman squad consisting of Capt. Atom, Black Lightning, Power Girl, Katana, Starfire and the ever unstable Major Force. Luckily, Superman's got Batman by his side. If you have to go on the lam with somebody, then who better than with the Bat, who may not be warm and fuzzy or jokey or fun but he'll damn well keep you breathing. The Dark Knight also comes in handy when there's a murder mystery, although even I solved that one easily enough.

Like I said, I liked this one okay. The movie feels like one extended brawl, so maybe it's a good thing the flick only runs 67 minutes long. PUBLIC ENEMIES is very much action-centric, with the more contemplative moments serving to set us up for the next spate of assswhuppin'. Despite the amount of fighty fights, the violence is actually more cartoony and is milder than that in, say,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wonder-Woman-2009-Two-Disc-Special-Edition-Digital-Copy/dp/B001LK8SQ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wonder Woman 2009 (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy)</a>&nbsp;(an early decapitation scene) or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Green-Lantern-First-Flight-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0021AENIM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Green Lantern: First Flight (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;(alien getting punched thru with a power ring blast) or SUPERMAN: DOOMSDAY (where I kicked in my DVD player). Superman and Batman may be the featured hombres, but this movie showcases a gang of characters from the DCU. To make things credible, there are enough bad guy big-hitters going for the bounty that I never got the sense that Superman could've just taken everyone out by himself easy-peasy. Supes faces off against Solomon Grundy, Captains Atom and Marvel, Metallo and Major Force, and each of these cats has got the power level to give the Kryptonian a good fight. I did wonder, though, what the alien warlord Mongul and also Despero (I think I saw him in the background) were doing in the mix. Bounty hunting seems so very beneath them. Forewarned, I kept my eyes peeled for Darkseid and the Anti-Monitor (but they didn't show up).

A little aside: There's some irony in having members of the Secret Six show up here and attacking Bats and Supes, since the Secret Six themselves have just survived having sizable bounties put on their own heads and having a $#!+load of villains trying to take them out.

The movie sticks fairly closely to Jeph Loeb's original plot, and I'm sorta happy that story beats like the Japanese Toyman and his composite Batman/Superman rocket and that bit of Captain Marvel/Hawkman trickeration made it onscreen. As an old school dude, I even got a nostalgic whiff when Lex's retro green and purple battle suit popped up. Tying even more into Loeb's story, the animation attempts to replicate artist Ed McGuinness's style, which means that all the metahumans are rippling with crazy bulging, over-defined muscles. I can see how this style may not be to everyone's tastes; it took me a little while to make up my mind that I liked the graphics. I feel kind of bad for Amanda Waller, who here receives the Jabba the Hut treatment. It's all kinds of disturbing to see Lex Luthor plant a wet one on her.

Oh, and plot hole wise, do I really buy Lex Luthor, a genius of a supervillain, grossly neglecting to factor in the meteorite's radiation levels in his missiles deployment? No, I don't buy it.

This movie also re-establishes Superman and Batman's BFF status, to which I'm kinda lukewarm. I preferred it when they were at odds and mistrustful of each other. It's a more interesting dynamic. Being a fan of Bruce Timm's DCAU stuff, I was salivating at a cast which reunites Tim Daly, Clancy Brown, and Kevin Conroy (who is my favorite voice actor, closely followed by Mark Hamill). As expected, the voice performances are flawless. And if you're looking for another Superman connection, Alison Mack (of SMALLVILLE) voices Power Girl. If you're a dude, you'll agree that Power Girl has on one of the best costumes ever, and, yes, dammit, I'm referring to the booby window.

What I gots is the 2-DVD version. Disc 1 has the widescreen feature presentation, but the special features on this disc are recycled stuff. If you've checked out the prior DC Universe animated films, do these sound familiar? A spotlight on the Blackest Night comic book mega-event, and behind-the-scene looks at recent DC animated original films JUSTICE LEAGUE: THE NEW FRONTIER, GREEN LANTERN: FIRST FLIGHT; BATMAN: GOTHAM KNIGHT, and WONDER WOMAN. There are also trailers for GREEN LANTERN: FIRST FLIGHT, the TV sci-fi show FRINGE, and the BATMAN: ARKHAM ASYLUM video game.

Ah, but we get new bonus stuff on Disc 2: ""A Test of Minds: Superman & Batman"" - a really interesting feature which digs into the psychology behind ""the psycho and the guy with the savior complex"" (18:57 minutes); ""Dinner with DCU and Special Guest Kevin Conroy"" (26 minutes long) - Kevin Conroy noshes and chews the fat with DCU animation big wigs Bruce Timm & Andrea Romano and Gregory Noveck (SVP Creative Affairs, DC Comics); an exclusive sneak peek at the much anticipated (by me, anyway) next animated film JUSTICE LEAGUE CRISIS ON TWO EARTHS, in which the JLA goes up against their evil parallel Earth counterparts called the Crime Syndicate (11:09 minutes). The animation on this sucker looks very promising...

There are also two nifty bonus cartoons included from SUPERMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES: ""The Demon Reborn"" & ""Knight Time."" ""The Demon Reborn"" has Supes running into Ra's al Ghul, and so can Bats be far behind? In ""Knight Time"" the Dark Knight goes missing and, to protect Gotham City, Superman puts on the Bat costume. ""Knight Time"" happens to be one of the best and funniest episodes from SUPERMAN: TAS. It also treats us to a terrific Brainiac zinger directed at Batman: ""You're every bit the detective that your followers on the Internet believe."" Heh.",1254614400,4,8501,5.215959004392387
3867470,4,B0027FG29Y,"Much excitement was abuzz when it was announced that Tim Daly, Kevin Conroy, and Clancy Brown, would reprise their patented roles of Superman, Batman, and Lex Luthor in ""Superman/Batman: Public Enemies"".  Though Conroy and Brown had continued providing the voices in subsequent ""Justice League"" incarnations, Daly had not done his duties since the cancellation of the Superman series.

Unfortunately, having these revered talents on board with a script that didn't give them much of any value to say was a travesty.  The storyline involved an attempt by President Lex Luther to discredit Superman, hiding the fact that the bald villain planned to eradicate much of humanity in his warped quest to build a new world in his image.

The animation, a stark departure from recent DC direct-to-DVD releases, is somewhat stilted and the ""look"" of the principal characters takes some getting used to.  Superman looks like Killer Bane pumped up, recurring character Amanda Waller (again voiced by CCH Pounder) resembles Spiderman foe The Kingpin, and Lex has never looked so badly.  Only Batman, in cape and cowl, is passable.

Powergirl, voiced by ""Smallville's"" Allison Mack, is a little ""top-heavy"" in the upper torso department, almost laughable.

The character's movements are not as fluid as in earlier films and the ""palettes"" of the movie are much too garish and bright.

The addition on the DVD of producer Bruce Timm's favorites ""Demon Reborn"" and ""Knight Time,"" two installments from the animated Superman show, reveal the inadequacies of ""Public Enemies"".  In those two installments, the writing is crisp, the dialogue more engaging, and the voice work is superb, both featuring performances from the regulars, as well as guest voices Henry Silva, the late Roddy McDowall, John Glover, Paul Williams, Olivia Hussey, and David Warner.

Other extras, many of which serve as ""commercials"" for other Warner animated projects, are well-made and informative. Chief among these is the ""peek"" at next year's ""Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths"".

3867471,2,B0027FG29Y,"Am I the only one who is annoyed that DC is churning out these movies with just enough adult content that I can't show it to my Kid. I've been in love with superheroes since I first learned to read (way back in the Bronze Age) and although I understand why regular monthly books are targeted at a late 20's audience, I can't figure out why DC is doing this with thier direct to DVD films. The Batman/ Superman Adventures and the JLU cartoons followed a perfect formula...I could get my geek-on and my kid could fall in love with the same characters I grew up loving. So why add just enough boorish and childish ""Adult"" content that the cartoons only have the narrower appeal? Who needs to hear a hero say ""damnit"" or actually watch Sinestro torture someone? These qualities have ALWAYS been succesfully implied to older audience members without explicitly being portrayed in a manner that will chase most 5 or 6 year olds out of the room.

Yay for Wolverine and the X-Men, Yay for Spectacular Spider-Man, and BOO for DC direct! I've been a huge fan of Bruce Tim for two decades now, but he should be embarrassed to have his name on this stuff.",1254528000,3,1143,4.4688995215311005

3867473,4,B0027FG29Y,"I am always excited when a new Bruce Timm project is on the way. Whenever a new one is released on DVD the first thing I do after I watch the feature is watch the preview for the next one. When `Green Lantern: First Flight' was released I could not wait to see what `Superman/Batman: Public Enemies' was all about. I will be brief I pre-ordered the movie exactly one day after I saw the preview.

I am always excited to see a Superman and Batman crossover because there is such a great lineage of stories when these two heavy hitters collide. They are so similar and yet so different at the same time and sometimes you don't even know if they are pals or want to kill each other. The premise of Public Enemies is a pretty easy to follow story. Pulled right from the Joef Loeb story, Lex Luthor manages to become president when the world is pretty much in chaos. Doing so, he manages to bring the world back to stability and manages to hire an interesting secret service. Led by the patriotic Captain Atom, Black Lightning, Power Girl and other well known heroes are now working to keep America safe. Unfortunately they didn't notice the country sized kryptonite meteor heading towards Earth. Luthor, as president feels now is a great time to finally get Superman so he blames the meteor on him and sets a one billion dollar bounty to bring Superman to justice. Now the most powerful hero is on the run from heroes and villains alike and the only person who believes him and knows how to set things right is none other than Batman.

This movie has a lot of great elements, but there are a few problems with it as well. The major flaw in this film is plot. The story while it is fun to watch there are a few parts that really don't make much sense. For people who love these movies, but don't read the comic books they probably have no idea who some of the characters are. The graphic novel which this film is based on has a few major plot points removed which are essential to the story. This problem is linked to another flaw. `Public Enemies' is way too short and due to time constraints is why we have these gaping holes in the story.  This is actually the shortest of all the DC Animated movies running at a shameful 67 minutes. I mean I know that this movie was all about the action and it was win with a side of awesome sauce I think the movie would have given justice if it had been at least 90 minutes. The positives on the other hand make the negatives tolerable. The first plus is the animation style. What I love the most about the DC Animated projects is when they base their films directly on graphic novel stories they try pay homage to the comic art through the animation. `Justice League: New Frontier' was the first one to do so and like it `Superman/Batman: Public Enemies' pretty much took the characters from the comic and brought them right to the TV as the big, buffed muscle on muscle powerhouses they are in the book. It just made the action sequences so much more awesome when you saw Superman or Batman throw a punch you pretty much said `Yea...they can hit that hard'. The other plus was the voice cast. With the success of the 3 part Worlds Finest episodes of STAS it was only right to bring Clancy Brown, Tim Daly and Kevin Conroy back. They have worked together for so long and their chemistry is incredible. Of course my favorite thing about this film was it was an in your face, knock`em out the box slugfest. Every second a new adversary and some of the most intense action I had seen since the final episode of JLU.

Once again Bruce Timm and company do it again bringing us a fun film. Still, while there has been so much success with this one and its predecessors there are a still some kinks that need to be worked out. I know there are plenty more films to make and who knows which story they will choose next. The next project `Justice League: Crisis On Two Earths' is definitely a make or break, just because of the history that this film is based on. They are really anticipating this one to be their best, and I don't think they would try to disappoint.

Now we have Superman Batman: Public Enemies.  What a disappointment.  The animation was blocky, with all of the male characters having similar bodies.  Power Girl, oh my goodness.

The plot would have been merely passable had I not read the graphic novel on which it's based, but there is so much missing from the book that it's a travesty.  Sure, books are always more detailed than movies, but the movie is 67 minutes.  Could they have made it 90 minutes and maybe incorporated Kal-L, the assault on the White House and Captain Atom's sacrifice?

3867476,4,B0027FG29Y,"So I watched Superman/Batman:Public Enemies twice in one day after I got it. And I will keep this review short as most of the main points have been hit by the people who reveiewed this already (at least the ones that waited till it came out). So here's my break down and the end will be final comments.

STORY:
It was adpated from Jeph Loeb's first arc on the ongoing comic. Love it or hate it, but it was a very faithful adaptation, streamlining something that was basically a set up for the subsequent arcs as well as Infinite Crisis. It was silly, and balls to the wall, and the only gripe I had was not explaining why the Robot was a better choice than Luthor's missles (Answer, robot was made of Metallo, not the guy, the alloy.) But hey all and all I liked what they did.

Characters (voice and portrayal):
WHOA! Okay I read the comics and almost forgot the laundry list of vilains who come out the cracks for the bounty. Batman and Superman were pitch perfect and their banter was great after seeing them so serious with each other all the time in Justice League and JLU. Tim Daly returning for Superman was great to have, though I'm one of the few that feel George Newburn's performance as the character is just as good. Kevin Conroy and Clancy Brown however are the quintessential Batman and Lex Luthor respectively. Props to getting CCH Pounder to return as Amanda Waller even if the charatcer model looked horrendous. Lastly the supporting charatcers were great. However I wonder why so much fuss was made about LeVar ""Reading Geordi LeForge's Rainbow"" Burton as Black Lightning when he had one line. Killer Frost was a throwaway villain that had more to say. *Sigh* Wasted talent.

ART AND ANIMATION:
Again based on the source material, the art style took a muscular turn and was fully mimicing Ed McGuiness' style where every male looks like a ""Masters of the Uninverse"" figure. I personally love his style and always though it would translate well to the screen. I was mostly right. They made Superman look too young, and I think it's because of the eyes. McGuiness does the squinty look better than most, and we see this in Captain Marvel's design, and in the comics Superman has the same look sometimes. That plus the cheekbone line makes him look a bit older. Well probably out of fear of backlash (last time they put lines on his face people said he looked too old, and in ""Doomsday"" he looked even older)they elft those lines out and he looks too young. Everyone else in my opinion looked fine. Okay Powergirl's eyes bugged me too but I was distracted by something else.

FINAL THOUGHTS:
I liked it. It was a great action flick, and didn't need too much character development. It's Superman and Batman, if you don;t know who they are why are you even picking up te movie. It's a buddy flick with wall to wall action. My biggest issue is it felt rushed. At 67 minutes it's like 15 minutes shorter than previous releases and could have really benefitted from them. That said if you like the characters and you like action this is worth it.

AFTERTHOUGHT:
The preview for the next upcoming animated feature, Jusitce League: Crisis on Two Earths was great. Yes I know after Public Enemies going back to new voices will suck but they got some good ones. Mark Harmon makes a pretty good Superman, I'm on the fence for Billy Baldwin as Batman (needs to be grittier), James Woods does an amazingly devious and twisted Owlman, and Gena Torres was great as SuperWoman. Hope you enjoy!",1254355200,29,3493,4.5824
3867477,4,B0027FG29Y,"I watched Public Enemies last night with my two boys, ages 7 and 9, and we all enjoyed it.  In fact, the only other DC animated film that I like more was Justice League: New Frontier.  Having Kevin Conroy (Batman), Tim Daly (Superman) and Clancy Brown (Luthor) back was nice, and I really liked the Ed McGuinnes-style animation.

However, there is some colorful dialogue that isn't necessary that made me cringe a bit.  Lex Luthor calls Amanda Waller a ""female dog"" and Batman uses the word ""hell"" a few times.  There's also a Jon Stewart Show style intro at the beginning that bleeps out the bad language, but you'll still get the picture.

Bottom line, the animated movies are PG-13 for a reason.",1254355200,11,698,4.634146341463414
3867478,4,B0027FG29Y,"I had high expectations for ""Superman/Batman: Public Enemies"" as it reunited the best voices to ever portray the lead characters, Tim Daly (Superman), Kevin Conroy (Batman), and Clancy Brown (Lex Luthor), and offered a truly intriguing premise, Luthor as President (while I had never read the graphic novel on which this film is based, images of Lex as the Chief Executive have popped up many times over the years, and I've enjoyed them). Unfortunately, the film didn't live up to the hype, with a storyline that seemed little more than an excuse to allow the World's Finest team to brawl with a 'Who's Who' of DC villains (and a few heroes). Besides some amusing banter, the script is surprisingly shallow, with two points that particularly bothered me; considering how familiar Luthor's evil nature is to the Justice League, why didn't any members speak out, when he declared Supes an outlaw, putting a bounty on his head? Also, considering how much emphasis is placed on the meteor approaching Earth being composed entirely of Kryptonite, why is nothing relating to that ever explored? The way it is used, the meteor could have just as easily been Uranium, or any other radioactive element. I hope Jeph Loeb's novel was deeper and more thorough than this!

While the film was a letdown, the Bonus Features certainly make this DVD edition worth owning. Disc One offers a preview of the graphic novel, ""In Which the Dead Shall Rise"", a truly eerie tale of the resurrection of many fallen superheroes of the past, as, it appears, zombies, and also offers extended trailers for 4 previous animated releases. Disc Two is even better, with a VERY entertaining variation of ""My Dinner With Andre"", as Bruce Timm and the DC creative team enjoy dinner with the 'Batman', himself, Kevin Conroy (who reveals he actually DID wear the batsuit, once), along with two of the best Tim Daly/Kevin Conroy team-up episodes in the animated Superman series of the '90s (I'd forgotten how good Dana Delany was, as Lois Lane!), a preview of the next DC release (a confrontation between our Earth's Justice League with an evil version, from an alternate universe), and a silly, yet engaging psychological profile of Superman and Batman.

So, ""Superman/Batman: Public Enemies (Two-Disc Special Edition)"" is a mixed blessing...but I'm still glad I purchased it!",1254355200,2,2338,4.992307692307692
3867479,3,B0027FG29Y,"I'm a huge fan (..and owner) of most anything DC animated. Starting from Batman the Animated Series, running through the JLA / JLU seasons 1 & 2 all the way up to Green Lantern : First Flight. With that established, let me get straight into the goods and bads of this release that really just make it a so-so watch:

GOODs:

* Great voice acting for each of the 3 major roles. From the talents that we've really come to associate with each of these characters

* (minor) A few new interesting twists, like this films version of the Toyman

* Extras. 3 Hrs of extras, with a great sneek peek look at the next DCU animated film : Justice League - Crisis on Two Earths. Which looks just awesome btw

BADs:

* Pacing. The movie has some really great story ideas that are spoiled by a badly trimmed down and rushed pacing. Even the connection between the various heroes (Superman, Batman & Powergirl) feels hollow, because no real time is spent reiforcing it via interaction and dialogue.

* Bad attempts at WOW moments by using a mass cast of villains that basically jump out from behind a rocks & bushes. No lead up on the use of these well established and recognized foes, just ""Hey here we are, get ready to be beaten on"" scenes - so to speak.

* Length. Which plays a big part in the above complaint - Pacing. The film is a disappointing 1hr, being fueled by a storyline and characters that need at least another hour +

* Some bad moments in dialogue and scene between Superman & Batman. Moments that just feel flat and blah.

Over-all Superman/Batman - Public Enemies is a so-so watch thats at least worthy of a single viewing. Plan for the possibility of an hour that you feel could have been spent with something better, and expect some disappointment. I will say that the Blu-Ray version of the film does offers up crisp, clean and clear animation.",1254355200,7,1853,4.455621301775148

Superman (Voiced by Tim Daley) still doesn't trust in him not even as president as some members of the Justice League are working for the president. However there is a threat a ginatic Kryptonian meteorite heading straight to Earth as the world is in great danger, Supes and his pal Batman (Voiced by Kevin Conroy) believe that Luthor is really up to something as the so-called president frames them of a crime they didn't commit. As they have a price on their heads for many superheros including Captain Marvel and Hawkman even some villains like Solomon Grundy with others want the money, it's up to Supes and Bats to clear their names and reveal the truth of Luthor before the world is finished.

Very faithful adaptation of the graphic novel from Jeph Loeb and Ed Mcguiness brings to life the beloved DC characters on the small screen in a successful way much like the other DC animated movies have. The animation here is outstanding using old school 2D with some CGI at times in a semi-3D sort of vein with non-stop action and the film does have an interesting story much like the graphic novel itself. This movie features appearences from many famed DC villains and heroes all together in one movie, this is one of the better DC animated movies that is sure to win the hearts of fans of DC comics.

This movie is just disappointing because it was an oversimplification, they cut so much and rewrote so much to cram it into 67 minutes. It loses alot of the menacing of Lex Luthor being president and is basically a big fight without substance. One of the best things about the comic was seeing Superman and Batman's contrasting thoughts and what they really thought of each other - this movie leaves that out. And while Batman does, Superman doesn't look quite like McGuiness drew him. Also some language was beyond the realm of the cartoons and didn't serve anything - the occurrences were just glaringly unfortunate.

3867484,2,B0027FG29Y,"I bought this because of my need to own all the Kevin Conroy Batman stuff. Unfortunately, this movie was pretty disappointing. First, I will say that I did like some of the character interaction between Batman and Superman in this film. I took away an impression that although they're obviously friends, Batman and Superman come from such totally different worlds that they could never completely open themselves up to one another. Yes. They work as a team, but they each have their own approach, ethic and motivation. I liked some of the non-action scenes between the two of them.

The bad part is that the story is lacking. The whole Krytonian meteor thing and Lex Luthor as President really doesn't add up to engaging action and drama. Even the fact that Batman and Superman end up fighting mostly good guys in this one doesn't warrant too much excitement. Actually, the story was pretty boring.

The animation wasn't that great either. Yes. The colors were vibrant and eye-catching, but the action animation was franky sub-par. Just watch how some of the super-hero characters walk. Looks corny to me. I expected more.",1254268800,4,1122,4.9
3867485,4,B0027FG29Y,"You knew it had to happen sometime.  The rest of the DC Universe is so overshadowed by two enormously legendary heroes that eventually the two would have take on everybody at once.  And with the unlimited power of Superman and the tactical genius of Batman, who'd bet against them?  ""Public Enemies"" is too short, lacks character development (or even speaking roles for a large number of characters), and ends in the lamest way possible but when The Caped Crusader and The Man of Steel are laying on the ownage, this film is a masterpiece of animated comic book action.  Fans of the two icons are going to want to see this for sure. This review has a few minor spoilers so if you want to go in without knowing any plot details, feel free to skip to the last paragraph.

We are brought into the story amidst a flurry of news reports chronicling an economic collapse in the USA.  Relevant, no?  The end result: President Lex Luthor.  The genius billionaire actually turns the country around and becomes respected even by the superhero community.  Many of them even sign up to work for him.  The biggest holdout?  Guess.  Superman knows Luthor is up to something, and his suspicions are confirmed when The new prez publicly offers to meet with him to discuss the threat posed by a gigantic kryptonite meteor hurtling towards Earth and brings along some insurance.  Insurance in the form of kryptonite powered-cyborg Metallo who assaults Supes, shoots him with a kryptonite bullet, and buries him alive along with an assisting Batman.  Not a bad day's work for a second-string supervillain.  His payment?  Well, Luthor isn't known for his gratitude.  Naturally, Bats and Supes survive and wind up being framed for murder after Luthor shows the public some selective shots of Superman being a little over-aggressive, sics his superteam on him, and offers a general billion-dollar bounty for the big blue boy scout.  Fun time!

First up: DC's ice-powered villains team up and have a go at The Bat while Superman battles the Silver Banshee. That scream has seriously got to hurt a guy with super-hearing.  Then Gorilla Grodd clumsily uses his mind control to send in his own team and get Lady Shiva (in a very bad animated debut) knocked out in one punch from Batman.  Isn't he supposed to be a genius or something?  And why on Earth would Copperhead even think about taking on Superman?  COPPERHEAD?!  Yeah, Copperhead.  Taking on Superman.  It's very brief.  And why would Catman even show up?  Bane, Giganta, and Solomon Grundy all get pwned impressively.  Eventually, Luthor's team shows up.  These guys are the primary antagonists and consist of Starfire, Captain Atom, Katana,  Major Force, Black Lightning, and Power Girl.  An interesting combo.  Power Girl is featured very prominently, which is disappointing since I've never cared for the character much.  As a  kinda-sorta relative of Superman she never buys the murder rap, but she's still in the president's employ which is to say she mostly just sits there with a deer-in-the-headlights look.  I do love the character design they used, but Power Girl never does anything to justify the amount of screentime given to her.  After a brief lull, Batman and Superman are hit by Captain Marvel and Hawkman.  Now, I know I like to joke about Supes being lame and all, but he is freakin' Shaft compared to Captain Marvel.  The fact that The Man of Steel has to call for a switch of opponents because old ""Shazaam"" is too much for him sucks.  And why does Batman -who abhors firearms, of course- think missiles are okay?  Regardless, the action scenes are epic and among the coolest ever done for an animated comic book film.  This middle section of the film kicks all kinds of tail, flaws and all.  I didn't mention all of the character present, either.  There really are a lot of behinds to kick.

But once the major action scenes are over with, it's all downhill.  Luthor goes stark-raving mad after injecting himself with a cocktail of steroid and kryptonite and starts trying to make out with fat chicks and stuff.  Then he climbs into a mech suit and well, no good can come of that.  I prefer Luthor as a level-headed genius, not a lunatic ripping off Iron Man. And do I need to mention how goddamn sorry it is that Toyman is the big hero?  He's the worst Superman villain ever!  Even in this revamped form, I just wasn't feeling it.  And holy hell is there anything dumber then a half-Superman-half-Batman rocket?  No.  No there is not.  The final act of this film is just one big collection of wrong.

As much fun as I had watching ""Superman/Batman: Public Enemies"", there are a lot of pretty unforgivable flaws.  Most of the characters get no lines (including Lois freakin' Lane) and the ones that do get lines usually don't say anything remotely interesting.  I applaud the large cast of semi-obscure DC characters, but I wish that more could have been done with them other then just being named out loud by a title hero and then promptly disposed of.  A lot of this is just bad storytelling.  Since many of these issues are typical DC fare, I'm going to blame the source material for much of it even though I haven't read it.  I find that Bruce Timm and the rest of DC's animation crew work best when they differentiate themselves from the comics.  In sticking with an established graphic novel, they took on all of the flaws that often plague DC books where there would have been none of that if they'd put their own stamp on it the way they usually do.  On the other hand, I don't believe I've seen an animated comic book film that I've enjoyed the art more.  No complaints there.

The single-disc edition gets 3 stars because all of the special features are recycled from past releases. This is becoming a habit with these releases. Not cool.  Disc two is a different story and if you buy this film, the double-discer is the one to get.  It's got interviews, a Batman/Superman featurette comparing the two, a sneak peak at the next  DC animated project (as always), and two episodes of the awesome&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Justice-League/dp/B002LMSWU0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Justice League</a>&nbsp;show which I won't be watching because I'm looking forward to rewatching the entire series when the upcoming boxed-set release drops.  But if you haven't seen it, it's a great bonus.  So in spite of it's many flaws, do I recommend this set?  Does Power Girl have big.......?  It's Batman.  And Superman.  Whupping everyone.  Sweet.

3 1/2 stars rounded up for lotsa special features",1254268800,3,6597,4.824107142857143

For those who are like me who always want know more about how things are made (and dream of making these things someday) the special features on disc 2 are a must see with amazing insights and great stories as well as a preview of what looks like it will be a smash in the spring of 2010: ""Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths.""

There is more I could say about this but I think it would be best for the parents to review this film for their kids, watch the special features, understand the production, and then, if they feel their children can handle it, let the kids take a gander.  They'll thank you for it.  :)  Thanks for reading my review and have a nice day.",1254268800,,904,4.113636363636363
3867487,5,B0027FG29Y,this is the best of all the dc and wb animated films that have come out. One thing that i like about this movie is that you get to see superman and batman fight off the legion of doom and their own friends from the justice league. the story is very well done but one can get lost in the action if they do not follow what is going on with the plot.,1254182400,,347,3.767123287671233
3867488,5,B0027FG29Y,"Keeping in mind the fact that they were trying to turn a six-issue story arc into a 67 minute film, you have to be impressed by this movie. Kevin Conroy, Clancy Brown, and Tim Daly are all back lending their voices to the roles that made them famous (in animated circles, anyway) as Batman, Luthor, and Superman. Most of the powerful moments from the comic story are here, and there are some incredible cameos from villains and heroes like Black Lightning, Catman, Deadshot, Hawkman, Captain Marvel, Solomon Grundy, and a dozen more. There's a lot to like here, so if you're looking for a great way to spend an hour, invest in this.

DC is doing a great job of cranking out quality animated movies. After ""First Flight"", we were given this. I can't wait to see what they have planned next. I'm hoping ""Blackest Night"" will eventually find its way to an animated movie someday.",1254182400,,876,4.615384615384615
3867489,1,B0027FG29Y,"Our family watches all the DC cartoons. We are spoiled by the good animation of Justice League and Superman. This animation was not nearly that calabre, the previews were very deceptive. Thank goodness they used the original voices, or this would have seemed even more low budget. The worst part was the swearing -at regular intervals. Don't buy this for the kids.",1254182400,8,364,4.887096774193548
3867490,4,B0027FG29Y,"What happens when Lex Luthor becomes the President? Nothing good that's what! Superman and Batman naturally know that Lex is up to no good, and with a meteor made of Kryptonite headed on a collision course with Earth, Luthor's plan to turn the public on Supes and Bats comes to fruition, even with their fellow superheroes hunting them down. Superman/Batman: Public Enemies makes great use of Jeph Loeb's storyarc on the once best selling comic title, and even better use translating the artwork of Ed McGuiness to the realm of animation. While its story tends to lag as it goes on, the real icing on the cake here is the voice talent, which finds 90s stalwarts from the Batman and Superman animated series' Kevin Conroy, Tim Daly, and Clancy Brown returning as Batman, Superman, and Lex Luthor respectively. All in all, Superman/Batman: Public Enemies is a good time and another fine animated DC adventure that is definitely worth your time if you've enjoyed DC's line of animated films so far.",1254182400,,995,4.858823529411764

3867492,4,B0027FG29Y,"Great Movie, but what is up with WB? First Green Lantern now Superman and Batman! The Digital Copy will only work with the Windows Media Player. Why not make it universal or advertise that its a WMP compatible only?",1254182400,4,215,4.538461538461538
3867493,4,B0027FG29Y,"I was a big fan of the six issue Public Enemies comic storyline so I was pleased to see that Warner Brothers Animation decided to make it into a movie. So let me start with the good. I thought it was an excellent decision to try and preserve the visual feel of the original comic and for the most part the animators did a very good job of mimicking the artistic style of Ed McGuinness. It doesn't hurt things that McGuinness has a bold, bright, clean style that lends itself perfectly to animation.  The scene where Batman and Superman battle Mongul and Solomon Grundy is probably the best example of the animator's success in capturing McGuinness's look and feel.

There was a suggestion that this next section may contain spoilers so read at your own peril. Mostly I mention things that are in the original comic but not in the movie but this could be considered spoilers so be warned.

The original story by Jeff Loeb is unlikely to go down in history as a literary classic but it's a lot of fun and action packed which probably explains why it was chosen to be adapted into a movie over a superior story like All-Star Superman. Just about all the action is faithfully translated although a lot of the side stories are jettisoned. The future Superman is absent from the story as well as any reference to John Corben/Metallo potentially being the man who killed Bruce Wayne's parents. I was looking forward to seeing the assault on the White House by the Batman and Superman families but that also got the axe. The biggest disappointment was the complete rearrangement of the ending. One of my favorite parts of the original story was the battle between Superman and the Kryptonite Venom infused Luthor in his Apokolips battle suit. Superman wrecks the suit and then passes Luthor on to Batman to finish the job off. The battle does exist in the movie but the dynamics are radically altered to the detriment of the story. And the final blow is the removal of Captain Atom's self sacrifice at the end. Again, the movie ending is vastly inferior.

The animation was quite good although occasionally inconsistent. For whatever reason Captain Cold was drawn in a very simplistic manner reminiscent of what you might see in an early episode of Superman TAS and The Icicle, rather than looking like he's literally frozen looked like a cartoon freak with a gigantic nose. Luckily these characters appear for just a moment and are followed by the spectacularly rendered Mongul and Grundy. All in all the movie is a very good effort. I understand why much of the story was left out but I'm a little less forgiving about the mixed up ending. I've seen less than half of the DC/Warner Bros Animation movies but so far this one is my favorite despite a few complaints. Another story I'd love to see done is `Superman: Our Worlds at War' but that one is at least twice as long Public Enemies so I shudder to think of the amount of chopping it would receive.",1254182400,6,2946,4.605714285714286
3867494,5,B0027FG29Y,"Ive got the graphic novel and liked it alot. I just got done watching the movie and personally think its one of the best superhero cartoons ive seen. My only complaint was that it ended.  I really wanted it to keep going and it was really cool to see CAPTAIN MARVEL in a great movie.

The animation like always is great.  Great story. I cant wait for the Crisis movie and if anyone at the DC UNIVERSE is reading this, plz make KINGDOM COME.  Best comic I ever read.  Hope you don't chang a bit of it though from page to film. its great the way it is. the religious part scares me, just in a way that I don't know if u would include it on a film. I hope you do if u make it.

I honestly cant believe PUBLIC ENEMIes wasn't released in a theater. I think its that good.

If you haven't read the book, youll love this movie and if u have read it youll still love it.  Its good to see Superman and Batman again. This is the best 20.00 I spent in a long time.",1254182400,2,953,3.9270833333333335
3867495,4,B0027FG29Y,"This movie was actually quite good. I enjoyed viewing it. To start off with my review the story line was impressive, one of DC universe better animated movies. The picture and sound quality was totally amazing. If u'r a fan of the series you should get u'rself a copy like I did and watch it in a HI-DEF surround Sound set-up.

I think animation wise I was good with it. No series changes.  was glad that the DC universe was opened up some and we saw some of the other characters.

3867497,1,B0027FG29Y,This mediocre (at best) movie comes to a grinding halt in the third act when a child prodigy (generic anime styled character) is revealed to have built a giant robot to help Supes and Batman stop a meteor heading towards earth. What does the robot look like? HALF Superman and HALF Batman- split right down the middle. AWFUL!,1253750400,10,325,4.620689655172414
3867498,3,B0027FG29Y,"I am a huge fan of all the DC animated DVD releases. I think the Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, and Gotham Knight films were outstanding and a testament to how these companies should handle their straight to DVD titles. This release, however, just seemed to fall flat for me, and no matter how hard I tried I just could not get into it as much as I did the others.

The main thing that bugged me was the animation. While the other films I mentioned had stupendous animation value, this one seemed to be done by a third rate Korean animation studio. Its semi-anime style just didn't seem to fit in with the subject matter and Superman's spiky hairdo just didn't do it for me. I know that superheros usually have gigantic muscles and abs chiseled from granite, but Supes and Bats just looked like they were made out of plastic. A lot of the other character designs were also a little off. For instance, they made Amanda Waller the size of a small sperm whale. It could just be because I am so used to the Justice League style, but I just couldn't get past it the whole time I was watching the film.

The voice acting, however, is spot on as usual. The trifecta of Kevin Conroy, Tim Daly and Clancy Brown kept me in the movie, and when Superman gets pissed, you know it.

As for the story, it was also kind of boring. It seemed more like a decent two-part Justice League episode rather than something to make a feature out of, and the big battles just weren't all that action packed. The final battle between Lex, Darkseid, Batman and Superman from Unlimited was much more epic in scale, and I would probably have rather just watched that again than sit through this. Also, I can only watch a bunch of morons ""think Lex has changed"" so many times before I just hope that they all get their stomachs repeatedly bruised by Batman's fists.

Overall, it wasn't terrible, but I've just come to expect more from the DC animated department. I guess they can't all be winners, however.",1253577600,8,1972,4.439226519337017
3867499,4,B0027FG29Y,"I just finished watching this movie and I was pleasantly surprised. Of the recent DC Animated Movies released by Warner Bros, I would say this is the second best right behind the Wonder Woman Movie.

The story pretty much follows the comic book arc, with some changes which I thought was fine when adapting to a animated movie. The animation was excellent and wasn't CGI heavy like the Green Lantern Movie. The action sequences are great and there's a lot of it. The story moves along fast and there isn't much characterization like in the Wonder Woman movie. They pretty much expect you to know who Batman and Superman are and how they act. I enjoyed this movie a lot. It reminded me of the old Justice League cartoon TV series.",1253491200,8,729,4.564885496183206
3867500,5,B0027FG29Y,"Ok before I start, let me clarify something: Unlike the reviewers before me, I have actually SEEN this movie, so my review is not based on the graphic novel of which the movie is based, nor what the movie might be like based on who's behind the making of it. I HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE.  Now that thats out the way, onto the good stuff.

I know a lot of Batman, Superman, and Batman/Superman fans were holding their breath on this one. With all classic the DC Comic character movies coming out lately (some of them not as good as others) it was reasonable to assume that ""Superman/Batman: Public Enemies"" the movie could have gone either way. Well good thing for the loyal fan base, this was definitely a hit. I can say I am more then pleased with how this came out, and I have every intention of buying this DVD and watching it again the day it comes home with me.

One thing is abundantly clear when watching this movie: WB Entertainment, and more importantly, DC Comics actually LISTENS to their fans. One of my (and others) biggest fears in this was that we were going to be hearing some sub-par voice acting for the main characters involved, i.e. Superman, Batman, and Lex Luthor. As with past offerings from WB Entertainment (""Superman: Doomsday"" for example) we got some weak casting for the voices of Lex and Sups. That alone detracts greatly from the overall enjoyment of the movie. With Public Enemies however, we have the best voices ever cast for the starring 3 roles: Tim Daily as Superman, Kevin Conroy as Batman, and Clancy Brown as Lex Luthor. For those who could give two flips about these guys, they are the same voices from the popular shows Justice League Unlimited, Batman The Animated Series, and Superman the Animated Series.

On top of superb voice acting, the animation is crisp, sharp and just plain beautiful. Again, faithful to fan feedback, the artists from Justice League Unlimited seem to have had their hands in this project, because the art is pretty much the same (which is by no means a bad thing), and it looks great. Almost straight from the comic.

Speaking of which, as far as the story goes, keep in mind while watching this that its an adaptation to the comic. That being said however, the movie stays remarkably faithful to the story told in the comic. Minus a few altered frames, scenes and situations, its like reading the comic all over again, except with no imagination needed to enjoy it. The story in general is a very good one, highlighting Batman and Superman's friendship and giving you a glimpse into how deep it really goes. Granted, you get more of that in the comic then you do in the movie, but the movie compensates for the lack of inner dialogue with good script writing, full of the humorous exchanges between Sups and Bats and emotional moments and outburst we know and love from our favorite caped heroes.

This is a great movie, and you don't have to have read the comic first in order to enjoy it. Even the review value is moderately high, I can and WILL be watching this again as soon as I can, and some more times after that.  This is worth price, grab it and enjoy a motion picture work of art.
