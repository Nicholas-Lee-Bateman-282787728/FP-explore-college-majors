1660979,5,B00005T5YG,"I have been bummed out about Disney's lack of initiative regarding their late 90s & early 2000's Disney Channel Original Movies.  Sure they were released on vhs back in the day, but for the last ten years they've been unavailable to (legally) watch or purchase.  So happy going on Amazon today and finding them all on Instant Video for $7.99 or less!!!  Finally, movies about real kids and their families that don't involve pop stars, spies or talking dogs (with super obnoxious/stupid kids).  Motocrossed was always my favorite.  It has twins, a girl impersonating her brother ala ""Twelfth Night,"" and a girl dominating a ""man's"" sport!  Also a cute romance, with an even cuter boy, that's not the movie's entire focus.  It has aged really well and the video quality looks amazing streaming on my kindle hd, especially since I doubt Disney did much of anything to clean it up.  Can't wait to buy all the others!!!  Thanks for finally listening to us Disney.  Now you just need to add ""Model Behavior"" and ""My Date With the President's Daughter"" for me to be fully happy.  Imagine all the late twenty-something and early thirties women that would pay $$$ for rare films with their teen crushes in them! ;)",1451952000,2,1205,4.7451923076923075

1661046,5,B00005T5YG,I love this movie being a racer my self. This movie is great I loved it when I was a kid and still love it now. If you like motocross you'll like this movie. The actors are great the track is great and Alana Austin is awesome ! (And really hot before she cut her hair) I reccomend this movie to anyone who likes dirtbikes. I give it way 5 starz ! you won't regret buying it !,1106870400,,375,3.8205128205128207
1661047,5,B00005T5YG,"This movie was very good!  The actors played their parts well, and the story is entertaining from beginning to end.  It almost makes you want to get into motocross racing!  There was friendship, romance, and of course, motocross, in this well-thought out and family friendly movie.  All the characters were enjoyable and easy to relate to.  Alana Austin was especially good as Andrea, the main character.

Overall, I would say this was a great movie!  But I would rather wait for it to come on Disney Channel then buy it.",1098748800,,521,4.722222222222222
1661048,5,B00005T5YG,"This is the film that got our family in to the whole MX scene.  Being a fan 25 years ago and then getting away from it, this video brought back all the old time feelings and shows the sport for what it really is.  Family.  Having three sons now myself, we now have three dirt bikes and ride as often as we can.  Even myself learning to ride at the ripe old age of 43, I think the kids are stoked to see mom out there getting roosted and enjoying it.  Great cameos by the king of Supercross Jeremy McGrath and freestyle gold medal winner Travis Pastrana.",1095724800,,553,4.130841121495327
1661049,5,B00005T5YG,This is an awesome movie. I ride myself and being female and ridding can some times get alittle scechy...but not for the chick in this movie. this is a must own for all you disney movie freaks.,1082937600,2,193,4.243243243243243
1661050,5,B00005T5YG,"This movie is my favorite of all time, even as a 15 year old girl. It is a total girl power movie with motocross action and a great rock soundtrack too. Travis Pastrana and Jeremy McGrath are even in it. My brother and I watch it so much, we can quote half of it. After seeing this movie, I saved up my money and went out and bought a dirtbike. Me and my dad now love to go riding together. If you don't want your kids to want to dirtbike, than don't let them watch this awesome movie too much, but definatly buy it for them. Motocrossed Rocks!! I can't wait for the second one to come out.",1046390400,3,590,4.008474576271187
1661051,4,B00005T5YG,"This film originally produced for the Disney Channel is one of the better productions to come out of the cable network. The story revolves around Andrea Carson, a young teenage girl who enjoys motocross just as much as her twin brother Andrew. When he brother is injured, she assumes his identity on the track. The film tells the story on how she attempts to hide her true identity through a competition from both her fellow racers and also from her father, who does not approve of girls ridding motocross. Somewhat of a mix between a rated-G teen movie, Shakespeare's comedy ""Twelfth Night"", and Disney's animated ""Mulan"", ""Motocrossed"" is an interesting film for the entire family but especially for fans of the sport and young girls looking for another ""girl-power"" flick.",1046390400,,775,4.969230769230769
1661082,5,B00005T5YG,"Motocrossed is about the Carson family, which consists of dad Edward; mom Geneva; twins Andrew and Andrea; and youngest Jason. Andrew (Trever O'Brien) is an aspiring motocross racer, while his twin Andrea (Alana Austin) is a cheerleader with a tomboy side. The dad manages Andrew, and the mom supports the kids however she can. One day, though, Andrew and Andrea decided to race while their parents aren't home, and Andrew ends up hurting his leg; which, obviously, means he can't go to the big race in a few weeks! So the dad goes to Europe to find a new rider; and while he's gone, the race is moved up to that weekend. The dad can't come back because he doesn't know and the family can't get ahold of him, and if they miss that first race they can't qualify for the Cup. So Andrea cuts her hair and tries to pull off the race as her brother. But her mom finds out, and they eventually end up going anyway. There, Andrea meets Dean Talon (Riley Smith; total cutie), who helps show her the ropes of big-time racing in return for tips on how to get a date with his manager's daughter Farren Henderson. Andrea gets better, and Dean gets his girl, but Andrea also has a crush on Dean. Andrea eventually podiums, and just as all seems well, her dad finds out!
That's all I'm gonna tell you. This is a great family film, but I think teens would enjoy it on their own; I do. The music is pretty good, the motocross scenes rock, and there is some definite eye candy (i.e., Riley Smith, Trever O'Brien...). The acting is good, and the plot is good as well. This is one not to be missed.",1030665600,5,1579,4.3559322033898304
1661083,5,B00005T5YG,"This was one of my favorite Disney Channel Original movies; not only did include two very handsome guys, playing the roles of the main character's twin and of her love interest, but it was also quite entertaining.  And the movie is not only about BMX racing, but also centers around an average teenage girl who is trying to make something of herself, a topic which often reoccurs throughout the Disney Channel Original series and movies.  But that factor alone makes this movie appeal to a more feminine audience.",1026777600,2,513,4.818181818181818

1661085,5,B00005T5YG,"This movie is just adorable.  I loved it because my love Travis Pastrana is in it, and even though he only has 1 line, it's the best in the whole movie!
