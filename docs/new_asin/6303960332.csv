7856922,4,6303960332,"I really enjoyed this movie, but I thought the ending was terribly tragic.  After it was over, I wanted to rewrite the story, perhaps have Edwina get her baby back and get together with Thomas Rafferty.  In a way, Richard Kiley's character is worse than Veronica Hamel's; he is a good man yet he caters to his wife's every whim.  I thought of reading the book The Other Anna, on which this is based but decided against it.  The ending there might be worse than in the movie.",1156464000,,474,4.3522727272727275
