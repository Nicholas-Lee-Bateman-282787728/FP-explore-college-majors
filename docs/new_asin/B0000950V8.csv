7989502,5,B0000950V8,"Alot of fights from big names like Quinton Jackson, Sean Sherk, Marvin Eastman, Yves Edwards, Mike Bourke, and Duane Ludwig.....",1368748800,,128,5.45
7989503,5,B0000950V8,"I loved this DVD personally, but I am NOT saying that everyone will. If you are a casual UFC fan, and that's what you expect to see you will be sorely disappointed. This is small time MMA in the days where they were still tossing the term ""NHB"" around. If you don't know what that means, again, you probably shouldn't buy this DVD.

That said, if you are the kind of MMA fan that I am, who appreciates a good fight no matter the camera quality and the name of the fighter, then you'll love this. It's an excellent buy especially for the price I got it for (under $4). The only bad thing I can say about the whole set is that Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson is a terrible ringside announcer and his knowledge of MMA is on par with John McCain's. This also contains the infamous KOTC: Wet & Wild, where all of the fights were outdoors in the middle of a bad rainstorm and every fight includes fighters falling over and slipping on a wet mat... kind of annoying.",1354665600,,951,4.225274725274725
7989504,3,B0000950V8,"The production values for these shows is incredibly low. Poor camera angles and very poor audio. In fact, audio in the first DVD is nearly unbearable. Comparing these shows to a Pride or UFC show is like eating at a high end restaurant and then eating a meal made in an Easy Bake Oven.
HOWEVER, there are TONS of fights, with no preamble. You can see as many as 4 fights in the span of 5 minutes. No interviews, entrances, just fights. Plus, you get to watch Herb Dean fight.",1222214400,,475,4.288888888888889
7989505,4,B0000950V8,"Like all types of MMA programs you won't be happy with every fight, thats just the way it is but overall this is an excellent set. To me I feel KotC is better than UFC simply because the fights have more action and the fighters want to win. Quite similar in terms of the ring and rules like UFC but more excitement. Even when the fight goes to the ground alot of the contenders will defend very well and try to change position or take advantage rather than sitting back trying not to lose. Theres some well known guys popping up in here and also some unknown randoms which make for some spectacular rumbles, technical or slug fests. Theres no special features really, just straight into fights with small intros on the athletes. If your not a MMA fan it may not be for you but Id recommend to check it out because for over 20 hours costing under $20 its worth the money.",1149206400,5,870,4.310975609756097
7989506,3,B0000950V8,"I was pretty excited to see these events.  10 events, 125 fights on 5 DVDs for under $20 sounds like an amazing deal.  It's a good deal, but not quite what I was hoping for.

King of the Cage follows the same basic rules as the UFC.  The octagon/cage is quite a bit smaller, though, leaving far less room to run when a fighter is in trouble. These fights are mostly between garbage fighters who are not all that entertaining to watch. I suppose fighters are excited when they make it to the UFC for a reason...

In this set, you get to see a few fights with Paul Buentello, who has impressive striking. He wins one fight and loses the other. Keith Jardine, newly inaugurated into the UFC, has 3 impressive fights on this collection, all of which he wins. MMA legend Dan Severn also has a few interesting fights. You get to see Joe ""Daddy"" Stevenson in his pre-UFC days. He is really the only fighter who ""plays it up"" in the octagon with taunts and a bit of showboating in his 2nd fight on the set. In his first fight, he loses the championship at 170 lbs. He is an exciting fighter, though, no question.

Forrest Griffin makes a single appearance in this set, as he takes on a no name fella and ground & pounds him until the referee steps in. You've got to love Griffin. He is an exciting fighter. Diego Sanchez also makes a couple of appearances. He is an animal - and he wins both of his fights by submission, but not before pounding on each of his opponents for a few minutes. Dennis Hallman, who defeated UFC champ Matt Hughes twice, is one of the best fighters around... for the first 2 minutes of a fight. He seems to gas out early in every fight I've seen him in. Karo Parisyan is an underdog in his fight, but proves to have the skills to take out a more experienced opponent.  Nate ""the Rock"" Quarry suffers a loss in a close fight.  He is a good fighter, but he surely wasn't ready to fight Rich Franklin for the title a few months ago.

In this set, certain events are better than others.  There were a few events where I recognized more refs than fighters.  Now UFC referee Herb Dean even has a fight, which he wins. There are a few good fights spread out over the collection.  Not too many knockouts, though.  These fights tend to be stopped by the referee or end due to submission.

For the price, it's a great deal, but you will most likely find yourself fast-forwarding through a good deal of the fights, looking for some excitement.

Recommended only for die-hard MMA fans.  Those who are fans of The Ultimate Fighter and live tv UFC events may not enjoy this so much, as there is no ""glitz"" to these events.",1145577600,2,2626,4.306910569105691
7989507,4,B0000950V8,"five disc set, ten kotc events, one on each side, 125 fights, over 13 hours, definetly worth the money but, not worth spending 13 hours to watch it a second time.

this set includes:

 diego nightmare sanchez, forrest griffin, nate quarry, joe stevenson,dan the beast severn, paul buentello, bobby hoffman and others",1135209600,3,316,5.038461538461538
7989508,5,B0000950V8,for the price of this set you get a great deal of fights and events. You're bound to find a number of decent fights and some MMA names on this set. A good introductory set to MMA that will lead you to UFC and Pride shows.,1120435200,2,221,3.8260869565217392
7989509,5,B0000950V8,"If you like to get a lot for you money you won't be sorry! 125 fights, over 13 hours need I say more? There are some great fights and fighters on this set. The Ultimate Fighter fans will recognize Diego Sanchez, Forrest Griffin and Nate Quarry. Others will remember legend Dan ""The Beast"" Severn. Hardcore MMA fans will be familiar with a lot of the names but the casual fans will get a good education here. That being said there are a couple of slow fights here and there, mostly Heavy Weights that are really HEAVY... With 125 fights at such a low cost how could you ask for more?",1115251200,3,582,4.3
