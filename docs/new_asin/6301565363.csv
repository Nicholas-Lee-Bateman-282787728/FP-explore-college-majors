7812427,5,6301565363,"This is it, the last of the four tapes Celebrity Home Entertainment released of my favorite giant robot anime ever.  And it's definitely one of the best.  Although it doesn't bring the nostalgia the first 2 tapes give me, it's a better batch of episodes than the third volume.  Here's the episodes.

Episode 16: While in Germany, Jason encounters Sharky, an old friend of his who loved the same woman Jason did.  Now he's working for Dark star, & is out kill Jason.  Like trugeta-san said, this is a great episode.  Although if you ask me, you should replace great with excellent.  A+

Episode 17: A dictator announces he'll destroy both GRIP and Macron 1.  The 2 teams are forced to team up to fight him.  This is another most excellent episode.  A+

Episode 18: Jason is wounded in battle, so Nathan must pilot Macstar 1 for him.  Not my favorite one, but it's still great like trugeta-san said.  A-

Episode 19: In London, Nathan befriends a boy whose father has been captured by GRIP.  My least favorite on the tape, but it's still pretty good.  Despite the plot focusing on 2 kids, it's well written; not cutesy at all and better than the Junkyard Dogs episode.  The downside is that it has the weakest Macstar 1 battle in the series.  Especially disappointing since we were promised ""A Macstar grade robot""; which brings to mind the Devilcon, or the Golden Sphinx, or that thing in episode 9, not something that looks like a weak Gundam mobile suit.  Its okay, just nothing to write home about.  Still, the final scene is excellent, and we finally find out the name of the blue-haired guy in Beta Command, Gottagrey (I think that's how you spell it).  Overall this is a satisfactory episode.  B+

Episode 20: A reporter named Shelia Madison comes to Macron Base to interview the team then broadcast the story live and make them & the enemy they face public knowledge.  But GRIP is out to stop them.  This is an incredibly good episode.  Shelia's a great character (& the perfect match for Scott if you ask me), and the story is epic.  My favorite part is when Shelia's broadcasting, & we see that all the people Macron 1 has helped are watching (Like the cat from episode 6, the Junkyard Dogs, and my favorite one of all Elena & her people.).  A+  On a side note, how is it that every tape ends on an A+ episode?  Not that I'm complaining mind you, just amazed at the consistency.

So that's it.  That's all of Macron 1 we'll see until somebody wises up & releases it on DVD.  How is it that the lame cartoons that Celebrity Home Entertainment released like Bravestarr, Filmation's Ghostbusters & C.O.P.S. are on DVD while this gem isn't?  This is my #1 favorite giant robot series apart from Transformers.  I love Voltron, but while I approve of them editing out the gore from the original version, it's watered down too much for me at times.  Saban's dub of Macron 1 keeps the references to death and characters dying intact for the most part.  If anyone knows where I can see the episodes online (in English of course), please tell me.  Until then, this is Patrick Correa, signing out...

EDIT: I forgot to mention that like the other volumes there are 2 versions of this tape, the one hour version and the two hour one.  The two hour version has all the episodes I described, while the one hour version only has episodes 16 and 18.  If you are purchasing this online, make sure that you contact the seller and find out how long the tape is before you buy it.",1362960000,,3468,4.490384615384615
7812428,4,6301565363,"I LOVE this show to death. It was recommended by an older
friend (he was alive when it came on). I saw this for 2 bucks and picked it up. I picked up GREAT episodes. The first episode is about a man from Jason's past(Sharki) who Dark Star hires to kill him. We find out they both loved the same woman (Lily). In the second episode, Jason gets hurt so Nathan pilots Alpha
ship and finds out the true purpose of Max Star. Now since I've been talking all good about the show, what's the flaw? Some
of the tape is free of sound effects! And there's that evil
Roul person too. (Grrrr.)",1042243200,,580,4.1415929203539825

Taking elements from shows like Macross and others like Voltron and G-Force, Macron 1 successfully pulled of an awe inspiring blend of action and adventure, and INCREDIBLE music :) I'll never forget hearing Axel F during the series!",975456000,,285,5.355555555555555
