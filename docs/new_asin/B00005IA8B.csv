1425598,3,B00005IA8B,"I am, and have always been a HUGE Paul McCartney fan, and like some many other people on the planet, I associate Paul with the best that rock and roll had/has to offer.  That is why it pains me to say that, in watching and listening to the Cavern concert performance, I was reminded of a line from a popular song written and performed by another famous Paul [Simon] ""I am leaving, I am leaving, but the fighter still remains...""
In his prime, Paul's voice was striking in its simplicity and clarity.  Arguably, there were few, if any singers of his generation, with the exception of John Lennon, who could challenge Paul's place in musical history as the premier singer of rock/pop classics.  I think back to a lyric from an old tune by Leon Russell ""If I could sing like Paul McCartney"" and wonder if Paul himself recognizes that time has clearly taken its toll.
Back in 1976, during his Wings Over America tour, I had the good fortune to see Paul perform live.  I don't exaggerate in saying that I was literally blown away by his voice.  That was a long time ago.
If Paul continues to remain on the scene, strictly speaking, just for the fun of it, then good for him and long live rock and roll!  If, on the other hand, he wants to remain a viable singer/performer, it's high time he more carefully selected material best suited to his current vocal range.  His interviews indicate a strong willed, prideful man not willing to surrender his place in the limelight.  Without doubt, no one could deny that Paul McCartney was blessed with an uncanny and phenomenal talent.  A talent which he has graciously shared with us all these many years.  It would be sad to think that he may be attempting to prove his unparalleled talent beyond his ability to do so.",1012953600,5,1756,4.511041009463723
1425599,5,B00005IA8B,"""Live at the Cavern Club"" might be Paul McCartney's best live concert DVD. I think it's an entertaining and conceptually focused polished movie-style documentary of Paul's history-repeated rock show at the Cavern Club in 1999.  [...]
When I received the DVD of the Cavern Club concert I felt well pleased--to see the intimate concert in its best form, with full sound, color, and resolution.  If you are a Paul McCartney fan ""Live at the Cavern Club"" will be lively, musical, and fun--but a little different, because Paul sings old rock songs with his own new old rock songs, composed for the album ""Run Devil Run.""
The ""Making of"" documentary included on the DVD is an interesting personal chat with Paul.  The 22-minute interview also takes you to Abbey Road studios, where Paul records the concert's album ""Run Devil Run,""--starting with a Sunday night visit to the studio where Paul desperately determines if he can sing again for the start of his recording sessions on Monday morning.  The DVD's two music videos, one in black and white, showing Paul in a row boat in a storm on a studio set, and the other in color, on a studio set of an old Liverpool street, are shorts to own and play for friends.  [...]
Continuity is not much of a problem in ""Live at the Cavern Club."" The few minor continuity flaws (this time guitars) are a result of the live documentary style of filming and editing.  But the color, sound, and images in the historic ""Live at the Cavern Club"" DVD are things you can appreciate.",1002672000,,1507,4.667924528301887
1425600,5,B00005IA8B,"Paul is a natural at rockabilly, totally evidenced by his singing and choice of tunes on this DVD (kudos also to his bass playing - he's one of the best and usually underrated).  For Telecaster fans, David Gilmour and Mick Green do yeoman service, with David taking most of the lead solos and riffs.  Bottom line - this DVD is a must-have for rockabilly and Tele fans.",994896000,4,368,4.477611940298507
1425601,5,B00005IA8B,"My six year old son's first remark upon viewing the opening seconds of 'Live at The Cavern Club' was, ""Paul got old."" But soon enough we were boppin' around trading air-guitar licks as a very ""young-again"" McCartney and band stormed thru the 'Run Devil Run' 50's roots album set.
I'm a Paul fan (no apologies) - so any review would be a bit tainted - but this is one great DVD. While not the original Cavern (long ago ""...buried under a heap of rubble""), the intimate setting helps to showcase Sir Macca's love of pure Rock 'n Roll.
Always a great live performer, Paul puts on a fantastic show in the DVD format. My favs - 'All Shook Up', 'What It Is' and 'No Other Baby.' Check out the Lennonesque, ""youuu"" at the end of 'Baby.'
Yes son, Paul got old as has dad. But as James soon found out - Paul still ROCKS!!",994723200,4,812,4.279220779220779
1425602,5,B00005IA8B,"The concert itself was fantastic - setting viewing records via the Internet, containing a great lineup (besides McCartney, David Gilmour, Mick Green, Ian Paice and Pete Wingfield) - but here, the extras really shine.
First, a 22 minute interview where you learn more than you ever could via the usual celebrity interviews, with their same old questions (Yes, we know that ""Yesterday"" came in a dream...)
Next, a 22 minute ""making of"" documentary much in the same style as his previous ""compilation"" documentaries, ""The World Tonight"", ""Movin' On"" and others.  This one's chock full of great studio footage and personal anecdotes, and isn't even listed on the DVD package as one of the extras.
Then, there's the two complete videos made to promote ""No Other Baby"" and ""Brown Eyed Handsome Man"" - an especially welcome addition for the American fans (and I imagine others) who never get to see these things uncut, and in quality, if at all.  (One hopes Paul will see fit to include the relevant videos on any future re-issues of his older documentaries, to DVD.)
And then there's the concert itself - a wonderful, intimate concert (300 in attendance, in person) - wonderfully recorded, and wonderfully transferred to the DVD.
All in all, there's absolutely nothing which would make this better - a complete, interesting coverage of the ""Run Devil Run"" album and the Cavern Club concert, with great classic rock'n'roll to spare.",993859200,17,1425,5.008438818565401
1425603,3,B00005IA8B,"Being a huge Beatle (and McCartney) fan, I usually buy everything pertaining to them (or him) that I can find.  This would be the one item that might cause me to think twice about spending my hard-earned money. The concert lacks a certain energy and Paul sings a little below pitch throughout.  He was either tired, suffering with throat problems or the monitor system in the new Cavern was poor.  It is so bad that I can hardly get through a single number without cringing!  Also, the accompanying musicians seem to lack assurance and just ""good old Rock and Roll spirit"".  Paul is usually much more inspired than this.  The promotional materials that accompany the concert are great!  I will still watch those a few more times -- probably not the concert.",993772800,2,757,4.6893939393939394
1425604,5,B00005IA8B,"I bought this one at Amazon America 'cause I can't wait till 25th of June (date of release on Europe) to see this mitical concert :) The DVD includes two promo videos, an interview and a promo video with images of recording sessions. Biographies of the band... You know for all Sir Macca fans (and not) this DVD is ""Fabulous""",993427200,,325,4.433333333333334
1425605,5,B00005IA8B,"This concert is definitely worth owning on DVD.  Paul performed in December of 1999 at the Cavern Club in Liverpool as a way of celebrating the end of the year/century/millenium.  It was also a celebration of his career in rock'n'roll.  Hands down, this is the best available live video McCartney has released.  It is brimming with energy and he is in excellent voice-- really belting out these old classics.  Most of the songs were from his '99 album ""Run Devil Run"" (also HIGHLY recommended, especially as a companion piece to this).
The concert includes 13 songs.  Notable musicians accompanying him are Pink Floyd's David Gilmour on guitar, and Deep Purple's Ian Paice on drums.  These guys put their all into these performances, you won't find McCartney rocking out with more abandon in any of his other concert releases.  Unlike the ""Get Back""(1990) and ""Paul is Live""(1993) documents of his world tours, this is not a slick polished presentation-- it's raw, old-fashioned rock'n'roll.
While the concert itself runs only 46 minutes, a couple worthwhile extra features have been included.  Most notable, a 22 minute featurette that documents the making of the ""Run Devil Run"" album, with Paul explaining how the songs were chosen for the album (this includes some in-the-studio footage from the recording sessions).  There is also an entertaining 17 minute interview with Paul giving song-by-song commentary on the songs chosen to be performed in the concert.  Also included are music videos for two songs from ""Run Devil Run"".  These videos are actually pretty interesting and worth seeing, definitely different from other McCartney music videos.  All together, there is a little over 90 minutes on this DVD if you watch everything-- worth the money in my opinion.
Even if you've seen this concert when it was recently broadcast on PBS, you really should pick this up.  The picture is crystal clear and the sound is awesome.",993427200,33,1930,5.0664556962025316
1425606,4,B00005IA8B,"Although it's not exactly THE Cavern (the real one was torn down long ago and reopened at this location just across the street), it's looks to be a small, crowded, hot place. In other words, the perfect place for Sir Paul and his band of various rock alumni to give a show consisting of mostly 50's era rockers. The band is dynamic and Paul performs these songs with the youthful abandon of a 25 year old. Highlights include the new song ""Try Not To Cry"", a rousing ""I Saw Her Standing There"" (the only Beatle song performed here) and the rowdy finale of ""Let's Have A Party"". Of course, ""I Saw Her"" standing does leave you longing for more Beatles (or even Wings) classics, but this setlist poses a refreshing change, and except for the occasional flat/strained note (give the guy a break, he's almost 60), McCartney is in top form. 40 minutes worth of enjoyable interview/promo footage as well as 2 videos round out this disc making it well worth the price of purchase.",993254400,8,971,4.554285714285714
1425607,4,B00005IA8B,"Is really exciting to see McCartney live with a really basic band configuration! But don't get me wrong, the band is great, with David Gilmour and Ian Paice in the back!

Great DVD, is a must!",1206489600,,192,4.333333333333333
1425608,5,B00005IA8B,"I bought this DVD because I had heard David Gilmour of Pink Floyd plays guitar on it. I like PM, but I'm not a huge fan. I was impressed with both. PM has a great singing voice, and his choice of songs here is great. As to Gilmour, he doesn't feature too prominantly in the beginning, but as the DVD goes on he gets great camera time and it is awesome to hear him playing a different style of music than his usual  style, yet still retaining his own distinctive sound. I actually liked this DVD more than I anticipated I would (and I expected a lot from it!). Could have been longer, but the price is good and the musicianship is stellar. I'm jaded on music DVD's since Gilmours Remember That Night- which blows everything I've seen out of the water... but this intimate show is worth having.",1198195200,,792,4.315436241610739
1425609,4,B00005IA8B,"While some might consider Paul McCartney's temporary return to Liverpool to play the Cavern Club to be 'historically significant,' I love this DVD simply because it allows Paul McCartney, David Gilmour, and company to truly rock out with vintage material originally offered up by Eddie Cochran, Chuck Berry, etc. I can't convey how wonderful it is to hear McCartney screaming through old 50s rockers, and to see Gilmour belting out up-tempo rockabilly style solos instead of his trademark slow Brit-rock blues. Yes, everyone in this video is well beyond their youth but that really doesn't matter. This is one of Paul McCartney's best live performances ever and should be a revelation to anyone who only knows David Gilmour through Pink Floyd.

The concert itself is the main attraction. The extras are ok but basic - just band member bios and a lengthy interview with McCartney. I don't think McCartney ever gave a revealing interview, and this is no exception. It's the concert you will return to over and over.

Throughout, McCartney's love for this music shines through. It reminded me a lot of the way Eric Clapton came to life with his ""From the Cradle"" CD. This is a DVD that will be appreciated by anyone who loved the way the early Beatles attacked rock classics with boundless energy and love.",1185321600,2,1303,4.891402714932127
1425610,4,B00005IA8B,"Outstanding show...I have seen McCartney live 7 times and have all of the recent live tour dvd's.  I was reluctant to get this one because the songs are mostly old cover songs I guess from the late 50's and early 60's.  I was very pleased and excited by this performance and the quality of the dvd.  It is very straight forward with none of the usual fluff that you find on dvd's like the Space Between Us, Live from Red Square and Paul is Live. Those all have way to many to shots of the audience singing along to the songs (I don't buy concert dvd's  to see middle aged people proving that they know the words to Get Back) or have intertwined interviews that should be an extra feature that doesn't not interrupt the concert.  This has none of the fluff and is a better show because of it... Must have for McCartney fans.",1171238400,3,823,4.283870967741936

1425612,5,B00005IA8B,"This is an amazing look back into what occupies the minds of ""rock stars"" as they glance back to the music that inspired them.

Lonesome Towm - Ricky Nelson, is an amazing version of the song which at times has a raspy Paul fighting to get the notes out, but he does.

Shake a Hand - Jackie Wilson (who covered Faye Adams from 53) is an amazing showcase of Paul's range and was marvelous in bringing this song into a more of a ""rocker"" style song than the blues version.

Brown Eyed handsome Man - An AMAZING cover of Chuck Berry's song.  David Gilmour's guitar is simply incredible on this piece.

Honey Hush - Big Joe Turner.  This cover version is the kickoff to the DVD and Mick and David's guitarwork is flawless.  Paul's no-nonsense vocals expand on it.

Party - (written by Jesse Mae Robinson for Elvis) is the finale for this DVD. Nothing but 5 guys standing on a stage and simply having fun, whilst kicking rock heine.

This whole DVD is an amazing setlist of ""who's who"" of 50's and early 60's R&B tunes that really DO NOT get much play.

This is a must have for any collection.",1118793600,5,1088,4.341584158415841
1425613,5,B00005IA8B,"Yes McCartney's vocals are strained on a couple of songs, but this is after a year of not singing at all (because of Linda's passing) and over six years of not touring.  Trust me, this DVD rocks, and the enthusiasm is contagious.  It blows away his Russian Rock album from 1987.  A must have for McCartney fans.",1117497600,3,311,4.421052631578948
1425614,5,B00005IA8B,"The ""Run Devil Run"" album was Paul's first attempt at recording since Linda passed away in 1998.  He came through very well, and managed to rok us into the new millenium with this performance.  Yes, he was in his mid-fifties when he recorded it, but don't be so quick to put him down.  He rocked at this concert.  The band is strong and tight, and Paul can still sing well.  A few songs from this DVD are not on the ""Run Devil Run"" album, such as ""Fabulous"" and ""Twenty Flight Rock.""  They are very good as well.  I love this concert, and so will you if you love Paul.",1109289600,5,568,4.155963302752293
1425615,5,B00005IA8B,"Some of the others reviewing this DVD say that they didn't like it, Ringo's better, or some such, but I think this is because they are used to Paul in the post-Beatles mode almost exclusively.  Those of us who are true Beatle fans (and possibly old enough to remember their early days) will consider this DVD most impressive for the raw quality Paul and the boys bring to the fore.  It's a man returning to his roots in grand style.  Bless you and yours, Sir Paul!",1104537600,4,464,4.372093023255814
1425616,3,B00005IA8B,"Just a joke paul...
bought this dvd hoping for something with a bit more sparkle...
Paul Mcartney is one of the best vocalists around...
maybe its because this dvd is more rock n roll orientated...
thats why i don't feel fantastic inside over this dvd, but if you are from the Bill Hayley era of time then this ones a hit for you...
The bonus features swayed me into finding this dvd acceptable... maybe a few more hours playing this disc might convert me a little more...
shame paul didn't sing a few old beatle hits...
so macca you read this its RINGO 1 MACCA 0

His appearance coincided with the Run Devil Run album, and the music is the wonderful rock 'n' roll Paul and his bandmates knew as young men in Liverpool.  So there Paul is in the Cavern, returning to his roots.  The backup band is first rate.  David Gilmour of Pink Floyd and Ian Paice of Deep Purple perform, and every musician is excellent.

7938150,5,B00005IA8B,"Sadly, one of the greatest British electric guitarist ever passed away recently after five decades of showing everyone what rock'n'roll is really all about. This DVD, which is now getting rare, presents a chance to see him at the top of his game with a bunch of amazing fellow musicians, basically folks who were still wet behind their ears when Mick Green was up there on stage with Johnny Kidd, looking on admiringly. Some may argue that Paul McCartney is really the focus of this group, and admittedly the guy is outstanding here, but the style of music from start to finish has very little to do with his outpourings over the years - nor does it sound anything like Pink Floyd or Deep Purple. This is pure British pub rock, as performed by the Pirates as far back as the early 1960s and later on revived by groups like Dr Feelgood in the Seventies and thus an enormous influence on the then emerging punk scene. Let's face it, without Mick Green this music would never have happened the way it did.

This DVD is an excellent way of remembering Mick Green and the enormous influence he, as a true musician's musician, had on British rock. May his legacy never be forgotten and may he rest in peace.",1288483200,,1201,4.509174311926605
