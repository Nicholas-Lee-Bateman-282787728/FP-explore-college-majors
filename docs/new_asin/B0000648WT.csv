1706523,5,B0000648WT,"This is a great DVD!  Singing, Drawing and Telephones are the three segments in this Elmo's World DVD.  Thanks to the Drawing segment, my daughter has really become more interested in drawing and coloring.  I'd say that has been the most educational part of the dvd.  Singing is fun, and the tunes are catchy. The telephone segment goes through a history of the telephone, which is highly entertaining.  What kid doesn't like playing with telephones? Just make sure you have your play-phone handy so they can play right along with Elmo's World. If your child loves Elmo, this DVD is a great pick!",1057449600,26,596,4.747572815533981
1706524,3,B0000648WT,"""Elmo's World"" is a collection of skits that are all Elmo, the cute little furry red monster of recent years on Sesame Street.
My son is 20 months old and loves this video. He has learned the word ""telephone"" from it, which is not an easy word for a child of this age.  Each skit is dedicated to a different topic - singing, drawing, and telephones.
Elmo asks questions such as ""who can sing?"", ""what doesn't draw?"" and ""how does the telephone work?""  Even though some of Elmo's background art work for his world is a bit hard on the eyes, this is a great introduction to these topics for the ages 2 and under.
For me, it is too much Elmo, but it really isn't for me now, is it?
I recommend for the toddlers!!",1031702400,7,709,4.205882352941177
1706525,5,B0000648WT,"I have just about every Elmo's World videos in my collection. My almost 2 year old daughter loves them all. Right now this her her favorite one. This video contains singing, drawing, and telephones. Each episode is about 15 minutes so you can either ration them out or let them watch for the whole 45 minutes (great for getting dinner on the table). I usually watch Elmo with my daughter and point out the silly things Mr. Noodle does, count the objects with her (ie with singing - how many pigs in a quartet...1,2,3,4), and now she tells me what's going on. Highly recommended for all Elmo fans.",998784000,31,596,4.527777777777778

1706528,5,B0000648WT,"As a 34 year old you can guess that I am not a big Elmo fan, but my 2 year daughter just loves him, so I tolerate it by getting her a video from his educational series every month or so. This is about 2 hours long and she often falls asleep while watching it if its on past 3pm unless she already napped that day.  Its typical Elmo's World fare with his introductions and explanations regarding arts and crafts, music, etc. Worth the buy in my kid's eyes I am sure, hence 5 stars.",1430006400,2,480,4.052631578947368

1706550,5,B0000648WT,"My (22-month old) daughter loves Elmo.  To prepare for a cross-country road trip, we purchased this DVD for the back seat.  She had been watching the same two Elmo DVDs for months, so when we put this in, she was captivated!  She's never been so quiet or cooperative in the car.  She loves the songs, watching the kids draw, and the section on telephones has introduced her to something she doesn't see very often anymore (""landlilne"" telephones...or anything other than a cell phone).  Suddenly, she's curious about our house phone, and wants to talk on it all the time.  This is a great DVD!",1402963200,,593,4.653846153846154

1706585,5,B0000648WT,"This was the first one I had bought for my daughter. She had started to enjoy Elmo and I thought I surprise her with this DVD.

She was 20 months old then. And it was a great investment. These Elmo's world DVD's are fun, encourage your child to act and think. Each child will get something different out of it and enjoy it on a different level and way. But these DVD's are worth the money and time spend. Your child will learn and enjoy his friend Elmo and it is such a nice way to let him or her wind down after a busy day of playing outside or just being gone all day. At first my child would just watch the DVD, then she would ask for her crayons to draw with as well and yes she is now actually singing and humming along with the music. Of course not accurately,but the idea has clicked in her head what singing is. AND when Elmo plays his good bye song on his piano my daughter gets her little toddler piano out and drumms and humms along by just pounding those keys. ( not a real piano of course we are talking that kiddy stuff you can buy).

So I would say this is a great investment and heads up to the company for creating this fun Elmo's world selection.",1113782400,17,1164,4.056521739130435

7960568,5,B0000648WT,"Our toddler can't really enunciate her words, yet, but she hums this theme song to let us know she wants to watch Elmo.  Goodness, she loves this show!  I like that she gets to learn about something in a simple format and that the shows are fairly short as we don't let her watch very much TV/videos.  I don't like that Elmo talks in third person-it actually bugs me quite a bit, but I have to look past that as our daughter loves this red monster.",1446854400,,448,4.186046511627907
