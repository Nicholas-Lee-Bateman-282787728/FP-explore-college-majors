I am glad that they are making a new set of Digimon season 5 vol. 2 I do hope that they will do the others soon when they changed toonDisney to Disney XD they took off a lot of good show for ones that are not very good at all.
I do hope that they will put them back on soon some of the show should be on the Disney channel not Disney XD please tell them to fix there channel.

8392200,5,B0039OC0JI,"I ordered this watch several days ago, the packaging was easy to remove and the watch was easy to set up. It's very lightweight and I forget sometimes I'm wearing it. I love that you get notifications for incoming calls messages and you can customize it to get Facebook message as well. I charged it when I got and I only takes about 30 minutes to fully charge. My watch lasted about 4 days on a full battery. I am super happy about this product and will certainly order again.",1454025600,,477,4.311111111111111

8392207,5,B0039OC0JI,"I'm of the same opinion of many reviewers, that the series is great overall, but why did they only collect 26 episodes when the series had 48?

I am hoping that New Video Group acquires the rights to this series so that it can produce the full season.  I was psyched to be able to purchase the first 2 seasons they produced, and have pre-ordered season 3 and season 4.  They seem to be releasing these sets on a 2-3 month cycle (season 2 released 3/26/13, season 3 on 6/11/13, season 4 on 9/10/13), so I'm really hoping for a December release of season 5 (this is just conjecture on my part, I have been able to find no such plans online).

In any case, it is nice to have Agumon as one of the protagonists again, even if it is not the original from seasons 1 and 2.  The series overall kinds of gives off a season 3 vibe (3 main protagonists plus partners, initial real world setting, government agency monitoring digital world incursions).

I'm really glad that Digimon is maintaining its popularity.  I am a long time viewer, able to remember the tough choice I had between watching new episodes of Pokemon on Kids WB and Digimon on Fox Kids.  It is great to be able to share these DVDs with my kids now.  I am also glad that Nickelodeon is going to be showing season 6, Digimon Fusion, at some point in 2013.",1370131200,3,1312,4.300813008130081
