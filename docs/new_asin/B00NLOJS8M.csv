8678975,3,B00NLOJS8M,"If you are a Bounty Hunter, make sure that you take care of all the angles.  It's liable to lead to fatal consequences as our titled hero in this lack lustre Spaghetti Western finds out.  American actor Mark Damon is the man is black in Director Sergio Corbucci's 'RINGO AND HIS GOLDEN PISTOL' aka 'JOHNNY ORO'-1966 but seems to spend a lot of his screen time behind bars till the inevitable climactic shootout.  Ringo takes out three brothers at a church wedding but leaves one alive since he wasn't part of the bounty.  In a rare instance for Euro Westerns, the villains team up with a local Indian tribe bent on revenge for the sheriff in the town of Goldstone who chased them off their land.  The story takes almost 90 minutes to get to the climax and for those fans who have seen it all, it may not be worth it.  Director Corbucci seems not to care for the material scribed by no less than three writers.  The film has a startling hatchet in the head scene but it's not up to his usually intense oaters.  He would redeem himself, however, by following this film with 'DJANGO'-1966 and the rest is history.  Actor Damon who made some low budget features in the states, notably with Director Roger Corman , would pull up his stakes and move to Italy where he would work with great Directors such as Corbucci and Mario Bava among others eventually becoming a successful Producer. Ettore Manni plays the sheriff and would make many more genre films throughout the Sixties.  What saves the film is the cinematography by Riccardo Pallotini who was Director Antonio Margheriti's favorite camera man and a catchy score by Carlo Savina.  It's just an OK time waster boasting better things to come from its Director.  Warner Archive delivers the transfer in a nice 1.85 widescreen negative English Dubbed with a nice Dolby Stereo track to enjoy the music even more with a trailer as its only extra.",1429315200,,1893,4.617910447761194
8678976,3,B00NLOJS8M,"According to his biography on imdb.com, Sergio Corbucci was a film critic turned movie director who supposedly beat Sergio Leone to the spaghetti western stakes, not that impressive when the actual first spaghetti western was Richard Blasco's 1965 ""Gunfight at Red Sands"" starring Richard Harrison.  But Corbucci's (""Django"") 1966 western, ""Ringo and His Golden Pistol"" (AKA: ""Johnny Oro"") (he also directed in 1966 the Civil War western, ""The Hellbenders"" starring Joseph Cotton) is riddled with poor film-making from inept costuming, dubbing, etc. and even continuity.  But the film has a golden quality of inventiveness which makes it a winner as a deserving entry in the canon of interesting and exciting spaghetti westerns of note.  Warner Archive has released this M-G-M release and the film stars Mark Damon (""Roger Corman's ""The Young Racers"") who plays the main character very well.  The film co-stars Ettore Manni as the sheriff.  The unusual story and screenplay are by A. Bolzoni and F. Rossetti.  Ennio Morricone need not worry about Carlo Savina's music usurping his reputation.  Corbucci's work is definitely notable and innovative, but this entry does not rank as tops except as an exciting and compelling spaghetti western that probably could have used a bigger budget and more time and attention paid to detail.  The MOD Warner Archive edition is in Eastmancolor.  Look for it at bargain basement prices.",1411516800,2,1422,5.2844444444444445
