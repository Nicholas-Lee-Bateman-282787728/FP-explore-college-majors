There's a cameo by The Bee Gees singing a parody of their own ""To Love Somebody"", trying to raise money for John Wayne Bobbitt. ""The Addadicktome Foundation"" raised somewhere in the neighbourhood of $100,000 if I'm not mistaken.

Also notable sketches are Stern as Michael Jackson and as Ted Danson in a blackface parody while Sherman Helmsley played Whoopi. This was, of course, during the scandal when the two actors were dating.

There was a talent contest for the very first ""Miss Howard Stern"", now an annual staple. The beauty pageant was judged by Janis Ian, Daniel Carver, John Bobbitt, Sherman Hemsley, Mark Hamill, Tiny Tim and Joe Frazier.

This video is a hilarious must see for any Howard Stern fan who collects his work, but the VHS-only release knocks it down to only three stars.",1366761600,5,859,4.74496644295302
8176559,1,B000NBGBI6,"Well...now I've seen everything...who cares about Howard's New Years Eve? I remember when he lived in Gaithersburg, Maryland and lanky Howard would run hunched over from his apartment with a scared look on his face when he had just started doing radio in D.C., to get into his van and then lock his doors as if someone was going to get him. That was pathetically sad...I hope all his New Years weren't rotten like 1994's...ehhh...they probably were.",1342483200,,449,4.8441558441558445
