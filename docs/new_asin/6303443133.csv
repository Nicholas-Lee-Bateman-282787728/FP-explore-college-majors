644860,4,6303443133,"I was skeptical about McCarthy playing a bad guy, but he was surprisingly fantastic!  The greatest discovery of this film is Bruce Greenwood, who is terrific as a police detective; flirty and shallow pursuing the female detective, then focused on the crime and her attraction to the suspect, and in a frightening confrontation with the killer, terrifically vulnerable (what a mess makeup made of his handsome face!).  I've seen him in a variety of films (occasionally not recognizing him from previous films) and consider him to be one of the finest actors around.  See him in ""Double Jeopardy"", ""The Color of Courage"", ""Father's Day"", and ""The Little Kidnappers"".  He was also absolutely excellent in ""Thirteen Days"" - he's not recognized enough .....",1025049600,16,752,5.139344262295082
644861,4,6303443133,"I must say, 'Dream Man' was a great movie for a cable tv movie (I think HBO) or a direct to video release. I liked seeing Andrew McCarthy playing the bad guy for a change from being a 'naive' boy (Class), a rich high school kid (Pretty in Pink), a comedic banker walking around with a dead man (Weekend At Bernie's) and many other McCarthy classics. it was a change to see and it would've been good for him to get more roles like that. Kind of a new image for himself. Patty Kensit (Lethal Weapon 2) portrays a psychic cop who falls for a dead victim's husband (McCarthy) while in suspicion, he may be the killer. Even thoughg the price is large, is till say you at least buy this movie and add it to your collection.",976492800,4,717,4.202898550724638
7846860,2,6303443133,Patsy Kensit can't close her mouth. She has such a short upper lip that it must be impossible for her to put her lips tohether.  So she has her mouth open all the time. This bothers me to no end.,1466294400,,195,3.875
7846861,2,6303443133,Best part of the movie is Patsy Kensit,1461024000,,38,3.875
7846862,3,6303443133,"Typical story of a bondage & dominion loving female who enjoys dressing up as a nun for sex at night while working during the day as a police detective whose psychic visions cause her to disregard department protocol, ferret out impossibly elusive clues and find ""romance."" Focus is mainly on the psychic detective stuff and not the B&D. I assume guys wrote this because at one point the two blonde females have a ""cat fight.""

No foul language. A few scenes with nudity and sexual innuendo. Some images of blood and a bit of violence, but nothing super gory.

Basically, if Lifetime and a telenovela had a baby who took drugs and alcohol it would be this movie. Not as engaging as I would like, but good for a watch if you seek something mildly entertaining running in the background while you work.",1447027200,,800,4.5874125874125875

7846866,3,6303443133,"The best part of this movie was seeing Andrew McCarthy play a bad guy.  The premise was predictable, but seeing it all unfold was somewhat interesting.  The title didn't really fit the movie, but neither did the ""cover"" picture.
Overall, not very memorable.",1417392000,,257,4.953488372093023
7846867,3,6303443133,Interesting para-normal thriller but with a bad Oh Henry ending that you could see coming from a mile and a half.  Some decent sex scenes,1404864000,,137,4.48
7846868,3,6303443133,"The movie isn't as gripping as I had hoped, although it did have several twists in the plot.  I normally can figure the plot about halfway through a mystery movie, and this one kept me guessing.",1376870400,5,194,4.388888888888889
7846869,5,6303443133,Great suspense murder mystery with psychic visions thrown in.  I really enjoyed it.  It's a keep for sure.  Great actors.,1373673600,5,121,4.95
