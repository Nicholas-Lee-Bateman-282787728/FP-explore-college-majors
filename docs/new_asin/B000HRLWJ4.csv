8140968,5,B000HRLWJ4,"Great video. Very easy to go by. Could have a slower speed for the fingering, but over all a great vid",1384041600,,102,3.9047619047619047
8140969,3,B000HRLWJ4,"While I saw merit in the lessons contained on this DVD, I felt that the lesson plan went from ""here's a tin whistle"" to ""here's a fairly complex tune at pace"" in one chapter.  I play Great Highland Bagpipes and one thing I've learned is that playing slowly, then working up to speed is paramount to proper learning.  My recommendation is that, if you already play and want to learn a couple of tunes and watch Vinnie play, this is your vid.  If you want to LEARN how to play, better to wait on this one!",1311120000,5,503,4.21875
