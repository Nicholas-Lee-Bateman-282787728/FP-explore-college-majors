2019187,1,B0001NBLY0,"There is a very ever present core of movie goers, who have a fairly big aversion to hollywood's attempted potrayals of war. They see hollywood as being mainly subserviant to a fairly uneducated populus, who would rather see big explosions and giant waving flags, accompanied by sappy patriotic hyms that give some type of gruesome forced finality to all the carnage. Guess what, i'm not one of these reptilian brained individuals. Sure i've watched a couple good italian porn flicks, but i can't always be civilized... Saving private ryan, with its almost nonexistent script, and buckets of gore, peppered with terrible historical innacuracies, is yet another vestige of the cancer of hollywood war movies.
There is a difference between a combat movie, and a war movie. Combat movies i.e. ""missing in action"" or ""rambo III"", are mindless, popcorn fares that give you a thrill that also temporarily unlock your more basic primate fascination toward death and destruction. Hell, i used to love chuck norris films too.
But when combat movies are dressed up and presented as ""war"" movies, then someone, somewhere, has overstepped a bound. A successful war film shows combat of course. But more importantly, a truly great war film conveys the mental horrors of the institution of war, not simply plenty of bad guys getting blown away to the glee of the wide eyed audience. Tough men should be torn to pieces, quiet and gentle men turned into raving psychopaths. And lastly, the way comradery, and unlikely friendships are formed should be another great theme. But guess what? Most hollywood fares, private ryan included, rarely venture into this forbidden territory. Maybe a trace of it is found, here and there, as in a couple brief moments in ""saving private ryan"", but the whole point is mainly missed. Instead, we have the not so coincidental nationalist propaganda stuffed in, extolling how great america is, and how everyone should drown out the blood soaked realities of the world we live in to stand up and give the pledge of allegiance.
And this is to one of the previous reviewers who said D-day was the most crucial battle of the second world war. Just to clarify things, the d-day invasion wasn't nearly as deciding a factor in the war, as a little offensive known as ""operation bagration"", the code name for the june 22nd soviet summer offensive near novgorod. Over 6,000 aircraft, 3,000 tanks, 24,000 artillery pieces, and probably over a million men were involved. This final push which cost the german army group center more men than the battle of stalingrad, tore a path for the russian army through eastern europe, and finally into berlin. Read your history.

2019188,5,B0001NBLY0,"I know many people might not agree or like this since some people seem to have an aversion to Spielberg.  As a film and just looking at it and seeing the story it is a great one.  It looks excellent.  The accuracy is for the most part dead on with a few exceptions like putting the captain's bars on Tom Hanks' helmet.  This is a ""Hollywood"" thing so that he stand out even more as the leader kinda thing.  Real officers would not distinguish themselves in war time as they would be more likely to be pointed out and killed.  I thought it was amazing that this is inspired on a true story (Niland Brothers) and I really enjoyed this amongst modern war movies since there aren't any good ones lately like the old classics.",1087603200,4,721,4.303703703703704
2019189,4,B0001NBLY0,"Saving Private Ryan is not just any war movie. Its THE MOVIE that will take you places, an extra-ordinary journey of 8 men embark on a mission to save 1. And the meaning of what they believe in what they are fighting for.
Watching this movie was an experience. I enjoyed a lot of how Steven Spielberg did his research well and how he directs a mood that is so real as if it had happen during WWII.
I have no complains about this collection set. Saving Private Ryan: D-Day Edition had both DTS & normal 5.1 Stereo in it. With the bonus disc feature on short documentaries during the filming of SPR, it wasn't much but yet simple. Then there is 2 other DVDs short documentaries about WWII which I have yet to delve myself into.
Still, its worth it when you get this collection boxset. I can guarantee you that if you enjoy Saving Private Ryan movie alone, you will enjoy the bonus discs and the featurettes included with this set. Better buy it fast before it runs out.",1086825600,17,967,4.348066298342541
2019190,5,B0001NBLY0,"June 6th, 1944 D-Day the largest military campaign of the 20th century , 60 years ago from Sunday June 6th, 2004 to the day
thousands of allied forces along with the most miltary equipment
in the history of mankind for one purpose to liberate France from
German occupation , the single most defining battle of World War
2, it would be a success but not with out it's price the ultimate
price for allied forces and americans of our greatist generation
would be the highest price. For those that survived they would see
things that most of us would never see and some things that they
would never want to see again , but some would go to continue to fight in the pacific and other battles of World War 2. It is the
courage and bravery of these men that will stand the test of time and be rememberd for many generations from both the D-Day
and World War 2 memoreals. It is also these men who would inspire
Steven Speilberg to make his 1998 masterpeice Saving Private Ryan where it's amazing first 28 minutes of the film alone is
a living tribute to the men who fought on the beaches of Normandy that fateful day. The violence may be extreme but this
is the closest to the real thing that your going to get. Tom Hanks
is Capt. Miller him and his platoon have orders to secure the beach for the rest of the forces. When he does the miltary soon finds out that 3 brothers have died in combat and Pvt. James
Ryan is the 4th brother who is missing Capt. Miller is given orders to find him and get him out of the war when loosing
some of his men under his command , when loosing these men
he feels that all of this may not be worth the trouble. When
they finally do find him , him and his men are angry and
weary from battle , Pvt. Ryan(Matt Damon) is told and refuses
to go with Capt. Miller and instead plans to secure a bridge
that must be taken to stop the Germans, Capt Miller and
his men see that there is no choice but to stay and fight
along side Ryan , and Capt. Miller and his men beging to
realize that Pvt. Ryan is also someones son and also is
worth much more then what they came there to do in this
stirring tribute to the men that fought in World War 2.
  This set includes Saving Private Ryan:60 th Annaversary
Edition in Dts as well as two documentarys , Price For Peace
and Shooting War two absolutely brillant documentarys from
the team of Steven Speilberg,Steven Ambrose,and Tom Hanks to
give you an actual veiw of World War 2,these are great companion
peices to a brillant film and the best World War 2 film of all time now the men of World War 2 will live on when you watch this

2019254,2,B0001NBLY0,"Firstly The Dirty Dozen is 1.85:1 letterboxed inside a 4:3 frame. Horrible and shame on Warner Brothers.

Secondly I seriously suggest you play all the movies upon receiving them. I recently (by mistake) purchased 2 copies of Warner Brothers World War II collection volume 2. Both copies of The Hill were faulty and produced disc errors. Amazon did send out 2 replacement sets that worked although to get a refund I had to send the originals back within 2 weeks. Amazon would pay $15 towards postage however this is way short of the exorbitant postage charged by Aus Post so it wasn't worth sending them back (I'll try and sell the good movies to recover costs).  When I received my copy of  Warner Brothers World War II collection volume 1 I discovered that The Big Red One is faulty.  I have always thought of WB as being good quality but the last few purchases have changed my mind.

2019257,5,B0001NBLY0,"Battleground (1949, b/w) is a solid war movie about the 10st Airborne at Bastogne (it won two Academy Awards: Best Cinematography and Best Story and Screenplay). While it has a bit of the stereotypical in terms of the squad personalities and  squad dialogue, the film really is grounded in the real and the loss and hardships of war. The Dirty Dozen is a classic and star-filled tale about criminals and misfits sent on a suicide mission. Trini Lopez (musician) Clint Walker(Cheyenne), Telly Savalas (Kojack), Jim Brown (football), and Charles Bronson(Deathwish) are some of the more memorable cast members. The Battle of the Bulge, starring Henry Fonda and Robert Ryan is a solid and realistic version ot this important tank duel where the Germans suprise the Americans and force them to engage in a desperate action. Where Eagles Dare lets Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood try to free a U.S. General from a German Alpine fortress--the film is well-done with some real suspense, twists and turns, and, of course, many Germans biting the dust in several pitched gun battles. Great as all these films may be, the best film by far is The Big Red One (1980) directed by combat veteran Samuel Fuller. Lee Marvin shines as the tough U.S. First Infantry  sergeant who leads his squad from North Africa to Normandy and into Germany. The film pulls no punches in showing the fierceness of war, but this is mitigated by the closeness of the G.I.s in Marvin's squad. The version here adds over 40 minutes to the original film; it is in color, it is gripping in its realism, and it has epic sweep. This set includes these five films that cover several cinematic approaches and subjects. There is not a clunker in the bunch. Good to great World War Two films for a great price. If you like war films, you will enjoy this set!",1358899200,5,1814,4.737341772151899

2019282,5,B0001NBLY0,"My son saw ""Saving Private Ryan"" at school when he was in the 4th grade.  HE WAS NINE.  His teacher was a a decorated veteran, so I excused the obvious error in judgement.  Several years later, when the nightmares stopped, he actually does have quite an interest in the history of the war.  These movies are interesting from a historical perspective, and but much more appropriate for an older teenager or adult.  They were an excellent value as well.  Go ahead and buy them, just don't let your elementary schooler watch.",1334361600,4,522,4.681318681318682
2019283,5,B0001NBLY0,"I am a big fan of the Big Red One movie with Lee Marvin, and I always knew the movie likely had been editted horribly or cut short for t.v., then I see this movie set with four other movies, good ones, locally for just $20, and yeah, I got lucky at that price, but full price would be okay for this set if one didn't have Battleground like I didn't, nor Eagles Dare, and especially not a reconstructed ""Big Rdd One"" version which is the shining star of this collection, don't miss out, cause I know what alot of folks think about the horribly editted version of the movie, but this is the restoration, the best they could do with what they had, some stuff from the widow of the director.  Remember, Lee Marvin was a WW2 Pacific War veteran who got his foot heel pretty much shot off.
Battleground is a battle of the bulge presentation of the airborne divisions, like ""Band of Brothers"", but just a movie length early presentation of the US forces of that time, and if I am remembering rightly, seems some real former veterans of that campaign and the airborne divisions were called upon to play in this movie, and I didn't own it previously.  An unforgettable scene, ""forget what basic training taught you, just shoot back if you can't see them"", from the scene where a newer soldier had to just shoot his m1 garand blindly into the treeline, and surprisingly he gets a german who was shooting from cover of darkness.  How about the scene where a us soldier is shot and cries ""mom, mom"", well, a stark reality in wartime for especially young soldiers, they had some shot germans suddenly calling ""mutti, mutti""(mother, mother).  Battle of the Bulge, a commander inspects a german ""sturmgewehr"" mp44, the first assault rifle, and comments it hasn't even ever been shot, off a young german likely used as a decoy to be captured.
These are the movies before cgi, and before they had plenty of mock up tanks to look like the real thing, and if they use an m48 tank from the fifties, or captured arab/russian soviet tanks lent by Israel, oh well, at least it aint CGI(computer graphics interface), but the real thing, be thankful, it was a more simple world back then in the 40's to 80's.",1285977600,5,2183,4.505050505050505

You guys think that the story is unrealistic you guys know nothing about World War 2 and if you want to know the true story go ask the vets or study World War 2 more and the bad and mixed reviews are pointless and you guys often misunderstood so before you guys write a complaint please make sure you finished studying World War 2 and the people who hadn't watched it ignore the ones who dislike this film and buy it and the complaints are irritating and pointless and the story of the Niland Brothers will still be around.",1280534400,3,818,4.25

2019289,4,B0001NBLY0,"I'm sure there are statistics out there somewhere that could verify it, but my guess is that more movies have been done about World War II than any other war.  Certainly, if you wanted to come up with a boxed set of movies about the War of 1812, you'd be hard-pressed to come up with one (the only one that comes to mind is The Buccaneer, dealing with Andrew Jackson, Jean Lafitte and the Battle of New Orleans).  The WWII boxed set, Battlefront Europe, provides a sampling of stories taking place in the European Theater of Operations.

The first two movies in the set (based on when they were made) both deal with the Battle of the Bulge, that last real offensive by the Germans.  Battleground is the better of the two, focusing on one group of soldiers involved in a battle that's bigger than they can fully grasp; they just do their part.  As in all of these movies, some will live and some will die.  The Battle of the Bulge is one of those all-star, big budget epics that Hollywood produced in the late sixties and early seventies (others include A Bridge Too Far and The Longest Day) that were often big on spectacle and short on real substance.  The Battle of the Bulge has its moments but it is almost too ambitious and makes it seem like Henry Fonda's character was solely responsible for winning the battle (and maybe the war).  Other stars include Charles Bronson, Dana Andrews, Telly Savalas and Robert Ryan.

Ryan, Bronson and Savalas would also be in the next movie, the fictional Dirty Dozen, in which Lee Marvin plays a plays-by-his-own-rules major who fashions a team of convicted soldiers to perform a special mission prior to D-Day.  If they succeed, they get their freedom.  While it is entertaining, it does take a long time to get to the actual mission.  On the other hand, in the other truly fictional movie in the set - Where Eagles Dare - the mission kicks in almost immediately.  In this movie, Richard Burton leads a small crew of soldiers (including a young Clint Eastwood) on a raid of a German castle where an American general is being held prisoner.  There are some twists, however, in exactly what the mission is supposed to accomplish (from a plotting standpoint, this is easily the most sophisticated movie in the set).

Finally, there is The Big Red One, more specifically, the reconstructed version that adds close to an hour to the movie.  The title refers to the insignia worn by the soldiers who are the principals in this movie, that of the U.S. 1st Infantry.  Lee Marvin plays a grizzled sergeant (and WWI veteran) who leads a group of soldiers in what seems like every major battle in the ETO (as well as North Africa).  I have not seen the original version, so I can't fully say whether the longer version is an improvement, but it is a decent movie.

In fact, all of these movies are decent, though not outstanding.  I think if you were creating your own boxed set of WWII movies, none of these would make the top five, though not all would miss the cut by much.  There are a few extras in the set, including some ""making of"" features and a commentary on The Big Red One.  Overall, I'm rating this four stars:  it's worth watching, but it's not the best there is.",1218326400,13,3208,4.521663778162911
2019290,5,B0001NBLY0,"This is a great collection of WWII movies. They are individually packaged movies. The Big Red One: Great movie with Lee Marvin, this version is the extended edition more like a directors cut. They did a very good job on bringing the old footage back into the movie and cleaning it up so that everything looks like it belongs. Excellent movie captures the flavor of surviving small infantry group during WWII. The Battle of the Bulge, great action movie. Not Historically accurate but a good blend of action and adventure. The Dirty Dozen, great movie worth owning all by itself the fact that you get packaged with other movies is just gravy. Battleground, maybe the original Band of Brothers from 1949. Won 2 Academy awards. A good movie that shows the hardships of being a soldier.
Where Eagles Dare, you may have to watch this one two or three times just so you don't miss all the surprises and plot twist.

Battleground is the story of a small group of doughboys stuck in the Argonne, basically surrounded by Germans, and their fight for survival.  Where Eagles Dare is about a group of highly trained soldiers trying to destroy a fortress in the Alps controlled by the Germans; however, a mole and high ranking officer overseeing the operation want the group to fail.  The Dirty Dozen is a war classic about criminals given a respite to carry out a basically suicide mission against a host of high ranking German officers",1163116800,4,652,4.701754385964913

2019316,4,B0001NBLY0,"Is ""Saving Private Ryan"" a great WW II movie?  Yes it is. Was the Battle of D-Day the greatest campaign of the war? No, it wasn't. D-Day and the period leading up to it and the campaign through France was a tremendous effort that brought men close to greatness, but it pales compared to the efforts on the Russian Front or the American assault on Okinawa. As Lt. John Eisenhower said in a toast in Moscow, shortly after the war was over, ""I propose a toast to the man responsible for winning the War... the common Russian soldier."" So lay off Cyrus, another reviewer who is flamed here.

Everyone should see ""Saving Private Ryan,"" especially those who don't appreciate what it took to beat the Germans and the Japanese. They don't know how close we came to losing World War II and living in HELL for generations afterward. The men and women who fought in this War against the Axis powers are true heroes, whether they be Americans, Russians, British, Indians, Filippinos, or dozens of other nationalities. The hell that hundreds of thousands went through is conveyed in ""Saving Private Ryan.""

""Saving Private Ryan"" is more than just a combat film. The opening and ending scenes tell us that these were real people, with families, hopes and dreams. And so many of the men and women who fought the Axis never realized those dreams, for they bought freedom with their lives. Other scenes within the movie tell us that the men we are watching on the screen are more than just trained killers, but ordinary guys who just want to go home again.

But if you want to see the greatest movie about World War II, I suggest&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Best-Years-of-Our-Lives/dp/0792846133/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Best Years of Our Lives</a>&nbsp;It won eight academy awards, but it didn't have one scene of combat as it took place immediately after the end of the War. I saw ""Saving Private Ryan"" once, and that is enough. I can never see ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" enough times. Two other truly great films about World War II are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Walk-in-Sun-1945-B-W/dp/B00006L90X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Walk in Sun (1945) (B&W)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-in-the-Gray-Flannel-Suit/dp/B0009NZ2OW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit</a>. Like ""The Best Years of Our Lives,"" these are stories about War and how it changes men.",1111881600,10,2535,5.576623376623377
2019317,5,B0001NBLY0,"Saving Private Ryan, wow. This film REALLY grabs you in every way. It is dark, violent, and realistic to it's brutal extreme. It is also a beautiful work of art by masterful director Steven Spielberg, and the crew that made E.T., Artificial Intelligence, Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones, Schindler's List, etc...

You must see the movie, I don't care which edition you buy, ""although this set is pretty neat!""",1110844800,5,406,4.970588235294118
2019318,5,B0001NBLY0,"This movie, whether it is 100% accurate or not, should be very moving to all Americans.  The intent was to honor the sacrifices of our greatest generation, and give us all a glimpse of the terror those men faced.  This movie was, and should be, life-changing.  If it doesn't stack up to your intellectually superior standards, please just refrain from comment instead of undermining it's honorable intent...",1102032000,8,407,5.044776119402985
2019319,5,B0001NBLY0,"Saving Private Ryan set the standard for what we, the public, expect in a war flick.  The combination of special effects, grusome reality, well placed action, well scripted acting.  SPR doesn't shouldn't be mistaken, as others have suggested, as to what war is really like, but to let you see through the memories of what war veterans look back upon.  The comradery, the loss of friends, the carnage and brutality of war.  This isn't for the tea-sippin' sissy college student who think they have the answer to life but yet to get one, so, in other words, this isn't for a person who likes ""the thin red line"".  If you want anti-war and anti-patriotic flicks, see ""All's Quiet on the Western Front""  Saving Private Ryan is successful at showing us what AMERICANS had to go through during the Normandy campaign.  Not British, Russian, or cheese-eating frenchies, but AMERICAN.  We made this movie, CYRUS, so if you want to see a movie about the russians in WWII, why don't you ask them to make one.  Hollywood is in America, they make movies for AMERICANS, because we want them and will pay alot of money to see them.",1098144000,7,1115,4.6479591836734695
2019320,3,B0001NBLY0,"Private ryan was a decent war flick, but was it the best? I wouldn't go that far. It was bloody and all, but it didn't have very good writing. Tom hanks is also overrated in this movie. This film doesn't compare to movies like ""das boot"", ""the thin red line"", or ""cross of iron"". The reviewer down below should take a chill pill, you don't prove your case by using tons of exclamation points and by calling people names. We all have opinions, and they should be respected.",1089936000,11,472,4.375

The packing leaves much to be desired, though; the 9 discs are stacked on a spindle without any protection.  Of course, it is the packing that allows the low cost.  And it is a good price. I wanted to buy five of the films here, and, together, they would have cost me at least twice as much.
