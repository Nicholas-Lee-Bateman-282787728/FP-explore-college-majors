8122532,5,B000FH8ANM,"The Life and Loves of a She-Devil

Truly one of the most chilling mini-series' I've ever seen. The term black comedy does not even begin to describe the performances and just how good this was.  The transformation of Ruth is a truly gifted performance by Butler. As she is slowly transforms from the proverbial toad into the mirror image of Mary Fisher. You can tell by the vacant and slightly insane look in Bobbo's eyes near the end of the last installment that her vengeance on this man is never going to be complete and that he realizes this also, on some level. While not listed here on  Amazon, watch for Tom Baker, (a.k.a. Dr Who), as the Priest that Ruth seduces, a very good performance by the both of them.

To those of us who were subjected to the poorly done, poorly acted and poorly written American remake of the same name, I feel your pain. The differences between the two shows is akin to the difference between an ultra light beer and a frothy Guinness. Only the names of the characters names have remained the same most everything else has changed.

As you maybe able to tell from some of my generalized statements it has been around 25 years since I last watched, ""The Life and Loves of a She-Devil"", and these are just some of the highlights that I can recall.  I have been looking for this set in Region 1 Format, (or the VHS equivalent), since I first viewed this series back in the late 80's, probably around 25 years and still am still looking. I may just order a DVD player and power converter from Europe in order to see this again. I understand some of the better Blue Ray Players are Multi-Region capable. Additionally, I have been told that many computers, (but not mine!), will allow you to play multi-region DVD's. This may be as simple as a software fix of something far more complex. I just don't know, my ""Geekness"" does not manifest itself in that direction.

I thoroughly recommend, ""The Life and Loves of a She-Devil"", however, if you and your spouse are having a troubled marriage and or relationship, maybe not so much. :0.

8122533,4,B000FH8ANM,"This British video series is a most unusual, fascinating film and is definitely a ""keeper"".  I don't know why it has not been formatted for use in the USA.  And because it is a Region 2 DVD, you must have a ""Code Free DVD player to view it.  Such a player is available from INTERNATIONAL TV & ELECTRONICS on line.  I bought a modified Toshiba SD-4100 from them for $65 or so, including shipping.  It will play dvd's from Regions 1 -8.  However, if it needs to be repaired, it must be sent back to the seller as local (US) stores will not/cannot repair it.
I bought the only available version (Region 2) of ""The Life & Loves Of A She-Devil and it plays perfectly on the modified Toshiba machine and viewed on my 'Made For U.S.' television.
As for the quality of the DVD itself, it has a typical British soundtrack (mediocre), now loud, now soft, requiring constant use of the tv volume control.  The picture quality isn't bad, probably standard for a 1986 British 'Made For TV' movie.
I haven't included a review of the film as several are already included on this site. I would rate it as a three or three & a half star film.",1264550400,2,1125,4.328571428571428

20 years later, the magic is still there... I love it!",1225152000,2,102,3.6818181818181817
8122536,5,B000FH8ANM,"I saw this on A&E many years ago. Great character development, a thorough treatment that does not stray from the novel.  What a pity it is not available on DVD in the US. I guard my video copy of this movie like it is made of gold.",1195430400,6,231,3.9148936170212765
8122537,5,B000FH8ANM,"I saw this years ago on television, and it is vastly superior to (and much darker than) the American film version starring Roseanne Barr.
Hodge was wonderful. And unlike the American version, this one left me feeling somehow unsettled (to say why might involve spoilers, so I'll leave it at that). There's a lot more to think about here, than the shallow, more plot-driven story told in the US version.

Now it's available, but not in Region 1 format. Damn!",1193788800,10,457,4.7125
8122538,5,B000FH8ANM,"After searching for a copy of the original Life and Loves of a She-Devil off and on for nearly 20 years now and being constantly surprised it never turned up in the A&E store (the network that broadcast the series here in the US) I was recently thrilled to see the long wait was finally over as the BBC had released the series to DVD.

Although presented in PAL format, which means it won't play on your home  DVD player here in the US, the She-Devil faithful  are in luck as the disks  will play just fine on your home computer. Unlike DVD players your computer doesn't care about formats.  The Sonic CinePlayer program that came pre-installed on my new Dell Inspiron even launches itself automatically when either disk is inserted.

So if you've been dying to own this movie for years and don't mind going to just a tiny bit more trouble to watch it at the PC instead of on TV your long wait is now over. The movie is just as much fun now as I remembered it being the last time I watched it years ago.

Enjoy!",1192147200,12,1011,4.261780104712042
8122539,5,B000FH8ANM,"This is the better version of this story.  The later, short version with Roseanne Barr and Meryl Streep isn't as interesting despite Streep.

This original was shown on American TV through either PBS or A & E.  It was many episodes.  It enravelled very gradually but much more realistically than the American version.  I can't believe it hasn't been rendered to the North American format.  This format nonsense is a real nuisance!",1175904000,18,430,4.902777777777778
