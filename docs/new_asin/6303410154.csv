7845933,3,6303410154,"Absent from this film is Percy Kilbride as Pa Kettle.  However, Arthur Hunnicutt plays his brother Sedge rather well (though this raises some plot issues with the Waikiki film).  And while Percy may be gone, Charles Lamont  directs this one (he directed 3 of the best Kettle films: Further  Adventures, Go to Town, and On Vacation), salvaging the film to some  degree.  This film doesn't have quite the same humor as the other Lamont  films, though, and suffers from Pa's abscence.  There is the screwball  routine wih the bootleggers that carries some of the trademark feel, and  Marjorie Main is still in top form...but overall the simple plot and  limited cast make this a lesser Kettle title.",962409600,15,696,4.863247863247863
