8333767,5,B001PLPK2G,"I bought this movie because my four year old loves anything Mario&Luigi!  Luigi is his favorite.  I feel it is appropriate for the smaller children.  It does not have any of your normal ""Nick Jr."" type education going on though.  Still I have no problems with this movie and I'm glad I made the purchase.  We have since collected about 4 more out of the series.  These movies brings the game they've been playing to a different level and let's them ""get to know"" the characters!  I would reccommend buying for any child who likes Mario!  If they like the game they will like the movie!",1337299200,3,585,4.452830188679245
