8136930,3,B000H6HMWG,"The cover shows Gary Richrath with the old REO. The actual concert you get is a post 2000 REO with the current member line-up. It is footage from one concert, not the best live from 1978-1982. Deceiving advertisement but still a good concert for all REO fans.",1259193600,,259,4.531914893617022
8136931,4,B000H6HMWG,"The date at the end of the film is ""CMC"" which I'm sure means 1990.  At the end the lead singer thanks the audience of Saint Louis.  I couldn't find any of that info on the box, or in the ad.  I was disappointed that it was not concert footage from 1978-1982.  I guess the title was purposely misleading as well as the pix on the box.  I'm not a fan of REO, never have been, but I have a friend who is, and I bought it for him.  Although I do know all their hit songs, and I did watch some of the film.  They were great.  Their live versions were better than some live performances on TV I remember from back in the day.  Also the box has a lot of Asian lettering on it, so I think we can assume it is an import.  Good show, worth the $20.  Production: excellent.  Picture and sound: studio quality, but in Full Screen.  Stage and lighting: world class; a truly great show, and the crowd was into it too.  Track list: Don't let him go, music man, take it on the run, keep pushin', can't fight this feeling, tough guys, that ain't love, time for me to fly, rock on the road again, keep on loving you, roll with the changes, ridin' the storm out, 127 riverside avenue.",1207785600,5,1166,4.057017543859649
8136932,1,B000H6HMWG,"This video is not REO Speedwagon of 1978-1982, despite what the photo on the cover and back of DVD case show. The small print on the back cover shows the performing members of this concert, which appears cut from the Arch Allies video with Styx. I could be wrong on that but the band that appears is the 2000 REO, not 1978-1982. Kevnin Cronin's voice is weak and nasally, just as it was when I saw them in concert 3 years ago. I wanted vintage REO captured live and this is NOT IT! It is 13 songs from that era and not close to the 175 minutes advertised.",1171238400,19,555,4.148148148148148
