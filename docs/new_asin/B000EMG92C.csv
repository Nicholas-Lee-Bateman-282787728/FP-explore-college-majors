8111119,4,B000EMG92C,Definitely an unusual movie. Definitely a fun movie and really a very interesting movie about chess. it had its funny moments and still held onto some basic chess information. Nicholas Wright pulls off the droll lead as he should be. Nothing phases him and he just moves forward. Rachelle Lefevre is wonderful as the girl that takes an interest in the newcomer.,1439769600,,361,4.838709677419355
8111120,4,B000EMG92C,"Here's an absurd switcheroo, and I'm sensing a definite satiric vibe here. The Hatley High Knights are the most feared high school sports team around, comprised of taunting bullies and gynormous egos...  and these Knights' sport is chess. Yeah. Chess. Hatley High has got it all backwards. The chess players are the swaggering jocks, the basketball players are the geeks (the one kid who's really good at hoops actually dreams of being a surfer). Looking for a fresh start after his mother's passing, Tommy Linkletter moves into the small town of North Hatley and right away upends Hatley High's status quo, threatens to upstage the mighty chess team's arrogant captain. See, Tommy's gifted mother was a local legend, a teen chess prodigy until she gave it up after a devastating loss to the Russian chess team in 1976. Now the pressure's on Tommy to live up to expectations. Tommy wants no part of this, would rather perform his little magic tricks. Except he may not have a choice. Because the Russians are coming for a rematch.

If this Canadian indie gets you curious about the game of chess, then it's done its job. HATLEY HIGH is quirky and serenaded with a cool indie soundtrack, and it makes no pretenses about keeping it real. For me, the standout actor in this good cast is Rachelle Lefevre. She makes her mark effortlessly as the unsinkable cheerleader Hyacinthe Marquez. And, by ""unsinkable,"" I'm not implying that she swims really, really well or is so fat that she acts as her own flotation device. Hyacinthe is one of those sunny, sassy, initiative-grabbing girls whom you sometimes bitterly hate because she won't hesitate to wreck your plans to just chill on the couch all the live-long day. In this film's fun teen romance, Hyacinthe does most of the heavy lifting. Our guy Tommy Linkletter settles for being laid back.

In its offbeat sensibility (otherwise known as Canadian humor) HATLEY HIGH shares more in common with, say, NAPOLEON DYNAMITE. So it's not what you'd call a commercial film. There's no raunch in it. It's sensitive in its portrayal of a kid and his dad still grieving over the loss of a loved one. As far as the chess matches go, well, let's just say that these guys have a different notion of what the ""Sicilian Defense"" is. I'm rating this film 3.5 out of 5 stars. It would've been higher if only the chess matches had been more convincing. It's cool if this film inspires you to try your hand at chess. Just don't adopt any of the moves you see here. And, remember, the white piece always moves first. Unless you're in Canada, I guess. In magical Canada, if you take up chess in high school, hot cheerleaders will cheer you in the gym even as the basketball players get kicked to the curb.",1305331200,2,2730,4.695198329853862
8111121,5,B000EMG92C,"This is an entertaining teen romance/comedy. Chessplayers everywhere will enjoy watching it. Some potential problems: 1) The chess games and matches aren't realistic at all, 2) some sexual situations/language that would warrant a PG-13, 3) No closed captioning. However, Chessplayers and coaches will get some new training ideas:). The PG-13 over 90 mins isn't as bad as a Britney Spears video. You get to listen to some lousy, yet funny, chess rap songs that you can use to annoy your opponents in blitz or skittles. Overall, it's a funny, enjoyable movie that you will want to watch again.",1173052800,,591,5.040816326530612
8111122,5,B000EMG92C,"This is a great movie, long overlooked. A small town high school is nuts about chess and everybody plays

The big showdown comes when a team from the Soviet Union is flown in to play the big match. The coach for Hatley High is a Soviet defector who defected during the last chess match between the two teams. The new Russian coach is a Russian nationalist, and the rivalry is personal.

On the night before the big showdown, the Russian team captain, Anya Petrovich, played by Ilona Elkin, seduces the Hatley High captain, played by James A. Woods, and tricks him by putting handcuffs on him and locking him in the principal's office. When the Hatley High Captain does not appear for the big final match, the Hatley High team will be forfeited unless somebody can be pulled off the bench to play the big final game.

The creators of this movie could have used a real chess consultant. Many of the moves shown on the chess board are illegal. Black moves first in the first game and, although they use chess terms like Sicilian Defense and Budapest Defense, the moves shown on the board are nothing like those openings.

However, we can overlook these defects because this movie teaches us chess players important lessons about how a movie about a high school chess match can be made exciting and interesting to the general non-chess playing audience.

8111123,5,B000EMG92C,"Hatley High is a great film.  The comedy is the everyday things we love to see.  This movie is largly aimed at ""nerds"" and the school is a lot like a Yale turned High School.  All around enjoyable and well worth your money to see.",1147564800,2,230,4.066666666666666
