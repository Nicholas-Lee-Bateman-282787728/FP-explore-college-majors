2322492,5,B0009UZG0K,Liked the story line and it's nice to see Johnny Depp in the altogether instead of a bunch of makeup to make him look like something  other than himself. I've seen the interviews where he says it's easier sometimes to act the part when you look like someone else other than yourself. BUT - he's sooo easy to look at.,1376956800,,316,4.266666666666667
2322493,5,B0009UZG0K,I love Johnny Depp and I collect his movies.  I especially loved The Astronaut's Wife.  I enjoyed both movies and they arrived in great shape.,1375488000,,142,4.64
2322494,3,B0009UZG0K,"i know i am probably going to give more stars than most.  my logic is that i would not buy it if i hadn't seen it and liked it, i love johnny and felt he needed to be in this film more to make it better, the acting is a little stiff but i almost felt like i had walked in missing the first ten minutes, and also i left before the last 5 minutes.  i wished they had shown more of the astronaut before to know how he had changed, a few hints from the confused wife that he was the only one to understand her blah blah, wasn't quite enough, but it must have been fun to play someone who had no conscience ... worth it i feel

don juan was amusing and i am sure most people have seen it, i cant say to much because i actually bought the dvd for the astronaut's wife, but if you like johnny depp and marlon brando you'll like it....  in other words i don't remember but felt i seemed smarter if i pretended to.
my opinion is this, johnny depp needs to get together with clint eastwood before clint retires and remake 'play misty for me' clint can direct johnny, find some good actresses maybe even unknowns as long as they let any of the still around  original cast do bit parts, hillary swank could do jessica walter's role of evelyn (i think that was her name) and clint's pretty daughter from midnight in the garden of good and evil can be the nice girl toby (donna mills) or michelle williams... anyway if they need help with the script they probably won't ask me, but still my hearts in the right place... just my spelling sucks..  hey, jessica walter could be the bartender!",1354320000,,1575,4.1644736842105265
2322495,5,B0009UZG0K,The DVD arrived VERY fast and in great condition! My mother and I were able to enjoy a night of Johnny. :),1318464000,,106,3.8636363636363638
2322496,5,B0009UZG0K,What a great 2 pack! you get a GREAT romantic comedy and a good thriller all in one case! Definitly get this double feature!,1234656000,,124,4.208333333333333
2322497,3,B0009UZG0K,"It's really funny to sell two movies so different just for the same main actor. If we have to say, Don Juan de Marco it's a wonderfull film, the story it's romantic but at the same time a clever exploration about the true love.
The other film it's just a waste of time, it remind me much of the old films with much suspense but without a good story and not even entertaining, you cannot compare a masterpiece like ""Don Juan de Marco""with a piece of trash like ""The astronaut's wife"" where boring it's not a choice; next time the best choice could be ""the Ninth gate"" a suspense film with a really clever story.",1202428800,,610,4.3130434782608695
2322498,5,B0009UZG0K,"I never saw ""The Astronauts Wife"" but I have seen Don Juan DeMarco.  The latter film is ""worth the price of admission"" in spades---romantic, fun, humorous, engaging......great actors, great acting.....  Get this set for ""Don Juan DeMarco"" if only for that one.  Highly recommended!  boland7214@aol",1195862400,,297,5.533333333333333
2322499,1,B0009UZG0K,Iv'e seen The Astronauts Wife which is a remake of an old sci fi classic with Tom Tryon. This remake is one the worst movies I have ever seen. The original is much better. The acting in the remake is awful and there is literally no action or suspense to speak of. Buy at your own risk.,1123804800,10,285,4.017543859649122

8066919,5,B0009UZG0K,I enjoyed both of these movies very much.  The Austronaut's Wife was well done and frighteningly real.  Don Juan DeMarco was a delightful escape.,1466899200,,145,5.0
8066920,5,B0009UZG0K,Great deal for two great movies!,1428969600,,32,4.5
8066921,5,B0009UZG0K,"Love Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron. The Astronauts Wife was a surprise for me. I really liked it. It's billed as something in the same vein as Rosemary's Baby...Which I thought would be a BIG stretch. Turns out that it wasn't that much of a stretch...I'm a psychologist and enjoy watching something that will make me think on the edge (a surprise). It did that. Don Juan...whats not to like about Depp, Dunaway and Brando.",1425081600,,424,4.666666666666667
8066922,5,B0009UZG0K,Don Juan is a delightful film.  I'll watch it again.,1416528000,,52,4.2

8066924,5,B0009UZG0K,My granddaughter had this on her Christmas List and was excited when she opened it. So a 5-star smile gets this rating for making grandma look good in the gift giving category.,1388793600,,176,4.53125
8066925,5,B0009UZG0K,"I still haven't figured out what happened when the men were out in space - there are hints.  JDepp and Charlize (the magnificent) Theron work so well together, you'd think they had lots of experience together.  You view the film through the eyes of the wife (Theron) and as she becomes confused and frightened, so do you.  There's an ending you'll never forget!

Don Juan De Marco is one of my favorite movies of all time!  I would never have believed that Johnny Depp and Marlon Brando could work together so well!  The ending was perfect - didn't see it coming.  It's a lovely romantic almost-comedy with Brian Adams singing his ""Have you ever really loved a woman"" adding the perfect romantic atmosphere.  Take notes when Depp starts his beautiful speech to Brando -- ""Why are we here, of what is the spirit made, what is worth living for, what is worth dying for. The answer to each of these is the same.""  Watch the movie.  You won't be sorry.",1377302400,2,948,4.523529411764706
