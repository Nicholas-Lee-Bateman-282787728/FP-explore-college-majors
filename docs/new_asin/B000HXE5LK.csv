8467901,5,B000HXE5LK,"A great compilation of the last 10 years of the Camel Trophy. I used to get the videos from the local dealers (with Scott Brady), a stare in wonder at what they accomplished with mostly stock rigs and a lot of labor. This DVD is a great introduction to the Trophy, although my complaint is that it's too short- I would have skipped the last couple years and lengthened the years when the driving was the focus.",1227484800,,410,4.337662337662338
8467902,5,B000HXE5LK,"I was glad to see this DVD released as it helps keep the legacy of the Camel Trophy alive.  My only complaint is that I wish it was twice as long...

Great footage of Series, Defender and Discovery Land Rovers in action from throughout the world.",1167868800,,246,4.326086956521739
