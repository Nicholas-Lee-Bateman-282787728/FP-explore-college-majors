8211387,5,B000TYCX2A,"I Loved the movie, but David Tenant is not the main focus of the film. If the only reason you get this film is for DT you might be disapointed. The main focus of the movie is Jessica Hynes ( Dr Who -Season 3 - Matron, Family of Blood) who also wrote this film, who is trying to learn to drive and get her drivers license.  Jessica is excellant as the harrassed and much put upon wife and mother trying desperatly to get her license so she can start her own business. The second star of this film is Shaun Dingwall (Dr Who - Pete Tylor- Rose's Dad) as Jessica's husband, who has all these sceames to make money that never quite makes it, and who tries to teach Jessica to drive but makes her too nervious. So Jessica decides to go to a professional driving school to learn and is assigned Chris ( David Tennant) who is very calm, patiant and gives his students encourgement and confidence. In the end Jessica does get her license and her business.",1363305600,5,946,4.284916201117318
