8214527,5,B000URD1VS,"The Last Bounty Hunter puts you in a first person live scenario where it's up to you to bring in the outlaws Handsome Harry, Nasty Dan, El Loco and The Cactus Kid dead or alive. Each outlaw has a different scenario to play through and you can play them in any order and watch new scenes appear. The actors are hysterical and the action is fast paced. This game is a lot of fun and is highly recommended.",1256601600,,403,4.17948717948718
