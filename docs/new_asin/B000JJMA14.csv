8150913,5,B000JJMA14,"This video is the best!!  First of all, every song comes with an overview of the motions before you actually see the song.  Next, the actual motions are easy and kid friendly.  Lastly, the songs are SUPER!!
They tell you over and over that this video is meant for training and not to be used with the actual kids and you couldn't use it with kids who could read, because the have pop ups tips for the teachers every so often, but I use it with my preschoolers and it's perfect!!  They need the motion review and man, you should hear them yell and sing these songs!
Their faves right now are Davy, Davy and Joy.",1333584000,,610,4.232758620689655
