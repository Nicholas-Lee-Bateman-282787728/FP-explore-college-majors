You won't be disappointed in this",1321920000,,170,5.071428571428571
8392838,1,B003A7SY6M,"This DVD is a pathetic attempt by the BBC to fool the viewing public by re-using the title of an excellent show on a mediocre new entry.  This show has no connection to the previous episodes of Messiah - totally (everyone) different cast and different writers.  Only connection to the older version is that there is a serial killer with a religious theme and police try and find him.  The ripoff could be tolerated if the new series had any redeeming values but the actors are stiff (actually they are all stiffs).  The main plot is predictable and the side subplots are uninteresting.  Fortunately, the episodes are only 60 minutes each so the viewer suffering does not last too long.",1286582400,3,685,4.675
