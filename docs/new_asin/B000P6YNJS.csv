8189627,5,B000P6YNJS,"This was a fantastic dvd about true love and commitment of marriage.  I enjoyed it greatly.  I have even attended some of the seminars in the area put on by Mat Boggs for his ""Breaking The Man Code"".  So much fun and a wonderful learning experience.  I wish all could see it.",1326758400,,275,4.230769230769231

8189629,3,B000P6YNJS,"Didn't like the video as much as we had hoped.
I thought it was a Christian project, and I don't think it was.
We never even finished watching the whole thing, sorry.",1298764800,,166,4.21875
8189630,5,B000P6YNJS,"I saw this documentary for the first time last night and I LOVED it. My grandparents were happily married for 40+ years before my grandmom passed away from Alzheimer's and I've always been sad that I was too young to ask her about their marriage and what made it work before she was gone. Even though it wasn't the same as talking to my grandmom, watching these guys talking to couples from my grandparents' generation was so cool and the next best thing to talking to her. I'm definitely going to be recommending this video to friends.",1184716800,4,536,4.536082474226804
8189631,5,B000P6YNJS,"The documentary DVD, ""Project Everlasting; The Search for America's Greatest Marriages Begins!"", is extraordinary! It far exceeded my expectations. It is absolutely riveting. The authors, Jason Miller and Mat Boggs, do not overwhelm their audience by exposing the viewer to too many thought-provoking secrets to a great and long-lasting marriage at one time. Rather, they break the tension with great stories about the birth of Project Everlasting, a highly entertaining stand-up comedy routine, and other special segments. In addition, Mat and Jason share with us their own personal motivations for bringing us a concept that rivals the impact of The Kinsey Reports of 1948 and 1953, which began a sexual revolution. Best of all, it is completely honest and true. No razzle-dazzle. No smoke and mirrors. It  shows the frailties, the humanness, as well as the triumphs of marriage.

While the target audience is young engaged and married couples, it is also the ""magic elixir"" that caused this divorced father of two incredible sons to reflect on why his marriage did not last. Though hindsight is 20/20, I truly believe that, had this DVD been available 20 years ago, I would still be married today. For me, this is a miracle drug for my soul, possibly even better than chicken soup!

The potpourri of surprisingly effective audio-visual techniques is a very special treat for the eyes and ears of the viewing audience. The tastefully chosen and appropriate background music is the magic that holds the video together.

Simply put, ""Project Everlasting; The Search for America's Greatest Marriages Begins!"" is a must-see for everyone who is married, is contemplating marriage, or has ever been married. Most especially, this can be the great restorer of hope, courage, and faith in the future for those who are going through tough times in their marriages today. This is the glue that can hold marriages together, the music in their lives, and the inspiration for a beautiful, everlasting, and glorious marriage. The exciting prospect of future yet-untold stories of amazing marriages holds the promise of revealing other treasures that we all can apply to our daily lives. My thanks to these two creative geniuses, for bestowing this wonderful gift upon everyone who sees it.",1184630400,6,2277,5.162601626016261
