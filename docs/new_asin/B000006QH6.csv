He was truly a super-star, and, thanks to sources like A & E and Amazon, he lives on in the many films he made in his all-too-short life.",1323388800,,246,4.23404255319149

Intelligent and warm, compassionate and sincere, we meet some of the people who were closest to him and hear from their own lips what he meant to those who knew him well enough to call him friend.  A beautiful tribute to a beautiful man.",970531200,15,465,4.728395061728395
