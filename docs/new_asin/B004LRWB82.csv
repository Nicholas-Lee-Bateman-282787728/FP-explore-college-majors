8434749,5,B004LRWB82,"In reality there were only a few lucky souls during this time period that really got to experience the Seattle soul scene.  While a lot of other people were trending towards disco and straight ahead rock, the real people who knew and appreciated music were catching these acts at their local obscure clubs.  Even the DJ who essentially hosts this DVD who has hundreds of thousands of LPs, and 45's never heard of these bands.  That kind of sums it up.  Anyway, loved this DVD.  Wish there were videos of live performances back in the day...but back then, I barely had pictures of my own bands I played in, let alone pictures of these bands.  There were many, many Seattle soul bands other than what is just presented here.  The originators of this DVD need to dig deeper and come up with a second edition.  That would be great!",1319414400,3,827,4.503355704697986
