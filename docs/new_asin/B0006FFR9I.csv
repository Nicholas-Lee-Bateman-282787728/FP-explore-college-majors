8041207,4,B0006FFR9I,"I initially bought this film because of my interest in Gail Russell. She plays the main female lead and is convincing in her role as an unsophisticated and undereducated daughter of a hard scrabble trotting horse trainer. I was not disappointed in her screen time, character portrayal, or any other aspect of her performance. If you are a Gail Russell fan, you should consider adding this film to your collection. I was surprised that the film was also very interesting in the glimpse into the life and times of its setting. The film made clear the difference in the life-style of the rural poor and the urban and more wealthy.  What is more, I was also motivated to learn  about the horse, Dan Patch, himself. That was a pretty amazing animal! The film quality is less that I expected. Hence the four stars. I think this is due to marginal production quality and very poor lighting. The night scenes were especially difficult to discern what was happening. Some of the interior shots of the stable were likewise difficult to watch. Like many films of its day, the acting is amateurish by modern standards, the continuity suffers somewhat, camera locations for most interior scenes were less than ideal. Well, so what? It stars Gail Russell!!",1449964800,,1242,4.799065420560748
8041208,4,B0006FFR9I,"Nice story. I bought this without ever having seen the movie because Gail Russell was in it. After learning of her troubled life, cut short by her demons, and having enjoyed her character so much in John Wayne's ""The Angel and the Bad Man"" I went ahead and ordered it. For me, it is worth having in my DVD movie collection.",1419206400,,323,4.311475409836065

8041210,4,B0006FFR9I,"Lovely classic old movie, well worth a watch. Dennis O'Keefe and Gail Russell and some other great players make for memorable entertainment in the old style. A light, enjoyable movie.",1409011200,,183,5.133333333333334
8041211,5,B0006FFR9I,"Liking horse stories and old movies, it was fun to see it again after all these years.
Though it was a simple movie of its time, Dan Patch was a true sports champion, whose
feats still stand in the world of harness racing.  Loved seeing the racing scenes.",1359849600,,255,4.3125
8041212,4,B0006FFR9I,"There was a time when Hollywood had a fascination of telling a story by featuring outstanding equine athletes. This 1949 release is a fictionalized account of the life of one of the greatest Standardbred racers of all time, Dan Patch.

Dan Patch, 1896-1916, was a racing sensation, breaking world speed records at least 14 times. The pinnacle achievement was in 1906, blazing a one-mile time trial in 1-minute, 55-seconds, a record that was matched several times, but not broken until 1960. He was a sports celebrity, having endorsement deals for toys, cigars, washing machines and cars.

And, like Thoroughbred legend, Seabiscuit, Dan Patch was not viewed early in his career as an emerging superstar. After one season of showing little promise, a local trainer (Oxford, Indiana), Johnny Wattles, began the slow process of uncovering the vast potential in this misunderstood pacer.

The script strides away from the interesting true story into the typical track for the time period; a love story surrounding people who have the best interest of the racer in mind.

Dan Patch's owner, chemist David Palmer (Dennis O'Keefe), has a spouse (Ruth Warrick) who cares very little about horses. The friction caused by her strong feelings eventually leads Palmer to Cissy Lathrop (Gail Russell), the daughter of trainer (John Hoyt).

Actor, songwriter and attorney, Dr. Clarence Muse, a 1973 Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame inductee, is vastly underrated in his role of making the team click around Dan Patch.

Even taking into account the many fictionalized scenes within this story, The Great Dan Patch keeps it all together through a performer who cannot read a single line or croon songs.",1203897600,4,1682,5.142857142857143
8041213,4,B0006FFR9I,"This 1949 movie is based on the true story of the legendary race horse Dan Patch, who in eleven years of racing remained undefeated. ""Great Dan Patch"" is certainly no masterpiece, but it's nevertheless an enjoyable movie with a great cast. Arthur Hunnicutt, whom you'll recognize from ""The Red Badge of Courage"", adds a lot here in a suporting role. Chemist David Palmer (Dennis O'Keefe) has just married a snobby socialite, Ruth Treadwell (Ruth Warrick), and is also the owner of race horses. When he purchases Dan Patch he knows he's gotten a very special horse, and the trainer Ben Lathrop (John Hoyt), along with his daughter Cissy (Gail Russell), takes good care of Dan Patch. Cissy has had a crush on David for a long time, but his marriage to Ruth has crushed her hopes.

Finally, David realizes that he can no longer tolerate his obnoxious wife, and he leaves her and heads for the lovely Cissy. Meanwhile, David sales Dan Patch for $60,000 and the horse becomes a major success touring the country. Of course the story of Dan Patch is in the background throughout the film as the main focus is on Cissy's love for David, but that was okay with me. I never was a fan of horse racing anyway! The reason I purchased this dvd was because I'm a big fan of beautiful Gail Russell, who unfortunately died on August 26, 1961, from an alcohol induced heart attack. She was only 36 years old and had appeared in only 23 films, yet she left behind a legacy of exceptional performances. This dvd from Goodtimes has a nice picture and sound quality and is recommended for any fan of Gail Russell or Dennis O'Keefe.",1116115200,6,1610,4.590277777777778
