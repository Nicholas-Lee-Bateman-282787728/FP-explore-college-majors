187743,5,1569381976,"I've loved and admired Derek Jacobi as an actor since his terrific turn as Claudius in ""I Claudius.""  In the Cadfael series, Jacobi is Brother Cadfael, a smart Welsh priest in Medieval times.  He's also a healer and sleuth with a mysterious past.  In ""A Morbid Taste for Bones,"" which is one of my favorites, a delusional Brother has visions and is simply a nutcase.  However this is the days of old so the visions have meaning, especially to a self-serving church that needs money.  Based on a wrong interpretation of one of these visions, the priests decide that a young Welsh saint lies uneasy in her grave and set out to dig her up and take her bones to the church.  Of course they have ulterior motives because relics such as bones bring the churches favor and money.  I don't want to give away any of the great plot, so I'll only state that a murder occurs.  Brother Cadfael must bring peace between the Welsh people who have the saint buried in their town and the priests who greedily want her bones removed and taken for their own sake.  He must also solve the murder so an innocent is not executed.  There are delicious twists to the story and a wonderful ending that has everyone happy......and deceived.  Only Brother Cadfael and two others know the truth.  This series is so unusual in it's time setting and characters that it is one of a kind.  It's also beautifully done.  Ellis Peters would be very proud of how they interpreted her books to film.",1186704000,,1462,4.509505703422053
187744,5,1569381976,"We now have all of the Cadfael movies and have watched them in order, love them, and our youngest daughter has been bitten by the mystery bug.

187745,5,1569381976,"When I viewed the first set in this series I was drawn in by the wonderful acting, sets, costumes, music, and more. I immediately ordered the rest the sets and the third set showed up before the second. I couldn't wait to watch it and so I watched it out of order. It really doesn't matter I think what order you watch them in other than some of the background, whose King, politics, etc. might be clearer if watched in order.

Be sure to read the review ""Successful TV dramatization and the role of Sir Derek's life"" by themis_athena from Santa Monica, CA, USA. An excellent review and I dare anyone would have a hard time doing better. My only additional comment is I like Sheriff Hugh Beringar in the first series a little better. Eoin McCarthy in this series does not have quite the depth of Sean Pertwee.

This set includes the standard extras found in this series. Quite honestly these sets are a bargain for this price.",1075161600,3,926,4.4733727810650885

187749,5,1569381976,"I remember Timmy and Lassie reruns from when I was a child and when looking for videos that would be appropriate for my own children, I came across these.  My 8 year old daughter is a real animal lover and really has been enjoying these tapes.  They are old-fashioned with the children speaking respectfully, no blood and gore, no nasty language.  Sure the Mom is the stereotypical housewife (afterall, these were made in the 1950's when the majority of women were housewives), but the values are sound and the stories are sweet and entertaining.  The 10 video set takes you on a progression from the first episode ever to the ""Transition"" from Jeff Miller to Timmy Martin as Lassie's owner.  It is fun to watch the boys age from video to video.

187752,4,1569381976,"Love is a wonderful, many-splendoured thing... but it also can lead to murder, sin and hate. ""Brother Cadfael, Set 3 (The Rose Rent, A Morbid Taste for Bones, The Raven in the Foregate)"" shows off the darker side of love and desire, whether it involves a saint's bones or a girl who just, uh, loves too much and too often. The only downside is some religiously-questionable actions Cadfael takes at one point.

Beautiful widow Judith Perle gives the Abbey a piece of her property, with the stipulation that they must pay a single ""Rose Rent"" from the rose bushes there. But then Brother Eluric -- who had confessed his desire for Judith -- is found dead, and the widow herself is kidnapped. As a wealthy woman, she has quite a few suitors, and Cadfael must unravel what cold greed -- or a twisted love -- has led to murder.

Then in ""A Morbid Taste for Bones,"" a young monk named Columbanus has an epileptic seizure, which he claims gave him a vision of the Welsh saint Winifred. Prior Robert insists on leading an expedition deep into the Welsh countryside, and returning with Winifred's holy bones. But the Welsh village of Gwytherin is reluctant to give up their saint -- and even more so when a prominent landowner is found dead. Of course, the monks are the main suspects, and Cadfael has to figure out who did it and why.

Finally, ""The Raven in the Foregate"" is Father Ailnoth, a cruel, greedy and unforgiving priest who manages to alienate EVERYONE he meets in Shrewsbury. But the townsfolk are truly enraged when his nastiness drives a single pregnant girl to suicide, and shortly afterwards, he's found dead in a water wheel. So a guilt-ridden Cadfael must work out who murdered Ailnoth, and whether the girl truly committed suicide.

For the most part, these three novels are a solid adaptation of Ellis Peters' novels -- every mystery has lots of suspects, moral dilemmas, religious strife, a murder that only Cadfael can solve, and a bit of romance. And it has all the blood, grime and sweat of the 12th century, and accurately depicts the strong presence of religion and medieval life. The politics is given a backseat in this one, though.

Derek Jacobi remains absolutely perfect as Cadfael -- he depicts the herbalist monk as a man of faith, strength, paternal kindness and a formidable intellect. We also get to see him spending time in his native land of Wales, but he's the most richly developed in ""Raven in the Foregate,"" when the poor guy is wracked with guilt over his inadvertent part in the pregnant girl's death.

There are also great performances by Terrence Hardiman as the kind but stern Abbot Radulfus, Julian Firth as the fussy Brother Jerome (who is even implicated in a murder), Michael Culver as the haughty snob Prior Robert, and Mark Charnock as the oft-abused but gentle Brother Oswin (who continues to provide some comic relief, such as when he almost gets left behind in the Wales trip).

So what is the downside of this collection? Well, for SOME inexplicable reason, the writers added a scene where Cadfael takes actions that are at odds with his piety and his duties as a monk -- namely, possible euthanasia. It's just shoehorned in for no reason, and it doesn't fit.

If you fast-forward that scene, ""Brother Cadfael, Set 3 (The Rose Rent, A Morbid Taste for Bones, The Raven in the Foregate)"" is a strong trio of rich, powerfully-written medieval mysteries. All you need is love... and death!",1307836800,,3436,4.724540901502504
187753,5,1569381976,"This is one of the most brilliant book-to-screen adaptations I've ever seen.  Jacobi is the quintessential Cadfael.  Recommended to all fans of historical mysteries, the Middle Ages, or Medieval mysteries.  Edith Pargeter/Ellis Peters did massive amounts of research to make these books true to life, and the television producers/directors continued her noble tradition.",1298073600,,370,5.943396226415095

187755,3,1569381976,"Unfortunately the producers of this series took a bad turn when they produced these three titles. They chose to not follow the books at all. All of the titles are much darker than the books which are very positive about human nature. The bad guys have been made evil and the entire production is more sinister than Ellis Peters intended. Her message was always that people were basically good and redeemable where these movies emphasize the evil and downplay or even omit the good. Even Cadfael is portrayed as more violent and angry then he ever is in the books. I own all of the series and love the first 7 which were much more positive. These combine characters and sometimes even change the characters from angelic to demonic. There was no excuse for this. The stories Ellis Peters wrote were excellent these renditions are lame to bad. Perhaps, had they stay true to the original author's intent, they could have made the other 7 books too.

The show quality is good, both sound and visual, but the stories make it so that I can't highly recommend them.",1279065600,2,1058,4.627659574468085

The attention to historical detail, the music, the quality of the performances, etc. make this a movie I can watch over and over.  Follows the book exceedingly well, which is sometimes done so badly. Just as Jeremy Brett IS Holmes, Derek Jacobi IS Cadfael.  If you can only own a handful of Cadfaels, make sure you own this one!",1250726400,,466,4.395348837209302

187759,4,1569381976,"These three mysteries, based in England during the Middle Ages, are really quite well done. Of the three I think A Morbid Taste For Bones was probably the best.

The Cadfael mysteries are not just good mysteries; they also provide an interesting look at life in the Middle Ages and how things were done, the role of the Church, Royal officers, etc.",1200614400,,348,4.612903225806452

7797094,5,1569381976,"The Rose Rent

""We have this moment for good or ill""

The Rose rent is a great mystery and in the course of being solved leads people to evaluate what has worth in life. A young widow must now face the fact that she may have killed her husband and also plan the rest of her life.

Of course people die and Brother Cadfael uses forensics to determine who the murderer(s) are and the motive(s.) You get more then sufficient clues on the way.

My favorite quote is in the morning as they are ringing the morning bell; someone asks Cadfael, ""Are you awake?"" and Cadfael staggering ""No. But I am out of bed.""

A Morbid Taste for Bones

""A man may step out of his nature""

A monk has the ability of sight. While he is being bleed he gets a vision. With the help of Jerome he realizes that it is St. Winifred whose body is lost in Wales and wants to be here so people can visit. A retrieval expedition is launched against Cadfael judgment.

This is one of the best Father Cadfaels as it has meaning and story on many levels. True the ending is not exactly the book ending. But the feel is still there. The point that I like best is that the language is common but the cultures as dissimilar.

Although there is no Hugh Beringar (Sean Pertwee), this film contains one of my favorite actors John Hallam who plays the lord Richard. He has been in many popular movies including ""4.50 from Paddington"" where he gets to play a similar character as Cedric Crackenthorpe.

I leave you with this thought:
""Those that seek to lay hands on St. Winifred are apt to perish.""

DVD info:
The first thing that struck me was how clear the picture is. Maybe some of it is the tape was worn yet I never noticed that that Brother Jerome had freckles. Unexpectedly they (whoever they are) put all the DVD goodies on this except a running commentary. Of course there are interactive menus, which make navigation easy. Then there is a scene index of which I seldom use. An Exclusive audio comments by Derek Jacob, has pictures of him with Ellis Peters as he explains that a one and a half hour program just can not pack the elaborate plots and number of characters in to do justice to the book readers. The Ellis Peters biography and book list is written on the screen (Sorry you have to read some of this.) The production scrapbook has about 10 stills showing the film being made. I have not tried the captions for the hearing impaired. What is not mentioned is a list of the productions that Derek Jacobi has done.
Want to see something eerie, look at the picture of Derek next to Ellis. They could be related.
------------------------------------------------------------------
The Raven in the Foregate
""Truth and justice are often at odds.""
It is said, ""All that evil needs to flourish is for good men to nothing."" And this film has a few good men that do nothing. So once again it is up to Brother Cadfael to sort out the mystery and if separate mysteries are related. I will not go thought the story blow by blow, as that is part of the intrigue in watching these films.
Shrewsbury needs a new priest. Due to the civil war between Empress Maud and King Stephen 12th-century England the priest is picked for his political leanings.
A local girl is having an illegitimate child and asks Cadfael for confession. Cadfael explains only a priest can do that.
Father Ailnoth, the new parish priest to Shrewsbury, earns the scorn of his parishioners. After refusing to absolver a parishioner for carrying an illegitimate child; later the priest is found dead in the river. There are plenty of suspects but a shortage of clues.",1504224000,,3666,4.608895705521473

by, his earlier history as a crusader. This previous life follows him even into the cloisters, much to our delight. I would
recommend it heartily to those with combined tastes for history and mystery. Enjoy the atmosphere--all you won't have
is the smell of the middle ages, and that is perhaps as well! There is such a thing as too much authenticity!",1380672000,,596,4.632075471698113
