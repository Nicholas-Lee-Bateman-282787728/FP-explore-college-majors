4188766,5,B003SPDSAI,"An anime that tries it's hardest to keep to traditional folklore, Ghost Hunt is a well-told exploration of paranormal phenomena in a medium that allows for more visual intensity than a live action series would. The character dynamics are well-played, and any steriotypes that play out are done with just the right touch, so as to not feel overdone, or detract from the story. The mythology itsel actually provides a decent glance in Japanese folklore and religious practices, and the show's tendency to go into descriptive rants, as opposed to leaving an observer bored and waiting or something to happen, acctually serves to intensify the environment and help keep the watcher interested all the way through. It's set into small 3-or-4 parters, each touching on a dierent kind o supernatural threat, so that old antagonists or techniques aren't horribly overused, and going back and rewatching small bits at a time is alot of fun. Especially the ""Bloodsoaked Labyrinth"" arc.

Good points for voice acting, although I eel that the english VA's lend more towards the dramatic and darker mood that the series shotts for.",1293235200,,1118,5.076086956521739
4188767,5,B003SPDSAI,"Great series! Loved all the characters, story lines and music. Naru is awesome and his relationship with Mai is so funny. I've watched this in both Japanese and English and though I prefer English, ( I can watch and listen rather than read and watch) both are great. Recommend for ages 14+ due to the intensity of some of the stories. Great fun and entertainment for the whole family. Got all my friends hooked on it too.",1292976000,,421,4.48051948051948
4188768,5,B003SPDSAI,"I love this show because it's funny and really scary, it you don't like at least a little bit of stupid humor then you won't like it. It's not stupid but some of the humor is different sort of like any anime show.",1290729600,,213,3.9767441860465116
4188769,5,B003SPDSAI,"This series is basically a bunch of short ghost/mystery stories solved by Kazuya Shibuya (nicknamed Naru, short for 'narcissist') and his assistant, Mai. There isn't much of an overall storyline, and most stories span 1-2 episodes. The stories are primarily taken from traditional Japanese horror tales, which if you haven't had much experience with can be very different indeed. Even someone with exposure to the traditional stories will probably enjoy this series for the new twists on old favorites and the entertaining characters. Mai and Naru are fun to watch - Mai is a likable ordinary high school student in an extraordinary situation as the part-time assistant to a ghost hunter. Naru, while admittedly a bit narcissistic, isn't overly so and he certainly can keep his cool in intense situations. The other characters, a shinto priestess, a Buddhist monk, a TV psychic, and a Christian exorcist, while not very impressive on their own, make entertaining and interesting supporting characters. This series is drenched with Japanese culture and worth watching for that fact alone. Throw in the fun characters and pretty art, and this series becomes a must see. I watched it in Japanese, and I must say the the voice actors were all really good and fit their parts very well. I also liked the soundtrack for this series, nice and creepy.",1285545600,24,1343,5.054054054054054
4188770,5,B003SPDSAI,"For the record, ""Ghost Hunt"" is an anime series based on a manga series based on a novel series. Surprising, it doesn't suffer in translation.

And ""Ghost Hunt: The Complete Series"" does an excellent job bringing home elaborate and genuinely eerie scares, based on curses, possessions, psychic powers and the occasional roaming ghost. It can be rather slow-moving at times and some questions are left unanswered (just who is ""dream Naru""?), but it has a winning mixture of comedy, horror and suspense.

After she destroys his camera and injures his assistant Lin, the icy ""ghost hunter"" Kazuya Shibuya (aka Naru) allows Mai Taniyama to work with him as his assistant -- he's investigating a haunted part of her school. They're soon joined by some professional exorcists: slinky Shinto priestess Ayako, renegade Buddhist monk Hosho, psychic Masako, and Catholic priest John Brown.

The little group soon find themselves dealing with many strange cases: a house oppressed by an evil doll and the ghosts of tormented children; a high school whose students and teachers are being tormented by strange apparitions; a Christmastime visit to a haunted Catholic church, and a ghost who likes to drench parkgoing lovers with water.

Then things take a darker turn when the gang is called in to deal with a school haunted by horrifying specters and fires; a vast labyrinthine house with a bloodthirsty secret; and finally a seaside hotel whose inhabitants have been possessed by vengeful spirits determined to stop any spiritualists who come around. Even worse, Naru has become possessed.

The supernatural stuff in ""Ghost Hunt"" is pretty intense stuff -- howling ghosts, haunted wells, curses, onmyodo, exorcisms, fox spirits, zombies, ouija, and a creepy possessed doll. Those who like a lot of action and melodrama will undoubtedly find all this to be rather slow, since every episode is a sort of supernatural detective story.

The overall series has a nice haunted house atmosphere, although the last couple arcs get flashier horrorwise (bloodbaths! Zombies!). There's a general atmosphere of overhanging dread, psychic/supernatural trivia (wooden effigy dolls) and eerie Japanese spectors (a buggy-eyed ghost that pulls a scythe out of its mouth). But fortunately the writers keep it from getting too grim with regular doses of humor, such as the rock'n'roll monk, or a romantic rivalry popping over Naru.

The big problem is that the otherwise satisfying open ending leaves some questions unanswered, such as Mai and Naru's budding relationship and the mystery of ""dream Naru."" Just what is going on there?

Mai is a likable heroine -- she's hardworking, honest and resilient, and seems to have some hidden psychic powers; Naru is a chilly, sarcastic teenage genius, but he has a lighter side that comes out in less stressful circumstances (his ""talking pet coin""). And the supporting cast is a fun bunch -- the mellow, sweet Aussie priest, the strong-willed Ayako, the devious stalkerish Masako, the enigmatic Lin, and finally the hilarious rock'n'roll Buddhist cleric Hosho. And as the icing on the cake, all the voice actors are perfectly suited to their roles.

Ghosts, curses and bizarre occurrences abound in ""Ghost Hunt: The Complete Series."" It moves rather slowly at times, but has the right balance of comedy, suspense and horror.",1277078400,52,3337,5.210820895522388

4188821,5,B003SPDSAI,"Had to opportunity to watch Ghost Hunt Anime on streaming website and really enjoy the stories. It's not too scary that I'll have nightmare. Each story is separated into 3 - 4 episodes. The pace is fast enough and several characters to keep you entertained. Main Female Lead is typical anime shoujo but not a big deal for me~ She still has her adorable, useful traits. Wonderful anime but I'm disappointed at how there's no continuation from the original manga author. You can tell that there's unanswered questions at the end of the anime.

4188962,5,B003SPDSAI,"Bought this series sometime last year and I have to leave you my most honest review:

The DVDs work great.  Not a problem in sight.
The storylines, while divided in to clear arcs, are guaranteed to hold even anime HATERS on the edge of their seats (I proved this with a college roommate~).
The characters are well-rounded and mix well; while I refuse to watch anything dubbed, the original voice actors do an excellent job portraying their roles, and the subs are top-notch translations.

Therefore it's a 5/5, ten thumbs up, PLEASE BUY THIS SERIES AND SUPPORT THE AMAZING AUTHOR.  If you like it, you might take a look at the series ""The Twelve Kingdoms"" as it's by the same author and every bit as enthralling.",1424995200,4,712,4.626984126984127

4188966,5,B003SPDSAI,"This anime is about a firm which specializes in investigating paranormal phenomena. The main cast of characters includes a Shrine priestess,  a Buddhist monk, a Roman Catholic exorcist, a psychic, Mai, the newbie, and Naru, the owner. This bunch of assorted personalities works together (sort of) to resolve cases of supernatural origins (or not), including a haunted school and a cursed hotel. Mai, our heroine, who seems to be completely normal, develops untapped psychic powers which strengthen as the series moves along.

I enjoyed Ghost Hunt quite a lot. For one thing, I got a crash course in Japanese mythology and folk beliefs. I liked the characters, even when they were being aggravating, and it was good to see Mai come into her own as a member of the team. My biggest objection comes at the very end--the final episode. I didn't agree with the way the story was handled, and though the outcome was fine I would have liked to see Mai be more involved than she was.

I had no problems with the DVDs. I watched the English dubbed version, and thought the actors did a great job. I haven't watched the Japanese language version, so i can't comment on that.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a show about the supernatural. It's a lot of fun, with a few really spooky moments thrown in to keep you on your guard!",1419552000,2,1348,4.675105485232067

4188969,4,B003SPDSAI,"I was excited to get this anime because I tried streaming it a couple of years ago with little success. Ghosthunt is a supernatural themed anime which follows the cases of a paranormal investigation firm.  The main characters include a cocky lead investigator,
a high school girl, a psychic, a shrine priestess, a Buddhist monk,  and a Catholic priest. The firm is called in to assess various reports of supernatural incidents and resolve them. Each episode is part of a case file,  with most files running 3 or 4 episodes. Files include a haunted school, a cursed hotel,  and a doll which seems to have supernatural powers.

I enjoyed Ghosthunt very much. The files are different enough from one another that you don't feel like you're watching the same story over and over,  and the characterizations are fun, since the group spends a lot of time squabbling. Add to that some creepy animation,  and you have the makings of a good anime.

This edition of Ghosthunt has the entire series.  The story arcs could be watched independently, but it's probably better to watch them consecutively as there are various plot points that make more sense if watched in order. Although not every mystery is cleared up at the end,  I found that it didn't bother me to have to make my own conclusions. I did object to the final resolution, which I thought should have been handled differently, but that didn't prevent me from enjoying the series as a whole.

I watched the English dubbed version.  I thought the actors did a fine job. I have not watched the subtitled version,  so I can't speak to that.

All in all,  Ghosthunt is fun.  If you like supernatural stories,  it is worth your time.  Don't expect fireworks or easy solutions,  and you might have to watch a couple of episodes before you can really get into it,  but if you stick with it you will be rewarded.",1417219200,,1856,4.634969325153374

Using their abilities and the best technology they hunt down evil spirits and solve thrilling ghost mysteries.

This is a creepy and thrilling anime that will send chills down your spine. It can be quite bloody at times. But it's not all just scares, there is some comedy thrown in too. If you like chilling ghost stories, I'd check this anime out.",1384819200,,730,4.748031496062992
4188993,5,B003SPDSAI,"A very haunting opening musically, this series lived up to its name. I liked that most of the episodes were laid out like case files and often took 3 parts to complete a story line. The comparison among the various forms of religions combined with good acting and very nicely paced story lines gave this series a fresh and tasteful feel. Very suspenseful and much less focus on gore made this one of my favorite ""haunting"" series.",1381795200,,430,4.597402597402597

4188995,5,B003SPDSAI,"I really enjoyed this series. The characters all had their own personalities and quirks and none of them were boring or one-dimensional, as the series progresses they all flesh out and as you learn more they really all take on lives of their own. I enjoyed each little story, and they get progressively eerier as the series goes on. My only complaint is that the ending wasn't really an end.

4188999,5,B003SPDSAI,This series had the most jaw dropping effects in it. The music at times can be repetitive but if you can put that aside you grow to love the main characters and the cases they go on. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and every so often you jump due to shock or surprise when something creepy shows up. There are some scenes that do make you cry but all in all it is an excellent series.,1373932800,,390,3.8875

4189041,5,B003SPDSAI,"I'm VERY satisfied with this anime. Everything from the voice acting to animation is done extremely well, especially the design and sounds on the entities they encounter (Vlad the Impaler X.X). The only downsides I have is that the ending leaves off  with you wanting SOOOO much more, that and the final episode (no spoilers) introduces a completely new aspect to the series that makes you say ""wow! I cant wait to see how they integrate this new thing into the rest of the episodes!"" And then abruptly ends :( .

Overall though definitely a MUST watch since it adds 2 elements that are hard to find in alot of animes. One is fear,and the other is it opens up your spiritual mind by introducing you to many cultures takes on the ""afterlife.""

And be sure to watch it at night while your alone, preferably with popcorn and some hot chocolate like I did! :D

Edit- I forgot to mention that last September they introduced another part of the ghost hunt series that supposedly takes place after the anime finished, its called (Akumu no Sumu Ie: Ghost Hunt)
So its possible that this series may be continued as an anime, but if it is, it'll probably take until 2014 to hear of the announcement, and if were lucky we'll get a continuation of the anime in early 2015.",1362009600,2,1260,4.5131578947368425

4189043,4,B003SPDSAI,"It is close to a cliche of the show ""Ghost Hunters"" but it is a given twist of a one sided love story between Mai and Kazuya. GIven a difference of having a fun loving monk that is in a rock band part time, a Catholic priest at the age of 17 that is supposedly strong in his faith and a faithful friend and co-worker, a shrine maiden that was not brought up in a family who took care of a shrine but was a rich family and she was a spoiled brat, and a medium that has the hots for the boss of the ghost hunting agency. Within all the seat clinching episodes and the sick twists of each part in each case there is a sense of a strong family type friendship that all of the group has and had. If the writers of this series could make a second season I would be the first one in line to buy it at any cost!

Plot - so cool! There are a lot of great ghost stories in here. I've never been really scared by horror movies but even I felt a chill creep up my spine a time or two and came to regret watching this at night alone. Really hit that creepy factor. My only no here would be that, with each section featuring a ghost story, the overall interaction between the characters often falls by the wayside when it comes to relationship development or learning about anyone's past.

Ending - like with most animes it leaves a little to be desired. Not everything is explained and most things are left unresolved but I still thought it tied everything up pretty nicely.

I highly recommend it.",1354233600,,821,4.533783783783784

Before purchasing this, I had rented Set 1 (which only has seven episodes) from my local video store, because I had been eyeing it for a long time before I actually got to rent it. I have to say, even having only watched seven eps, I found it very interesting. It has the perfect mixture of comedy and scariness. Though I warn you, if you're expecting it to be like one of those ghost hunting shows on TV, you've got another thing coming. In this series, you'll experience some of the most hardcore ghost hauntings you've ever seen (besides in horror movies)!

It centers around Mai. Mai is a high school girl that joins a supernatural research team. Naru is the leader of this team. He's kind of a self deluded jerk, but he's the best supernatural investigator around. The team investigates all sorts of different phenomenon, and each story is pretty interesting and surprising.

The animation and voice acting in this anime are very good. They really capture the creepiness of each investigation pretty well. I can't say anything bad about this title. It's a whole lot of fun. I'm only gonna give it 4 stars b/c there are a few horror animes out there that are better. Shiki is the best horror anime I've seen up to now.

I liked all the characters and think that this would be a fun series to rewatch in the future once I've forgotten all of the stories. These ghost hunters sometimes run into real hauntings and sometimes into fake ones or at least non-ghost related which I think makes it a lot more interesting because you never know if it's a real ghost or not.,1335744000,,455,4.3023255813953485
4189100,5,B003SPDSAI,"This anime is a hidden gem. I stumbled across this anime while looking for other paranormal animes. I'm so happy that I did.

One of the greatest things about this anime is its characters. The personalities of each character are so engaging and memorable. One of the main selling points of this anime is the interactions the characters have with each other. Because of this it will make you want to keep watching more and more.

The story line is amazing, and the arcs to this anime are kept short, maybe around three or four episodes. This is what keeps the whole anime enjoyable because it does not frustrate the view waiting for the story or arc to end.

While a lot of people say this anime is scary, I did not. I found one arc a bit scary but that's just me, and I don't do scary well. This anime is mostly about the suspensefulness, and keeps the creepiness of the anime to a minimum. Though, I was known to go throughout the house and turn on lights, my friend too. The anime has the magic to keep you glued to your screen, which is the purpose of the suspensefulness and minimum creepiness.

I loved the humor in this anime, it was very enjoyable. While it about be serious a little bit, it is mostly funny, and I would end up laughing like a madman.

To be honest, I would recommend this anime, and say I wish there was more! Just watch this anime, it won't disappoint.",1333929600,,1378,4.325581395348837
4189101,4,B003SPDSAI,"***Ending Spoilers at THE END of the review***

I would have to say that this movie is work watching for those that appreciate ghost stories enough to sit through 26 episodes of them. This is a fun mystery case series that reminds me of Sherlock Holmes meets the Poltergeist. I think those that love a great mystery would enjoy the series. The characters are a bit cliche but they add their charm.

okay,, ***spoiler***

The reason for 4 stars is because the ending could not leave an audience feel more confused than what just happened. Naru suddenly has a power that allows him to shoot crazy poltergeists and ghosts that he doesn't demonstrate until the end of the episode and they never resolve why the lead girl receives these visions of Naru.",1330214400,,748,4.651515151515151

I like that the stories are developed beyond a 30 minute short, but over several episodes.  The characters are fun that they are all different in some ways but still can function as one team.  I grew up watching some of the ""traditional"" Asian styles of ghost busting if you will and understand the different methods.

I watched these with my girls who are major ghost story types (they like shows like ghost hunters, most haunted), but one story in particular really creep them out more than I thought.

The plot does crawl by at times but that seems typical of quite a few anime series and it has become rather enjoyable.
The mixture of different personalities made for a good cast.
There were a couple of times at then ends of certain episodes where the suspense just caught one's spirit.
And the building difficulty and danger of the cases was a very good part of the plot.
I picked this up on a whim and got a nice surprise.

Certain characters I knew were more than they portrayed to be from the beginning.
The ending did not disappoint.",1316304000,10,597,4.378378378378378
4189126,4,B003SPDSAI,"So I will do my best to keep this spoiler free.  You can glance at my profile and see that I am an anime nut (reviewed many, many series).  I purchased this sigh unseen because of the low price and the high ratings.  I am actually glad I did.

The series is played out very well.  There is only one single stand alone episode, otherwise the story arcs are grouped into 3 to 5 episode series (files as they call them).  This actually gives the show time to really get into and flesh out the story of each arc.  The characters are rather ordinary; your typical Japanese anime cast: the quiet, dreamy guy; the dense young school age girl; the wise, slightly older 'sister' figure; the older brother figure; the rival gal; and the one odd person (the priest).  They do interact humorously at times, though often they seem to be acted very strictly within their archetype.

Animation is slick and consistent throughout.  Voice acting is good quality.  The intro and exit themes are rather bland, but the music is kind of nice.

*** Very light spoilers (won't really ruin anything by knowing... might actually improve the show through first watching!) ***

When the show first starts, you are given some interesting supernatural treats.  Of course the 'ghosts' eventually make an appearance (you wouldn't have 26 episodes if not!), but for awhile you are left wondering.  When they do, it is very 'spooky'.  Apparitions, banshees, possessed people and dolls, will o' wisps, etc... Things progress very well with some interesting influences from different cultures and religions making appearances (shinto priestess, buddhist monk, Catholic priest, occultist, paranormal investigator).  I found this to be a really neat aspect.

The second to the last story arc is by far the best.  It combines some interesting lore and a real sense of impending danger and risk of death.  The final story arc is complete garbage.  Complete. Garbage.  Up until this point the show was a FIVE but the last four episodes were a TWO at best.  And only a two because of the quality animation.

***SPOILER***
Let's just say it reminds me of Dragon Ball Z meets ghosts and zombies.  Yeah...

great emotions. The storyline and the events that keep happening makes you want to watch it all night. It's spell binding.
PERIOD. The ghosts got me stuck on my seat. Ghost hunt is a anime i will enjoy watching over again and again.
