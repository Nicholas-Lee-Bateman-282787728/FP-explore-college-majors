Alas, while it was fun to see an elder Joe still kicking it in this 1993 Japanese detective release, his role amounted to not much more than an elongated cameo.  I should have been paying more attention to the the tongue in cheek name given to the main character, Maiku Hama (as in Mike Hammer), to know where this movie was likely going.

Most of the film tries to interject a little bit of that kind of humor into the noir, coming across in some ways as more of a Magnum PI funny guy TV series than any sort of tough Mickey Spillane character (this film was actually the first in a series of three films with the same detective).

The movie lacks mostly from the lead character never quite establishing an identity. One minute he's beating up 5 guys just a day or two after having a severed finger reattached, and in the next scene he's coming across as a bumbler who would be afraid of his own shadow.  Street smart one moment, he becomes naive for much of the movie when convenient for the plot.

The movie is actually at its best for about its middle third when it focuses more on one of his clients, and the detective himself fades into the background. He almost comes across as a foil in his own movie, but the subtext between two lost brothers (one of which hires Hama) helps to somewhat salvage the film.

The movie tries to make some commentary on how hard it can be to rise above one's past and create a new future, and also features some racial tension as Koreans, Chinese, and Tawainese start to immigrate into traditional Japan. But for the most part it feels more like a long TV episode that is unsure of its character or genre.  The confusing ending includes an advertisement for the next installment in the series, one I think most viewers won't mind missing. If you're looking for good Asian noir I would much more recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pale-Flower-The-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B004NWPY4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pale Flower (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>].

I highly recommend this movie. beware, if your a lazy movie watcher (doesn't want to read subtitles), then this movie is not for you.",1280188800,,358,4.188405797101449
8011845,2,B0001FVDPK,"Joining together such forces as American noir, Japanese gangster, the always enjoyable (see sarcasm) French New Wave, and low-brow comedy, ""The Most Terrible Time in My Life"" is a complex who-done-it that never quite leaves the ground until the third and final act.  Attempting to keep audiences attentions by introducing random acts of violence (like the sliced finger and repetitive punch to the leg), our central story remains weak and disjointed.  From the beginning, where a random detective (located within a theater) stands up for a seemingly weak mahjongg waiter, we just don't get enough information about the basics of film - the why, who, where, and how - to really care about these two ""friends"" next course of action.  Our director leads us down paths which involve gangsters, missing brothers, misplaced marriages, and then into the dark void of nothingness, until the final act (which I will not give away), that makes you stand up, gain an once of respect for this film, and perhaps eager to see the supposed sequel.

With such a variety of different homage happening in this film, director Kaizo Hayashi has his hands full.  After two viewings of the first thirty minutes of this film, I knew I was going to have my hands full.  There is just too much happening without further detailed explanations.  As an audience, linear is not the only option.  One cannot complain about strong storytelling, intriguing characters, and a plot that keeps your mind focused on detail, but with ""MTTiML"" there was nothing of the sort.  Hayashi replaces all of these important facets of cinema with cute images.  Hama has a retro American car, he holds office in a movie theater that ironically dictates his life, and sometimes gets angry for no reason.  There is also some back story about his mother, his sister, and an angry police officer that we are only privy to small flashbacks of.  There was more to tell with this story, something that would eventually lead to that entertaining third act, but alas, there was nothing.  As my eyes grew heavy, as Hayashi pulled further into a world that had no central meaning, I was ready to give up - but then, that third act.  Just watch this film for the final moments, where we have some central conflict, our black and white turns to color, and finally we have some music to accompany the images.  That will tell you enough about this film to see the truth.

Overall, I cannot stand behind this feature.  Within the second viewing there were hopes that it would become more connected, that our characters wouldn't just seem like cheap clichs of themselves, but it never happened.  There were three to five great scenes that demonstrated the power of Hayashi's ability to control the camera and lead his actors, but those were nearly drowned out by the dull nature of the rest of the picture.  The concept was there, it was the execution that was flimsy.  One viewing, that is all you need - it will either entertain or provide a good night's rest.  You can be the judge.

Grade: ** out of **** (merely for that third act, one could watch those final twenty minutes again and again)",1226793600,,3131,4.748613678373383

Hopefully this might get the message across which is otherwise very hard to do.",1173312000,,151,4.206896551724138
8011847,3,B0001FVDPK,"""The Most Terrible Time In My Life,"" is one of those quirky films that you really don't hear about too often. I happened to stumble across the Video several years ago, and picked up the DVD a few years back. This is a Japanese film, which is shot in black and white to give it that old film noir look. However, you can tell by the scenes that the film is modern. The film was released in 1993, in Japan. The film mixes tame violence [sort of] with comedy. I thought that it was an interesting watch, and it just might appeal to those viewers who like modern noir. Especially Japanese modern noir. Moreover, the films use of parody is not too over the top, and it is funny!

The film centers on a character named Maiku Hama (Masatoshi Nagase) who is a private eye. He is a very unorthodox private eye however, as his office is above a movie theatre. And if you want to enter his office you have to pay the price of admission. I have to admit that there were parts of this film where I really laughed out loud. Especially the scene where Maiku's sensei beats the hell out of him with a stick. That was hilarious! Plus the cinematography in this black and white film is very, very good. Also, if you like parodies of the old films from the 40s and 50s, then this film is definitely one for you.

Maiku Hama drives around in a ludicrous Nash Rambler [not your typical Japanese Private eye]. Moreover, he likes to gamble. While Maiku is gambling he gets into a mess with a Taiwanese waiter; and it is here the films narrative begins. Maiku looks for the waiters missing brother, and in the process finds himself in trouble with both Hong Kong and Taiwanese mobsters who are attempting to form a new type of Yakuza. The film is entertaining and different, but may not appeal to all viewers. The ending is really not an ending; however, as there appears to be a sequel or two to this particular episode. I have not seen them, but if I come across them I'll probably purchase them. Don't take the film too seriously, it's a fun film and meant to be a parody.

8011848,4,B0001FVDPK,"Very fresh and intriguing. Noir film with a wicked sense of humour. I loved the lead character-- a hard-boiled detective with a heart of gold. The only regret about the story I had is the absence of the protagonist for about 20 minutes of the film when it focused on Yang. Please see this movie if you get a chance-- It's very different from the usual gangster flicks  out there. At this price, it's a bargain. I wish the DVD had included some more extras, but apart from that it's great.",1093046400,9,488,4.362637362637362
