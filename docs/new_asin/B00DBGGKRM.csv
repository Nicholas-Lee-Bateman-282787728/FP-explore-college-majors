5787209,4,B00DBGGKRM,"Reminiscent of every heist movie ever made and highly influenced by Ocean's 11, this Korean film overcomes any script flaws due largely to the charm and skill of leading man Cha Tae-Hyun and the amazing supporting cast hilighted by more spectacular performances from Shin Jeung-Kun, Ko Chan-Seok, Kim Hyang-Gi and Cheon Bo-Keun, the latter two who would go on to co-star together in the Queen's Class TV series.  Great, great fun. FInd it. Enjoy it.",1377734400,,449,4.986666666666666

5787212,5,B00DBGGKRM,"Very cool ""Oceans Eleven"" Korean style. I enjoyed all the characters. Imaginative take on the heist plot. Exciting, stylish and I actually liked the characters. I've said it once, I'll say it again, way better than the crap coming out of Hollywood these days. Hollywood should stay out of politics and arrogance and take a clue from the Koreans. Quality can still be made in Hollywood, if they cared enough about their audience.",1495065600,,428,4.876712328767123

5787225,4,B00DBGGKRM,"Is the Korean remake of Ocean's 11 set in the Joseon Dynasty (1776). A team of: a foppish bastard son of a noble, an X-royal guard, the queen of diving, an information expert, a financial backer, a grave robber, an explosives expert, a master of disguise, a rumor-spreader, a bandit, and a young boy.
This motley crew teams up to steal from the noble family who have monopolized the trade of ice in the kingdom!
The movie is fun, funny, a light hearted action romp. If you like Romancing the Stone and ever wondered what Ocean's 11 remade by Korea and set during the Joseon Dynasty would look like. This movie is somehow what your very very very specific desires want.",1479081600,2,668,4.528925619834711

5787228,5,B00DBGGKRM,"Absolutely hilarious on so many levels!  This is the Korean version of The Seven Samurai in a comedic vein!  Nice roles for women and kids too!  The plot is about stealing ice from an ice monopoly.  Its symbolism for power and monopoly trade.  Like Ocean's Eleven, a motley ragtag band of thieves steal the ice and the gold to give it back to the people and newly crowned king, respectively.  They start out as rough cut characters, but turn out to be morally upright citizens by movie's end.  The kids are cute, the women charming and feline, the men stoic and exaggeratedly clownish.

Very entertaining for a family to watch.  You can laugh with the storyline plot, then laugh some more at the Korean cartoonish characters which are much less subtle than Western counterparts in their humor.  Most of all, there is no angst anywhere, just good fun.  My kind of film.  Too much angst on the world stage these days, so this type of movie is pure relaxation.  Definitely recommend!",1476057600,3,980,4.6608187134502925

5787242,4,B00DBGGKRM,"My Sassy Girl was a weird but tremendous watch, so I went looking to see what else were on the two leads' r&eacute;sum&eacute;, which is how I came across Tae-hyun Cha's period caper film. The Grand Heist (original title: Baramgwa hamjje sarajida) came out the same year, 2012, as another South Korean heist film, The Thieves (original title: Dodookdeul). But while The Thieves is a somber thriller that takes place in more contemporary times, The Grand Heist is a rollicking affair set in late 18th Century Korea, during the Josean era. Back in those days, ice, considered a most invaluable merchandise, moved the economy like nothing else. When a shady ice trader corners the market on ice and sets about fixing the prices, well, maybe someone should do something.

Our guy Tae-hyun Cha plays Lee Duk-moo, a laze-about who hangs around book stores picking up western habits - like the ""okay"" sign - from the book store owner. Lee Duk-moo happens to be son to the Second Vice-Premier, so you'd think he'd have some pull. Except he's also son to a concubine, so there goes his pull. And he's clever; he just chose not to take the civil service exam. He would've been fine shirking thru life without a care and chasing the oblivious Baek Soo-ryun (Hyo-rin Min) - she works in an orphanage - but then he and his best friend, the book store owner, are framed by corrupt officials and the best friend slain. To bail his son out, Duk-moo's father, the Second Vice-Premier, allows himself to be demoted and forced into hard labor. Tragic sh-- like that tends to bollocks one's habit of dilly dallying.

And then there's Baek Dong-soo (Ji-ho Oh), stoic special guard to the royal ice house. At the start, Dong-soo is portrayed as always having a runny nose, and this may seem like a comic bait, except there's no payoff, and he later on loses the runny nose. Dong-soo is a doughty warrior and he takes his job seriously. When he intervenes in those same corrupt officials' forced labor scam, they set their sights on him, frame his butt as well.

So here we have Dong-soo and Duk-moo, both of them itching for justice. Duk-moo has hatched a con to get back at the jerks, and Dong-soo reluctantly plays along. So then we get to that time-honored part of every heist movie: the recruitment drive. For Duk-moo's serpentine plan to work, he requires experts in certain fields: a tomb raider, a transportation wizard, an explosives expert, an information broker, a master of disguise, a money man, etc. I could picture Duk-moo turning to Dong-soo and saying, ""You think we need one more? Yeah, we need one more."" The tricky con also has to make room for snagging the big bad's hidden accounting book and a secret stash of gold. It's why I got the giggles - and was impressed - when Dong-soo was able to rapidly suss out the master plan just by eyeballing Duk-moo's sketches on the wall.

It's one of those ""don't think about it too much lest it ruin the fun"" kind of movies. The con does seem too tricky for its own good. I don't think the con required that many people; they're at least three people too cumbersome. Not to mention, just about practically everyone but the two lead dudes get short shrift in terms of character development. And here's a **SPOILER** alert for the rest of the paragraph: the film doesn't have follow-thru when it comes to killing off the heisters. They set up the explosives expert and the tomb raider to have their own individual grand deaths - but, no, they make it out okay. I guess the film realized that those are impactless demises seeing as the characters hadn't been fleshed out enough for us to give a crap.

The film doesn't neglect the period piece portion of the heist movie. The color and culture and costumes are depicted in grand fashion, and I'm taking it for granted that they're historically accurate enough. There's a strong whiff of social commentary, a mention of the class barrier between the haves and have-nots, fleeting scenes of sickly children and inmates perishing for lack of ice and, in the dining halls of the priveleged, hey, it's a freakin' phoenix carved in ice!

Our two leads, Tae-hyun Cha and Ji-ho Oh, work well together and drive the movie on the strength of their performances. Tae-hyun Cha is really good at being a likable rogue. Ji-ho Oh's part is more restrained, but he's the designated action hero and featured in a lot of combat scenes where he impresses with his physicality. The Grand Heist, in its own way, is as enjoyable as The Thieves. It's more tongue-in-cheeked and isn't as tautly plotted out and the stakes don't seem to be as high. And, me, I'm just not that big a fan of childish fart gags. An above average 3.5 out of 5 stars for The Grand Heist, for its madcap ways and the two leads' charisma and for the master of disguise who may or may not have the, uh, stamina for the job. Either way, he made me smile most. I loved the throwaway gags in which the crew would gather in a room and someone would always start at seeing this stranger who, of course, always turns out to be the master of disguise in disguise.",1469059200,4,5091,4.601321585903084

Each good guy (and gal) has specific skills that are needed for the team to accomplish this mission of a grand heist.

5787305,3,B00DBGGKRM,For some light hearted fare. The assembly of characters had enough variety though they didn't figure prominently enough in their own right (probably due to their narrow expertise). The fight scenes were about average and lead characters didn't have that dominant a presence.,1436313600,,274,5.395348837209302

I do admit that it's interesting to see these actors doing slapstick comedy, but for the most part, the story, the acting and the action is not very good.",1434672000,,261,4.531914893617022

5787334,3,B00DBGGKRM,"I noticed that some of the plot is strikingly similar to the Korean TV series DR. JIN, not only that but many of the characters in  this movie are very similar as well, and to round things off, many of the main actors bore at least a modest resemblance to the actors in Dr. Jin. It was released late the same year, but I see no obvious connections like a director or production company. Any way, it is an enjoyable, comic heist. It seems a bit plodding at times and even though it comes in at 2 hours some of the plot lines seen underdeveloped, I may be looking at it that way because Dr Jin was a TV series and had time to elucidate us on why things were happening as they did, that's difficult in a movie. At times I was also reminded of The Good, The Bad and The Weird (which had some really weird characters) The Grand Heist is a light comedy adventure, I did not laugh out loud and there is really little physical comedy but it is enjoyable.",1422144000,,946,4.141304347826087
5787335,5,B00DBGGKRM,"A fabulous and entertaining movie.  The characters were lovable, and the villains were hateable--just as they should be.

8591278,5,B00DBGGKRM,"Korean movies have come a long way over the years and this one is a gem.  Take a bunch of lovable criminals and have them plot to rip off members of the Korean nobility who are little better than the mafia.  Korean humor is at times slap stick and at other times very subtle, sometimes that's hard for Americans to keep up with.  What isn't hard to keep up with are the subtitles.  Where some people probably are turned off and will never watch a movie that they have to read, the Koreans slow their speech down to allow the reading to keep up which makes it much less stressful.  Something else that Americans will have trouble understanding is that in the monarchy of Korea even if a child had a noble Father if he was born to a concubine he was definitely treated as little better than commoners.  They were blocked from certain jobs no matter their intelligence or skill.",1523664000,,875,4.403726708074534
