There is a scene where someone asks Wings what to do and Wings response is to start a mob of pure rainbow coalition justice. It's not even the most wild thing you'll see in the movie or for that matter the most wild decision in the film. Between the neo nazi villains who have put a little too much thought and effort into their interior decorating to sex scenes that are shot in most shockingly uncomfortable ways possible, you have so much more to choose from.
It's written, directed, cast with Hauser family members, and starring Wings. It's the most Wings movie you'll ever get. It has all the hallmarks. The wild James Cagney acting. The same locations you've seen in a million other Wings Hauser movies. Constant over the top examples of extreme alcoholism. Most importantly, he gives you yet another hero who isn't really that good at much of anything, never learns, and yet somehow gets all the credit at the end. He gives us a little extra here. It's got a shockingly arty ending and some interesting editting. Fever dream is about the best way to describe some of the montages. They feel like a cross up between a music video, Tarkovsky on crack, and images from episodes of OZ and The Shield. I won't spoil the ending but even in it's lunacy they get a little reality in there.
I joked a lot about Wings here but it's cause he's fun. He's super fun actually. However, he's one of those guys that clearly never got the breaks other did so he had to work. He had ambition to be more and it shows here. He got in the most art and creativity he could on no  budget, most likely an extremely tight deadline, and probably not a lot of support from veteran crew and actors outside of maybe some people behind the camera and Linda Blair. It's honestly wild to see how many times Hauser names pop in up in the credits. Hopefully, some day, Wings gets the credit he deserves because Gang Boys is a real gem of gutter art.",1465776000,,2100,4.426356589147287
