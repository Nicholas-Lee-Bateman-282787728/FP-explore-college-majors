2437743,5,B000BQPC42,"This is the best show ever!

All of you who said they live in Tennessee are wrong.  There is one episode that actually says where they are located.  The episode is a mock of the VH1 behind the music.  It's like the VH1 behind the Simpsons.  In that episode, they actually say what state the family is from.  I'm not going to give it away.  We'll just have to wait for the season with that episode on it to come out.

PS.  I  hope and pray that season 7 have normal packaging because I hate the plastic box that season 6 came in and was a bit disappointed with the replacement box because it still didn't look like the others.",1130284800,6,625,4.133333333333334
2437744,5,B000BQPC42,I have always liked the Simpsons show and can't wait for this season to come out. My favorite episode has always been the bible parody but I don't know what season 6 that will be on. Anyway only reason I am writing this is for the people who are crying about the case from season the plastic Homer head. They are trying something different for the fans that actually collect and 2nd of all that is why they included in the packaging a card that offered the alternative box for $2.95 so instead of whining search your couch for change and get the alternative box.

2437745,4,B000BQPC42,"This is perhaps the generally agreed upon best season the Simpsons have ever done, in terms of show quality.  If you get one season, get this one - they only go downhill from here.

2437746,5,B000BQPC42,"Alright Fox got smart releasing two versions, this one is obviosuly the one I'm picking up, don't need another cheap plastic head.  I keep hearing people say that they're going to have the 'standard' fold out packaging, although we do get a standard package, no one has seen it so we have no idea if it's going to be fold out or not.  Personally I hope 6 was just a fluke and that they go back to the exact style of 1-5.

2437747,5,B000BQPC42,"Just for the record, the special feature that aired before ""Who Shot Mr. Burns Part 2"" as an opener to Season 7 is known as ""Springfield's Most Wanted"", and was included as a special feature in the Season 6 box set. It makes more sense to put it after the first part of the story so fans can watch it between the two episodes. For reference, you can find it on disc 4, in the extras menu.

2437757,5,B000BQPC42,"""While many people claim one season is better than another or when a TV show used to be good in its day before things changed, The Simpsons, by no exception, is one of those famed TV shows that people loved and cherished but now see it as something of repetition and tired-old humour involving Homer's antics, Bart's bad-child behaviour, and Lisa's braniac scenarios. While people claim Season 4, 5, or 6 as the greatest seasons in Simpson history, I consider Season 7 (and likely Season 3) to be The Simpsons' greatest and Matt Groening and his team full of innovative, sharp-witted writers have made something truly special and reminiscent of my past that I cannot forget in this boxset that it is truly worth its 5-star marking. Here is a breakdown of the episodes and my opinions:...

WHO SHOT MR. BURNS? (PART 2)- A parody of the Who Shot J.R. episodes from Dallas, this second parter is the only Simpsons episode to have a part 1 and part 2. However, just because it is based off a legendary episode, does not mean it was all that memorable or good. While there are many innovative gags and references to Twin Peaks (i.e. Burns' suit), it felt a bit exhausting and bland considering that you have to watch Part 1 or buy Season 6 to like it.""

RADIOACTIVE MAN- Looks a lot like a Season 12 episode, this parody of The Incredible Hulk and Batman shows Milhouse auditioning for a part as Fallout Boy (a pun on Robin). It is a nice little gem and the references and mockery of Hollywood itself are enough to let the episode stand on its knees with a surprise joke about Mickey Rooney toward the end that is gobsmackingly hilarious.

HOME SWEET HOMEDIDDILY-DUM-DOODILY- Obviously a Ned Flanders episode, this one involving Bart, Lisa, and Maggie getting traded to be with the Flanders instead of angry Homer and Marge is a hilarious, crazy, and potentially offensive episode that successfully mocks bad parenting and Baptism to where no show has gone before. The best episode from this season point so far.

BART SELLS HIS SOUL- My favourite episode of all time because it is the first episode I've ever seen of The Simpsons. Coincidentally, it aired out a month earlier before the film Toy Story, my favourite Pixar film. Surprisingly dramatic in its approach dealing with religious redemption, fear, agnosticism, and a sense of being but still hilarious with classic, highly quotable scenes involving Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag frightening grin and Dr. Hibbert's family in the car. It is a cherished childhood memory as much as Raymond Briggs' The Snowman.

LISA THE VEGETARIAN- While not necessarily a laugh-out-loud episode like Bart Sells His Soul, it deals with the importance of individualism of a young girl (even if the subject is vegetarianism which is something I don't approve of). The episode is captivating, witty, and emotionally driven with some very memorable scenes involving ""you don't win friends with salad"" skit and a faux documentary about abbatoirs/slaughterhouses.

TREEHOUSE OF HORROR VI- Oh man, where do I start from here? Without bragging too much about it, Homer(Cubed) is one of this show's most innovative, funniest, daring, and awe-inspiring segments ever made in history. The CG aspect was still relatively new at the time (1995), rendered by the same group of people who would later do the Woody Allen film, Antz and Homer shines as a dufus in an alternative universe. Among the other two (one involving billboard monsters and a parody of the film, A Nightmare on Elm Street), they are just as hilarious, quotable, bizarre, and imaginative like Treehouse of Horror's greatest installment, number 4.

KING-SIZE HOMER- Silly and very funny episode that mocks people who abuse disability benefits to be lazy when Homer is even more obese in this caper. A popular episode among fans. Classic in its own right and certainly funnier when you see him try to go to the cinema.

MOTHER SIMPSON- This is a real tearjerker and a story about loss and love that many people who were abandoned in their lives could relate to. The ending scene gets you quite a lot to where you see Homer's mother leave him via coach with glittering stars is too hard to describe.

SIDESHOW BOB'S LAST GLEAMING- Not the strongest episode but one of the Sideshow Bob ones that is not as annoying as it comes across. The only great scene here is when Grampa drives a motorbike and says he'll be hauling ass to Lolapalooza. Here we go again, literally. This episode is one of those but still good.

THE SIMPSONS 138th EPISODE SPECTACULAR- Beyond funny and even more interesting when various clips are shown and given a sense of novelty about it. This episode showcases a history of The Simpsons that is contrived and bizarre but still works like Behind the Laughter and the late Phil Hartman does a good job making this great clip show episode (compared to the last one which was a bore) even better.

MARGE BE NOT PROUD- A sad, real yet moralistic episode about the consequences of theft. It is poignant, well-written, and emotionally driven like Bart Sells His Soul and makes use of a soft-spoken music score and some hilarious, memorable scenes involving virtual golf and Bonestorm, the game Bart wants.

TEAM HOMER- The kind of episode that you can watch over and over again. Homer and his Moe's Tavern buddies go out to break the skittles in this buddy episode with some hilarious sketches and a sense of urgency that reminded me of the great sports-themed episode, Homer at the Bat.

TWO BAD NEIGHBOURS- What the $#&! were they thinking? Neither claimed to be a political attack nor a satire, this bizarre plotline involves the Bush family residing in a mansion in Springfield is just about the funniest, most disturbing, and most twisted episode in Season 7. Much of an outcry to H.W. Bush's pro-Waltons mentality, the episode accomplishes at bashing their moralistic knackery into something profoundly silly yet violent at the same time.

SCENES OF THE CLASS STRUGGLE FROM SPRINGFIELD- Much like Lisa the Vegetarian, it is much like a Woody Allen sort-of comedy-drama critique on high society and Marge is the focus of a women's club. The episode works on so many levels and is heartfelt without being too preachy. It also feels like one of the more humanised Simpsons episodes in a while just like those back in Season 2 or 3.

BART THE FINK- Quirky and legitimately strong episode involving Krusty's tax evasion schemes. It is just as mysterious, exciting, richly written, and bold as a 1940s drama about greed. While not the greatest episode, it is certainly rich and adult in its approach.

LISA THE ICONOCLAST- Mystery and history link together as Lisa tries to find the truth behind Jebediah Springfield is as rich in its scope and satirical as Bart the Fink and episodes like Marge on the Monorail but this time, less obvious humour involved.

HOMER THE SMITHERS- Very classic and very engaging episode that is at times a bit too intense for a comedy. It deals with Smithers going on a vacation and Homer taking his position assisting Mr. Burns. It is so thrilling, funny, and bizarre that you don't know things might end even with Homer's stupidity in the picture.

THE DAY THE VIOLENCE DIED- Engaging story that involves copyright infringement, trust, loyalty, and the tricky animation industry itself, it is almost satirical as it is muckracking with some funny satirical moments taking stabs at Ralph Bakshi's Fritz the Cat and School House Rock's I'm Just a Bill...Recommended!

A FISH CALLED SELMA- The weakest episode in Season 7. Troy McClure hides his kinks to be falsely married with Selma is a little unsettling as a plotline but still works in some way. It felt like I was watching a cheesy drama from the 1980s and its satire just was not convincing enough as a whole. Give this one a miss.

BART ON THE ROAD- A very outlandish and awesome episode to watch especially when you're a child. Bart, Milhouse, Nelson, and Martin all go on a drive across America after Bart manages to finaegle around a fake I.D. This episode is so funny, action-packed, and silly in so many ways that one could only wonder what they're trying to accomplish here. It's even funnier when Nelson begs the gang to go see an Andy Williams concert and when Marge receives calls from foreign sources.

22 SHORT FILMS ABOUT SPRINGFIELD- One of the most innovative, challenging, and daring episodes ever made, a collection of vignettes compressed for 20 minutes of animation is so quotable, hilarious, driven, and enjoyable that it is hard to look away especially knowing the fact that this is really an homage to Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction with scenes mocking the Quarter Pounder scene and the notorious hostage scene. It's actually better than Pulp Fiction too.

THE CURSE OF THE FLYING HELLFISH- Peculiar and often rarely-aired adventure episode with Grampa and Bart off on a treasure expedition is thrilling, funny, and intriguing to watch all-at-once. It serves better toward the ending when there is a campy German art collector driving off listening to techno.

MUCH APU ABOUT NOTHING- Hot-topic episode about immigration is striking, brisk, and funny in so many places almost as if Capra done comedy. Apu is fearing deportation unless he passes his citizenship test in America and his journey of fear but hope is well-written to be a contender in this show's best satires.

HOMERPALOOZA- Classic cult episode with some hilarious satirical jabs at indie music culture in the 1990s. Homer as the cannonball man is amusing but it is the whole wacky and music-driven environment here that makes Homerpalooza stand out especially the stoner-like credits.

SUMMER OF 4' 2""- While not a strong one here, The Summer of 4' 2"" is more a coming-of-age dramedy than a full-out adventure with Lisa mingling with the new kids around a new town. It feels emotionally driven but is a bit sketchy and less memorable than Lisa the Vegetarian or the better, Lisa the Skeptic.

FIVE BEST EPISODES (in chronological order): 1) Bart Sells His Soul; 2) Treehouse of Horror VI; 3) 22 Short Films About Springfield; 4) Homer the Smithers; and 5) King-Size Homer.
It is certainly worth your money with about 25 episodes all-at-once with excellent scripts and animation to go along with. While it is animated, it is given a TV-PG for a reason and do expect adult themes, violent situations, language, and sexual innuendo that you may not find in SpongeBob SquarePants or even The Flintstones.

I love bits and pieces of each and every season, but there is not an episode I do not like during all of those years.  What else can I say about this, I mean, it's the Simpsons for crying out loud!  Enough said!",1327104000,,572,4.0625
2437767,5,B000BQPC42,"If I had to shortlist the best seasons of THE SIMPSONS, this one would be a no-brainer to make the cut. The problem is, it contains so many outstanding and even classic episodes that reviewing them all would blast Amazon's word-limit on reviews to pieces. So I'll try to keep this short and to the point.

A lot of what makes THE SIMPSONS funny is its weird combination of Three Stooges-style slapstick farce and wonderfully acid social commentary.  But let's face it, it's the characters that sell the series. Homer's stupidity. Bart's mischief. Mr. Burns' villainy. Smithers' toadying. Chief Wiggum's bumbling. Troy McClure's smarminess. Lionel Hutz's incompetence. Barney's alcoholism. Moe's misanthropy. Krusty's degeneracy. Milhouse's...well, Milhouse, period. And in Season 7, you get some of the best character moments you'll ever see. For example:

""Radioactive Man"" - Milhouse beats out Bart for the role of Fallout Boy in the `Radioactive Man' movie, but discovers fame ain't all it's cracked up to be. (""I've said `Jiminy Jillickers' so many times it's lost all meaning."")
""King Size Homer"" - Homer deliberately gains 60 pounds so he go on medical disability and ""work"" from home. This is Homer at his absolutely moronic best.
""Two Bad Neighbors"" - Arguably the most notorious episode of the entire series to date, Homer gets in a blood feud with his new next door neighbor, George H.W. Bush.
""Lisa the Iconoclast"" - Lisa discovers the founder of Springfield was actually a murderous pirate. Homer's turn as the Town Cryer is one of the best gags he ever pulled.
""Homer the Smithers"" - Homer subs for Smithers as Burns' assistant, but can't endure the old man's constant abuse. This is one of my favorite Burns episodes (""I know which is the velocitator and which is the deceleratrix."")
""Much Apu About Nothing"" - Making fun of political issues is risky because the jokes can get dated; luckily, in America, no immigration joke is ever going to date. This episode also has one of the great endings.
""Team Homer"" - Homer's plot to get Burns to finance his bowling league backfires when the old man decides he wants to join the team. The part where Apu looks at Team Stereotype and says, `They begged me to join their team; begged me!' is effing hilarious.

The truth is, it's almost impossible to single out inidvidual eps for praise. ""Treehouse of Horror VI"" is about as good an entry in that subseries as you will ever find, ""Lisa the Vegetarian"" has one of the funniest Homerisms of the entire series (Homer cannot believe pork chops, hot dogs and ham come from the same animal), and ""Marge Be Not Proud"" features one of the best Homer rants of all time when he catches Bart shoplifting: ""How could you?!  Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church?  Captain Whatshisname?  We live in a society of laws.  Why do you think I took you to all those ""Police Academy"" movies?  For fun?  Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing! Did you?!"" In addition, ""22 Short Films About Springfield"" is a brilliant piece of writing and ""Who Shot Mr. Burns? Part 2"", while relying heavily on clips from Part 1, is a very funny windup to a notorious episode.

I guess I can end this by saying that if you have any love for this show at all, this season qualifies as a must-have; and if you grew up on Mars and have never watched THE SIMPSONS, this would be a terrific way to introduce you to the series.",1320451200,,3427,4.742857142857143

I'm currently almost 22 years old and still love them, that tells you how the simpsons is for all ages. While I won't willingly watch a dvd (I know all the episodes, all the jokes, in english, spanish and even the audio commentaries) I still watch them on TV, since (at least where I'm from) they're on almost all the time. I still enjoy them.

There's a little pocket in the corner where the booklet is supposed to be included (and has been on previous seasons), but it's empty. I just talked to Amazon customer service and they said there is a note for this product in the customer service system that the booklet is not included. I'm going to try to track one down from Fox Home Video (which makes the DVDs), but I'm not holding my breath.

But it wasn't until I started collecting the seasons on DVD that I started to put the episodes I remembered from childhood into their proper order. Season seven features, among others, the conclusion to Who Shot Mr. Burns? The Treehouse of Horror episode isn't one of my favorites but it's not horrible either. I'd have to say my favorite sketch is where Homer finds a portal to and becomes trapped in a strange 3-dimensional plain. We also have Two Bad Neighbors, where former president George H. W. Bush moves in across the street and becomes embroiled in a prank war with Homer. My absolute favorite episode of the season though would have to be Bart VS. Australia, not the least because of the catchy, digeridoo-rich rendition of the end credits theme. And of course we have a fun audio commentary track for each episode as well, so this season should keep you occupied for quite a while. I definitely feel it's one of the must-haves for anyone wanting to collect. Seasons one through twelve are where I still feel the series had it going. After that though, it seemed they started to rely too much on guest characters for the laughs. Season seven is still one of the best though.",1238198400,,1267,4.610619469026549

In Season 7, we witness some of the craziest things the yellow skinned family has done. It starts where Season 6 left off, when they discover who shot Mr. Burns. Lisa begins her vegetarian lifestyle, Homer gains a bunch of weight to get himself some worker's compensation, former President George H.W. Bush moves next door to the family, Bart and Lisa discover some shocking truths around the town, Milhouse gains the role of Fallout Boy, and Bart gets a fake I.D. at his visit to the DMV.

2437792,5,B000BQPC42,"The early part of the Simpsons usually revolved around Bart and his antics since he was deemed the ""mascot"" of the show. Then the show hit its stride, arguably starting during season 4 and became a clever satirical show that was funny and many inside jokes. While I wouldn't call recent seasons awful, the over-reliance on guest stars and zany plots made you appreciate the older episodes more so while season 7 isn't really the best season, it's certainly episode by episode one of the more stronger and consistent seasons. These are some highlights from each disc.

The season starts with part II of Who Shot Mr Burns which was kind of disappointing. While the resolution is fine, the awesomeness of Part I is kind of missing. Lisa the Vegetarian finds Lisa trying to do away with meat, only everyone's not into it. Rather unnecessary appearance by another Beatle, Paul McCartney and his wife at the time, Linda. In a nice change, Bart sells his soul for 5$ thinking it's for suckers only realizing he really did(in the episode titled, what else, Bart Sells His Soul.

Mother Simpson has Glenn Close appearing as Homer's thought-to-be-dead mother. Very funny and a quite touching ending. The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular has Troy hosting a special on the Simpsons with deleted scenes, footage from the Tracey Ullman shorts and alternate Who Shot Mr Burns animation. Favorite line: ""now, here's what we all came to see: hardcore nudity!"" Marge Be Not Proud finds Bart caught when he shoplifts and his mom doesn't act motherly anymore. Another sweet ending.

Lisa the Iconoclast has her uncovering a secret that completely can change Springfield's vision of their founder Jebediah Springfield. Normally Lisa episodes aren't very funny but this made me laugh at times. Homer the Smithers finds Homer having to care for Burns when Smithers leaves which you think would be easy. The Day the Violence Died has a bum claiming he was the creator of Itchy and Scratchy. Has a very weird but really cool ending.

22 Short Films about Springfield is a cool idea where events intersect in various ways. Much Apu about Nothing suddenly finds Apu in danger of being deported unless he can get his citizenship test aced, with Homer as his teacher. Season finale Summer of 4 Ft. 2 finds the family at Ned's summer house where Lisa tries to make new friends by being someone else.

By this time, a lot of the episodes were usually not classics but they were funny regardless. Even bad episodes had some funny moments. From Homer's fight with President Bush(the old one) to a flying barbecue pig to the Planet of the Apes parody, it's a pretty solid season. Only problem with the season is that the Simpson best episodes aren't as apparent. Besides select ones like 22 Short Films, Mother Simpson or King-Size Homer, most of them fall in that great but not awesome group but still that's pretty good.

Available in Marge shaped head packaging and standard packaging, it's funny nice to be given a chance but one weird thing: there's one slip case then a normal case, then the actual case that carries the discs. It's nothing much, it's just odd. However, it's still a solid season you should pick up.",1157846400,3,3190,4.801457194899818

This franchise was and still is a true classic.  In fact, its a classic in its lifetime.  I can't list all the great episodes here, but I will mention one of my favorites.  A classic which adds a little normalcy to a regularly dysfunctional family.  The episode when the Simpsons go on vacation, with the family.  Lisa has her yearbook, which not one person signed, and meets up with some new cool kids.  She decides to change her image, to be cool.

The kids don't know her normal life, and her brother, Bart, and friend ruin her secret.  At the end, she gets her yearbook back, and her new ""friends"" have all signed her book even though she's been untruthful with them.

Bittersweet and cute.

2437794,5,B000BQPC42,"Some of my all time favorite episodes are on this set. I'm amazed that people either consider this the peak of the Simpsons or the start of the decline. Because seasons 3-6 are undeniably the stuff of television legend I will not say that season 7 is better than any of those seasons. However I do think it is up to par with them and that is saying a lot. As far as this being the start of the decline I don't agree with that. However, Homerpalooza is probably my least favorite episode of seasons 1-7. Homerpalooza is a good example of some of the uninspired stories that would come in future seasons. The heavy reliance on guest voices (especially non-actors) can really ruin a Simpsons episode. But I think this season as a whole is just to good to give less than 5 stars even considering that clunker of an episode.

2437802,4,B000BQPC42,"I still consider ""The Simpsons"" Season 7 to be a very good season, and great by ordinary television standards, but still, you could view it as the beginning of the fall of The Simpsons. Seasons 3-6 are generally considered ""the classic"" seasons, and while most people agree Seasons 7 and 8 are very good (while Season 9 simply fell off a cliff and became ""The New Simpsons"") they don't match up to the ""classic"" seasons.

But hey, who cares, right? It's almost like saying ""Temple Of Doom"" isn't as good as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Good enough, right? And great, compared to most everything else.

The DVD extras were a slight step down from past seasons in terms of how interesting or ""must watch"" they were, but still, they're better than a lot of DVD extras. The commentaries, in my opinion, have suffered the steepest decline. Matt Groening is absent on more of them than ever, and while David X. Cohen picks up some of the slack, he's not as entertaining as he was on the Futurama DVDs, and less David Mirkin, few cast member appearances, and no Al Jean and Mike Reiss (they were long gone at this point) made the commentaries less humorous and interesting than past ones. For my idea of what makes a commentary ""humorous and interesting"" listen to the commentary on episodes like ""Duffless,"" ""Selma's Choice,"" ""Last Exit To Springfield"" and the wonderfully wacky commentary for ""The Otto Show."" The commentaries for these episodes are drier and more straightforward.

Anyway, without further ado, here are my short reviews on the individual episodes in this set:

1- Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two) - 7/10. It doesn't have the greatest replay value like other episodes, but it's still good. The alternate ending was quite amusing.

2- Radioactive Man - 9/10. Very good episode where Springfield takes advantage of Hollywood as they film the new movie ""Radioactive Man"" and cast Milhouse as his sidekick Fallout Boy, to Bart's dismay. Watch with commentary to learn which line in this episode Matt Groening considers one of his all-time favorites.

3- Bart Sells His Soul - 9/10. ""Oh, it can swim!"" Another winner, a more touching episode, as Bart learns the hard way the importance of the soul. In the side story, Moe turns his bar into a family restaurant with comic results.

4- Home Sweet... - 8/10. A series of unlikely and misunderstood events causes the Simpsons parents to lose their children to the Flanders family. Bart and Lisa not fitting in with their new environment and Marge and Homer trying to get the kids back makes for good comedy.

5- Lisa the Vegetarian - 8/10. ""Why does it talk like a sheep?"" Lisa visits a petting zoo and realizes she can't eat meat. She is treated to an old-time propaganda film on how meat is great, and her newfound convictions clash with Homer's upcoming barbeque.

6- Treehouse of Horror VI - 7/10. The first segment wasn't so good. The second one was easily the best, a parody of ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" done with Willie as the Freddy Krueger character. The last segment, and the most famous, was an empty use of (then new, now dated) technology that really has nothing going for it but nostalgia.

7- King-Sized Homer - 10/10. My favorite episode of the season. Homer gets fat(ter) so he can collect disability and work from home. ""Classic"" Simpsons is back for this episode.

8- Mother Simpson - 7/10. Homer meets his long-lost mother. While touching, it's not the funniest or most powerful episode and, while good, isn't great.

9- Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming - 7/10. The weakest Sideshow Bob episode up to this point in the series (oh, if only the future ones were this good though!), it's still funny enough, and gets a lot of laughs from Krusty's attempt to stay on the air.

10- The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular - 10/10. ""GET AWT OF MAH AWFICE!"" This is my 4th favorite episode of the season, and while many younger Simpsons viewers may not understand the acclaim for this episode, those of us who grew up watching the Simpsons back when we had no hope of seeing behind-the-scenes footage or deleted scenes, greatly appreciate this episode. From Confederate Matt Groening, to Troy McClure's reaction to the Tracey Ullman Simpsons, to the robotic Richard Simmons, this episode is simply hilarious.

11- Marge Be Not Proud - 7/10. A touching episode made better by the appearance of the infamous Lawrence Tierney.

12- Team Homer - 5/10. Kind of blah. The whole ""Poppin' Fresh"" bit was hilarious though.

13- Two Bad Neighbors - 6/10. An okay episode, but I never bought into that Homer was the hero of the episode. It's got some pretty funny antics interspersed throughout it though.

14- Scenes From The Class Struggle In Springfield - 9/10. Really an underrated episode. Marge believably gets caught in the ""Keeping up with the Joneses"" atmosphere of privileged life, while we get to see Mr. Burns' impression of Richard Nixon, how Homer, Bart, and Lisa get along in a country club, and some pretty funny lines from the snobby harpies (the line about ""changing suits"" always gets a laugh from me).

15- Bart the Fink - 8/10. In a convoluted way, Bart ruins Krusty's life, and Krusty appears to commit suicide. But does he? The answer: of course not.

16- Lisa the Iconoclast - 6/10. Not one of my favorites. Homer as the Town Cryer was great, but the rest of the episode just fell flat for me.

17- Homer The Smithers - 10/10. My third favorite episode of the season. Mr. Burns sends a rattled Smithers away on vacation, and Smithers chooses Homer as his replacement, with hilarious results (the gag with the safe door is great).

18- A Fish Called Selma - 5/10. The ""Planet of the Apes"" musical is fantastic. Everything else, blah. Troy McClure was always best in small doses.

19- The Day The Violence Died - 4/10. Just didn't resonate with me much at all.

20- Bart On The Road - 5/10. This is a weak stretch. Again, it's difficult to say what's bad about this episode, but nothing in it really jumped out at me.

21- 22 Short Films About Springfield - 7/10. I like it, but it is one of the more overrated Simpsons episodes. A lot of it just feels like throwaway material (Apu at the party) and Pulp Fiction parodies weren't even particularly fresh back then. It's still a fine episode though, and the bit with Skinner and Chalmers is a highlight.

22- Curse of the Flying Hellfish - 8/10. It works surprisingly well on an action/suspense level, as well as the standard comedic one.

23- Much Apu About Nothing - 4/10. This episode has pretty much the right attitude on the issue in question, but what I can't stand is that, unlike past episodes dealing with current events/political issues, it really takes a cheap way of dealing with it. The anti-immigration group is set up as such a corny straw man, with everyone involved in it being as dumb as bricks, and everyone opposed being 100% absolutely right, it just comes off as lazy pontificating to me. The jokes also aren't particularly funny.

24- Homerpalooza - 4/10. This feels more like ""New Simpsons."" Homer has improbable, wacky adventures that make him famous, and the writers get to take some easy shots at 90s youth culture. It doesn't help that it doesn't hold up very well.

25- Summer of 4 ft. 2 - 10/10. A fantastic episode with a classic feel to it. Homer, Bart, Milhouse, and Marge playing the board game, Homer's troubles with fireworks, and especially Marge's reaction to Homer's purchases from the convenience store, all hilarious moments, plus it has some nice sweetness to it as well.

All in all, Season 7 and the DVD set may not match up in the best way to Seasons 3-6, but it's still plenty good. Recommended.",1146268800,6,7661,4.696268656716418
2437803,5,B000BQPC42,"I think each season of the Simpsons got better and then peeked with season 7. When you think of classic episodes most of them are here in this season. Some episodes include Who Shot Mr. Burns (part 2), the Radio Active Man movie,the episode where President Bush moves in across the street (Two Bad Neighbors), Bart Sells his Soul, and my personal favorite: King-Size Homer. Homer wearing a moo-moo for the entire episode was hilarious.

I won't go into episodic detail, needless to say that they are all what we have come to expect from this satirical, slapstick, supremely funny and sickening realistic family as well as the usual cameos from the Springfieldians who add to what will go down in history as a show that pioneered mainstream mature animated t.v.

2437814,5,B000BQPC42,"The Complete Seventh Season of The Simpsons ran from September 1995 through until May 1996 and is another classic collection of episodes in the much-loved 'Golden Era' of the show. This era, I would guess, is from around 1992 until 1998 where The Simpsons fast became the most important show on television. The sheer wit and social satire in this season is incredible, and is arguably the best season of them all. It's hard to believe, when looking back on all the classic episodes from the start up until Season Seven, that the show wasn't even half way near through it's entire run. Of course, the show is still very much in production, now in its 17th season, and will continue for a few more seasons yet I should imagine. The sheer volume of episodes is almost mind-boggling. A lot of hard work has gone into this genius creation of a cartoon and it will be remembered for a very long time to come. Just think how long it will be in syndication around the world! Surely more than 50 years...

The season opens with the concluding episode to the previous season's cliff hanger, ""Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two),"" which finally sees Maggie revealed at the one who committed the crime. These two episodes really are just superb, because when you listen to the audio commentaries, it's astounding how much thought has gone into the scripts. In ""Radioactive Man,"" a movie based on the comic book superhero Radioactive Man is filmed in Springfield. Bart and Milhouse both audition for the part of Fallout Boy, and when Milhouse gets the part, he soon begins to regret his new job. ""Home Sweet Home-Diddly-Dum-Doodily"" sees Marge and Homer take a day out of the grind to relax at a health spa, but when a series of misadventures mistake Child Services to think they neglect their children, Bart and Lisa are taken to a foster home - the Flanders's. When Ned learns that Bart and Lisa were never baptised, he decides to take matters into his own hands. In ""Bart Sells His Soul,"" Bart sells his soul for five dollars to Milhouse while cleaning the church organ. He soon comes to regret his decision and tracks down his soul in one of the most famous episodes of the show ever. ""Lisa The Vegetarian"" sees Lisa appalled by the thought of eating meat after going to a petting zoo. She becomes ridiculed by people, and takes things too far when she tries to impose her beliefs onto others. ""Treehouse Of Horror VI"" features three shorts. In the first, advertising logos attack the town, while in the second, Groundskeeper Willie terrorises Bart and Lisa in their dreams. In the third, Homer enters a terrifying 3-dimensional world.

In ""King-Size Homer,"" Homer discovers that he can work at home on disability claims if he is more than 300lbs, which leads him to furiously eat junk to pile on the pounds. He soon realises his life is falling apart, but he manages to seal a nuclear power plant explosion with his enormous butt. In ""Mother Simpson,"" Homer's mother returns after she abandoned him when he was a child. The family learns that she was a radical in the Sixties and responsible for destroying Mr. Burns' germ warfare lab. She must flee again, unfortunately, and Homer is upset at losing his mother for a second time. ""Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming"" sees Sideshow Bob return to threaten Springfield with a nuclear holocaust if the town doesn't agree to do as he says - cancel all television shows forever. After this plan is foiled by Lisa, he takes Bart hostage on the Wright Brothers' plane in an attempt to destroy Krusty. In ""The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular,"" Troy McLure hosts a show that looks back on the success of The Simpsons over the past seven years in this brilliant parody of the series itself. ""Marge Be Not Proud"" sees Bart arrested for stealing a video game. He is told not to return to the store, but when Marge wants to take the family out for a group photo, he cannot sat why he doesn't want to go. He gets caught again by the security guard, who informs Marge and Homer of Bart's thievery. Marge is extremely upset, resulting in Bart trying to win back her respect. In ""Team Homer,"" Homer organises a bowling team but is forced to include Mr. Burns in order to raise money for the entry fee. Meanwhile, Principal Skinner enforces school uniform after Bart wears a controversial t-shirt to school. In ""Two Bad Neighbors,"" former President George H.W. Bush buys a house over the road from The Simpsons. Bush takes a dislike to Bart and spanks him, causing Homer to declare war on his new neighbor.

In ""Scenes From The Class Struggle In Springfield,"" Marge buys a Chanel suit in a sale and is invited to join a country club when she runs into an old school friend. She discovers she really doesn't fit in with upper-class life, but is desperate to keep trying, until her family remind her of what's really important. In ""Bart The Fink,"" Bart's attempt to get Krusty's autograph leads to Krusty's indictment for tax evasion. Krusty fakes his death, but Bart tracks him down and inspires him to fight back to the top of the ratings. ""Lisa The Iconoclast"" sees Lisa discover that Springfield's founder, Jebediah, was really a terrible man. She prepares to reveal this shock to the town, but decides to keep it to herself to protect the town's image of its hero. In ""Homer The Smithers,"" an overworked Smithers takes a break from caring for Mr. Burns. He finds a replacement in Homer, but Burns soon realises that he can live his life without the help of anyone and fires Burns when he returns. ""The Day The Violence Died"" sees Bart meet Chester J. Lampwick, the actual original creator of Itchy And Scratchy. The studios that produce the cartoon are forced to shut down after Lampwick, with the help of Bart and Lisa, proves to the courts that he was the original creator. In ""A Fish Called Selma,"" Troy McLure marries Marge's sister Selma to further his return to the movie industry. However, once Selma discovers his true intentions, she decides she would rather not remain in a loveless union.

In ""Bart On The Road,"" Bart spends time with his aunts at the Department of Motor Vehicles, and secretly creates his own fake driver's license. He uses it to rent a car and drive to Knoxville, Tennessee with Marten, Nelson and Milhouse. In the end he must be rescued by Lisa and Homer. ""22 Short Films About Springfield"" shows a series of short, interconnected stories features various Springfielders about the goings-on of their every day life, spurred on by Bart and Milhouse's pondering while dropping ice cream off a bridge on cars below. In ""Raging Abe Simpson And His Grumbling Grandson In 'The Curse Of The Flying Hellfish',"" Grandpa reveals that he stands to inherit a small fortune as the last survivor of his old army unit - that is, assuming Mr. Burns dies before he does. Burns and Grampa tussle over the treasure, until the government arrive on the scene to return to its true owner. In ""Much Apu About Nothing,"" Springfield passes an ordinance outlawing illegal immigrants, which leads a worried Apu to desperately try and pass a citizenship test before he is deported. ""Homerpalooza"" sees Homer desperate to become cooler and more knowledgeable about the current music scene. He gets tickets to an awesome rock concert, and soon becomes the main attraction as it tours the country by catching cannonballs in his stomach. In ""Summer Of 4 Ft. 2,"" the family rent Flanders' summer cottage. Lisa aims to change her image in a desperate bid to become more popular. This plan works fine until Bart tries to sabotage her new-found happiness by revealing her geeky, school-loving nature to her new cool friends. However, not even that can detract from Lisa's true qualities.

Overall this season is incredibly strong, as are the previous three or four seasons. The standard of quality episodes is very impressive. I don't think there is even a single dud here, and this season contains many of the show's most famous and best loved episodes. The packaging of the DVD box set is the best yet in my opinion, taking on the theme of a cinema. The episode guide booklet is smaller than ever before and very compact, taking on the form of a Springfield newspaper. I especially like the first page, which shows a drawing of Matt Groening's 'final draft' of ""The Simpsons: An Introduction To The Seventh Season,"" and a post-it note below saying, ""Good Job - When Can We Get Season Eight??"" I expect that to follow in a few short months, and I for sure will be buying it, expecting nothing less than a stellar 5-star quality collection of episodes of this, the finest animated show in the history of television.",1139529600,2,8629,4.704365079365079
2437815,5,B000BQPC42,"I own all 7 Seasons of The Simpsons that are currently available, and I can safely say that this is the best Box Set yet. It has some of the best episodes and some of the best lines in the entire series. Such episodes include ""Radioactive Man"", ""The Simpsons' 138th Episode Spectacular"", and ""22 Short Films About Springfield"". Perhaps the greatest line in the entire series (which Matt Groening also agrees with) is Rainier Wolfcastle's exclamation of ""The goggles, they do nothing!"" in his Austrian accent in ""Radioactive Man"". To put it simply, any person who has ever enjoyed an episode of The Simpsons should pick this set up, as it will be enjoyed over and over again.

NOTE: You may want to consider purchasing Season Six before buying this if you want the entire ""Who Shot Mr. Burns?"" saga, as the 6th Season contains Part 1, and this set contains Part 2.",1139011200,3,863,4.640522875816994

2437817,4,B000BQPC42,"As the show evolves, a broader collection of episodes emerges. While the 7th season can't compare in charm to the 5th and 6th in terms of writing, it still maintains the classic Simpsons wit, and the features and setup of the dvds themselves are comparable to the best sets.

Definitely a(nother) must-have for the diehard Simpsons fan. :-)",1138233600,,340,4.862068965517241
2437818,5,B000BQPC42,"Starting off with the conclusion to the cliffhanger episode ""Who Shot Mr. Burns?"", the seventh season of The Simpsons continues to impress.  The answer to the summer of 1995's biggest question surprised everyone by being both implausible and hilarious.  From there, the episodes were consistently funny.  With inclusions such as ""Lisa the Vegetarian"", which was alluded to in the previous season when we saw Lisa's future, ""Radioactive Man"", with great a great parody of the 1960s Batman series starring Adam West, the ""Treehouse of Horror VI"" which had the state-of-the-art 3D segment, ""Bart on the Road"" with the Knoxville World's Fair, and finally, ""The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular"", hosted by Troy McClure (Phil Hartman) and featuring deleted scenes and alternate endings to the ""Who Shot Mr. Burns?"" mystery.

Season 7 occurred during the golden age of the show, when the writers' wit was at its sharpest.  I can't think of a bad episode in the whole season, and many memorable lines came from this year, including Chief Wiggum's response to Homer in WSMB: ""That's what they all say.  They all say 'D'oh!'"".  Also, it's amazing how much stuff is cut out for syndication.  Even if you've seen every episode on TV, it's worth it to buy this set to see what was cut.

So far, I've only listened to one commentary, the one on ""Who Shot Mr. Burns?"" (as you can see, I am a big fan of those two episodes).  While the commentary for part one was amazing, and this one was still good, it wasn't as good as I was hoping.  Still, it was fun to hear about how they had to declare a winner to the contest (you'll know what I'm talking about if you listen to the commentary in both episodes) even though no one got the answer right.

This is another great Simpsons set that every fan should own.",1136332800,5,1794,4.678343949044586
2437819,5,B000BQPC42,"Hello, this season was packed with great fun filled, ""Simpson"" episodes. The box format was very appealing and that gave it a definite plus. The 138th episode spectacular was very educational in simpsons terms, but horrible in terms of an epidsode. Me being a fan enjoyed it completley, but you must watch it with a ""Simpsons"" fan, or else it is just another episode nothing exiting. I enjoyed it, and cant wait to see what they do with the next season dvd collection.",1135900800,,468,4.650602409638554
2437820,5,B000BQPC42,"If you've looked through the reviews for Season Six, you'd find a lot of complaints about the box design. On the plus side, it was innovative, on the minus side...it wasn't very practical. They've gone ahead and remedied this by releasing the set in both styles.

Wanting to be able to stack my boxes, or at the very least, line them up on a shelf, I opted for the plain box. If you got the alternate box for Season Six, Season Seven's box follows suit in design, with a hole cut out for an eye to peek through (in this case, Marge).

A lot has improved. The case's style is better, and is less prone to loose DVDs like Seasons 1-5. The booklet now sports scenes from the actual episodes, as opposed to just a character shot or two. Very easy to just glance through the booklet, and know what episodes are there.

As far as the DVDs interface is concerned, it's nice. When you select an episode, and the menu comes up, a scene plays in the background. Nice touch. Special features aren't as plentiful as previous seasons, though that's not really terrible, just not as much as before. I really enjoyed the animatics from previous seasons, and I was a bit disappointed to not find one here. Commentary is great.

Episode-wise, this has some gems. King Sized Homer, where homer purposely gains 61 pounds to get on disability for obesity, the conclusion to Who Shot Mr. Burns, which has some great commentary on what happened with the contest. My favorite episode, 22 Short Films About Springfield, is also here, and the 138th episode spectacular, which is a great clip show (not many series can even boast a good clip show) It's got quite a few classics.

You really will enjoy this if you're a Simpsons fan. If you haven't been watching the series since season 1, and this may be your first time viewing season 7 material unedited, do pick this up. It's a great showing of the Simpsons at its prime",1135209600,12,1897,4.502906976744186
2437821,5,B000BQPC42,"I'm so glad they returned to the old packaging!  The homer head was a bad idea.  This is one of the best seasons, in my opinion.  (Season 8 is my favorite, but this is a close second.)  Syndication ruined some of the episodes for me.  I must have seen king-sized homer a hundred times because they decide to show some over and over, and never show some at all.  That is the beauty of having this show on DVD.  Choosing which episode you want to watch insteading of groaning ""this one again"" to the tv set.

Classic episodes in this one.  Lisa the vegitarian, homerpalooza, summer of 4 ft. 2, and 22 short films about springfield are some of my faves on here.  Picture looks great, nothing to complain about here.

Packaging is nice.  Instead of each disc on a fold on seasons 1-5, it has a flip book deal, which i find easier to use.

Extras is ok.  Not a whole lot.  It's got the commentary on each episode and a short making of the 3-D homer, but not much else.

Another great season.  Can't wait for 8!  The Simpson Files is my all time fave.  I bring you love.",1135123200,2,1064,4.203980099502488

2437824,5,B000BQPC42,"There are probably reviewers who celebrate every Simpsons season as their ""favorite.""  Season 7 is MY favorite!  Really, it is.  I do not claim that distinction on any other season.  Season 7 is jammed with many of my favorite Simpsons eps ever (Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part 2), Radioactive Man, Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily, Bart Sells His Soul, Mother Simpson, Lisa the Iconoclast, The Curse of the Flying Hellfish, Much Apu About Nothing, etc.).  In fact, the only episode in this season I do not care for is Bad Neighbors which, I think goes waaay over-the-top like many of the Simpsons eps in later seasons.  This season also has my favorite Treehouse of Horror ep. But, the main reason Season 7 is my favorite is that it includes my all-time #1 Simpsons episode:  KING-SIZE HOMER! If you have not seen this episode, buy this now!!!  The DVD set is available in the stores in both the box case (with a camera window instead of a television set), or the head-shaped Marge Simpson limited edition case (I'm not sure if Amazon offers both).  The box case has a picture of Marge's head on the inside.  I favor the box case, as it is easier to use, in my opinion.  It has the plastic flip holders for the DVDs which I didn't like on the Season Six set but they seem a lot sturdier in this set (it keeps moving around on my Season 6 set).  The booklet is very cute.  It is in the style of a newspaper with ads like ""Casting Call"" for Radioactive Man and Moe's Method Acting Academy.  Like all Simpsons sets, it is packed with extras (deleted scenes, commentaries, ""Homer in the Third Dimension"" featurette, etc.).

Disc 1:

Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two):  The classic ending to the two-parter.  With all that Simpsons DNA evidence, it's obvious who did it, right?

Radioactive Man: A Radioactive Man movie is being filmed in Springfield.  Bart lost out to Milhouse for the role of Fallout Boy but he'll make do with sucking up to him ""like religious people suck up to God.""  Micky Rooney appears who was Best Child actor spanning two decades (1939-40).

Bart Sells His Soul:  One of my favorites.  Bart doesn't believe there is such things as souls so he sells his to Milhouse.  He soon regrets this decision when strange things start happening to him.  Moe also opens a family restaurant.

Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily:  Definitely in my Top Ten all-time list.  The county deems Marge and Homer unfit parents and sends them to parenting school while the Simpson kids are sent to a foster home with ""the Flandersesssss!""  So many great scenes here: ""And throw your garbage in a garbage can people, I can't stress that enough,"" ""The only thing I'm high on is Love, love for my son and daughters.  Yes, a little LSD is all I need,"" Ned Flanders blowing the hallelujah horn.  One of the funniest ever!

Lisa the Vegetarian:  Lisa develops a self-righteous disdain for meat right before Homer's barbecue.  Paul and the late Linda McCartney appear.

Treehouse of Horror VI:  Very cool one where Groundskeeper Willie kills kids in their dreams, advertising signs wreak havoc, and Homer finds himself trapped in another dimension (3D).  My favorite Treehouse of Horror.

Disc 2:

King-Size Homer:  #1 on my personal Top Ten All-Time Simpsons Episode list!  The funniest of all!  If you haven't seen it (it's not shown in syndication much), it is worth the price of this DVD set alone!  The premise:  Homer wants to gain over 60 pounds to go on disability and live the good life.  This is one goal where Homer succeeds Big-Time!  Bart dreams of being lardo on workman's comp, ""just like dad."": ""I wash myself with a rag on a stick.""

Mother Simpson:  Homer always thought his mother died when he was a child, but she suddenly returns (Glenn Close) still on the lamb after destroying Mr. Burns' germ lab in the 1960s.

Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming: Sideshow Bob wants Springfield to give up TV or he will detonate a nuclear weapon.  He ends up taking Bart hostage in the Wright Brothers' plane and trying to kill Krusty.  The plane turns out not to be the best of weapons.

The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular:  Celebrating a common milestone (yeah, right).  Troy McClure hosts a show with clips never before seen.  I love the one where Homer's head is used as a bowling ball and it breaks open with a note ""I owe you one brain-Signed, God.""

Marge Be Not Proud:  I play this every Christmas.  Bart really wants a violent video game ""Bonestorm"" but his mom thinks it costs too much.  Bart tries to steal it but is caught by security.  When Marge finds out, she decides she should stop babying Bart and Bart thinks his mom has stopped loving him.  Has that sweet quality of earlier Simpsons episodes.

Team Homer:  Homer is a member of a bowling team, to be known as the ""Pin Pals,"" which has been unknowingly financed by Mr. Burns.  When Burns discovers the team, he decides to join and Homer is afraid to tell him he's not good enough.

Two Bad Neighbors:  The only episode here I do not like.  Former President George Bush becomes Homer's neighbor and they don't get along well.  Over-the-top.

Disc 3:

Scenes From the Class Struggle in Springfield:  Marge's discounted Chanel suit catches the eye of a local socialite and Marge sets out to impress the stuck-up snobs so her family can join an exclusive country club.

Bart the Fink:  Bart inadvertently exposes Krusty the Clown as a tax cheat.  Krusty fakes his death to avoid the IRS.  Bart and Lisa do not believe Krusty is dead and set out to track him down and convince him to return to his adoring fans.  Bob Newhart gives a very Newhartian short speech at Krusty's memorial.

Lisa the Iconoclast:  Another of my favorites!  Lisa finds out the beloved town founder Jebediah Springfield was a traitorous pirate.  She must decide whether to publish the truth or allowing the myth to continue.

Homer the Smithers:  Forced to go on vacation, Smithers appoints Homer as his replacement to care for Mr. Burns.  Burns pushes Homer over the edge and Homer hits him.  Firing his replacement assistant, Burns realizes he can do things for himself and doesn't need Smithers.  When Smithers returns, he and Homer try to devise a plan so Smithers can get his job back.

A Fish Called Selma:  Actor Troy McClure must improve his public image to get film roles so he marries Selma.

The Day the Violence Died: An old hobo (voiced by Kirk Douglas) claims to have invented Itchy.  He wins his case and, due to the settlement, the studio cannot afford to put out Itchy and Scratchy cartoons.  Can Bart and Lisa save the violence?  I love the ""Amendment to Be"" Schoolhouse Rock song.

Bart on the Road: Bart gets a fake ID and uses it to rent a car and take Milhouse, Nelson, and Martin to Knoxville to a World's Fair that was held 14 years earlier.

Disc 4:

22 Short Films About Springfield:  Segments on Apu; Principal Skinner and Superintendent Chalmers; Homer and Maggie; Bumblebee Man; Lisa and Marge; Milhouse, his dad, Police Chief Wiggum, and Snake in Herman's Military Antiques store; and Nelson getting his comeuppance.

Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in ""The Curse of the Flying Hellfish"":  During WWII, Grandpa Simpson entered into a contract with his platoon buddies whereby the last surviving member gets the Nazi treasure they recovered.  It is now down to Grandpa and Mr. Burns and Burns would like to speed up Mother Nature.  The attempts to kill Grandpa are hilarious.

2437825,5,B000BQPC42,"The simpsons are in the greatest t.v shows of all-time but the packaging they get isnt.if you want to buy this season as many will,i reccomend you buy this package because the box set is better.the marge and homer packagings are cool but they are just attach with tape and i heard the discs could get damaged.if you want to protect your c.d this box set is better than the head package and more safe.

the simpsons 7th season was aired between 1995-96.4 discs are included,bonus features,comentaries.the simpson s 7th season was a great season contains some of the best episodes like;summer of 41,homer the rocker,king-sized homer to name a few.we get to see `who shot mr.burns part2`i know some wants to get the set just for this episode.some poeple say its a bad season or you see a detoriation of the show,well i don't think so but i respect them anyway.i saw all of this season its better than what they say.

this seasonthere are many guest (famous)like paul and linda mcCartney,the smashing pumpkins,george bush,peter frampton.they always made something funny with the guests but never as funny as when homer fights george bush.a good season in terms of guests too.

there is an amazing list of episodes;who shot mr.burns part 2,radioactive man,bart sells his soul(bart sells his soul to milhouse conviced that souls doesnt exist),lisa the vegatarian(lisa become vegatarian and mets paul mccartney),king sized homer(he gets to fat to work at home),summer of 41(when lisa gets friends).many great episodes a funny season.

i love this season its great buy this if you are a fanb you will enjoy discovering or re-discovering.i saw about all the episodes and i can tell you this season rocks maybe not the best but certasinly good.it would make a great gift.and this box set makes it better.at least more safe.",1134777600,,1813,4.915032679738562
2437826,5,B000BQPC42,"This is another really awesome season of the Simpsons. I can't believe that they have released it so fast because it usually takes one year to release the next season but, this time it took a few months. I really like this season because they're really funny episodes and the graphics are becoming a little better. Hopefully The Simpsons can release the rest of the seasons fast so I'm not 40 before they finish them!

And why would you want to watch this on any other format besides DVD? Say what you want about the packaging, but why complain about the media?

Before you go maligning the corporation for putting copy protection on its DVDs, remember that it's the corporation that put the show on the air in the first place. For free (to the viewer, anyway). I don't like posting this kind of thing on a review thread, but crap like your rant just has to be answered.

I'm buying this DVD set as soon as I can, before they decide not to sell it to me.",1133222400,7,695,4.257575757575758

However, the ""digipak"" is close behind.  Paper is ridiculous medium for DVDs or CDs.  It is not durable whatsover.  I will not buy CDs that are not in a jewel box.  I put up with DVDs in paper, because I watch them at home. Why don't they put the Simpsons in the standard plastic snap case with multiple disc trays?  The DVDs are protected and the outside is durable and its, surprise...cheaper!!!  FOX does this other countries for the Simpsons.  I don't get it.",1132704000,8,600,4.372727272727273

Treehouse Of Horror VI, King Size Homer, The Simpson's 138th Show Spectacular, Team Homer, Bart Sells His Soul, and 22 Short Films About Springfield are just some of the 25 terrific episodes on this set. Extra features, including the commentary, have been funny and informative on recent sets and add new dimensions of appreciation to the humor in these shows. All Simpsons fans will want to own this set. By the way, Fox Video, some of us would like a FULL SET of the shorts from the Tracy Ullman show on one of these sets.",1131408000,42,787,4.588652482269503
2437835,5,B000BQPC42,"The seventh season of the Simpsons saw Matt Groening's prime time, brilliantly hilarious animated series not missing a single step.  As this season opens, we learn who shot Mr. Burns (and honestly, who didn't see it coming?), and everything from that point forward is nothing but memorable, whimsical, and often insane humor that only the Simpsons could bring.  Also in this season, Hollywood comes to Springfield to film a Radioactive Man movie, and Millhouse ends up getting cast as sidekick Fallout Boy (""Radioactive Man""), Homer and Marge get accused of being negligent parents and Bart, Lisa, and Maggie get sent to live with the Flanders' (""Home Sweet Home-Dum-Diddly Doodly""), Bart sells his soul for five dollars (""Bart Sells His Soul""), Lisa becomes a vegetarian after attending a petting zoo (""Lisa the Vegetarian"", which also features Paul and the late Linda McCartney as themselves), Homer becomes morbidly obese so he doesn't have to go to work (""King-Size Homer""), Homer is re-united with his long lost mother (voiced by Glenn Close in ""Mother Simpson""), Sideshow Bob returns with a vendetta against television (""Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming""), former President George Bush moves next door (the hilarious and unpredictable ""Two Bad Neighbors""), Bart meets the real creator of Itchy & Scratchy (voiced by Kirk Douglas in ""The Day the Violence Died""), Pulp Fiction gets hilariously spoofed (""22 Short Films About Springfield""), and Homer becomes a sideshow freak after going to Lolapalooza (""Homerpalooza"", which also features the Smashing Pumpkins, Cypress Hill, and Peter Frampton).  The ""Treehouse of Horror"" special this season was also a memorable smash, climaxing with Homer's unforgettable journey into the 3-D world.  ""The Simpsons 138th Show Spectacular"" is a real gem, hosted by Troy McClure (voiced by the late, great Phil Hartman) as we the viewer are treated to rarely seen early takes of the characters, alternate endings, and deleted scenes that never saw the light of day, as well as some hidden messages and trivia as well.  All in all, just like all the early seasons of the Simpsons, you can't go wrong with the seventh season, and it's pure animated lunacy at it's very best.  Let's just hope that the packaging is much better than the incredibly poorly designed Homer head shaped package that contained season six.",1131321600,2,2347,5.212201591511937
