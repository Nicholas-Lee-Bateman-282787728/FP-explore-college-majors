7938341,5,B00005ICGD,"The Kranked series are the best of the breed. There is a bit of humor in them but the riding, music, and scenery is unsurpassed. I've watched them all at least 5 times each and they never get boring. Kranked 3 & 4 (Search for the Holy Trail) are must haves.",1177718400,,257,4.0588235294117645
7938342,4,B00005ICGD,"This is a good collection of different mountain biking clips from 2000.  For the time, a lot of it was probably pretty ground-breaking (excuse the pun).

Styles include: single track (fast and steep!), free riding/downhill, dirt jumping, stunts, big air (lots of 15-20' and up), and some fairly insane ""jig"" (e.g. urban) riding (This guy Ryan Leech is amazing).

North American locations include SoCal, Tahoe, North Shore, and Durango.  Then there is some really wild and untamed riding in South America and Turkey, probably my favorite segments due to the hairiness of the trails and how the guys ride completely balls-out.  The trick riding/jumping in a Turkish village almost has to be seen to be believed.

My only beef is that this DVD is too short!  I think it only has about 40 minutes of footage.  Could have used at least 20-30 minutes more, but what is there is of high quality.  For the price ($9), it is probably worth it, but it definitely leaves you wanting more when the credits roll.",1126483200,,999,4.761627906976744
