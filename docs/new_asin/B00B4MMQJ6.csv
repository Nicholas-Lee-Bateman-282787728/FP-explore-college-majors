5555618,1,B00B4MMQJ6,"Sounded like it could be a cute idea, three guys with different experiences new to Los Angeles. It is so bad that I gave up after 10 mins. Sorry if it gets better after that...Could have used CC to understand what they were saying: poor audio quality.",1372982400,3,251,4.361702127659575
5555619,3,B00B4MMQJ6,Less than I expected. This movie could have been a bit more engaging. Script was a bit choppy and dialogue less than convincing.,1372896000,7,128,4.608695652173913
5555620,3,B00B4MMQJ6,"I would say mostly for the dancers part.....story and dance..l..as for the rest....specially the 2 friends......could have been some-
thing else......",1372636800,,150,6.190476190476191
5555621,3,B00B4MMQJ6,"It wasn't a whole lot of interaction with characters, more like a one sided documentary.  If you like blah blah de blah, then its a movie for you.",1372118400,,146,4.214285714285714
5555622,5,B00B4MMQJ6,"this is a great movie,, defiantly worth watching this movie.. I would recommend this movie to all.. worth buying.. thanks",1368921600,,121,5.1
5555623,1,B00B4MMQJ6,how do people get money to make a film like this?? They must have a large family and lots of sympathetic friends.,1368662400,7,113,4.181818181818182
5555624,3,B00B4MMQJ6,"Ben, a dancer who recently reconciled the fact that he is gay, moves to West Hollywood to join two friends from college:  Jason, a young man (and budding alcoholic) with limited talent who wants to be a star, and Corey, an androgynous young loner who works as a personal assistant for an eccentric former TV actress (played by Sally Kirkland).  Finding work as a pilates and yoga instructor, Ben tries meeting guys through online ads, sex parties, and tries to get closer to another dancer he met at one of his classes, but nothing seems to be going as planned.  Meanwhile, Jason sets his sights on a boyfriend who can help his career goals.

A somewhat bitter, but mostly realistic, look at the gay dating hell that can be WeHo, but an otherwise positive story in which the guys adapt to their circumstances and achieve happiness.  Acting is capable and mostly amusing, despite some trite dialogue.  The film's direction seems a bit disjointed in parts, including a rather lengthy dance sequence at its conclusion.  Overall, I give it three stars out of five.  Brief nudity, sexual situations, would likely be a PG-13.  DVD has no extras other than chapter stops and some trailers.",1367280000,16,1182,4.783251231527093
5555625,4,B00B4MMQJ6,"The Wishmakers is a comedy-drama about three gay men on their quest for love and success. It's not a great movie, but it is charming and has many attractive men in its cast. Drew Droege is only in three scenes, but he steals all of them and plays the funniest character with a voice that sounds like a muppet. There is brief nudity, but there should have been more. I guess the Eating Out series has spoiled me as it has set the bar so high for gay comedies. Lots of nudity, lots of laughs. The Wishmakers has neither of those things, but it is fairly entertaining just the same.",1365206400,27,579,4.2727272727272725
5555626,5,B00B4MMQJ6,"It covers a lot topics in manner that is funny but serious at the same time. Having said that, I have lived in Los Angeles in the Silverlake area. WeHo was the party boys and fluff crowd. However this film gets away from all of that",1364515200,4,232,4.065217391304348
5555627,4,B00B4MMQJ6,"A little over the top for an old tired queen who misses a lot of action in old age. Still, decent performances and some nice interesting characters.",1476662400,2,148,4.518518518518518

5555632,5,B00B4MMQJ6,"It's  a crazy / sweat / romantic film with a bit of seriousness thrown in for good measure. I didn't have much expectation so I dumped the prejudices and viewed the movie with a clear mind. And surprisingly, I liked it. Go figure!",1466035200,3,230,4.348837209302325

5555642,5,B00B4MMQJ6,"This film is a collage of many stories about many men in search for love in a permanent relationship in all places - West Hollywood, CA.  This film a small but very subsequently glimpse of gay life with all trials, tribulations, false starts, and down to earth crashes.  You may have to see this film more than once to get the full effect.  Love can be a full time effort for both persons.  Throw in a stable relationship, and you have over time an overt misunderstanding, which requires compromise on both side, in order for it to succeed.  NJMJr!",1438560000,,548,4.494949494949495
5555643,1,B00B4MMQJ6,Bad acting Need nude and romantic,1425168000,,33,4.666666666666667
5555644,5,B00B4MMQJ6,It was like a cartoon. Haphazard. Unpolished. Raucous. The only way to enjoy this is as a parody of the gay movie comedy bad films. Expect head hopping and ridiculousness and you'll smile.,1411862400,,188,4.7272727272727275
5555645,3,B00B4MMQJ6,Just didn't do it for me.,1406419200,,25,3.3333333333333335

5555657,3,B00B4MMQJ6,"3 Friends are in L.A  trying to make a life for themselves.  They all wish upon a well for not necessarily success, but success in love.  Movie kinda slow and it has a lot of typical ""gay"" problems.  I find this movie more cliche' of finding success, love, and balance between partying and real life.  Though I find this movie to have  kinda run out dialogue, I find the movie ok.",1390867200,2,380,4.28169014084507
5555658,1,B00B4MMQJ6,It was awesome thanks so much I enjoyed it very much it was exactly what I was expecting it to be.,1389225600,,98,3.7142857142857144
5555659,5,B00B4MMQJ6,This was worth the purchase. I can't begin to express how good this movie was. I can't wait to purchase more in the future.,1388793600,2,123,4.166666666666667
5555660,2,B00B4MMQJ6,"The movie flits around too much and goes into way too much detail on certain aspects and glosses over the more important themes that would have been interesting had they even properly executed.  The acting, especially on the emotional scenes was, for the most part, unconvincing.  It goes to the bottom of my pile of movies!",1388620800,,324,4.767857142857143
5555661,3,B00B4MMQJ6,"The Movie was good - I had an issue with the DVD itself  I thought I was buying the DVD and it would install on my iTunes account.
I payed 14.99 for a DVD i do not have - Will not make that mistake again
Very disapointed",1384819200,,220,3.6808510638297873
5555662,1,B00B4MMQJ6,"Its Bad/Terrible In All. Don't Waste Your Time And Money, Needs To Be A Free Showing, Very Bad Actors. A Very Low Budget Film.",1384300800,2,126,4.291666666666667

5555664,3,B00B4MMQJ6,"This movie had some good qualities good color,sound ok but seemed to peter out towards the end as not everyone got a wish.",1378771200,2,122,4.3478260869565215
5555665,1,B00B4MMQJ6,The plot was very jumpy and took a while to understand.  There were no scene transitions. Acting was ok at best about what you would expect for a low budget film of this type.,1377388800,,175,4.147058823529412

5555677,4,B00B4MMQJ6,"I watched this indie comedy at the suggestion of a gay friend and enjoyed it knowing it was an indie film and was in an underserviced niche.
Each of the actors had some great moments on screen.
We made a little mixed-crowd party on a Thursday night with good food, good drinks, good friends and a good movie!",1377216000,7,308,4.327586206896552
5555678,3,B00B4MMQJ6,"I got a little lost in this film with the to-ing and fro-ing that went on scene by scene. It seemed to me that there was a lack of a coherent storyline or something missing. The film was easy watching and certainly not threatening, just that I wonder what it was the actors were trying to tell? It was OK.",1377216000,,305,4.1
5555679,5,B00B4MMQJ6,"Loved the characters in the story.  It was a thoughtful, sweet yet realistic story about the difficulties in being gay.  Much food for thought.",1374105600,,143,4.916666666666667
5555680,5,B00B4MMQJ6,"This is a little gem that not a lot of people are talking about.
It is hilarious and totally worth watching!",1374019200,,108,4.190476190476191
5555681,3,B00B4MMQJ6,"With so many talented and creative LGBTQ folks in the business, why is gay cinema so second rate. The Wishmakers plods onward with determination in the face of a weak story line, stilted script, flat acting, and choppy direction. Yeah I watched it all the way through, but it really is not very satisfying. Not terrible, but really not particularly good either.",1373846400,,361,4.838709677419355
5555682,2,B00B4MMQJ6,But there are so many other gay themed movies out there that are better for you. This one is just a little to below par.,1373760000,,120,3.84
5555683,2,B00B4MMQJ6,This movie is full of strangeness and yet it tells some truth. I really wouldn't stick with it though. It's not worth your time. I will say the pothead guru was both funny and informative,1373414400,2,187,4.371428571428571
5555684,1,B00B4MMQJ6,It started slow and could not get into the characters. The acting from main characters was forced . I gave up 17 minutes into the film when it continued to fall flat.,1373414400,2,166,4.21875
5555685,1,B00B4MMQJ6,"Yikes, movie is terrible. For some reason with all of the expertise in hollywood gay cinema still is 10 years behind the times. bad flick, terribly produced, and even worse acting.

5555686,1,B00B4MMQJ6,Characters not developed so appear shallow.  This genre has a lot of potential that no one has delved into as far as movies go.,1373155200,2,127,4.291666666666667
8562409,1,B00B4MMQJ6,WOW. The film comes in as #1 as the shortest time watching before I couldn't take any more. All the characters were annoying and so offensive from the start that I wished this was a short film and they were abducted by aliens two minutes into the film.,1529539200,,252,4.270833333333333

8562412,2,B00B4MMQJ6,"Poorly developed plot with no chemistry in the romantic relationships. The film has some nice introspective moments between Corey and Mary, but the rest of the film is lifeless.
