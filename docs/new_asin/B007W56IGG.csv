8522404,4,B007W56IGG,I got episode 3 to check it out before buying more. I could not find 1 or 2. Acting is poor but very good special effects and very good educational value. The extras do a great job reviewing the science. I have only seen one and will buy the others but this seems to be based on the Young-Earth Creationists view. I wish the writers had read More Than A Theory by Dr. Hugh Ross. It does provide an educational opportunity for me with the kids.,1410652800,,443,4.162790697674419
