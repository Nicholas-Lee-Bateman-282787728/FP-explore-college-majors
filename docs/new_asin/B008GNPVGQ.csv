8527669,4,B008GNPVGQ,"I have books, and this DVDs (more than 10 items) about Moe Norman's swing. This DVD is one of the item help to improve my swing, after one year of trial. I completely change my swing to this one. My best club is wood. It is dead straight. I have no one to help me, but DVDs and books about Moe Norman.  My iron is still not quite good but is improving. I hope that there will be DVD about iron shot from Moe Norman, instead of Wood and Driver. Then my game will be perfect. Before change into Moe Norman swing, I shot around 100. And now is around low 90s. My best one is 87, 6 birdie chances contributed from my 3 and 5 woods.",1370563200,3,627,3.937007874015748
