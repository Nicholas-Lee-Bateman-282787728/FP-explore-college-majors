5051826,5,B0072M7TMQ,"Esther's program is a must whether or not you have back pain.  Besides helping with pain, Esther's DVD can be used to improve your posture and as a preventative measure for those with no pain.  I was always very active, exercising in some vigorous way 5 days a week.  The aches and pains kept coming and finally, an MRI showed a herniated disc in my low back and other degeneration.  I found my way to Esther's program which taught me the techniques to take pressure off the spine while explaining it clearly.  I took the time to learn the techniques and I found relief.  With the stretch lying, I wake without any stiffness or pain.  The DVD provides a great visual and it is the best way to get ""hands on"" training without actually attending the classes.  It is easy to play over for reference.  I also recommend reading her book which provides more detail, the research behind her techniques and exercises.  I had the good fortune of taking the course but if that is not possible for you, then the DVD and book are the way to go.  For those with no pain (for now), I highly recommend the DVD for prevention.  Develop the awareness and technique before you have pain - I wish someone gave me that advice!  Along the way, you will develop elegant posture and an enviable gait!",1330560000,49,1277,4.452586206896552
5051827,5,B0072M7TMQ,"I was introduced to Esther Gokhale's method through its broadcast on PBS (KQED).  This DVD is essentially what they broadcast with additional bonus features.  Esther's method has worked wonderfully for me.  Her explanations about the anatomical and cultural root causes of many of our pains (such as back, knee, etc.) are easy to understand and they makes a lot of sense. Her method for regaining proper posture and thereby stretching our spine, strengthening the muscles and distributing weight properly are presented very clearly and are easy to follow.  They become a natural part of your daily life (how to sit, lie down, walk, etc.)

Esther has a very friendly demeanor, explains things very well, and her demonstrations clarify things.  The testimonials of people are also very helpful.

I strongly recommend using this DVD, and also her book ""8 Steps to a Pain-Free Back"" (also on Amazon).  They complement each other very well.",1330473600,24,935,5.105263157894737
5051828,5,B0072M7TMQ,"I have referred many people to Esther Gokhale who were suffering from joint and muscle pain, especially those with back and neck injuries.  This DVD is a wonderful tool for people who have back problems, want to take positive steps to feel better, and who want to regain control of their own lives.  I am a graduate of Esther's program and nothing has brought me greater relief from my own back problems than the principles that she teaches.  It's now three and a half years later and I am still enjoying being pain free and being able to exercise, hike, travel, and play with my grandchildren.  I was facing a third surgery involving major fusion and was desperate to find an answer.  Esther provided the answer and I literally got my life back.  The video does an excellent job of presenting the methods that anyone can easily use on a daily basis to condition, strengthen, and restore their bodies so that they can live pain free.  I highly recommend the video.",1330473600,29,964,4.60233918128655

The rest of the DVD also makes perfect sense.  As soon as you try the techniques, you instantly know how ignorant you have been of your body and how it works.  I even used the hip hinging this morning with my golf stance...Thank you Esther.",1330128000,25,398,4.266666666666667

I already read her excellent book yet found the DVD provided me with the visual hands-on approach I needed.  I could hear Esther explain her method and see her demonstrate in detail all the techniques described in her book.  Furthermore, the DVD has a user friendly format making it easy to review any section.  I even played the DVD in slow motion to better understand the nuance of this method.  What is most wonderful is that whatever daily activity I do whether sitting, standing, walking, bending or lying down I am strengthening my mucles and improving my health.  My investment in her products is a bargain compared to the benefits I received.",1329091200,39,795,4.661870503597123
5051831,5,B0072M7TMQ,"This video brings to life Esther Gokhale's amazing and revolutionary book, 8 Steps to A Pain-Free Back. For those who haven't read Esther's book, it's a great introduction to the primal posture solution for back pain. For those who have read and loved Esther's book but aren't sure if they're doing the movements correctly, this book makes stretch and stack sitting, tall standing, glide walking and hip hinging really clear.  It's also great to see real people with histories of several different painful injuries and conditions doing the exercises, and hear, in their own words, how the techniques have allowed them to live pain-free, active lives. If you are unfamiliar with Esther Gokhale's work, Esther has developed a group of simple but very power techniques to help people restore the natural posture we are born with, the same posture our ancestors and many indigenous cultures use. Primal posture makes great anatomical sense for our bones, muscles and joints. The people who use it have a very, very low incidence of back and musculo-skeletal pain(5-7%), while in our industrialized cultures the incidence of back pain is much, much higher(85-90%).",1328918400,19,1159,5.164893617021277

5051851,5,B0072M7TMQ,"I am an unabashed fan of the Gokhale Method in all its forms. I've read the book, used the DVD, taken the Foundations Class in person, and participated in the many online offerings that Esther Gokhale and her team provide. Until my late 30's, I was in back pain on a regular basis, despite a very athletic childhood and regular exercise as an adult. What I've learned through the Gokhale Method has enabled me to sit, stand, walk, run, and play with much more freedom and joy, and without injury and pain. It's incredibly simple and straightforward and, like many skills I've learned, it takes a lifetime to explore all of the subtleties. The biggest challenge, even after having a good introduction to the Gokhale Method, is to remember to practice it, to overcome a lifetime of bad habits that are still deeply ingrained in how the musculo-skeletal structure is aligned.

What I love about the DVD is that I can pop it in to my computer any time, and get a short or long dose of some aspect of the Gokhale Method. As I mentioned above, what is needed for long-term health is continual reminders of what good posture is. The DVD is great for providing these reminders. The DVD is divided up into different aspects of the teachings (like the chapters of the book), and so it's easy to get a refresher (or if you're new, a great introduction) to an aspect of the posture teachings. The production is professional, and it's wonderful to see Esther working with the different students in the video. It's easy for me to translate her adjustments (on screen) to what I know will be helpful to my own body.

Do yourself and your back a favor, and check out the Gokhale Method.",1403395200,5,1670,4.5633333333333335
5051852,1,B0072M7TMQ,"This DVD does not provide enough information for the viewer to benefit from it. I did understand how Miss Gokhale wants her patients to bend down but, aside from that, little is taught to the viewer. More than teaching the viewers, it looks like Miss Gokhale has managed to provide as little information as possible so that some desperate viewers might decide to take her course. Just like when we are offered a food sample at a grocery store so that we head to the aisle and buy the actual thing.",1401062400,17,497,4.472527472527473
5051853,4,B0072M7TMQ,"Many people have chronic back problems.  It makes sense for any person at all to investigate correct body mechanics, whether to prevent future problems or to correct existing problems.  In our society, correct teaching about lower back problems is very important.  The benefit of this work is that anyone could do it.  I tried some ""Foundation"" exercises and found that I didn't have the flexibility to take the exercise positions correctly.  If you can't do it, it isn't any good---for you.  These motions are ones anyone can actually do.  It appears that Ms. Gokhale has put a lot of research and thought into this system and that it should be correct and useful.  It should help, and anyone should be able to do it.  Some of the positions that she desires seem to me a little subtle, and the way she obtains the positions for several of her clients seems to be unclear in her presentation.  Yes, get the feeling that you're reaching over a chest-high bar.  That will tilt your rib cage a little.  However, the position is slightly subtle and the presentation is one that leaves me wondering whether or not I have really got it right.  I consider the presentation unnecessarily muddied when it need not be.  There are more efficient and precise ways to explain this.  Why not present those?",1395792000,9,1292,4.705357142857143
5051854,5,B0072M7TMQ,"I had suffered a back injury in 1980, which left me unable to run (which was my primary form of exercise).  I have suffered for soooooo many years with back and neck pain, always having to go to the chiropractor!!  I even wen to a PT, who only made matters worse.

I bought Esther's book about 6 months ago, because of all the rave reviews here.  I watched some of her Youtube videos and her approach made great sense!!  The book was very helpful, but I wanted / needed to SEE how it was done, so I ordered the DVD right away.  So glad that I did!!  Nothing can take the place of actually seeing how she teaches the correct postures and movements!!!

It took some time to make it a natural part of my posture and movements...I still have to be conscious of catching myself not doing it properly.  But, I see HUGE improvements in my posture, my walk, and my bending!  There is a transformation taking place!  I look younger, feel better, and as one friend commented, ""curvier.""  : )  Best of all, no more constant pain!!  As I continued to hold my body in this manner, I have had less and less pain, to the point that pain is only a faint memory!  My neck has fared so much better, too!  A good foundation makes for better alignment all around!!

So, since about 3 months after implementing her instructions, I was able to do things that I have NOT been able to do for many many years!!  I could vacuum!!  I found that to be thrilling, since I have not been able to do that for sooooooooo long!!!  I love vacuuming now, because I marvel that I can do it without back pain!!  I can bend down to the floor and pick up my 10 lb. cat!!  I can rake the yard!!!  LOVED doing it, because I could do it without any pain!!  Unheard of in the past!!!  Best of all, I am able to run around and play badminton without any problems!!!  Hooray!!!  Freedom at last!!!

So, I can say that Esther's method has been nothing short of a miracle, which has been an answer to prayer!!  Instead of degenerating as I age, I have my life back!!  And, I am getting better by the day!!  So, I have so much more hope for the future, as now I am much more independent and can only expect to get stronger!

Thank you, Esther, for sharing your knowledge and making this DVD!!!  The only thing that I would love to see in addition, is to see a segment of watching you glide-walk at a normal pace.

I give this DVD 10 stars!!!",1395792000,10,2392,4.184615384615385
5051855,3,B0072M7TMQ,"If this dvd was reasonably priced, it would be helpful. But it is way overpriced for what it contains.  The book is excellent and has much more information in it.  The exercises are simple ones and the book does a great job explaining them with great photos.  This would be helpful somewhat to see them in action, but in truth to do them correctly, one has to be sensitive to what one's body is doing.  so the dvd has limited help that way.  If seriously injured, her methods are very safe, but one would benefit from one on one sessions with her or attend her class, esp.  if you do not have sensitivity to your body.  The dvd covers the different exercises and testimonials, which I felt made it feel more like tv show. took away from it rather than helped it. I would have preferred to have the testimonials at the end of the dvd where one could choose to listen to them or not. Myself appreciate the intellectual info, knowledge that she shares, but find the exercises not that helpful. I have found yoga, somatic type exercises more beneficial. and again am somewhat shocked at the price of this dvd.",1395532800,54,1105,4.4405940594059405

Of course there is no substitute for receiving  the hands-on guidance from the Gokhale Method teacher, but if you don't have a teacher in your area, get the DVD, it will start you off very well! Even after the class, I kept referring to the video again and again.  Brilliantly done, thank you Esther!",1500940800,2,774,4.475177304964539
8508975,5,B0072M7TMQ,"I discovered the Gokhale Method on You Tube.  After watching her YouTube video several times, I started to practice what I learned and began to get some relief.  I decided to become a devotee to this teaching and immersed myself into this basic technique due to simple logic. I bought the book, DVD, cushion, chair, and head cushion.  (Some of these items were purchased from the Gohkale Method website).  I have participated in her classes which have been most helpful.  My problem is once I started to feel better I  became complacent and did not keep up with the fundamentals.  Once the pain returned I returned to the practice with greater focus.
  I have watched the DVD many times on the airplane and the elliptical.",1499817600,2,722,4.712
8508976,5,B0072M7TMQ,"In my opinion, this DVD is best used along with Esther Gokhale's book (8 Steps to a Pain-Free Back).  The book provides the logical basis for the method and step-by-step photos of the various techniques. Then the DVD brings it to life with the abbreviated class format and demonstrations by Esther.  It's even better if you can take their course (I did) to get the kinesthetic feedback with the guidance of the teacher, and then the DVD serves as a great refresher.  When you consider that you are learning skills you can use for the rest of your life which will likely prevent you from spending lots of money over the years in doctor bills, pain meds, massages, acupuncture or chiropractic treatments, it's a bargain!",1499731200,,718,4.728

It shows how to use it on a different kinds of chairs, in the car . . . and the exercises you can do while sitting in the chair are well modeled in the video. She first shows them done by student and then does them herself. I liked watching her do them best. She was an athlete who incurred back pain and studied indigenous people who lift and carry heavy things and never hurt their backs. It's quite amazing and EFFECTIVE.",1491004800,,503,4.195876288659794
