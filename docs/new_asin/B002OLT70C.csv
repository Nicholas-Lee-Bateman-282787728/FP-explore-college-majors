8376129,5,B002OLT70C,"I love watching ancient history of all kinds, this was more than very good watching and also you learn a lot about the past. I think it was worth what I learn of history of ancient torture and glad  I wasn't living in those days. It's always good to know the past and not do was the past over again.",1352505600,,299,3.9833333333333334
8376130,4,B002OLT70C,"The goal of this video is to prove or disprove ancient and medieval accounts of how peeople died during torture.  Experts are recruited to conduct experiments mimicking torture the way ancient documents describe it, then to record the precise cause of death and how long it took for the person to die.

Although this short (45 Minutes of narrative) video is very informative, with 3D and reenactments on pig cadavers used to show how the body reacts to impaling, stretching and whipping, there are many other devices that aren't even mentioned.  For example, ""the wheel,"" which is depicted on the video's jacket cover, is not even mentioned. Getting ripped apart by hungry tigers,  or torn apart by horse tied to opposite ends of a human body, getting stoned (to death) and various body disgorgers are also not mentioned.  Several classicial historians, including Bettany Hughes (""When the Moors Ruled Spain"") and Mark Donnelly add their commentary.

The first device featured is the ""rack"" on which humans were tied and stretched until their ligaments or bones tore apart. A pig's knee is used to dramatize what can happen not so much to the joints but to the bones.

Other devices experimented on are the ""tunica molesta"" (burning tunic on the body) that created a human fireball for all in Ancient Rome (especially under Nero) to watch in the Colesseum.  This, too is also reenacted using an experienced stuntman.  Another experiment was the ""scorpion"", whips which have metal hooks on the end were used for flogging victims just before crucifixion.  Another common device was ""the pear"" which was inserted into the mouth of a victim until the teeth and jaw were broken.

Burning at the stake and finally impalement were also shown.  Dracula the Impaler gets his reckoning here.  The two hosts prove that the human body could be impaled for up to two days before death sets in.  Once again 3D images use the outline of a human body for animation.

Although the devices are brutal, none of the reenactments are graphic.  However it doesn't take much to realize that all these devices from Ancient and Medieval times were inhumane.

This is a very informative video but alas it seems incomplete.  What also isn't covered is church-sanctioned torture, regional preferences of torture and gender-specific torture.  Watching this video only leaves me asking more questions.",1285286400,3,2371,5.002551020408164
8376131,5,B002OLT70C,"Very accurate and revealing - the use of ""real"" flesh (pork legs) to reproduce the effects on human legs is astonishing. DVD is very short, though - not many instruments are put to test. Historically and anatomically correct.",1284940800,,225,4.947368421052632
