8386973,1,B0031ESUHC,I wish I could say I love the item but i can not.  It is terrible.  Perhaps it gets better but for some reason this item does not work well on my kindle.  I have had not other problems with any videos.  This one keeps pausing you have to resume.. for me it was a complete waste of money and I never like putting such a message out on any healers work.  I tried to give it a fair chance because we are all working together for the highest good of all.  So perhaps there is an issue that needs to be fixed and it will be fine.  Blessings and I truly am sorry I could not give this good results.,1351382400,,592,3.84297520661157

8386975,1,B0031ESUHC,I thought this was a cd not a dvd. It was a 60's type dvd. I should have known better. Read the reviews. I just bought it because I thought it was healing music. I wanted for my car. I hope this was helpful.,1268784000,4,207,3.727272727272727
