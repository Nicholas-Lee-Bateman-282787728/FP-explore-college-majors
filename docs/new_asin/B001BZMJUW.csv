8285371,4,B001BZMJUW,"Malaipet is a great fighter. He delivers many great informations about the clinch. The dvd structure and production quality could be better. I recommend it because the content is good. Also a very interesting dvd about the clinch is ""Muay Thai DVD - Counter against Elbow, Knee and Clinch Techniques"".",1389830400,,301,5.04
8285372,5,B001BZMJUW,"This is an excellent DVD for martial arts, competition, and self defense training!

The content is straightforward and to the point.  There are many techniques shown for a close quarters empty hand confrontation.  The techniques shown are brutally effective.  Nothing flashy, nothing fancy, just solid techniques.  The explanations for the techniques are given by voiceover in clear English and contain a lot of detail on the subtleties to watch for in the visual demonstrations.

Malaipet is obviously a skilled martial artist.  He moves with great fluidity.  He demonstrates the techniques (gently) on a number of partners.  As he and his partner move through a demonstration of a technique, they show the reaction drill training that can be used to learn and train the technique.  What they are doing is exactly what you would want to be doing on a routine basis to train the technique shown.

The clinch situation is very relevant for self defense.  It's representative of a close quarters, grabbing kind of situation that is very common in a real confrontation.  These techniques are great for someone to use against a larger, stronger opponent that you don't want to be in a punchfest with.  The approach shown allows you to tie up your opponent's offense and bring your most powerful weapons to bear, your knees and elbows, powered by your biggest muscles in your hips and core.

The techniques shown rely on gross motor skills, which under the real world stressful conditions of an actual attack are the only motor skills you are likely to have available to you.  There are no difficult or tricky joint locking techniques involved that would involve any fine motor skills.

There are some very interesting, straightforward, and effective throws shown out of the clinch position as well.  I have a fair amount of martial arts training and have watched many technical DVDs on self defense techniques, and I've never seen some of these throwing techniques. They are very different than standard judo or wrestling throws because they tend to make use of the knees in the throw.  But they make perfect sense and I see no reason why they wouldn't work under very real world conditions.

Even if you have no other martial arts background and just routinely trained the techniques shown on this DVD, I would pity anyone who tried to take you on in a dark alley.

Highly recommended!",1276819200,5,2382,4.919799498746867
