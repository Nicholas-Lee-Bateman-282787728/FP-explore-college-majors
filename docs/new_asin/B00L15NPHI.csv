8663003,3,B00L15NPHI,"Maxine Peake is extremely good here as Charlotte a woman with a high flying job who lives in London's Docklands and has all the trappings of success. Then she gets unceremoniously fired and comes home early to find her Eastern European cleaner having a cheeky smoke in her luxury flat.

Well things kick off and the end results are quite literally life changing. Then her feisty sister Sarah (Christine Bottomley) gets called in and all of a sudden things start to change when Sarah introduces Charlotte to an apparently happy go lucky new man. This is Roger (Blake Harrison `The Inbetweeners') and he wastes no time inveigling his way into their lives.

Now this is a reasonably ok film - especially for an independent effort - however, the plot is a bit of a stretch to actually accept but to say why would be a plot spoiler. There are too many examples of this throughout and the ending will leave some feeling short changed. If you want a good TV drama and be able to switch off and relax then this may work. It was though billed as a thriller and on that count it is a bit lacking. It currently rates as 5.2 out of 10 on IMDB and I tend to agree hence the three stars.",1427500800,2,1173,4.376146788990826
