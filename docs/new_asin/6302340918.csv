7824637,5,6302340918,"This is a truly rare and probably hard to find anywhere else. This documentary features many people that knew Monroe well, namely Robert Slatzer. Slatzer was Marilyn's long time friend and occasional lover that knew Marilyn Monroe most of her adult life. The trysts with both Kennedy brothers, the theory of murder, Marilyn's association with well known ""underworld figures"" and a the revealing of a great ""cover-up"" pertaining to this beloved stars death is ALL revealed HERE! Made in the mid to late eighties, there is a number of people still living that knew Marilyn well in this documentary. This VHS cassette tape is very well made with black and white original footage of Monroe and also color. Very good sound and picture quality as well. Those who are looking for the original ""Marilyn Files"" look no further, this is it! A MUST see and a MUST have for all Marilyn Monroe fans, critics and scholars. One of the best films on this sweet, gentle and magical woman.",1229472000,,971,4.785714285714286
7824638,1,6302340918,"I have purchased this video from amazon.com twice in an attempt to get the real thing.  What they are selling is not Robert Slazer's ""The Marilyn Files"" but some sort of pirated A&E special with poorly intercut interviews with Robert Slatzer and a brief interview at the end (which cuts off half-way through) with Marilyn's foster sister Eleanor ""Bebe"" Goddard.
What is being sold here is a poorly pirated copy of some television special.  The label is hand-typed and the cover is a poor black and white Xerox of the orginal box.  The only thing good about it is the feature clips (most of them quite rare rare) of Marilyn, and Elton John's ""Candle in the Wind,"" which plays, in some form or another, throughout the feature.  It runs like a poorly pirated copy with tracking and sound problems.  The editing is abysmal.
I have seen the original ""Marilyn Files"" many times.  It gives amazing insight into the circumstances surrounding her death.  It is well-made, full of very good interviews, and is a credible account of Slatzer's long quest for the truth regarding his friend's death.
BUT...
THE VIDEO SOLD HERE IS NOT ""THE MARILYN FILES.""  If you really want it, look elsewhere.",1068768000,7,1181,4.783251231527093
7824639,5,6302340918,I ran a fan club for Marilyn about 10 years ago. Robert Slatzer was one of my 1st interviews I had with people who knew Marilyn. I find him most credible.  I don't doubt at all his marrige to her.  He was one of her best friends in life and continues to be her BEST friend after her life.  This video is a must have for anyone wanting answers about Marilyn's death.,982108800,5,365,4.041666666666667
