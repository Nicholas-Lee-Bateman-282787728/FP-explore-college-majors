8136499,3,B000H5U6DO,"When I see a kung fu movie, I have a few criteria that go into my rating it:

1. Plot
2. Fight scenes
3. Acting
4. Special effects
5. Editing

A lot of kung fu movies have terrible editing and it just interferes with either the storyline or the fight sequences.

As far as kung fu flicks go, Love and Sword is a pretty middle of the road movie for me. Some fights are good, others are okay but overall the lighting of the entire movie is just wayyyyyyyyy too dark. The plot was descent and actually had some twists to it, but it's far from stellar and shouldn't be close to breaking anyone's top 50 Kung Fu movies of all time.

My biggest complaint with the movie though was that the English dub was just unlistenable because it was about a full half second late in regards to what was happening on the screen and I was forced to see it with subtitles, which I didn't mind but sometimes you just wish a kung fu movie had a good dub over.

Regardless, if you're curious for a Kung Fu Flick there are certainly others you can enjoy, but Love and Sword is far from terrible and actually has some great characters and a pretty decent twist at the end.",1270857600,,1147,4.195454545454545
8136500,4,B000H5U6DO,"Love and Sword is quality Taiwanese production from 1979 directed by Li Chia very much in a similar vein to his other works such as Lost Swordship and Pai Yu Ching. As the title would suggest there is more of an emphasis on the romantic aspects of the story than in many such films although this doesn't really get in the way of the action. The plot is quite easy to follow for a Gu Long adaptation and is basically a vehicle for Tien Peng to wander around various scenic locations and get into sword fights - which can't be a bad thing. After watching love and sword I can't help feeling that there are many similarities between Li Chia and the great Chor Yuen in as much as they both try, with some success, to visually recreate the fantasy world that authors like Gu Long write about. Where Li Chia has the advantage though is that he has the beautiful scenery of Tawain as his backdrop rather than having to rely on indoor sets - and he uses these to maximum effect in love and sword. He also has the knack (not unlike Chor Yuen) for framing a shot in such a way as to create the kind of aesthetically pleasing compositions normally found in paintings or more `arty' films. Good stuff.

As I mentioned before Tien Peng manages to get into plenty of sword fights on his travels - whether he's defending himself from assassins or getting his revenge on the murderers there's enough action to please even the most demanding viewer and it's of a high quality throughout. The highlights for me were when he fought against the arrogant Chu Chen Yu (Tien Ho) with his `special move' that involved speedily circling around his opponent until he was overwhelmed by his sword lashing out at him from all angles. He used this move again at the end of the film after a particularly long and satisfying fight against his ultimate nemesis, I haven't described it to well but thanks to a bit of creative camera work it's something to behold! The rest of the action is easily on a par with any that you would see in Tien Peng's best films like Jade Fox or Pai Yu Ching and just as frequent.

With love and sword director Li Chia shows how to make a top quality wuxia adaptation, while the story is fairly average the film is made with enough visual flair to raise it above average. Add to this another good performance from Tien Peng, some great fighting and a decent soundtrack and you can't really go wrong. On the negative side the romantic angle was a little bit over done for my tastes (think of the string section welling up at the end of House of Flying Daggers, that sort of thing) but I suppose it was consistent with the theme of Gu Long's novel and in focusing on the relationship between Hsia Feng and his missus it gives the ending a bit more impact (You'll have to watch it to see what I mean!).

For swordplay fans and Tien Peng fans...highly recommended!",1173830400,7,2858,4.409090909090909
