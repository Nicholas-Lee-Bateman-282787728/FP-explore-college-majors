8609793,5,B0013EH1A4,"This tape was made at the 20th anniversary of the first Albuquerque Balloon Festival. A nine day event, covering two weekends, with over 652 balloons, 181,000 spectators, 9 cameras and 4 planes covering every aspect - 5 am dawn liftoffs, Sunday evening Balloon Glow, Crew games, cash and new car key grabs from the air - lots of fun.

If you love shaped balloons, there must have been nearly 40- shoes, witches, polar bears, cow over the moon, J&B scotch bottle, beer and soda cans, film cassettes, Mr Peanut, cats, trucks, catus, dinosaur, tractor, pumpkin, clown - and that's just a start - and what I can remember off the top of my head.

It ends all too soon with lots of balloons sailing above and along the Rio Grande with soft landings in the shallows. Highly recommended. The cameras got a lot closer than my wife and I have been able to get to balloons at other balloon events - those not held in Albuquerque, where people are allowed to get close and many events lift off in or near or over the crowds.",1202688000,,1012,4.464864864864865
