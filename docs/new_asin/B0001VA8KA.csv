2025370,5,B0001VA8KA,"I watched and loved this show when I was a kid (I know I am old!), and loved it when it came out on video tape back in the 80's.  When I saw it had been released on DVD I was elated because my video tapes had worn out.  I was also happy to see how cheap it was compared to buying the old VHS tapes.  I would highly recommend this series to both the serious WWII nut like me, or to someone who wants an easy to understand narrative of the war.  It is unique in that it gives the human perspective to events, and is not just a video with impersonal facts and film clippings.  It is a great companion piece to The World at War (which is also available on DVD).  I would highly recommend buying this DVD set.",1251331200,13,704,3.9225352112676055

2025372,1,B0001VA8KA,"I don't know what is worse. The death and chaos caused by this conflict or the boring, dull voice of Walter Cronkite. If you are looking for actual historical accuracy, you won't get it here. Cronkite instead voices his opinion based on his eye witness account of these events.
Half way through, I found myself rooting for the enemy to kill Cronkite
just to shut him up!!! Terrible collection. Don't waste your money.",1230422400,2,417,4.726027397260274
2025373,5,B0001VA8KA,"Believe it or not, I have all 17 VHS tapes on this series of videos. I bought them in 1983 at a cost of $55.00 each. They have been well cared for and I would like to see them. The quality is outstanding. Each tape contains four stories on that segment of the war. That means that I have over 1450 minutes of WWII history! The whole war is covered thoroughly and Walter Cronkite narrates each one.",1197244800,2,397,4.1688311688311686

2025395,5,B0001VA8KA,"This is the DVD version of the video cassette series of the mid 1980's titled The CBS Video Library of World War II.  I used this series in the history classes I was teaching at the time.  My personal favorite takes place on Disk 4 ""The Pacific Campaign"" highlighting the roll out of the Super-fortress....the B-29...... the plane that would end World War II, Disk 6- The Eastern Front / The German High Command, Disk 5 - Air War Over Europe / Allied Airmen POW's, Disk 8 - Home front and Victory.  What is really great about this extensive series is that we see the war from all angles.  Many aspects of the war took place apart from the Americans.  For example...the Siege of Leningrad by the Germans, the Scandinavian  and Soviet Fronts, and War within Wars in Europe.  Walter Cronkite's on target narration and stunning films of all aspects of the second world war will leave you mesmerized and teach all there is to know about the Greatest Generation.  A must have and a must see.",1416355200,,985,4.52542372881356

2025397,3,B0001VA8KA,"I was excited to get this for my dad for his birthday, as my grandfather passed down his VHS copies to me in college.  I couldn't really tell from the reviews or searches on the web if this was the same VHS series, but took a chance anyway.  I was severely disappointed when I received this.  While it contains all the original series, and some new segments, the order of the segments followed no logical order.  The first segment on disk one was about the Battle of the Bulge and the second segment about the Pacific Air Campaign.  It wasn't until Disk 6 that The Seeds of War arrived.  One of the great things I loved about the original was that I could follow along from the rise of Hitler to the end of the War and it followed a logical chronological order.  I returned this immediately and have ordered the European & Pacific Walter Cronkite discs after finding pictures of the back that shows the original order of segments.  I give this three stars as it still contains all the great footage (although I think the box said it was in color and I'm a B & W fan) but not sure why they would mix up the segments.",1400630400,,1115,4.276190476190476
2025398,5,B0001VA8KA,"Answer:  No one.  He invented the job of professional war correspondent.  I have seen hundreds of WWII videos but this one revealed aspects of WWII not elucidated in most others.  Told in a matter-of-fact tone, Mr. Cronkite is not just a narrator but a witness to what was reported.  More than anyone else, he was able to combine objective recitation of facts with an empathetic viewpoint, yielding a fine balance between the two.  For me, this was WWII on a broad but more personal level than most documentaries.",1398124800,,513,4.7727272727272725

8016614,5,B0001VA8KA,"""World War II with Walter Cronkite"" is a magnificent 8-DVD documentary set that chronicles the events of the most devastating war in world history. Hosted and narrated by iconic CBS news anchor Walter Cronkite, this is a comprehensive series of short films that combines original CBS News footage showing the great battles and campaigns of the war. Told primarily from an American point of view, the set details the great defeats and successes of American forces in both the European and Pacific theaters of operation.

It's important to note that ""World War II with Walter Cronkite"" does not provide a chronological account of the war in the same manner as does ""The World at War,"" the equally massive and brilliant British documentary of World War II. Instead, ""World War II with Walter Cronkite"" takes a thematic approach. For example, viewers will find a series of short films concerning the war in Italy, Japan, and France, among others. It took me a little while to get used to this rather different approach to documentary filmmaking, but it proved to me no less effective or fascinating.

""World War II with Walter Cronkite"" provides over 24 hours of viewing, and is a brilliant and fascinating look at the Second World War from the American perspective. Highly recommended.",1449446400,2,1282,4.985981308411215
