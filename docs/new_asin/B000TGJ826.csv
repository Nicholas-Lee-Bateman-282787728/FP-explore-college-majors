2897706,4,B000TGJ826,"Very good movie.  I like it when trail in a court of humans cannot be held because the true criminal scum have been sent the final court before the LORD.  Kevin Sorbo is definately growing as an actor.  But will forever be a ""B"" movie guy.",1202428800,,239,4.1521739130434785
2897707,5,B000TGJ826,"Solid acting and a good story line made this a great, entertaining, movie. It had more action than the Walking Tall: The Payback (which I also greatly enjoyed). Sam did act like a spoiled brat and I wanted to slap her silly a few times, but she did pretty much act like a typical teenager. I had a few other nit picks, but nothing big enough to diminsh my enjoyment movie.",1193961600,,372,4.253521126760563
2897708,3,B000TGJ826,"Kevin Sorbo was great as always. The movie was action packed. Not a deep plot or anything, but Sorbo did a great job as usual. He really gave the movie some depth. As a woman I didn't like all the violence, but my husband and boys liked it.",1193443200,,240,4.020833333333333
2897709,3,B000TGJ826,"I must admit I was expecting a bit more from this movie than I got. There was no story to speak of-it got chopped up. Also,the chemistry between Nick & Kate was practically non-existent aside from their front porch reunion after she recovered from her wounds. The torture scene was too much. Overall,this movie was not bad-Kevin Sorbo did a nice job with the script he was given to work with,but I can't really recommend it.",1190937600,,424,4.592105263157895
2897710,5,B000TGJ826,"Walking Tall - the Payback was a lovely surprise. Regardless the low budget, and thanks to the director and the talent of the actors, became a great movie to watch. Kevin Sorbo, as usual, makes an amazing job, turning saddness of the character into determination and showing us the  character of a strong man. Kevin Sorbo turns a vengeance movie into a classy adventure and reminds us of our own inner strenght. A really good surprise and I'm quite sure Walking Tall - Lone Justice will be as good as The Payback. Congratulations, Kevin!",1184284800,8,537,4.712765957446808

2897730,4,B000TGJ826,I've been a Kevin Sorbo fan for many years. After reading his autobiography I'm an even bigger fan. He is truly a professional,1393804800,,126,4.521739130434782
2897731,4,B000TGJ826,"It's fascinating what a franchise Walking Tall has become. I have to say I enjoy all of the different machinations in which it appears. I think at this point it doesn't matter about how closely it sticks to the facts about Buford Pusser's life. It's become a metaphor. You just kinda know, if a movie or tv show has the name Walking Tall attached to it, what the general subject matter will  be. It will be a small town sheriff out to rid his town of bad guys. Thats good enough for me! Thats always a good starting point for an entertaining movie. I loved the original Walking Tall movie as a kid. And I have always kept track of subsequent Walking Tall titles. I like that it has kinda turned into an institution all it's own with a singular wholesome message. I don't think the message will ever get old or tired. And I think now that Buford Pussers story has been told, it's ok to branch off and dramatize it and recreate the moral of the story in various ways. I think it all still pays tribute to the man. As I stated the message never gets old and could probably be fodder for another thousand movies and tv shows. It can fit a big budget Hollywood production, or low budget B movie, and still be fun to watch. The possibilities are endless really.

This particular installment is pretty good. I think it is a notch above it's predecessor, Walking Tall ""the Payback"". Although that movie was entertaining as well. You can read other reviews to get specifics about plot and all that stuff. I just wanted to say it's a fun, entertaining movie. It's almost family friendly. There is one part definitely not suitable for children. There is a scene in which a female FBI agent is being held captive by the bad guys, and they use a pair of tin snips to remove a couple fingers in an attempt to get her and/or Kevin Sorbo to talk. It is uncharacteristically violent and graphic compared to the rest of the movie. Even more so than the rape scene was in ""the Payback"". But aside from that, it is a pretty safe movie for kids above 10yrs old I'd say.

If you've never done it, and have a free weekend. You should first collect all Walking Tall titles,even the Bo Svenson short lived Walking Tall tv series(Only 7 episodes). And sit back and have a Walking Tall marathon. From Joe Don Baker to Bo Svenson to Kevin Sorbo, and The Rock.... And don't forget the Brian Dennehy version - A Real American Hero.... It's pretty fun to watch them all back to back. I did it while recovering from surgery a few years ago. And once when I was down with the flu. It's a fun way to pass time!",1365120000,,2576,4.340248962655601
2897732,4,B000TGJ826,"Kevin Sorbo has done an outstanding job here.  Very well paced, acted, and directed movie of a former sheriff forced into a situation in which he has to defend his family from a drug cartell because his FBI wife is involved in an investigation, but, there is a leak in the task force.  It must be dealt with, but on the sheriff's terms, in down home justice!!!  Very well worth a watch!  Violence, Adult Situations, Some adult language.",1356566400,,436,4.551282051282051
2897733,3,B000TGJ826,Ididn't think lone justice was as good as the previous walking tall movie. I didn't think that there was enough action in it. I thought it was kind of lame.,1348272000,,156,4.233333333333333
2897734,3,B000TGJ826,"To much voilence in the movie, not suitable for children under 12 years old.  Adult veiwing most likely.  It is a good movie.",1306886400,,125,4.391304347826087
2897735,2,B000TGJ826,"Kevin Sorbo either does a great job, or a not so great job. This film reminded me of his fight scenes from Hercules; the series.
Made me laugh.",1302048000,,143,4.142857142857143
2897736,3,B000TGJ826,"I do enjoy most Kevin Sorbo movies.  He's one of those guys like Kris Kristofferson, Jean Claude VanDamme who are versital in that they perform well in many genre's but they all seem to 'miss' the big blockbuster/well reviewed(by critics) movies.  Not that I think very much of the 'movie critics' ideas or reviews but most of Sorbo's movies fall between Grade B and not quite a huge 'hit'.  Walking Tall Payback (see my review) was a very well done story, plot, and movie.  Lone Justice is similar in plot, but it misses the mark in chemistry and character development.  Sorbo returns as 'former Boone Texas' lawman. (Not really clear/sure if he works in this Lone Justice movie or not.  Guess he might just be 'between jobs').  At any rate, his love interest is the FBI agent (kate) from Payback, played by Yvette Nipar and the two seem to be living together but again that's not real clear.  Kates' daughter Samantha (Haley Ramm)actually steals the supporting cast lead from Kate.  Nick Prescott's (Kevin Sorbo) mother Emma(Gail Cronauer) returns but both Kate and Emma have very small roles in this movie.  The director uses flashes and zooms,quick 'blips' through parts of the movie presumably to 'intensify' the action, but it doesn't really work and is somewhat annoying.  The bad guys (drug lords/dealers) all do a good job being bad, and in a couple of scenes come off as real characters.  I suppose I should have held to my firm belief that one can tell how good a movie is going to be by watching the previews and in this case it's true.  The three previews before Lone Justice on this DVD appear to be Grade C (can't even justify B).  If you like Sorbo and the kind of 'nice guys' don't always finish last, or like to just see some good violent action thriller, then you will at least enjoy watching.  otherwise, it's probably a waste of time and money.",1291334400,,1865,4.62613981762918
2897737,4,B000TGJ826,"This dvd, is the best action movie I,ve ever seen. the story is great, it tells the tale of an ex cop from a small town who knows how to deal with the bad guys,a man, who when he asked for help from the police, does not get it one has to take the law into his own hands. T hi is one of the best dvds of the walking tall movies I have ever seen.",1264032000,,344,3.539473684210526
2897738,2,B000TGJ826,"No, ""Walking Tall: Lone Justice"" doesn't resume where ""Walking Tall: The Payback"" ended. The major players in Dallas behind sleazy Howard Morris--Traxell Byrne (Jerry Cotton of ""American Outlaws"") and his right-hand henchman, Lou Dowdy (Todd Terry of ""The Anarchist Cookbook"")--got away scot-free. Whether this was a deliberate choice on the part of the filmmakers or a gaping hole is still debatable. Those two precipitated two of the most important events in ""Walking Tall: The Payback."" In a sense, they served as plot puppeteers. They pulled strings and got the hero and the villain to dance to their tune. Instead, the ""Lone Justice"" in this genuine sequel refers to a ruthless Hispanic drug-lord, Octavio Perez (newcomer Rodrigo De la Rosa), who the Feds are prosecuting as a racketeer. Producer Andrew Stevens has a cameo as Octavio's defense attorney. Tenacious FBI agent Kate Jenson (Yvette Nipar of ""Vampire Klan"") and her rebellious daughter Samantha (Haley Ramm of ""X-Men: The Last Stand"") return, and Nick is now Kate's boyfriend much to Samantha's chagrin. Nick's mother, Emma Prescott (Gail Cronauer of ""Boys Don't Cry"") is also back in this follow-up. The story takes place initially in Dallas and then the characters retreat to Nick's ranch in the sticks. When Nick isn't battling the villains, Samantha and he bond, and she considers him more of a friend than an enemy. FBI Agent Marcia Tunney (Elizabeth Barondes of ""The Forsaken"") emerges as the most interesting character.

""Walking Tall: Lone Justice"" surpasses ""Walking Tall: The Payback."" The Joe Halpin & Brian Strasmann screenplay is a hundred times better than their previous effort, but it isn't without its flaws. Happily, ""Walking Tall: Lone Justice"" generated considerable suspense despite the clichs that clutter this familiar FBI versus the notorious drug felon narrative. This movie develops the theme of 'teamwork.' Furthermore, it features at least one example of judiciously placed foreshadowing. Pay attention to Nick and Samantha's discussion about firearms in the barn. The villains pose a greater challenge to our heroes than the previous ones did and these villains are rather nefarious. They don't mind amputating one FBI agents thumbs when she refuses to answer their questions. Our hero, Nick Prescott, finds himself in a tight situation or two. At one point, the villains have him tied up like Rambo was in ""Rambo: First Blood, Part 2"" when he was attached to mattress box springs and received jolts of electricity. Unfortunately, in spite of the superior script, director Trip Reed relies on annoying concertina zooms and frenetic jump cuts to not only intensify but also accelerate the action. The concertina zooms look jarring and the jump cuts that are designed to break up mundane actions are equally annoying. Neither of these cinematic devices adds anything to the story. On the other hand, they call attention to the lack of action.

The action unfolds with Nick driving to Dallas to see his girlfriend. Nick stops off at a convenience store to pick up fresh flowers for Kate and ice cream for dessert. This scene contains its share of humor and drama. While Nick searches for the appropriate flavor of ice cream, an African-American gangsta and his Hispanic sidekick try to rob the cashier. They demand that the cashier open the safe. Nick throws a can that knocks the poor cashier out cold and then he single-handedly thwarts the two robbers. The Hispanic robber tries to use marital arts moves on our hero and Nick routinely slings bags of potato chips at him before he takes him down. Although Nick kept the criminals from robbing the store, he winds up in jail for hitting the cashier with a can. Nevertheless, Kate comes down and gets him out of jail. Samantha, who doesn't know Nick that well yet, sees him as a distraction for her mother who is too distracted by the demands of her job to pay her daughter the attention that her daughter deems suitable. Initially, tension mounts between Samantha and Nick.

Meanwhile, Kate is part of a prosecution case against Octavio. The Feds are protecting a witness against the drug-lord who can send him to jail for good. Unlike the R-rated ""Walking Tall: The Payback"" with its objectionable rape scene that showed no nudity, ""Walking Tall: Lone Justice"" forefronts a nude scene with a Hispanic honey stripping and displaying her abundant breasts so that she can catch the eye of the witness. While he stands at the window in plain view against the wishes of his protector, Perez's henchmen relieve a bellboy of his duties and masquerade so they can get into the motel room and kill the witness. The Feds cannot prosecute Perez on a major charge, so they fall back to a money laundering charge and their witnesses are their own agents. Kate is one of them and she and her colleagues move to a safe house until they are to be called to testify. Somehow, the Perez gang learns about their whereabouts and wipes out everybody, killing Kate in the process, too. This is the first of a couple of genuine surprises that elevates ""Walking Tall: Lone Justice"" over its pathetic predecessor. The Perez gang watches Kate's funeral from a distance and they believe that their problems have been taken care of, but they are wrong, dead wrong.

Saying anything else about this better than average sequel would ruin its impact. Kevin Sorbo looks comfortable in his role as Nick. The scene in the hospital when a fellow FBI agent and he try to avoid Perez's killers churns up considerable suspense. Nevertheless, the hole that plagues this tense scene is the absence of any hospital security guards. That Perez's killers--disguised as EMTs--could smuggle automatic weapons into the hospital is too much to ask. The last scene at Nick's ranch has problems, too. The convention in both ""Walking Tall"" movies is the heroes cannot play hardball the way that the villains can and remain heroic.",1230422400,2,5926,4.994939271255061
2897739,4,B000TGJ826,"I have seen the other movies of Walking Tall and Sorbo can hold his own.  I really liked it.  It was hard for me to find here in Canada so of course had to wait to see it, was a bit skeptical at first, but just goes to show that a film can take on different actors and still have the same flare the original movie had.  Good Job.",1224460800,,329,3.739130434782609
2897740,3,B000TGJ826,"This supposed sequel to 2004's ""Walking Tall"" and 2007's ""Walking Tall: The Payback"" (which is effectively yet another remake of ""Walking Tall"") bears little resemblance to either of its predecessors. The plot centres around Nick (Kevin Sorbo), a former small-town sherriff who has moved to Dallas to be with his cop girlfriend, who is about to testify against the head of a drug syndicate. However, when Nick's girlfriend is shot, Nick takes justice into his own hands.

""Walking Tall: Lone Justice"" is nowhere near as fun as ""Walking Tall"" (the one starring The Rock), and typical of straight-to-DVD movies, stars a lot of actors whom you have probably never heard of (with the exception of Sorbo, star of ""Hercules: the Legendary Journeys""). Furthermore, some of the camera shots are weird and jumpy, which makes me suspect that the director started his career by making music videos. Nevertheless, for a straight-to-DVD movie, it's not too bad, and although not a great actor, Sorbo is likeable enough to make the film work.",1206662400,,1028,5.047058823529412
