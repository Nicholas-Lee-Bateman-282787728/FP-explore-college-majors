7022976,5,B00TXUL8E0,"Just like the first volume of DVD's for Fretboard Theory 1, this package is incredible in helping to understand the information put forward in the book. Desi's onscreen teaching is very relaxed and confident, really helping to get his message and key points across in a clear, precise manner whilst always supporting the core content of the text.",1425254400,3,346,4.982758620689655
8703278,5,B00TXUL8E0,"The Fretboard Theory Series, i.e. Vol I & Vol II along with all the DVDs that cover the chapters taught in these books have been for me the best instruction I've ever used for advancing in my guitar playing. Everything is presented in a way that makes it simple and easy to understand what seemed before to be so complicated. On the DVDs Desi is a great teacher and presenter and just working thru everything from the beginning (a couple of times) makes it much easier to get the technical ability in your fingers too. I highly recommend all of these materials for anyone who plays guitar but is plateaued and needs a kick-in-the-butt into a whole new level of understanding how it all works and ability to actually play it.",1474416000,,724,4.534351145038168

8703284,5,B00TXUL8E0,"I have played around on guitar since the Beatles and continue to buy lessons to improve.  Desi's Fretboard Theory I & II are excellent.  It takes a variety of programs for me I guess but it helped clear the muddy parts in my self taught learning.  Playing along now on CD's, videos and figuring out on my own now what pro guitarists are doing is now a lot more fun.",1438300800,,365,4.185714285714286

8703286,5,B00TXUL8E0,Desi hits the fretboard from day one throughout the material. Great material to grow and develop your guitar chops. Recommend volume one first!,1437004800,,143,5.260869565217392
8703287,5,B00TXUL8E0,This was perfect timing for me as an advanced intermediate player. Not for beginners but just excellent. I also got the DVDs and they are helpful as well.  Check out Desi Serna's webpage guitar-music-theory.  Loads of cool videos under lessons. He also has an area for beginners all free. Check his stuff out on youtube. I got both books and both sets of dvds as well as the Dummies books. Check out his podcast and listen in your car.  You can practice guitar in your head!,1435017600,2,474,4.488372093023256
