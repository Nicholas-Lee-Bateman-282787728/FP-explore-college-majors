7295401,1,B00ZVCDCK2,The CD did not contain the songs as advertised on the youtube channel. .This was a total misrepresentation of Expectation. This is a CD that contains older clips and segments that are not entertaining to toddlers.,1471564800,,213,4.944444444444445
7295402,1,B00ZVCDCK2,"Not the best Elmo video. The background, pictured, is the same the whole way through and interspersed with clips of kids playing. Buy an Elmo video that has actual Sesame Street clips of Elmo instead.",1471392000,2,200,4.742857142857143

7295406,1,B00ZVCDCK2,This isn't a movie its more like a exercise video..,1465171200,,51,4.2
7295407,1,B00ZVCDCK2,I bought this based on the YouTube clips supposedly from this video. Those scenes are not on the dvd. It's mostly very dated segments from the show. My kid watched this for about 3 minutes before he handed me the remote to change it.,1464393600,2,233,4.318181818181818

7295411,1,B00ZVCDCK2,"Pretty throughly disapointed in this video, not very long play time. The only part my child likes is the bonus elmos world. She crystal fircely with the actual video. Wish I spent my money one something else",1455408000,,207,4.621621621621622

7295414,1,B00ZVCDCK2,"Worst Elmo video I've seen in a long time. My handicapped child ADORES Elmo, but she will NOT watch this one. I thought it was just because it was new, so I sat down to watch it with her; it is unwatchable. Over 1/2 of the movie features Elmo TALKING/jumping in front of the colored squared background you see on the cover, then they cut to scenes of kids playing in playgrounds jumping around. Not your typical Elmo by far. Most of these are compilations of previously scene show spliced together to make a longer movie-we get that-but this is hideous.",1450569600,2,553,4.485148514851486

7295417,5,B00ZVCDCK2,"I purchased the Sesame Street: Play All Day Elmo video for my three year old great niece after I saw the NBC Today show's feature of Elmo and his Sesame Street friends lead some of the staff's children through a few of the activities available on the video. It looked like so much fun! My nephew and his wife report that she loves the games, activities and songs and often asks for the Play All Day Elmo video. Gotta love anything that entertains a three year old for hours.",1445558400,4,474,4.337078651685394
8720970,4,B00ZVCDCK2,"my son loves elmo, he really liked this one but it had too much real life in it. where it showed kids playing wish it more of just elmo",1521763200,,135,3.689655172413793
8720971,2,B00ZVCDCK2,"The DVD cover and rscription say "" 2 hours of fun"", but the actual movie is only about 40-45minutes. I guess They're including the previews and other ""bonus"" features in the 2 hours. She loves the movie but I was looking for and Elmo movie that was longer than 1 hour not including all that other ""fluff "" that we fast forward through.",1518825600,,335,4.333333333333333
8720972,1,B00ZVCDCK2,"LOW QUALITY VIDEO. NOT HIGH DEFINITION LIKE IN THE YOUTUBE PREVIEWS.

HALF THE VIDEO IS OF RANDOM CRAP THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE YOUTUBE PREVIEWS

THE YOUTUBE PREVIEWS CONSITSTED TOP THE TOP 2 OR 3 MINUTES OF THE VIDEO.

SO BAD I HONESTLY FELT MISLED, MAYBE EVEN SCAMMED INTO BUYING IT.",1492646400,,292,4.471698113207547

8720974,3,B00ZVCDCK2,"This is the most ""boring"" Elmo movie I have purchased so far. My two year old son dislikes this DVD more than the others. It is still Elmo and we love Elmo, but not a lot going on in this one...",1482451200,,194,3.7560975609756095
