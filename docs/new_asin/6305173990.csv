975216,5,6305173990,I thought this was a hilarious movie. The fact that all the actors were unknowns gave it a freshness and made it seem more like real life. I disagree with a previous reviewer it's not ONLY a chicks movie. The  brothers can relate to this too. Nothing beats a love story that is  funny... because love is funny. I highly reccommend.,917395200,,331,4.409836065573771

975708,5,6305173990,"Hav Plenty is a great telling of a real-life love story between two best friends whose playful tensions bloom through the different situations they encounter with the friends and family of Havaland or ""Hav"".  Lee ""Plenty"", the other half of this bestfriend duo retells the love encounters in his life through a book he is righting based on the events of a New Years weekend.

The first time I saw this movie on the cable channel ""STARZ"" I was convinced that this movie would be a black romance classic. However it did not get as much attention from critics and audiences as its sister movie ""Soulfood"". I feel that this movie is a more realistic tale of love and romance and the true depiction of a love-charged relationship between friends of the opposite sex. If you like romances with a realistic feel, this is the movie for you. The acting is nowhere near oscar gold, but the performances are still real and believable. (If you've ever spent a weekend with family and friends, then you know how crazy people can act.) Overall this movie is a classic in its own right.

This movie is great for times when you just want to relax and watch a movie with a friend or boyfriend/girlfriend...you will definitely enjoy yourself.",1293926400,,1224,4.657407407407407
975789,5,6305173990,"I saw this movie by chance when i stayed home from work one day 10 years ago, back in 2000.  i see stuff i enjoy all the time and have no qualms with the mainstream, popular, etc. movies.  actually i'm cool with them and like everything from michael clayton to the transformer flicks.  but. but, for me, this movie transcended enjoying something i saw, it was poignant and reflective of the human condition to a point that i didn't and don't get from a book or movie or play, etc.  the omniscient narration of lee and his feelings for hav, coupled with the reality of how she felt (and the fact he knew this) was special.  this is a comment on a website and i don't really know why i'm writing it.  i tried to turn a couple few people on to this film but never pushed it and don't even know if they saw it, as it wasn't in your face accessible.  also likely because i felt it touched s vein that might have been singular to some central feeling or love jones or whatever i was going through then.  when hav slips into lee's boots, that scene, where she seems to see what is going on in him, for those couple moments, it's a pure perfect translation of, again, the 'human condition', heart, love, etc.  it just hit on feelings and translating these vulnerabilities like no other medium has, for me.  i don't know.  but nothing ever, ever, has ever moved or touched me like hav plenty.  i could spend pages dissecting each scene that did it for me and explaining why this and why that.  but i don't want to write is, as there's no one i would want to know this. in abrupt sum, after so long since i came upon it, i still think about this picture at times. i feel it and it, for me, put out there a visualization of things, ugh, end",1285372800,2,1729,4.203030303030303
975790,4,6305173990,"Cherot's first film examines relationships most particular the lead character's . This is film is ""loosely"" based as a recount of the writer who is the acting lead in the film. His journey makes him very relatable as he attempts an introspection in examing his true feelings for his friend who is the object of his affection. Tracy Edmonds & Kenny ""Babyface"" Edmonds partnered to produce this film. If you like Soul Food then perhaps you'll like this film. Though not a blockbuster commercial success this film has a genuine story with some sentimentality. The lesson is we as men should be strong enough to show and talk about our feelings. Being stoic and restrained can do some damage by missing an opportunity for love. I am glad I was able to purchase it here on DVD for it can be a hard find in general retail.",1223337600,,816,4.557823129251701

I can understand how some people may not like the fact that this is a low budget movie, and some elements of the acting could have been done better.

And the film itself is amazing.  It is the first to manage to portray affluent blacks in a vast array.  The characters reflect dignity.  Sure there's some snobbishness, but it's discouraged throughout.  The reluctant romance between Haviland and Lee are kept central, but humor dominates the film.  Cherot is downright outrages.  Chenoa Maxwell is a perfect cold-blooded stiff and Robinne Lee somehow manages to downplay her stunning beauty enough to pull of the little sister role.  It's the characters and the dialogue, not a big budget that make this a must own.  No clowny, cartoony buffoonery going on.  It's just how we are.

975956,5,6305173990,"Some people compare this movie to Love Jones but I think Hav Plenty is in a class all to it's own.  Love Jones was basically a love story while Hav Plenty is more of a search for love. One was in love the other didn't realized until later.
The most memoriable line of the movie was between Havilland and Lee:
Havilland: Who do you think you are talking to me like that?
Lee: Who do you think you are that I can't.
I think those two line set the tone for the movie. I think some reviewer really missed the point about the movie.  One wonder why the women in this movie was so into him considering his appearance. Another said that no man would take such verbal abuse and still be their......
Havilland may have ripped Lee a new hole over hav's sister but
he did not just sit their and say nothing which is why I liked the two line in the movie which once again I think sets a tone for the rest of the movie....
They new each other when they where in school, they ran into each other later on in life, went out once and remained friends.
There was only two women that chased after Lee and they were Hav's sister and friend.  Hav's friend wanted him because it was new years and she just wanted to be with someone, while Hav's sister on the other hand wanted to kiss Lee because after 30 minute of talking to her (that's 30 minutes in movie time folks, not actaul time) Lee new exactly how she was feeling. Her sister Havilland did not know neither did her husband, mother nor her father.

All I can say is I enjoy every minute of it, and can't wait for my DVD to get to house so I can look at it again.",1025913600,2,1600,4.085987261146497

It is refreshing to see a movie about people of color who are not selling dope, their bodies or their pride in street gangs.  There is another culture worthy of the screen.  The young people who have hopes and dreams and a future deserve a voice and can be as entertaining as the other part of the african american experience.  If you are looking for something refreshing with depth that have nothing to do with street gangs or dope pushers, check out Hav Plenty.

975958,5,6305173990,"Kudos to Kenneth BabyFace & Tracy Edmonds for believing in this independent/low budget film. It really is a story that needed to be shared with the world.
The film opens up with a Biblical Scripture, Philippians 4:12. The story begins in New York with Christopher Scott Cherot (writer, director, actor) house sitting for a friend played by Chenoa Maxwell. He is a writer that is down on his luck at the moment. He is homeless and broke. Chenoa Maxwell plays Haviland (Hav) and she calls to check on her home and cat. After she discovers that her house sitter has no girlfriend or plans for the holidays...she invites him to spend New Year's Eve in Washington, D.C. where she is with her mother, sister, brother in law and friends. He drives five hours to be with them and that is where the story starts to evolve.
The main friend of Hav's is Caroline, whose character is best described as a snooty twit. She makes a play for Cherot, but he turns her down. Caroline adds a lot of laughter and somewhat comedic appeal to the movie. The sister, Leigh, is a newlywed and having a small problem with her husband because she has not found her place in life yet. In the midst of her confusion, she wants to kiss Cherot just once so that she will not obsess over him. He refuses her too and he is also the only one who really understands her dilemma. Thanks to Cherot, Leigh will find her place and make amends with her husband before the movie ends. The love scene between her and husband Felix is cute, funny and romantic. The music playing at the time is also very nice and sets the tone for the scene perfectly.
Hav is mad with her Fiance played by Hill Harper. He is a famous singer/pretty boy. He has been cheating on her. It is hard to really tell if the attraction between Cherot and Maxwell is mutual, which makes the movie even more unique and holds the viewer's attention. Hav is uppity and prefers to rub shoulders with the elite, famous and whose who. Lee Plenty (Cherot) is down to earth, not easily impressed and seemingly content and not ashamed of his current station in life. She seems to want him to be more on her level in order to be deemed worthy in her eyes. He wants someone who would rather decorate a xmas tree than go to a party type woman. All facts being as they are, he can't seem to leave after New Years. Each time he attempts to leave, Hav comes up with a reason for him to stay longer. Her grandmother meets him on New Year's Day and tells Hav that he will be her husband one day, but she dismisses her grandmother's wit and wisdom.
Cameo appearances at the end of the movie are made by Shemar Moore, Nia Long, Chili (TLC), Lauryn Hill and Mekhi Phifer. Other stars are Tammi Katherine Jones and Reginald Jones.
This movie is a must see! It is unique being a movie within a movie or story within a story. It is a love story that stands apart from others such as Jason's Lyric and Love Jones...but the quality is equal. BabyFace and his wife Tracy also make a brief cameo appearance since this IS A TRUE STORY. Also, I like the play with words/names for the title. You will get that part after you watch the movie...simply charming!",1012694400,5,3157,4.379897785349233
975959,4,6305173990,"It's a story about a broke writer, Lee Plenty, who spends the weekend with an old college friend over New Year's. The friend, Haviland, has some issues flying around her family, from her phony parents to her sister's marriage to her own personal struggles with her r&b mega-star phony ""boyfriend."" Lee is in the wrong place at the wrong time and his sarcastic/""artist dis-association"" attitude places him centrally into all of the crisis' in Haviland's family.
Yes, it is kinda ""bougie"", but this movie is FUNNY. I laughed all the way through. And it has a little surprise twist in the end that was nice. Not all black people are from the ghetto so wherever someone makes a statement that the movie is totally ""unrealistic"" they are ignorant. I thought it was entertaining and funny. If you liked ""Love Jones"" and ""The Best Man"", this is definitely worth a look.",1009929600,,862,4.753333333333333
975960,4,6305173990,"This is a wonderful movie despite other people's reviews. The movie opened to rave reviews at Cannes and many of the African American film festivals. Christopher Scott Cherot's portrayal of himself in an autobiographical role is superb. the movie brings to mind classic dialouge driven movies such as Blake Edwards ""10"". Its a very sophisticated tale about a writer who is writing a screenplay about his interactions with women over the course of a New Year's weekend bash. Chenoa Maxwell is wonderful, smart and sexy as his nemesis. A must see form true film fans.",1009584000,,565,4.957894736842105
975961,5,6305173990,"""Hav Plenty"" is totally reminicent of a Woody Allen film; it's a funny, realistic look at a man trying to stay afloat in the world.  Christopher Cherot deserves major props for writing, directing, and starring in this hilarious film.  Anyone who does that (especially as well as Cherot has) should get some sort of recognition.  I've been waiting for years to get this great movie on dvd, and FINALLY I've got my chance.  My advise to other movie lovers is to at least rent this gem, believe me, you'll love it!",1009411200,,511,4.582417582417582
975962,3,6305173990,"Christopher Scott Cherot hits more than he misses in HAV PLENTY, his award-winning debut film. It tells the story of an extremely broke writer named Lee Plenty (Cherot), who is invited to hang out for New Year's with his soon-to-be-married college friend, Havilland Savage (Chenoa Maxwell) and a few of her ""significant others."" Along the way, issues about the true nature of their relationship are explored. Are they ""just friends"" or is their relationship more than platonic?
Cherot is very appealing in his role. It is refreshing to see an African American man that is articulate without being particularly ""cool."" On the other hand, while a definite ""looker,"" Maxwell is so cold and manipulative in her role, sometimes you wonder what Cherot's character sees in her. Maxwell has also appeared in COLD FEET, another film that's made the rounds of the festival circuit.
Of the supporting cast, Tammi Catherine Jones almost steals the show as Caroline, Hav's buddy. Jones injects a comedic energy to all of her scenes that demand your attention. If given the opportunity, Jones could really shine in her own vehicle. Her expressive face seems particularly suited to the small screen. With the exception of a tiny role in the little seen, AMOUR INFINITY (a winner at the 2001 Hollywood Black Film Festival) and CASTING FOR GLINDA (a one-hour documentary that she directed), Jones appears to be amazingly silent in the movie biz. Hopefully not for long, because she's really the reason to check out this film.
Robinne Lee is also worth watching in her role as Leigh (note spelling), Hav's unhappily married younger sister. Of the cast members, Robinne has probably worked the most since making this film.
This romantic comedy has a breezy charm that is quite appealing. You really feel for Lee Plenty's struggles -- with his life and his relationship with Hav. Several of the dialog exchanges are also very good. Technically, it's on the level of a micro budget indie film. It's not slick -- which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but something to be aware, particularly if you only watch big budget studio films. However, sometimes you wish that at least half the time was spent with Cherot's appearance as were the women in the film. A little makeup would have gone a long way for Cherot (not to say he's a bad looking brother, he isn't).
In a case of ""live imitates art,"" after the film was screened at the Acapulco Black Film Festival (where it received two awards including best film), it was picked up by Edmonds Entertainment, music mogul Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds's production company (they also produced SOUL FOOD). Apparently, after acquiring the film, the company felt that HAV PLENTY needed a new ending. What they came up with is hopelessly corny and adds little to the film. It appeared to be a classic example of what happens when there are ""too many cooks in the kitchen.""
However, don't let that faux pas keep you from seeing this otherwise charming film. Without spoiling anyting, you'll know the added scenes have arrived when the technical quality rises abruptly (and you see some more familiar faces). If you wish, this might be a good time to stop the VCR (unless you want to fast forward to the credits).
Christopher Scott Cherot was on to something with this film. This is especially true for the more educated and/or romantic among us, that don't relate too well to 'hood movies. There's a few missteps here and there (including scenes that should have been cut), but overall HAV PLENTY is worthy of your viewing consideration.",1005436800,2,3550,4.898671096345515
976043,1,6305173990,"I rented this movie and could barely make it to the end. The lead  character is broke, smug and downright silly while the women are nasty and  materialistic. There is no one to like in this film, the acting is mediocre  at best, and the plot crawls along. As badly as Hav treated Lee, I  desperately wanted to see him grow a backbone and walk away from her. That  scene where she cussed him out after he confronts her for causing problems  in her sister's new marriage made my blood boil. I don't know any man that  would hang around after being spoken to that way.
I don't see how anyone  can seriously compare this film to Love Jones which was vastly superior.  Love Jones had ambience, rich, multi-faceted characters and the  cinematography was excellent. The same can not be said of Hav Plenty. I'm  just glad that this was a free rental.",965692800,4,842,4.437908496732026
976044,5,6305173990,"""Hav Plenty"" is based on a true story.  Lee Plenty (Christopher Cherot) is a sarcastic yet sensitive guy who spends New Year's Eve with his female friend, Havilland Savage. We're not quite sure why they bicker so  much or what kind of relationship they have, but when her neurotic friend  and her dissatisfied sister are added to the mix, we see Lee and Hav's  relationship evolve.  What emerges is a sweet, sexy mix of humor and  originality that is lacking from average romantic comedies.  ""Hav  Plenty"" works on many levels.  It is smart without taking itself too  seriously and it is full of humor without being over the top. With his  tussled hair and almost ratty sweater, Christopher Cherot is absolutely  scrumptious... intelligent and witty, yet truly fine and charming.  He  tells his true story with an honest smile that makes the audience hope like  heck that he gets the girl.  This movie is something different, something  above average, something to see with your man or your girls or both.",964915200,19,1005,4.817647058823529

I started watching it on cable last night and must admit that initially I wasn't impressed, but something  wouldn't let me change the station.  I'm so glad I kept watching.  Like  other reviewers, I know these people.  And the story, although hilarious,  was so real.  I loved Lee Plenty, and although I didn't understand his  attraction to Havilland, I desperately wanted him to end up with her.  Mr.  Cherot, wherever you are, WE WANT MORE!

Hav Plenty is a  wonderful debut for Christopher Cherot; wherever he is, I hope that he is  tapping into that facile and creative brain to bring us more.  The only  problem with this film is that there aren't 4 or 5 more Cherots out there.  This is a man to watch.",955065600,2,610,4.254385964912281

This is a must see for those in agreement!  I  have watched this movie at least 12 times and I still find it appealing  each time I see it.
