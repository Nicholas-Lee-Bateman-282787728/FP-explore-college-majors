8691238,5,B00QGKXYAG,"""Take a Ride on The North Shore Line"" is excellent. It's a video tour of the whole North Shore system, complete with maps within the video, and its menu is oriented to different parts of the system. This is a compilation of the last 25 years of North Shore operations, starting in 1938, and includes sound on many films, including the three types of whistles the passenger trains used. This is part of the local history of my hometown area. North Shore was one of the three Insul interurbans; this one went out of service as of January 21, 1963.",1474848000,,545,4.46
8691239,5,B00QGKXYAG,"Taking a ride on the North Shore is a wonderful video. Talk about when times were alot different when this interurban was operating. Starting in the 1920s to the last day in January 1963.  Traveling on Chicago's elevated, on the branches, through the farm fields, city streets in Milwaukee and crossing the 6th Street viaduct to reach the terminal. Get to view the shops in Highwood along with the footage in the winter. You'll never go wrong having this great interurban in your archives. I may not had been around when the North Shore Line was running, the tradition will continue for years to come.

I came 13 years later after it shutdown.",1427328000,,643,4.68141592920354
