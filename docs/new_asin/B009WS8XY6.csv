8544716,1,B009WS8XY6,"White belt shaolin kungfu? Now those are 4 words that do not belong together in a sentence! Since when does shaolin belong to a ranking system of any kind? Monks have no use for ranks. Secondly, white BELT kungfu? Don't you mean sash? Pure Chinese kungfu doesn't include a ranking system. This has been incorporated into some schools, but there really isn't a progressive set system for it as like what you'll find in Korean arts or Japanese arts. Get real, people. The name alone is a big turn off",1390003200,2,498,4.544444444444444
