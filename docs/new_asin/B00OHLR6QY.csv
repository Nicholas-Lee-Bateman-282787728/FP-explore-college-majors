6750924,4,B00OHLR6QY,"I found this movie by mistake. I not seen this, but the storyline sounds familiar to me, and quite strange...I would love to see this!! Also another weird twist, I think
I met Seth at a wedding in Las Vegas, NM
(Where I had no idea who he was, and he did say he was from LA. If it's the same Seth, it's no wonder you joked with me about my video taping that wedding! Also,
your natural charismatic personality, I should've realized you were an ACTOR.
(Not to mention your strikingly good looks!)- Congratulations on being married!
She's a beauty!! Come back and visit NM
sometime!! (If it's the same 5'4 guy, I met around 1996, named- Seth).., don't remember what last name you said..,but saw your pics and pretty sure it was YOU!! Wish you well! An this movie sounds like something I would like.",1508889600,,796,4.421768707482993

6750940,5,B00OHLR6QY,"In this movie, a woman gives birth to identical twins. Her husband attends a revival meeting where the preacher talks about how wife have had several miscarriages and could not have a child. The father of the twins, Mr. Hemsley, decides to give the preacher one of the twins. By the way, the preacher is Ray Liotta and his wife is played by Ashley Judd. Their last name is Wade.  After doing some research on this film, I learned that the film makers and stars deny this film has anything to do with Elvis. I am here to tell you this movie couldn't be more about Elvis. This movie is a fantasy about what might have happened if Elviss real life twin Jesse had lived and possibly been separated at birth.
Here are the similarities between the lead character and Elvis:
1) They are all born in 1935. I mean Elvis and the twins in the movie.
2) Both twins are musically talented. Who knows what Jesses talents would have been had he lived. Mr. Hemsley gives away his son with the promise that while he and his wife are alive, the twin that goes to the Wades never finds out who he really is. The twin that goes to the Wades is known as Ryan Wade which is ironic as the real name of the actor who plays the twins in this movie is named Ryan Pelton. So, Ryan plays Ryan.
3) Alabama is switched for Mississippi for the birth of the Hemsley twins. Elvis and his twin were born in Mississippi. The Drexel twins were born in Alabama while Elvis and his twin were born in Mississippi.
4) William Hemsley, the father of the twins had a hard time finding work. The same is true for Vernon Presley.
5) In one of the songs in the movie, Drexel, the superstar singing twin longs for Nashville. We know Elvis longed to be home at Graceland in Memphis. Graceland was Elviss sanctuary.
6) Both birth families were poor.
7) Both Elvis and Ryan Wade had bosses who were not nice to them and controlled their career.
Here I must take a quick break and say that the character Ryan Wade ended up being a tribute artist to Drexel Hemsley. He looked and sounded just like them so he was billed as The Identical hence the name of the movie.
8) Both Elvis and Ryan were in the army and popular for their singing.
9) Both Elvis and Ryan were truck drivers.
10) Both Elvis and Ryan were beautiful singers at an early age.
11) Both Elvis and Ryan said something happened to them when they listened to music.
12) Both found girlfriends when they were young. Ryan found Jenny and Elvis found Priscilla.
13) Both Elvis and Drexel appeared on a TV show like Ed Sullivan where the host said the entertainer was a fine boy.
14) Ryan instinctively knows Drexel so well even though he doesnt know they are twins.
15) Drexel dies young in the seventies just like Elvis. Drexel dies in a plane crash.
16) Both found girlfriends when they were young. Ryan found Jenny and Elvis found Priscilla.
17) Both Drexel and Elvis star in movies.
That is enough with the similarities. I think I have proven my point.
Going back to the movie. Drexel is not portrayed much in the movie. The movie is told from Ryans perspective.
Several scenes in the movie literally moved me to tears. One is where one twin, Dexter, was given away. Dexter becomes Ryan Wade. Another was where Ryan was performing in a contest for the best Drexel tribute artist and the real Drexel enters and says that Ryan is the winner. Did they instinctively know who they were or that they were related? They never actually spoke to each other.
Another scene that broke my heart is where Ryan, through his job as a truck driver, found Drexel (and his) mother in a nursing home. Ryan sneaks in to his mothers room. He doesnt know it is his mother but his mother recognizes him and calls him Dexter. Shortly thereafter she dies and Ryan is devastated.
After Ryans adoptive father has a heart attack, Ryan finds the letter from his birth parents who explain who they are, who Ryan is, and why they gave him away. At this point Ryan goes to the birthplace of Drexel which just happens to have the cemetery out back where his mother and brother are buried and a tombstone is also there for Dexter the twin who the Hemsleys pretended had died. So, to be blunt, Ryan is Dexter. Of course, this is Ryans birthplace too.
Ryan forgives his birth father as they are both at the cemetery at the same time which is yet another moment that makes me cry. Ryan goes on to have a successful career as a Drexel tribute artist.  Ryan never tells people he is Drexels twin.
Some people may find this movie stupid. However, I find this movie full of talented actors, a compelling story, questions on what if Elviss twin had survived, and a fun soundtrack. I would recommend this movie for all Elvis fans.",1479600000,2,4701,4.402298850574713

6751015,1,B00OHLR6QY,"I can't begin to tell you how bad this movie is. I was suckered in by the fact that it involves Ashley Judd, Seth Green, and Ray Liotta. The first two must have become involved because of the fact that Liotta financed this thing.

They are all good actors and do well in this. But that is the only redeeming characteristic of this train-wreck of a movie that poses the question, ""What if Elvis's twin brother had not died at birth?"" It then creates the least imaginative and most unlikely response possible to that question: He'd have been an Elvis impersonator who would have become almost as famous as the King himself by doing nothing but covers of Elvis's songs (Honestly. That's the plot.)

This movie is basically a vanity project for the ""actor"" who plays the main character. This actor is an Elvis impersonator in real life. This movie gives him a chance to live out his fantasy of having Elvis see his act and then receiving his blessing as the world's best Elvis impersonator.

6751018,2,B00OHLR6QY,"I almost gave this 3-stars, but what I really didn't like -- and which caused me to give 2 stars instead -- is the whole weird Elvis connection.  Elvis had a twin brother (Jesse Garon) who died at birth, and the death of this twin messed with Elvis' head his entire life.  I feel this film was COMPLETELY based on the idea of ""what if"" Elvis' parents lied to him that his twin died and that, instead, he was alive and well somewhere out there.  This would be a twist on the ""Elvis is still alive"" whacko belief so many diehard fans had for so many years.

The parallels to Elvis' life were so obvious and so distracting that I couldn't really care about the characters/story in the film; i.e., all I could think about was 1) is Elvis' life the real subplot, and 2) if so, why in the world did anyone decide to make this movie?

Setting the issues regarding Elvis aside, the story itself was sappy, sentimental, contrived, and unbelievable.  I resent the pandering mentality which sought to get this movie watched by labeling it ""a family film.""",1435708800,,1044,4.439790575916231

6751026,5,B00OHLR6QY,This movie is very family friendly and I like that it depicts how some modern music can be bad and not glorifying to God.

The actor Blake Rayne uses the name Ryan Pelton to do Elvis in Las Vegas.",1433721600,,418,3.988095238095238

6751041,1,B00OHLR6QY,"Everybody always talks about The Room as that movie you have to see to believe. Its about time something new comes along and takes that title, and that movie is The Identical. People, this is one of those movies where nothing I say or write can do it justice. This movie is a beautiful mess from beginning to end. Trailers won't show anything interesting, and neither will any plot summaries. You kind of have to go into this one with very little knowledge about it. If you read my review here, Im going to be ruining some of the surprise for you, but trust me when I say that its 100 times worse than I make it sound. This is the kind of film where you need to watch it with a group of friends and while I myself don't drink, some booze will make it even better for most people. Had I seen this in theaters with a friend or two, we wouldve been making jokes out loud through the whole thing, and I guarantee you no one wouldve been mad at us for it.

Ryan Wade is a young man who was taken in by a preacher and his wife not long after his birth, because his parents couldn't afford to take care of both him and his identical twin brother. Ryan goes on to have a nice life, studying to follow in his adoptive fathers footsteps, while his brother goes on to be a huge rock star. However, Ryan isn't aware of this, and doesnt know he was adopted either. While he lives a good life, his true calling is music. Rock n roll to be precise. He even goes across the county line to bars just to hear the newest songs from bands that would never dream of playing in his area. Of course his father will have none of this, and sends him off to the army for two years. When he comes back, he continues to pursue music, and starts to become a local celebrity for looking exactly like the newest sensation- Drexel Hemsley.

Where do I even start? I cant even say that this was the first thing that caught me off guard, but one of the biggest things was certainly how they go out of their way to never once mention Elvis name. Drexel Hemsley practically -is- Elvis, and Blake Rayne, who plays both him and Ryan, looks exactly like Elvis. So its pretty hard to not make comparisons to Elvis here. Drexel/Ryan sing like Elvis, they have similar music to him, the outfits are the sameand yet with how they never mention The King, youd think that this is some kind of alternate world where Elvis never existed. UNTILlater on in the movie when a music executive talks to Ryan and tells him that theres only one Elvis out there. Wait, what? So if Elvis exists in this films world, wouldnt he have totally sued Drexel for essentially copying every aspect of him? And you know what the kicker is? Blake Rayne used to be an Elvis impersonator at one point in his life! Then when you look at Elvis history and see that Drexel and Ryan were born around the same time as Elvisand that Elvis also had a twin brother who was a stillborn. Why did they copy these aspects of Elvis life and do THIS with it?

Other amazing things about this movie include the fact that the director, Dustin Marcellino is the son of a song writer. Once I found that out, it was clear that they used this movie as a way to get their own original songs out there, hoping to get some of that Faith Money, as The Identical falls into the faith-based category, which has a pretty dedicated audience who takes what they get without hesitation. This wouldnt be so bad if the songs were good! All the songs here are forgettable and sound like bottom of the barrel unreleased Elvis songs that were unreleased for a reason. Then you have some legitimately good actors like Ray Liotta, Ashley Judd and Joe Pantoliano, and it hurts to see them here. Ray Liota acts to the best of his ability, as he would in any other film, but Blake Rayne is such a terrible actor, giving the same dumb duh face in every scene no matter whats happening, that you can practically read Rays mind as he thinks come on kid, act. Do something, react to what I just told you. Dont just stand there!. Poor Ashley Judds character is reduced to nothing but nodding and smiling along with everything Ray says. The funny thing with her is that she never ages. Ray Liottas character ages drastically through the film, but she stays the exact same from beginning to end. They didn't even try with her. And Blake Rayne is such a poor actor that you can do an image search for him right now, pick any picture at random, and I promise that thats the face he makes through this whole movie. Someone has a heart attack? Duh face. Someone tells him some good news? Duh face.

The last things Ill mention are that the movie has this weird pro-Israel message that comes out of nowhere. The Six Day War is covered for a few minutes, while all this other stuff during that time period is going on like JFK and Martin Luther Kingbut thats what they chose to focus on. They don't even go anywhere with it, and just use it for a brief minute during a sermon. The other weird thing is how a lot of the songs and clothes they feature here are out of place by at least 10 years. I had to keep thinking back to the years that popped up on-screen whenever time passed because it wasn't accurate.

Just watch this movie. Theres nothing else like it.",1432339200,4,5238,4.2868686868686865

I don't know if the story is true and that adds to the intrigue. I don't remember any bad language and I was never uncomfortable with any scene. No sex, drugs and rock and roll in this film.

That is all I could think of the first time I saw the movie; and why I had to watch it again.

Ryan Wade (Blake Rayne) is raised by a preacher (Ray Liotta) but doesn't hear the calling. He wants to be a singer like Drexel, his twin that he doesn't know about. He gets gigs as a Drexel impersonator.

That's the premise of this film, and even non-Elvis fans will enjoy seeing Ryan struggle between what his family wants for him and what his heart tells him. It's obvious throughout the film that God is trying to bring the brothers together, and in one memorable scene, they're actually in the same room without knowing it. I won't spoil the ending, but it wasn't as predictable as I thought it would be.
And the music! I recommend buying the soundtrack album, as the music is so well-done all by itself! It's so perfect all on its own, capturing the feel of the era without going over the top into parody. I could listen to the music alone for hours!

This movie is not about the life of Elvis Presley, but the main character is most surely based on him, and the actor who plays him is one of the best Elvis impersonators I've ever seen.

As most Elvis fans know, Elvis was born a twin and his brother died at birth.  This movie basically asks the question:  What if Elvis' brother lived and was raised by a different family?  Again, I don't suppose it's a really believable plot, but my husband and I enjoyed it.  It was clean, had a lot of good music, and it had a lot of heart-warming moments.",1425081600,,647,4.35

6751115,5,B00OHLR6QY,"This movie is fantastic. I'm not an Ashley Judd fan, but she was spectacular. I am a Ray Liotta fan and he was stellar. But the reason I wanted this movie was for the star. Ryan Pelton (billed as Blake Rayne) is the Elvis Tribute Artist that made me start checking out ETA's. Ryan does an amazing job in this role - and he's a wonderful actor. He's also really easy on the eyes. REALLY EASY! If you love Elvis, or like Elvis, or are curious about Elvis, you need to see this movie. If you like (love) any of the actors, you need to see this movie. If you're into (any) ETA's, you need to see this movie. I won't give out what I think the movie is trying to say, but if you ever thought to yourself, ""what if...."", then you NEED to see this movie. I was on the edge of my seat watching. I was dancing in my seat, because the music is fantastic. And my mouth was agape with every twist and turn. This is truly a magnificent movie.

6751120,4,B00OHLR6QY,"Great movie and an original idea for once. Of course, anyone who knows anything about Elvis will see through this film that the writer(s) had to be fans. From the obvious look and sound of the lead to little details such as a twin brother, Jewish symbols on jewelry and a trust-worthy tv host proclaiming that a misunderstood and controversial entertainer is really a good boy. This film is oversaturated with the king's likeness and life but BE WARNED: this movie is NOT about Elvis. I have read multiple reviews on multiple sites from Elvis fans that are ""mortified"" by this Elvis biopic... that it is not. The Elvis persona is merely the inspiration for how the filmmaker(s) chose to represent a superstar character and obviously chose to parallel the Presley family a little to build the character and you know what? That's okay. You also have a handful of folks who absolutely despise faith-based films and they make their way onto different sites as their Cheetoh-stained fingers dance across computer keyboards sending out their digital diatribes from their parents basements (or from a table at Starbucks) in the form of a review in order to make themselves feel triumphant in the fight against Christianity whether they have seen the film or not. Here is the deal, the film is fun, family-friendly and offers up an original idea (as far as movies are concerned) and is accompanied by an original and impressive soundtrack. It goes without saying that Ray Liotta delivers as usual and Seth Green, Ashley Judd, Blake Rayne, Joe Pantoliano, Brian Garaghty, Chris Mulkey and the rest bring stellar performances to the film. The cinematography is captivating and creative which is no easy feat considering the production team only had 35 days to tell a story that spans over decades. So, if you understand that this is NOT an Elvis movie and you are NOT terrified and offended if a biblical passage crosses your hypersensitive ear canals, then you may proceed and enjoy this heartwarming and entertaining tale.",1423958400,2,2014,4.926470588235294

While original to the movie, the songs were so familiar to the time period that we thought they were actually from that period.

The movie showed a lot of respect for the relationship - and honored the 'faith' struggle of finding one's own path in life.  Very uplifting film void of swearing and other inappropriate material.

That love has carried through to this day.  Any time a movie relating to Elvis in some comes out, I always go see it.  I loved this movie even though it is very loosely based on Elvis.  The only connections are the twins issue & the music.  I don't feel you have to be an Elvis fan to enjoy this film.  It has superb music & the acting is all very good.  The period scenes are wonderful.  Really enjoyed going back in those days seeing the clothes & the vehicles.  This film is a good choice for family viewing.  So many films today are not family viewable so people have to get baby sitters or somehow get the kids out of the house.  I felt it was pure entertainment with good music to boot.

The only exception is the polished nostalgic look with new props and mint vintage cars instead of things carrying different ages of use and dirt.

6751187,5,B00OHLR6QY,"The Identical came out in the movie theaters in Summer 2014, and I wanted to go see it with some friends. However, our plans didn't work out, and we missed seeing it at the theater. So I was excited when the DVD version arrived at my house for me to review and host a giveaway of it.

But can I be completely honest with you? My family was sooooooo not on board with watching The Identical.  All they could say is, ""We are NOT going to watch a movie about a fake Elvis impersonating another fake Elvis!""  And then there were all the jokes about the ""Fake Fake Fake Elvis"". I wasn't happy.

But I finally convinced them to give me 15-20 minutes to watch the beginning of the film. The deal we made was if the acting and/or cinematography and/or music score was lame, they could leave and go do something else. They actually really liked it! Wow. I was so surprised. Pleasantly surprised.

The acting was on par with other films in the theater, unlike some of the lower budget Christian movies I watch from time to time. The music score was original and fresh, without being distracting. Not too busy - and not too boring. It was pleasant to listen to. Cinematography was very good. All in all, it was a film we were thankful we had the opportunity to watch. And my teen girls were very surprised that in the Great Depression era, sometimes babies and children were adopted out to other families simply because some parents couldn't afford to feed more than one or two children. That's such a tragedy.

On Jan. 8, 1935, Elvis Presley was born in Tupelo, Miss. His twin brother, Jesse, was stillborn. What if Elvis' brother had lived? That's the theme of The Identical, a movie not actually about Elvis all. The Identical is about twin brothers Ryan and Drexel who are separated at birth. During the course of this 107 minute long, rated PG film, the twin brothers, though separated almost at birth, grow up looking and sounding like Elvis. One of the twin boys grows up to have a wildly successful ""rock star"" career...while the other twin boy - well, I don't want to spoil the story.

Anyway, here's why The Identical received a PG rating:

*mild ""hip shaking"" Elvis-style, and some couples dance in a mildly sensual way
*a wife wears a dress that shows cleavage
*a police officer hits one of the twins in the face
*one use of h---, one use of ""Oh, my G-d"", and one use of ""Oh, my L--d""
*a few cases of characters drinking and smoking
*a police officer describes a roadhouse full of African-Americans as ""dark and nasty""

I thought some of you would want to know any negative aspects of this film for your own sake or in case you have children watching it with you.",1421366400,3,2664,4.453798767967146
6751188,5,B00OHLR6QY,"Let's face it. Nothing is more American than rock-n-roll, love and faith. Baseball is a close second, but nothing about this movie represents baseball unless you want to talk about the cast. Remember Ray Liotta from Field of Dreams? Mix in a healthy dose of the girl-next-door Ashley Judd, Seth Green, (The Italian Job/Family Guy) and add in new comer Blake Rayne, and you have an unforgettable tale of Americana at its best. Here's where it gets unforgettable. The set up; twins, born during the Great Depression, shortly thereafter separated and living totally opposite lives, both with the same gift, one using it, the other torn between chasing his dream or pleasing his parents.

It's a hard choice whether to recommend the movie based on the plot or the amazing soundtrack. In fact, Peace Media and Capitol Christian Distribution have just released the movie on DVD and have included the soundtrack. I'm sure feedback from The Identical movie goers was overwhelmingly positive regarding the music, indirectly insisting that the soundtrack become a must-have in their collection. With the soundtrack spanning the 50s, 60s and 70s and including major genres such as Pop, Rock, R&B and Bluegrass, it is a winning combination for any music lover.

This is a movie that will be kept in my collection and viewed many times. As much as I want to repeatedly point out how incredibly happy I am that it is a faith based project, I love it for many reasons. Yes, faith is important to me, but so is doing what I was created to do and in a way that impacts the largest audience. My family means everything to me, and the family dynamics in The Identical is true to life. I also can not say it enough....the music is outstanding!

Whether you end up loving it for the plot or the music, you will not be disappointed. For me, it's a no brainer. I love it for both!",1421280000,2,1857,4.672782874617737
6751189,4,B00OHLR6QY,"THE MUSIC IS GREAT AND THE STORY HAS GREAT MOMENTS --- A FULL MOVIE REVIEW

WHY SOME AREN'T LIKING IT: This movie was harshly panned by professional critics (and a some that didn't enjoy the Elvis connection or perhaps thought the acting faltered in places).  It's fair enough to say the budget was thin.  There are just a few moments where the acting waivers, though there are also excellent performances. The lead actor has Elvis eyes and I am sure the physical likeness and musical resemblance was intentional.  For viewers who know they can't get past these ideas, perhaps it won't meet your tastes.  BUT PLEASE ACCEPT this attempt to simply describe what many are finding enjoyable, or what other people don't like so each viewer can decide for themselves.  Because each side has valid points, I think it's ok for each viewpoint to express their ideas in their own reviews without being offended by others that disagree.

THE POSITIVE THAT PROFESSIONAL CRITICS MISSED:  Though the movie has a serious underlying message of finding your own path, I also don't think it's trying to take itself too seriously.  Yes Ryan Wade and Drexel Hemsley are clearly Elvis knock-offs.  But they are not lampooning Elvis.  In fact, the music they create is quite excellent and I would even call it an homage.  The movie does have a little fun with Elvis' career through the 50's 60's and 70's, and with the pop culture of those eras in general.  Drexel Hemsley even makes a movie which clearly has a little fun with Elvis films, many of which themselves were just having good fun.  Whatever you think about the acting in some instances, I actually found Ray Liotta to be quite exceptional as a supporting actor.  We all knew he could play an energetic, depression era revival preacher like few others.  But the depth of his emotion on the other side was really surprising.  The serenade scene with Ryan to Jenny, backed up by his auto shop boss, was sweet and hilarious!  Joe Pantoliano (playing his boss) actually has a voice and his character is one of the highlights of the movie as well.  It's obvious that the vocals are dubbed in for the major performances so I can see why some won't like that too.  I simply suggest for those who can, look past the shmultzyness, enjoy the sweet moments, don't take the Elvis connection harshly.  You might just find the movie touching you when you didn't expect.  And, you may be tapping your toes all the way through!

THE PLOT:  Ryan Wade was born an identical twin to a depression era family who couldn't afford to raise two kids.  After much soul searching and prayer, they decide to allow a local preacher and his wife to take one of the boys to raise on their own on condition they don't reveal the secret until both original parents have passed.  The Wades are unable to have their own children and raise Ryan, loving him as their own.  The pastor expects Ryan to follow in his footsteps and sends Ryan to school for the reason of becoming a preacher.  Unfortunately Ryan does not feel that calling and has a demonstrable talent for music.  In particular, the new soul inspired Rockn' Roll.  Apparently this musical talent is deeply rooted in Ryan's DNA since his identical twin Drexel has a similar ability.  As Ryan's talent is discouraged and at times even suppressed, Drexel follows a career of superstardom.  All the while, people remark on how much Ryan looks like him.  Ryan struggles with his own identity and his own path and it's obvious he will have to face his real identity at some point.  Those moments where he has brushes with his identity are some of the most poignant of the show.

Those who dislike the movie do have valid points and I hope I have described enough that people can make that choice for themselves.  If the movie still attracts you, I suggest kicking back and not taking it too seriously.  Let the melodramatic moments slide, look at the cheesiness and similes as a bit of intentional fun, and even homage to some admittedly quirky eras (like the 70's). Give it just a rent before you buy unseen.",1421280000,17,4069,4.648459383753502

It sucked me in, but OMG the movie is fabulous.  Someone actually took a part of history and made it into a fiction movie; but it could just as easily be true.

I just want to give it away and spoil it right now; but I won't.  It is a movie with historic significance, as well as awesome cars, a perfect example of the hair and fashion; and the music is a tad above what the era actually was.

And it is not a God or religious movie at all; it is a DNA movie, with God directing the sequence.",1421107200,,636,4.007936507936508
6751191,4,B00OHLR6QY,"Okay, it's not the best movie ever made and sometimes it's a little cheesy. That being said, it was a movie I could go see with my parents and not flinch (no cursing, no sex scene), it was an interesting story (what if an Elvis-type star had a twin that he didn't know about), and I thought the actors did a great job (Blake Rayne was an Elvis impersonator pulled off the street for his first film) . One thing that I did not like was that a person in the film mentioned Elvis. Due to the time period of the film and what the main actor looks like, I don't think both Drexel and Elvis would have existed in the same universe. I am not sure why there are so many bad reviews from critics. While it might not be in the top movies ever made, I definitely didn't feel it was MST3K quality, and the pacing of the film made sense to me. This is a family film by a Christian film company, so yes there is mention of religion and God in the film. However, a lot of people grow up in that environment (Esp. in the south in the 50s-70s) so I think it is a fairly accurate portrayal of the family of a preacher.",1421107200,,1100,4.027397260273973
6751202,5,B00OHLR6QY,"The Identical is a very interesting, fast-paced movie. I really enjoyed how twin boys born to a very poor farmer during the depression became separated when they were infants, but later their paths crossed.
 This movie shows how twins are so much alike even when they are separated.
  The singers sort of give you the impression of Elvis, but they don't say it.
  You will see how a secret kept will eventually come out. How it hurts everyone who keeps the secret and those it is about. Also it talks about how parents sometimes put their own expectations on  their children and the children go along with it at first. Everyone has to make their own career choices and do what God intended for them to do.
  The Identical is a very good, God-orientated movie. The whole movie is about what God has for a person and how we can forgive others for the wrong they have done us.
  Some very touching scenes that will make you run for your tissues. I highly recommend this DVD.
Even my adult children loved it and thought it was interesting.

DVD ~ The Identical,  2014
releasing January 13, 2015

Original music written in 2014, authentically reflects the 1950s, 60s, and 70s portrayed in the film, The Identical. The story begins during the Depression era of the 1930s. At the end of a growing crop season, a young couple have newborn sons. Attending a tent revival, the husband hears the preacher say he and his wife have not been able to bear a child. Concerned for lack of providing for two children, one child is given to them with the promise that the true identify will not be revealed until the death of the birthing parents. Both sons are drawn to music, one publicly and the other naturally talented but attending school to follow in the footsteps of his father.

The mind of man plans his way, But the LORD directs his steps.
  --Proverbs 16:9

Can you relinquish your dreams for someone else? Ryan Wade's father enlists him in the army after being called by the police to come and get Ryan at a roadhouse across the county line. Ryan is drawn by music new to him, that resonates within his heart. The movie ends in the 1970s, following Ryan's dream brought alive upon winning a contest reflecting public singer, Drexel Hemsley. Being encouraged by his wife, Jenny, Ryan signs with an agent and tours at county fairs and concert venues.

Rated PG thematic material and smoking. Parental guidance suggested. Some material may not be suitable for children. Dove.org family approved Ages 12+. Approximately 107 minutes.

6751204,5,B00OHLR6QY,"We LOVED this movie!!! It came across like it was based on a true story, but it was entirely fictional. If I had to describe it, I would say it was almost like a What if? story. What if Elvis had a twin brother, and nobody knew? What if that brother was adopted by a preacher, but still had a heart for music? What you get is one amazing movie.

Elvis was before my time, but everyone knows who he is. I cant tell you how much of this story is true to the real Elvis, but it honestly doesn't matter to me. And I didn't really get the redemptive story line described in the actual movie description. In fact, this was mainly a Christian movie because of the Christian characters. There wasn't anything really spiritual about it in my opinion, but it was still a good film and we highly recommend it.",1420934400,,798,4.215686274509804
6751205,4,B00OHLR6QY,"Its a family friendly film. I was actually very impressed with that considering it has actress Ashley Judd and actor Seth Green. Not that they are bad at their jobs but Ive seen movies with both that were definitely not family friendly.  However, this one is and I was glad that when my kids walked into the room there was nothing to be shocked at.

I will say its not my absolute favorite movie but I did enjoy it. It is worth watching at least once. My heart went out to the moms in this film and to Ryan Wade, played by Blake Rayne.  Its a story of a man trying to find his own call in life.  His father wants him to follow in his own footsteps as a minister. However, Ryan has a pull to sing and write music. So you see the struggle not only the son is having with trying to find where he fits in but also with the father as he has to try to let go and let his son follow Gods plan for his life. There were some very moving moments in the story.

I was impressed with Ray Liotta and Ashley Judd in this movie. Blake Rayne sounds exactly like Elvis when he sings. At one point I thought I was listening to Elvis singing the songs but the music is all original to this movie. If you enjoyed the music of the 50s, 60s and 70s you will definitely enjoy this movie.",1420675200,,1264,4.0

My Review:

 The Identical, to my family and I was the perfect family movie. We sat around after a long day and begin watching a movie that was a great story about Ryan Wade that was born Dexter Hemsley. He was born to very poor parents as was his twin brother. The time come shortly after their birth for the parents to make a choice. And make a choice they did, one that would change the lives of everyone involved immensely.

 In The Identical, there were some major actors that I enjoyed watching Ashley Judd, Ray Liotta, and Seth Green just to name a few. I really like that some of the best known actors around are starting to get involved with more inspirational type movies. This movie was riveting but also had a very down home kind of feel that will make it a very memorable movie. It's nice to be able to view something that I don't have to worry at all about the message it is sending to my children. This is a great story all around!

I just watched a really great movie.  I knew it was going to be terrific before I watched it. Why? My kids, 17, 15, 13, my husband, and a couple of our friends in their twenties watched it late at night last weekend.  I was beat, so I went to bed early. Now I know why they liked it so much. I mention their ages to let you know that it appeals to a broad age group.

This is a movie that will tug on your heartstrings. It's filled with heartache, frustration, confusion, happiness, hope, fun, determination, love, anger, despair, reconciliation, and ultimately the happy ending that we all hope for.

The movie hinted at what the rock scene was like in the late sixties and early seventies without actually getting into the ugly of it. I didn't feel uncomfortable with my children seeing it.  No vulgar language, no inappropriate relationships, no nudity, nothing I wouldn't sit down and watch with Jesus... which is a good thing, because I did. ~smile~

Ashley Judd and Ray Liotta were amazing as Ryan Wade's parents. The emotion and depth of conviction were convincing. Blake Rayne was The Identical. His talent was displayed brilliantly in his music. He played his part in the movie with skill, passion, and sincerity. The music was really good.

Amy said, ""Extremely sad and extremely serious, but I think you'll like it. Once you start the movie, you don't want to pause it for anything.""

Emily said, ""It's a good story of how are dreams play into God's grand scheme of things.""",1420416000,,1540,4.636029411764706
6751208,5,B00OHLR6QY,"There sometimes comes a movie that really impacts you in a powerful way, portraying just what sacrifice, unconditional love and forgiveness looks like. The Identical is just that movie. Starring Ashley Judd, Ray Liotta and Blake Rayne, that take viewers back in almost a parallel story of sorts you can't help buy compare at times to Elvis Presley. It begins in the mid 1930's in Tennessee, in the midst of the depression. For William and Helen Helmsley it means a whole lot more. As William struggles to find work in a depression laced town, Helen gives birth to twin sons. Knowing how difficult it is to make ends meet for just themselves, William arrives to a revival tent meeting being led by Reece Wade (Ray Liotta) who is telling those present of their own recent troubles of trying to conceive and now being told they will never be able to have children. He asks those in attendance to pray for God's favor to provide and in William's case, the solution to their financial problem.

He invites the Wade's over to announce that with heart-felt prayers by both of them, that he believes God is asking them to give one of their sons to the childless couple to raise. It's a tough decision for the Hemsley's but they believe giving one of their sons to a God-fearing couple is just the answer to the prayers. William begs Reece to never tells the boy as he grows older about his birth and subsequent adoption to the Wade family and they vow to raise him up in a good Christian home.

As the two boys grow their talents in music become apparent. Drexel Helmsley becomes the newest singing sensation while Reece tries to convince Ryan to follow what he believes is a calling in his own life, to follow in his father's footsteps and become a preacher. Soon it becomes too much for Ryan trying to live up to his father's expectations for him despite this overwhelming desire for music and they soon part ways. Along the way Ryan is constantly being asked if he realizes how much he looks like Drexel, to which he is genuinely humble. It never dawns on him that the two might be related no matter how much Ryan feels compelled to copy Drexel's music style. How it plays out in the end is beautiful, heart-warming and one that you will be sure to want to watch again and again.

I received The Identical by City of Peace Films compliments of Propeller LLC for my honest review in exchange for a complimentary copy of the DVD. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review and the opinions contained in this review are my own personal opinion. The music in the movie is solid and one I found myself wishing I had the CD for, which is also available. It truly takes you back to those times when Elvis Presley's soulfull melodies filled the airwaves. The Identical DVD is about 107 minutes in length and contains bonus features which include, the making of The Identical, Behind the Scenes and my favorite, the music of The Identical. Perfect for all ages and is Dove Family approved for 12 and up. I think anyone can truly enjoy it and that is why I rate this one a 5 out of 5 stars!",1420416000,17,3099,4.49113475177305
6751209,4,B00OHLR6QY,"Overall, The Identical was an enjoyable, family friendly movie that featured lots of music. It was a story that emphasized following Gods plan for your life and it did a good job of showing what could happen when trying to follow the dreams of someone else.

I did find the obvious Elvis slant a bit distracting, especially when Elvis was actually mentioned in the film. The young man just looked, moved and sang too much like Elvis for my personal preference. It would have been much more original and engaging without that unmistakeable resemblance.

Otherwise, my husband and I enjoyed the film and were quite happy with the way it ended with family secrets revealed and restoration of the entire family. I thought the actors did a good job in their roles and the cinematography was excellent.

Dont believe all the bad press about this movie. It is fun to watch and if you like music, it is all the more so.

6751210,3,B00OHLR6QY,"The story starts out extremely engaging.  Its a sweet, tender story about a young man finding his way in life, and I enjoyed the storyline.  After a while, it seemed to drag on for methe same story being played over and over.  The music is fun, and I especially like the song Angel of Mine that is played when hes on his first date with a young woman.  I love the moral to the story; that we need to follow OUR OWN path, not the path that others have chosen for us.  I appreciated that it was a movie I could let my kids watch with me, and I didn't have to worry that there would be scenes that were inappropriate.  We need more family friendly films in the world!",1420329600,,664,4.069230769230769
6751211,1,B00OHLR6QY,"the stars are boring ! the elvis wanna be is a ETA who can sing without blowing out of key through his nose. the story is just stupid.  I LOVE ELVIS PRESLEY and its a shame when hollywood tries to cash in and the cast is again boring. i ' ll skip and just watch  ELVIS  WITH KURT RUSSELL,  a much better picture and soundtrack. REAL SINGING !!!! or watch  ELVIS ON TOUR !!",1420243200,,372,3.972972972972973

8683580,5,B00OHLR6QY,"This is a beautiful movie. Great music. Every time I watch it, I am so happy to view a movie without violence, perverted sexuality, cursing and hate. The Elvis lookalike issue is a little weird but this movie is someone's dream and idea and I respect that. I love that so many of the stars I like are in this movie. It is a precious story of the love between a father and mother and son and a wife and husband. The heart of a young man and his need to be a musician is so sweet and sad. He never got a chance to know his brother but one time. He is a good son and husband and friend. That is rare these days. Even though he walked away from the ministry , I believe it was his faith that carried him through. In the end he embraced who God created him to be. Enjoy!!",1522195200,,766,3.9166666666666665
8683581,5,B00OHLR6QY,"This is a FIVE STAR movie. If many of the left-leaning critics hadn't done all they could to destroy and besmirch this movie, it would have been seen by a much wider audience. And that is sad!  It has Christian values, and the love which unfolded between the lead character and the beautiful young nurse needed no nude scenes to convey the strength of their love, just great music and fine acting. The star, Blake Rayne, in his first movie role, was charismatic and very believable, and I wish his wonderful performance in ""The Identical"" would have propelled him to further heights and more movie roles. Seth Green was funny and absolutely terrific. And the Oscar should have gone to Ray Liotta for his acting in this movie. This is a very different Ray Liotta than every other film I have seen him in. He was mesmerizing! Some of the writing could have been a little better which would have strengthened the weaker portions of the plot. However, and that said; this movie in its entirety, has ""The Magic"" and stays with you long after the ending credits have rolled. Oh, and not one six o'clock shadow on any male actors faces (like every other movie out today). It's worth seeing for that alone!!",1519948800,,1199,4.602803738317757

8683584,5,B00OHLR6QY,"As most of you probably know, Ryan Pelten plays the lead.  He is an Elvis impersonator in real life.  Why he didn't use his real name in the credits is a mystery since he gives a great performance.  We did not know this movie existed until we saw Ryan perform in our town and it was mentioned.  Ryan can sing and act and this is a wonderful feel good movie for everyone.  Watch it with your kids or alone, but have some tissues available.",1517875200,,438,4.166666666666667
