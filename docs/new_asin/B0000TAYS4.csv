8002559,4,B0000TAYS4,"I fondly remember having this on VHS back in the mid-90's; it's the 6-episode sequel to the late 80's 4-part ""Dominion Tank Police"" series.

Though not as engaging as the first series, it does have it's merits, and for those who had a crush on the awfully bad-behaved Cat Sisters Anna and Uni Puma, they will be rewarded by many appearences of the badly (un)dressed duo throughout the story (I'm not sure if they're androids like in the manga, or modified humans--- there is a scene with them featuring opened cans of food at one stage, but no matter; they're still adorable/spiteful/mentally backward as ever). And of course there's plenty of techno-action from that ridiculously small ""Bonaparte"" tank...

An interesting series for collectors of Masamune Shirow memorabilia(Ghost in the Shell, etc.)",1343088000,,801,5.106870229007634

I've just watched both versions of Tank Police; Dominion and New Dominion.  Despite some poor reviews I saw on the web, I personally enjoyed the first one greatly, laughing aloud frequently.  The second version struck me as typical Saturday morning garbage--lacking in humor, personality and utterly boring.  I'll go into the differences here:

New Dominion does not follow Shirow's art style, uses a generic rock soundtrack, forgettable voice acting, poor animation and lacks both any ties to the story in Shirow's manga, any visual similarity to the setting (polluted air, organic-looking buildings/city), and completely lacks the over the top humor of the manga, and almost completely misses the personalities created by Shirow.  I guess all I can say about it is that it would fit in well with the US Saturday morning line up.  But that's not a compliment.  Any fan of the manga should give this a pass.",1201219200,,1073,5.833333333333333
8002561,2,B0000TAYS4,The originial Dominion Tank Police was more entertaining-this gets caught up in a bunch of metaphyiscal baloney. And the dvd selling used for 185 bucks!?!?!? You've gotta be kidding-I've got much better anime to spend my money on.,1200873600,,230,5.078947368421052
8002562,4,B0000TAYS4,"Not quite as manic or blackly comic as ""Dominion Tank Police"" and not as darkly lit either, this is still a fun and funny entry in the Anime cannon. The humor is more harmless slapstick here than it was in the first series (no tying thugs to spinning wheels while throwing knives at him stuffing a live grenade in his mouth). Some of the English voice cast were replace, some for the better, some for the worse, an other with no real noticable difference.",1142121600,,455,4.428571428571429
8002563,4,B0000TAYS4,"New Dominion Tank police is a six episode mini-series continuing adventures of the Tank Police. The character, Leona is fighting and arresting crooks on the streets of Newport. Newport City's mayor disapproves the use of tanks to fight crime. The police chief is angry about the destruction and lawsuits caused by the tanks. The department also goes up against high-tech hackers, a gang of bank robbers, terrorists, an evil corporation and a new deadly robotic tank which is both agile and powerful running rampant in Newport. There was a lot going on in the story but they flowed so well that it was easy to understand and follow. This series has good pacing and character development and this time the Tank Police did some actual police work and tried to solve crimes (something which was missing in the old series). In my review of the old Tank Police series I pointed out the fact that the use of tanks to fight crimes seemed silly to me, BUT this time since the New Dominion Tank Police faced greater threats, the use of tanks felt more justified. It evened the playfield when they went up against villains. The character designs look similar to the old series although some changed a bit and became less attractive and detailed; the Puma Sisters look thin and ugly. The animation quality was also a notch below fluid, but still good. I was very happy that the character named ""Buaka"" (from the old series) did not return in this new mini-series; because I hated that dope. There was a good balance of story and character development, everything was better fleshed out and contained good action sequences, which contributed to my overall enjoyment of this New Dominion Tank Police. I recommend it to anyone that enjoys action/comedy anime or police stories. Good for teens and adults. Ends on Episode six. I wish they would create more episodes and continue the series because it really made some big improvements over the old Tank Police. I also recommend the anime series called ""Daphne in The Brilliant Blue"".",1127001600,4,2017,4.815561959654179
8002564,4,B0000TAYS4,"The events set in New Domionion Tank Police anime seem to be after those in the Dominion: Tank Police manga.  The Puma sisters are living on the streets, Loena is fighting small time hoods and the Major wants to be reelected.  Right when you think things might get boring, there's a virtual drug for computers, terrorists are attacking the city and there are war robots, that look very much like ""Fuchikoma"" units from Ghost In The Shell, running about.
I like it, but it wasn't as good as the earlier Acts.  6 episodes, 180 minutes of action, but not much humor.  Extras include Tank Police Files, cool fold out poster, previews and fan club info.",1078272000,9,648,4.608695652173913

Here some info on the the DVD:
Newport City, 2010 - In a desperate attempt to stop the swelling tide of rampant crime and urban terrorism plaguing the city, the government forms a special task force - The Tank Police - with the firepower to combat the high-tech crime syndicates. Squad Leader Leona Ozaki, together with her radically modified tank Bonaparte, battles alongside her fellow officers to bring down the insidious Dai Nippon Gaiken Corporation which threatens to overwhelm the city with a new virtual drug. But with high explosive artillery at her disposal, can Newport City handle the destruction and chaos caused by her own defenders?
Japan's manga legend Masamune Shirow (Appleseed, Black Magic M-66, Ghost in the Shell) personally oversaw the production of this exciting series to ensure that the anime remained faithful to his original 1992 manga books. Shirow delivers a darkly comic vision of a future overrun with fast and furious mecha, cybernetically enhanced humans and rouge androids.
