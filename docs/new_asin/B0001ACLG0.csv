I also saw this when it came out and was disappointed with the  VHS copy (also probably pirated) which I saw later. Although the film initially portrays the dull urban existence of a struggling young family it quickly moves to attractively filmed 1970s style sequences which lead to the first of the ""secrets"" the various family members will become individually involved in during the one afternoon portrayed in the film. In this section a Swedish textiles millionaire appears to stalk Ms. Bissett through London in his Rolls Royce convertible but then after luring her to his car he fumbles through a sincere self introduction which is followed by a session of very honest and intimate conversation. This is followed by a very STEAMY romantic scene. Obviously what is going on is naughty but the conversation (particularly that of the Swedish gentleman) reveals character developement showing ""humanity"" that many viewers will be sympathetic to. The parts of the film in which Ms. Bissett has less involvement (the experiences of the the other family members on the day in question) are a little ""edgier"" and in one spot appear to be veering towards something quite objectionable (fortunately stopping in time).I did not find her husband to to be a character  one could warm up to. I certainly would not recomend watching his ""secret""to anyone who has to interview people for prospective employment. If you get the idea that I feel the movie was carried by the interaction between Ms. Bissett and the wealthy older man who comes out of the blue to pursue her you would be correct. On a totally different level I'd like to mention that for a sexy late 1970s style I don't think Ms. Bissett's ""look"" in this film has ever been topped. Interestingly, she balked at performing part of the closeup bedroom scenes and a stand in was used for part of this section. That must have later made for an unusual entry on someone else's resume! Although obviously done on a budget the film is far better than some other more well known and more expensively done Bissett movies like ""The Deep"".If a good copy of this film ever comes out it would definetely be worth a look! As this review (and the movie's alternate title which was adopted to sell more tickets at the box office) suggests this film is not for the prudish.",1280707200,,2391,4.7451923076923075
8126115,2,B0001ACLG0,"The film came in good time but it was an obviously pirated copy which had been made to look like a rental unit. The vendor likely purchased it in a lot and likely also didn't know that the copy was pirated. The cover of the case was well done but obviously faked. A search for the video rental store brought no result and it likely never existed. It played fine with a couple of dropouts due to it being a copy.

I love this movie. I first saw it on the big screen in 1979 and was impressed by the storyline. The sex scene was a big deal at the time but tame by some of today's standards.

It was released on a limited basis on VHS but never saw a release on any other media. Thus, original copies command prices in the $120 range. Finding a copy at less than $30 was a find that became a disappointment once the fact that it was a copy was ascertained.",1209772800,3,853,4.041420118343195
