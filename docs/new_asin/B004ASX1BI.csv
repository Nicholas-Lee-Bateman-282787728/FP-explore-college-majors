8420842,4,B004ASX1BI,"Fun memories of the old tv show.  Somehow, not as funny as I remember, but still fun to see it again.",1361577600,,101,3.8095238095238093
8420843,4,B004ASX1BI,"""The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis"" was a ground breaking satire on teenage life in the late 50s. Like many TV situation comedies of the period, it benefited from a superb ensemble cast including experienced actors like Frank Faylen who had a long and prolific career in supporting parts in films for years before hitting the big time here.

The set contains nine very good episodes, not from any particular series but rather a choice selection of some of the best. They are presented in unrestored but mostly adequate prints. Tuesday Weld as Thalia Menninger steals everything but the scenery and Warren Beatty appears in ""The Best Dressed Man"", one of the funniest of the episodes.

It is a pity that there are not better prints of these shows available. The package is basic, not really expensive but better than nothing.",1289865600,16,821,4.815602836879433
8420844,5,B004ASX1BI,"I was pleasantly surprised to receive this volume one dvd set of Dobie Gillis from my daughter for my birthday. I had no idea this show even existed on DVD. The episodes selected for this first volume were superb and just as hilarious and offbeat as I remember them. I enoyed it so much, I purchased the Volume Two set here on Amazon yesterday. Looking forward to that one arriving since it has even more episodes than Volume One. I can definitely recommend this set for any age group. Good clean wholesome fun....",1289174400,16,514,4.537634408602151
