7816642,1,6301801466,"What a colossal load of BS. If you want to know the real Calamity Jane, look up her obituary. She was a bedraggled alcoholic who got her reputation working as a camp follower with a unit of the US cavalry. Wild Bill Hickok wouldn't have known her if he tripped over her senseless body in an alley.",1501977600,,297,4.228070175438597
7816643,4,6301801466,"Jane Alexander really captures the role (she was nominated for an Emmy for it) and Frederic Forrest turns in a scene stealing performance as Wild Bill Hickok in this adaption of the real life story of the famous Calamity Martha Jane Canary.  The film picks up where she first meets Wild Bill, the love of her life, and follows her through her ups and downs of her life.  It is definitely worth a watch.  While it is a bit depressing she was one of our great pioneer figures of the west and Jane Alexander turns in a great performance.",1427846400,2,534,4.373737373737374

7816647,4,6301801466,Definitely not your Doris Day version of this historical figure.  Much darker and probably one of the most accurate portrayals of this lady o the West.,1401753600,2,151,4.8076923076923075
7816648,5,6301801466,I thought Jane Alexander did a great job of playing one of the west most famous cowgirl. This lady can do it all .,1375488000,,114,3.7916666666666665
