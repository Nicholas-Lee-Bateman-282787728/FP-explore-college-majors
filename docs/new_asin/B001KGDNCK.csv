8326537,4,B001KGDNCK,"Being a fan of Patrick McGoohan, I was aware of this film long ago, and have only been able to enjoy it through old taped copies.  When I saw it appear on DVD, I was delighted.  However, the ""if it's too good to be true..."" theory validated my skeptism when I saw that this particular version was formatted in color - as Amazon's description indicated.  There are two exact DVD's of this movie available through Amazon.  I couldn't differentiate between the two according to the product descriptions, so of course I went for the one that was supposed to the color version.  I guess it was referring to the on-screen menus, but I hope not because that would be purposely deceptive.  I'm hoping Amazon's format description was simply an error.",1238716800,5,741,4.661538461538462
