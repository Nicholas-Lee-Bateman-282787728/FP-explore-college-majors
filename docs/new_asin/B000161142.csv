8007114,5,B000161142,"One of the greatest legends of cinema brings four of the greatest stories to life in ""Charlton Heston presents The Bible,"" a powerful, soul-stirring epic! Heston reads from the stories of Genesis, Exodus, and the Four Gospels with great theatricality, telling them as they may have been told decades before they were written down. While his performances may be a little over the top, they fit this form of production perfectly.

Together with a mesmerizing orchestral soundtrack by Leonard Rosenman, powerful images, and visits to the places where these events may have actually happened, ""Charlton Heston presents The Bible"" belongs in everyone's collection of Biblical films and documentaries!
