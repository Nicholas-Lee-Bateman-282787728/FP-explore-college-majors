8515501,3,B007F1ER6K,"I paid over $30. for a discus for ""little people"".  First off, it took almost a month to get to me, and now I find that I can't watch it because it doesn't play on any DVD player on the North American Continent.  The first part of this screw-up is the sellers fault, but, I must admit, the second part is on me.  ""Region 2"" means nothing to me (forgive me - I'm 72 and all I knew was that I wanted to see the movie).  When you read the reviews, it doesn't say that the people writing them are from Europe, Africa, or basically anywhere but the United States and Canada.  Suffice to say that I will read EVERYTHING before I order something else from Amazon - period!  All I know is that I'm on a ""fixed income"" and I'm out over $30. and have not a damn thing to show for it.  By the way, the company I got it from is in New Jersey, which, when last I looked, was part of the United States.",1522281600,,888,3.955056179775281
