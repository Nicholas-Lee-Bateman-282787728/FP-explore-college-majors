8640418,4,B000B7HZ2I,"the main even featured two long time NHB\mma fighters Ken ""The world's most Dangerous man"" shamrock vs Mike ""The Rhino"" Bourke.  some fans complained that the shamrock fighting here was a mere shell of prime Ken shamrock of the 90's and yes he was not the same man as years past. their was not a big difference in age between them so I still give credit to Ken and Mike for fighting. the match started out as a stand up fight with I believe ken landing the first punch then Mike lands a low kick high on the right leg  while again taking a punch somewhere in the face. Rhino is knocked down but not out of the match and from their we see mostly scrambling for position from both guys  Mike uses his big weight advantage  during this ground work relentlessly trying for a single leg takedown. that single leg is what looked to injure shamrock's knee and allowed Bourke to open up with punches on the ground for the win via referee stoppage. his post match promo was short and sweet as Mike says "" it's my birthday I love you guys""",1495497600,,1029,4.288659793814433
