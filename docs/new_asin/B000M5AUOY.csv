2725592,5,B000M5AUOY,The first video that i got was no good. Would not play in any of our dvd players. The second one was mailed and works fine. Very good video on the basics of hand making a knife. Gave lots of details. Enjoyed it a lot.,1231200000,,217,3.8444444444444446
2725593,4,B000M5AUOY,This is a good DVD. It shows that almost anyone has the tools to make a good knife.,1229731200,5,83,3.6666666666666665
2725594,5,B000M5AUOY,I have had this production for a couple of years now.  Tim Lively show just how close a knife can be forged to the finished product with a home made anvil and an easy to make charcoal forge.  Even if you don't want to go the way of a primative knifesmith you can get a lot from watching the video.  This is something that you will want to watch often.  I get something out of it every time I view it.,1201305600,8,400,3.9012345679012346
2725595,5,B000M5AUOY,"I have this DVD as part of my reference library and I refer to it often.  This productions get you away from the idea that you have to have a collection of expensive tools to make knives.  Tim Lively uses improvised anvils that can be obtained in a scrap yard and shows how to build a charcoal burning forge from item that can be obtained from a hardware store.  The hammer technique is fantastic; you can actually see the blade bevels form under his hammer.  Even if you don't want to go 100% primative, there is much to learn from this DVD.",1180137600,13,542,4.284313725490196
2725596,5,B000M5AUOY,This is a great video for the beginning or intermediate knifemaker looking to get into bladesmithing without spending a ton of money on tools and equipment.  Mr Lively does a excellent job explaining how to make a practical small forge and how to make a knife from start to finish.  A helpful resource for any bladesmith.,1175731200,7,321,4.714285714285714
2725597,5,B000M5AUOY,This video is outstanding. It gives excellent details on every thing from the very beginning to the end. This video is a must have for anyone interested in making their own knives the old fashion way without all of the expensive power tools.,1172188800,6,241,4.627906976744186
2725598,5,B000M5AUOY,This video was perfect for me. I didn't know anything about making knifes. This DVD was easy to follow and fun to watch. Knifemaking takes a lot of work but Tim and Marian made it look so simple. I would recommend this video to anyone that is on a budget and wants to start making knifes. They really know how to stretch their resources. Thank you for making such a helpful DVD!,1170288000,22,378,4.263888888888889
2725599,5,B000M5AUOY,"There are alot of knifemaking videos and DVD's on the market right now.  Many of them are very specialized and geared towards people with alot of the equipment you will already need.  This DVD is perfect for people who may just be starting out, with very little if any tooling.  Most everything that is used in the DVD is available locally.  I don't hesitate to recommend this to any one interested in making knives or just interested in understanding the process of what goes into making a knife.",1167782400,33,497,4.613636363636363
2725600,5,B000M5AUOY,"Tim's and Marian's video isn't for everyone.  If you're looking for a video on modern knifemaking techniques using air-hardening tool steel, multi-thousand dollar belt sanders, digitally controlled electric heat treating ovens, salt bath quenches, micarta handles, kydex sheaths, and all the other high-tech bells and whistles, this isn't the video you're looking for.  But if the idea of making knives like our ancestors made them for thousands of years -- just you, a hammer, an anvil, a fire, a pair of tongs (optional, depending on the length of your stock) and a chunk of iron -- appeals to you, YOU NEED THIS VIDEO.  Tim Lively makes art with sharp edges, and he does it with no power tools, on a shoestring budget.  By the time you've finished the video, you'll believe that you can, too.  And you know what?  You can.

In the interest of full disclosure, I probably should add that Tim was kind enough to give me a copy of the video a few months ago.  I'm working on knives numbers three, four and five right now!",1167177600,37,1021,4.664804469273743

2725603,2,B000M5AUOY,Not the greatest video. Much better content is available free on YouTube.,1459296000,,73,5.166666666666667
2725604,5,B000M5AUOY,"This is an excellent, well-produced video that takes you step-by-step through Tim Lively's primitive method for making knives, using scrap metal from old leaf springs (made of 5160 steel).  Tim shows how the knifemaking process can be simplified thereby greatly reducing the cost.  He uses scrap materials and adobe to build a simple forge and an old hand crank blower to control the flow of air.  His fuel is a homemade charcoal.  If you are interested in knifemaking, but do not have a lot of money to spend, this video will offer you low-cost alternatives to using costly equipment such as expensive anvils, forges, and grinders.  I highly recommend it for both its educational and entertainment value.",1459296000,2,705,4.9914529914529915
2725605,2,B000M5AUOY,"Not at all what I expected. I was not interested in finding out how to make a knife that was that crude. The ingenuity the people was impressive, but was not what I was looking for.",1456012800,,181,4.055555555555555

2725607,1,B000M5AUOY,I'm not going to rent this after seeing some garbage where there should have been a trailer.  They told me for close to a minute to not copy the video and then showed a few seconds of a street in the ghetto.  I wanted a peek into the video or at least a brief description of what's in it.

2725616,3,B000M5AUOY,It is very slow to say the least. Great info but it drags on and on.,1420329600,,68,3.3125
2725617,4,B000M5AUOY,"Some great info for making blades, forges, etc from primitive material and scrap.  There is a lot of footage of the guy pounding on metal...could use some good time lapse edits.  Audio is poor at times.  Some serious rock n roll during some forging scenes...I liked that.",1413676800,,271,4.723404255319149

2725619,5,B000M5AUOY,"Simple and comprehensive, this a great video for the backyard blacksmiting initiate. Lots of info, clear views of the work while it is being performed, and it takes you literally from cutting the raw blade material all the way through to the handle and even a sheath. This guy uses no electricity at all, and offers lots of tips on how to build a forge and get air to it for a relatively low cost.",1408665600,2,397,4.306666666666667

All this with absolutely no electricity! If you're considering knife making as a hobby but don't want to spend thousands on belt-grinders, full-sized anvils, and buffing machines then this video is for you!",1403481600,,373,5.131147540983607
2725622,3,B000M5AUOY,I was quite pleased with the information contained in the dvd but the show needed a lot of polish and the background music was distracting.,1401753600,,139,4.6
2725623,5,B000M5AUOY,"There is not a better primitive blacksmithing video around that I know of.  Tim and Marian do it right, with basic simply steps.  You will be amazed to watch a old auto leaf spring transformed into an extremely fine bowie knife.  they cover everything from was charcoal making, to tempering and finishing.

2725625,5,B000M5AUOY,Tim Lively does an amazing job with this DVD.  His wife did a great job with the decrative touches to the handle,1386374400,,112,4.090909090909091
2725626,5,B000M5AUOY,This is a must have for any novice/beginner blade smith. Not only does this guy know what he is doing but he makes it easy and affordable. This is a portal to your ability to start NOW. If you watch this and follow the instructions you can start making HIGH quality blades in a couple days with almost no start up cost. I can't recommend this more. Just buy it.,1384819200,2,361,4.171428571428572
2725627,3,B000M5AUOY,"The video quality was fine. Production quality was very good and the 'presenter' was interesting to listen to. Unfortunately, the technical content presented is simply very, very basic. As a new blacksmith, I probably had unreasonably high expectations; however, upon review of the video description, I got exactly what it describes and no more so I really cannot complain too much.",1381708800,,382,5.278688524590164
2725628,3,B000M5AUOY,i reccomend this  for people who want to get into knifemasking inexpensively and quickly.  I rated it because it shows a good overview without being to dertailed,1379721600,,161,4.925925925925926
2725629,5,B000M5AUOY,"The delivery came early and I watched it right when I got it.  The Lively team delivered exactly what they advertised and I am very pleased.  I believe that Tim is extremely educated in the field of metallurgy and goes over in the simplest of format for the audience to comprehend.  Marian is also extremely knowledgable and easy to understand, however I did have to make do with a couple of alternative tools that I did not have for the type of metal working that she was doing.  All in all I have enjoyed this process and have only good things to say about the video.  The only constructive criticism that I have is that the video could have been shortened by not showing so much of the heating and hammering but rather talking with a little more information while it was happening, however the music in the background during the process worked with a similar effect.",1368403200,2,869,4.509554140127388

Everything they are doing I can accomplish with a cheap hand held portable torch and a few simple hand tools!! If you want to make a simple project into a complex one do it there way!

2725632,5,B000M5AUOY,"Goes over pretty much everything need for the basic forging of knives or any blade actually.
Some parts go by a little fast, but simply just replay that part to get a full understanding of what's going on.
Personally it seems like info is purposely left out, more of a ""go out and figure it out for yourself"" type gist to it.
Overall very informational and good for any beginner bladesmiths.",1361750400,,391,4.52112676056338
2725633,4,B000M5AUOY,only thing to advise of. . . this is the making of one knife only .  it is informative tho. the knifemakers seem cool.,1361232000,,118,3.9166666666666665
2725634,4,B000M5AUOY,you can read a lot of books on the subject but it sure helps to see a video..... great demo,1357344000,,91,3.6

2725636,5,B000M5AUOY,"This video is priceless to anyone wishing to get into knife making.  I'm new to making knives but have invested quite a bit of time and money in tools and literature.  This video on it's own gave me more information and actual knowledge than everything else combined.  In my opinion this is about as good a video as one could wish for on the subject.  My personal preferences so far have leaned toward the ""stock removal"" technique.  This video covers the opposite end of the spectrum actually showing you how to turn a flat piece of leaf spring into a finished knife.  Although I am no Blacksmith the information in this video covers many topics that would be extremely beneficial to both schools of thought.  You get pretty much everything from making of a mini charcoal forge to cutting and hammering techniques.  Also, Mr. Lively and his wife cover how to make your own fuel and the finishing touches and sheath making.  I would've bought the movie for that part alone!  So many knife makers concentrate only on the steel and let someone else show you how to do the handles and sheaths.  Trust me when I say the only disappointment you will get from this video is when you try to search Livelyknives.com and realize that the man has ""thrown in the towel"" and retired.  I haven't yet watched them all but if knife making is a topic you're in to then this video will not disappoint.",1355356800,,1384,4.536290322580645

2725638,5,B000M5AUOY,this dvd is a jewel to have!! if you are inerested in sharpening your blacksmith skills or learn how to blacksmith in general this dvd is a must have. i started blacksmithing as a simple fun hobby and i wanted to get better so i purchased this dvd and learned a lot and the next time i fired the forge up again i appplied what i learned and it works!!,1346803200,,351,4.0285714285714285
2725639,5,B000M5AUOY,A great movie for a beginning knife maker.  Currently I forge all my knives with mesquite charcoal and a homemade forge.  It has a tewier similar to the forge that is used in the movie.  The patience that Tim Lively shows in his forging is difficult to teach.  I have had this movie for a while and enjoy it just as much now as when I first bought it.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is beginning or would like to get closer to the craft.,1322956800,,443,4.045977011494253
2725640,5,B000M5AUOY,"I had watched this video years ago when a friend lent it to me for viewing so I pretty much knew what I was getting into. This vid was professionally produced so no ""B"" movie type presentation here. This is a nice resource for those who enjoy knifemaking in general and even more so for those wanting to try knifemaking without spending a fortune for tools and materials. Great for anyone interested in making ""Tribal"" type knives without the use of electricity and/or power tools.

This video contains a ""bonus"" in that you are shown how to do some basic sand casting to make a guard for the knife.

I highly recommend this video to anyone that has an interest in the topics covered. And the $20 price tag is a bargain no matter how you look at it.

Purchase a copy and support Tim Lively and his wife Marian. I'm not sure they ever actually made money selling this video due to the high production costs (read: high quality video) required to make it. Shell out the bucks and support a couple of great people.",1310083200,,1011,4.424731182795699

The only minus is that the DVD doesn't play in some players. It's a mastering issue I imagine and, to be fair, I haven't contacted the authors to find out if that's a standard problem or a glitch on just my copy.

2725645,5,B000M5AUOY,"Brilliant, simple, and cost-effective!!!...
If like me, you like the art of forging a blade, but don't have the skills or the money to do so, this video was custom made for you.
Mind, this is all done the ""old way"", no power tools- which in my opinion is something good since most of the material around provided by other authors require more expensive material.
The idea on how to make a portable forge can save you a few hundreds of dollars (the blower shouldn't be too easy to find outside of the U.S, i believe- but other alternatives are always possible).

Thank you guys for such a remarkable work.

PS: keep in mind, though, that if you already have some equipment(e.g. forge), you may find this video a bit basic- anyway, it is all about going back to the basis- no electricity.",1283817600,2,786,4.489510489510489

2725648,5,B000M5AUOY,"This video is an outstanding tutorial in low-tech bladesmithing.  I've seen dozens of instructional videos on knife making and this one is still by far my favorite!  Mr. Lively shows how easy it is to get started with a forge and making functional knives at minimal expense.  It's easy to get distracted by all the equipment you 'need' to get started.  As a leader in the Neo-Primative smithing community, he ignores all that and starts you off with a fire in a hole in the ground powered by a hairdryer and some iron pipe, a flat surface to hammer on, a hammer, pliers or tongs, a file and some sand paper.  Those and some metal to work with and you're ready to get started.  His technique is excellent, and his philosophy if simple.

I highly recommend this video to the beginning and experienced smith alike.  Everytime I watch it, I'm reminded of something I forgot or notice something new.  I'm confident you'll enjoy it as much as I have.",1256515200,4,944,4.538461538461538
2725649,5,B000M5AUOY,"This video provides an excellent overview of the process of taking a chunk of steel (springs from a 60's vintage car or truck, if I recall correctly) and transforming it into a well made knife blade using only hand tools and a homemade forge.  It is not a stand alone instructional video, but does provide an easy to understand step-by-step narrative of the process of shaping, heat treating, and other aspects of fabricating a knife (including handle and sheath).  I'd highly recommend this for anyone interested in getting involved in knifemaking, as much (if not more so) because of how it demystifies the process and shows how easily it can be done as for its instructional content (which is quite good).",1254700800,6,708,4.8429752066115705

8166505,3,B000M5AUOY,"This is a good video of hammering out a nice knife. However, it seems like it is done almost in real time. So you are watching a lot of hammering, hammering, hammering. Which is what it takes to make a knife, but speeding up some of the film or reducing some scenes would make it less monotonous. I bought this for students to watch, but I doubt that there is anyway that they would make it through it.",1466035200,,402,4.166666666666667
