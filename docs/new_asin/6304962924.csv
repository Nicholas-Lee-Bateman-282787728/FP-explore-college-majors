8576039,5,6304962924,The 75/76 Big Red Machine is probably the greatest team ever to play the game. It's unbelieveable that all that is remembered from that series is the Fisk home run...Morgan hit one that was more important than that the next night... You guys got your Fisk highlight... we got the Ring!!!,1138147200,,287,4.647058823529412
8576040,5,6304962924,"The 6th game of the 1975 World Series may well be the most famous ballgame ever played.  The image of Carlton Fisk's 12th inning home run off the Fenway Park foul pole -- winning the game for Boston after 4 long hours, and tying the best-of-7 series at 3 games apiece -- is indelible in US pop culture.  Remember ""Good Will Hunting""?
The most famous image from this game is of Fisk leaping up and down in front of home plate, waving urgently at the ball to stay fair.  So it may surprise anyone who's not seen the game, to note that Fisk's legendary ""body English"" doesn't appear in the NBC telecast!  We see the game-winning ball soar into the night, and we hear the Fenway Park organist play ""Hallelujah"" (imagine if this game were played today... we'd hear ""Who Let The Dogs Out?""... sheesh!).  But Fisk's arm-pumping exists only on highlight videos and baseball documentaries.
The rest of Game 6 is well worth owning.  Luis Tiant's bizarre, twisting pitching motion is on display here.  So is Fred Lynn banging into the Fenway Park wall and falling flat.  And Bernie Carbo's dramatic 3-run pinch-HR in the the 8th inning, which tied the game and set up the Fisk shot.  And Dwight Evan's game-saving outfield defense.
From inning 1 to 12, Game Six has it all for avid baseball watchers.  It's so good, you'll even forget who actually won the Series.  History prefers to end with this game.  Hallelujah.",996105600,2,1405,4.620967741935484
