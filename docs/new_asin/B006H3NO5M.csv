4988347,4,B006H3NO5M,"Justin Russell's The Sleeper was a great film and I really loved it. It was well directed, well thought out and well made. It's super rare these days because a lot of people love using ""grindhouse"" type of films as an excuse to make stupid movies badly by saying ""They're suppose to be dumb"". But Russell isn't just trying to make a throwback to the classic slasher but also trying to make a good film and it shows. He has a clear vision of what he wanted this film to be and does his best to really create it. This film, unlike most of the throwback films or modern slasher films, is actually pretty suspenseful and really keeps you interested. Most films are too interested in the campy side of the slasher films (like hatchet and others) and forget that they can also be scary. I loved the score for the film and really made the film stick out. Most slasher fans will be familiar with the story concept but Russell really makes it his own so it didn't just seem like he was copying 100% instead he took a simple slasher concept from the 80's and told it his way. The film was shot on a super low budget but looks better then most films out there. He was able to tell a period piece and not for a lot of money. Great way to use what you have. I thought the acting was actually pretty good in this film. something again, rare in films made for the money he had. It's really inspiring for me as a film lover and a film maker. Films like this make me happy to love indie horror.",1328400000,20,1477,4.185964912280702
4988348,2,B006H3NO5M,"This production has all the look, feel and quality of an 80's slasher film. It takes place during those obscure years tucked in between disco and Big Hair bands. America was still recovering from the shock of having elected an actor as President, an actor I would say was far better than any that appeared in this roughly edited film.

The movie uses the ""killer's point of view"" technique which means they jerk the camera around during some of the scenes, but they don't use the technique effectively. There was no character build-up and while we saw the killer, they didn't drop clues as to why he was knocking off the girls.? What was that line dance thing? And did we have to see the whole thing? Sex and shower scenes with no nudity and they dare to compare it to an 80's slasher film. It falls short of an 80's style slasher. Roger Corman laughs in your face.

4988349,5,B006H3NO5M,"The Sleeper is an excellent taste for classic horror.  Between the artistic camera work and the classic heart pounding music score, this is a true masterpiece.  I would recomend this to anyone who has a love for Halloween and Black Christmas.  It is nice to see a movie with the classical scare tactics that puts you on the edge of your seat and not just another ""hack em up"" movie they classify horror movies today as. Highly Recommended!  Wish I could have seen it on the big screen.",1328227200,2,485,4.4772727272727275
4988350,5,B006H3NO5M,"The Sleeper is super fun for horror fans and even those not so big on the genre too- it has plenty of gore and great effects, plenty of cute eye-candy girls for the guys, a wealth of suspense, and enough comic relief in the dialogue and characters to entertain you all the way through. I say watch it in a group, because it's always fun to have people screaming at the actors and actresses.. ""DONT GO IN THERE!! WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT!!"" etc etc... and this movie is FULL of those moments.  Justin Russell gets great shots, too, for those into cinematography. Many frames are frame-able..ha, I can't say much else without spoiling the movie. ..",1328140800,,643,4.495726495726496
4988351,4,B006H3NO5M,"I ordered the limited box set with the VHS directly from the company and it came in the mail the day of it's release. The packaging is supposed to resemble a 'big box' VHS although only slightly larger than a DVD case. The size seems to be a problem with a lot of the companies doing retro releases on VHS. Camp put out The Basement which was the right height and thickness and too wide so it stuck out an inch past the rest of the tapes. Mondo put out Things which was way taller than any other clamshell case. This one is smaller than regular big boxes but at least fits on a regular shelf with the rest of your tapes and the spine blends in nicely with the rest.
The tape itself is red with a faux '50c charge if not returned rewound' sticker for added touch. The intro FBI warning and rating look just like the real thing and the movie itself has the look and feel of a genuine 80's VHS pretty close. Another nice touch is one of the fliers the girls are passing out is also included with the set so for the price it's definitely worth it if you're into VHS.
Now for the movie itself, I liked the movie a lot. It's not the greatest movie in the world, but neither were movies it's paying homage to. The dark and shaky camera work has a pretty good feel and looks authentic. The grain is right too, it's just enough and doesn't overdo it like the Grindhouse movies did. The score is great and I was happy to watch a new movie with a real score instead of just shoving random bands in anywhere they could. The only thing that bothered me was the fashion, the clothes didn't really scream 80's to me and the eyebrows most of all looked too thin and modern, which is really a small gripe in the grand scheme lol. And a HUGE plus for me was the cameo by JOE BOB BRIGGS! I grew up on Monster Vision on TNT so I was very happy to see him.
This is a really good movie and well worth the asking price. It doesn't feel like a gimmick, more like a real homage by someone who loves the genre. Buy it, and if you can, get your hands on the combo set",1328054400,,2040,4.064516129032258
4988352,2,B006H3NO5M,"This is intended to be a fake 80's slasher pic in much the same way that Ti West's House of the Devil was a fake early 80's horror pic.  Unfortunately writer/director Justin Russell doesn't have the eye for detail that West has, so it's not likely that anyone would ever confuse The Sleeper with the real thing.  Russell does get a couple of things right--the movie looks very dark like an early 80's cheapie along the lines of Don't Answer the Phone (one obvious inspiration even though it's not actually a very good film) and Night School.  The synth soundtrack by Gremlin (which is probably meant as a parody of Goblin, a band that did a lot of horror soundtracks in the 70's and 80's) also sounds about right.  Unfortunately, The Sleeper pretty much gets everything else wrong.  First there is the nudity--almost none.  Early in the film there is a sex scene and a shower scene which are both shot carefully to show no actual nudity.  This coyness with naked skin is a dead giveaway that this isn't a real 80's horror flick--the classic slasher pics included nudity pretty freely.  When I was a young teen and saw those movies in the theater that was part of the appeal--you got to see a lot of naked breasts along with the gore.  Then there's the hair.  There's no feathered hair or signs of blow drying or hair spray or hair gel--in short none of the actors has a hairstyle that you were likely to see in the 80's.  Then there's the period detail--other than an occasional shot of a cassette player or an old TV there really is none.  Then there's the fact that director Russell shows his killer's face early in the movie and shows it often after that.  Unless you're talking about a masked killer movie like Halloween or Friday the 13th a real 80's slasher movie would not show the face of the killer until the end of the film, and maybe not even then.  That's a really big no-no because you generally don't know who the killer is in these films and usually there is at least one red herring character who might be the killer but isn't.  So The Sleeper never actually comes close to working as a fake 80's movie the way the far superior House of the Devil does.  Taken as a homage to 80's horror or just as a slasher pic it still isn't all that good.  There's not much suspense and minimal gore which tends to look more fake that it needs to, as if the filmmaker was more concerned with getting a campy laugh than in filming a good gore sequence.  The makers of this film probably could have gotten 80's make-up artist Tom Savini for a six pack of beer and a pizza--I've seen him at horror conventions selling off his laserdisc collection and signing autographs, so if the filmmakers had wanted gore that looked like something you would have seen in a good 80's slasher pic they certainly could have gotten it.  But The Sleeper doesn't even really aspire to be a good 80's style horror film--quality-wise it feels like something that might have been put out by Crown International (like, say, Don't Answer the Phone).  I'm sure some people will enjoy this but as someone who grew up watching real 80's slasher pics I was disappointed.",1327968000,5,3141,4.486818980667838

4988360,1,B006H3NO5M,"This movie does not look like it takes place in the 80's. The first few minutes I realized this....the shaky camera, the look of the girls were just some of the obvious giveaways.  I actually rented it because I thought it was an 80's slasher and right away I could tell. How could the director be so incompetent,  to not know they did not shake the camera like that until many years later?  The House of the Devil is what this movie tried to do and couldn't come close. Watch House of the devil, that is not only a great movie but really looks like it was made, and takes place during the early 80's.
This film  seems like a home movie made in the 2000s'.

4988361,1,B006H3NO5M,"I was suckered in again by all the high ratings and watched this movie slowly deteriorate before my eyes. I was kind of impressed by the way this movie starts out and by the bold attempts at shocking closeups of facial and head attacks with its limited special effects budget. The look and feel of the retro 1981 film stock was a good match for that era. The story was not as well thought out nor did they do any reserch on Police Dept protocols or internal medicine. Again, I started out liking this movie, but it didn't take long before i started to chuckle at the killer, students , den mother and the detective for their actions and their correct dialogue (seriously, no I really mean seriously) that doesn't show up for at least another decade and a half. The production was not bad across the board, but the story, direction and the acting all needed a little to a lot of help. The killer and the victims looked staged for their attack scenes and you could see either the killers shadow or reflection from an angle the victim can see and could have reacted to the attacker. The victims do little to try and escape the evil clutches of the killer or to fight back and the attacks are way to short for the method being used in some scenes. The cast will act afraid when there is no cause for alarm and not when there is cause for alarm? The detective was my next big problem. He tells a girl who has been threatened to walk unescorted from her dorm to his location??? He arrives in a squad car??? Detectives rarely if ever use them. He again asks the girl to go and find a phone that works to call for backup unescorted nor does he use the radio in his squad car??? He doesn't wait for backup to go after the bad guy??? There is a song that is playing in the bar that sings about vinyl records, cassettes tapes and cd's, but according to Wikipedia cd's don't go on sale commercially until 1982. There was just way to many things that bugged me about this production and its high ratings that mislead me into thinkig I was going to watch a really well made horror flick NOT!!! I will give it 1.7 stars for trying to be a good movie. Was it worth  the time? Only if you don't set your sights higher than so...so

4988362,4,B006H3NO5M,This is the best example to an 80s movie being made this generation. It's almost spot on the entire time as feeling like an 80s  movie. This I think is Justin Russels second best movie first being the Gremlin (funniest movie ever). Yes you can see that this movie was made on a micro budget but it's so well done and put together that you barely notice it. Atmosphere is also fantastic in this movie. Acting is ok but nothing special. Let's just say I've seen worse actors. Overall this is a very awesome slow burn slasher throwback that you should check out if your into that sort of thing.,1369353600,2,591,4.372727272727273
4988363,2,B006H3NO5M,"Imagine if you will an oddly deserted college campus. The student body largely absent despite the looming spectre of finals. The laws of physics distorted at the quantum level allowing a man to be two and perhaps even three places at once. A dance routine destine to drive the viewer mad. A killer at once both blind from cataracts and able to whine at 85 decibels. You've entered, The Sleeper Zone.
She said, killers come and killers go, whatever ya gonna do about it that's what I'd like to know.

The film trembled on the verge of being good and the actor chosen to play the killer combined with a director who knows next to nothing about disturbing the viewer just tripped it up from the get go.",1368144000,,699,4.4609375
4988364,4,B006H3NO5M,"I commend the director for producing such a slick flick with an obviously limited budget. The camera work is excellent. This is no 'Satan's Little Helper' when it comes to how professional the shots and sets look. The score give the movie another leg-up. A throwback to the electronic single-note tunes that made movies like 'Halloween'. Acting in the movie was sub-par, but that's to be expected, and the people did an okay job with a reasonably bare-bones script. Not much of a plot or back story to this slasher, but the killer is cool enough, wielding a claw hammer and whispering into a rotary phone. The kills were simple, at times a little hokey, but all practical. No CGI blood splashes in sight.

All in all, it's a four. Don't go in expecting anything more than a throwback to cheap 80s slashers like 'Girls Nite Out' and 'Night School', and you won't be disappointed. I look forward to the director making another slasher movie. The great artwork on the case is a bonus!",1365465600,,981,4.637931034482759
4988365,1,B006H3NO5M,"After reading comparisons to The House of the Devil, which gave you that nostalgic feel pretty spot on in my opinion, I was excited to watch The Sleeper.  Boy, was I disappointed.  Nothing about this movie made me feel that it took place in the late 70's/early 80's except for the oh-so-desperate basketball & (really bad) disco cheesefests that occur within the movie as a reminder that the horrible acting and lame script are okay because it's supposed to be an ""homage"". No, don't let the shiny disco ball, tube socks, and countless rotary phones fool you: this movie just sucks.  The killer giggles/cries/whimpers like a hyena throughout half of the movie, and the acting in every single frame was beyond horrible.  And for a college sorority, these are some of the ugliest girls I've ever seen, who happen to live at the most abandoned college in America (why do we never see any other students walking around this campus?!).  On top of that, no twist ending, no reward for sitting through the entire mess, just a predictable clip that you've already seen in a million other serial-killer-on-the-telephone movies. The one positive thing about The Sleeper: it was impossible not to laugh at how horrible this movie was, so that was fun. To sum it up: unless you want to waste some good money and valuable time, skip this movie.
P.S.> I absolutely love Slumber Party Massacre. The Sleeper deserves no comparison to such a classic.",1362700800,3,1433,4.808943089430894

It was probably a good little movie for back in the day but with all the technology and special effects of today, it doesn't stand up. Watch it when you are not tired because it is a good dose of sleeping medicine. Put this in and you will not need any over the counter sleeping meds.",1357948800,,383,3.987012987012987

4988368,4,B006H3NO5M,"Even though the film was basically a tribute/ripoff of 'Black Christmas', I enjoyed the effort that went into making this film look retro and follow the 80""s slasher format.  The only times the movie lost the 80's feel, was when the handheld cameras would follow the actors while they were having dialogue, like an MTV film, where as in most 80"" films, still shots were used most of the time when the actors were speaking, and it was noticeable to me.  Good movie overall, and can't wait for more like this.",1356480000,,507,4.56043956043956
4988369,1,B006H3NO5M,"These are girls? Not for the last decade or so. And where are the boobs? If you're gonna have a slasher (or, in this case, a hammer) flick, well, you need boobs. It's the law. Yes, there are boobs. Two to be specific. On screen for a few seconds somewhere in the middle if I recall correctly. The plot? Guy with hammer does some, ahem, home improvement by eliminating several sorority sisters. We see his face early on, so there's no mystery there. And it's mostly scene after scene of terrified girl staggering backwards before the hammer falls. Whoever came up with this must have a hole in their head.

The Sleeper is basically Black Christmas, the original, with a few gory kills. The first kill had me worried because it was done so poorly. The Sleeper (his nickname) hits a girl in the face & it caves in, the second kill didn't make much sense either. Aside from the decent gore, the killer did a good job. His face was never hidden & he looked like one of hundred of maniac's you'd see in an 80's horror flick. A reviewer pointed out some other slasher films he looks like he was from. While I agree those aren't the best slashers, this guy does a better job. Highly recommend this if you're a fan of 80's slashers, this looks like it came out in 1982.",1350345600,2,798,4.291390728476821
4988371,5,B006H3NO5M,"I will be the first to say that I am a sucker for 80s slasher flicks. I especially like the ones from the early 80s. I was born in 1974 so I have been there from the beginning. I heard about this film from Amazon, while searching for something to watch. I saw this a read how it was a homage to the 80s. I figured why not give it a try. It hit that time period right on the head. This is not a movie that takes place in 80s, no this is a movie with the feel of the 1980s. From the clothes to the cars and music. The story is pretty good too. The killings are similar to the killings in the ""Slumber Party Massacre"", but just a little more gory than what they would have been if this was filmed in the 80s. I think it's just that fake blood must just look better.",1350086400,,762,3.829113924050633
4988372,4,B006H3NO5M,"When you watch a movie like ""The Sleeper"", you don't go in with high expectations. Since I love horror films I thought I'd give this one a chance. I'm sure glad I did. I thought it was entertaining from beginning to end, with some legitimately tense scare scenes. The characters were mostly likeable and the acting was good for a movie like this one. The final girl in the film (Amy) was a cute girl-next-door type that you couldn't help rooting for.

The movie is set up to look like a lost film from the early 1980s. I think it did a great job accomplishing that look and feel. Actually, it tricked me until I looked for more information about it on the Internet. It reminded me of the original ""Black Christmas"" and ""Prom Night"" movies. I think it was actually better than ""Black Christmas"" and on par with ""Prom Night"". My favorite scene was actually a fun disco dancing sequence that came out of nowhere and made me smile from ear to ear.

My only complaint is that we never get full closure for two of the characters in the movie. The audience probably should assume that one of the girls and one of the guys has been murdered like the others, but we never see their bodies or a clear attack. That kind of left me wondering what happened to them, especially since these were two of the more memorable characters in the story. That's a minor complaint though, since they have been most likely killed by the Sleeper.

If you like slasher movies from the late 70s/early 80s, you will most likely enjoy this movie. It will bring back a lot of memories and make you miss those simpler times in horror.",1348704000,,1602,4.423728813559322
4988373,1,B006H3NO5M,"As a fan-- a huge fan-- of Ti West's superb 2009 old-school Horror flick, The House Of The Devil, I bought the similarly-promoted early 1980s Slasher homage, The Sleeper, without having seen it first, solely on the basis of the DVD's packaging, its online trailer and a small number of glowing reviews I'd stumbled across online. Big mistake.

As an homage to low-budget, early 1980s Slasher flicks, The Sleeper seems to be more in tune with some of the more forgettable, less successful efforts of that era, (Graduation Day, The Dorm That Dripped Blood, Girls Nite Out-- all tedious, none of which I've been able to sit through more than once). The Sleeper's not suspenseful, not scary-- though it does make an effort to be violently disgusting, with special makeup effects that seem to utilize grape jelly for gore-- and is utterly devoid of character/style, or the requisite creepy atmosphere which made so many of the otherwise muddled or underwhelming Slashers of the era far more compelling than they would have otherwise been (Prom Night, He Knows You're Alone, Curtains).

The film's visual style doesn't exactly do a great job mimicking the early '80s Slashers, either. Instead, The Sleeper's shot much like any other low-budget indy flick today, overloaded with one- and two-shot closeups delivered via handheld camera, which can't seem to remain still for more than a second or two. That's not 'early '80s' at all. Back then, even low-budget exploitation filmmakers had enough respect for the medium to use tripods, dollies and the occasional Steadicam. Quivering hand-held shots were few and far between. If this film could've just bothered to try and achieve an early '80s visual style with its cinematography, I'd be a bit more generous with my review here, but...no. It never really came close to resembling anything actually shot in the era-- and if the movie's going to compare itself favorably to House Of The Devil, as this DVD does on its packaging, it'd better deliver on the expectation. It does not.

That said, stylistic homage failures aside, this movie doesn't even succeed as a Horror flick in its own right. Some reviewers like to point out the 'bad acting', but come on, isn't that sort of expected when one checks out a low-budget Horror flick like this? Some point out 'characters behaving stupidly' as a reason this movie doesn't work. Again, that's typical of the Slasher genre, particularly from the early '80s. Neither of these complaints resonate with me as to why I so disliked The Sleeper. The script and the direction were to blame for that.

The entire production just felt extremely flat in the areas of atmosphere, suspense and scares, and severely lacking in passion on the part of the filmmakers. I've heard some defenders excusing The Sleeper's shortcomings by citing its supposed $30,000 budget. I don't buy that at all; thirty grand is plenty for a filmmaker with talent and imagination, regardless of genre (El Mariachi at a cost of $7000, for example).

Don't get me wrong. I wanted to love this movie-- I wouldn't have taken a chance with a purchase if I hadn't-- but it just did...not...work. I've reversed my opinion on Slasher flicks of dubious merit in the past, with movies I really hated on first viewing which I later grew to love, each for its own unique attributes (The Burning, Final Exam). When it comes to low-budget Horror, I'm one of those longtime genre fans who can find a silver lining in just about any Z-grade cinematic cloud, but I don't see that happening with this wannabe Slasher flick. It's not only inept, but alternately grating and dull.

I should have read a few more reviews before forking over my hard-earned cash.",1336521600,8,3694,4.9024
4988374,3,B006H3NO5M,"Don't get me wrong, this movie does a great job at imitating all the wonderful 80's slashers. If that was the main goal they definitely achieved it. I'm a fan of slashers from that time period and have watched almost all of them I'm sure and everybody knows they can suffer from being slow and somewhat boring at times, and this is what The Sleeper suffers from. Overall though, the death scenes are well done, but the acting is choppy with a couple of the guys being downright terrible, and the characters are hard to connect with.

Bottom line is that while yes, it's a very accurate throwback 80's slasher, it's still just an OK movie.",1336348800,,638,4.5

It fondly brings back memories of Halloween, Prom Night, Black Christmas, He Knows You're Alone, The Prowler, and Terror Train.  It even has aspects of two favorite guilty pleasures...Slumber Party Massacre and Sorority House Massacre.  There's a large house, a killer on the loose, and people in peril.

4988378,2,B006H3NO5M,"I love 80's slasher films and when I heard of ""The Sleeper"" being a throwback to those days, it instantly grabbed my attention.  I couldn't wait to pop this film into my DVD player but upon viewing it was definitely a let down.  The acting was bad, didn't care for the way it was filmed and the concept and look of the killer could have been done much better.  Some of the killings were a bit gruesome but looked totally generic.  This film is no doubt a rip off of ""The House on Sorority Row"" and ""Black Christmas"".  Not even worth watching, a total disappointment.",1335052800,3,566,4.352380952380952
4988379,5,B006H3NO5M,"I went into this movie not knowing very much. I just knew it was an 80's homage film that was shot very independently in Ohio. I bought ""The Sleeper"" two weeks after it was released.

The director Justin Russell captured everything that was so perfect from 80's horror. Everything from the opening score, the look, and atmosphere. Bravo Mr. Russell.

It's 1981 and the girls of Alpha Gamma Theta sorority are having a party, but an unexpected guest is watching the girls every move. Peering through windows, to even sneaking into the sorority house. This movie definitely pays tribute to the original Black Christmas, John Carpenter's Halloween, Prom Night(dance scene in ""The Sleeper"" = AWESOME) and The House On Sorority Row. I loved this movie. I really got what Justin Russell did here. It is very obvious that he is a HUGE fan of the genre and it shows in his film.

The acting in ""The Sleeper"" is very top notch. Mr. Russell did a great job on the casting. All of the girls are likable in their own personal way. The killer in the film looks and acts the part, he reminds me of the killer's from: He Knows You're Alone, and The Slumber Party Massacre. Like both of those killers, he gives the wide-eyed looks, creepy voice, and his overall movements. Actor Jason Crabtree rocked out!

I personally can't wait to see what Justin Russell comes up with next. Death Stop Holocaust which he made before ""The Sleeper"" is also available now. I am a huge fan of Mr. Russell's work. Keep on doing what your doing Justin!",1334275200,2,1517,4.607407407407408

4988381,1,B006H3NO5M,"I'm a huge fan of horror films.  I love 80s horror movies, not because they were all that great, but because there's a bit of nostalgia there.  This film kind of captures some of that, if only in the music.  Very few of the people actually looked like they were living in 1981 actually, and the dance scene...what?

What was the point of the opening scene?  So the guy killed a girl in that house a few years before the events of the movie...so what?  It was never discussed, referenced, or anything.  Nobody said, ""hey, you know a girl was murdered here in 1979.""  Nothing...why even put it in?

How many sophomore girls join sororities?  Isn't that what freshmen do?  And why would that sorority just invite a random girl on the street?

So the main character's roommate and best friend...why was she dressed up as a goth girl?

That was one happening party though...watchout...all 8 people!!  Where were the other pledges?

Why didn't anyone ever lock a door in this movie?  Even when the cops ""secured"" the sorority house, both the front and back doors are open for both the boyfriend and the killer to just waltz right in.

Are there only 4 cops on a university or in a town like that?  And why would the cop keep sending the main character out on the street...alone?

What did he do with all the bodies?  He killed around ten people or so in a 24-hour period.  No way he could drag them all back to his ""lair"" which also happens to be the basement of a heavily-used academic building accessible by a well-lit staircase...nobody saw this guy down there?...

So the pool nudity scene...what?  She makes out with the guy after pulling him into the pool, takes her top off, makes out some more and then ditches him to get dressed...what???

Why was the guy's hammer always spotless, even after he just killed someone?

Look, 80s horror films were never known for their deep plots, but this movie has just too many holes to follow.  The special effects are a joke...I laughed more than I cringed...come to think of it, I never cringed.  From the girl's head magically becoming a rubber mask as the guy hammers her to death, to the obvious ""trick"" of not showing someone get hit by a hammer or knife because they couldn't afford fake weapons that would splatter blood or something.
Oh and the acting was terrible.

This was a family/friends production and it shows.  Some tips:

If you are having a ""party"" at a sorority house, go to the local college and recruit some kids to act as extras.

If you are setting your movie in the 80s...have your actors/actresses look like they are in the 80's.  Just look at a yearbook from the early 80s to get an idea of how they looked.

Explain WHY your killer is doing this.  Give him some background...even if you don't give us everything, provide a motive.  Was he rejected by sorority girls a while back?  They could have done a ""vision"" scene where the killer remembers getting made fun of by sorority girls.

Create some suspense...the deaths were all easy to see coming.  I actually was bored during the part where she was hiding in the auditorium.

If you are doing an homage to 80's horror movies, the best you can hope to do is parody them.  It'd be like trying to a 50's or 60's horror movie...they worked for their time, but today it just doesn't fly.  You can have your movie set in the 80's, but you need to not have so many plot holes and everything mentioned above.  House of the Devil is a good example.

What attracted me to this flick was the cover art and the 80's homage that the director strived for. Let's start with the positives; The leading actress was extremely likable. The movie was shot better than the average indie movie, great camera work. The artwork was cool. The theme and setting was awesome. If anything was negative, and only a bit was maybe the slasher kills weren't too original and the story greatly reminded me of Black Christmas. I can understand the homage to BC though since it is a horror classic. The killer was definitely creepy. The eyes were crazy looking and spooky. The director filmed at some impressive settings, including a naughty scene in an empty swimming pool (love 80's T&A). Good job and make another.",1332547200,4,921,4.726708074534161

4988410,4,B006H3NO5M,"THE SLEEPER is a throwback to the early 80s slasher flicks and succeeds in capturing that era's mindless slayings.  The film is reminiscent of Carpenter's classic HALLOWEEN, the ""Sleeper"" substituting for Michael Myers' boogeyman.  Unlike HALLOWEEN, there's more gore and brutality in THE SLEEPER.  We don't know who the Sleeper really is or why he's focused on the sorority girls but that's really irrelevant.  It's just a slasher film.  There are some spooky scenes of tension and the Sleeper's sardonic humor is effective.  The cast of unknowns die convincingly but no potential Jamie Lee Curtises!

As I read that synopsis on IMDB, I knew to myself that I had to find this movie, ""The Sleeper"", and so I spent the next month of my life hunting down this homage to the 80's slashers that I hold near and dear to my heart. As I received my dvd for ""The Sleeper"" from Amazon, I ripped off the shrink wrap and threw the dvd into my player. Would I be disappointed like I have been with so many other 80's slasher homages (""Frat House Massacre"" and ""Psycho Sleepover""...I'm looking directly at you) or would this be the rare slasher homage that actually works and take us back to a more innocent time?

Well my dear slasher fans, ""The Sleeper"" is a hoot for beginning to end. The deaths are graphic and over-the-top in the best ways possible and the direction and screenplay by Justin Russell is pitch perfect. As I watched this film, a smile grew on my face. I saw the references to ""Halloween"", ""Friday the 13th"", ""Slumber Party Massacre"", and ""Black Christmas"" and appreciated them more than I can possibly let on. This was made by someone who loves and cherishes the slasher genre and that heart and soul is in every frame of the film. Sure, the movie isn't perfect. There are far too many characters and some of the acting is a bit flat, nonetheless, those same criticisms could be said about even the best of the 80's slasher films. Do yourself a favor and check out ""The Sleeper"". If you enjoy horror homage at its finest, you will have a blast.

4988412,3,B006H3NO5M,"Just when you think you've seen every 80's slasher, a new one appears.... in 2012. Nowadays, it seems directors will only make a slasher if it's a parody or the characters (e.g. Scream) are self-aware of ""the rules"". The young director of The Sleeper, who probably wasn't born the year his film was set, made an unapologetic, formulistic 80's slasher film. Bravo! I love formulaic movies if the formula is solid. And the classic slasher formula has the works: beautiful girls, a mysterious killer, slow building tension, gratuitous nudity, leap outs, kills, and, of course, the sweet, quick-footed final girl. Other film makers try to re-invent the wheel and end up with movies about ghost-werewolves. Give me tried and true. The Sleeper is not perfect, but I enjoyed this ""period piece"".

4988417,5,B006H3NO5M,"All of the negative reviews for 'the Sleeper' really confuse me! It seems like people are going into this film with so many expectations, & they're too busy paying attention to every little detail about the year 1981, that they can't enjoy this film for it's awesomeness. Justin Russell, who wrote, directed, produced, & was even the director of photography, REALLY delivers a great slasher flick! It takes place in 1981, & that seems to be a constant complaint...That it's inaccurate. Well, here's the thing: If you're watching this movie to pinpoint inaccuracies, maybe you should stick to the Hollywood remakes & found-footage films. This is for people who appreciate the slasher sub-genre, & understand that they're not usually films you should pick apart. Just have fun!!!

Another complaint, is that people say it's too slow. I totally disagree! It's about the same pace as movies like Black Christmas, He Knows You're Alone, & Don't Go In The House, & NEVER boring.

One reason this is such a great indie slasher-flick, is that the kind of gore & camera-shots Russell pulls off on a tiny budget, are better than most Lionsgate or After Dark: 8 Films to Die For horror flicks. To me, that's impressive, since those go to theaters! And the killer is pretty menacing in this flick too! He's not in a mask, which sometimes kills a slasher-film, but in this case it works in it's favor. He makes creepy phonecalls, strikes out of nowhere, & has some pretty weird eyes. The acting in this is usually mentioned in a negative light, but it's not terrible. I actually found most of the actors to be pretty good, & definitely better than ANY Brain Damage, Asylum, or Channing Tatum film.

The bottom-line is: If you dig old school slasher movies, & wanna support a great indie film-maker, you need to buy 'the Sleeper'. I bought it based on the YouTube trailer, & was pretty impressed. You may be too!

And although I mentioned Brain Damage, Asylum, Lionsgate, & After Dark horror films, don't let that scare you. This is MUCH better than 99% of those :)",1328572800,18,2051,4.7366946778711485

8498056,5,B006H3NO5M,"The movie focus's on a giggling and sometimes weeping and bawling killer simply deemed, The Sleeper of whom back in 1979 breaks into the Alpha  Gamma Theta sorority house to off(while in her bed) one of the beautiful sorority sisters with a hammer.  The Sleeper slips away never having been caught nor was his identity ever known.  In a brief time later in the winter of 1981 2 new young beauties attend a sorority open house and needless to say you know who is soon back to his old tricks as several of the gorgeous sorority ladies and even some of their boyfriends turn up missing.

One thing that I can say about this movie is that if you love good classic slashers from the 70's and 80's then this movie will be just the ticket for you. Instantly this movie pays major tributes to suck great classics as Black Christmas(1974), Friday the 13th(1980), Pieces, and Halloween(1978).  Just from the opening alone you get one great reference to the beginning of Friday the 13th.  With the killer calling the sorority house with threats and other weird stuff that he says that's one major Black Christmas tribute right there.

The musical score done by Gremlin is very eerie, intense, atmospheric, and above all is one of so many things about this movie that both brings you back to the 80's and even makes you feel as if this movie was really made in the 80's, even if it came out 5 and a half years ago.  But as you watch it you are likely to get into it enough that it will hardly seem so recent.

Justin Russell proves one remarkable jack of all trades as the director, co-producer alongside Dana Jackson, writer, editor, and cinematographer as he does them all so remarkably well showing that he totally knows his stuff when it comes to keeping the movie from moving too fast or too slow, knows just what 80's teens would say and do in such a situation, gets the best cinematography when it comes to dark nights that are sometimes foggy and are grim and snowy, backgrounds that are understated but noticable in their old feel, and best of all you get the classic basketball gym, gym locker rooms, and even a dark auditorium.  Everything that Justin has put into this movie is a strongly wrapped full package.

There's a fair deal of sex in this movie but unfortunately not much nudity.  The bit that you do get is great though.

The gore effects are stunning and beautifully realistic.  Tom ""Sex Machine"" Savini would be proud and tearing up from joy.

Most of the kill scenes were great.  My favorite was the poolside decapitation with an axe.
The killers arsenal was mainly a hammer and sometimes an axe.  Other than that he would just use whatever he could come up with given the environment.

The club dance scene was so bad and so campy that I literally laughed out loud at it.

All in all, if you love a good slasher from the 70's and 80's, also love a loving and respectful tribute, love good gore, good camp and silliness, want to flashback to the good ole days of slashers in general, love sex scenes and nudity, and most of all want to see a retro-slasher that does all of that just and then some, then this one is definitely for you.  10 stars out of 10!!

And now comes a young buck named Justin Russell to do it for vintage, early '80s slasher films, something I have been a die-hard fan of for as long as I can remember.  Russell is another in the long line of obscure, regional filmmakers who prove that you don't need more than a shoestring budget to make a great slasher.  He does for the great state of Ohio what David Nelson (""House of Death"") did for Shelby, North Carolina; Anthony J. Christopher (""Fatal Pulse"") for Woodland Hills, California; and Peter Litten (""Slaughter High"") for London.  He demonstrates that it is talent, innovation, a real desire to deliver the goods, and most importantly, the style of the execution (as it were) -- that matter most.

It's important to note that while Amazon lists this as a 2012 title, the actual copyright date and the year it was produced is 2011 -- exactly 30 years on from the date in which it is set, 1981, which just happened to be the absolute peak year for the original slasher movie cycle.  As another reviewer has previously noted, Justin Russell may not have even been born yet then, but no matter -- he is a truly passionate fan for this particular era of slasher films, and he recreates the time period in question better than anyone else ever has.

Sure, the plot is a retread of the essential slasher template of the past -- a voyeuristic killer stalks a group of lovely young sorority ladies on a small Midwestern college campus.  And let me back up here -- this bunch of girls ARE young, and they ARE lovely -- nay, smoking hot even.  Not only do they all appear to be the age of actual college students (something I can't say about a lot of other of these types of films, most of which cast actors that look closer to the age of collecting Social Security benefits and early-retirement Roth ERAs), but they are all genuinely gorgeous and vivacious young women.  Slasher movie essentials?  Genuinely pretty girls, check.  How about a cheesy and dated (but masterful) synth-heavy score taken directly from the early '80s?  Check.  How about genuinely handmade and organic-looking and genuinely explicit gore effects?  Now this is a big one.  The effects, handled by Jon Shroyer, are a feast for the eyes of those bored to death of the sterile and all-too-perfect computer generated imagery that most stodgy digital-era movies employ today.

To sum up, what Justin Russell has done here, is meticulously recreate, scene for scene, shot by shot, nuance for nuance, everything that we loved about slasher movies most to begin with, and everything that has since gotten severely diluted in the post-""Scream"" era.  People who are giving this film one-star reviews here just don't get it, and are no doubt jaded by the mundane standard of multimillion-dollar, megabucks modern CGI horror.  What ""the Sleeper"" is, instead, is a group of talented and imaginative young filmmakers, most probably not even in their third decade of life yet, living their dreams and creating their ultimate love letter to the genre.  This film has become one of my favorite slashers of ANY era, and the most fun I've had at the movies in a long, long time.  It even has a cameo appearance by legendary Texas drive-in critic Joe Bob Briggs, for heaven's sake!  Now if HE gives ""the Sleeper"" his seal of approval, you KNOW it's the real thing!

(FINAL SIDENOTE:  I would recommend that hardcore fans track down the now out of print, limited edition deluxe version of this set, that came in a purposely beat-up and dilapidated-looking old VHS rental box, befitting the era it pays homage to, and complete with a grainy and time-worn analog transfer, the way it was meant to be seen.
