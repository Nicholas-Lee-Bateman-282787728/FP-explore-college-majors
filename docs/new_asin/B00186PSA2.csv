8268543,5,B00186PSA2,"Thunderbean has done another great collection of obscure cartoons, this one centered around monkeys.  Non-PC material at the least but a reflection of the time they were made.  Quality of the originals varies but all are worth watching.  These are not for the average viewer but more for the animation collector.",1386547200,,312,5.078431372549019
