1388364,1,B0000524EB,What an uninspired mess.  Visually Eric Morbius is just boring to look at as the Crow.  Character motivation is nowhere to be seen.  We know who the main villian is minutes into the movie. Even the way the Crow goes about exacting his vengence is boring and insipid.  I regret buying it and plan to just sell this copy on Ebay in order to make some money back,985478400,5,359,4.235294117647059
1388365,1,B0000524EB,"Man and love intrest befall tragedy, said character 'x' is raised from the dead to seek revenge ... blah blah blah.  What infuriates me the most about this movie was that there is an enormous ammount of completely untapped potential in every entry into this series.  Simply the idea that there really is no returning cast for each movie leaves each writer/director with the ability to go where ever they please with the material.  For example, what about a female crow?  Or maybe instead of a dark, brooding, lead male play off of a more scarcastic, dark humor-ish, angle (a la Daredevil or Spiderman).  The script writing is mediocre at best (and I loved Chip Johnnson when he wrote for Millenium, he's capable of much better).  Some things have me puzzled, such as how none of the villians or other characters in the movie recognize Crovis (the crow), who is still wearing is prison garb and very little make-up.  Why is there so much yellow fog everywhere?  Why is Alex Crovis' lawyer (Miles from Murphy Brown fame, who I just can't take seriously) not seem suprised at all to find his dead client walking around?  How does everyone seem to figure out the significance of the crow (including Corvis).  Mabius seems to spend the whole movie wondering how, emotionally, to play his role.  William Atherton couldn't look more disintrested if he tried and Kristen Dunst should fire whoever signed her into this. Everyone just seemed to phone this one in ... if you're really that intrested, have someone else rent it and watch theirs. I hope New Line/Dimension recircles the wagons and comes up with some idea on how to inject new blood into this franchise.  I'm a big fan of the series, it could be so good, but for right now, it's awfully close to hitting the drain.",985305600,6,1767,4.68284789644013
1388366,5,B0000524EB,"I pre-ordered this and just received the DVD.  The movie was great.  I was entertained, annoyed, frustrated, and vindicated.  The movie is true to the spirit of the original.  I would (and duck when I say it obviously) say that this rivals for the best in the trilogy.
Buyer beware of rumors heralding this as another big flop: some sites even have this listed as a 4 and 1/2 stars out of 10 with 90 votes.  The movie wasn't released ""officially"" before yesterday.

1388367,5,B0000524EB,"I recently watched The Crow: Salvation, I had to rent it unfortunately. I thought it was an excellent addition to the mythos. Eric Mabius does an excellent job of portraying Alex Corvis, a young man wrongfully accused of killing his girlfriend, and excecuted for the crime. His scene are extremely awesome and he doesn't try to copy Brandon Lee's Crow from the first film, Mabius is his own Crow and he steals the show. The shock on his face when he finds out who the real killers are to the reaction of the flashbacks he has of his girlfriend. There were some things in the film that could have been done better, mainly the action sequences, but all in all it was a great film. I recommended this film to Crow fans and people who aren't fans of The Crow...and you don't need to see the first two movies to understand the crow mythos.",985132800,,834,4.422077922077922
1388368,4,B0000524EB,"Many people had reviewed this movie badly before its release (via test screenings) while others just wrote it off because it never made it to the movie theaters.  I must admit this lowered my expectations a bit.
After viewing the film however, I must say that I enjoyed it thoroughly.  It did a good job of utilizing the Crow mythos while giving as a ""whodunit"" story.  It would have been easy to have the main character come back to life and just kill everyone - but first he had to figure out *who* to exact his revenge on, and that's the fun of the movie.
Eric Mabius does a great job with the Crow.  His Crow revels in his powers, but is also forced to acknowledge the powers (and purpose) that brought him back.  The supporting cast is excellent, providing one or two twists that are unexpected.
The DVD is cool, complete with a behind the scenes look at the movie and the addition of ""Who's that bird?"" - a brief look at the Crows themselves is a cute touch.
I was happy with this purchase and recommend it.",985046400,3,1013,4.338624338624339
1388369,5,B0000524EB,"...I was allowed to see this movie at a press screening and the one week test run in Spokane.
The Crow: Salvation definitely puts the crow right back on track. The Crow: Salvation has an excellent plot filled with twists and turns. The soundtrack and score for this film goes perfectly with this film. The Crow: Salvation is nothing at all like first two and the mystery angle instead of the straight on revenge like the first two is a nice change.
This movie doesn't start out like the first two, we meet the the main character before his death. The make up this time was burnt on at the time of his death instead of put on like the first two. As with any crow movie there is funny one-liners, action, explosions, and nudity. No wonder why the movie is rated R. Eric Mabius did an excellent job portraying The Crow. Fred Ward did an excellent job as the main bad guy, he could have been Top Dollar in the first one and it would  have been great. Kristen Dunst impressed me, I was surprised she did this well, she did an  excellent job of being emotional and confused. For those who never seen any of the crow movies or whatever, should be able to pick on this movie and like it easily.",980553600,9,1186,4.290178571428571

1388396,5,B0000524EB,"This movie is action packed. Each moment, from the resurrection to the end credits, is thrilling.  Alex Corvis, played by Eric Mabius, is a worthy successor to the Crow's power. This was an excellent addition to the Crow Series.

Unlike the previous chapters Corvis is resurrected only hours after his death.  He'd been executed for a murder he didn't commit.  An overload in the electric chair had burned his face beyond recognition.  When he healed his face had the white skin and black tears of  the crow.

Corvis hunts the dirty cops who'd murdered the woman he loves, and framed him for her murder.  These cops weren't ""On the Take"", they were their own criminal organization.  Lauren had found out about their organization, and had been killed for it.

The crow isn't a hero.  He's a Destroyer - an Avenging Angel.  His quest for revenge takes many lives - those who'd killed Lauren and those foolish enough to stand between him and his revenge.  His main target was a man with self inflicted scar on his arm.  That man had planted evidence in Corvis's car, framing him.

Once The Man With the Scar understood what was coming for him, he faked his death - by planting a replica of his arm at the scene of an explosion.  When Corvis believed he'd had his revenge his powers started to fade.  He started crossing over.

Then the dirty cops went after Lauren's sister.  She was Corvis's only link to the living, he was connected to her.  He helped set her free, and in the process learned of the deception - learned his vengeance was incomplete. Unlike the previous movies, at the finale Corvis was still at Full Crow Power.

After his revenge was complete, Corvis's spirit could finally rest.  He was ready to be reunited with Lauren.",1420243200,,1738,4.629508196721312

1388416,4,B0000524EB,"Note: I saw this film via XFinity On Demand.

This second sequel to The Crow is at least better than the theatrical cut of The Crow: City Of Angels. Kirsten Dunst does a stellar job as the sister of the murdered girl, and Eric Mabius at least does not try to emulate Brandon Lee (no one can). The a-hole from Die Hard and the 'Hero' from Remo Williams do decent jobs in roles that any other actor could have done. What I like about the three films is that the protagonists never kill innocent people, which shows that they have respect for human life, and they try to help thoe in need of assistance. This is made clearer in the first film, when Eric shows a trull the error of her ways.

The only thing I didn't like was the profaning of God's Name. That's nails on a chalkboard to me.

View the first film, skip the theatrical cut of the second (wait for the Director's Cut, if it ever is released) and rent this one.

Rated R (strong violence & language, including some uses of a religious profanity, and some nudity).",1375747200,,1021,4.302083333333333

It had everything I really wanted from a crow film.  I thought Eric Mabious (I think that's his name) did a great job as the lead character.  I liked the look of the film, basic story, and the acting all was good.  I would change some small things, but all in all I would recommend this to any crow fan or movie goer.

1388437,3,B0000524EB,"This movie used some nice things from The Crow franchise! But on a B-movie scale!
What I liked about the movie was:
1. It had an excellent soundtrack!
2. Eric Mabius was a great choice for the crow!
3. It shows how people with authority like to abuse their power (especially cops)!
4. Kirsten Dunst was great!
5. We sall some good actors from previous movies that did their best to make this movie good!
6. The lighting was good (not too dark, but still creepy)!
7. We found out that if the crow thinks that he found what he's looking for, he looses
his powers! Nice twist to The Crow mythology!

What I didn't like was:
1. The violence and gore was a little over the top!
2. The plot didn't hold the movie up enough and got a little boring!
3. Jodie Lynn O'Keaf was not used enough!

Overall: This movie was filmed on a B-movie scale but still turned out to be some-what good in the end,

And I've heard a lot of people say that there never should have been any sequels made to the movie ""The Crow"".

It almost felt like whoever put this thing together wanted to break away from the elements that made the Crow, in both movies and comics, work.

The murder mystery wasn't very mysterious, it's always nice to see Kirsten Dunst doing work, but I wondered why she was even there.  The love story was based on her dead sister, so what? Another love interest?  It didn't play well.  The Crow, a normally trench coated avenger wore a trnchcoat in this for all of five minutes, and the educated evil police force was a serious stretch.

All in all, I watched it because it was a Crow movie, a comic movie and hey, it had Kirsten Dunst, but it was far from something I'd spend serious time watching again though I do own it.

I wish I was multilingual so I knew the word ""terrible"" in every language to describe each scene of this movie.  It's as if Lucio Fulci and James O' Barr got dead drunk, cut up splices of the weaker parts of ""City of Angels"", made a short film as a joke and then accidentally distributed copies of the tape to goth clubs where die hard Crow fans generated a fundraiser for a DVD cover and advertisement.

Love scenes have been done better on Lifetime TV.  Eric Mobius looks like the young guy who gets picked as ""Most Likely To Be a Loser"" in his high school yearbook, and lives up to that prophecy very well playing the boring Alex Corvis--he belonged in that electric chair, guilty or not, just for the way he acts.

Kirsten Dunst looks like she's about ready to break out laughing at any time.  At no point are any of the characters believable in any sense whatever.  Fred Ward grits his teeth and tries desperately to look sadistic, probably demanding his payment in cash between scenes for his next contractually obligatory appearance on ""As the World Turns"".

The original crow film played heavily on its excellent character acting, counterpointing this with an interesting, if not entirely new take on the ""good guy gets revenge"" scenario. All of this of course played out on a stylized noir backdrop ably soundtracked by current and up and coming industrial and electronic music.

So what do we have here? A movie so one dimensional even bank managers would find it dry. Cardboard cutout characters who's names might as well be cliche bad cop one, cliche bad cop two and so on. Muddled sound and music mix. Stultifying dialogue. TV quality stunts, wait - let me correct that, low budget, daytime TV quality stunts (ooh, they have a helicopter chase). Ouch.

1388455,2,B0000524EB,"This one really isn't what it couldve been.
First off, I'll keep my review as unbiased and truthful as possible.
This movie is not a super production so don't expect that ""movie"" quality, meaning it looks like it came right out of a tv show rather than a theater.
The story itself is pretty grim like the first and second and THE SAME THING again, but without the super production. Which really makes this movie a pointless waste of space on your dvd rack.
It just isn't convincing enough to get into. The acting is sort of childish. The actors were definitely not involved in the story line. Dialogue is quite tacky and overly done if you ask me. Not enough sadness to make you want revenge. It seems forced.
How many times are we going to see a male crow character die unfairly and come back to take revenge because his girlfriend or son got killed in cold blood? STOP MAKING CROW MOVIES!!! STOP!!!! STOPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The first one was great. The second was passable. These new productions only show us how unskilled our new visionary directors and writers are.
STOP!!!! Leave The Crow alone already. Christ. >:/

Eric Mabius, a strange choice for the roll. He doesnt wear the mask well at all. He doesnt have the face for it. These producers need to understand that white face paint only works on certain faces. And being that his mask is really the ""under skin"" from his charred face??? (stupid and unreal) just helps make it even more unconvincing and retarded.
Its not a terrible movie, just nothing to go wow about. Ok that was B.S., this IS a terrible movie. Ever if it came out on TV instead, it sucks. The last installment of this movie series MUST BE AVOIDED. But thats another review.

If you want to pick this up, make sure its in the box set and not a single.

Goodluck.

1388456,4,B0000524EB,"I almost didn't watch this movie, after being pretty dissapointed in City Of Angels. AI decided to give it a try anyway. I was very glad i did.

Eric Mabius is a delightfully twisted Alex/Crow, with plenty of dark humor to keep me interested. He's wrongfully executed for his girlfriend's death. Everyone believes he's guilty, except for his lawyer. who stays with him until they come for him.

Naturally, he comes back to life, not just to seek justice, but to discover WHY his girlfriend died the way she did.  Police corruption and all is included in this movie, and it's very fast paced. The bad guys die suitable deaths for their crimes.

He finds help in Lauren's younger sister, Erin. At first, Erin doesn't believe him, despite the fact he's come back from the dead! But she's eventually convinced, and it's believable too.

It's definetly a worthy edition to the Crow series. the only reason i don't give it 5 stars is because I loved The Crow so much, nothing tops it.

1388457,4,B0000524EB,"Like I said in my Crow Wicked Prayer review (Check that out) This film and City Of Angels were adds of honour to the first Crow film (Although the fourth one went right down the drain and dishonoured the first one) The Crow: Salvation really brings everything together. Eric Mabius did great, Kirsten Dunst was good too. But, the music could've been a leetle better. The rock music lacks dark (In my opinion) 'After The Flesh' was a very good dark-rock-theme (played while the big shoot-out at Top Dollar's in Crow 1)

Of course this movie or City Of Angels doesn't surpass the first Crow film. Nothing ever will.

1388458,5,B0000524EB,"I was (and still am) a big fan of the original ""The Crow,"" but since it's sequel ""The Crow: City Of Angels"" failed to impress me, I never bothered with this installment, ""The Crow: Salvation."" However, I recently saw this available for purchase at a dirt cheap price, and seeing the lovely Kirsten Dunst on the cover (who I'll watch in anything), I figured what better time than now. Having now seen it, I can tell you that I made a mistake in ever passing it by. ""Salvation"" gets it right. Whereas the previous movie was a redundant remake of the original, this installment goes a bit darker and bit edgier. One thing's for sure, it's a lot meaner, even going further than the original did at times. The first 10 minutes alone contain so much dramatic impact that it could be a movie in itself. Right from the get-go, this movie sucks you in and grabs your attention. Without hardly any exposition, we manage to make an emotional connection and an investment in our main character, Alex Corvis (played by Eric Mabius).

Alex has just been wrongly executed for the murder of his girlfriend, the love of his life. Since this is a ""Crow"" movie, Alex gets to come back from the dead and find out who killed her, and why. With a little help from his good-guy lawyer (the only person who believed him all along) and the sister (played by Dunst) of his girlfriend, he tracks down the people involved in the murder, in an effort to find the one responsible. It plays out in typical fashion really. I'm not gonna say the movie is unpredictable. Quite the opposite. But the difference here is how intense the situation is. The actors all portray their characters very effectively and make us love them and hate them, just as much as we should. The story is engrossing, and moves along quite swiftly. The directing style is definitely the major thing that seperates this movie from it's predecessors. It's not as gritty of a film. It doesn't have the ""noir"" look that they had. Instead, it has a more David Fincher-esque style to it. A style that many people associate with MTV and music videos. Even still, it works in the movie's favor, making the experience (although the story may be familiar) feel like something a little more fresh. The only complaint I find in this movie is the way Alex dispatches the people responsible for his girlfriend's death. The deaths should have been a little more cathartic than they were. The average death in this movie involves a gun. Come on, these people are scum! They've earned bigger deaths than that...

""The Crow: Salvation"" had me satisfied on all fronts. It was quick moving, entertaining, and very engrossing. It's a shame it went direct to video -- due to poor test screenings. Who the Hell attended these screenings? It's hardly a shallow movie, and it's very well made and professional looking. And to think, I almost never saw it! Just because ""other people"" (i.e. the ""test screening"" crowd and critcs) decided it was a bad film. Don't let that deter you from watching this movie. It's the perfect ""Crow"" sequel.",1127433600,10,3055,4.645101663585952
1388459,4,B0000524EB,"If someone has to list the films of THE CROW in order of ... let's call it ""palatability"", I would definitely have to put THE CROW: SALVATION as #2 right behind the original film.

There are now four films in THE CROW series and each one brings something different to THE CROW legend.  Here, Alex Corvis (Eric Mabius in a tour-de-force of underplayed acting, which really works here) is legally executed in the electric chair after being framed, tried and sentenced for the murder of his love Lauren (usually, the protagonist is murdered right alongside and with the person he loves most), and after being resurrected the traditional facepaint is replaced by his own scarred skin from his electrocution.  Also, in this film Corvis must convince Erin (Kirsten Dunst), the sister of his lost love, of his innocence; previously, The Crow has found willing female allies (the young Sarah in THE CROW and the adult Sarah in THE CROW: CITY OF ANGELS) right from the beginning.  THE CROW: SALVATION retains the darkness of the original film, but adds more than just a taste of corruption that the previous two films didn't have (the villains in those two were pure evil, whereas The Crow's victims here hide their evil under the guise of enforcers of the law/justice), and the main villain, (Fred Ward in a marvelously vicious portrayal) whom we don't meet until about one-third to halfway through the film, is probably the most monstrous of all THE CROW villains (without giving anything away, the scene in which the main villain gets his comeuppance is one of the most gripping moments from ANY of THE CROW films, and one which I keep replaying every time I watch this film!).

I have read a few reviews of this film here in AMAZON.COM in which people have complained about how it is that the villains in each film know the secret of The Crow; I answer them: unless the forces of evil know The Crow's weakness and are able to exploit it somehow, the hero loses his complexity and becomes a two-dimensional unstoppable killing machine like Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees; without some vulnerability, The Crow has no depth to him.  Many people also put this film down for being released direct-to-video rather than commercially, but that should not matter; it certainly doesn't detract from THE CROW: SALVATION's being a worthy addition to the franchise.",1127174400,5,2348,4.8283582089552235
1388460,5,B0000524EB,"Okay, this wasn't a bad movie. Despite the fact that, the storyline does get a mixed up. This was a great movie. Eric Mabius does make a very good crow!!! Also, Kirsten Dunst was really good in this film too. So check it out!!!!",1122336000,,228,4.204545454545454
1388461,4,B0000524EB,"""The Crow: Salvation"", the third film in the successful Crow franchise, was pretty much doomed to Direct-to-DVD damnation by the studio that produced it.  Instead of marketing the film properly with commercials and trailers trying to hype the movie as a different type of Crow movie to bring in new viewers and fans of the franchise, the movie was screen tested in one city with little, to no advertising.  So it was no surprise that this movie went all the way to DVD, bypassing theaters completely.  Although in the studio's defense, there were plenty of fans and critics that hated the second installment ""The Crow: City of Angels"", so I can see why they were uneasy about another big screen release of the dark hero, but this was a totally different story and genre presented in the familiar Crow package.  That is, it centered on a character that had died wrongfully and returns to life for revenge; however, the difference this time is that instead of the flashbacks presenting the audience with the knowledge of who exactly was involved in the crime, we are instead presented with only part of the puzzle and are left to discover the entire truth along with the hero.

The story for ""The Crow: Salvation"" is this, Alex Corvis (played by newcomer Eric Mabius) is wrongfully executed for the murder of his girlfriend (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe).  Condemned by his girlfriend's father and sister (Kirsten Dunst), and crooked cops trying to cover up the fact that they are responsible for the death of Alex's girlfriend, Alex is sentenced to death.  He isn't helped by the fact that no one believes that there was a man with scars on his arm that placed the murder weapon in his vehicle.  Now, Alex returns to life seeking vengeance on those that wronged him, to discover who the man with the scars truly is, and to prove to his girlfriend's family that he is innocent.

The twists in this film are truly well done, and the mystery surrounding the man with the scars is executed wonderfully, and not everyone is what they seem except for Alex and the sister of his dead girlfriend.  Another unique change to this Crow is that instead of face paint being used to create the look of the Crow, his scars form the familiar Crow appearance.  Wonderfully crafted film, with very realistic characters, and an intriguing murder mystery mixed with the familiar Crow elements, makes for another great installment in this engaging film franchise.

Instead of being killed right out in cold blood, Alex Corvis is framed, executed, and must seek revenge for the murder of his girlfriend, and consequently himself. Rather a decent telling, if you ask me. As much as we all love Brandon Lee, and nobody can ever replace him as far as these movies are concerned, I think we can all agree we do not want another cookie-cutter Crow sequel. Eric Mabius delivers a great performance that's believable and entertaining, and certainly not  as unprofessional as some people would have you believe. Everyone is entitled to their opinions, this is true. However, instead of watching it once and immeadiately bashing whatever comes to mind quickest, why don't you sit down, try and enjoy the movie, and analyze just why this rendition was made the way it was.

The movie, as a whole, has a neo-noir feel about it. It's about bad cops, sleazy strip joints, and dark alleys. The fights aren't cleaned up, or not much - wounds really bleed. The female lead seems almost out of place, as if she's some emissary from a world of wholesome daylight.
This is watchable action/adventure, a little more raw than most. Don't look for complex characters or ideas, though. It's still just a comic book, or what the comic would be without the ""Comics Code.""",1085961600,2,718,4.752

This one will truly never live up to the original (Brandon Lee was truly his father's son), but there's no way you can say that City of Angels out does this one. First off, there's no chance in the world that the same person will ever see two people brought back by the crow in their life, that was the first mistake of the second one. Also, in this one, they did follow the comic more tightly in the fact that Corvis knew what he was brought back for, that's the way the comic originally had it. Also certain things about this showed more feeling than all of the parts of City of Angels combined, and Corvis acted like someone who had pure hatred for those who took his reason for living away in the same way (but not as good as) Brandon Lee did in the first one.

The second one at least good cinemaphotography, a few good scenes and it had at least some conviction. This movie on the other hand i would undoubtably say had as much conviction as a high school film assignment. They had a few ideas that might have been good on the script but the director botched every single one. The more dramatic the movie got the more laughable it was. I think the whole film was shot in one take.

The story is easy to follow, with some thought going into it, the acting was strong enough and the visuals were stunning, especially the death chamber.  The biggest surprise of this movie was that not only had the producers and director managed to stay faithful to the gothic of the first, but also added humour, which is something I never expected to find in a Crow movie, but something that works well here.

While it is better than the second installment, its not by much.  Eric Mabius isn't half bad, maybe with a better script we could have seen his talent shine, and the same goes for Kirsten Dunst who is sadly wasted in her role.  Jodi Lynn O'Keefe, William Atherton, Fred Ward, and Dale Midkiff round out the cast, and all of whom try to make the best out of a bad situation, but its pretty clear why this went direct to video.  The problem with the last two Crow films is the story is missing the raw emotional feel the first had, not to mention there is no other director that could helm any Crow movie the way Alex Proyas did.

1388474,3,B0000524EB,"As a big fan of the first Crow movie, and a bigger fan of the second, I bought this DVD based soley on brand-name recognition. I know what to expect from the Crow, namely, some decent person had something bad done to them, and that person comes back from the dead and avenges themselves, and rights the wrongs. Pretty straightforward stuff. Without getting into the meat of the story, or giving away any suprises, that's what happens here.
I can tell from the acting that this movie was made with the best intentions. I won't disparage the actors, because everybody did a decent job with what they had. And therein lay the problem.
It seemed as though the actors weren't given much to work with. The dialouge is thin, which doesn't develop the characters all that well.
Also, it seems after the dismal performance of the second Crow (underrated, check it out), the budget for the Crow franchise took a serious cut.  It has a direct to video feel to it, and the more I watched, the more I expected Shannon Tweed walk onscreen, just to give it some b-movie cred.
All that and believe it or not, a weak story. Yeah they followed the formula, but watered it down some.
Overall, it wasn't a great movie, but it wasn't awful either. I did manage to watch it all the way through without stopping. If you're looking for them to recapture the magic of the first, dream on. If you've never seen the Crow, I don't suggest that you run right out and get this to get started; the first one is way better. Check it out at the rents, or better, buy it used.",1030752000,,1542,4.410526315789474
1388475,2,B0000524EB,"Don't please talk about the crystal clear thing: Brandon Lee is gone, and no one can replace him.  Still, they made two movies crowned with ""Crow"" in their titles and even a TV series (with pretty good Mark Dacascos).  So, James O'barr's cult comic lives on screen -- that's Okay with me, if the producers are a bit more careful in making another one.
The story is an old one every fan of the franchise knows.  Alex the hero is accused wrongly of killing his girlfriend, and is executed for the crime.  But he comes back with supernatural power of an enigmatic crow, and seeks for revenge on those who are really responsible for the bloody deed.
The story is violent, and some people loathes this film franchise and its original comic, but that's not the problem here.  Think this way; What do you think when all-powerful, superhuman, deadly hero sneaks into a police station, and searches a file about the case in an archive?  Or when he askes (yes, ask!) his attorney (hired by him before he was dead) to find out the clue, and comes back to get it in the lawyer's office?  Come on, it's definitely not a thing for any hero with supernatural power!
And if you are looking forward to seeing lovely Kirstin Dunst, steer away and watch ""Spider-man"" instead.  Though her name is top-billed on screen, her role is a small one, or smaller than it should be, considering her name today.  She plays sister of Alex's girlfriend who got killed, and later comes to believe his innocence.  But with her considerable acting ability, which we all know by now, her character is not at all convincing.  So, who's to blame?  Not her, but clumy direction that should have been given a swift and smooth narrative that is essential to this kind of revenge story.
The only saving grece I could find is its soundtrack songs, which are really cool.  But even they seem to have been wasted to me among tedious story.",1028419200,2,1894,4.551622418879056
1388476,5,B0000524EB,"Well it has been a while since I have seen a new movie since the first Crow and the second City of Angels. Both movies, especially the first were great! I guess I'm the type of person that is into the whole revenge thing. Salvation was excellent! It has become my favourite movie, at the moment! Eric Mabius was great as the crow; he portrayed the character Alex extremely well.
I know that in a way it is recycling the original movie by the guy raising from the dead and seeking revenge on the people that are guilty for their death, but what you have to realise is this is what the crow is all about. But what they have tried to do is put each new character in a different situation. In the first one with Eric, his girlfriend and himself are murdered because they made complaints. The second with Ashe, his son and himself are murdered because they witnessed murder. But they add in that Ashe falls for Sarah who was in the first movie. In the last with Alex, his girlfriend is murdered because she witnessed a murder by a bunch of corrupt cops. She hides it from her boyfriend and he tries to find out what her secret is, and then he gets pinned with her murder, eventually he gets executed. These are all different situations, and are done very well!!
I know that the two actors wouldn't ever take the place of Brandon Lee, because he is the original crow, nobody could replace such an excellent actor, but he could never replace the other actors in the second and third crow! They were too good!
If you want to see a horrible recycled version of the original crow, watch Stairway to Heaven, I think that they were really stretching it with that one! I couldn't stand it; it was so horrible that about 15 minutes into it I was going to turn it off! But one of my friends' had not seen it before so I just left it on. They had never seen any of the movies until that night and even they thought it was crap! No offense but they really destroyed the original by releasing that and then releasing the TV series! That series just made no sense at all and ruined the true story that is the crow!!! The actor was great, he looked a lot like Brandon Lee, but definitely could never take his place as Eric!!! Trust me, Salvation is a whole lot better than Stairway to Heaven!!!! By a long, long, long shot!!!!!

Eric Mabius plays the character a lot better than Vincent perez's  manic turn with a menacing sense of calm about him,it fits the role better. The gorgeus and talented Kirsten Dunst seems a bit wasted,as her part is fairly low key and reserved. A slighly better plot about wrongful death by execution  adds to the storyline. But where we have one improvement,another is bound to go wrong and in this case sadly the film has a rather low budget look about it,and I prefer the Batman- style gothic city look of the first two movies which does not appear so much here. Also,the character is fast becoming a cliche' unfortunatly. How many times can a person be raised from the dead and all decide to wear a long black raincoat or leather jacket as well as the goth/metalhead look. The action also fails to hit the mark again compared to part 1,again the showdown is a low-key shootout with not much else happening.

To other reviewers even if you think ""Salvation"" and ""City of Angels"" aren't as good as the first crow movie they are still excellent movies in their own rights. I think that this movie is defiantly better than the second movie and almost as good as the original Excellent go out and buy this movie if you are a Crow fan.",997747200,,624,4.2521008403361344

1388496,3,B0000524EB,"I absolutely loved the first ""Crow"" movie.  It was a tragic, gothic romance that absolutely moved me enough to buy it.  This sequel to ""The Crow"" isn't without it's flaws, but is better than the lousy second sequel.
In this sequel, a man is wrongfully executed for a murder he didn't commit.  Of course, when one is wronged through death, the crow comes back and brings him back to avenge his death, yeah, you get the picture.  This time, the murdered girlfriend's sister, Kristin Dunst, is a major player in this movie as well as a couple of other actors you will be surprised to see.
Whereas the second Crow closely resembled the first, (and badly, I might add,) this one is different.  It resembles a movie that can stand on it's own rather than a sequel.  No one from the first or second movie is in this.  However, it is more gory than the first two.  One word: taxidermy.
Do I recommend this?  Only if you're a die-hard fan.  It's not bad, it's just for preferential taste only.  Plus, you have to have a tougher stomach as well (considering one of the scenes has Kirsten having her mouth sewn shut rather than just taping it to keep her from screaming.)  You'll appreciate the effort made with this one rather than the appauling second.  Think of it like ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" apologizing for ""Temple of Doom.""  Although unfortunately, it's not THAT good.  But better.

1388499,4,B0000524EB,"...but regardless, this is still a relatively good movie. The third addition to The Crow series, this film does something which the second one (The Crow: City of Angels) failed to do - it does something different. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of The Crow. I've read the comics and the novels, I've sat through the syndicated television show, I own all three movies. Because of all these factors, many people would probably expect me to go into a rant about how horrid this film is, that it disgraces the memory of Brandon Lee and whoever responsible for it should experience a slow and painful death.
I'm not going to say that. Because, what some of these other reviewers failed to notice about The Crow franchise is that it's a very universal concept. Anyone who's been wronged can be resurrected through the mystical powers of the enigmatic crow. The last thing I wanted this movie to be was another rehash of the original. I didn't want to see yet ANOTHER guy with long, dark hair, an affinity for leather, and goth appeal oozing from every orifice. I wanted to see something different. In my mind, Salvation accomplishes this. The lead character has short hair, and he's dressed in prison fatigues. Right there, it breaks one major stereotype of The Crow. And that leads into my main complaint about fans of the series. Some (not all, mind you) don't want The Crow films to be a rehash of the first film. Yet, they also rant and rave if it's different. So how, praytell, do you expect it to be an original film if it's not allowed to be different from the first film?
Brandon Lee was simply marvelous in The Crow. That much is a given. Anyone who's watched it, even if they didn't like the film, they enjoyed his performance. He was truly born to play that role. City of Angels, the sequel, had a great actor in the lead role. Vincent Perez was marvelous. But, while it was still an entertaining movie, it was basically a rehash of the original. A rehash that lacked the magic that the first one had. Salvation is able to do something different. There's no crime lord in this story. Instead, the enemy is a corrupted police department. The hero in this film doesn't paint his face. Instead, the mark of The Crow is due to the scars he received during his execution.
I recall that one reviewer attacked this film because the main character, Alex Corvis, killed several police officers. What, exactly, did you want him to do? If you'll recall, they were shooting at him, as well. He simply acted in retaliation. This reviewer also complained that, ""Brandon Lee's character never did this!"" Obviously, the reviewer overlooked the fact that in the shoot-out scene at Top Dollar's in the first film, Brandon Lee's character grinned and said, ""you're all going to die."" Then, he proceeded to kill about twenty people to get to one. Yes, they were crime lords who deserved to die. But, who's to say that the police officers Alex killed were innocent? The story was one of police corruption. Who's to say that those cops weren't corrupt?
Even if they were innocent, it simply reflects the descent into madness that all Crows experience. Brandon Lee's character made this evident by sudden bouts of rage whenever he was reminded of his past. Vincent Perez's character would recite words that his killers said before they took away the life of him and his son. Alex Corvis killed some cops.
To my fellow Salvation critics and Crow fans, I implore you: open your eyes. Don't attack Salvation simply because it's not the original. Don't attack Eric Mabius simply because he's not Brandon Lee. There will never be another Brandon Lee. There will never be another The Crow. It happened. It's in the past. The time has come to move on. If you compare Salvation to The Crow, then yes, it will seem like a horrible movie. That's why you shouldn't compare them. And for Heaven's sakes, please stop complaining. It happened. It's done. You can't turn back the clock and erase this film. So, why don't you try watching it with an open mind?",992649600,6,4035,4.636871508379889
1388500,2,B0000524EB,"This was one of the funniest movies I've seen in a really long time. You must buy this movie and watch it with a bunch of friends. Okay, maybe you should rent it. But how could you resist? If you are a hater of the first Crow movie you'll really love this one. It has nothing that the first movie offered! The allure of the first movie for me was the shear beauty of it. Brandon Lee himself was joy to watch for two hours. The main character of this movie is not attractive in the least. Instead of having the morals and vendetta that the first and second Crow had, this guy just kills for the hell of it. In fact at one point he wastes about 10 cops who are just doing thier job! At least in the first two movies there was some way of thinking the bad guys at least deserved it.
But if the unattrative guy (wait 'till you see the disgusting way he gets his Crow face) isn't to your liking, rent it for the special effects!! Make sure you watch closely as The Crow drops a lit match into some spewing gasoline...the match lands on one side, but the pyrotechnics guy lights the other side of the puddle! And this scene climaxes in a wonderful explosion of a helicopter. Of course they couldn't really afford to blow up a real one, so they apparently higher some highschool student to CGI some flames over the helicopter and make it look like it is consumed in a firey inferno.
Shallow characters, unneeded violence, lame dialogue, lame plot, lame music, lame lame lame. Some guy apparently was explained the plot to the first movie and just didn't get it. It is to The Crow (the first one) as the Second Highlander is to the first.
Oh! And this Crow gets all sorts of intersting new abilities! Wait till you see the way it looks when he sees through the crow's eyes...ever seen the screen saver which is a ball that distorts your screen?  Okay, I could go on forever, but you really have to see it for yourself!",988848000,4,1910,4.276243093922652
1388501,2,B0000524EB,"After the horrible first sequel, I was delighted to read many good reviews for this one. Unfortunately, it turned out to be more in the vain of ""city of Angels"" than the original.
So many things in this movie are just plain wrong, the script often reaches ridicoulously silly points to drive itself forward. One horrid example: The Crow has just kidnapped a corrupt cop, one of those corrupt cops who are to blame for the rape and murder of his girlfriend. They drive in the cops car. Suddenly, for absolutely no reason, other cop cars turn up, even a cop helicopter, joining up to a silly car-action scene. At the end of that scene ALL cars AND the Helicopter explode, and the reason for those explosions is totally silly. Another example: The crow doesn't look much different as the crow than he did before he was electric-chaired. Still, nobody reckognizes him, not even the sister of his girlfriend, let alone all the corrupt cops he's chasing.
The movie lifts many scenes from the original and turns them up to a mess. The big boss behind all those stupid corrupt cops turns out to have similar intentions than the villian in the original, but only in the last 15 minutes of this movie. For the rest, he's your standard corrupt cop, no personality at all. He's ripping off Dee Snider's ""Strangeland"" very obviosly when it comes to handle a hostage. The rest of his gang just faceless idiots, I could hardly tell one corrupt cop from the other. After all, the reason why they are corrupt is never solved. ""He ruined all that we worked for"" says Big-Corrupt-Cop. What exactly they worked for? It's never explained really. And one absolutely sorry scene has the crow entering a strip club, turning it to pieces, seeing a stripper handcuffed with little holes in her arm. Then he preaches that it ain't too late for her and that she should use her chance. This stripper is in the movie only that the crow can preach to her. It's awful.
Everytime the scenes change we get a new song from the soundtrack. After about 3 times, this becomes so obvious that it's pretty annyoing.
There are a few positive things: Eric Mabius is good as the Crow, and some cool direction ideas. That was it for me, the rest is equal to part 2. I didn't like it, but I tried. Stick to the original.",987552000,,2275,4.537712895377129

1388524,2,B0000524EB,"As with many Crow fans, the first movie is one of my favorite films of all time while the second left a somewhat bad taste in my mouth.  The reviews I had read here had given me hope that this Crow film would be better than the second.  Unfortunately, it's actually worse..  It is basically a made-for-cable style vigilante movie that attempts to cash in on the Crow name.  You've got everything here you would see on any generic late night cable movie..unnecessary gratuitous strip club scenes, plenty of gun battles, a thin plot, and an overabundance of lifeless acting.
You basically start off with Eric Mabius as Alex Corvin, a generic hero whose happy-go-lucky demeanor and undeveloped character make any attempt at displaying emotion appear completely fake.  As in the other films, the hero is back to avenge his dead girlfriend.  We have the usual Crow movie flashbacks..although in this case, thin acting and a lack of chemistry give the appearance that they had been together for about 2 weeks before her murder...  There is simply no sense of anger or pain..or anything for that matter...
Then we throw in Kirsten Dunst, who just isn't given much to work with here as the victim's sister who tries to help Mabius.  Fred Ward's made-for-cable impersonation of a bad guy was obviously a bad choice for the film.  To complement the acting, we also are give a thin script full of obvious plot twists that just ends up being filler between the beginning and the rather obvious end of the film.
On the technical side of things, the filming and editing have completely murdered the sense of darkness from the first film that even ocassionally appeared in the second.  The use of computer effects on cutscenes gives the film all of the substance of a music video or a screensaver.
In short, watching this film was like watching any generic made-for-cable action/suspense movie.  If you're a fan of the Crow series, you may find that this film falls way short of your expecations.",987033600,6,1981,4.7631578947368425

When I first watched this I was iffy as to what kind of film it would be, but I was pleasantly surprized by the movie. Kirsten Dunst puts in a strong effort again, and Eric Mabius was a fresh face on the scene. The villians were a bit tacky, but the story was updated for modern times with the whole back room of the strip club. If you want to just kind of suspend belief for a bit, and not compare this to the original, then you should like Salvation.",986774400,,648,4.233870967741935
1388526,2,B0000524EB,"The legend that is the basis for ""The Crow - Salvation"" claims that when a person dies, there are times that the emotional burden they carry is too much to bring into the land of the dead.  In these cases, their souls are returned to the land of the living by a crow and reunited to their bodies, so they can tie up the loose ends.  This premise is a wonderful setup, with many opportunities for variety, emotion, and even a little action.
When the major character in the film has returned from the dead to take care of unresolved emotional issues, you would expect a film with heart.  You would expect soul-searching, pain, anguish, and redemption in every corner.  Indeed, this is what made the original ""Crow"" such a wonderful film, and the potential is here, as well.  The final film, however, appears to be the result of conflicting visions.
Chip Johannessen's screenplay has all the emotional potential of the first film, in all of its painful beauty.  When, at one point, a character wishes to be dead, the hero uses one of his special abilities to show just what it would be like, telling her that this is not what she wants.
Quite often, though, director Bharat Nalluri seems to downplay all of this, shooting it as if he didn't care, using the crude and gritty hand-held camera when slick and atmospheric would have definitely been better to create the feeling of pathos.  Instead, he turns his attention once again to the action, where ""City of Angels"" also got lost.  Why is it that Hollywood is less afraid of bullets than it is of tears?  What is worse is that Nalluri barely even can choreograph a decent fight scene, so the impact is entirely lost there, as well.  I should also mention in honor of a friend that a helicoptor explosion is featured, and well done, though it hardly redeems the scene, or the movie.
What is even more bizarre are the performances.  Dunst, once so good at darkness in ""Interview with the Vampire"", appears to have been in too many sunny teenage movies and forgotten how to be depressed and sullen.  Eric Mabius, as well, seems to hit one, maybe two, notes in his performace as Alex Corvis - rage, and anger.  Throughout the entire movie he looks irritated, even when he should be showing some signs of humanity.
The plot, as well, is a bit muddled, with logic and common sense taking back seat, just so we can get the the fighting a little bit faster.  There are characters introduced who *could* be threatening, but are merely bizarre oddities.  I found myself missing Michael Wincott's memories of his father as the villian in the original.  I missed the strong sense that film had of who was who, and why they each did what.  Again, in a movie where emotions are the beginning, why are they so easily ignored?
When first finding information on this movie, I was a little excited.  Maybe they would get it right this time, maybe gold could be struck twice.  It's not that difficult a formula.  It just seems that they missed the point again.",986601600,3,2989,4.5722326454033775

I am truly sorry I did.
This movie r0x0rs. I was totally impressed with Eric Mabius' portrail of Alex. I really like the Crow v2.0 with all the new powers and dramatic actions. If they keep up with this good of upgrades to the Crow character itself, I will keep watching, though no one will top Brandon Lee or Eric Mabius' performances.

The local media is hot on the story watching the event unfold. 3 years later, he's sentenced to death via electric chair. There to witness Alex's dismissal is Lauren's sister, Erin and her brother, Nathan. For his last words, he states that he still loves Lauren and is innocent before they begin the execution.

During the electrocution, a lightning bolt strikes the generator, overriding the electricity, mercilessly frying Alex to a crisp. Just as the previous films had done, not long after Alex's death, he is resurrected from the dead by the ever mysterious crow, gifting him with supernatural abilities. From there, Alex sets out to hunt down who was really responsible for Lauren's murder and who framed him. His search will lead to him shockingly unveiling a web of corruption and deception.

Overall: Most people don't have too many good things to say about the batch of Crow films made, following the legendary 1994 classic, but Salvation really wasn't bad at all. In fact, compared to the one that came after this, many should appreciate this one. Salvation is an enigmatic, fast-paced, dramatic-action like-film, which is what the Crow series is supposed to be all about. Eric Mabius steals the show with his award winning performance, really playing up on the dark, raging emotions his character had lurking deep within him. Kirsten Dunst who was the second main character in this film had a fair performance but it wasn't necessarily anything to shout home about. The story sort of returned to the dark, vengeful elements, contained in the first Crow installation that the 1996 sequel sort of lacked in a comme ci, comme ca way. Overall, The Crow: Salvation is a gem in the Crow series and---behind the first film, is the only one in the Crow series to really have an impact",1451606400,,1979,4.869436201780416
