8637216,5,B00HXKPXPW,"Wow, this workout is HARD!!  I'm not the fittest person in the world, no ripped abs here, but I try to workout at least 5 days a week.  I'm a mom with 2 little kids who works full time and tries to fit hard workouts in the shortest amount of time as possible to get the best results.  I just don't have time for workouts that are longer than 30-40 minutes, though I wish I did.  This workout has everything you need!  First, it will get your butt moving and you sweat.  Each workout consists of 3 minutes of body weight training, 2 minutes of heavy weights, and 1 minute of high cardio for a total of 6 minutes.  Each segment is hard and the best part, it is NOT boring!  I get so tired of the same workout that is repeated 2x in 30 minutes.  This is not it!  Each move is unique and challenging at the same time.

If you were to do the entire 62 minute workout, more power to you, but the best part of the workout is you can choose your own workout from the main menu.  So you could do  segments that include butt, back and plank or something similar.  This makes it so you can tailor your workout for your own schedule and make it 30 minutes or 45 or whatever!  I do alot of workout DVDs and like to rotate between workouts such as kettlebells (Lauren Brooks) or Beachbody (Hard Corps or Chisel).  This one will definitely be going in the rotation.

The only cons I would say is that if you are beginner this is definitely not for you.  The moves are intermediate/advanced and very fast paced.  There is not explanation of how to do them so you have to be careful about not hurting yourself (ie lower back).  I'm not a big fan of plyometrics and this did have a little jumping up and down (tuck jumps) but could easily be modified. There are some core workouts such as planks but I wish there was one section dedicated to some heavy ab workout.

Other than that I love this workout and will be adding it to my rotation on a weekly basis!  If you did this workout a few times a week, there is no doubt you would see results with a sensible diet.",1469404800,,2046,4.1395939086294415
