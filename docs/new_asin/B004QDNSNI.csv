8438057,4,B004QDNSNI,What I loved the most was the singing of Furlanetto.,1518825600,,52,4.3
8438058,5,B004QDNSNI,"Yes, Dmitri Tcherniakov is a bad boy, an enfant terrible, an ultra regie of the opera world. Supposedly. This was my first experience with the directorial ""monster."" This 2009 Paris Macbeth was, according to veteran bass Ferrucio Furlanetto, in the May 2013 Opera News, ""the worst experience I have had in this business."" The Banquo in this performance said he ""detested"" the production, felt he prostituted himself doing it and wouldn't ever work with Tcherniakov again.

OK, can't wait to see this one. One day it was on my library shelf, I borrowed it, watched it twice and simply, was bowled over. And I'm usually not too fond of ""Eurotrash"" or whatever you want to call controversial, novel opera interpretations. Well, when you have such compelling acting and singing, even from the outstanding Paris Opera Chorus, combined with electrifying conducting from Teodor Currentzis - whether inspired by Verdi, Tcherniakov or whatever - it goes a long way to making this performance in my view, extremely moving.

Tcherniakov updated the opera to modern suburbia, with all the houses looking the same. Scenes are either in an inner courtyard or inside a house. With Macbeth a universal story, this does not bother me, when it is so well done. Tcherniakov has a penetrating mind with strong ideas and psychological insights about the opera. He makes the drama very real and emotionally compelling. Not much is subdued yet it is not overdone either. Here are real flesh and blood people acting out the drama in Tcherniakov's idiosyncratic way. I found it gripping.

When the crowd is plotting Banquo's murder, he is surprisingly right there, with people mockingly pointing at him, jabbing sardonically at his ribs, as if there's nothing he can do about it. There isn't, of course, and the idea that he knows what is coming adds a poignancy, an extra level of drama that is compelling. The processional march of King Duncan is never seen; instead of viewing the usual trite display of pomp and ceremony we see an unctious Duncan being hosted by the Macbeths and a group of political sycophants. This makes somewhat banal music match the goings on in the Macbeth's house, and strengthens the entire scene with some delicious sarcasm.

The sledgehammer pounding on the walls and destruction of Macbeth's living room in the finale are startling and extremely effective. His world has indeed crumbled. During Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking scene, she is dressed in pyjamas and a top hat. It may sound silly but with such concentrated acting it works marvelously. OK, so the witches with their facial hair - always a difficult group to depict - are portrayed by modern women in their coats and dresses. It mildly bothered me at first but I got used to it; it fit with Tcherniakov's ideas. Unibrows on the Barcelona Macbeth may be more authentic but it didn't sway me any more than this. The 2007 Met DVD even sees the witches as bag ladies.

Lady Macbeth is expertly portrayed by Violeta Urmana. She has all the vocal goods for the part and produces a smooth, even sound with vocal resplendence throughout the role's range. Through Tcherniakov's idea of the character, Urmana seems decidedly more at home as a dominating hausfrau than she has on less compelling lead portrayals in Un Ballo in Maschera and La Forza del Destino on DVD.

Dimitris Tiliakos bring his warm, inviting, somewhat light baritone to Macbeth and gives a rich, unmannered portrayal, with expressive eyes and strong acting. The final scene finds him at times rolling around on a small round table in his living room, dressed in underwear, a crumpled, unbuttoned white dress shirt, loosened tie and sports jacket. Sounds uninviting? Well, this isn't the proverbial walk in the park. Somehow it fits and it works. He has lost his marbles and it is very evident here. We are made uncomfortable as we should be.

Furlanetto may have hated the production, but he is a consummate pro and plays along with what Tcherniakov wants, in addition to singing superbly. When his murder is being plotted right in front of his eyes, Furlanetto's bloodless expression and chilling body language are marvelous; his sense of tragic confusion and loss masterfully elevates the scene.

The chorus has a significant role in Macbeth, and here they are extremely evocative, adding layers of meaning and richness to the drama. How naturally and comfortably they all look and act. Gone here are the days of the immovable, stagnant chorus giving a uniform, choir-like performance devoid of drama. During Macduff's public grieving over the loss of his wife and children, OK, he is in a playpen, and yes, this sounds silly. Somehow, not only does it work and make more than a semblance of sense (he has indeed lost his family) but the strong acting and genuine grieving of the community - the chorus - adds reality and immense power to the scene. Ironically, one quick glance here finds a man eating a sandwich. We all grieve (or don't grieve) in our own way. But we don't always act the same. More reality here.

Some other novel ideas (or quirks to the unconvinced) are the many scenes being framed onstage by a large rectangle, only occasionally seen on the video. Watching this on my TV gave it a second frame, and curiously, added focus to the drama. I could imagine at the Paris Opera feeling that this helped concentrate the action. Another different idea I was less fond of was the mesh net in front of seemingly most scenes. This is not at all the sharpest of pictures (at least on the DVD I saw) and you can occasionally even see the net. I would have liked more visual clarity and brilliance. The google earth views from afar zooming directly to the town where the action takes place are curiously, both mildly distracting and slightly inviting. They neither add nor subtract to my impression of what I'm seeing. I got used to them.

Conductor Teodor Currentzis is a new name to me. He is chief conductor of the Novosibirsk Opera, which co-produced this with the Paris Opera. His direction is dynamic, full of detail, nuance and thrust. Crisply led with outstanding orchestral execution, this is as well conducted a Macbeth as I have heard. Please more Verdi (and Russian opera) from him.

An all-out winner then. Take note: the Metropolitan Opera has engaged Tcherniakov to make his Met debut, directing Prince Igor in spring, 2014. This will be simulcast on Saturday, March 1. It should be interesting, to say the least.",1369699200,6,6464,4.856624319419238
8438059,1,B004QDNSNI,"First there is the frequently unsynched lips and video especially when the chorus sings.  Second there is this terrible gold hue throughout like everyone has yellow jaundice.  Then there is the CHEAP set that looks like cardboard.  Then there is the smearing of imagings frequently observed as people move their heads.  HD????  Really?  Recording of the singers sounds like they are either the worst in the opera world or they used Radio Shack microphones.  The orchestra - very uninspired.

There is a ton more to be disappointed in but suffice it to say I feel it is the worst injustice ever paid to a Verdi Opera.  As a former member of the Kennedy Center Opera House Orchestra I can tell you this is worse than any rehearsal readthrough I have ever heard of Macbeth.  Arghhhh....",1317254400,3,783,4.733333333333333
8438060,3,B004QDNSNI,"The Moscow-born stage director Dmitri Tcherniakov, still in his 30s at the time of this 2009 Paris Opera production, had his hands around something interesting here, and it isn't so much that it slips through his fingers as that he squeezes too hard. When I had taken in only the first act, I felt I was seeing a truly great MACBETH, and the five-star review was beginning to come together in my head. But my final verdict was that Tcherniakov had failed to heed the directing equivalent of that old piece of advice given to women about looking themselves in the mirror and removing one accessory before leaving the house. This is a very mannered piece of work, and a little of it goes a long way. The initial promise ultimately curdles, and I cannot say I expect to give this a second viewing anytime soon, although, as will become apparent below, there are decided strengths.

Verdi's opera has been transplanted to what I believe is the mid-20th century. Half of the scenes take place in a sparely furnished drawing room with a chandelier and fireplace, the other half in a sort of town square under a streetlight. Google Earth projections cover the transitions. There is a strong basic concept: evil and good are not overtly distinguishable; they coexist and intermingle in a mass of ordinary humanity. There is nothing at all threatening or strange about the witches or assassins; they are just faces in a crowd of ordinary, multicultural citizens (and there are some great faces here among the choristers and supers). The Macbeths are seemingly innocuous upper-middle-class strivers within a corrupting system. Lady M is intriguingly conceived as a childless middle-aged woman who endearingly directs her maternal impulses toward her husband and others in whom she senses need, trivial or otherwise -- she hypocritically draws Duncan's mourners to her bosom, and is even adjusting the doctor's collar and tie in the sleepwalking scene. Once her part in the drama is done, Macbeth, deprived of his mother/""fixer"" figure, is notably disheveled, and sings the final act sans pants, with much of ""Piet, rispetto, amore"" delivered from a fetal position on the dining-room table.

Like many mod Regietheater practitioners, Tcherniakov seems distrustful of stagy conventions such as the aria as a private outpouring. So, for example, the news contained in Macbeth's letter of Act I Scene 2 is delivered in person by the man himself, who remains onstage for the Missus's ""Vieni t'affretta."" As often when this kind of change is perpetrated, I felt it was just trading one brand of clunk for another -- since Lady Macbeth's aria is now aimed *at* him, the baritone has to stand around and perform an awkward dumb-show, furiously shaking his head ""no"" and so on. When we reach the point where his traditional entrance occurs at ""Oh, donna mia!"" for the first ""real"" husband/wife scene, Tcherniakov has already burned through a lot of his leads' interpersonal repertoire, and so everyone is locked into repetition. Similarly, Banquo and Fleance are on stage for the assassins' plotting in Act II Scene 2; the former hears everything and plays the scene as though he wants to believe he is being harmlessly teased, but is beginning to realize otherwise. It is an interesting choice, but the execution is clumsy, and some bumpy video editing in the actual murder sequence does not help (throughout the opera, there are distracting lapses in the shot-sequencing and rhythm).

Tcherniakov's most successful emendation is his staging of Verdi's (intentionally, I think) insipid march heralding the arrival of King Duncan. Rather than a simple royal procession across the stage, we get a view through the Macbeths' picture window of a little unscripted sketch. An actor whose appearance and mannerisms suggest a bantamweight Mussolini plays Duncan, delivering inaudible dialogue and acting the part of the puffed-up bad guest to the hilt. He makes what probably are demeaning remarks, removes Lady Macbeth's glasses and struts around wearing them, juts out his jaw and laughs loudly at his own jokes. The Macbeths and Duncan's royal entourage respond to this with the kind of stiff bearing and forced smiles one sees when an obnoxious boor's position and influence dictate obeisance. Far less effective, and the low point of the whole undertaking, is Act IV Scene 1, for Macduff and the refugees. The scene may have survived the conceit of everyone clutching one salvaged possession (a deer head, a butterfly collection, et cetera). It may even have survived the idea of having the tenor sing ""Ah, la paterno mano"" in a playpen filled with toys (yes, I get that his children have been murdered and this playpen is the cherished thing he managed to take with him, but would he actually be *in* the thing, looking like a 40-year-old baby?). But it can't survive all of that *and* the risible slashing/fist-pumping gestures the chorus is asked to carry out in ""La patria tradita."" I'm stumped as to whether Tcherniakov was trying for parody there, or he, like his Lady Macbeth, has a compulsion to straighten collars and fix ties whether they need it or not. I tend to suspect the latter. It also must be said that this director seemingly cannot abide quiet, or resist an opportunity for extraneous noise. Among several examples: In the masterly concertato that follows the discovery of Duncan's body, he must puncture one of Verdi's silences with the loud sobbing of some old lady (is she supposed to be Mrs. Duncan?), and he tops that by concluding ""Ove son io?"" with Macbeth running around the town square repeatedly firing a pistol.

Since her early-aughts gear-change from mezzo to soprano, I have usually found the Lithuanian Violeta Urmana to be a hard-working, reliable, but unexciting singer who has all the notes but not much flair. Such was the case with her Aidas at the Met and La Scala as well as the Florence Leonora (FORZA), all on DVD. This Lady Macbeth is in a different league. It is one of her best performances, and one of the best reasons to see and hear this MACBETH at least once. Tcherniakov's domesticated notions for the character work wonderfully with the singer's low-wattage temperament, and her singing as such is accurate, powerful, and stylish. It is probably intentional that she is so unflatteringly costumed: appealingly homey early on in her cardigan, glasses, and tortoise-shell hair clip, but later packed into a too-tight ""elegant"" evening dress, and still later performing the sleepwalking scene in carelessly buttoned pajamas and the silk top hat with which she had performed conjuring tricks during the Brindisi. Baritone Dimitris Tiliakos sounds a size too small, but muscles a more effective Macbeth out of his pretty lyric baritone than we might suspect initially, and certainly acts the part well. Ferrucio Furlanetto is a luxurious Banquo. Stefano Secco's tenor is somewhat short of the goods that would be required to make a strong impression given the unfortunate staging of his big number. Yuri Kissin doubles, excellently, as the Servant and Medic, and Letitia Singleton makes a lovely Dama, on whom the video director understandably lingers a lot.

Maestro Teodor Currentzis, also still in his 30s, gets exceptional work from the Paris Opera Orchestra and Chorus -- driven yet nimble, angular in line and vibrant of color. His performing edition interpolates Macbeth's swan song ""Mal per me"" from the 1847 Urtext before returning to the 1865 revision for the stirring final chorus of liberation. This goes against the composer's wishes, but gives us an opportunity to hear a quality solo absent from most of the audio and video performances of MACBETH.",1315612800,9,7691,5.024294670846395
8438061,1,B004QDNSNI,"The mosquito noise dots actually seem to be part of the staging, caused by a fine gauze screen at the front of the stage. This is often used in stage productions for light diffusion (Glyndebourne Tristan, Munich & Hamburg Poulenc), but rarely throughout a whole opera. The dots are eye-catching when performers are filmed in close-up. This isn't HD-conform.",1307836800,6,357,5.067796610169491
8438062,5,B004QDNSNI,"Dmitri Tcherniakov (now there's a name to strike fear into the heart of every lover of traditional opera stagings) comes up with an interesting concept for this 2009 production for the Paris Opera.  He sees the Scottish play in terms of a kind of American Beauty satire of modern life, with GoogleEarth-style 3-D overhead projections zooming into the map of a small surburban town, where we are treated to a peak through the windows into the drawing room of one particular moderately wealthy middle-class family.  There erupts a power battle of social climbing, domestic disputes, vanity and a mid-life identity crisis that culminates in moral, social and personal breakdown.

That's all very well, but Macbeth is Macbeth and American Beauty is American Beauty, and I imagine that some people would rather that the two remain entirely separate entities - except Verdi's Macbeth was never really Shakespeare in the first place.  Verdi does revenge and revolution well, and he also does drawing room melodrama well (it's hard to beat La Traviata for that), and it's hard to see Verdi's Macbeth - which is certainly more domestic than political - as anything other than a Verdi opera, resounding with cries of ""Vendetta!"".  In the Italian translation, there's little of Shakespeare's poetry here (although the English subtitles do attempt to bring it back to the source drama), so if it's all right for Verdi to adapt it to his favourite themes, isn't it ok for Tcherniakov to adapt it in a way that it relates to a modern-day audience?

Well, evidently that's for the individual to decide, but although it's not without its problems, this production of Macbeth is spectacularly staged and sung, with real feeling for the piece and the underlying psychology that it exposes.  Principally, there are only two real sets, one for the drawing room drama, the other for the people of the revolution (the people and the three witches converted into a kind of neighbourhood watch) - which perfectly captures the Verdian division of the essence of the drama.  The sets are simple, but imaginatively employed, with dark clouds projected over the street scenes, the 3-D graphics superb for all the scene-setting that is required, and the drama within them is brilliantly and effectively staged.  Banco's death, for example, avoids all the usual on-stage dramatic clich&eacute;s, and he is found left slumped on the ground as a whirlwind of people disperse.

Whether you buy into the staging or not, the performances are absolutely marvellous.  Dimitris Tiliakos' beautifully soft-toned baritone and his sensitive acting performance (again no opera theatrics here) make for a complex and nuanced Macbeth, working in perfect coordination with an equally intriguing Violeta Urmana, who also avoids all the usual Lady Macbeth clich&eacute;s and even manages a few conjouring tricks while singing with conviction and personality.  Furruccio Furlanetto, in duffel coat, is a superb Banco and Teodor Currentzis conducts the Paris orchestra through a powerful and dynamic rendition of the opera, which is as it should be.

Although quite minimalist, Tcherniakov's set causes some problems with audio and video reproduction, but the issues are relatively minor.  With much of it taking place within a box on the stage, the sound isn't always as dynamic as it could be, and the choruses aren't quite as full-bodied as you might like, but the detail is there and the impact is fully achieved with a definite woomph to those big Verdi moments.  The staging also takes place behind a fine mesh screen, which slightly softens the image (although it suits the tone and lighting of this production), but the netting is only really evident in close-up and is not a major problem.  The disc also includes an excellent 32 minute feature which gives a good idea of the ideas and personalities behind the production, with interviews and rehearsal footage.",1307664000,8,3921,5.112676056338028
