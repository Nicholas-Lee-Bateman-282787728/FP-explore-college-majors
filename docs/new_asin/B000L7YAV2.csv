8160313,5,B000L7YAV2,"I have only watched the Mind Games segment so far but am looking forward to the rest of the series. Mind Games focuses on the cognitive development of a theory of mind in children and how this is the basis for developing effective social interactions. The research behind the information is sound and the presentation is a lot of fun. I show portions of this to my college students and they love these funny, honest kids and the fun way in which the research is depicted. The video uses real play behavior and mini-interviews from children to explain the Theory of Mind, which is described as the first step in understanding others thoughts (a deficit area for children with Autism). Once we become ""mind readers"" we start to understand others' thoughts, likes, and outlooks, and can use this ability socially. For example, a developed theory of mind can help us figure out how to make others feel good or bad about themselves or how to pick out a present someone else would like. Sit back and enjoy this one - it is fun, funny, and based on sound research in the developmental psychology field.",1224547200,2,1095,4.649484536082475
8160314,5,B000L7YAV2,"It's very difficult to describe how valuable this video set is for teachers and parents. I teach Early Childhood Education classes to high school students who may want to become teachers. I have developed an understanding of the early stages of my own children and have been able to pass on a depth of understanding of young children's development that is unparalleled...simply by showing this well planned and scripted series. I only wish there was a sequel!
