8416988,5,B004648VZ2,"We love these DVDs! We had gone to a promotional event at our local Jewish Community Center and saw one episode and loved it. They are perfect for Jews of any denomination. I love that my children are learning about Israel, holidays and Hebrew from the makers of Sesame Street and with the great characters from it! I would recommend for any Jewish family!",1318118400,,356,4.578125
8416989,5,B004648VZ2,"I really enjoyed ""Mitzvah on the Street.""  Although I have enjoyed the entire Shalom Sesame series to date, my favorite DVDs have been the ones based on the holidays rather than general themes.  ""Mitzvah on the Street,"" however, is the best children's DVD I have ever seen.

The episode has singing by the characters who all have beautiful voices--(I wonder why they don't sing more in the other episodes?).  It also shows a little boy volunteering at the Jerusalem zoo--a place where I have never visited but will surely put on my itinerary the next time I travel to Israel.

The episode also shows kids the importance of mitzvot, such as cleaning up trash from the street, taking care of lost animals, and visiting the sick.  It also introduces a few new Hebrew letters and the number 18.

At the end of the episode, there is a scene with Matisyahu, an Israeli musician, which is really cute.  I had never before heard someone make percussion sounds with their mouth, especially to the tune of Hava Negillah.  You have to get the DVD to watch it!",1303171200,2,1048,4.621621621621622
8416990,5,B004648VZ2,"This was just what I was looking for.  Very good for when you are starting to outgrow Oy Baby, or you just need some new songs to get stuck in your head.  This is formated like a regular Sesame Street.  It features the letters chaph and kaf, the number shmonah esrei, the month Cheshvan, as well as having skits and cartoons around the theme of mitzvot.  The producers seemed to have been very careful to make the explanations of Jewish concepts compatible with a range of levels of Jewish observance.",1295308800,5,501,4.533333333333333
