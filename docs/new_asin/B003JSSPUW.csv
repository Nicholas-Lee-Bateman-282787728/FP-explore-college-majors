4131359,3,B003JSSPUW,"Points off for the incorrect aspect ratio listed on package for Pinocchio. The case reads 2.4; 1 aspect ratio, when the film is presented in 4:3. (This means a portion of the image is cut off.) The opening and ending credits are in letterbox widescreen, but then shifts to Full Screen.

Pretty much only bought this collection for Pinocchio, a childhood favorite of mine. The single disc version costs and arm and a leg brand new, so this collection was a better alternative.  Although JTT feels a bit out of place, this is a fun and memorable version of the story that's stuck around with me for 20 years. The other movies are of little interest to me, but they are not bad flicks.",1466035200,,682,4.491935483870968
4131360,5,B003JSSPUW,"This version of Pinocchio is one of my favorites and I have seen many. Excellent performances by all the stars. The storyline is familiar to all but this one is entertaining and moving. Loved it. Dennis the Menace was an orgy of cuteness. Cats Don't Dance is a nice musical cartoon. It has some nice tunes. Camelot is mildly entertaining with a so-so storyline.
But the purchase is worth it for Pinocchio, alone.",1461888000,,412,4.657534246575342

8398443,4,B003JSSPUW,"I purchased this mainly for Quest for Camelot. The other movies are not on my kid's wishlust to see, but the combo was a better price than the indovidual movie. Overall glad to have a few additional movies.
