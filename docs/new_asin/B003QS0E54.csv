4171685,4,B003QS0E54,"If you love the Hunter Series and enjoy having entire sets, this product will deliver.  However, this is the cheesiest, cheapest, crappiest DVD set I have purchased! (MIAMI VICE- THE COMPLETE SERIES was the last set I had purchased, so naturally I am disappointed!) The quality of the picture is good, considering this was produced mid 1980's and restored so we can have it.  I have absolutely NO COMPLAINT there.
  I am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED with the packaging, and the lay-out.  All 28 discs come in one flimsy plastic case that measures approximately 7 1/2"" long, 5 1/2"" wide, and 2"" thick (It is definitely a space saver!).  Each of the DVD's come in a black PAPER sleeve with a clear cellophane circular window where you can view the Season #, along with the episodes that are contained on that particular disc.  The seasons are printed in different colors so you CAN tell them apart.  All of the discs are stacked into ONE tight pile within the outer plastic casing. These are single sided discs, with the Season and Episode titles printed  on the opposite  side. There are NO EPISODE listings anywhere on the packaging.  When viewing the Menu, the titles are NUMBERED and LISTED on each disc.
  On the POSITIVE, I love watching FRED DRYER and STEPHANIE KRAMER in this series. I think they have GREAT CHEMISTRY, are adorable, and are a pleasure and joy to watch.
I tend to gravitate to the TV Series of the 1980's because I enjoy seeing REAL PEOPLE who have NATURAL BODY PARTS, some character lines on their faces, without face lifts, unnaturally glowing-white bleached teeth, blown-up trout-pout lips, fake breasts etc.  I guess I'm just old-fashioned, and proud to be this way!  Anyway, I'm glad to have the complete series in my possession and I would still buy it again, even with the crappy packaging.
  Hope some of you will find this information helpful as you're considering purchasing this set.",1280620800,142,1910,4.792048929663609
4171686,4,B003QS0E54,"There seems to be a lot of curiousity and strong feelings regarding the upcoming set of Hunter: The Complete Series on DVD from Mill Creek Entertainment, so I wanted to stop by and share my experiences with it.

On Tuesday July 20, I interviewed the VP of Product Acquisitions from Mill Creek about Hunter and a bunch of their other releases (including his attempt to get the BATMAN TV series on DVD), and we also took fan questions about Hunter.

I've also personally reviewed a copy of the set and posted my findings at [...].  I can't say that every episode is completely uncut.  In fact, I'm sure that's not the case.  However, a large number of episodes clock in at the 47-48 minute mark, which does seem to be a complete episode for an hour show from the 1980s.  The pilot is also most likely complete as it comes in at over 95 minutes for a two-hour timeslot.

However, I can tell you that while the DVD may not have the cuts in footage that cable does to add more commercials, there are cuts for music purposes.  The Chaka Khan episode has all her singing edited out.  It doesn't affect the story at all, however.  You should know that Mill Creek did NOT do any editing on its own on these episodes for ANY reason.  Any cuts or music substitutions that were made were done by Stephen J. Cannell Productions because of the extreme high cost of licensing music for DVD releases.

The versions of Hunter that are on this DVD are basically the ""new, official"" versions that the public will see whether it be on DVD, online, or in syndication unless the cost for music rights comes down.  It's as simple as that.  It's either this or nothing.  Don't bother to wait hoping for a new set with all the original music because that's simply not going to happen.

To hear the story in Mill Creek's own words, check out my interview with them at [...] and you can also read my extended review of the Hunter DVD set, which includes detailed pictures of the packaging inside the case and a full rundown of each Hunter episode with its running time so you can judge for yourselves the completeness of each episode.

In our honest opinion, having actually had the set in our hands for review, we can give it four stars because Mill Creek did the best they could do with it, and they brought it in at a very fair price even if you do have the previous single-season releases.

You can also check out my [...] interview to hear Mill Creek talk about whether they will be releasing the seasons in separate box sets.",1279756800,89,2504,4.4183006535947715
4171687,3,B003QS0E54,"I'm glad that they finally have all 7 Seasons for me to watch complete & uncut but it seems as if they're trying to overcompensate for the remaining 4 Seasons they haven't released on individual season DVD box sets yet which I've been dying to see especially during todays sluggish economy.

Therefore I will have to pay a lot of money to be able to watch the remaining 4 Seasons throughout this over-the-top police drama whole 1984-91 run on NBC.

On the other hand, it will be interesting to finally be able to also see the episodes from Hunter's 7th Season when the tough-as-nails ex-Marine Vietnam veteran now maverick police detective Sgt. Hunter(Fred Dryer) gets his first new partner Officer Joanne Molenski(Darlanne Fluegel) in the Fall of 1990 after Hunter's 1st partner Sgt. Dede McCall(Stephanie Kramer)departed the show in the Spring of 1990 and also being able to watch episodes from the 2nd half of Hunter's 1990-91 Season when Molenski gets replaced by his 3rd, last and sexy partner Sgt. Christine Novak(Lauren Lane)in the Winter of 1991 before it tanked after it's 7-year run on NBC.

So now that I'm hearing some mixed reviews about this HUNTER DVD box set, I'm now starting to wonder if its worth paying the high price for this item or not & I'm I'm going to get my moneys worth and if this complete series box set of HUNTER will actually be uncut like most classic television show box sets are since some of the reviews I'm reading about this DVD box set are negative with skeptical critics.

This complete series DVD of HUNTER has some pros and cons to it.
The Pros are I've finally got a chance to see some episodes from the last 4 seasons of this police drama when Hunter & McCall went from being maverick homicide detectives from the fictional Metropolitan Police Dept. in Los Angeles to being street-savvy police investigators from the LAPD at Parker Center Division in Downtown L.A., including the episodes with Hunter's new partners Novak & Molenski which weren't too shabby either, despite the fact that this series went downhill when Stephanie Kramer departed the show in May of 1990 to pursue her singing career, despite the fact that rumor had it that Kramer(McCall) and Dryer(Hunter)had some rivalry behind the set just like Erik Estrada(Ponch)and Larry Wilcox(Jon)did since Wilcox and Estrada didn't get along well in real life behind the scenes on the police drama CHiPs either which led to Wilcox's departure from CHiPs in the Spring of 1982 which contributed to CHiPs taking a nose-dive in the ratings when Jon was replaced by Ponch's new partner Officer Bobby Nelson(Tom Reilly) in the Fall of 1982 which contributed to CHiPs cancellation in the Summer of 1983 just like the departure of McCall resulted in HUNTER's cancellation in the Summer of 1991, due to a sharp decline in ratings.

Something else that didn't make a lot of sense to me is in HUNTER's 7th and final season was Hunter, Novak, Molenski, and Devane kept saying that they were LAPD detectives stationed at Metro Division, but they always only showed Parker Center in Downtown Los Angeles as the outside of their police station just like they always did in Hunter's 6th Season which was McCall's last year on the show by using the exact same setting inside and outside the police station.

The Cons are this DVD box set has no Closed Captioning on it, unlike the individual DVD box sets of Season 1, Season 2, and Season 3 of HUNTER that were released by Anchor Bay years ago.

In addition to that, I agree with Gary Wilcox, T. Hawkins, and Laurie from Sacramento about the DVD discs being poorly packaged and difficult to get out and put back too, plus this DVD box set done by Mill Creek still has the introductory credits to Hunter's 2nd Season all screwed up since they didn't use the proper introduction to any of Hunter's 1985-86 Season episodes that was actually used on their original air-dates on NBC either since they used the introduction to Hunters 1984-85 Season instead just like Anchor Bay did and just like they were shown in reruns on TV Land, unlike the rest of this police dramas seasons.

Additionally, like Terry said in his review Mill Creek also took out all the original songs that were played in each episodes and replaced them with different less desirable songs just like Anchor Bay and TV Land did with them, which really bites along with the fact that none of the DVD discs had a picture of Hunter with Molenski either, just Hunter with Novak even on the 1990-91 Season episodes when Molenski was Hunter's partner before Novak even came aboard as Hunter's newest partner, but all the discs from the first 6 seasons had a picture of Hunter with McCall though, but I still think the discs with all the episodes from the first half of Hunter's 7th Season episodes with Molenski in them should've had a picture of Molenski with Hunter instead of all the 1990-91 Season discs episodes having Novak only on them, despite the fact that Novak was the best looking of all 3 of Hunter's partners, despite the fact that this show bit the dust after McCall's departure.

So now that Mill Creek came up with this idea to make a complete series DVD box set of HUNTER instead of releasing the remaining last 4 seasons of this police dramas 1984-91 year run on NBC, I'm anxious to see if Warner Bros. or any other DVD company will end up releasing the remaining 4 seasons of CHiPs since Warner Bros. only has the first 2 seasons of CHiPs released out on DVD and hasn't released any more individual season box sets since June of 2008 since I've been dying for them to release the last 4 seasons of CHiPs on DVD for over 2 years now, starting with CHiPs 3rd Season which was it's 1979-80 Season on NBC.",1279756800,5,5716,4.673956262425447
4171688,1,B003QS0E54,"Miles Creek needs to put the seasons out induvidualy. I bought the first 3 put out by Anchor Bay in 2005 & 2006. To me this would be a rip-off for the studios to put out only a few seasons then come out with the complete series. I have already invested $90.00 in my 3 Seasons and now you can get all 7 under $90 something needs to be done about this. Just another Con from the studios. Also if I was to purchase this complete set, I could not get anyone to buy the 3 seasons I originaly purchase so I just loose money.",1279411200,10,518,3.942857142857143
4171689,5,B003QS0E54,I met Stephen Cannell at a book signing a year ago and asked him when are you going to release the rest of the Hunter series.  He said it was coming and he delivered.  The only thing that stinks is I have seasons 1-3.  Great series.,1278979200,,232,4.0
4171690,5,B003QS0E54,"NETFLIX is a great service (highly recommended) but is NOT the answer for the Hunter series. Why?:

1. NETFLIX has only offered the first 2 seasons.
2. The Anchor Bay version on NETFLIX right now is so fragile/cheap I've had to send CD's back 5 times to complete all the episodes on those individual CDs.  (I never have this problem with other CDs from NETFLIX.)

When this new product comes out, it will be nice to have a reliable new CD where episodes will not be stopped by messages about the DISC being damaged or unreadable. It will also be convenient to have the whole series together,  especially where a 2 part episode happens to fall on separate DISCs (example ""The Beautiful and the Dead"" episode).",1278633600,7,708,4.595238095238095
4171691,5,B003QS0E54,"After waiting for more than 10 years, finally I'll be able to watch the best cop show ever. Thank you!!!

Yes, the package has arrived and I'm very satisfied. ""Hunter"" was, at its time, a great cop show, and still is. Plus, it's interesting to see Hunter and McCall using phone booths and phones at the victim's houses, and the laboratory guy testing type of blood instead of DNA...

Also, I liked the set with all seasons in a cheap package; what I want is to watch the show, and not any ""extras""; I wish all TV shows were sold like that, I'd buy a lot more of them, not just my absolute favorites.",1278201600,4,599,4.245614035087719

Mill Creek Entertainment

Good Morning The masters of the episodes that were provided to Mill Creek Entertainment by the producers are the syndicated versions.  With regards to the music issues surrounding the Hunter television series, the majority of the programs contain the original music as it was broadcast.  There are some episodes where the original songs were removed by the producer for reasons unidentified to Mill Creek.

4171693,4,B003QS0E54,"I wrote a review BEFORE this DVD Set was released, praising the idea of having ALL Seasons available in one set of DVDs.  That's a great idea, I just wish more TV Series would be released that way.  Now as far as this set of DVDs is concerned, since it's been released . . . . .
EXTREMELY poor packaging.  All 28 DVDs are all jammed together and are very  difficult to separate or to even select a single DVD from all the others that are piled on top of each other in flimzy paper covers. As far as the quality is concerned, it's about a 7 or 8 on a scale of 10 (if you are watching these DVDs on a 55"" screen or larger). On a smaller TV screen, the quality looks a little better, but it's certainly no where near anything like watching an HD DVD.  (Yeah, I know it's NOT an HD DVD set, but I truly thought that the quality would be a little better than it is). The quality was much better when this series was released by Mill Creek Entertainment. I'm giving it 4 STARS, mainly because it's a great TV series, PLUS, they released ALL DVDs together in one set. I'd give it 5 STARS if the quality was as good as the Mill Creek Edition.  I still highly recommend this DVD set, and I'm truly glad I bought it, even though I did purchased the 3 Mill Creek editions when they were released a few years ago.",1277942400,11,1301,4.0625
4171694,5,B003QS0E54,"The first 3 seasons of Hunter were released a few years ago, and then like many of my other favorites, the releases just stopped.  I don't think the studios realize that this makes many consumers a little shy to begin to purchase a new show, for fear they may not get the entire set.  I have several ""partial collections"" of shows that have just stopped being released for reasons unknown to the common man.  It is very sad that many great classics such as Gunsmoke, The Love Boat, Night Court, Mama's Family, and countless others have been cut after only one or more seasons, yet we are bombarded with junk being released every day that is barely entertainment- then again look at what is considered prime time TV today.

Hunter was one of my favorite shows growing up and I am glad to see that Mill Creek came up with the intelligent idea of releasing the entire series.  A serious fan will purchase this and be done with it.  Sure, the price is a little high, but you are getting 7 seasons and over 150 episodes.  Usually when the shows are broken up into seasons you end up paying more overall (This way equates to $12.85 a season.)  This way you know that you are getting the entire set- a fan does not have to wait forever at the mercy of some studio that is making billions of dollars to see his favorite shows.  As long as the DVD's are clean and contain all the episodes, I really don't care about all the extras that the studios load onto other DVD's, usually in an attempt to justify the high price.",1276646400,115,1510,4.364285714285714

Dear Anchor Bay Entertainment, please release a boxed set with EVERY episode and TV movie of this show.",1450656000,,437,4.891891891891892
4171703,4,B003QS0E54,"THE STORY: Rick Hunter, (played by former L.A. Rams football defensive end-turned actor Fred Dryer), is the son of a mobster. Hunter turned his back on the family business and joined ""the other side"" as an L.A. police homicide detective. In order to take down the creeps and clean up the streets Hunter does whatever it takes. This lone wolf attitude doesn't sit well with the big brass so they're always on his case - even though he gets results. To keep them off the scent, Hunter convinces hard-nosed undercover female detective Dee Dee McCall to be his partner. It's supposed to be a union of convenience so that their bosses will think the two are playing fair and leave them alone. They intend show up for roll call together and then go their own way during the day, meeting up again only at the end of the shift to compare notes & get their stories straight, and appease their superiors. The two are surprised to discover that they work quite well together. So much so that they decide to become legitimate partners... and the bad guys had better watch out!

THOUGHTS: The show was created as a direct response to cash in on the success of Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry films in general, and the big box office smash of SUDDEN IMPACT, (""Go ahead, make my day.""), in particular. 6' 6"" Freddie Dryer was a sizably impressive Eastwood clone, and the show's initial success was due to the unique mixture off that vibe combined with the flashy eye-candy stuntwork seen in The A-Team and other Stephen J. Cannell-produced shows. Starting with season three however, HUNTER was slowly re-tooled into more of a genuinely authentic police show instead of a Dirty Harry wannbe. Playing Hunter's partner for the first six seasons was beautiful brunette Stefanie Kramer, with her big 80's hairdo & equally big shoulder-padded suits. She was every bit as tough as Hunter and the two had excellent on-screen chemistry. She left at the end of season six to pursue a singing career and focus on her personal life. Season 7 saw two different partners for Hunter. Darlanne Fluegel played Joanne Miolenski during the first half of season seven. Rumor is that she & Dryer did not work well together however, and her character was killed off midway thru the season and Hunter ended up partnering with an ex-girlfriend, detective Chris Novak, played by Lauren Lane. Stylistic changes make season seven look different from the others. IMHO it's easily the weakest of the seasons and was a hollow way to end the series. Even so, HUNTER is a solid TV buddy-cop show, with an emphasis on two-fisted action, as Hunter bends (and often breaks) the rules in order to take down the bad guys and clean up the streets of L.A.

THE DVD BOX SET: One of TV's all-time best action-flavored detective shows, HUNTER: THE COMPLETE SERIES arrives in one sizable, 28 DVD set from Mill Creek. The outer master case is a woefully thin plastic job. The inside of the case is essentially hollow, with each disc stored separately inside coarse black construction paper sleeves (with crinkly envelope-style plastic windows, allowing you to see what disc number it is and the episode titles). This packaging fiasco really sucks The Big One. I would much rather have paid a few more dollars up front and gotten the seasons stored separately in their own multi-disc snapcase, with flipper insert trays for each DVD. Lemme tell ya, once you open this thing up, the guts sort of leap out like one of those joke snake-in-the-peanutcan thingamajigs. It is almost impossible to keep it closed once it's been opened. Another big negative is that the pop songs used throughout the series which were licensed for HUNTER when the show originally aired way back in the day, (like Jim Croce's ""Don't Mess Around With Jim"" in the S1 episode Dead or Alive), have now been replaced by crappy studio musician junk. This is a major bummer. Other countries, (England & Germany, for instance), have the episodes completely uncut & intact on their respective country's DVD releases. As for the video portion of the episodes themselves? They look OK but are definitely nothing to brag about. An average of 5 episodes are stuffed onto each single-sided disc, so there is some pixelation & artifacting throughout. The DVD disc menus let you play the whole disc or select individual episodes. Unfortunately the set contains ZERO bonus features. It would be terrific if Shout! Factory or another company picked up HUNTER and remastered it (and negotiated to get all the original songs put back in!) and released a high-def Blu-ray boxed set... but don't hold you breath. In the meantime, I'm glad to have the entire series as is, despite the problems. I hope that some day the short-lived sequel series from 2002 and the TV reunion movies can be released as well, perhaps in an all-inclusive COMPLETE COLLECTION of all things HUNTER. Then & now, HUNTER was a great show. Even with the numerous headaches this massive 28-disc boxset has, HUNTER: The Complete Series still ""Works for me!"" 4 STARS (5 for the show, minus 1 STAR for the packaging snafu, the missing songs, et.al.)",1449792000,2,5107,4.802272727272728

On both Season 2, disc #1 and Season 7, disc #2 the player stops paying about 3/4 of the way through the 3rd episode.  I would guess this is where the layer break is.  I tested all of the other discs and they were fine.  If this is a systemic problem, I suggest owners contact the manufacturer and lodge complaints.

These are just as poor a quality as it comes. It's sad when you can't even watch the first disc of a series all the way through.

I posted a picture above of how i received it to give you an idea. On 4 or 5 of these discs you can see in the right light, spots all over of these discs.

4171799,4,B003QS0E54,"Recently I bought a lot of complete series of different 80's & 90's TV shows.  What struck me odd about this complete series vs all the others is the way they presented the CD's.  You open the case, all 28 CD's are in a box on top of each other in a protective sleeve.  While I feel they are well protected in this manner, you can't easily access a certain show you want to view.

Also, if you viewed one CD, you can't easily put it back into its slot.  (as there is no slot)

In all the other series, they are mostly always presented so you can easily go to the case you want, then read the different shows in that case.  Then you open the case then select the correct DVD.  Also its easy to put the CD back into its slot when done viewing.  Different innovated  methods are used to do this.

I am surprised nobody has mentioned this or complained about it.  Perhaps if I didn't buy a lot of other full series I wouldn't know how they could present them and wouldn't find any fault with just putting the 28 CD's in a pile.

On the other side, the series is quite a bit cheaper then the others I got (as a rule).  So maybe that's the trade off.

4171807,4,B003QS0E54,"Mid-december 2011, Amazon had the wonderful idea to lower the price of the set to 30$, and it could be delivered to France.

Since I've been a fan of the show since the 80s and I'm a huge fan of Stepfanie Kramer (I maintain a fansite dedicated to her), I bought it as my self Xmas present, it was delivered in due time and in good conditions (minor plastic break on the packaging).

Sure the packaging is cheap but it's really a good deal at this price (even today at 40$) ... besides, what mattered to me was to get the whole set at a reasonable price, I don't really care about the packaging, I'm interested in what's inside! lol
It'll take me ages to test all the DVDs and even if some are defective, it's still a good deal. The sound is more than fine and I'd rate the video 8/10 which, for a show that age, is really a good catch.

As described before, many musics have been changed and the songs performed by Stepfanie Kramer have been dubbed and it's really horrendous but: 1) you can still find the original videos on youtube and 2) the cost would have prevented the set to be released.
So ok it's a shame and butcher work on Stepfanie's perf but we'll survive :p
And I really don't get the outside packaging, McCall was Hunter's partner for 6 seasons but she's not on it! Sure there are both on the DVDs but outside it's Dryer, and on the back you find Clooney/Estrada and Sammy Davis Jr ... really a shame!

But, all in all, I'm very happy with my purchase!
Honestly I wouldn't have bought it at 100$ but at 30/40$ that's really worth it! :D",1325635200,3,1551,4.247457627118644

I was definitely disappointed in the packaging of the set. It was cheaply done which is why my review is 4 stars instead of 5.  Basically it's a stack of DVDs (4 episodes per DVD) - each in individual paper sleeves. All 7 seasons are in one DVD case.

The cast was great, although I did hate to see Kramer leave the show.  I also enjoyed seeing guest starts like Ed O'Neil, Jesse Ventura, and Steven Williams. As for the quality of the discs, well mine played fine.  I watched each episode individually using episode select, so maybe that's a factor in playback quality.

Before, I say anything more, to those who know & those who don't, Emmy-winning writer, producer Stephen J. Cannell passed away on Friday the 1st. He will be forever know as the man who gave us thousands of hours worth of entertainment for television, a prolific author with several books released, an advocate for dyslexia. He will be truly missed, thanks for all the memories!
The packaging is a oversized plastic clamshell case with a slipcase that holds 28 paper disc envelopes! Now if you planned ahead such as I did, I bought a few multiple disc cases to safely transfer the discs & prevent any damage. Of course, I'm sure if there are persons who are proficient enough to remove & then replace the disc from the envelope without damaging it, I salute you! It has been a thumbrule of mine that envelopes are more trouble than anything else! Mill Creek is at their packaging best once again!
So, we have 28 discs, 152 episodes, an episode on the first disc's label again says ""Hard Contact"" & should read ""Hard Contract""! Mill Creek, please assign new personnel in Quality Control! It appears Mill Creek has a problem with the word ""Contract"". The episode entitled ""The Contract"" is labelled on the disc as ""The Contact"". The episodes appear to run uncut with a few exceptions. Due to music rights, certain songs have been removed or replaced. It also appears that the episode featuring Chaka Khan, has been heavily edited to a running time of under 42 minutes! Usually, a typical episode runs at least 48mins. Once I complete the entire series, I will post all the episodes' individual running times for all. Each season is colourcoded, so there won't be any mixup when viewing the discs.
So what else is there left to say, well I would like to get the three reunion movies & the short-lived revival series & that would make my Hunter collection complete.
This is for fans of the series who watched every week to see L.A.'s finest in action, it is also for those who are new to the series to enjoy! This is a must buy for all collectors. Highly recommended!

 In Season 2, we also had the introduction of Sporty James, who would be making very prominent appearances for the next few seasons. It was the beginning of ""hell"" for Dee Dee McCall with the 2- part episode ""Rape & Revenge"". With end of the first two seasons, Mike Post & the late Pete Carpenter, had a ""re-tooling"" of the opening & closing theme music. These new opening & closing themes would continue for the next two seasons.

Please note that there were several musical performances by both Chaka Khan & Stephanie Kramer that were edited from the episode ""The Cradle Will Rock"". It looked like McCall's ""hell"" would continue in ""Hot Pursuit"" & ""City of Passion"". We finally get a Captain of the Division who stayed on until the very end of the series. The late Charles Hallahan portrayed Captain Charles Devane. Also, Lt. Ambrose Finn who would be ever so prominent in these two seasons, would be written out by the end of the fourth season.
The team of Mike Post & Pete Carpenter would retool the opening & closing themes for the last remaining seasons. The fifth season would be heavy in electric guitar, the sixth heavy in percussion instruments & the final season would sort of laid back western style.

At this point, the end of the sixth year, Stepfanie Kramer had enough & gracefully left the series. The series would never be the same again, with the seventh & final season. Also note, ""Street Wise Pt. 1"" is the only episode that does not have an episodic preview, it just goes straight to the action.

With the absence of Stepfanie Kramer, what could go wrong, did go wrong. Ratings began to slide, two female co-stars were brought in after the first one cited creative differences & would be written out midway through the season. It was never the same ever again & the series was finally cancelled.
Anyway, that's the 152 episodes that are contained in the boxset. Enjoy!
Really, final update!!!
I have not experienced, thankfully, the duplication of discs issue or any of the discs ""freezing"" during playback. I can only say two things about the two aformentioned issues. Firstly, Mill Creek's quality control department could hire some of us to prevent any further disappointments, by also offering quick replacements, & secondly, older dvd players could be experiencing & may need replacing or upgrading where possible. I have been using a Momitsu BDP899 & a Toshiba HD-D3 without any problems.",1285977600,8,8547,4.67342799188641
4171842,4,B003QS0E54,"The good news is you get all seven seasons of a 1980s network TV show for a great price. The bad news is a) there are no extras, including no subtitles, b) the packaging is only just adequate (but space-saving), and c) the disc quality is marginal; the first disc we watched has freezes and drop-outs. Other reviewers have indicated that the episodes vary in length, indicating editting, and some of the music has been replaced presumably for copyright reasons.

So, if you are looking for a collector-grade set, this is not for you. But, if you just want lots of TV at a great price, you should be happy with this set.",1285718400,19,619,4.477876106194691

4171844,5,B003QS0E54,I love the show. And i loved the fact that i received it so fast. Awesome shipping,1284768000,,82,3.8823529411764706
4171845,1,B003QS0E54,I very excited to see the complete series. When I started watching the first season the pilot episode was good but all other episodes on the disc would break up and stop. I tried others and the same issue. I returned for a new shipment. When I received the new shipment it was worse than the first. I returned for a full refund..,1284768000,19,329,4.238095238095238
4171846,3,B003QS0E54,I really like this show. We have the first few seasons published a few years ago. We only like the first six seasons showing the team of Fred and Stephanie so don't want season seven. We also don't want to spend money repurchasing seasons we already own. I hope this set is repackaged so we can just purchase the seasons we don't already have.,1284508800,4,343,4.375
4171847,3,B003QS0E54,"I absolutely love Hunter and it was difficult not giving it five stars but the packaging was crap. Also, I'm watching season 7 right now and the audio is terrible. I would of thought that the quality gets better with the newer seasons but this wasn't the case. Overall I am glad I bought it. I hope they release the movies next.",1284336000,4,328,4.306451612903226
4171848,5,B003QS0E54,I enjoy the show just as much now as I did when it was on tv. I especially loved the early espisodes.  The relationship between Hunter and McCall is great.  They have great chemistry onscreen together.  Hunter is the kind of man you want on your side.,1282867200,,251,4.297872340425532
4171849,4,B003QS0E54,"Finally--the entire Hunter series on DVD!  The show itself will forever get five stars in my opinion.  However, the packaging of this product gets only two: The large molded plastic clamshell case opens to a stack of DVDs, each in a paper sleeve.  Thankfully each season's title appears in a different color, for the disc photo is the same for each. It's a bit of an aggravation to sift through loose disks to find the one you want to watch.",1282608000,3,441,4.4875
4171850,4,B003QS0E54,"Hi folks,

This massive 28 DVD set just arrived...so I have NOT  watched it all yet ...or will I soon...but here's an early review.
first the packaging.... I like  it ,  almost, the overall size is great and each DVD has its own sleeve so I am not worried about handling damage. I do agree that 14 DVDs could have been housed  on one  side and 14  on the other to make things smarter easier and just better.
second...the attention to detail is still off....just looking at the first DVD shows that. They call one episode ""Hard Contact"" its actually ""Hard Contract"" which Anchor Bay correctly titled...
3rd....I quickly went to season seven to see how the end of the series would look etc..the weird thing is that I'm sure that is NOT  Darlane Fluegel pictured on the DVDs with Fred Dryer but some other actress....why? Because they didn't pay much attention to  detail (see first above)... and OH my some of the replacement music is beyond ghastly its horrible and TOO LOUD...ruining scenes that I  watched as  the actual dialog was hard to hear...and the episode times on the first disc of Season seven ran from 42 minutes to  48 minutes plus? NO two episodes had the same time and there were several minutes off so I think  I can safely assume that footage has been lost/cut for whatever reason.

GOOD NEWS?  I picked it  up when Amazon.com knocked the price down to $55 range so I can't really complain about 152 episodes for that price...  I can't give it 5 stars because 5 star items should be the best you can find on this site and its just not in that league...but it may be a 5 star value at the price I got mine  for.

Don't expect perfection and you will enjoy this romp down memory lane...It almost works  for me!

OH..and lest I forget...the original season 1 on Anchor Bay has a bonus DVD with a half hour worth of interviews with Stephen J Cannell and Stepfanie Kramer which is really fun...if you find it used I'd grab it and add it to this collection to make it more complete.",1282521600,7,1992,4.417582417582418
4171851,2,B003QS0E54,I am glad that they released the complete series but the packing stinks. On a scale of 0 to 10 I give the packing a 0! Every time I open the case out come a bunch of black sleeves with dvds in them. If you spend the money for this set and the dvds are worth it spend a little more and buy some slim dvd cases and throw the crappy packaging away. This is a bare bones set just the dvds no extras.,1282262400,7,395,3.7142857142857144
4171852,4,B003QS0E54,I have already purchased S1 and S2 put out by Mill Creek.  S2 has the same bad packaging that the complete 7 season package does.  May I suggest you do what I did and buy a package of DVD cases that hold 2 DVD's per case.  Staples has some very nice slim line cases that hold 2 DVD's.  I scanned the case cover and then made copies of it for each of those cases.  I wrote on each one of the covers what season and disc numbers was in that case.  This way the DVD's are protected from being scratched and you know what season and disc are in each case without going thru all of the paper sleeves looking for the one you may want to watch.  The DVD cases will cost you $20 for the 20 cases in a package but it is better than risking the damage to your DVD's.  If there are 4 disc per season then you would only need 14 DVD cases and 2 cases per season would work out nicely.  That is what I am going to do with the complete Season set.,1282176000,2,933,3.8684210526315788
4171853,3,B003QS0E54,"I was very glad to learn that This series would finally be realeased in full after Anchor Bay started with the first 3 seasons about 5 years ago.  I was disappointed with the packaging of this set however.  It looks like I would imagine the bootleg copies of a show to look.  The outer foil O-sleeve helps to dress it up some but mine was bent and scratched (the studio was nice enough to mail me a new one free of charge), the plastic outer case is thin and just looks cheap, the packaging of the DVDs is the worst, they are simply in a paper slip case with a plastic window which I imagine will easily leave fine scratches from repeatedly removing the DVDs which are all stacked on top of one another and fit poorly in the case.  You have to remove every DVD on top of the one you want to get to a certain disc.  I realize that it was quite hard to make a space utilizing package for 28 discs, but there has to be a better way!  On the good side the video quality seems to be on par with what was previously released by Anchor Bay and the price is right (I got mine for about $72 including Shipping).  I would have been willing to pay even $20-30 more to have a more professional package on par with the big studios but this is what we get I guess.  I really think the most attractive option for the consumer would have been for Mill Creek to release the last 4 Seasons individually, but I suppose this was the most cost effective method for them.  I guess if you are a fan of this show it is better to have it in this format than not at all.  But as an owner of many classic TV DVD sets, I can say this is easily the cheapest looking and most poorly thought out of the bunch!  UPDATE:  I purchased these back in August and never watched them.  Well I saw last night that a lot of people on here were complaining of freeze framing and other problems with playback.  Well I started with Season 4 and the first 3 episodes played fine, the last 3 had so much freeze framing I quit watching.  I was sent a replacement disc from the studio that seems to play correctly as well as a complimentary series called ""Day Break"" which I have never heard of, but it was nice of them.  They also told me that consumer complaints have declined with more recent runs of these discs.  I haven't experienced any problems with Season 4 disc 2 so far and I only have one more episode left.  I'm hoping that I only had the one bad disc.  I also discovered that the 3 defective episodes on Season 4 disc 1 would play correctly through sporadically, however it was never permanent.",1281657600,15,2560,4.166666666666667

8402478,5,B003QS0E54,I bought this box set back in 2012. I've watch all 7 seasons a few times now. All discs play perfectly. Each disc is in a paper sleeve all of which are set in a plastic box with an o-sleeve cover. I've been very happy with this box set. Five years later I'm still watching all the seasons and all discs are still playing perfectly. It's a shame that a lot of the songs had to be changed out which I imagine is for licensing reasons which seems to happen to a lot of these old shows.,1506988800,,482,3.979381443298969
