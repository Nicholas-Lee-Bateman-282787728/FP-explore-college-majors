For example, Jerry Seinfeld showed up in a number of episodes as a courier..... who aspired to be a comedian.  My wife, who had moved here from Germany 30 years ago and had limited English skills, watched this show but did not really ""get"" the humor back then.  Now, she thinks it is a very funny series.

3653034,5,B001JAHPJ4,"In the 1970's Susan Harris broke the mold with ""Soap"" and then ""Benson."" Robert Guillaime's now a trail blazer doing more than Cosby at just a whisper. One must remember this is 37 years old and let the jaw drop at the brilliantly blazed trails.
  Harris went on to do ""The Golden Girls.""
  Season Two of ""Benson"" hit it's stride with minor cast changes that plugged the leaks and clever, hysterical scripts that sound dated now from the middle of the civil rights movement and in the wake of Watergate.
  Benson's the residence manager for the Governor of an unnamed State who appears stupid at first, but is just that honest and kind. His inability to recognize sarcasm is a constant source of humor to Benson's endless (sometimes unnessecary) sarcasm. Harris would later take this trait all the way with Rose Nylund.",1436659200,,819,4.732394366197183

3653046,5,B001JAHPJ4,"""BENSON"" is a great and entertaining sitcom,that is worth the pure viewing pleasure,that it is! a spin-off from ABC's ""SOAP"" TV series,this show,which made its debut in Fall 1979,was an instant hit! Robert Guillaume and Inga Swenson are fine and highly talented people,who are just such great joys to watch! the former ABC series,which ran until 1986,was just an incredible success,and i highly recommend TV fans to buy this DVD,because the episodes are still as funny and entertaining to watch today,and it really doesn't disappoint! from the producers,who later did ""THE GOLDEN GIRLS"",
""BENSON"" is just a serious 80s TV classic,with an outstanding cast,headed by by Caroline McWilliams,Ethan Phillips,Missy Gold,Didi Conn,James Noble,and Rene' Auberjoinois,it is just seriously good TV viewing,that doesn't disappoint! sure hope that Sony and Mill Creek Entertainment will release the other seasons of this show,and soon!",1423958400,,923,5.64748201438849

3653057,3,B001JAHPJ4,"Truly love the series.  These discs, however, are TERRIBLE.  In theory this whole ""burn as ordered"" idea is a good money saver, but in practice it doesn't work at all.  First of all, you are paying as much or often even more than for the true, professional release.  Secondly, the discs and packaging are poor quality.  Lastly, and MOST importantly, the burns are poor at best.  The tint is so far off on my copy that even with correcting the TV settings things look off and then I have to fix the TV afterward or get a headache.  I love this series enough to have been willing to do it just to have the season.  But if a proper release comes out later I will be replacing this set and hoping to sell it to someone who doesn't care much about quality.",1407196800,,751,4.23943661971831

Although it was originally produced a couple of decades ago, it's messages are resoundingly clear and pertinent to what is happening now. Just wish they would release the rest of the seasons. For a great evening of political whimsy without all of the stench of today's political climate, do yourself a favor and order the two seasons of this show.",1400889600,2,456,4.784810126582278

I asked for this as a secret santa gift. I love Benson!!!!!!!!!! They just need to stop dragging there feet and put the rest of the seasons out. I am looking for my favorite espisode( when they go to vegas, and when benson sings with Gladys knight) My other favorite episode I watched this weekend. ( when Benson's mother died).",1388361600,,473,4.266666666666667
3653096,3,B001JAHPJ4,"I have enjoyed Benson for years on my video tapes. I truly enjoy the characters and situations.  It is hard to find stations that show reruns of it these days.  I have waited for a LONG time for DVD's to be released.  As soon as Season was released I purchased it and have no problems with it.  But season 2 is done very cheaply on DVD.  There are no chapter divisions, no listing of episodes on the packaging or the DVD's and worst of all the DVD's stick and skip terribly.  One has to really love the show itself to even consider purchasing DVD's of the remaining seasons.  I will, because it is still a great show after 30 years.",1374451200,,632,4.216666666666667

3653100,3,B001JAHPJ4,"I bought three different titles of these manufactured-on-demand (MOD) products: ""The Gallant Men"", ""Benson"" (season 2) and ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father"" (season 1). All sets have been burned on DVD-R's just as you would burn a CD or DVD on your computer. Who knows what the quality of the DVD R disk is?

What you get are a set of disks that may or may not play on your DVD player. A couple of disks in each set may play on some players, but I struggled to find a complete set that would play on both of my players. I had to return these sets several times to collect disks that would play.

Essentially, the studio is so paranoid about copy protection that they won't let these be played on many players. The interesting thing is that I had no trouble creating back-up copies!! In other words; they have succeeded in frustrating people that want to play what they bought, but can't prevent people from copying! I backed-up all of these sets onto my own DVD's and can now watch them on both of my players.",1362528000,,1009,4.390374331550802
3653101,2,B001JAHPJ4,"The show is good, the product is BAD. DVD-R's that will only play on one player I own (a region free blu-ray player) and that's not located in a place that is handy for me to watch. I prefer to watch DVDs in a small window on my computer screen while doing other computer tasks, and, since these won't play on my computer (NOT a problem I have had with any other commercial products) I cannot watch these in my usual way, in the time I have available. It may take months for me to watch the whole thing.
Also, there is no list of episodes on the case or even printed on the discs, so one actually has to insert them in the drive to search for a particular episode.
This inferior product should be cheaper than a normal product that plays where the buyer chooses to watch it.",1362182400,,774,4.166666666666667

3653104,5,B001JAHPJ4,The whole boxed set was great. I had no problem watching any of the episodes. The only flaw with it was that there was no bonus features. I would have loved to have watched some behind the scenes featurettes but that's a small complaint for a fine set.,1358726400,,252,4.270833333333333
3653116,5,B001JAHPJ4,"This show is really great, funny, and underrated! Possibly my favorite show. I don't think it gets the respect it deserves. Sony who owns the rights just does not care about their customers. Release the rest of the series Sony!! Better yet, release the rights to someone like Shout! Factory who will do it justice and do it right!! As for this 2nd season release, all the full episodes are here, with full intros, plus the first 2 episodes of the 3rd season. The last few episodes from the 2nd season on the 3rd disc are out of order, but that didn't bother me. The really cheap case it came in bothered me though. I ordered 2 copies from amazon themselves and both cases broke easily. I finally took a chance and ordered from importcds and I got a perfect set!! Same amaray case but much sturdier for some reason. Discs were perfect and played with no problem in my LG blu ray dvd player. I got my inexpensive dvd player about a year and a half ago so for the people saying it doesn't play, they must have dvd players that are older than that. I have an older one and it doesn't play in that one. Overall a really good set! Please release the rest of this series!! I like the show Alice but if the 3rd season comes out before this series 3rd season, I'm gonna be pissed!!!

3653118,1,B001JAHPJ4,"I just wanted to let anyone interested in buying this product to not waste their money! It bought this set and not a single disc played on my player. At first I thought it probably go mishandled in shipping and then I thought about the probablity of 3 discs being damaged and the unlikeliness of that. I did some research and found out that many are complaining about the set. The problem is that this is a manufacture on demand dvd set burned on dvd - r which is unheard of for official releases. The type of discs they used is the sole reason that the dvds don't play. I would also like to take a minute to discuss the packaging. The packaging looked like something that you would buy from some bootlegger on the steet because the artwork looks like it was printed on plain printer paper and folded up to look professional. When I recieved this set for Christmas, I immediately asked where did the person buy it from because it looked odd for an official release like the person bought it from someone on one of the many bootleg websites on the internet. They should not charge so much for a set that was not well thought out like this one. Not a very happy customer. I love Amazon and do not fault them for the mistake this DVD company made.

And the guest spots by Ted Danson were a refreshing counterpoint to his babe magnet role as Sam Malone.  And even the spots by Seinfeld were interesting.

3653122,4,B001JAHPJ4,"Since I had really enjoyed Benson when it first ran on TV, I was kinda disappointed with the format of season 2 discs.  While the episodes are first rate, I was disappointed that there was absolutely no episode summaries included - especially at the price paid.  That is what stopped me giving a full 5 star rating.  I would still recommend the product - it is refreshing to see a really funny sitcom that does not depend on sex or foul language.",1347840000,,446,4.414634146341464
3653123,5,B001JAHPJ4,"Benson season 2 brings a change to the cast, in Comes Rene Auberjonois as  Clayton Endicott III the Governors aid and Ethan Phillips as Pete Downey his press secretary, all the cast get their moments in the sun and even after all this time the show is still wildly entertaining.
The episodes are crisp and clear, though i'd take 1 star off for the presentation of the 3 disc set, the First Season had the full color Benson logo from the Disc cover on the DVD's and a nicely done menu on the discs, Season 2 has only the Title on the DVD's and what looks like a made from home DVD makers menu, listing only the Episodes names.
In my opinion the series deserved better from the producers of the 2nd season, and i hope they learn for the 3rd-9th seasons, which i heartily look forward to.

I should not need to point out, but i will, that both Rene and Ethan both went on the great things as Odo in Star Trek DS9 and Nelix in Star Trek Voyager, 2 very fine actors to make those roles their own.

I hope that the following seasons come quickly.

NO TV Series single season should be more than $10 for 20-25 episodes! If this is as bad as everyone says then AMAZON should sell it for ONLY $2 EACH or improve the quality before release and then ONLY $10 EACH.

For those of us who grew up with the show it's a return to true entertainment and for those who may not have seen it get ready to laugh and cry with some of the most memorable characters from the age of the sitcom.,1339372800,,343,3.8450704225352115
3653159,1,B001JAHPJ4,"My daughter and I were ecstatic that we were finally getting to watch Season 2 of our favourite show. Imagine our disappointment that the one of the DVDs was scratched and the other two are unreadable in 3 DVD players. For the price listed, why am I getting a copied disc. I buy from Amazon and not a street vendor because I want a quality product that I can keep. Now what do I do with these useless 3 discs. Two cannot be read and the one disc that can be read is damaged and freezing. I trust that amazon.com will address this issue urgently.",1337040000,4,545,4.2
3653160,5,B001JAHPJ4,"Ok, so there is no episode listing on the DVD packaging, there are no fancy decorations on the discs, and there are no behind-the-scenes footage or bloopers, but you know what? Every uncut Season 2 episode is there, and that's what I care most about. Given that the progression of this show on DVD was on life support a short time ago, I am grateful to Sony for finding a way to keep it moving and get it into the hands of the fans who have been waiting so long. Manufacture on Demand? Go ahead and release the remainder of the seasons the same way if you must, just release them.

I will add that I found it interesting that they threw in the first two episodes of Season 3. I just hope that doesn't mess up the flow of future releases in any way, and I really hope it doesn't mean this is as good as it gets. Also, the episodes were out of order on Disc 3, but I was just glad to see they were all there.

Thanks, Sony, and keep them coming because I personally feel that this great show really starts taking off in Season 3.",1336608000,30,1027,4.104477611940299
3653161,5,B001JAHPJ4,"As a show Benson holds up remarkably well.  Perhaps because it was ahead of its time in content and dialogue, it surpasses shows from the era like Family Ties and Different Strokes.  If you find yourself wondering ""Is Benson as good as I remember?"", have no fear...it is.  There was an early pressing of this DVD that had episodes missing and out of order.  Sony fixed that problem and still includes two great episodes from season 3.  I will update this review if I find any glitches, but after four episodes the playback on my Playstation 3 has been great.",1336608000,2,558,4.54

This is just preliminary review. I will amend with updates.

While I do recognize that this is a DVD-R, one can expect the discs not to have scratches.  Unfortunately this expectation was wrong.  Disc 1 and Disc 2 (out of 3) were scratched. I do not know what the quality of playback is yet, as have just received the package 30 minutes ago.

The DVD case will not stay securely shut due to the bottom tab being snapped off. So far, every expectation has fallen through. The product did not come with ANY inserts or even episode list.  This is a VERY bare bones offering.  Unfortunately, this is the only way to get the second season without resorting to alternative means.  Hopefully playback will be trouble free.

Update to follow...

After having a chance to actually view several episodes, I am somewhat irritated and displeased.  While the episodes are very clear when they play, I have had some glitches and picture freezes on 2 of 3 DVD players.

The first DVD player (Panasonic) would not recognize any of the 3 discs.  I next tried a Sony DVD player which met with better success, but had several freezes.  The third DVD player (a generic cheap POS) played the discs with the same glitches and freezes as mentioned before.

Spending the ~$30 for this quality of product is exceptionally frustrating. I would need to think long and hard before purchasing again. $20 would be more appropriate.",1335916800,22,1429,4.664
