8153958,2,B000K2BAD4,"Buck is my go-to trainer for advice. His method of training is amazing. But when I received this DVD (most expensive DVD I've ever paid for in my life), it looks as if someone burned it onto a disc and printed out the cover photo themselves. Then sold it for a crazy amount of money. Video and sound quality isn't the best either.",1518307200,,330,4.253968253968254

8153961,5,B000K2BAD4,"this is a video that you'll need to watch and try and watch again.......and each time watch more closely for the subtle hints and clues

the only thing is i wish they had a complete session no breaks.....with one critter....and rider....and then again.

as a newbie wrangler and longtime horse owner......i just did a 3 day Wilde to broke client.....and then watch these and buck is a master.....i see the light...the clues....but for a newbie....it is overload......so be patient and keep trying......if not you'll have a best friend......and learned so much.......so don't expect a miracle on your first try....like but says practice practise.....and it will come ....its really about communication both ways and this gentle-ING and not breaking a horse",1410048000,,755,5.283333333333333
