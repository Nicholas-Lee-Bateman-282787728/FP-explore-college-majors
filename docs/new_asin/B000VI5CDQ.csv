Maby and intermediate/beginner.  I do wish the rythms would have been laid out more, maby on screen with the Dums and teks would be a nice visual as you are hearing them. I do like it, may buy it for some ideas in the combo. Oh she did talk about a volume one like this was the volume two, however it was not labled this way.
Please read the rest of the reviews and do not buy this video. It seems the author is not getting royalties and did not intend it to be produced this way. If I am understanding it correctly her 101 shimmies is the very same and we should buy that instead.",1281225600,,745,4.102739726027397
8218814,3,B000VI5CDQ,"lots of clear instruction. it's great that Samra introduces the basic rhythms.  not a workout, but cheap enough to justify purchasing it.  my favorite dancer being Fifi, so my love of juicy egyptian dancers probably taints my opinion of most non-eyptian dancers such as Samra.  Samra's style seems mostly western-influenced, though she has a good grasp of the basic rhythms and is a lovely performer.",1276473600,,400,5.123076923076923
8218815,4,B000VI5CDQ,"I am the author of this DVD and I have the duty to inform you that this is NOT a toning and workout DVD.  I have authored a DVD entitled Shimmyrobics intended as a simple instructional and exercise video with focus on shimmies.  This DVD ""Belly Dance Total Workout for Body Shaping"" is an exact copy of my  101 Shimmies Volume 2.  which  is an instructional DVD introducing dancers to 6 drum rhythms, and it contains 14 combinations and introduction to 8 different shimmy variations. It is intended for a serious beginner or intermediate dancer.

Based on a proposal by Shami Production (the distributor) I submitted raw footage for 3 DVDs, with the stipulation from me that these videos would be edited as a package to create a comprehensive instructional video, that it would not be mixed with  video footage by anyone else, and that the content would remain appropriate for all ages.  I trustingly agreed to the project, expecting the final project to be a family appropriate instructional video in the art of Belly Dance with shimmy as the focus combining segments from the raw footage sent.  Having limited resources and living in very rural area, I trusted an Shami Production to guide me through this complicated process of marketing a video.  I agreed to a project that would honor
my requests. Instead, the resulting DVD was not edited to integrate footage from the other DVDs, but instead it is a replica of 101 Shimmies Volume 2,  with a different person on the cover, some graphics added on, and a misrepresenting title.

So,  if you think that you are purchasing a Toning and Workout DVD, there are many on the market, including my DVD ""ShimmyRobics"".  If you think you are helping a fellow dancer and artist,  be aware that I am not receiving any royalties from this DVD. Shami Production alleges that the DVDs are not selling.  If you want to acquire the original  DVD it is titled ""101 Shimmies Vol 2"" by Samra, and it uses musical rhythms courtesy of Uncle Mafufo plus a short drumming session by Terri Lonergan. The primary focus is on dancing and not on musical instruction.",1252281600,12,2093,4.7217630853994494
8218816,2,B000VI5CDQ,"Beware! The title is misleading. You won't get any workout from this video. Moreover I bought her other videos and found exactly the same content in one of them...This is a ripoff.
Samra mostly explains different rhythms and shows a few combinations for each of them. The combinations are rather simple and she does not seem to be a very dynamic dancer. If you want to get good belly dance instruction, I would recommend Aziza, Jayna or Princess Farhana's videos.
For bellydance workout, better try Neon, Ayshe, Neena and Veena.",1217376000,2,528,4.877777777777778
8218817,3,B000VI5CDQ,"There's something very peculiar here. It's almost as if the printers got the name wrong on the cover. And I'd have really thought so if I hadn't seen the same name inside. Anyone would be forgiven for thinking that the focus of this video is exercise, fitness, sculpting. All dancing will shape and tone something or the other if you do it enough, so it isn't exactly untrue that this video is about body shaping. But the cover is the first and last place you'll hear about it because when you get into it, you'll find it's really about introducing a bunch of common Arabic rhythms (Ayub, Fellahi, Maksoum, Saiidi, Malfuf, Beledi) with combinations. A second chunk of the video instruction is about a bunch of ""regional"" or ""specialty"" shimmies (Tunisian, Algerian, Ghawazee, Brazilian, Roman, Hagala etc). So anyone who buys this expecting a good sweaty abs workout is in for a shock.

Samra, the dancer on this video, seems to have a series called 101 Shimmies and this video seems to have contents that match exactly the description for 101 Shimmies Volume 2. Are there two videos by different names? Are the dancers different? The picture on the cover of this video doesn't look like the dancer inside - and the one inside looks exactly like the one on the cover of 101 Shimmies 1 and 2. Color me confused.

I think the video deserves a point off for being misleading in the description. It deserves another point off for another strange omission. Rhythms are being introduced but there's no drummer demonstrating the sounds. They're described in words - not even in dums and teks in fact. I do think that very odd indeed. If half the video is about rhythms, it needed a drummer or at least sound bytes and breakdowns to explain fully.

But the video gets 3 points for the nice combinations it gives. There are 14 of them and I like them rather a lot. They're explained and broken down somewhat and danced from front and back views and then practiced twice. They're very usable and versatile.

The shimmy section tells you a bit of the background of each of these special shimmies, and you can dance along for a round or two.

Then there's a performance of other stuff at the end.

Overall, the content isn't bad at all. 90 minutes and not expensive. But whether you'd want to buy this or not will depend on your level as a dancer. If you're an absolute beginner, it's best to explore more comprehensive videos first. If you're intermediate, the combinations will add to your repertoire nicely. The shimmies too. If you're advanced, this isn't for you.",1193270400,20,2556,4.656319290465632
