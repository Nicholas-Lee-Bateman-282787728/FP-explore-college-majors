8111929,4,B000EO0Y3U,"This is the only series of DVDs of which I am aware that covers the entire Dayin Wild Goose Qi Gong system. The instruction is lacking somewhat in  detail. The teaching technique is mostly repetitive demonstration from different angles and follow what you see. Fortunately, it is not as complex as taijiquan and if one is observant, they can pick up the nuances, foot work, and other details. I write out my own description of what is being demonstrated - which helps in the learning process.. I have three sets of DVDs on the 1st and 2nd 64 Movements and from an instructional point of view, both are better. Incidentally, there are subtle difference between them but they are substantively the same.",1485388800,2,701,4.745901639344262
