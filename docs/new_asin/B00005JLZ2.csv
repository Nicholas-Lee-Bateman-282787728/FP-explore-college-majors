1469395,5,B00005JLZ2,"In this time of war i love to escape to the movies that are fun to watch.  This is one of those films. Very good acting, a good story, a moral message, no one gets killed, no special effects, no bad language and no bad actors that have to take their clothes off because they can't act.  This is just pure ENTERTAINMENT.  It's a simple story of a country girl with big dreams and without using sex becomes exactly who she wants to be and gets the guy who loves at the end of the film.  You will not be disappointed if your looking for pure fun entertainment.  It also has a surprisingly interesting cast who all make this romantic comedy work.",1048377600,,642,4.229508196721311
1469396,4,B00005JLZ2,"Gwyneth Paltrow seems to have a screen presence that makes one, at least me, want to watch her. ""View from the Top"" is not the funniest movie, but it's definitley better than watching countless bombs dropping on tv. For about one and a half hours, this movie takes the audience to a place, where anything could happen as long as you work hard for it, which probably should resonate in this moment of time. Gwyneth Paltrow was obviously the best part. She was funny and looked quite hot...The best parts of the film were the fight scene, gwyneth paltrow, christina applegate, the music, and the many cameos. The best part of the movie was that it left me with a feeling of being able to accomplish anything (with hard work and determination), which is quite nice, given the dismal surroundings now.",1048377600,,797,4.659574468085107
1469397,5,B00005JLZ2,"I've just seen the fantastic movie ""View From The Top"" at the theatre and I'd like to say I highly recommend that you all see it if you can.
I'm not going to reveal too much about the movie, but wow I was impressed. The commercials for this movie try to market it as a comedy. Well, it has some funny parts, but believe me the movie is alot deeper and interesting than just a simple comic spoof on the airline industry. And it's certainly no spoof.
Rather it captures the life of a flight attendant, the aviation world, and being an up and coming pilot myself (not licensed) I can tell you this movie hits it pretty close to home. It may sound strange to some, but just two minutes into the movie I was already choked up a bit as the camera turned from images of the main characters' childhood, to the sky. It just left me with that feeling I get sometimes when I'm not sure if where I want to go in the future is where I'm really headed...when I think about the pilot I want to be, and wonder if I'll ever make it.
It struck a chord. :)
And it's alot like that throughout the entire movie. From the most humble (and sometimes embarrassing) beginnings to the first big break, to leaving your loved ones behind to chase those dreams....to finally come back home after all that time away...this movie captures the adventures and trials of living a life in aviation...of finding your direction...and adds a bit of humour along the way.
There's a great balance between comedy, drama, and emotion in this movie. Just funny enough to not be cheesy, just serious enough to not be overly dramatic. In short, an excellent show.
I felt that the ending came a little too quickly but I'll let you be the judge of that, and just say that this is a movie that if you haven't see it yet, you need to see it as soon as possible! :)
Of course I'm biased, after all aviation like many other things makes up a big part of my life, but this is the first time in years I've seen an actual, honest, good movie about aviation and the life we in that industry live (or hope to live). With so many movies out there about air disasters that pack on the adrenaline, it's nice to see something that bucks the trend and adds value and meaning to the world of aviation, even if it does mean throwing a few tears and laughs into the mix. This, perhaps, may be one of the best aviation based movies ever created, if only for the fact that it sticks to ideals and doesn't over-do it.
Overall, a well balanced movie that takes you on the sometimes difficult journey of a flight attendant. The trials seen are the same as those in real life face in this industry, nothing feels or seems fake or ""hollywooded-up"" as it were. Coming from an aviation enthusiast, I think that says alot.
Go see it, you won't regret it. :)
P.S. Did I mention that Gwyneth Paltrow's performance was simply outstanding?",1048291200,2,2861,4.329608938547486
1469398,2,B00005JLZ2,"God bless Gwyneth for taking on such a sophomoric comedy. Despite is banalities, she looks like she's having a great time -- or she's really that good an actress.
The Oscar-winner works hard and her charms go a long way in this odd venture from some talented filmmakers.  Shelved since 2001, it is obvious Miramax needed some time to grease up their legendary hype machine. Although, one look at the poster and the shameful marketing is painfully evident.  Airbrushed faces on the bodies of models to represent the cast is a dead giveaway, since that is how the movie plays.
VIEW FROM THE TOP is so featherweight, it practically floats away from your mind the minute it is over.  However, given our current war situation, I have to admit it was a nice piece of brain candy to shut out the CNN barrage.
The film offers a simple moral fable -- stay true to your dreams and heart.  La Paltrow is white trash godddess Donna Jensen, who is determined to get out of the trailer park and fly the friendly skies as an international stew for Royalty Airways.
The plot barely thickens, allowing for some cute cameos (Rob Lowe) and some shtick that goes on too long (Mike Myers, are you listening!?).  The love story with uber-talented, but still slumming Mark Ruffalo is predictable, especially with its awww-fully sappy dialogue, but dammit, I bought it!
Still, it is the girl power represented by such pros as Paltrow, Candice Bergen, Christina Applegate and, especially, Kelly Preston, that proves its best asset, even at its lowest points.  At best, it is a mindless matinee that makes the best of limited pluses.  At its worst, you may feel slightly cheated for spending the money. Still, I found the film a guilty pleasure. From its retrocool look to the chick pop soundtrack, VIEW FROM THE TOP is worthy of viewing, but keep your expectations low.
If watching Gwyneth parade in some outfits that would have even Julia Roberts' jaw-drop in ""Erin Brockovich,"" then this film is for you! If not, I highly recommend you find a copy of the legendary airline tell-all ""Coffee, Tea or Me"" for some real in-flight entertainment!",1048291200,2,2117,4.752043596730245
1469399,3,B00005JLZ2,"This is not a winner, but it was pretty entertaining. Award-winning actress Gwyneth Paltrow does what she can with the sometimes lame script that brought along ""View from the Top."" Its got a great soundtrack and a great cast, which includes Candice Bergen, Christina Applegate, Kelly Preston, Mike Myers, and Rob Lowe. But a movie with some good potential got lost in too many release-date changes and over-the-top, sometimes unfunny humor. Paltrow stars as Donna, a young woman with big dreams. She is on the way to become an international flight attendant, and she's willing to do almost anything to succeed. When her smooth ride turns bumpy, she has to decide whether or not she's ready to leave her dreams behind. There are some hilarious moments involving Mike Myers and a ""cat fight"" between Paltrow and Applegate. Some of the jokes are likeable and funny, while a few just seem over-done or awkward. ""View from the Top,"" though, is funny at times, and Gwyneth Paltrow is charming, along with her co-stars. But the finished project leaves you a little unsatisfied, but hopefully you'll be able to overcome some mild turbulence.",1046822400,21,1133,4.968421052631579

1469490,5,B00005JLZ2,"Very cute and surprisingly accurate movie for the training expected of Airline Employees if you research the same training online.. Just ask your You Tube Stewardess!!
..So, yes, there are the required bikini scenes, but she moves up from the tiny town in the Trailer Park when she was a child in her small town... To discovering who she can be as an adult. Charming and engaging characters!! I watched this together with my Daughters who are possibly interested in become an Airline Attendant. A few well known actors and actresses... Not bad!!

..You don't think about the Stewardess as more than a glorified Waitress, But she is actually responsible for your life in an emergency and must be somewhat athletic, intelligent, and super patient with the passengers.

1469551,5,B00005JLZ2,"At first I was going to pass on this movie but then I looked at the cast: Gwyneth Paltrow, Kelly Preston, Christina Applegate, Candice Bergen, Rob Lowe, Mark Ruffalo, Mike Meyers . . . and I thought that maybe I should give it a try. I was glad I did.

The story is about Donna (Gwyneth Paltrow), a girl with high aspirations but seemingly stuck in a trailer-park existence in a tiny town with no future.  About to resign herself to giving up her dreams, she sees a talk-show interview with a charismatic woman (Candice Bergen) who has written a book about her rise to the top as a flight-attendant and it inspires her to try duplicating the feat.  At first she signs on with a local commuter airline which is barely a step up from her prior life but that is only the first rung of the ladder and things take off from there, albeit with a few bumps along the way and eventually a need to step back and reassess her goals.

The initial scenes with the commuter service provide the best laughs and are, in fact, a bit misleading as they make it seem that it is going to be a broad, screwball comedy but that isn't where the movie goes at all. With the exception of some slightly over-the-top humor from Mike Meyers's cross-eyed flight-attendant instructor (humor which didn't fit in that well with the character of the movie, in my opinion) the movie settled into a fairly routine, but competent, romantic comedy.

Paltrow, Bergen and Ruffalo were all excellent in their roles.  Rob Lowe and Kelly Preston were both underused, in my opinion.  Christina Applegate did a great job as the two-faced friend.  While I wasn't that taken with Mike Meyers's character, he had his moments. Really, the weakest link in the movie was the writing -- the story was interesting enough but just didn't have much depth.

Not an important movie or a great movie, but worth a look.  I struggled with how many stars to give it -- I would give it four-and-a-half if I could but since I can only do either four or five, I decided to go with five because of the great cast.",1473033600,,2049,4.454545454545454

He could've given up his dream for a future with her. However, in a very true to reality situation, she gave up her life for his. Too bad because this movie could've been so much better if he relocated to NYC to be with her or if there was no sexual romance at all but a focus on a woman setting life goals and achieving them. It's too bad too because this movie really could've been better if it had just focused on the main character and her dream. More character development could have taken place as well as adventures throughout the country and internationally. Alas no, more cultural brainwashing re-affirming to audiences that women should and do prize men and love over self, dreams, career, developing into a complete mature person who values their wholeness over accommodating a man who does not consider meeting you halfway in terms of creating a life together, etc.",1452297600,,1049,4.645161290322581

1469829,2,B00005JLZ2,"This film had great potential.  I loved the notion of following one's destiny and dreams.  The film could be a didactic cause toward seeking the better things in life.  The things you were looking for in life could have already been in front of you.  What you were seeking might be in your own house and as is the case in this film it was!  (I won't say as I don't want to be a spoiler.)

The major problem I had with this film is that it was confusing.  It felt like there were elements to the film that did not inter relate well.  For instance, the humorous bits behind Donna Jensen's small town upbringing were unclear.  Normally one could find great humor in instances of her growing up in a small town.  (On the other hand, I didn't even see if Donna's upbringing could have been more serious.  Perhaps she was abused, however, I thought this film was supposed to be a comedy.)  Stylistically, Donna didn't come across as the small girl lacking the sense of style or refinement.  The picture painted by the director at the beginning of the film made it look like a less than dressed Gwyneth Paltrow hanging out with trailer park trash.  I didn't read a young girl with a slighted cultural upbringing.

Secondly, the comic bits fit in awkwardly into the film.  Because the shot frames look more like photographic than comic, the sense of humor was lost.  (For example, the shot of the racing boat on the desert lake looked more like a dramatic artistic shot.)
Mike Myers as John Witney (though portrayed comically on his part) came across as extremely awkward.  The setting of the flight attendant training center looked more like a plain place of airline business, and Myer's humor did not fit in well with the picture.  In fact, Myer's humor was less amusing and more like making fun of people with physical handicaps.

Lastly the sequence of Donna Jensen transitioning into the couture life a of flight attendant was too abrupt.  I could not see the transition of a small town girl growing into the couture lifestyle of Parisian Ateliers.  Paltrow's use of an occasional country bumpkin accent might have been a clear indicator, but her use of it was not consistent with the growth of her character.

Lastly as one who has trained and has graduated as a flight attendant candidate, I found the high lifestyle of the New York based flight attendant hilarious yet disturbing. Potentially, the film was portraying the days of the Pan-Am flight attendant?  For anyone curious, New York based flight attendants end up living in the back alleys of Newark International Airport or the less than desirable parts of Queens (if you are working out of JFK or La Guardia Airport)-sorry for my blunt and rude remarks on the flight attendant's living quarters.  To add insult to injury, you will not be taking a yellow cab to your Upper Westside apartment after working that flight to Lisbon, Portugal.  You will either use public transportation or a shuttle provided to your crash pad where you sleep in a room with 3, maybe up to 16 other people.  This room may also house pilots of the same gender of course!

This film making fun of the economic situation of the flight attendant during the early millennium could have been potentially clever, however, it made the film even more awkward.",1393286400,,3285,4.666086956521739

There are some scenes which aren't clever or funny - like the sleeping pilot ot the grandma who can't hear the heroine confess her love for the man she abandoned for career.

VftT's cinematography makes her absolutely GLOW and I had never found her attractive before seeing her in this due to her repellant personality. This flick reminds me of the Charlie's Angels movies where critics acted like they were crimes against cinema while I considered them, along with the HUGELY underrated Josie and the Pussycats, to be great little comedies. Not the best or most memorable but they do the job if you want something light and sunny.

It kinda reminded me of another airline movie I saw with Jane Wyman in it that I posted a review to, except this one has a modern twist/theme to it of course. And while it was overall  an ok movie the ending seemed very very contrived in a rather strange way. While most of my reviews point out the liberal bias in these movies and tv shows I would have to say this movie kinda forced me to say ""Why did she have to give up her career?"" I mean she was a flight attendant. He was so busy putting himself through law school he didn't see her . . . as he had that second job delivering pizzas. So why did she have to sit there watching tv waiting for him to come home? Why did her decision have to be one of whether she loved him. Maybe it is because she just walked off and didn't try . . . dunno. But I would think that that movie would have ended on a better footing if he finished up school and moved to NY to practice law so she could work. They would even see more of each other.

Yeah, it's basically a ""chick flick"" but the message is all good.  I can watch this film as a double feature with perhaps Sandra Bullock's ""While You Were Sleeping.""

I recommend this film as a great family film because of all it's innocence and charm, but yet, it's not something Walt Disney would likely make for a family audience.

If you like this film, I recommend that you check out, ""While You Were Sleeping"", ""Bride and Prejudice"" (the one withe Aishwarya Rai), and also ""Chasing Papi.""  All good family romance stories that's not entirely meant for only women to watch.  C'mon guys, don't you like to see pretty girls on film?

If you want something a little raunchier with gorgeous girls, check out ""B!tch Slap!"", ""Cloud 9"", ""So Close"", ""D.O.A.: Dead or Alive"",  or this past years ""Sucker Punch.""

Paltrow is far too talented for this, but more importantly, she is far too talented to pull this off.  She is such a miscast as this character; it just doesn't seem legit coming from her.  I wish the film had been as engaging or as funny as the trailer suggested, but it just doesn't come together well enough in the end.  What is even worse than this being bad is that it is ultimately the definition of forgettable.  Watch it and give it a week and you won't remember a thing other than that you didn't care for it.  `View From the Top' is just hollow fluff; a film with no real depth of even worthy plot development.

Applegate, one of the truly greatest sexy/funny ladies in history (OK, name two others...)  Ms. Applegate does not have a massive part of this film, but she does brighten any scene she is in and was never ever more beautiful.

It's a wonderful movie. I use to be a flight attendent, and  could identify with Gwyneth Paltrow's character  wanting to find a new direction in her life. With the exception of the more outrageous comedy moments in the film, I thought it was a pretty close to what flight attendents go through. Of course it not 100% accurate. It's a movie not a documentary. I think the reason this film did not do well at the box office was because it was pushed to look like another Airplane movie or Naked Gun. I watched this movie with a open mind and I thought it was great. The supporting cast was very good. Mike Myers is a hoot!

View From the Top is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.
Gwyneth Paltrow, Mark Ruffalo, Christina Applegate, Candice Bergen, Mike Myers, Rob Lowe, and the rest of this great cast, have outdone themselves with their performances.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention a few tears.  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.

The comedic performance of all cast members and particularly the three primary actresses were outstanding: Gwyneth Paltrow (Donna), Christina Applegate (Christine), Kelly Preston (Sherry), plus comedic performances by Candice Bergen and Mike Myers.  But don't expect too many belly-laughs.  Instead, you'll just be smiling throughout the whole film, especially if you remember any of those `coffee, tea or me'  United, Western, PSA, and American ""Stews"" back during that era.

A whisp, a breeze, a slight disturbance of the atmosphere, then gone. 79 minutes (jeez, double feautures used to have two films longer than that) yet too long at that. A cast of competent actors try to breathe life into this corpse, but cannot do it. The cliches come tumbling out one on top of the other, the surprises are nil, the characters are barely one-dimensional, the few laughs milked long after the teat is dry. Not worth a lengthy review.

1470244,5,B00005JLZ2,"How this movie adds up to more than the sum of its parts is difficult to explain without seeing it, but suspend disbelief (and pocket that cineaste elitism for a mo') and read on ...

First, Gwyneth Paltrow can do white trash girl with a heart of gold really, really well, as she's proven in other films (Duets comes to mind).  She's got a great range.  The woman won an Oscar, remember?  She didn't grab the statue for this movie, but she's got the chops and she runs away with the role of Donna, the trailer park girl from Nevada with big dreams.

Second, Christina Applegate is deliciously duplicitious in the role of her friend and protege, and is proof that trash in Chanel's clothing is still ... well, trash.  Then again, standing next to Gwyneth Paltrow, who isn't going to look somewhat less-than?  (OK, so I'm biased.  This is my disclaimer).

Third, Mike Meyers as flight attendant trainer?  How funny is this?  Do you love Mike Meyers?  Why haven't you seen this movie yet?  Not optional.  A MUST OWN.  He is high-larious, and the bloopers at the end of the movie are worth the price of a rental alone.  (""I am a kitten ... "")

Fourth:  The writing.  No, not the plot, which is predictably formulaic and fairly predictable.  What makes this movie pop like Jiffy is the way these actors take it and make it their own.  What comes through loud and clear is how much fun these folks were having making this film.  It is a romp!  View From The Top could well have been called ""Over The Top"" because in some ways it is.

If the Farrelly Brothers has been Farrelly Sisters and made a kinder, gentler romantic comedy, I think this is precisely the kind of movie they'd have made.

I love it.  So sue me.  It's a riot, and it's heart warming to boot.  More ""love it"" features include ""don't hate me because I'm from the 80's"" musical valentines (Journey's ""Don't Stop Believin'"", Bon Jovi's ""Livin' On A Prayer""), and mouthwatering scenes of Paris (with Gwyneth strolling along the Seine wearing a beret looking oh so soignee).

A guilty, fat-free pleasure -- lather, rinse, repeat!",1142380800,16,2086,4.547169811320755
1470245,5,B00005JLZ2,"This was a cute movie.  I saw it on TV, so I'm sure it was edited, but what I saw was good.  I really had no idea what type of movie it was going to be, but there was nothing else on yesterday afternoon, so I decided to give it a go.  I was pleasantly surprised!

This is a feel-good comedy starring Gwyneth Paltrow, Christina Applegate, and Mike Myers.  You could wonder how a movie about flight attendants could be good, but this one pulled it off.  If you go into it expecting nothing, as I did, you should have no problem coming away from watching it feeling like you haven't wasted 2 hours of your life.  I thought it was refreshing and I recommend it to anyone who loves movies that mean nothing and have happy endings!

1470246,5,B00005JLZ2,"View From the Top is not as bad a many people would have you believe.  In fact, it's quite entertaining.  First of all, don't take it seriously, because it's just a fluff romantic comedy.  If you keep that in perspective, you'll really enjoy this film.

The story is centered around Donna, a woman from the trailer parks of Nevada who hopes to escape from the type of life her mother leads.  She thinks she has found the ticket in the high school quarterback who promises to take her places, but in the end, he dumps her.  In a fit of depression, she ends up watching daytime TV in a bar, and she sees the interview of a famous flight attendant.  Her dreams take off from there as she struggles to make her dreams come true.

The only weak point in this film is Mike Meyers who places the flight attendant trainer.  Some of his jokes fall flat and at times it seems he is recycling some of his Dr. Evil character.  Other than that, I think you'll enjoy this.  Perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon.",1131840000,19,996,4.3297297297297295
1470247,4,B00005JLZ2,"I found this movie to be more serious rather than funny. Maybe I couldn't see it from a humorous angle. But the movie was an overall good movie.

Donna Jenson, played by Gwenyth Paltrow, has dreamed of a better life for herself. She thought she was going to get the chance to leave her hometown with her first boyfriend, but he had no intention of taking her with him. He was involved with another co-worker and took her instead. With a stroke of luck, she and her two friends friends Christine Montgomery and Sherry (a short role for Kelly Preston)decide to get an education in the friendly skies.

Meeting Sally Weston brings sheer stroke of hope for Donna who looks up to her but she is thwarted again and working for a lesser airline. But on the flipside, she does find love with Ted Stewart, a law student who is family-oriented. The two fall in love. When her friend Christine arrives on their doorstep, she then questions how she got her job at Sally Weston's airline.

A chance again comes for Donna but it also means having to give up the man she loves. She doesn't want to get hurt again. But flying the friendly skies can be lonely for an airline stewardess and she soon wonders if she has made the right decision.

This movie is good on themes but the humor just isn't there. Candace Bergen looks very good for her age. She proves that you don't have to be relegated to playing roles that identify ""old age"". She stood out in that airline uniform. And Christina Applegate, who played the dumb blonde on ""Married With Children"" has come a long way. Despite the devious character she plays, she handles it very well.

Personally I felt that she should have pursued her dream of being a Weston stewardess but she could've maintained her romance with the aspiring lawyer. He's not so bad looking once you see him from an angle!",1120694400,2,1835,4.515060240963855

Yet, after watching just a few minutes, the film reminded me of when I wanted to be an airline stewardess more than anything else in life, back in the 50s.  So, I savored many parts of the movie due to a major case  of nostalgia.

This film, believe it or not, does not make one feel stupid for watching.  You just need a sense of fun.  Candice Bergen is great as Donna's mentor.  And, seeing the ""bad girl"" get a dose of her own medicine makes one smile.

1470333,3,B00005JLZ2,"View From The Top surprised me- it really wasn't that bad despite the fact it bombed in movie theaters. This is the kind of a warm-light hearted comedy that is not over the top but, done tastefully well. And to be honest I actually like this movie mind you it won't be the best movie you'll see in your life but, it certainly will not be the worst.

Paltrow in this flick has one wish and one wish only to leave her small hometown. When a mysterious turn of events occurs, she breaks up with her boyfriend who was going to help get her out and see Candice Bergen on T.V. who just happens to be one of the most famous flight attendants of her time and has just written the bestseller ""My Life In The Sky."" Paltrow quickly buys the book and decides she wants to be a famous international flight attendant taking a job at Sierra airlines which is one of the smallest and worst airlines to work for. She and her gal pals decide to go to a Royalty airline job fair where two of them pick up jobs. Paltrow says goodbye to her small town and her new love interest to enroll at the pretigious Rolayty flight attendant academy where she encounters a thief, a cross eyed instructor,a cheat, and joins the ranks as top of her class. When graduation day comes Paltow was almost certain she'll end up flying on the New York flight. But with a mysterious turn of events she is working in Ohio- where she runs into an old flame that quickly rekindles. But, Gwen despite her new found happiness in her live-in law student boyfriend decides she needs to see more and find out what really happened on her test. She re-takes the test and manages to get a perfect score and ends up working the Paris flight. Only problem the boyfriend she left behind. Is the view from the top really what they make it out to be?

This movie really was a sweet romance and Gwenyth Paltrow does a wonderful job as the heroin of this movie. I especially liked the cat-fight scene between her and buddy Christina Applegate. Once again Candice Bergmen is wonderful.

All in all trust me the view from the top really isn't that bad! Rent this one and be pleasantly surprised!",1111708800,,2133,4.367758186397985
1470334,3,B00005JLZ2,"Gwyneth Paltrow plays Donna, who was born in a very very small town, who like many others born in a small town, just wants out. She doesn't want to end up like her mom, who has married four times, and all of them seem to be alcoholics. After her high school boyfriend dumps her on a birthday card, she decides that she needs to make some changes. She goes to work for a small airline as a flight attendant, where they believe in ""big hair and short skirts.""

She fits right in, and meets Christine (Christina Applegate) and Sherry (Kelly Preston). They spend their time in Lake Havasu tanning on Sherry's roof.(not much else to do) When Donna meets Ted, (Mark Ruffalo) they instantly have an attraction. But, since she is moving to Cleveland to bigger and better airlines to be a trainee, they don't take their relationship much further than a first date.

Once there, Donna is at the top of her class, and taking all of the rules and procedures seriously---her classmate Christine, not so much. But, somehow, Christine manages to do better than Donna on the test, so she is the one that gets to work out of New York International, while Donna is stuck in Cleveland. Something doesn't seem right, but it doesn't matter so much when she meets up with Ted again who is going to law school in Cleveland, where his family lives.

Will she make it to New York International? If she does, will she still want what she has wanted all of this time, or is what she wanted right in front of her face?

It was cute, as I stated above. I liked the romance aspect and the ""live for your dreams"" message, but there was something wrong with it. I know that you can change, but the whole big hair working at Big Lots with her cheesy boyfriend becomes this classy woman who is all of a sudden, very intelligent...I just didn't buy it. I don't like when characters change right in the middle of the movie. It wasn't coherant with the rest of the story. Also, the movie changed as well. It started out to be ""woman will go to all lengths to live her dreams"" but then it had ""spoof"" like parts in it, like Mike Myers and his lazy eye. I'm all for comedy, but when you take it to that level, it becomes an entirely different movie. It was nice to see well-known and and likeable actors as the main characters and the concept was original.

Gwyneth Paltrow is one of the best and most beautiful actresses of our time.  Yet if you check her filmography her early career contains no movies which uhhhmmm ahhhh emphasize Ms. Paltrow's feminity, -- in a modern sense.  WELL HERE IT IS, a very guilty plesure, but lots and lots of fun and romantic with a little r too.  Ms. Platrow is not only cute, adorable, and hugely talented, but yup she looks GRRREEAT in a short skirt, bikini, or slinky pants.  Guilty guilty pleasure.

1470336,5,B00005JLZ2,"...although Gwyneth Paltrow's apartment in the upper eighties on Fifth avenue is hard to credit, unless the fictional airline bought a block of flats some time ago for senior employees, and funds the block as an investment.

As a business decision, unless the airline is doing very well on the equity, this doesn't make sense since Newark and JFK are rather hard to get to from Manhattan. But let us assume that Royalty needs the flexibility of calling its best flight attendants to fly domestic out of Newark or international out of JFK at will. Manhattan is midway.

But, the reality is La Hacienda near LAX, the official hotel of Spirit Airlines, a fun budget carrier, staffed by fun people, who only on occasion calls the LAPD to deal with its passengers when its one and only plane at LAX has a busted tire or something, and the passengers, delayed 12 hours, storm the counter. The passengers are also a fun lot, mostly gang bangers and working people who would otherwise take the bus. In general, a good time is had by all...but it is certainly nothing like ladies in hats deplaning in Paris.

[A fun way to go to Paris from the Far East: Emirates. My flight last year was also taken by an Osama clone who prayed overlong in the departure lounge and was greeted by muscular followers who played video games enroute. I sat next to an Austrian army type who was probably keeping an eye on the homes and nothing happened, probably because the Osama clone was just another schmoe cleric. Once you get over raw terror, flying is a gas, and, because of the raw terror, cheap psychiatry.]

But, movies about commercial aviation manage to show real working people who actually dream dreams limited ab initio by material circumstances.

This movie includes some nice eye candy including some real basic stuff...Stews in Bikinis at Lake Havasu. And throughout, Gwyneth Paltrow retains that dignity which does credit both to her own profession and those of people who keep planes up with the sharp end pointed the right way and watch over us passengers.

Rob Lowe as CoPilot Steve gets another one of those strange little cameos he gets from time to time, where his dangerous, almost saccharin, sexuality is allowed to ooze out a bit and then put back in the can. He goes nowhere, unfortunately, and his career (starting as it did with a serious version of David Mamet's stage play Sexual Perversity in Chicago) is also going nowhere...perhaps because About Last Night managed to preserve a modicum of moral seriousness and this upset the morally unserious  who can't deal with terminal pain as a necessary part of sexuality.

Mike Moore is allowed instead to romp over most of the latter part of the film in a fun way and as your basic airhead stuff, this film is five stars.",1105228800,,2771,4.698969072164949

I'm all about silly/stupid movies but this movie isn't remotely funny.  Mike Meyers gave me about two chuckles with the lazy eye gag.. which was repeated waaaay too many times.

Ladies, if you're looking for a good comedy to watch with your boyfriend, please try ""High Fidelity"" and ""About a Boy"".  Those are both suprisingly witty and funny and actually have something to say with some interesting characters.  I assure you, you will both like those.

Or a romantic comedy that pits a woman's career and life ambitions against her heart? It tried to be both. Mike Myers' character, to me, brought the film down to spoof level. While Candice Bergen's character added heart and hope and a little bit of quirkiness. They really should've made up their minds before setting out to film this one. Despite some ridiculous events (like Christina Applegate's character fighting with Gwyneth Paltrow's character, right there in the first class cabin, when she had no business being there and especially these days, she couldn't have made back there considering the circumstances....totally ridiculous) there were some good aspects to this movie. The cameos for instance. Rob Lowe, Kelly Preston, short but notable. The romantic part of the story was sweet. And there's a nice little twist at the end. Not a believable one mind you, but still, it made for a good ending. And I like happy endings. So all in all, this was pretty good (decent story, amusing events, nice ending).

The movie is upbeat, has its obligatory conflicts and struggles, and throws in the obligatory romance.
Another perk to this fun, mediocre film is the presence of Candice Bergen, who exudes worldly charm and steals every scene she's in.  And there's also Mike Myers as an instructor in flight attendant school; he has a peculiar problem with his eyes and manages to make it both a source of humor and poignancy.
So if you want a fluffy, inspirational film that won't make you think too much and that has it's memorable moments, View From the Top could be a decent movie for you.",1090022400,,788,4.465277777777778
1470341,3,B00005JLZ2,"Bruno Barreto's ""View From the Top"" boasts a cute premise that doesn't quite live up to its potential.  The film starts out in a satirical vein, promising to deliver a nifty spoof of life in the friendly skies.  Instead, it settles into a typical romantic comedy formula, not bad as these things go, but nothing to write home about either.  So while ""View from the Top"" never soars very high, neither does it end up crashing and burning.  In this day and age, one must be grateful for a safe landing, even if the ride is a bumpy one.
Gwyneth Paltrow delivers a winning performance as Donna, a small town girl who becomes a stewardess as a way of escaping her dysfunctional family and white trash upbringing.  The first part of the film is fun, as Donna earns her wings flying for a cut-rate airline whose attendants dress and act more like prostitutes than stewardesses.  With their form-fitting, cleavage-exposing blouses, purple hot pants and big hair, these pleasantly perky hostesses look like they're ready to serve their passengers more than just the customary coffee, tea or milk.  So far, so good - but once the girls move onto a more ""legitimate"" airline, much of the satiric bite drains out of the film and we move onto the more familiar terrain of catty rivalries, long distance romance, and unrequited love.
In addition to Paltrow, the movie features Christina Applegate, Rob Lowe, Candice Bergen and Mark Ruffalo in various roles.  Mike Myers is surprisingly annoying in the part of a cross-eyed stewardess trainer. The screenplay by Eric Wald has a maddening tendency to drop characters along the way, giving the film a slapdash, unformed and oddly amateurish quality.  As partial compensation, the film boasts superb production and costume design and a generally ebullient spirit.
""View From the Top"" doesn't end up flying us anywhere special and it's definitely coach all the way, but it does serve up a few laughs in mid flight.",1088208000,,1945,4.851963746223565
1470342,2,B00005JLZ2,"So, what does she wants to do, after all?  I mean, Gwyneth Paltrow, who was going to be a great thing, that's how I thought when she was in ""Shakespeare in Love or ""Sliding Door.""  Then, ""Shallow Hal"" came.  And then, this one, complete mess.
Ms. Paltrow is utterly miscast as Donna living in a small town in Nevada.  She wanted to leave the place anyway, and see the world, and to do so she becomes a flight attentant.  So far, you see so lots of cliche -- a girl living in trailer, a mom who had married four times, and her drunk husband.  Is this supposed to be a satire?  Or just insensible, prejudjuced ideas of someone behind the movie?
And Donna becomes a flight attendant, and be a friend with Christina Applegate and Kelly Preston as co-workers... quite a bad sign, isn't it?  For these ladies, talented as they are (especially the latter), tend to be typecast.  And again they are.  To make matters worse, Kelly Preston soon disappears (whom I miss) while Candice Bergen shows up (who exactly looks unchanged from her role in ""Miss Congeniality""), and Paltrow & Applegate go on to audition for the first-class airline, where the best trainer is over-the-top Mike Myers, whose awfully misguided acting demolishes every little thing in the film.
What does this film want to do?  It sometimes suggests our prejudiced ideas about flight attendants, trying to be a satire.  But the satire is weak, when you see Applegate and Paltrow engaged in a fierce cat flght (really), the former banging the head of the latter into bread.  Comedy?  But the gags are weak too when Myers' performance is just irritating and unfunny, the same kind of gags you see in, say,  ""Little Nicky.""  And there is a romance, which is too weak to remember (love interest, Mark Raffalo).
""View From the Top"" gives us lots of fluff, that's the only thing you can get.  And as that, the film is not bad, a real eye-candy.  You will see Paltrow in bikini, and the costumes she wears are very fashionable.  And that's all that I can recommend.",1086048000,2,2017,4.583798882681564

Thus, I avoided seeing it for all of the right reasons. However, the genre of film is one of my boyfriend's favorites, and as a favor to him, rented this little movie for a quick Saturday afternoon's entertainment. What I found was a quirky, fun, funny movie that, if you don't take it all too seriously, you can seriously warm to.
Gwyneth Paltrow plays Donna, a girl with stars and the skies in her eyes. Donna longs for a better life than her small town girlhood in Silver Springs. Hooking up with a small commuter airline, Donna starts her career in the air. In one short but pivotal scene, she is dissed by a trio of snooty flight atttendants, which fires her upward. Soon, she moves up to a major airlines, but first, has to endure the training process, run by the ever funny Mike Meyers.
Complication besets complication, but no worries, this is a film whose plot is secondary to the likabillity of its characters. You know about the ending, but the time spent with these people is entertaining. Turning in great performances is the hugely underused Kelly Preston, Christina Applegate as a ditsy coworker, wonderful Candice Bergan as a flight attendant extraordinaire, and the lovable Mark Ruffalo, playing a has-it-together guy, finally.
Much disdain has been heaped on this movie, perhaps by people intending to take it much more seriously than was its intention. Citizen Kane its not, but a lighthearted time spent in the skies. As we follow Donna on her journey of self-revelation, we root for her and all of her friends as well.

I think Kate Hudson or Cameron Diaz would have been much better, however, I don't think even they could have saved this bad film.  At times I wasn't sure if this was supposed to even be a comedy.  In the beginning, it seemed like it was supposed to be funny that Paltrow's character wanted to be a stuartess, but then it's supposed to be serious.  Although this movie was very bad, every scene with Mike Meyers was very funny.  His character had a lazy eye and he had an erratic temper that often caused hilarious scenarios.

I was unable to work out whether the film was actually taking itself seriously, or whether it was a gigantic satire on the whole follow-your-dream/romantic comedy genre.  At times it was really funny or enjoyably wacky - for instance, quite a few parts of the flight attendant training; Mike Myers's character, in general; the fight scene between Donna and Christina; but at other times it was sickly-sweet (nearly everything about following your dreams) or very, very sincere (Donna's relationship with Ted).  So it was really hard to understand how you were meant to react.
Personally, I found the morals of the story cliched and irritating, and the Sally Weston character just another strong-mentor-person-thing; and Donna did come across as just a bit too smug/perfect at times.  Also the plot was quite annoying, with characters fading out leaving you wondering what the point was of putting them in in the first place.  I would have liked the movie better if it had been more focused on Donna's career and less on her romance, which was extremely predictable.

So there is a comic side and a serious side to this movie, just like there is the career plot line and the romance plot line between Donna and Ted (Mark Ruffalo), and just like Donna has her good friend Sherry (Kelly Preston) and her not so good friend Christine (Christina Applegate).
But the person who ends up being the lynch pin of this film is Donna's mentor and flight attendant godmother, Sally Weston, played by Candice Bergen.  You keeping thinking Murphy Brown is going to make an appearance at any moment, but Sally Weston is exactly who she seems to be and as good as gold.  She might be perky and the queen of stewardesses, but the lady is not stupid.  You keep thinking this movie is going to turn into some sort of mindless romp about flight attendants, but it never sinks to that level.
Be sure not to bail out before the credits, because in addition to the traditional outtakes there is a production number by the flight attendants of Royalty Airlines.  The DVD has has a trio of short featurettes, the best of which is a short history of Flight Attendants, including the famous paper dresses.",1069459200,11,2018,4.479564032697548
1470501,3,B00005JLZ2,"Gwyneth Paltrow plays Donna, a poor girl from the boonies who longs for escape and adventure in ""View From Above."" She aspires to follow in the footsteps of her role model, and eventual mentor, (Candice Bergen), as an international flight attendant. With dreams of Paris and New York City dancing in her head, she enters Royalty Airlines' training school, run by a very funny Mike Myers. She proves to be a stellar student but runs into trouble with her double-dealing, kleptomaniac best friend.(Christina Applegate). Instead of Paris, Donna pulls Cleveland as a billet, and is saved from total despair by love interest, Mark Ruffalo.

This film is a harmless bit of fluff that is, at times, just zany enough to be fun. The story plays out like a camp fairy tale, happy ending and all. One of the best spots is the run of credits at the movie's end, juxtaposed over hilarious film clips that were cut from the unfinished product. I got pulled into watching this with my daughter, and it really wasn't bad. Cost of a DVD rental, $4.00. Cost of time spent snuggling with daughter - Priceless!

1470502,2,B00005JLZ2,"Possibly valuable for teen girls, but a turkey for anybody else, ""A View From the Top"" is a harmless career movie that occasionally dabbles in romance and comedy. A good advertisement for the flight attendant field, it's a rotten ad for the film business. How Gwyneth Paltrow, a good actor, happened upon this goofy script is one of those mysteries better left unsolved.
Paltrow is Donna, a small-town Nevada girl doing time at the Big Lots superstore. She sees a TV show featuring a famous flight attendant (Candice Bergen), decides upon a job in the skies, and works first for a low-class puddle jumper with two big-haired broads (Kelly Preston and Christina Applegate). She also meets Ted (Mark Ruffalo), a law student on some kind of hiatus. Scooting right along, Donna and her buddies try out for a reputable airline, the ultimate goal being the coveted New York-Paris international route, although I'd prefer Madrid. Or maybe Istanbul.
Donna is an ace student, somewhat to chagrin of Applegate's character, who plays a nasty trick, and Donna's cross-eyed flight instructor, played by Mike Myers like he had some time to kill. There is a Choice, between love and the international route, and a Moral To It All, with a few decent, obligatory shots of Paris at Christmas.
""A View From The Top"" seems to know a little about flight attendants, but not too much. It certainly flip-flops on how they should look these days - top hats and one-piece zipper suits haven't been around for years. The entire cast is forgettable, and though Paltrow has the talent to play below her intelligence level - check out her clever cameo in ""Duets"" - her heart is not in it here. Ruffalo is bizarrely jocular. Applegate is swiftly becoming an annoying third wheel.
Though it isn't vulgar, or very long - both good marks in my book - ""A View From The Top"" is never consistently funny, or dramatic, or touching, or even interesting to watch. It's the equivalent to that single Coke and bag of peanuts you get on the Denver-Kansas City flight.",1067990400,2,2025,4.788571428571428

1470506,5,B00005JLZ2,"This was really promoted incorrectly.  It is not a laugh your ass off comedy.  It is a sweet and funny love story.  That is pretty much it.  There are some great comedic moments and there are some very touching moments.  For the most part, the movie is like eating whipped cream.  Not much to it, but you love it anyway.
It starts off with Gwyneth living in trailer hell and tells of how and why she got away from it.  Along her way she meets a few people who either help her or stab her in the back.
In her quest to be the best in the industry (airline attendant) she finds that this may not be all that she is looking for.  But, has she already seen what she is looking for or is it still out ther for her to find.  That is pretty much the plot and story.  Will she or won't she find love and if she does will she keep it or throw it away?????
I think it is the light tone of the movie that really helped it.  It never takes itself too seriously, yet it does not just discard itself either.
Every shot is wonderful.  It is almost like a painting full of color and texture.  It reminds me of why we go to see movies anyway..  As an escape.  To get away from the mundane everyday boredom that may exist in our own lives.
It is fantasy.  It is there to help us dream and explore other feelings that we may never have the chance to feel.
Just take it for what it is worth.... nothing more, nothing less.
Don't expect over the top action or anything like that.
It is a character driven movie.  You are not left at the end wondering why or how did that happen.  You are just left with a warm fuzzy feeling inside.
I cannot express enough how much I love this movie.

That is why so many people pan it as they want it to meet an expectation from the advertising. It was advertised wrong as a pure comedy. It of course is not. Some might say it has too many angles. That is what makes it more like real life than many movies. It is a ""growing up"" movie. It is a comedy. It is a drama at times. Just like life! So often studios advertise movies as fitting a certain category to try and draw a set audience. That can be a movie killer though. Gwenith Paltrow did a fantastic job as the star. It was amazing to see that someone could get Mike Myers to tone it down just enough that his character was almost believable.

Sometimes in funny comedy movies there doesn't have to be a deep, well-plotted love story.  In fact, sometimes that interfers with the comedy.

They could have explored love further.  Gwyneth Paltrow is a terrific actress, but the lacking of demand doesn't match her.  Her acting is the best movie feature.  Everyone else was either underreacted (Mark Ruffalo) or overreacted (Mike Myers).
Despite the downfall, ""View From the Top"" has a lot of funny scenes, which make up for the defects.  The flight attendant outfits are creative and match the movie's theme well.  It teaches the audience many valuable life lessons, those that one would least expect.

1470571,3,B00005JLZ2,"Being a movie buff and still in high school means that on most occasions I watch movies with both parents. And since my mom simply loves romantic comedies (think Meg Ryan, 'The Queen of Romantic Comedies'), I decided to give ""View from the Top"" a try.
Gwyneth Paltrow plays Donna Jensen, a small time girl who desperately wants to see the world and leave her home town behind. By chance she sees the famous stewardess/recent authoress Sally Weston (Candice Bergen). Inspired by Sally Weston, Donna lands a job as a stewardess on one of the lower class airlines. But soon, her dreams start becoming a reality when she gets accepted to the Royal Airlines school to be trained as a waitress. But through many hardships, trials, and a love interest in the form of Ted Stewart (Mark Ruffalo), Donna learns what it really means to find happiness and fulfill your true dreams. Also stars the famous Mike Myers as a teacher at the Royal Airlines School with a slight 'eye' problem, Christine Applegate as Christine the fellow stewardess who is not all that she seems, and a small part by Kelly Preston as another aspiring stewardess. Short cameo also of Rob Lowe as a co-pilot.
Just as the title for my review states, I found ""View from the Top"" in my list of 'extremely mediocre'. Wasn't too bad, just nothing special either. The thing with this movie is that it actually DOES have potential. So here's a list of the good points:
1) Gwyneth Paltrow's character is actually likable though a bit naive. Recent romantic/comedy stars are at times just unlikable, making the whole movie unlikable. How can you like a movie with terrible characters.
2) Mike Myers is simply HILARIOUS! His whole 'eye' thing is sooo funny! But amazingly enough, he has character isn't too one-dimensional, giving occasion for you to feel for him and like him not just as a comic relief.
3) The story is in a way quiet enjoyable, an easy to follow storyline.
4) Some great one-liners and jokes! I especially loved it when Sally Weston says something about 'smiling even after you're out of Bloody Mary mix'.
Ok, on with the numerous 'on the bad side' points:
1) All right, even for people who LOVED this movie have to admit that the love plot was just a 'mite' too boring. There seemed to be no real chemistry between the two Paltrow and Ruffalo that it was bit hard to believe they end up with each other at the end.
2) Predictability seems to be a major *must* in all romantic/comedies. Unfortunately, ""View from the Top"" seems to have taken the cake for being too predictable. There was some effort to include a small twist in the plot, but viewers could predict that at least 30 minutes before it actually happens.
3) Half of the jokes are sexually implied ones, which for me totally ruins all great movies of this genre. And as many movies are now inclined to have to include gay jokes or at least have one gay person in the movie, it proves to make me especially uncomfortable. I'm sure at least a few people agree with me on that area, gay jokes can be in my opinion TOTALLY taken out of any film.
To sum it up, ""View from the Top"" is nothing special. And sadly because it seemed to be MADE to be 'just another chick flick', it's a movie which can be easily passed over. If you're looking for GREAT romantic/comedies (aka chick flicks), watch these good, fairly clean, and FUN movies:
""You've Got Mail"" (Meg Ryan & Tom Hanks)
""Sleepless in Seattle"" (another Meg Ryan & Tom Hanks movie)
""Kate and Leopold"" (Meg Ryan & Hugh Jackman)

1470572,4,B00005JLZ2,"Donna (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a small town girl who has dreamed all her life of escaping Silver Springs, Nevada to someplace more exciting and less hopeless. When she is almost convinced that she will be stuck in her little town forever, Donna sees Sally Weston (Candice Bergen), the royalty of flight attendants, on a television talk show. Inspired to fly her way into a new life -even though she has never been on an airplane- Donna applies immediately for a flight attendant's position with a local commuter airline. Eventually aspiring to greater opportunities, she and two fellow stewardesses (Christina Applegate & Kelley Preston) pursue jobs with the more prestigious and widely traveled Royalty Airlines, the airline of Sally Weston, herself. Donna enjoys the aid and encouragement of many of the folks at Royalty Airlines, feels the betrayal of others, and must balance her personal and professional lives while she pursues her dream of working ""Paris First Class International"" and beyond.

""View from the Top"" is a light-hearted comedy about a nice all-American young woman trying to make a satisfying life for herself. Donna isn't particularly smart or dumb. She's ambitious, but hard-working and scrupulously honest. She's pretty. She's friendly. When I think about it, she's so full of sugar and spice and everything nice that she sounds nauseating. If Gwyneth Paltrow's charisma was ever in doubt, it is no longer. Paltrow imbues Donna with such sincerity and spirit that she is magnetic and sympathetic where the character could easily have been saccharine in the hands of a less appealing actress. Mike Myers also gives a nice comic performance as John, the visually impaired instructor at Royalty Airlines flight attendant school. ""View from the Top"" is a fun fluffy comedy that features some nice, silly comic performances and amusing eye-catching costume design. If you are looking for light but well-conceived entertainment, you need look no further. And  Gwyneth Paltrow's performance truly lights up the screen. Julia Roberts has nothing on Donna's winning smile.",1063670400,2,2083,5.271084337349397
1470573,4,B00005JLZ2,"VIEW FROM THE TOP, the story of a flight attendant wannabe (Gwyneth Paltrow) has such a '60s' feel that I thought I was watching a period piece...until I saw Paltrow and Christina Applegate in VERY skimpy bikinis, and knew the 60's were never THAT daring!
Cheerfully lightweight and upbeat, VIEW could have been written for Reese Witherspoon, Hollywood's resident 'small-town girl makes good' actress. Paltrow, an actress of far greater range, seems overqualified for the role of a Silver Springs, Nevada girl, who, after her high school sweetheart dumps her, is inspired by a TV commercial to escape by becoming a stewardess (oops, I mean Flight Attendant...it's that 60's thing, again!) Winding up with a bush water airline flying drunks back and forth to Las Vegas, she bonds with ex-Hooters 'vet', Kelly Preston (agelessly beautiful, and as voluptuous as ever), and Applegate, a cute kleptomaniac. Despite meeting a law student on sabbatical (Mark Ruffalo) that she's attracted to, Paltrow convinces her friends to join her in interviewing for flight attendant jobs with the international airline her role model (Candice Bergen, playing a sympathetic character, for a change) flew for. The interviews are run by a cross-eyed and hilarious Mike Myers, who steals the film, every time he appears! Preston fails, but Paltrow and Applegate are accepted, and training begins...but when the final exam is given, despite Paltrow's intense studying, Applegate gets the choice assignment, and she ends up in Cleveland...where she again meets Ruffalo, who's decided to return to Law School...
Will Gwyneth allow herself to fall for the hunky Ruffalo? Will she, as Myers commands, wait a year and retest, again? Will she ever see Paris, her Flight Attendant dream destination? And just how did educationally-challenged Christina out-test her? All these questions WILL be answered when you buy this breezy but likable comedy, featuring cameos by Chad Everett, Stacey Dash, Jessica Capshaw, and Rob Lowe.

This was not only a hillarious movie but it's one of the few movies now-a-days that has brought some of the 80's back into our theatres. Sure you won't learn any provound life lessons, or you won't be moved to sobbing tears, you'll simply have a good time with the girls while watching some great actors and actresses have fun with a cheesy movie. With Cyndi Lauper's ""Time After Time"" playing in the background, how can you not laugh and smile as you watch this feel good comedy.

It's a typical story about rag to riches, about determination to succeed, about cat-fight when a girl backstabs another girl, about a girl falling in love with a guy and in the end, she would forsake even her career just to be with him, even if that means she needs to stay in Cleveland, Ohio!  Actually, the best bits & the gags have already been shown in the preview & the fill-in bits in the movie is really a rather waste of time.  The chemistry between Gywneth's character & the leading man is not there, & the crossed eyed Mike Myer's jokes runs thin after a while, & in the end, I can't help but wondering what genre this movie is supposed to be.  Is it actually a comedy, a love story, or what?  In the end, it's neither.  I would rather watch the out-take in the end, where there is a musical about ""We Are Family"", and enjoying the actors & actresses having fun in between shooting.

1470577,4,B00005JLZ2,"This is a movie with numerous surprises, most of them pleasant ones. One could watch many a scene and think the movie had, ""lightweight"" written all over it. The plot is not exactly intense, but on its own level it has enough surprise twists and avoidance of cliches to give the movie, in a subtle way, more substance than one might expect early on. Much of the way through I found myself rather surprised that they would cast an Oscar-winning actress as the lead in what has essentially an aura of a B-movie. But Gwyneth Paltrow certainly has what it takes to elevate what might seem light material to a memorable and worthwhile movie experience. She plays herein perhaps the most straightforwardly likeable character that she's played in any movie other than SHALLOW HAL (a more mixed bag of a movie overall, I believe). Her character goes for her dream, and gets where she gets fairly and squarely, never scapegoating anyone else unjustly for any setback. I could have stood to see Christina Applegate cast in a better role, but she does what it takes to make the movie work through the role that she has. So, her performance here leaves nothing to be desired, even though I liked her better in THE SWEEEST THING. Equally surprising is a quirkily satisfying performance by Mike Meyers. If you expect him to provide the movie with much of its element of comedy, well, he does do that. But still he shows a talent with a versatility extending well beyond the several characters he played in the AUSTIN POWERS series. So, if this movie starts of showing little promise of being a high-flier, bear with it. There will be enough surprises and memorable characters to make it well worth seeing. And while it has considerable ""chick-flick"" elements, it should nonetheless be a likeable feel-good movie for all viewers.",1057795200,5,1814,4.761904761904762

Here's the thing:  I went to the theater expecting an hour and a half of so-bad-it's-good fluffball comedy, and really enjoyed ""View From the Top"" in spite of myself.  The whole movie all but begs not to be taken seriously, which is probably the reason why it works as well as it does.  Appropriately for a movie about the airline industry, this is pure escapism, in the well-worn motif of a trailer-park kid who decides she wants more out of life and, after a few mildly hard knocks, gets it.  Donna, a store clerk somewhere in rural Nevada, decides on a career as a flight attendant on a lark after her boyfriend dumps her, and promptly sets her sights on the New York-to-Paris route despite a hilariously bumpy start in the business.  Of course, this is America, and all Donna has to do is work hard, be patient and persistent, and look like Gwyneth Paltrow.  (Casting Paltrow as trailer trash is about as convincing as you'd expect it to be, but her acting is great as usual.)
While the movie never really tries to be very serious, it will probably elicit a knowing nod or two from anyone who has suffered an unfair setback at work or felt like it was taking too long to climb the professional ladder.  (In other words, it's the perfect comedy for today's job market!)  The corollary plot about Donna's on again, off again relationship with her law-student boyfriend is a bit too treacly and old-fashioned to be really enjoyable, but the story's final twist resolves this in a cute, if utterly unconvincing, way.
In any case, the main focus is on the slapstick comedy portions of the story, while plot advancement is mostly an afterthought.  (I couldn't decide whether or not this was intentional, but it really doesn't matter.)  With so much bad news in the real world today, the fact that it's all so unconvincing is really part of the fun anyway.  Recommended if you need a laugh!",1054771200,,2104,4.640540540540541

a) the movie takes place in the sixties, when ""stewardesses"" were considered glamorous.
b) It's a wacky comedy.
NOT TRUE.  It takes place, sadly, in our time.  It would have been more fun had the cheesy uniforms and the ""jet-setting stew"" been more a focus.
Also, while there are occasional moments of comedic hijinks, the movie is actually a fairly low-key romantic comedy.  If you're in the mood for a laid back, pleasant but hardly hot romance, then go ahead and enjoy.
Gwyneth Paltrow and the terrific Mark Ruffalo (YOU CAN COUNT ON ME) are the on-again, off-again couple.  Mostly, we follow Paltrow, as she strives to fulfill her dreams of becoming a flight attendant with the New York - Paris route.  Not exactly the stuff of high drama.  Kelly Preston plays an acquaintance who joins her on her ""quest"" and Christina Applegate is another friend, whose dealings are just a bit suspect.
Mike Myers, featured heavily in the trailers, is in a supporting role as a trainer.  His character really belongs in a different movie, but that's not really Myers' fault.  He is amusing, and generates virtually the only out-loud laughs in the movie.
So, just be warned before you go.  This movie is not for little kids...there isn't too much that's terribly objectionable, but they will be BORED, BORED, BORED.  Probably not for teen boys either.

Because whenever things took a down turn, and just when our protagonist, the beautiful Miss G, was about do lose her dream, the director's invincible hand would always come to the rescue and to straighten things up again.",1049500800,,567,4.824742268041237
1470654,5,B00005JLZ2,"This was such a great movie. Don't listen to the critics. Its harmless, fun, free, funny, and overall great! I saw it with my girlfriend and we both loved it. Mike Myers is as funny as when he is in Austin Powers! See this movie its light and fun. Candice Bergen was so funny and it was a great escape! See it. Im going to buy the DVD!",1049328000,2,335,3.9411764705882355
1470655,5,B00005JLZ2,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie.  Release delays usually bode ill, but not this time!  Paltrow did an excellent job in her portrayal of a rural girl reaching for the sky.  Her many talents were evident.  Bergen and Myers added their experience and acting expertise, as did Christina Applegate.  Although the story came to a rather hasty end (editing?), the result was quite satisfying.  Others in the theatre seemed pleased with the experience.  It was a great evening.  I'll be back to see this one again on ""the silver screen"".  Great costumes and an innovative story kept View From The Top crusing on target for Paltrow, and especially Applegate.  Don't miss it!",1048464000,6,678,4.817391304347826
1470656,2,B00005JLZ2,"Why did they make this movie? How did it go so (bad/stupid/pointless)? And how did stars the caliber of Gwyneth and Mike Myers get involved?
I am not involved in the movie biz except as a regular viewer and I can tell that this flick somehow went hugely astray. This was not, and cannot be the movie they set out to make the first day the producer said, ""hey, my Dad has a barn!""
If you've seen the previews, you need to know that will not be the movie you will see when the lights go out. Mike Myers is goofy and entertaining. If the director had gone that way with the whole movie, I'd be a happy consumer. Gwyneth is a sweet and lovable in the rest of the movie, and if the director had gone that way with the whole movie, then my wife would have been a happy consumer. Instead, they created a hash that left both demographics bored and unhappy. Movies are supposed to generate a big emotional response; goofy, romantic, sadness, patriotism, fright. This one generates a capital letter WHO CARES!!!
I'm the guy who can sit through anything and be entertained. On this one, though, save not only your $ at the theater, save your $ when it comes out on video. Oh, why 2 stars and not 1? Because I liked Mike Myers, and I really enjoyed ripping this movie at dinner with my wife. That was easily worth an extra star.",1048464000,3,1316,4.289156626506024
