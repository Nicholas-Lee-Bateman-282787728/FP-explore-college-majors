4320714,1,B004BW1ZIO,"Oh my...what a waste of talent we have here. This could have been an emotional, compelling drama about the strains a family undergoes with life changes (sexuality, growing older, the decline and loss of an adult parent), instead it's just curiously colorless and blah. If this had been a well-done movie, instead of a mediocre melodrama, it would have had rises and falls of angst, heartbreak and would have posed serious questions about morality and love. But EVERYDAY simply coasted along, flatlining when it should have held our interest, and, in the end, I felt like, ""so what?""

4320715,4,B004BW1ZIO,"Writer and producer Richard Levine is known for his work as executive producer, writer and director for TV series ""Nip/Tuck"" and his work on ""Stark Raving Mad"" and ""Jag"".  His primary work has been with television but with situations happening in his personal life, Levine was able to get personal and write a loosely-based story of those elements that took place when his wife's estranged elderly father came to live with them and how it affected the family.

Working together with independent film producer Miranda Bailey (""The Squid and the Whale"", ""The Oh in Ohio"", ""Dead & Breakfast""), Levine wrote and directed ""Every Day"", a low budget film which would feature an all-star cast with Liev Shreiber (""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", ""Salt"", ""Defiance""), Carla Gugino (""Watchmen"", ""Sin City"", ""Night at the Museum""), Helen Hunt (""Mad About You"", ""As Good as it Gets"", ""Twister"", ""What Women Want""), Brian Dennehy (""Ratatouille"", ""First Blood"", ""Romeo+Juliet""), Eddie Izzard (""Valkyrie"", ""Ocean's Thirteen"", ""The Riches""), Ezra Miler (""City Island"", ""After School"") and Skyler Fortgang (""Damages"", ""American Gangster"").

""Every Day"" is a 2010 film which focuses on a family in New York.

Ned (played by Liev Schreiber) is a writer for a TV series in which his demanding boss Garrett (played by Eddie Izzard) wants more sensationalism in his scripts and since they are not good enough, they are constantly rejected.  Ned is married to Jeannie (played by Helen Hunt), a former working professional who is now stressed out that her estranged father Ernie (played by Brian Dennehy) is no longer able to take care of himself and now he must move in with them.

Jeannie has never ever gotten along with her father and Ernie just wishes they left him for dead instead of moving him to New York to live with them.  So, now Jeannie is in a high-stress moment as she must now become a caretaker for her father and constantly bring him to the hospital for tests and take care of him.  And each time she shows compassion, Ernie just shows contempt.  He is rude and is always talking badly to her.

Meanwhile, both parents try to take care of their two sons Jonah (played by Ezra Miller) and Ethan (played by Skyler Fortgang).  Jonah is a teenage boy who just came out of the closet and is now starting to become more alert to boys around him.  For Ned, it's hard for him to take it in that his son is gay and is not so accepting of his son taking part in a gay student association and going to a gay prom.  Meanwhile, Ethan is a young boy trying to learn how to play the violin and is curious to those around him.

For Ethan, he tends to be picked on by his grandfather Ernie, a music enthusiast (who often has dreams when he listens to music that he is playing drums for a big band), who wants Ethan to improve his violin playing but Ernie uses Ethan to get some pills, which Jeannie is trying to make sure her father doesn't try to kill himself.

Because the task of having to take care of her father becomes to difficult, Jeannie thinks its best he stay in a facility where he would be taken care of.  But it would cost $4,000 a month which she and Ned would have to pay for.  And for Ned, it's difficult because although he works as a television writer and gets paid a good salary, his work continually is getting rejected and he worries about his job and also worries about his family.

But because the added tension in Ned's personal life and his work life, his boss pairs him up with one of the veteran writers, Robin (played by Carla Gugino), a free-spirit and a woman who just recently broke up with her boyfriend.  She knows that Ned lives a standard, traditional family life but in order to get him to produce the work that he needs for their boss, Ned needs to step out of the box.

So, when Ned joins Robin for a writing session, he is shocked that she lives in very nice home with a swimming pool in the city.  Before they start writing, she strips out of her clothes into a bikini and tells him that before they write, they must swim.  When Jeannie calls him, she tells him that she is waiting for him at their son's violin recital.  Ned tells him that their boss is expecting him to work late with writer Robin and to work on a script.  When Jeannie hears Robin's voice, she is upset and feels that Ned may be with another woman.

As the tension continues to grow at home with Jeannie's problems with her father, his son Jonah who met a gay man at the GSA prom has asked him out on dates and now Jonah has been lying to his parents of his whereabouts.  For Ned, his time with Robin starts to change him as well as she encourages him to smoke weed, snort cocaine and eventually have sex together.  She wants to bring out the wild side in Ned and Ned notices how its starting to work for his writing but also helping him forget about his problems in his personal life.

Until something happens to his family... one night.

VIDEO:

""Every Day"" is presented in 1080p High Definition.  For the most part, as a low-budget film, I felt that Richard Levine and cinematographer Nancy Schreiber did a fine job in capturing the various locations where the family members frequent.  The shot and location at Robin's home is well-done, capturing the hospital and retirement home during Jeannie and Ernie's scenes were well-done, capturing the gay club atmosphere for Jonah was also well-done and for the most part, for a low-budget film, you don't expect to see many shot locations but for this film, you do.

For the most part, picture quality was very good for the film.  Detail was very good.  Skin tones were natural, blacks were nice and deep.  While some scenes (which use neon and red lights, typically involving Jonah at the prom or dance club) tend to look like there was slight banding, for the most part, I didn't notice any particles or compression artifacting.  Overall, picture quality for this film was good.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Every Day"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  For the most part, this film is a dialogue driven film.  Dialogue is crystal clear and you get some scenes with good jazz music, especially during Ernie's scenes which sound great.  But there are scenes for example when Jeannie is at the hospital with her father, you can hear the hotel ambiance and hospital speaker through the surround channels.  You can also hear music and other crowd ambiance type scenes through the surround channels.  But for the most part, this is a center and front-channel driven film and lossless audio soundtrack works for this type of film.

Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Every Day"" is a film that captures the struggles of today's American family.  From getting older, having to take care of elderly parent(s) and children who become teenagers and that time in you life at your lowest moment in hopes that you will find that shimmer of light, that hope in letting you know that things will be OK.

""Every Day"" is one of those films where the writing was solid, the performances were well-done and forget that this a low-budget, independent film...not only did I find it entertaining, I also found it touching because although many American families may not have similar experiences as the family depicted in the film, there are elements in the film that parents, elderly parents, teenagers can easily understand because they have felt the same way.

As a man who is about to approach his 40's with a family and constantly thinking about the future, what happens to your own parents when they grow older, your children when they become teenagers and also providing for your family, I can understand these characters.  And it helps knowing that these elements are not contrived or trying to find some banality of similar type of dysfunctional family films, this is a film that is based on the writer/director's life.

I've known people throughout my life who have had to take care of their elderly parent.  For some, it's not so bad, for others, it became a nightmare.  And unfortunately, not everyone can afford to put their parent up in a facility and the demands of doctor's appointments, medical tests, surgery, etc. is a reality for a lot of people in America.  Jeannie's stressful time of her life is easily understandable.

For Ned, being a husband with a wife who is constantly stressed out and busy with her estranged father, a parent who can't identify with his gay son... once again, I think it's a situation that many people can understand.

But I have to say that for an independent, low-budget film, it's one thing in creating a film in a short time period but to get as many location shots for this film was well-done.  ""Every Day"" may have had a low-budget but it achieves an efficacy that many other similar big-budget films fail to accomplish. Cinematography was very good and performances were great.  For the most part, ""Every Day"" is a film with a storyline that works when it focuses on the family.  The only thing that I had small problem with the screenplay is the working relationship with Ned and his boss Garrett.  The kind of things that the boss wants Ned to produce for his writing were a bit outrageous and over-the-top.  I can see reality TV trying to push the button but for a dramatic TV series, but how realistic was the situation?  I don't know but if Richard Levine has encountered this type of treatment on ""Nip/Tuck"", but it makes me wonder how outrageous and out of the box he had to go in writing for that TV series.

Overall, ""Every Day"" is delightful, touching and enjoyable!  Featuring an all-star cast with wonderful writing and magnificent performances, the film will definitely hit home for a lot of parents who are facing many challenges in their own families and are looking for hope.  Recommended!",1300233600,5,10232,4.655902004454343
4320716,5,B004BW1ZIO,"What if what you thought you were missing in life you already had?  A writer for a TV show, Ned (Schreiber) is stuck in a job where his boss demands more and more strange things.  His wife Jeannie (Helen Hunt) has just brought her father home to take care of.  His son is gay and Ned is trying to avoid admitting it, and his co-worker (Gugino) is another reason his life is spinning out of control.  So many movies and TV shows come out that claim to be true to life, or ""Reality Shows"", they usually turn out to be so over the top they end up borderline spoofing the stars.  This is one huge exception.  While not being a reality show at all, this is the most true to life movie I have seen in a while.  It was depressing in parts, but again because it seemed like they just took a family and watched how they live and made a movie from it, without changing anything.  Ned is stuck trying to sort out what his life has become that he finds himself trying to be someone he isn't.  This movie is another glaring example of how unless you have a $200 million budget and your movie make $400 million in theaters you will get no recognition or advertising.  There are no big name stars in here like Tom Cruise or Katherine Heigle, and because of only casting good actors and relying on script and acting, it gets overlooked.  Which is a travesty. I give it an A.

Would I watch again? - Yes I would, but again it would lose some of the effect.",1299542400,2,1439,4.173913043478261
4320717,5,B004BW1ZIO,"EVERY DAY is a dramedy about ""life,"" the every day living kind of life.

Television writer Liev Schreiber and his wife of nineteen years (Helen Hunt) are finding their lives to be rather difficult these days.

Not only has their older son (Ezra Miller) declared that he is ""gay,"" a fact that Schreiber is having problems accepting, but now his cantankerous, incontinent father-in-law (Brian Dennehy) is moving into their home, and Hunt is miserable with that because she and Dad have never really gotten along.

Things are just as bad on Schreiber's work front.  The egomaniacal producer of his series (Eddie Izzard) is not happy with the scripts that he his turning out, so he assigns Liev to work with another writer on the staff, the very sexy Carla Gugino, who is determined to seduce him.

EVERY DAY is a fine, well-acted film, one in which virtually any viewer can identify with and care about the multi-dimensional characters and their various plights.  Daily vicissitudes, particularly when one has a family, are not easy.  Indeed, as expressed by the film's writer-director (Richard Levine), who based his sensitive script on events in his own life, getting successfully through a day can almost be ""heroic"".

4320718,4,B004BW1ZIO,"I happened to catch this on a movie by demand channel and selected it because I'm a fan of Helen Hunt. I hadn't seen her in much lately. I was pleasantly surprised by the depth and realistic portrayal of the stresses and strains of juggling the role of caregiver with balancing the rest of family life - keeping a marriage together and dealing with the kids.

My only criticism of this movie is that Hunt, in her role as Jeannie, comes across as so desperately unhappy, bitter, and angry that she borders on being shrewish at times. On the other hand, she is in a very difficult situation, with a very unhappy, demanding, and critical father as well as the usual challenges of a home, marriage, children, etc.

Even though her unhappiness is understandable, it is sometimes hard to feel sympathy for her. She has difficulty maintaining any perspective. She is frequently so upset that I  found it easy to understand why her husband felt lost on the sidelines at times (although he does his best to help ) and also why her children were frequently confused and scared. Her husband also (again, understandably) finds it hard to resist the appeal of an attractive co-worker who makes it clear she is open to evenings full of sex as well as work projects.

In spite of any issues with this movie, any viewers (raising hand) may well relate to Jeannie's challenge of trying to care for an aging parent. The primary duties fall to her and she is clearly over her head. She already had a difficult relationship with her father before he became ill and having him move in with her and the rest of her family doesn't make things easier. Brian Dennehy is superb as the father who struggles with both alcoholism and suicidal impulses. He is frequently harsh and critical, not only of Jeannie but also with her children. Lieb Schrieber holds his own as Ned, Jeannie's husband. Then there is Eddie Izzard, who gives a strong, solid performance as Ned's boss.

To complicate matters even more, one of Jeannie and Ned's children, Jonah (Ezra Miller) is gay and Ned is having a hard time accepting this. Jeannie is relatively supportive and this is a sore point between her and Ned.

As the movie unfurls, there isn't exactly a ""happy"" ending but there is true growth in most of the characters. The movie completely held my interest but that may be only because I related so strongly to the theme. It isn't exactly a sunny or upbeat film. But it is well done and honest. If you're a caregiver for an elderly person, this may be one of the few films that you'll find which doesn't gloss over the realities.",1296259200,6,2589,4.593073593073593

4320724,5,B004BW1ZIO,"EVERY DAY resonates with audiences because it is a story that tackles some heavy themes and shows that there is light at the end of every seemingly impossible tunnel. Writer/director Richard Levine has much experience with the topics raised in this film from his broad work as a television writer. The dialogue is smart, sassy, touching and insightful, and that, coupled with a very fine cast, makes this a movie to relish.

This day really isn't all that different than every other day, except today Ned's (Live Schreiber) gay son Jonah (Ezra Miller) wants to go to a college party, his wife Jeannie (Helen Hunt) is bringing home her elderly father Ernie (Brian Dennehy) whom she has never been able to tolerate to live with them, and his outrageous boss Garrett (Eddie Izzard) seems to have become even more crazy and demanding than would even seem possible. As his wife tries to take care of her father and reconnect with him, Ned tries to reconnect with Jonah, and then without trying, he seems to have formed a connection with his co-worker Robin (Carla Gugino). Add to this Ned's younger son Ethan (Skyler Fortgang) is attempting to prepare for a violin performance and needs the support of his family, especially his gay brother. If he can get through days like these, he should be able to get through anything else life throws at him. The little miracles that happen in the hands of Levine's script are satisfying resolutions (for the moment, at least) for all the bumps in the road that occur every day.

The entire cast is strong, managing to be at times witty and caustic and at other times revealing that at the level of human emotions they are all very vulnerable, need, but survivors. This is a too often forgotten little film that is a pure pleasure to experience. Grady Harp, August 13",1375574400,,1801,4.714285714285714

4320726,2,B004BW1ZIO,"There is a good movie hiding in Everyday Day, unfortunately it is resigned the ""B"" plot in the movie.  Ironically Liev Schreiber (X-Men Origins: Wolverine) plays a screenwriter on a salacious cable television show who writes the ""B"" storyline on the show.  In this part of the movie Eddie Izzard (Mystery Men) plays his sleazy boss and naturally hits the role out of the park.  Then Carla Gugino (Karen Sisco) plays the office flirt.  Now there is a movie I would like to see.

Unfortunately at the end of the day Liev goes home to a life that he was already struggling with after his son came out as a gay homosexual and got even harder when his wheel-chair stricken father-in-law come to live with him despite already having a strained relationship with his daughter.  Even though Helen Hunt (Twister) as his wife and Brian Dennehy (She Hate Me) as her father give solid performances their scenes are hard to watch especially juxtaposed  with Liev's entertaining work life.

4320727,2,B004BW1ZIO,"This liberal family is pathetic, the leader (the man) of this family is pathetic.

The conclusions reached by this family are just as sad and wrong as the conclusions that got them where they were in the first place.

There is no such thing as ""Being Gay"", sure their are serious problems with getting our wires crossed as children and having life long struggles with inordinate sexual attraction but we cant spin 180 deg. and call it ""being"" anything.

Food for thought: 3% of the American population is counter-natural in regards their sexuality....Why do 75% of the movies Hollywood puts out retain this desensitizing propaganda of homo-sexual relationships, is it a desperate attempt to turn something repulsive into something ""normal""?

I rated at 2 stars instead of 1, simply for the resiliency and unheard-of intestinal fortitude of the wife in this sad scene, in her act of love toward her father and bearing under the unimaginable strain of her bitterly cynical father, in doing so she gave us a glimmer of hope into what is becoming an increasingly dark and lost movie making world.

Truly the modern liberal family is dreadful and lonely place to be brought up in.",1324944000,,1175,4.884422110552764
4320728,4,B004BW1ZIO,"The first time I watched Every Day was through Amazon Instant Video.  I knew some of the background and the mood of the film from reading reviews before the theatrical release, as well as some of the reviews from customers here on Amazon.com, so I knew this wasn't going to be the feel good, sunshiny happy, rainbows and unicorns fiesta of the year.

The first viewing left me somewhat indifferent and disconnected and feeling a wee bit guilty about my own relationship with my spouse and my child and my aging parents, being a caregiver, being the one needing care, etc, and more than a little anxious about the future...  I found many parallels and even some of the personality nuances felt so familiar.  The film really had moments that felt almost like cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute;. Almost, as the camera was not acknowledged by the actors, but watching the film I definitely felt more like a fly on the wall watching some very raw and real moments unfold in a very natural way, almost documentary like, that I felt like I was there rather than witnessing the story on my television set.  Very few parts of the dialog felt truly scripted, and they probably were moments the writer took from his own life that would seem natural to him, but to me they felt contrived.  For example, the mom (Helen Hunt) refers to the dad as ""Dada"" to her kids, which seems out of place to me, as the kids are older than the ""Dada"" age (in my opinion.  I've heard ""mama"" for all ages, but ""dada"" almost seems like a developmental step kids grow past and start using the word ""dad"" or ""daddy"").

The other moments, the frustration and exhaustion of caregiving, of wanting what is best for one's child, of being tempted because a few minutes of fantasy is a hell of a lot more appealing than the smelly, nasty pain of reality one may face during the other 23 hours and 45 minutes of the day... It all worked together beautifully.  Still though, I was left with somewhat of a down and somewhat of a ""meh"" feeling.  I felt like we got into the day to day trials and tribulations of this family, and I could relate to almost every character on some level, but I felt kind of indifferent toward them.  Sort of a ""nice movie but I'm not going to have a deep conversation about this or whimsically wander around in my head when I can't sleep at night wondering what happened the next day, the day after the story ended"" sensation.

A couple of weeks later I got the DVD in the mail and we popped it in.  I was stunned by the movie I was watching.  It was almost a completely different movie, but of course, I was the one who had changed.  Nothing particularly eventful had happened in my life, during those couple of weeks, but I think that after watching Every Day through the first time, having trudged along with the characters through their drudgery and confusion and their quest as individuals, and as a family, I was rewarded, in this second viewing with the magic that exists in even some of the most challenge moments.  I was rewarded with being able to see the humor, the little exchanges, the ridiculousness of some of the moments, the joy still in other moments, even when things grew touch, the evolution of the characters over such a small period of time.  I laughed a few times during the 2nd viewing, which is something I never would have expected after the first go around. The story and voices resonated so much more  because I was able to see them as human rather than caricatures of people.

Like real life, things often need a second glance to see the value we missed in our hurried peek the first go around.  I definitely suggest watching this, waiting a couple of weeks, and watching it again.  Let me know if you have a similar experience.",1316563200,6,3745,4.502215657311669
4320729,3,B004BW1ZIO,"This movie has some very good actors, but the plot is slow and predictable. The 2 child actors are typical ""tiny adults"" who bear no resemblance to either of the actors portraying the parents. There are a few slightly sexually-charged scenes, with predictable outcomes. Helen Hunt is almost TOO worried, stressed and harassed. She is too thin and it is difficult to understand her reactions in the film. This film is well-done, just not particularly exciting or compelling. It is an ""easy watch"" for a day one wishes to view a film without much mental exertion.",1312934400,2,561,4.854166666666667
4320730,3,B004BW1ZIO,"Look at the cover photo, the two women slightly in the background smiling and happy, and Liev looks troubled.  Knowing nothing about this movie, what would you think about it?  Threesome?  Is he trying to choose between the two and can not make his mind up?

This movie is not a comedy, it is not funny, and it is not a fantasy.  Liev Schreiner is married to Helen Hunt, and as a husband(Ned) he has waaay too many problems and issues to deal with, sometimes kind of like in real life.  When he has to work with his co-worker Carla Gugino to complete his script for a TV show, she tries to put some sense into his life, but even that fails.

What good is living, if there isn't any fun in it?  Way at the end of the movie the family finally starts to have some fun by making music, but even that is interrupted by the grandfather dying in the middle of it.  I don't know, maybe that was supposed to be funny?

From where I am standing, most people want to have at least some fun in their lives, and if troubles are piling up and the amount of fun is approaching zero, at some point, it would make perfect sense to make a fresh start and rebalance things in life.

This is a good movie with good acting and a good story line.  It may be depressing for some people.  Don't expect to be entertained by it.",1311552000,10,1302,4.139442231075697

4320732,4,B004BW1ZIO,"I saw this film originally on a recent cruise aboard ship and
enjoyed it enough to purchase it on return.  It is a little
known barely seen indie comedy-drama starring Liev Schreiber,
Helen Hunt, and Brian Dennehy.  It centers on Schreiber, as a
husband and father whose marriage has become a bit tired, and
who learns his wife is bringing her aging and ill father to
live with them.  Brian Dennehy is her father, and he didn't
want to be there, preferring to live independently.  Liev
works for a gay TV producer as a script writer.  The producer
wants shocking, envelope pushing stories, which frustrates
Schreiber.  Meanwhile he has two sons, one about 11 and the
other, a gay high-schooler, which dad finds disturbing.  The
films plot centers on Schreiber's character both at work and
home, and a female co-worker who is exploiting his frustrations.
The movie could have easily become a tragic story of an affair
that destroys a family, and it walks a fine line.  Without
giving away what happens, I felt that it gets things mostly
right, and keeps a sense of humor about it, while addressing
the problems that many marriages encounter when the daily
grind of living, working, and familiarity, can push them to
the brink of breakup.  Not a great film, but definitely a
good rental, and for those not looking for chases and explosions,
maybe a keeper.",1308009600,,1354,4.752136752136752
4320733,3,B004BW1ZIO,"First of, let me get this out of the way early. Do not buy this movie. I reviewed it for free for the Amazon Vine program in a three-star rating that I gave it reflects that.  Had I paid actual money for this movie I probably would've given it one star rating. So I'm operating under the assumption here that you're either going to rent this movie or possibly watch it on a premium cable channel.

Every Day is just a bland story. It's just your average family trouble. The main character, Ned has to deal with bad relationship problems, bad in law problems, and bad children problems. Since all stuff that we've seen  done before and it is been done better. My main problem with the movie was that it's three co-current running plots were just too much for a film that ran a little over an hour. Though I will admit I'm not sure is a longer running time would've been enough to salvage this movie.

 It certainly watchable, the film has plenty of good actors. Liev Schreiber, Helen Hunt, Eddie Izzard,  Brian Dennehy, and the rest of the cast make the film watchable, but that's about it. It's just not that good of a story.

I wouldn't go out of your way to watch Every Day. You won't hate the film, but any trouble that you'd go through to see it would instill some sort of expectation in your mind that this movie is going to be good. And it's not. It's just okay.",1307145600,2,1368,4.299610894941634

In a flurry of family problems Ned must counsel his sons through their formative years, curb his frustration towards the imposition of his wife's father, and resist the exciting temptations of his female co-worker.

Overall, an evocative film that deftly captures the day in and day out grind of being a spouse and parent. It displays the importance of staying loyal to those who love you and care about you despite any obstacles that may interfere--stress, tedium, or temptation.

4320735,3,B004BW1ZIO,"Every Day can be misleading by looking at the cover. If you do not know what you are buying you may be highly disappointed. This is NOT a comedy or a happy movie but you wouldn't know if from looking at the cover. This movie is more about your every day troubles in life. The main character Ned is having a mid-life crisis and has to deal with many problems including bad marital problems, in law problems (sickly father in law moves in and takes up a lot of his wife's time), problems with his children (his son is gay), and a job that he is not satisified with. To sum is up this family really doesn't know how to be a family or how to relate to one another. This is a typical every day life movie so if you are trying to escape from your day this is NOT the movie to watch.

If you know what you are getting in to then this movie is a decent movie. The movie is depressing at times but life can be depressing at times. I just wish there was a little more happiness in the movie to keep me more entertained.

4320736,2,B004BW1ZIO,"As a big fan of Helen Hunt, I had high hopes for this movie. The general plot - a typical modern-day family juggling the pressures and challenges of everyday life, while adding a cranky grandfather riddled with health problems to the mix - also sounded promising. But overall, the movie was just plain depressing, and certainly didn't qualify as having any ""comedy,"" as the DVD jacket claimed. Despite being family members under one roof, everyone from the spouses to the two teen sons seemed to be living separate lives that didn't connect with one another at all, which is often true to life; but in a movie, their stories should intertwine somehow, and they really just didn't. Ultimately, I made it about 40 minutes into the movie and turned it off; I just didn't see a point to wasting my time for another hour.",1304553600,,816,4.673611111111111

Please bear with me through a few paragraphs of preamble, which are a bit removed from the story line, but intentionally so in order to set the pace:
This story crawls forward against a background of the beginning of the end of the ""American Dream"" as America's social structures are falling apart, gasoline is a $4.50. Taxes alone are driving some people into bankruptcy because they can neither sell their houses nor afford the taxes. Politicians are splitting the nation in half trying to confiscate/destroy unions, and everyone's pensions and health care, except their own. Drive-by shootings of innocent children is now a hobby for some sicko's, rapidly replacing violent, sadomasochistic, porno, and video games.

Five percent of the richest people on the planet paid no income taxes last year and yet want bigger tax breaks and GE made $114 billion and paid no income taxes. There are serial nutcase murderers running amok in the big cities, suburbs and rural areas chopping up women, children and goats. Two successive presidents have involved us in fighting, God knows how many wars for the last 10 years at a cost per annum of $1 trillion and an overall debt passing $19.3 trillion, including Bush having blown Clinton's $5.9 Trillion surplus on wars and No-Bid Contracts and President Obama trying hard to put us deeper into debt with accelerating new and endless wars. I could go on endlessly also, but why bother, you already know what is depressing about life in the 21st Century, but I tell you all of this not to depress you as much as that if/when you watch this movie, you will come running back arms spread wide to the realities, back to read the first few paragraphs of this review, because in retrospect, you know that after watching the movie, my depressing intro, in comparison, may cheer you up.

Well, except another thing that may cheer you up is the gorgeous Carla Gugino, Carla Gugino in tights, Carla Gugino in a bikini and Carla Gugina nude, in her in-house swimming pool, and trying to entice Ned into a swimming pool seduction, which he appears to be struggling to avoid. Believe me, those ARE the high lights of this film, and about the only thing that may put a satisfied smile on your face regardless of your gender. However, even in those moments there are depressing, fun killing moments.

The description calls this film a ""warm and wise comic drama"" which warmness, wisdom, and especially its ""comic"" aspect I must have slept through. The DVD-Every Day, is a story about a person - Ned, who writes bizarre, sadomasochistic porn, for a TV series and including such serial killers I mention above in which calling the scripts ""edgy"" is an understatement. His wife brings her dad home from a nursing home to look after him herself, and then does nothing but complain about him. Her older teen son is a budding homosexual and his dad, the writer is predictably, displaying more than a bit of homophobia and thus appears to worry about his son being raped by an older homosexual and more than that, fears that his may ""hook-up"" with any homosexual, older or otherwise. His wife does not share his views on that subject; the younger son (who I though was a little girl for 1/3 of the film, and no he is not homosexual, he just looks like a little girl) is a normal kid who is understandably confused.

Ned's wife climbs into bed each night, but before he can climb upon her, she is off on rants about her fathers zero tolerance, and his incontinence and his miserable personality and mouth. When Ned is on the edge of being fired or quitting, gorgeous Carla Gugino, for God knows what reason, wants him come to her mansion to work overtime and to jump her bones. By now, overworked on stuff he hates, with no access to sex with his wife, for a life choice she made concerning her father who is verbally abusive to one and all, our hero Ned, writer of sadomasochistic, porn is now hornier than a Hefner with his harem surrounding him, but alas, can't find his Viagra.

How will it all end? Will Ned be seduced by Carla? Will the old man experience an epiphany? Will Ned be fired? Will an older gay man rape the Teen son? Will the younger son become more, or less, confused? Will the younger brother shake off the old man's annoying sarcasm?

Despite all of the heaviness, the film's redeeming features are glimpses of brilliance here and there in the acting and direction. Problem is who cares? If I want misery, I can drive into Chicago and watch the new mayor turn the town into a living specimen of God knows what civic horror...if I could afford the round trip gas bill.

Hey, maybe I was a bit harsh but I do not know the variety of reasons for which other people watch movies. I only know why I do. I watch them expecting them to be uplifting, fun and riveting. If I want reality, I can get that way from Documentaries by Ken Burns or Michael Moore, or any news channel. The only way I would normally watch this sort of movie is by my wife's request, and then only if the ushers rivet me to my seat.

Helen Hunt is Helen Hunt and she plays her depressing struggle with her conscience part well enough, as always. Liv Sheiber is the long-suffering husband/father (Ned) of the two boys, one of which I thought was a girl for half the movie. (Maybe because I was losing interest so rapidly and monumentally.) Brian Dennehy who has won several major industry awards, was excellently annoying as a dying man with a miserable personality. The problem was that it didn't all come together for me, maybe because it kept hopping about, five minutes with the Homosexual son at a ""Gay Prom,"" five minutes with the old man berating the younger son, five minutes at Ned's studio, five minutes of Ned in the water nude with Carla Gugino, etc. That jumping about like a Wile Coyote/Road Runner, cartoon, disconnected the film for me. At least those cartoons cause you to smile and even laugh.

However, all of that being said, if you appreciate soap opera and enjoy watching bitterly disappointing, depressing slices of life in movies, you my well love this one. I did not, sorry. That is as much as I can tell you without ruining the story and how it plays out for you.

Three (3) stars are the best I could give it with 2.75 of those stars for the very sight of Carla Gugino, wearing anything or next to nothing. Oh, near the end you may encounter what you may think are positive, uplifting notes, but don't you believe that for one moment. Do you now see what is happening? Most people think I am a very upbeat person, but this film has damaged me. They should have given this warning on the label:
""If you are a Chicago Cub Fan and are used to disappointment and depression, nevertheless, this film will still make you still more depressed."" Maybe it is just me, and K am a Chicago Cub fan, God help me, and I hate depressing films. So, watch it if you like, but just don't tell me, because knowing that will just depress me.",1304294400,2,7105,4.6586921850079746
4320738,3,B004BW1ZIO,"Brian Dennehy's role in this film was different from anything I have seen by him.  Whoever cast him for the part as the father-in-law with one foot in the grave did a brilliant job.  He looked so different from prior  characters I have seen that I almost did not recognize him.  He is not the big burley figure of his role of the Sheriff in Rambo First Blood.  He was emaciated and frail and fit the part of a cancer treatment patient with urinary incontinence perfectly.

I also had a typecast problem with Liev Schreiber.  I have not seen anything major from him other than his roll in the last X Men movie.  I found myself expecting him to stick up his hands revealing long razor sharp fingernails.

As far as the part of the wife, played by Helen Hunt.  It was a Typical roll that we have seen her portray in several film and television series. While I think she is very tallented and attractive for her age I have grown tiresome of her typical roll of the habitually agonizing woman.

As for the film story itself I found it to be a heartwarming story that hit close to home from problems dealing with an adolescent gay child to dealing with aging parents.

I don't want to make this review into a spoiler so I won't go any deeper.  I would recommend this movie if you are a Brian Dennehy fan.

I would not recommend the film for children because of some of the sensitive moral issues that are presented.  Overall I would give the film 3 stars, mainly due to Brian Dennehey's performance.",1303430400,2,1493,4.378181818181818

4320741,3,B004BW1ZIO,"Every Day

I haven't heard too much about this film prior to watching the DVD. Although Carla Gugino is on the cover art, her character isn't developed very much throughout the film. The key protagonist is Lieve Schreiber's Ned, and how he deals with situations that arise every day in his life. Although other reviewers believe this film to portray what people encounter on a daily basis, and I have to agree to a certain extent, I felt a lot of the topics (the son's sexual preference, the grandfather's death wish) were sensationalized or hyped to the push the film a bit towards the edge. Carla is one of my favorite actresses but I was disappointed to see her character written in a two dimensional manner. She is the dynamic single co-worker that refuses to settle down and parties hard. Ned's job is also quite over the top, as a writer for a cable show that I still don't quite understand.

In sum, the film wasn't horrible but it's not a must-see, more like a could-rent on a rainy day.

Overall: 3/5 stars",1302307200,,1015,4.53551912568306
4320742,5,B004BW1ZIO,"'EveryDay is a lovely film for adults that does not have silliness, violence, weird druggy scenes, excessive, foul language and other junk that usually make for an adult film. Still it is rated 'R' for sexuality. But the every day world of 'EveryDay' considers the stresses of raising a teenager who is discovering himself as gay, a declining older parent, Brian Dehenny, being moved into the family home by Helen Hunt, his daughter, and the long suffering husband/parent, Liev Schrieber, trying to make sense of it all.

While viewing this film I had to put it on pause for a few of hours while I lived my own every day life. During that time I found myself thinking about this family as if they were my own relatives. I looked forward to getting back with the family as soon as I could. There is a lot of adult wisdom and gentle, loving entertainment in 'EveryDay.'  I highly recommend it.",1302307200,,891,4.59748427672956
4320743,3,B004BW1ZIO,"This movie has some excellent actors depicting their mundane life--if you can call trying to adapt to the fact that your son is gay and a very disgusting father-in-law has moved into your house and has taken up a huge amount of the wife's time.  It is also the test of a marriage going through these trials, an unsatisfying job, an alluring co-worker, a wife over 40. But it also is an example of the love of family.
The movie never really rises above a mundane level however.

The DVD has English and Spanish subtitles, a trailer and cast interviews and some very short deleted scenes.",1301961600,,586,4.518867924528302
4320744,3,B004BW1ZIO,"I'm not sure what I expected from Every Day, but it is not what I got.  Based on the description and the fact that I had liked City Island (also from Image Studios), I decided to give this a try.  I don't think the information on the product page gives you a good sense for what Every Day really is, and I hope to give you a better chance at deciding if this is for you.  Ned (Liev Schreiber) is the main character.  His wife Jeannie (Helen Hunt) is stressed because her father Eddie (Brian Dennehy) is moving in.  He has a litany of medical problems, and he can no longer live on his own.  His older son Jonah (Ezra Miller) is gay, and Ned is having a hard time coming to terms with this.  Professionally, Ned is a writer for a TV show that has to have a minimum number of ""shocking"" moments per episode.  It seems that Ned is the new guy, but this is not entirely clear.  His boss Garrett (Eddie Izzard) is over the top in what he considers shocking.  Basically if he's seen it before, it won't do.  Garrett assigns Robin (Carla Gugino) to help Ned with his rewrites.  Robin has just broken up with her boyfriend, and this creates temptation for Ned who's stuck in his routine.

The plot plays out in a fairly predictable way, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.  What is not so good is that it seems that Every Day tries to follow Garrett's principles.  On screen drug use plays a larger role than I would have cared for.  Jonah finds himself in a pretty dicey situation that, while plays out through his being gay, could just as easily happen in heterosexual scenarios too.  I don't want to give too much away, but I found it disturbing because of the potential for his peril more than anything.  In reality, none of these things are new or groundbreaking in film.  However I don't think the product description does a good job advising potential viewers of the content.  If you seen Helen Hunt and expect something along the lines of As Good As It Gets, (like me) you will be disappointed.  The movie does have good moments of comedy and drama, and I thought that the actors played their parts well.  If you don't mind the elements that I have mentioned above, you will likely enjoy Every Day.  However if you don't like your movies a little more straight laced, it would be a good idea for you to pass on this one.",1301788800,,2325,4.318706697459584
4320745,3,B004BW1ZIO,"I have great affection for independent films and their freedom to explore avenues deemed too small and/or quirky to warrant a major motion picture's budget and distribution. That said, I found Every Day disappointing. The best thing about the film is the beautifully crafted performance by Helen Hunt and the multi-nuanced performance by Brian Dennehy.  The worst thing about the film is the inconsistent quality of the storylines. This is frustrating because the potential for a really good film is there, but not realized.

It is no easy task to breathe life into a tired old male mid-life crisis storyline, and this film broke no new ground. The character of Ned, stoically played by Liev Schrieber, is self-indulgent, predictable and unsympathetic. It's hard to like Ned. He sells-out his integrity by both staying in a job he hates and betraying his family by romping with a co-worker just when they really need him. If we show what we are made of when things are difficult, then Ned is made of tissue paper.

After his wife Jeannie, played by Helen Hunt, brings her infirmed father (Brian Dennehy) to live in their home, we watch her wrestle with the burden of physically caring for someone she has long since stopped caring for emotionally. As conflicted as she is, her integrity dictates she must take care of her father. This struggle involves sacrifice on many levels. Her burgeoning career is put on hold and attention to family must be doled out in small increments sandwiched between juggling endless doctor's appointments, mountain of prescriptions and difficult demands from her unloving father.

Jeannie isn't cast as an angel. Early on she makes some decisions that appear almost vengeful - like not shipping her father's electric scooter, claiming it was too heavy although she willingly had his favorite easy chair and ottoman sent along. That decision left her father in a manual wheelchair, greatly impeding his mobility and independence. It seemed arbitrary and done to punish and control him as he had done to her when she was a child, equally helpless. This storyline has substance and rings true.

Some things in the film were resolved too neatly. Some characters were never properly fleshed-out and their actions seemed designed primarily for shock value or to add interest where none existed. They seemed ill-used. Some plot points were delivered with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, leaving the impression the viewer's basic intelligence was underestimated. All of this eroded believability, and for me, intruded on the truly special moments. Characters and scenes could have been cut-out entirely and the film would have benefited.

The story swung wildly between painfully believable and genuine to insultingly improbable. The film gets three stars solely because the stellar performances of Hunt and Dennehy. But as good as they are, I would not watch this movie again and I would not recommend it to anyone.",1301443200,,2939,5.087136929460581

It's a few days in this families life and while this is a well made & great to look at motion picture,it's a rather quiet and a low key movie.
