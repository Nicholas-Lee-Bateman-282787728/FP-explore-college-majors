8591962,1,B00DCRE5PO,"I was very surprised by how bored I was. The storyline makes very little sense and the acting is minimal. Don't waste your money, like I did.",1517702400,,141,4.2592592592592595
8591963,3,B00DCRE5PO,"This is an entertaining film. I am glad that it did not contain profanity. This film would be rated PG. This film is about love and relationships. Vivica Fox is sexy as a talented book author. Fox always delivers interesting characters. She has a small but valuable part early on in the film.  Andre Truth is very good as a DJ who offers his advice on love. I would like to see Truth in more films. Joe Torry is funny as a man who gives terrible, worldly advice. Torry always delivers funny characters. Several characters in the film share their stories about love and relationships. They relate that their devotion to God enabled them to express love better and this improved their lives. The first story is silly and it should've been written better. The rest of the stories are good. At the end of the film several actors share their views on love. It seems as if the producers of this film really wanted to help the viewers improve their love life with all of the advice offered in this film. This film is recommended for people looking for a clean film about relationships.",1492300800,,1078,4.528205128205128
