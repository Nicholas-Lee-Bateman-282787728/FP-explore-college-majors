5774760,5,B00D4QPL1A,"I ordered this on Amazon.com and didn't regret the purchase. We normally don't watch all the dvd episodes in one sitting but we couldn't stop watching Luther and ended up watching all the episodes. This is an exciting drama that keeps you on the edge of your seat and rooting for the good guys.

Idris Elba's acting skills are superb! His character is a man with a get the job done attitude and who finds constructive ways to break the rules. He is loyal, driven, determined, tough, and yet vunerable in certain areas of his life. You may not agree with everything he does but you are still left thinking he had the guts to take a chance and do it in order to catch the villians and you admire him for it.

He has an abnormal, frightening and interesting relationship with one of the characters who is somewhat his nemesis. The whole cast consists of interesting characters played by most talented actors. I can't wait to see the next season of Luther.

Buy it; you won't regret it!",1291075200,3,982,4.4748603351955305

I can't recommend this enough.  Do yourself a favor and watch this series.  It will stay with you for months to come.",1289606400,37,376,4.3768115942028984
5774765,5,B00D4QPL1A,"I bought this DVD from the UK sight unseen, based on customer reviews. And after watching the first episode I thought I had made a mistake - it was not bad, but not as good as I had hoped, and I didn't particularly like Luther himself.

But, on a rainy Saturday afternoon a few weeks later, I finally decided to watch the next episode ... and ended up watching to the end, on the edge of my seat.

The episodes look gorgeous, as BBC productions generally do, and the stories are dark and gritty and very intense. Not for the squeamish. But perfect for anyone who appreciates an emotional, finely-crafted drama that will suck you in and surprise you at every turn.

While it is not necessarily as unique as it claims - in many ways, it is a fairly standard police drama, with a damaged detective with personal problems and all the people who have to put up with him - there are always ways to make the old genre feel new, and Luther does this brilliantly. The uniqueness of this series hinges on the characters, especially Alice, and on the twists and turns in the last two episodes that will take your breath away.

I haven't heard yet if this series has been renewed for a second season, but even if it isn't (and I sincerely hope it is), there is enough greatness here to make it one of those legendary shows that you never forget.",1284163200,158,1333,4.362903225806452
5774766,5,B00D4QPL1A,"Luther is an intense drama both on a human and police level.
There are no false notes as the acting and stories are realistic and believable.
The six shows can be watched individually but are best seen in sequence.
Idris Elbas DCI John Luther, a man with the ability to understand killers and capture them, is excellent.
Luther is a tortured man, who has lost his personal life in pursuit of killers.
Additionally, he has crossed the line to save a childs life, leaving her attacker in a coma.
His closest friend is an amoral killer, who wants to help him put his life back together.
These are not comfortable, sanitized crime shows, victims scream and bleed but the violence is in keeping with the mood.
The fourth show is one of the best hours of TV I have ever seen.

The actors speak English not American, accents are tricky, slang is different and I did suffer from a WHAT? factor from time to time.",1486252800,,904,4.4787878787878785

If I could give this series (and this attitude on the part of the so-called ""writers"" of the episodes) negative stars, I would.  I'm really sick of seeing women treated as interchangable objects to be thrown into a plot not for character, not for personality, not for relationships, but merely as convenient ""female things"" to act as victims and tension builders.

5774792,5,B00D4QPL1A,"Luther is one of those television shows that divides people, viewers and critics alike. To say the psychological crime drama received a mixed response when its first season, created and written by Wellington-based novelist and screenwriter Neil Cross, debuted in the UK last year, doesnt do justice to the divergent viewpoints it incited. Some hailed Luther as one of the very best things on TV in years. Others wrote it off as violent, over-the-top nonsense. One prominent UK critic even publicly changed his mind mid-season, backtracking on an earlier negative review  almost unheard of. The show received awards acclaim  including Golden Globe and Emmy Nominations for Best Actor for lead Idris Elba (who plays John Luther) and a prestigious TV writing award for Cross  but first season ratings were so-so.

Given all the above, it was with more than mild curiosity that I recently popped the first disc into my DVD player, and settled in to watch Crosss creation, and make up my own mind. As the title credits rolled, I wondered, would I love it, or hate it? Or fall somewhere in between.

Luther (Elba, of The Wire fame) is a near-genius detective with an explosive personality. He gets inside the heads of the worst criminals, but his work weighs heavy on him, and his personal life has fractured. In the first episode, Luther returns from extended leave (months earlier a child killer he was pursuing fell and is now in a coma) to investigate a brutal killing, a case that introduces him to Alice (Ruth Morgan), a young woman with much going on beneath her cold exterior. His planned reconciliation with estranged wife Zoe flops  shes met someone else  and he throws himself even more into work, the very thing thats undone his equilibrium in the past.

Elba is magnetic as Luther, bringing a gravitas to the role that transfixes even when things veer towards theatrical. Whether he was throwing things through windows or sitting quietly alone, I was mesmerised by his portrayal of a troubled man treading a tightrope between intelligence and insanity. But its not a one-man show; there are strong performances across the board, from Morgans Alice, to Indira Varma as Zoe, Saskia Reeves as Luthers boss, and Paul McGann as Zoes new lover. Each brings emotion and authenticity to the roles, none are caricatures.

Viewers will quickly notice Luther looks different to other British TV. It is shot beautifully, giving it a more cinematic than ultra-real police procedural look and feel. Each of the six episodes of the first season is exciting in itself, while at the same time ongoing issues bubble away in the background, exploding by the finale, where Luther is accused of a brutal murder and must enlist some unlikely allies to help catch the real killer before his colleagues  who think hes finally gone off the deep end  catch him.

Overall, I absolutely loved Luther. Was it over-the-top, less than realistic, as some said? Yes. Did it verge on theatrical? Yes. But damn it is good. Very, very good. For me, one of the best TV shows Ive watched in years. I accept its the type of show that not everyone will enjoy  it will click or resonate with some, and not others. Im just glad it works for me, because now I can really look forward to season two, which recently screened in Britain to widespread acclaim, and much higher ratings.",1443484800,2,3345,4.826923076923077

5774815,5,B00D4QPL1A,"Luther is equally intelligent as he is angry - and he can get pretty damn angry sometimes.

The sexy Idris Elba played Luther on the since-cancelled BBC show of the same name, which followed Detective Chief Inspector John Luther and the cases he solved while simultaneously trying to keep his head above water in his personal life.

In the first season, which is about as far as I will delve without an increased potential for spoiling anything, Paul McGann (Doctor Who) plays the new lover of Luthers estranged wife Zoe, which makes things more difficult for Luther, who is trying to win her back.  Simultaneously, in the first episode, Luther is convinced that Alice Morgan (Ruth Wilson) killed her parents but cant prove it, and she ends up becoming his odd confidante.  Alice is anything but subtle with her desire for a relationship with Luther.

But the real strength of the series is Luthers ability to solve crimes.  Hes sort of like Sherlock in the sense that he goes much deeper than what is obvious to the rest of his department on the surface to discover the true crimes that lie beneath, thus saving his people a great deal of time in chasing dead-end leads.  However, sometimes Luther blurs the lines between what is ethical (or even legal), which makes for a strained relationship with DS Justin Ripley (Warren Brown) who still otherwise looks up to Luther and would cover for him in a heartbeat.

Luther is also an incredibly passionate person, and he sometimes lets his emotions get the better of him, thinking nothing of bashing in a door at Zoes place, or throwing a fax machine through one of the windows of his office at the police department.

When it comes to quality television, you can usually count on the BBC, and Luther is yet another example of stellar output.  If you enjoy cop dramas, especially dark, gritty ones, then this is certainly a show that you should stream.

Though Luther only lasted three seasons (the BBC is great at getting out before they overstay their welcome), there have been discussions to make a film adaptation in order to close out the narrative.  Elba is convinced that it is in film where the ultimate Luther story lives.  Neil Cross, one of the co-creators of the show, has since confirmed that there will not be a fourth series of Luther, due to Elba's success in his film career, though Cross has also not closed the book on the potential for a future film as a closure to the series.

Cross also admitted back in 2012 that he was tossing an idea around of creating a spin-off series starring Alice Morgan, with Ruth Wilson reprising her role.  Cross said that while the BBC has definitely expressed an interest in such a project, he was unsure as to how many stories they would create, whether they would make it into a one-time miniseries, a recurring mini-series, or a possible co-production.

In August of 2013, it was confirmed by BBC News that Cross had finished the script for a Luther film, and that he was hoping that it would begin filming the following year, which would be around now.  The film would be a prequel, as opposed to continuing the story, following Luther during his earlier days of being married to Zoe, culminating in the final scene of the film becoming the first scene of the television show.

All I know is that if they decide to release the Luther film in a theater near me on this opposite side of the pond, I will be there with bells on to support the project.",1406505600,,3452,4.612745098039215
5774816,5,B00D4QPL1A,"This is a great show.  I like the British police and culture differences: not like shows in the U.S.  It is more like everyday life than glammed up representations of modern England for Yanks.

I started watching at 9:00 pm and I finished at 400 am.  I never intended to watch non-stop.  However, after one episode ended, the next episode would begin in 20 seconds; all the while showing the upcoming dramatic points...it had my attention.  I have only seen the 1st episode of Season 2. However, I just purchased via Amazon Seasons 1, 2, and 3.  I usually don't purchase tv series unless they are worth it.  And this series is defitinately worth it (for me).  I especially love the Luther/Alice duo.  She is absolutly crazy, but I think that is what makes her so likable. Great story lines and not so predictable as others.",1399939200,,752,4.518518518518518
5774818,4,B00D4QPL1A,"I started watching this series and I can see why Idris is starting to blow up the way he is. He has everything star quality and may one day surpass the stature of some of our greatest performers. His style is unique and his characters quite believable. You can feel the presence of Idris whenever he steps into a room. He knows how to take it up when he needs to and he also knows how to turn it down when necessary. I say this because there was a scene in one episode where a woman discovers that her husband is a rapist and murderer. She cried and lost control. Her acting was very believable. Her moment very emotional. Idris assisted her in the performance by becoming even more subdued, more subtle. He gave her the spotlight she deserved. I noticed that he has a humility and humbleness where he allows each actor to share in their moments. then when it is his time, he brings it. In addition to Idris  he is supported by a wonderful cast of great performers. The writing is good but not great. Shows like Scandal and House of Cards have spoiled me. But in the end, if you are looking for good television, Luther is one to check out.",1399939200,,1139,4.297674418604651

5774820,5,B00D4QPL1A,"I thought Idris Elba was great in The Wire but nothing prepared me for his performance in Luther.  As I said in the title this show is written more like a novel than TV series and the way it flows from beginning to end is just incredible.  Although a part of me wanted more, I think the British might be on to something with these short and finite series/mini-series where it is clear that the writer had a defined beginning, middle and end game in mind the whole time.  Such great characters: Luther, Alice, everyone at the police station, the Wife and even the boyfriend which could have been such a one dimensional character. Truly a show to watch again and to share with friends and family who love a good complex plot.  Only negative thing I can say is I did have to get used to the accents and watched the first 20 minutes or so with the subtitles on but once my ear got acclimated I was able to turn them off and had no other issues.",1394841600,3,940,4.23463687150838

5774826,5,B00D4QPL1A,"An exceptional mixture of character study and procedural, ""Luther"" focuses on the title character played by Idris Elba. Luther performs brilliantly as a police detective but his personal life remains in shambles--he's adrift living on his own after separating from his ex-wife who found him increasingly difficult to work with as he tackled more and more complex, dark and nasty crimes. As Luther drifted into the world of those he pursued, he drifted away from intimacy and his wife.

As well written and directed as ""Luther"" is what makes it outstanding is Elba's complex performance and the strong supporting cast that surrounds him. Nick Cross does a marvelous job of introducing standard genre elements and twisting them with his unique characters particularly the flawed John Luther. Without Elba's complex and sympathetic performance, as good as the writing and directing is here, it would fail without Elba.

SPOILERS:

The first season focuses on a home invasion that gones awry and Luther's suspect Alice (Ruth Wilson) a seemingly charming person who demonstrates a chilly interior and lack of emotional connection with everyone...except with Luther. Their intellectual game of cat and mouse dominates the first season even as other plot elements are introduced. Alice is every bit Luther's equal with the only major difference being Luther's ability to closely identify with the victims of the people he pursues.

END OF SPOILERS:

The first series consists of six episodes all presented in 16 x 9 for widescreen TV's.

The first season receives a very nice gritty looking transfer to DVD. I'm disappointed that (as of this date) ""Luther"" hasn't received a Blu-ray transfer as this show with its gritty, dark look would positively shine with the richer resolution of Blu-ray. Still, the DVD looks top notch for the show but keep in mind that the colors are deliberately dull looking in the show.

Detail is quite good.

Audio is exceptionally good with dialog crisp and clear with a nice stereo mix.

The special features are, sadly, limited. There are no commentary tracks, deleted scenes or outtakes given to us here. We do get a brief featurette on the series entitled ""Luther: The World of a True Maverick"". It runs around 30 minutes and does a good job of giving us some insight into the characters and the show.

Luckily ""Luther"" hasn't been remade for American television (and, if it was, it would probably pale in comparison to this show) so fans can dig in and enjoy the first three series of ""Luther"" (it is available as of this writing on Netflix which was my first exposure to the series).

5774835,4,B00D4QPL1A,"""Luther"" is in the style of BBC's ""Wallander"" or ""Prime Suspect"", a happiness-free zone, grim and unforgiving. The chief protagonist is very very good at the job, but not at being a coworker, and the personal life is likewise strangled. Psychology, criminal and relationship, is all important in ""Luther"" and its permutations are riveting and melodramatic. Series 1 (first aired in 2010) has six episodes with no separate titles. After episode 1, you have one cliffhanger after another.

Episode 1
At the very beginning, we see why Detective Chief Inspector John Luther had to take a medical leave of absence. This is a man who cracked and had to go through a Board of Inquiry (like the U.S. Internal Affairs). It exonerates him, but its a gray gray area. Luther was a troubled man before he let child abuser Henry Madsen fall three stories, and he's no less conflicted seven months later, when the series begins.

He's come back to work. And he has a new Detective Sergeant, Justin Ripley, who admires Luther and actually asked for the job. Their first crime scene together is the murder of Alice Morgan's parents. Alice, brilliant, spellbinding and psychotic. Luther begins an extraordinarily unhealthy relationship with Alice, which lasts throughout the series.

In addition, Luther wants to get back together with Zoe, his separated wife. That may be difficult, as she's in love with a new man, Mark North. A man without Luther's temper or distance.

Luther steals a token from Alice's apartment. She confronts him, and Luther replies, ""This isn't evidence. This is what you need to remind yourself of what you really are."" Unfortunately, knowing someone is guilty is not the same as proving she is guilty.

[As a side note, I highly recommend ""The Murder Room"", stories of real profilers and cold-case solvers, to see what Luther is getting at:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Murder-Room-The-Heirs-of-Sherlock-Holmes-Gather-to-Solve-the-World-s-Most-Perplexing-Cold-Cases/dp/1592401422/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Murder Room: The Heirs of Sherlock Holmes Gather to Solve the World's Most Perplexing Cold Cases</a>&nbsp;]

Episode 2
Two policemen arrive at an underpass to investigate the body of a man slumped against a wall, blood smeared on the wall behind him. Suddenly, the dead man springs to life and efficiently shoots and kills both cops. Luther and Ripley take in the scene. Luther says, ""It was an execution."" Since no one could have known which cops would respond to the call, it means the shooter was looking to shoot any cop. It's not hard to find people who want to shoot cops, but narrowing it down to efficient killers leads them to ex-soldiers, and a father-son relationship to beat all relationships.

But that's not all Luther has to worry about. Henry Madsen, who survived his fall, has come out of his coma. And the first thing he says is Luther's name. Alice has disguised herself as a doctor to sit at Madsen's side. She calls Luther, ""I think you turned into your true nature, just for a second, and let him fall. And you couldn't take it. You gave into guilt and self-loathing. How am I doing?""

Episode 3
Kirsten Ross is home midday with her baby, when Detective Inspector Philip Hamilton talks his way into her house. Then he pulls out a scalpel and, holding it against her cheek, murmurs, ""Either he [her husband] opens the door to find his wife and baby spread all over the carpet, or he comes home to find the baby safely asleep in its cot, but his wife gone. So, Kirsten, which is it to be?""

This is a red alert for the police. This kidnapping follows the form of one from 10 years before, where the victim was eventually found with all the blood sucked from her body. At that time, they were sure the killer was Lucien Burgess. Rich , manipulative, and, they're sure, at it again.

In the meantime, Alice causes Luther another round of problems with Internal Affairs. But only because she wants to ""help"" him.

Episode 4
The new case for this episode is a man who kills young women and lays out their bodies with the items in their purse placed in a pattern around their head. In previous killings, he took their empty purses. The fourth victim though, is missing only a necklace. Could the killer be giving these tokens as gifts?  If so, it has to be someone close to him, because the whole purpose of tokens (as we've seen with Alice) is that the killer needs to see them.

In a move that shouts Greek Tragedy of the Imperfect Hero, or, at the least, a major case of Freudian Denial, Luther visits Alice, with serious insight into his morality and state of mind: ""Henry Madsen woke up.... I will be put under surveillance. My movements. My phone calls. Everything. I think they're concerned that I might sneak in and finish the job.... I can't see you anymore. Can't talk to you. I'm sorry. I really am.""

If that isn't an indirect invitation to a psycho, I don't know what would be. Deep down, Luther has to know that.

Episode 5
James Carrodus, art dealer, and his wife, Jessica, are about to leave the country, when three people kidnap them. They know Carrodus has laundered millions of dollars into diamonds, and they want them. They'll hold Jessica, and James has two hours to come back with the diamonds or they cut Jessica. The robbers' leader tells Carrodus: ""I'm sure you're asking yourself, 'Is he bluffing?' I know you'll appreciate that it's in my best interests to prove that I'm not.""

Next we see Carrodus at the police station, asking for DCI Ian Reed. Since he's not there, Carrodus settles for Luther. He shows Luther a blood-soaked handkerchief, holding his wife's tongue. ""I came to see you because I haven't got what they want. And I have no way of getting it. Jessica swallowed them. The diamonds are inside her right now. If I'd have told them that, they'd have cut her open on the spot.""

Can they find where they're holding Jessica?  More important, why did Carrodus ask for DCI Reed by name?

Episode 6
This starts just minutes after Episode 5 ends. The forensic team is at Luther's house. Luther is stumbling through the city in grief and rage. Everybody thinks Luther is a murderer. They've seen his temper. They've seen the arguments. The Superintendent tells the assembled cops, ""I'm not interested in saving John Luther. I want the full of the law stomping down on his face before sunrise.""

Where can Luther go? Who can he turn to? No one but Alice Morgan. A devil's bargain indeed.

The implausibility rating started climbing for episode 5, but it's up to HIGH for episode 6. It didn't stop me from enjoying the show, but you do have to ignore the feeling that realism has jumped out the window.

This is a review of the DVD/Bluray of ""Luther Series 1"". The episodes are shown in 16:9 widescreen, with Dolby digital stereo sound. The eerie opening song is perfect: ""Paradise Circus"", by Massive Attack.

He's not the only reason to watch this show (they also have a fine supporting cast, terrific plotting and some really nasty villains) - but he's the main one. He's riveting on screen and commands every scene he's in. I have both seasons on DVD and can't wait for more.",1372550400,,560,4.242990654205608
5774838,5,B00D4QPL1A,"I've said for a long time that the British make better TV series than do we Americans.  Not necessarily better movies, but certainly better TV series.  On average, they cast actors for a start, as opposed to wannabe catalog models with shaky performance skills at best.  People look like people, which is to say there is diversity to their faces, and they have flaws as much as they have beauty -- you know, like real people -- rather than the cookie-cutter thing we get here. The writing is generally superior, as is the directing.  While they may not spend as much to make a show, most programs don't have that plastic quality that so much American TV has today.

""Luther"" is an excellent example.  Idris Elba is the titular character, a hard-edged detective with a good if weary heart who isn't above trampling on the law in order to exact justice.  His fierce temper is both a character failing and the force that propels him after the worst of the worst, thank goodness.  We've seen it before, of course.  Britain's ""The Sweeney"" featured characters in similar straits, and one of my favorites as a teenager, ""The Equalizer,"" set things up with a former spy.  Elba is solid in the lead role -- I scoffed a few months ago when someone suggested him to play James Bond, as I'd never really paid attention.  Now I see what others noticed in him.  But ""Luther"" works best because of its villains.  They are despicable, with all of the greed and cruelty we see on a daily basis but magnified a hundred times.  At times, the show will seem to raid the familiar, such as Silence of the Lambs, but it somehow manages to put a fresh spin on it.  The pacing is likewise brisk and the music, including the ""Luther"" theme, effective.

Shows like ""Luther"" have the sand to tackle real moral issues.  Somehow our shows, with rare exception, seem quite tinny by comparison.  While in some ways it may be just another violent cop show, ""Luther"" is in others a reminder of the moral complexities that should undergird drama and even melodrama.  It's good to see them dealt with with sophistication.",1371686400,7,2086,4.6043360433604335

In addition, each week there are interesting, and complex criminals who John has to track down; most of the criminals he hunts are serial killers who are on the prowl and John has to try to stop before they strike again...

5774861,5,B00D4QPL1A,"Watching LUTHER, one thought kept coming to mind: If police in the UK were allowed to carry firearms, ninety percent of the killings that take place in this series could have been avoided.

But, that's another subject altogether.

LUTHER is an excellent, gritty cop show; a first-rate thriller that, in some respects, evokes memories of THE SHIELD.  Both series deal with police detectives who work outside of the rules.  The difference is that, with Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) of THE SHIELD, we're dealing with a ""dirty cop,"" whereas in the case of John Luther (Idris Elba), we have a troubled officer who is forced to ""dirty his hands"" in order to get the job done.

During the course of the one-hour series, the detective and his fellow officers deal with a number of very clever and cruel serial killers, and Luther must also contend with his wife (Indira Varma) from whom he is separated.  Additionally, he has a very unusual relationship with Alice (Ruth Morgan), a highly intelligent murderess who has escaped prosecution because there is no viable evidence against her.

That's as specific as I'm going to be about the plot of this series, which was created by Neil Cross.  There are so many tense sequences and delicious surprises in these episodes that to say more would make me a spoiler.

The actors are all superb in their individual roles.  Indeed, Elba recently won a Golden Globe for his performance.

I do, however, have a couple of reservations about some of the series' story arcs; caveats that sometimes strain its believability.

Foremost, there is Luther's violent temper.  When he gets angry, he breaks things, doors, windows and other inanimate objects, both at home and at work.  I don't care how good a detective he is, with that kind of erratic behavior; I question why he is still on the force.

Then, there's his relationship with Alice.  Though Ms. Morgan is very attractive and a fine actress, I find that what the writers have her doing just not plausible.  But, as a viewer, one goes along with it because the rest of the series does keep one on the edge of their seat.

BBC Video has now released two seasons of LUTHER onto DVD.  The first season contains six episodes, the second four.  Each is a two DVD set.

I didn't even know until he was on NPR's Fresh Air that he was a Brit and not a Bawlmore native at all. I watched the whole thing, but I was disappointed in his performance. When he played Stringer in ""The Wire"" he was one of the most menacing characters, not because he was so violent himself but because he just exuded ruthlessness. He knew what he wanted and he went for it, and let no one get in his way. Kind of a highly sophisticated intercontinental ballistic missile. In ""Luther,"" he's more of a bottle rocket. It makes a big mess, but it's really not very scary. Someone on another NPR program interviewed Elba and said that she thought ""Luther"" was so frightening that she couldn't watch the last couple of episodes by herself.

5774869,5,B00D4QPL1A,"Thanks to DVD we are able to enjoy some of the wonderful TV dramas that the non-commercial BBC produces for their audiences in the UK. (Unless you subscribe to the cable BBC America network - which I don't). There's more than ""Masterpiece Theater"" and the BBC seems to have some of the best acting and writing talent in the world.

I came to the series ""Luther"" when I read a brief review of Season 2 of the series. Of course I wanted to start from the beginning (""pilot"" episodes always introduce you to the characters) and that really is the best place to start. While first episode - of the six hour-long ones in Season 1 - moves a bit slower than the others, it provides the important background you need to understand the lead character, DCI (that's ""detective"" in the London police force) John Luther. Throughout the series there are crimes to be solved (gruesome murders in most cases) but there is a ""back story"" of Luther's personal life which is what grabs your attention. The show is gritty and - not a spoiler alert - there is lots of blood shown. But the acting brings the show to a higher level.

If there is a weakness here it is that - yes, a small spoiler, but necessary to know before you get hooked - the show was planned as a continuing series so there is a cliffhanger at the end of the last episode that will encourage you to move on to Season 2 (also out on DVD now and where I'm heading next.).

Readers of my reviews know I'm partial to BBC crime shows like ""New Tricks"" - which, while the crimes are just as heinous, is not as dark as ""Luther"" - this one is  engaging too,; just in a different way.

5774873,3,B00D4QPL1A,"Well acted.

People have commented that the characters are cliches, but they are more than that: they are rigidly locked down stereotypes in a pornographic fantasy of outrage. This is that grim and very popular fantasy world in which the police know that X is a serial killer, have known it for ten years -- and X not only beats all the charges against him, but makes a fortune writing best sellers about his own life and selling serial-killer souvenirs in a trendy upscale serial-killer museum he owns.

X is engaged in torture murder even as he sells these grisly souvenirs, and the police, every single one of whom knows X not only killed the earlier victim Y, but is in the process of killing Z, languidly send one person to follow X. X eludes the follower. Far be it from the police, hoping frantically to save the newly-kidnapped Z, to put ten or twenty people on to following X.

Exactly what serial killer in recent history eluded police, who knew who he was and where he worked, for ten years while he was writing best sellers about his own life and making a fortune off them? Does that character sound just the least bit implausible to you?

----- -----

Yet another double murderer, of her own parents this time, is found out by Luther because he yawns in front of her during interrogation, and she doesn't yawn back. This proves, says Luther, that she lacks empathy. Her lacking empathy, in turn, proves she's a narcissist, and THAT proves she's the killer. Luther's boss says that's not sufficient proof (the understatement of the year), and the police DO NOTHING in spite of the fact that they have somewhat better reasons for suspicion, namely that the suspected killer was the only person sitting in the same house with the two victims when the police arrived.

Police refusal to do anything whatever till proof is obtained (but how can they obtain proof if they do nothing till proof is obtained?) leaves it all up to Luther, whom they tell to do nothing. Now the formula reaches full perfection: because he is told not to act against any suspect, every action Luther takes to catch any suspect makes him a loose cannon. If it weren't for Luther, the police could do their real job: sitting around waiting for someone outside the police force to catch criminals.

If you are outraged that the police do nothing to catch murderers, you are the perfect audience for this utter nonsense. If, on the other hand, you think that police catch murderers rather routinely, and frequently enough cut corners in order to do so, then you have to watch THE WIRE or some other far more realistic series.

Did I mention the shows were deliberately filled with gore, torture, and sickening violence? But you knew that already and you did nothing to stop it! I better get Luther on the case; if I tell him not to do anything about it -- he'll do something about it!",1317513600,5,2865,4.603921568627451
5774874,5,B00D4QPL1A,"LUTHER is a surprise treat. The big disappointment is that there are only 6 episodes in Series One and they are powerful. Idris Elba was the perfect choice for the role of John Luther, and emotionally torn and conflicted police detective. He's out to get the bad guys but morality will never get in the way of him saving innocent lives.
There is nothing too exceptional about the first episode but everything that happens is the set up for the rest of the series. Layers build upon layers, each piece, each character is part of a large puzzle. It all falls into place in episode 5 when Luther is confronted with his biggest life-changing event. The writer has created a fine mix of main and back stories that all rely on each other.

Luther is back on the force after a leave of absence for psychological stress and some questionable activities regarding a dangerous criminal. Luther's marriage is destroyed and his wife has found a new love. These conflicts resound throughout Series One. A fourth person enters in the form of psychopath Alice, played the remarkably beautiful and talented Ruth Wilson. Luther knows she is guilty of murder but can't prove it. They form a most unusual relationship that touches on contempt, respect and a weird sexual attraction. Wilson plays her role remarkably well.,,a beautiful yet unstable killer who hold all the cards in her hands. In the end, Alice may be the only person that can save Luther.

Supposedly good cops can go wildly bad and start a chain reaction that jeaopardizes lives and careers. A truly good cop can break rules to save a friend being set up. Decisions and choices have to be made. The series ends with a tantalizing cliff hanger and a long wait for Series 2.",1316390400,2,1720,4.69205298013245

The only reason I give this 2 stars instead of 1 is because Idris Elba brings the wonderful intensity and intelligence he had in The Wire as Stringer Bell to this character. However, this series is a barrage of detective cliches that the actor (and the other fine actors) simply cannot elevate. There's the character of Luther, a loose cannon who can be tough and yet is smart and sensitive. Of course there is a scene with police superiors worried about Luther constantly breaking the rules, of course he has an estranged wife with a wimpy boyfriend, of course there's an attractive psychopath who both taunts and tries to seduce him, of course there is a killer who Luther can make break down in tears when confronted with Daddy issues.

5774880,3,B00D4QPL1A,"The Amazon reviewers have been very favorably disposed toward Luther, the Netflix reviewers much less so.  I believe that the series is worthy of attention but that it has some significant flaws.

The concept.  In a special feature on the second disc of the first season's episodes the production team spells out its concept, a concept that is quite muddled.  The hero is to be a mix of the two classic protagonists (the puzzle solver--Holmes, Miss Marple and the loner riddled with angst--Philip Marlowe).  The dyad envisioned is actually the English mystery versus the American hardboiled crime story and the distinction here is vague.  Holmes, after all, is troubled (""Watson, the needle!"") and the hardboiled Spenser is at great peace, in a committed relationship, fondling his girlfriend's dog and sipping Riesling (most recently).  Marlowe himself is a loner, but his most distinctive trait (as Chandler sketches in ""The Simple Art of Murder"") is that he is a man of honor in all things.  John Luther is not really an original character and the fact that he represents an amalgam is not new.  One need look no further than Robbie Coltrane's masterful Fitz in the Cracker series: a psychologist/sleuth with a great ability to understand human behavior and solve crime puzzles who, at the same time, has troubled relationships as well as a significant problem with gambling and drink.

The crew also suggests that Luther is something of a superhero, in that he only wears one set of clothes.  The latter is true (one set of clothes), but Peter Parker, Bruce Wayne, Clark Kent and others have (obviously, I'm afraid) multiple sets of clothes and one superhero uniform.

The situation.  According to the production crew, DCI Luther is caught amid three relationships with women.  Each makes special, different demands on him and he bounces among them like a harried pinball.  The women are conceived archetypally, with archetypal labels: the virgin (a psychopathic killer, played very nicely by Ruth Wilson); the mother (Luther's ex-wife played by Indira Varma) and the crone (Luther's boss, a detective superintendent played by Saskia Reeves).  The team admits that DSU Rose Teller is not really a crone, overlooking the fact that Mrs. Luther is childless and the psychopathic Ms. Morgan's sexual history is actually unspecified.

The more accurate take is that by Ruth Wilson, who plays the psychopath.  She opines that Luther is a reversed Silence of the Lambs, with a male detective turning to a younger, female psychopath for help.  Actually, the more proximate example is the current Chelsea Cain series in which a sadistic psychopath tortures a detective and the two end up developing a haunting, psychologically-intimate relationship.

The setting is London, the palette fairly bland with grays, greens and browns and an occasional splash of red.  This is accurate.  The production values are strong, the look somewhere between `gritty' and `realist'.  The police headquarters is in Southwark.  There is little of Baedeker Britain or theme park London aside from an occasional shot.

The story lines are dark, darker than 95% of British dramas.  For example, one episode concerns the owner of a horror/killer museum store who abducts women, locks them in a small, cramped box, freezes their bodies, drains their blood and uses that blood as ink to write ravings on walls.

The acting is good.  The standout is Ruth Wilson as the psychopath Helen Morgan.  I also have a soft spot for Luther's sidekick DS Ripley, played very nicely by Warren Browne.  Idris Elba is a superb actor, of course, but he seems much more assured (to me) as Stringer Bell in The Wire than as DCI John Luther.  As Luther he relies on several looks and postures and repeats them endlessly.  The ponderous Luther breaks eye contact and rubs his hand over his face, concealing some of its features.  He also contorts his body (revealing his comparable psychological state) in uncomfortable ways.  The performances are disappointing only in that the expectations with regard to this very special actor are so high.

Bottom line: an interesting and engaging series that is not quite as original or high concept as it purports to be, with very dark story lines and solid but not flawless acting.  The episodes involve individual cases, but there is an ongoing exploration of Luther's personal life.  It is essential that the episodes be seen in sequence.  And be warned (SPOILER): the writer is not above killing off a key cast member or revealing horrid flaws in characters we have come to trust.",1311552000,3,4575,5.034574468085107

5774882,5,B00D4QPL1A,"Luther is probably the best BBC series that you've never heard about. The BBC approached novelist Neil Cross to create an iconic cop show and he delivered like gangbusters. John Luther is a genius police detective who matches wits with serial killers. Luther always wins of course. But its his modus operandi that sets this series apart from all the others. To Luther, the righteousness of his mission often supersede everything else. He sees himself as less of a rogue cop and more as a guardian angel or moral authority protecting innocents from evil. Ethical forks in the road abound in this show and Luther often struggles to no avail to honor them. Each episode finds him compromising himself further and further with dire consequences. One gets the impression that you're watching a very good man fall from grace or an angel regress into the very evil he has sworn to fight. There's so much more I could write about this show, but doing so would ruin the surprise. Idris Elba does a phenomenal job as Luther. Charming, menacing, compassionate, cerebral and a paragon of righteousness all at the same time. And Ruth Wilson as Alice Morgan? Perfect! She makes Hannibal Lecter look like an amateur. The entire cast, in fact, is topnotch. You just can't go wrong with Luther, unless of course, you try to match wits with him. Buy this DVD.",1309651200,,1341,4.759656652360515

5774884,5,B00D4QPL1A,"I'd never heard of this series but the cover and start of the blurb on the back looked interesting so I decided to give it a go.  This is easily the best police crime show that's been made in a long time.  Luther (played brilliantly by Idris Elba) is in some ways a similar character in relation to his employers (the police) to that of Dr House on House M.D.  Luther has no respect for the rules and politics that everyone else wants to follow, and isn't even going to try to pretend to follow them.  He is smarter and absolutely brilliant in coming up with the answers to get to the bottom of, flush out or bring to an end various serial killer or other violent criminals.  Like fellow British actor Hugh Laurie's Dr House character, although brilliant at his chosen profession, the Luther character is flawed, especially socially.  Luther's wife Zoe has left him and has in fact shacked up with another man.  He still loves her though and therein lies his achilles heel, which is where the other brilliant character of this series, Alice Morgan comes into play. Alice who Luther knows murdered her family but has done so in a way so he can't prove it, has decided a fun past time is to stalk and match wits with the brilliant detective.  She has displayed to Luther that she can get to Zoe at any time, and other than by killing Alice, there is no other way Luther can prevent her doing so if she wishes.  Which is why he can't do a thing about her little games that often side track him and get him into trouble with his employers including an internal police investigator determined to bring him down.

Besides the battling wits and frustration storyline between Luther and Alice across the episodes there also some serious and violent crimes happening. Each episode is an edge of your seat thriller. Once you've watched one, you just want to keep watching the rest.  At the time this was made it was unknown if this (end of episode six) was how it all ended or if there would be a second season.  Thankfully it has been announced that there will be a second season.",1307836800,2,2071,4.449735449735449

Once I started, I could not stop until I had watched all 6 episodes back-to-back...and I still wanted to see more! I kept thinking, between episodes, that it must have been torturous for those British audiences watching this series on the tele and having to wait an entire week for the next episode to air! I'll keep it simple: Idris Elba (Luther) and Ruth Wilson (Alice) delivered absolutely top notch performances throughout, and you will be thinking about their characters well after the last scene. The same can be said of the entire cast; all memorable performances. My words cannot do this series justice! If you crave excellent British contemporary police drama, it doesn't get any better than this. I can hardly wait to get my hands on the upcoming second season!

5774886,4,B00D4QPL1A,"There are six episodes in Season One. Three women influence John Luther's life. They represent, or symbolize, the three stages of women used in Greek mythology--The virgin, the nurturer, and the wise woman. The interesting part about the series is how he ends up having a weird connection with a murderer, from a former case, a similar kind of relationship that Clarisse had with Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Whereas, in this case, Luther is the investigator, and the physicist, Alice, has this Hannibal-like attitude towards murder. John Luther reluctantly befriends, and later allies, with psychopath, Alice. He understands, and in certain cases sympathizes, with Alice, as to why she does what she does. Regardless to morals, he comes to terms that not everything is black-and-white, and that he is capable of dealing with the darkside, by bending the law to seek justice. He is like Batman, in terms of his character, and his character flaws. It allows him to deal with the dark, unseemly, and often horrific, and chaotic criminal world. Because he knows he is a damaged person, this eables him to cope with its dangerous element, and capable of getting into the criminal mind. Whether he wants to, or not, he is driven to seek justice for the world, and to sustain his moral code. These two motivating factors enable him to to eventally team-up with Alice, for she helps him better understand this darkside of himself (the chaos), and in others, and he needs her in order to allow him to pursue the kind of justice he believes is his purpose in life.

Similar to Batman's Robin, DS Ripley is Luther's 'Robin,' who tries to make sure he doesn't cross over ""into the dark side."" But rather, be allowed only to visit the edge. He is part of Luther's conscience, as well as the three women who circle his life--the virgin, wild Alice, the nurturer, his estranged wife, Zoe, and the wise woman, his boss, DSU Teller.

Like Alice is to Luther, the show both provokes ad compells you to want to see more. To allow it to take you onto a both a predictable and unpredictable journey. It also clearly proclaims itself as something that cannot be totally pigeon-holed, even though it has some element-like ingredients found in Prime Suspect and Columbo.

Why can't American television dramas be this golden? Why do they punish us with tripe like Real Housewives or Law & Order?! It's a travesty.

But I digress; now, back to Luther! Lastly, some people have pointed out the implausibility of the plots  - well yeah...

Most unusual and,  to me, what makes this program so VERY good is the ""Nemeses-type"" character of Alice which is brilliantly played by Ruth Wilson who is really a rather crazy psychopath that Luther is very strongly attracted to although he knows that she is well capable of murder.  They really ""play"" each other very well not hiding that they have the knowledge of what each other is about plus the two actors that play Ruth and Luther are so very good together--the sparks do fly.

This series is indeed ""new"" to me reminding me alot of the series ""Prime Suspect"" because of its intensity.  I am just very glad that I purchased it; I do hope that there are future seasons because I am hopelessly ""hooked"".

Please be advised that Episode five (5) is really really riveting, exciting and heartbreaking with all of the actors giving overwhelming performances especially Steven Mackintosh (of Our Mutual Friend. Better for Girls, etc) who is simply wonderful. What performances.  This episode had me almost on the floor in total awe of its greatness.",1297987200,18,1552,4.911877394636015
5774893,1,B00D4QPL1A,"""Luther"" wastes the talents of Idris Elba in an irritatingly unconvincing plot.  Unable to prove that a suspect (Alice) has murdered her parents, Luther (Elba) allows this unhinged woman to harass him, harass his ex-wife and her new boyfriend, and conspire to have the boyfriend assaulted.  Alice suspects that Luther has allowed a criminal to be seriously injured in a fall and visits the still-in-a-coma criminal who is supposedly under police protection.  Further incredibilities continue as Luther receives not only a video tape of the beating of his ex's boyfriend but uncovers a video that shows Alice paying off the three thugs.  What does Luther do about this?  Absolutely nothing.  He does not report the matters to his superiors nor does he pursue any police procedures against Alice: no restraining orders, no arrests for illegal entry or conspiracy to commit bodily harm, etc., etc.  For a cop who's supposed to be very smart, as regards Alice this cop is just plain dumb.  What's worse is that Alice's repeated reapperarances simply highlight how irritating a character she is.  Yeah, it's fiction, but this fiction strains probability way beyond belief.  It's a waste of time and money.  By the way, the third episode is gratuitously gory.  The gore presumably substitutes for a convincing plot.  A five-trashcan winner.",1296950400,10,1334,5.148837209302326
5774894,5,B00D4QPL1A,"I love British T.V. and this show went way beyond my expectations. Dark, gritty and completely riveting. And that's mostly due to John Luther played by Idris Elba. Elba is one of my favorite actors. I've enjoyed him in The Reaping, RocknRolla, The Losers and even The Office. This show is a definite purchase for me. I look forward to watching them all over again.",1296777600,5,364,4.615384615384615
5774895,5,B00D4QPL1A,"This British crime show is currently rounding the Americans awards circuit. It was surprising to see it right up there with all the American series tv shows on the Golden Globes recently. It deserves this kind of recognition. Idris Elba plays John Luther, a London police detective.  He's excellent at this job but he is also wholly obsessed.  His personal life, as expected, is thus a disaster.  However, his story with his ex-wife is probably the best part of the whole series as the two of them are put into an impossible situation with one of his cases.  It is this story which will linger in your memory.

As typical of a British crime show, there is no cleaning up of how horrible a crime scene or criminal activities are in the real world. It tries to capture the actual grisliness and repulsion that such criminal acts trigger in a normal person. This makes it easier to understand Luther's obsession with stopping a criminal from repeating such activity.  I hope there is a series two of this show as it is outstanding.

5774899,5,B00D4QPL1A,"I had no idea what the BBC's crime drama ""Luther"" was about when I recorded it, but when my friend and I sat down to watch it we were glued to our seats.  Not one word was said between us as we sat utterly mesmerized by the extraordinary Idris Elba, the excellent, hypnotic acting of Ruth Wilson, a smart, sophisticated complex script that generated so much tension (think Alfred Hitchcock) and by far, the nastiest, creepiest, and scariest villains as only the British can write.
This series is so popular that NetFlix has run of out them, and I have been waiting 3 weeks for the DVD's to view the complete series.",1293235200,,615,4.491071428571429

I hope the series continues.  The sixth part ending didn't pan out as hoped so there must be a cliffhanger twist to come.",1293148800,,274,4.313725490196078
5774901,5,B00D4QPL1A,"Episode 1 - 'Luther' starts off with a very powerful beginning to the season when we see just what kind of a man Luther is driven to be. When confronted by a serial killer of children, who hangs precariously from upon high by fingertips, Luther has the chance to save him, but decides to interrogate him some more - before he loses his grip and plummets to the dark depths below; with a thud!

After spending some time in a Psych Unit, Luther is cleared of any wrong doings and is back on the job - the first crime being the death of a daughter's mother, father and dog. Now, this is one to keep an eye on re: the daughter covered in blood, for as it turns out, she becomes Luther's nemesis throughout the ENTIRE season one!

Played by Ruth Wilson, her character of Alice Morgan is an incredibly acted one. Alice is a research scientist and psychopath who killed her parents in a calculated fashion that not even Luther is able to prove - despite knowing she did it. Her core belief, that nothing ultimately matters, comes into direct conflict with Luther's and thus frequently insinuates herself into his business and personal life as a result.

Episode 2 - The episodes begin where each one left off, so now Luther has to stay ahead of a killer who is trained in using sniper weapons and has been murdering police officers. And man, does this episode kick off with an out-of-the-blue opening! Another shock is an explosion that rocks the unit. Luther eventually realizes the shooter's true motivation is tied to his war veteran father; imprisoned for crimes he feels are unjust. By the end of this, Luther is having coffee with Alice!

Episode 3 - A woman lets in a serial killer to her house and soon Luther is against the clock to catch a killer who kidnaps mothers every decade and drains them of their blood for satanic purposes! Of course, like all 'Luther' episodes, we know who the killer is from the start, it's just down to Luther to put all the pieces together in time. Funnily enough, the killer who loves to drink their blood is Paul Rhys (Ivan from 'Being Human' - where he played a Vampire!) A slow burner this one, where Alice helps Luther to, again, try and find the killer.

Episode 4 - Three female victims are found dead on open ground and so Luther has to deal with a deranged man on a murdering spree from the off. Still having personal problems on the side re: his estranged wife, Zoe (Indira Varma) and her new boyfriend, he is aided in his quest to remain a free man when Alice does him a MASSIVE favor! The ending, the REAL ending is incredibly powerful, very unexpected, but truly (sadly) believable.

Episode 5 - A wealthy couple are beaten, the wife taken hostage all for the ransom of some stolen diamonds. But, as always, all is not what it seems re: corruption within the ranks of the thieves, greed within Luther's squad, and his own personal life become fatefully upturned. This is a fast-paced episode so hang on for the ride because, come the end, you'll be hand to mouth in unexpected horror!

Episode 6 - Luther is, as we see it unfold, framed for a murder, but as the police think he did it, he chooses to run from them in an effort to prove his innocence. He plots to take revenge on the rouge cop within his unit, and along with the continual assistance of Alice and Mark (his estranged wife`s new boyfriend, played by Paul McGann), it's time to bring season one to an incredible, powerful, albeit drawn out end. As Luther looks down at the now-dead body of someone he didn`t want dead, someone he wanted to suffer in jail, he utters the words that (will) lead us into season two, ""Now what?"" Now what, indeed.

The Special Feature of a behind-the-scenes `Luther' featurette is very revealing, and well worth the 30 mins, you will invest into it. The actor interviews are staged in a weird manner, but they talk about the show, about themselves, and even Creator Neil Cross reveals secrets about plots and such.

Foot Note: Idris Elba, the star of this critically-acclaimed crime drama, has just been nominated for a Golden Globe Award. He was nominated in the category `Best Performance By An Actor in a Mini-series or Motion Picture Made for Television.' This is a Full Screen Presentation (1.78:1) enhanced for 16x9 TVs and comes with the noted Special Feature of:

5774902,3,B00D4QPL1A,"I'm amazed by the glowing reviews. Sure, the plots are solid, the acting is good, but the topic has just been done to death, surely. Luther is another angsty, ""maverick"" (ie, selfish, thoughtless) detective with little self-control. The intriguing twist is that he has a serial killer just fascinated with him. Why, is anyone's guess, since she's supposed to be so brilliant. I appreciate the effort, but I just don't see it. Sorry.",1292889600,4,432,4.931506849315069

EVERY ACTOR IS SO REAL/THEY MAKE YOU FEEL WHAT THEY PORTRAY ON THE SCREEN. DURING THE 4TH SERIES WHEN LUTHER WAS INTERROGATING LINDA (THE WIFE OF A SERIAL KILLER); WHEN SHE STARTED CRYING/SHOUTING; ""OMG OMG, WHAT DID HE DO WHAT DID HE DO?!!!"" TEARS BEGIN TO FALL FROM MY EYES...THAT'S ARTISTIC ACTING.  THEY EMBODY THEIR CHARACTERS LIKE NO OTHER SERIES I'VE KNOWN. I WATCH IT ALL THE TIME AND I'M ANXIOUSLY WAITING FOR LUTHER 2.

8589621,5,B00D4QPL1A,"Idris Elba has the mojo. He is a charismatic actor who carries you with him and never fails to turn in an outstanding performance. If you think he doesn't, I'd say it's the material that's at fault. Every one of the Luther series is a nail biter and will have you wondering how the criminals could be this bad, we know they are, but how does he best them and keep on breathing. In each episode he is determined to not let them beat him but you as the viewer are never sure. Of course he became a huge star towards the end of the series and there won't be another Luther.......but there may be a feature film if the Hollywood suits have any marbles left.
Great actor and great entertainer. Idris Elba, your star shines bright.",1500681600,,725,4.299270072992701
