3891178,4,B002AS45Y2,"I thought Rest stop and rest stop 2 were both good horror movies. but not great. the first rest stop starts with a young couple going to California to be movie stars. when the girl stops at a rest stop her boyfriend disappears and a mystery truck appears bothering her throughout the movie, along with a crazy traveling family in a van who are religious fanatics.the couple in the winnabago van have crazy twin sons and a son that's a deformed dwarf that keeps taking pictures of people with a 1970's poloroid camera!. I think this crazy religious family is a great add on in the movie. they torment the girl like the guy in the yellow truck do. the second rest stop movie centers on the older brother of the  first boy that was killed trying to look for his brother with his girlfriend and  dorky friend-who has the hots for the girl in the first rest stop. I thought this rest stop was ok too because it told how the origin of the guy in the yellow truck began along with that crazy religious family. all in all I would recommend these two horror flicks especially if you liked the first rest stop!",1300492800,6,1100,4.360975609756098
3891179,2,B002AS45Y2,"Dead Ahead & Don't Look Back.  Yes, it was nice having them both contained in one neat package.  But, saving on shelving space aside, not that great as movies go.  Both were riddled with stupidity and cliches (as advertisements for cell phones; not a good deal, they never work in horror movies).  And I still say, hiking out was the best option since the area the ghosts roam wasn't that expansive.  Instead, the victims stubbornly stayed close to home, one getting drunk in the bargain!
The first movie didn't work because the two main characters were annoying creeps, I was waiting for them to be dispatched as quickly as possible, unfortunately, they didn't go quickly.  Making me suffer.  (If I had to witness one more quick change emotion from that lousy actress I was going to scream!  She was literally all over the place.)  It also didn't help that the music was too loud and just as obnoxious.  Low budget all the way, surprising because of the claim that the writer/executive producer of the TV show Supernatural had control of both films.  Not a good recommendation for the TV show.  (One presumes he did these movies because they allowed him to use nudity.)
Okay, yes, there were a couple of BOO moments that made me jump.  That does not a good horror film make, there's more to it than that.

I will say liked the second film slightly more, mostly because of the new cast.  Everything didn't rest on one person in the second.  As for the motorhome family...character types no one bothered to flesh out.  Tedious, but brief; I couldn't take a whole movie of just them.  Their appearence in both films, while necessary to the plots, was jarring to say the least.  Base comedy tends to detract rather than aid a story; it not only slows things down, it diverts the action causing the movie to stall.
Needless to say, not keepers (didn't mind seeing them, but I wouldn't want to see them again).",1298505600,2,1905,4.616071428571429
3891180,4,B002AS45Y2,"If you love slasher-horror movies these aren't bad flicks. A teen couple runs away from Texas to California. They stop along the way and have sex (nudity plus body double). They are espied by a man in an old pick up truck, the deadly scourge of horror movies. On a back road they stop at a rest stop with filthy restroom. When the woman exits the restroom, her boyfriend and his car are gone. No bars on the cell phone. There are some strange supernatural things going on too as well as a family of religious nuts riding around in a Winnebago type. The driver instructs our lady to ""read the Bible"" then quotes a bunch of stuff about various angels who are NOT mentioned in the Bible. This of course grates on my pet peeve is that the people who always tell others to read the Bible don't do so themselves, because if they did they wouldn't be handing out that advice so freely.

The second movie clears up the supernatural plot points of the first one. More sex and nudity in the second one except the cute blond doesn't need a body double.
Sex, nudity, blood, torture, eyeballs ripped out.

My Walmart had this in the $5.00 bin.",1297036800,,1130,4.376190476190477
3891181,5,B002AS45Y2,"I had seen the first Rest Stop and had no idea that there was a part 2. I enjoyed both of the movies and found that they both was very entertaining.

The seller sent it in a timely fashion. I was pleasantly surprised in the good condition that it was in and for it coming to me so quickly. For the moveie to be used, I was very happy with seller and moveie. I give the movie 5 stars and the seller 5 stars.

I truly recommend this movie and seller.

Thank you,

3891182,1,B002AS45Y2,"...for something completely pointless, aka this double gift-pack.
  every cliche from TEXAS CHAINSAW to WRONG TURN is stuffed into this
  silly excuse for cinema. Wanna pour your money down the sewer, fine;
  they can use the footage as a plot device for the direct-to-video
  follow up. Maybe it's being filmed at the moment, during the 3D-
  IMAX regurgit-- sorry, revival.",1293321600,,375,5.1
3891183,5,B002AS45Y2,"I love horror movies, and these two Rest Stop movies are among my favorites. Just the right amount of gore, shock, action, and story.  Unlike most horror movies I have seen recently, I actually cared about the characters in both movies. The supernatural aspect was the icing on the cake, as person-on-person violence really isn't my thing.  I hope others out there enjoy these two flicks as much as I did.",1287446400,4,405,4.690140845070423

3891185,4,B002AS45Y2,"(****)  Four full stars for ""Rest Stop"" flicks 1 & 2.  Both are great supernatural thrillers, and I think the inter-weaving of the plots of these two flicks is particularly well done.  Watching both in sequence is better than watching just one.  Plot, acting, pacing and sets  are intelligent and well-done, for this kind of film.  And they're scary - yes, these flicks deliver.  Thanks for reading!",1396224000,,399,4.865671641791045
3891186,5,B002AS45Y2,This is a good movie...From the beginning to the end it lets you experience all kinds of emotions...Throuout the entire movie...I cried and kept my eyes covered..,1392508800,,162,5.037037037037037
3891187,5,B002AS45Y2,Both of these are great movies. I am totally creeped out every time I pass a rest stop and refuse to go into one at night!,1375142400,,122,3.730769230769231
3891188,2,B002AS45Y2,"My first reaction to these DVDs is that the story line was very thin--a girl and her boyfriend run away from their homes in Texas and head for Hollywood, but why? The girl seemed to have a decent home life and good parents, from what little was shown of them. On their journey they get on some back road near the California line called the ""Old Highway,"" and they pull into an old rest stop that's grungy and dirty. The girl uses the bathroom, and when she comes out her boyfriend and his car are gone.  The movie then progresses from there to mindless gore and torment. Avoid this trash like the plague, unless you enjoy seeing someone get their body drilled full of holes (yes, literally with a power drill) and having their tongue and eyes cut out. Just too gross to watch! I fast forwarded through the gore just to see how it ended, but that was a disappointment, too.  The girl throws a Molotov cocktail at the psycho in the pick-up truck that was tormenting her and her boyfriend, the truck explodes in a big fire ball, but when the flames die down enough for the girl to look into the truck to view her tormentor, he is gone. That pretty much ends the first episode, unless you view some of the alternate endings (like where the girl finally arrives home via a taxi--how did she find a taxi out on the Old Highway--and the tormentor with his truck restored follows her home).
  The sequel is even worse as the tormentor turns out not to be real, but some kind of spirit that won't die (according to an Indian legend) but yet the pain and wounds he inflicts on others is real.  Too hard to follow as to who is real and who is not. A lot of flashbacks/appearances of past victims makes for a very disjointed story line, and it just doesn't end with any real closure. Was the tormented spirit finally sent to heaven/hell when the eyeballs are burned? Who knows? Who cares? Don't waste your time trying to figure it out.",1362960000,,1923,4.375350140056023

3891190,2,B002AS45Y2,The Rest Stop film series is one of the most pointless and annoying ones too be released in ages. These two films are confusing beyond belief and make no real sense at all. The characters appear to exist only to be tortured and killed. This is really nothing but an attempt by filmmakers with no clue about the horror genre to jump on the torture porn bandwagon.,1342915200,2,362,4.417910447761194
3891191,5,B002AS45Y2,"If your looking for a weird, twisted movie this is it! I would recommend any one that loves horror movies to watch this, I was kinda skeptical to order this movie at first because I have never seen it before or even heard of it. I'm glad I did though because it kept me on the edge of my seat great horror movie. So if you want a movie to keep you on the edge of your seat, your mind going & heart racing I would totally recommend this movie. This movie was awesome I'm very happy with my purchase, great packaging, fast shipping & item was as described.",1336435200,,554,4.091743119266055

3891193,3,B002AS45Y2,"The concept it unoriginal with getting stranded in the middle of nowhere, the dead cellphone, the broken car, the creepy run down hotel/gas station feeling. Some of the kills are interesting and intense, but nothing extremely mind-bogglingly good. Its worth a watch. The second movie clarifies some things that were left ambiguous in the first, but again, not very original. Its entertaining (the first one more-so than the second) but there are many other movies that I would rather rewatch.",1305936000,,492,5.1625

There is a mobile home with a bunch of nuts in it? Why? There are phantom images? Why? An Ageless killer? Why? If we ever found out I missed it and why did Joey Lawrence do this? Shame on you. Predictable what happened to the boyfriend. the heroine? who cares! The second one...war hero comes home for 10 days and has to find his brother (killed in the first one) he takes his girlfriend to find her friend (killed in the first one) and well...blah, blah, blah...who cares. I was looking for some Halloween frights and got nausea instead because it was so....why would anyone care! I can't believe I watched both of these whole things.",1414627200,,802,4.317880794701987
