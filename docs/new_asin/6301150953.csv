322435,5,6301150953,"This is a stunning movie.
We open with a man in his underclothes running, out of breath, through the snow. Behind him is a great, high-walled structure built of heavy stone; as the man approaches the viewer and we can make out his features and his euphoric expression of exhilaration it becomes clear that he has just escaped from some kind of prison.
The man's name is Salem, and he is played by Max Von Sydow, and amazing actor, famous for films ranging from the deeply poetic Bergman drama The Seventh Seal to the paranoiac Phillip K Dick sci-fi thriller Minority Report, and soon to appear in the seventh installment of the Star Wars feature film seriesbut to me he will always be first and foremost the man who played tyrannical galactic despot Ming the Merciless in the 1980 Flash Gordon film. He is an actor of the highest caliber and a joy to watch here.
Also a joy is the visual feast this film offers. Filmed on location in Denmark and Sweden in the early 70s (but in English) the screen is always packed with fascinating relics of North European art, architecture, furniture and landscape, paradoxically spare and dazzling. Most impressive is the great fortress-like asylum from which Salem escapes, a building that essentially becomes a character in its own right as the film proceeds.
 The plot is a delightful hybrid of an Alfred Hitchcock mystery thriller  and one of those old Ibsen or Strindberg dramas that sets out to systematically reveal this darkest secrets of the human soul.
If you like mysteries at all, you really should see this, even though you might be a little annoyed at the quality of the detective work that goes onto me that was the only thing that really detracted from the realism of this film, but there are so many great expressionistic touches here that it really didn't need to be all that realistic in order to be immensely satisfying.",1429401600,,1876,4.699088145896656

Learning too much about the plot, could ruin the viewing experience, so proceed no further if you wish to avoid spoilers.

The story is set in Sweden, where von Sydow plays a man named Salem, who is locked in a cell in an insane asylum, for committing murder.  In an ingenious manner, Salem has figured a way to escape from his cell, and also the ancient castle, which is being used as an asylum.  Running through the snowy countryside, wearing just scraps of clothing, Salem is not intent on escape.  Instead he is executing a diabolical plan, to get revenge against those who framed him for murder.  When a woman is found strangled, the local police inspector (Trevor Howard) finds Salem secure in his cell, and is unaware that the prisoner is preparing for another journey in the snow.

A darkly atmospheric drama, The Night Visitor has a fairly simple story, which is made more engaging by a thoughtful presentation.  Much hinges on Max Von Sydow, and he gives a great performance, in a physically demanding role.  The supporting cast is also very good, and although the resolution isn't completely satisfying, this is a very solid older European style thriller, heavy with atmosphere.

322439,4,6301150953,"This obscure, Poe-esque revenge picture recalls some of the better Hammer horror in its excellent usage of gothic sets (and in this case, stark locations in Sweden and Denmark) and colorful character parts to create a rich and memorable, if minimalist, atmosphere of suspense.  Max von Sydow as the 'innocent' institutionalized murderer and Trevor Howard as the skeptical detective make for formidable, stoical oppononents in a slow-paced (at 106 minutes) but rewarding chess game of wits.  Note, however, that the VCI pressing I received (release date 2008) is a DVD-R, which may not be compatible with all players and is prone more readily to data loss than fully mastered DVDs; and although the package specs indicate a 'letterboxed' presentation (1.85:1 aspect ratio), the print appears to be fullscreen.  Video quality is decent, audio somewhat variable (exacerbated by heavy overdubbing).  Still, a worthwhile chiller in any format.  3 1/2 stars overall.",1345766400,3,960,5.373333333333333

322441,4,6301150953,"To paraphrase Steven H. Scheuer, the man who published TV movie reviews before Leonard Maltin, ""Make a hundred Grade B thrillers, and you're bound to turn out one gem, and this is it"". He wasn't referring to THE NIGHT VISITOR, but he easily could have been. This early 1970s thriller was made for a small independent company called UMC Pictures who also gave us Mel Brooks' THE TWELVE CHAIRS and Dario Argento's THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE. It got good reviews, was directed by Laslo Benedek who did Marlon Brando's motorcycle flick THE WILD ONE, was shot on location in Scandinavia with a mostly Scandinavian cast, and had music by Henry Mancini. Nevertheless it disappeared, along with the company, into movie limbo until VCI, a first class purveyor of public domain titles, released it on video back in 2000 along with other UMC titles. It's out of print now and used copies cost a pretty penny but, if you can stream it or rent it, then it's more than worth your while.

Max von Sydow is accused of a crime he didn't commit and incarcerated in a local asylum for the criminally insane. After 2 years he manages to get out to have his revenge and then get back in again with no one being the wiser. The movie starts off like a Swedish version of COLUMBO as we know from the outset that he commited the crimes that he couldn't have. The brillance of the film lies in seeing how he did it and if the police can figure it all out. The harsh Scandinavian Winter is vividly portrayed and there are several fine performances. In addition to von Sydow, there is Liv Ullmann (at the height of her populatity then), Per Oscarsson, and Trevor Howard as the inspector investigating the case. The film was shot in English so that it could play in England and the U.S. but it is unmistakably Scandinavian in its outlook and execution. The ending, while somewhat implausible, is incredibly effective. Not an all time classic but a good, solid, entertaining B movie that should be better known than it is.",1301788800,4,1999,4.583798882681564

During this time The Emigrants, Scenes from a Marriage, The New Land and other Nordic pictures took center stage above the Night Visitor. Although the aforementioned 3 occupy the absolute elite of all-time Nordic cinema, The Night Visitor is well worth watching and an interesting departure from stereotypical Scandinavian pictures.
The ending of this movie is great. Watch until the end.",1060387200,2,503,5.379746835443038
322443,4,6301150953,"This is an excellent European thriller, with a cast culled from both Scandinavia (Norway, Sweden, Denmark) and England.
Max von Sydow as Salem, the inmate in an asylum for the criminally insane, does a fine job as the lead, (supposedly) unjustly accused and sentenced for a crime he--maybe--didn't commit.  Liv Ullmann (who's Norwegian, not Swedish as some people may think) is just as good as his sister, married to a doctor played by Per Oscarsson.  The two of them, with the help of a greedy lawyer and a conniving sister, managed to have Salem convicted of the murder of an innocent farmhand.  And Trevor Howard plays the investigating inspector who is equally strong--and certain there's more to the case than meets the eye.
Now someone is killing off the people who had Salem committed.  Who could it be?  Salem himself is locked away in the asylum, surely one of the dingiest and most desolate institutions ever shown on film.  But the doctor shows some loopy behavioral tics, so there's a real chance it could be him.
The answer to the mystery is fascinating.  This is not a horror film, as an earlier, extremely well-known and highly regarded reviewer for this venue has said (see below), but a thriller whose details are developed quite well.  However, there are two logic gaps that are somewhat puzzling:
1) Why doesn't the bird make any noise before the climactic scene?
2) What happens to the rope once it's used?  Does it magically reappear under the boat again?
Don't worry, I'm not giving anything away.  You have to see this film to appreciate these questions.  And it's definitely worth seeing.",1007856000,12,1612,4.825454545454545

322502,4,6301150953,"VCI screws up a really nice wide screen blu-ray version of a great film.  The sound lags the video by about half a second.  Actors mouth still move after the voice has stopped.  Sound effects such as door-closing sounds are noticeably lagging as well.  This is a foreign film but all the actors are speaking English and that is their real voices.  The sound problem makes it appear as if the film is badly dubber.  This just about ruins the film.

Outside of VCIs sound/video-synch issues.  Below is my review of the film itself.

If not for anything, its a real joy to watch Liv Ullman playing it evil and exposing the bottom whites of her eyes.

The second pleasure is to see Max Van Sydow playing a very cold, vengeful genius, with a performance not too un-similar to the melancholy knight in the Seventh Seal.

Trevor Howard as a thoughtful, low key police inspector (not too un-similar to his role in The Third Man) is great as usual..

The film opens intriguingly enough, a near freezing man is running across a snowy tundra in his underwear.  The way this is explained as the film progresses is part of the fun so it would be wrong to give away the plot or create spoilers.  Therefor, I will only comment on the quality of the film.

I recall Night Visitor being heavily advertised on TV in the New York area when it entered the theaters around 1971.  At that time, most of us who saw it didn't care for the Night Visitor too much, mostly because of the way it was advertised.  We went in expecting something along the lines of a gory slasher.  And that's not what the film is about.  The shocker-style advertising was very miss leading.

Revisiting the film these many years latter uncovers that The Night Visitor is a damn good, overlooked, well acted, dark moody thiller with a nearly ingenious script, excellent acting, fine cinematography and a very good creepy music score.

Yes, there are a few nasty little murders for sure but they are merely necessary to the story. The killings are neither exploitative, gory or particularly shocking or scary and most take place off screen.

What is really going on here is a clever story of perseverance and vengeance that's almost worthy of Agatha Christi, where the details of the mystery unfolds and the seemingly impossible is made possible.

If you go in expecting a shocking, ax-wielding,  bloody, psycho thriller as VCI's and Amazon's violent artwork promises you will be disappointed.  As a matter of fact - that artwork is part of the problem. The artwork is a spoiler as well as a misrepresentations of the film.

If you view the film as 100 minutes of a dark, suspenseful, well acted, mystery, character study and thriller you should be pleased.

And if you are an Ingmar Bergmann fan, then seeing Bergmann's actor's in an out of character horror/thriller hybrid, well that  is an added bonus and a whole lot of fun to watch. There are really great actors and they do as good a job as if they were working for Bergmann.

I noticed one of the other reviewers mentioned the pathetic police work on hand in the film.  I have to agree, compromising a crime scene seems to be standard operation by the police in this district.  The cops also missed going after an obvious avenue that would have pinned it on the murderer early on.  There is also at least one or two glaring holes in the story as well if your looking, but never mind - the film is still good fun.

The soundtrack,  is by none other then the ultra talented and famous Henry Mancini, composer for  ""The Pink Panther"", Moon River, Days of Wine and Roses etc etc etc. But, in this case Mr Mancini has supplied a theme-less soundtrack. The soundtrack hasn't a touch of humor, or melody that we usually attach to Mancini.  The soundtrack is minimalist, dark, and suspenseful and almost seems ordinary at times from one of the greatest movie composers.  Yet, the music fits the dingy look of the morose countryside and interiors of the homes and asylum.  In any case, you won't leave this one whistling a tune.

Finally - the Amazon streaming version of this film is terrible and that is no way to see the film. Amazon's streamer is soft and grainy to the point of blurry as well as being 1.33:1.  The details in the old homes, the walls and bricks and doorways of the asylum, well worn furniture and snowy frozen landscape, that should add so much to the mood, look pretty gauzy.  The deliberately gloomy cinematography and sets are pretty much ruined by the awful copy of the film.  The sound is just OK.  This was a really let down and not worthy of a very good film.  VCI is not known for doing restoration work or acquiring the best quality prints. In this case the print look almost flawless if a bit too soft but the having the soundtrack out of sink is horrendous.  I hope we may still get a superior version of this film someday.

The film has great actors, story and script, an appropriate dark gloomy atmosphere and it unfolds its mystery in an eye opining compelling way. A good version of this film would be a welcome addition to anyone's collection of top drawer thrillers and mysteries.",1435190400,4,5119,4.5514223194748356

7810507,3,6301150953,"It's Hitchock-on-a-budget in the obscure yet enjoyable oddity ""The Night Visitor."" Swedish director Lszl Benedek's film is nothing if not bizarrely engrossing and entertaining, even as it stumbles from beginning to end to prop up its admittedly thin plot. The indispensable Max Von Sydow plays Salem, a wily and slightly mad inmate gone loose. By day, he is wrongfully imprisoned in an insane asylum (the film's great, understated center set-piece) but by night he haunts those who put him there. The plot carries a few twists and turns that reward those who can play close enough attention, culminating in one of the most laugh-out-loud (in a good way) endings to a horror/thriller movie ever. The film offers little to no scares -- sans Sydow in skivvies -- but is instead a b-thriller that leans heavily on some solid performances and a palpable atmosphere. The recently released Blu-Ray offers little in the special features department (save for a commentary from film-maker/expert Bruce G. Hallenback) but the gorgeous transfer alone is more than worth it. Watching a middle-aged man tromp through the snow in his underwear has never looked so good.",1490572800,2,1154,5.111111111111111
