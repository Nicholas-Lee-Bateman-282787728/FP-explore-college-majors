8216416,5,B000V3USMG,"This video will WORK for you, because it is NOT about ""Kung Foo"", Edged Weapon Tactics, ""Secret"" martial arts, ""Combat"" pistol-craft, or any other macho baloney that you in all probability do NOT have the physical skill set, stamina, experience and/or mind set to successfully prosecute.

Instead of the kind of nonsense that, at best just does not work, and at worst can get you killed, this DVD teaches you HOW TO READ THE WORLD ABOUT YOU so that you can AVOID DANGEROUS SITUATIONS BEFORE THEY BECOME INESCAPABLE.

The gentleman who put this DVD together has experience with criminals of all sorts both inside the joint and out, and will endeavor throughout the video to teach you to read and understand the silent codes, interpersonal interactions, and body movements that street thugs will clearly communicate to you if only you know what to look for.  You will learn places to avoid, how to scope out an ATM or other high risk area before entering it.  You'll learn WHERE criminals are most likely to attack, WHO they are most likely to attack, and WHEN they are most likely to attack.  The author very carefully explains the various types of ""interview"" processes - the kind of interviews you definitely want to FAIL!

Naturally, CCW and being an armed citizen can be an effective personal protection venue when all else fails, but should only be used as a last resort when you or another are being threatened with death or great bodily harm.  To avoid the need for armed action, avoidance is by far the most intelligent and expeditious approach.

If you want to put the odds in your favor, or in the favor of a loved one, when it comes to avoiding muggings, rapes, assaults, and all manner of street thuggery; then buy this DVD.  It will be the best damned investment in personal safety you will ever make!",1296345600,,1813,4.694006309148265
