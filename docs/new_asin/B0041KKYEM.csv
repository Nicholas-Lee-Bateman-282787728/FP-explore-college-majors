4244333,5,B0041KKYEM,"There is nothing mundane or humdrum about ""Black Swan""; whereas, previous Aronofsky films have been about domestic, familial relationships, for instance, that have been shattered into ruins due to drugs, death, or foolhardy choices in life, even what could be considered as ordinarily grounded in ""Black Swan"", say the behind the scenes production of the ballet, its world is still rife with biting cattiness and backstabbing; it really is anything but ordinary. Even removing the progressively deteriorating mental state of Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman), the world of ballet is fodder for subjective subjunctives: I hope, I dream, I wish, etc., which have psychological underpinnings; exactly perfect for twisted, metaphysical endeavours. This extra-ordinariness could be an argument as to why there is a seemingly lack of that inherent raw, primal, naked emotion that is more or less subtle than usual that have governed Aronofsky's previous works: we don't really know who Nina is; we haven't been given enough time to really get to know her. Merely, as opposed to understanding her, we feel for her, we pity her, like a Greek god. Surely because it is by virtue of one of the main themes of the film: fragile mortal being attaining perfection. What comes off is a rather cold, off-putting experience; our heroine is merely a placeholder or a spokesperson, and not a grounded character, for the overly ambitious and dreamers in us. On the other hand, this 'coldness' is neither a part of criticism against the film nor a detriment to it; on the contrary, bitter, sharp, and chilly cold is actually its virtue: corresponding to Nina's fragile existence and crackling psyche, the film is erratic, schizoid, and discomforting; the film's fractured, unreliable point of view brings up Polanski's ""Repulsion"", and Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"", as comparison. In addition, with the operatic, heightened bravura that Aronofsky creates, what we get is an intoxicating blend of the magnificent and the strange: the tragedy is not of a sentimental, emotional kind, but a grand, manic, glorious art that is at times, as you sit there completely enthralled under its spell, horrifying, transcendental, and draining.

So fittingly enough, seeing this film from a point of view that looks at the work as almost an allegory or an abstraction makes it more rewarding. Regardless of how devoid it is with that surprising subtle Aronofsky sentiment that is all at once tender, sweet, and painful, ""Black Swan"" is a passionate, even bombastic, work that doesn't invite you in, it pulls you into it and swallows you whole. Natalie Portman's shockingly commanding, tragic performance, which should definitely garner her a statue or two come awards night, elevates this film into a higher level that could have been camp, sleazy, or ridiculous, but as testament to Aronofsky's talent and vision, comes out very beautiful; a graceful, elegant swirling mess of schizoid, psychotic paranoia that gleefully raises glass to the ever truthful adage: what separates the mediocre from the genius is the latter's willingness to embrace pain, even death. So one could perhaps forgive Aronofsky for not sprinkling ""Black Swan"" with moments to breath; scenes that allow for quiet, introspective, ethereal beauty that he is usually more than capable of. Instead, beauty here is glorious, ostentatious, and in your face, like Nina's delusion, or the showmanship of the art of ballet itself: it is never quiet, it is ceaselessly building up to its grand crescendo.

In other words, ""Black Swan"", in its magnificent, glorious madness, is perfect.",1291766400,2,3609,5.242214532871972
4244334,5,B0041KKYEM,"Darren Aronofsky has been circling movie news sites pretty frequently as of late. He recently signed on to direct the stand-alone sequel to X-Men Origins: Wolverine (appropriately titled The Wolverine). He also developed a rather large and devoted fanbase over the course of directing fantastically surreal films such as Pi, Requiem for a Dream, and The Wrestler, but his psychological thriller Black Swan has also been gaining quite a bit of steam leading up to its December 3rd release. Despite Aronofsky's already well-established reputation and the rather high anticipation for the film, Black Swan still delivers a product that is even better than expected.

Like most ballerinas, Nina (Portman) lives, breathes, and is completely devoted to dance. Artistic director Thomas Leroy (Cassel) is preparing a new spring production of his interpretation of Swan Lake. Nina is next in line to become prima ballerina after the former dancer to hold that spot, Beth Macintyre (Ryder), reluctantly retires. Everything seems to be shifting in that direction until a rather unorthodox, provocative, and unstable (in a dangerous kind of way) dancer named Lily (Kunis) arrives. Lily seems to have an eye for Nina's spot as soon as she walks through the door. Thomas begins to see Nina as the White Swan, which signifies innocence and perfection and Lily as the Black Swan, which is more sensual and deceptive. The problem is that one dancer is required to play both parts. Other than the stiff competition she has to deal with, The Swan Queen role begins to take its toll on Nina who begins to think Lily wants even more than her spot in the production. Nina's obsessive behavior leads to her releasing her dark side that she must now struggle to control.

Aronofsky has always had an exceptional eye for cinematography in his films. His use of micro-photography in The Fountain made the entire film a visually stunning spectacle that will stand the test of time while something like a someone's pupil dilating or a drug deal gone bad in Requiem for a Dream is memorable because of the way and angle Aronofsky shot it rather than relying on its disturbing content to make the scene a classic. Black Swan is no different. Being placed behind Nina whenever she heads to the dance venue gives the viewer a rather unique third person perspective that also gives the impression that you're walking right behind the main character of the film. The intense dream sequences are also shot in a way that flawlessly blur the line between reality and hallucination. Is this really happening or is it all a figment of Nina's deteriorating imagination? Figuring that out is half the film's charm.

The extraordinary main cast is the main ingredient to the film being as great as it is though. The key players all seem to have this twisted side to them that is nearly the exact opposite of the way they first appear to be, which coincides with the Swan Lake theme. Winona Ryder steals most of the screen time she's given whether she's trashing her dressing room, yelling obscenities in Portman's face, or sitting in a hospital room. Even though Mila Kunis seems to play nothing more than her role in Forgetting Sarah Marshall to the most extreme degree on the surface, it's the edge she's given that results in unpredictability for her character. While Vincent Cassel's performance is strong thanks to his sensual reputation with his dancers and Barbara Hersey is both charming and disturbing as Nina's mother who seems to secretly be trying to live in her daughter's dance shoes after a missed opportunity in her past, it's no surprise to hear that Natalie Portman is the heart of the film. Nina is so consumed with dance that she keeps pushing herself even when her mind and body begin to show her that she's had enough. Her breakdowns are heartbreaking and engaging to watch while her transformation by the end of the film can best be described as a monstrous beauty. It's all thanks to Portman's powerful, phenomenal, tour de force performance.

While some might not be surprised that Aronofsky has created yet another masterpiece, this may be his most solid and well-rounded film to date. Black Swan is a beautiful, disturbing, and captivating work of art that features gorgeous camera work, an excellent and mindbending story, and what is perhaps the performance of Natalie Portman's career. It's hard to argue with Black Swan being the best film of the year.",1291334400,333,4441,4.917333333333334
4244345,1,B0041KKYEM,"For some reason I thought this was a thriller.  Not correct.

4244346,5,B0041KKYEM,"A movie directed by the man who did Mother! and Noah, you're gonna be in for a treat. I'm not into ballet, never fancied myself into understanding this artistic collective of dance, but this movie always caught my attention and Natalie Portman is great whenever the role intrigues her well enough. So I watched it and wouldn't you know, this movie knocked me on my ass with brilliant acting, dynamic characters, horror influenced imagery meshing with thespian, behind-the-scenes styled theatrics, a theme which is equally touching and maddening, and so much more. My favorite portions of the film- asides from stunning horror moments- is watching Natalie Portman's character, whom once sweet, pure, and touched by the controlling nature of her mother, transforms into this psychologically unstable, tainted, and overall overwhelmed individual willing to do whatever it takes to become the swan queen. May that be having to confront her mother, become paranoid of her peers, grow a rather complicated, manipulative relationship with the show's director, understanding why the previous swan queen is going though a mental crisis, and ultimately dealing with her self image, other's perceptions of who she is, and how she's able to deal with that. Cons? None. First hour is completely different from the second, but it's all in setup and catches the viewer off guard with this intense transition filled with flair and bombastic tension which is incredible for its ablitity to remain grounded and consistent with the rest of the film.",1524960000,,1530,5.223577235772358

These are the types of stories penned by muggles who throw away their entire lives on some BS external validation goose chase foisted upon them by society and/or family. Then, one day a bit too late in life, they wake up to an AMAZING epiphany: it wasn't worth it!! Ohh! Such insight! Better make a movie about it to warn everybody! That is, except for those who are way, way ahead of you - eg, the oodles of people who had the basic intelligence to see the fool's errand for what it was in the first place, and so decided to build lives in Montana instead of NYC.

This film is also astoundingly original in the way in which it tells its story. For example, I lost count of how many times I had to sit through this device:

As others have pointed out, this disjointed, cliche'-ridden, over-the-top attempt at an artsy-fartsy psychological thriller falls flat.",1508716800,,1740,4.732673267326732

the plot

Nina Sayers works as a ballerina for an esteemed company in NYC. Since her mother also had a career as a ballerina, in all probability, Nina has been studying ballet all her life. So when the chance to portray the Swan Queen in an eccentric director's new vision of Swan Lake, it must be the ultimate dream come true for Nina. Needless to say, but ballet consumes Nina's entire life, from diet to sleeping habits, to her social life and more. When she auditions, she finds that director Thomas Leroy's vision demands that the role of Odette, the White Swan and Odile, the Black Swan should be played by the same ballerina. Her interpretation of White Dove was perfect, calculated and classic, something that Thomas Leroy has suspected she could do easily; it was her version of Black Swan that had him worried. He wanted something more wild and carefree for Black Swan, and this was something that Nina had trouble with understanding and performing.

There was a new student for the company named Lily. Her style was the opposite of Nina's in that she dances more from the heart where Nina is much more technical. As Thomas nudges Nina to become looser, and get in touch with her darker side to prepare for the role, she begins to notice oddball things. She sees that there are things that aren't really there. For instance her back shoulder blade has some scratches on it that she doesn't remember scratching, despite her bloody index finger. She sees her mother's paintings move, she has conversations and experiences with people who aren't there. Meanwhile, and despite her mother's growing concerns over Nina's mental health, she goes on with her training along with the art of losing herself in the role.

the breakdown

There was surely a lot of hype surrounding this thriller from critics and all the way up to the Oscars, and especially for Natalie Portman. While the film was a letdown for me in many ways, I thought Portman was perfect, stunning and inspiring. In Hollywood, it is the envy for all actors to win the coveted role of a character in which you have to drastically change your appearance for. Ever since Tom Hanks took the lead in the film Philadelphia, where he slimmed down to something like 30 lbs in order to play a sick man with the AIDS virus, Hollywood actors vie for such roles. Think of Charlize Theron in Monster, Will Smith in Ali, Hilary Swank in Million Dollar Baby, even Reese Witherspoon when she dyed her hair for Walk the Line. They're bound to be nominated for an Oscar and chances are that they'll win it too. See? It turns out that Natalie Portman wins the Oscar for best female actress for 2010. She slimmed down and studied the dance for a whole year and gave a tremendous performance. With her malnourished sleek look and her graceful moves, you are forced to believe that she is this character of Nina Sayers. The always-beautiful Mila Kunis who also plays a ballerina, although in really great shape here had obviously not trained as hard as Natalie had done. She is shown dancing, but there are so many cutaways and edits that it was probably more film editor than Kunis that made her look as talented as she appears.

It's hard to go into the things that bothered me without giving too much away here. The psychosis of Nina, which is part hallucinatory and part losing a grip on reality, (which now that I write it sounds like it make be the same psychosis) is shown here through the eyes of Nina the afflicted. This is a valid idea, as it will leave the audience in plot limbo until the end. This is what Black Swan does effectively, although now that it's over I feel almost as confused as I was when watching it. For instance, there is a scene where Lily invites Nina out for a night clubbing in NYC, popping ecstasy, dancing and possibly hooking up with some lucky dudes. Now, granted Nina does take the mind-altering drug that most likely only affected her mental state for the worse, but the sex scene puzzles me to no end. After hours out on the town, Nina brings Lily back to her apartment and the two fool around which leads to some pretty graphic lesbo sex. The next day, Nina goes to talk to Lily about it, but Lily remembers nothing. Lily also mentions that maybe she brought one of the guys they met home. In the sex scene, Lily is seen going down on Nina which then her face turns into Nina's and the two faces are constantly changing coinciding with the rising heights of her delights. Now, if Lily wasn't there, who was there? Tommy? No one? Yet nothing is explained as the well-written movies will do, and there are no apologies either. Was the whole sex scene a symbolic metaphor flying over our heads? If so then this is not psychosis but the director's vision. There are a few other scenes like this that we'll never get the answer to, especially the last one. I fear that there is evidence of symbolism at play here. Take the whole idea of Nina scratching her own shoulder blade throughout the film. My interpretation of this is that Nina is constantly scratching herself so as to not allow the black wings of Odile to grow out of her back, meaning she is trying to stifle her wild dark side and maintain technical perfection in the dance and in life. Is this artistic symbolism from the writers and the director? I don't see any other way around it.

I liked watching the pretty actresses in the film and I liked their performances, but unfortunately they are wrapped up in a disjointed attempt at an artsy-fartsy thriller that ultimately falls flat. I don't think this film should have been nominated for as Oscar, yet I can understand while Portman was. Not only did she alter her appearance by losing all body fat, and building up her leg muscles, but she was flawless in her performance. The film is rated R for a whole bunch of reasons, especially the graphic sex scenes although no nudity was shown. Lots of cussing, violent imagery with gore that's guaranteed to make you turn away. Forget R, this should have an NC-17 rating. Do they still make NC-17? I haven't seen that it a while. Anyway, view Black Swan at your own risk, but I say you can pass this one by.

4244461,5,B0041KKYEM,"Darren Aronofsky's magnus opus. Aronofsky has refined all of his film making knowledge and skill into this thrilling mind bender of a psychological drama. The ballet is hard, but the mindset of the dancer is the real stress inducer. Aronofsky is flexing his directorial prowess here in a magnificent display of psychological horror, drama, romance, and even the thriller genre. He uses long pans following Natalie Portman's character, close-ups, and sweeping shots to dazzle and thrill the spectator.

It is a harrowing tale of perseverance that leads perhaps all the way to insanity. Aronofsky is perhaps asking us how far will we go to achieve perfection? In art? In performance? In happiness? In love? Black Swan is a brilliant metaphor for the pursuit of artistry in a bleak and intense world. The final reveal completely shocked me. I was not expecting it at all. This movie captures so many feelings and ideas, while keeping a tight structure that propels the plot and themes. I am impressed. I think that Darren Aronofsky finally made a real masterpiece of film. Black Swan is a must see movie!

Clint Mansell composed the film's score as he did with Aronofsky's infamous Requiem for a Dream. He too has matured from the wild intensity of his previous sounds to the deeply moving romance and the truly epic swells with dramatic emphasis. There is a passion in the score that breaks through the sadness and the obsession to ignite a fiery finale in a wondrous sonic peak. Mansell's notes are mesmerizing in their dreamy grace.

In part, the genius of Black Swan is the captivating performances. Vincent Cassel is intense, sleazy, loving, passionate, hardcore, and desirable filled with lust all in one character. Mila Kunis is particularly enchanting as a ambitious, lustful, playful, sweet, wild, fun, powerful, and seducing foil. Barbara Hershey is striking and fearsome as Portman's overbearing and overprotective mother. The cast is excellently well chosen and deliver some of the best performances of their respective careers.

Above all, the main actress, Natalie Portman (who deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actress for Black Swan), is even more complex and engaging. She starts out a meek, yet sweet girl with big dreams of being the star ballerina. She must mature into both the good The White Swan who is graceful, elegant, sweet, and good, but also The Black Swan filled with intense passion, elegance, seduction, despair, and love. Portman plays the character of Nina beautifully, passionately, and with a mad dedication to her craft. Much like her character. She is impossible to stop looking at in Black Swan. By the finale, I was staring at her with my jaw open and tears in my eyes. Such a reaction is a rarity when I watch films. Black Swan is darkly radiant.

I hope you love Black Swan as I did in all its resplendent striking aesthetic. The gorgeous make up and fantastical costumes are not the only visual delights that Black Swan have to offer. It's a dark fantasy with twisted beauty (thanks for that one, Kanye). I guarantee you have never seen any other film like Black Swan.",1506556800,9,3108,4.923664122137405

Natalie Portman is one of my favorite actresses and I am glad she won an Oscar, but the movie was disappointing. The movie was interesting, but I will never watch it again. I am familiar with the swan lake story, so I thought this movie was going to be based on that but it is not. The concept is close but it is very loosely based on the actually story.

4244727,5,B0041KKYEM,"Black Swan asks us to consider whether weas striving, individuating, and creative beingsshould be the object or the subject of our own lives.  The implications for going through the deep journey to integrate and heighten both the conscious (White Swan) and unconscious (Black Swan) aspects of ourselves can be devastatingly dangerous if done too quickly.  Without a therapist, supportive family, somatic, or spiritual supportwhen the self is too vulnerable, fragile, stressed from the pressure of competition, and forced to embody a radically new role without adequate psychological preparationNina as heroine suffers psychic fracturing.  Given the chance to dance the two roles, she is suited only for the white.  The black role brings her to the edge of madness and causes her to be possessed by the archetype of the shadow.

A provocative sequence that could be a dream, fantasy, hallucination, magical reality, or altered consciousness opens the film.  Nina as White Swan is seen dancing with compelling force, joining with, enveloped by, then trying to escape, a dark human figure that turns into a caped dark figure who increasingly takes her over.  We are aware from the outset that the movie is about a white, pure, and innocent heroines encounter with the shadow and darkness; whether this dark shadow is within or without her, we still need to discover.  The closing scene shows her moment of shining glory; the dying or wounded heroine Nina is lying off-stage, the excited roars of the opening nights New York City audience are in the background, and surrounded by admiring colleagues; blood is flowing out from the center of her bodyperhaps this is from the solar plexus of individuation, control, and powerand we hear her whisper that she is now perfect.  Ninas body is dying or transcending, as if released, encompassed by light, almost ascending to the heavens.  It is unclear whether her encounter with the shadow has killed her or whether her death is symbolic.

Most of the films female characters live within the restrictive beliefs of body-as-object, whether as authority or victim.  The stage-struck codependent mother Erica is the main authority over Nina and her body.  Erica had wanted her own ballet career, was stopped at an early age by pregnancy (a mistake implied to occur from an encounter with a ballet director resulting in a child), and now lives vicariously through her ballerina daughter.  Erica keeps Nina in thralldom by a mix of passive-aggressive remarks coupled by ultra-protective behavior; she tries to eliminate any rivals who show up (the scene with Lilly at the door is striking), supports Ninas determination to succeed, clips Ninas nails so Nina won't ruin her body through stressful scratching.  Ericas motivation seems success and appearance oriented more than compassionateNinas body should be perfectshe does not seem too concerned that something is terribly wrong with her daughters somatic state.  Nina does not own her own body.

Other female characters are caught up in the tyranny of body-as-object.  Beth MacIntyre, the aging ballerina forced out of stardom by Thomas, only sees herself as a ballet body; losing her role as lead ballerina, she attempts suicide, destroys her bodys core competencies, is crippled, later stabs herself in the face in front of Nina with her nail file as a kind of revengeful self-immolation at the loss of her body.  For Beth, she is nothing without her perfect body but because of her unintegrated destructive side, she is attempting to take back the body in destructive behaviors.

Mirrors as visual effects are ubiquitous throughout Black Swan. Ballets predilection toward perfection of bodily form requires mirrors as part of ballet training.  Mirrors are in Ninas and Ericas home and in the ballet studio, for studying her form, for self-criticism, and personal awareness of the body but not for inner personal awareness of the body as consciousness. Nina hears a mirror shatter when the aging Beth is forced to leave her dressing room and the ballet company.  The mirror is again shattered in the fight with Lilly before the Black Swan part of the ballet, then Nina stabs this intruding other or herself with the shard of mirror as she shouts, This is my time, my time.

The mirror is archetypal; it suggests evidence of narcissism.  It is potentially pathological and frightening.  The mirrors suggest the physical body-as-object that is vulnerable and liable to pathological narcissism.  In a mirror, only the outer, surface appearance of the body can be seen, inviting comparison and evaluation with others who could be even more beautiful, thin, talented, and successful than the one seeking approval and validation in the mirror.  Everyone in the movie is subject to and obsessed by their own success, to opening night, and how they look to others.

Self-injury and eating pathology are critical themes in the film as well as among many females in real life.  The female body is exhorted to achieve perfection and can be vulnerable to self-harm under circumstances of depression, pathology, psychosis, neurosis, and excessive stress.  In the body-as-object paradigm, the one who has or owns the body can do anything she wants with her body since she owns it.  We see multiple scenes of driving the body through inhuman schedules, purging for control or expiation of tension, and inhuman physical positions.  Then, there are biting, cutting, scratching, stabbing, and pulling at the body parts in a voluntary or involuntary way.

Nina meets the Other, the irresistibly erotic Lilly who represents Ninas shadow side.  Hailing from San Francisco, a city with a different archetype than New York Citylooser, flexible, laid back, West Coast-style experiential, let-it-happen, erotic, and free-formLilly bursts on the ballet scene as interloper, competitor, seducer, and mirror so that Nina as lead ballerina can use Lillys example to grasp and embody the elusively sensual, free-spirited, magical, mysterious Black Swan.  As rival and attractor, Lilly gives Nina a harsh opportunity for psychic growth.  If mythologically Nina is like Kore the maiden before she is abducted by Hades into the underworld, Lilly could be the archetypal siren Aphrodite or Persephone or maybe she is Hades in feminine form.  Lilys style is authentic, free, and insinuatingthe epitome of the Black Swans rolecontrasting to Ninas dancing as inhibited, soft, pure and aestheticthe White Swan.  Nina needs Lily as a contender to help her embrace her sexuality, and grasp the new form of perfection demanded by Thomas, which is the perfection of form combined with the unleashed power of letting go.

The movement back and forth between human dancer and swan starts subtly at the beginning of the movie and then intensifies, matching the plot of Swan Lake.  Ninas body is becoming independent of her will.  It is acting on its own in ways that are unpredictable, uncomfortable, and although moving beyond body-as-object, her actual body becomes a malevolent subject as it transforms on its own when Nina dances the Black Swan during opening night.  The Black Swan has possessed her; she goes on stage with a formidable freedom, power, and eroticism.  As if there are no more inhibitions standing in her way, Nina seems satisfied as the Black Swans veins and feathers come up over her hands and arms; black wings cover her; her body is becoming subject.  Her winged state is independent of her originating objectivized body, letting her transcend old limitations and achieve a temporary union of the oppositesthe white of consciousness with the black of the unconsciousto the wild response of the audience and her fellow dancers.  Ninas new Black Swan body-as-subject is electric; she has achieved what seems to be a momentary transcendent function at the heightened experience of the performance; she is now embodying the Black Swan.  Possessed by the shadow archetype, Nina transcends the role, Swan Lake, and herself.  For a short moment she is the star who triumphs.  Nina is integrated with the spirit of the new ballet and almost breaks the spell of the evil magician.

At the films end, has Nina physically died from her self-wound or died to her old persona so that, at least in my optimistic imagination, she may begin again as a more integrated artist after a period of recuperation.  Is her death the price paid for giving ourselves to the archetypal shadow or is it a symbolic death?

Repeated viewing of Black Swan brings out its rich psychological dimensions and makes its original thriller tonality less important.  Seeing it a second and third time, Black Swan feels meaningful, less shocking, and more realistic, like a strange and psychologized version of what I know happens with talented young artists and their parents.  The film blends the stress of societal expectations, the arts at a high level, and the difficulties of dysfunctional family enmeshment with Ninas personal individuational process, her descent, and her truncated journey to integrate her self states.  When Nina descends into psychosis, she activates her hidden Black Swan self.  As it emerges, the Black Swan self embodies all that her unconscious self had wished to become and which may have originally motivated her intuitively to seek out the role from Thomas.  What Nina seeks is not the old version of perfection in which the body is a fine-tuned machine that brilliantly performs what the mind tells it to do.  In our imaginations, we can hope that there is a new kind of integrity and fulfillment for her based upon freedom, integration of her light and dark sides, and authenticity of the passion to escape the body-as-objects imprisonment and experience the body-as-subjects flying free.",1466726400,2,9754,5.141861937935402

4244848,4,B0041KKYEM,"As an amateur dancer (lots of classes in college, for fun with some youthful pretension), I was a bit wary of this film.  I thought it would be full of artistic tropes and be based on repressed sexuality. We've seen the naughty bits in clips or read about them, but I was wondering how interesting it might be as a whole.

My impression was almost entirely positive.  It really is a good film about dancers, with occasional exaggeration, to be sure, because most great dancers don't have to go insane to perform.  Portman is absolutely stunning as an artist pushing herself to the limit, with a crazy stage mom (played to perfection by Barbara Hersey) thrown in.

The plot is that there is a girl, 28 and nearing the end of her productive youth, who gets a shot at stardom.  She is fragile, of absolutely perfect beauty, but stunted somehow, not living so much as slogging through with an overly controlling mother who blew her won career.  Her director, who Vincent Cassel plays with a wonderfully tongue-in-cheek Euro-pretension, is manipulating her so that she can realize her true potential.  Then she has a rival, also a perfectly cast Mila Kunis, who might be angling to steal her fire.  Of course, Portman begins to freak out and reality mixes with (psychotic?) fantasy and the viewer has no idea if she really has sex with Kunis or mutilates the aging has-been, Winona Rider (who is also excellent).  Indeed, you don't know what really happens at the end, which deliciously adds to the tension.

So yeah, this is a really good Hollywood production about art.  It works!  Recommended.  Some of it is over the top, but it is fun and intriguing throughout.",1457654400,2,1661,4.70242214532872

4244850,1,B0041KKYEM,"Let's see... What happened? Oh yeah! Absolutely nothing! That's it, nothing happened, until around the last 20 minutes of the movie. I would have to join the others who said that Natalie Portman didn't do anything that was Oscar-worthy. I literally sat through the first 45 minutes, and it hit me that nothing was going on at that point. It's a shame too because I really like Natalie Portman, but she really was too thin for this movie. She's supposed to be a ballerina, I get it, but she looked sick and sweaty like she wanted to either puke, or pass out most of the movie. What's also unfortunate is that it could have actually been a good movie if they would have explored the whole evil doppelganger aspect, but they relied way too much on showing a woman slowly slipping into psychosis, who fantasizes way too much about girl on girl action, and an ugly, old, perverted dance instructor to bring this movie home. Let me guess... That was supposed to be ""artistic,"" right? I'm sorry, I don't find manipulative men abusing their positions and calling it ""seducing"" to be entertaining in the least. On top of that, they expect you to buy that Nina is just an artist who has become so immersed in her craft that she begins losing it, but from the looks of it she was already losing it from the beginning before she even got the role as the ""Swan Queen"".

Don't get me wrong, it wasn't just that. Mila Kunis' role seemed almost unnecessary too seeing as how despite the initial introductions, she's pretty much M.I.A for the first half of the movie. When she did show up her role was cliche. Of course, the rebel is always the chick with way too much dark eye makeup on. The one who is sexually promiscuous. The one who smokes and does drugs. The one who breaks all of the rules because it makes her look COOL.

Not to mention, I think there was an underlying theme of mother/daughter sexual abuse that a lot of people overlooked. Nina's relationship with her mother was just way too twisted for me. It was just something about that 28-year-old grown woman going along with being treated like a little girl that I found disturbing. Her mother dressing and undressing her. Pretty much everything down to the pink room with the pink stuffed animals was disturbing. I think that clearly there was something incestuous going on there when she was trying to find a way to barricade her door to keep her mother out of her room, and her mother asks her if she's ready for her, and then she proceeds to push the door open wearing lingerie. What about Nina licking the icing from her cake off her mother's fingers? Or her mother about to force her to remove her shirt right before Lily knocks on the door and interrupts them? Perhaps, her mother was molesting her which could have definitely played a role in her psychotic break, especially when her mother calling her ""her sweet girl"" echoing in her head during her psychotic break. If that wasn't enough, they just had to show us her masturbating, and in the middle of her getting it on with herself, her mother is sleeping in a chair just a few feet away from the bed. I also think that the lesbian scene with Lily was actually her mother. We saw that Lily drugged her, and I'm sure she got her home, but I think her mother took advantage of her that night, hence, the distortion of Lily's face while she was going down on her. That's why the room was disheveled the next morning, and her mother was sitting looking almost catatonic on the couch on her way out of the door. I figured out what truly happened based on all those subtle hints. At any rate, her mother was a real wack job. I guess that was the point they used to try to drive the whole ""mental illness"" thing home for the viewers. Her mother was also mentally ill, thus, her illness was hereditary. Maybe? I don't know! What I do know is that her mother's obsession with her daughter was way too weird for me, so I actually Googled opinions on the sexual abuse between mother and daughter in the ""Black Swan"" only to find that I was not the only one who got that vibe, nor came to the same conclusion about her mother.

The shaky camera really started to drive me mad after a while. Wynona Ryder's character was barely in the movie, and what I saw of her performance wasn't even remotely believable. The unnecessary use of the F-bombs added nothing to the story. In fact, the only good thing that I found in this movie was the Black Swan's makeup. I really liked that. Other than that, this movie was a NO go for me. But hey, this only one person's opinion, right?",1457222400,3,4572,4.440476190476191

Brilliant musical score (its seems in every movie) and the acting performances by Portman and Kunis were superb. I thought it could have been longer as it seemed to be missing some scenes between characters and  a bit choppy, which led to holes in the story line. But, you understand the premise of the movie and there is quite a bit of symbolism to digest, which helps.

In the end, the cinematography, music. acting, and great use of symbolism makes this a great film and not surprised with the accolades and nominations. Aronofsky is getting into bigger and films but I wonder if his style is too artistic and dark for most audiences. I hope he expands into others genres and shows them his flexibility.",1445558400,,872,4.686274509803922

4244977,2,B0041KKYEM,"Black Swan has a lot of hype, so I was disappointed. I think the movie director and writers felt the need to go over the top with the sexuality to bring something new because the plot of ""Good girl turns Bad"" was done SO many times before and is such a simple concept.  The main character's masturbation and sexual lesbo fantasy scene was unnecessary and didn't add to the film. If you have to slut it up and go to the extreme, to be cool, edgy or to have style, then what does that say about you? Lol.

The only thing this movie had going for it was some of the dancing, visual effects and twists in certain scenes when you couldn't tell whether she was fantasizing or if it was really happening.

Also I was hoping to see MORE competition between Mila Kunis and Natalie's character. I was expecting Mila to tear it up and demonstrate the Black Swan with Fierceness! That's my inner dancer complaining. There was only a little bit of competition and dance rivalry at the end.

*SPOILER* By the end of the movie, she is bleeding from stab wounds after the highlight of her dance career. All that roller coaster of craziness for NOTHING.",1438214400,2,1136,4.421052631578948
4244978,2,B0041KKYEM,"I don't get the aesthetic allure of ballet. What I can appreciate on a sexual level is watching dainty girls parade around in tights. If Black Swan is a realistic representative of the ballet world, Im not alone in my perversion. Lewd sex is a major theme here. Its a driving force for nearly every major character. Even the relationship between mother and daughter had me anticipating a sex scene between the two.

The problem is that the story is too ambiguous. The diegetic reason for that is because Nina, the dancer it revolves around, tends to hallucinate. She apparently has a major mental disorder, perhaps brought on by said Mommy, whom she still lives with and clings to at the age of twenty-something. Black Swan, a movie that wasn't engaging in the first place, soon loses its way in a barrage of horror-flick clich&eacute;s.

4245011,5,B0041KKYEM,"Black Swan
 I have been a fan of both Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis for a long time, since the two actresses were still teen-agers in fact.  To see them in such a dramatically powerful film is a mixed pleasure. I feel a great sense of appreciation at their maturity as actresses but a certain sadness that they have matured enough to play these complex and tragic characters with such realism.  Portman received for her efforts the Academy Award for Best Actress and Mila Kunis also turned in an outstanding effort.
 The story focuses on the intense pressure that two rival dancers have over the staring role in Swan Lake, perhaps the most famous ballet for most of us. By personality and talent, Nina (Portman) seems like the natural choice for the role of the White Swan and Lily (Kunis) for the same reasons for the role of the Black Swan.
 But as the pressure for a perfect performance mounts, Nina begins to crack.  He performance continues to improve but her mind begins to unravel.  Watching this happen to Portman was very painful for me buy wow did she ever pull it off.  People who enjoy intense drama and acting at the very highest level will enjoy watching Black Swan.
 Director Darren Aronofsky has a well earned reputation for highly emotional, tightly wound dramas.  He directed the horrifying drug tale Requiem for a Dream.  He directs from a screenplay by Mark Heyman and Andres Heinz.
 This R rated film is not for young folks at all.  It has a love scene between Kunis and Portman that leaves little to the imagination.  The language is very rough-more dock side language than that in a dance studio.
 This riveting drama gains a seldom seen five saw blades for intensity and wonderful acting.  It runs for one hour and 43 minutes.  This fine film found favor with the ticket buyers.  On a budget of $13 million it brought home over $329 million at the world wide box office.",1430697600,,1895,4.605970149253731
4245012,5,B0041KKYEM,Such a beautiful movie,1430697600,,22,4.75
4245013,2,B0041KKYEM,"I wanted to see this film ever since I heard about it.  I saw it in the theater.  Maybe my expectations were too high.

Natalie Portman is decent and solid, but her performance isn't the best - by far - in this film.  I thought Mila Kunis - who was so inadequate in Oz the Great and Powerful, was phenomenal.  She was so natural, so sexual, and such a magnificent personality, she outshone Natalie Portman in every scene.  Natalie Portman appeared like a dust mote in comparison.  I hardly noticed her, and I was even bothered that she was there.

There has been some criticism because there was a body double used for the dancing, but the dancing wasn't good.  It wasn't even mediocre..  Natalie Portman and even Mila Kunis went through strenuous training, but their practice isn't reflected in this film.  Their dancing wouldn't have entranced anyone, and it was difficult to believe they worked for a reputable dance company.  I thought an elephant could have accomplished the same, been more delicate, and even more graceful.  This film couldn't convince me that Natalie Portman and even her body double did dancing that anyone would pay to see.

SPOILER AHEAD.  Natalie Portman seeps into madness, but wasn't she mad already?  Putting on the red lipstick to seduce the art director to pick her for the major role in Swan Lake?  She stole the former star's lipstick, played with wild abandon by Winona Ryder/Beth MacIntyre, and then returning it.  Winona Ryder in her few scenes was captivating.  Pure animosity, sore, and disgruntled, and her madness is so self-destructive, it is frightening.

The star is definitely Winona Ryder, whose madness and desperation are frightening.

This film could have been better.

I wanted to like it.  But I didn't.  I actually disliked it.  Natalie Portman has done better work, and I think time will tell how she ranks amongst other Oscar winners.  Even loudmouth Mila Kunis, who can be charismatic in certain roles, upstages her.",1430352000,,1972,4.864457831325301

4245015,2,B0041KKYEM,"This is a film that should have received a NC-17 rating for it's strong sexual content instead of the R rating it some how managed to obtain. While Portman's acting is first rate, the masturbation and oral sex scenes between two women (Natalie and Mila) in particular were very disturbing to view and rather unexpected to my wife and I who are 60+ years of age and have been pretty open minded in the past. In fairness at no time is Portman or Mila ever nude during any of the sexually related scenes, but they are still rather disturbing to view nonetheless. More and more LBGT agenda is creeping into Hollywood movies these days it would seem, which is why my wife and I are seeing or purchasing fewer and fewer new films from them and sticking to the older films instead.",1430006400,2,774,4.457746478873239

4245019,5,B0041KKYEM,"I loved Black Swan! I think Natalie Portman was fantastic in the lead which called for her to act  in a 'dual' role of innocent sheltered Nina whose mother fed, bathed, dressed and managed her life, treating her like a child or doll. She also was the dancer who hungered for the plum role of the Black Swan, which made her  stop at nothing and hurt anyone in her path. The dichotomy of the actual ballet role and the turmoil it caused within Nina were so well-acted. The supporting cast was superb as well. The special techniques, costumes, music, everything, really made this film a hit.

4245028,4,B0041KKYEM,"It is difficult at times to watch Nina Sayers slowly self destruct by her inner demons as she aspires to be the Black Swan. Natalie Portman earned an Academy Award among other accolades for her performance here. She was well rewarded.

Her Nina slowly comes undone by the pressure to be perfect even if it means self-destruction. Barbara Hershey's Erica Sayers is a caring and devoted mother. She is growing worrisome of her daughter's behavior. Instead of being an overbearing stage mother, Erica is supportive but not obsessive. Nina is perfect as the pure white swan but desires to be the black swan instead.

The film displays her inner demons and battles with herself. Mila Kunis plays the alternate while Winona Ryder plays a retiring ballerina. Juilliard's dance alum Marcia Jean Kurtz plays costumer Georgina. The director's parents play ballet patrons but in the features section of the DVD. Guiding Light veteran actress Tina Sloan also plays a patron when Nina meets them at the Gala.

The special features includes behind the scenes; making of; preparation; explanation; and special effects. Despite being a low budget independent film, you wouldn't know it by watching it. Like the director's previous film, ""The Wrestler, this film was done better.

4245045,5,B0041KKYEM,"""Black Swan"" is an edgy, in-your-face mosaic of raw emotions and torment interlaced with a hauntingly beautiful depiction of a woman's determination turned into obsession.  The question the viewer may ask themselves is which woman is it who loses herself in the pursuit of perfection?  Is it Beth- the former prima donna who watched her own career vanish despite her vain attempts to keep that and her delicate life balanced?  Is it Nina- who is young, nave, eager-to-please, yet is yearning for more?  Perhaps it is Nina's mother, Erica, whose only control in her life is by overshadowing her daughter's dreams and attempts to ""fly away""?  Could it be Lily, who is the perfect alter-ego to Nina with the devil-may-care attitude combined with a sensuality that is hard to ignore?  I won't say...

Character analyses aside...  The insider's view of how ballerina's prepare for their lessons was invaluable!  As a former ballet student, I truly appreciated the attention to detail and developed a deeper sense of admiration for those who go the extra mile to become professional dancers.  The light and dark imagery coupled with mirrors and glass at varying speeds made what could have been a very ordinary depiction of conflict turned into a glimpse into the angst and euphoria we experience as we go through life's changes.

4245080,5,B0041KKYEM,"A psychological thriller set in the world of New York City ballet,Black Swan stars Natalie Portman in her Oscar winning role as Nina, a ballet dancer who finds herself locked in a web of competitive intrigue with a new rival at the company.

Its plot revolves around a production of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake ballet. The production requires a ballerina to play both the innocent White Swan and the sensual Black Swan. When artistic director Thomas Leroy decides to replace prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre for the opening production of their new season, Swan Lake, Nina is his first choice. But Nina has competition: a new dancer played by Mila Kunis,Lily impresses Leroy as well. Swan Lake requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan with innocence and grace, and the Black Swan, who represents guile and sensuality. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily is the personification of the Black Swan. When the two compete for the parts, Nina finds a dark side to herself. As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side - a recklessness that threatens to destroy her.

Black Swan's theme picks at our deepest anxieties as it relates to the emotions felt by Nina like injury, disfigurement, loss of a coveted job, loss of identity and even loss of sanity. It shows how she tries to cope up with them and how it even threatens her very own life as if danger lurks in her shadows. Aside from that,it also shows how a person is severely affected by a fear of failure. The film could be maddening to viewers but nevertheless it would be both enriching on how people deal with severe pressure as well as fears and anxieties in life especially when one is tested to the fullest in terms of strength and character. Aside from that,it is a movie that is entertaining as well as we see Portman portrays Nina with passion and confusion of a repressed woman who feels the very emotions of delirium that continually haunts her as well as her strange hallucinations and visions pushes her to the limit. Overall,the film is one of the best not only due to Afronsky's direction and Portman's performance but also to the dark themes that are presented in this film that are not often seen in many movies.",1419552000,2,2275,4.656716417910448

4245117,1,B0041KKYEM,"This is a very deep and well made movie.  Natalie Portman gives a very convincing performance as the main character.  This movie is for an audience that enjoy dark psychological films.  The movie appears to be a good piece of looking at a fragile mind in a high stress role in an art piece (in this case is it ballet).

SPOILER ALERT:
There is more to this movie that meets the eye, however.  Many people who have watched this movie may not catch all of the symbolism than is embedded throughout the film.  This movie is deeper and darker than it even appears to be...and it actually already appears to be quite deep and dark.  In my opinion, the symbolism in this film actually is pointing at the main character being a victim of mind control.  The movie makes it obvious that Portman's character has mental issues which eventually causes her to become the black swan.  There is symbolism throughout the movie that it's not as simple as it would appear but that she has actually been a victim of torture based mind control.  I'm not going to go more into it than that, but if you're interested I suggest that you do some internet research.

As far as the blu-ray, I found the video and audio to be very good.  I didn't watch the extras.

This movie succeeds in doing what the director intended to do with it.  He succeeds in creating a dark psychological film.  But I believe that this type of film can actually cause trauma to the viewer, especially since the viewer doesn't really know what the film is about because of the lack of understanding the symbolism.

To be fair, let me discuss this film's merits. The movie opens, and Natalie is playing an uptight chick who seems crazy. Assisted by skillful screenwriting and cinematography, Ms Portman depicts a birrllian character arc in which she goes from that to a crazy chick who is only somewhat uptight.

Also there is a crazy mother reminiscent of Sissy Spacek in Carrie. She's an annoying character, but Natalie breaks her hand by smashing it in a door. So there's that.

Creepy older dude who plays grab-crotch during rehearsal if you're into non-DILF geezers. Spoiler alert: he's the only guy in the movie who gets any.

If you pay attention to the dialogue as well as the progressively abstract scenes, you see how the whole theme of the ballet meshes perfectly with Natalie Portman character development. If you don't pay close attention you start to lose grip of what's real and what isn't, and that perfectly molded aspect of this movie is what helped it to be nothing short of a masterpiece.
If you wanted to simply see an uninspired movie simply about ballet dancing go waste your time with center stage or something of that caliber.  But if you're open minded to seeing something unique and brilliant you would be doing yourself a disservice in skipping this one. Just read most of the one star reviews for yourself, nearly all of the explanations to why they thought this movie was bad were completely absurd and all missed the whole point of the movie. It would be like someone giving Jurassic park a one star because they hate dinosaurs, it makes no sense.

But, it has resulted in an almost perfect film where Natalie Portman is great and has earned the best actress award in 2011. She is well supported by Mila Kunis, Barbara Hershey, Vincent Cassel and Winona Ryder. The background score of Swan Lake by Tchaikovsky is magical and surreal.",1404000000,,478,4.841463414634147
4245175,4,B0041KKYEM,"Make no mistake, ""Black Swan"" is a difficult film to watch, and leaves you with an uncomfortable feeling in the pit of your stomach and on the nape of your neck long after the credits have rolled.

Twenty-eight year old ballet dancer Nina (Natalie Portman) is desperate to land the part of the Swan Queen in her companys latest production of Swan Lake, but is unsure about how to achieve this goal. According to the sleazy director Thomas Leroy, shes perfect for the role of the white swan, but lacks the assertiveness and sensuality of the black. Nina becomes so consumed with her quest for perfection (which is doomed to fail considering the black swan calls for a sense of *imperfection*) that her mind and body start to throw out clear signals that shes had enough.

And this is essentially what we end up watching: a young womans prolonged mental breakdown as shes torn between the classic Madonna/Whore dichotomies. On the one hand shes a sweet girl who still lives with her mother in a room full of stuffed animals and a ballerina music box, on the other shes being driven into the role of the black swan, a mental space where shes intensely uncomfortable at having her prolonged sexual awakening forced upon her.

To make things more difficult, Nina is acutely aware of how unfavourably she compares to a new dancer within the company, a young woman called Lily (Mila Kunis) who is the embodiment of the spontaneous and sexual black swan. As Lily is clearly after the part herself, Nina is suspicious of her overtures of friendliness. Is she being sincere? Is she trying to gaslight her? You're never quite sure, and although Portman took home the Oscar for her portrayal of the nervy Nina, Kunis deserves some credit in the way she captures the duality of Lily, namely Lily herself, and the Lily that exists in Ninas overwrought mind.

Others more eloquent than I will mention the nuances and symbolism of Nina's mental breakdown, but I *did* notice a lot of interesting things with its colour palette. Obviously Nina is associated strongly with white and pink, whilst Lily (despite her white name) leans heavily toward black. Ninas mother dwells in shades of green, perhaps to denote the envy she holds toward her young, talented, beautiful daughter (its established that she herself used to be a ballerina but had to drop out when she got pregnant). Red lipstick also plays its part, and mirrors are everywhere, exemplifying the theme of doppelgangers and the dual role of the swan.

It's a harrowing, unsettling and at times downright confusing film, focusing on the unfair standards of perfection that are forced on a lot of young women and the impossible lengths they go to in order to live up to them.",1403222400,18,2716,4.770212765957447

The movie is great, it looks professional and well made considering how low was the budget, I mean they even used 7Ds Canons to film some shots, that's how low budget it was.

The cast is excellent, they got great foreign actors, like Vincent Cassel from France, Mila Kunis from Ukraine and Natalie Portman from Israel. It is also great to see Winona Ryder in a movie again, she is such a great actress, a favorite of mine.

4245186,4,B0041KKYEM,"The theme of the double, beloved by Dostoyevsky, Conrad and Nabokov is put to good use, then quadrupled, or more, in this lurid thriller, as a young ballerina descends into madness while taking on the dual role of Odette/ Odile in Swan Lake.

Like Odette, young Nina is held under a spell, not by a dark magician but by her neurotic and overprotective mother, who, as a failure in the ballet world, has put all her hopes into her daughter, perhaps all the while secretly hoping she will fail. Nina is virginal; sexually and emotionally repressed, driven toward attaining technical perfection and always on tip-toe around Mother.

Nina is chosen to dance Swan Lake, as  she is considered perfect for the part of Odette. But to be able to dance Odile, Nina must cut lose, and the Prince [ Vincent Cassel], in the form of a Balanchine type ballet director enters the picture, alternately humiliating her and pushing her buttons. Very cruelly, he has forcibly retired his old Swan, a self destructive but passionate Beth [ Winona Ryder--  pitiless casting, imo] .

No matter, another black swan has appeared on the scene in the form of  wild child Lily [ Mila Kunis] who has the tattooed wings on her back to prove it. From the beginning Nina is threatened by Lily, who may want to do her in and steal her role or perhaps that paranoid notion only exits in Nina's own mind. And maybe the ballet director has understood that Lily's presence will stimulate Nina [ in many ways] to push her own boundaries.

Nina is bright enough to see  can see that if she fails she will end up like her own horribly depressed mother, and if she succeeds her career will be as short as Beth's. In any case, Nina must do away with the virginal, timid white swan and bring out her repressed shadow who is an impassioned fury and very, very angry with Mother. How she does so will drive her into a hallucinatory state and eventually over the edge.

If you can accept the Freudian underpinnings of this tale, sit back and enjoy the visual effects--the scene of Nina actually growing wings as she is dancing the part of the black swan is pretty terrific. Frankly I was never sure if this film was supposed to be about art or sex, but perhaps those, in the filmmakers' minds, are  both functions of the unleashed id and libido.  Portman clearly immersed herself in the role, which seems to have also pushed her limits. The rest of the cast is uniformly fine and Barbara Hershey is a standout as Nina's mother.

When you are finished, and if you would like to see a ballerina of genius interpret the dual swans with consummate artistry and intelligence, I would recommend going to youtube and looking up Ulyana Lopatkina. As Odette, she is everything that is romantic, vulnerable, tender and loving without the slightest hint of repression--and as Odile, no slut, but regal, mature and so self confident that she is almost unattainable; almost but not quite. I promise that performance is the one that will stay with you.",1400716800,4,2992,4.624528301886793

4245190,2,B0041KKYEM,"The best I can say for this movie is that it's incoherent. I will add that it is actively unpleasant.

In some ways the plot was even worse than that of ""Showgirls"", which is one of the truly awful movies of all time. ""Black Swan"" was better-written in some way, better acted, and better filmed... but it was similarly pointless and senseless, albeit with less nudity and more self-injuring.

I tend to have a soft spot for ballet movies, and this one did show some decent dancing. When I was a kid, I wanted to be a ballerina more than anything- I even, voluntarily, practiced daily (which is not the sort of thing I normally did). Alas, I had an unsupportive family; the wrong type of body; no particular sense of rhythm; and extremely bad feet. Still, I look back with admiration at that kid i was, and I do tend to watch all the ballet movies that come out, even the iffy ones.

I wish this had been better. It had a lot of potential. But- when one can't tell the difference between reality and crazy- well, I guess that makes a point, but it also make a movie incoherent.",1399420800,,1076,4.343283582089552

And as for acting? Portman's gamut ran from wide eyed pouting to weeping. And the dance scenes were Portman waving her arms wildly while the screen split to a real dancer's feet.

4245198,4,B0041KKYEM,"To me, Black Swan is similar to an independent film. Such films often take the liberty of jumping outside the box to show viewers something they thought was invisible. Black Swan's plot isn't made of deep character development or the demands of ballet. It takes your psyche along with ""Nina"" on a ride to an unknown destination. How much you take in along the way is up to you. Acting, writing, directing and production were outstanding. Portman, Kunis, Hershey and the rest of the cast were excellent. Cast chemistry was great. Graphic scenes and complex, often disturbing, subject matter make this movie an off-limits choice for kids. Don't watch when you're tired.",1396483200,7,667,4.964285714285714
4245199,3,B0041KKYEM,"I admit it: I watched ""Black Swan"" because dancers seem to be pretty universally unimpressed with it and I was kind of hoping that everyone was, you know, just in a bad mood when they watched it or something.  I wasn't expecting Ballet Nerd Heaven, here -- just possibly something a little more satisfying than the reviews suggest.

Unfortunately, even given that my expectations weren't great, I was still disappointed.  The basic story that the movie is trying to tell could have been interesting, if a bit formulaic -- but from early on the movie just seems to be missing its cues.  Instead of moving tautly towards a thrilling finale, weak characterizations and a poorly-focused narrative detract from some good efforts on the part of the actors.  I suspect that the central plot device is supposed to be the question of whether or not the main character, Nina, is actually persecuted by everyone around her or just nuts.  The problem is, that's not a very compelling question when the characterization and storytelling are so weak that you, the viewer, don't actually care either way.

I suspect that this movie suffers from not quite knowing whether it wants to be a gore-driven horror flick or a psychological thriller.  There's not enough gore for it to work as the former, and the plot is too flat for it to work as the latter.  Likewise, the ballet element could have been incorporated much more effectively -- after all, ""Swan Lake"" stands among the greatest of the classical ""story ballets,"" and its theme of tragic betrayal could have been harnessed in the service of the plot.  I think an attempt was made in that direction, but that attempt really got lost along the way.

There were a few cool visual effects (feathers bursting from Nina's skin, in particular) and also a few that fell flat (oh, that awful scene where Nina's knees fold backwards to suggest the legs of a swan as she watches herself in the mirror -- that could have been cool, but the CG is terrible and anyone with a basic knowledge of anatomy will find it deeply un-compelling).

Likewise, there were snippets of enjoyable ballet, and while we only get to see close-ups of Nina dancing from the waist up (presumably because Natalie Portman doesn't dance on pointe), Ms. Portman does a pretty good job actually looking like a dancer -- but for the most part, the ballet scenes function as window dressing to remind us that this movie, you know, takes place in a ballet company.  While efforts were made, at times, to use rehearsal scenes to build tension between characters, more often than not those efforts fall flat.

That doesn't mean this is a terrible movie.  I'm not going to add it to my list of movies that I must see again, but I'm also not going to add it to my list of movies that I will never watch again on pain of death, and we even made it all the way through this one.  I won't die if I have to watch it again sometime, but I also won't go out of my way to do so.

There are much worse movies than Black Swan.  The thing is, there are also much better movies -- much better ways to spend $3 and a couple of hours.

Overall, I'd say that this movie can be summed up in the word ""Meh"" -- and that, given the actors on hand and the presence of a compelling pillar of classical ballet, it could have been a lot better.",1396396800,,3315,4.504173622704507

Her primary nemesis--besides, perhaps, herself?--is Lily, a rival fellow dancer and eerie younger lookalike well-played by Mila Kunis.

I really tried to like BLACK SWAN. Its whole plot and set-up is something nicely different, and it at least begins to allow us some empathy with a victim of SIB, raising (however briefly) interesting questions regarding victim-victimizer relationships. The whole premise of how ballet imitates life and vice versa and how all the major players here are also dancers in life's suite has a lot of potential; unfortunately, it just doesn't play out as well as it could and probably won't mean that much to the average viewer. This film constantly tries for scary and suspenseful, but the effect is just silly.

This might have worked better as a more conventional drama (keeping the symbolic roles) about the cutthroat competition and jealousies that take place between dancers who try to sabotage each others' performances. It also would have helped immensely if the symphonic soundtrack had been saved for the dance performances and not pervaded the bar scenes, Nina's apartment, and everywhere else.",1393113600,,1412,5.502304147465438

As Nina, she starts out timid and fragile - a good girl but as the pressures of being the Swan Queen and mommy's good girl get to her, she starts to lose her grip on reality.  Or does she?  That is the question isn't it.  Was everything all a fantasy to help her get into the role of a lifetime, to ""lose"" herself as the director kept drilling into her head?  And was that last, shocking scene real or not???? I love/hate movies that do this to me, make me question and ponder ... and then ponder some more, much like Inception and Memento.

I thought I was prepared to be shocked but I was still left speechless.  I love that the whole movie arc was actually Swan Lake retold in a modern, surreal sense that breathed life into the classic story, as well as made me see ballet and ballet dancers in a whole new way.

4245280,2,B0041KKYEM,"Apologies in advance to Aronofsky lovers. But the review that I wrote for Requiem for a Dream could almost be copied and pasted here verbatim and still apply.

Aronofsky hasn't matured at all. He still thinks he's being insightful when he's actually being obvious, devastating when he's being merely affected, horrifying when he's just being loud.

Just a few minutes into this film, he'd already shown his hand enough that I turned to my wife--having read no reviews, no spoilers, and not seen a trailer (she pulled it in our Netflix queue due to her interest in seeing it)--and told her what I suspected was about to play out, down to climax and the final death scene.

And of course I was right. Meaning that Aronofsky spent almost the entire film wasting my time with a series of wholly unnecessary and unneded magical realist setpieces that add little to the film and an intense soundtrack that actually drives most of the drama and that--as was the case in Reqiuem--has much the same effect on its own (in this case, famously so) without needing to sit down and watch the film.

In short, cheap tricks, wholly predictable, director thinks he's clever but is actually precious and facile (""I know, what if we did a film in which the dancer actually did become a swan, really did live the plot of the ballet, and actually did kill herself, all as she performed it? Wouldn't that be a trip?""), gives up his ""clever"" move ten minutes in, but then hits you over the head with it like a sledgehammer for the next 90 minutes.

Meh. There are real filmmakers out there that make really hard-hitting stuff. If you're going to allow a film to beat you over the head, you might as well take the punishment in exchange for substance.

Aside, in fairness: Portman is pretty good here. But her performance is limited and obscured by a director that remains deeply in love with himself. Ditto for Libatique's camerawork.",1388534400,7,1911,4.6726190476190474

4245311,5,B0041KKYEM,"Wow.
That is all I can say after watching Black Swan, no matter how many times I watch it. It is the shining example of the perfect film. Darren Aronofsky has always made great films but he really stepped it up for this one. As with the rest of his films, Black Swan deals with how the protagonist's obsessions affect their lives. Natalie Portman gives a flawless performance as a ballerina obsessed with perfection. Throughout the film, her emotions remain completely visible to the audience; she often portrays psychosis, vulnerability, anger, and tragedy at the same time. It is really one of the best performances I have ever witnessed, along the lines of Charlize Theron in ""Monster."" Another striking quality to the movie is the art direction. Black Swan plays out as an art-deco film. All the colors and sets create a completely beautiful experience. The cinematography is also incredible. Almost every shot in the film is a work of art, something that could be captured and sold as a photograph. The music, while normally just the soundtrack from Swan Lake, fits perfectly into the film. Perhaps what makes this film so watchable is the drama. The story is interesting and something is always happening that takes you off guard. Black Swan only won Best Actress at the Academy Awards; it should have won all 5 it was nominated for, even Best Picture. This really was one of the best films I have ever watched and it should be required viewing for anyone interested in film.",1385424000,,1481,4.7890625

This movie taps into that primal power, but yet in a modern and refined way. The story twists and turns through a labyrinth of emotions and perceptions in just the right way to shed some light, yet keep you in the dark. The clash between sane and insane can be felt throughout the movie, which exemplifies the contrast between the two. Overall, I love this movie and would recommend it to anyone who likes psychological thrillers.

4245345,4,B0041KKYEM,"If Neve Campbell's The Company reveals the emotional cost of a lucratic ballet career amidst images of the joy and beauty of dance, then Natalie Portman's Black Swan reveals the psychological toll of daily dedication to grotesque physicality, amidst images of madness, social isolation, body distortion, scratched skin, nail splitting, and bone crunching.

A combination of Portman's dramatic performance, whirlwind cinematography, and choreography force the viewer into the nightmarish self-destruction of a prima ballerina through the guidance of a smothering stage mother, a demanding dance instructor, and a sly doppelganger.

The cinema verite style bonds together within the theme of Swan Lake, one of the world's most recognizable ballets. Several movements from the ballet tease the viewer with increasing dread of the ultimate price of perfection achieved, life itself.",1378080000,2,878,5.7984496124031

4245348,3,B0041KKYEM,"For more than half an hr, the movie seduces us into believing that one will see some kind of supernatural thriller. Then it morphs into some kind of psych noir, and then ends with a dark poetic metaphor. It plays with the conflicts between unconscious and the conscious, repression and human desire to be free, conflict between our angel and our tormented, chained demon and how our realities can hold the valid and invalid in the same vision. The movie gets three stars for its unique technique of telling a story or a superb concept. Missed one or two more stars for not being a wholesome work. Overall acting was OK, especially the main female character was simply awesome. Honestly, she was the only act worth watching, everyone else was simply supporting scaffold in my book. The story itself, albeit strong in concept, weak in execution. The script could have better connections between scenes. Few other characters could have something more to do for a semaless experience for the audience. The ending is tragic but I don't think it had to be that way. Ultimately,the protagonist had to destroy a part of one's self to give birth to another. Why not carry them both the live them equally? For many in the audience, this movie may ring the tone of some kind of dark self-help message. Overall, worth watching. Vincent Cassel played his part, but it was quite peripheral, not a central part in relation to the whole movie.",1377907200,,1427,4.734939759036145

When it was getting close to the end of the movie, i actually thought she was going to die as she was falling? it was powerful. but until i relized they still had it going when she landed i was like damn! that would have been a great ending to the movie. just showing the actress dieing in the air looking up at the stage lights than right to the credits. to me that would have been great.

I thought it was going to be some kind of dramatic thriller like single white female or something. It wasn't. It hinted at trying to be a coming of age or finding yourself (pardon the pun) or stage mother type movie, but failed.  Every time you thought something intriguing was going to happen, it didn't.

4245354,5,B0041KKYEM,"Were I issuing a top ten list for the year's best Films (whatever year it may have been) this would certainly be well up on the list, more than likely at #1 position. The film was beautifully structured by the nature of the ballet, its content, music and setting. The reader has the editorial page introduction to give the story so I won't repeat. I've never seen Portman before. She makes wonderful use of her physical attributes in a first rate performance. ( Yes, I understand that there were ballerinas handling the demanding dancing.) The supporting cast served admirably to complement Portman, who gives every signal of being an acting star of the future.
It does help the viewer if he/she understands that ballet is the most demanding of public physical performances, outstripping any sport by a good deal. As the voice is for an opera singer, a source of constant anxiety, since psycho-physical  conditions may prevent one's continuing at any time, prior to or during the onstage performance,  so, too, the body is for the ballerina.  The film is admirable in communicating the nature of the stress of being as near perfect as possible on stage each time, not just once before the camera, repeating as many times as necessary to get it right (as is the task in making a movie).
Obviously, I commend the movie to any viewer who wants a serious experience; if, you are not in the mood, as I have often been , just put this off until you are ready. It is one of the very good ones.",1376438400,2,1486,4.6

I have a feeling it's innate to her if she lets herself actually have emotions. Otherwise, I was disappointed. The story was kind of dull except for the end which didn't seem like enough to make it worth watching. Probably, if I hadn't heard anything about how great it was beforehand, I would have had low expectations (because of Portman) and actually liked it.",1376438400,,577,4.504761904761905

But the third act, when they're actually putting on the ballet in front of an audience, along with everything that's going on backstage and everything that's going on inside of Nina's head, might possibly be the most beautiful thing I've seen on film in the past decade. It literally took my breath away; as the credits rolled, I suddenly realized that I had stopped breathing. I'm not sure that's ever happened to me before.

I think the inner portrayal of conflict was brilliantly done. It shows the turmoil that can arise from constantly pursuing perfection or reaching that top tier of a profession...which can relate back to many types of careers. In that sense it is a very relateable topic. It was difficult for me to picture Portman younger than she is. Although she certainly doesn't look older by any means, it was hard to see her as more of an adolescent in this movie. Sometimes you would forget this, and then see her in a pink room arguing with her mother, and then dancing the black swan as if shes well beyond her years.

I know real dance, real use of arms, real charisma in ballet  and Miss Portman's efforts were simply dead, uninspired, almost pre-catatonic. If this is because the artists think they are merging an essentially schizophrenic heroine with a dual persona ballet role, they miss the mark on every opportunity.

Remember how Garbo pulled off a great ballerina in ""Grand Hotel""? That is what is missing from this strange, badly choreographed and for me badly filmed effort.",1367884800,2,686,4.896551724137931

4245450,2,B0041KKYEM,"This film makes the most sense if you appreciate it as a sort of ""Showgirls of Ballet"" (""Showgirls"" as in the so bad it's good 90's film). It also makes sense if you think of all the female characters as spiteful drag queens.

So, Natalie Portman does a good performance as a frail ballet dancer, who essentially has no life except for ballet and her overbearing stage mother with zero boundaries. She portrays a character who is on the verge of a breaking point at all times, physically, emotionally, mentally. Yet somehow - she is chosen for the lead in the ""new"" version of Swan Lake. The other dancers in the troupe are spiteful, competitive, undermining(because that's just how women are, right ?). The director of the ballet is a sexually harrassing cad - all the women know this yet it is implied that the other dancers will perform sexual favours to get ahead (again, those crazy women !).

The film portrays all of this in such broad strokes : her bedroom is pink, full of child-like stuffed toys and ballerina artifacts. Her mother gave up an allegedly promising ballet career at the age of 28 (so old !) to have her. Her mother's color in the film is green - green like envy ! And the kitchen has wallpaper with a crawling ivy motif = symbolic ! And the ballet boss cad's office is all black and white - just like his apartment - full of mirrors, art like Rorschach tests, and more black and white. This is the way that we are to understand that he is a MODERN artistic man, who is very BLACK and WHITE in his thinking and behavior - and the film is all about that tortured white swan trying to find her erotic/demonic black swan.

So all the women in this film are treacherous, undermining, spiteful, weak caricatures = this is a very tired way of imagining women's reality/experience. The notion of a lead ballerina being so tortured by her drive to perform/succeed that she is a weak, hallucinating, bulimic wreck is just so messed up. Ballet is incredibly physically taxing, and the people who succeed are driven and VERY STRONG. Try to imagine this film with all of the women's roles played by men, and it will be obvious how misogynist and stupid the plot/writing is. The part where she begins to dance her performance as the black swan, and feathers begin to poke through her skin is just laughable - as though she is growing werewolf like hair at puberty !

The film is artistically shot, but this is undermined by the cliches that hold it down like cement boots.

So wrong about ballet, mental illness, art, drive, female relationships. The ""Mommy Dearest"" of ballet films.",1367625600,3,2593,4.567741935483871

I finally watched this on TV last night and I was impressed! I've never thought of Natalie Portman as a great actress and almost never watch movies featuring her, but this movie changed my mind.

Let my say that I'm a guy who goes to exactly one ballet a year: The Nutcracker. But really, this movie isn't so much about ballet, it's more about aging in an occupation/sport that demands youth, beauty, and extreme thinness, and throws out those who have grown ""old,"" much like other professional sports. I can relate to this as a bicycle racer and runner, but fortunately, in the amateur ranks, we can race by age category into our 60's and even 70's.

The way the character Nina devolves into madness and paranoia was masterful and disturbing at the same time. The part where she peels a large piece of skin off her finger made me cringe. Also the part where the character Beth stabs herself in the face while screaming ""I'm not perfect!""

Finally, watching scenes in the movie only to realize they only happened in Nina's mind worked well. Nina imagining she had stabbed her younger competition and her seeing her body turn black and feathered was brilliant.

I will try to go see the Swan Lake ballet now after seeing this movie!

To be completely honest, I liked Black Swan a WHOLE lot better than True Grit. And i am in no way saying True Grit is a bad movie, its just my opinion. Natalie Portman won the Academy Award for Best Actress for a reason back in 2011. I mean in this film she is just flat out amazing! The supporting cast is great too. To Detail the storyline, there is a lot of ballet involved, but this film is much much deeper than that. There were a FEW moments that i was actually a little freaked out, and once you watch Black Swan you will see why. Some of the scenes I did not see coming. So to sum it Up: Great Storyline, Well-Acted, and the direction/choreography is Excellent. Again I will say My name is Josh i Am a guy, and i think this movie is Wonderful; one that will be added to my dvd collection. 5 stars",1364428800,6,994,3.9502487562189055

Also, let's face it, there were WAY too many heterosexual men for this to be believable as depicting a realistic ballet company.

4245510,4,B0041KKYEM,"Worth seeing because it's a great film, using predominantly real ballet dancers, but most compellingly for Barbara Hershey's performance alone as the mother -- a manipulative, creepy, disenchanted former-dancer. This film is unnerving, compelling and darkly captivating. (The Academy Awards nomination process was undermined (once again) when they completely passed over Hershey for even a Best Supporting Actress nomination, which she also should have won!)  Natalie poured herself into this role, spending a year reviving and toning up her childhood ballet skills, to be a convincing prima ballerina. (The dubbed dancing, to up her own very-impressive game to convincing prima status, is undiscernably woven in.)  The very young dancers from the PA Ballet (who were cast as the fictitious corps de ballet) understood what too large a percentage of the preview audience did not -- that much of what happens is symbolic or imagined, and reflects the fears and altered reality of the main character, who is ascending toward her long-coveted goals while descending into madness.  (The dancers felt compelled to point out that, in their experience, the world of ballet is not nearly so relentlessly competitive and cut-throat as portrayed and that the story could be told of any relentlessly driven perfectionist in so many professions. The same can be said of parents who pour their own ambitions onto their child, to the point of perversion.)

It is not a ballet movie so much as a study of human ambition and mental frailty.  But all things portrayed in the movie may or may not be reality -- it flows so thoroughly back and forth, it can drive a viewer insane to try to make literal sense of it all, so just go with the flow, assume you are viewing everything through the mind of a girl going mad, and be thoroughly carried along.  Mila Kunis is captivating as the fresh competition who, seemingly, has her act together.

I hate to be a spoiler so I won't give away too much as there is already a good description next to the product picture.

The acting is inconsistent and even cheesy at points. But the script is so bad that one can't solely blame the actors. The script is often confusing as it moves from reality to the inner workings of the main character's mind. It is also pretentious in its attempt to be ""deeply psychological"" when it is nothing more that a series of offensive charicatures--the cruel, immoral ballet master, the psychologically fragile ballerina, the over-sexed,drug and drink bad girl, the oppressive stage mother. . . need I go on? The unnecessary use of pornographic sexual references (e.g., masturbation, lesbian sex, hook-up heterosexual sex)as if only sex is at the heart of madness--how many times does the viewer have to see someone's hand reaching for a crotch? And, for a movie about a ballet dancer, why, oh why, couldn't any real dance be shown? Honestly, couldn't a real dancer have been caste for this movie? The only good thing I can say is that the music was fabulous. In many scenes elements of the score of Swan Lake was used masterfully, it's just too bad that the rest of the production didn't rise to that level. In any case, don't waste your time by renting this movie. Oh, and the use of the ""shaky camera"" with multiple-never-ending close-ups nearly drove me into madness.

It is just pseudo-arty nonsense. The basic premise seems to be that masturbation is what turns a good dancer into a great one, and that paranoia about another dancer can make you so unhinged that you cannot distinguish reality from hallucination, even where what is (apparently) happening is as extreme as lesbian oral sex and stabbing yourself with a large piece of broken glass. The sexual content (which is extensive) is just awful and doesn't even have the redeeming feature of being in any way titillating. I watched this film with my wife and she walked out long before the end as a result of a mixture of repulsion, incomprehension, and boredom.

I'm also amazed that its rating is R - I must be out of touch with the rating systems, but there is a sex scene that I would say would be far too explicit for an underage child to watch (and lots of people let their under 17 kids watch R rated movies), so viewers beware, and pre-screen if your kids are going to watch it.

Soon, no one, not even the critics whose quotes adorned the ads, will remember why they liked this film, or want to. It's a pretty dreary, cliche-ridden supposed thriller about naked stage ambition, overflowing with shoddy performances and unimaginatively choreographed dancing (most of which wasn't even performed by the stars, though the studio went to great lengths to pretend that it was and deny credit to the actual dancers).

4245675,2,B0041KKYEM,While I love most of Natalie Portman's films and was excited to see Black Swan I noticed almost immediately that it borrows heavily (at some points practically copies frame by frame) the brilliant Satoshi Kon film Perfect Blue. The only problem is that Perfect Blue didn't need feux erotic drama and pretty ballet scenes to deliver the same message that Black Swan tries to make. It seems that many American filmmakers are taking storylines from Kon as Inception admittedly 'borrowed' the plot of Paprika. Too bad Inception made a better homage than Black Swan does.,1350432000,12,566,4.968421052631579

4245677,2,B0041KKYEM,"I must say this movie was incredibly disappointing. A very bad film. Neurotic Natalie Portman doesn't get an anxiety-filled look off of her face for one minute. She is thoroughly unappealing as a character. Throughout she is a tortured soul--but one who no one could ever care about. Her demonic female rival in the film, Mila Kunis, who is out for ballet blood, is equally unappealing. There is no worthwhile revelation in this film: We all know the unbelievably intense desire it takes to be a successful ballet dancer. This film does nothing to elevate our knowledge. Well then: Is it supposed to be scary? It wasn't. Is it supposed to increase our awareness of the pressures of ""dance?"" It didn't. Was it supposed to show us complex artistic personalities? Forget that. Mission not accomplished. If the purpose was to illustrate that masochism is around in this artistic genre...well maybe. That's about all the various major characters in this film are good for. But even the masochism is poorly portrayed. What I mean is that one sees the pain and just says ""yuck"" as opposed to ""I wish it wasn't happening."" Winona Ryder--whose character was the former ballet lead until she suffers a debilitating accident--was wasted in this movie: She just seemed like a player in a bad ""B"" horror flick. One doesn't care about her either. The male mentor of Ms. Portman, Vincent Cassel, is just an oversexed crude cad. (Why would anyone go to him for advice as Ms. Portman does? Why would any woman find him attractive? And why--one ponders--was he ever hired by a reputable ballet company? Yet he's central. (As he would be in a badly done feature like this one.)  If Barbara Hershey, Portman's mother, had sprouted horns, it would have added some sane symmetry to the putrid movie--as in what should happen in a bad pic of this kind.

Even the dancing was uninspiring in this film, although the dancers do manage to get up on their tippy toes. But we don't see much of that. What we mostly see is people in wheelchairs cutting themselves, female neurotics cat-fighting or bloodily wounded, weirdo hallucinations, and an all-around strain of repulsive creepiness within characters that is hard to take.

Some viewers might say the film was ""interesting"" or ""unusual,"" a ""psycho-thriller."" I say: I can't remember using my fast-forward button so much, and that I just uttered ""good riddance"" when Natalie Portman was lying on her back severely stabbed at the end of the movie.",1350172800,11,2470,4.862232779097387

4245683,5,B0041KKYEM,"My last review, I believe, was The Nines with Ryan Reynolds and Melissa McCarthy. It was a perfect example of the ego Hollywood often indulges themselves in as they think they create a masterpiece, when, in fact, they create the thing I dislike most about Hollywood, besides their incessant awards for themselves, and their complete love of themselves. The Nines was a totally self-involved mess.

I expected the same thing from Black Swan when I settled in to watch what I thought would be another self-loving example of the constant hubris we have to suffer through when we expect something excellent and truly perfect because of the reviews we read not just from other people like us, but those reviewers who actually make a career of opining about movies and often (in my opinion again) get it completely wrong. I decided to sit right down while still reeling from the waves of emotion that rolled around me over and over again throughout this absolutely amazing movie! Yes, I am surprised. THIS is what we expect to experience from the Hollywood community when we take the time, pay our money and expect to become immersed in a tightly wound emotional roller coaster like Black Swan, or something else brilliant because they spend so much money putting these entertainment pieces together for us. This movie is simple in its presentation, but devastating in its production.

Black Swan is the story of one girl's dark journey as she is suddenly given the title role of Odette, the White Swan in the ballet, Swan Lake, along with the role of the White Swan's evil alter ego, Odile, the Black Swan. The young lady who had the part was replaced by our dancer and the underlying reason is that the other girl had simply gone over that imaginary line we know exists in performing in the Entertainment Industry that one becomes simply too old to be visually effective enough to fulfill the expectations of particularly sensitive Hollywood upper management. The part is extremely nuanced and taxing, almost as though the dancer is experiencing a manic-depressive episode. The part would be difficult for a very skilled ballet dancer. For a dancer with great but untested potential, the part could and does create an intense schism.

Natalie Portman is no doubt one of Hollywood's brightest stars. She seems to stay under the radar, living a somewhat normal life, but managing to pick very good roles as she makes her way along the barbs and shards of glass laid own for anybody who tries to make it to the top of the heap in a city full of people who love no one more than themselves. Her portrayal of Nina Sayers, the young girl suddenly thrust into the spotlight in an extremely stressful role, is about as close to perfect as I think I have ever seen in a movie such as this from the Hollywood crowd. She manages to confuse everyone, the director of the play, the other dancers, even the young lady who plays who we think is the antagonist, Lily, portrayed by Mila Kunis who herself is excellent, but almost gets lost next to Ms. Portman's fantastic portrayal of Nina as she sinks lower and lower into her mental crisis of faith in herself to pull this performance off. Most of all, she manages to confuse us, the audience, as we can't help but be pulled into her vortex of self doubt and paranoia as the rehearsals continue up until Nina's first performance as the White/Black Swan. *******SPOILER ALERT********** Read no further if you haven't seen the movie and don't want to know what ensues from this point. I found my own heart pounding as she gets ready for her performance. We see her taunted by Lily, telling her she can't do it, her own mother (played wonderfully by the always amazing and terribly underrated Barbara Hershey) is genuinely terrified in the few scenes we see her in. The drama played out in Nina's dressing room between scenes is nearly as frightening as living through the performance itself.

To say I was blown away by this movie is putting it mildly. As I wished I could have given The Nines a minus 100, I wish I could give Black Swan a plus 100 for making it into my top ten favorite movies of all time. Perhaps it is because I went into it with no expectations that this movie moved me in a way a Hollywood movie hasn't touched me in a very long time. I, too, was terrified for young Nina as she entered the stage and pulled off this performance with camera work so astounding, I felt like I was actually living inside of the ballet WITH Nina.

I rarely find a movie as dark and serious and dramatic as Black Swan anything but a downer and usually try to avoid them. But there was something that drew me to this movie. Due to the fact that our nearest movie theater is 45 minutes away and for one reason or another, I was unable to rent it until this weekend when I added HBO to my line-up simply to watch Game of Thrones, Season Two and Season Five of True Blood (my apologies to Amazon.com - PLEASE do not pull this review because if you had it in your line-up of movies offered to rent, I would have seen it already, but you don't so, this isn't my fault. In fact, it's SO good, if you had it, I would buy it and add it to my growing Video Library collection through you!).

Black Swan, in my opinion, which, of course, is always relative, is a rare gem of pure genius from the realm of the self-loving Hollywood crowd. It is what we go to the movies for - pure, unadulterated, nearly perfect entertainment. Now after reading this, it probably won't live up to someone else's expectations, which is par for the course. But DO watch this movie if you love ballet, enjoy a great psychological thriller, a seriously crazy twist at the end which I sure did not see coming, and some truly amazing performances from some of the best performers Hollywood has to offer. This movie is why I am a movie addict. I can't remember the exact saying, but one has to kiss a lot of frogs to finally find that perfect gem that makes it all worth it.",1348444800,7,5968,4.526413345690454
4245684,5,B0041KKYEM,"Darren Aronofsky's masterful Black Swan is as mind-blowing a movie experience as I've ever had. Natalie Portman is simply amazing as Nina Sayers, a ballet dancer whose sole desire is to be perfect in her craft. Why this makes for such an interesting character study is thanks to bravura acting, brilliant direction, great writing, and a stirring musical score. Black Swan kept me interrested, and then it knocked me off my feet, and never let off. Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, and Barbara Hershey round off the other central characters, and they are all terrific, but it's definitely Portman's film and she most deservingly received an Oscar for her powerhouse work. Black Swan has elements of Drama, Thriller, Horror, and Dark Comedy, and it plays them all perfectly. I believe this to be Aronofsky's best film to date, and Portman's best work on film. I highly recommend this film!",1347148800,,882,4.966216216216216
4245685,5,B0041KKYEM,"You will either love it or hate it!
This movie is very intense (to me). I didn't even realize I had been watching for more than one hour until it was done. There is no breather in the movie. Everything is closely tied together. The protagonist lives in a distorted world, where reality changes and black and white intertwine. I love the change of angle as it imitates the change of her mood. She is uncertain of herself. Her talent surfaces when the uninhibited side of her dominates. The distorted view of the world reminds me of schizophrenic patients. The struggle inside of her is dynamic. It changes rapidly as if she is a rapid cycler.

4245687,1,B0041KKYEM,"My review is not going to compare this movie to other movies'""merits"" simply because in the last 30 years I have only watched around five movies and was always unable to detect merits in any of them. After each time wasted in such a manner, I've always been determined to never watch any movie again. Sadly, I fell for the Hollywood machination of promoting this useless little exercise, but luckily without any expense incurred - I borrowed it from a library.
An Oscar I have finally come to realize is actually a prize that the industry gives itself as a last resort to salvage a movie that is so unusually bad, that it cannot survive commercially without a major effort at a publicity campaign such as an Oscar. It is impossible to enumerate all the bad excesses of this movie and more importantly an actual waste of time equal to that of watching this movie, so I will just list the 2 most important ones:

Nathalie Portman, who in her gushy Oscar speech, called her part ""a gift"", shows minimal acting skills;I got thoroughly tired of her use of 1.5 facial expressions apparently deemed appropriate for this oeuvre(""the tortured one"",and ""the crazed one""). It was also tiring to watch the ballet routines from constantly the same angle: sideways for a group performance, and center, for the ""passionate"" swirling of Nathalie.

The plot is a pure Hollywood ""magic"" recipe, based on their old theory that most of the people are stupid most of the time. Just give the masses what is currently a ""daring"" buzz, such as lesbianism, masturbation, self mutilation, etc., ad nauseum, promote it without letup until a public hysteria is generated, and then laugh all the way to the bank.",1344556800,11,1683,4.760273972602739
4245688,1,B0041KKYEM,"This movie had a lot of chances to get things right, and messed up most of them.

1. The dancer's life.
Nina is a dancer, sort of. She doesn't seem to have any passion for it. Where _A Chorus Line_ or _Billy Elliott_ had you rooting for the poor dancer to make it because of the passion felt for dancing, Nina just seems to show up. She wants to WIN, she wants to get the part, but she doesn't seem to want to dance. So I can't root for her there.
2. The plot of _Swan_Lake_. Uhm. The Black Swan is not the slutty Bizarro world White Swan. The Prince falls for her (Odile) because he thinks she is the sweet Odette. It's a pivotal part of the movie, and it's all wrong.
3. The dialogue. Dear god, I don't know if I've heard anything this stiff and overwrought since _The Brady Bunch_. Marcia Marcia Marcia! I pity the actors that had to say these things.
4. The costumes. Again, obvious and overdone. Nina in pink and white, even wearing a white feather scarf? Really?
5. Basic medicine. Dancing well with glass in your abdomen is unlikely.

OK if you want me to suspend my disbelief and just go for the creepy otherworld feel, you have to give me a character to feel for, and there isn't one.

But I liked the soundtrack. The soundtrack was an excellent blend of classical and modern.",1344211200,12,1285,4.279835390946502

4245690,4,B0041KKYEM,"One reviewer said that this is a movie that needs to be watched several times to really understand it.  I watched this the other night and came away feeling the same way and it was one film that really left an impact on me.  I guess that's what a good movie should do even though this one was very disturbing and really didn't have any happy moments in it.  It was hard to understand how a dancer like Nina could be so impassioned and still be able to perform.  Her personality was almost devoid of any character, kind of lifeless and sort of moving from one scene to the next just willing to move one foot in front of the other.  The world of ballet was portrayed as kind of a highly competitive almost vicious atmosphere.  Take the scene for instance when the prima ballerina, Beth, is denied the lead role and retires from the company.  I didn't realize at the time that Winona Ryder was in that role and I think that she has really matured to take on a part that was so difficult and punishing as we see her all mangled and bruised and bitter.  Barbara Hershey as the domineering mother was especially good in that role and they couldn't have picked a more talented actress for the part--a disgruntled, ""has-been"" dancer whose career was cut short by giving birth to Nina.  Then there is Lily this amoral newcomer on the scene who becomes almost a nemesis to Nina but awakens a passion in her that embodies the Black Swan.  All the scenes of dreams and surreal images are pretty effective and gives the feeling that it's hard to distinguish them from reality, which poor Nina is subject to all throughout the movie.  We witness her self mutilation and just utter helplessness as she tries to perform to the artistic director's demands, her mother's demands, and in the end it's just too much!",1341705600,2,1796,4.478527607361963
4245691,3,B0041KKYEM,"For an idea of what the special features on this disc COULD be, see the Criterion Edition Blu Ray of The Red Shoes. Granted, it is unfair to compare Black Swan's first disc release to a Criterion release of a film with the prestige of The Red Shoes. However, the way Darren Aronofsky tells it, there are hardly any ballet movies worth mentioning, so obviously his Black Swan ranks up there.

The movie is whatever one makes of it. I personally enjoy it. It is no horror film, a thriller I guess. Natalie Portman's performance is quite intense and compelling. There is no question how hard she worked for the role, and that she did all the dancing.

There is also no question that Natalie Portman is not a professional ballet dancer. This is discussed by both Aronofsky and Portman in the interviews that are the special features. Professional ballet is full devotion and the body cannot replicate that in a year. Not discussed, scenes of full body dancing often include Natalie's dance double, Sarah Lane, a star in her own right, currently Soloist at the well-regarded American Ballet Theatre.

The amazing technology, artistry, talent and work that went into this film comes from all areas. Unfortunately, the special features are primarily Aronofsky and Portman talking in front of a camera. They glibly mention that some techniques were used, and the fact that they had to put on a stage production and that involves a whole second crew, and Natalie worked with some awesome people. Not even perfunctory. Obligatory. Can't talk about Natalie learning how to dance without at least mentioning a trainer and coach or two. All together, the disc pretty much only has the promotional materials that were out before the movie: A couple people talking briefly about their work, mostly a lot of Darren Aronofsky and Natalie Portman talking about Darren Aronofsky and Natalie Portman. Oscar Pandering.

DVDs used to have materials like how stunts and special effects were done. Possibly some storyboards and some demonstrations of how the ideas came to life. This Blu Ray is such a sad wasting of available space. They could have shown Natalie fully doing the dancing, and shown a little about how they did the visual effects of combining film of Sarah Lane and Natalie.

In fact, that material existed online at some point but was replaced.

This disc is such a missed opportunity to give credit to all the amazing work put into the movie and teach viewers some of the fascinating techniques used. Instead, it's literally just a repackaging of materials on the movie's website. What is the point?",1339891200,,2593,4.8684807256235825

Everything else has already been said. Shallow, incongruent, over-the-top and unneeded sexual scenes, but I guess the producer had to offer something to give 'adrenaline' to this movie in the absence of acting that was truly a stretch and brilliantly done. There was an opportunity here to make Nina's character a multidimensional and complex woman who was relatable in some way but totally, completely fell short. Although I've enjoyed Natalie Portman's acting in the past, I find it a sad commentary on our society and Hollywood to give this or her, an Academy Award, while not expecting better.

If this were the first movie I saw with Natalie Portman, I would never want to watch another movie with her in it. The one dimensional act - far too boring. It's a good thing I know what she is capable of. I only hope she doesn't slide on this one.",1334534400,8,1010,4.51912568306011

God Damn Aronofsky, how many more people going through self-destruction do we have to see? I haven't seen the Fountain so I can't speak for that but Pi (and his only happy ending) shows someone driving himself crazy, Requiem for a Dream shows a group of people succumbing to drugs, and the Wrestler shows a burned out wrestler commit suicide. Now they're all great stories and all but is that all Darren can do? How about finding a new formula for once, one where a character isn't circling the drain for once?

What does it take to become a black swan? Personally, I don't have a clue since I've never seen a production of Tchaikovsky's ballet ""Swan Lake,"" which director Darren Aronofsky mirrors his movie from. But Natalie Portman does, executing her authority with intense passion and heroic nobility.

Not for the faint of heart, Black Swan takes an inside tour across the stage, proving alluring yet horrifying and at times grotesque.  In comes Natalie Portman as Nina, a ballerina torn between the technical perfections of abstinence, as prevailed by the white swan, and the emotional, sexual dominance that cultivates the black swan's thinking; a duo role that will only be granted to one. Introduce actress Mila Kunis, a dancer who represents not only Portman's professional competition, but the very sexual plurality that Swan Lake requires.

What follows is a confused mix of dreamlike fantasy and puzzle-piece reality. Portman's struggle to become both swans ignites the fear of anyone who's ever dated an artist. Yeah, we're prone to insanity. It's best not to spin your head in circles trying to figure out what actually happens in the end. I suspect that's not the point of the movie. The journey there, however, is.

4245710,4,B0041KKYEM,"The greatness of Black Swan lies in its power to evoke. This review is sort of about all the other reviews. Like a flawed gemstone, what you see depends upon what facet you look at. Reviews that love Black Swan or hate it show the reviewers often going through a process of struggle to come to grips with Black Swan and express their judgments. Director Darren Aronofsky drives a stiletto into your mind with his vast store of cinematic tricks; your reaction may be negative. Deciding what is reality puts your mind in an uproar. Because of the constant close camera work on Natalie Portman, I felt the film was emotionally grueling while visually enthralling. The ending is a head-spinner. How well you can tolerate ambiguity, disturbing images, multiple themes, and so on, will determine whether you like it or not. Overall, I thought Black Swan was a difficult, but compelling experience.

The film rests mainly on the phenomenal artistic control displayed by Natalie Portman. Her gradual slide from White Swan to Black is a tremendous acting achievement. Her physical effort in the role of Nina is reminiscent of Robert DeNiro's ""Raging Bull"". Her performance draws strength from a superb supporting cast headed by Vincent Cassel, Barbara Hershey, Winona Ryder, and Mila Kunis. Others have discussed technical aspects of Black Swan better than I can.

Before I say what I think Black Swan is about, let me say that Black Swan operates on many levels at once. You can say it's art house porn and be correct, and say it is a meditation on the pursuit of perfection and also be correct. Here the film's ambiguity wraps itself around you and starts to squeeze.

 Black Swan is encoded with all sorts of symbols and images (particularly mirrors) you may pick up on. Some are blatantly, crudely obvious, like the winged tattoo on rival Lily's back (Mila Kunis). Others, like the rave scene in the nightclub, are not apparent unless you stop-frame the sequence and see just what is spilling out of Nina's psyche. Things Lily says to Nina are often prophetic.

The opening dance/dream sequence defines Nina's baseline mental state: virginal innocence that flees from sexuality by transforming into a safe, pure White Swan. Compare that sequence with dance director Thomas' (Vincent Cassel) sexually harassing Nina later on to get Nina to express passion in her dancing, and you get a sense that there is a lot of sophisticated overlapping going on between Nina's mental state and the Swan Lake storyline.

When Nina finishes performing the Black Swan coda in the film's finale, we see two enormous winged shadows behind her as she basks in triumph before a wild audience. This suggests maybe she has reached some sort of spiritual equilibrium between her light and dark side while also being totally insane. Other clues are in her name: 'Nina"" means 'little girl' in Spanish, as other reviewers have noted. Also, 'Nina' could be a nod to prima ballerina Nina Ananiashvili, as perfect a ballerina as there ever was. When Nina goes to work, in the film's beginning, she is wrapped in feathery, downy neck warmers. The film is rich with possible clues to completing the Nina puzzle.

Okay, so what is Black Swan really about? It's about a 'chick' desperately trying to break out of her shell so she can flap her wings and leave her mother's nest. Remember, Black Swan is a flawed gem. Turn it another way you will see something else.",1327449600,10,3426,4.8561643835616435
4245711,5,B0041KKYEM,"The beloved ballet ""Swan Lake"" is the most beautiful and compelling of all ballets. But, the film ""Black Swan"" is its destroyer -- a psycho dramatic voyage into the underworld of ballet.

Nina Sayers, a budding ballerina extraordinaire, finds herself in a waking nightmare as she ventures as a maiden into the domain of the black swan. The pressure on Nina is intense. For starters, she dwells in the crucible of the all-consuming world of a New York ballet company.

At home, she fends off the hovering presence of an overbearing mother, a former ballet dancer who never made it out of the corps not even to soloist let alone to principal dancer.  Her dual dominance of her daughter runs hot and cold from loving acceptance to grim disapproval. She wants her daughter to succeed and yet, perhaps not too much.

Nina has no close friends in the ballet company with its cutthroat competiveness. Yet the company is her life force. Bereft, too, of normal sexual release with another, the sole focus of her physical body is as an object of the dance.

It is the presence of Lily, the free spirited newcomer to the company that pushes Nina's buttons, driving her unbearably.  I couldn't help noting Lily as a take-off on Lilith, the dark soul who in Jewish folklore is to have been Adam's first wife before the creation of Eve.

There is a real-life experience of complete mental collapse in the ballet world. It is known that the Russian ballerina Olga Spessivtseva was institutionalized for twenty years in an upper New York state hospital before being released. The ballerina had visited and intensely observed mental patients in preparation for the famed mad scene in the ballet ""Giselle"" and this led to her own bout with insanity.

All in all, there is much that is out of sync in this film.

The role of the prince in the ballet performance is danced by a guy named David (the name itself means beloved) whose emotions run only from A to B.  He doesn't emotionally engage as he ""walks the ballerina"" in performance like a somnambulist. Nina Sayers is too much work for him. He even drops her in performance and later just looks dazed in bewilderment at her fate as the condemned swan.

It's been said that ballet is woman, and yet, ballet is nowhere without a compelling male dancer.  Margot Fonteyn writes in her book ""The Magic Of Dance,"" (I am fortunate to have an autographed copy) that ""Dance is very much an man's activity.""

I cannot imagine what ballet would be in today's world without the foregoing geatness of Rudolf Nureyev, my overall favorite dancer, and the charismatic talent of Mikhail Baryshnikov who made ballet respectable for the male dancer through his role in the ballet film ""The Turning Point.""  Ballet would mean nothing for me today without the gentle excellence of Angel Corella, a principal dancer with American Ballet Theatre.

In October of 1986, a ballet review that I wrote ""The Paris Opera Ballet's Controversial Swan Lake"" appeared in ""The World & I,"" an international magazine of the Washington (DC) Times.  This disturbing version was choreographed by Rudolf Nureyev as a nightmarish dream of the principal male character.  It destroyed the beauty of the eternal vow made in traditional versions to Odette by the prince by never even acknowledging it.

Nureyev, who danced in some performances as the prince and in others as the tutor, did not dance in the one I reviewed, implies that the prince is destroyed by the dark influence of his tutor who becomes his Rothbart.

I did see Rudolf Nureyev dance in a production of ""Romeo and Juliet"" that he choreographed at the Metropolitan Opera on July 18, 1981. As Romeo, his greatness still shone brilliantly. Margot Fonteyn, however was relegated to dancing the role of Juliet's mother, Lady Capulet.

After this performance, I saw Rudolf Nureyev outside the backstage entrance. I handed him an individual packet of a vitamin product that I had been selling. He took it, flashed that famous smile of his at me, and asked me what it was.  I told him, vitamins.  He then graciously autographed my program....one of my most cherished of all the autographs I've collected.

The very best aspect of ""Black Swan"" is its incredible casting.  Natalie Portman embodied Nina Sayers to perfection. She truly earned the Oscar she was awarded for Best Actress.  Benjamin Millepied, principal dancer and choreographer with New York City Ballet, downplayed his charisma in the role of David and yet his smoldering presence came through.  Vincent Cassel blew me away as the artistic director, fascinating me as much as he did Nina Sayers. I was stunned when I learned that he was an actor but not a dancer.  Mila Kunis as Lily was compelling and I enjoyed her role but, other than in appearance, in no way did she resemble an actual ballerina. I can't imagine that a tattoo such as she displayed on her back would be tolerated in a major company and the ballerinas whom I have known were disciplined in the extreme...free spirits inside perhaps...but never, never in public nor on display.

This film is a must for every true lover of ballet, if only for its glimpse into a dancer's world which never can be fully imagined from a pristine seat in the audience.",1326931200,4,5230,4.787541713014461
4245712,1,B0041KKYEM,"Best title of a review of this movie ever is the one that likens it to Showgirls and Stayin' Alive. It's totally what this pathetic sophomoric ""Wow SO deep"" suckfest was.

Aronofsky has always been the kind of director who mistakes thudding unpleasantness and grotesque imagery for depth; usually the people most enthralled with him are male college juniors who fancy themselves as intellectuals and don't realize how pedestrian and boring they truly are. I thought Portman's acting was vastly overrated. She had basically two looks (in between vomiting, but Aronofsky has an absurdly adolescent fascination with vomiting. To him it's de rigueur in all his movies, because nothing says MEANINGFUL and ARTISTIC like an actor pretending to dry heave into a toilet or all over himself): scared anxious rabbit and drowsy ""is it real?"" torpor I expect from a character in an after-school special about the dangers of doing drugs.

4245713,5,B0041KKYEM,"Possible Spoliers

What happens when you work so hard for a part and you finally get it? Well for a ballerina named Nina (Natalie Portman, ""The Professional"") it starts as a great wonderful feeling but jealousy and perhaps some insanity leads to her feeling everyone is out to get her. Once she lands the role in a retelling of Black Swan her director (Vincent Cassel, ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"") seems to take even more of a liking to her, which a former ballerina (Winona Ryder) tries to warn Nina about. Of course a new upstart comes in (Mila Kunis, ""Friends With Benefits"") and Nina's obvious mental grip loosens as she is determined to make this role happen and give her greatest performance.

While this sounds like fairly typical writing in normal circumstances, director Darren Aronofsky (""The Wrestler"") handles it quite well as he presents a true obsession by nina gone horribly wrong as it all seems to be in her head, or is it? It is quite creepy in parts, there is the much talked about scene between Kunis and Portman which doesn't actually take away from the film like some of those type of scenes do.

What I enjoyed about Black Swan was it was fairly relentless in it's portaying of Nina's descent into madness, also showing some aspects of her life that show how it isn't too shocking she was mentally unstable even more so as the movie went along. The performances are great, Cassel does well as the director, Kunis does well also as does Ryder but to me the two standout performances are by Barbara Hershey as Nina's mom and of course by Portman herself as this is a career defining role for her. Its well worth watching and doesn't disappoint. **** out of 4 stars.",1326672000,5,1684,4.6066666666666665

This is a terrific movie. Portman plays a dancer working toward the top of her
profession. She acts very well, earning the award she received. Through clever
photography and some training she is convincing as a professional dancer.
The other performers are fine also.
The fast pace is maintained by the use of short scenes. The score is partially
original and partly Tchaikovsky. The Swan Lake music is expertly adapted and
arranged to match the action on screen.
Portman's character suffers from a self-injuring disease AND a mental problem
that gets worse as the pressure on her increases. By the end of the film she is
hallucinating and or imagining things regularly. I had to watch the film multiple
times to figure out what was real and what wasn't. I like the ambiguity.
The film takes place in New York City. We are not told the ballet company involved
but since they are performing at Lincoln Center I think it must be NYCB or ABT.
There is nothing to offend the average viewer. No nudity or graphic violence.

shocked when the Prince drops the White Swan in Act II in the live performance!

4245716,5,B0041KKYEM,"This psychological thriller is almost a horror film as we see a talented young woman totally fall apart under pressure. The film is brilliant and was able to have me feeling extreme sympathy for an unprepared young woman one minute and then to be jumping out of my seat at her dark hallucinations and then feeling mystified as to how much of what we are seeing is reality and how much is in the mind of our poor deranged young ballerina. Any film that keeps me bouncing back and forth between reality and hallucination for two hours without becoming trite is certainly well made and strategized.

Darren Aronofsky does an exceptional job with this psychological thriller that reminded me of the breakdown experienced by the surgeon played by Jeremy Irons in Dead Ringers. Natalie Portman is beyond exceptional as she plays Nina, a ballerina who has exceptional skills but who has been infantilized for so long by her overbearing mother, played by Barbara Hersey, that she has no survival skills. This is actually a key to understanding the film for a young woman who lives in a completely controlled world of stuffed animals and princess bedspreads is not prepared for the pressures of competition or for stretching herself artistically to achieve expressive goals. It is the ability to play both the White and Black swans that the artistic director, played by Vincent Cassel, is challenging Nina to achieve. Competition, especially from an attractive unorthodox dancer Lily, played by Mila Kunis, is too much for Nina to navigate. As Nina decompensates and becomes increasingly obsessive and compulsive, she has considerable struggles to control the darker side of her nature that she is allowing to emerge to portray the Black Swan. Portman is brilliant as she sways from reality to hallucination and from one dark influence to another.

There is a final reason I was highly impressed with this film. Darren Aronofsky decided to use much of the music from Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake as background music throughout non-ballet scenes. The music is full of suspense and tension and it was brilliant to use so much of the original ballet score throughout the film. Overall , this film gets an A+.",1325548800,3,2191,4.951086956521739

Even so, the director has his doubts regarding her suitability for this role, as the virginal and narrowly-focused perfectionist played by Portman (who even lives with her controlling mother) seems unable to ""loose herself in the role.""  Although she seems perfect for the ""White Swan"" half of the role, she lacks the sensuality and seductive powers of the ""Dark Swan"" that she must also play.  Enter Mila Kunis, who plays the spontaneous and worldly understudy who befriends Portman's sheltered character and eventually acts as kind of muse for the freshly-minted prima ballerina.

As Portman's troubled ballerina struggles to find the artistic voice she needs in order to succeed in this challenging role, she is driven to the brink of insanity.  It is through this painful journey, however, that she is able to open herself to a series of creative epiphanies.

4245720,4,B0041KKYEM,"Does the path of perfection lead to self improvement or self destruction? That is the main theme running through Black Swan, which also deals with themes of sexual repression, pseudo-reality, and the dangers of stardom. Aronofsky seems to have a fascination with the disturbing and the artistic, both of which are great descriptions for what Black Swan is. The basic story is about how the sickly sweet Nina (played quite well by Portman) struggles to release the ""bad girl"" inside her in order to play the titular Black Swan and thus become a star. Things get surreal as the stress takes it's toll on Nina, and it becomes hard to tell what's real and what isn't.

It's an intriguing premise that's backed up with great music, choreography, and acting, along with some truly disturbing moments.

I was expecting more because of the ridiculous hype of this movie. What I have learned is that intense director, Darren Aronofsky, makes little, indie-resembling personal movies and then they get widespread acclaim ( I also thought ""The Wrestler"" was overrated). This was a passable piece of eccentric entertainment yet the premise of the story was not that compelling. The simple premise can almost be adapted into a play.

Natalie Portman plays a [way over dedicated] ballerina where she has the talent to portray the angelic aspect of the role in ""Swan Lake"" but is missing the ""soul"" to play the emotional aspect of the role. Her overbearing mother, Barbera Hershey completely embarrassing herself playing a modern day Piper Laurie's charactor from ""Carrie"", developing rival, Mila Kunis, and passionate/perverted director all pull on her as she unravels.

Portman's performance is interesting...if I was a 12 year old girl. The interaction is too catty for a viewer that doesn't understand the nuances of ballet to have empathy towards what is going on.

4245738,3,B0041KKYEM,"I really wanted to like this movie more, but the never ending scenes of her having hallucinations every minute and then coming back to reality, I felt it underscored the harsh realities of becoming a ballet superstar.

When I was young I was surrounded by those who performed in ballet and it is truly an unforgiving profession to be in, but it has some amazing benefits too. This movie should have done more to show why someone would push themselves to such extremes, instead of an oversimplified competitive reason alone (how Hollywood).

As much as there are those who wrote on how true this is to life as a ballerina, I disagree on the need for constant hallucinations to drive this point. The realities of what a person reaching the top of ballet world would outperform this movie any day and undress it as typical Hollywood theatrics.

But our society has increasingly become addicted to over-dramatization, slick CGI over well written scripts, and over fantasizing true life stories.

As much as the 5 star reviewers may dismiss this, I will not be amazed if ten years from now (or less), this movie will be selling at bargain basement prices and all but forgotten due to new movies even more outlandish in interpreting the realities of striving to become a superstar.",1321833600,10,1275,4.781818181818182
4245739,2,B0041KKYEM,"The ratings for this movie have a U-shaped distribution, which means that it's largely a ""love it or hate it"" experience.  I'm sincerely glad that some people enjoyed it, but unfortunately I have to be counted more in the ""hated it"" group.  Up to about 2/3 of the way into the movie, I still had hope that it could be a winner, since the movie at least had some intensity and sexual tension, but alas when it was over I felt that it had all been a waste of time.

Why so harsh?  Well, none of the characters are well developed, none of the relationships are well developed, not much really happens in the movie, and most importantly it never becomes clear what the lead character's problem is.  Was she always mentally ill?  What kind of mental illness did she have?  What was the cause?  Why was she not receiving any form of treatment?  Why did her mother allow her to pursue the rigors of ballet despite her condition?  There are no answers to be found in this movie.  In the end, I felt that shallow intrigue and gimmicks had been substituted for substance, with a big-name actress used to lure us in.

Needless to say, I can't recommend this movie (even if you're a ballet fan), but I'll now have a look at some of the favorable reviews to see why some people liked it.

Addendum: I've now finished reading several of the favorable reviews, and it seems that those reviewers tend to take this as a relatively abstract movie and often apply a psychoanalytic perspective.

Needless to say, I absolutely LOVED this movie.

I thought Natalie Portman did an especially spectacular job playing Nina; she captured the essence of a sexually-repressed twenty-something that is essentially going schizophrenic. Arnofsky's direction and cinematography in this movie were second only to some of the greats like Tarintino and Scorcese.

Mila Kunis played a typical role for her - the carefree spirit that doesn't play by the rules. With that being said, her acting during Natalie's hallucinations was fantastic.

With that being said, I think he's truly developing his own style: part pscyhological thriller; part horror; part drama.

noun
1. a dramatic form that does not observe the laws of cause and effect and that exaggerates emotion and emphasizes plot or action at the expense of characterization.

Unfortunately, I use the term pejoratively.

With a main character so relentlessly pathetic, meek and neurotic, I found my sympathy quickly transitioning to frustration and then boredom.  What little psychological tension existed by the film's end was extinguished when subtlety was abandoned and the symbolism become grotesque, absurd and ultimately, silly.

4245742,4,B0041KKYEM,"With a story based on Russian folk tales, Pyotr Tchaikovsky composed SWAN LAKE about 1875.  Although it was not well received on its debut, over time the ballet has become a world-wide favorite, and it is particularly noted for the fact that the prima ballerina must play both the virginal White Swan ""Odette"" and her alter ego, the wanton and evil Black Swan ""Odile.""  Directed by Darren Aronofsky and with story and script fashioned by writers Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz, and John McLaughlin, BLACK SWAN pivots on this schism--and owes a significant debt to three other notable films: PERSONA, in which two women have a relationship that confuses their personalities; THE RED SHOES, in which a ballerina becomes excessively involved in her role; and REPULSION, in which a sexually disturbed young woman collapses into insanity.  The film also owes a debt to such films as MULHOLLAND DR in the sense that it is difficult to know what is really happening to the ballerina and what is only occurring in her own mind.

In a general sense, the story concerns ballerina Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman), who has spent her career in the corps de ballet and whose great ambition as a dancer is to be absolutely perfect--an ambition that has rendered her flawless in precision but a shade lacking in passion.  When the company's leading ballerina Beth Macintyre (Winona Ryder) is essentially dismissed due to increasing age and an unstable temperment, Nina is announced as the star of a new production of SWAN LAKE.  Her confidence, however, is undermined by competing ballerina Lily (Mila Kunis), her suffocating mother (Barbara Hershey), and her choreographer (Vincent Cassel.) Under the pressure, and repeatedly told that she lacks the passion for the Black Swan, Nina begins to descend into a series of delusions that may be stress, personal fantasy, or flat out schizophrenia.  All of the moments are presented with remarkable power, and they lead to an uncertain but powerful conclusion.

The cast is memorable throughout, and Natalie Portman justly walked away with an Oscar for her performance.  At the same time, the film is not without flaws.  The first half of the film feels somewhat slow and overall the movie is icy cold.  Since every one of them deeply competitive and resorts to manipulation in an effort to dominate others, none of the characters are likeable or sympathetic, and the progression of the film seemed a bit spotty to me, skipping from one point to another without always connecting the dots.  Even so, it is a truly intriguing film, wildly Freudian, intensely paranoid, and unusual in every way.  Recommended.

4245743,5,B0041KKYEM,"Black Swan bursts onto the screen like a deadly virus or a mad cow disease! It hurls the camera in our faces, twirls the lead ballerina into chaos, despair and psychological turmoil. The film breaks the rules of my expectations as to what I usually define as an outstanding film. It is against my criteria for what I would consider a masterpiece in filmmaking; it splatters images at us like a psychotic action horror film and crashes into walls with dizzying effect like no other film since Schindler's List which made my outstanding five star review seventeen years ago! Black Swan manages to charge even more frenetic energy than most films in this genre; actually what genre is this creative crazy film?

This is an original multi-layered and artistic masterpiece which transcends genres, whose images surpass the story and whose leading actress elevates it to its inevitable conclusion with utter conviction! Bravo for your bravery, Aronofsky!",1320019200,,948,5.076923076923077
4245744,4,B0041KKYEM,"Natalie Portman gave a riveting performance in this film and won a very deserving Oscar in a tough and competitive Oscar year. Though this film would not get my nod for Best Picture contention, I think it was among the better films nominated for awards in 2010/2011.

Several reviews and the synopsis give an overview of the plot and events. I just found the acting to be stellar, especially Portman (as mentioned), Winona Ryder (sadly not a lot of screen time but what a performance) and Vincent Cassel. I thought Mila Kunis did well for breaking out of her traditional role style, but her performance was uneven.

The film builds nicely to a resounding finale that is firmly etched into my mind for the rest of my life. Love it or hate it, this is an emotional, complex, and striking psychological thriller that is worth watching at least once. Even for someone like me who knows little to nothing about ballet.",1319068800,3,913,4.6645962732919255
4245745,5,B0041KKYEM,"Sometimes the conception of art can be everything. Every artist approaches the subject in a unique way, and there is never a right or wrong option. Some alternatives, however, can lead to self-destructive behaviors (consequently, the image of the tormented artist has been tremendously popular in the past).

Darren Aranofsky's latest film deals with art and the delicate balance between Eros and Thanatos. As Sigmund Freud wrote in some of his books, the vital drive and the death drive are forces that coexist in each one of us. Nina, the protagonist, though, finds out that sometimes it's nearly impossible to regain a sense of selfness after such different and opposite forces menace to pull her apart.

Nina has a deep devotion for ballet. Her whole emotional stability seems to depend on being selected for the main role for the upcoming ballet production. She is a superb ballerina but her director constantly criticizes her for being too rigid, too cold, too passionless. What lies underneath her unruffled expression? What's beneath all that control and perfection of movement? Only neurosis, I'd dare to claim.

If life and death are the most relevant aspects as some philosophers might affirm, then one could easily find a connection between sexual impulses and the vital drive. But what would occur when the pulse of nature is denied? What happens when sexual activity is not only disregarded but put off altogether? Freud did a thorough analysis of his time and he reached one daunting conclusion, which was quite polemic back then: sexual repression always leads to neurosis.

Nina's director can easily spot the uptightness of the future star. She is not only tense, she is afraid of her own body, of her own sexuality. Perhaps one could identify Nina's mother as the source of all evils. It has been said before that it's so easy to blame everything on the parents that one should look for other possibilities. This case, however, proves that parental influence can be most detrimental. With a mother that watches over her daughter constantly, controlling her and treating her like a child, it's only foreseeable to understand how this will affect Nina.

When Nina's mother undresses her or sleeps in the same bedroom, the viewer may be shocked at the lack of privacy, but perhaps what is more shocking is the passive response of the protagonist. It should be understandable, then, to see those repressed feelings surmounting the mental barriers she has put into place; in fact, after certain events Nina will even fantasize about the possibility of engaging in a lesbian affair of most physical nature.

There is much suspense throughout the film, and the constant supernatural visions of intrusions of the ominous can take us back, again, to the Freudian unheimlich: quotidian activities or mundane locations are infused with something that might be real but at the same time defies possibility, thus instilling apprehension and anxiety in people. Nina will experience something similar, but in a much more frightful manner. The very first scene sets the tone for these dark and ominous moments.

Art is creation, but it can also be destruction. At moments it would look as if Nina won't be able to resist the pressure, and the constant visions she seems to have might be seen as proof of her weak psychological condition. She could crumble at any moment as things heat up. Surrounded by envious ballerinas, sieged by her director, betrayed by the only girl she could call friend, Nina will soon find out that true artistic creation requires absolute passion and commitment to survive the experience. And thus, finally, the viewers come to realize what is the ultimate conception of art in Nina's mind.",1318723200,7,3720,5.019448946515397

4245748,4,B0041KKYEM,"(Feb. 22, 2012) I discovered a clip on You Tube from 1968 that was danced on a sound stage. I have wondered where Nina's prologue was copied. This looks very much like it. Nina herself gives the hint when she says ""I Had the craziest dream last night. I was dancing the White Swan. It was different choreography though, more like the Bolshoi."" I Googled Amazon and found the 1968 version is still available. SWAN LAKE - YEVTEYEVA; KIROV BALLET, DUDKO. DVD released by AM@DO. See my review of same.
  (Oct. 9, 2011) Schizoid paraphrenic delusions. I had to pause-step-step-step to catch images so fleeting I wondered if I were delusional. But no, Nina sees herself everywhere, not just in mirrors where split images abound but on other persons bodies, (caution: spoilers), on the woman in the construction sidewalk cover; on the pas de quatre small swans dancers. She also kills ""herself"" in the dressing room scene. I had to step-step-step through this scene several times to catch it. As well as the bedroom scene. Finally; does Lily even exist? Or maybe I'm delusional after all?
  (Nov 11, 2011). I bought this when it was released on Blu Ray and have viewed it several times. Today I was watching again when the night club dance sequence began. I paused-step-step-stepped slowly through and discovered there is a lot going on in Nina's mind. All sorts of curiously psychotic images. Did I see Elvis' face pasted on another's body? Maybe.
  There is one very indicative scene. when Nina returns to the apartment, the image of Nina in the mirror is divided down the middle, but then (alter ego)Lily ""peels"" herself off and goes to stand in the hallway. No other spoilers; you will have to slow step through these sequences yourself, It took about a half hour but was well worth the effort. I love this movie.

4245749,2,B0041KKYEM,"I posted this review at IMDb already, but wanted to share my thoughts here as well. I'm a person that will stay away from a really hyped movie until after the noise dies down. Seeing movies over-hyped tends to cloud my opinion.  I finally caught this today, and I really don't see what the fuss was. As full disclosure, I didn't see any of the other movies in the Best Actress category, so I cannot say who deserved to win, but I was incredibly underwhelmed by NP's performance. Natalie's expressions were Stressed and More Stressed. Oh, and add a look of paranoia. Not a lot of range in this. My opinion of course, but with all the accolades, I was expecting to be blown away. I felt like I was watching NP play an obsessed (and mentally-ill) ballerina. In my opinion, Portman came off as very aware of this being an Oscar-bait role, and thus the performance never seemed natural or organic. As a note to that: MAJOR props to the special effects team. I thoroughly enjoyed Nina's visual transformation near the climax from the White Swan features to the Black Swan. I did shudder during that scene.

As for the story, I expected more. It was dark, but based on reviews, I expected something much more disturbing and maybe more unusual? I did turn away from certain parts, such as the breaking legs and the bloody feet scenes as things like that make me queasy. Based on my one viewing, it seemed to be a study on mental illness. Shades of Fight Club and Memento(both are superior), but without soul and genuine intrigue. I don't mind a movie left to the viewer's interpretation, but this movie made sure everything was up in the air. This movie asked us to make a lot of assumptions. We never saw Beth (Winona Ryder) dance. So it's unclear why (aside from being the prima) Nina idolizes her. We never see the other ladies audition, so Nina winning the part could really be a result of the director's creepy fixation on her than of talent. We don't see what makes Thomas' ""visceral"" Swan Lake so unique, in terms of how much of the actual performance we see. All we're watching is Nina's descent into further madness, which is fine, but I expected the climax to consume more of the run-time. No, I don't need anything spelled out, but the way the movie left things felt so obnoxious and lazy. On the other hand, could all the light/dark/black/white have been more obvious? I've never seen Swan Lake, but based on what I've read, this was a perverted interpretation. The gratuitous sex scenes were cheap (Monster's Ball cheap) and did not move the plot. Even Portman commented on how the scene w/Kunis was how you get people in the theater. The old train pervert served no purpose as well. I was hoping the movie would show appreciation for ballet, but it didn't, and I'm not a dancer. 127 Hours showed both the wonders and the dangers of nature, for example. The dream sequence in Oklahoma was a better tribute to ballet. Then again, two characters did talk us through the storyline of Swan Lake, so I guess that should have been a clue that we wouldn't ""see"" it.

Another thing that bothered me was we're to believe that Nina is obsessed about being the Swan, but she doesn't seem obsessive about anything else. Not asking for much, but something as simple as having to brush her hair w/100 strokes every night or some OCD-type habit. Don't think the vomiting applies b/c I think that was stress- related. I guess self-mutilation would work, as stated earlier, anything with blood or if I felt blood/peeling skin/etc coming, I looked away. Plus, this was not done in the open, so I feel they could have added something that other characters saw. The couple of ""mean girl"" ballerinas in the beginning of the film seemed like perfect candidates to hone in on some quirk of Nina's that would point to her problem. How is it that her obsessiveness is so contained? If gratuitous sex could be added, then surely, Aronofsky could have developed Nina more.

Mila Kunis' character wasn't as fleshed out as I expected which leads me to believe Nina imagined her. I believe the movie was about Nina's disturbed psyche likely brought on by her repressed childhood/adulthood and it culminated into her killing herself. She had a mom that was trying to live through her, and she had the internal struggle of not being good enough in a highly competitive profession.

As a superficial observation, Natalie Portman is only 30, but looked a lot older. I get the reasons for her weight loss, but visually, it did her no favors and she came across quite harsh onscreen.  NOT attacking Portman, but she looked no younger than Winona which made it somewhat unbelievable that Nina's supposedly this great dancer, but has yet to have a leading role at her age. I can't remember if they said how old she was, but anything other than 29/30 is not believable. Certainly not at a peak age which I hear is early 20s.

The ending was a letdown and possessed a cheese factor. When Nina said
""I felt it...It was perfect...That was perfect."" (complete with a smile), my ears actually heard "" All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up."" So cheesy. Probably won't watch again as it didn't live up to the hype. Mulholland Drive might have been a better movie. In fact, Summer Glau as a tortured ballerina dancing 'Giselle' ('Waiting in the Wings' episode of Angel) exhibited more emotion, intrigue, and coherency.",1318032000,2,5388,4.6415094339622645
4245750,2,B0041KKYEM,"Well ... the soundrack was excellent.  Sound editing intense, and gripping.  Aronofsky has always been a master of the immediate, of conveying a sense of actually being there and, here, he lets us peer into the world of ballet - the rehearsals, the physical demands, the unbelievable sacrifices of the dancers who perform.

But - in the last analysis - who could really care about any of the characters depicted here?  Our main character, played by Portman, is frigid, selfish, dominated by her mother, and deathly afraid of her own sexuality.  Her mother is well played by Barbara Hershey but is the quintessential weird mom, spending all day in her apartment creating paintings depicting an inner despair, and desperation, that she passed onto her similarly weird daughter.  The ballet director is a driven master of the art form, seeking to achieve his vision of ballet while satisfying his own egotistical, and sexual, desires.  In Portman's character, he finds the perfect foil - someone he would dominate (as he had the previous ingenue replaced by Portman) but whose advances are rejected because of her omnipresent (and ultimately tiresome) timidity and fear.

That leaves Mila Kunis' character - the biggest disappointment of the whole pointless affair. She mails in a performance that is right up there with one of her better episodes of ""That 70's Show"" - depicting yet another worldly, jaded, druggy ""free spirit"" whom women, these days, are so predictably encouraged to emulate.  What a crap performance, so stereotypical, and so atypical of what I expected from this director, who was so wonderful with the female leads in ""The Fountain.""

Well, someone should have written Darren the memo on the need for a sympathetic protagonist.  No one, not a single character in this twisted soap opera / ballet, was even remotely approximate to someone I'd want to spend 10 minutes with, let alone the almost two hours of this morbid psychotic fantasy.

And the ballet, itself, was flaccid.  Kudos to the cinematographer for using close-ups and clipped scenes when the actors, themselves, are filmed trying (but failing) to look like real ballet performers - sort of like a ballet music video.  Frankly, though, I would have preferred watching actual, top notch, ballet perfomances by talented dancers, to compensate for the unpleasantness of this weird, pointless - and overtly misogynistic - bizarre little film.",1318032000,6,2418,5.119592875318066

Cassel does a great job as the head honcho of the studio, exhibiting a difficulty artist personality who you have to listen to if you want to have a career.

Good focus on the subcultural life of ballet, especially in body expressions. Winona Ryder has a small part in this film (yes, she's still around). I thought they were going to ruin the ending but they pulled it off. Portman won Best Actress for this picture and the director was nominated.

4245761,5,B0041KKYEM,"Darren Aronofsky may have provided the source of my nightmares for the next ten years with his hauntingly realistic, yet, beautiful Black Swan. Natalie Portman as Nina plays the talented, yet erratic ballerina who is simply dying to be the Black Swan in a production of Swan Lake. Throughout her career though, she's been viewed as ""a very nice dancer"" the prototype for the White Swan. Her artistic director (Vincent Cassel) pushes her outside of her zone of comfort and into the reality of the Black Swan. But merely being pushed to the breaking point isn't quite good enough. She needs to be challenged by a new dancer the dark and mysterious Lilly (Mila Kunis). Challenged by this new, sleek swan, Nina slowly begins to lose control drifting in and out of reality and a fantasy world so blurred even I as the viewer had trouble deciphering between the two. Everything about Black Swan screams methodical and meticulous just like the real life ballet down to the depiction of Beth who can't handle being cast aside for younger dancers and is killed by running in front of a bus.

And as Aronofsky has said ""The Wrestler"" and ""Black Swan"" are companion pieces, let me make an observation and follow up with a suggestion.

Mr. Aronofsky In all your films, death is the ultimate definitive answer for perseverance and excellence of extraordinary competitive people (Pi, The Wrestler, Black Swan....dead dead dead....).

What it lacks, though, is a believable story.  It's too contrived.  I wanted to enjoy it, I really did, especially after the hoopla at the Oscars, but it left me cold.

Natalie Portman's character, Nina, is a ballerina with great technical ability, a perfectionist.  But she is obviously insecure, uptight and all-too-fragile.  She always seems to have a pained expression on her face and is not the vision of a prima ballerina.  I simply could not accept that Nina would ever be a serious contender for the challenging role as the Swan Queen.  Even the director of the ballet questions her ability to transform into the fiery and aggressive Black Swan.

Yet Nina is chosen for the role.  If she were not, of course, there would be no story.  Honestly, that seems the only reason why she was picked.  Her meek, fragile character provided a convenient baseline for the horrific transformation to follow.  Once chosen, Nina's decline is disturbing and often difficult to watch.  She eventually reaches a place where she is unable to separate fantasy from reality.

OK, Mr. Aronofsky, I get it. I get the whole ""price of fame"" and ""an artist's sacrifice"" and ""dark underbelly of high art"" thing. I even buy it. I buy Natalie Portman's strong, haunting performance. I buy the nonsense she has to go through in order to rise to the top. I buy the notion that a young woman can go through 20+ years of her life being completely normal, then all of a sudden crack under pressure and develop full-blown paranoid schizophrenia. I even buy the notion that the drawn-out lesbian sex scene is somehow relevant to the story, though I fail to see how.

What I DO NOT buy is that a person - any person in this world, even a raving schizophrenic - can dance two acts of a ballet (and dance perfectly at that) with a foot-long mirror shard embedded under their ribs, without batting an eyelid or anyone noticing or even a droplet of blood falling... then CONVENIENTLY begin to bleed just as the orchestra plays the final climatic chord.

Perhaps one day I might watch again and attempt to determine if the film at all has any redeeming social and personal value.

There are parents who put pressure on there children to do the same job as them. For example if the parents are doctors then they want there children to be doctors,etc. I think this movie shows how stress and perfection affected Portman's character. Also, competition stressed Portman to push herself to get the dance of the Swan Princes down to perfection.

I was like many a little girl who studied dance throughout my childhood up to the adolescent years. I rigorously practiced and loved loved loved 'point'. I had friends who auditioned for professional companies only to come back home in tears.  It is a most competitive field--it is where I learned all about Bulimia and Anorexia.

This is a real glimpse into that strange and dark world and the horror motif could not be more fitting.

The Barbara Hersey character--Natalie's mom--is perfect as the former artist who never made it. Therefore-she channels everything into her only child, daughter. This movie--although a bit twisted--is very much on target with its glimpse into the exclusive world of ballet.

4245793,4,B0041KKYEM,"`Black Swan' is the acclaimed psychological drama starring Natalie Portman as an over-stretched, tense and neurotic ballerina.

When Nina (played by Portman) wins the star role in the ballet Swan Lake she is informed she will also have to play the role of the black swan as well. Whilst she is well suited for the Queen swan role, she finds it harder to access the emotions needed for the black swan role. This film follows her as she searches for this character within her, whilst dealing with an over-bearing mother, a sexual predator dance director and a jealous fellow dancer. Soon the cracks begin to show and her neurosis' come flooding out.

It is shocking to see the lengths the ballet dancers go to in the name of perfection and whilst some of the behaviours are nothing new (like starving oneself, vomiting, excessive work loads and colleague animosity), they are still disturbing to watch. You feel that although Nina is a very fragile and neurotic person, she also doesn't get any type of support either.

This film feels very weird at times as Nina loses herself in her role, which only heightens the sense of Nina's breakdown and her fragile mental state. There are lots of minor hallucinations throughout which lead up to the films crescendo and the ending, despite being mildly clichd, does have an impact.

Portman acts very well and gives this film it's required edge and Kunis is great as the self assured jealous dancer. Winona Ryder shows up briefly as the outgoing ballet star and overall all three actresses give top performances. The direction is also very good and you can see why this film was so lauded at it's cinematic release.

This is a very good film and whilst it feels disjointed and confusing at times, this is all part of the plot and keeps the film edgy and tense. This is well worth a watch and while I won't be watching it again anytime soon, I am glad I took the time to view it now.

Is everything going to hell in a handcart all around her, or is she just imagining it because she's not eating anything?  Who knows?  Who cares?

4245806,2,B0041KKYEM,"The movies I see basically fall into two categories.  First, there are the movies that I am genuinely interested in viewing because I found the trailer, the source material (i.e. comic book, historical character), or the previous incarnation interesting.  These tend to be science fiction films, Pixar films, and movies derived from comic books.  Then there are the movies I watch because they are highly rated by critics and have been nominated for key awards.  Examples of the latter include the various Alfred Hitchcock films, the Godfather franchise, and the film Black Swan one starring Natalie Portman.

I expected a lot from this movie seeing that it got Natalie Portman her first Best Actress award at the Oscars.  I was disappointed.  Yes, this movie's content clearly took considerable skill and talent to pull off.  But the movie itself was neither good nor enjoyable.  This film was not enjoyable to watch because there were too many disturbing scenes.  Whether it be the imagined lesbian love scene, or the scene where Ms. Portman's character masturbates, or the various scenes where she confronts her mother, all of them were disturbing scenes that made the characters revolting.  Nothing was exotic, or even lurid, just revolting.  This film was not good for various reasons.  First, it was not original; there are other movies about individuals going crazy due to an obsession or obsessions.  The Aviator is a good example of such a film.  Second, I could not empathize with any of the characters, and any good movie should generate audience empathy for one or more characters.  Third, there was no comedy, no irony, no romance, or anything else in the film to complement the emotional and physical tragedy.  Great films should hit different notes with the audience, and this one was one note only - tragedy.  And last, for a movie built around the beautiful Swan Lake, the set design, costumes, cinematography and overall visual feel was subdued.  Outside of the 5 seconds or so of the movie when the main character imagines herself transforming into a black swan, I did not find any of the scenes memorable.  Overall, quite disappointing considering the quality of the director, Darren Aronofsky.  Even more disappointing was that this film was actually nominated for Best Picture by the Oscars when other, much better films from 2010 were ignored by the Oscars, films such as Kick-Ass, Harry Potter, Shutter Island, etc...",1309046400,2,2441,5.037406483790524

subject is treated with sensitivity and are well informed as opposed to those films that display
all manner of hysteria and perpetuate the pop-myths that surround mental illnesses, which,
may well be well intentioned, do more harm than good.
Then there are films which are there simply to entertain through the medium to convey what is
nothing more than a fairy story. Stories like the Swan Lake for example.
For sheer entertainment value - with the shock and the horror, with all its Gothic creepiness,
with things that go bump (and grind) in the night; with enough melodrama and pathos that
Tchaikovsky himself would have relished and applauded. I was even waiting for Freddy Kruger to

And let's face it, there isn't much of a plot or storyline here. The only thing that I got from this movie is that the main character is obviously unstable and is a bit of a child woman whose role in Swan Lake compels her to challenge herself to bring out her dark side, kind of like art imitating life. I thought the way the tale of Swan Lake juxtaposed rather well with that of Nina was very clever, but like I said, it's so shallow and one-dimensional. This movie could have done with a couple of flashbacks to help establish WHY Nina is unstable. We never know why. A lot more could have been done between the mother/daughter relationship, but they do nothing with it other than showing that mother and daughter obviously have a dysfunctional relationship. Why, we never know. I didn't mind the eroticism so much, but it was done in such a gimmicky, contrived way for me to really take seriously. It didn't add to the story; they seemed more of a distraction. All the time they put into the eroticism and the CGI stuff with Nina could have been spent in fleshing out the characters more (especially with Winona Rider's character...a lot could have been done with that as well, instead, all that's delivered with this character is violence and bitterness).

4245814,4,B0041KKYEM,"Natalie Portman deserves the Oscar for this role.

Other than that, my brain was a little squirmy after sitting through Black Swan.

Portman plays Nina who has been dancing ballet for quite a long time. Her troupe is going to put on a ""fresh take"" version of Swan Lake and she has been chosen to star as The Swan Queen. This role is actually two as she will be the White and Black swans.

The biggest trip of this film is that you don't ever really know what is real and what is inside Nina's mind. (She goes a little trippy with the stress of starring in such a huge production)

Her mother is a nag, she tends to be a little OCD, Nina is majorly paranoid that a new dancer is there to take her place and all the while she needs to find some dark aspect within herself to dance the Black Swan.

This rings out Independent Film all the way through the shoot. So if you are into that kind of feel, this will be one of your favorite movies. If you like stories where you will sit and think about the story long after the credits, you will want to talk about this with everyone you text.

Beware as there are some strong sexual scenes and other uncomfortable moments. I'm thinking of the hangnail part and the file-through-the-face scene.

This movie has so many graphic sex scenes it was too awkward for words, I did not know this going into it so I take responsibility for not reading up on it first.

Anyway the movie itself was alright, I expected a lot more. Movies don't have to explain everything, but I felt like there was no explanation for Nina's insanity, it was just kind of there. The ending was very abrupt but in this case it was a good thing because it keeps you guessing, I like how the concept of Swan Lake tied in with Nina's life but other than that I wasn't too impressed. As far as the sex scenes go, after a while it was like ok is this really needed? It got in the way I think they could have cut out some of it but it's not my movie so whatever.

Worth renting but in my case I don't think I would buy it.",1308182400,8,913,3.903225806451613
4245818,3,B0041KKYEM,I had big expectations for this movie but was let down. Natalie Portman did an excellent job & any praise given to her was well deserved. I wish I could say the same for the movie. It had potential but just seemed to go off in different directions leaving you confused. Some instances you were just left to wonder what actually happened. The sexuality in the movie was just odd. The relationship between the mother & daughter strange. Portman's role comes off as someone that was already suffering from mental illness before she gained the role in the ballet. 28 years old but living like a child. The new role pushes her over the edge and at the end I was left wondering... that was it? If it hadn't been for Portman I think this would have been a total flop.,1308096000,6,760,4.397163120567376

Why would anyone want to insult the audience with this loathing, slumming movie?

4245821,1,B0041KKYEM,"The acting in the movie was fine, but the story is pure crap.  Someone in the movie industry got behind this film and pushed it big time to create all the buzz and hype.  The lead character is schizophrenic, which could have lend itself to an interesting story, if the screenwriter and director had done something with it that was worth telling.  Instead, they thought picking at your finger nails and scratching at your back shoulder blades off and on for two hours was intriguing.  I did not find this movie engaging at all.  I was never drawn into the movie, and wanting to know more about the character.  The story was laborious:  I found myself just looking at my watch wondering, ""When is this going to end.""  And talk about endings: what a joke.  I have not found one person that I asked, who saw the movie, who said they liked it.  This is not about ""ones"" appreciation of the arts, artistic expression or lack thereof.  This is about having something to say, something worthwhile to tell if you're going to make a movie.  This movie reminds me of the ""Emperor's New Clothes"": too many people are afraid to come out, and state the obvious...the movie stinks!

If you like dance, (and even if you don't) and want to see a great movie (based on a true story) with a great story line, and one that makes you care about the characters and what happens to them...see ""Mao's Last Dancer""(also made in 2010).

Is it good? Yes it is. Good, but not great.

Many others have already summed up the plot of this film so I won't waste your time here, but if you're anything like me -- a person who didn't have a definite idea of what this film was about but is a fan of both Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis -- then this film should admirably fill a couple of hours of your day.

You could do a lot worse!

Anyway the movie seems a tad melodramatic, almost like it's taking itself too seriously as if it's a high art house film or something like that, and the aftertaste of this pretentiousness works against the film in my opinion, as a casual viewer.

If you're into ballet and the world of dance troupe politics then there's a lot of insider stuff to be enjoyed, and even if you're not an expert on this art form the film does a good job of drawing you in.

But the slowness of some parts rather than highlighting the exciting ones just gives the movie a ""could have been better"" flavor.

Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis are SO beautiful though. I'm Jealous, definitely.",1308009600,,1254,4.265822784810126
4245823,4,B0041KKYEM,"Nina (Natalie Portman) is your typical New York ballerina who would do anything to be the swan queen for the big production of ""Swan Lake"". She gets the part until the original player (Wiyona Ryder) gets in an accident, after that she wants to be perfect just like her until a rival named Lily (Mila Kunis) pushes to the edge. She goes on hallucinatory trips that brings her to the very brink of insanity.

A solid psychological horror thriller from Darren Aronofsky is one of his best movies and one of 2010's best movies. What really sold is that this movie is an artistic mind-screw in the tradition of David Lynch, Dario Argento and Alfred Hitchcock with brilliant acting from Portman and others, quality directions, imaginative yet disturbing hallucinations such as the cringe inducing cuticle pull sequence and a classical score to the soundtrack of the timeless classic ballet known as Swan Lake. I also like that it takes us on a dark journey into the depths of the subconcious as it includes a rousing girl-on-girl scene between Portman and Lily. I must applaud Darren for giving us one of 2010's best films.

4245826,5,B0041KKYEM,"It is amazing how while watching the movie for the first time I didn't realised what it was about and how the plot actually worked out in it. At first I didn't really understand why Nina was so depressing and dramatic over a role nor the weird things that happened to her during the whole film. I was wondering if this movie had a science fiction kind of thing going on here and there or if Nina was actually trying drugs to deal with her reality. It was at the end then that I understood the whole thing. So, I won't give the ending away nor the most interesting parts of the film but I will say that Natalie's work in her character is AMAZING and BRILLIANT wheter people find the movie good or not. And I'm saying this because in the story she just won't let me peek on the reality that Nina was living until the end. When an actor/actress is able to hide that in such a sutile way in the work they do on films THAT'S what I call brilliant!

The movie is dark indeed and is not suited for all kind of people. Even Natalie Portman's fans might find this movie weird and disturbing. I personally found it brilliant and real within the life and situations that a professional ballerina might face (not all of them, I must clarify). Now, before I wrap up this review I want to share with you a personal experience I lived with the movie. I watched it on a Saturday afternoon in my brothers' bedroom. By the time the movie was over (and I must point out that the very last scene remained tattoed on my mind not to mention Nina's life style as well) I stood up off my chair, went to my room and I sat down in front of my keyboard and two hours later a song was born. I came up with it and it's called ""Of lights and shadows"" that reflects Nina's life in the lyrics. A week later I recorded the song with my band and now I play it on my IPOD too often and everytime I listen to it it reminds me to Nina and that very last scene after all she went through. To me, the fact that Natalie's work here inspire me to compose that song was the best proof that this movie is brilliant.",1307577600,3,2072,4.103448275862069
4245827,4,B0041KKYEM,"Approaching 400 reviews at Amazon, I don't think that I have a lot to add that hasn't already been said about Black Swan. But for what it's worth, my 2 cents is that it is a great movie. Well acted. Well scripted. And certainly well directed by the same guy that brought us&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wrestler/dp/B001TOD9VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wrestler</a>. Like The Wrestler, Black Swan is a dark drama that gets into the psyche of its main character. Natalie Portman is the Black Swan (as well as the White Swan), and she turns in a performance worthy of her Golden Globe and Oscar wins for Best Actress.

In a nutshell, after Portman's character wins the lead in Swan Lake, she goes a bit cuckoo and essentially morphs into a living characterization of Odile, the Black Swan. But rest assured, if you've come looking for a movie solely about dance and ballet, you will either be pleasantly surprised or completely shocked. I was the former, although I did really know in advance that what lay ahead was a dark, foreboding movie about a gal that's not quite all there.

Speaking of dark and foreboding, gotta hand it to the film's musical score team as well. They did an expert job at building tension where there was none and making the tense moments seem more normal...well, more normal perhaps for someone losing their mind (Portman, not me!).

Mila Kunis costars, and she is as hot as her hot and heavy scenes with Portman are. I'm not sure that Kunis' performance warranted the Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress, but she should have won the MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Kiss with Portman. Hubba hubba. Anyway....

What I don't understand is all of the negative criticism that this movie received. I mean, even here at Amazon there are as many 1 and 2 star reviews combined as there are 5 star reviews. Makes me want to go all Odile on the 1 and 2 star reviewers and scream, ""What were you expecting?!""

4245828,2,B0041KKYEM,"I know that there are lots of people that really enjoyed this movie, and I am not knocking them for it.  Many will agree with me and many won't. I really looked forward to seeing this movie.  I was under the impression that it was about two girls competing for the same part and doing whatever it takes to get it. Actually, quite a few people I spoke to thought that. So I rented it.  Let me just say that for those of you that are considering watching it, be warned.  If you are into graphic sex scenes every five minutes, then this is your movie.  The main character Nina is a mentally ill ballerina that seems to completely loose it upon getting this role that in real life she would never even be considered for.  I found myself more confused more than anything. I do think that it had the making of a very good story, but then someone took it in a whole other direction.  Natalie Portman was good, but I found her character to be very annoying at times.  Mila Kunis was awesome and very likable.  I felt that the sex scenes were very over the top for this particular movie.  The scenes left nothing to the imagination and were unnecessary.  The part of Tomas, the instructor, although very well played, was creepy.  The way he talked to Nina, and his advances on her were out of line. But his telling her to go home and touch herself was ridiculous.  Then she does it, not realizing that her mother was in the room and had fallen asleep, while watching her sleep all night. Her mother seems aware of her mental illness, but doesn't seem to do anything about it except cut her nails so she doesn't scratch herself, paint creepy portraits of her and watch her sleep. It seems that the illness goes all the way back to her childhood, but her mother just hovers and watches her every move as if she is eight years old.  Not twenty eight.  It struck me as odd that no one around her noticed her odd behavior.  In the end I was left wondering what was real and what wasn't.  I like movies that make you think.  But this one left me asking ""huh?""  I felt that they could have clarified a lot of things. I am not a prude.  But I felt that this movie should have gotten an NC-17 rating.  The reason being that many people have seen or are going to see this movie not expecting the scenes to be so explicit.  If this had been Sex And The City, it wouldn't have bothered me, because the movie is all about that.  Actually Sex and the City was pretty tame compared to this.",1307577600,4,2466,4.244635193133047

However, you are seeing everything from Nina's (Portman) perspective, so I guess it makes sense since she's falls into this black swan role.

4245830,1,B0041KKYEM,"So I get that this film really appealed to art-minded viewer which is why I am so shocked that my mother and my cousin liked it. Usually they are not moved by the films with artistic depth.  This movie didn't go far enough for me. I understand that she was having issues, that her obsession with the art of the dance was driving her batty (or birdy) but I prefer a crazy person to be REAL CRAZY. I was left with too many questions and it would have been awsome if she really did KILL Mila Kunis' character. IDK, this just wasn't worth it to me. The sexuality didn't bother me, I notice a lot of reviewers had a problem with it and called the film pornography.  I don't know about that, but I did laugh when one viewer suggested that the scene when one of the girls was eating out of the ""pocket book"" of another was an artistic expression of sex as psychological (or something along those lines)  I don't know about that.  When I see Orland Bloom giving ""dome"" to Ashton Kutcher in a film as a expression of sex as psychological then maybe I will believe it. But IDK, most of the men that I talk to about this movie ONLY remember the scene when Portman was giving herself attention and when dinner was served in the Ballerina's bedroom.  I just would have liked to get more story and more expressions of the CRAZY and more explanation of what the crazy was. I thought the black swan dance was cool.",1307318400,7,1398,4.28030303030303

While the story for me was predictable (meaning the suprise at the end wasn't a suprise) I still thought it was a great movie, with great acting, and an interesting thrilling story. Both Mila Kunis and Natalie Portman acted well, and the movie is full of suspense taking you into the mind of Nina and her plunder into the depth of her role as the Swan Queen. The movie is filmed in a way that brings suspense, and drama, and of course the art of ballet in the movie is incredible. Portman so thouroughly transforms herself into a ballerina for this role that it's unbelievable. The dancing, and the art of ballet almost tells a story itself in the movie.

4245832,4,B0041KKYEM,"Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan can either be viewed as one of the most harrowing declines of an artist in recent memory or an exercise in high camp. Either way you view it this is one of those films that needs to be seen.

Nina ( Natalie Portman) is a ballerina in a New York City ballet company whose life, like all those in her profession, is completely consumed with dance. She lives with her obsessive former ballerina mother Erica ( Barbara Hershey) who exerts a suffocating control over her. When artistic director Thomas Leroy ( Vincent Cassel) decides to replace prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder) for the opening production of their new season, Swan Lake, Nina is his first choice. But Nina has competition: a new dancer, Lily (Mila Kunis), who impresses Leroy as well. Swan Lake requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan with innocence and grace, and the Black Swan, who represents guile and sensuality. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily is the personification of the Black Swan. As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side - a recklessness that threatens to destroy her.

This film was a breakthrough for Portman, who picked up the Oscar for best actress for her portrayal. She appears in every scene of the film and the performance is always engaging. Equally important is cinematographer Matthew Libatique's creepy hand held camera work which makes the entire film feel claustrophobic and more akin to a horror film than a a normal drama. This is a compelling film that may take several viewings to truly appreciate. The film is perhaps one of the darker offerings of the year also so don't go in expecting a pleasant ride.

The Blu Ray disc offers a great transfer. The original grainy feel produced from shooting with multiple types of camaras and film stocks is present making the film feel like an indie. The sound while not booming conveys the film's feeling quite well. Extra features inclue a fifty minute making of feature and  quite a few short promo type pieces.

4245835,5,B0041KKYEM,"It's obvious that this is not going to be a happy story.  There are no surprises, there is no sugar-coating, just the relentless tension of watching an uptight woman-child lose what little mental stability she has.  This is a trip into the lacuna of obsession that will speak to you if you've ever been there or have watched someone you love lose themselves in their myopic pursuit of perfection.  But you don't need to have been there to empathize with Nina, you just have to be willing to accept that some people go cuckoo when their self-worth has been built upon something as precarious as the approval required to succeed as a professional artist.

What I love is that this movie doesn't glorify Nina's self-destruction, it just shows you in ""full-frontal"" style brutality what it's like to be in her (toe)shoes.  At least that's what I got from watching it three times.

Don't write Black Swan off because it's one of those ""arty"" movies.  You don't need to be ""highbrow"" or able to deconstruct every scene to enjoy how beautifully done it was either.

The story fails to explain anything relevant other than to suggest that to dance well, ballerinas need to have an orgasm.  To be fair, this is the symbol of Natalie's frustrations and struggle to rise above being a child and become an adult but to also be fair, its hard to see the point.  The psychotic elements are typical and don't follow much of a theme and the overall script is purely abysmal.

Further, the actual dancing is minimal, especially considering it is supposed to be a key part of the storyline.

My suggestion is that if you want porn, buy real porn.  Otherwise, recognize that the best part of the film is Natalie's eye makeup in the end.",1306886400,28,805,4.510344827586207
4245849,5,B0041KKYEM,"So many people have dismissed the acting in this movie, and the characterizations, as one-sided, and have stated with assurance that they knew what was going to happen, that I must put my two cents' worth in. This movie is -- among other things -- a remarkable portrayal of narcissism in the flesh.

Narcissism, clinically defined, is the condition which makes the person act as if they are the only person of any importance in the world. Not only is she the center of the world, but she deserves to be there and anyone who does not recognize this and pay homage is simply too stupid to exist.

It's also a horribly painful way to live. We all have some degree of narcissism, but I don't know anyone who's ever felt that they are or were given all the positive attention they have ever wanted. Some psychologists say that while the major problem during Freud's time was neurosis, the corresponding problem today is narcissism. I think they're not far off.

Just a thought or two to chew on: what if we look at the movie with Nina and her mother as the main focus? It's clear that the mother is pushing Nina to fulfill the role she had wanted (and expected) for herself back in her youth, before her pregnancy with Nina forced her to stop dancing. Nina has been affected in such a way that she will do ANYTHING -- including some pretty overt self-destruction -- to make her mother love her. And it appears that no matter how beautifully she performs this role, she will not satisfy her mother; should she perform ""perfect,"" she will only incur her mother's wrath for bypassing her achievements.

The last words of the movie suggest some consideration of this angle. As she's dying, Nina says, ""I felt it! I felt it!"" and the director asks her what it is she felt. She answers, ""Perfect!"" and then dies, apparently in bliss. That's a question worth spending some time chewing on: what happened in the first 20-something years of this woman's life that she can finally be at peace ONLY when she was performed a piece so perfectly that it necessitates her death.

Sad. And hardly superficial acting- or story-wise.",1306886400,,2110,4.601063829787234

I liked how the story reflected how people all have different parts, some clearly present and some repressed. I loved the flow of the ballet. I would like to learn how to dance like this. The workouts seemed repetitive, yet it seemed as if it would feel good to the body. Performing in front of an audience seems daunting. Natalie's repressed emotions came out with intensity only with herself. She struggled alone without real understanding. I loved the beautiful cake, I would like to make it and to eat it. Her relationship with her mother went from nurturing to controlling and you felt her underneath emotions want to release. Her letting go with her role on stage was awesome. The whole sequence was riveting. I loved how she made her ballet shoes and I loved her and the dark swans beauty, Natalie's and the other actress. The other actress showed her gusto with the air of deviousness. I loved they way she tucked into the cheeseburger and her sauciness with others.",1306800000,,1086,4.661458333333333
4245851,5,B0041KKYEM,"I can't help comparing this movie with the story of another crazy girl who damages herself in her pursuit of perfection, an old story known as The Bell Jar.  There's one thing in this movie that I don't remember from The Bell Jar though that might explain the girl's overambition a bit better, and that is the driving force of the mother.  No wonder this poor ballerina went nuts.  She had an insane mother, an insane teacher, and an insane female dance partner (for lack of a better term).  The mother drove the ambition in the first place, the teacher purposely nourished it further and led to its distortion, and the dance partner fulfilled the distortion by feeding her the wrong messages.  It's really quite brilliantly weaved together for being as ugly as it is.

The one way in which this really differs from The Bell Jar is the ending, but other than that, I can't point out too many major differences.  I wish I could remember the driving force that made the girl in The Bell Jar so unable to handle failure, but I just can't.  I think as I read the book, I simply assumed the driving force was just the societal pressures of the day to succeed academically (which is far worse now than it was in the 60's).  All I know is I got past my first truly epic failure years ago, so I shouldn't be in this sort of danger.  Hooray for EPIC FAIL!",1306800000,2,1346,4.3694779116465865

Actually this is a great film, some kinda mental but with the thriller at the core with some traces of good old horror flicks. I remember the comments on amazon abut this one when I didn't see it, one was remarkable talking about an Argento style rip-off. Anyway, here is what you got: a sneak peek into the ballet (I'm a totally ignorant about it) world with the just portion of sensuality and sexual intensity with both feeling repression and untamed rage in a black atmosphere of human emotions and mental affections.

4245857,2,B0041KKYEM,"Black Swan has an identity crisis. It is somewhat a drama crossed with a horror movie but when all is said and done it is just the psychological misfire in the brain of the lead character. That is not to say that Natalie Portman does not do a good job acting because she does. She has the acting chops to play mentally disturbed and no one can deny that. Just as Mila Kunis can play the sexy bad girl as opposed to her comedic and action roles she has been in over the last few years. The acting and emotion in the movie is great.

So why only a 2? Well, the story is sort of boring and half way through I looked at my wife and said, ""I bet she (Blanks) in the end."" As I expected, she does. The story sort of meanders on too long and boredom starts to catch up and overtake something that could have been innovation. The Director, Darren Aronofsky could have played up more of the visual effects to really make the story stand out but the visual effects are to few and far between so they just seem almost out of place. Once again, the movie has a huge identity crisis and it works against it.

If you want to see it then check it out based on acting and cinematography but be prepared to be underwhelmed as far as the story goes.

4245861,5,B0041KKYEM,"I'm not a ballet fan, but I've always been mesmerized by the signature melody (Dance of the Swans) of SWAN LAKE that I probably first heard as a wee lad viewing the original DRACULA (with Bela Lugosi) on TV. I didn't--and actually still don't--understand why the theme was used in the DRACULA opening credits. Of course it's totally logical in THE BLACK SWAN. In addition to this, I missed the opening credits & didn't know who the director was, or who Natalie Portman was--OR that Barbara Hershey & Winona Ryder (both favorites of mine) was even in the movie. In other words, I was a sort of ""virgin"" for the first screening. If this isn't enough, I had no idea BLACK SWAN was a horror movie. I thought it was just about artistic rivalry--like THE RED SHOES or THE TURNING POINT.

If I had been aware that Darren Aranofsky was the director, a lot of things would have fallen in place sooner. I previously reviewed Aranofsky ""Pi"" & pretty much gave it a rave review. Certain elements of the low budget production were mirrored in this upscale, technically proficient film.

The plight of Natalie Portman's character is actually not so unique--just think of all the ""Stars"" who have been ground into dust in the performing arts milieu, particularly in the United States. Judy Garland was worked to death and many others (like Michael Jackson) were drugged to death. In this regard I think actor Vincent Cassel got his character just right. Push, push, and push. Always needing to keep the financial donors on his side, egomaniacal, often indifferent to the pain his artists were experiencing--a knave with genius. I've always thought that ballet was basically sadomasochistic & Cassel plays the perfect sadist. In the character's defense, he pushes his Swan Queen to the edge in order to bring out the aggression & seductiveness of her Black Swan role.

I felt that all the main actors were excellent. One reviewer faulted Portman's dancing--I thought she was pretty darn good all things considered. I mean you can't have everything (most of the time). She is an actress & does a great job revealing the dancer's morbid insecurities & the pressure that is assaulting her from all corners. Her portrayal of the Black Swan at the end is astonishing. Here we see the artistically integrated person, the girl transformed into a woman. Unfortunately for her it comes too late. Portman is stunningly gorgeous in this scene.

This is one of the best horror movies I've seen. It will be utterly fascinating to see what Aranofsky has next for his growing audience. THE BLACK SWAN proved that he is a really BIG player & force to be reckoned.",1306022400,2,2631,4.788546255506608

A well polished turd.

I will compliment this movie on the musical score it was very nice.
I will also compliment on the adaptation of Swan lake that was also nice.

However... the story couldn't be more awful. A girl with an over obsessive mother becomes a black swan once she releases her sexual frustration? How raunchy can you get? This isn't even a movie about a love story. It's like someone had an idea for a skimpy movie about a good girl gone bad and tried to sugar coat it by dipping it into the theatrical arts. What you get are the good pieces of the adaption of swan lake and the bad pieces the story of this freaking movie. The end result is this crap. Potential to turn this movie into something great was very high. Too bad they missed every step on this one.

This coming from a guy that usually likes these awkward types of movies (see my other reviews). I can't stand ""raunchy"" films like this where they expect you to take it seriously. It's not even tasteful and it disgraces the beauty of performance.

- I don't like films which are set in circumstances (in this case the world of ballet) for which I have no empathy, nor interest.

4245876,3,B0041KKYEM,"Now that The Black Swan has become available on video, I rented it from Netflix and watched it last night. I have to admit that it wasn't at all what I expected, having seen several dance and ballet films throughout the years. Although I can't say that I would highly recommend seeing it, especially for young impressionable minds, I do feel it is worth thinking about the ideas it puts forth. The theme of good and evil permeates the story, as Natalie Portman struggles to dance the role of both the White Swan and the Black Swan. The White Swan, representing her purity and grace, as opposed to the Black Swan, which in this case represents her dark or shadow side. The choreographer who chooses her to dance the lead role, places her under constant pressure to get in touch with her dark side. He seduces her and bullies her into learning the part, all the while telling her that it is for her own success as a dancer. Some of her peer dancers play along and exhibit qualities far from their graceful appearance as ballerinas. The idea of cut throat competition, throughout the film, distracts us from the gift of this beautiful art form.

Natalie Portman is seemingly surrounded by evil as she struggles to maintain her balance both literally and figuratively. The pressures put on her by not only her dancing associates but by her own Mother, makes us wonder how she has ever survived this long. Her anxiety and self mutilation is her way of releasing the pressure she is under, while trying to do what she is most happy doing in life, which is to dance.

After surviving several encounters with her selfish competitors, that lead her to compromise her own personal integrity, she finds the courage to chose herself over losing herself and dances the role perfectly. However, her seeming accomplishment is not without a steep price and loss, especially that of her graceful innocence.

The film made me question the whole concept of sacrificing one's own integrity for the sake of one's art form. It brings to mind several famous art personalities, who have compromised their own integrity, only to pay the price with the loss of their own soul and life.

For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul? Mark: 35",1305244800,3,2245,4.661616161616162
4245877,3,B0041KKYEM,"In `Black Swan' Darren Aronofsky depicts the pain a ballerina has to endure to successfully rise to the top of the profession, a similar theme which he had explored earlier in the film ` The Wrestler', this includes little food consumption, lot of body aches and of course sometimes bleeding toenails. Natalie Portman is the ballet dancer who is selected by the director as she embodies the character of the white swan that is innocence but he wants her to play the role of the black swan as well, of deception and intrigue. As she channels her psyche for the black swan, Portman finds that the black swan is taking over her entire persona. Acting by all the leads and supporting cast members was exemplary, Natalie Portman is truly a great actress and Mila Kunis is a revelation. Winona Ryder is surprisingly in form. The movie gathered so many accolades but I found it enjoyable but not great. Three stars. 3/30/2011",1305158400,3,918,4.708074534161491
4245878,4,B0041KKYEM,"It's easy to see that Darren Aronofsky was influenced by the classic THE RED SHOES ('48), except that the '48 film did not telegraph its tragic ending which came as somewhat of an abrupt surprise. On the other hand, BLACK SWAN telegraphs its outcome from Scene One, the major fault of the film which ends on an extremely downbeat note.

The highlight of BLACK SWAN is the presentation of the ballet music and all of the behind-the-scenes tension brought on by the determination of ballet maestro VINCENT CASSEL to find a dancer who can be both The White Swan and The Black Swan with equal expertise. He is impressed by NATALIE PORTMAN's skill as The White Swan but tells her she must experience life and love to the utmost in order to provide the proper passion for her darker side as the evil swan. It's hard to believe that he doesn't spot the flaws in her personality that make her unable to face the demands of the ballet world. However, he's excellent in his role, as is MILA KUNIS as her cunning rival.

Portman's mother (BARBARA HERSHEY) seems to be as neurotic as her unstable daughter in a Mommie Dearest sort of way. Their scenes together amp up what we know is bound to be a fatalistic end to an unhappy story. As the rival ballerina, MILA KUNIS provides plenty of jealousy for Portman, already unnerved by the demands that Cassel places on her emoting. Inevitably, Portman is pushed over the edge by all of her hallucinations and insecurities until she falls into a pit of darkness from which there is no escape.

Portman's skill as an actress is evident, overcoming any objections some might have to the heavy use of a body double for the difficult ballet moves. She gives her character dimension and pity, despite the unpleasant aspects of the character's irritating personality.

Worth a look for the performances alone, but beware that the dark side looms large in just about every scene which some might find too depressing for their taste and the sexual content is close to pornographic at times.",1305158400,18,2014,4.6807909604519775

4245885,3,B0041KKYEM,"Darren Aronofsky made such a bold, provocative debut with ""Pi"" back in 1998. But his career has been nothing but overwrought un-realism ever since. ""Black Swan"" is an uninspired rehash of Roman Polanski's superb ""Repulsion"" (1965), about an apparently schizophrenic, sexually repressed young woman who descends into madness amid paranoid hallucinations and libidinous men. ""Repulsion"" is a great film, while ""Black Swan"" is overwrought, gimmicky, not the least bit credible, and badly acted -not that it matters considering the superficiality of the exercise. It's also a ballet movie with hardly any ballet in it. Natalie Portman is in great shape but looks absurdly strained performing the simplest of movements.

Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is an emotionally disturbed young ballerina who seems to be living out the ambitions of her domineering mother (Barbara Hershey). Nevertheless, she is the hardest-working ballerina in her company, technically perfect, but lacking a certain passion. She dreams of dancing the Swan Queen in ""Swan Lake"", and, to her surprise and everyone else's, the company's choreographer Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) gives her the part. Mr. Leroy is confident in Nina's ability to play the White Swan but is concerned that she lacks the sexual energy and transcendence to play the Black Swan. The problem preoccupies Nina as well, and the stress erodes her grasp on reality and brings on increasingly violent psychotic episodes.

Natalie Portman does not have the acting chops for this role. She does not know how to convey emotion except by emoting. She does the entire film with furrowed brow. A better actress could have made Nina's torment believable but not her situation. It's simply not credible that this weak, flagrantly unstable person would possess the single-minded drive of a professional ballet dancer, much less that anyone would give her the lead in a production. She looks like she's going to have an anxiety attack in every scene. Mila Kunis, on the other hand, is charismatic as rival ballerina Lily, who seems to be genuinely trying to be friendly and helpful to Nina despite the latter's paranoia. Kunis' sassy, lewd and tattooed temptress screams out for more screen time than she gets.

Instead, we get crotch shots, hallucinations, CGI that allows Nina to sprout feathers, and very little ballet. On the bright side, ""Black Swan"" gets better as it goes along, because the story grows into Natalie Portman's panicked performance. By the final act, Nina has reason to break down under the stresses of her paranoia, hallucinations, and determination to become the Black Swan. The film is saved by good pacing, a suspenseful final act, and a climactic ending. But one lesson that filmmakers should find in ""Black Swan"" is that there is little point in setting a movie in a ballet company if there isn't going to be ballet dancing in it. Another is that a character's personality has to suit her role. And don't expect untalented actresses to be able to carry a dramatic film for an hour and 50 minutes.",1304812800,16,3053,5.114228456913827

4245896,4,B0041KKYEM,"Natalie Portman gives the performance of her life as Nina, the talented yet neurotic ballerina teetering close to the edge. In a way, this role is brilliant casting. Nina's vulnerability and chastity mirrors Portman's own public persona to some degree. She has adamantly refused to do nudity and sex scenes in the past. Even in her amazing turn in 'Closer' as a troubled stripper, she was never nude and there was still a pure, childlike quality about her that made you want to protect and nurture her.

In this film, that girlishness is intensified through the character of Nina, only to be destroyed by the end of the film through Nina's exploration of her sexuality and her dark side. Like Nina, Portman is required to 'lose herself' in a way that she never attempted before and the result is spellbinding. Her Academy Award was well deserved.

Mila Kunis also turns in a very solid performance. Her character is less demanding, acting wise, than Nina but I would disagree with other reviewers who claimed Lily lacked depth. It's just that there's an inscrutable quality to her. It's difficult to figure out if she's good-natured and friendly or a shrewd manipulator (which is the point). Kunis projected this ambiguity with great skill and this is certainly her best role to date.

Darren Aronofsky is known for creating visceral, startlingly intense films. This kind of intensity tends to provoke equally intense reactions in the viewers. Therefore, 'Black Swan' is a type of film that inspires few middle ground opinions; the majority of people will either love or hate it. Even though I happen to love this movie, I understand that there's equal ammo for both camps. Those who love it will be seduced by its dark, psychological undertow and those who hate it will shirk from its brash, head-turning quality of Aronofsky's direction. Either way, 'Black Swan' is not just a film, it's an experience.",1304294400,10,1904,4.906832298136646
4245897,3,B0041KKYEM,"""Black Swan"" is neither so long nor so glossy as its predecessor, ""The Red Shoes."" Both movies deal with balletic portrayals of fairy tales: the earlier film equates the dancer's life with the fairy tale; ""Black Swan"" transforms fairy-tale white into fatal black by having the dancer afflicted with spontaneous bleeding (Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia, or HHT) and bipolarity. Both films have impresarios whose malevolence consists in a devotion to art that, instead of being informative of themselves, is malignantly imposed upon a female dancer.  The cruelty (men's objectification of women) is washed away in the colorful extravaganza of ""The Red Shoes""; but it is painfully and productively exposed against the black ground of ""Black Swan.""  Moira Shearer and Natalie Portman are equally great, however, in effecting the intense integrity of Woman (the divine gender, to which the male is, as Robert Graves makes clear, a frightened adjunct).",1304208000,,953,5.476190476190476

Where the wrestler at least had a sense of a theme, reality at odds with the fantasy, and decent back up characters, Black swan is about as one dimensional and un-involving as it gets.
The movie shows the limitations of the director who is unable to convey any real world experience or value to the film. As seen in the fountain and the wrestler, he focuses on anguish and simply dwells on it for the whole movie, a real one note wonder.
Its basically a distorted perverted fairy tale with no real sense of reality. This type of story is best left to supermarket novels and comic books. To devote an entire movie to what is at best a sketch is pointless and grotesque. The story line is scant and relies heavily on cgi trickery and spends way too much time just following the anguished frequently masturbating Porty around. How many ways can you film her crotch being grabbed? Is that even interesting?

While Its obvious the movie is all about her, Portman is pretty bad in the role, she's just not interesting enough to sustain that type of film. Personally I think Portman is completely insulated overrated spoiled brat of an actress. Her overwrought constantly anguished overly twitchy acting gets old very fast. The dancing, what there was of it, is pretty weak and not worth watching. Its also obvious that Portman only dances in some close ups and is not very good at all. The final dance scene in which she is supposedly perfect is not even shown, only little tightly edited bits in a very underwhelming finale of this soiled undergarment of a movie.",1303948800,26,1592,4.605633802816901

With five Oscar nominations (cinematography, best picture, directing, editing and best actress), Black Swan took home the best actress statue for Natalie Portman. The $13 million budget meant that certain sacrifices had to be made, but the result is still a film of high quality.

***Spoilers within***

Black Swan is a psychological drama along the lines of Psycho, rather than a film about dance. Nina (Portman) is a ballet dancer who wants the leading role in a new adaptation of Swan Lake. The role consists of two elements; the white swan and the black swan. She's apparently the best candidate for the role and performs the white swan better than anyone, but is encouraged to abandon her self control in order to access the emotions needed to dance the black swan role. In order to do so, she toughens up mentally, becomes more assertive and confrontational and explores her sexuality.

Like Mulholland Dr. and Fight Club, the line between what is real and what is imagined is not obvious on first viewing. Nina is a disturbed young woman who has trouble staying grounded in reality. She imagines terrible things and obsesses about winning the role. Her duality is gradually revealed throughout the film and will frighten some people who allow themselves to become fully involved with the story.

I won't spoil things further, but Black Swan is an interesting tale of Nina's search for perfection in her art.

The technical aspects of the film are superb. The camera is frequently used to follow the dancers on stage and puts the viewer among the action. It's quite breathtaking in places. The editing and digital manipulation both convince the audience that Portman is performing all of the moves a ballet dancer might make.

Shot partially in 16mm and also digitally, Black Swan lacks the level of detail normally associated with a modern Blu-ray presentation. Many of the scenes are dark, while others are stylistic and intentionally soft. Heavy grain is present, but the look is very similar to the theatrical presentation. This is not a poor transfer; it's an accurate reproduction of the film's original look. Don't expect to be blown away. This isn't Avatar.

Portman trained for 10 months to learn how to move like a dancer. She also dieted so that her body fit the part. She fully deserved her Oscar nod for this performance. The supporting cast is strong in all areas, with her mother (Hershey), and her closest rival for the part of the swan queen, Lily (Kunis) both doing good work.

The special features offer interviews with Aronofsky, Portman, Hershey, Cassel and Ryder. There's a 49-minute featurette on how the film was made, including the music, cinematography and special effects. Well worth a look if you're a fan.

Black Swan draws you into its world. If you let it happen, you will be affected emotionally. The score enhances the experience considerably and the whole package is pleasing. It was one of the best five films of 2010.

When watching Black Swan keep your eyes out on the small things that go throughout the movie. Remember the story plott of the story of the White Swan. The story White Swan has many connections with the story plott of Black Swan. Also keep your eyes out on the the special effects such as Nina's (Natalie Portman) skin, and other phycological changes. The movie isn't a fully explained. I guess it's up to you to decide what truly happened. (-the movie is not recommended for those who have troubles understanding phycological movies. Movies such as: The Uninvited, Inception, and Shutter Island all fall into the catagory of phycological movies.)",1303603200,,752,4.792307692307692
4245920,5,B0041KKYEM,"Darren Aronofsky's 2011 psycho thriller Black Swan tells the story of dedicated ballerina Nina (Natalie Portman) and her journey to achieve the role of the white swan as well as its dark alter ego, the black swan, in ""Swan Lake"". The tremendous amount of pressure put forth on Nina from her overbearing mother (Barbara Hershey), her sexually advancing instructor (Vincent Cassel), a jealous ballerina (Wynona Rider), and her fiercest competitor (Mila Kunis) results in Nina stumbling into a psychotic rage where nobody, even viewers, can differentiate between reality and hallucinations. The film asks its audience two questions that everyone faces at some point in their lives: how far will you go to achieve your goals, and at what point should you stop trying?
 The Black Swan uses chaotic camera angles, fast paced action, intense sexual situations, and dark intimidating lighting to throw viewers into Nina's world where her thoughts are constantly gnawing at her sanity and she cannot tear herself from her alter ego, the swan. The film seeps into your thoughts and makes you question everything you're seeing.
 The film's greatest restriction is its gruesome nature. From Nina self-mutilating herself to another ballerina puncturing her face with metal hospital tools, this movie is not for the faint hearted. Horrifying displays of self-harm and psychotic rage appear when least expected, causing me to jump in my seat more than once. Black Swan is so terrifying, because it delves into the deepest most horrific corners of the human mind that most people never even experience.
 Aside from its dark nature, The Black Swan uses exceptional film techniques and beautiful visions to gracefully illustrate how fame and perseverance can mentally and physically destroy a person's life. For those who appreciate dancing and the arts, the film's beautiful depiction of the world of ballet will transfix and inspire you. Everyone in the cast captures the essence of their part meticulously making the audience feel as though they are experiencing all the jealousy, lust, frustration, rage, and accomplishment prominently displayed throughout the film. The film is stunningly portrayed making it memorable and thought provoking. The Black Swan is a perfect way for those who yearn to experience a serious film that they won't forget about the minute they leave the theater.",1303603200,,2373,5.289124668435013

All of the dancing sequences are shown from the waist up..no legs, and that was a huge mistake. The dance scenes instead seem like you are watching through a porthole. The story line was weak, and while I am not a prude, I can't help but think if they'd spent the same amount of time developing the movie as they did on the 4 masturbation scenes and one lesbian sex scene it would have been a better movie.  I'd only recommend the movie for the closing scene of the black swan where she grows her wings onstage, that was done well.

4245925,5,B0041KKYEM,"Darren Aronofsky is a brilliant director.  The stories he tells and performances he extracts from his actors really are nothing short of brilliant.  Whether or not you like Black Swan, it's impossible not to think about and analyze long after the credits roll.
The movie is unique in that it's a character study wrapped in a horror/thriller.  This is a character-driven movie.  Do not come in expecting car chases, gun fights, or slasher film blood and gore.  There is blood and gore, but it's all germane to the story being told and the character's descent into madness.  I don't typically care for Natalie Portman, but she does an amazing and thoroughly convincing job as a prima ballerina, a young girl who was never allowed to become a woman, and someone driven to madness in the battle to achieve perfection and essentially ""adulthood"".
Every frame of this movie, each scene can be analyzed for the subtext, what wasn't being said.  The visual effects are haunting and occasionally blink and you miss it--all of which help the audience to feel as unsettled as Nina.
The final act is simply amazing.
Know what you're getting into before watching this though.  It's not your typical schlocky broad Hollywood boring crowd pleaser.  It's quiet, understated, and masterful.  This film is all about story and its flawed characters.
I think of The Wrestler and Black Swan as companion pieces--brother and sister.  I'd recommend watching them both back to back.",1303344000,2,1458,4.958847736625515

4245927,5,B0041KKYEM,"I have to say that Black Swan caught me completely off guard. Watching the trailers I thought it was the typical underdog movie where a ballerina overcomes the obstacles and becomes the ""Swan Queen"". When I saw it in theaters, it was a completely a different experience. Black Swan is about a ballet ballerina but her biggest obstacle is herself. Being raised by an over-protective mother and being treated like a child, poor Nina never has ""loosen herself"". Her primal goal it's to be perfect and when her director casts her as the Swan Queen in the new production of Swan Lake she pushes herself to the limit both physically and mentally to be able to transform herself into the virginal White Swan and the seductive Black Swan effortlessly. This will cost her sanity and ultimately she succumbs to dementia.

Black Swan is such a crazy film in the good sense of the world. It's a psychological thiller that captures you since the very beginning and never let you go until the very end. Aronofsky's direction is bold and masterful and the cast is superb. Natalie Portman carries the picture spectacularly and the film wouldn't have the same impact if it weren't for her masterful performance. She really earned her Oscar.

Black Swan is without a doubt one of the best pictures of last year and with an excellent direction, wonderful score and spectacular performances this thriller will take you in a roller coaster of high quality entertinment.

Video & Audio:

Black Swan arrives on BD with a great transfe. Filmed with a variety of cameras, the film has a thick grain structure and skin tones are really detailed. Blacks are solid and there are no signs of compression artifacts or other anormalities. A great picture transfer by Fox. Likewise the 5.1 DTS-HD MA  is a great companion to the picture enhancing the score and providing a solid audio presentation. Dialogues are crisp and clear. Well done Fox.

Special Features:

You have some goodies in the bonus features department. First and most important is the documentary ""Black Swan Metamorphosis"" which deals with all the aspects of the production of the film. It's a great documentary. Then also you have short promotional featurettes dealing with the ballet, production design, costumes, cast profiles and interviews and a theatrical trailer.

A digital copy is also offered.

Final Thoughts:

Black Swan is an instant classic and has a lot of good qualities that makes this film a must-own title. With great video and audio and a good quality of bonus features this BD is highly recommended to anyone who appreciates a good movie.",1303257600,2,2596,4.8929384965831435
4245928,1,B0041KKYEM,"Don't get me wrong: I like Natalie Portman. But in this movie she does not act and she didn't dance either. She is linear, one-dimensional and utterly boring. An Oscar for this? Oh, but she lost lots of weight for this role, right. And her face looked really tortured and repulsive with all those grimaces.

 The movie itself is actually painfully boring and extremely predictable--from the very first minute. What a waste of my time.

Beyond the boredom, I found two things quite embarrassing:
1. The red eyes sequences (no comment...); and
2. The obvious--and quite desperate--""inspiration"" from other movies, especially from Haneke's ""Piano Teacher"" when it comes to Nina's relationship with her mother (for example).

Now talking about Haneke: Aronofksy is no Haneke. No way. Not in this world. There is a million years distance between the two of them. Aronofky doesn't have Haneke's tension, angst, despair and deep knowledge and understanding of human tragedy, and of human condition, in general. Therefore, his movie is just a (poor) caricature.

The symbolism is spot-on - this is a film about a classic crisis with the Shadow in the Jungian sense, and it couldn't have been better. Portman is forced to face the darker half of herself in the most brutal way possible, and the cast and crew pulled it off magnificently. The use of mirrors to examine oneself in the most critical light was well done, as it wasn't thrust in your face but if you picked up on it early, you could certainly see what was kept in mind while filming.

Portman, representing the Id in this case, was fantastic. Her childish, controlled ways fighting to emerge so perfectly captured the psyche entering the realm of the crisis. Her mother, controlling these urges and repressing anything she found societal controls would disprove of, worked wonderfully to carry the point across. And Kunis - oh Kunis - her depiction of the shadow blending into the realm of the Id was just too good.

Well recommended - especially for a double-viewing. Watch once to take it in, watch again to examine.

4245932,2,B0041KKYEM,"Even as complete banal schlock, the film could have been vastly improved would that Mel Brooks produced, wrote, directed, and also starred in it. Were that done, the fact that none of the principals seem to have attended any acting school would not matter quite so much. But, admittedly, one's heart had to go out to the maudlin Ms. Portman when she tried to efface ""WHORE"" from the mirror without even as much as a little spritz of WINDEX (tm) ! If only that once. Then too, Ms. Portman's ubiquitous grimaces could probably have been substantially relieved simply by adding more fibre to her diet.

P.S. The only thing I really liked was the dance sequence ""doubling"" for Ms. Portman, likely being done by the same person who plays ""Jake Harper"" in TwoAndAHalfMen. What an improvement ! Because, in fact, almost all the solo ""ballet"" action fell more than quite a bit short of ""Jake's"" artistry. Good thing I'd not eaten for about 10 hours.

4245934,5,B0041KKYEM,"I've never been a fan of Portman, but in this movie she was fantastic because she actually dared to do some acting.  Maybe the storyline itself was the influence, as Portman's character had to do some real internal dancing as well to fill both aspects of the role she'd been cautiously chosen for--that of both the White and Black Swans.

Gripping from the beginning without a breather, this movie makes the most of all its cast, but I'd expect nothing less from an Aronofsky production.  Thankfully this wasn't the usual ballet-snoozefest; I never dreamed a dancing film could be so dark.",1303084800,,589,4.811881188118812

However Black Swan delivered on none of these. This film was so concentrated on the actual Ballet that the story never delivered, it just kind of whimpered out like the last slow breath of a dying rat. Unfortunately this should have delivered on what I beleive should be a new Academy Award Category: Most Overhyped Letdown Film of the Year.

4245939,4,B0041KKYEM,"Natalie Portman, having physically trained many months for the role, masterfully portrays the tortured ballerina Nina, hell bent upon achieving perfection in Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. Although the director, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), has cast Nina in the lead role of the Swan--a two-sided character--he constantly taunts and berates her that she is lacking in the passion to portray the dark side of the role--The Black Swan. That Nina does have a dark side is terrifyingly true, yet her obsession with perfection has her stretched-thin psyche holding it back. It doesn't help that her greatest ally and fan is actually her controlling, smothering mother. She has a history of self-harm in the form of scratching herself without even being aware that she has done it. With all of the internal and external pressure, she begins to crack. New scratches appear. She begins to see things that are not there and imagine things that did not happen. The tension of the cut-throat atmosphere in the ballet troupe draws the viewer into the madness also. Nina's paranoia focuses on Lily, a new dancer from the west coast, and Lily becomes both her nemesis as well as her mimesis (imitator or rival). The film capitalizes on the aspects of duality in the white/black swan and the Nina/Lily dancer. Lily is not so technically polished as Nina, yet she has the freedom and enthusiasm that Lily lacks. Lily tries to, or seems to try, depending on your point of view, befriend Nina and to get her to loosen up. All the while Nina thinks that Lily is trying to take her place, and, indeed Lily is eventually assigned as understudy for the Swan and very nearly replaces her on opening night. That Nina ultimately achieves a thrillingly dark and passionate Black Swan performance means for her that she has already jumped off the precipice of sanity even before the Swan character jumps off the ledge into the hidden mattress below.",1302912000,5,1918,4.904615384615385

THe blu ray looks great and Natalie deserved best actress all the way for this  movie. It's not a easy  movie to watch , nor should it be as movies about mental illness are never pleasant.

Final scene:  a  gaping, growing abdominal wound worsens on a ballerina with  a self mutilation psychosis as she moans something about being 'perfect now'.  Too much mirror had been  crammed into her abdomen by her own hand.  Dunno. That crater wound from a sliver coupled with the choreographer's asking in falsetto tone--and too calmly-- if she's alright.  Hmmm. The scene where her mother's paintings dance around is just plain funny as well.  I dislike this film for making me laugh at moments that were totally inappropriate:))

Second point, though a technical afterthought. Having gone to school with a doc who wanted to write,  I remember his  wanting to fit all of  Polti's plots into  a magnum opus. His first book.

How do you win an Oscar with zero acting? We know Portman had a double doing all the intricate dancing, so that basically leaves her screaming and crying the rest of the movie.

I thought it was going to be a movie about a ballerina going insane, which I guess technically it was. Only I wouldn't use the term 'movie'. I suppose you could use the term 'Work of Art', but there are plenty of things out there you could call that and it wouldn't really mean much. Sure, it took a lot of effort and the performances were believable (which was very impressive). But the appeal was not there, not there at all. Which I found ironic, because by the end of the movie I found myself feeling much like the cranky (and apparently lecherous?) dance company owner guy. Like, um, this is impressive and all, but could you actually make it entertain me a little? Which it doesn't do. Not even a little. There were even some times when I laughed, but not so much because it was funny, but because it was just so weird it caught me off guard just how stupid of an idea some of the scenes were.

And anyway, we don't need anymore reminders that women are often not told they are perfect, no matter how close to it they are. And we certainly don't need to praise a film that basically says women who aren't perfect should jump off a cliff like their swan queen and bleed to death on a mattress.

This was really kind of terrible. I mean yeah, they did a good job making it and all. But it is nothing but sadness and evil. There is no light in this film at all. And the sex stuff was completely over the top, and very unnecessary. The extensive cussing in the dialogue was tacky too.

4245954,4,B0041KKYEM,"Last year the world went kind of crazy for `Black Swan', the film that finally brought the world of Darren Aronofsky into the limelight for all to see.  Aronofsky has been creating quality and uniquely intriguing films since the late 90's, and he has brushed Oscar's hand before (garnering acting nominations for `Requiem for a Dream' and `The Wrestler') but it was the bizarrely obsessive `Black Swan' that finally garnered him an acting win (Natalie Portman) as well as Best Picture and Best Director nominations.  It surprises me that this film was `the one' since it is his most immature film to be quite honest.  That isn't to say that it isn't littered with wonderful treats, and Aronofsky's manic yet oddly controlled direction was most deserving of a nomination, but at the end of the day this film is middle-brow Aronofsky at best.

I told a friend that this film was like a strange blend of `The Red Shoes' and `Carrie' (two masterpieces) directed by Lars von Trier (genius auteur) with a more polished production thanks to a larger budget.

Yes, `Black Swan' is an ugly duckling.

The film centers around a young ballerina named Nina who is desperately seeking perfection.  She wants the lead role in her company's revival of `Swan Lake' and she obsesses over the idea of being the Swan Queen, so much so that her whole world starts to take a dark tone.  She is virginal and innocent and childlike in many ways, and so she lacks the otherworldly knowledge to play the dual role part, but she is talented and thus believed in and so she is given the part.  Nina needs to break free from the constraints of her personality, but her upbringing (and her monstrously intrusive mother) makes it hard for her to `let go'.  Then Nina meets Lilly, a young ballerina, new to the company, who possesses everything that Nina lacks; namely sex appeal.  Nina becomes consumed with Lilly, mainly because she is afraid of her.  She begins to suspect that Lilly only wants to take away the lead role from her, and when Lilly is made her alternate she begins to lose her mind with fearful anxiety.

`Black Swan' is a very blunt film that doesn't really know the word `restraint', which to be honest is part of the appeal.  The film doesn't hesitate to dive off the crazy train and make a free-fall for deeper waters, especially in the film's final act (which is a visceral work of genius).  The preposterous of the film is highlighted and embraced by Aronofsky's fearless direction, and so you have to appreciate that that is the impression he wanted to make.  Still, there is a feeling of cheapness that erodes some of my affection for the film.

I also found that the film's ensemble was very lacking.  There are no layers to these characters.  They are mere caricatures, props for Aronofsky to toy with as he pleases.  I know that a lot of hoopla was made over Natalie Portman and her eventual Oscar win, but I honestly didn't find a lot of depth in her performance.  She was just crazy.  She never really got under the skin of Nina, uncovering who she really was.  Granted, the more I see and contemplate the film I gather that understanding the complexities of Nina wasn't really the point (this film is guilty pleasure personified) but a little depth explored would have fleshed her out and made her more understandable.  Barbara Hershey was also kind of one-note and clichd, and not in the way that made her interesting.  Vincent Cassel was horrendous, his line readings were awkward and unbelievable.  In fact, as much as her awards attention baffled me, Mila Kunis was probably the best performance in the film; creating someone we were enthralled with and toying with Nina in a playfully seductive and mysterious manner.

And yet still, the film is electrifying and unforgettable.  The cinematography, costume design, makeup, sound (OMG, the way you can hear every swipe of Nina's feet on the floor is to die for), editing and that beautifully haunting reworking of `Swan Lakes' score is just delicious to watch, and Darren Aronofsky knows exactly how to play the audience, drawing us in despite the film's apparent flaws.  This may be Darren's most immature film, but it's quite possibly his best directorial accomplishment.

So in the end, I can't hate this film.  I don't understand the unabashed love for it, but I do understand the obsession over it.  It is a film about obsession that captivates its central core by defining obsession.  It oozes with charisma and sucks you in full throttle.",1302652800,3,4500,4.74293059125964
4245955,5,B0041KKYEM,"Director Darren Aronofsky brilliantly explores the psychological landscape of one Nina Sayres (a perfect name for a ballet star) in his grand opus, ""Swan Lake."" I give a standing ovation and five stars (actually four and one half but clicking five out of necessity)!

This is a film seemingly about ballet, the ballet world and its backstabbing and jealousies. It's a film about competition, both individual and between individuals. It's about mother-daughter conflicts. It's about the power of a male boss over his female employees.

However, ""Swan Lake"" is, foremost, the setting for a psychological thriller which details the mind of one character, Nina. She is the unfortunate daughter of a former ballet dancer who had to quit the business because of pregnancy. What this mother did was shift her failed dreams upon her hapless and weak daughter. Nina is not normal. It doesn't take the audience long to understand why and how.

The star of the ballet ""Swan Lake"" can be danced by two women or by one with dual roles. The swans are dichotomous: one pure, virginal, innocent; the other evil, passionate, sensual. Nina is the perfect white swam, but the director wants to choose someone to dance both roles. Because of her perfect technique, Nina finally wins the role with a promise to the director and his own determination that she will, indeed, be a great black swan and all it implies.

But, alas, Nina is sooooo conflicted, so conflicted, in fact, that she is hallucinating. That old man on the subway is not making lewd gestures toward her.  Because her single focus in life is ballet, she has repressed, unknowingly, her needs and desires. Repression can behave in bizarre ways.

Once she earns the role, Nina's repression causes more problems than hallucinations. A rash breaks out. She peels pieces of flesh from her fingers, only to discover that she didn't. A new dancer tries to befriend Nina. Finally, in a confrontation with her mother, she chooses the friend and goes out to party. Influenced by drugs and alcohol and a loosening of her inhibitions, Nina hallucinates a big one: She and the friend have a passionate sex scene.

And so it goes. This is Nina, reaching the climax of her life--the epitome. She has already watched what happens to an aging star who previously danced this role. It's an ugly scenario. She lives with a mother who is bitter because she could no longer dance. What's a girl to do?

Nina finally pierces her core to find what it takes to dance the Black Swan and wins a standing ovation. At what cost?

I would like to leave my review at the previous paragraph, but I cannot. I accepted the director's use of surreal hallucinations as realistic, coming from a very repressed, rigid mindset with one single purpose in life: to dance. What I cannot accept is the act that pulls the passion from Nina's deepest self to win highest accolades from the director and the audience. Aronofsky made me accept Nina's pitiful existence and the deranged visions, but not the final physical act. Nope.

Does Natalie Portman deserve her Academy award? It is certainly a performance worthy of the award. To maintain that magnitude of fear and even terror and repression and uncertainty over the weeks of filming is surely a feat of willpower in itself. In today's market of many very talented female actors, I don't know if Portman is THE one. Not having seen the other movies yet, I cannot be definitive, but Portman as Nina is certainly a contender.",1302652800,3,3480,4.814070351758794

Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations at all. It was odd and disjointed, and the acting (with the exception of Barbara Hershey and Mila Kunis, and whoever the actress is that coaches Natalie Portman in the ""swan"" movements) was horrendous. I'd never seen Ms. Portman in anything. Based on this movie, I think she has to be one of the worst actresses I've ever seen. Also, the use of the f-word seemed so forced and artificial, as though it was simply put into the script because someone thought that audiences just expect it in films; and some of the other lines seemed to have been added only for their supposed shock value. The club/drug scene was one of the most bizarre things I've seen and didn't add any value at all to the movie. Finally, some of the sound effects are ridiculous, really laughable. Just an overall disappointment and waste of money.

UPDATE:  Since I continued to hear how wonderful it was, I decided to give it another try (and another and another), thinking that perhaps I'd been too harsh and had missed something somehow. However, the more I watched it the more awful I thought it was. Then I watched a story on 20/20 about it, and became even more convinced it was garbage. Turns out the main reason Natalie Portman won an Oscar for her role was because the Academy voters (and the rest of the world) were led to believe that she did most/all of the dancing herself, which is a lie, and if they'd known she didn't they wouldn't have voted for her in the first place since the dancing was such a huge part of the role.

This only added to my need to see this movie. I went into this with very high expectations and was not let down. The movie plays out very slowly in the complete mind of Nina who after a while you realize she isn't the best narrator. The movie is directed by Darren Aronofsky who also directed a companion piece to Black Swan (The Wrestler) another brilliant character study. The Script had been thought of for over 10 years, and both the director and Portman have been on the project since then. The Acting is breathtaking. I was rooting for Natalie as she rightfully won the Oscar, she made a very complex character who is very fragile. All Supporting was very good as well Milia Kunis has been stunning me for quite a while and has a bright career ahead. The Direction was perfect, the camera is always on Natalie always dancing with her. It really helps get you into the character even more. The movie plays out like a mind-trip the further into the movie you go the less sure of anything that happens.

I admit, it was ""enjoyable"" some of the time and kept my interest. That said, it isn't at all the great ""psychological thriller"" so many have made it out to be. I was not on the edge of my seat at all and roughly one quarter in, I knew exactly how this would all turn out. The plot devices fail almost every time.

I just kept thinking that she was going to stop and yell at the audience.  After watching her mother go a little psycho, I thought poor thing never had a chance.  I then started thinking if she had someone, well anyone in her life that was more normal, maybe she would not have gone so far.

They could have summed it up in 5 minutes that she lost her mind and became the black swan and gotten on with the movie. After about 5 minutes of watching her run away from hallucinations you put your head in your hands and find yourself wondering when the sex scene is coming.

It also is a complete replica of Darren's other movie, ""The Wrestler,"" where Micky Rourke plays a drugged out, crazy wrestler. As he had a heart attack previously in the ring, people are telling him to give up his passion, but he keeps pushing and pays the final price in the end, (DOUBLE SPOILER ALERT) jumping to his death in the end, just like ""Black Swan."" Darren said that they actually were meant to be the same movie about a wrestler falling for a ballerina, but he decided it was too complicated.

It's more about the pressures of performance and interpretation - which are far less interesting than creativity.

It is more a parable about the dog-eat-dog-job-market than about art.  We see what the main character does to get ahead, but we don't see what she does to personally grow creatively. (This is a Hollywood corporate fantasy of ""individual creativity."")

A somewhat stilted but much more interesting cinematic exploration of the nature of creativity is John Turturro's film ""Illuminata.""  This film explores creation as an aspect of collaboration in a far more searching and intelligent manner.

4245967,1,B0041KKYEM,"I've never seen a film (or play or TV show or opera or ballet) fail on so many levels.

A friend of mine, who is not interested in ballet, saw ""Black Swan.""  When I asked him if the movie got him interested in seeing the actual ballet, he said no.  After seeing ""Black Swan,"" I now know why.

Where to start?  First, the film provides absolutely no context for the Black Swan.  Her name is Odile, and in the ballet, she only appears for approximately 20 minutes in Act II, when she dances with Prince Siegfried, and tricks him into proposing marriage to her.  (The prince thinks he is romancing Odette).  And it is crucial to note that the way Odile beguiles Siegfried is by acting exactly like the demure and fragile Odette.  The Black Swan is not a slutty version of Odette, but a faithful reproduction.  If you can dance the White Swan, you can dance the Black Swan.

Second, keeping with the claustrophobic atmosphere of the film, the jumbled scenes from ""Swan Lake"" look like they are taking place in a high school gym.  This mish-mash  is confusing, silly, and excruciatingly corny.  I haven't seen anything so awful since the idiotic nonsense that climaxed ""Staying Alive"" with John Travolta, way back when.  (It had someting to do with the Travolta character being in Hell, I think.)

Third, for some reason, ""Black Swan"" appears to intentionally by-pass all the grandeur, bravura, and flat-out fun of one of the most beloved ballets in existence.

Fourth, nowhere in film is stereotyping worse than when it comes to ballet.  Ballet schools are always stuffy and overbearing.  With ""Black Swan,"" you can add cut-throat and predatory.

Fifth, I saw no acting whatsoever by Ms. Portman as Nina.  Her character starts out emotionally disturbed, gets somewhat nuttier, but always remains incedibly stupid.  For example, her rival takes her out boozing and slips her a mickey, which does not seem to ring any bells in Nina's head.

Sixth, there has been some buzz about how much Ms. Portman actually danced in the film.  I would say that based on her blocky, ugly, and pathetic staggerings, she did it all.

Finally, if you might be interested in seeing a great DVD of ""Swan Lake,"" I would recommend the version featuring Nina Ananiashvili and the State Perm Ballet.  (Available on Amazon!)  If, however, ""Black Swan"" has permanently driven you from the world of ""Swan Lake"" and ""Giselle,"" I understand.",1302307200,29,2406,4.776699029126213

4245971,4,B0041KKYEM,"It is very difficult to review and rate this movie. I agree that three stars seems too low for such a fascinating psychological thriller yet five stars seems too high for something so supremely confusing. So I too settled on four stars for this strange but fascinating film. Natalie Portman (Nina Sayers) is absolutely phenomenal as is Lily (Mila Kunis).

Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan is about a very innocent sexually repressed perfectionist emotionally disturbed somewhat obsessive compulsive ballet dancer (Nina) who is very controlled by her domineering mother Erica, played by Barbara Hershey. Nina is seeking the much desired main role of the 'White Swan turned Black Swan' (Swan Queen) in the prestigious New York ballet's production ""Swan Lake"" since the previous Black Swan (Beth, briefly played by Winona Ryder), has been forced to retire by the sexually predatory artistic director (Thomas Leroy brilliantly played by Vincent Cassel).

The sensual and charming Thomas believes that Nina lacks the necessary fire and emotion to play the transformed passionate Black Swan. After coming on to her, she bites his lip and storms out. She assumes that a dancer named Lily will get the lead and congratulates her. But Thomas awards Nina the part because he thinks she can perform phenomenally if she can only show that same fire and emotion; Lily confronts Nina angrily since she believes that Nina knew she got the part and was just rubbing it in Lily's face. Thus begins a complicated relationship between Nina and Lily which is confusing because you don't know what is real and what is not. Friendship, rivalry, attraction, or all of those, I was unsure.

Lily and Nina appear to become friends but Nina becomes convinced that Lily wants her part. Lily tries to seduce Thomas (again, not sure if this is real or imagined) and he appears to have second thoughts about Nina playing the Black Swan. Since Nina is so 'perfect and innocent' and Lily so 'dangerous, deceptive and free', Thomas begins to consider switching Lily to play the Black Swan and Nina to play one of the many White Swans.

Nina begins to break down emotionally under the pressure to achieve the perfection she so desires, and the film gets strange as her dark side emerges more and more; she self mutilates and she hallucinates but I became confused about what was reality vs hallucination as Nina herself seems to transform from the timid White Swan to the jealous sensual Black Swan. Nina's very controlling and somewhat disturbed and disturbing mother, who used to be a ballet dancer but claims she gave up her career for Nina, puts even more pressure on Nina as she tries to live through her daughter because of her lost career. After her mother's constant checking up on Nina and invasion of her privacy, Nina begins to have violent thoughts towards her mother and subsequently, towards others.

One night, Lily comes to Nina's house and convinces her to let loose, live a little and go out to a bar with Lily. Lily coaxes Nina to drink and take drugs to relax, convincing Nina that the drugs will wear off in a few hours. All of a sudden, Nina is in the men's bathroom having sex against the wall with a stranger. She comes to, runs out of the club with Lily at her heels. They go back to the Nina's house, lock the door against Nina's worried and angry mother, and proceed to have an extremely graphic imho soft core lesbian sex scene. Had I not been watching this movie with a very good friend who I can watch anything with, I would have been embarrassed at the explicit nature of the scene. And I am no prude.

The next day, Nina wakes up late and hungover, rushes to the theater and finds out that Lily is taking her place as Swan Queen in the rehearsal. Nina is furious, confronts Lily as to why she didn't awaken her; Lily explains that she went home with a guy from the club and somehow realizes that Nina fantasized about her, and teases her. Although at that point, I wasn't sure if the sex scene had happened or not.

The morning of the performance's opening night, Nina's mother locks them in her bedroom concerned about Nina's emotional health, and informs Nina that she has called the ballet company to inform them that Nina is sick and will not be able to perform. Nina assaults her mother and once again rushes to the theater to once again find that Thomas has asked Lily to take Nina's place. Nina insists she will be dancing as the Black Swan and goes to her dressing room to prepare.

Nina performs the first act but her hallucinations distract her and she falls. She runs to her dressing room and finds Lily inside dressed as the Black Swan. Nina wrestles with Lily and stabs her in the stomach with a piece of glass from a broken mirror (or does she?). She hides the body and returns for the next act, performing a most amazing Black Swan. She seems to become the black swan and receives a standing ovation. The director is thrilled with her stunning performance and she kisses him passionately before she returns to her dressing room for the final act: the Swan Queen's suicide. Lily enters Nina's room to congratulate her on her performance and Nina is shocked and bewildered. Nina discovers that it was herself that she wrestled with (obviously symbolizing her good size vs her dark side) and her own stomach that she stabbed.

Nina returns to the stage for the final act and dances flawlessly as the White Swan. As she performs the final death scene, Lily realizes Nina is wounded. Unknowingly, the audience applauds loudly and Thomas is thrilled. Nina is blissfully content with her perfect performance, a performance that was made perfect by her ultimate sacrifice.

The movie was superbly acted although Nina's timid mousy character and voice did annoy me greatly. However, this was likely planned as it made for a riveting transformation. The dancing and music was beautiful, the cinematography was great, but the film was somewhat too strange for my liking with the hallucinations and self mutilation. I was thankful that I wasn't watching it with my husband since he would have hated it. And this is definitely not a movie to watch with your kids[...]

In conclusion, this file was very difficult for me to rate and review. But I can say that it is gripping, beautiful, powerful and very disturbing. Black Swan is well worth seeing if you are with a good friend that you can watch this kind of stuff with, as was I.",1302220800,2,6428,4.709964412811388

4245976,2,B0041KKYEM,"This movie was recommended to me by a few friends.  I went into it, figuring skeptically, that hype was surrounding this movie.  I was correct.

The movie is basically about a verge-of-stardom ballet dancer who must cross-over to the dark side so-to-speak in order to capture the full breadth of her role.  It's not hard to see where this would go.  (some spoilers) She goes from being an oh-so-sweet mommy's nice girl to doing drugs and engaging in deviant sexual behavior.

Symbolically, a lot of this is just her growing up, but some of it was her diving in the deep end of insanity to fully be able to embrace her dark side, which was not natural at all to her.  They use Winona Rider as a starlet gone wrong (read as flipped her lid) to illustrate the path she's heading down.  Kunis's character serves as an introduction to moving away from the safe shores of always being nice and perfect and towards a ruthless attitude.  Increasingly, she sees herself as the Black Swan, and falls more and more into that role in her waking life.  Her rash is symbolic of an itch that must be scratched; that is moving towards greater freedom to use her shadow side, culminating with pulling out a black feather, implying she had sprouted the feathers of the black swan.  Also, the end scene I think a lot of people had misinterpreted to be literal, when, again, it's symbolic of her having fully killed off her old sugar, spice, and everything nice self.  Figurative suicide.  Killing Kunis's character was also symbolic of her killing off her need for being shown ""the path"".  She had it at that point.

Natalie Portman's acting, and the acting elsewhere, is decent, but not her best, certainly not oscar-worthy.  It just shows how far movie quality has slid downhill for this to be what's on the pedestal.  Standard tripe and hype.  I was not in the least surprised to find myself not impressed with this movie when all's said and done.",1302220800,6,1931,4.612903225806452

Her dreadful but sophisticated portrayal of Nina made one feel like she's this helpless and vulnerable damsel resistant to any assistance that is being offered to her. The Black Swan absurdly campy and intensely bleak at the same time. If you are a fan of psychological thrillers that bears a great deal of substance. I highly recommend this film.,1302048000,3,538,5.056179775280899
4245980,1,B0041KKYEM,"There's a ""Swan Dive"" comment that encouraged my writing this review.  I was completely uninspired by this film.  Something creative may have been afoot, but by the time the meaning behind the madness is sort of revealed, who cares. I didn't think Natalie Portman did anything whatsoever deserving of an Oscar, unless looking weak, vulnerable and uninterested makes for an Oscar winning performance.  Compare her performance to Colin Firth in ""The King's Speech,"" where you see a weak, vulnerable, uninteresting character become someone of strength and interest.  His performance was one of transformation with believability, while Portman's performance requires a suspension of belief in order to be appreciated.

Maybe I just lack the artistic eye in cinema to recognize a movie masterpiece. But so far, reading all the five star reviews, I've found nothing enlightening about this movie that soundly explains just what the heck was so.............masterful about ""The Black Swan.""Tell me, was it watching how the taxing overdrive and ambition of a perfectionist can trigger  dormant illnesses of the mind? I got that part and still can't understand the path this movie took to get there.

I simply was not moved in any direction by this movie. I wanted to go with the flow, but didn't know which direction the flow was going.  Please will someone clearly tell me what part(s) of this movie moved them and why?  Was it the music, the dancing, the acting, the story, the costumes, the darkness, the Black Swan Theme? I can't believe it was all of these, simply because what I saw looked so loosely connected and unattached. I want to watch this so-called masterpiece again but am in much need of what to look for. I welcome the positive feedback, but I fear that maybe those who crown this movie masterpiece have become angered in having to defend their crown.

4245981,5,B0041KKYEM,"Darren Aronofsky never fails to provoke audiences. From his 1998 film debut, Pi, to his powerful sophomore feature, Requiem for a Dream, it was clear from the start that Aronofsky was a serious filmmaker, willing to take his audiences to places they would rather not go, in order to reveal a specific truth. To this day, his films are extremely cerebral and unflinching. While Black Swan is a change of pace for Aronofsky, it is no less brutal than any of his previous works.

Black Swan is a dark fairy tale and a psychological thriller, as well as a cautionary tale about the pursuit of artistic perfection. Natalie Portman steals the show as Nina Sairs, a young, ambitious dancer at a prestigious academy, who has just been chosen for the dual role of the White and Black Swan in Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. While Nina's virginal innocence lends itself to the role of the White Swan, her instructor, the womanizing Leroy, insists that she will have to ""lose herself"" in order to accurately represent the openly sensual nature of the Black Swan. Suddenly, Nina begins to face corruption at every turn, coupled with what can only be described as a mental unraveling. The line between dreams and reality becomes horrifyingly blurred, as Nina tries to ""find"" her Black Swan.

From the very start of the film, you feel for Nina Sairs. Natalie Portman's portrayal is a perfect balance of navet and blossoming sexuality. Her transformation is heartbreaking and powerful, and by the time the credits roll, you will be speechless. This is Portman's best performance to date, for which she won an Oscar this year.

Black Swan is a film that will swallow you whole. If you are easily offended, you may want to look elsewhere.

Featuring amazing performances from all involved, including Vincent Cassel, Winona Ryder, and Mila Kunis, as well as an incredible Barbara Hershey as Nina's unstable and controlling mother, this is a film that demands to be seen, and is Aronofsky's best film since The Fountain.

Black Swan is 108 minutes, and is rated R for strong sexual content, disturbing violent images, language, and some drug use. Released by Fox Searchlight Pictures. Directed by Darren Aronofsky.",1302048000,5,2188,4.91869918699187

another gripe about this film is: how many times can you possibly watch portman go crazy ? its a one time watch, like most Darren Aronofsky films. he does do terrific work, films that hit close to home. explores the concepts of needs, wants, obsessions and desire as well as any

beautifully done, worth watching but seriously, don't get hopes up too high. Oscar films aren't always necessarily that 4 star film critics rave about

4245986,1,B0041KKYEM,"Hollywood becomes darker and stranger each year. Those who run the major studios often pump out so much horror, sick violence, vulgarity, and psychological deformity that one must wonder about how all this is screwing up the viewers.

 Natalie Portman delivers her all, and for that matter the acting by everyone is far above average. I just wish that the flicks the Hollywood elite love to create and honor were actually honorable. This film is going to appeal to women from 14 to 30 primarily. The chronicling of a mental breakdown of a talented, hopeful, and impressionable ballerina is not good fodder for the viewer's mind or soul.

  Having virtually all the characters around ballerina Nina almost conspire to ruin her psyche, health, and morality is depressing. The psychological instability that results in this neurotic adventure left me depressed. Adding in images of masturbation and lesbianism for the heroine is also inappropriate for our society as a whole, and young people in particular. Hollywood is obsessed with promoting violence, creating new ways to frighten viewers, and promoting homosexuality. I know a lot of people are getting sick of their not so subtle propaganda.

 What a great waste of talent and time for all who were involved in this. In a declining economy and society with worries growing weekly, we don't need this type of negative reinforcement. Movie goers need to boycott the intended disturbing & terror images and stories. Instead paying to see uplifting and spiritually positive flicks is the only way to return Hollywood to it's former glory.

This is the 4th movie I've rented from Amazon VOD and the other ones were definitely HD quality, this did not seem to be HD (wouldn't care if they didn't charge a dollar more, not to mention the fact that I am paying so much for a movie that I only have access to for 48 hours) Lastly, the pausing and other buttons which have worked in the past didn't work so when I had to leave for a minute I missed part of the movie.

4245989,3,B0041KKYEM,"This is definitely a film worth seeing. More for the performances, as this is an actor's and director's showcase. The film is actually quite thin and undercooked from a narrative standpoint. The visuals can be entertaining and there are some incredibly tense moments, but the film is light on suspense or any nuanced emotion. Yes, Natalie Portman's character, Nina, does show a lot in terms of emotion on a broad scale, but it is mainly at one end or the other because it is what the story allows. I think if you watch this film simply expecting entertainment, you will come out with more than you bargained for and you will NOT be disappointed.",1301961600,2,645,4.666666666666667

Film:  4.5/5, Image Quality:  4.5/5, Sound Quality:  4.5/5, Extras:  3.5/5 Overall:  4.5/5 (wounded up in total star ranking)

Quality:
Having been shot partially on 16mm film, this movie will have a large amount of fine film grain, and a dark overall look that may appear gaudy at first glance.  But it is nicely sharp and detailed throughout.  At some parts, the grain clears up and looks perfect in some scenes. Altogether, it's the best possible transfer given the movie's source limitations and artistic intent.  Sound quality sounded great to me, especially regarding the music and sound effects.

Extras include a 49-minute making-of documentary, close to a dozen short featurettes, trailers, and BD-Live and mobile features.

For this film's initial release, it comes with a digital copy and a glossy semi-reflective slipcover.  The cover art appears on both the outside and inside of the case, and could be reversible.  Chances are that future pressings of this movie will omit the slipcover and DC in favor of a single-disc in a plain case.

Film:
Darren Aronofsky has made some of the most remarkable nightmares on film. Whether plunging into the mystique of numerology, the destructive wages of drug abuse, or the woes of a wrestler past his prime, Aronofsky makes films of style and intellect that are topped by very few directors, especially in this day and age. Sure enough, ""Black Swan"" is just as worthy of a film as the director's previous efforts.

I felt the film started off as a typical, mild character-driven drama; lots of ladies dancing, lots of bitter rivalry and stress, but little on conflict, much less style. But toward the second half, the film became totally whack. A few visual hints are dropped in the first half, which will likely make you blink and ask yourself ""did I really see that?!"" In the second half, it becomes substantially more intense, the visuals become extraordinarily trippy and surreal, and all conflict reaches a proper climax. If you stick with it, the film will be engrossing and sublime, with enough emotional punch and food-for-thought to keep you intrigued and entertained. I'd say it's about as rewarding as ""Fight Club.""

The story itself is simple and straightforward; a petty drama involving ballerinas doing a bold new vision of the Swan Lake spiel. As the film goes on, it reaches deeper beneath the surface and pulls up some strong character development and refreshing thematic territory. This is very much a story about perfection, not only in the dancers' performances, but in the sense of duality: the union between light and dark creates a perfect balance that ultimately drives the main character to confront, fight, and ultimately transform herself. Not to mention, there are also some strong themes concerning maturity, lifestyles, sexuality, and ambition. The film also manages to throw in decent helpings of paranoia, and works very effectively to toy around with the audience's sense of understanding what's real in the film and what isn't. In the end, it may not be a terribly grandiose plot, but it does have great depth, and I find the central theme of corruption and duality quite elegant.

As far as the cinematography goes, I was pleased with the photography; there are some bouncy documentary-style cameras, but not nearly as many as I expected. Editing is excellent. Acting is great; Natalie Portman is perfect as Nina and Vincent Cassel is good.  I usually find it hard to take Mila Kunis seriously, but she actually did a great job here. Writing seems good. Production value is high, and contains some awesome costumes and interesting sets. Clint Mansell's use of classical music fits this movie well, and does have a few standout moments.

There are quite a few sex scenes, a few cringe-worthy moments, and a lot of dark surreal imagery, and will likely deter some viewers.  But none of it is overly-graphic or gratuitous at all, and I see little reason not to recommend it to anybody.

4.5/5 (entertainment: 4/5, story: 4.5/5, film: 4.5/5, emotional impact: 3/5)",1301961600,3,4163,4.975468975468975
4245991,1,B0041KKYEM,"While every performance in this movie is superb, the STORY takes MUCH too long to develop forcing you to REALLY focus in order to keep up with what is actually happening. At times you're not sure what's real and what isn't, so you can never grasp what actually happened and what was madness.

I love Natalie Portman. She was very compelling to watch, and did a beautiful job. An under-developed role and an under-used Winona Rider also was disappointing because you had no idea why she was so bitter other than being forced to retire - another ballet cliche. Her mental illness was never developed, so her maniacal outburst is totally surprising and terrifying but a bit confusing. It's only clear at the end, which was very disappointing in that it was a cliche as well.

In addition, the first hour was totally boring. The last half hour or so was TRULY exciting, if not confusing. However, the trailers were the best part of a very dark, confusing, snorable story. Rent it, but don't get sucked into buying it like EYE did.",1301875200,5,1026,4.631868131868132
4245992,5,B0041KKYEM,"Loved this movie!  You have to watch this movie by knowing it's very, very different.  You are watching Nina's life through her eyes.  Nina is a very stressed, mentally ill individual.  From my point of view, and I am not a psychiatrist by no means, I believe Nina is Schizophrenic.  Natalie Portman's character is the correct age for when mental illness shows up in people, and the stress she places upon herself and endures from others around her agitates her illness and brings it to light.

So many storylines show the treatment of mentally ill individuals, as in how those around the mentally ill person view the behaviors but don't show how the mentally ill suffer through their own eyes.  Kudos to the cinematographers, film editors, screenwriter, and director who all worked on this movie.  Fabulous job.",1301875200,3,812,4.875912408759124
4245993,5,B0041KKYEM,"No art criticism here, I'll only say that Black Swan was my favorite film of 2010.  The point of this review is for a technical problem concerning the DVD version I purchased over this last weekend.  I am convinced there was an extended sequence in the theatrical version, that I saw in December (Arclight Hollywood), that is missing from the DVD!  Right after the mirror shard stabbing of her other ""self"", and the first sounds of the ""Black Swan breathing"", there was a sequence where Natalie Portman leaves her dressing room and approaches the stage through a series of hallways, eventually walking right up to her stage entrance, all the while, giving any dancers or crew members who might notice, a sinister, sexy smile from her newly developed confidence.  From there, she takes the stage for the first time as the Black Swan from behind the parting glass partitions and THAT is where the DVD version picks back up.  It is the only missing footage!  It is the only difference from the cut I saw in the theater!

Has anyone else noticed this?",1301875200,2,1047,4.688524590163935
4245994,1,B0041KKYEM,"I bought this Blu-ray DVD without ever having seen the movie. It was nominated for several Oscars, after all, and actually won best actress. And although I had heard it had some freaky supernatural/psychological stuff going on, I am a major ""Swan Lake"" fanatic, so I figured any movie whose plot revolves around a production of that incredible masterpiece had to at least be interesting. WRONG! I agree with just about every other one-star review. First up, the film is BORING. When I glanced at the timer on my Blu-ray player at one point and saw that I was already 40 minutes into it, I was amazed to realize that virtually nothing had happened. Natalie Portman's character is one-dimensional and thoroughly unpleasant, so it's hard to become invested in what she is going through. THIS is supposedly an Oscar-worthy performance? The mother, played by Barbara Hershey, is merely a rip-off of Piper Laurie from ""Carrie,"" which may or may not have been intentional. The film's main device seems to be to keep you guessing whether bizarre, supernatural events are actually occuring, or if we're just taking a brief tour through the mind of a psychotic. I realize that to today's post-literate world of teenage moviegoers, being confusing or obscure passes as art (""Memento"" and ""Inception"" leap to mind), but it isn't. I've participated in conversations of people who have seen this film and were trying to reach a consensus as to what was actually happening in the film, but no one seems to be sure. More to the point, by the end of the film, you really don't care anymore. As for this film giving any insight whatsoever into Tchaikovsky's ballet masterpiece, forget it. The Black Swan and White Swan are always danced by the same dancer; it is not some unusual tour-de-force to do both roles. The Black Swan (whose name, never mentioned in the film, is Odile) is NOT the ""evil twin"" of the White Swan (Odette); she is the evil magician's daughter who has been enchanted to look exactly like Odette so as to confuse the prince and foil his love for the White Swan, the love that could have saved her. She is not supposed to burst onto the scene like a snarling nympho on crack; the trick in dancing the Black Swan is to come across ALMOST exactly like the White Swan but with just enough of a patina of evil to let the audience know she isn't the same person without being so obvious as to tip off the prince. But sutlety apparently has as much of a place in today's moviemaking as good writing and acting. Give the audience a few eye-popping visual effects, and to hell with the drama. However, this movie was educational in a different way: I have learned never to buy a DVD of a film I haven't already seen.",1301875200,38,2710,4.636174636174636

I knew the movie had won a lot of awards but I had also heard it was a huge lesbian fest, which is ok, but I just wasn't sure what I was going to be watching. This movie was better than I could have imagined and I will definitely be buying the dvd for my collection. I loved how the movie had a bit of an indy feel, like how the camera would follow behind her in scenes, like documentary style....but it still kept a main stream quality that was easy to enjoy. The story line was great from her ballet career, odd relationship with her mother, and intense pressures of her new role as Swan Queen. They called this a psycological thriller and it lived up to the title! Most movies are easy to predict but this one kept me guessing till the end. There are some sexual tones throughout the movie but it made the movie sexy and a little dangerous feeling, it was exhilirating. The final dance at the end....WOW!!! I actually gave a standing ovation in my own living room. lol. Rent it, rent it, rent it....  :)",1301875200,,1091,4.195238095238095
4245996,3,B0041KKYEM,"The incredible amount of hype about this movie means that most of us will inevitably see it just to see what's going on and that's exactly why I did.
  To simplify the movie is very average and even a bit boring. I've heard the view that if you don't like it you don't get it, but I far from agree. It's nearly impossible not to get it and that's the real problem, it's so heavy handed and obvious that your exhausted from being beat over the head with the obvious symbolism, which is one of the two major flaws this movie has along with it's ability to bore you for stretches.
  Natalie Portman is very good, and I enjoyed Mila Kunis as well, acting is definitely not the problem here which is why I gave it 3 stars. This is obviously a film aimed more towards woman, VERY obvious and don't let anyone tell you different even the scenes of sexuality seemed to be aimed towards a woman's sensibilities so in the end I suppose it wasn't meant for me.
  To bottom line it for you the symbolism of the Swan Queen (Black swan/White swan) and the story that is being told would have benefited from the saying less is more, it was way too obvious what the movie was trying to say and leading to in the end. The movie was very boring for stretches and seemed to be aimed at women to the exclusion of men completely right down to the fact that there is only one male character in the movie and his role is also obvious. Lastly the acting was very good, and I wouldn't expect less from Ms Portman or Mila Kunis. If you plan on seeing it don't go in with high expectations or you will be sorely disappointed.",1301875200,3,1598,4.222950819672131
4245997,5,B0041KKYEM,"First of all, Natalie Portman deserves every acting award possible for her work in this film.  You could tell in the first five minutes that she completely immersed herself in this role, and this world.  Literally, one of the best performances by an actress I have ever seen.  Right up there with Meryl Streep in Sophie's Choice, and Charlize Theron in Monster.  A great actress will make you forget you are watching a movie, and she surely does that, and more.

I heard on the radio the other day that her ballet-double in the movie is saying that she did most of the work, and that Natalie didn't deserve her Oscar.  I have so many problems with that.  It really makes me furious.  What kind of person would try to ruin someone else's biggest accomplishment?  Obviously, jealousy is at work here.  Apparently, and I had no idea about this, an actress must appear in at least 80% of her role in order to win.  I'm usually very good at spotting body-doubles in TV and movies, and I could not see even one instance that didn't look like her.  I know they must have had a double that looks like Natalie, but I would be surprised if Natalie didn't perform at least 80% of the role.  And, even if someone else did every bit of dancing, the brilliance is in the acting and the emotions, not the dancing (although that is a factor).

Anyway, this is the kind of movie that stays with you, long after the ending credits.  I would compare it to another movie with a similar premise, ""The Machinist"", starring Christian Bale (another brilliant performance, and you need to see it, if you haven't already).  You will be trying to figure out what really happened for days.  And you definitely will want to watch it again.  I wanted to watch it again as soon as it was over!  It's that good.",1301875200,,1779,4.452012383900929
4245998,5,B0041KKYEM,"I've been an Aronofsky fan since I first saw PI, so this review comes from an admittedly biased source.  Still, I think anyone seeing this film can't help but be drawn into its dark story line, strong characters, and exceptional performances.  The special effects, although minimal by Aranofsky standards, were seamless and never over the top.  Portman , as the emotionally stunted, aspiring prima ballerina, displays a remarkably broad emotional pallete. From the insecure, self abusing scratcher, to the fantasizing bisexual temptress, and finally to the near-psycopathic surreal dance queen, Portman never disappoints.  If her dancing wasn't perfect (or not even her own, is irrelevant .. its a movie, not real life!), it was certainly good enough to maintain the illusion.  Vincent Cassel was both creepy and believable as the head of the ballet.  Mila Kunis' hedonistic portrayal as the quintessential black swan and corrupting influence on Nina completely made me forget about her sickly sweet ""That Seventies Show"" work.  She was hot, sexy, and believable.  Barbara Hershey turned in a good performance as the doting mother, although it was probably the weakest performance of the principles.  The downward spiral of Nena was nearly as good as Burstyn's in ""Requiem"".  Aranofsky seems to have a way of capturing emotional collapse better than anyone.",1301875200,3,1357,5.328638497652582

I have always been a fan of All About Eve and have thought that this movie could easily be filmed as a horror movie.  The Black Swam does this by combining the major elements of that film with Poe's doppleganger story William Wilson where a man deals with his double with tragic results.

Excellent photography, good acting all around make for a fun viewing experience.  Do NOT expect The Red Shoes or The Turning Point...this is horror genre movie making at its best............and again, the music is magnificent!",1301788800,2,759,5.0
4246001,3,B0041KKYEM,"I write this review as someone who does not have any bias for or against the director or the performers; I vaguely remember Natalie Portman from Star Wars and Mila Kunis' voice rings a bell--Meg on Family Guy. I don't know Aronofski or his work from Adam.

I was excited by the premise, and by an interview with Aronofski saying he had an ""Aha!"" moment at the ballet about basing the story of ""The Double"" in the ballet world. So much potential!

Natalie Portman's performance as Nina, an obsessive-compulsive dancer who cracks under heavy pressure from getting her first leading role in Swan Lake--was exquisite! I was also impressed with her dancing..not bad for 6 months' training.*Loved* her in this movie.

Barbara Hershey's character (Nina's mother) was slaughtered by the editing, which is a shame; you really want to know what deep effects her mother, a frustrated former ballerina, had on Nina. You get a snippet or two of her, not enough for the story line.

Ditto Mila Kunis' character as Lily; you get a sort of cartoon depiction of a bad girl, but no depth. Where was the sense of competition with Nina, the looming threat to her of another favored dancer, the director playing the two off against one another? Probably on the (figurative)cutting room floor.

Ditto the dance director, played flawlessly by Vincent Cassel, but again--no connection to Nina's madness other than one snarky remark to Nina, comparing her unfavorably to Kunis. Cassel *was* the perfect dance director, you can see it in his characterization--but not enough of him in the story.

Winona Ryder as the aging star ballerina that Nina replaces--wow, so much could have been done with that! Deleted scenes show what was originally there; Nina's
obsession with Ryder before she replaced her, Nina stealing little personal objects from her dressing table and secretly watching her and following her around.

To sum it all up--I very much enjoyed all of the actors' work and wanted to see more of all of them in this movie, but heavy-handed editing cut out most of the story line and left us with mostly sex scenes and special effects. Yes, fantastic effects, but where's the story? If you aren't familiar with the story of Swan Lake or The Double, you're out of luck.

I'd like to see the director's cut of this movie. I can't give it a really bad review because I'm hoping that somewhere out there exists a copy of this movie as the director and the actors intended it to be, without time restraints or clumsy editing.",1301788800,8,2503,4.791183294663573

Turns out this is NOT a smart movie, it's more like a porn star getting all the buzz for acting that I didn't really see.  During the whole movie, I either saw a scared, self absorbed snobb or a possesed idiot.  Natalie P hardly had any lines in the movie,it could have taken a couple of hours to learn her lines, seriously, this is what they call acting?  Nothing about this was brilliant, it really bothers me how all these critics end up giving so much buzz and making me waste 2 hours of my life.  I should not have paid for this either.  Honestly, I believe all the praises this movie got was for all the sex scenes and the girl on girl action(which I could care less about that).  Too bad there's not negative stars on the rating system, this is the worst movie I've seen in years!  If you want something smart, don't waste your time on this.",1301788800,20,1032,4.278350515463917
4246003,2,B0041KKYEM,"Black Swan has surreal qualities going for it, the kind of elements found in Bunel and Losey. Very quickly,however, the film dips into the obvious, and, here,a very thin consdieration of good vs evil takes over in an MTV manner. Stock mother vs. daughter scenes,tired out lesbian scenes,and other sexual disorientations, and a finale that is patently obvious and boring.

Portman is alright, but for her to win and Academy Award over Ms. Annette Benning or Ms. Nicole Kidman is outrageous,but not as bad as those no talent people from the really terrible film, The Fighter. Also consider Rese Witherspoon, Halle Berry, Julia Roberts etc etc. nothing new.

Ms. Portman accepted her award with humility, and she needed to. But later on, in her interviews with the press, she described the ending of Black Swan as a development of the ballerina into maturity, leaving the old life behind.

Did she see the film I saw? But here again, Portman herself perhaps(I cannot say) sensed the deep -at -the surface artiface of the ""project"", and inadvertantly(again perhaps) exposed it in her inattention to the role she played right up to the conclusion,even to the point where she made her incredible interpretation of the ending public.

I just finished watching the Black Swan. I am not laughing. I am sitting at my computer, trying not to shake. This is the single most disturbing film I have ever seen. This is the first time I ever recall jumping out of my chair while watching a movie.

I can see how many people would walk away shrugging. It's slow building drama, and not really a horror movie despite what my previous statements would imply. That said, I'm not sure I could EVER watch this movie in the dark. I've seen it, I know what happens but let's face it, I was still shaking when I started writing this review.

The movie is, to put it bluntly, beautiful. I'm not a big fan of ballet, but I've seen performances before and this movie captures everything that is good about ballet. The scenes are amazingly choreographed, both scenes on the stage and off. (Pay attention to the music while watching the film. Everything is practically a dance. I also know enough about music to be bracing myself after a while, you can time the disturbing actions to the soundtrack and that makes it worse rather than better.)

I honestly am at a loss for words. I want to review the film, but my mind just seems to rebel. I feel the movie is borderline perfect, yet, I don't think I know if anyone else would feel that way. I'm not even sure if it would disturb anyone else... I don't even really know why I'm disturbed, but this movie has REALLY got to me.

In the meantime, Natalie Portman collected a truckload of awards for her searing portrayal of Nina Sayers, a talented ballerina whose mental state declines as pressure mounts around her starring performance in a new staging of Tchaikovsky's ""Swan Lake"" by a prestigious New York City ballet company. She is quite good, although I am less relatively enamored by the film itself, especially toward the end, which beyond recalling Aronofsky's earlier work, 2000's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Requiem-for-a-Dream/dp/B00005Q4CS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Requiem for a Dream</a>, comes across as an intensely kinetic albeit derivative hybrid of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Red-Shoes/dp/B003ICZW8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Red Shoes</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carrie/dp/B00005K3NR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carrie</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Single-White-Female/dp/0767802616/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Single White Female</a>.

Co-written by Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz, and John J. McLaughlin, the screenplay melds Nina's reality, dreams, and hallucinations into quite a ripe melodrama. Nina has long dreamed about playing the lead in ""Swan Lake"", and her fantasy comes true in a moment of pure bliss before her descent into madness. The ballet troupe's manipulative director Thomas Leroy picks Nina to replace aging prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre to play the Swan Queen, which is two roles in one - Odette, the virginal White Swan awaiting a kiss from the Prince, and her heartless twin, Odile, the sexually predatory Black Swan who lures the prince away. Leroy knows Nina is fully capable of playing the former but remains unconvinced she could exude the sensuality needed to play the latter. While she has trained her whole life for this opportunity, she remains an insecure, emotionally bruised woman still living with her overbearing mother Erica, a former ballerina who never reached the rarefied heights her daughter is about to enter.

Complicating matters is Lily, a new arrival to the company from San Francisco and as liberated a free spirit as Nina is sexually repressed. Meanwhile, as Nina performs to the demands of the role, she crumbles in hidden ways that have her start imagining herself transforming into a swan. Present in almost every frame of the film, Portman is terrific conveying Nina's tentative nature in a way that makes her dedicated training all the more haunting for the sacrifices she makes to achieve her goal of artistic perfection. Within the confines of his predictable role, Vincent Cassel is malevolent enough as the autocratic Leroy, and Barbara Hershey really excels in her few scenes as Erica, showing why Nina's self-esteem has become practically nil. With her haughty manner and skeletal frame, Winona Ryder has more of an extended cameo as Beth, but she makes her fatalistic sense palpable. As Lily, Mila Kunis is almost effortless as Nina's saucy, distrustful competitor.

Compounded by Matthew Labatique's constantly moving camera, Aronofsky's florid direction works on an almost surreal level for about the first three-quarters of the film's 108-minute running time, but his lurid horror-film approach gets excessive toward the end when Nina's confusion between reality and fantasy signals an inability to deal with the life she thought she wanted. The 2011 DVD/BluRay offers an extensive, 49-minute making-of documentary, ""Black Swan Metamorphosis"" which includes on-set footage and interviews with cast and crew.

4246009,5,B0041KKYEM,"Swan Lake is one of my favorite ballets, so when they started running trailers for this movie, I knew I had to see it. I read the reviews so I was somewhat aware of what I was getting into when I went to see the movie. I wasn't a big fan of Portman before seeing this movie, but her roll in Black Swan allowed me to see a different side of her. Knowing the kind of rolls she usually portrays, this part was fitting yet a step outside of the norm as you watch her character begin to detach from reality and descend into insanity.

Barbara Hershey is the ballet mother from hell as she slowly loses her control over her once shy, demure and obedient daughter. Mila Kunis' roll is a free spirit who inadvertely aids Nina (Portman) in her spiral into insanity. Vincent Cassel plays the artistic director you want to hate as he encourages Nina to get in touch with her sexuality and lose herself. There is nothing but off the chart acting in this movie. Black Swan pitches back and forth between reality and madness, leaving one wondering what's real and what's not. And that's exactly where Nina is, as she taps into a side of her psyche to play the roll of her life: the White swan... and the Black swan; good versus evil. Innocence and purity versus temptation and seduction.",1301702400,3,1273,4.3940677966101696
4246010,5,B0041KKYEM,"I have a rather unconventional interpretation of Black Swan, and it is a similar interpretation that makes Darren Aronofsky's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fountain-Blu-ray/dp/B000O7667K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fountain [Blu-ray</a>] one of my favorite movies of all time. Darren Aronofsky is the only director that I know of to date that has succeeded in depicting the internal dialogue and development of the subconscious, visually, on screen; events that straddles between imagination and reality. The audience is shown a vantage point that does not wholly exist but is rather how the mind reacts to reality. Most of the events that happen on screen are not what the protagonist sees, but how to protagonist feels. While The Fountain focuses on Hugh Jackman's mental struggle to overcome the death of his wife (i.e. he does not really travel through time), Natalie Portman's character Nina does not really go crazy, or schizophrenic, in Black Swan; rather, the audience is taken through the psychological transformation of the white swan into the black swan that takes place within Nina's subconscious. The movie is, therefore, about a brilliant ballerina and method actress and the triggers that developed her from being pure and sheltered into the jealous, maniacal, but emotionally powerful character she was by the end of the film. And in the end she exclaims that this is her best performance ever. Sort of like an actor that transforms into the role he plays, we see Nina finally arrive at the state of mind that allows her to play the black swan, unrestrained, and with flawless execution. We can say that the whole movie was Nina's mental journey during the final act, similar to how the only events that we can be sure happened in The Fountain was Rachel Weisz dying and Hugh Jackman burying the seed in front of her grave, before walking off.",1301616000,2,1911,5.33112582781457

However, for all its visual bravura, ""Black Swan"" (2010) has little resonance. The predictable screenplay is derivative of superior films such as ""The Red Shoes,"" ""All About Eve"" and Aronofsky's own ""The Wrestler."" A fine supporting cast (Vincent Cassel, Mila Kunis and Barbara Hershey) and Portman's intensity sustain your interest, yet this balletic nightmare remains decidedly overrated.",1301616000,7,503,6.304347826086956
4246012,5,B0041KKYEM,"How far would you go to be perfect?  After her lifelong dream of being the lead in a ballet, Nina (Portman) finally gets her chance.  Pushing herself as hard as she can, she becomes so absorbed in the role it changes her life.  This is a difficult movie to review without giving too much away.  I can say that this is not your typical ballet movie.  This is the same director of ""Requiem For A Dream"" and that should tell you what type of film this is.  I would call this a borderline horror movie, and there are equal parts sex and blood as there is dancing.  Lily (Kunis) plays the Yin to Nina's Yang and the movie is better because of the two sides coming together.  The director did the near impossible with this movie, a ballet movie that guys will really enjoy.  I honestly can't say enough good things about this movie, or the the performances.  Portman deservedly won the oscar, and the fact that Kunis was snubbed in a big injustice.  If you don't want to watch this because of the ballet, keep in mind that it is only a part of the movie.  It is more of a trippy thriller than anything, a very good and well done movie.  You will not be dissapointed.  I give it an A.

I recongized Jungian and archetypal themes from the start, which is appropriate given that Swan Lake is based upon a fairy tale, which in and of itself is archetypal. The lead character, Nina, is an extreme example of the psyche which is not fully integrated. ""Lily"" represents her shadow, the part of herself that is lustful and uninhibited,and ambitious. The film exploits this in obvious ways: Lilly is always in dark clothing, Nina in white, and Nina often sees her own face when she sees Lilly. ""Thomas"" is her animus, awakening her to the greater talent within herself, trying to help her reach full potential, forcing her to face the dark forces within herself.

How far must an artist go to actualize perfection in his work? When must a parent acknowledge an adult child's autonomy and independence? Are exploitation, manipulation, and sexual abuse good tools for a teacher to encourage artistic talent's maturation to its fullest potential? Where exists the ultra-thin boundary separating eccentric genius from psychotic workaholic and when has an artist crossed it? If an actor sinks too deep ""into character,"" how does s/he escape?

I didn't enjoy ""Black Swan."" It's not that I don't comprehend the significant themes visited in the film. It's not I don't appreciate the film's good points (nice music and cinematography, pretty good costumes and sets, great casting.) It's not that I lack analytical ability or intellectual refinement. I watched ""Black Swan"" twice and took a day to consider what I liked and disliked about the film and it ultimately boiled down to the mediocre storyline, poor writing (especially dialogue) and the excessive pornographic content disguised as ""art"" in the movie.

What I Really Liked:

1) The ballet performances were lovely, not earth-shattering, but very well acted. The backlash concerning Portman's dance is ridiculous. Portman is a film star who trained for a year so she wouldn't make a fool of herself portraying a prima ballerina. She achieved that. She isn't the next Gelsey Kirkland, don't expect the polished precision of a world-class professional ballerina who's done the same work for years. Portman and Kunis dance competently and both actresses interject beautiful emotion and physical acting into their admittedly brief dance scenes. I would've liked seeing more ballet performed in the film with or without the actresses. The film's opening scene really captured me and I enjoyed the final performance. I simply wanted to see more of it. There are some interesting special effects I felt neither enhanced nor detracted from the dance.

2) I found the soundtrack compelling, charming, and eerily beautiful. I believe Peter Tcaikovsky, a very innovative composer in his own day, would be enchanted by Clint Mansell's compositions reimagining his work. At times familiar, in other places creepily original, the soundtrack helps carry this film.

3) Costumes, sets, and lighting: almost always, these elements were carefully neutral which forced viewers' attention onto the actors and actresses (physical action, body language, and spoken dialogue.) The cast's clothing and accessories seemed color coordinated to identify the darker characters and the lighter ones. Lily always wears black or charcoal. Nina wears lots of white and girly pale pink.

4) Casting: the talent was very good and well-suited to their respective roles. Natalie Portman's character, Nina, carries most of the work and Portman did a fine job. Whatever my opinion of the movie, I applaud Portman's hard work in interpreting a complicated role. Dance involves acting and Portman portrayed a dancer portraying a character to whom the dancer could not relate. Portman earned her Oscar.

Supporting actress Mila Kunis's Lily provided an excellent foil to Nina. Barbara Hershey (Nina's controlling mother) makes the most of the material she's given and does surprisingly well. I wasn't never fully convinced what Mom's motives were. On the one hand, she came across as frighteningly intrusive and controlling. At the same time, I think the script hinted Mom's awareness of and concern for her daughter's fragile mental state. She seemed to want Nina to succeed, but also protect her from success.

Winona Ryder makes waves as drama queen Beth McIntyre, the company's former prima ballerina who's not handling her pending retirement gracefully. For the pittance of screen time she has, Ryder knows how to draw attention to herself.

Finally, Vincent Cassel portrays Thomas Leroy, the most thankless role in the film, a stereotypical, Eurotrash ballet director and unapologetic sexual predator eager to take advantage of a newer, younger prima ballerina now that Beth's retiring. This guy is smarmy, gross, and prone to coaching his principles during rehearsal with helpful comments like, ""David, can I ask you? Honestly, would you f*(k that girl? ... Nina, your dancing is just as frigid ... "" I literally gagged when he informed Nina, ""I'll be the prince"" as he took over the male lead so he could grope and fondle Nina in order to inspire the ""passion"" Nina lacks to channel the Black Swan. Cassel's a very good villain. I would let this slime work with my daughter when elephants roost in trees.

What I Really Disliked:

1) The ambiguous storyline reaches ""fiction that doesn't make sense"" mode. Ambiguity is a natural result of Nina's unreliable perspective, but too much is never resolved. ""Black Swan"" could easily be one of those films or shows where the protagonist wakes up and realizes s/he was only dreaming, daydreaming, in a coma, hallucinating due to illness/injury from which s/he has recovered, etc.. Those scenarios, even when well done, always leave me feeling a bit ripped off.

2) Unlikeable Characters: I don't like a single personality in this film. These are not flawed, relatable human people, these are unlikeable, unpleasant human people with every wart on show. Even the bit characters behave abominably (i.e., Veronica cursing out Nina and accusing her of ""making sick jokes"" after Nina, misled by LeRoy, congratulates the dancer on her successful audition for the Swan Queen.)

Most of the characters are shockingly amoral. Drug abuse, one night stands, suicide and/or attempted suicide, and self-mutilation are all on the menu. Nina also vomits frequently; it's unclear if she is bulimic or if her vomiting is symptomatic of other problems.

Every character lacked depth, including Nina. One thing that struck me during my second viewing is that I never got the impression Nina really loved ballet. That disturbed me the more I considered it. I mean, the entire point of the movie is Nina's struggle for knowledge/experience to do her role justice. She didn't seem to love dance, or even like it much. Obsession isn't necessarily love. Nina's loveless obsession with dance would have bothered me less had the film shown us what or who Nina DID love or care about.

What I can't Stand:

1) The dialogue is awful. Just awful. There is nothing natural, flowing, or normal in how people speak to each other in this film.

2) ""Black Swan"" contains heavy sexual content, most of it a gratuitous distraction from the main plot (or maybe it's intended to distract viewers from the plot's flimsiness and help fill in film time.) I admit I'm usually turned off by too much nudity or sex in a movie, and this was just ridiculous. Even more ridiculous is the possibility these experiences are actually Nina's hallucinations. Make no mistake, this movie is pornographic. This isn't erotic content, the sexual excesses do not court an emotional response in the viewer, nor are the scenes titillating.

How much sex is in this film? Shenanigans start about 50 minutes into the film and continue almost to the end.

A) Leroy forces himself upon Nina during a rehearsal session, kissing and groping her ... then leaving her high and dry and terming his behavior ""me seducing you, but it needs to be the other way around."" What planet is Leroy (or the writer who created Leroy) from? Seriously, Nina is not the only one in need of regular contact with a qualified mental health care professional. Leroy isn't sexy or seductive, he's gross.

B) Nina masturbates several times. Each masturbatory ""session"" involves a bizarre ""payoff."" In one situation Nina is deeply ""into"" it and discovers her mother sound asleep in a chair alongside her bed. While dozing and masturbating in the bathtub, Nina hallucinates Lily spitting or dropping blood on her (sounds real sexy, huh? NOT!)

C) On a train, Nina is victimized by ANOTHER pervy old guy (I guess Leroy's perviness isn't sufficient.) Her fellow passenger blows kisses at her and fondles his crotch while she struggles to look away and pretend nothing is happening. Apparently, phoning the authorities isn't an option.

D) Nina and Lily sexuality -- just plain gratuitous and in poor taste. Yes, I know a dozen people are gonna chime in, ""But it's so meaningful! It demonstrates Nina's desperation to free herself of her white swan persona and seek relief from her mother's intrusive, domineering control."" I found it disruptive and irrelevant. Lily is an obvious ""frenemy"" to Nina and a completely unbelieveable character (frequently late to rehearsals, living a busy night life, sexually promiscuous, a substance abuser) NOTE: Nina also fantasizes Lily smothers her with an accent pillow after orally pleasuring her, but no reviewers are complaining THAT portion of her ""escapist fantasy"" wasn't depicted in greater detail. Hardy har har.

E) Nina hallucinates Lily having sex with another dancer, costumed as Von Rothbart, in the studio.

Yes, folks, this passes for Oscar nominee material in the 21st century. Maybe if the creators axed some of the porn and wrote in a bit more story, this film might have actually gone somewhere.

I'd rate ""Black Swan"" 3 stars for the talent, music, and the cinematography if the film revealed a worthwhile, engaging story.  The purpose of film is to entertain, and this film does not do that.  One star is the best rating I can offer BS due to its failings as an engaging storytelling vehicle.",1301443200,123,9683,5.119138149556401

The movie is a disturbing chronicling of a woman's decent into madness under the pressure of being the Swan Queen. Daron Aronofsky achieves this amazingly well, with an increasing amount of visual effects distorting the reality of Natalie Portman's character. It reaches a point where the viewer can't take anything they see at face value, while always maintaining an entertaining movie. There's also some great scenes for the male viewers, where Natalie first masturbates (artfully of course) and later has sex with her co-star Mila Kunis. Ultimately, if you don't mind viewing a very disturbed beautiful masterpiece of a movie, then you have to see this.

I really don't see how this movie won any awards.  There was nothing magnificent, astounding, intriguing, enthralling, captivating or anything about this movie.

I'm generally easily amused and don't mind wasting an hour and half or so watching a dumb movie, but this was like torture having to watch.  I couldn't bear through it all and fell asleep only to wake up at one sexy scene of Mila eating out Natalie.  I'm glad to have caught that part, but other than that there's nothing really worth while in this near 2 hour feature presentation of Aronofsky's more dreadful releases.  I'm going to watch Pi and Requiem for a Dream to cleanse myself and remind myself that Darren does have some talent as a director.

I'm a huge fan of Darren Aronofsky, I love every single one of his movies, this one takes they cake. it's dark, psycotic, and sexual.

Leave it to the director and writers to come up with something bizarre yet very memorable and mesmerizing to watch.

Natalie Portman gives the physical and emotional performance of a lifetime as the bulimic dancer who wants to be perfect but will pay a terrible price for it.  Mila Kunis is fascinating as a rival dancer for whom Nina has an attraction (if you don't want to see girl on girl action, just fast forward a bit), while Barbara Hershey is in full form as Nina's pushy, infantilizing mother.

4246027,4,B0041KKYEM,"Darren Aronofsky's BLACK SWAN isn't an original film.  Its premise--a young woman experiencing a breakdown amid potentially supernatural occurrences--is a staple of the horror genre.  This is, however, Aronofsky's take on such a film, his personal stamp on a certain style (much as he did with the superior film THE WRESTLER and the sports genre in general).

BLACK SWAN follows a ballerina's embrace of ""Swan Lake.""  Nina Sayers has the White Swan role down pat; but she has never really let loose enough to take on the role of the Black Swan.  Thus, her understudy, Lily, comes into the picture.  But the relationship between the two is complicated: part friendship, part rivalry, part sexual attraction, and the tension escalates into a breathtaking finale that is predictable but nevertheless stunning.

Natalie Portman easily deserves her Oscar; her performance is on-pitch and captivating.  Mila Kunis, who has never truly overwhelmed in a serious role, is surprisingly adept here; she manages to be seductive, charming, and scary, all in one scene.  Winona Ryder, as the ""older"" ballerina Portman is replacing, is equally chilling, as is Vincent Cassel as the stereotypical demanding boss (though his performance is anything but cliched).  Barbara Hershey is a surprise delight as Nina's caring-possibly-psychotic mother.

The script is a little flat, which is intentional; this film is as much an homage as it is a stand-alone piece.  Aronofsky isn't aiming for the skies, and that is what makes BLACK SWAN so compelling: it's a small slice of insanity, with some truly disturbing scenes and some fantastic performances.  If it isn't the best expression of Aronofsky's artistic vision, it certainly deserves status as a ""personal favorite"" among his fans; either way, it is an above-par psychological thriller that deserves most of the praise that has been heaped upon it.",1301270400,13,1880,5.247491638795987

Now I remember. The director has done an amazing job of balancing over-wrought crap so that the audience will play along with his homage.

Interestingly, the people who patiently explain to us morons that the dancer was breaking down psychologically because of yada yada, uh, the pressure she put on herself and because her mother was a) nuts b) smothering (take your pick) don't seem to get that maybe the mother was neither.

4246033,1,B0041KKYEM,"Many theater-goers and critics have stated that those who do not enjoy ""Black Swan"" must not have understood what the film was about.  It seems to be the same argument used for those who did not like ""Inception"".  ""If you did not like it, you must have missed the point entirely, you stupid person, you!""  Well, excuse me for using my brain and questioning the logic and mediocre writing that is passing itself off as creativity.  ""Black Swan"" is, without a doubt, the most ridiculous and over-the-top tripe I have ever witnessed.  This film may be somewhat enjoyable after having consumed an entire sheet of acid, but being sober and of sound mind is not the way to go.  The opening sequence of the film was promising, Portman dancing onstage with a man dressed in black, covered in feathers.  The man morphs into a black swan creature as he spins around and the music swells and we are sucked into the freakshow that is to follow.  Portman is a woman who lives at home with her outlandish stage mom, played by Barbara Hershey, who is in the running for worst mother ever.  Hold onto your eyebrows, Joan Crawford, there's a new sherriff in town!  Hershey is certainly a postermother for Munchausen by proxy syndrome.  Her mother dotes on her and, after noticing strange scratches on Portman's back, clips her nails with a feverish intensity.  No nail clippers here, we use scissors!  I half expected to see Faye Dunaway stride in and pull all of her clothes out of the closet, seeking out those pesky wire hangers.  Portman's professional life isn't going so well, either.  The company she performs for is doing a re-imagining of ""Swan Lake"" and she wants the lead of the ""Swan Queen"".  The only way to get the part, it seems, is to do a little tonsil hockey with the man who runs the ballet company.  He only gives the leads to those who are willing to put out.  He has an issue with her going after the part, considering she has an inability to tap into her dark side.  Portman must forego her virginal ways and become a crazed, semi-lesbian in order to better understand what it is to be the ""black swan"".  Mila Kunis is there to usher her through that phase.  She is the Gina Gershon to Portman's Elizabeth Berkley.  We spend most of the film wondering if things are really happening, or if it is just an occurence in Portman's shattered psyche.  There are so many problems with this film, the praises it is receiving is astounding.  Portman is shrill and over-the-top throughout, Kunis serves as nothing more than sex on legs and Hershey is laughable.  So much of this film is laughable.  At one point, Winona Ryder stabs herself in the face, multiple times, with a nail file.  I know how you feel, Winona.  The most absurd section of the film comes at the end.  After having it out with Kunis in the dressing room and stabbing her in the stomach, Portman stashes the body away and rushes to the stage.  THE SHOW MUST GO ON!  After finishing her scene on stage, she rushes back to the dressing room only to discover that there is NO BODY!  She is absolutely terrified and confused, but she has to go back on stage to perform the final scene.  While she dances, she notices Kunis is dancing on stage with everyone else.  Perhaps everything that has happened was in her mind!  Perhaps if Portman were to look into a mirror, Tyler Durden would be there with a bar of soap.  She does the final dance and ""kills herself"" by leaping off of a ramp onto a mattress.  As the company gathers around her, congratulating her on a job well done, everyone notices that she is bleeding out from her abdomen.  So she actually stabbed herself, NOT Kunis?  Puh-lease.  She danced for the last part of the film with a piece of shattered mirror embedded in her abdomen?!  I realize that most films rely on a leap of faith from its viewers, but I would rather take a swan dive from the tallest building than see this s#!t again.",1301097600,95,3913,4.509246088193456
4246034,3,B0041KKYEM,"Nobody can deny that Darren Aranofsky can use the camera, but in Black Swan, he substitutes shock and style for substance.  Using a narrative framework that is as old as the movies itself (backstage melodrama) and cliche characters in thinly-veiled pseudo-Freudian roles (the self-doubting ingenue, the dictatorial stage mother, the worldly free-spirit), Aranofsky uses the camera not to disclose but to shock with David Lynch-like surrealism and suspense more derivative of Brian De Palma than Alfred Hitchcock.  Natalie Portman's physical preparation for her role was heroic, but her performance is unidimensional (insecure anxiety). Aranofsky has done some brilliant work before (Requiem for a Dream, most notably), but this lacks depth and subtlety. To paraphrase a former senator, ""I know David Lynch films.

4246042,5,B0041KKYEM,"Critically-acclaimed horror films are a rare sight. Rarer still when they star a 95 lb ballerina. Darren Aronofsky's newest film, Black Swan, could be seen as a companion piece of sorts to The Wrestler. Both films center on individuals whose single-minded pursuit of their professions could be termed noble, maddening, and ultimately tragic. Where The Wrestler starred a 230 lb rock of a man, however, Black Swan gives us someone much different, and ultimately even more distressing; that would be the innocent and naive Nina, played with surprising fearlessness by Natalie Portman.

Nina is a ballerina, one of a bevy of dancers in a New York City company lorded over by the brilliantly egocentric director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel in a riveting performance). The next ballet is to be Swan Lake and Nina is picked to be the company's next prima ballerina. Thomas knows that Nina has the technical skill needed to portray the White Swan, but openly questions whether she possesses the sexuality and passion to master the role of the Black Swan. We follow Nina as she prepares for the role, navigating her unstable mother (a disturbingly brilliant Barbara Hershey) and a new arrival to the company (the lively Mila Kunis), a fellow ballerina whose raw sexuality and unbridled passion pose a direct threat to Nina's ascendancy. All of this builds to a head in the film's final 40 minutes, which stands as one of the most intense movie finales in recent memory. To say any more about the film's plot would be a great disservice; suffice to say that it's doubtful you will ever look at clipping fingernails the same way again.

Aronofsky has long been known as a director whose principals display a madness of some sort, whether it be the heroin addicts of Requiem for a Dream or the mathematician of Pi. As Portman's Nina descends down these same narrow steps, so too does the film itself. Over 300 effects shots were employed in Black Swan, often to harrowing effect. The result is a surreal and dark world in which both Nina and the audience are never quite sure what is real and what is illusory. Featuring absolutely breathtaking cinematography by Matthew Libatique, the film is a visual treat the likes of which we haven't seen in theaters all year. The overarching story structure of the film is admittedly pretty conventional, however Aronofsky's committed direction and a bevy of knockout performances combine to elevate the material to near-classic status.

Portman has never been better and the ferocity with which she tackles the role is stunning. The power of her performance ensures that her tiny frame looms large over the entirety of the film; indeed, she appears in every scene. It is a demanding and difficult role and Portman knocks it out of the park; anything less than the Best Actress statue would be a crime. Not to be outdone, both Cassel and Hershey deliver fantastic performances, and the sense of unease that all three actors contribute to the proceedings cannot be overstated. Kunis also acquits herself well, although her role is perhaps the most one-dimensional of the film.

I'm aware that many people (mostly males) will discount Black Swan due to the ballet setting. This would be a mistake, as they will be missing a brilliant, twisted journey into the world of competitive ballet, replete with sex, violence, and disturbing imagery galore. This is one of the best movies of the year. 5 out of 5 stars.",1300233600,5,3437,4.900343642611684
4246043,1,B0041KKYEM,"I have been a follower of Darren Aronofsky's films since Pi, and with each release, his stories have gotten more precise, more refined and more visceral. He's been getting the most out of his cast and has a handful of Oscar nominations and three wins in the category of acting that can be attributed (in part) to his visionary way of storytelling. Black Swan is responsible for one of these wins as Natalie Portman carried the movie on her wings.

I saw the movie for the first time tonight, and my initial excitement of seeing the traits and characteristics of an Aronofsky film quickly turned to confusion before turning to disappointment. The elements that make up an Aronofsky masterpiece were there, but they lacked the cohesion to draw it all together. I stopped caring about Portman's character and quickly grew to dislike her. I am honestly baffled that this movie was nominated for best picture/best director, and equally stunned that Natalie took home the Oscar for best actress in a leading role. Her dancing was impressive considering she hadn't danced ballet before signing on, but I was truly uninspired by the character she played. She cries in virtually every scene, and when she's not crying (and even when she is STILL crying) she hallucinates. For no reason. To sum up: Crying in every scene. Hallucinating for no reason.

***SPOILER ALERT***
Some are going to try to convince you that it was the pressures of her job that drove her to go mad, but if that's the case, it's never explained. I was expecting to discover that she was schizophrenic or had a drug addiction or SOMETHING that would give credibility and legitimacy to the hallucinations -- you know, the way Darren did in Pi, or Requiem or The Fountain or even The Wrestler. I can assure you, I work in an EXTREMELY stressful environment on a daily basis, and at no time have I had visions of a lesbian encounter, followed by me stabbing someone to death followed by me sprouting wings followed by me discovering that instead of stabbing someone to death an hour earlier I had actually stabbed myself but never noticed until now, but since the show must go on, I think I'll dance a little more and then die.

4246044,5,B0041KKYEM,"Natalie Portman yet again dominates a film, and she's brilliant and mesmerizing in a brilliant and mesmerizing film.  ""Black Swan"" is the story of art as a fatal obsession, how actors must live and breathe their part in order to be perfect.  This was the theme of ""The Life and Death of Peter Sellers,"" where Geoffrey Rush portrayed a man who could never separate reality from fantasy -- and this schizophrenia would be the source of Sellers' genius.  Portman in ""Black Swan"" takes this theme to its deadly extreme.",1300147200,3,515,4.764044943820225
4246045,3,B0041KKYEM,"I really looked forward to this movie, hoping it would be Natalie Portman's break out role, but alas it was little more than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wrestler/dp/B001TOD92C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wrestler</a>&nbsp;with ballerinas.  Aranofsky has no knowledge of how the ballet, much less the creative process, functions.  What he tries to create is another visceral experience, filled more with ""wet dreams"" than any sense of dance or the stage.  Since Natalie is obviously not much of a dancer, we see this production almost entirely from behind her right shoulder.  Symbolic perhaps, but downright annoying when it comes to seeing any dance.  Of course this movie is not about dance, it is about poor Nina's painful metamorphosis, as she tries to shake the claustrophobic world of her mother (Barbara Hershey), who had forsaken dance to have her, and get past her own limitations of ""perfection.""

Mila Kunis adds a little intrigue as Lily, but Aronofsky uses her as little more than a sexual foil to Nina's growing ambitions.  The ballet master might as well have been played by Piers Morgan, as he does little more than frown and genuflect when Nina fails to give him the ""black swan"" he so much desires.  He taunts her into masturbating, supposedly to unleash the sexual energy he is looking for in the role.  Portman spends most of the time looking lost and confused, not sure where Thomas (Seymour Kassel) is going to go next, until she finally gets her moment on stage and literally becomes the black swan.  Although I have to say I was impressed with Winona Ryder's portrayal of Beth.  Ryder is virtually unrecognizable, and gave the character more emotional energy than any of the other actors did their characters.

4246051,5,B0041KKYEM,"Tchaikovsky composed one of his most beautiful musics for that old tale in which a prince will come to free the white swan who is a princess but the prince will fall in love with the adventurous and enterprising black swan and that will cause the death, the suicide of the white swan. Charming Princes are no longer what they used to be: they want to choose their princesses. Princes have been liberated from simple predetermined stories, especially when there is un ugly black duckling in the flock.

The cruelty and the difficulty of the choreography is that the same dancer is supposed to be both the white and the black swans. Two styles, two genres, two universes that are so antagonistic and so mutually hostile, that it leads to a drama every night. If the dancer identifies with that impossible and schizophrenic situation it is more than a drama, it becomes a tragedy.

The genius of this film is to invest and embed the dancer in a personal situation that leads to death in a way or another. She is the daughter of a dancer who stopped dancing at the age of twenty-eight when she got pregnant, without a father and twenty-eight is old for a dancer. She never was anything but a member of the chorus line. She carries her daughter at arm's length into realizing the dream she has never been able to realize herself: to become the Swan Queen. She supports her, helps her, takes care of her in the most stifling way imaginable.

She thus stifles in her any kind of personal libido, love instinct. That makes the daughter awkwardly constantly scratch her shoulders. But when she starts embodying the Janus double-face Sawn Queen, the darkest impulses surge up and find their way out in a fantasy-driven nightmare. She explodes in unsatisfied or self-satisfied sexual impulses. She develops a strong hatred for her body-double, a body-double which is normal practice with ballet stars.

The worst is till to come because her mother who wanted her to be what she herself has not been able to be is also the one who wants to prevent her daughter to do what she has not herself done, hence to succeed better than her. This conflict between the mother and the daughter is also schizophrenic. The dancer can identify perfectly with the paranoid psychotic Swan Queen and live the fate of the white swan right to the bitter end of its death.

The music is the most beautiful music you will ever hear but do not get trapped by the poisonous syrup that flows from the notes. The candy is laced with ecstasy if you are lucky, more probably with arsenic if you are really lucky, because then you can evade this unbearable world. And that is a phenomenal liberation, to die when the audience in the house is frantically calling for you after the show.

Obsessed with perfection, Nina (Natalie Portman), a ballet dancer, struggles immensely when she is given the diverse role of the Swan Queen for the ever famous ballet, Swan Lake.  While she seems ideal for the part, her only fault is in portraying the role of the evil Black Swan.  Her strive for perfection creates a whirlwind of frustration, tension, and paranoia that will either make her or break her in this dazzling film.  Unlike most of Aronofsky's films, it is not just a story about obsession and tragedy.  He turns the Black Swan into a dark, Gothic horror film that is unlike any other movie this year.  Don't be misguided by it's feminine appeal; Black Swan is a provocative movie that you won't be able to get out of your head for days.

4246053,5,B0041KKYEM,"There aren't many words to describe Black Swan. The only ones I have been able to come up with are beautiful, thrilling, haunting, and delirious.
From the moment the Fox Searchlight intro began rolling until the end credits I was completely captivated by this film. The way the plot shadowed the basic summary of the Swan Lake ballet was done very well. It was one of those moves where the outcome is given to you in the theatrical trailer if you can catch it; ""I had the craziest dream last night about a girl who was turned into a swan, but her prince falls for the wrong girl and she kills herself.""
Natalie Portman shined as Nina in ways I didn't think she could. I have been a fan of Natalie for many years and this was by far one of the best, if not the best, performances I have ever seen from her. Her ballet skill surprised me and you could tell she really did train to make herself appear like a true professional dancer. Her transformation from a ""white swan"" image to that of a ""black swan"" was phenomenal. I truly believed that her spin into absolute madness and her loss of reality was real. I couldn't imagine anyone else winning the Academy Award. Natalie deserved it 100% and I hope those curious to see why she won do so. Truly a great, dedicated performance.
The symbolism was marvelous; the scratches on Nina's back, the bleeding fingers, the feather-like barbs in her skin, the bloodshot eyes, etc.. The barbs served as a reflection of Nina losing her grip on being a ""white swan."" It wasn't until the dance of the black swan that we saw the barbs turn into feathers completely transforming her into the swan. And although it took me by surprise the sexual aspect also fit in with the symbolism. The director's instruction was for Nina to touch herself and try and free her innocent perception and mindset. You see as the plot progresses Nina becoming more comfortable being seductive and sexual with herself and, as it turns out, with Mila Kunis' character, Lily. As shocking as the scenes were they did flow with the plot perfectly. If they would have been toned down and/or excluded the film would not have been the same.
The musical score was fantastic, as well. It had main elements of Tchaikovsky and the original ballet but was a little twisted. As a fan of classical music, and Tchaikovsky in general, I was very pleased with what Clint Mansell did with it.
I love the way Black Swan had glimpses of the horror genre. It isn't horror in the way of being a typical slasher flick but the psychological aspect makes this film truly creepy and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. I got goosebumps quite a few times while watching this movie. Absolutely chilling and brilliant. I can't wait to own it.",1299196800,4,2728,4.513131313131313

4246055,3,B0041KKYEM,"In 2004, a comedy troupe made up of five guys called ""Broken Lizard"" released what I thought was an absurdly funny spoof of horror movie conventions called ""Club Dread."" A shape suddenly appears behind a character, and a loud music queue goes off making the audience jump, or a series of contrived twists turn the plot into Swiss cheese--""Club Dread"" simultaneously mocked and embraced these kinds of traditions. Although as we can usually expect this protocol in most run-of-the-mill horror movies, never did I think that visionary director Darren Aronofsky would stoop to that level, and all but disregard the integrity and grit that he has layered into all of his previous films.

But I think I am getting ahead of myself. Aronofsky's new film ""Black Swan"" centers on Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman), a ballet dancer who is technically proficient, but lacks the raw emotional element of the craft. She lives with her mother, Erica (Barbara Hershey), who once a dancer herself and now wants Nina to succeed farther than she ever could. Erica had to stop dancing after she got pregnant, and she now is the ultimate stage-mom, controlling every moment of her daughter's life and browbeating her when she questions her guidance.

Nina's other instructor in life is the suave, challenging Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel.) He casts Nina in the duel role of the White and Black swans in his new ""stripped-down"" production of Tchaikovsky's ""Swan Lake."" Leroy tells her that she is perfect for the White Swan, but that in order to play the Black Swan to perfection, she must let go and feel the passion and the intensity.
Perfection is the key word here. Aronofsky has called his new film ""a perfect companion piece"" to his previous film, ""The Wrestler,"" which, along with his previous three (""The Fountain,"" ""Requiem for a Dream,"" ""Pi"") also dealt with obsession and addiction. This time, Aronofsky tackles the obsession with perfection, and Portman is his puppet. After a rival dancer (Mila Kunis) arrives and seems to be out to get her, Nina slowly begins to deteriorate mentally and physically, as she descends into a downward spiral that only Aronofsky could possibly have envisioned.

Portman has received much acclaim for what many film critics have called the performance of her career.  I don't want to spoil what Aronofsky and crew have cooked up for a finale by talking too much about specifics in her performance, but in the final third, audiences can expect to discover a side of Portman that almost unrecognizable, as she seemingly goes to a dark and sinister place in her mind to become the duel role. Trained for almost a year to prepare for this role, and the hard work definitely shows. It is a stunning balancing act of technical and emotional skill, and she is superb.

Portman's performance is complimented by some very good supporting work from the always-terrific Cassel, Barbara Hershey and Mila Kunis. Unfortunately, this is where the film becomes harder to discuss.

SPOILERS FOLLOW:
When talking about the characters and their intentions, the lines between reality and Nina's imagination become so profusely blurred that I am left asking myself, ""Who cares?"" I don't want to be asking that question, and I almost feel guilty considering how much I have admired Aronofsky's work in the past--""The Wrestler"" was one of the best films of the past decade. But this time around, he has ventured into horror movie territory and fumbled the raw passion that Nina herself actually does finally realize with her final transformation, a stunning visual effect and an image that still haunts my mind.

I understand that this movie is pure melodrama, and that the stakes are raised to the nth degree in order to achieve the grandest of finales. We are shown absurd images of Nina's degenerating mental state, as her psychoses lead her to transform into the swan (an elongated neck here, bird legs there, black feathers all over), and it is a fascinating concept.
But the concept is immersed in heavy-handed symbolism and disconcertingly average ""jump-scares"" and other horror conventions that have no place here. I have given a lot of thought to the ending, and have decided that it works better than I originally concluded. This movie most certainly deserves a second look, but right now I think that it is Aronofsky's weakest outing yet.
END SPOILERS:

The cinematography by Matthew Libatique (another Aronofsky regular) is also worth mentioning, as it is the most distracting and irritating work he has done. That is a mouthful, considering that he worked on the erratically filmed ""Requiem for a Dream"" and ""Pi."" He did not work on ""The Wrestler,"" but it seems as though he is trying to replicate that same style of following closely behind the main character wherever she goes. It is way too shaky this time around. I will say that the ballet scenes are wonderfully captured. Handheld cameras were used here to a greater advantage, so the dancers could be chased around as they flutter on and offstage, creating a wonderful flow of movement.

What works best in ""Black Swan,"" aside from the performances, is the wonderful use of Tchaikovsky's music, arranged and (I assume) remixed by the brilliant Clint Mansell, an Aronofsky regular whose work never fails to send chills up my spine. His music is like another character in the film, as it lives and breathes just like Nina does. Now if Aronofsky could have only managed to breathe a little more life into the film itself, it could have been far more interesting than this end product.

4246056,5,B0041KKYEM,"I'll start off by saying I've seen a fair amount of Aranofsky's work and enjoyed Pi and Requiem for a Dream a lot. I saw the trailer for this ages ago, and thought it looked creepy enough (like the two mentioned above) that I'd check it out, despite revolving around a subject which I could care less about. To my surprise, it had me hooked from the beginning. Natalie Portman is incredible -- she definitely deserved best actress for her role which came across as genuine as an I've seen in years. As with any of the Best Picture nominees you'll see a ton of sock puppets and trolls either praising it or blasting it, and as usual you'll have to figure it out for yourself. I'm neither, just an instant fan of this flick that thinks it deserves most of the praise heaped on it.",1298851200,4,778,4.335616438356165
4246057,5,B0041KKYEM,"For director Darren Aronofsky, the pipe dream of Pi, and the promise of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wrestler/dp/B001TOD92C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wrestler</a>has become the reality of Black Swan.

For actress Natalie Portman, Black Swan has offered the best role and she has delivered the best performance of her career.  She lost 20 pounds to play the role.

Nina Sayers operates in the highly competitive and perfectionistic world of ballet.  She is perfectionistic and insecure.  'I just want to be perfect.' When the prima ballerina played by Winona Ryder is forced to retire, because she is considered too old though she is still young, numerous dancers vie for her position, to play the lead role in the Black Swan. In the story the white swan representing the light wants the prince, and the black swan representing the dark side swoops in and seduces the prince.

The dancer has to dance both roles. In the privacy of the bathroom and away from public eyes her insecurities get the better of her. So begins the descent into madness.  In order to play both roles she has to tap her own dark side, which she has repressed all her life.  The question becomes will she be able to play the role and recover, and triumph, or will she so overidentify with the role that she meets a similar fate as the white swan.  The director of the ballet grabs her.  He has seduced the prima ballerinas before, and says 'I want there to be no boundaries between us.' Almost as soon as the production starts, the black swan manifests in the form of Mila Kunis, who coincidentally has black wings tattooed on her back.

At home the controlling mother played brilliantly by Barbara Hershey has no sense of boundaries, and intrudes in her private domain of the bathroom, and the bedroom.

Almost as soon as the production starts, the black swan manifests in the form of Mila Kunis, who coincidentally has black wings tattooed on her back, and onto whom she projects her insecurities. Will she seduce the dark prince, the director.

What I liked particularly about this movie is the seamlessness of the directors vision.  Sometimes its dissociated as she is in the picture and we are following her.  When this happens we are in reality.  The it moves to the subjective and we are seeing what she sees, and we are having having some of the same difficulties she has determining what is real and what is projection, and we find it difficult sometimes to tell the difference.  Much has been made of the raunchy love scene with Mila Kunis, and it was good.

In fact, if you are like me you may need to watch it a second time to figure this out better.

Typically, the Academy award goes for two types of roles:

1. The psychopath eg no Country for Old men, and There Will be blood

2.  The person with a social or personal disability, having to deal with great adversity, overcoming great odds, mental illness addiction etc. eg Jeffrey Rush in Shine  Russell Crowe in a Beautiful Mind, Jeff Bridges as an alcoholic in Crazy Heart.

If this year follows the usual pattern, Natalie Portman will win as the mentally ill ballerina, Colin Firth as the Stammering king in The Kings Speech, and Chrisian bale as the crackhead boxing coach in The Fighter.  While I favor Aronofsky for Best Picture and Best Director, it's by no means as clear cut as the the acting categories, as the Fighter, True Grit and Kings Speech are very evenly matched for quality.

4246058,5,B0041KKYEM,"Director Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler, Requiem for a Dream) has done some offbeat films but has always elicited strong performances from his leads.  Perhaps his greatest achievement is getting an Oscar worthy performance from Natalie Portman in Black Swan, a film that does an impressive job of depicting a psychological downward spiral of a competitive ballerina in the role of a lifetime.

Nina Sayers (Portman) works hard at her craft and gets the coveted starring role in Swan Lake.  Doted on by her mother (Barbara Hershey in an unusual role) and pushed to extremes by her ballet director, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), she begins to feel threatened and becomes delusional and loses touch with reality.  A new arrival, Lily (Mila Kunis), understudies her and becomes not only her friend and night scene companion, but also her main competitor and threat.  Is she undermining her on purpose or is Nina just imagining it all?  As opening night approached, the visions become even more disturbing to the point that Nina is at the brink of her sanity and the curtain opens on the most important moment of her life.

Portman projects a complex series of conflicting emotions including anxiety, jealousy, and even guilt as if she does not deserve the lead.  Guided by Aronofsky, she soars as she has never done before.  Not only does she perform a substantial amount of physically demanding ballet, but we see things through her eyes and feel her pains. Does she really commit the horrible acts she thinks she may have done or is it all in her warped mind?  It's not a pleasant journey.  There is extremely disturbing use of mirror images that reflect Nina's face and become Lily in the next instant in jarring and unexpected fashion.  Is Nina seeing Lily or is it a reflection of her own self?  A moment that shows the various pieces of wall art at her home coming alive in nightmarish figures is truly unnerving.

Kunis as Lily brings enough menace to her role.  Winona Ryder has a supporting role of a retiring, vindictive ballerina, Beth MacIntyre, who ends up in the hospital.  A scene where Nina worships Beth is reminiscent of Anne Baxter and Bette Davis in the dressing room scene of All About Eve.  Beth is bitter and even self abusive which kind of foreshadows what awaits Nina.  Cassell is effective as the ballet director whose sexism and unusual methods are suspect but never his quest for the absolute best for his production.  Hershey registers as an overly concerned, controlling mom.

The film does a good job of showing the mental and physical toll that rehearsal and practice take on a performer, and to make matters worse, the angst exhibits itself seemingly on Nina's body in distorted and grotesque manifestations.  The physical mutations would probably amuse and please the likes of David Cronenberg and David Lynch.  As Leroy demands more than what she shows in technique, she knows she has to give everything in her soul and more to satisfy the ballet's demands.  There is an interesting dichotomy showing two sides of a ballerina's psyche with the repressed, uptight Nina whose frigidity is counterpointed by the free spirited and sensual Lily.  Lily evens brings out her sexuality and inner yearning that seems all too real, or is it a dream?  Something that is never mentioned or shown is if Nina is a virgin or ever had a real boyfriend.  Then there is the duality within Nina of White and Black Swans in which the dark side must emerge if she is to fully inhabit the lead role.

Much of the film recalls other memorable films that bend reality like The Fight Club or Affliction, and Nina's descent into madness has striking similarities to Roman Polanski's classic Repulsion whose woman descends into psychological delusions and paranoia.

Aronofsky's use of camera work is startling as it works in concert with Portman's performance, and when you see the change in her eyes near the end, it is stunning.  The film employs lots of handheld shots with cinematographer Matthew Libatique to visualize a subjective viewpoint for Nina.  The score by Clint Mansell is well done with a touch of foreboding.  Both of them are Aronofsky veterans.  The final scene as Nina readies to perform the last act as she morphs into the Black Swan to complete her transformation is haunting.  The final shot is unforgettable.  Some viewers may be turned off by its repellent imagery but others will be astonished by a powerful depiction of madness at any price.",1298592000,3,4474,4.851119894598155
4246059,4,B0041KKYEM,"Black Swan, like many of Darren Aronofsky's other films, is a story that thrives on symbolism ranging from colors and shapes to shadows and terror. It is more reminiscent of his grittier works like The Wrestler or Requiem for a Dream rather than the somber and gorgeous The Fountain.

Black Swan is an entire retelling of Swan Lake as performed by the character of Nina mastered by Natalie Portman. Nina is a victim of a pressured perfection brought on by her mother, Erica (Barbara Hershey). At the same time Thomas (Vincent Cassel), Swan Lake's artistic director, and Lily (Mila Kunis) are pushing our protagonist towards a darker path to which she never recovers from. We witness Nina's transformation as it's brilliantly crafted between her real life and that of Swan Lake.

Director Darren Aronofsky has the tendency of transforming actors and actresses into something out of their norm. When watching Requiem for a Dream, Marlon Wayans is now Tyrone Love suffering as a tragic character. In The Fountain, Hugh Jackman has become Tom Creo traveling to Xibalba. If I didn't know any better, I'd say Aronofsky has something to do with the fact that I've yet to see either actors top their respective roles.

Natalie Portman continues the trend as she plays a changing Nina, two characters of her personality. She is the frail, yet cowardly Swan Queen, but she is also the jealous seductress known as the Black Swan. Portman goes through a psychological battle that results in a completely new type of victim. The audience has the privilege of savoring every moment, every tug and rip. Natalie Portman is truly what a ""Best Actress"" of 2010 consists of.
Mila Kunis is Lily, our symbolic Black Swan. Time and time again, Lily is an obstacle to Nina's role of the Swan Queen and the Black Swan. She is a threat to the false sense of love between Nina and Thomas, the prince of our personal Swan Lake. Lily is the corruption inside of Nina as shown by the dangerous lifestyle and her darker wardrobe.
Vincent Cassel dominates as the manipulative, yet brilliant, Thomas. His intimacy with Nina is scary as we are introduced to his previous pet project played by an impressive cameo from Winona Ryder. Whenever he is showcased in his own familiar surroundings, Thomas is engulfed in a black and white world. He is two calculating extremes that are rarely in the center or gray. Still, Thomas is a ballet mastermind as the end result that is the true Black Swan is nothing short of perfection.
Each and every character is a unique stepping-stone for Nina as she crosses the boundaries of the human psyche.

The presentation is the only portion of Black Swan that slightly suffers. The CGI used in some scenes added to the psychological terror with subtle hints. Never have paintings in a room that move on their own been used more effectively. Other times it took one away from the experience by trying to do too much on such a tight budget. We don't have to see Nina's skin change as drastically or as often as it was portrayed. The special effects were my one disappointment as I've seen Darren Aronofsky pull off some hefty visuals with smaller budgets. Less is more sometimes.

It is a mint blemish in an otherwise thrilling film. The characters, the themes, and the music are what carry us on the excursion. The scenes are crafted in such a way that I'm reminded of some of the more powerful scenes in Amadeus. When there is a pivotal scene in Black Swan, the music thunders just like a spot on ballet performance.

It is Swan Lake, a realistic version of it. We hear parts of the actual Swan Lake musical in the story and we see the symbolic defeats and triumphs. The scenery's lighting changes under a darker context over time. Stunning backgrounds provide more than enough clues of foreshadowing.

Darren Aronofsky has topped 2008's The Wrestler with a film that is raw in emotion and fright. While The Fountain still holds as my favorite film of all time, Black Swan still performs an intense and seductive story. Black Swan is the dark corruption that finally overtakes everyone at times. It is the freedom found in the end of a tragic and near perfect rendition of Swan Lake.",1298592000,9,4182,4.728395061728395
4246060,5,B0041KKYEM,"Clearly some people don't know a great movie/performance when they're sitting there watching one! I guess you can always find someone who hates everything.

Natalie Portman was nothing less than spectacular. The thing I like to see from actors is their ability to demonstrate the full gamut of human emotion. Sometimes it takes a few movies or shows to get that but a good roll, coupled with a great actor or actress, can bring a lady from being a pretty good co-star to a must have leading actress. Natalie Portman has seriously stepped up with this fantastic movie.

The last time I saw this kind of ""tour de force"", of acting was from Dwight Schultz on Star Trek:TNG Season #4 Episode #19. That too was impressive.",1298505600,4,717,4.682539682539683
4246061,4,B0041KKYEM,"Everyone who wants to see ""Black Swan"" asks recent viewers the same question: ""Did you like it?"" The answers are guarded, focusing on the film's quality acting and cinematography. But did I like it?

The movie tells the story of Nina, a 28-year-old ballerina who is desperate to act in a new and controversial production of Swan Lake. Nina is a shy, mousy-voiced young woman who rarely goes out and who lives with her ex-ballerina mother in a New York apartment. Her mom seems strangely intent on keeping Nina secluded, setting up the movie to appear as a coming of age drama in which a talented young person needs to break away from home to become a star. But there's more than meets the eye - there's something off about the way Nina experiences the world. Meanwhile the ballet's imperious director is pushing her to ""let go"" of her inhibitions so she can better inhabit the role of the Black Swan, the demonic twin of the beautiful and delicate White Swan that Nina can play with her eyes closed. The tensions between Mom's protectiveness, her director's haranguing and Nina's own repressed desires perfectly propel the story.

This ain't your ordinary ballet story. It richly deserves its ""R"" rating for scenes of sexuality and violence, so leave the pre-teens at home and think twice about bringing the high-schoolers. But it is a visually compelling film. The ballet scenes are gorgeously choreographed, with sound effects added (needlessly?) to enhance ballet's silent movements. Natalie Portman easily deserves an Oscar for her performance, even if the film might not. She is the desperately shy naf, haunted by visions and fears. The rest of the cast was wonderful. As for the film itself, I am torn. The story was compelling, and far from formulaic. The scenes portraying Nina's inner life - especially her dreams - are rightly frightening, disturbing and confusing. The Jungian theme of wrestling with one's shadow -- one's denied and hated side -- prevails over everything. But ""Black Swan"" really only works on one level - maybe one and a half. It is often little more than a story of a woman trying to break out of her own shell, one that has both constricted and protected her. The easy message - that freedom is always and necessarily positive - is belied by the crisis that ends the film.

""Black Swan"" is interesting, intense, beautiful and disturbing. But as being neither an allegory nor a cautionary tale, it seems to have nothing to say beyond itself.",1298332800,5,2473,4.827830188679245
4246062,2,B0041KKYEM,"I was searching for some poignant symbolism to explain away the weirdness of the movie, maybe something intellectual and/or artsy that went over my head. Then I thought I didn't get it because I don't know the story of Swan Lake - which is slightly embarrassing to admit because I feel like I should have been exposed to it sometime in my life - and maybe there's a parallel between the two stories that explains everything. However, according to Wikipedia the parallels end at Portman being the sweet and innocent White Swan and Kunis the sexy Black Swan, because there's not much to Swan Lake after that. So after running it over and over in my mind, I really think that there isn't some grand underlying metaphor that I missed... it's just a weird movie.

I feel like I could have really liked this film, and I think that's what's bothering me. Portman did a phenomenal job as the high-strung perfectionist ballerina whose neurotic fragility is both endearing and frightening. You sympathize with her and root for her to do well, while also hoping for her to break out of her shell and own the stage. When the paranoia is too much, her descent into madness is an overwhelmingly fantastic and scary thing to behold. There's so much potential for a great film, then confusing hallucinations, eye-rolling cliches, a seizure-inducing club scene, and a random lesbian romp muddied up the waters. There were so many moments when I inappropriately laughed because I did not know how else to react. I'm sure the people around me thought I was crazy. And to be honest, there were moments when there was so much going on onscreen that I thought I was the crazy one.

The costumes were awesome, though, and were pretty much the only things that kept my attention. Portman wore cozy knits off stage and wonderful frilly feathery tutus onstage. Her Black Swan costume really makes a small part of me wish I had taken ballet.

I read a critique about the movie where a bunch of real dancers where upset that they cast an actress in this role and not an actual dancer, which sounds completely asinine because I'm pretty sure this was a movie and you use actors in movies. Portman did such a great job that I thought she had some sort of a dance background prior to the movie, but she just had a lot of intense training during filming (so intense she got engaged and impregnated by her choreographer). A lot of her fancy footwork was done by a body double, but she had the movement and grace of a real ballerina in my opinion. And if the used real ballerinas instead? You get Center Stage - a cheesy flick where the dancing's great, but the dialogue makes you cringe.

It was all just too ridiculous. There were also a lot of gorey scenes involving the lead character and her obsession with picking at herself. That made me really queasy throughout the movie. Natalie was not all that convincing as a ballerina and I find her mostly boring as a screen presence. She did have some good moments though, and the movie also had some interesting twists -- though for me not enough to recommend the movie.

A worthy cast delivered exactly what the director dictated.  While critics genuflected, sophisticated audiences have viewed, rejected, and refused to recommend Black Swan to friends.

4246066,3,B0041KKYEM,"This film would appear to be based on mental illness. A disease that most of the times goes untreated and ignored until it is too late. In this story we meet Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman). She has been working very hard at becoming the prima ballerina in her New York City Ballet company.

However, underneath that determined facade, there is a load of guilt placed there by her mother, who gave up such an opportunity in order to give birth to Nina. A side spin off of her mother's over-controlling ways is that Nina has become sexually repressed, and is not in touch with her sexuality, neither has she fully come to terms with being a young adult female. As a result, she is innocently led into some sexual experiences.

The main concept in this movie is that it attempts to deal with parallels and opposites:

[1] In the Ballet production, there is the White swan and the Black Swan, which for this production must both be played by Nina.

[2] In her personal life, she begins also to display a split personality, and at times it would appear that she deliberately cuts herself. In her ""white"" personality, she is a virgin, and does everything to please and obey her mother, on the other hand, her ""black"" personality is defiant, and is sexually promiscuous.

The bottom line is that Nina, is in desperate need of help. Everyone else seems just too busy with their own ambitions and personal goals to really notice. She is haunted by visions of her very own self. A self that is tired of all the rules and tired of all the pressure.

The big question is, who will really win: Nina or the phantom of herself that haunts her?

2011 Best Actress Nominee:

It should be noted that Natalie Portman has been nominated by the Academy Awards for Best Actress because of this role. Her role was quite demanding, physically in terms of the dancing involved, emotionally in terms of duality of the roles that she had to play, and then there was the simulated sexual content (which I personally did not care for).",1297814400,22,2005,4.5654596100278555
4246067,5,B0041KKYEM,"Black Swan's premise originally seems simple; the cutthroat world of ballet in the perspective a talented, but insecure student. Natalie Porman plays Nina, the dancer who seems to be falling apart from the beginning of the film. After about the half-hour mark the movie becomes an intense thriller with many complex ideals.

Lets start with the performances. Everyone in this film is cast perfectly, too the point where you can't find a weak person in the group. Barbara Hershey gives a creepy performance as Nina's controlling mother and also delivers some of the films funnier moments (which is nice in such a dark film). Mila Kunis also gives a career making performance as Lily, the dancer that embodies everything Portman's Nina lacks. Of course the biggest buzz for this film was Portman's performance, which was nearly flawless which could have come off as really disjointed (we'll get to it).

The reason that the performances are so great is because the writing in this film really isn't the best, some of the lines sounded way to dramatic to ever be real, but the cast completely pulls each line off and makes the movie seem seamless.

I'll leave out my theory of what this film is about, but it does have a lot to do with the implications that societies expectations of women. If you enjoy smart films, with brilliant performances this is definitely for you.",1297728000,6,1369,4.8418803418803416
4246068,3,B0041KKYEM,"I'm not going to bother with summing up the plot but will instead get down to the nitty-gritty. The movie was interesting enough for me to say it was OK but in no way did it live up to the hype which it has garnered. I went into this expecting to see something scary, or at least suspenseful, but was instead thwarted on both fronts. The critics must have given this film its rave reviews based solely on its ""daring"" display of lesbianism and masturbation (although no nudity is displayed in the entire movie) because it barely has any other memorable moments short of the actual acting performances themselves (which are actually worthy of their critical acclaim). At a certain point in the movie you start to wonder if the odd ""visions"" Portman's character keeps having are ever going to amount to anything more than a weak attempt by the writer/director to startle you. It seems like they are just tossed at you for pure shock value alone. There's no plot twists to speak of, just a feeble attempt to confuse the viewer into thinking that something way cooler than the actual ending is coming. During the lesbian scene I had hopes that the story would finally justify all the pointless ""visions"" and the two girls would swap bodies or something but, alas, this would have been too interesting to have conceived. Ultimately the viewer is forced to endure innumerable meaningless ""surprises"" until the less than adequate ending rears its ugly head.

I would recommend renting this if you want to see it but don't buy it first. In my opinion it is neither scary nor suspenseful and is a vastly inferior film for all the hype it has attracted.",1297728000,12,1643,4.665517241379311

Well I really enjoyed the film. It was elegant and the plot makes sense with weaving all of the important details in it. It is worth spending 2 hours of your time to watch it.

4246070,3,B0041KKYEM,"To be honest, when I first saw this movie poster for Black Swan (2010), I never thought I would go see this film in the theater. It was just so far outside of my normal movie ""box"" that it didn't appeal to me. I figured I would wait for Blu-ray to rent it. And then the critical buzz for it began. I had only seen one Darren Aronofsky film, The Wrestler (2008), up until recently when a friend of mine turned me on to The Fountain (2006). Both movies were good, so I decided to go check out Black Swan and see if this interesting director could make an interesting movie about ballet.

Aronofsky did make an interesting and well-crafted movie here. But I've got mixed feelings about the final results. I'm not going to summarize the plot to the film since I don't feel there's much of one here, so what little there is should be left for you to discover while watching the film. I think the strongest part of the film is the middle act where we see Natalie Portman's lead character Nina Sayers become more like the black swan instead of the white swan that she has been all of her life. It's the mixing of the two aspects of her psychology, black & white, yin & yang, that interested me the most. The first act where we are introduced to Nina and the rest of the characters in the story dragged a bit for me. And I found Nina's innocent and naive ""white swan"" life to honestly be annoying. I just didn't buy into this young woman in New York City being so immature and princess-like in our modern 21st century. Especially as an urban girl. I couldn't wait for her to get ""real"" and more like the black swan. I see what Aronofsky was doing here in heavily emphasizing the contrast between the white swan and black swan personalities of Portman's character as we move through the movie, but it just felt too forced, theatrical, and over-the-top for me to relate to it and enjoy it. Being a 37-year old man whose never been in to theater or ballet, the story itself was not very appealing from the beginning. And rather than make that world more accessible to me, I think Aronofsky closed me off to it by stereotyping it and making it feel fake and theatrical. It may be that the real world of ballet is like Aronofsky's portrayal, but that doesn't mean it makes a good film...at least not for me.

The bottom line is that the story just didn't work for me overall. That being said, I did really enjoy the scenes between Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis, who plays Nina's competition within the ballet group. Kunis is more purely black swan compared to Portman's white swan. And the pairing of these two personalities gave real sizzle to those scenes where they psychologically, verbally, and physically battle each other. They had onscreen chemistry that was exciting. Kunis really showed her acting talents in her role as Lily in Black Swan. I can't wait to see her get more dramatic roles where she can put those talents to use further. Vincent Cassel, as ballet director Thomas Leroy was great as well. His dialogue just chewed into Portman, creating very highly charged scenes between the two. Barbara Hershey as Nina's mom was a little too crazy for me to appreciate. Her botched-looking facial plastic surgery was distracting and creepy. I'm assuming that Hershey made the mistake of trying to look younger than her age at some point in her life and got plastic surgery that just hasn't held up well over the years. Either that or she just hasn't aged well. Either way, I didn't care for Hershey in this film. Finally, Winona Ryder has a small part in the film that brings her back to the screen in a good role after many years of wasting away in bad to average movies.

Now aside from the story within Black Swan, there is some real filmmaking craft in the movie. I think the cinematography by Matthew Libatique is well shot and good looking. There was a little too much handheld photography for my taste. When I actively notice that the camera is handheld in a film, I tend to dislike it because then it feels more forced to me. And there were times in Black Swan when I had no idea why handheld was the choice. It just made me feel dizzy and sick from all the heavy jittery camera moves. I like handheld photography, but it can be over done too. Still, there is some incredible photography in Black Swan that makes it worth seeing simply for that.

Clint Mansell's music for the Black Swan is good. Not quite as good as I think he did with The Fountain (2006) and Moon (2009), but his reinterpretation of Tchaikovsky's music from Swan Lake is interesting and something that I want to listen to on its own to really appreciate. Mansell does a good job of helping emotionally tell Aronofsky's story in this film, and that is where a good film score starts in my opinion. Production design, costumes, make-up and everything in the art department for Black Swan are top notch. It's all of these supporting aspects of filmmaking that really helped keep Black Swan enjoyable for me to watch when I was bored or disinterested with the story. I could focus on the music, photography, and everything else and notice how well done each was.

I give Black Swan 3 stars out of 5. What keeps it from a rating of 2.5 stars is the cinematography, music, production design, and acting. The story of Black Swan is a mix of drama, thriller, and horror genres with a bit of musical thrown in. I doubt that Black Swan will be a film that I watch repeatedly over the years because it was just too over-the-top for me. I can see why there are many critics and fans of this film that are enamored with it. But it just wasn't a film for me. I can appreciate it like a fine wine, but like wine, it either tastes good to you or it doesn't. And Black Swan left a bit of a bitter taste in my mouth. I suggest you wait and rent this film on Blu-ray to see if you have a taste for it.",1297641600,8,5859,4.411275415896488
4246071,5,B0041KKYEM,"BLACK SWAN is a clinical examination of psychosis vs borderline personality dichotomy and as such it succeeds well.  It is not unusual for director Darren Aronofsky to plunge into controversial subject matter ('Requiem for a Dream', 'The Wrestler', 'Pi', 'The Fountain') but his mastery of a new zone of cinematic investigation of mental illness based on a story by Andr&eacute;s Heinz who also wrote the screenplay with Mark Heyman and John McLaughlin is his most daring work yet. BLACK SWAN is as disturbing a film to watch as it is a richly rewarding testament to storytelling based on age-old themes.

The setting is a ballet company preparing a new version of the familiar Petipa and Ivanov choreography of the ballet Swan Lake, a story based on Russian folktales about a young girl transformed into a white swan ('Odette') and the darker malevolent black swan ('Odile') who under spells from the evil Rothbart vie for the love of Prince Siegfried.  The choreographer Thomas (Vincent Cassel) must retire the reigning white swan queen (Winona Ryder) because of her age and has tryouts for a new swan queen.  The shy, introverted, frightened but excellent dancer Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) seems perfect for Thomas' new concept of the white swan, but she lacks the visceral and sensual passion for the extension of the role as the black swan.  Nina is the daughter of a frustrated ex-ballerina Erica Sayers (Barbara Hershey) who gave birth to Nina and missed out on becoming a prima ballerina.  Erica is controlling and forces Nina into rigorous training and discipline so that Nina will become the star Erica failed to realize.  Nina devotes her life to ballet, participates in behaviors such as self mutilation that suggest she is an unstable personality.  Thomas continues to attempt to bring out Nina's passionate personality but the attempts become Nina's obsessive delusions regarding her fear of being unable to be perfect: she imagines all manner of events and body changes, finding that her only friend Lily (Mila Kunis) leads her into an even more distorted lifestyle - or does she...  The manner in which Nina transforms herself into the black swan is breathtaking and the climax of the film leaves the audience wondering about the real ending versus another version of Nina's broken mind.

The cast is excellent, with Natalie Portman (who trained into her own balletic role so that she could perform Odette/Odile credibly) delivering a brilliant performance as the fragile, vulnerable, mentally disturbed Nina.  Her partner in the ballet, David, dancing the role of the Prince, is Benjamin Millepied - a remarkably magnetic actor/dancer with whom Portman is now engaged and pregnant.  Vincent Cassel and Barbara Hershey raise their characters to an even higher level than the script - wholly and terrifyingly credible. At times Aronofsky could have used some restraint in showing the repeated delusions of Nina's broken mind and the impact would have been a bit more subtle.  Mathew Libatique provides elegant cinematography and Clint Mansell reinterprets the Tchaikovsky score - sometimes it works, other times it is maddenly warped: the most successful plagiarism is in the piano-only reduction during the credits.  But the overall impact at film's end is a stunning work and a tribute to the talent of Natalie Portman.  Grady Harp, February 11",1297641600,2,3364,5.135531135531136

4246073,5,B0041KKYEM,"A-

A bizarre combination of art-house drama and psycho-sexual thriller, Darren Aronofsky's ""Black Swan"" is really an allegorical account of a young woman's descent into madness. It's also a variant of sorts on ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"" exploring the evil twin that lurks deep inside each and every one of us.

Nina (Natalie Portman) is a sheltered, intensely disciplined and sexually repressed ballerina who's just landed the role of a lifetime - that of the Swan Queen in a major New York ballet company production of ""Swan Lake."" Yet, while her innocence and formal perfectionism make her a natural for the part of the White Swan, she may lack the fiery, hot-blooded temperament and life experiences needed to convincingly portray the Black Swan. Or so the company director (Vincent Cassell) tells her, a man with an obvious interest in Nina beyond the purely professional. But Nina clearly has more pressing issues to deal with than just a lecherous dance instructor and a mother (Barbara Hershey), a failed dancer herself, who clearly wants to control every aspect of her daughter's life. Nina seems to be losing her grip on reality, as she begins to hear muffled voices, starts bleeding mysteriously from various parts of her body, and appears to be two different people when peering into a mirror. In fact, the idea of dopplegangers becomes a major visual motif throughout the film - reflective of the White Swan/Black Swan, Jekyll and Hyde, Good vs. Evil dichotomy - with one minor character even at one point assuming that Nina and a fellow ballerina are sisters because they look so much alike - as most ballerinas, almost by definition, have a tendency to do. Subtly at first, then with greater intensity as the story progresses, Nina begins to reflect a person deep in the throes of a nervous breakdown.

With a screenplay by Mark Heyman, John McLaughlin and Andres Heinz, based on a story by Heinz, ""Black Swan"" borrows quite liberally from earlier movies. There's a touch of ""All About Eve"" in its tale of an up-and-coming newcomer (Mila Kunis) seemingly intent on usurping Nina's lead in the production; there's a hint of ""Carrie"" in the dysfunctional mother/daughter relationship; and the whole young-woman-slipping-into-madness scenario is eerily reminiscent of Roman Polanski's film ""Repulsion"" from 1965. That being said, Aronofsky brings a great deal of his own to this work, keeping the horror movie hokum down to a minimum (though some does creep in from time to time) and effectively plunging us into a dizzying alternate reality in the bravura, brilliantly shot and edited scenes towards the end of the film. In fact, the closing stretches of the movie represent cinema in its purest form, as the pacing builds to a frenetic crescendo, perfectly reflective of Nina's mental state at the moment. Nina ultimately finds it in herself to truly become the Black Swan, but at what cost to herself and those around her?

The movie is obviously intended as a cautionary tale about the dangers of obsession and of avoiding life, and about the way in which single-mindedness when carried to the extreme can lead to psychological damage and even insanity for the individual involved. And who is more single-minded, disciplined and obsessed than a prima ballerina?

To say that Portman delivers a tour-de-force performance in this role would be to minimize her accomplishment; she throws herself so deeply into the character that it's hard to decide which is more impressive: the sheer overwhelming physicality of it all or the wrenching emotional conviction. This is clearly her movie, and she has given her whole heart and soul to it. Kunis is equally impressive in the Eve Harrington role of the far more easygoing, but clearly manipulative soubrette whom Nina is convinced wants to take her place in the show. And Hershey brings a compelling mixture of jealousy and concern to the role of a mother who's been where her daughter is now but whose influence over her seems to be waning over time.

Like Nina, we like to show only the White Swan aspect of our personalities to the world at large, choosing to hide - whether consciously or unconsciously - the Black Swan side from public view. Yet, as Nina soon discovers, the Black Swan will at some point insist on having its day, perhaps going so far as to kill off the White Swan in an effort to assert its preeminence.

Freud would have had a field day with this movie.",1297555200,5,4436,4.906666666666666
4246074,4,B0041KKYEM,"Natalie Portman is one of those stars who has been with us since she was a child.  The usual scenario is that these child actors are history the minute they become adults.  Some of them, for one, were cute children and are not especially attractive adults yet they are caught in an image business.  Natalie Portman did not have this problem.  She grew into a beautiful woman with her acting skills finely honed as she came into adulthood.  She also studied ballet until she was 12 so this role was especially well suited for her.  I think she may well get the Oscar for it because she is able to inhabit both parts of the swan from Swan Lake, the ballet. When we first meet her she is the virginal, pristine, rigid princess type white swan.  The black swan is the evil swan so she has to bring out a whole other side of herself in order to dance the black swan.  Her sequences onstage as the black swan are some of the very best in the entire film.

The plot is very simple and hinges entirely on the Natalie Portman swans.  It is that she starts cracking up as she pushes herself to become both swans.  This going nuts aspect of the movie is a bit over the top. I almost would have preferred a supernatural basis to her becoming the black swan. As we hurtle towards the ending, I'm reminded of the all time weeper of ballet movies, ""The Red Shoes."" This is not a weeper like that film but they both deal with the passion and obsession of the dance over the dancer.

I've always liked Darren Aronofsky's work and this film is no exception. One warning: if you hate ballet, this movie may not be for you.  There are very few moments in the movie where there isn't some aspect of ballet going on.

4246076,5,B0041KKYEM,"With the bravado of Fellini and the artistic sensibility of Bergman, Aronofsky has directed and written a piece that will live on in film history--not only a film noir pigeonhole--but also in widely respected ""best of..."" lists for decades to come, including eventually American Film Institute.  Black Swan is to Natalie Portman as Sunset Boulevard is to Gloria Swanson. A defining role. Portman stole the movie with wide-eyed innocence, sinewy body bursting with athleticism, and a mysterious charm that surges forth in each provocative scene like waves on the seaside shore.  She plays the role with gusto, yet plays the naive Nina as a heroine to which we can all relate.  She literally ""makes"" the movie, and has the Oscar to show it (February 27, 2010).

Although Aronofsky seems intent on telling the viewer that BLack Swan is the companion piece to The Wrestler, mentioning it at every interview, the two movies couldn't be further apart in texture, richness of story and acting.  The Wrestler was Rourke's return to the spotlight, but the subject matter was contrived, a meaningless foray into the life and times of a sometime deli meatcutter, sometimes washed up wrestler meandering through life.  Aronofsky would be best to keep Black Swan in its own pulpit as it's a force to be reckoned with... a deep mulitilayered story of a ballerina pressured by her mother, her coach, her peers and, in the end, the opera house audience, to ""be perfect"".  A visual and psychological extravaganza, it would have been too easy to go over the top with the transformation to swan for Nina (Portman), particularly in the physical metamorphosis.  But, alas, the balance was sublime, with equal parts horror and empathy, with a dash for raciness, to make a heady brew that will leave theater-goers dazzled and exhausted.

4246079,3,B0041KKYEM,"On the surface, Black Swan is the story of a ballet dancer (Natalie Portman) who chances to get her name in lights dancing the lead part in Tchaikovsky's ballet version of the fairy tale Swan Lake.  Swan Lake tells the story of a princess, Odette, who is trapped in the body of a swan by the spell of an evil sorcerer.  Odette meets a prince who falls in love with her and promises to break the spell by marrying her, but the sorcerer's daughter, Odile, impersonates Odette and tricks the prince, leaving Odette permanently under the sorcerer's spell.  In the end, Odette and the prince commit suicide together.  Traditionally, the parts of Odette and Odile are danced by the same ballerina, requiring a dancer to master two parts for the performance.  In the film, Portman is a technically proficient dancer who can easily master the part of virtuous Odette but has trouble portraying the sensual and seductive part of Odile.  Portman leads a boring life sharing an apartment with her mother.  The ballet's director (Vincent Cassel) encourages Portman to explore her passionate side to learn how to dance Odile and threatens to replace her in the lead by her understudy (Mila Kunis).  Struggling to find her inner Odile, Portman has psychological difficulties including dreams and visions, an erotic interlude with the help of Kunis, and finally finds the key to dancing Odile when she finds the strength to murder Kunis.

There's so much going on in Black Swan that it's like writer/director Aronofsky had a schizophrenic break and pulled together names, themes, and plot elements from all sorts of things in the history of film and pop culture.  Take just the name ""Black Swan.""  Although having meaning within Tchaikovsky's ballet Swan Lake, the term is also used to mean something very rare and has entered pop culture through Nassim Taleb's book of the same name.  Is it a coincidence that, according to this film, while there are many dancers who can master the part of Odette, the dancer who can master Odette and Odile is a rare bird indeed?  Or consider the parallels with the Sith of Star Wars.  Cassel replaces his former prima ballerina with Portman and threatens Portman with replacement by Kunis.  Like the Emperor, Darth Vader, and Luke Skywalker, there can be only one master (or director) and one apprentice (or prima ballerina) and Cassel encourages Portman to prove her worth and release her true power (i.e., dancing ability) by exploring the Dark Side.  Is it a coincidence that Portman appears in this part after playing Darth Vader's love interest in the Star Wars prequels?

Or consider the term ""red shoe.""  While many other reviewers have noted similarities between Black Swan and the 1948 ballet film called The Red Shoes, most people today are probably more familiar ""red shoe"" from the Showtime series Red Shoe Diaries, a series of erotic dramas that explore burgeoning female sexuality.  In this series, David Duchovny plays the former boyfriend of a dead woman who began cheating on him after being sold a pair of red shoes.  This odd plot device seems likely to have been inspired by the same Hans Christian Anderson story that inspired the 1948 film.  Is it a coincidence that Black Swan contains a strong erotic element that could have been swiped from an episode of Red Shoe Diaries?  Or is it a coincidence that a 2005 Korean horror film by the same name portrays a mother-daughter pair who live together in an apartment and involves dreams and visions?

Like Odette, Odile, and the Prince in Swan Lake, Portman and Kunis essentially compete for the favor of Cassel in Black Swan.  Cassel's character is named LeRoy (""the king""), while Portman's character is named Nina, a diminutive form of the name Ann, which in Hebrew means ""He chose me"" (Portman literally repeats this exact phrase when Cassel makes her his prima).  Kunis' character is named Lily, which is diminutive of Lilith, a type of mythological Hebrew succubus that takes the form of a bird, although a screetch owl rather than a swan...  All coincidence or intentional connect the dots?  One could go on in this vein.

So is there something more to all this, or is it just Aronofsky free association?  Swan Lake, composed in 19th century Russia, is an essentially moralistic tragedy that pits spontaneous virtuous love against plotting and dissembling.  The lovers can only find completion in heaven and are objectively separated from evil.  Black Swan was not composed in 19th century Russia but 21st century America.  As such, the film is not a moralistic tragedy but a therapeutic tragedy, and the protagonist does not find completion in separation from evil but by the exploration and integration of her Id.  Portman's childish life of pink sheets and music boxes is controlled by her mother and she must break out of it (i.e., kill her mother) if she is to be able to effectively dance the part of Odile for Cassel (i.e., marry her father).  The tragedy is that Portman has lived too long in the world of children and does not know how to explore her Id.  For Aronofsky, Odette and Odile are not two separate characters in a medieval Morality Play, but two halves of the psyche that have to be integrated in order for Portman to enter adulthood.  Tragically Portman is unable to manage the integration and is eventually consumed by the spirit of Odile, who encourages her to murder Kunis.  And just as in Mozart's The Magic Flute (another story involving bird-people), in which the evil sorcerer turns out to be benevolent and appearances are turned on their head, we see in the end of Black Swan that Cassel has really cared about Portman all along and his machinations have indeed been to help her fulfill her potential.  For in Aronofsky's story, the parts of the Evil Sorcerer and the Prince are mixed and divided.  Although Cassel with his harem of women trapped as ballet dancers appears to parallel Swan Lake's Evil Sorcerer with his harem of women trapped in the bodies of swans, we find that he is also the Prince and that it is Portman's mother who wishes to keep her trapped, like Mozart's Queen of the Night.

Is this all too much?  As movie critic Steve Sailor has pointed out, on many levels Black Swan is a counterpoint to Aronofsky's previous film The Wrestler: ""masculine v. feminine, experience v. innocence, heavy v. light, weightlifting v. bulimia, vulgar v. aristocratic...""  However, Sailor leaves out one particularly important dichotomy, which is how we deal with the entrances and exits to our adulthood, seen as the period of our prime productivity or artistic accomplishment.  While The Wrestler focuses on a washed up aging performer leaving adulthood and features Rourke and Tomei, two washed up actors, Black Swan focuses on a faltering talent struggling to enter adulthood.  And likewise Portman is the actress we have been waiting for, for years.  Since getting kudos in The Professional and going to Harvard, Natalie Portman has been the perpetual next big thing.  She may win an Oscar for this performance, but it's not clear to me why.  I think there's another Hans Christian Anderson story that applies here.

Is it a good film?  I had to think about it for a while.  At first I was angry because the horror and erotica genre hat-tips left me feeling like I had been scammed.  But after reading other reviews that praised the dancing in the film when there was virtually no dancing shown, I wanted to give it another shot and re-thought the whole thing.  Aronofsky seems like addled director but not one without talent.  Ultimately, this is a film that deserves 2 viewings and then to be forgotten.",1296950400,7,7640,4.841416474210932
4246080,2,B0041KKYEM,"Let's be clear.  BLACK SWAN is not a movie about dance or about romance. To say the least, BLACK SWAN is creepy, disturbing, and very strange.  It tries to be a horror flick on one level, and a psychological thriller on another.  Unfortunately, it fails miserably on both.

Don't get me wrong, BLACK SWAN is horrific, and, yes, I do understand what the director was trying to do. In many ways, it reminded me of the 1979 film ""All That Jazz,"" a bizarre and intimate look at choreographer Bob Fosse's life and his descent into drugs, sexual escapades, and near death experiences.  As with ""All That Jazz,"" BLACK SWAN plays like an acid trip gone bad...very, very bad.  You are never quite sure what is real, what is hallucination, or what is really going on.

BLACK SWAN takes us back stage during a new, re-envisioned production of Swan Lake.  Ballerina Nina (Natalie Portman) has snagged the leading role of the White Swan, which is perfect for her delicate and shy personality.  At the same time, she must also play the Black Swan and bring a sexier, wilder personality to life.  The stress of it all is too much for Nina, and she slowly begins to spiral into madness.  By the end she no longer has any idea as to what is real and what is not.

The problem is, neither do we.  For the most part, the characterizations are flat and clichd.  Natalie Portman whispers throughout the film and is very difficult to understand.  Barbara Hershey is empty and cardboard as her mother trying to live vicariously through her daughter.  The director/choreographer, played by Vincent Cassel, is a stereotypical jerk who will do anything to get the performance he wants.  The shining exception in BLACK SWAN is Mila Kunis as a newcomer to the company who is selected to be Nina's understudy.  She does more acting, and quite good at that, than the rest of the cast combined, including Winona Ryder as the wacked out, aging prima ballerina.

Other bright spots in BLACK SWAN include Tchaikovsky's brilliant Swan Lake score, which plays in gorgeous counterpoint to the action on screen, the exquisite dance sequences, and some very impressive and unexpected CGI.  However, these highlights are not enough for me to recommend BLACK SWAN.  And while the ending does leave you gasping, it is not in a good way.  I guess I don't want to be shaking my head at the end of a film.

The film has inspired forum upon forum to psychoanalyze ballet dancer Nina Sayres, grippingly portrayed by Natalie Portman who is sure to win the Academy Award for her performance. Nina pursues perfection in auditioning for the lead role in a production of Swan Lake. The role calls for capturing both the innocence and restraint of a white swan and the seductiveness and free spirit of the black swan. The white swan comes naturally for her; the black swan, on the other hand, calls for getting in touch with her repressed sexuality according to the production director. So begins her mental spiral due to the inevitable tension of such a high-level competition and the pressure she brings upon herself.

Black Swan sports a stellar cast that heightens the tension and tone of the film. Supporting cast members include Mila Kunis as a rival dancer and looming threat, Vincent Cassel as the manipulating production director, Barbara Hershey as the unrelentingly overbearing mother, and Winona Ryder as the exiting, ""washed up"" dancer with issues who injects guilt into Nina's pysche.

""Black Swan"" attempts to get inside the mind of a ballerina, while also creating a trippy, often erotic thriller that even mainstream audiences (not just art movie snobs) can enjoy. It's a tightrope, but Darren Aronofsky pulls it all off brilliantly, making his best film since ""Requiem for a Dream"", with the help of lead actress Natalie Portman, who gives the most impressive performance in her young career (already full of some impressive performances).

Portman plays Nina, a workaholic ballerina who seems finally ready to ascend to the lead role in ""Swan Lake"". Although, with her virginal demeanor, the slightly sadistic director thinks she'll make a perfect White Swan, he criticizes her for lacking the darkness and sexuality needed to play the role of the Black Swan. In order to give the perfect performance, tightly wound Nina needs to find the Black Swan in her, and she knows she won't find it through the hard work and discipline she usually employs.

And so it begins. The stress of finally dancing the lead in a production, coupled with Nina's drive to find the darkness within herself that she's been repressing her entire life, send her on a mental downward spiral. The film plays it all ambiguously, and it's often not clear whether what is happening is real or all in Nina's head. Even the characters around her (her stage mother, the free-spirited rival ballerina, the enraged elder ballerina Nina is replacing) can often be interpreted not as real people but as personifications of parts of Nina's own fractured psyche.

From the moment we see her at home with her overprotective, intense mother(Hershey),whose own career was displaced to have Nina,we appear to be in a world akin to Rosemary's Baby, with some of the same psychodrama at work. Thomas(Vincent Cassell),her Director of Swan Lake,is predatory, suggestive,making dancers compete with each other to win his approval. Beth(Ryder),his former chief dancer,is just retiring, setting up one resentful demonic presence in Nina's mind. Another is Lilly(Mila Kunis),the relaxed,sexy new dancer who becomes Nina's rival for the role. Thomas states Nina is perfect as the White Swan,but has not the charged sexuality of the Black Swan role. Nina is poised fearfully on the edge of an abyss of self-doubt, brittle, bulimic,tense like a coiled spring,facing up to her nightmares when she lands the dream role. She is befriended by Lilly,is told to learn to relax,use sex and a drug to unwind before she's able to give the twin-roled performance. Is Lilly usurping her place and affections in Thomas's eyes?She is gradually overtaken by paranoia.

All the time there is mounting hysteria,single-minded perfectionism,she scratches herself,pulls off her skin, drives herself through punishing routines. She experiences doppelgangers who dog her every move in the outside world or in mirrors of the dance studio. She hallucinates about what she's been doing or who she's been with. Aronofsky utilises a whirling,moving camera,playing loud the soundtrack of Swan Lake throughout,with lots of snapping,stretching noises on the soundtrack and her own heavy breathing. He cleverly uses imagery(as in The Fly) of her body metamorphosing into that of a swan. There is a nod to The Red Shoes,of the obsessive pursuit of a vocation to the point of self-destruction. Portman plays the role as if born to it. I felt a curious lack of character development(as if taking place in a vacuum)or even the impression of ensemble acting dynamics. The dancing of Portman is minimal,mainly from the shoulders up,or with blurred body doubles. There is no sense in Nina's character of the joy of art,just the gut-wrenching self discipline. However the film really comes alive when Nina becomes the Black Swan,when the full-blewn horror thriller comes finally into its own,and she seems to take wing. However the film as a film did not succeed to take wing despite brilliant moments,good casting.",1296432000,2,2668,5.322274881516588
4246087,5,B0041KKYEM,"Black Swan is one of the year's most acclaimed films, nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture. Watching it the first time I found it overrated and inferior to its companion film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wrestler/dp/B001TOD92C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wrestler</a>. Watching it a second time, I found it to be one of director Darren Aronofsky's most focused efforts. His skill and maturity as a director continues to grow and progress with each film and while it's too early to say if Black Swan is my favorite film by the man it may be his most impressive feature yet.

Natalie Portman plays Nina Sayers, a dancer at a New York ballet company. It's the beginning of a new season and the first production is of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. With the former star Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder) being cast out, the director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) must find a new dancer that can embody both the White Swan and her evil twin the Black Swan. Nina is dedicated to her craft, a perfectionist who knows every move perfectly. Newcomer Lily (Mila Kunis) is her opposite; free-spirited and effortless. Thomas knows Nina can dance the White Swan, but he's not sure she would able to convincingly dance the Black Swan. When Thomas finally casts Nina as the Swan Queen, she becomes so intent on perfecting her role that she begins transforming into the character (and what an amazing transformation it is).

Nina is a fascinating protagonist; an innocent and sexually repressed character living with a sinister, domineering mother (Barbara Hershey). Nina's fragile mental state is immediately apparent and the film being told from her perspective makes us always question whether what we're seeing is reliable. A portrait of a slow mental breakdown is nothing new in cinema, but it's the adventurous way it's handled in this film that makes it so special. Aronofsky obviously derives some inspiration from Roman Polanski, particularly Repulsion with its portrait of female sexual repression, but Black Swan doesn't descend into a retread of earlier material. It's an example of a film being culminated from various influences to create something very new and fresh.

Natalie Portman has received the majority of notice for her performance, but everyone here is worth mentioning. The stunning, beautiful Mila Kunis, in her first legitimate dramatic role, is perfect as Lily. Her character is a big part of the film, but one of the less complex roles. Still, she's a convincing opposite to Portman's Nina. Hershey is highly underrated doing some career-best work as Nina's mother. This is a stunning performance by an actress we don't see much of anymore and, in a less competitive year Hershey would've been a sure thing for an Oscar nomination. She brings such nuance to the simultaneously caring and overbearing mother role, making her loathsome yet sympathetic. Vincent Cassel is essentially playing the only male character in this film and he plays the charming, amoral, Svengali-like Thomas with a flamboyant subtlety that is brilliantly controlled and convincing. He's been accused of hamming it up, but I didn't get that impression. It's an Oscar-worthy performance that was unfortunately overlooked. Even Winona Ryder makes an impression with little screen-time.

Portman will win the Academy Award this year for her performance as Nina Sayers, not as a sympathy vote or to award her for her time in this industry, but because she gives a remarkable, psychologically complex performance and pulls it off flawlessly. Portman so completely captures Nina's fragility, innocence, and elegance while bringing her through a haunting and memorable transformation that never feels over-the-top or forced. She's so in control of her performance and, physically, she's gone out of her way to look the part as well. Already small, Portman lost 20 pounds for her role as Nina. It's a sympathetic performance of a complicated character. Nina isn't the greatest female protagonist of 2010, but Portman gives the greatest female performance of 2010. With more roles like this, Portman could establish herself as a force to be reckoned with. When Nina says ""I was perfect,"" you agree because of the job Portman has done here.

The cinematography by Matthew Libatique is very tight, emphasizing close-ups on the face, while giving the film a very raw feel. The film has a visual style that almost completely mirrors the grainy, muted look of The Wrestler, but Black Swan is a much more beautiful film. The hypnotic opening scene is so instantly intriguing it takes hold of your interest and leads you through the rest of the film. The terrific, sometimes terrifying makeup and beautiful score (which does incorporate much of the Swan Lake ballet) all lend beautifully to the tone created by Aronofsky.

Black Swan is not an easy film as it doesn't comfortably settle into any particular genre. It has the elements of a horror film and a psychological thriller but never quite falls into either genre, despite having many wince-inducing scenes. It has a European sensibility, evident in Aronofsky being influenced by Polanski's Repulsion and The Tenant and that might not sit well with some audiences. Other people may flock to the movie due to the highly publicized scene between Portman and Kunis (you know which one I'm talking about) which is neither gratuitous nor graphic and has supernatural element that may disappoint viewers hoping for something much more ""arousing.""

For me, Black Swan really achieves greatness in the final 20 minutes which I found to be some of the gripping, powerful, and fascinating minutes of any movie from 2010. Even when using CGI effects, Aronofsky manages to simultaneously evoke emotion and challenge the viewer. Few films move me to tears, but Black Swan did even while knowing what to expect. Yes, it took a second viewing for me to really appreciate this film but I found myself blown away by it. It's an amazing film, a brilliant companion piece to The Wrestler, and an emotional rollercoaster ride. Black Swan is the most profound, moving cinematic experience I've had from a 2010 film. It's less of a film than an experience.

4246088,4,B0041KKYEM,"Black Swan plays out as a feminine nightmare in which the lines between reality and the imagined become progressively warped and blurred, eventually snapping entirely. Many assuptions can be made about whether or not this film represents a female perspective of eternal pressures, or a male sexual fantasy about a frigid hard bodied ballerina desperately in need of some sexual awakening. The one thing that does not parallel male sexual fantasy, is Nina's lack of grip on reality. Craziness and drama are not sexy. I would also stress that this film does not tell you that all women are frail and neurotic, Nina certainly is, as is Beth , played by Winona Ryder, but then you have a character like Lily, played by Mila Kunis, who is shown as being quit confidently self assured. Black Swan is an individual story about an individual character that represents a particular nightmare, and is clearly not meant to represent the entire female species. Whether a film like this one makes you worry that some young girls might wrongfully identify with Nina and see her as a roll model, is not the point of this film, and should not be the focus of the films central themes. This film exists solely to give the viewer an emotional and visual psychological nightmare, that's Black Swan's amusement park ride, which it pulls off to a very decent extent. If anything, Black Swan is really just a kind of retelling of the Japanese Anime Perfect Blue, and is certainly not worthy of a crusade.

How funny is that Winona Ryder gets all upset when Nina steals from her?

Nina, who gets her big break from a NY dance company, is thrust into a roll that requires her to have split personalities. Though she is perfect for the roll of the virginal white swan, she just can't seem to embody the roll of the seductive black swan. Her push comes to shove when she meets her bold sexy polar opposite in Lily. Her already fragil mental state unravels entirely when she explores and awakens her own personal hidden dark side. The continual focus on Nina's anguished face is absolutely necessary and coincides perfectly with her claustrophobic apartment and overbearing mother. The contiual close-ups do become a bit taxing on the viewer. In fact, I started to hear my own mothers voice in my head warning me.
""If you keep making that face, it will freeze that way!""
I was worried that Nina's eyebrows might just permenantly nit together.

The sexuality in this film is something to be seen and admired, because it focuses so much more on female rather then male sensual pleasure. I was especially overjoyed to see Mila Kunis as Lily, dive on Natalie Portman's Nina. The very idea of how this moment back handed the violence loving sex hating MPAA right across the chops, had me grinning from ear to ear.

So put that in your pipe and smoke it!

The most powerful symbolic motif in this film was its use of mirrors. There are mirrors everywhere you look. These mirrors begin to quickly reflect Nina's self criticism and continually fracturing personality, while adding to the claustrophobia and paranioa closing in all around her. Even on the subway she can't escape these reflections which encompass her on all sides. This motif culminates in a rather sick moment in which a dirty old business man makes lewd obscene getsures at her on her ride home from ballet practice. Even when the camera is on her, his atrocity can be seen behind her in the reflection and vice versa. Everywhere she goes, and everything she does, eyes are on her at all times. This feeling of being continually observed is deeply embedded into the very fabric of this film. Black Swan might have the best use of this kind of mirror motif in the history of cinema, and it is easily what I enjoyed most about this film.

My one complaint about Black Swan, is something I knew was going to bother me going in. Reality gets so blurred that the supernatural significance of the hallucinations start to suffer. After a while, this film feels like it could just as well make up anything it wanted to as it went along. I never got this dissapointing feeling from Perfect Blue, which I feel has a much stronger conclusion and more valid reason for its many hallucination sequences. In Perfect Blue these nightmarish visions become the very root of the drama, in Black Swan they seem to exist mostly for effect. It is obvious to me that Black Swan barrowed heavily from Perfect Blue, but its hallucinations begin to seem random and made up on the fly. This has become a constant flaw that I have noticed in nearly every single modern film about psychological horror, had it been avoided here, I would of rated Black Swan five stars without hesitation. Regardless, Black Swan is still a very worthy movie that is going to have a special place in my DVD collection on the day that it is released. This is an effective dark nightmare that combines a great blend of beautifually choreographed dance sequences, surprising psychological shocks, and enough abject paranoia to keep the viewer delighfully disoriented from beginning to end. I definitely prefure Perfect Blue, but nonetheless, Black Swan is still a four star feature worthy of checking out.",1296432000,7,5188,4.739756367663344
4246089,5,B0041KKYEM,"This movie will do for Darren Aronofsky what Memento did for Chris Nolan! Seriously look I'm a heterosexual male, and when I heard about this movie I was like ""ewww a movie about swan lake!"" and swore that I'd never see this movie, and then I heard about the lesbian scene with Godess Natalie (Nina Sayers), and Godess Mila (Lily) and I said ""Hey I might have to see this movie now!"" so I said what the heck I can watch a movie about swan lake aslong as I see some some girl on girl action, and well while the scenes we're done pretty well it wasn't as raunchy as advertised but other then them scenes I ended up falling in love with this movie for it's sick twisted storyline, and it's amazing directing, and acting by the entire cast really makes for nothing short of a masterpiece!

Natalie Portman is sure to win best actress for this role I mean she was amazing in her role as Nina the young lady chosen to be the Swan princess. An honor which from the way it's made to look in the movie is a big big deal in that world.

I refuse to spoil anything else of the movie so all I will say is head out to this one because it's worth watching, and I can't wait until this movie is on blu ray so I could watch it in all it's glory on 1080p!

I heard talk of Darren Aronofsky possibly taking over for Nolan in the Batman series, and this movie makes me feel like that could end up working out really well. He understands how to make movies which deal with human psychology, and that is something Nolan also understands, and both his Batman movies have been very psychologically driven pictures.

Anyway everyone check out Black Swan believe it's an amazing movie.

4246090,4,B0041KKYEM,"I didn't enjoy watching Black Swan. It would not have taken much persuading me to get up and walk out. As we left the cinema, other than to remark upon its startling intensity, my initial reactions to it were mostly negative. I enjoyed it much more in the twenty four hours afterwards, unpeeling its cuticles and scratching at its feathered back. That suggests the jarring sensation is a superficial one.

It was never going to be straightforward with Darren Aronofsky at the helm. Black Swan starts out in a fairly conventional direction - the sheltered heroine battling to escape her castle - but veers off in quite another. So, we watch the unfolding petals of a cosseted young bud, kept out of the light past her date of maturity by well-intending but all the same mendacious forces. We see this charted against the depredations of her environment - there are big, bad wolves everywhere you look - and the technical and spiritual challenges she must overcome to earn her place as the prima ballerina, an award we infer is long past its due date. We see Nina battle her own demons and those of her protectors: there is self-flagellation in her insistence on technical perfection, mirrored in Nina's chastity - self imposed, we suspect - but it is all reinforced by a text-book neurotic, over-protective, historically harmed mother. In a way her mother's behaviour is a sort of vicarious self-flagellation too: Nina is simply the unfortunate vehicle for working out her mother's own self torment.

So much, so conventional: as the drama shifts onto Monsieur Leroy, the darkly charged womaniser of a ballet director. He is everything Nina is not: he represents everything she is afraid of: passion: licentiousness.  We first meet him pawing his stable of swans, like a Siamese King inspecting his harem. He's a tease, too: those he has *not* patted can report to his chamber at sundown. There is an uneasy equilibrium, though, in the same way there is between lions and gazelles in the Serengeti: this is an ecosystem, and for it to function it must be so.

And then, breaking up the order and hierarchy is a new dancer, flown in to neurotic New York from free-loving West Coast San Francisco to deputise for an injured dancer. In case that wasn't enough of a clue, we're told in an off-stage exchange between Leroy and Nina, she is a free spirit: she may not have all nina's the technical chops, but she *feels it*. She can, Leroy remarks teasingly, let herself go.

He tells Nina more than once she is his perfect white swan. But he has trouble seeing the dark alter ego she must inhabit to play the Black Swan.

There you have it: a white swan, a black one (though of course it doesn't play out as straightforwardly as that), a wicked witch, Bluebeard. Enough dramatic impetus to last you a week. And boy does Aronofsky deliver it, too: you get that impetus focussed and concentrated into a two hour spell, which is about as intense an experience as you could ask for. This is Scotty in the engine room material: any more, captain, and she'll blow.

Aronofsky adds another level of doubt by interposing a layer of fantasy here too. From the opening scene - a dream - we know Nina has an active subconscious, and we're not clear in early exchanges what is ""real"" and what is not. This extrapolates unhappily, however: as the flood waters of Nina's neuroticism rise, a fertile imagination gives way to active hallucination, which eventually canters onwards into a diagnosable psychotic episode. Intensity to the max, but it undermines the dramatic development. Was that her mother sleeping in a chair in her room while she fantasised? Was she just fantasising? Or was she fantasising about fantasising?

Now once or twice that sort of ambiguity would be ok: adding a little uncertainty to further pique the raging intensity (not, though, like the picture needed it). But Aronofsky over-uses the trick: the default assumption becomes is hallucination. This alleviates, rather than builds, tension.

There is a profound undercurrent of ickiness: the self flagellation, per his previous picture,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wrestler/dp/0847832430/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wrestler</a>, becomes self-harming. But it feels unnecessary: guignol for the sake of it. The purely ballet-oriented gruelitudes (particularly the punishment a ballerina administers to her feet) are enough make this point without the (usually illusory) woundings. In sensationalising this way Aronofsky cheapens his art: he cuts it with hyperbole. Likewise with some of the eroticisms: no red-blooded fellow will completely object to being asked to watch Natalie Portman's onanstic activities (and more!), but Aronofsky goes beyond what is strictly necessary for his statement, even if he doesn't ever quite let Nina get to hers (all the more tension!): It is a little artistically voyeuristic.

Because of all his mucking about in mental hyperspace, where we don't know what's real and what's not, Aronofsky's climax misses its beat profoundly. It's a silly, trite, implausible ending - the credits fade up and it feels like a ten-ton weight has been dropped on the picture, Monty Python style.

Is it a good film? Yes. It's a very good film, though I think I'd take a certain amount of evasive action to avoid watching it again. Is it great one? That I'm not so sure about.

Although this story is about ballet, the rehearsal and backstage scenes reminded me of my opera chorus experiences. However, those experiences made me question the accuracy of showing a principal alone in a dressing room without assistance with makeup or costume changes. The plot depended on her being alone.

STARRING: Natalie Portman, Milla Kunis, Vincent Castle, Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder

WRITTEN BY: Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz and John J. McLaughlin

DIRECTED BY: Darren Aronofsky

Rated: R
Genre: Drama / Thriller
Release Date: 17 December 2011
Review Date: 14 January 2011

Black Swan was a good movie, but it wasn't as great as everyone's making it out to be and it certainly wasn't filled with all the risqu sex you've been hearing about. I'll go on record saying - there is no sex in the movie at all.  There are some pretty steamy close calls and a very erotic moment of Natalie Portman alone in her bedroom - but no sex. What a bummer.

I only mention this because the movie is oozing with sex appeal and it is drenched with the anticipation of sex to come, without the payoff. This is something that the film forced me to expect Portman's character to embellish in. Luckily it makes up for this with an Oscar worthy performance by Portman (for which I'm sure she'll win), and an equally amazing directorial consummation by Darren Aronofsky who also brought us 2008's The Wrestler.

I'm sorry, but I refuse to jump on the band wagon of those who claim Milla Kunis is warranted a nod as well; my gut tells me the bitchy role comes pretty natural to her, and if I'm wrong, it's nothing we haven't already seen her do once or twice.

So I'll continue by stating that Portman stars as our lead character Nina and Kunis is her costar, Lilly. Nina is the nice girl; Lilly, the bitch. They both are interested in the same lead role in a ballet play called Black Swan. When Nina wins the role over Lilly and everyone else, there is some hostility to say the least.

Nina is very grateful to be given a shot as prestigious as this, and she shows this to us in an instant flood of tears in a private bathroom stall. Lilly matches Nina's gratefulness, with endless looks of cold jealousy, to which Nina seems to not know what to do with, nor does she really sense the girl that Lilly really is, when they begin to hang out together.

This is what draws us in to Portman's portrayal of Nina. She's shy, timid, probably a virgin, and we get the sense that she's uncomfortable in her own skin. So much in fact, that she often picks at it, to the point of drawing blood. She lives with her mother (Barbara Hershey) who is smothering and controlling nearly to the extent of a villain in any number of Disney classic evil step mothers.

Everything in Nina's world evolves around her work as a ballet dancer. Her mother is infatuated with the details of her long days in rehearsals, as she gave up a similar dream years ago, to take care of Nina. For that there is some bitter resentment.

Nina is a grown woman, but her mother does not like the idea of locked doors, and we get the notion that she cleans Nina's room for her too, which is overly stocked with stuffed animals and child like trinkets. There has been no sex in this room, and there shant ever be. So you can imagine the shock of Nina's mother when she brings someone home with her after a night of drinking, and jerry-rigs the door shut.

Nina has done this because she is becoming invested in her character to the point of mad obsession. The play calls for Nina to begin the first act as a `white swan' who is an innocent, to which she will transform into a `black swan' who is evil, and then kill herself when her lover has betrayed her for another woman.

This movie is very bizarre and I liked it; particularly trying to figure out just what the hell was going on. It's twisted and dark and will only continue to gain more popularity as the word of so spreads.

Credit is due to Darren Aronofsky, because now that I think about it, I'm never a fan of the subject matter in any of his films: professional wrestling in The Wrestler, drug addiction in Requiem for a Dream, and ballet dancing here; but yet I found all three films entertaining to include their subject matter.",1296259200,3,3943,4.410468319559229
4246093,5,B0041KKYEM,"The film's camera chillingly stalks Nina's face and the back of her head. It also shows blurry reflections, not direct visualization, of characters in mirrors, very strange. The setting confines itself to Nina's home and the theater. There's little connection with the outside world and about Nina's bio. But this shows that the film is extremely focused on Nina's constant stress and mental breakdown. Thus, the audience can only sympathize her insanity. In fact, the film metaphorically interprets and visualizes her self-created illusions. The film is very cruel in exploring her misguided imagination. Overall, ""Black Swan"" will seem unorthodox and uncomfortable.

What I got was:

Grainy picture, handheld camera work so bouncy I had to look away from the screen or upchuck my $6.00 popcorn. Why was the camera man so fixated on the nape of Portman's neck???? and why was ever other scene a severe closeup?

Lots of blood (Lots!) from self-mutilation to hallucinated murders of rejecting lesbian lovers and (I think?) a suicide at the end?

More masturbation scenes than I cared to see. The audience was uncomfortable to say the least.

Unfortunately I got duped by Oscar hype. This wasn't an adult drama, but somewhere between soft porn and teen-aged splatter movies and some sci-fi thrown in (Nina morphing into a black swan at the end.)

And the back-stabbing, gossiping, jealous little ballet cats. Who in their right minds would go into ballet dancing if this is how it is?????? I came away thinking this isn't high art, it's HIGH SCHOOL revisited!!!

Those who don't feel what is depicted have more than likely not pushed themselves into the realm of the highly creative nor intensely compelled, whether their work is acting, ballet, playwriting, writing librettos and lyrics for musical theatre, architecture, music composition, fine-art painting, even mathematics demanding insight and intuition.

To succeed in competition and in achieving excellence in an artistic endeavor requires surpassing all others around you, in duration and intensity of focus, in depth of introspection, reaching into the most subtle and abstract qualities of your art, as well as the most visceral, heightening perceptions and skills beyond those of others also striving for and achieving your high art.

This promises the artist unequaled ecstasy and also lays the trap of vulnerability to unimaginable depression, just as is shown in Black Swan. If you challenge this, read a bit of history of the Masters in art, music, dance and poetry.  The psychology of creativity - - manic depression and suicide line the road we travel.

In this sense knowledge is truly strength.

As practicing artists, the more we learn of this, the stronger and more capable we become to deal with it. Teachers in the creative arts need this knowledge as a resource, as do practicing psychologists.

My only criticism of the movie is of the last scene.  Would someone be able to perform the ballet scene so injured?  Or is that scene part of the delusion also?

The artists who created this movie though their sensitivity and courageousness have my profound thanks.

Black Swan is a masterwork though not every person may be prepared to see it.",1296000000,7,1870,5.155629139072848
4246101,4,B0041KKYEM,"""Black Swan"" is an amazing cinematic experience, if not a particularly original one.  In this compelling film, director Aronofsky successfully weds his trademark gritty realism with themes, characters, and visual motifs originally manifested in the classic works of directors such as Clouzot, Hitchcock, Polanski . . . and especially Brian DePalma, master of the explicit 1970s psycho-sexual thriller.  Of course, ""Black Swan"" is clearly an homage to these filmmakers and their works, so half the fun of the film lies in identifying its numerous allusions (""Diabolique,"" ""Frenzy,"" ""The Tenant,"" ""Dressed to Kill,"" etc.).  Beyond its inspirations, however, the film is brilliantly written, shot, scored, and acted--and ultimately, it melds its fantastic visceral content with thought-provoking ruminations on the nature of obsession and art.  Great flick.",1295913600,3,854,5.808
4246102,4,B0041KKYEM,"It's hard to know how many stars to give ""Black Swan."" Three seems too low for a movie that held me riveted for its entire running time. Five seems too high for something so fundamentally over-the-top crazy. So I settled on four.

Natalie Portman, ideally cast, gives a forehead-vein-popping performance as Nina Sayres. Nina is a beautiful, obsessively driven, self-mutilating ballerina trying to get the Swan Queen lead in a production of Tchaikovsky's ""Swan Lake."" I used to think Portman was pretty but painfully dull. Here, she's horrifying and fascinating. Her long-necked, uber-thin body makes her a perfect physical fit. Every look, every word she speaks in her timorous little voice, every gesture, is a perfectly shattered reflection of her character's neuroses.

Nina has a warped, guilt-driven relationship with her single mother Erica (Barbara Hershey). Erica sacrificed her own dance career to raise Nina. Nina, at age 28, still lives with Erica in a pink cotton candy bedroom that appears not to have been redecorated since Nina was about 9. Erica breathes, lives and dies through Nina's successes and failures and never hesitates to let Nina know it. In one scene, Erica bakes Nina a birthday cake. Nina, always dieting, says she can't eat it. The ensuing explosion tells you all you need to know about Nina and her mother, but there are many more scenes like it.

The seductive French (what else?) director of Nina's ballet company tells Nina that she's a shoe-in for the virginal White Swan, but needs to explore her erotic side to play the Black Swan. Nina knows that at 28 she's getting on in years in the insanely competitive world of professional ballet, and this is a make-or-break part for her. She has never done anything but practice and live with her mother. The movie explores the madness that ensues when Nina pushes past her boundaries to embody the Black Swan.

The film has a simple color palette of black, white, red and pink, and low lighting that makes it appear to have been  photographed through a tarnished mirror. Mirrors and blood are the recurring visual motifs.

""Black Swan,"" is a freak show. If you need further proof, Winona Ryder, of all people, is cast as the washed-up older ballerina Nina is replacing. Unless you're a better person than I, your morbid curiosity won't let you turn away. As is usually the case with freak shows, ""Black Swan"" fails to elicit any real empathy for any of its characters--pity is not the same thing as empathy--which is why it ends up being sickly hilarious. I expect to see it someday on the camp horror shelf alongside ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane"" and ""The Bad Seed."" If you like that sort of thing, and I have a sufficiently twisted sense of humor that I can really get into it, ""Black Swan"" is well worth your time.

Sufficiently erotic and gruesome that parents should see it themselves before deciding whether to let their children see it. I would not show it to a kid under 15 myself.",1295913600,29,2974,4.796875
4246103,2,B0041KKYEM,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Who knew? Rather than a profession peopled with a crew of dedicated professionals, the ballet world, according to director Darren Aronofsky, really consists of a bunch of back-stabbing bitches, self-mutilating neurotics, sleazy artistic directors and a 'Stage Mom' from hell.

Black Swan has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer in this one-note tale of a dancer's quest to come out on top as she pursues the lead role in Swan Lake for a prominent (unnamed) NYC ballet company. The film is really supposed to be a cautionary tale about people who will stop at nothing to further their careers. Ironically, Natalie Portman (as the protagonist, Nina Sayers) worked herself out like a dog in order to replicate the look of a full-time ballet dancer; many internet posters have commented how unhealthy she looks on screen and seems to be just as guilty as the character she plays (where Nina will stop at nothing to become the so-called 'Swan Queen', Ms. Portman has worked herself to the bone in the quest for Oscar Gold!).

Vincent Cassell plays the sleazy artistic director of the company, Thomas Leroy. Leroy has no qualms about throwing the over-the-hill principal dancer, Beth Macintrye (played by a way over the top Winona Ryder) under the bus after deciding that the younger Nina must now carry the torch. His decision is not immediate as he has reservations about whether Nina can actually play the darker 'Black Swan' part. He senses that things aren't right with Nina as she is unable to 'let herself go'. The consummate professional that he is, Leroy instructs Nina to go home and masturbate which will help her to get in touch with her more spontaneous self. When he gives her pointers on the dance floor, he says things like, ""Use each finger, your face, your tits, everything. Entice me!"" Nina finally gets the role when Leroy tests her by attempting to kiss her while they're alone--in response, Nina bites him on the lip (that proves to Leroy, believe it or not, that Nina has what it takes!).

Also in the mix is Nina's pushy mother, Erica, who she lives with in a small, unattractive apartment. The mother wanted to be a ballet dancer but never made it and ended up pushing Nina to become the driven artiste she has become. It's clear that Erica is unconsciously jealous of her daughter's success but I can't agree with others who have suggested there is an incestuous sub-text here. If anything, Nina's mother is extremely upset over the evidence that Nina has been self-mutilating and is now trying to get her to slow down and take care of herself.

Finally, there's Lily, Nina's rival from San Francisco who Leroy names as alternate in the Swan Lake production. Lily sports a bunch of tattoos and has a mouth like one of the performers you might find on 'Jersey Shore'. Nina hallucinates having a steamy sexual encounter with Lily but soon finds out that it was all in her mind.

Throughout 'Black Swan', Nina keeps imagining seeing her double which unnerves her no end. Aronofsky deceptively leads us to believe that Nina harbors murderous impulses. Prior to the climax, Nina fights with her double who morphs into Lily. It then appears that Nina stabs Lily to death just prior to the opening night performance. But during intermission, Lily knocks on Nina's dressing room door making it quite clear that Lily's murder was just another one of Nina's hallucinations. It turns out that Lily is not a murderer at all--rather, the murderous impulses were simply a reflection of Nina's own self-hatred. She ends up stabbing herself prior to going back out for the second act and presumably is found bleeding to death as the curtain descends and the oblivious audience roars their approval.

Nina's last words regarding her performance was that ""it was perfect"". The irony of course is that although achieving her goal of mastering the role of the 'Black Swan', she sacrifices her life. In real life, those who give up a piece of themselves for their ambition, don't usually kill themselves. Rather, they end up with a feeling of a self-satisfaction and achievement of their goals. It's of course for others to judge them whether their rise to the top was conducted with a modicum of moral integrity.

In the end, there are few surprises here as Nina's self-destructive internal arc is played out as if someone kept hitting the repeat button on a video monitor. All those scratch marks and peeling toenails become tedious after awhile and the potential tempting plot that Nina's actions might lead to a murder investigation turns out to be nothing more than a big tease on the part of director Aronofsky.

Some may feel that Nina is the epitome of a tragic heroine--she accomplishes her goal of mastering a difficult dramatic part but throws away her life at the same time. If you are going to have a heroine who is self-destructive, why not model your character on Tennessee Wiliam's Blanche Dubois? Her back story is a real one as opposed to the one-note Nina, molded by a stereotyped Stage Mother from hell.

The frenetic pacing of the Black Swan narrative will hold your interest to the end but the ride is decisively creepy. Has Aronofsky created a true cautionary tale on the dangers of careerism? Or does he revel in the excesses that he is supposedly criticizing? Somehow, all the gory goings on in The Black Swan don't seem to be a very appropriate venue for the dignified world of ballet. Better to catch a young Mickey Rourke in 'Angel Heart' if you desire a blood-fest that's a tad bit more creative.",1295740800,14,5565,4.7875

Natalie Portman - an actress I'm not that enamored with - gives the performance of a lifetime as the ballerina who is steadily and rapidly breaking down psychologically. The movie joyfully toys with what is real and what is her illusion and, even though the black swan/white swan concept is somewhat in your face, the twists and surprises kept me guessing as to what was real and what was not. The supporting cast does stellar work, particularly Barbara Hershey as Portman's controlling mother and fading prima ballerina Winona Ryder. But it's the vision and Portman's riveting performance that were so compelling and captivating.
I recommend the theater if possible as the experience is so much greater when you find yourself lost in this oft-surreal world. For what it's worth, I saw True Grit and enjoyed it. Black Swan was immensely better. This is one I will surely buy when it comes out on dvd. Highly recommended.",1295654400,3,1191,4.8431372549019605

I might be off on this, but it's like 'A Clockwork Orange' and 'Burlesque' mixed together in a psychological thriller. Portman stars as Nina, a ballet dancer who must compete for the main lead in the Swan Lake play. Nina's mother is very controlling and treats her like a child. (Similar to Carrie White's mother) Nina starts having hallucinations and becomes paranoid because she really wants the part of both the White and Black Swan. I would recommend BLACK SWAN!!!!!!!!!!

The film succeeds at thrusting the viewer into the world of a woman who is achieving her dream, which turns out to be more of a nightmare. The strange psychotic episodes that she endures blur the line between fantasy and reality for not only her, but the audience.

4246108,5,B0041KKYEM,"Black Swan (Darren Aronofsky, 2010)

There are professions where, while people claim to look on in horror, it is an accepted tradition that young girls are, for all intents and purposes, locked away and made slaves in service of their craft. Gymnastics is the classic, and most widely-publicized, example thanks to a few Eastern European tyrant coaches, but figure skating and ballet are two others that come to mind pretty readily. You have to wonder how much Andres Heinz (whose only previous credit is as director; he was responsible for the highly underrated 1998 film The Origin of the Species), who wrote both the original story upon which this film is based and co-wrote the screenplay adapted from it, was thinking of Bela Karolyi when creating the character of Tomas. Vincent Cassel, who plays Tomas, has said in interviews he was thinking Balanchine, natch, but IMDB reports the original script was theatrical, not ballet-based, so I'm giving Heinz a little more leeway in his influences. One way or the other, what we have here in Black Swan is a typical ""girl coming out of her shell"" script... but then, nothing is typical in the world of Darren Aronofsky. The word ""visionary"" is overused indeed when it comes to directors, but look at what Aronofsky and the stable he keeps close around him (most notably composer Clint Mansell, who once again turns in a top-notch score) have accomplished in the past ten years and tell me it doesn't apply. Where body-horror auteur David Cronenberg abandoned body horror when he moved onto his brilliant realist films of the past decade, Aronofsky has spent the same decade figuring out how to integrate Cronenberg's vision of body horror into realistic movies. (Think about Jared Leto's arm during the last half-hour of Requiem for a Dream.) Black Swan, with everything from its depictions of common ballet injuries to the infamous final scene of the trailer, is his fullest realization of Cronenberg's tradition yet. And yet no one could ever possibly mistake this for a David Cronenberg film; it is Darren Aronofsky through and through.

Nina Sayers (The Professional's Natalie Portman, recently of The Other Boleyn Girl) is a ballet dancer. She's dedicated, but she hasn't garnered the respect that her mother (The Last Temptation of Christ's Barbara Hershey) thinks she deserves. Is she right? (Note that she says Nina is the company's most dedicated dancer, not their most talented.) We don't know, not really. I'm assuming you, like me, are not a ballet dancer yourself. One way or the other, though, Tomas (Cassel, recently of Cronenberg's Eastern Promises), the tyrannical head of the company, decides to cast Nina in the lead role in his new, ""stripped down, real"" production of Swan Lake over the girl he'd previously chosen, Veronica (the gorgeous Ksenia Solo, in her first big-screen role since 2003's The Republic of Love). We find out quickly enough that he has a number of reasons for this, very few of which seem to have to do with Nina's innate talent. In fact, he tells her on a number of occasions that while her icy control is perfect for the role of the white swan, there's not enough true passion in her to correctly dance the role of the evil-twin black swan. And thus, as I said at the beginning, the story of the girl coming out of her shell. She's helped along by Lilly (The Book of Eli's Mila Kunis), the troupe's newest member, as well as by Tomas' attempts at seduction and her finally deciding that her mother's stifling her. But as the pressure mounts, Nina finds herself moving farther and farther from the world of the stripped-down and the real...

Fifteen year ago, Vincent Cassel--son of the great French actor Jean-Pierre Cassel--popped up in Mathieu Kassovitz' first film, La Haine, playing a wannabe gangster, racist, and all-around scummy guy. He was absolutely brilliant, and it was obvious that of the trio of leads from that movie, Cassel was going to be the one who would go on to at least indie stardom. (Hubert Kounde is doing a successful turn in French television these days, while Said Tagmoui has become a reliable character actor). Since then, Cassel has made some resounding successes (Sheitan, Eastern Promises) and some dismal failures (Derailed, anything with the word ""Ocean's"" in its title), but never has he owned a role the way he did Vinz... up to now. Tomas is slick where Vinz was rough, but the same snake writhes under the surface, and Vincent Cassel knows how to play that snake. Moreover, Cassel was about as perfect a choice for the role as one could get; he's sexy, but in that low-rent way that turns so well into disgusting-homeless-guy (viz. Sheitan). He's not a classy seducer, he's rough sex in smoke-filled bathrooms (viz. Irreversible, and I will leave you to decide whether that was a success or a failure). But Tomas is, in the small world of his ballet company, a rock star, and Nina sees none of that griminess both inherent in Tomas and that Cassel brings to the role. On the other side of the coin you have Lilly, for whom the term ""low rent"" could have been coined. She says ""bad influence"" from the moment you meet her, with those big black wings tattooed on her back, and you know that if Nina gets tangled up with her, things will not end well. But you also know that Nina, so desperate to get out from under her mother's thumb, is absolutely going to get tangled up with Lilly.

What I'm telling you here, other than that if Vincent Cassel doesn't pick up a Best Actor nom a lot of people in the Academy should be dropped off moving buses, is that there's nothing here you haven't seen before, nothing you haven't read in a dozen Angela Carter fairy-tale retellings. Hell, nothing you don't know from Swan Lake, except that it would be quite a stretch of the imagination to cast either Tomas or Lilly in anything other than a shade of grey far deeper than that to which Nina's clothes have progressed by the end of the film. This movie doesn't deserve the slew of Oscars it should get because it's telling you an original story. It deserves them because of how Aronofsky is telling you that story, because of all the little touches far more subtle than split toenails and tattoos of black wings. Because, according to IMDB, Aronofsky was actively pitting Portman and Kunis against one another backstage to heighten tension on the set. Because the physical-therapy scene was real (Portman dislocated a rib onset). Because everyone in this movie nails their roles (and did I neglect to mention Winona Ryder as the bitter drunk ex-principal, and all the glorious meta under the hood there?). Because even though you have to know what's coming on some level, especially after that last scene in the hospital where Aronofsky comes so dangerously close to overplaying his hand, that last scene in the dressing room still comes as enough of a surprise that you realize that, as in all the best films of this type, you were hoping Aronofsky would cheat and hand you a different climax, even though that would have made this not nearly as good a film as it is. (And come on, did you really expect the guy who gave you Jennifer Connelly cuddling with a bag of heroin, blissful expression on her face, at the end of Requiem for a Dream--and the dirty, disgusting, utterly sexy scene before it--to pull a single punch anywhere in this film? It is testament to the greatness of Darren Aronofsky that I most certainly did.) Because of the delicious little details. (""What happened?"" ""[sigh] I have a life. You work too hard."") Because Black Swan is the best thing I've seen on the big screen in first run since El Laberinto del Fauno four years ago, and the best film I've seen in any format from 2010 (to be fair, as of this writing, I haven't yet seen the two films that word on the street says may beat it for the Oscar, The King's Speech and Blue Valentine, nor have I seen Poetry). Because Darren Aronofsky did what I didn't think he could: he made a better film than Requiem for a Dream. It is not a perfect film, but it's as close to it as America has seen in ten years. It is beautiful and brutal and deeply, deeply affecting, and you must see it. **** ",1295395200,3,8184,4.704323570432357
4246109,4,B0041KKYEM,"""Black Swan = intense""
Those were the words used by my cousin on her fb status to describe the movie right after watching it on the theater and I think is the best description anyone can give it.

Stripped down ""Black Swan"" is pretty simple, a ballerina trying perfect her art. Most of the film is exclusively Portman's viewpoint. We get to see how unstable she is but I rarely got to understand what she was actually feeling. For the life of me I have no idea if she loved the mom or hated her same with the instructor or if she even considered Mila a friend. Maybe I'm not Avant-garde enough to get all the intricacies of the character or maybe there isn't much more to gather...

In any case where Black Swan triumphantly succeeds is in its execution. Aronofsky elegantly follows Portman's every step like a shadow of her darker self waiting for the right moment to come out. His camera movements are truly a stroke of genius. Even on the dancing numbers there is so much fluidity, its such a treat to see not only the characters waltz through with the music but the cameras too.

As the movie progresses the tension increases too until it reaches boiling points. As the events continued I kept going omg omg something big is going to happen [spoiler] the mom is going to end up killing her, she is going to end up being Beth's alter ego, , I think I saw a monster on the trailer oh man when is it going to appear but like that Family Guy spoof section of Jedi where everyone signals each other for 5 minutes before executing the plan to rescue Luke. The build up was bigger than the execution. Not that the final act wasn't cool because I did like it but the build up was unnecessarily inflated.
[/spoiler]

All in all a well done film. Kinda like Kill Bill where you take a simple story but elevate it to awesomeness by making it artistically beautiful and engaging. But Kill Bill was better ;)",1295395200,4,1899,4.386363636363637
4246110,3,B0041KKYEM,"If I could have avoided all of the hype that's been buzzing about over Black Swan, I would have. It's just that with this film being up for so many awards, it's been absolutely impossible to avoid all of the people gushing ""this movie is so awesome- Portman is amazing!"" Unfortunately this just didn't fully live up to the hype for me.

The movie's story is a good one, with Portman playing a beautiful & talented ballerina who may or may not be getting harassed by a more talented peer. When the suspense does kick in, it's a very good film. However, for every good moment of suspense there's just as many where not much really happens & I sort of sat around waiting for anything, something to occur to help move the plot along. Portman does do a wonderful job with the film & when the movie hits its high notes it's a very well done film. It's just that there's too many moments where nothing happens & the film just gets a little repetitive at times. The movie is almost 2 hours long but felt more like 3, but not in a good way.

I do have to say one thing about the film- the ending is incredibly well done & is truly the highlight of the movie. I just wish that it didn't feel like it took so long to get to it. The choreography is also something to be admired & like I said above, when the movie gets into it's groove the suspense & tragedy really does hit you pretty hard. I also have to admire Winona Ryder's role in this film- she plays a ballerina past her prime that loses everything to Portman's character & she does an awesome job of it.

Maybe it's all of the hype that ruined the experience for me- I just kept expecting it to be this amazing experience & perhaps later on down the road I'll have a better time rewatching it. For now, though I have to say that this film will really only be appreciated by a certain group of people. Those who are going in hopes of it being some high tension film or a movie where something happens all the time will be highly disappointed.",1295308800,3,1988,4.21259842519685
4246111,4,B0041KKYEM,"In the first half of this film I felt like I was locked in a room with the air being slowly drawn out.  It's hard to take.  You feel sorry for Nina (played perfectly by Portman), the talented ballerina who's trapped in a situation and buffeted by too many strong forces for her young life.  She is fanatical about ballet and perfects herself to the point of neurosis. Her mother (Hershey), whom she lives with, is smothering and over-controlling.  Her fellow ballerinas are jealous and bitchy, and she has an arrogant, predatory director who hits on his young female employees and who's constantly harping on her to be loosen up (he calls her frigid in front of a male dancer), be more sexual and less cautious.  I'm thinking all the time how Nina's life seems trapped in a box surrounded by all these pushy jerks, which makes me feel trapped as well.

A ""bad girl"" (Lily; who's quite the hottie, very flirtatious & takes drugs) comes strolling into the company and befriends Nina, but you don't know if she's doing it to help her or to manipulate her.

Nina gets the nod to play the Swan in Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake, while Lily is the understudy.  Nina is a natural for the ""White Swan"" role but she appears too inexperienced and tentative to play the seductive ""Black Swan"".  More tension is added when you think that Lily is having a sexual affair with the director Tomas (played with European arrogance and flair by Vincent Cassel), to influence him to give her the role of the Swan, instead of Nina.  All throughout the movie you're wondering if Nina can pull off the ""Black"" role whilst under this incredible pressure and personal conflict.

< Spoilers Below >
The kicker is that Portman's character starts becoming (more) psychotic and you don't know in any given scene if she's hallucinating or it's real.  The hallucinogenic scenes start becoming more intense after Lily takes Nina out on the town and slips some drug into her drink, which makes you question Lily's motives in befriending Nina.  These scenes of psychosis/hallucination involve her mutilating her hands, watching an aging ballerina stabbing herself, experiencing a very realistic lesbian sex scene, and the final traumatic scene.  I think that the film over-does the hallucinations, but it certainly adds loads of suspense to the second half, leading up to the shocker of the finale, which I won't disclose.  The shock of the last scene coincides with the climax of the Tchaikovsky ballet & music (and crowd), which really pumps the viewer up emotionally.  The finale is nicely done!

HOWEVER, after it's all done, you wonder what message was conveyed.  The protagonist has MANY things that are strongly needed by American teens today:  she's disciplined, has a work ethic, a close relationship with her mother, she's doesn't do casual sex and and no drugs or alcohol.  The movie, to teenage girls (or anybody) conveys the message that people like that (""good girls"") are messed up.  So she's portrayed as being psychotic.  Her ""bad girl"" opposite sleeps around (probably with her Boss), uses sex to get what she wants & takes drugs.  She's portrayed as the ""cool"" one, the mentally stable, confident girl.  IN REALITY, the sleep-around girl will get STDs and/or get drug addicted or other such societal diseases (think Linsey Lohan).  Also in reality, the cool director who hits on ballerinas is going to get sued big time. Also IN REALITY, most women who are disciplined, talented, and close to their parents will do much better at work and life.

But it's the ""good"" girl who is portrayed as going waaaay to far the other way in this film.  MESSAGE:  ""Only the good die young!  Loosen up and be a hedonist!  Sleep around, sleep with your Boss, and don't get hung up!""  So the message is hard to swallow.

In summary, I liked the emotional kick that ""Black Swan"" gave me, it's a suspensful story, but with a message that I don't like.  Is it Oscar material?  I think that Portman and Cassel should be considered for Oscars, but the movie relies too much on hallucinations and shock scenes to win Best Picture.",1295222400,2,4085,4.772079772079772
4246112,5,B0041KKYEM,"What a crazy, but wonderful, movie (and I am not a big fan of thrillers but Darren Aronofsky can almost make a fan out of a non believer) and this is one of Natalie Portman's best performances to date (""Closer"" is also on that list) and she deserves all her raves she has gotten. This is the only performance (other than Annette Bening in ""The Kid's Are All Right"") who deserves the Best Actress Oscar this year.
The film first introduces us to Nina Sayers (Portman) who is a member of the corps de ballet of a company in New York living with her mother, (portrayed amazingly by Barbara Hershey...who deserves a Supporting Actress nod) a failed dancer herself living through her talented daughter.
The ballet is starting its new season with a production of ""Swan Lake"" and the retirement of principal dancer Beth (a recent AWOL Winona Ryder) and the director Thomas(Vincent Cassel) tells Nina she would be the Perfect White swan (the body of naivety and innocence)but lacks the passion to play the counter part, the Black Swan but newcomer Lily (Mila Kunis) does. He tries to test Nina but kissing her and in turn she bites his lip...causing her to get cast.
As Thomas continues to pursue and test Nina (not limiting to masturbation) and get her to come out her shell, Nina begins to have hallucinations that Lily wants to take her role (not limiting seeing herself in Lily and her mother's artwork coming to life)
One night Lily shows up at Nina's apartment wanting to take Nina out on the town and after overpowering her mother, Nina goes out. The girls proceed to go to a club and take ecstasy and return to Nina's and have sex. The next morning Nina oversleeps and rushes to rehearsal and sees Lily in her place. When Nina confronts Lily about not waking her up, Lily is confused and says she hooked up with a guy from the club. Nina and Lily's hook up was another hallucination.
A few nights before the opening Nina goes to visit a hospitalized Beth (who was hit by a car...thought by Thomas to be deliberate and a result of Beth's instability). While Nina is placing a nail file (among other items from Beth's dressing room) on a table in Beth's room, Beth reaches out and starts to stab herself. Nina runs out of the room and discovers she is carrying the bloody file.
The night before the opening Nina has some of her strongest hallucinations thus far as she is practicing. Her eyes become red and swan like, her legs becoming contorted like a swan, and she pulls a black feather from a persistent rash on her shoulder. The next night Nina overpowers her mother again (who called and said Nina was too ill to perform) and goes to the performance.
During the first act Nina's partner drops her during a lift and Nina retreats to her dressing room in anger to transform from the White Swan to the Black Swan. Lily knocks on her door dressed in the Black Swan costume and Nina's rage comes to head as she shoves Lily into the dressing mirror and subsequently stabs her in the abdomen, killing her and hiding her body. Nina goes out and brilliantly performs the Black Swan number, turning into a swan. Nina rushes back to get ready for the final act when there is another knock on the door. It is a very alive and well Lily coming to congratulating her. Nina sees that the mirror is STILL broke but looks down and sees she stabbed HERSELF. Nina goes out and does the final act and as the White Swan commits suicide by going over a cliff, the mortally wounded Nina falls into the hidden mattresses. The curtain drawn the company gathers around her and Thomas ask ""How did you feel"" and Nina responses with ""I Was Perfect"" (achieving her dream of perfection) before the screen goes white.
Overall...lots of twist and turns that are unexpected and head scratching. While Natalie's performance was great and the dedication is to be admired, it is really hard to say if she will beat Annette. The supporting cast (in particular Winona and Barbara) are what carry this movie. I do recommend this movie...another one of the best of the year!",1295222400,,4038,4.5633608815427
4246113,5,B0041KKYEM,"""Black Swan"" is the ballet as horror story. Early on in the film we're told the plot of ""Swan Lake."" It's a story of a princess who is transformed into a swan. And only the love of a prince can break the spell, but she's betrayed by her evil twin and kills herself by throwing herself off a cliff, after losing her love, and herself. ""Black Swan"" parallels that story.

Nina (Natalie Portman) is a dancer in the New York Ballet who is on the edge of getting the role that she's worked all her life to get, that of the Swan Queen in ""Swan Lake."" Battling an overprotective mother, Erica (Barbara Hershey) who has pushed her daughter towards perfection, Nina runs into a potential rival and friend in Lily (Mila Kunis). In Nina's efforts to be perfect in the dance she has driven herself to the edge of sanity and she starts having episodes that seem real but aren't. It's difficult to tell the difference as Nina moves seamlessly between reality and dream states. This isn't about Nina's descent into madness. When the movie starts she's already on the edge and looking over the cliff.

""Black Swan"" is definitely the apex of Portman's acting career (so far). She uses her face to full advantage. Having rigorously worked out to look the part of the ballerina, Portman is lean and muscular and the fine, delicate bone structure of her face is accentuated. She gracefully moves her head like a swan which adds to the building of the character. Portman goes through a range of emotions, from delicately vulnerable to madness and they're reflected in her face. I think she actually uses a minimum of words, but still brings Nina fully to life. Barbara Hershey as Nina's mother has echoes from ""Carrie"" in her performance, and in director Darren Aronofsky's choice of shots in their apartment.

As Nina begins to come unhinged she has a hard time discerning reality from the unreal, and so does the viewer. I don't remember the last time a movie had me so fooled as to what was `real' and what wasn't. A lot of the credit for that needs to go to director Darren Aronofsky. He has many nuanced and subtle touches that are clues as to what's going on that another director might want to call attention to, but Aronofsky has confidence in what he's doing and in the audience's ability to pick up on them. Aronofsky has made a ""Sunset Boulevard"" for the ballet with the madness full on. And you thought the ballet was for sissies.

At the end of ""Black Swan"" I wanted to cheer for the movie. If you see a lot of movies you know when you've seen a good one. I think I've seen an Oscar worthy movie in Portman's performance and the movie itself.",1295049600,2,2634,4.515723270440252

4246116,3,B0041KKYEM,"Black Swan was a very strange movie-going experience for me.  I was moderately interested in what was going on during the whole duration of the film & never felt bored...yet, I left the theater not really ""liking"" the movie.  I felt that Aronofsky shot the film beautifully & the performances were mostly good.  However, there were several things going on that just annoyed the hell out of me.  Aronofsky's seamless transitions from ""reality"" to ""delusion"" felt very gimmicky like his sole purpose was to trick the audience rather than further the development of Portman's Nina.  Speaking of Nina, I found the character incredibly one-dimensional.  Yep, we get it: she's an repressed obsessive nut job who loves ballet dancing.  That's all her character is or will ever be in the context of this film & that's laid out for us in the first 20 minutes of the film.  The remainder of her story is just flogging a dead horse.  Every person in the audience knew that she would eventually ""find her dark side"" when LeRoy goaded her about being too innocent during the audition.  And could the character be more insipid???  I just wanted to smack her at least a dozen times.  She needed a lot more moments like the drunk scene, which is when I thought Portman was at her best here.  Kunis was fair as Lily.  Hershey was acceptable as the mother.  Again, the development of these characters was only hinted at just enough, but never were they allowed to be fully explored.  The one character/performance I thought was really good was Cassel as LeRoy.  I thought he nailed the part, deftly shifting between motivator & critic, friend & foe.  On the whole, I can't say I hated this movie, but it (and Portman's performance) certainly did not live up to the hype.",1294704000,133,1752,4.707236842105263
4246117,5,B0041KKYEM,"Darren Aronofsky is really the master of uncomfortable films. They are brilliant, but they make you want to squirm in your seat.

So expect nothing less from ""Black Swan,"" a sublimely horrific psychological thriller. Aronofsky crafts the delicate, dark tale of a fragile young woman's descent into insanity, and Natalie Portman pours every ounce of her skill into the role. It's a beautiful tangle of ballet, classical music, black wings and warping reality.

The lead dancer (Winona Ryder) of a New York ballet company is hospitalized, so a new dancer is needed for ""Swan Lake"" -- a girl who can play both the pure White Swan and the sensual Black Swan. Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) desperately wants to dance the role, especially since her controlling stage mother (Barbara Hershey) has always driven her to be ""perfect."" Many other girls want the role, including the new girl Lily (Mila Kunis).

But even after Nina wins the role, she doesn't find any peace. She begins to believe that Lily is trying to steal the role of a lifetime, and is tormented by strange voices and hallucinations -- and spiky little feather start sprouting from her shoulders. And as her debut approaches, Nina begins sliding further into a nightmarish world where she IS the Black Swan.

In his previous movies, Darren Aronofsky has explored psychological grotesquerie or exquisite beauty... but I don't think he's ever melded the two as he does in ""Black Swan."" This movie is a nightmare -- a graceful, satin-swathed, feathered, mirrored nightmare, full of strange images (screaming pictures) and haunting moments that make you want to hide.

At the movie's start, there's a vague sense of unease and instability, as if something nightmarish is lurking right around the corner. But with every successive scene, Aronofsky painstakingly slips in more and more surreality and creepiness, until you find yourself locked in Nina's living hell. It all climaxes in a brilliant juxtaposition of dance, death, beauty and horror.

The freakiest parts of it may be the changes to Nina's body, namely her backwards ""swan legs"" and the feathers on her back. Is her madness changing her body? Is it just another hallucination? It takes awhile to figure out.

The lead role is one of those roles that demands all the passion, skill and life that an actor can pour into it, and Natalie Portman gives the role everything she has -- her Nina is a trembling, fragile creature made out of glass, who begins to crack under pressure. Mila Kunis gives a subtle, strong performance as Lily (both in and out of Nina's head), and there are great side performances by Hershey, Ryder, and Vincent Cassel.

""Black Swan"" is a movie that lulls you into a beautiful nightmare, and leaves you trying to unravel what is madness and what is reality. It's uncomfortable to watch, but it's supposed to be.",1294617600,2,2849,4.933194154488517

4246119,5,B0041KKYEM,"There is something about Israeli born Natalie Portman (Hebrew name Hershlag) that bears watching no matter what movie she's in.  The lithe actress with the million-watt smile is at once beautiful and immensely talented and has a habit of stealing any scene she shows up in.  Indeed, her screen time in Cold Mountain (2003) was rather limited, but her appearance half-way through the Civil War drama is principally why I enjoyed the movie as much as I did.  And when she takes the lead as she did in Goya's Ghost (2006) and V for Vendetta (2006), the piece is made much more enjoyable because she's starring.

Her latest movie ""Black Swan"" (2010) in which she appears alongside relative newcomer, Ukrainian born Mila Kunis (Max Payne, The Book Of Eli, Date Night), and veteran screen-actress Barbara Hershey (Hannah and Her Sisters, Falling Down, The Entity) is no exception; she steals the movie and in-so-doing has generated considerable Oscar buzz.

The Story

Directed by Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain, The Wrestler), ""Black Swan"" opens on Nina Sayers the lovely Ms. Portman (Garden State, Star Wars I, Vendetta, The Other Boleyn Girl) as a ballerina in a big city dance company.  The company's artistic director Thomas Leroy portrayed by Vincent Cassel (Irreversible, Oceans Twelve, Eastern Promises) is struggling to take the troupe in a new direction and decides to put on a new interpretation of Swan Lake in which he casts Nina who lives with her mother Erica (Barbara Hersey) , in the lead role.

As rehearsals for the production get underway Leroy brings is a new ballerina, Lily (Mila Kunis) from San Francisco, to understudy for Nina.  He also starts pressuring her to inhabit the role of the Black Swan more fully, tapping into her more risqu side.  But, Nina, who up to this point has had no experience with love, lust, sex, drugs or drinking, is finding it hard to tap into the Black Swans' dark persona, and her mind starts to crack and before long she is hallucinating and has a hard time telling the real from the imaginary.

My Thoughts

And so do we!  Have trouble discerning what's real from what is taking place inside Nina's head that is.  And that is the beauty of ""Black Swan,"" it keeps you guessing almost until the bitter end; is this really happening to Nina or is she taking us for a jaunt through her troubled, tortured mind?

The trouble for Nina is that she has been sheltered and smothered by her mother (an ex-ballerina) her whole life.  Even now in her mid-twenties, Nina's bedroom is painted pink with girlie curtains on the windows, and is filled with stuffed animals. And her mother plays a ballerina music box for her every night as she tucks her into bed.  These are the trappings of a virginal young girl not an enterprising and vibrant young adult; is it any wonder Nina's mind can't quite handle the very experienced Black Swan; that she so closely associates with the White Swan?

And Natalie Portman pulls off the dual personas well.  Portman's roles of late, starting with Closer, have been flirtatious, titillating, and clearly adult in nature.  Black Swan with its mature sexual themes continues this decidedly enjoyable trend.

Portions of the movie were shot with handheld cameras with extreme close-ups and the oft jittery motion that accompanies this type of movie making.  The results for the light of stomach can be jarring, so be forewarned.  But I liked the close-ups of Ms. Portman's almost chiseled, but emotionally transparent face.  The actress need not say a word, but you can tell what she's feeling just by reading her striking face.

For all of the hype (movie trailers), Mina Kunis' Lily saw relatively limited screen time, but when she was on-screen Kunis did a god jobs a Lily's would be foil and part-time lover, but was she really?  Again the beauty of Black Swan is we don't really know if Lily was or wasn't who she was made out to be.

Even better, Black Swan is original, no doubt you've never seem a movie like it before; it is engrossing, exciting, titillating, scary, and never quite allows you to catch your breath.  Even the simplest movement like Nina up on her toes left me wondering: ""will she break her toe, will she fall and break her ankle, and if she does will it be real or in her mind.""  That sort of angst throughout the movie moves it along and before long it's over, but you (I) don't want it to be! Please give me more Portman to watch!

Though Portman is the center of ""Black Swan,"" everyone else in the movie turns in strong performances including Winona Ryder (remember when she was the Hollywood ""it"" girl of the moment?) as the fading ballerina Nina replaces, Beth Macintyre.  And Aronofsky as he is won't to do finds something new to say about something old.  Portman turns in another outstanding performance, indeed the best I've seen since Goya's Ghost, and I have to say I love this movie enough to high recommend it.",1294444800,5,4939,4.726954492415403
4246120,5,B0041KKYEM,"It has been a very long time since I was this impressed with a movie. We witness the tensile strain between light and dark, a visceral study of polarity, reality, catharsis and obsession.

I think the combination of Aronofsky's sense of fantastic drama and Portman's dedication to and mastery of her craft is a perfect match, which can not fail to impress even the most cynical modern movie-goer. Portman's roles in her career have been quite varied, and have not always been especially impressive, but when she shines, she REALLY shines.  I feel this is easily her best thus far; her expressions had the poignant realism of true desperation and confusion.  Supporting cast are mostly proficient, with Vincent Cassel and the lovely Mila Kunis turning in great performances.  Special effects are used more sparingly than the trailer would lead you to believe, but this really enhances their potency.  Make no mistake, now; this is not a film about ballet.  It seems many have misguidedly approached Black Swan expecting a Red Shoes remake.  And it's not necessarily horror, thriller, or other such pigeon-hole, either.  Black Swan is an uncommon film - dark, chaotic and tactile cinema that will stick in your mind for a long time after.  Believe the hype.",1294358400,4,1598,5.389558232931727
4246121,4,B0041KKYEM,"I watched Black Swan for the same reason that every other self-respecting heterosexual male did, for the much discussed lesbian scene between the talented and very flexible Natalie Portman and the girl who voices Meg on Family Guy, Mila Kunis. I'm probably not the first to tell you that the lesbian scene bordered on epic proportions only to be rivaled by most of the scenes from Showgirls starring Jesse Spano. Natalie and Mila had extraordinary chemistry and I could barely tell during the scene that they were acting.

The only reason I am not giving this amazing lesbian sex scene five stars is because there are a lot of other scenes in Black Swan that wouldn't be considered a ""lesbian sex scene"" by industry standards. Actually, the only other scene that could be considered a ""sex scene"" is where Natalie Portman is fantasizing in her room by herself and doing something that most women deny doing but every male knows they actually do. Other than that scene, virtually every scene contains no sexual content. At first I tried to fast forward through the non-sex scenes but ended up accidentally fast forwarding through the desired scene so I ended up getting frustrated and just watched it from the beginning.

Not to spoil the movie for any females that want to actually watch it, but there is a tremendous amount of ballet in this film. It's pretty much all anyone talks about. They're either practicing ballet or performing it in front of a live audience. The only ballet scene I did enjoy was where Natalie was in the Black Swan character, but that's probably because I'm a huge KISS fan. When there aren't ballet scenes, there's a lot of dialogue between characters with hardly any jokes. There aren't many one-liners in this movie. It's virtually un-quotable. It's pretty much the opposite of Old School, which I wasn't expecting.

My hope is that a director's cut is released when the movie comes out on Blu-Ray that removes all the unnecessary scenes such as the ballet and dialog scenes. I realize that most director's cut versions are actually longer than the feature film but I do know of one exception. The hilarious comedy, Alexander, starring Colin Farrell and directed by Oliver Stone has a director's cut that is shorter than the feature film.

In summary, if Black Swan doesn't go the way of the immensely successful film, Alexander, and releases a shortened director's cut without all the extraneous ballet and dialogue scenes, I fear that most of the male audience will miss out on a truly breathtaking lesbian sex scene.",1294272000,7,2550,4.841743119266055

4246123,5,B0041KKYEM,"Beware of some spoilers.

  After viewing *Black Swan* twice, I'm convinced that Darren Aronofsky does not intend for this film be taken at face value. On the surface, *Black Swan* seems to exploit the crass stereotypes that bad girls invariably have more fun, and that women galvanize their desire for power by competing with other women. Aronofsky--a talented director fascinated with the nature of obsession--exaggerates these cliches to the point of satire in *Black Swan.*

  Nina Sayres, the ambitious young dancer portrayed by Natalie Portman, is an infantalized, pink-wearing, obsessive perfectionist to an extreme. On the other hand, her rival Lily (Mila Kunis),embodies the current ideal of uber cool: a druggie sexpot with a cloyingly breezy manner, she urges Nina to engage in chemically enhanced transgressive behaviors. Within the context of this film, the ballet *Swan Lake* provides the perfect vehicle for exaggerating the madonna/whore dichotomy that continues to plague Western culture. Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), the ballet company's lecherous director, and the film's primary spokesperson for this stereotype, constantly emphasizes the distinction between the chaste white swan and her profane alter ego, the black swan. Pompous and shallow, he has accepted this stereotype uncritically and perhaps has something to gain from it, since he obviously finds femmes fatales sexually titillating.

  Thomas's misogynistic and manipulative attitude seems at first glance to drive the film, especially since Nina takes seriously his command that she appropriate the black swan's dangerous sexuality. His perspective, however, must not be confused with the film's dominant point-of-view, which engages in the campy and occasionally comical exaggeration of these stereotypes. From this standpoint, Thomas is as ludicrous as the ideas that he constantly hypes: he is simply a mouthpiece for the nefarious cultural beliefs that nearly drive Nina insane.

  While some may argue that the madonna/whore stereotype no longer exerts cultural force, one needs to look no further than Hollywood to see that it still exists. A director who usually works outside of the mainstream Hollywood system, Aronofsky has created a work that brutally satirizes the show business stereotype that women must be sexually manipulative in order to survive. In a telling moment early in the film, Beth Macintyre (Winona Ryder), a drunken dancer on the verge of retirement, calls Nina a ""whore"" for ""stealing"" the role that should have been hers. The implication in this comically campy scene is that that one aging ""whore"" has simply been replaced by a younger rival--one who must prove her worth in a system that may either venerate or denigrate the conniving and seductive woman.

  By satirizing Hollywood's fascination with femmes fatales and female rivalry, Aronofsky symbolically thumbs his nose at as system that continues to promote a distorted view of women's sexuality. He sets out not merely to entertain the viewers but to challenge them by rendering these stereotypes as comic and grotesque.",1294185600,,3095,5.5
4246124,5,B0041KKYEM,"Every year I have one movie that just surprises me - a movie that blows away all my expectations.  2009 it was The Hurt Locker.  For 2010 that movie that defied all my pre-conceived notions was director Darren Aronofsky's glimpse into insanity known simply as Black Swan.

If you hadn't already learned, 2010's highly acclaimed drama Black Swan is about ballet dancer Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman).  After four years in a prestigious New York City ballet studio (I don't remember the title of the company ever being given within the film) Nina tries desperately for the part of the Swan Queen in the year's production of Swan Lake.  The company leader, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), is a strong willed man who lets no boundaries come between him and his vision, willing to make aggressive, sexual advances solely to make a point on how he wants a performance to be done.  When Nina auditions she perfects the routine for the White Swan, but is told by Leroy that she simply is too uptight and controlled to play the White Swan's evil doppelganger, the Black Swan.  After biting the Leroy's lip when he attempts to sexually assault her Nina is given the role of the Swan Queen with Leroy claiming that the biting incident was the spark he needed to show she was capable of the role.

Nina is a goody-two-shoes having the color pink enshrouding her entire room and living under the care of her overbearing mother (note that Nina is clearly out of her teens) who wishes for the best but also causes Nina to be incapable of truly living outside of the ballet.  Her mother wishes the best for her daughter, but it is clear she's been too controlling of her daughter's life, which in part is the cause of the Nina's tragic downward spiral.  At first glance she is a caring mother, but as the plot progresses it is clear her control reaches far too deep into Nina's life

Nina at the same time meets with a new dancer, Lilly (Mila Kunis), who unlike Nina isn't a perfectionist, but comes across as very natural.  Lilly is also an outgoing girl, smoking in the studio, taking drugs, and filling her evenings with wild sexual exploits.  Eventually, Nina is brought in by Lilly's advances and begins a descent into darkness.  But as the plot progresses further towards its destructive climax Nina begins to believe that Lilly is not out to befriend her, but instead attempting to steal from her the role of Swan Queen which she had worked so very hard to achieve.  The film ends with the opening night of Swan Lake where everything ties together in a special effects fueled finale.

The trailers in no way prepared me for the nightmare that is Black Swan.  Black Swan is perhaps the best psychological horror film of the last five years, if not the decade!  I knew nothing about ballet (except a few holiday visits to the Nutcracker), but this movie made sure it was all easy to follow for those uninitiated in the art.  Easily understood is the common notion of an individual seeking perfection, and that is Nina's flaw.  Perfection is what she seeks and with her good nature taking the role of the Black Swan begins to drive her mad and Natalie Portman plays the part pitch-perfect!

I knew the buzz, knew that Aronofsky is one of the great directors currently working, yet up until I arrived at the theater I doubted that a movie centered on ballet would entertain me as a male member of the audience.  By the end of the movie I realize this could have been about anything, but the ballet allows for majestic, dark imagery mixed with classical music (alongside another great score from Clint Mansell who also did the infamous score for Requiem for a Dream with Aronofsky).  This is the first movie in years, and I do mean years, that has made me cringe in my seat.  The violence is minimum, but what it has I found far more frightening than any today's ""torture porn"" films (see: Saw franchise).  Aronofsky knows how to make the most out of the violence in his film and each time it left an impact on me as a viewer.

There will always be that stuck-up portion of the population (particularly guys) who will avoid this movie being ""Yo, this ballet stuff is so gay!"" and trust me, I going into the theater alone, as a young man to see a movie about a ballet dancer, I was rather uncomfortable...But once the movie started all those thoughts were left behind!  I couldn't believe it!  Aronofsky made a great movie mixing ballet with psychological horror!  There is nothing stupid or girly about this movie.  In fact, this is far more disturbing material than three fourths of the films released in the few years.

You'll have to be into movies that tell movies through surreal imagery to really enjoy Black Swan, because the one flaw is that some of the events make no sense if you try to put it under the scrutiny of logic.  Don't get me wrong, I think it's a great movie, but one thing in its climax takes a great deal of suspension of disbelief (if you're like me you were too blown away by how awesome the climax is to notice this leap of logic until after you've left the theater).

If you're into surreal movies, or psychological horror films dealing with an individuals descent into insanity than I couldn't recommend this movie enough.  If you're some ""macho, macho man"" or think all films have to make perfect sense than you might want to skip it.

I personally say Black Swan easily in the top five films of 2010!",1294185600,,5415,4.564632885211996
4246125,5,B0041KKYEM,"Black Swan is a truly interesting movie experience. It takes one of the all time great classic ballet tragedies & without distorting the premise of the story it re-invents the storyline entirely in a human domain. No sorcerer here except that sorcerer we all have within us.

In the ballet, purity & evil are separate spheres & the battle in this world is won by the dark & deadly. Yet even in the ballet world there exists the sphere beyond flesh where justice mayhap prevails.

In the movie, light & dark are contained in a single vessel. The struggle is, if anything, even more intense than the ballet because there is only one fate to be determined & that fate is all but foreordained, yet possibilities exist.

The story of Black Swan has enhanced the enjoyment of Swan Lake for my wife & I. Just as the creation & story of Swan Lake makes Black Swan such a wonderful journey. Black Swan is a great movie whether there is a Swan Lake or not. Yet Swan Lake makes the movie a far greater show by its very existence. The ballet is the life blood of both yet the ballet is complimented by the movie in a grand manner.

If you get caught on this idea of an older girl with a little girl's mind struggling to make an integrated whole of her childlike purity & her adult desires. Add in the very human influences around her & see the childlike wrath, shown as images in the movie but they are only thoughts in her mind, it is a tremendous depiction of human struggle for a functional identity. What will be the union of these opposing forces?

The director has given a story that allows numerous personal choices for the character & the viewer. The viewer's personal leanings for a resolution are left open & then the end........ Did the viewer forget something that is brought out in the end? Yes, the most obvious consideration in any case of identity development. Does dark & evil win in Black Swan? Is there a further consideration? Guess!

The Swan Lake story is re-organized into a totally human realm & characters go through some adaptation & yet there are no unrecognizable characters in Black Swan. These are people you knew from the ballet but they are more developed as people & more complex as personae.

We did not go back & watch Black Swan today only because we watched Swan Lake instead. The one show lends life & depth to the other. I am a full on certified Black Swan freak. More so than for any movie I can remember in long years.

It is a Shakespearean tragedy wrapped in a little girls mind & a grown woman's body. It shows tremendous thought in adapting the storyline, tremendous depth in displaying this dysfunctional mind, tremendous intelligence in how to display the scenes for story development & a whistle in the ear for people that want their cinema straight forward plain jane. Rest assured I'll see it again in the theatre.",1294185600,,2852,4.513565891472868
4246126,5,B0041KKYEM,"Whether it be positive or negative, critics and general public alike had a lot to say about Darren Aronofsky's 'Black Swan,' a ballet acid fantasy bathed in darkness. The film's central star, Natalie Portman received, for the first time in her career, a great deal of Oscar buzz for her role. This is understandable, given how doggedly dedicated and passionate she clearly was in emanating a ballerina on the brink.

This ballerina on the brink is Nina, a doe-eyed innocent and supremely fragile young woman who's dedicated her life to the dance. Nina is obviously unstable from the get-go, but 'Black Swan' sends her on a true descent into madness. Her company's artistic director, Thomas Leroy (a venomously manipulative Vincent Cassel) is staging a 'new age' production of the classic Swan Lake, intending to cast one girl as both the White and Black Swans. He is confident in Nina's capability of portraying the elegant, virginal White Swan, but is reluctant to believe she has the sensuality and conviction to pull off her evil twin, the Black Swan. Nina is desperate for the part, subtly and continually attempting to convince Thomas so, but she's further threatened by the entrance of Lily (Mila Kunis, also a noteworthy performance), a sexy, free-spirited Californian who may unintentionally sweep the title right out from under her.

Coming home to a madly repressive, suffocating mother (played to perfection by Barbara Hershey) is no help; Nina's sugar pink bedroom closely resembles that of a young child's, filled with piles of stuffed animals and music boxes. Things intensify even further when Nina finally is in fact awarded the part, presumably at the expense of aging, deeply resentful ballerina Beth getting the boot (Winona Ryder, recalling 'Girl, Interrupted').

It's at this point that Nina begins to fear that she is being stalked or haunted by someone or something; whether it be Thomas and Lily forging deeper relationships with unclear intentions, Beth's cryptically sadistic commentary or her mother's aggressive attempts to control and infantilize her, she feels a great deal of darkness closing in on her heart and mind, which ultimately and inevitably brings her closer to her own dark side.

'Black Swan' rides very fine lines between thriller, drama, and macabre horror. A vast majority of the film is psychological, and whether certain events are real or imagined are oftentimes left up to the viewer. Psychological movies can overwhelm and confuse, but 'Black Swan' mystifies and captivates, from beginning to end. An enormous contributing factor is indeed Natalie Portman's performance; the yearning loneliness she exudes as Nina is devastatingly real, and audiences will connect with her, even as they hope for her, lose faith in her, and fear for her. Its approach may at times be over-the-top, but 'Black Swan' makes its point and leaves its mark; topped off with an exquisite ending sequence, it'll follow you out as you leave the theater.",1294185600,2,2978,5.146694214876033
4246127,5,B0041KKYEM,"""Black Swan"" succeeds on many levels. Boldly directed by Darren Aronofsky, it is a modern fairy tale brimming with lurid twists and diabolical turns that glides seamlessly between gritty realism and a surrealist nightmare. Though it can easily be dismissed as an over-the-top backstage melodrama, it is an unflinching examination of the dark side of human performance and a richly textured fable about the dangers of single-minded ambition. At its center is a triumphant jaw-dropping performance by Natalie Portman. She is Nina Sayers, a fragile yet fiercely dedicated ballerina whose undying quest for perfection and relentless obsession to lose herself in her dream role frees her from a cloistered existence, but at the cost of her mind.

Nina is first seen dancing the prologue of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake with great focus and precision, but it is only a dream. In the real world, she shares an apartment with her caring mother, Erica (Barbara Hershey), and dances at a prestigious ballet company in New York's Lincoln Center. Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), the company's formidable artistic director, plans to re-imagine Swan Lake for the opening performance of the new season. Upon casting out his prima ballerina and former lover, Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder), Thomas announces he is seeking a new face for the upcoming production.

During an exclusive audition process, Nina stumbles but her determination lands her the coveted role of the Swan Queen, a physically and mentally demanding part that requires two contrasting performances. Though her flawless technique and air of innocence is ideally suited for the virginal White Swan, Thomas fears she lacks the sensuality crucial for embodying the part of the Black Swan. Fearing replacement, she plunges deeper into the part.

Tensions escalate between her and Thomas as his criticisms become harsher and his sexual advances intensify. Nina's relationship with her mother begins to take on a new dimension as well. Erica's constant dedication to her daughter's career becomes increasingly questionable once the truth about her own dancing career boils to the surface. The cocoonlike apartment they inhabit, so safe and seemingly cozy in the beginning scenes, soon evolves a claustrophobic cage.

Lines between reality and the dream world begin to blur as Nina's vivid hallucinations become more consistent. And with the arrival of Lily (Mila Kunis), a new dancer from the West Coast, an obscure rivalry begins to take shape. With her free-spirited technique, cool and confident personality, and ability to evoke sexuality both on and off the stage, Lily is a more natural match for the Black Swan. Thomas takes notice and quickly casts her as Nina's alternate. In Nina's eyes, she becomes an object of intense jealousy and subconscious desire.

Aronofsky meant for ""Black Swan"" to be a companion piece to his previous work, 2008's ""The Wrestler"", a film that at first glance invites minimal comparison. Portman's ballerina and Rourke's wrestler take equally destructive paths to personal glory both ultimately seeking the approval of others over their own self-gratification. And though ballet is regarded as the highest of art forms and wrestling one of the lowest, performers in both arenas use movements of grandeur and excess to achieve their own vision of expression. In both pieces, he has brilliantly captured the tragedy of a performer with incredible depth and range.

Though surrounded by macabre visions and flights of fantasy, ""Black Swan"" gains its allure and beauty from a more artistically satisfying place. Backstage dramas are not uncommon on film and it is a miracle that screenwriters Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin were able to take the familiar elements of the genre and provide them with weight and gravitas. However supreme credit must go to Darren Aronofsky for finding full creative freedom without teetering into camp or cliches. Painted in a grand style reminicient of a Roman Polanski horror movie or Dario Argento's ""Suspiria"", Nina's downward spiral into madness is both mesmerizing and disturbing without being gratuitous or distracting.

Portman is nothing short of revelatory in a performance unmatched in passion or ferocity. Seemingly adrift in Aronofsky's feverish dreamland, she is always precise and never unconvincing. And though the camera is more often framing her face than her feet, her skill as a professional ballerina is never questionable (she spent ten months training for the role).

The supporting players are faced with the daunting challenge of finding balanced duality in their roles as well. Vincent Cassel is mentor and menace effortlessly conjuring up equal amounts of respect and repulsion. He gives Thomas Leroy an intimidating force; unapologetically lecherous and arrogant yet undeniably seductive. Barbara Hershey's fearless performance as an overbearing stage mother maniacally weaves between sympathetic and monstrous. From the beginning it is apparent that something may be lurking underneath her veil of saccharine sweetness; what is revealed is profoundly heartbreaking and unsettling.

As a competitor whose motives are never quite clear, Mila Kunis is a beguiling presence on screen. All of the charm and self-assurance from her performance in 2008's ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is on display, but Kunis (who trained alongside Portman) unleashes a fiery eroticism and ambiguity unseen in any previous work. But it is Winona Ryder who gives the most unexpected performance. In merely three minutes of screen time, she elevates a part that at first glance feels like an obligatory cliche into a three-dimensional character whose personal tragedy is as devastating as Portman's.

""Black Swan"" could have easily become a frigid masterpiece consumed by its own style. Aronofsky wisely keeps almost all focus on Portman and is rewarded with an unforgettable performance. They are two dance partners let loose on a blank stage. Set to the haunting strains of Tchaikovsky's timeless score, their dance is a feat of great beauty and skill.",1294099200,3,6073,5.3764458464773925
4246128,1,B0041KKYEM,"I finally went to a movie worse than Wicker Man - The Black Swan. It's a gay man's bad acid trip. The film employs every groan-inducing cliche about the theatre/ballet ever used. If they missed one, I'm at a loss what it might be. Actually, Mickey Rooney isn't in it, now that I come to think of it. At points it was like Tchaikovsky meets the Three Stooges, especially when the lead male drops Portman on her keester. To give you a sense of how intensely bogus it all is, all the male characters are straight and the hottest chic in the film ( and it's not Natalie Portman who 1. is never the hottest chic in any film, and 2. is more ham fisted than Al Pacino on his worst day) is a lesbian pill popping Angelina type who carries extra underwear in her purse. Of course! Where was she when I was in the ballet? Wait a second...
Never mind. I kept waiting for someone to carry a ladder onto the set, swing around and coldkonk Portman as the director fumed ""You numbskull! Watch where you're swinging that thing.""
This is bad enough to have been directed by Night Shayamalan. ""I see dead birds."" Do you think Alfred Hitchcock knew this was in the pipeline? Woody Allen is rightly criticized for making dull films for people from select zip codes in NY. This one is for their daughters. As for the overly hyped ""wanking"" scene, she'll never go blind.
I used to think it was a miracle that Edward Woodward escaped the career torpedo Wicker Man sent his way to become the actor we all discovered in Breaker Morant, among others. What do you do after you've played a boring princess in lame brain space movies and an infantile diva in bird brain ballet films? If I wanted that much drama, I'd go watch Terrel Owens.

4246129,2,B0041KKYEM,"There is no question that Darren Aronofsky is a master filmmaker.  The acting was great.  But watching this film was a painful experience for me.  ""Requiem for a Dream"" was a powerful film and one would expect drug addicts to end up badly, but the experience of an artist in the free world should not be this tormenting.

You would not go and see this movie for the dancing - the film contained little of it.  The camera tastefully dealt with great difficulty of the choreography by showing a few brief glimpses of relatively easy practice and performance sequences, and only fragments of dancers' bodies, like faces and feet, at other times.  This ""over the top"" production with neat computer-generated special effects and blurred lines between reality and fantasy must have been an attempt to make a grand statement about the world of art.  You would like this film if you have a professional interest in the way visual stimuli are used to convey an idea, or if you can only appreciate art for style and not substance.  If you are looking for a good plot, however, you will find this film lacking.  Natalie Portman's character was wretched.  She completely lost her way as a human being.  If you met that kind of woman in real life, you would instantly feel her misery and pain.  Her self-mutilation scenes made me cringe.  All the other characters were either mentally ill or seriously flawed.

When I came home, I put in the Bolshoi Ballet's Swan Lake DVD with Maya Plisetskaya.  I wish Darren Aronofsky's film about ballet was based not on some phantasmagoric nightmarish scenario but on the life and career of this great ballerina, who faced many serious challenges and nevertheless managed to achieve the kind of success that could be an inspiration to all of us.  In the hands of a competent director, a good story could make the difference between a trendy flick and a potentially classic film.",1294099200,10,1903,4.738601823708207

4246131,2,B0041KKYEM,"Note: Few spoilers, but the sixth paragraph has a pretty major spoiler, but is vital to the comprehension of this review. AND believe me, I loved Aronofsky, and just couldn't enjoy it as I should have. Peace!

Darren Aronofsky usually has a set of routine characters who have lost their way in life. From the drug dealers in Requiem for a Dream to Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, this has been a common theme in his work. However, here, he is trying to establish a different central dynamic, and the weakened character is the secondary character, Beth, the Prima Ballerina, who will be soon retiring. Many may claim that Ryder's character is vastly unimportant, but it just may show that Aronofsky cannot separate himself from his long held familiar themes.

Aronofsky 's film centers on ballerina Nina who, along with countless other ballerinas in her company is auditioning for Swan Lake.  The Director, Leroy, wants to cast the same person as the Black and White Swan. White so many options, he eventually chooses Nina despite having better black Swan candidates, such as Lilly played by Mila Kunis. Apparently, Lilly is filling for another ballerina, and as so, Nina, is not very familiar around her, nor comfortable. Nina is very shy, reserved, committed to her art, and extremely focused who has no concept or understanding of Lilly's offbeat sense of humor, her directness, her strange and sudden attempt at friendship. Their conflicting attitudes, if nothing else, are evidence of arising problems.

One of the main complaints of the film is how unfit a protagonist Nina is. As a shy, reserved character living at home with a mother, played by Barbra Hershey, who creates abstract and nearly identical, in form, abstract portraits, and is intrusive, Lilly seems to have the perfect arsenal to bring out the Black Swan. If the Black Swan is supposed to be emotionally crippled and vulnerable, it seems strange that Nina fails in this regard, and actually succeeds at portraying the White Swan. Stranger, however, is that Lilly succeeds at portraying the Black Swan better, even though she would naturally seem as better suited for the Black Swan. Another oddity is how oddly different Nina is compared to all of Aronofsky 's other characters. They all seemed extroverts, and displayed more overt emotions than Nina. Maybe this adds to the mystique of this character as we don't know what she will be capable of as the film develops. She expresses a lot of emotion, but all of it is internal, and that makes her not only mysterious, but capricious.

Aronofsky is without doubt one of the most talented directors of the last decade, but here he is of his element. With the Wrestler, most of us westerners have watched wrestling and sometimes laughed at and admired their countless shenanigans that is labeled at times sport and other times entertainment. However, not most film viewers are going to have gone to the ballet or have a deep understanding of it. As such, we do not accept the details of this art, as we might with a film centered on Wrestling, boxing, football, but his film delivers none of the intricacies of ballet. Many may claim that no film is responsible, or must dwell in the details of the craft they are set in, but Black Swan is different.

Leroy consistently haunts Nina about the imperfections of her Black Swan, her inability to be ""flawed,"" her lack of necessary aggression,  talking about how Lilly is better prepared for this Swan, but none of this is actually show clearly. Aronofsky would have done better showing Nina attend a performance of Swan Lake, so that the audience can gain, at least, a little insight into this world. In its current state, it is quite certain that this was written by authors who had no deep knowledge of the ballet world, and just wanted to create a film. That is fine, if this film was mainly an acting film, like Winter's Bone, but Leroy and Lilly's interaction make this much more than a character study, and with some study it could have successfully turned in to a ""limited"" study of Swan Lake. Leroy's complaints of Lilly is confined to her lack of ferocity, aggression, and inability to ""let go,"" give credence to the claim that these writers knew very little about the details of a ballet performance, or were simply uninterested in giving multiple angles to the performance and its preparation. We see lots of kissing, groping of breasts and crotch between Leroy and Lilly, and it would be sexy, if it were not part of Lilly's preparation; and with this knowledge these scenes become quite depressing, considering that these are the only advice she gains from her instructor. There needs to be more insight to Leroy's character than his unashamed seductions in preparing his ballerina. Sure, ballet is very sexualized, but the advice and period of preparation must not ALL be sexual.

There is a line between what is real and what is a fantasy, a dream, or works of the imagination. There are many directors who cross this line, and then there are those that mock it, like Aronofsky does in this film, for the benefits of paranoia and obsession. Nina's obsession is very well understood from all the physical injuries she suffers, but it is the paranoia that Aronofsky is quite inept at capturing. He begins to play a horror game which involves a monster, with the body of a man, having sex with Lilly. Actually, when the paranoia seems to become quite intriguing, it has more to do with drugs than Lilly's altered personality. One especially offensive scene occurs near the very end when Nina and Lilly fight, and Nina pushes Lilly in the path of a large mirror, and stabs her with shards of glass, and drags her to another room; leaving her alternate for dead, while she begins her performance. When she later returns to the room, she hears a knock on the door, and of all people it's LILLY. As it turns out she was fighting herself, and so it can be presumed she pushed herself in the mirror! This is where Black Swan becomes even more ludicrous, because at this point Lilly finds the shards of glass in her body, and finds that she is bloodied. So, get this: The NINNA VS. NINNA match occurs, then Ninna does part of her performance (as the Black Swan), she returns to the room, and suddenly the shards of glass that punctured her body take effect. This is like a Western where two cowboys shoot at each other, and none of them are injured, but after ninety minutes the bullet exists from their body, causing incurable harm, and we are supposed to be believe and accept that the bullet, and in our case, the shards of glass manifested till the right time came, and then it started to cause observable bleeding. This is not paranoia, but desperation of the filmmaker.

Natalie Portman will be undoubtedly nominated for Best Actress for her performance, and considering that there are no veteran actors competing this year who are without an Oscar-Kidman, Berry, etc have won at least once-she might win her first Statue. But God knows this is the wrong performance. This is a good performance, but it is not an exceptional performance, as Ninna is not subdued, but simply nervous and hesitant to trust anyone. Unlike Winter's Bone where a subtle performance was cleverly done by Jennifer Lawrence, Portman's performance is miniscule in comparison. Her character is so jumpy that it could be played as well, if not better, by most actors. The performance is quite one note, because the character is designed as such.  The rave reviews that Kunis is getting are simply baffling. She plays the sweet tempered, yet clever opportunist who seems to be plotting for the main role of Swan Lake. Again, this performance is not a stretch for Kunis and she bring a familiar and monotonous charm to the character that is deeply reminiscent of every other performance she has done-be it on TV or film.

Vincent Cassel's performance:  WOW! Now here is a performance that deserved a nomination, but received none. Despite my problems with the sole sexualized advice of Leroy, Cassel plays this character with so much confidence and grandeur, creating a captivating instructor admired by all. Cassel's performance is exceptional because Leroy is open to much analysis, and is not as one note as the female roles that occupy this film. Barbra Hershey gives a respectable performance, despite her limited screen time. Bound to get an Oscar nomination.

Overall, this is an below average film from a great filmmaker who is just of his element, and is dealing with an issue that he does not have extensive and exhausting information. However, considering the crap in theaters, this would be recommended for Portman, Kunis, and Aronofsky fans.",1294012800,18,8694,4.8151373074346955

His ability to get the very best performances out of his actors is something even his most scrutinizing critics cannot possibly deny.  All the performances in Aronofsky's Black Swan are worthy of praise.  Barbara Hershey's overbearing and profoundly envious mother will be slightly overlooked among the tall trees in Black Swan, but she is terrific here.  Mila Kunis's unlikely transformation into a serious dramatic actress and not just some cute lifeless mannequin is getting the praise it deserves.  Winona Ryder is appropriately handed the ideal role that not only compliments Portman's character but compelled me to draw interesting parallels between the two actresses careers.  Vincent Cassel is finally given a great dramatic role in a great dramatic American movie, and he is smarmy, yucky, vile, and as convincing as he's ever been; he's brilliant here.

Portman plays Nina Sayers as perfectly as can be expected but she clearly did the real life work to become a ballerina first and foremost.  More importantly than even that, she portrays Nina's dramatic and symbolic transformation at the film's climax with certainly her very best work, and some of the best acting I've seen in a number of years.  It is imperative that she win every major performing award of 2010.

Black Swan follows ballerina Nina Sayers (Portman) of the New York City Ballet Company as she struggles for the lead role of the Swan Queen, a role that requires performing as not only the White Swan but also the Black Swan, in a production of Swan Lake directed by Thomas Leroy (Cassel).  Leroy feels Nina is perfect as the delicate White Swan but is unsure she can become the sensual and powerful Black Swan.  Nina is innocent and reserved in real life and as a dancer she possesses perfect mechanics, but she needs to let go of herself to find the Black Swan.  She finds an unwitting rival in Lily (Kunis) that may not have the skill set Nina has but she has the carefree attitude in general that is coveted for the role of Black Swan.  The film spirals into a tremendous psychological thriller brought on by jealousy, sensuality, unhealthy competition, and a little bit of drugs and alcohol.  I will say no more as Black Swan is full of turns you may not see coming and it behooves anyone to avoid spoilers for this amazing film.

It should also be mentioned that Clint Mansell's soundtrack is outstanding and not only keeps with the film's theme but supports the legitimacy of Sayer's journey during even the most frightening moments.  Matthew Libatique got plenty of great cinematography practice in kitschy-er films, but this is his finest work.  In fact, Black Swan is technically immaculate.  I suppose the only thing that prevents me from giving it a perfect rating is the questions I had by the film's end.  I like questions after movies but unlike say last year's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inception/dp/B002ZG981E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inception</a>, the questions I ask after Black Swan might produce answer that not only lessen the film's effect on me at large but might even offer some possible plot inconsistencies and concerns regarding whether or not the story worked for me like it could have.

4246133,2,B0041KKYEM,"After reading the reviews I wonder if I watched the same movie as many others. :-)

I like the director Darren Aronofsky as I think he is a very creative director, but for this movie therein lies the problem. I kept seeing ads for how great a performance Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis gave, not to mention the psychological twist that was evident and promoted in the trailer. But what a downer of a movie. One word sums it up: obsession. So if you want to watch an almost 2hr movie about obsession, it might be your cup of tea. Portman and Kunis DID give excellent performances deserving of the accolades, but the movie failed on numerous levels and there wasn't a likable character at all or any that the viewer could really identify with. And without spoiling too much, the movie got to where you didn't know what was real or what was a dream very quick and I think this works with a less is more approach, but on this one Aronofsky, himself, I think got confused and the movie really falls apart at the seams in the last 3rd. With that said, it IS an interesting and disturbing movie and has some graphic girl on girl sex scenes (which seemed out of place and gratuitous--you'll understand when you see it). If these scenes have a point, great but it was like they were thrown in to keep the husband's (who got dragged to see it) attention. So it's hard to rate. As a movie, maybe 6/10, slightly above average. Yet the performance of at least Portman was easily a 8 or 9/10 and was the best I've ever seen from her.

Here so, in 'Black Swan,' it was for Natalie Portman.  She's riveting as ballerina Nina Sayers - the once gamine Portman is all sinew, bone and iron here.  She'll get a well-deserved Oscar nomination for sure.

Beyond Natalie, Darren Aronofsky's casting choices are excellent.  Barbara Hershey's brittle face (the result of one-too-many scalpels) give her the perfect countenance for someone with her character's infantilizing tendencies (Nina's stuffed animal-laden bedroom is a set designer's delight).  Vincent Cassel was a dancer throughout his youth - his posture, carriage and air of authority all ring true here.  Aronofsky's choice of Winona Ryder as the soloist Portman's character is replacing is his most inspired choice (there's a whiff of Mickey Rourke in that one). Her fallen star and push from the limelight trades a bit on the public's perception of her as a fallen-from-grace starlet.  Ukraine's own Mila Kunis is good here, too - her lithe physique and hard body make her a believable threat to stand in the way of Nina's dreams.

There's a joke here about how you get guys to attend a movie about ballet: you put Portman and Kunis in bed together.  It's that scene that have led some reviewers to call this Aronofsky's ""psychosexual thriller.""  Whether that attracts the wrong type of crowd, I don't know.  But I will say that the scene isn't gratuitous.  It figures heavily in Nina's mental meltdown: did she dream that event?

At first, she seems like a very together young lady with a supportive mother (Barbara Hershey) and a dream job, but we soon begin to learn that there is much more going on beneath the surface.  Aronofsky's approach allows us to make these discoveries for ourselves rather than laying it all out for us.  At times, we are not sure what is fantasy and what reality.

4246137,5,B0041KKYEM,"""Black Swan"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Nina is a ballerina in a New York City ballet company whose life, like all those in her profession, is completely consumed with dance. She lives with her obsessive former ballerina mother Erica who exerts a suffocating control over her. When artistic director Thomas Leroy decides to replace prima ballerina Beth Macintyre for the opening production of their new season, Swan Lake, Nina is his first choice. But Nina has competition: a new dancer, Lily, who impresses Leroy as well. Swan Lake requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan with innocence and grace, and the Black Swan, who represents guile and sensuality. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily is the personification of the Black Swan. As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side - a recklessness that threatens to destroy her.

This is a brilliant film that keeps you thinking and on the edge of your seat at the same time. This is a well-made and well-crafted film. Darren Aronofsky has got another brilliant film on his hands. Natalie Portman gives a superb, Oscar-winning performance and Mila Kunis is just as impressive as her exact opposite. This is one of the best films of last year and it will be remembered when the Oscars are eventually announced.",1293840000,,4083,5.063893016344725
4246138,2,B0041KKYEM,"I wasn't sure what to expect when going into this film. I've always loved the idea of ballet in cinema: it's a subject rarely explored with serious potential and I thought Darren Aronofsky (who brought such an engaging view to pro-wresting with 'The Wrestler') would be a perfect director to bring this world to life. While I liked a lot of the 'behind the scenes' aspects of the movie as well as the performances by the actors, I found 'Black Swan' very hard to enjoy.

Black Swan is about young dancer Nina who, after confronting the director wins the lead in a production of 'Swan Lake'. As she rehearses Nina starts to hallucinate, developes a rash, and becomes paranoid about her understudy (and supposed rival) Lily. Things start happening to Nina and we're unsure if everything is just in her head or not, turning the film into a sort of psychological thriller/horror piece. While this sounds like a promising idea it's actually very unpleasant (and kinda violent) as Nina's hallucinations get more and more disturbing. The movie's also got a very erotic tone and some very sexual moments that it tries to mix in with the horror/disturbing elements. I liked the over-the-top direction 'Black Swan' was going with but the disturbia mixed with the eroticism just turned me off. Also some of the more symbolic hallucinations (Nina seeing her double and her 'transformation' with the feathers, her legs etc.) seemed redundant and overplayed.

The one thing that is hands-down terrific about this film is it's performances. Natalie Portman is showing what a terrific actress she can be with mature roles and it's obvious her and Mila Kunis (as Lily) put a lot of work into their characters physically as well as psychologically. Barbara Hershey is equally good as Portman's somewhat overbearing mother. Vincent Cassel is one of my favorite actors and I love seeing him in any film (even if I don't like the movie itself) and he's terrific as Nina's director.

Again I know it's just my taste but I just didn't like 'Black Swan'. It's very stylish and I liked some of the ideas it had (the directing is quite good). I'm sure for the right audience 'Black Swan's quite engaging ( I know most of my friends love it), for me however I'd rather watch a much more toned down (and less obvious) film about the ballet world that doesn't make my stomach turn.",1293840000,14,2352,4.773955773955774

4246140,5,B0041KKYEM,"Black Swan is one of the most intriguing films to come out of 2010.  Natalie Portman plays the ballerina Nina Sayers, the vexing main character who is overly obsessed with perfectionism and landing the lead in a revamped version of ""Swan Lake."" The film is enthralling and thrilling to watch because of the dramatically intense expressions, dialogue, and sensuality displayed by each character within each particular scene.  And there is also the relentless images throughout the film that will make viewers cringe as they see Nina gripping and peeling away what appears to be a struggle between imagination and reality.

Indeed, it is the coupling of Nina's ballerina nemesis Lily (Mila Kunis), a somewhat rock and roller type of character who adds a bit of the hard-edge elements to the film and ballet director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) who attempt to dispense the freedom that is lacking in Nina's ballet routine as well as to unleash her inexperience and insecurities so that she could play the part of the Black Swan.  But in the process, it is her own personal dilemmas, immaturity, and overprotective mother (Barbara Hershey) who appears much more as a coach rather than a nurturing figure that suggests origins of where Nina's stagnant personal and professional growth may derive from.  And as the film progresses, Nina grapples with expectations that eventually collide with her perfectionism.

Director Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream and The Wrestler) and screenplay writers Mark Heyman and Andres Heinz are attributed to providing the artistry and intensity to the character of Nina.  What appears to be a typical storyline of an over ambitious dancer hungry to the play the lead part of the White and Black Swan within the first 30 minutes of the film, transforms to a downward spiral of hallucinogenic and psychological proportions within the last hour that are highly thought-provoking and shows Nina shockingly unraveling to deterioration right before the viewers' eyes; the climax of the film is deserving of an Academy Award nomination for Portman.

Overall, Black Swan is a film filled with unpredictable twists and turns.  And one does not have to enjoy or have an interest of the ballet in order to understand the storyline that speaks for itself because of the artistic and dramatic contributions of the characters.  It is a film worth watching.",1293667200,3,2378,5.105670103092783
4246141,5,B0041KKYEM,"""Black Swan"", the new film from director Darren Aronofsky (""The Wrestler"". ""Requiem for a Dream"", ""Pi"") tells the story of a young ballerina desperate to play the lead in the company's new production of ""Swan Lake"". The film provides the opportunity for Natalie Portman to turn in a tour-de-force performance, easily the best in her career/

When actors take on new roles, my romantic notions of the film industry try to take over and I like to think they do so for ""the challenge"". They want to try something new, to challenge themselves to create a completely different character. Hopefully, they will lose themselves in the role and come close to making something they are proud of, something the public will remember for the ages. Obviously, this rarely happens, but it is an ideal a lot of actors strive for. But the very concept of ""Movie Star"" works against the possibility. As an actor's star rises, they become more and more recognizable, making it more difficult for them to lose themselves in a particular role. Fame steps in and it becomes all about opening your film at #1 to justify your next $20 million paycheck. It becomes all about becoming the next Will Smith or Bruce Willis. Then it all becomes about maintaining that status with one blockbuster after another.

It is, at first, refreshing to watch ""Black Swan"" and watch Natalie Portman lose herself as she portrays Nina Sayers, the young ballerina. As you watch Nina deal with all of the pressure in her life, you frequently forget you are watching the actress, she goes through so many difficult emotions it is almost remarkable we believe in her portrayal of this character. The role could easily shift into ""over the top"" mode, but Portman shows a fine restraint.

Then, as we begin to get lost in the role with her, and we begin to share her feelings and experience what she is going through, we begin to feel unsettled. We feel her pain, her desperation, her paranoia and we realize the film is pushing us into this unsettling world, making us a bigger part of Nina's life.

""Black Swan"" is about Sayer's obsessions. She has worked all of her life as a ballerina and desperately wants to play the lead. She is the most dedicated dancer, as her mother (Barbara Hershey) comments, and can perform all of the moves perfectly, as Tomas (Vincent Cassel), the company's director notes frequently, but he wants a lead who can also portray the passion necessary for the role. He wants someone who can play both the White Swan and her evil twin, the Black Swan. And to get the performance he wants, he is willing to go employ some unorthodox methods. Can he control her? Can he coax the right performance from her? Can he seduce her? Can he awaken her passion, sensuality and sexuality?

As the pressure on Nina increases, her fears and paranoia grow. A new girl arrives at the company just before Nina wins the coveted role. But Nina notices Lily right away; shortly after she arrives, Nina and Tomas watch Lily practice and she exhibits exactly the type of uninhibited moves the director wants. From that moment, Lily appears to be both supportive and a back-stabber, her attitude and manner seem to change every moment.

Nina still lives with her mom (Hershey) who is extremely supportive and protective, maybe too supportive and protective.  She dotes on her daughter because she has the chance she never had as a ballerina. Nina lives in her childhood bedroom and it looks like it could be a time capsule, twin bed, flowery sheets, and stuffed animals. All of this points to a young woman who has a lack of maturity and this will help lead to her paranoia.

And Nina also becomes a little unhinged when she witnesses the treatment of Beth McIntyre (Winona Ryder), the previous star of the company. It is very clear Beth doesn't want to relinquish the starring role in any production, but she doesn't have any say in the matter. Nina recognizes that she is ascending because Beth is on the way out, but she still idolizes the older ballerina, to a certain extent. Beth's life enters a downward spiral and Nina watches everything with great interest. At first, she is fascinated by Beth's actions and then she quickly becomes alarmed.

Darren Aronofsky is a unique director. He clearly works on projects that interest him and he creates unusual, intense films, films that may not be everyone's cup of tea or reach a large audience. Good for him. If every director only worked on projects that inspire them, films would be a lot better. If people are working on projects that impassion them, they are bound to make a better film.

""Black Swan"" is not a film that everyone will want to see. The film's backdrop of a ballet company is sure to turn away many potential fans. But Aronofsky uses this as the perfect backdrop for his portrait of obsession and claustrophobia. As we get to know Nina, see her watch everyone else, it becomes pretty clear that she is pretty nervous. She wants and needs to become the star, but once she does, she becomes afraid of losing this role to the new girl in the company. Every time she turns around, she senses Lily is watching her. Is she laughing at her? Does she want the lead in the production? Nina decides Lily is someone she should watch, to be aware of her, but also because she is someone who intrigues the young ballerina.

Because the company is small, most of the practice space and backstage area is also small. The bulk of the property is for the theater. So the ballerina's spend a lot of time in very little space, practicing their moves, learning the roles. As Nina becomes more obsessed and consumed, the walls seem to close in on her. It doesn't help that she lives in a small apartment with her mother, sometimes confining herself to her own small room. And because they live in New York, everything seems pushed in. To further emphasize the point, the camera always seems close to people and even then, a lot of people seem to be fluttering around the edges.

As Nina becomes more unhinged, Lily suggests she let herself go, experience a little sexual awakening. Nina seems to latch on this as a way of helping her become the Black Swan, to help her become less inhibited. Tomas seems to tell her as much. So as she becomes obsessive about the role, about the performance, she also starts to unleash this part of her personality, underdeveloped as it is, and this only adds to the confusion and stress her character experiences.

I really liked ""Black Swan"". The director and lead were able to do something few can, fully immerse the viewer in the life of a character. It has some problems, most notably a couple of scenes in which Winona Ryder chews the scenery, but they aren't enough to detract from the overall experience.",1293667200,4,6752,4.663865546218488
4246142,2,B0041KKYEM,"*SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW*

Look guys, I do ""get it"". Before you tell me to ""go watch a Die Hard box set"", let me say that I am an adult moviegoer and I see at least 50 smaller/indie/foreign/what have you movies a year. So therefore that defense it totally useless. OK, now let's get on with the review.

I'm not really down with Darren Aronofsky to begin with. I saw Requiem For A Dream When I was teen and boy, that film messed me up good. I was compelled to watch it after being shown a compilation of clips in an anti-drug presentation, so I sought out my friend, who has quite possibly the biggest DVD collection ever. After it was done... well let's say that movie taught me my lesson about drugs well enough. In the following years his films didn't really do much- Pi was an incomprehensible mess, The Fountain I watched 3 times and didn't get, and The Wrestler started off nice but ended poorly. However, I was interested in Black Swan when I saw the trailer with Paranormal Activity 2, so tonight I finally saw it.

About the dancing scenes, as much as I actively participate in dance but know nothing about ballet, I thought they were well done. Like I said, I know absolutely nothing about ballet, so you best not trust my judgment. I thought Natalie Portman did a fantastic job, and I totally believed that Natalie did her own dancing. I thought the cast did pretty good jobs considering they were not dancers to begin with. Natalie's performance is, of course, the reason to see the movie. She is pure cash money with each performance, and this movie shows. Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel and Barbara Hershey were good too. Oh and the movie looked pretty too. That's where the praise unfortunately stops.

Basically people seem to be raving over nothing but just a middle-of-the-road horror-thriller, but with bits of weird sex added in and several over-the-top shock moments that seemed more unintentionally hilarious than shocking. Basically it's just Mulholland Drive with any being able to care for the characters taken out (We even get the obligatory lesbian sex scene- just minus having a place). In other words, you're getting a typical messed up girl story. I didn't really feel for the Nina character at all. For one, I dunno why she wouldn't just get a red flag when Vincent Cassel's character forced a kiss on her, or when he told her to touch herself. Yet somehow she's smart enough to lash out at her over-controlling mom and tell her ""I'm not 12 anymore"" and dump the plush toys down the garbage disposal.

Truth be told, Black Swan is honestly just an incoherent mess. There are moments of brilliance, which all go to naught when something that reduces you to laughter (at an inappropriate moment too) comes. Yeah as you guessed, I laughed at several moments that weren't meant to be funny. Like when Nina masturbates and finds her mom in the room. Or Winona Ryder going all joker on herself. The film looks nice, has good special effects and performances, but you can dress up a pig in fancy clothing and it's still a pig.

Oh, but what do I know. Like most Oscar bait nowadays, this film will go to win awards and enjoy a bit of hype for a while. And then, of course, like any other movie, people are going to regret the hype and it will end up on most people's overrated lists.

Cue people telling me ""I don't get it"".",1293580800,34,3344,4.54485049833887
4246143,5,B0041KKYEM,"Nina Sayers is an intense ballet dancer intent on attaining perfection. She practices hours a day and doesn't have much of a life outside of her dancing. She lives at home with her overbearing, controlling mother, who is a former ballet dancer, and doesn't have many friends. Her dream is to dance the role of the Swan Queen in the ballet Swan Lake. However, the director of her company thinks she doesn't have what it takes to be both the delicate, fragile White Swan and the seductive, evil Black Swan. She is the embodiment of the White Swan and is technically a very good dancer, but she lacks the passion and ability to let go of her carefully constructed control. The director sees a glimpse of the Black Swan within her, so he casts her in the role. However, he alternates between berating her for her shortcomings and abusing her sexually. In addition, Lily, a new dancer, seems to be perfect for the Black Swan part and seems to be constantly trying to beat Nina in any way possible. Despite their rivalry, Nina is drawn to Lily in an inexplicable way. All of this combined with Nina's quest to get in touch with her dark side are wearing on Nina. She starts to hallucinate and has difficulty discerning fantasy from reality. Can she achieve the level of performance she wants for the lead role while still retaining her sanity or will this role destroy her?

I was afraid I wasn't going to get to see this film in the theater because it wasn't playing in any mainstream theaters and it was slowly leaving the indie ones around LA. It was deservedly nominated for 4 Golden Globes and is now showing at just about every theater. I went to see it with my family on Christmas day because nothing says holiday quite like a psychosexual thriller. My entire family and I were blown away by it. I think the film's success is owed to the characters, the direction, and the music.

The characters in the film are utterly believable and drive the film forward. Natalie Portman bears the bulk of the film on her shoulders, since she's the main character, and does a beautiful job of portraying a ballet dancer in her descent into madness. Nina at the beginning of the film is a little girl living in a grown woman's body. Her mother treats her like a child and she lives in a room fit for a young girl, filled with stuffed animals and pink butterfly wallpaper. She seems to be stunted emotionally with no other friends or family. Her only love and her only life is dancing. This is called into question when the director insists that she is too virginal and innocent to play the lead in Swan Lake. Her fragility and neuroses are uncomfortable to watch. As she tries desperately to impress the director and tries to attain perfection, she starts to mentally break down, but breaks through the childish facade she had been living in. She has to give in to emotion instead of the well practiced control she has. I know from experience that a performer that is technically good, but has no passion or emotion in the performance, is pretty dull to watch or listen to. The destruction of her whole self is needed for her to attain perfection as a dancer in her mind. As she descends into madness, the film gets more and more violent and unpredictable. When she finally dances the coveted role of the Swan Queen in front of an audience, it's absolutely beautiful to watch. The events that go on behind the scenes, real or imagined, give her the perfect state of mind in which to dance either the White or Black Swan roles. Her Black Swan was the opposite of everything that Nina was throughout the rest of the film: predatory, seductive, and almost snakelike. She was almost unrecognizable. At the end of the film, it's almost impossible to tell which events actually happened and which are the product of Nina's fractured mind.

The other characters just add to the film. Vincent Cassel as the director is a kind of hybrid mentor and villain. He pushes her to become a better and greater dancer while using his position of power to abuse her. He simultaneously pushes her forward and breaks her down. I really loved to hate his character. Mila Kunis played Lily, the physical manifestation of the Black Swan. She is the opposite of Lily in almost every way. She is uncontrolled and relies on emotion rather than control in her dancing. The rivalry and friendship between her and Nina is compelling to watch. Barbara Hershey as Nina's mother is extremely creepy and takes the stage mother to a new level. The cast as an ensemble worked brilliantly together.

Darren Aronofsky is a great director. I loved both Requiem for a Dream and The Fountain before Black Swan. In this film, he creates a small world inhabited by dancers that seems separate from the rest of the world. The atmosphere is tense and it seems as if someone could lose a part the minute they do or say the wrong thing. There are many things that aren't talked about in the open, but gossiped about quietly amongst the dancers. I loved the use of the handheld cameras and closeups. It gave the film an intimate, claustrophobic feeling as well as enhanced the off-kilter route of Nina's mind. The only part of the film that felt open and spacious was on the stage.

I have enjoyed many of Clint Mansell's film scores, including The Fountain, Requiem for a Dream, and Moon, but I think I enjoy Black Swan the most. It features, of course, Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake ballet music and Clint Mansell's unique ambient music with it. His music is largely repetitive and different from usual film scores, opting to use a more modern as opposed to classical approach. I thought the placement of the source music was perfect, as were his additions. The score is really what helped build up the tension in the film for me. I have been listening to the score pretty much nonstop since I saw the film. Here is one of my favorite tracks, Perfection, which is the music that Nina dances to as the Black Swan.

I really enjoyed this film. I like its feminist undertones, mainly that it deals with issues that plague primarily women, such as eating disorders, infantilization, objectification, self mutilation, etc. I think, to some extent, the film is about any woman's drive to be the ideal woman that is, for most women, unattainable without surgery. It's a unique, dark, and disturbing film. I would highly recommend this to everyone.",1293580800,6,6375,4.6222418358340684
4246144,5,B0041KKYEM,"We went expecting the absolute worst, having been fully briefed ahead of time about the film's misogyny and the plain blank ridiculousness of its plot and its various setups.

All ballet movies are somewhat silly, though this one makes something like CENTER STAGE seem like a hard-hitting documentary; and yet I wouldn't hesitate to recommend BLACK SWAN even to Moira Shearer herself if she rose up from her grave and asked what was playing at the movies.  It has something, perhaps the tremendous conviction of the director and his lead actress, that makes its watchable at all times, even when the sheer level of camp rises to over your head, which is often believe me.  Someone said that Natalie Portman, as Nina Sayers, wears one expression on her face through the whole movie--that's not quite true, but BS veterans will know which expression my catty friend was speaking of.  She is extraordinarily disciplined in the part, and it looks crazy difficult, so I predict that she will get the award for this, that Catherine Deneuve should have gotten for REPULSION, the movie this mimics in many ways.  Some have compared BS to SHOWGIRLS, except while that Gina Gershon is miles better than Mila Kunis at playing the sensual, careless rival, Portman seems really to believe in Nina in a way that Elizabeth Berkley always seemed too timid too really go there.  Plus, the costumes and the hair and the makeup (in BS) are all astonishing, probably as good as the ones in the original RED SHOES.

The problem with BLACK SWAN, finally, is that the cards seem stacked from the beginning against poor Nina.  She has nothing from the beginning of the movie, and never gets anything (except briefly, she gets to replace Beth MacIntyre)--(and Winona Ryder makes sure Nina never gets to enjoy a moment of that victory).  She has no men, no friends, no fun, a horrible mother and a lousy life.  She has Portman's beauty and grace, but not 15 minutes into the picture she has that rash on her back where it almost seems wings are going to grow.  The movie makes sure that Nina suffers with an almost obscene glory.  In casting Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder as look-alike avatars for Nina, Aronofsky insures that we will (perhaps subconsciously) pity Portman for her present-day good looks, so like Audrey Hepburn's in some shots), because we see what happened to Hershey and Ryder and conclude that time eats away at beauty just like the garbage can opening up its yawning mouth to accept the whole giant cake Hershey orders for Portman in the film's cruelest scene.",1293580800,5,2558,4.788636363636364
4246145,3,B0041KKYEM,"At the center of most all of Darren Aronofsky's movies are characters driven by obsession and addiction. Black Swan is no different. Natalie Portman plays Nina Sayers, a ballerina in the prestigious New York City ballet who has the opportunity to perform in the role of a lifetime, and will stop at nothing to perfect it. The only problem is that the she has both a life as well as a ballet routine built upon structure and discipline.  The dual sided role of Swan Queen also requires a simplicity and grace that she painfully (literally) struggles to find.

  Nina is also forced to deal with a repressive and controlling mother (Barbara Hershey) who wants nothing more than her daughter to have the glamorous ballet career that she was forced to give up, as well as the star newcomer Lilly (Mila Kunis) whom she believes wants nothing more than to steal her coveted role as the Swan Queen.  As the performance draws closer, the paranoia and tension begin to mount and the line between reality and delusion begin to fade.

  The one thing this movie can't escape is that it's a character driven film that doesn't have any characters worth caring about. While many critics have noted the similarities between this film and Aronofsky's last movie The Wrestler, I feel like latter movie succeeded much more because it had characters you could actually sympathize with.  Sure, Mickey Rourke played an over the hill, self-absorbed, and alcoholic wrestler, but man, when he belted out singing ""Round and Round"" at the bar to Marisa Tomei, it was hard not to love the guy.

  When is all is said and done, it's an average story with great performance that Aronofsky directs the hell out of. I just found it tough at times to really make sense of it all. What's that? We're supposed to figure it out ourselves? Screw that. I'm watching Toy Story.",1293494400,4,1839,4.7125
4246146,1,B0041KKYEM,"This is one of the worst films I've seen in a long while. The plot concerns itself with the cutthroat world of female ballet performers and follows a rather predictable set of formulas. We have the good girl (Portman) whose position is threatened by the bad girl (Kunis). We have the bad mother lurking in the background. Then we have the unleashing of the ""dark"" side of the good girl through competition which the good girl then struggles to control. Its all a set of very old cliches seen many times before.

There is a term in music, overproduced, that has bearing on this film. Darren Aronofsky ""overproduces"" the film in the sense that he puts heavy layers of technique and gimmick over everything. A little of what he is doing would be ok, but its layered so thick that it drags down the entire film. Too much playing with perspective. Too much layering in of dream sequences. Too much emotion. Too many tantrums. Too much of everything.

I don't think much of the cast either. I've never understood what people see in Natalie Portman as an actress. Her performance here is one-dimensional. She gives us a workaholic pushing toward a breakdown and a woman becoming a monster. But there is nothing special to what she does. Its a very predictable and ordinary performance with no particular edge to it. Mila Kunis does nothing interesting and mostly plays one of her stock characters. Vincent Cassel is too over-the-top to take seriously. Winona Ryder gives her best performance in a very long time, but the range is limited by the overwhelming emotional intensity that the film pushes all the time. Barbara Hershey brings no subtilty to speak of to her part.

The film plays with every cliche with regard to women in the book. But to make these chiches work today requires doing unexpected things with them or giving performances that do subtile things with them. But the film on every account is obvious and almost overbearing.

The film was a good idea in conception. But with the emotional intensity cranked to 11, all the cliches, all the dream sequences, the overproduced visuals and the bleak nature of the story, it fails. The good story here was in athletic and competitive nature of ballet. The good story would have been in an examination of why and how people push themselves to the very top. A good story would have been more in the real world. But it is what it is.

Combine ""Showgirls"" with ""Single White Female"", add in hallucinations ala David Cronenberg, ratchet up the emotional intensity to 11, add in weird perspectives and you get Black Swan. It will be highly praised for six months and then forgotten.",1293494400,44,2631,4.723311546840959
4246147,5,B0041KKYEM,"Natalie Portman delivers the performance of a lifetime in Darren Aronofsky's latest psycho-thriller, Black Swan. Nina, played by Portman, is a child-like ballerina dancing for a prestigious New York dance company. Despite years of immaculate discipline, her inability to lose herself in her dancing has prevented the company's director (Vincent Cassel) from giving her the roles she wants. But when he decides to cast Nina as the Swan Queen in the upcoming production of Swan Lake, despite her trouble dancing the part of the Black Swan, she is forced onto a disturbing descent into the darkest recesses of her troubled mind in a quest to uncover her inner Black Swan.

Aronofsky blends lyrical dance sequences with shocking moments of traditional horror in this dark portrayal of mental illness and the stresses of life as a ballerina. The costume design is stunning in its beauty and symbolism, though it occasionally runs the risk of being too on-the-nose with its white and black color scheme. Similarly, Nina's increasingly horrifying hallucinations make physical monsters of the abstract longings that prey on her, as when her eyes turn blood red after an act of physical violence. As a result, it becomes impossible at times to distinguish between reality and fiction in Nina's world, as is often the case in scenes involving Nina's rival and shadow self, Lily (Mila Kunis). Kunis shines as the darkly seductive ballerina from San Francisco, whose dangerous beauty has Nina vacillating between feelings of threatened paranoia and longing. But whether Lily even exists is only one of many questions that Aronofsky leaves hanging at the end of the film. Labyrinthine in its complexity, Black Swan is also one of the most shocking and beautiful films I've seen lately. Five stars.",1293235200,,1784,5.151724137931034
4246148,5,B0041KKYEM,"Hands down the best film of 2010, probably the best film of the decade.  Ballet... has never been one of my interests.  About the only thing I know about dance is that these performers are under enormous physical and mental stress and it is an art which deserves the highest of our respect.  Don't let the fact that you're not a ballet fan stop you from seeing this movie.

It was a wild roller-coaster ride of paranoia and terror.  The movie starts us off with an uneasy feeling as we are immediately swept into the life of this dancer through her eyes.  We feel the stress and the polite smiles of people we do not trust.  The film takes some wicked turns which left me lost and scrambling to figure out which cliff I was just tossed from.  Never once did the ride slow down as my brain scrambled to re-sort the details of what I was seeing.

Further and further we plunge into madness and very uncomfortable imagery as the plot tosses us left and right, faster and faster, then leaves us in a smoldering heap of rubble as we crash to stop.  We were left speechless and exhausted.  There is no spoon feeding, patronizing, or hand holding in this film.  It's fast, furious, sometimes erotic, and uncomfortable to watch as you plunge through a dark tunnel on a wicked ride of madness.

Enjoy it.",1293235200,2,1295,4.436440677966102
4246149,5,B0041KKYEM,"Okay, I've let Black Swan sink in for about half a day now before writing my review, which needed to be done. The more I think back on it, the better it becomes. Yes, this is an art-house type of film and like the other movies from director, Darren Aronofsky, it has no problem strolling into some very weird territory. The Wrestler is the most mainstream we have gotten from Aronofsky so far and it was my favorite movie of his until today. I know Requiem for a Dream has a lot of fans and I admire the it, though watching it is close to torture because it's just that realistic and disturbing, but Black Swan is head and shoulders above everything I have seen so far this year, save for Inception.

The acting is exceptional all around. Everybody just fits into place perfectly. Natalie Portman is flat out jaw dropping as the obsessive and uptight Nina. Not only is her acting better than any other actress I've seen in a long time, but her physical transformation is just as astonishing. Dropping 20 pounds off an already small frame and doing 90% of the dancing is no small feat. She better get an Oscar! Mila Kunis is also good in a smaller than expected role as her rival. Portman's Nina is cold and childish, while Kunis brings sensuality and seductiveness to her part. Vincent Cassel, Barabara Hershey and Winona Ryder make up the rest of the strong supporting cast.

Other than the acting, the cinematography and music elevate what would normally be rather boring scenes into something unique and interesting.

If you are anything like I was when I first heard about Black Swan and the ballet setting, you'll be missing out on the thriller/horror elements that turn this thing dark and messy. Sure the ballet is a major part of the film, but there are many other layers.

Black Swan has regained my faith in modern cinema. It's so nice to have an original filmmaker with new ideas in the age of something as awful as Little Fockers. I'm looking forward to see what he has up his sleeve for us next.",1293148800,8,2008,4.523415977961433

4246152,5,B0041KKYEM,"Nina has to be perfect, not good or great or excellent or top notch, she has to be 100%. Nina Sayers is chosen to star in her New York ballet company's production of Swan Lake, but she having a little trouble getting into the roll. Nina is able to throw herself into the role of the White Swan with no problem. The White Swan is pure and unvarnished, just like Nina. The Black Swan is not. She's soiled and tarnished a flowing succubus. Nina is not. Nina is timid, Nina is frigid, Nina is so high strung her feet are just barely touching the atmosphere

Nina Sayer is devoted to ballet in the truest sense of the word; Nina doesn't go out, doesn't have any friends, and doesn't have a personal life. Her world is dancing and nothing but dancing. And it's starting to break her. She develops a nervous scratching habit that tears up her skin, and she starts seeing things, and hearing things.

A new addition to the company Lily, is the opposite from Nina, Lily is from San Francisco and goes with the flow, she smokes, wolfs down hamburgers and drops ecstasy(or acid). A first threaten by Lily, Nina develops a strained friendship that jumps back and forth between lustful when Lily shows Nina how to let loose to murderous when Lily because Nina's backup. It is only when Nina becomes murderous that the Black Swan comes out with vengeance, enabling Nina to dance at the premier of the play with such ease and relaxation that between sets Nina has a post-orgasmic glow on her pale face.

The old ballerina came out in both Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis, both had done ballet as young girls but Darren Aronofsky had them train a year in advance of filming, both women lost 20 pounds, Portman who is about hundred pounds wet, is almost a stick figure, her feet became so tone that she could bend railroad spikes with her toes. One of them actually had a toe nail ripped out and Portman apparently dislocated one rib and got a concussion.",1292889600,2,1937,4.497159090909091
4246153,5,B0041KKYEM,"Black Swan is an imaginative thriller that keeps one on the edge of their seat.  The success of the film is due to the remarkable performance of Natalie Portman as Nina Sayers.  Her character is always on the edge, first to win the role of the Swan Queen, then to translate her cool perfection into the more passionate role of the Black Swan.  Her character is unsettled and going through a nervous breakdown as she tries to be the perfect dancer and cope with her own feelings of failure and that, once she s a success, that her life will go downhill until she is discarded.

It is interesting to compare Black Swan to the ballet Swan Lake. The original libretto of Swan Lake ballet had Prince Siegfried and Odette (the Swan Queen) die together, thus releasing the handmaidens from the sorcerer's curse.  However, the ending was considered too sad so the ballet was changed to allow the prince and Odette live and break the spell.  The film goes back to the more tragic ending.  The threatening bird-like dancer who appears at the beginning of the film is the sorcerer responsible for the curse in the ballet.  So Nina is cursed herself into striving for perfection that is her own undoing

The film plays off Nina's fears that someone will take her place in the role of the Black Swan; her represses sexual nature and fears that she will be discarded like the former prima ballerina Beth Macintyre (Winona Ryder).  Adding to Nina's insecurity is Lily who appears to want to thwart Nina to claim the role of the Swan Queen/Black Swan while professing to admire her.  Nina's mother (played by Barbara Hershey) is pushing her daughter into the spotlight from her own failure to become a ballet star.

Natalie Portman's performance is remarkable for the range of emotions she displays. She is on screen for almost all of the film, and it is her performance that makes the film. The supporting cast is also excellent: Barbara Hershey is obsessive in subtitle ways about her daughter's success down to a ballerina music box that plays music from Swan Lake. Mila Kunis was convincing as her rival, down the wings tattooed on her back and Winona Ryder turns in a solid performance as the spurred Beth.

The film is beautifully photographed and the ballet scenes are nicely choreographed.  Potential viewers should be aware that the film is very intense at times as we are drawn into Nina's hallucinations.  Black Swan is also among the most creative films in recent memory and is certainly a film that cannot be forgotten.",1292803200,,2516,4.712328767123288
4246154,5,B0041KKYEM,"BLACK SWAN is the story of a ballerina driven to insanity by her drive to succeed and to be perfect.  It's also one of the more purely fascinating movies of 2010.  Natalie Portman gives the performance of her career as Nina, the dancer.  Nina has been with the professional ballet company headed by Thomas (Vincent Cassel) for a number of years, and she's hoping this will be the year she gets a lead role.  He's reviving SWAN LAKE, and needs a new White Swan/Black Swan.  Nina is a technically proficient dancer who will do well as the prim, proper, chaste White Swan.  But where is her fiery passion and urgency that will be needed to play the Black Swan?  She doesn't dance with the lack of self-control that his character calls for.

Portman's character is something of a clich&eacute;.  How many times do we see the driven perfectionist who can't let go and allow herself to let her feelings show because she's so concerned with getting the technical aspects perfect?  It's hardly a new idea.  Neither is the introduction of the character Lily (Mila Kunis), a carefree, full-of-smiles dancer who joins the company.  She isn't so dedicated to her art that she can't go out and party.  But she dances with the ease and passion that Portman cannot muster.  The two develop a tentative relationship...but is Lily really a fierce competitor, trying to psyche out Nina?

And Nina doesn't need much mental manipulation.  She lives with her domineering mother (Barbara Hershey), a failed dancer who babies and controls her daughter to the point of suffocation.  Nina is also mentally teased by Thomas...who tries to trick and manipulate his dancer into showing something new on stage.  To say that Nina puts tremendous pressure on herself would be an understatement.  She chews her nails and compulsively scratches herself, leaving tears in her skin.  And she sometimes sees things that aren't there.  Nina is tightly wound, neurotic and obsessive when the film begins.  As things progress, we can see, with great clarity, how she begins to lose herself more and more.

I don't want to say much more, because the journey Nina takes is fascinating.  What's amazing to me is that this movie is really a potboiler or melodrama.  It follows a clich&eacute;d path, treads familiar ground.  Yet every moment of it feels new and real and dangerous.  Director Darrin Aronofsky (THE WRESTLER) has done an amazing job of constructing the film to feel like a deep psychological study and a period thriller at the same time.  It feels like something from the `60s or `70s and like something modern and edgy at the same time.  He has chosen to film in digital video, and for once, the low budget choice works.  The film has a slight darkness and fuzziness to it that only helps the mood.

The screenwriters have also written about the details of ballet and SWAN LAKE in a way that lets viewers totally unfamiliar with the story have a good sense of what is going on.  We understand the show and what Nina is trying to achieve.  And for those many folks who say the ending is hard to figure out, I can only say, ""you're trying too hard.""  It is a fascinating and gripping ending...but it is quite clear.  Don't be turned away because you think you won't be able to ""get"" the film.  I found it surprisingly accessible.  My 18 year-old daughter had no trouble grasping it. (Although there was enough sexuality in the film to make me uncomfortable at having brought her.)  I didn't hear people grumbling on the way out of the theater either (and the place was packed, by the way...I think this little art film is going to make some pretty decent money.)

And please don't miss it, because you'll miss some good (even great) performances.  Cassel is perfectly cast in the very clich&eacute;d role of the artistic director.  Pompous, self-centered and yet somehow alluring...we see the creative side along with his cruelty.  Hershey is frightening in her role...reminding me of Bette Davis in her BABY JANE days.  And Mila Kunis continues to tackle unexpected and challenging roles...and with BLACK SWAN, she has put her days as Jackie on THAT `70S SHOW behind her.  And Natalie Portman is a slam dunk for an Oscar nomination with her riveting performance.  She's on screen for the entire film, and must accomplish much of the dancing herself.  She looks weary, frightened, fragile, strong and dedicated.  Her work here is so accomplished and takes us on such a journey; I was exhausted by the end because the ferocity of her work gripped me so tightly.  It's easily the best female performance of the year.  For her work alone, the movie is worth seeing.  Fortunately, there's plenty else to enjoy in the gripping, highly-recommended BLACK SWAN.",1292716800,3,4724,4.785891089108911
4246155,1,B0041KKYEM,"""Black Swan"" is a bombastic, pretentious, middlebrow soap opera that struggles hard to say something profound about art and women, but manages to peddle hateful lies about both art and women. Men who've read too much Freud and have no understanding of women and teen Goth girls who wear black fingernail polish will embrace ""Black Swan"" passionately.

""Black Swan"" has no rise in tension, no complication of plot. The entire film is a bleak, dreary, depiction of a schizophrenic who hallucinates and wears nice ballet costumes. Nina (Natalie Portman) is never depicted as having any normal life or healthy relationships the audience might care about her losing. From start to finish, the film features tight close-ups on Portman's anguished face as she careens through one hallucination, and one dance rehearsal, after another. Since Nina's world is so relentlessly bleak, horrific - and unreal - from the start, we can't invest in her. We can't care about her losing her hold on sanity, because she is shown from the get-go to have no hold on sanity. We can't care about her losing her friendships, or her hope, because she has no friendships and she has no hope. Nothing changes. Nothing is at stake. Nina is as big of a messy basket case an hour into the film as she was at the beginning. The endless close-ups on Nina's anguished face get old really fast.

The filmgoer comes to understand disastrously quickly that Aronofsky's bag of tricks is limited. The sets are all in stiflingly monotonous black and white, no doubt to show how deep of a film this is. Since viewers don't know which scenes are real and which are Nina's hallucinations, it's impossible to invest in them.

The one bright spot in the film is Vincent Cassel, who relishes a bath in smarm as a ballet troupe's sadistic, manipulative, and very naughty director. He's the only one who has any fun, and God bless him for it. He could probably dance on the deck of the Titanic. With his French bonhomie and predatory amorality, Cassel is a cross between Maurice Chevalier and George Sanders.

""Black Swan"" tells us that women are fragile and neurotic and if they do anything remarkable it makes them crazy. Craziness, in women, oddly parallels male sex fantasies. When women go crazy they have catfights with other women, including their moms, they torture their bodies and others in bloody, gory ways, they begin to pleasure themselves in visually artistic ways, and then they engage in same-gender erotic expression. Most of the women involved are young, fit, and minimally clad. How convenient for any kinky men watching this movie!

Is this film misogynist? Ask yourself this, would Aronofksy make a parallel film about a football linebacker who goes nuts because being a football linebacker is a big stress? Yeah, I didn't think so, either. Of course this film is misogynist. ""Black Swan"" is a throwback to soft-core women's prison flics and misogynist film noir like 1947's ""Possessed,"" that depicted Joan Crawford driven mad by passion.

""Black Swan"" struggles really hard to say big things about art: that the drive for perfection can drive you mad, that artists sacrifice for their art, that art and madness are virtually identical. This viewer just cannot believe that someone suffering from full blown schizophrenia could become the prima ballerina of a high powered NYC ballet troupe. Ballet is not the whim of an afternoon. Ballet demands a lifetime of showing up on time, getting along with colleagues, and successful performance. Someone as ill as Nina could not have carried this off.

""Black Swan"" wants us to believe the old, crude, invidious lie that art equals madness. It doesn't. There have been some high-profile artists who were also mentally ill, but that the public tends to focus on these people doesn't make art and madness the same thing. For most artists, art means years of unpaid hard work, dedication, self-discipline, and self-restraint. The creation of powerful art demands that the artist be, not crazier than the bulk of the population, but saner. Not buying into popular lies arouses envy and suspicion. Some people who hate art and artists are often simply envious of art and artists. And some people really don't understand art or artists and so they feel threatened and enraged by art and artists. It is these people who have given us the lie that art and madness are identical. Aronofsky doesn't do art or artists any favors by peddling this lie.",1292716800,95,4457,4.9188829787234045
4246156,5,B0041KKYEM,"""Black Swan"" is a fantastic psychological thriller that chronicles one determined ballerina, Nina (Natalie Portman), as she rises to the top of her craft, landing the roles of the White Swan and the Black Swan in her company's production of ""Swan Lake."" Nina has a hard time letting loose and finding the passion needed to portray the Black Swan. The stress of the production leads her to experience physical ailments, engage in wicked banter with her mother (Barbara Hershey), and become paranoid about a perceived rivalry with a new dancer (Mila Kunis). This is a terrifying movie, far scarier than most horror movies that have emerged in the last decade. Portman's performance is astonishing and all but guarantees her an Oscar nod. The final dance sequence in the film is unbelievable, and I literally got chills at the end of the movie, which never happens. Definitely splurge to see ""Black Swan"" in the theatre...it's destined to become a classic.",1292630400,3,953,5.0

She begins to break down under the strain of a demanding choreographer, who insists she be more passionate, and a controlling mother who wishes her to remain a biddable child. I never expected a story about ballerinas could be so viscerally intense - at once moving and horrific. It's a small, simple film that aims to do just what good psychological horror does, to affect the viewer, to disorient and frighten. Worked for me.",1292630400,,765,4.937984496124031
4246158,5,B0041KKYEM,"Darren Aronofsky's ""Black Swan"" ingeniously merges the spectacle of dance with the base emotions of melodrama, two schools of theatricality that, if done right, are equally demanding. The result is a lurid, daring, and mesmerizing psychological thriller, one that's founded on the idea that the pursuit of perfection is not a matter of time or effort but of sanity. The line between reality and fantasy is at times easily distinguishable, but at other times is blurred to the point of sheer confusion. It challenges perceptions with questionable events and unreliable characterizations - which, I have no doubt whatsoever, were intentionally written that way. It continuously frightens us, and yet it lures us in with disturbing but beautiful imagery. This is the kind of film you don't simply watch. You experience it.

This could not have been an easy ride for star Natalie Portman. She and Aronofsky must have known that the film's success would depend entirely on her, for her character doesn't merely drive the plot but is in fact the plot itself. Not only would she have to be believable, she would also have to be willing to tax herself physically and emotionally - and numerically, assuming you choose to interpret her work as a duel role. She would have to endure six months of ballet training and body toning. It would be a commitment, not an acting job. She was clearly more than qualified to meet these demands; her performance is brave, complex, stirring, and nothing short of extraordinary.

Portman plays Nina Sayers, a New York ballet dancer driven by the need to be perfect. She practices rigorously. She rarely eats, and what little she does eat, she throws up. She auditions for the role of the Swan Queen in Tchaikovsky's ""Swan Lake,"" which would require her to give a duel performance. The director, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), has already told her that he would be featuring her more this season. Still, there seems to be room for improvement; while he sees nothing wrong with her interpretation of the innocent and elegant White Swan, he sees all technique and no passion with the devious and sensual Black Swan. More suited for the latter is Lily (Mila Kunis) a new dancer from San Francisco. She's everything Nina is not: Relaxed, outgoing, a little bawdy, and embracing of her imperfections.

Leroy, lecherous and creepy, tells Nina that she must be seductive as the Black Swan. She must lose herself in the role. She must be in touch with her own body. Nina would know nothing about this. She's cared for and encouraged by her mother, Erica (Barbara Hershey), a former dancer whose expressions of love mask an alarming psychological fixation, one that fuels her artistic abilities and gives no latitude for privacy or trust. Into Nina's life enters Lily, who seems friendly enough but may actually be plotting to take over the duel role in ""Swan Lake."" She eventually understands the plight of Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder), an aging ballerina who was once a great star but has now been replaced.

Nina, her rivalry with Lily doubling as a strange friendship, is ultimately consumed with revenge fantasies, ones that get increasingly shocking as the opening night of ""Swan Lake"" approaches. Little by little, her grasp on reality slips. For no apparent reason, a rash on her shoulder turns into a wound. Does she deal with the stress of attaining perfection by mutilating herself? Her reflection isn't quite in sync with her body - or perhaps it's the other way around. Events that seem to have taken place may not have. People who appear may not actually be there, and vice versa. The more Nina's world unravels, the more we can't stop watching; reality fades into a hypnotic dreamscape of primal urges. Some are deeply unsettling. Others include a lesbian love scene that would be frightening were it not so sexy.

Aronofsky visualizes Nina's descent in two distinct ways. One is through the use of computer-generated imagery, and while that may be expected in this day and age (perhaps even required), it allows for the inclusion of specific symbols that are necessary to advance the story. The other is through the handheld camera work, giving the film an unsteady look. Close up shots are naturally jerky. He follows characters as they walk from one room to another. He circles dancers in broad, dramatic sweeps during major dance sequences. The images literally move along with the plot. This is what makes ""Black Swan"" some kind of bizarre masterpiece. It's a dark and shocking drama that stimulates the senses and plays on emotions.",1292371200,12,4570,4.92987012987013
4246159,5,B0041KKYEM,"Black Swan is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  I just saw it a few days ago and I plan to see it a few more --or maybe a few more than ""a few"" times-- before it leaves the theaters.  And I know I'll buy the DVD when that comes out and watch it more times with the luxury of being able to study why it worked so well by virtue of my DVD player's pause, rewind, and slow-motion buttons.

In this review I will explain why the movie had such an impact on me and then in a section below the word ""spoilers"" I will make a few comments about the plot and particularly the ending.

Why was it so compelling a film?  Because it was a powerful story, brilliantly executed, and with incredible performances by four of the lead cast.

The story line is quite gripping.  We watch someone who is beautiful, talented, driven to perfection and incredibly fragile take on a performance that quite literally pushes her into a psychotic break.  We cheer for Nina Sayers; we pity her; and we fear for her as the twisty plot unfolds springing surprises on the viewer along the way.

The film is beautifully staged.  It made ballet accessible for me and I imagine a lot of other people who were not into it.  I found both Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis's dancing to be very convincing and moving.  The film deftly presents us with moments of beauty (especially Nina's ultimate performance as the Black Swan) and moments of horror when the film plays its little tricks to convince us she is losing her mind.

The performances were what sold it in the end.  Natalie Portman's portrayal of Nina was utterly convincing as someone teetering on the edge of madness.  And I suspect I'm not alone among guys who would find themselves wishing they could rescue her from her plight.

Mila Kunis, Vincent Kassel, and Barhara Hershey also did tremendous work.  Mila made a wonderful foil to Nina as Lily, the embodiment of what the Black Swan should have been...a carefree, beautiful, sexy woman.  Vincent Kassel in the role of Thomas Leroy gave a performance that ensured a character that could have amounted to a hateful cliche was believable and one could easily understand why Nina would find him so captivating and overwhelming.

Finally, Barbara Hershey turned in a fine performance as Nina's damaged mother, someone who loved her daughter but in a way that was twisted and malign and profoundly unnerving.

<SPOILERS>

You'll notice I left out Winona Ryder from my list above.  It's not that she did a bad job in the part she played of Beth, the former prima ballerina.  It's just that the character was such a small part...it could have been done by anyone.  I find myself wondering if there were scenes involving her that wound up on the cutting room floor since a draft of the shooting script I saw had more scenes with her in it.  It's not a flaw to the movie but I do wonder why an actress of Ryder's caliber was willing to do such a small role.

A lot has been made of ""anger and ecstasy fueled lesbian hate sex"" between the characters of Nina and Lily.  I actually thought there were other scenes that were sexier (Nina ""touching herself"" and a scene where Thomas shows Nina what it's like to be seduced).  It's also important to remember that Nina and Lily's encounter was just a figment of Nina's burgeoning psychosis and also an indicator of how repressed she was (it was pretty clear she was a virgin).

I also think that critics who describe the relationship between Lily and Nina as a ""twisted friendship"" are missing the boat on that.  The friendship is only twisted as seen through Nina's distorted view.  I think that Nina's psychosis assigned Lily, the role of nemesis and rival that she really did not play in reality.

Finally, here are my thoughts about the ending.  It's been the subject of a lot of debate on the Internet Movie Database.  Some people are convinced that Nina died in the end after giving a phenomenal performance as the Black Swan...that when she thought she killed her ""rival"" Lily, she only managed to wound herself with a shard from the mirror she broke.

I think the movie is deliberately ambiguous about what really happened.  My interpretation of what did was that Nina did manage to hurt herself but not all that badly...which would explain why she was able to to perform as the Black Swan and the White Swan instead of being found in a pool of her own blood in her dressing room.  I flatly reject the idea that she could have danced the way she did if she was as badly hurt as she was.  I think it's more believable to conclude that Nina may have been convinced she had mortally wounded herself but was simply overcome by her psychosis and the fact that in the end she really had pulled it off and become perfect.",1292371200,4,4740,4.507025761124122
4246160,2,B0041KKYEM,Nearly everything in this film is spot on until the final act; Aronofsky takes the story from deliciously dizzying to borderline ridiculous. You could feel the audience collectively refuse to suspend disbelief enough to have any sort of satisfaction at this curtain call. A shame that the bad ending spoils an otherwise beautiful and intriguing experience.,1292284800,6,356,5.375
4246161,4,B0041KKYEM,"When we tried to see this, every showing was sold out -except for the very last one of the evening. So we bought our tickets, strolled around a mall, and waited eagerly to view the film. It was worth the wait even though the movie had some significant flaws (more about that soon). I do understand why Natalie Portman has gotten much acclaim for her role as Nina, a young ballerina who seems to be on the rise to stardom. She might even win an Oscar for her performance. The role is extremely demanding and it is clear that she worked hard to get her body to fit the part, looking particularly thin (as many ballerinas do, almost anorexic). She also stretched her acting chops and took significant risks, including some fairly graphic sexual scenes as well as a believable depiction of a young woman with an unhinged mind.

However, I felt very ambivalent about this film and wasn't the only one. Audiences leaving the theater were either talking positively about the film or giving it a thumbs down. Portman is superb when revealing how she tries to dig deeply within herself to portray both the White and Black Swan. The part of the White Swan comes easily to her but the darker, riskier role of the Black Swan taxes her emotionally. Nina is assured that she has the moves of an experienced ballerina. But she is criticized by the ballet company's director for her inability to bring passion to the role of the Black Swan.

Dance fans will find a wealth of stunning choreography and insight into some parts of the world of ballet. Even those who aren't fond of ballet should be entranced by the dance scenes. I certainly was. But there seemed to be too many stereotypes. Barbara Hershey is usually a reliable actress but she seems to be off kilter here, being the overprotective mother. Nina's desire to be ""perfect"" resonates beyond the movie and serves as a reminder of how dancers often turn to self-destructive acts to stay in shape - throwing up, being anorexic or bulemic and more. In that regard, Nina could be at an extreme end of a spectrum of mental illness that may be all too prevalent in the dance world...although not as over the top as Nina (or let's hope not).

Suspense is definitely created during scenes when it is hard to separate Nina's truth from fantasy. What is Nina actually seeing and what is an illusion? In some parts of the movie it is clear that she is hallucinating...in others, not so much so. In the end, I couldn't quite buy this as a psychological drama but thought it veered closer to a horror movie. Parts of this film were extremely painful to watch and if you have trouble watching someone in physical pain, including plenty of blood, consider yourself forewarned. There were plenty of gasps and moans from the audience during the particularly gruesome scenes.

In the end, I couldn't help wondering: will this movie stand the test of time? Odds are high that viewers will always be entranced by the very lovely Natalie Portman. But will the movie's theme and plot development seem credible during repeat viewings? Only time will tell whether this becomes a classic dance and psychological/horror film or simply a temporary sensation.",1292198400,5,3175,4.684587813620071
4246162,5,B0041KKYEM,"This is one of the most ""BRILLIANT"" films I have seen in long time. Its the story of a girl who goes mentally INSANE to say the least. Natalie Portman has always been one of my favorite actresses. And Mila Kunis I have always thought had such a straight forward and hard edge about her. The movie delivered everything and anything you could ask for. Beautiful cinematography - high sexual tension - fantasies and lurid intense horror and mayhem ! Her performance was amazing very much out of her character. I have never seen Natalie Portman like that and never thought she was capable of such. Beware, there are a lot of disturbing images in the film as well as mutilation sequences. I can't wait to own this film when it comes out finally on Bluray. In my opinion this is a cross between Showgirls and Mulholland Dr. But I think this movie is definitely in a league of its own for sure. I waited two hours before I could even get into the theater but it was worth it. I just don't want to spoil the film for anyone out there so this will be a short review. Go see the film it's her best since ""Closer"". The thing that you will have do decipher the most is what is happening. You have to depict between what is real and is not real and some of the sequences are obvious. ""Black Swan"" is like one long Nightmare that shows how the mentally insane thinks. Some images will make you cringed in your seat for sure.",1292025600,6,1410,4.304511278195489
4246163,5,B0041KKYEM,"Peter Tchikovsky's great ballet, ""Swan Lake"" tells the story of a princess who has been transformed into a white swan and needs true love to be redeemed.  Her redemption is thwarted by an evil character, the black swan. Director Darren Arnofsky's new movie, ""The Black Swan"" is based upon Tchaikovsy's ballet with a new symbolism. In the movie, the ballet director, Thomas, (Vincent Cassel) decides to give a new reading to the much-performed ballet by having the same ballerina perform the character of the white and the black swan, a taxing role indeed.

Thomas holds auditions for the part. A dedicated, long-standing member of the company, Nina (Natalie Portman) auditions and is told she would be perfect for the white swan but lacks the passion and evil and ability to let herself go -- qualities necessary to play the black swan.  Thomas wants to cast a rival, free-spirited walk-in dancer, Lily (Mila Kunis) for the part, but an unexpected passionate outburst from Nina convinces him otherwise.  She gets the part.

Nina is a devoted and gifted dancer. But she is prim and proper, represses her impulses, and his limited sexual experience.  She lives at home with a domineering mother, herself a failed ballerina. Throughout the movie, in many rehearsals and other contacts, Thomas tries to work with Nina to get her to lose her inhibitions in order to portray the black swan as well as, most likely, to seduce her.

The movie develops a great deal of sexual tension and jealous rivalry between Nina and Lily. In a life devoted to art, Nina gradually changes from a character neurotic and repressed to a woman of sexuality and passion able to understand and dance the black swan from within.  The price of her increased gift as a dancer is madness.  The movie suggests something of the nature of good and evil -- their polarity but also their disturbing relationship and identity.  The movie also suggests the commitment and single-minded devotion of artistic creation.  It is also a subtle horror story about the descent into madness.  Not least, the movie reminded me of Tchaikovsky's great score, played throughout, which I have not heard for a long time and which I want to revisit with this movie in mind.

""Black Swan"" premiered at the Venice Film Festival in September, 2010 where it received an overwhelming response. It has been a surprising success at the box office. The movie is similar in many ways to an earlier film of Arnofsky's, ""The Wrestler"" which describes how an aging, ill, and washed-up professional wrestler must pursue his passion for his sport even at the cost of his life.  A consuming and ultimately killing passion, the films suggest, is at the heart of both the tawdry world of professional wrestling and the artistic world of ballet.  Vincent Cassel, who portrays the lustful but gifted Thomas in the ""Black Swan"", gives a stellar performance, similar in many ways to his role as the French gangster Jacques Mesrine in ""Public Enemy No. 1"".

4246164,5,B0041KKYEM,"The frilly world of tutus, leotards and plies goes down a dark path in director Darren Aronofsky's twisted psychological thriller Black Swan. One prima ballerina's destructive search for perfection lends to a startling performance of one of ballet's most classic tales.

Oscar nominee Natalie Portman (Brothers, Closer) transforms her body and seemingly her soul into her performance as prima ballerina Nina Sayers who's just been offered the lead role in the new production of ""Swan Lake."" Trouble is, rather than just playing the part of the the white swan, production manager Thomas (played by Vincent Cassel) wants her to take on the roles of both the innocent white swan and the darker, more seductive black swan. Faced with the biggest challenge of her career, Nina goes to drastic measures to outperform not only any performance she's ever done but any performance of those before her and after will do. With an overbearing mother (played by Barbara Hershey) who's also an ex-dancer, Nina feels the pressure from everyone. All of a sudden everyone is a competitor--her mother, the aging former prima ballerina Beth (played by Winona Ryder), and the other company dancers particularly Lily (played by Mila Kunis), who Nina is convinced is trying to sabotage her. All the while the show must go on.

Aronofsky brilliantly gives audiences a peak into Nina's madness with disturbing special effects and sharp sequences that cause you to feel for Nina while also fear for her as she spirals out of control. Portman achieves cinematic excellence as the dainty swan who--with the help of seductive allusions--turns into a fearless black swan. Kunis, Hershey, Ryder, and Cassell are fantastic as the various dimensions of Nina's world. Audiences won't know who to trust and what is real in this terrifyingly great film that will grab hold of you until the final act.",1291852800,2,1865,5.091503267973856
