3755524,4,B001PPLJKO,"A very enjoyable film, not the best but certainly not the worst film that's ever been made.  It's what it says on the label a good action adventure film.  I like Casper Van Dien and he was good as the 'hero'.  I was disappointed in that he wasn't a ninja and didn't get to wear the ninja costume or have the 2-toed boots and katana.  The supporting cast were also good and I would definitely recommend it if you want a film where you don't have to worry about a complex plot and just sit and plain enjoy it.  I deducted one star because Casper wasn't a ninja!",1241913600,2,559,4.138888888888889

8334107,3,B001PPLJKO,"I haven't been having a good time with ninja flicks as of late. I was disappointed by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ninja-Assassin/dp/B0035V35P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ninja Assassin</a>, the Hollywood production with a chunky budget and the legendary Sho Kosugi in tow; and I was severely disheartened by the plain old&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ninja/dp/B002XTBE5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ninja</a>, the brainchild of the beloved Isaac Florentine and gen-x king Scott Adkins. In my desperation, I turned to Casper Van Diem, director Bradford May (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Darkman-2/dp/078323046X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Darkman 2</a>) and their collaborative ""Mask of Ninja"" - a made-for-TV production about which I had heard a couple good things. Not to bash hearsay, but I think I should've stuck with my better instincts: nobody who sees the phrases ""Casper Van Diem"" and ""ninja"" together ought to expect greatness.

The story: a centuries-old feud between warring Japanese clans nears its bloody conclusion when a murdered patriarch's daughter (Kristy Wu,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cry-Wolf/dp/B000BTIU4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cry Wolf</a>) is targeted for possession of a valuable microchip. It will be up to her trusted servant (Anthony Wong,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix-Reloaded/dp/B0000AXE8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix Reloaded</a>) and a California cop (Van Diem,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Starship-Troopers/dp/B000OVLBHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Starship Troopers</a>) to protect her and settled the blood war.

It seems stupid to consider it now, but I was willing to give B-movie prince Van Diem a try as a martial arts hero. Who knows, I thought - maybe he'll turn out like a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michael-Dudikoff/dp/B00005N89J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michael Dudikoff</a>-type guy. This may yet have been the case, if his character actually got in on the ninja business, but if you're hoping to see the film's headliner don the black mask and jumpsuit, you'll be as disappointed as I am. Van Diem is presented as an ex-Marine cop, with some knowledge of fighting but no mastery whatsoever of the martial arts, and unlike Dudikoff, he never feels the need to become a ninja himself. Anthony Wong brings a bit more believability to his role, but most of the fighting he gets in on is sword-related. The only credible physical performer here is Ron Yuan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-Tiger/dp/B0009ETCZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White Tiger</a>), but his skill matters very little since the fight scenes are generally poor. I'd talk about the choreography if I could, but I could hardly tell what was going on half of the time thanks to the jerky camerawork and guttery editing. Of the five fights, only one qualifies as acceptable in my book and then only barely. Should've seen in coming...

The concept of ninja in modern times has been the driving point in both this film and the other two movies I mentioned. ""Ninja Assassin"" presented ninja as superhuman fighters whose prowess trumped modern technology, while ""Ninja"" showed the shadows warriors as an evolved breed who utilized hi-tech weapons and devices; ""Mask of the Ninja"" takes the middle ground, with the ninjas outfitting themselves with bulletproof vests and jackets instead of jumpsuits but otherwise utilizing traditional weapons and demonstrating parkour techniques to accomplish their physical feats. It's arguably the least dynamic approach but I think it works fine, and leaves room for plenty of blood and violence, including a couple of graphic throat-slicings. There's also plenty of corny talk of honor and revenge, in authentic Japanese, which saves the film from a lower rating. The storyline's serviceable, but the main hero ends up being less interesting than all of the secondary villains, making it a bit of a drag to follow him around when we'd rather be seeing what those ninjas are up to.

I didn't enjoy ""Mask of the Ninja"" but it's not bad enough to qualify for an outright poor review. Ninja fans might enjoy this straight-faced effort to many an old&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godfrey-Ho/dp/B000ERVKI0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godfrey Ho</a>&nbsp;picture, but as far as I'm concerned, the world is still waiting for its defining ninja picture of these last few decades.

8334108,1,B001PPLJKO,"The Ninja genre is hardly synonymous with quality cinema, and generally should be filed under the heading 'guilty pleasure', a nostalgia trip for thirty year old men fondly remembering the slightly risque movies they watched back in the eighties. Nonetheless, the movies of Sam Firstenberg and Cannon had their moments [Revenge of the Ninja; American Ninja] and, despite being low budget, Firstenberg and his ilk could turn in inventive, trashy, and well shot little exploitation movies, all qualities singularly lacking from this arsebiscuit of a 'movie'.

'Mask of the Ninja' is a movie that has nothing going for it; the script is amateurish [porn writers do a better job of setting up 'linking' scenes that lead from one slice of the action to another]; the 'actors' are so bad that Casper Van Dien comes across as a latter day Orson Welles and Lawrence Olivier, infusing his scenes with gravitas; the lighting is dreadful, even by TV standards; the cinematography is from the 'post-Bourne' school of movie shooting that seems to think that shaking a camera equates with creating tension; the editing is horrible, with a post-production addition of 'film scratches' and warps [a la Seven]. All of this could be forgiven if the fighting was up to snuff, but the choreography is excretable.

The other new low budget Ninja film, 'Ninja', also has bad acting, a nonsense plot, and TV-quality set-design/lighting, but is a thousand times better than this by getting it right where it counts; the fight choreography is simply superb, with some phenomenal 'Transporter'-like set-pieces. Avoid 'Mask of the Ninja' and pick up 'Ninja' instead.",1265155200,3,1639,5.134831460674158
8334109,3,B001PPLJKO,I got this because Robert Gant had a role in it.  There was a lot of killing and violence and my favorite got it in the end too.  I received in on time and excellent condition.  If you like this kind of movie you'll love it.,1260835200,,224,3.8260869565217392
8334110,1,B001PPLJKO,"I love all things Ninja.  From the moment I saw ninjas I wanted to be one.  This movie defiles every aspect of ninja coolness.  The ninjas are not only evil ,but they are morons.  They should have just made this a comedy.  Beverly Hills Ninja gives ninjas more credit, and it had better fight scenes.  I was doing better choreography when I was ten. The acting is so bad it embarrassed me just watching it.  I hope they give ninjas more justice in this fall's Ninja [...] (Looks Awesome!).  Avoid this one at all costs.  Complete waste of time and money.  Weak!",1251331200,,561,4.411764705882353
