8321329,5,B001MIKLS0,When I viewed this DVD in Brazil I was blow away. I don't know a lot of Portuguese but this DVD will be appreciated by anyone who loves music. Djavan is famous throughout Brazil.,1374796800,,178,4.264705882352941
8321330,5,B001MIKLS0,"I am new to the music of Djavan. A friend introduced me to his music. It is absolutely beautiful and genuine. Beautiful Brazilian music and a uniquely talented artist. I guarantee you will enjoy. Beautiful setting and excellent performance. I wish Djavan would come to Los Angeles. Once you hear him, you will never go back!",1328400000,,324,4.803571428571429
8321331,2,B001MIKLS0,"This is a recent, licensed version of Gil's ""Acstico"" album which first appeared in 2001. It's a great show, but whoever mastered this DVD took the original footage and inexplicably transformed it from its full screen format (4:3) into a widescreen format (16:9). Bad decision. The result is that Gilberto Gil and everyone else in the film appear ""squished"" during the entire 100-minute program. Unless you wear special glasses, my suggestion is that you try to locate the original Acstico album if possible.",1098835200,5,508,5.132530120481928
