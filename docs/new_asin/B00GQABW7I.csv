6098395,5,B00GQABW7I,"This is the solution to everyone and anyone who has had any reservations about canning but especially pressure canning. When I started pressure canning it was honestly a bit scary, we have all heard the horror stories, and I wanted to make sure that I was doing everything right. I looked high and low for all the information I could get my hands on about pressure canning and sadly I didn't find a lot, I could hardly find books on it let alone a good dvd!! I moved forward with my pressure canning adventure hesitantly and very cautiously and even though I had my All American pressure canner I still didn't use it very much, I just lacked confidence. So, when this dvd came out I was excited and bought a copy. After watching it I can tell you it really inspired me to use my pressure canner more and gave me the confidence and most importantly, the knowledge to move forward with both caution and yet without fear. So many great recipes and watching the process has helped me so much more than a book could have. Bottom line is if you know anyone who wants to can or has any interest in it buy them this dvd! It's 100% worth it!",1387065600,12,1132,4.31924882629108
6098396,5,B00GQABW7I,"I don't often give five stars to stuff just because I don't think it makes a product look all that credible but, wowzers, this video is awesome!  I was watching while I wrapped Christmas gifts and I almost got caught by the kids with unwrapped items because I kept stopping to watch, fascinated by all the cool stuff she was doing.  I didn't grow up canning and I'm not very detail oriented so I learned a ton even though I've been canning for a few years now.  I'm finally inspired to can stews and stuff; I WANT that tall All-Clad so I can do 14 quart jars at a time.  (The biggest thing that keeps me from canning meats and meals is that my canner just isn't big enough to do a lot of jars - I feed ten people at a time and need to be able to can a lot of product at once.)
Bottom line, the canner in your life needs this video for Christmas!  I plan use it as part of my homeschool curriculum for my DD who is at the perfect age to start learning.",1386979200,8,951,3.9842105263157896
6098397,5,B00GQABW7I,Kendra takes the intimidation and fear out of pressure canning. Her ease and knowledge are transferred to the viewer - I feel much better about the range of my canning ability after watching the DVD. I really enjoyed it!,1386633600,4,220,4.666666666666667
6098398,5,B00GQABW7I,"Whether you a prepper, survivalist, frugal homemaker, hobbyist or someone just interested in preserving your own foods. this is the DVD for you.  Well done and complete.  Definitely a great investment and a must have for everyone interested in canning!!  Great DVD...!!!!!",1386288000,4,272,5.428571428571429
6098399,5,B00GQABW7I,"This DVD is perfect for the novice canner and the seasoned canner alike. I have been canning for a few years, and yet I walked away from viewing this with more than a few new tips. Kendra does a great job of explaining and demonstrating how to safely and properly can in both water bath and pressure canners. I especially loved the pop-ups that were filled with tips and little bits of information. From safety to canning meat to canning applesauce, this DVD has it all in an easy to watch, informative format. I'm excited to have this resource to recommend to others when I am asked for a good canning guide. I love my Ball Blue Book, but this is my next favorite canning resource. Kendra did a great job and I cannot give this DVD enough great praise. Charley Cooke, Cooke's Frontier",1386201600,5,785,4.458333333333333
6098400,5,B00GQABW7I,"This is a great DVD tutorial for the beginner as well as the more seasoned canner.  Although not a novice at canning, I still learned some very valuable tips from Kendra!  Her style and presentation was so welcoming and comfortable...I felt like I was hanging out in the kitchen (or back yard) with a friend.  I highly recommend this DVD!  Thanks for doing this. Best Blessings! Donna Miller of Millers Grain House",1386028800,6,414,4.708333333333333
6098401,5,B00GQABW7I,Wow what an amazing step by step video! I never knew canning could be so easy. This video is very well done and provides the detail to really understand every step of the canning process! Mine played perfectly in my DVD player without a glitch!,1385769600,4,244,4.444444444444445
6098402,5,B00GQABW7I,"Very informative! As a beginner canner I loved watching Kendra make applesauce and jam along with all the other canning recipes. I am really excited to now try canning myself, this video made it seem easy and safe. My favorite part about this video is how she shows how to use a pressure canner - something I have been terrified to try to use. This was a great video with a lot of wonderful instruction and tips. Worth the price.",1385596800,5,429,4.375
6098403,5,B00GQABW7I,"I really enjoyed this DVD. I have been home pressure canning for 5 years and water bath canning for longer, and even as a seasoned home canner, I learned some new things from Kendra that I did not know before. I will now be using vinegar to wipe the rims of jars when canning meats and using only canning salt in my jars to prevent discoloration of food, which is an issue that I've had for years. I have heard for years that you shouldn't can food outdoors, but after watching how it's done in this DVD, I have learned that canning outdoors doesn't have to be 'scary'. I may be trying it next summer!

Kendra starts her DVD with all of the necessary safety precautions, and while she is comfortable using some methods that are not found in the Ball Blue Book, she is careful to direct watchers to start with tried, true and tested recipes for a safer canning experience. I also really appreciate that Kendra includes instructions on using the Tattler reusable lids that I use regularly in addition to the familiar metal lids.

Throughout the DVD, there are popup bubbles with helpful tips which will aid the watcher in understanding key points that will help them successfully can these and other recipes from start to finish. Coupled with Kendra's relaxed way of explaining the process, this DVD 'puts the cookies on the bottom shelf' so to speak so that anyone can get started quickly and simply.

In some places in the beginning of the DVD, there are some issues with the sound not matching with the video (particularly when Kendra is talking, and only for a small segment), but don't allow that to put you off--the DVD is comprehensive, hugely informative, and the substance of the teaching is not at all lost despite this issue.

I will definitely be recommending this DVD to those would like to learn about canning, as well as those who want to take their canning skills to the next level.",1385510400,6,1896,4.584070796460177
6098404,5,B00GQABW7I,"Wow. Just wow! I wasn't sure if this DVD would cover everything I wanted to learn, but it covered that and more! It was SO nice to watch this from home instead of spending money to attend a local class or spending hours perusing the internet looking for canning recipes. After watching it, canning is no longer scary and unknown to me, and I feel like I could jump right in! Now, just to convince my husband that a canner is just what we need:)",1385424000,6,444,4.235294117647059
6098405,5,B00GQABW7I,"I have had this DVD for sometime. I loved Kendra's presentation and thorough explanation of canning at home. My personal highlight was the entire section on canning safety. I have a food service background and am very overly-sensitive to food safety. I really appreciated the importance that she placed on a safe canning process!

If you are looking for a canning video... this is it!",1414972800,17,384,4.907692307692308
6098406,5,B00GQABW7I,"This is a thorough treatment of canning, from water bath to pressure canning. I have been canning a long time, and I feel like I need to offer a counter review to the 1 star review. Safety is well - covered by Kendra, and I can't help wonder if that reviewer somehow missed that section, or is potentially reviewing the incorrect item.",1414972800,2,335,4.419354838709677
6098407,5,B00GQABW7I,This video help me tremendously get started on pressure canning!! Thank you so much.,1412121600,3,84,5.071428571428571
6098408,1,B00GQABW7I,"Unfortunately, I can't agree with many of the other comments posted here.  We  need to be well aware of USDA food safety guidelines and best practices to be used in the kitchen when canning.  Recipes used for canning should only be those tested and approved by the USDA or developed by a reputable source such as Ball.  Here,acidity levels, cooking times, and correct temperatures are checked and rechecked for food safety, preventing exposure to botulism or food poisoning.  It's one thing to can for your family and a completely different thing to can safely for your family.  I am disappointed that Kendra didn't think to stress the importance of food safety and practice these guidelines before producing and releasing a video for novice canners.  While home canning fruits, vegetables and quick meals can be both nutritional and rewarding, following food safety guidelines can mean the difference between life and death to our loved ones. There are so many mistakes in this video, I can not recommend a novice or seasoned home canner to follow Kendra's guidance.  Issues include sanitation practices, lack of accurate head space measurement, cooking times/temperatures, general procedures, lid tightening/checking, etc.
Again, I was quite disappointed with the video.",1409702400,3,1272,5.293532338308458
6098409,5,B00GQABW7I,"Kendra takes the ""scary"" out of pressure canning and shows, step-by-step, how to can many different foods. We are now excited to pressure can (We've been water-bath canning for years, but were too nervous to pressure can - the instruction manual was intimidating!) and are eager to get started! I now want an All-American!",1409097600,4,322,4.981481481481482
6098410,5,B00GQABW7I,"Even experienced gourmet chefs get a little nervous around the common pressure cooker; the horror stories of explosions and injuries are enough to make even the most determined individual forgo using a pressure cooker for preserving their organic produce  until now.  Kendra Lynnes new DVD, At Home Canning: for Beginners and Beyond, will make that fear a thing of the past.

Lynne takes the mystery and menace out of the pressure canner, and canning food in general.  At Home Canning: for Beginners and Beyond is a step-by-step tutorial that contains all the knowledge you need to journey into the food preservation world confidently.  She starts by explaining how canning works, the working parts of both water bath and pressure canners, and the reasons behind each part of the process.  Her instructions are clear, and she demonstrates each step of the canning process with everyday recipes for applesauce, spaghetti sauce, chicken soup, pie fillings, and fruit juices; her method for canning grape juice is one of the simplest and easiest I have seen to date.  Lynne uses All American pressure canners (which is reasonable as they are her sponsor), but her explanation of how pressure canners work can be applied to almost any similar style of pressure canner.

More importantly, Lynne forays into the realm of foods not usually seen as cannable.  With Lynnes methods, meats like pork, chicken and beef now can sit safely preserved on the pantry shelf instead of taking up valuable real estate in the freezer.  That makes a big difference in the bottom line of a household when the power goes out and you lose several hundred dollars in thawed food.

Connecting to the busy parent is something Lynne also understands, so she covers meals in a jar for quick canned meals for the family on the go.  Chile Con Carne in five minutes is entirely possible once you see Lynne do it on the DVD.

Lynne felt there was a need to address the void in food preservation knowledge because of her own disconnect with her familys cooking history; those skills had fallen out of use generations ago.  However, she realized that educating herself on the lost arts of the homesteader would be key to living a more self-sufficient life.  She is a homeschooling mother of four, and enjoys being with her family, gardening, preserving food, milking goats, making cheese and soap, preparing herbal remedies, and wild foraging. Her family's newest adventure is preparing to go off the grid, and Lynne enjoys a quiet country life in the Bible Belt South. She blogs about it all on her website, New Life on a Homestead, where she hopes to inspire and encourage others who are interested in simpler living.

At Home Canning: for Beginners and Beyond works at many levels to bring back the frugal and fun side of food preservation.  Lynnes DVD is a fine addition to any kitchen shelf, and will help you save hundreds of dollars as well as simplify your dining dilemmas, and youll never have to deal with eating that bumper crop of name-your-vegetable before it spoils.",1397520000,6,3044,4.868217054263566
6098411,4,B00GQABW7I,"Canning: something every person who's feet touch the earth should know.

Your husband is a fortunate man to have a virtuous woman watching over his household.
The same studied movement and thought  that you show in this video (probably)

6098412,5,B00GQABW7I,"I have always been slightly (incredibly)-phobic to can. I've always been afraid I would mess up and harm my family. Having no one near me to help me out, I never trusted youtube videos that didn't go into great detail about why and how.

Then I sat down and watched At Home Canning for Beginners and am a convert! Being able to sit at Kendra's 'dining room table' and watch as she cans, listen as she explains the how-to's and why's, gave me all of the confidence to tackle this on my own! Now I can feel better about providing my family with home-canned items we've made or grown from our own garden, and build up our pantry for times of need, whether our own emergencies or those of our neighbors and friends.

Kendra really covers all of the bases with this video:

  How to can with a water bath canner
  How to can with a pressure cooker/canner (and why you cant just use a pressure cooker)
  How to can fruits for sauces & jellies.
  How to can meats and beans.
  How to can vegetables.
  How to raw-pack vs. hot-pack
  How to can on an alternative heat source  she uses a propane camping grill.

The great thing about the video is that its set up like separate canning sessions for each type of canning category. This way, she walks you through all the safety issues so that you get it no matter what part of the video you are watching. If you want to learn to can beans  skip to the bean category, but rest assured, you're not going to be missing any valuable safety or procedure tips because they are repeated for you each step of the way. I don't think Ill ever forget to always check the rims of my jars before use!

Kendra also shows you how to can with both traditional metal lids and the Tattler reusable lids.

I'm so excited to start on my canning journey. And any time I find I need a refresher, I can pop in the DVD, go right to where I need, and review every step of the way. And I know that my canning will be safe and productive!",1388620800,17,1950,4.213513513513513
6098413,5,B00GQABW7I,"This is a very comprehensive canning tutorial. Kendra takes you through water bath canning and moves onto pressure canning without missing a beat. She takes the mystery out of this old fashioned almost lost art of food preservation. Let me just list a few of the highlights.
1. Kendra takes a step by step approach. She makes you feel like she's right there with you in the kitchen.
2. She repeats herself a lot! In a normal video this might be a complaint. But this is a major asset to this video for two reasons. One, you can play any section without having to watch (or re-watch) the whole video. Two, repetition is a great teacher, and since safety is a major component to canning, the repetition is great!
3. Kendra explains how to use regular metal lids and Tattler lids. This is great because the Tattler reusable lids are great money savers but can be tricky to get the hang of.
4. This video goes over the difference between water bath canning and pressure canning in detail.
5. Kendra gives you a variety of recipes to try.
6. There is a whole section on safety and how to keep your food safe.
7. Kendra also talks you through equipment. She goes over what you need and what you dont.
8. Kendra talks you through canning in different environments. She does a demo on a camping stove and she addresses canning on a glass top stove.
9. Not only does Kendra take the mystery out of pressure canning she also takes the mystery out of canning meat. A lot of seasoned canners will tell you they are scared to can meat. Kendra does it easily and shows you how.
10.  There are pop-ups all through the video that repeat important information. Remember what I said about repetition! So you are hearing the information in some places and seeing it in others. A great way to learn!
I would highly recommend this video, especially if you are new to canning, but even if youve been canning for a while, as it never hurts to brush up on techniques every now and again.  I plan to use this video to help me teach my children; its that comprehensive!",1387324800,23,2043,4.430851063829787
6098414,5,B00GQABW7I,"While I have been water bath canning for years, I have hesitated to learn pressure canning for a long time. Even though I know how many nourishing convenience foods I could prepare ahead of time to later serve my family, the horror stories of exploding canners were always in the back of my mind so I made excuses and never learned. Kendra explained things so thoroughly that it removed all of my worries. After watching At Home Canning For Beginners and Beyond, I felt much less intimidated and confident enough that I've now canned in the pressure canner several times and of course nothing bad has happened. I couldn't recommend this DVD enough for anyone interested in taking their knowledge to the next level.",1387238400,13,714,4.766129032258065

8626206,3,B00GQABW7I,"This cd came highly recommended but several things struck me as incorrect per the class I took at via the University of Utah. First she has her hair all over the place - maybe she doesn't shed hair like everyone else I know but to me seeing it swing around was just gross. She also shakes the jars which we were told never to do - if there should happen to be a crack or flaw in the jar it could break and throw hot food all over you causing burns and/or cuts from the glass. I was under the impression you fill the jar and immediately put in the canner but she leaves them sitting around before she puts them in - no mention how she kept them warm. We were also told to NOT boil the water until the jars were in, just keep it at a simmer. Other than those, it's a good video for someone that is interested in learning to can. Just verify all recipes and instructions via the Ball handbook before using. If you can find somewhere to take a class I highly recommend it!",1440720000,,968,4.0732984293193715

8626212,3,B00GQABW7I,This DVD of At Home Canning For Beginners and Beyond. Is a good buy. But I would have to say that the way the lady cooks the food for canning is a little dirty. She talks about being clean while eating out of the pots with the same spoon. I'am super clean when cooking. It just was not the best DVD.But she was very informative about using the All American Presser Canner in how to use it. Now I will not return the DVD by no means because of that. It just could have been a little better. I give it a 70 grade,1419033600,2,510,3.9134615384615383
