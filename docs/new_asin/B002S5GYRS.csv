3978307,5,B002S5GYRS,This detailed account of the last weeks of a doctor's life is a powerful statement about an vastly underused alternative plan for someone dying slowly and painfully. I have purchased four copies for my family and friends and plan to order several more.,1305763200,6,252,4.883720930232558
3978308,5,B002S5GYRS,"This is a 29-minute DVD documentary of the last month of Dr. Michael Miller.
Because he was dying of cancer,
he decided his best pathway towards death was to give up eating and drinking.
This DVD shows the whole process,
including the participation of family, doctors, & hospice workers.
It took Dr. Miller almost two weeks to die after he stopped all liquid intake.
Highly recommended for all who are seriously considering
this wise and compassionate way of drawing life to a close.

8379077,5,B002S5GYRS,"First saw this at a conference of the National Hospice & Palliative Care Organization and HAD to buy it immediately. Have been using it to train new hospice employees ever since, but one day it disappeared; someone had used it and not put it back. So I had to buy it again! Would recommend it to every health care professional and to every family struggling with decisions about artificial feedings and hydration at the end of life.
Clearly shows that forcing feedings &/or hydration are not necessary for a peaceful and comfortable dying process. Sandi H, RN, CHPN, LMSW",1378944000,,571,4.777777777777778
8379078,5,B002S5GYRS,"Unfortunately, to stay legal but to determine your own death the option of refusing food and fluids is the only one available to most of us who don't live in the enlightened states of Oregon, Washington, now Vermont and maybe Montana. And those only if you have six months to live therefore omitting long term chronic illnesses which produce more suffering sometimes than terminal illnesses. In this film a Colorado doctor has the end of his life filmed as he dies slowly from dehydration over a period of 10-14 days (not sure exactly how long it took.) I found this portrayal of this method to demonstrate how horrible it is. This man withered away, became unable to ambulate, was in and out of consciousness, and, at the end, was totally dependent on physical care. Unlike many of us, he had care from his wife and a doctor friend plus a caregiver. It is unseemly if not uncivilized that people who have lived a dignified and productive life should have to die like this.",1369008000,3,973,4.630057803468208
