7315791,3,B010R3ILY6,"Pretty good story, but the character who should have been the more likable just isn't likable at all.  some things just don't make sense, such as the scene in which the people are dragging out dozens of guns when the monsters are coming, but they end up fighting the monsters inside their house without guns.",1505692800,,308,4.6

7315793,3,B010R3ILY6,I was hoping this movie had more depth to it and more back story. As soon as the woman showed up I knew it was down hill from there. It became too predictable.,1504310400,,159,3.8484848484848486
7315794,5,B010R3ILY6,"was impressed with this movie.  a good plot twist in the middle, and a good story line, and decent filming and special effects.  I think this would have made a good big screen production with only a little more budget and promotion.",1503273600,,232,4.5
7315795,3,B010R3ILY6,"Slightly better than your average zombiefest. A little claustrophobic, with the main characters holed up in their houses, snow piled up everywhere outside, and they only leave when scrounging for food. At first. SPOILER ALERT Nice twist with the zombies morphing into completely different creatures, still ravenous and feral, but with completely different characteristics. Great to see a zombie film that doesn't have rotting corpses. There is plenty of gore but for the most part it isn't emphasized, it's just what's necessary to survive. Always a pleasure to watch Matthew Fox. The little girl does a decent job, too. Not perfect but definitely watchable.",1502928000,,658,5.336538461538462

7315801,5,B010R3ILY6,"This movie had my attention from the very beginning. I love Matthew Fox. He's one of my top actors to follow. This was everything I wanted ""I Am Legend"" to be, but where ""I Am Legend"" failed horribly, this movie succeeded. I rented this movie and streamed it, but I'm going to buy a copy now that I've seen it. On it's way to being one of my favorites in the ""undead"" genre.",1493251200,3,374,4.136986301369863

7315806,3,B010R3ILY6,Another Zombie movie but this time it's played out out in some sort of ice age. The movie never explains why. Acting was good but the storyline is similar to other zombie movies. The zombies were not as convincing as other movies. If you like zombie movies you will enjoy this.,1488672000,,277,4.450980392156863

7315808,5,B010R3ILY6,"I am always picking up low budget zombie movies in the hopes that I will find a good one.  Usually they are all just garbage, but this one was truly a gem!

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

It starts out the way zombie movies usually start out, with the zombies rising and they attack people, society falls and our survivors flee to safety.  In this movie we have 3 main characters, Patrick, Jack and Lu.  They have fled to safety and are living in what seems to be an eternal winter.  They are in houses side by side from each other and no one has seen zombies for years.  However one shows up and we find out the zombies have evolved to survive the cold, and they hunt by sound.

***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***

We have some awesome action scenes, some great character growth, the sets look amazing, the overall atmosphere is just perfect, and the zombies look incredible!  I can't think of a single thing I would change about this movie!  It's so refreshing to see a quality zombie movie like this after looking through so many horrible low budget zombie films.  This is the kind of film that any zombie fan would love to have in their personal library, and it has definite re-watch value.  Check it out!",1486944000,,1250,4.609090909090909

7315821,4,B010R3ILY6,"Really liked it.  Most ""living dead"" creatures are comical. These were truly gross and horrifying. Less campy and more evolved although the CGI work was a bit lacking.  Reminiscent of the undead in ""I Am Legend.""  Story line was engaging, a good balance of sentiment, tough guy action without beating that subject in the ground, characters were engaging and just enough gore to portray creature viciousness but not so much as to overwhelm the story. Story was more interesting than the typical dead bodies in torn up clothes and heavy makeup.  This was more a social comment on relationships than the last gazillion zombie apocalypse films. I'm really bored with everybody getting on the zombie bandwagon.  Let's have more stories about the survivors and less attention to the creepy crawlers in bad makeup.",1478995200,2,807,5.037593984962406

Might have been better as a mini series so we could know more of the back story and flesh out the current state of the characters more. Acting was good enough. I really didn't like the creatures.

7315844,2,B010R3ILY6,"Thankfully this movie was free, because I would be completely upset if I had actually paid to see this. Although, it wasn't completely horrible this is simply a movie you watch when there is literally nothing on TV and Netflix is taking too long to load. The movie started out promising but quickly turned cheesy. Extinction was simply background noise while I cooked dinner.",1472083200,,375,4.875
7315845,4,B010R3ILY6,"Liked the flick, pretty decent story line and a new spin on zombies.

Not bad, not for children (obviously).

7315848,4,B010R3ILY6,"In a world ridden with B grade zombie movies, Extinction is a solid B+ or A-. It's not World War Z, 28 days later, or Dawn of the Dead. However, it's an interesting twist on a (now) worn out story. Minus one star because it takes forever to draw out the story between Matthew Fox and Jeffery Donovan. However, it is much better than the majority of recent zombie movies to come out. If you're looking for a good zombie movie, Extinction is worth checking out.",1471392000,,459,4.348837209302325

7315854,5,B010R3ILY6,"To me this is one of the best zombie movies out there. It isn't just your brain dead (excuse the pun) story, it actually takes a real in-depth look at the characters, it actually has a plot and it's quite frightening at times. I've noticed some people did not like it, but for me, if the movie doesn't have a plot it isn't worth watching. This movie is well acted and well-written and it answers one of the questions I've always had about zombie movies what would happen in a Subzero climate.",1469318400,,492,4.358695652173913

7315865,4,B010R3ILY6,It's a fairly decent zombie movie. Pretty low on action after the start but there was pretty high tension throughout the movie. Pretty good character development. The biggest plot hole for me was the character Jack being as angry with Patrick as he was even after the world fell apart. He needed to get the hell over it already. And the reason he was angry wasn't even that great when you consider the circumstances.,1466380800,2,416,4.635135135135135
7315866,3,B010R3ILY6,"Yes, this movie has zombies, but it is more about healing and seeking redemption.  Is it better to stay safe and alone, or have a life, even if it puts you in more danger?  Three stars!",1465689600,,185,4.111111111111111
7315867,2,B010R3ILY6,The storyline made no sense. I couldn't relate to (spoiler!) a non relative just taking a child from someone. Just a bad story. More about the family drama then about the zombies/vampires or whatever they were.,1465689600,,210,4.861111111111111

7315885,2,B010R3ILY6,"There are moments when this movie was actually good.  However, the overall production quality was so flawed that I can't recommend it.  The acting was actually pretty good considering the other issues.  There may be spoilers but I can't really describe the problems without revealing some of the story.  Okay, to me the absolute biggest problem with this movie was that some of the main sets for the movie were so horribly made and designed.  The houses in the neighborhood are not even laid out like a real town.  The two houses are just strange.  The idea that you could keep out zombies that move like they do in this movie with cheap fencing is sort of laughable.  These are not like the zombies in the Walking Dead.  They move more like wild animals.  Fast and furious.  The zombies are actually pretty well designed and the special effects are pretty good.  The other issue with the movie is the way the portray snow.  Okay, first of all the person that designed the snow covered set must have never been in a snowy environment in their life.  It looked like a joke.  The key sets are so bad they make it impossible to believe you are seeing anything but a stage or set.  You rarely feel like this is real life.  It's so beyond fake looking.  With production values going up and up.  This movie just really falls short.  Some of the minor sets that you see for just a few minutes or less are better for some reason.  The thing is that filming a snowy neighborhood should not have cost a lot of money.  Go to a snowy city during the winter and film the movie there, outside of town in the country.  The story sometimes makes no sense as well.  Honestly, I only made it about 1 hour into this movie.  I will edit this review, if I finish.  I think horrible, unrealistic sets make it hard to get into a movie.",1463356800,2,1812,4.366366366366367

7315906,3,B010R3ILY6,"This review is for the standard DVD format of 'Extinction.' No real need to review the print quality of the DVD as 'Extinction' is a newer movie.

This is an average 'end of the world' movie.' In this one the world is done in by some sort of infection.

The movie stars Matthew Fox of 'Lost' fame (Jack). Though in this movie his friend's name is Jack (Jeffrey Donavan)! Fox's character is named Patrick.
The world has gone the way of a 'Zombie Apocalypse' and Jack and Patrick are neighbors somewhere in the frozen north. I'm not sure if the world has gone cold or they are deliberately way up north. Although they are neighbors, they never speak to each other. They apparently never got over a dispute over the mother of Jack's daughter. So even though they have no companionship they refuse to get over it. Many years have passed and a new threat develops. The zombies have evolved but they no longer infect humans. Jack and Patrick must get over their hatred for each other and try to survive the latest rounds of Zombie attacks.

You get a lot of standard stuff for these types of movies. You get a typical scene where the hero gets caught out in the open when he is shopping in town. You also get a few similarities to '28 Days Later,' an obvious inspiration for this movie.

Recommended for Zombie Apocalypse fans",1461628800,5,1320,4.4875
7315907,2,B010R3ILY6,"Watched this on Comcast on demand.

There was so much potential here!!!! The previews were so much better than the film.

This film is based on a book. I will have to get my hands on it & see if it is as disappointing.

I absolutely despised the adopted 'dad' character. Honestly, I don't know if he had any redeeming qualities in the book, but he certainly didn't in the film.

Not sure if budget was an issue. Didn't appear to be. But, surely there is some good reason this film seems so flat & incomplete.",1461542400,,508,4.260416666666667

After the attack the movie fast forwards to years later where they are living in the country outside of a town where they get their supplies to live on.  They haven't seen any zombies or other humans in years so they think they're the last remaining people and the zombies have all died but of course things don't work out that way.

7315933,2,B010R3ILY6,"This movie had potential to be awesome, but it fell short. It was more of a drama then a horror movie, although it did have some truly creepy parts. It centers around a young girl, her dad, and their neighbor, surviving 9 years after the zombie apocalypse. There is some mystery as to why the dad hates the neighbor, and that's what the whole drama is about. Without giving too much away I'll just say the reason is predictable and anticlimactic. There are moments of ""no don't do that! Duh!"" and some questionable acting. The zombies are naked and only navigate by sound,  supposedly ""evolved"" to survive in the never explained ""ice age"" that is happening on earth. in one scene you can see one zombie wearing something around its private parts like a diaper but it's trying to blend in so your not supposed to see it, ruining the effect. The movie is somewhat  entertaining, I'll give it that much, but definitely not even in the top 100 zombie movies of all time.",1459209600,4,966,4.545977011494253

7315948,4,B010R3ILY6,"This film opens with an intense, terrifying ""infected/zombie"" opening right out of a 28-days Later kind of movie but then jumps nine years later and becomes a character driven drama until its final third. This is what splits audiences about the film. Mention zombies or infected and many people want wall to wall action. That's OK, but I'm just warning that audience that they won't find that here. As the trailer and the box explain, the cold killed off the ""zombies"" though later on we will find that they evolved/mutated into something even worse, something that can stand the cold.

The semi-arctic landscape in which the characters live is very atmospheric and easily gives a more trapped and isolated feeling to everything, but is never really properly explained. This can be another audience splitter. Some people just accept a premise and others want an explanation. It's the difference between fantasy and science fiction I guess. Though infected films usually rely on a chemical or biological weapon or virus premise, here we never learn anything. Same for the Ice Age conditions. A nuclear scenario would be likely except that nobody is worried about fallout or contamination. You just have to accept it.

Being a small budget film (I hate to say low budget because that infers bad production values and acting that aren't the case here) the movie centers on three survivors, two adult men and a young girl living in two side by side farmhouses out in the country. the two men don't speak and are even hostile to each other, though both like the girl and she likes both. This underlying mystery underscores most of the character drama and sets things up for the action to come when they will be forced to work together to survive. Keeping the characters few and the setting simple is how you can make a good film with a small budget and you just can't expect ruined cities and lots of people.

Matthew Fox (Lost) is very good as Patrick and the other two principals do well enough. The CGI effects are realistic enough and the evolved creatures are especially scary-looking and well designed. The action in the later part of the film is rewarding after the long and slow-paced build up. I won't say there aren't a few cliches of the genre, but overall the film is worth a look. The title seems a bit misleading. I guess it refers to the zombies who they thought were extinct or to the fact that since the three characters don't know of any others, the ""event"" that brought everything on was a type of extinction event for humanity.",1457481600,2,2542,4.7207207207207205

I'd say the biggest problem with the film is the relationship (complete with a lot of flashbacks) between the two main characters was too much of a distraction.

The ending was a bit disappointing but not a huge let down.  I really enjoyed seeing Matthew Fox play his role in this movie.  I can't say I would purchase this movie or pay to rent it again however I probably would watch it again if it were on regular tv.,1453939200,,422,4.172839506172839

7316031,4,B010R3ILY6,"I don't know what to think about Extinction.  I sort of wanted a typical horror with zombies pursuing and biting people and being all enjoyably blood lusty, but instead Extinction goes another route.  Perhaps this is for the better so as to avoid clichs (and let's be honest the zombie film genre is *incredibly* clichd).

While the first 10 minutes might make one think Extinction is going to be filled with tons of biting action and aggressive zombies around every corner when we see a group of people on a bus waiting impatiently for the outside chaos to go away so they can be free only for a few REALLY powerful zombies to climb aboard the bus and eat everyone's flesh, the story *dramatically* goes in a different direction after this scene.

Now we seeing Quinn McColgan, the adorable little girl and her father (Jeffrey Donovan) trapped inside a house in the middle of winter in some small neighborhood, where they permanently live to avoid any potential exposure to the zombie virus outside.  Food, water and supplies doesn't seem to be a problem however.

Their neighbor (Matthew Fox) who was once a DJ and has all the equipment in his house, is also secluding himself away from the world because of the same fear.  And you know, they have a right to be fearful- these are not ordinary zombies out there.  These ones are stronger, faster and blood-thirstier than your typical zombies.  For a while we wonder why Matthew isn't welcomed anywhere near Jeffrey and his daughters house without Jeffrey suddenly exploding violently.  We get our answer later... at least I *think* we do.  I can't remember the specifics.  Actually I can but it's too much of a spoiler to mention in this review.

You're either going to love the slow-paced nature of Extinction with its emphasis on atmosphere and storytelling (and measly three characters), or you're going to prefer a more action zombie film.  Me, at first I wanted an action movie but later changed my mind when I realized the slow pace is a benefit because it's a different way of telling a zombie movie.  Now this doesn't automatically mean the movie's flawless however.  Quinn's a little too overconfident for her own good and gets kind of annoying (though I understand her frustration being kept inside all the time, especially during special occasions).  Her own life has been indoors.  Quinn's acting is questionable because of her obviously fake and smug attitude, but it's not enough to distract a pretty good suspense.

Expect a lot of slow storyline portions to dominate the middle of the movie with emphasis on Quinn's character.  The movie improves as soon as Jeffrey and Matthew *spoilers* finally come to terms.  I think they could've played more with Matthew hearing people speaking in his radio set.  It would have been nice if a bunch of people were introduced into the storyline this way but I'm probably thinking too much into it.  The zombie appearances are few and far between which adds to the horror.  Still a pleasant movie and highly recommended.",1451779200,,3025,4.817829457364341

7316047,1,B010R3ILY6,"Let's get something very straight.  Jeffery Donovan is Michael Westen.  Period.  He does that roll so well it's unbelievable.  Any other acting other than badass characters is horrible acting.  He did great in Blair Witch 2 which was 6 years before Burn Notice.  He was doing Westen before Westen  was even invented.  In this film not only is the screenplay bad but also the zombies in Fruit of the Loom painted underwear plus a mix of melodrama and action.  This movie lacked the dead serious undertones of most zombie movies.  The movie directors really didn't think about the part of Donovan before they decided to use him on it.  Is the character scared of danger because of something in his past?  Heck, we won't know because they never let us know.  He seems to not want to shoot stuff because... well, we'll never know because they never let us in on it.  The corniest part of the movie is towards the end when the find out what the zombies don't like and it's really so horrible that I found myself shaking my head for a full minute in disbelief that Donovan would stoop to such a level to act in this garbage.  The cinematography was great.  The music was the same 1 minute loop over and over and over again.  This would've been much better as a straight-forward, in-your-face, spray-n-pray zombie movie... but, no, they just had to try and re-invent the wheel and turn something good into melodramatic crap that makes you wish you'd not rented or bought this halfway thru.  Hopefully Donovan will understand that his true purpose in life is action, anti-hero movies where he is the main character that saves all of his ""clients"" who come to him.  Please, please, Mr. Donovan... no more rolls of being a cop or troubled do-gooder trying to save the world.  It doesn't fit and never will.  You can't wash off the Michael Weston that's in your blood.",1446422400,,1857,4.600609756097561

7316056,4,B010R3ILY6,"It sounded like an interesting twist on the zombie genre, taking place nine years after an apocalypse. I didn't really expect much, because most zombie-type movies today are poorly written, miserably acted, and horribly produced retreds of the same thing. This one was different and full of surprises. First surprise was two actors of substance: Matthew Fox & Jeffrey Donovan. Next was the storyline, which was very unique and not what I expected: I was on edge.

It did have some negatives though which took me out of the story, such as the poor sound--I had to crank up the volume several times to hear what the heck they were saying; or the mysterious storyline of the two men's hatred for each other--this question often pulled me away from the story too; and there was a choppy feeling to a few of the storyline's characters which never fully developed. Finally, there was no indication of why the later creatures were as they were only nine years later; yet they were pretty damn cool.

This movie was based on a novel of the same name, and I'd like to have bought and read it. But it's only available in Spanish.

Overall, if you like post-apocalyptic films, this one is worth your time.",1444867200,,1194,4.649289099526066
7316057,4,B010R3ILY6,"Where to begin?.. Um just to start off, I had some doubt about this movie. But I read some of the other user reviews and thought I'd give it a shot. I'm a huge fan of the genre, and unless its just totally a cheeseball looking, less than B-movie film I'll usually give it a look-see. And I'll say that I'm glad I spent the time to watch this film. I feel that it's pretty immersive and in-depth with some of the characters background, but more so with the feeling and emotion you get from each role as the movie progresses. I rather enjoyed the darker, dramatic ambience of the setting. Normally I'm not a fan of the fast movers, if you will, but after reading the plot and watching the trailer i kind of got turned on to the premise of the story. There are some pretty tense moments, not over the top with the jump scares and cliches. And at one point you even want to cheer on the protagonists like ""Hell yeah, they're kicking ass now! Things are starting to..."" then it's more disparity and misfortune. Regardless,  it was an interesting take on the genre. I'm giving it 4 stars because I thought it was a great film, with good acting and CGI. Also because it bares a darker, more morose feeling that still leaves a light at the end of the tunnel.  And unfortunately its films like these that get overlooked and set aside like a cheap imitation toy knock-off of the namebrand  (the namebrand being whatever cashcow the mainstream movie goers will throw money at) because it didn't have some flashy title and well renown actors such as WWZ. Which was a rip off of the NY times best selling novel and the movie was a  polished turd at best. But that's a different avenue.

7316060,3,B010R3ILY6,"""Extinction"" started out very strong and so was the latter part of this film in the middle of the movie, I felt that the writer should have stuck to survival and zombies in stead of boring me with two men fighting over one women who died during the zombie apocalypse( I simply grew bored). I like the fact that they added the little girl in the movie she was great but the men fighting was out of place in this movie. Towards the end it started to pick up again STRONGLY the audience should've had action pack through out the film like the beginning and end.  I hope the third movie they make will be one action, action, and more action until the end just a little slow pace but not half of the movie please.  Other then that pretty decent!

This kind of reminds me of the first movie ""Extinction"" it picked up during the beginning and started to slow down tremendously, and fail to deliver a strong ending in the closing of the movie. Again this was better than the first one but still needs some improvements.

Eventually we get to the spoiler on the DVD cover when evolved zombies attack. Not only do we never find out caused the event, the film is a little fuzzy on the event with Emma (Valeria Vereau) the dead wife and the apparent episode that lead to 9 years of separation of the two friends.

7316077,3,B010R3ILY6,"Call it 2 1/2 stars.  If I was searching for a quick description of Extinction I would call it 28 Days Later meets 30 Days of Night although unfortunately it is not on a par with either of those films.  Extinction stars Matthew Fox (Lost) and Jeffrey Donovan (Burn Notice, Fargo) co-star in this zombie apocalypse that is too short on action and too long on family drama.extinction

We are thrust into the middle of a zombie infestation with two men, Patrick (Fox) and Jack (Donovan) and a woman named Emma and her infant.  The infection is similar to that of the type seen in 28 Days later where the victims turn almost immediately into blood-enraged monsters.  Their bus is attacked by infected leaving them to fight their way to safety.  In the process, Emma is bitten, dooming her.  Cut ahead some 9 years and the two men are living in the perpetually snow-covered town of Harmony where it seems the zombies have finally died out.  The baby Lu is now a child and living with Jack.  Despite the fact that Patrick lives right next door the two men no longer have a relationship.

Much of the early and middle part of the film explores the strange dichotomy between the two men.  While Jack lives as normal an existence as possible and raising Lu.  Meanwhile Patrick broadcasts a nightly radio show every night tono one.  Spinning records and rambling incoherently as the isolation begins to take its toll on his sanity.  The two men do not speak and, in fact, Jack becomes agitated when he sees Patrick talking to Lu.

While off scavenging supplies in a neighboring town, Patrick encounters the first zombie hes seen in years although this one is different.  The zombies have evolved over the years to adapt to the colder, snowy climate with thicker skin but are now blind and hunt by sound and smell.  Their bite also no longer infects victims.  Soon the single zombie turns into dozens as they descend upon Harmony to attack the survivors.

Extinction had an interesting premise but it was fumbled badly by Director Miguel ngel Vivas.  The film checks in just short of two hours and is easily twenty minutes too long.  The reason for the tension between Jack and Patrick takes far too long to resolve and frankly is not that interesting.  The world has undergone a cataclysm and these two guys are giving each other the silent treatment yet still living next to each other in town.  The middle part of the film drags interminably.  I found myself playing with my phone, waiting for anything to happen. Nine years hardly seems to be enough time for zombies to have evolved to their new climate.  Since these are adult zombies they would have been around before the outbreak.  There seems little reason for their bite to lose their infection spreading ability.

Vivas attempts to salvage the film in the final 20 minutes by staging an all-out assault on Patricks house by scores of zombies and if you haven't already lost interest the final part is at least bordering on exciting.  In the final analysis, however, theres too much drama and not enough zombies to raise this above mundane.

7316078,3,B010R3ILY6,"I was not aware of this movie until I saw it at redbox. This movie features that guy from the tv show LOST, the ""Jack"" character. The zombies were pretty great even if they were created via CGI. This is another one of those zombie drama movies that focuses on people living with the problem of zombies in their midst. In this movie the Lost actor had had an affair with his neighbor's wife. So his neighbor is raising his child. To compound the problem of infidelity the unfaithful wife is killed by a zombie and it's the Lost guy's fault. So the two men live across from each other and a young girl is raised by the man she thinks is her father. So this is the movie in a nutshell. The movie doesn't really go anywhere. I think it's a good movie to watch maybe once and maybe again after you have forgotten that it is a bit disappointing. And the final scenes of the movie are really cheesy as another reviewer noted. In one scene the guy is going on about the woman's pregnancy. And in the final scene we see the sun high in the sky. It's just more zombie DRAMA. It's scary but overall you feel the dumbness of it all. The actor from the LOST tv series is just about as stupid in this movie as he was in LOST. And the cuckolded husband has kind of lost himself. He is just trying to keep his ""daughter"" alive and that means staying shut in that house. So one neighbor is going crazy with no one to talk to. The other neighbor is going crazy because he hates his neighbor and he is crippled emotionally by his wife's betrayal and also his that of his neighbor. He is living a lie. Both men are pretty unhappy. All of this is just zombie DRAMA, which is kind of new and OK but it's like watching an episode of The Walking Dead. This story doesn't hold up all that well as a major motion picture. This is NOT ""I AM LEGEND"", not by far, and the CGI zombies do look familiar in the two movies.",1441843200,2,1890,4.138586956521739

7316083,5,B010R3ILY6,"I'd been hearing a lot about this Zom-Poc movie, some not so good others good possible because the first released trailer didn't show much. But I was curious so I bought it. I was actually surprised as to how good this movie was. It starts off fast(possible spoilers) with civilians being transported to safety but as is expected they don't reach it but there are survivors. 2 men, one infant and a woman. Skip  9 years ahead and while the two men are now still living in their own as is the child there is something terribly wrong between them and we will witness it  in flash backs.  They are however isolated not only from the world but  each other but their life continues as it appears that all the infected are dead due to the cold. But so it seems are all the people. Of course the danger returns amid an attempted reunion in the form of creatures unlike anything they've ever seen before. The infected have returned but with a difference. Suffice it to say the story line, while it is apocalyptic and has infected/mutant creatures it is more about the dynamic between the two men, the woman they both loved and the child that survived.  It is intense, it is sad and it is maddening and uplifting but mostly it is about humanity and the struggle to maintain it while all appears lost. The little girl, Lu,  is an excellent actress portraying all the innocence of a child growing up without peers slowly beginning the transition from child to pre-teen. It does not have the continual gore of zombie movies because it ceased to be a zombie movie 10 minutes after it began. But the monsters do not disappoint, they are scary beyond anything seen across the apocalyptic/zombie/horror/ creature features. Mathew Fox was brilliant as was Jefferey Donovan, Clara Lago comes in late but is also great for her short stint and of course Quinn(Lu) keeps up with the adults and in many ways surpasses them. Do not pass this one up, see it for yourself and make up your own mind. I believe one reviewer called it ""the thinking man's zombie movie"". He was right",1441670400,5,2054,4.5528455284552845

7316093,5,B010R3ILY6,"Just picked this up at a local big box store (much cheaper there when compared currently on Amazon) and really enjoyed this.  I love reading stories about apocalyptic situations, survival tales, and when you mix zombies in it becomes all the much better.  I've always enjoyed zombie films but the disappointing thing here lately is that there are so many that are just so poorly done and stupid that I can't even watch 10 minutes of them.  The acting is usually horrible, the soundtrack is awful, and they just reek too much of low budget.  Not that all low budget movies are bad...just the zombie ones!

This film didn't disappoint me thankfully.  It was hard enough to track down the DVD at my local store and I kept my fingers crossed that the movie trailer that inspired me to go out and get it wouldn't prove me wrong.  I would say that this is money well spent and it is worthy to sit on the shelf with my other favorite zombie films.  As we have seen with other films of this genre, it is so much easier to create a stupid or comic zombie film rather than something that is actually believable and realistic.  This film does offer the best plausible story for an apocalyptic zombie film that I have seen in a while.  Without giving spoilers, the basic premise is that of a traditional zombie film...outbreak...they bite you and more turn into zombies...end of society etc.  The unique thing is that over time the zombies have seemed to disappeared and something like a mini ice age has taken place.  The survivors seem to think that the zombies have frozen and died out.  They soon discover that not all the zombies are gone.  Some have mutated and have adapted to their environment.  The interesting thing about this film is that it isn't just about trying to survive the zombies...there are some pretty dynamic relationships between the major characters that fuels additional complexities to the plot.  The audience is given clues about the backstory of the characters through various conversations and flashbacks.  I really liked this about the film because it added more realism and believability to the whole situation.  The characters were not only suffering from the incredible trauma of a zombie apocalypse...but also dealing with the inner demons of mistakes, loved ones lost, and loneliness.  One of the lines that I liked in the movie is when a character states that they are so focused on surviving that they are no longer living.

Zombies and effects are nice.  The zombies also have some interesting mutated abilities.  These new abilities seem to have come at a cost however because while they gain new skills, they lose others.  This also was cool because we are not dealing with super powered zombies here.  The effects don't look cheap and the filming/acting are also well done.  Matthew Fox and Jeffrey Donovan do a great job in these roles.  Quinn McColgan also does a great job playing the little girl who was essentially born into a world of zombies.  Clara Lago makes an appearance later in the movie as well.

I could only find a DVD of the movie and I am not sure if a Blu-Ray version is out there.  The DVD version has a total run time of 113 minutes.  There are also plenty of special features here to.  There is a 13 minute ""making of"" feature and 7 other behind the scenes videos with everything from special effects to interviews with the actors.

I'd have to say that I really enjoyed this one.  I've read a lot of novels in this genre and I have also seen plenty of zombie films.  I can really appreciate this one because it isn't silly and so campy that you just can't bear to watch it.  It's a story that makes every effort to give you a sense of realism amongst the crazy idea of a zombie outbreak and for that I can highly recommend.",1441152000,3,3776,4.585074626865672

7316098,5,B010R3ILY6,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

It seems that the horror genre changes from time to time, bringing various boogeymen to the forefront and then changing that to a different one for a while. Remember when THE EXORCIST came out and suddenly there was a ton of exorcism movies on screens? With TWILIGHT came tons of vampire movies. And now we have zombies. The success of THE WALKING DEAD has led to numerous zombie movies and while most are terrible there are the exceptions. One I write about on the blog called WYRMWOOD which is a gore filled zombie fest fans will like. And this week we get something new and fresh to the genre, EXTINCTION.

The movie opens with a busload of people being shuttled to an Army base. The bus stops and before you know can say flesh eaters it is besieged by zombies. Friends Jack (Jeffrey Donovan of BURNT NOTICE) and Patrick (Matthew Fox of LOST) fight off these zombies as others are crushed. Along with Emma and baby Lu they hide out but not before Emma is bitten.

Fast forward to nine years later. The world is a frozen wasteland. Were not told if this is constant or if this is just winter, but it seems to be as desolate as it can get. Patrick is out scavenging for food and ammunition. He gets back to his home, a building surrounded by chain link fence and next door to Jack and the now 9 year old Lu (Quinn McColgan). The two homes are separated by the fence that also surrounds both. But it is the fences built by the people in these homes that becomes the focus of the story.

Sometime in the past, something happened that tore the two friends apart. Something so terrible that while Jack stays in his home barely scraping by with enough for him and Lu to eat, he continues to try and stay alive and well teaching Lu things like reading and writing. Patrick on the other hand has deteriorated. Long hair, unshaved and filthy he drinks most of the time when not foraging for food. His only companion is a dog he shares his home with. He spends his nights on the short wave radio trying to locate other survivors, all of this airing over speakers hes rigged to his fence. Even though the fences are there, the fear of zombies is gone, all of them thought to have died out.

One day while scavenging in a warehouse in a nearby city, Patrick finds a fresh, half-eaten carcass of an animal in the store. Following the blood trail he finds a zombie but not like the old days. Theyve adapted to the cold. Nearly blind they rely on their supersensitive earholes to find their prey. As this one goes after Patrick he tears out of the building, locking it in. Heading home on his snowmobile hes followed by the escaped zombie. Nearing home he fires off his gun, trying to alert Jack. When the zombie knocks him off the snowmobile, Jack hesitates shooting it. Patrick survives but at a cost.

Now with the knowledge that the zombies have adapted the two houses must unite if they are to survive. They must find a way to get over whatever it was that happened in the past. The secrets from those days unknown to us, the viewers, will eventually be revealed. The possibility of other survivors is always considered. And the last hope for a future rest in the combined efforts of two men who have grown apart over the years and a little girl who wants nothing more than for them to unite and find others.

What makes this movie good is the same thing that makes THE WALKING DEAD good. That is while the story is framed in the world of zombies it isn't about the zombies that is the center story involved. It is the story of humanity, what people do in the face of adversity to survive. Its the story of two people who were once close as brothers but have drifted drastically apart. It is the story of a small girl raised in a world without others to play with, with no one but her father there to be by her side, who wants to feel safe and find a world like shes heard of. What makes this and that series so special is that it focuses not on the killing creatures but on the human beings and what it takes to remain human under these conditions.

Both Donovan and Fox have proven they are extremely good actors. To carry off a series for more than a year speaks volumes. Both turn in fine performances here that make you long to find out what happened in the past. McColgan is the surprise here, a new young actress who carries off her role with apparent ease making the character believable and one that we care about. We root for her to find a better world than the one she lives in now.

If this movie played in theaters it was a limited run at best. It falls into that category of movies known as straight to DVD but in the select group of movies there that deserve more attention than they received to date. For horror fans youll find a new fun movie that youll want to add to your collection. For THE WALKING DEAD fans youll find a movie that will tide you over until the new season starts. And for everyone else youll find a movie that shows the best of what humans can be in the face of a world gone to seed. Definitely worth a watch.",1441065600,,5094,4.3145245559038665

7316102,3,B010R3ILY6,"Extinction takes place nine years after a zombie apocalypse. Feuding survivors Patrick (Matthew Fox) and Jack (Jeffrey Donovan) have taken refuge in the snowbound town of Harmony along with Jacks 9-year-old daughter Lu (Quinn McColgan). The monsters have seemingly disappeared with no sign of other survivors, but the constant fear of the unknown is beginning to take a toll on this trio. When Patrick goes scavenging for food, he discovers the undead have returned and evolved into something terrifying and beyond imagination.

Zombie movies are as plentiful today as slasher films were back in the 1980s. Extinction foregoes the almost requisite scenes of plague outbreak and character intros, plunking the viewer right into the midst of a caravan of two buses filled with survivors desperate to reach the perceived safety of a military base. But the hopeful survivors are besieged by zombies who tear their way through the passengers, many of the attacked soon rising and searching for victims of their own.

The movie resembles in structure both I Am Legend and 28 Days Later, but still contains some memorable sequences and gruesome images, mostly in the early part of the film. When the picture begins to explore the dynamics among the three protagonists, however, it loses considerable steam and becomes overly talky. Zombie films are at their best when the zombies are on screen. Production design reflects budget restraints with many scenes clearly filmed on sound stages rather than actual locations. The zombies themselves are blind albinos, a nice variation of the traditional depiction. Extinction avoids many zombie flick cliches and contains some thoughtfully crafted suspense. In that bus sequence, for example, theres an escalating sense of dread and tension as the camera shows the faces of the various passengers. When the attack does occur, its all the more horrifying because of the lead-up to it.

The only bonus extra on the DVD release is a behind-the-scenes making-of featurette.",1440892800,3,2004,5.25625

I like that they didn't over explain the backstory of what had occurred between the two characters, it wasn't necessary, and I liked that it didn't try to go overboard on the science aspect of the creatures. The isolation was like a character unto itself. The little girl in this film was a brilliant actress, she felt so real! The acting was great in general. I love Jeffrey Donovan and would pretty much pay to watch him organize his sock drawer, and while I miss Burn Notice and particularly Michael Weston doing a crazy undercover character, Donovan's character had a very understated personality in this, reflective of his fear and focus on survival for him and the child, he was vulnerable and intense, yet another sign that this actor is skilled, he can truly transform himself for any role. Matthew Fox was fabulous as well, and presented a believable picture of a man falling apart and questioning his sanity without going overboard into slapstick. Satisfying, bittersweet ending, good script, great filmwork, suspense, keeps you on the edge of your seat even during...or rather especially during the slow tension and build up of the first half.

7316120,4,B010R3ILY6,"Patrick and Jack and a bunch of other tense, ragged people are on a school bus. Two nervous soldiers stand at the front and back. A mother holds her crying baby. It is obviously some kind of refugee extraction. The bus ahead stops and all hell breaks loose as zombies overrun the bus. Jack and Patrick save the mother and baby, but she's been bit, and they look at each other, and...

Cut.

Now it is 9 years later and Jack (Jeffrey Donovan from Burn Notice) is raising his daughter Lu while Patrick (Matthew Foxe) is in the next house over going insane. Jack really doesn't like Patrick and Patrick is getting obviously delusional. They seem to be the only survivors, living in a bleak, iced-over waste, with pretty nice houses.  Patrick is always on his radio trying to make contact with someone, but always failing, while Jack teaches Lu math and reading.

Post-apocalyptic domesticity.

A large part of the movie is piecing the backstory together about what happened in the interim and why Jack doesn't like Patrick is and what happened to Lu's mom and why Jack is the ""father"" of Lu, although Patrick is really the father.  For a part of the movie I wondered if Patrick was there and the other two weren't, and vice-versa, but that turned out to be a red-herring.

This part of the movie moved slowly, but I kind of liked it.

Then, however, the next-gen zombies show up, and they are more like the monsters from Will Smith's ""I am Legend"" than from The Walking Dead.  These critters are fast, rapidly-healing, blind and vicious.

The last thirty minutes turn into a white-knuckle fight, where zombies are everywhere, and our heroes are running out of ammunition, options and hope.

All in all, it was a decent movie, although I think the long middle part will wear on the patience of most horror/monster flick enthusiasts.",1439596800,16,1828,4.663551401869159

I agree with most of the four star reviews, the movie is more about the relationship of Jack, his daughter and Patrick. The mutant creatures, aka zombies, are scary as crap and the setting is very authentic given that it's a low-budge production. The focus of the relationship of the two neighbors, which dominates the movie, is somewhat slow and could have benefited from a better script. The appearance of the creatures in the first ten minutes of the movie and the last thirty minutes was very intense.
Highly recommend the movie for any fan of the three main actors: Jeffrey Donovan, Matthew fox and the very endearing Quinn McColgan.

Here's a film where some nice thoughtful touches help to anchor and advance the plot; and the acting (while not necessarily stellar in every scene) is fairly solid. When it comes to creatures, the practical effects are actually pretty impressive though the CGI could maybe use some help. Also, the pacing seems to go off the tracks about 2/3 of the way through -- so while the ending offers some nice action, pathos and a tidy wrap-up the movie as a whole kind of comes bumping and skidding across the finish line. I also noticed one possible (?) continuity error concerning the wife's fate. Plus, if you're an animal lover like me be prepared to look the other way, or you'll witness a few upsetting scenes of animal demise. Still, some of the camera work and framing choices are pretty inventive.

7316164,5,B010R3ILY6,"I Loved it! Always on the lookout for a good zombie flick & a loyal fan of TV's The Walking Dead, The Strain & Penny Dreadful, I can now add 'Extinction' to my list of favorite films. The acting is intense, believable ... great! Matthew Fox (I'm a fan of his since he starred in 'Lost') is unrecognizable as the bearded, caveman-looking-type character  who plays Patrick ... and I did NOT recognize him. Around 40 minutes into the film I looked up the cast members & was pleasantly surprised to see the 'Lost' actor who played Jack Shepard now playing Patrick, zombie apocalypse survivor. Later in the film he cleans up by cutting his shoulder length mane & shaving his full beard & ahhh ... resembles the handsome hero from 'Lost' again. The storyline is very interesting, taking place 9 years after the apocalypse wipes out most of humanity, leaving pockets of survivors  hidden away in their homes, going out now & then to forage for food & supplies in neighboring towns. They live with the knowledge that the 'monsters' (what they call zombies in this film) have died off, not being able to survive the freezing, snowy temps but they also live on the edge of their seats, not fully relaxed & confident of that knowledge ... and rightly so. Patrick has a neighbor, played by Jeffrey Donovan, who despises Patrick & avoids contact with him at all costs. He's also overly protective of his 10 year old daughter, Lu, who hears stories of the monsters but doesn't really remember them since she was just a baby when the world, as they knew it, ceased to exist. The production appears to be low-budget & the story is not fast paced. If you can forgive those drawbacks I can say with confidence that you will be rewarded with a captivating storyline and gripping & at times heartwarming performances by the actors (Fox is superb & little Quinn McColgan is precious as Lu). It is the zombies ... the monsters ... you can call them whatever you want ... who stole the show! Resembling the mutant creatures from the film 'I Am Legend', they are horrific looking, fast moving & bent on destroying all living things, including the characters we grow to love in this film ... unless they can get them first!",1438387200,22,2198,4.604591836734694

This post apocalyptic world is a very cold icy wasteland with Fox,Donavan and Donavan's young daughter as the only characters except for flashbacks where Fox's wife is shown and then later in the film they find a woman who shows up out of the blue.

The pace of the film is very slow for the genre because apart from the very beginning set up,there really isn't much action until the last 30 minutes or so and wih a running time of almost 2 hours that's kind of slow. The most awesome aspect of the film has to be the post apocalyptic creatures, they are very disturbing  and very effective,kudos to the makeup team. Think the creatures from the Descent meet the vamps from 30 Days Of Night.

If you've already seen A Quiet Place (which I highly recommend you do, I thought it was great!) you're likely to notice some similarities that will be hard to ignore, but given the timing of the film's release, I doubt that it was a derivative work.
The plot is tad predictable at times, and the ending you can see coming a mile away, but I still found it enjoyable nonetheless. The starkness of the winter setting reminded me of Carpenter's The Thing, which certainly earned this movie some extra points in my book.
