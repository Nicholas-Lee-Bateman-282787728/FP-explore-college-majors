8677484,4,B00ND0DB5U,"This black portrait of the artist Francis Bacon and his rough-trade boyfriend, George Dyer, amounts to nothing more than a bleak look at an excessively immature relationship.  The film never dips below the shallow surface of their tortured lives, its focus almost always shocking and never tender.

Not knowing much about the life or art of Francis Bacon, before viewing the film I read as much about him as I could, having been forewarned that many people find the film as difficult to understand as the twisted relationship between the two people it portrays.  From what I discovered of Bacons life, the film is possibly quite accurate, at least as far as his relationship with Dyer is concerned.  The problem is that real life is often not very pretty, and if a film of such unseemly lives is to succeed, it would help to offer some deeper understanding of the characters it presents, or at least proffer some hint of the artistic output of a man who, if the critics and biographers are correct, was one of the most important artists of the 20th century.  Instead, Love is the Devil never reaches beyond a stark presentation of the cruel, selfish indifference of the lead character (Bacon) and the hopeless frustration of the tragic life of George Dyer.  Bacon as an important artist is never explored at all, which could have served to at least balance the harshness of his more unflattering reality.

For the life of me, I cant figure out why, if their film portrayals are to be believed, so many well-known artists seem to drench themselves in squalor and dysfunction.  In some respects, the story of Bacon and Dyer (as presented in this film) reminded me of the twisted love affair between Joe Orton and Kenneth Halliwell in the drama, Prick Up Your Ears, which starred Gary Oldman and Alfred Molina.  Orton was a hugely successful screenwriter and Bacon a highly successful artist, and according to their respective cinematic renderings, both lived tortured lives of romantic dysfunction, paired with partners who were far beneath their intellect and talent.  But aside from the further coincidence of both stories being set in England in the 1960s, there the similarity ends.  Orton and Halliwell were writers, one supremely talented and the other inept, but at least they were intellectually compatible, if not professional equals.  Bacon and Dyer had nothing in common beyond a self-destructive love of alcohol and a penchant for inflicting pain on each other and others around them, which appears to be the sole point of Love is the Devil.

From the very start, Dyer is clearly in over his head.  His love for Bacon is fed by his awe of a talent that his mind is unable to grasp, and the frustration of having nothing to offer beyond his physical beauty.  Bacon can provide only cruelty and bitchiness.  The relationship is doomed from the beginning, and Bacon is portrayed as an enigmatic combination of physical masochist and intellectual sadist, with nary a hint of his awesome artistic ability.  Although expertly etched by the acting of Derek Jacobi and Daniel Craig, and both actors do provide their share of brilliance, the film suffers from a limited depiction that emphasizes Bacons cruelty and Dyers despair.  If this is an accurate portrayal of their rather sordid love lives, it would have been better for Bacons reputation and Dyers memory to have simply left them alone.  No matter how much Bacon can be defended as a tortured genius, it is Dyer who emerges as the sole sympathetic figure in the piece, drowning his ineffectual stabs at romantic fulfillment in an ever-downward spiral of booze, drugs and rent boys.

Part of the message of this film seems to be, Avoid falling in love with genius.  If a film is to provide such a hopelessly depressing narrative of immaturity, selfishness and alcoholism, it would behoove the films creators to at least balance these images with some of its subjects accomplishments.  What emerges is not a very flattering picture of artistic genius or gay romance, and in the end, I decided if a film can only portray the seedy aspects of a great artists private life, maybe it shouldnt present it at all.  I give it five stars for the well nuanced acting, and minus one for the story and direction.  The Blu Ray Edition does benefit from the addition of subtitles for the hearing impaired; the original DVD (and the Blu Ray Edition) suffer from poor sound quality.",1500076800,,4425,4.838196286472148

8677486,5,B00ND0DB5U,"This movie is about an intellectual and an acclaimed artistic genius, Francis Bacon (played by Derek Jacobi), falling lustfully into a sexual relationship with a handsome but unsophisticated young man (played by Daniel Craig), and how the strength and sincerity of the protagonists' physical attraction to each other is insufficient to sustain their relationship.  Jacobi brilliantly portrays Bacon's evolving conflict between his genuine physical attraction and the intellectual gulf between them.  The physicality of Craig's presence on screen leaves nothing to the imagination about how even a genius could be swept away by that beauty; yet Craig also reveals with sensitivity the young man's initial frustration and eventual despair over his inability to engage Bacon beyond the physical ... and the shallowness of Bacon's ""intellectual"" coterie and the casualness of Bacon's own ""creative"" process, which only the viewer sees, lend a delicate irony to that frustration and despair.
""Love is the Devil"" does not attempt to be a ""great movie"" in any grand sense, nor is it one for every audience.  But for those who will enjoy it, it is a movie that bears repeated viewing.
The remastered Blu-ray version is definitely superior to the earlier one on DVD, which I also have.",1478822400,,1276,5.275862068965517

I am a movie lover, so I enjoy most all genres of movies.  This movie is really on the abstract end of movies, and is very different.  So, if you are looking for an easy to follow, make you feel good, type movie, this is not it.  It is not easy to follow, and definitely not the best of Daniels work.  It's okay, just saying.....
