8080069,2,B000AXFST0,I did not like how the they had the children jumping and playing on the rosary.,1496361600,,79,4.0
8080070,5,B000AXFST0,This is a great video for kids.  We've been watching it for the past 10 years. The kids are engaged and the music is catchy.  We love all the videos in this series.,1452643200,,164,3.9393939393939394
8080071,1,B000AXFST0,"Not what I thought it would be, outdated, did not finish watching.",1446076800,,66,4.583333333333333
8080072,4,B000AXFST0,Cute way for children to learn the rosary prayer. The quality of the video is dated as it was filmed in the 90s but other than that it's still a great way to instill the rosary in kids!,1412035200,2,185,3.8947368421052633
8080073,5,B000AXFST0,"I would recommend this DVD for any parent who is trying to incorporate to rosary into their children's daily prayer life.
Children can find this very understandable; this is a great buy!",1401667200,,186,4.84375
8080074,4,B000AXFST0,"I have twin 2 year olds & they love watching this DVD & singing along. They have both drastically improved in their ability to recite these prayers & we have only had it a few weeks. The dress is a little outdated (which doesn't bother us a bit...the prayers are still the same :) Also the lady leading it can be a bit distracting for adults & teens trying to pray with the children, but her ""over the top"" enthusiasm keeps my children engaged throughout the entire rosary, so it is completely worth me putting forth the extra effort to stay focused.",1389916800,,550,4.401960784313726
8080075,4,B000AXFST0,"We originally got this VHS when our older 3 children were young. It was a great way to keep them interested and focused...and although we needed to help them learn how to follow along with the actually rosary beads, we thought it was a great  way for us to pray as a family. We then went through a period of time with no VHS or DVD player in the house. Now that we have a DVD player, we have once again reintroduced the younger children. Our older children(in their late teens) still love to join along singing the Rosary with us...yes, probably dated in styles/hair, but content, music and overall presentation is still very good. We would recommend it to any young family!!",1299715200,,675,4.487804878048781
8080076,4,B000AXFST0,"Its important to know that although this was released on DVD in 2005, it was originally released on VHS in 1996.  The make-up, hair and dress are dated, the woman that leads the rosary is well covered from the waist up and wearing medium length shorts to my best estimation.  She is very active and energetic at times and leads a group of 4 or 5 children in saying the Rosary.  The children lead the Rosary individually for parts of the Rosary with artwork in the background at times.  There a portion that focuses on praying for the unborn, and the woman that leads the Rosary pauses to bring special attention to this next to a woman with a very pregnant belly!

We had this in VHS for our older children, and I am ordering it in DVD for our younger ones because my now 5 year old, who probably saw this last about 2 years ago, still enjoys singing the Hail Mary as he learned from this video!  The woman has a beautiful voice and I have since seen her sing on EWTN, although she is now 20+ years older and wearing updated fashions. :0)",1210636800,9,1038,4.270408163265306
8080077,3,B000AXFST0,"Wow, I am a new catholic convert and really wanted to like this DVD for my 4 yr old daughter but just can't tell a lie...it's not great.  The adult leader of the rosary exercises is a rather strange woman who dresses inappropriately and wears a lot of make-up.  Why they didn't get a nice Nun to do this I surely don't know.  The method of instruction (if you can even say there is one) is not effective and my child has no idea how to pray the rosary after watching this.  I'm really sorry folks.  To their credit, the sections of the DVD that show classic religious art combined with music is wonderful.",1203552000,13,605,4.271929824561403
