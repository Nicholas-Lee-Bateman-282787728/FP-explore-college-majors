4912965,2,B0060MYMFQ,"Seasons one and two were laugh-out-loud funny, but season three misses.  There are some funny moments, but it's not as sharp as the other seasons.  It did pick up towards the end, though, so I hope season four will capture the magic that was the first two seasons!  I love the cast, including Valerie Bertinelli, who has been a favorite of mine since  her ""One Day at a Time"" days.  And naturally Betty White is a scream!!!  This season was a waste of their talent... so here's hoping for a turn around in season four.",1345075200,2,518,4.4

4912967,5,B0060MYMFQ,This show is great and Valerie Bertinelli is an amazing actress.  Who ever says she isn't doesn't know good acting.  The entire cast is great and the episodes are so funny.

4913117,5,B0060MYMFQ,"I really enjoy ""Hot in Cleveland"" as a sitcom on TV Land and it is going into its final season. This comedy series was still hitting its stride in the third season with guest appearances by John Mahoney, David Spade, Regis Philbin, Cybill Shepherd, Barry Bostwick, Joan Rivers, Georgia Engel, Laura San Giacomo, Sandra Bernhard, Jon Lovitz, Alex Borstein, Sean Hayes, Don Rickles, Roger Bart, and more.

Every episode is filled with rich and witty humor. I always take joy and comfort in watching familiar sitcoms like ""Hot in Cleveland."" I watch sitcoms like ""Hot in Cleveland"" where I can laugh and escape life for a while. I like the characters and enjoy the actresses who play them as well. They appear to have a good time on the set and off the set together.

I loved watching Jane Leeves on ""Frasier;"" Wendie Malick on ""Just Shoot Me;"" and Valerie Bertinelli ""One Day at a Time."" Together these three actresses have almost thirty years of experience and perhaps more. Joy, Melanie, and Victoria Chase who found themselves in Cleveland, Ohio at a turning point in their lives Middle aged women who are under appreciated in Los Angeles, California and find themselves in the Midwest.

I enjoy watching Betty White's Elka. She is 90 years old in this season and just gets better with age. Betty White is an American treasure, institution, and living icon. She is a testament that age is only a number not a state a mind. Betty White needs to be honored with the American National Medal of the Arts and should be a Kennedy Center Honoree.

The DVD set has three discs and includes a special bonus in behind the scenes of an episode.",1432080000,,1634,4.663194444444445

4913483,5,B0060MYMFQ,"""Hot in Cleveland"" remains the flagship of TVLands brilliant new sit-com formula which proves that America doesn't require 26 year old actors and, in fact, thrives on NOT having them.
  The ensemble of these four Women (Bertinelli, Leeves, Malick and White) is magic. The littany of guest stars is jaw sripping, ranging from Huey Lewis and Tim Daly to Carl Reiner and Millicent Martin.
  Wayne Knight may hold the record now for consecutive successful Sit-coms. Seinfeld. 3rd Rock. Hot In Cleveland, The Exes. Knight is quickly gaining on Betty White who has 8 successful sit-coms under her belt. Both actors continue to shine.
  This is never sappy or poignant; Hot In Cleveland is meant to be fun.

4913777,3,B0060MYMFQ,"Four exciting talented and beautiful actresses with a show that appears to be fun for them... but personally I felt not that challenging.  It lacks depth of character.  Perhaps in an attempt to put humor first the writers have left the character development superficial.  The actresses still make it fun.  It is an applaud to their talent that we keep watching although we strongly feel it is an injustice to the depth of talent of these four women.  They could do much more.  Women in mid life and beyond, single, and strong, have more to offer than superficial relationships from which they bounce to and fro.  It is because of the sometimes negative portrayals of women/men, the characters inability to develop deeper relationships at work or personally that we leave feeling like we just won't watch another.  It is the actresses that keep us coming back.  They are so fabulous, how about some intensity, some real traumas, some growth of character, some continuity in the show, it could still be humorous with their approach to overcoming these situations.",1413763200,,1061,4.915730337078652

Re-watching the episodes a second time is just as much fun though. I am off because of a surgery and this show helped me get through the bad parts of recovering. It kept my mind off the pain since laughter conquers all - lol. If you ever liked any of these ladies. you will totally love this show! It is now on my TIVO list.,1402444800,,682,3.9854014598540144

4914739,5,B0060MYMFQ,"This is a wonderful sitcom for the 40 and over viewer.  These girlfriends talk about dating, there are (on occasion) some bedroom scenes.  These scenes may not be too much for young eyes and ears.  This show is as clean as it's going to get on TV.  It has no ""f"" bombs. Melody's version of profanity is ""sugarfoot"" or some variation of the words.

The writers are great.  Each week there is an exciting episode.  I've watched this show from the beginning and the show never disappoints.  It's full of laughter.  Each of the ladies are equals in this show.  That's very refreshing.  Betty White is absolutely delightfully funny.  It's amazing how the writers managed to get the Elga character in so many situations....and she comes up smelling like a rose every time (even in the strangest situations).

It's definitely a chic flick...actually it could be used a s blue print in to the world of dating for the middle aged adult.  You be the judge.

Very funny show.",1395446400,,964,4.621301775147929

Pros:  Great character development, Chemistry between the actors, great guests and amazing writers.

Unlike many sitcoms, there is plot and situational development, so you definitely need to watch in order.  Clearly the cast is having fun--as is the audience--as you will be, too.  If you like any of the four main actresses, you'll love the show.

Adding spice and fun to it all are the cameo appearances by some of the best actors and funny men & women of all time.  We enjoyed seeing Carl Reiner, to name just one.  Jon Lovitz has been given a recurring role and he's just great.  Don't want to mention any others as that would spoil the fun.",1391299200,,670,4.261904761904762

Betty White is a blast, and the rest of the cast holds their own with her. After watching the first episode of season 3, I had the feeling the show had lost some of its charm, but I was quickly informed I was wrong, when I watched episode 2. Now I have finished the entire season three, and tried to get into season 4. I was quickly informed that I would have to pay for each episode. I thing this is a bit underhanded on Amazon's part.

4915328,5,B0060MYMFQ,Betty White is an old timer like myself. I enjoy watching the seniors that still have the spunk to carry a show.

Hot is perfect downtime for me and my family and we look forward to the show every week. When I miss an episode I love having Amazon Prime as my source to choose and watch episodes I may have missed. The cast is amazing and lots of familiarity from seeing them on other shows over the years. Each cast member represents a stage or circumstance in my life that I can identify with and I so enjoy seeing how the characters handle things their way!",1378512000,,458,4.204545454545454
4915570,4,B0060MYMFQ,An enjoyable show with familiar sitcom favorites.  Full of age-related stereotypes; portrays women as denying their aging process by any means necessary.,1378512000,,153,5.954545454545454

4915610,5,B0060MYMFQ,"I'm young and fresh but I don't like tv that is full of so much swearing, deceit, and trash. This sitcom is a throwback...a bit 'Golden Girls' but mixed with the more current girly shows like Desperate Housewives...only lighter, funnier, and something that you feel good about. Ok, I'm in my early thirties with 2 young children....the stars of this show (not to mention the plot of three single women living together with a woman in her 90's) are not necessarily on the top of my 'must see' list...or my lady crush list, hehe. Or at least not until I started watching this show on a whim. It was on Amazon Prime and I thought, why not try it. I LOVE IT!! I think this season is just as good as 1 and 2. I literally LOL with each eppy. It's a nice comedy for people who miss the comedies they grew up on, while still being entertaining, hilarious, and relevant. Enjoy!",1377734400,,868,4.364197530864198

Their timing and delivery of lines is exemplary.  All very accomplished.

They have smart little snippets back and forth, things that can mean several different things.  I've only watched 3 of the episodes, but I found myself laughing out-loud with the antics going on.  I don't know if it was my computer or the episodes, but after 3 shows my computer froze and it had psychedelic colors to it.  I had to completely restart my computer.  But the show was great.  It reminded me of 'Maude' and other shows from back in the day when shows had clean fun that families could watch.

4915990,5,B0060MYMFQ,"Hot in Cleveland is one of the funniest shows on TV.  The 4 ladies who star in this series have just the right timing and the writers for this show give the the best lines.  Of course Betty White's character, Elka Ostrovsky, is outrageous, but Valerie, Jane and Wendy are just perfect in their roles, too.  I've loved each of them from their previous work and it's great to see them together in this series.  I got hooked on this show just a few months ago when I got my Kindle Fire and was trying out the video features...my family can't understand why I'm watching something called ""Hot in Cleveland"" when I should be doing something else....If I have one complaint, it's the name of this show...it doesn't resonate with me and it kept me from even watching it for a long time.

The basic premise of this series is set up in Season 1 in the premier episode...Three friends from LA fly to Paris but their plane makes an emergency stop in Cleveland.  Stuck in this midwest town for a few hours, the ladies head to a local bar only to find dozens of good-looking, hard-working men, and while they are just another skinny girl in LA, they are HOT in Cleveland.  I didn't understand this reference until I saw the premier episode.  Jumping into this series at any other point doesn't do this series justice.  You have to watch the first show to really appreciate the contest.  After that, it's the writing, the timing/delivery of the lines, and the incredible parade of guest appearances by just about every funny man/woman in the last 30 years (and then some...who would have expected to see William Shatner, Shirley Jones, Buck Henry, Carl Reiner, and so many more in the same series?).  I guess you could say I'm a big fan.  Can't wait for the next season.",1372118400,,1756,4.522151898734177

Only a few episodes were laugh out loud funny, the rest were kinda meh. And the constant showing of how the women see their self image and stuff is getting old.

It's a cute show with some of your favorite TV actresses all looking as great (skinny) as they did 20 (30) years ago...  Well, maybe not Betty White, but she looks fantastic and she gets to deliver the best zingers!

I am disappointed that so many of Betty White's lines and her character resemble the Golden Girls ""Sophia"".  The hooker/prostitute jokes got old pretty quickly.

I have watched every episode there is so far and I hope that the writers are able to put more originality into the lines!  I'm a fan of the Golden Girls and own the complete series on DVD, which I have watched hundreds of times and it is a little sad to see reused situations/comments in this series but I still enjoy it.  It seems like in this day and age that the writers wouldn't have to resort to ""fatty"" and ""hooker"" lines so often!

If you're feeling a little blue and need some cheering up, this show is good medicine! Every single episode has us laughing out loud. I'm thankful we don't have neighbors because we would pretty much annoy the heck out of them from laughing so loud. This is very much like the old TV Land shows like I Love Lucy. It's just good ol' fashioned humor. When I first watched the first few episodes a few months ago I wasn't impressed, but then I gave it another try and we can't stop watching!",1357603200,,609,4.304347826086956

But the four ladies still manage to generate great fun and laughs. Valerie Bertinelli, Jane Leeves, Wendie Malick and the amazing and incomparable Betty White (turning 91 in 1/13) are a great team. Some returning guest stars as Jon Lovitz and John Mahoney provide some deightful moments. And a big highlight is the return of Susan Lucci, creating more mayhem. Great fun, especially since Malick's character of Victoria Chase is based on Lucci. And the now annual birth-date episode provides some good laughs as well.

I hope they continue to make episodes because no show ever made me laugh this much except for That 70's Show. The outtakes are just as funny which is why I buy the season DVD's. So if you want simple humor and all laughs then you have to watch this show...beware, you will be hooked as well!!! LOVE BETTY WHITE!",1354838400,4,485,4.282608695652174

4916266,2,B0060MYMFQ,"Seasons one and two were laugh-out-loud funny, but season three misses. There are some funny moments, but it's not as sharp as the other seasons. It did pick up towards the end, though, so I hope season four will capture the magic that was the first two seasons! I love the entire cast in each respective role.  They do play their characters to perfection, and it's fun to see how well they all get along behind the scenes, too. And naturally Betty White is a scream!!! This season was a waste of their talent... so here's hoping for a turn around in season four.",1345075200,3,563,4.413461538461538
