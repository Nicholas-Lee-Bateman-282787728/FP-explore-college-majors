Now I'll have to buy the movie again from another source. Though this is listed as Desert Heroes, it does not bear that title on the spine, in the opening credits, nowhere. Complete misinformation to once again, rob the avid collector of these obscure gems, of their money. I have two words for the company, that I cannot say here.",1457827200,,497,4.413043478260869
8414477,2,B00439N0EC,"Cheesey, cliche-riddled, film centered on what awful bad-guys der Nazis were - wow now there's an original idea!
Seriously, not the best 'war movie' I've ever seen - mediocre production values, at best, corny dialogue. Nice box art though.
If you like cheesey, corny, 'nazi' flicks, go for it. If you're looking for a sharp, well produced, emotionally evocative film, this ain't it.",1381622400,,382,5.079365079365079
8414478,3,B00439N0EC,Average interest and quality for this genre.  Some of the scenes are pretty explicit with lots of sex and some mutilation.,1379808000,,122,4.809523809523809
