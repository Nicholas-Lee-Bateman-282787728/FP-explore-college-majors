8396566,5,B003GW3SJY,"Last night I attended the launch party for this DVD. This is the story of Andrew DiDonato, a former member of an infamous organized crime family. Over the past month, as a member of the writers' organization Sisters in Crime/Southern Nevada, I've gotten to know Andrew DiDonato who was our guest speaker last month.

The DVD is presented in a straightforward way, casual and candid as is his style. He grew up in the atmosphere of the mob, so it never seemed that it was out of the ordinary. It was more the norm, because that's what he knew. From boosting cars at age fourteen, he rose in the ranks of the family, only to find himself with a price on his head, on the run with two possible choices...be shot dead on the streets or face life in prison. Then a third choice opened which placed him in a position of helping the government understand organized crime.

The story is told simply. Andrew sitting on a sofa in closeup, telling his sometimes chilling, sometimes humorous anecdotes, but in the real world it was nothing like the TV or movie image.
