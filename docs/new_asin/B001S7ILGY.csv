3784568,1,B001S7ILGY,"This family is such a sham. Notwithstanding the fact that Jon and Kate are having affairs and won't break up because of the cash cow that the show has become (it should be called Pimp my Sextuplets), this season is one big commercial. No normal family gets to do the quantity of trips and outings they do. I don't begrudge them these things but the show is supposed to be about a normal family, not some made for TV Monkee-esque family that deals with fame- not at least when they are crying ""poor us"" to churches and accepting love offerings and $20/pic of their kids. Save your money for something worthwhile.",1243555200,10,611,4.513513513513513

3784570,5,B001S7ILGY,"I think we all need to stop and think about what Jon and Kate do every single day of their lives. They are great examples of parents who do everything for their kids.  For those who think they are doing this show only for the money need to realize that this family has 8 children.  8 little bodies to feed, nurture, and help grow into adults.  How would most of us pay for a family a 10?  A majority of the middle class could not begin to financially take care of 8 kids. This show gave them the opportunity to stay at home with their kids.  I would do the same.  Jon and Kate would have to work 60+ hours a week to afford childcare, food, clothes, etc.  They never would see their kids.  This show gives them the opportunity to be a part of their kid's lives.  Their gone for public events for the show....every once and a while.  Most parents see their kids maybe 25 hours a week.  I praise this family.  They deserve all the support they can get and I for one applauded not only them but Kate's books as well.",1241654400,7,1012,4.133333333333334
3784571,1,B001S7ILGY,I wouldnt waste one penny on this and make these greedy parents even more rich. They don't deserve it and they need to get off the gravy train and BE with their kids and stop letting nannies and anyone else raise their kids. Its truly disgusting.,1241395200,12,246,4.369565217391305
3784572,1,B001S7ILGY,"I really enjoyed the first 2 seasons of this show. Even though Kate would nag sometimes, it seemed like the family had lots of fun and loved each other. By Season 4, the show just seemed so staged. The kids seemed less happy, Kate was always putting Jon down. It is all about free trips and luxry. Just 1 year before we watched the family struggle on long road trips and it was a learning experience. Suddenly it is all limos and handlers for the kids.  I watched season 4 to see what happens, but I sure would not want to watch it a second time. The first 2 seasons are fun to look back on andI feel are very re-watchable. Season 4 I feel is not and I feel is not worth the money. I wish they had stopped while they were still likeable.",1239840000,29,737,4.082758620689655
3784573,2,B001S7ILGY,"I've been an avid fan of Jon and Kate since season 1. I agree with the other reviewer who said that the first few seasons they (Kate especially) were all about family, being and doing things together. Now, Kate's gone what seems like alot and Jon's home with the kids in alot of the episodes. Or vice versa. It's a shame to see what was a family trying to raise their kids with values taken by dollar signs.",1239667200,15,407,4.230769230769231
3784574,2,B001S7ILGY,"I absolutely agree about this show. I used to love watching them in their everday normal life. They all seemed so normal clipping coupons, the kids going to school, the family always doing stuff together close to home. Now since they are famous they are always going on huge expensive trips, buying a super expensive home, and they rarely spend ""family time"" together anymore. It is more like there is a storyline in the newer episodes. It is okay that they have finished their show, they are not the same anymore and I lost interest.",1238976000,16,534,4.631578947368421

For those who love the series these episodes only make it easier to love the Gosselin family. For those who were casual watcher's or who already found issue with the show or family these episodes give that much more reason to further dislike them. I personally enjoyed it when they were in their home living what seemed to be a normal life and came to think of them as a normal family. Here I found the series less interesting as you can see the fame they acquired through the show actually affecting their lifestyles and not just granting their children simple rights but granting them a new lifestyle where they can vacation seemingly on end and afford major trips to Hawaii. Like I said I'm not hating, just personally losing interest as I see the family I knew fading away, but for those who love this show and this family these episodes are a definite five stars. Though personally I can only give them three. Thanks.

May 27th, 2009 ***After the fifth season premiere and Jon & Kate's recent marital troubles the whole idea of renewing their vows in Hawaii seems redundant or contradicted a bit now. A lot of people seem to be hating on this couple, but while I agree they lost focus of what was and still should be important I do hope that they can get back on track and figure things out, possibly put a rest to this show and go back to enjoying their lives and what truly matters in them. I wish they'd at least stop the show for a while to clean up the mess their lives are becoming. It's sad to see this happen to a couple that started out with all their priorities straight and only a few personality quirks that each of us can really be guilty of.",1237248000,21,2282,4.314685314685315

3784593,1,B001S7ILGY,This was a good show at first but now with everything going on i refuse to continue to pay these people to act the way that they are it is no longer a good family show and will never buy anything endorsed or marketing them again.,1253232000,,229,4.0
3784594,3,B001S7ILGY,"This dvd set is as entertaining as the previous seasons, but nothing really stands out. The kids are as cute as ever, but the arguements are a bit too thick and fast with Jon and Kate. Good as light entertainment.",1252886400,,213,4.35
3784595,1,B001S7ILGY,"Kate Gosselin filed divorce papers that said she and her husband Jon had been separated for 2 years. This bogus wedding that they had last year in Hawaii was nothing but a lie. A lie to their children who they told "" Mommy and Daddy will always be together,"" Lies to their family and friends and most of all lies to their fans.
  Fraudulent charges should be brought against them both for the money they have made from the time of their separation continuing up to now. They lied for the purpose of making money bilking the publishing company, promoters, churches and church members and others out of thousands. They conned especially people at speaking engagements out of a lot of money by crying poverty when in fact they were buying top of the line cars, going on 20,000 dollar vacations, buying up gucci and other brand names for themselves while their kids are living on Gymboree handouts and other freebies the kids get.
  Those church members who are struggling to make a buck and gave Jon and Kate their last dimes and nickles should file for compensitory damages to try and recoup their money.
  Jon and Kate are frauds and should be prosecuted to the fullest extent for cheating the public out of the publics hard earned money.
  I will never buy another Gosselin product again and I will boycott any organization, tv show or any other venue that Kate and Jon are using to make money for themselves and the grand lifestyle they have become accustomed to living.",1246752000,7,1471,4.630769230769231
8339436,5,B001S7ILGY,"My favorite episode from this season was ""Backyard Campout"" because it's just so fun to see the 8 kids getting a glimpse of what camping is like. And to make it more funny Kate said that there were bears coming for Joel.
