6937628,1,B00RZXWV5M,Not worth the money.  If you look at the fine print on the packaging it states this movie is not endorsed by the FF.  Some of the interviews were interesting but overall a waste of money.,1430179200,9,187,4.166666666666667
6937629,2,B00RZXWV5M,Not what I thought it would be. There is no original Foo Fighters music or interviews.,1428537600,10,86,4.4375
6937630,1,B00RZXWV5M,"You can find and watch this entire DVD on YouTube.  It is a complete waste of your money, and I highly discourage this purchase.  Amazon should include a higher standard when giving a product description.  I blame Amazon for this substandard product.",1428192000,11,250,4.904761904761905
6937631,1,B00RZXWV5M,Not good. Not their real music. No interviews with the band. A total waste of time and money.  Do not buy.  So beyond disappointed.,1428105600,4,131,4.416666666666667
6937632,1,B00RZXWV5M,"Buyer beware. I wish I had waited instead of throwing it in my cart as soon as Amazon offered it with the Sonic Highways DVD release.  As soon as I saw that the  ""No original Foo Fighters music is included in this release. This biography is not authorized by the band.""  I knew I had made a mistake.  It's not even that it's unauthorized, it's just not good.  Interviews are with people who have only a vague connection to the band.  Nothing new here.  Video is poor quality. Save your money.",1427673600,4,492,4.34065934065934

6937636,1,B00RZXWV5M,"TERRIBLE, JUST TERRIBLE,  This is an unauthorized documentary of the Foo Fighters.  The only connection to Dave and his band are a bunch of video clips weaved together between ridiculous commentary by unknown people.  DO NOT BUY!",1426118400,36,229,5.135135135135135
6937637,5,B00RZXWV5M,"No, I have not seen it yet, but c'mon,...ANYTHING with Dave and the boys in it is going to be PERFECT! A value at even 4 times the cost!",1421884800,9,136,3.7241379310344827
