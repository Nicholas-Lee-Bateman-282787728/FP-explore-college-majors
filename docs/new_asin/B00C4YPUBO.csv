5690740,5,B00C4YPUBO,"While John Neumeier's contemporary version of ""Sacre"" with Dresden (?), which I viewed at Teatro Massimo in Palermo, was even more exciting, this DVD is an historic document that all music lovers should view.  The production of Firebird is glorious, too.",1390262400,3,254,5.195121951219512
5690741,5,B00C4YPUBO,"There is a recurring theme in the arts that if you try and reconstruct something ancient using modern resources, you end up with something new entirely.  By trying to recreate the experience of ancient Greek theater, both opera and the music of Harry Partch emerged.  Neither got the original experience perfectly right, but instead created something new with their resources.  The same thing happened when Stravinsky and Nijinsky tried to recreate the experience of the inhabitants of ancient Russia.  They certainly didn't recreate it exactly, but what we got out of it was The Rite of Spring, one of the greatest ballets ever.
The Mariinsky Orchestra and Ballets performances of The Firebird and The Rite of Spring on DVD is a great performance that highlights a similar process that went into these works reconstruction.  With no video documentation of the original productions, the choreography was painstakingly reconstructed from sketches, diaries, and reviews of the original productions.  The process of reviving these works parallel their artistic inception.
As someone who has more familiarity with Stravinskys music, the choreography especially stood out.  While Stravinskys music on its own can be a freewheeling beast in the concert hall, the performances and the interviews on this DVD reiterate that the choreography was what really elicited the violent, riotous reaction from the audience.
 The music projected very well on TV speakersI could hear the winds very clearly and that was really great for me.  If you're familiar with the Firebird suite, you might get thrown off by the pacing of the themes in the unabridged work, but overall its still quite enjoyable even if you're just listening and not watching.
 From the choreography side, if you're looking for a DVD for your 4-year-old daughter who likes ballerinas to watch, this is not the thing to get.  While there are some traditional Swan-Lakey kinds of gesturing, especially in Firebird, a lot of the dancing is angular, gyrating, almost-epileptic movement.  Dont get me wrong, its AWESOME, but its not traditional.  I was in awe at the physicality of these dancers, especially of the crotchety yet powerful King Katschei in Firebird.
 There are some flubs that make it into the final cuts of these performances, like an apple being dropped on the stage that gets in the dancers way during Firebird, but chalking them up to the variability and excitement of live performance, you can easily get past it.  The supplemental material, including interviews with the artistic team that mounted the production, is informative and not overly long.  This material focuses on the choreography, and not so much on Stravinskys compositional process, but its still a great resource for musicians, dancers, and amateurs alike.",1387324800,16,2791,5.2242152466367715
5690742,5,B00C4YPUBO,Excellent production of the original staging. What was merely conjecture before has now been brought back to stunning life. Terrific!,1381536000,3,133,5.7
8577345,4,B00C4YPUBO,"I love the music and the excruciatingly original dance...what I find excruciating in a wholly different way is the manic camera work.  The ballet was conceived to be see from an audience in a theater...eyes forward...the whole stage visible all the time.  Why does a camera director believe that he will improve on the artistic inspiration of Nijinsky and Stravinsky??  The stage is a picture...close ups and isolations and overheads and cuts to the intentionally out-of-sight orchestra are merely distractions.

How I long for a good production of this filmed without the careening camera.  If the camera guys are bored, try some Adderall  for the duration.  Do they or the producers imagine that buyers of this DVD are bored by ballet stage productions??  It's a ""fan"" audience that is ready and willing to sit still and watch raptly and quietly, avoiding distractions.",1506211200,,871,5.084507042253521
8577346,2,B00C4YPUBO,"Why is it that GREAT Music Performances are always RUINED by a Producer, Director and Editor who have ZERO CONCEPT of what a viewer wants to see? I saw this same performance with a different director posted on YouTube earlier and was Absolutely DELIGHTED with what I saw! Why? Because the director of that production WISELY kept 'close up' shots to a minimum and let the 'wide shots' of the entire ballet performers visually DAZZLE my eyes with a Beautifully Coordinated and Choreographed performance. I was FURIOUS when I started watching this DVD performance which was LOADED with close ups of head, back, butt and sometimes STAGNANT shots of performers while other actions were happening. Essentially, you MISSED the 'Real Time' performance of what went on and was just like putting your hand over your eye while watching! This could have received an A+ rating! Search YouTube and you'll see what I'm talking about!
 * The audio, and video, recording was Top Notch!",1503532800,,968,4.938650306748467
8577347,5,B00C4YPUBO,"An outstanding and unusual production of the rite of spring.  The original ballet version of the music is different from standard orchestral versions.  It's fascinating to watch what was likely close to Nijinsky's choreography, although, I can't imagine what drove him to create dance of that style.

The firebird is lovely and well-danced.

The video and audio quality are most excellent.  An interesting feature of the dvd is that it opens with close up shots of the orchestra, performers, and conductor Gergiev.  It's lovely to watch them make the music, certainly an equal component of the overall performance.

The case/booklet is also of excellent quality, with good write ups of the 3 main creators, Nijinsky, Fokine, and Stravinsky.  Good photos of the production/dancers are a nice reminder of the performances.  I only wish this hi-def rendition had been available on blu ray.",1481414400,,886,5.183098591549296
8577348,5,B00C4YPUBO,Wonderful! Stravinsky's music and the dancers' artistry make for a DVD to enjoy over and over.,1470441600,,94,4.9375

8577350,5,B00C4YPUBO,"This later version of Stravinsky's RITE OF SPRING was great, even better than the earlier version.
Also included on the DVD was Stravinsky's FIREBIRD, which was an added bonus.
We received the DVD in a very short time after ordering and it was well packaged.

Thank you.

8577351,4,B00C4YPUBO,"For years, I have wanted to see a video of Sacre being danced with something like the original costumes and choreography.  This met my expectations.  I would have liked to see more discussions of the productions but it's a real treasure.",1441584000,3,237,4.7560975609756095
8577352,5,B00C4YPUBO,"I was delighted to  see Le Sacre de printemps done in a manner that
approximates the original one. Now over 100 years old, the work
never fails to shock and delight.",1428192000,5,165,4.32258064516129
8577353,5,B00C4YPUBO,"A nice treat for me and a great tribute to the centennial of ROS.  The choreography of ROS was fascinating, and the sound quality was excellent.  Firebird was also outstanding.",1413244800,,176,4.833333333333333
8577354,5,B00C4YPUBO,I have no complaints with the content of this DVD. This performance is probably the best I've ever seen on DVD compared to whatever else is currently on the market.,1401580800,,164,4.5
