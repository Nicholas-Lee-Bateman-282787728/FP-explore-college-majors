2555091,3,B000F9RLL2,"I found this movie funny. No, it's not Oscar material.  It's not meant to be.  It's meant to make you LAUGH.  And everybody in the audience was.  I will say I thought the cat on the toilet scene was gross. But the rest was pretty funny even though apparently some people are upset that they couldn't figure out what movie they were lampooning. The funniest scenes were the male lead playing a ""Pretty Woman"" prostitute (he didn't look bad) and when Julia commandeers a motorcycle to get back to her fiance - the stunt person riding the bike is obviously a black man in a pink dress. What was that about? Oh well, it was funny. Throughout the movie, Julia maintains her optimism in life, interspersed with a little low self-esteem.

Don't give up, Prince Charming is out there - you just have to overlook a lot once you find him.",1141171200,3,828,4.456953642384106
2555092,3,B000F9RLL2,"Meet the Parents and Pretty Woman were just a few of many bits and pieces they had in this movie. This movie was soo stupid. I don't mean Napolean Dynomite stupid or Anchorman stupid. A fat ugly girl turns into a skinny and beautiful after seeing Hitch in a Pimp My Ride attempt and ends up on The Bachelorette where a weirdo bachelor shoots off the loser opponents and ends up marrying her. There are many funny scenes in the movie, like the cat that takes a dump and the Michael Jackson scenes. The plot is so stupid. This movie is so stupid, that I guess it was pretty funny. It had me laughing. I seen it on a 4 dollar Tuesday night so I suggest you do the same.",1141171200,3,666,4.130769230769231
2555093,1,B000F9RLL2,"I enjoy spoof movies.  I've seen ""Airplane"" a million times, the Scary Movie franchise still makes me laugh, and the ""Naked Gun"" films were inspired and fresh.  Heck, even  ""Not Another Teen Movie"" had its funny moments.

This film, on the other hand, simply falls flat.  I think the writers forgot that to make a spoof, they had to do more than just menetion the movie they are spoofing, or at least make the spoof moment somewhat satirical and entertaining.  It's like they made a list of all the films they wanted to make fun of and then couldn't come up with ways to make them funny.

Examples:

1)  We need to spoof Pretty Woman!  Let's have the male star dress up as a hooker and walk down Melrose in a flashback sequence!  Wait a minute, huh?  Why is the male star imitating a female prostitute again?

2)  We need to spoof Meet the Parents!  I know, let's have the goofy Ben Stiller character knock down the urn with the mother's ashes in it, only THIS time, we'll have an entire dead body spill out of the urn instead of ashes.  Oh that will be a hoot!  And THEN we'll have the cat go and french kiss the dead body instead of pee on it.  That's hysterical!

3)  We need to spoof Kill Bill!!  (Wait... what?  Is that even a date movie?)

4)  We need to spoof Hitch. I know!  Let's have a dwarf play some guy named Hitch who gives love advice to our lead female.  Hysterical!

5)  We need to spoof When Harry Met Sally.  I have a great idea.  For no reason at all, we'll start a dinner scene with our male star faking an orgasm (ridiculously I might add).  He won't be trying to prove a point or anything, he'll just be wailing around like a dying seal for no reason at all at the beginning of the scene.  That will get a huge laugh.

6)  We need to spoof My Big Fat Greek Wedding.  So let's have our female be a member of a huge family, and we'll have her father be a black man and her mother be Indian.  That's too much humor right there folks.

I could go on and on, but I think you get the point.  This movie doesn't hit the same, satirical notes that better spoof movies do.  It just succeeds in mentioning a bunch of date movies and making you feel sick to your stomach while at the same time feeling confused.  I guess that's worth ONE star....",1140998400,23,2258,4.172494172494172
2555094,2,B000F9RLL2,"A good laugh, but only if you have seen a lot of ""date movies"" - which is the only true way to see the humor in this movie. I was surprised that they dug back as far as they did - I expected it would be just current ""date"" movies. Went back to Pretty Woman and even Say Anything!

2555095,1,B000F9RLL2,"The problem with this film is that it tries way too hard.  It doesn't let the jokes softly fall but it's beats the jokes sensless and ruins what could have been funny.  Not to mention what other reviewers have already mentioned but this film tries to make funny what has already been proven to be funny.  I do want to point out though that this has worked in the past.  ""NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE"" spoofed all the teen comedies and it worked because it made fun of the heart and morale of teen comedies, thus pointing at the emotional core and making you laugh at it.  It was hilarious and much much better than this mess.  That and the fact that the acting is awful and the jokes are over done and rediculous.  The fatsuit part was funny, but the ""pimp your ride"" spoof was so retarded I almost walked out, and that was only 5 minutes into the movie.  The only funny scene to me involved the spoof on Meet the Parents house cat Jinxy, but even that was over the top and only funny to those with sick minds.  I suggest you skip this movie because it will only dissapoint.  Rent the films this movie spoofs...they are actually funny and worth the money to rent them.",1140393600,2,1162,4.2889908256880735
2555096,2,B000F9RLL2,"NO SPOILERS, NO FEARS! I do mention what it parodies in parts, but no scenes are actually given.

The whole parody movie thing goes way back to the 60s and 70s with classics like Blazing Saddles and the Monte Python movies and beyond.  Lately, in the new wave of parodies: Austin Powers, Scary Movie, etc, they have usually gone into simple, incomplex story lines based on movies that have been recently featured, or as some would consider overrated.  Date Movie does this, but unsuccessfully.

SYNOPSIS: Julia (Hannigan) is a fat, lonely girl that is looking for a fairy tale Mr. Right, with parents having high expectations of meeting their family's cultural boundaries: African-American, Indian, Japanese, AND Jewish.  To help meet this Mr. Right, she goes to 'Hitch' and is 'Pimped' to be the Alyson Hannigan we know and love today.  With her new slender body, she goes onto a reality show, where she meets Mr. Right, but not her parent's view of Mr. Right.  Somehow he must make her parents feel comfortable with the marriage, accept him as their son-in-law, and avoid the temptations of his ex girlfriend.

A real problem with Date Movie is that it really doesn't go with a strait theme.  Date Movie implies that it is a parody of chick flicks, romance movies, and comedies.  It branchs off however going into odd questionable movie situations like, Kill Bill.  Also, there are a lot of movies that were used that weren't widely seen, or were too old for a lot of younger people to actually catch the intended joke.  Unfortunately, this doesn't appeal to any older folks, so the jokes are completely lost.

Another major problem, and probably the biggest, is that it throws each parody at you in rapid succession.  Suddenly its Meet the Parents/Fockers, to Big Fat Greek Wedding, to Pretty Woman, to Say Anything, and even the Bachelor, all within a 10 minute period what it seems.  This incredibly short 80 MINUTE MOVIE!! has all these parodies, but unlike Scary Movie, which has many of the same writers, doesn't stay with one or two story lines.  Scary Movie one parodies Scream, Scary Movie 2 parodies House on Haunted Hill, and although a large portion of Scary Movie 3 was dedicated to 8 Mile, and a small to the Matrix, it was mostly Signs and the Ring, and meshed much better.  All branch offs in this movie were sporatic and random, having nothing to do with plot enhancement.

Finally, this movie just wasn't that funny.  There are no memorable scenes from this movie that you can joke around with your friends the next day, not memorible scenes that just made you laugh so hard to pee yourself... all jokes fell flat, and made you feel like they tried way to hard to make you laugh.  THe most you'll get out of this movie is a har har.  It was to some extend entertaining, and you kept watching just to know what happened, but its a one time see at best!

BOTTOM LINE: DOLLAR FLICK!! (Maybe on Tuesdays for 50 cents)",1140220800,3,2933,4.654368932038835
2555097,2,B000F9RLL2,"Date Movie has some funny moments.  But they are the kind of funny moments where you are almost embarrassed to find yourself laughing at these completely retarded, senseless jokes that should only be funny to those around the age of 10.  The reason that Date Movie really doesn't work is the fact that a lot of the movies that it spoofs are already comedies.  Therefore, all the funny moments are basically just retreads of the funny parts of actual good comedies released over the past few years.  If you wanna know the basic trend of the jokes in Date Movie, go rent your favorite romantic comedy, and imagine all the jokes in that movie if they were blatantly sexualized or made so unimaginably disgusting that even I could barely handle what I was watching.  There is no redeeming quality or character to Date Movie.  The movie has about 4 or 5 funny moments, and will be completely offensive to most of the people who decide to throw down 7 bucks to see it.",1140220800,2,962,4.531791907514451
2555098,2,B000F9RLL2,"I hate to steal something from someone else's review, but I can't sum up the problem with this movie any better than Eric D. Snider of ErikDSnider.com: ""This would-be spoof of romantic comedies falls prey to the misconception -- common in modern American humor -- that to make reference to something is the same thing as parodying it.""

Because that is precisely what Date Movie does.  It simply references movies without actually parodying them.

The sad thing is, the funniest scene in the movie, is the opening sequence where Allison Hannigan, sporting the obligatory fat suit as they ""parody"" Jack Black's Shallow Hal, dances around in the streets to Kelis' sexy tune ""Milkshake.""  Which incidentally is also the trailer.  Everything goes downhill from there.

The general gist of the film is Alyson Hannigan, a Greek, Indian, Japanese, Black Jew is having trouble finding her ""Prince Charming"", quite obviously because she is not the most beautiful of women.  Her father (played by Eddie Griffin) wants her to marry someone who is of her same descent, and somehow manages to have someone in mind: a greasy disgusting employee of their restaurant named Nicky who's so dirty he's got a rat in his ass crack.  But Julia (Alyson's character) refuses.  She insists she has to wait for true love--her prince charming.  And she finds him--kind of.

She meets a guy who's eating in the restaurant and she feels like they have a connection, but as soon as she turns her back he disappears--she assumes because of the way she looks but it's really because she hit him in the head with a coffeepot and he fell to the ground.  You're laughing, right?  Yeah, I didn't either.

So she goes to Hitch, (subtle, right?) a matchmaker played by little person Tony Cox (Bad Santa) who takes her to get ""pimped out"" (""parodying"" MTV's Pimp My Ride).  They wax her back hair, saw down her toe nails, and suck out her fat.  Julia is now a beautiful girl.  Eventually she finds Grant (played by newcomer Adam Campbell), they fall in love, have sex, get engaged, and antics ensue.

One of the biggest problems with Date Movie even before anyone wrote a single word of it onto a page, is simply the concept itself.  The Scary Movie movies (which I love, by the way) work because they're making fun of movies that were meant to be taken seriously.  It doesn't quite work when you're trying to make something funny that was already funny in the first place.  There's no need to make a joke out of a romantic comedy--it does the jokes for you--IN the film.

With that said, there was still a possibility for a half way decent film here.  The obstacle being: the jokes just went too far.  In almost every scene in the movie, they'd make a joke--I'd laugh, and them expect them to move on.  But they didn't.  They'd just keep going with the same joke for another 2 minutes, going way overboard to point of ridiculousness, and I'd sit there getting annoyed and feeling patronized, which would immediately make me forget that a second ago I was actually laughing.  Just make the jokes a bit more subtle (we get them, trust us), and you'd be fine.

Case in point: In one scene where they try to make fun of the Jennifer Lopez romantic comedy The Wedding Planner, Julia and Grant go see a wedding planner whimsically named Jello who has a ghetto Spanish accent and has a ridiculously large ass.  We all immediately get the joke.  It's supposed to be Jennifer Lopez...and Jennifer Lopez has a big ass.  It's funny.  Okay, move on with the scene.  Jello them describes to them what she has planned for their wedding and says ""I have a performer in mind too"".  She knocks the desk over with her oversized butt, the desk breaks, she strips off her suit to reveal a skimpy gold outfit, and then starts shaking her ass in Julia and Grant's faces, slowly moving it closer and closer to them while they scream in horror.  The scene ends.

Yeah...I'm not laughing either.

The film makes fun of dozens of movies, When Harry Met Sally, The Wedding Planner, Meet The Parents, Meet The Fockers, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Hitch, My Best Friend's Wedding, and many others.  And again, unlike the Scary Movie films, they failed to weave the different films together into one script successfully.  Everything seems choppy and shabbily put together.  It's almost embarassing.

Basically, Date Movie is in no way worth the 10.75 (at least that's what it is here in Manhattan).  It attempts to make fun of many popular romantic comedies of the past two decades, but unfortunately for the filmmakers, I much prefer the originals.",1140134400,9,4579,4.693851944792974

I have to give Alyson Hannigan credit for enthusiastically saying her lines as if they're actually funny, and credit to the cinematographers who filmed it very professionally as if it's a real movie.  I can't imagine how any of them got mixed up in this scriptless, jokeless waste of time.  I cut my losses after 15 minutes and said adios.  Imagine a movie that tries and fails to imitate Airplane, but instead of rapidly hammering you with joke after joke, stretches each sight gag as long as possible (okay, I get it, they're licking each other instead of kissing - how long will this go on?), and has gaps between the characters' lines because there just isn't enough material to fill this 85-minute movie.

Like a sarcastic joke idly spoken in mixed company that backfires horribly, resulting in an embarrassment that haunts the joker to his grave.

The producers of these spoofs are trying to cram so many pop culture references as they can into their films that they overlook the importance of telling a story. The further a joke diverts from the subject matter, the funnier it has to be out of context. And these jokes don't even stand up on their own. They are nothing more than references to other works, containing none of the irony upon which humor relies.

If your idea of funny is one ""Hey, remember this other film?"" after another ad infinitum, I'm sure you'll have plenty to laugh about while wasting your time not doing something that might educate you to the point that you would rightfully find this material not only unfunny, but a regretfully irreversible waste of resources that only serves to demean the film industry as a whole.",1346198400,,1103,4.739583333333333

I only heard bits and pieces of track whenever there's nothing going on in the movie (which is 60% of the time), and it was quite illuminating.  They talked about how the directors are being too accepting with their parodies, or inconsistent gags, and the massive padding this film fluffed to reach the minimum feature-length duration.  Certainly worth listening for those who liked to know why this film's bad.

5. THE LAUGH TRACK. Another cool DVD extra that I heard bits and pieces of.  It didn't make the film funnier (or just funny in general), but I think this audio track goes into the mindset of the directors.  Hearing giggles and 'awws' during pivotal stupid moments made me realize just how disturbing the directors are.

With ""Epic Movie"" (urgh!) and this movie, I come to understand a little more about a common preset for the [blank] Movie franchise: include lots of popular references whenever it can (regardless of context and even if the reference won't matter after a brief period of time), incorporate a dance sequence and/or sing-a-long somewhere in the film, someone's face has to be covered in body hair or doo-doo, have the gags extended as long as possible, end the movie with an annoying hip-hop song, and add Carmen Electra. It's this recurring preset that many people largely denounce the film as sacrilegious material.

But to be frank, ""Date Movie"" is slightly, partially, minimally, sort of not terrible.  I could be saying that because Alyson is hot, but it's also because among other films by 2 of the 6 ""Scary Movie"" writers, this film is the most faithful in having parodies that actually follow the genre it's lampooning (""Kill Bill"" and ""Napoleon Dynamite"" notwithstanding), rather than just throw in a bunch of pop-culture jokes that have nothing to do with the theme.  That's the big issue with later films, but just because this is the 'better' film, it doesn't excuse itself from being repulsively bad.",1282089600,,2762,4.869658119658119

It's a great spoof film that picks at the chick flick genre, and many others such as My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Hitch, Meet the Parents, My Best Friend's Wedding, Kill Bill, and many others. An obese woman named Julia Jones thinks she will never find true love. After Hitch pimps her out, she goes on The Extreme Bachelor, and the bachelor is a man named Grant who begins to fall in love with her. Julia's dad doesn't approve of him because Grant isn't a Greek Indian Japanese Jew. Grant's ex-girlfriend comes along and tries to split them up.

Instead of delivering solid comic timing and well thought out laughs, `Date Movie' just tosses everything it can think of at you.  Nothing sticks.

She's long been the sidekick in movies and other TV shows as well such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer but shows with this she can play the leading role. I hope she keeps making How I Met Your Mother but I hope she gets more opportunities like this to be the leading comedy actor in future projects as she has talent I'd never realised she had before.

Many, many romantic films, such as ""Pretty Woman,"" ""When Harry Met Sally,"" and more recent ones are parodied, as well as TV shows, high tech gadgets. celebrities and other pop culture phenomenon.  Other movies which don't fall under the romance genre are spoofed as well.  Like ""Napoleon Dynamite.""  Which sounds humorous perhaps, but it's not.  The guy in the cubicle next to yours probably has a better imitation.  At any rate, imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but without a twist of originality, the joke falls flat.  It's like the filmmakers pulled a bunch of things to mock out of a hat and then put them all in a blender and pressed High for the ultimate in noxious pop culture blends.  Recommended only for die-hard Hannigan fans or perhaps the inebriated.

Horrible parody of romantic movies and comedies alike like ""Meet the Parents/Fockers"", ""My Best Friend's Wedding"", ""Napoleon Dynamite"", ""Say Anything"", etc. including some non-romantic movies like ""Kill Bill"", ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Star Wars Episode III"" and such all as the directorial debuts from Jason Friedberg and Aaron Setlzer.

Fred Willard with Jennifer Coolidge and Eddie Griffin co-star but they can't save this disaster of a so-called spoof although Hannigan and Monk are sexy as hell in this movie.

2555165,2,B000F9RLL2,"One of the reasons I watched ""Date Movie"" is Alyson Hannigan, star of ""American Pie"" and ""Buffy, the Vampure Slayer."" And I am a fan of parody movies since the days of masterpieces like ""Airplane!"" But what I found here is only half-baked jokes, or not even jokes, just references to other better films and of-screen news about celebrities like Michael Jackson and Paris Hilton.

I agree with most of the reviewers who found ""Date Movie"" very unfunny. The film contains jokes that are silly, sexual and gross, three major components that are visible in the recent trend of spoofs, but I don't mind if jokes are silly, sexual and gross. I love them. I watched ""Borat"" which has all of these three, and there are lots of them (plus politically incorrect jokes) and I enjoyed the film very much.

What is most disappointing about ""Date Movie"" - and the most irritating thing about it - is its laziness. The filmmakers go from one gag to another without developing it. Each joke is not big or clever (including references to ""Brigit Jones's Diary,"" Darth Vader, clown dance (with the soundtrack from ""The Rize,"" etc) and there is nothing more to that. The film moves on to the next one, trying to find a new target which is not necessarily date movie. Sometimes it does the same joke over and over again. The prolonged ""cat-in-the-bathroom"" joke is unbearable.

I almost forgot to mention the star of the film Alyson Hannigan. Sure, she is game, fun to watch, ready to do whatever she has to do (including embarrassingly unfunny dancing in fat suit and a huge zit). And she is sadly wasted.",1187481600,2,1586,4.6571428571428575

I know that spoof movies are supposed to be stupid and funny, but this movie was heavy in stupid, and very light in funny.  I've never heard a theater so quiet in a comedy.  I think I only heard chuckles during three parts in the movie.  The writers just tried too hard to be funny.  The movie might have been better if they had concentrated on a few movies and used acting to make it funny, instead of watching a fake cat taking a crap on a toilet.  And even that could have been funny if they hadn't made the segment a couple of minutes long.

I compare this movie with what a guy from our high school did for a talent show.  He thought it would be funny to put on a penguin suit and waddled around to classical music.  Maybe funny in premise, but turned out to be the most akward and stupid three minutes I've watched.

-  A script offering too little material to fill a standard motion picture.

-  Actors almost perform to an acceptable level, almost.

-  Unleveled audio mixing!  Even direct to DVD movies (usually) have acceptable audio -mixing!

-  The genre chosen to parody already relies heavily on parody; a parody of a parody is unsuccessful when approached on an obvious surface level.

Two bonus features of this disk, the unrated DVD edition, are awesome and worth the price of a rental and possible a purchase as they provide a one-off form of entertainment from an unexpected and fresh angle.

""The Quickie"" is the entire feature chopped down to a six minute form that manages to convey both the plot (such that exists in the feature) and all of the gags that actually draw laughs.  ""The Quickie"" demonstrate that ""Date Movie"" should've been a segment on Saturday Night Live, Mad TV, or similar television show.  Skip the feature, just watch ""The Quickie"" and then move on to the ""Anti-Commentary""

""The Anti-Commentary"" is a real jewel, a bonus audio track featuring two film editors, one who hated the film, and the other who feels compelled to apologize for writing a review that suggested that some people may enjoy this movie.  Neither critic is particularly witty or charming, but they do speak honestly and lucidly for the duration of the film, and I found listening to them enormously entertaining.  They do not try to be funny, like the ""critics"" in Mystery Science Theater 3000, and they do not understand why they were asked to do the commentary or how it will benefit the studio or the filmmaker.  Rather, these intelligent and articulate men, without being pompous and while remaining earnest, talk about the movie and the context of the movie, and as an absurdist legal limitation they are forbidden to mention the names of the movies being parodied.  ""The Anti-Commentary"" was a brave choice, and I am very thankful that it was included.  Similar features should become standard fare.",1164499200,,2389,4.7682926829268295

The concept is very funny (mock some of the most popular ""Date"" movies of the year: Bridget Jones, Meet the Fockers, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Hitch) but mostly I found myself staring blankly at the screen.

I even said aloud (more than once): ""Let's just stop watching it, please.""

But since we *rented* it I suppose we felt obliged to ""get our money's worth"".

Seriously though, it was a waste of two hours.  Watch the trailer and chuckle.  But save yourself and refrain from watching the entire film.

Let me be perfectly clear about this: Date Movie may be the worst movie ever made; it's certainly the worst comedy ever even conceived of.  You may cry, you may scream, you may even go insane at the infinite stupidity of this film, but you will not laugh or grin or even smirk at the abysmal antics on display here - not once.  It doesn't matter if you get any of the jokes or recognize all of the films and other things being spoofed because this movie thoroughly blows chunks.  The only thing I got out of this movie was an awful headache.  If you ask me, everyone associated with this film should be banned from the entertainment industry for at least ten years - if not for life.  Had the first fish who ever crawled out of the water known that millions of years of evolution would give birth to Date Movie, he would have stayed in the ocean.

Whatever happened to that sweet and charming girl we came to know during the first couple of years of Buffy the Vampire Slayer?  Why and how did it ever come to this: Alyson Hannigan humiliating herself in such raunchy, tasteless, unoriginal drivel?  She can still light up the screen with that smile of hers, and she certainly put a lot into her performance, but I'm embarrassed for her here.  She plays an overweight, very disgusting waitress from a mixed family (boy, is it mixed) who is desperate to find her Prince Charming.  After convincing Hitch (Tony Cox) to help her find love, she's given a complete overhaul (literally), plunked down into a reality dating show, and actually finds a man.  We watch them go through the dating stage, the meet the in-laws stage, and the wedding stage, encountering a number of obstacles to their future happiness.  Really, though, the story is unimportant; all the script cares about are stereotypes, clich&eacute;s, toilet humor, and things that make you go yuck.  There's no joke too hackneyed, no visual too disgusting, and no dialogue too stupid to throw in the mix.

I'm generally a fan of dumb comedies and ridiculous spoofs, but this mess doesn't even qualify for the genre.  Date Movie is so utterly atrocious that you can't even laugh at it.  It's a complete and utter failure in every way possible.",1163894400,,2396,4.639810426540285

With a number of spoofs coming out in recent years, the producers of this film have tried to cash in on the trend and failed. For starters, they hired the wrong scriptwriters. Well thats basically it, they managed to sabotage this movie on their own. The idea was good, but the execution was poor. The cast was promising and well selected, but sadly didn't have a lot to work with.

The first 15 minutes were actually quite good and very funny and I thought this was going to be a very good movie, but sadly, it nose-dived from here. Instead of focusing on 3 or 4 films to take the mocker out of, it got stuck into way too many and things just get carried away.

There are a few very funny scenes, involving either Tony Cox or a cat who drew the biggest laugh out of me

Stoned teenagers may get a kick out of this movie, but anyone else with half a brain will find this the longest 80 minutes of their life. Not worth the money Im sorry to say.

Date Movie, following in the footsteps of so many films before it, is a parody of several movies including My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Hitch, Meet the Fockers, Meet the Parents, and many (too many) more.
It is humorous... at times.  The casting is all right, though most of the dialogues could have been a lot better.  What it comes down to is that there seems to be a problem with... the humor (or lack of it).

Personally, not a big fan of her comedy. Now, Eddie Griffin, Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willard can be quite hilarious but none of that is portrayed in this flop.

Unfortunately, half-way through the film the writer ran out of inspiration and decided to spoof other comedies like ""Meet the Fockers"".  Since ""Meet the Fockers"" is a crazy comedy that doesn't take itself seriously, spoofing it makes no sense and makes it look like the creators of ""Date Movie"" are simply stealing scenes from another film.

This would have been acceptable if the actual storyline for ""Date Movie"" followed the usual date movie progression.  But although some obstacles (mainly a gorgeous former fiancee) block their path to happiness, the movie is mainly just a caricature of date movie (and other film) clichs, with the romance between the two leads completely lacking chemistry and believability.

If the film had been titled differently, then I might not have gone with such high hopes.  A title other than ""Date Movie"" would have better addressed the movie's far-reaching comic content.  On the bright side, there were some very funny, laugh-out-loud moments scattered throughout the otherwise average movie.

From ""Napoleon Dynamite"" to ""Hitch"" to ""Star Wars,"" this Alyson Hannigan vehicle is overloaded with poor references to other films.

It starts out rather bland, with a rather large (think Gwyneth Paltrow from ""Shallow Hal"") and lonely Hannigan looking for Mr. Right.  Her father, played by Eddie Griffin, is determined to find a husband for her, no matter what his station in life is.  Desperate, Hannigan goes to a ""Hitch""-like man (Tony Cox) who helps her drop the pounds and eventually hook-up with a British dude who's just perfect.  Of course, a jealous ex (""My Best Friend's Wedding"") pops onto the scene and tries to steal Hannigan's man.

Supposedly a spoof on romantic comedies, the movie focuses on Meet the Fockers (another stinker), with supporting gags from Hitch, The 40 Year Old Virgin, Bridget Jones' Diary,  Shallow Hal, Wedding Crashers, The Wedding Planner,  Sleepless in Seattle, Pretty Woman, How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days, and When Harry Met Sally, among many, many others.

When it's through with the comedies, it takes on Kill Bill, King Kong, The Lord of the Rings, Napoleon Dynamite, The Bird Cage, Dodgeball, the song Milkshake by Kelis, Candy Shop by 50 Cent, Britney Spears and Kevin Federline, Michael Jackson, The Bachelor, Pimp My Ride, Paris Hilton, Taco Bell, Best Buy, and even Girls Gone Wild.

It would take an expert on pop culture (or a very bored person with a lot of time on their hands) to identify all the parodied and lampooned subjects in this movie, which admittedly has quite a few chuckles, but far too many gross-out scenes are too prolonged to be anything other than mind-blowingly bad moments on film.

Consider this movie a pop-culture quiz and see how you fare, but be warned - you'll need to park your good taste at the door, and we can't be held responsible for its safety.  Enter at your own risk, and may the farce be with you.

Parody's like ""Scary movie"" and ""Not another teen movie"" look like Oscar winning Shakespeare films next to this disaster. Ever since I first saw her on BTVS I have always been a big Alyson Hannigan fan, it is rare to see an actress that can handle both sensitive dramatic scenes AND have a great sense of comic timing, neither of which are evident here, I really would like to see her mix in a few more dramatic roles like she did in ""Beyond the city limits"" (A Very underrated film!!!) but one more horrible disaster like this and the great career boost she got from doing BTVS and the American Pie films will have gone right down the tubes. What was her agent thinking even showing her this project??? Will some director PLEASE save Alyson Hannigan and offer her a great dramatic role to save her career!",1150934400,,896,4.37125748502994
2555266,4,B000F9RLL2,"I love good Satire. The trend that started with the film Airplane , grew into Police Academy and then Scary movie and now into this film Date Movie

I go to these type of movies to see how they can throw in Kill Bill with Shallow Hall and make it work. It steals from all the romantic movies of the last 15 years and makes it FUN. The plotline is thin, but  the plot  are also thin in Airplane and Scary Movie, it is more a slapstick gag fest.

Buffy's Alyson Hannigan is the glue that holds this film together. She seems to have fun with comedy. She does have a flair.  To me, this works. Date Movie is a joke a minute piece...of there is a joke that don't get you, there will be another in a few seconds that will.

If you are going for great story or great cinema-DONT GET THIS ONE. Sophomoric is a great way to describe any of these satires...from Airplane to this. Its a popcorn film for those who love midnight madness movies. I suggest pair  this film with Grandma's Boy (see my review)for a night for entertainment

I think this type of film is like MAD magazine, ITS good for a evening's few laughes and then throw it away

2555268,2,B000F9RLL2,"I had been over-excited to see this film because, once again, I am a huge fan of spoofs and parodies. Unfortunately, the last few poorly done parody films is beginning to dampen my enthusiasm for the genre.

Most people know Alyson Hannigan as Willow from the television show ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", or as that lovable band geek Michelle from the ""American Pie"" series. I'm personally a huge fan of Alyson Hannigan, which is part of why I was so disappointed in this film. I really feel she is capable of so much more, although she did make a valiant effort to save a movie that just couldn't be saved (mostly do to poor writing and shoddy directing/editing)

Many movies and shows are spoofed in ""Date Movie"", among them: Meet the Parents, Meet the Fockers, What Women Want, The Wedding Planner, Napoleon Dynamite, My Best Friend's Wedding, Pimp my Ride, Hitch, Lord of the Rings, Wedding Crashers, Mr & Mrs Smith, Say Anything, The Bachelor, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, and many more.

On the plus side, the unrated version of the film does have a lot of fun special features. However, the special features aren't enough to redeem the film itself, but it helps.

""Date Movie"" is an overall disappointment. The film lacked focus, and tried too hard to cram as many spoofs it could into a short time period. The spoofs didn't flow together very well. Instead, it seemed like it was just one poorly written mini-sketch after another with very little story substance connecting them to each other.

Alyson Hannigan is a terrific actress. I do look forward to seeing what else she has in store, but I'm afraid this one is a bust.",1150502400,3,1628,4.658536585365853

2555280,1,B000F9RLL2,"I went into Date Movie with my head held high. From the commercials, I noticed that 2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie wrote/co-wrote this movie. I don't care if they were deathly ill and writing this movie was their last wish... it should not have been done. Especially since buying a movie ticket these days is alomst ten dollars, what a rip-off. But anyways, I still went in to the movie with my head held high because of my love for the Scary Movie bunch and what I thought would be a good laugh.

Newsbreak, I didn't laugh once. I didn't even smile once. Actually, I take that back, I smiled when it was over. I cringed though, during the spoof of Along Came Polly with the hairball getting entangled into blondies mouth, that was a cringing moment right there, nothing funny about it. I don't even get why they needed writers for this movie, all it was was a bunch of spoofs put together.

The funny thing is, is that they are already spoofing funny movies. It's sort of hard to do a funny spoof on a funny movie...it just dosn't work, you just end up reinacting the scene and looking like a dumbass.

This movie is a poor excuse to waste film. It's unfunny, painfully long, and a bit on the ""want to throw up now please"" side of the movie spectrum of Hollywood.

2555285,2,B000F9RLL2,"From the makers of Scary Movie comes their version of the romantic comedy, ""Date Movie."" Alyson Hannigan plays Julia Jones, an overweight and miserable girl looking for love and a way out of working in her parents' Greek restaurant for the rest of her life.  She goes to see Hitch, a vertically-challenged self-proclaimed ""Date Doctor"" (MD, PhD, DDS and ordained minister), to see if he can help her find love.  Realizing what an utter mess Julia is, Hitch takes her to West Coast Customs to ""pimp her out."" Transformed into a bombshell, Julia signs on for the reality television show, ""The Extreme Bachelor: Desperate Edition.""  She wins the show and winds up engaged to Grant Fockyerdodder. They begin planning their wedding and Julia meets Andy, the best man.  Strangely enough the best man is a woman who comes out of the pool like Bo Derek in 10 and spends the duration of the film oiled up like a Thanksgiving turkey.  Julia learns Andy and Grant used to be engaged and that Andy wants a second chance with him.  The rest of the movie is a series of even more spoofs designed to make fun of most of the romantic comedies made in the last 10 years.  The highlight, for me, was the montage at the end of the movie where Julia and Grant almost break up then get back together with Journey's ""Open Arms"" playing in the background.  Classic.

Just in case you might have missed a few here are the movies etc. they spoofed that I recognized: My Best Friend's Wedding, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Pimp my Ride, the Paris Hilton Carl's Jr. commercial, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, What Women Want, Jerry Maguire, Pretty Woman, Along Came Polly, The Wedding Planner, Napoleon Dynamite, Bridget Jones' Diary, As Good as it Gets, Notting Hill, Legally Blonde, When Harry Met Sally, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Mean Girls, Say Anything, Kill Bill, Dodgeball, Sweet Home Alabama, King Kong, Meet the Fockers, There's Something About Mary, Hitch, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, and probably a few others that I missed.

I think you know what to expect when you rent a movie like this.  It's not supposed to be Oscar-worthy, so there's no reason to judge it as such.  It's toilet humor, over the top, and at times unnecessarily crass.  That being said, so is Scary Movie and I wouldn't expect the writers to deviate from type.  I didn't expect much from this film, so I wasn't disappointed.  It also featured ""cameos"" from Michael Jackson, Britney Spears and Kevin Federline, and Lil John.  The movie was good for a couple of laughs, but don't go into it with high expectations.

2555298,3,B000F9RLL2,"...as long as you know what you are getting into. Don't expect a thought-provoking or high-brow comedy: there is none of that here. Date Movie is a comedy in the absurdist vein. Many people incorrectly label this type of humor 'bathroom humor' or something equally insulting. In fact, absurdist humor can lead to some of the biggest laughs you will experience in cinema (Airplane!). Of course, there are bad absurdist comedies out there, just like every other genre of film. Date Movie is not bad at all, but it is nowhere even close to being in the league of Airplane!. Overall, Date Movie is a fun (but rather forgettable) little movie that will make you laugh at least several times. The comedic pacing is uneven, and a lot of the jokes fall flat, but there are enough funny ones in there to make viewing Date Movie a fairly pleasurable experience. If you enjoyed Airplane and Scary Movie, it is almost assured you will appreciate Date Movie.

One more thing: as usual, the 'Unrated' edition is nothing more than a MARKETING PLOY. There is NOTHING in the unrated edition that would even equate to an 'R' rating (NO nudity, very little swearing), much less an NC-17 (the very rating that the word 'unrated' conjures up in most people's minds).",1149638400,4,1245,4.7110091743119265
2555299,2,B000F9RLL2,"I checked out ""Date Movie"" because it stars Alyson Hannigan.  For years when I touted ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" as the best show on television people told me it must be because I thought Sarah Michelle Gellar was hot.  I always said she was okay, but the one I liked was Alyson Hannigan as Willow because she was smart, cute and funny, a rare combination (for example, Tina Fey is on the short list).  Her limited success in movies is based on what happened in ""American Pie,"" where she had the funniest two lines, the second of which (""Same my name...""), was an ad-lib.  Hannigan has been the female lead in a movie that opened #1 at the box office (""American Wedding""), but while she has found another good television role as Lily on ""How I Met Your Mother,"" her movie career is floundering.  Her next gig is voice work for the mocumentary ""Farce of the Penguins,"" which actually might be a step up given her first leading role in ""Date Movie.""

I compare ""Date Movie"" to ""Airplane!"", the film that remains the standard by all such kitchen sink comedies need to be judged, and the obvious difference is that with ""Airplane!"" just knowing the genre is enough to get all of the jokes in the movie.  But with ""Date Movie,"" like with the ""Scary Movie"" franchise, you really need to have seen all of the movies it is parodizing.  We start off with Hannigan in a fat suit (""Shallow Hall""), keeping up with her diary (""Bridget Jones's Diary""), standing on a subway grate (""The Seven Year Itch""), working in her family restaurant (""My Big Fat Greek Wedding""), and going to see a matchmaker (""Hitch"").  She then meets the man of her dreams on a TV reality show (""The Bachelor""), eat at A Restaurant (""When Harry Met Sally""), and since his last name turns out to be Funkyerdoder the primary template for this movie ends up being ""Meet the Fockers.""  Somehow, making a sequel the template strikes me as a major mistake, even if one of the few times I actually laughed (mom in the urn on the mantle), came in this segment.  But if you did not really find a movie that was supposed to be a comedy all that funny, then trying to do a parody of it is just not worth the effort.

The movie also works in ""My Best Friend's Wedding,"" ""Pretty Woman,"" ""Kill Bill: Volume 1,"" ""Kill Bill: Volume 2,"" ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,"" ""American Pie,"" ""Say Anything,"" ""Jerry Maguire,"" ""Notting Hill,"" ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,"" ""What Women Want,"" ""The Wedding Planner,"" ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story,"" ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith,"" ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,"" ""Wedding Crashers,"" ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" ""The 40-Year Old Virgin,"" ""Girls Gone Wild,"" and ""King Kong"" make it into the mix as well.  I think they took on ""Grey's Anatomy"" as well, but I might be wrong.  Consequently, you do not really have a movie that is a comic twist on a romantic comedy, but more something that demands  you ""Name That Film"" for your viewing pleasure rather than actually enjoying the humor.  As we all know, the movie was made by two of the six writers of the ""Scary Movie"" movies, Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, and the nicest thing to say would be that the other four writers can proudly point to NOT having worked on ""Date Movie"" when they cover their resumes in job interviews.  If the amount of time devoted to a joke is an indication of what these two guys think is funny, then the comedic highpoint of their film has to be the cat going to the bathroom.  However, I would hope most viewers would not consider that the funniest scene in the film.

The fault does not lie with the cast, although the script does not take advantage of Hannigan's comedic talents anywhere near what it should.  Tony Cox as mini-Hitch steals most of his scenes and Sophie Monk as Andy milks her scenes for what they are worthy.  But Eddie Griffin and Fred Willard as the fathers of the couple are basically treading water and Adam Campbell as Grant Funkyerdoder creates no chemistry whatsoever with our heroine.  I was almost tempted to round up on this film because of all of the DVD extras.  There are a dozen deleted, extended and alternate scenes (i.e., evidence the film could have been even worse). Andy's poolside extended dailies, audition tapes, and a FOX Movie Channel featurette on ""Making a Spoof.""  You also get three commentary tracks: the first by Seltzer and Friedberg; the second with Hannigan, Campbell, Monk, and Cox; and the third an ""Anti-Commentary"" by critics Scott Foundas and Bob Strauss.  That last one almost tipped the scales, but then there is ""The Quickie,"" which does the entire film in six minutes.  The fact that version made it almost tolerable really hit me as adding insult to injury, and when you add optional laugh track you have a tacit admission that the film needs it without the explicit apology for putting us (and Hannigan) through something so lame.",1149552000,6,4906,4.603903559127439

Don't let the movie's poster mislead you to think that the Napoleon Dynamite and Owen Wilson, and JLo characters are the plots of the film. These characters are mere cameos and they simply made fun of their physical behaviors and body parts. No JLo fans would want to see that sort of thing on film. The opening dance number rendered by the over-sized ""Julia Jones"" character is nothing funny and it's just purely insulting to the Zellwegger movie and overweight people.

2555302,2,B000F9RLL2,"I'm all for a good laugh. I'm all for a fun parody. The classics began with the Zucker brothers and their classics with The Naked Gun and Airplane movies. The best. The Scary Movie franchises rolled in and became the top gun. I like those ones, although with decreasing interest with each installment. Now we get this one. Obviously, the romantic comedy/date movie was ripe for it's own send up, but this one isn't it. The movie has being plugged as from being by ""2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie"". After watching the movie, it was all too apparent that they needed the other 4 writers. There was only one part in the entire movie(and the end credits kicked in at the 72 minute mark)that made me laugh. I am not proud of it, but I will get to that later. So, what do we have here?. A misguided and mostly unfunny affair that's only sole saving grace is the presence of the undeniably charming and adorable Alyson Hannigan. She plays Julia Jones, a rather repulsive girl on the ""quite heavy"" side. She is love lorn and looking for the right guy. It's not happening. She meets up with a love doctor named Hitch(played by Tony Cox), who transforms her into a beauty and helps her get onto a Bachelor type show where she meets her Prince Charming. The rest is  basically scenes taped together with not much of a story. Oh, of course, I forgot. He has an ex that wants him back. Yada yada. The movie has a more than adequate cast. Fred Willard and Jennifer Coolidge, who I adore, both pop in and make the most of their roles, which spoof those of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand in ""Meet The Fockers"". Oh, did I mention Prince Charming's name?. Never mind. It's too obvious. Elsewhere, Eddie Griffin plays Hannigan's dad(don't ask), and Mad TV alumni Josh Meyers pops in twice as Owen Wilson and Napoleon Dynamite. A few of the movies they spoof either don't fit, or seem too over-dated to carry much weight for anyone to really care. Other times the jokes and spoofs come and feel so unconnected and pointless with everything else that's going on. That's not fun or funny. It's just annoying. What was spoofed here?. Meet The Fockers, Kill Bill, The Lord Of The Rings, King Kong, Napoleon Dynamite, My Best Friend's Wedding, and so on. So, what about that one part that made me laugh?. Well, not surprisingly, it's bathroom humor at the lowest level. It's spoofing the cat Jinx from the Meet The Parents movies, and how the De Niro character trained him to use a toilet. Uh huh. I think you know where this is going. The cat is walked in on during a rather strenuous trip to the latrine. I laughed. I'll admit it, but shamefully. There is still something about that kind of low brow humor that draws a chuckle(or a hearty laugh). Something like that will still have a place in us. As Rogert Ebert once said, ""May I never lose it"". This scene pretty much tells you everything about the movie when the funniest part is an animatronic cat having a major bowel movement on the can.",1149379200,3,2979,4.476102941176471

2555305,1,B000F9RLL2,"Years ago, David & Jerry Zucker came on the scene and gave us such classics as Kentucky Fried Movie, Airplane, Top Secret, Scary Movie 3 & Naked Gun. Many have tried and failed miserably to copy their formula. Movies with low concept and many off-the-wall side stories that may or may not have anything to do with that concept. Jokes flying around like a whirlwind. Never knowing what tangent their going to go off on next.

In my mind, there has only been one successful duplication of the Zucker comedy niche, possibly 2. I'm GONNA GET YOU SUCKA! and the first 2 SCARY MOVIEs. Both by the Wayans brothers.

All of these movies, especially those by the Zucker's are masters at setup & execution. There's a method to the madness. There's a reason for the joke, and the performers are just as surprised as we are.

DATE MOVIE on the other hand, is so bad, it's shocking. How does this movie EVEN GET MADE? WHO THOUGHT THIS WAS FUNNY? What Executive read this script and gave this thing the green light anyway!

The movie, has LITTLE TO NO EXECUTION whatsoever! Imitation alone is not funny. Yet that is what you get with DATE MOVIE. One movie imitation after another. No set up. No reason. Just here's a reference... and here's another etc. etc. etc.

For example, in a reference to HITCH, little person, Tony Cox takes Julia (Alyson Hannigan) to make her over and make her DATEABLE... so he takes her to a shop chop in a reference to MTV's PIMP MY RIDE, where they hammer away and when their done, they raise her up in a DARTH VADER suit and a five second shot of Tony is used painted up like YODA. END OF SCENE.

This is pretty much how the entire film goes. One lame reference after another. A guy imitates NAPOLEON DYNAMITE. So? Hobbits pawn the ring and kick a lame looking wizard in the nuts. Michael Jackson is seen in an alley trying to get a young boy to come home with him. Frankly, the real life Michael Jackson is funny enough. A goof ball with a horribly constructed fake nose shows up as the wedding is getting over and yells, ""Hey is there a wedding to crash?""

2555317,1,B000F9RLL2,"Okay, I am always open to fine parody. I was raised on MAD magazine and saw ""Airplane"" back in the day. If it is funny, then it is good, when it comes to parody.

Trouble is, ""Date Movie"" isn't funny.

I think Alyson Hannigan's performance was good, as were the performances by Eddie Griffin and the others. Acting cannot compensate for poor script writing and a movie whose humor is not even sophisticated enough for an eighteen year old!

I am glad that the movie didn't include any actual nudity (even the ""UNRATED"" version --- which must have included some extra curse words that the theater version did not). By being free of nudity, one can envision that the writers may have been targeting the eight to ten year old crowd with this movie. (This thought occurred to me as an unbearable scene of a cat on a toilet making rude noises while defecating seemed to drag on for what seemed like ten or fifteen squirmingly uncomfortable minutes.)

  If, in fact, the movie was meant for eight-to-ten-year-olds, the producers may want to advertise as such and not include pop culture references to movies such as ""My Best Friend's Wedding"", which may have been too long ago to have been a shared experience with the intended audience.

  I really do yearn for a funny, smart parody of the biggest movies. After seeing ""Date Movie"", I continue to yearn, but I now may shy away from anything like this in the future.",1149292800,3,1411,4.612

Two main problems:

1--a parody was thrown in that had NOTHING to do with the style of movie (ex:Kill Bill)

2--a parody which was ""date"" movie related was put in just for the sake of adding something in without working it in the proper way becasue the writers couldn't think of an idea or were jsut plain lazy

It's kind of hard for me to word, but hopefully people will get what I'm saying and spend their money elsewhere ...the only positive thing is this movie was short (1 hour and 13 minutes), and I really couldn't wait for it to end",1149206400,3,799,4.122580645161291
2555322,3,B000F9RLL2,"Fox has just released the brand new DVD transfer Of ""Date Movie"", a quick, witty, wild spoof of romantic-comedy movies(and maybe, almost everything else).  The movie is short.  If you watched them all, the DVD extras actually last longer.  ""Date Movie"" is the story of Julia Jones(Alyson Hannigan, who is brilliant), an over-weight young waitress.  With the help of a love-muse(?), she is able to re-invent herself and lose the pounds. She meets a handsome Englishman, Grant, and love is in the air.  But now she has to deal with their families' incompatibility, and Grant's sexy old girlfriend.  ""Date Movie"" shamelessly parodies ""King Kong"", ""Star Wars"", ""Meet the Parents"", ""Kill Bill"", and even TV commercials. Then it takes shots at Britney Spears, Jalo, Michael Jackson, Barbara Streisand, and more.  Funny stuff(the Jackson spoof is hysterical).  ""Date Movie"" features Tony Cox(from ""Bad Santa""), Fred Willard, and a partially-clothed Carmen Electra. ""Date Movie"" is available in two versions, a rated edition(82 minutes), and an unrated version(85 minutes).  The disc has an animated anamorphic widescreen main menu, allowing access to the special features.  The quality of the transfer is spotty.  Some scenes are crisp in detail, with vivid color, but others are soft and dull. A real positive is the generous boat-load of extras.  You get three different feature-length audio commentaries. Featurettes include ""On Dating"", with the cast, ""The Quickie"", a six-and-a-half minute movie synopsis, with scenes sped-up and slowed-down. You also get twelve deleted, extended, or alternate scenes. The editor was wise to cut them.  A ""Gag Reel"" has a snicker or two. And the inter-active ""Andy's Cherry Stem Surprise"" is well...(Dont's go there).  Then there is an 18-minute Fox Movie Channel Spoof of Peter Jackson failing to direct ""King Kong"". The disc ends with three trailers, the international trailer, a soundtrack commercial, and five ""internet clips"".  This is a funny, irreverant film. It doesn't all work, but you can't get too bored in an hour-and-ten minutes.  The cat-on-the-toilet sequence is worth the ticket price alone. The extras mention the Fox Legal Dept. editing out portions of the final DVD product.  When I saw ""Date Movie"" in the theater, I seem to remember a Paris Hilton spoof, but in this DVD, the heiress is not to be found.",1149206400,4,2357,5.226063829787234
2555323,1,B000F9RLL2,"As far as spoofs go, this one is the absolute worst.  It's no wonder that it was released in theaters in February and not during the holiday or summer seasons.  This movie is not funny because it is simply lazy.  It offers up pop cultural references but does not do anything remotely funny with them.  It's as if the writers assumed that audiences would be so amused to recognize a reference that anything beyond the reference would be superfluous.  As such, we are treated to ""parodies"" of Pretty Woman, My Best Friend's Wedding, My Big Fat Greek Wedding et al, that go nowhere fast (literally, the movie is less than 90 minutes).  Some parts of the movie are downright offensive.  There is a scene early in the movie where the main characters, on a date, beat up a homeless person for no reason.  Given recent stories in the news of homeless people being viciously attacked and killed, this scene was completely inappropriate and pretty much soured me on the film.  In another review posted here, a reviewer indicated that people were walking out of the theater when he saw it.  I'm not surprised.",1149120000,3,1099,4.647668393782383
2555324,2,B000F9RLL2,"Comic spoofs of famous movies have been around for ages. Movies like ""Hotshots"", ""Naked Gun"", ""Space Balls"" and ""Scary Movie"" have always had their own place in the world of comic films based on popular Blockbusters.

Their equation was simple, take a pulp classic, and ridicule it making obvious relations to the real movie in comedic forms. The audience could say laugh and comment "" haha I remember that scene from Top Gun!"". What was important about this genre was the possibility of sequels since popular movies would keep rolling with the times. We get movies with the likes of ""Scary Movie 2"" and ""Naked Gun 1&3/4"". A constant stream of ideas to harass.

But it seems like Date Movie is going to be the end of a long glorious genre. As we continue to ridicule we begin to realize how many jokes are simply being replayed. Extended to fill space. Seeing a cat pass gas for about 5 seconds may be funny. Having it assume a different position may be humorous. When we watch the cat fart for 2 minutes without stop we stop to wonder. What caused any director to force a scene on for such a long time? On such a crude joke.

The movie itself feels like a series of filler scenes complimented with the good laugh every now and then. On a professional point it looks like a director that had some vision but could not follow through with it into his movie. Some scenes appeared rushed and many jokes were not even integrated and were simply random references in the middle of the movie to other movies.

Sometimes you will get a worthwhile laugh.

I hope that resulting failure of this movie lies with the director. If not...

It may be that spoofs themselves are losing their comic value. And this is my personal belief. As much as I hope I am wrong, my gut feeling tells me that like all the other movies, usually the first was the best.",1149120000,2,1839,4.458333333333333

I started watching Date Movie, and had to come back to it, but then decided that once I began watching it again for the 2nd time, I could take some notes!!! Here is a little list I've come up with, that may in fact answer some questions out there! Here are the definite movies used with stars, and the ones without a star* (I'm just guessing) But I have a ton of movies like 4-5K titles:

2000-2006 references:

bridget jones diary*

napolean dynamite*

my best friend's wedding* (1995)

jerry maguire* (mid to late 1990's)

my big fat greek wedding*

meet the parents* (late 1990's to 2005)

meet the fockers*

hitch*

blackberry (software development)*

the 'Trio 650' handheld (portable)*

50 cent's 'candy shop'*

what women want* (starring mel gibson---love this part!!!!)(very late 1990's like 1998 or 1999)

britney spears* (-and kevin federline-) (-eew-)

kill bill*

I'm not sure on these, but I really have faith that they're somewhat accurate, here's a few movie titles/themes/TV Shows, etc.... that I think were referenced in 'Date Movie':

Anger Management (maybe with the food all over the place on her)

The Sweetest Thing (and it was almost confirmed when I saw the pastor)

maybe the waitress theme from 'It Could Happen to You'

high fidelity (the song I was told)

the movie that people cracked the mirror in- perhaps the Grudge'

you got served (I was told)

pam anderson (HC)

monster-in-law

little black book (I know I'm pretty sure on this one, but can't remember exactly)

the guru (perhaps)

the price is right (music)

extreme makeover (mixed with the bachelor, perfect idea)

nip/tuck (it has to be, I mean come on)(with the whole mayonnaise container-that is so nip/tuck!)

the mask (when they unmask her)

sex and the city (charlotte got her face licked, I know that's for sure)

pimp my ride (definitely!!!)(and with the garage doing alyson hannigan's whole get-up, I'm positive)

are we there yet? (the way the hitch character is dressed)(also the spinning rims on the SUV, come on)

cast away (I'm pretty sure?)(anyone?)

uptown girls (square staircase perhaps)

there's something about mary/duplex (perhaps a little of each? for the older neigbor woman scenes)

raising helen (maybe a little influence with the Indian actress and the sperm sample)

well that's what I think and for all those people out there who think the themes are so dated, GUESS AGAIN",1149033600,4,3069,4.909803921568628
2555326,1,B000F9RLL2,"I saw this movie in the theatre and thought it was pretty bad, save for the toilet using cat (hey, that's as lowbrow as it gets, but try not to laugh).  The ""Hitch"" thing was funny initially and I also enjoyed the absurdity of the ""Kill Bill"" spoof and Paris Hilton's burger commercial.  Those three or four moments earn this flick its one star; everything else is either predictable and unfunny (or predictably unfunny) or far worse.  The theatre was mostly silent during the whole affair (I counted two couples who walked out).  I was often the only one who could be heard laughing and I'm saying I thought the movie sucked (I guess I got more of the movie references than the rest of the people there, that's not to say they were actually all that funny, but I had to find something to laugh at).  It seemed to get worse, less funny, run out of ideas and get more random and tedious as it went along.  The last 15 to 20 minutes is a dreadful hodgepodge of random, lame ideas; and, while the movie is rather short, I was squirming and checking my watch about halfway through.

Maybe this would play better at home and with lowered expectations (not that mine were all that high; these movie-spoofs have been pretty week the last few years).  My theory is these are now being made for a less discriminating and younger audience.  As with the new ""Scary Movie,"" er, movie, all the ""this is the funniest movie I've ever seen"" reviews here at Amazon are coming from a bunch of kids.  Now, I'm not that old myself, but the generation gap between generations X and Y is truly bigger than I ever imagined.  If you're between 10 and 17 this might be for you.  Those of us around long enough to see and appreciate truly great spoof movies will think this film verges on sacrilege.  Leslie Nielson and the Zuckers would be rolling over in their graves, had they died 5 years ago.

Normally I would never say I would consider watching such a lousy movie again, but as always happens I am intrigued when the ""Unrated Version"" is released.  Usually DVDs that slap ""Unrated"" across the box actually include very few actual ""unrated""-worthy scenes.  Unless a movie as already rather raunchy, that ""Unrated"" is just used as a marketing tool and you never can tell what is really different about the new version.  ""Date Movie"" has a fare amount of lite-raunch, so the potential is there that some heavier stuff was left on the cutting room floor.  Until I see a few reviews saying this is indeed the case I'm not gonna risk it.  You may at your own risk, then let me know.  C'mon guys, lets see some reviews that compare the two.

Till then, rent this version at your own risk.",1149033600,2,2662,4.458677685950414
2555327,3,B000F9RLL2,"I thought that my taste was pretty low, but seeing all the other reviews, I have to say, I'm convinced now!  My movie taste is way down there in the gutter!  I thoughte this was the most halarious movie I've seen all week!  Okay, I haven't seen a lot of comedies this week, but it was rather funny in my opinion.

I think part of the confusion on my part, is that I knew full well what I was getting myself into, when I rented it.  Did the other reviewers based them from viewing the DVD, or watching it in the theaters?  If it was the latter, you should reveal this disclaimer in your review.  There is a place online to review the theatrical release.  I notices several folks ""revealed"" almost leaving the theater, but did not express it as a review of the theatrical release in the text of their review.

I absolutely loved the intro of this movie.  My wife and I were rolling around in tears, laughing so hard. And my wife is much classier than I am.  But we were rolling.  Trust me.  When the street worker shoots a nail into his own head, I was almost dying in laughter.  And the male-on-male belly bashing was just halarious.  The kind of thing you'd see in any ""Scary Movie"" sequel.

Okay, the story.  Yeah, I'll give you that the storyline left a lot to be desired.  I was very confused many times in the movie.  But I'll tell you what.  I really don't care. I don't watch those types of movies for any kind of storyline. I expect lots of ""choppy"" and interconnected movie parody storylines.  In fact, I actually enjoy trying to guess what movie they are parodying.  By the way, what movie (the one with Tom Hanks) are the making fun of when the female lead has to meet the male lead at the Empire State Building?  I can't quite remember the name.  I saw it though, (""Hated it!!!"") and remember that part of the story.

All in all, 3 stars, I'm a tough reviewer, mainly because of the shakiness of the storyline.  If they had managed to get a story into that halariously funny spoof, it would have gotten at least 4 stars.

If that option is even available after doing this, she'll probably be some jack-azz'd host on some lame reality TV show on WB at like 3:30 on Saturday afternoon's from now on, course she'd be lucky even to get that.  I usually like the ""stupid funny"" parody movies like such greats as ""Airplane"", ""Naked Gun"", ""Scary Movie""(only the first one, they've progressively gotten worse with each sequal).  Date Movie falls absolutely flat on it's face, the whole movie is one big train wreck, nothing works.  These 2 supposed writers from ""Scary Movie"" have absolutely failed & need to not write a script for a movie ever, Ever, EVER again, they obviously don't know comedy.  If you've seen the trailer for the movie you've literally seen the funniest bits from the entire movie(no joke).

Where there any writers involve in this? They just throw parts of other movies randomly and they didn't even try to make it funny.

I really can't explain what's happening lately with all these Teen Comedies coming out from Hollywood, hardly any of them are worth watching.

2555334,1,B000F9RLL2,"I went into this movie hoping for the same humor and magic that made the Scary Movies so popular and hilarious, but it's nowhere to be seen.

I know it's been said repeatedly, but it has to be said, the two writers of Scary Movie that made Date Movie were probably the worst of the six.

It tries, like the Scary Movie franchise, to set up parodies of romantic comedies, such as Hitch, Meet The Fockers and Pretty Woman, and while some of the gags work because they're just disturbing (the boyfriend dressed like Julia Roberts as a hooker in Pretty Woman, and the cat in the bathroom from Meet the Fockers), most of the time it misses the mark and isn't remotely funny.

The only thing that makes this movie barely tolerable to sit through is Alyson Hannigan (who was great in the American Pie movies), who does the best she can with the material.

But as tolerable as she makes the movie, she's not Anna Faris, which is probably the only one who can pull off these types of movies successfully.

I was hoping for a romantic comedy spoof equivalent of Scary Movie, but let's face it, it completely fails.  Let's just stick to Anna Faris and Regina Hall in the Scary Movie franchise.

Like fellow reviewers here have said, to simply take the plot from a movie and exagerate it does not equal parody.  There is nothing subtle about this film, at all.  The only humorous parts of the film are seen in the trailers. The majority of everything else can be skipped.

If you're expecting the so-called ""unrated"" edition to fill in the missing pieces and hope that it makes the film better, be warned.  Whenever a PG-13 film becomes unrated, it normally means there were maybe one scene, one instance or so that caused it to touch the R rating and so that one scene, joke, word, or what have you was taken out.  Still standing at around 85 minutes, this film won't be changed much.  And, really, that's one minute more of your life wasted.

2555353,1,B000F9RLL2,If I could have given this movie 0 stars i would have. It was one of the worst movies i have ever seen. I almost got up after 20 min and left to go demand my money back. It was not funny at all. Watching QVC for 80 min will be a better use of your time then going to see this movie. If you really want to see it then rent it when it comes out on DVD because i assure you seeing this movie one time was to many times so buying it on DVD will be a waste of money.,1141948800,,461,3.4854368932038833
2555354,3,B000F9RLL2,"""Date Movie"" is from two of the six writers of ""Scary Movie"", and is a spoof of romantic comedies.  Apparently, they chose two of the worst writers from ""Scary Movie"", because the movie falls flat more often than it works.  Alyson Hannigan is Julia Jones, the fat girl looking for Mr. Right.  Hannigan deserves a better role -- she can be funny, but the material she has to work with is less than stellar.  She does what she can, but it is not enough to make ""Date Movie"" work.  The supporting cast of Adam Campbell (the boyfriend), Eddie Griffin (the dad), and Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willard (the boyfriend's parents do not add much to the film either.  ""Date Movie"" does manage to be pretty gross at times for a PG-13 movie, but that is not really a selling point either.  This will be enjoyed by some, but only mildly.  It is not awful, but it is far from great.  Wait for the DVD if you must see it.",1141776000,19,907,4.319526627218935
