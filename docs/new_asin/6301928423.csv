380877,2,6301928423,"This transfer does appear to be a boot, probably sourced from the old HBO Video VHS release from back in the 1980's.  It's watchable if you have a high tolerance for a full-frame, multi-generational image.  True fans of this Claudia Jennings classic will want to wait for the official DVD release from Shout! Factory, which is due sometime in 2013 (date TBA).  The film is an excellent portrayal of an ""outlaw"" Roller Derby league, with Claudia Jennings playing a tough-as-nails female skater who never quite follows ""the game plan.""

This version does not have the original rock and roll songs, which were replaced by a Kendall Schmidt synthesizer score.

UPDATE: UNHOLY ROLLERS will be part of a DVD four-pack entitled CULT MOVIE MARATHON VOL. ONE, which has an Amazon street date of December 10, 2013.  The aspect ratio is the correct 1:85-1.  This is a two-disc set with two films on each disc.  UNHOLY ROLLERS has had some footage restored featuring the bar band Louie and the Rockets, who performed the songs in the original theatrical version (the songs are still missing, sadly).",1360108800,9,1087,4.901639344262295

380879,3,6301928423,"A Roger Corman production, Unholy Rollers (1972) takes a fun behind the scenes look at the world of roller derby, following the adventures of an unknown skater, who finds some success.  Released around the same time as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kansas-City-Bomber/dp/B0007TKNJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kansas City Bomber</a>&nbsp;(1972), another movie about the then popular ""sport"" of roller derby, Unholy Rollers attempts to capture some of the atmosphere and spirit of the game, as part athletic endeavor, and part entertainment.

A fan of roller derby, Karen Walker (Claudia Jennings) quits her job, and after a tryout, earns a spot on the Los Angeles Avengers team.  Tough, sexy, and with a flair for playing to the audience, Walker is given a chance to become the featured player, by the owner of the team (Louis Quinn).  Karen makes the most of the opportunity, creating a rivalry with Mickey Martinez (Betty Anne Rees), the team's current star player, and causing friction with some of her teammates.

With talent, determination, and a definite wild streak, Karen finds some success, hammering down opponents, jamming past her teammates, while also starting a romance with Nick (Jay Varela) who also skates for the Avengers.  Eventually Karen does become the star, causing Mickey to be traded to another team.  It's war on the track, when the two rivals square off as opponents for the first time, and the results are not pretty, as an overconfident and unpopular Karen, begins to slip over the edge, before losing it completely, as a riot breaks out at the arena.

Unholy Rollers may be mostly superficial, crude in places, and with more than a few rough spots, but the film is entertaining, and has a certain sleazy charm.  With a particular view of the sport, and some of the colorful characters involved in it, the film displays some humor when dealing with some of the sleazy elements, and a sense of style regarding nudity, such as an incident in a pool hall, and a romantic scene in a roller arena.  The action scenes are shot reasonably well, with some contributions from a young Martin Scorsese.  Having announcers commenting over the action taking place on the track is a nice touch, that adds color, camp, insight, and a lot of fun.

The acting won't win any awards, but overall it's a cut above what you might expect in a low budget exploitation flick.

380882,5,6301928423,"Unholy Rollers is an action-packed drama, spotlighting the sport of Roller Derby. When this film was released in 1972, Roller Derby was at the zenith of it's popularity with the public.

Be forewarned, this definitely doesn't qualify as a P.C. movie, by any means. Like most B movies from the 70s, it's chocked full of stereotypical characters; lecherous male chauvinist pigs, dumb blond women, a lust-crazed lesbian, negligent store clerks, etc.

The film has B movie queen Claudia Jennings in the starring role, as Karen Walker. Karen is a gorgeous, buxom young woman, working at a dull job in a cat food cannery. For fun, Karen loves going to see her favorite local Roller Derby team, the LA Avengers.

Meanwhile, Karen gets tired of fending-off the unwanted sexual harassment, of her sleazy supervisor. Fed-up, she throws a can of cat food in his face, then quits in disgust. Without any other job prospects lined-up, Karen decides to try out for the LA Avengers team.

Karen makes the team, then reports to the team doctor, for her physical. The doctor turns-out to be mainly interested in ogling Karen's bod, after she strips-down to her undies for the physical. The doc gives Karen a clean bill-of-health. She then gets her Avenger uniform, and reports to the rink for her first game.

Karen gets off to a rip-roaring start, during her first game as an Avenger. She displays lots of colorful showmanship. The team Owner, Mr. Stern, likes Karen's skating style. In the locker room after the game though, Karen's teammates caution her to skate according to the team rules.

The Avenger's star skater, Mickey Martinez, gleefully teases Karen about her skirt that she wears. Mickey eggs-on the others, including the team's coach, to join in. Karen takes offense. But she's told by another teammate, Jennifer, not to take it seriously. Jennifer then invites Karen to join the rest of the team, for drinks at a local seedy bar. Wanting to be accepted by the others, Karen goes along.

Once at the bar, Karen is approached by Mickey again. Mickey is the lesbian character, and she makes amorous advances towards Karen. Karen gets belligerent with Mickey, telling Mickey to get lost. Feeling insulted, Mickey wants to 'teach Karen a lesson'. So, Mickey and some of the other Avengers, pin Karen to a pool table, tearing off all of her clothes. Naked and furious, Karen gives them all a brutal tongue-lashing. Especially Mickey, who she vows to get even with.

With vengeance, and a thirst for fame driving her, Karen quickly rises to the top of the Avengers team roster. Karen even beats Mickey's scoring record, eclipsing Mickey to become the Avenger's new number one skater. But fame and glory go to Karen's head. She refuses to be a team player, or follow orders by the team's Owner. Soon, Karen is headed for a fall. And she learns the hard way that, star or not, she's as expendable as any other skater in the league.

This film is jam-packed with lots of flashy skating footage, ribald humor, violent fights on the track, and an overall sense of raunchy debauchery. The bitter rivalry between Karen and Mickey, is the meatiest plot-line in the film. There's just not much else about the movie, that holds the viewer's interest.

Claudia Jennings performance as Karen Walker, is brilliant. Claudia had a wholesome, all-American cheerleader kind of beauty. Yet she manages to make the violent, ruffian qualities of Karen Walker completely believable.

Betty Anne Rees, was the perfect choice to play Karen's nemesis, Mickey Martinez. Betty was born with the face of a villain. It has lots of severe, razor-sharp angles, and looks like an abscessed tooth feels-painfully evil.

Unholy rollers is wild roller-coaster ride, through the rough-and-tumble world of 70s Roller Derby. It's destined to go down in history, as one of the biggest cult B movies, of all time. It's a must-see, for any 70s B movie fan.",1257033600,4,3908,4.895612708018154

380884,5,6301928423,"Ladies and gentlemen, this is one of the shiniest forgotten gems of 1970s cinema.  Released as Roger Corman's attempt to beat Kansas City Bomber (that other Roller Derby movie starring Raquel Welch) to the theaters to capitalize on the sport's peak in popularity, Unholy Rollers is unfortunately the less-remembered of the two.  Not to say that it didn't get its fair share of praise at the time - a review in Film Comment, that venerable academic film journal, called it ""THE hardboiled film of the year.""
And hardboiled it was, thanks to a singularly ballsy performance by the late, great Claudia Jennings as a complex and dissatisfied rookie Roller Derby star.  A recent screening of the film at the American Cinematheque in Hollywood had the audience hooting, cheering and stomping their feet at each of Jennings' many bursts of fiery anger.  But, her fever-pitched delivery of both elbow and verbal jabs alike, lays like a filmy veil over a spectacularly nuanced portrayal of blue-collar ennui and disappointment.  When critics site the 1970s as a decade devoid of powerful roles for women, this film proves that they never went to the drive-in, because it doesn't get much better than this.  All this with a total lack of self-importance, and a healthy dose of fun (not to mention editing by a young Martin Scorsese).
Unholy Rollers is in desperate need of a revival.  It is the stuff that midnight screenings are made of, a cult film without a cult.  Watch it once, and you'll want to show it to everyone you know.  You'll be quoting it for the rest of your life.",1064448000,18,1570,4.785185185185185
380982,2,6301928423,This film makes the Roller Derby and all those associated with it look bad.  Full of nastiness and bitterness; features the dregs of society and unfairly attaches them to the Roller Derby.  Makes no sense with it's unrealistic depiction of the characters.

380984,5,6301928423,"From the dank sub-sub-basement of athletic entertainment, somewhere beneath 1970's ""Big Time Wrestling"", came the sweaty phenomenon known as roller derby. Combining elements of wrestling, roller boogie, and Australian football, this ""sport"" barely made a blip on the radar screen of life. However, it did have its own, particular audience, including a then 9 yo yours truly, tuning in every Saturday evening to watch our riotous wheel-ers' raucous rampage! Especially entertaining were the females of the game, as their violent behavior was quite shocking for the era. In 1972, ever vigilant for the next $1.98 exploitation vehicle, producer Roger Corman made THE UNHOLY ROLLERS for his hordes of drive-in theater patrons. Starring the blazing-hot Claudia Jennings as Karen Walker, ROLLERS excels at recreating the cheeezy, white-trash goodness of actual roller derby competition. Karen quits her job at a cat food factory and tries out for THE AVENGERS RD team. Not surprisingly, she is signed up immediately. Horrible rock and roll, nudity, and mayhem ensue. It's important to remember that this movie is NOT a Greek tragedy, so don't expect anything other than painful dialogue, heinous ""acting"", and general idiocy. Claudia Jennings Lovers fear not. She's never off-screen for long!  While nowhere near as exciting as ROLLERBALL, nor as dramatic as THE KANSAS CITY BOMBER, THE UNHOLY ROLLERS does capture a low-rent spectacle in all of its half-wit glory!

380988,3,6301928423,"Unholy Rollers starring the late Playmate, Claudia Jennings definitely shows its age.  Released in 1973, I remember seeing it in the drive ins.  It shows some resemblance to the much much better Kansas City Bomber.  Karen played by Claudia Jennings is a brash rookie joining The Avengers.  Ambitious, she's seen as an interloper by her team.  Her antics make you cringe at times with her burning bridges, making more enemies than friends on and off the track.  And tempers really flair as she faces past teammates and worse a new rookie threat.  A b grade movie obviously, how else do you explain the same two teams playing each other as a good example for this low budget flick?  Still it's sexy, plenty of good roller Derby action to garner three stars from this viewer.
