8279599,4,B000BBAAXK,"Richard visits a middle-aged prostitute, Naomi.  He  is curious about her and we are curious about him.  She is reluctant to reveal much about herself, use to sharing only what she chooses to in order to remain in control.  He wants to know more about what's behind the faade, and what this kind of life is all about.  He pries; she rebuffs.  This is a determined game of cat-and-mouse as we slowly begin to care about them both.  A slow but good movie.",1410825600,3,453,4.385542168674699
8279600,3,B000BBAAXK,"I only watched this because I really like Ray Winstone.  The movie was average, but Ray Winstone was great.  It had a very slow build up to the ending.  I kept waiting to see what the movie was about, but it was not possible to know until the end.  The ending was good.",1407888000,5,269,4.018867924528302
8279601,5,B000BBAAXK,"I first read an article on these guys back in 2003-2004 and was curious about the independent film they'd made that had gotten so much praise. It was well worth the purchase. If you like an independent comedy that kind of kind of goes of to the left, this is the movie for you. Imagine if you and your buddies just took a camera, or cameras and just decided to film something for fun, with a very original and hilarious story-line, funny characters and dialogue.

The three main characters have goals and dreams that seem so ridiculous, yet, their determination has you kind of rooting for them. One guy wants to film a documentary on Abe Lincoln, using a makeshift camera, made from outdated equipment. He enlists the help of a non-English speaking foreigner and all hell lets loose. The second guy, for whatever reason, wants to ""re-write and replace"" the national anthem; yet, he cannot sing or play a single note. The third has a delusion of being a superhero and is convinced that the President of the United States needs his services; yet,no one even knows he exists.

This is a cool story of perusing your dreams and following a vision-even if no one else understands.",1407801600,,1175,4.644230769230769
