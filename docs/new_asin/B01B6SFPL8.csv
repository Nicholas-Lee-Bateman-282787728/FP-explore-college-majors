7622251,5,B01B6SFPL8,"Great starting point for someone interested in Essentrics or Classical Stretch.  Sahra is very personable, and has a soothing voice.  The music is very nice, as well as the location.  Slow pace workout.",1472342400,10,202,5.0606060606060606
7622252,5,B01B6SFPL8,Seems to be BEYOND THE BEGINNER level.  Maybe I'm just more out of shape than I thought.  Couldn't perform most moves and they were very fast,1468800000,8,141,4.384615384615385
7622253,5,B01B6SFPL8,An excellent video!,1467676800,3,19,5.666666666666667
7622254,5,B01B6SFPL8,"Fantastic, but you've got to stick with it. Once or twice is not going to do it.",1467331200,8,80,3.764705882352941
7622255,1,B01B6SFPL8,"I ordered this directly from the company back in February.  On May 3 they sent me my first order, but my DVD player immediately issued an error message when I tried to use it.  The company sent me another copy, and instead of an error message, I get nothing, just the spinning disc sign.  I looked at the disc on my computer, and it isn't empty as I suspected, but it will not open there, either.

At this time I am very disappointed.  The company's customer service department is very nice and, although they've expressed skepticism - like somehow I'm doing something wrong because why would this happen? - they seem willing to work until this is solved.  Once resolved, I will certainly re-work this review.  Meanwhile, no Essentrics for me, and that is very disappointing.",1464307200,5,775,4.654411764705882
7622256,5,B01B6SFPL8,"A simple, easy to follow and just enough to give you the beginning of what the steps are all about. The barre exercises are wonderful and, to me more challenging.",1462665600,10,162,4.433333333333334

8749402,5,B01B6SFPL8,"Very easy to follow instructor.  And, after only a week or so on the the system, it appears to be really helping the muscle tone and flexibility, especially of  our 70 year old shoulders and spine.",1529020800,,197,4.444444444444445

8749405,5,B01B6SFPL8,This is a different kind of workout. If your looking to strengthen and stretching this is for you.,1493769600,7,98,4.5
8749406,5,B01B6SFPL8,I first tried Miranda's DVDs but am finding I am a much bigger fan of Sahra.  If you are even looking at this review don't give it a doubt. Buy the DVD. Sahra guides you through with less talking and more instructional. It flows well,1491696000,18,233,4.177777777777778
8749407,5,B01B6SFPL8,Good for a beginner or someone who can't do strenuous exercise.  Like me. It still gives you a work out for your arms and gives you some range of motion and stretching. It will be good for a few months and then I will need to get something else. Recommend as great place to start. I like it.,1489104000,11,291,4.017241379310345
