5852693,4,B00DSAUKOK,The acting is cheesy but the martial arts is believable.  It's worth it in the end.,1446249600,,83,4.1875
5852694,1,B00DSAUKOK,"Such a stupid movie, what a waste of 1.99 or whatever it costed me to rent it.
I am A fan of comedy. I have watched all of the naked guns, monthy pythons, airplane, dumb and dumber, robin hood man in tights, police academy and so on... But this is ridiculous.
A guy who works at a post office steals an unshipped box from japan, and touches nunchuckles and he receives a special power, and gets an afro, ... I mean I stopped watching it. So boring I felt asleep.

Good night folks, even writing a review makes me sleepy, when I remember what a junk this movie is.",1446249600,,563,4.165137614678899

5852696,3,B00DSAUKOK,Really a 2 1/2 star movie. Some parts of this movie are funny.,1444176000,,62,3.8461538461538463
5852697,5,B00DSAUKOK,This movie is awesome!! Basically a regular dude has acquired a weapon that awakens his kung fu skills to do good for his neighborhood and stop the corruption of the city. If you liked the classic film The Last Dragon then this movie is for you. Its not a clone to that film but a good movie to add with it if you liked that film.,1438560000,3,330,4.015151515151516
8597073,4,B00DSAUKOK,"Exceeded my expectations...

Okay, so it doesn't take much to understand that this whole movie was based on a 5 second internet meme video.  That said, I did not expect that I would be watching more than a few minutes of it.

Surprisingly, they actually crafted a loose story around it and I found the movie to be fairly entertaining.

It's still an indie movie and you will probably be disappointed if you're expecting some sort of Hollywood blockbuster, but I would venture to say that most of the people who rated this movie low couldn't make a better movie themselves.

8597074,3,B00DSAUKOK,It's alright. I thought it was afro samurai (really awesome). And it came to be this joke. It's actually fun but the acting could be better,1504483200,,139,4.384615384615385

8597078,5,B00DSAUKOK,"This is an excellent family film. The hero is a good person. He has a loving aunt, loyal friends and a hot girlfriend. The villains are corrupt and money hungry. The fight scenes are well done and the final fights are exciting. They should've removed the couple of minor curse words and Jim Kelly should've been in the film longer. He was in the film for about two minutes. I definitely recommend this film for action fans. It's always great to see a family, action film featuring a tough, African American martial artist. How many films like this exist? The Last Dragon is the first film that comes to mind. I can't think of any others. I'm glad that Kelly picked an excellent film for his last film. Highly recommended.",1463788800,2,721,4.553846153846154

8597081,5,B00DSAUKOK,"Though obviously shot on a low budget, I still give it five stars for being a lot of fun, a great story, and also for having the real Jim Kelly.",1447718400,,144,3.8333333333333335
