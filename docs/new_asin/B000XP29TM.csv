8228877,4,B000XP29TM,"Once Upon a Time in America (1984)  centers around the lives of a
handful of youths who grew up together in Brooklyn, NY at the turn
of the 20th century,  their highs and lows together and their
individual demise over a shorter or longer period of years, some
living in wealth, others not, and others stuck with their own
personal demons.

The movie is extremely consistent from start to finish, with top
marks in the visual department (scenes, timepiece aspects such as
T-Model cars, buildings, furniture, the clothes worn by people, the
street scenes.) It is especially outstanding in the high-grade
acting, mainly their subtle demeanor and natural dialog, expressing
as much from the non-spoken as from the spoken. Much is due to the
natural charisma and skill of James Woods, Robert De Niro, William
Forsythe, Tuesday Weld and James Hayden in captivating
imaginations.

The work starts out with especially ruthless and deadly action,
involving intergang rivalry, with graphic and bloody special F/X on
rubout victims. The Prohibition era is featured and explains the
type of work the gang operated in.

The multicultural reality of New York, even at the turn of the
century, is given plenty of time, from Yiddish delicatessens, to
Cantonese opium smoking salons (where the public could relax.)
Those salons, coupled with a recurring panflute soundtrack seem
slightly out of their element in the overall work, as are the
blatant multiple instances of characters shown using the toilet.

The story skillfully manages to show as many uplifting moments as
sober moments, the former with celebrations of various types
(parties, champagne, dancing and high-fives) and the latter with
point-blank rubouts, double crosses, and 2 rape scenes, one in a
taxi limousine in particular, to another during a robbery that
turns out to in having been an inside job. There's also extortion
against street vendors or newsstand owners by street kids, the
cooperation between a tavern owner and kids in relieving drunks of
their cash, once they've left the premises, etc.

The film is time-realistic, at one point showcasing a high-quality
restaurant, complete with expensive furniture, tables, bar, decor,
grandfather clock, right next to a former cemetery, shown in being
unearthed, with the deceased transposed elsewhere,  making way for
new real estate projects and developments.

The street scenes are interesting, with hundreds of people walking
the streets,  gang territory tension (brass knuckles, switch blades
etc) in between a rather cavalier approach by officers in dealing
with prostitution (a hearse actually used as a brothel),
corruption, stills in various places,  spirits distribution, drive
by shootings in broad daylight, etc.

The tension between private ownership / profitability and labor
union/ work conditions is demonstrated, with muscle hired to exert
fear by on each other, to the point that even pressure is brought
against officers in not intervening, in this case, the character
played by Danny Aiello whose baby is switched with another in a
nursery and used as a bargaining chip.

Lastly, the workhas a uniquely long playing time of perhaps 4
hours, spanning 2 DVD's, which is understanding considering the
goal of the director in telling an aging gangster's memories from a
strongly melodramatic, sentimental and nostalgic point of view.",1261094400,,3354,5.293785310734464
