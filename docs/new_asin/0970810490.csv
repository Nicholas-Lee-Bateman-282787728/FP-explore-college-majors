7794267,5,0970810490,"I love this video !  It is a beautiful and well-done film about a young girl visiting her aunt, and the fun time they have building a fairy house in the woods.  If you have enjoyed the Fairy House books, this will be right up your (woodland) alley.  It is not an instructional video per se, but after watching it you will have enough of an idea of how to build your own fairy house that you can just dive right in.  The pace is somewhat slow, which is a real treat as an alternative to the intense so called 'children's films' that Disney and the other studios crank out.  No imminent danger, no families separated by tragedy or death.  Just a nice relationship between a woman and a girl, and the enjoyable experience they share.  A treat.",1305417600,7,740,4.318840579710145
