8292026,3,B001D7ARO8,"Following up Julio Medem's previous 2 films - Lovers of the Arctic Circle and Sex Y Lucia - this is very similar in tone.  Medem is great with creating a visually exciting world in which the viewer can easily get swept up in the beauty, magic, and sensuality of life.  Just as the bleached out cinematography of Sex Y Lucia was integral to creating the dream-like atmosphere, here the use of vibrant, vivid colors works to suck us in to Ana's artistic world.

I don't want to spoil the plot, but let me say that the final act of the film really killed what was a mostly enjoyable movie.  While nowhere near as good as his previous two, if you like those, you will certainly find something worthwhile here.  It's hard to follow up a tour de force such as Sex Y Lucia, which in my mind put Medem even ahead of fellow Spaniard Pedro Almodovar, so there was bound to be some let down.

Overall, recommended for Medem fans, but be warned - it has a crappy ending (which is probably why it never saw a US release).",1277078400,8,1008,4.306878306878307
