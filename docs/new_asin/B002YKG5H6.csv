THE LITTLE BIG HORN WITH SOME OF THE ACTUAL INDIANS IN THE SCRAP SEEN
ON THIS FILM. FRANCIS FORD DID GOOD ACTING AND YOU CAN SEE WHERE HIS
BROTHER JOHN FORD LEARNED SOME OF HIS EARLY TECHNIQUES. IT IS LIKE
SEEING THE LINE BLUR BETWEEN FILM ENTERTAINMENT AND A DOCUMENTARY
EVERYONE SHOULD SEE THIS FILM",1496448000,,368,4.426470588235294
8384286,5,B002YKG5H6,"I have lived in the area of the Little Big Horn Battlefield my whole life, and attended the historic re-enactment of 1964, which took place on the actual battle site, as well as the tourist re-enactment of 2000 at a site several miles away. Both were well-done, but this early little film outdoes them. The stock is in pretty decent quality for a film that is now over a hundred years old.
The topography resembles the battle site so much -- steep bluffs and rolling hills -- that I would not be surprised to learn that the filming was done on the actual location. There are two kinds of teepees in the film, dark and light, and the light ones are probably Crow structures. The Crow would tan their hides to a brilliant white.
When this film was first made in 1912, the battle was still a recent memory, having taken place only 36 years before. For the re-release in 1923, twenty minutes of footage were added to the originally half-hour film. Even then, however, Survivors on both sides were still living, and the film tells the story from both points of view. The activities of Custer and of Sitting Bull are faithfully represented  Custer's side from the point of view of his widow Libby, who remained an engaging advocate for her husband's legacy for fifty years after his death. The recollections of native warriors also are included, however, not least of which is the one who finished off Custer. That makes this film a precursor to TORA! TORA! TORA!, which tells the story of the attack on Pearl Harbor from the point of view of both sides.
I get the impression from the film that Sitting Bull was the superior strategist, while Custer was a superior tactician. Custer was used to winning battles because he knew what to do in the thick of things, but he was bested when he ran up against an adversary who saw the big picture better than he did.
The thing that impresses me most about the film is the expert horsemanship of both the natives and the cavalrymen. Horses were still a principal means of transportation when this film was made, and the general confidence exhibited by these riders, even at top speeds, is something that would eventually disappear from the society and from film.
The film ends with a representation of the dedication in 1881 of the granite memorial listing the names of the fallen cavalrymen on the top of Last Stand Hill. Recently another memorial listing the fallen natives has been erected nearby. The two memorials complement each other nicely. Both forces had a diversity of nationalities represented, many of the soldiers being immigrants from Europe, and the natives representing a number of different tribes and clans. Visiting the two monuments back-to-back, one realizes that the Indian Wars were actually a second Civil War, since the opposing groups have both blended into the melting pot of America. Because of intermarriage, some visitors to the monuments actually have fallen relatives named on both monuments!
Anyone who travels to Montana should be sure to stop at the Battlefield, which is very well laid out for visitors, and anyone who wants to get a feeling of what the Indian Wars were like should see this film. It breathes authenticity.",1454544000,5,3196,4.758558558558558

dance performed by  them",1439856000,,170,5.2592592592592595
