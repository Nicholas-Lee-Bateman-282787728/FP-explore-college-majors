4708096,5,B005I4HO3O,"I bought this product and the product is excellent and delivery  was on time. But when I got to see the new-fangled cartoons of today it is not the same as the classics. The artwork of the cartoons are not perfect as the classics whose artists took pride in their work than today's artists and I am used to Mel Blanc's voice than the person who is trying to imitate the voices of Bugs and Daffy, etc. The new generation can stick to the new looney tunes...I prefer the old classics.",1333843200,3,482,4.2967032967032965
4708097,3,B005I4HO3O,"(Note: This is a review of the show in general, not the DVD disc itself)
Ah, yes....The Looney Tunes. It's a series of classic cartoons in which the characters would usually match wits to outsmart each other. The result is one of the best cartoon shows of all time. THIS, on the other hand.........Eeehhhhhhhhh...........It seems like the economy's affected the wonderful world of Looney Tunes, as the clever characters are now rather dumbed down to regular people in animal suits.

The Looney Tunes Show is not what I'd call a revival. The characters that you knew and love now live in generic houses in a generic neighborhood with generic people. There's still a nice amount of those classic characters, but they lost their fun personalities from the old cartoons.

Bugs Bunny, who was extremely witty, clever, and ended up in devious situations, is now only regularly smart and cautious, while also trying to avoid trouble. Daffy has been watered (No pun intended) down to the average dumb guy in a cartoon show. Speedy Gonzales is no longer known for his speed (?!), but is more known for his pizza. Yosemite Sam struggles in life, and Elmer Fudd is a newscaster...There's a LOT more sadistic changes to these formerly lovable characters, but I may as well stop here.

What's even worse is that they sometimes hang around and talk to the generic people. It's very weird watching them interact with plain human beings. They don't fit well with the humans at all. Sure, Animaniacs had some humans appear in the show, but even they happen to have unique personalities. Here, they seem like filler characters. In fact, there was an episode where Bugs and Daffy tried to get a HUMAN GIRL to be his girlfriend and win her over. What is Warner Bros thinking?

Fortunately, there are characters that stick to their roots. Sylvester and Tweety, for example, still chase each other around. The most notable still-mainstay is the shorts in which Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner do what they always do: Outwit each other as the Coyote tries to capture his prey. Although updated to CGI animation, they are just as fun to watch as the older Road Runner cartoons.

The last thing I'll talk about are the musical scenes. In Merrie Melodies, a certain character sings. Lemme just say: It is exactly how it sounds...

The whole show isn't bad, though. After all, the jokes that the characters make are still very funny (Although most of the humor is through dialogue, not slapstick), and there are still some good moments, such as Foghorn Leghorn and Daffy's trying to make a movie. But while the show is good as a cartoon sitcom, it can't even hold a candle compared to what the old Looney Tunes show brought us.",1332201600,,2703,4.740425531914894
4708098,4,B005I4HO3O,"It comes as such a wonderful shock to see this series dive into the emotional and psychological aspects of the Bugs/Daffy partnership that some of the gags have a way of sneaking up on you later. One of the best and sneakiest, for my money, is in volume one's ""Jailbird and Jailbunny,"" in which Porky Pig's recitation of an endless series of factoids about the Grand Canyon comes across as a well honed parody of a typical Jerry Beck audio commentary. Things like this keep these episodes fresh, and volume two continues to reimagine the Looney Tuniverse in surprising ways.

This time around, we see Daffy in the unlikely role of Big Brother (the youth organization, not Orwell); Bugs with a new catchphrase and the unwelcome celebrity status that it saddles him with; the Tasmanian Devil as a homicidal house pet; and a glimpse of Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny in their eternal triangle -- and isn't it good to learn that June Foray is as funny as ever in the role of Granny, which she's been playing since 1955?

""Casa de Calma,"" in which Daffy and Bugs compete for the attention of vacationing actress Starlett Johanssen, is funny but retro as hell: it's a string of bone-crunching gags that's little more than a triple-length theatrical short from the 1950s. ""Reunion,"" in which Bugs invites himself to Daffy's high school reunion, puts us firmly back in psychodrama territory, where the most interesting cartoons always seem to wind up. So much like life.",1327276800,3,1461,4.816733067729084
4708099,2,B005I4HO3O,"This show is awesome, well written and fun but this DVD release is pathetic. We live in the age of bluray where you can fir entire seasons on ONE disc. There's no excuse for cartoon network to keep releasing these stupid volume sets with 4-5 episodes on one disc. Give us the whole season.  I would gladly pay for an entire season of this series but this volume mess is a rip off.

People do one of four things with these volume sets, they buy them out of desperation, they wait until the season set comes out, they start pirating the episodes or (and this most likely on ebay and amazon)  they wait until the discs are no longer in high demand and buy them very cheap on the used market which results in no sales for the DVD producer...which decreases the chances of the rest of the volumes or the season set being made.

GET SMART. RELEASE THE SEASON SET.",1324944000,18,857,4.304347826086956
4708100,4,B005I4HO3O,"Bugs Bunny and his buddies are back for more in the ""Season 1, Volume 2"" DVD.  There are 4 episodes packed with hilarity and some familiar faces such as:

""Monster Talent"" - Daffy Duck teaches young Gossamer how to fit in better by entering the monster in the school talent show.  Elsewhere, after appearing in Speedy Gonzales' Pizzarriba commercial, the fame suddenly goes to Bugs' head.
First appearance: Gossamer, Witch Lezah a.k.a. ""The Witch"" (OK, first of all, what kind of magic spell did Witch Hazel use to switch her name backwards and make her sound like Bubbie from ""Flapjack"" ?  Second of all, does her ""son"" Gossamer sound suspiciously - albeit exactly - like Darwin ?  You know, Gumball's brother, the walking fish ?)

""Reunion"" - Bugs and Daffy are invited to their high school reunion.  But when Daffy stretches the truth to his high school friends, his bragging gets a little out of hand.
First appearance: Pete Puma, Marvin Martian (despite the fact that he was in a ""Merrie Melodies"" music video in the previous volume)

""Casa de Calma"" - Bugs and Daffy spend a weekend at a luxurious hotel and spa, where they try to win the attention of the sexy Starlett Johannsen.  (MAJOR EYE CANDY ALERT !!!)

""Devil Dog"" - A Tasmanian Devil runs loose and winds up on Bugs' doorstep.  The optimistic rabbit takes Taz in as his new pet, but Daffy disapproves on account of the vicious nature of the beast.
First appearance: Taz, Tweety, Sylvester, Granny (Granny did, however, make a brief cameo in ""Monster Talent"", but it's nice to hear voice actress June Foray reprise one of her best roles.)

And let's not forget the ""Merrie Melodies"" music videos like ""Cock of the Walk"" with Foghorn Leghorn and ""Queso Bandito"" starring Speedy Gonzales, and all four of the episodes have a ""Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote"" short such as ""Fee Fi Fo Dumb"" where the coyote uses ""Giant Spray"" to catch Road Runner and ""Unsafe at Any Speed"" where Wile E. utilizes a high-speed vehicle that goes way too faster than he thought.  Like I said, they do make up for the lack of any bonus features, if they'd have any.

Not much else to say here, but look for ""Season 1, Volume 3"" in March, plus more new episodes will air on Cartoon Network !",1323302400,6,2230,4.612658227848101

All of them are in their best incarnations,daffy isn't some jerk who isn't funny anymore like the speedy shorts had him,no he's looney again like he was ORIGINALLY! SO MUCH FUN AND LAUGHS!

When they renewed it for a second season, I was so happy!  I'm glad the girls Lola and Tina are back.  If I had to change one thing about the cartoon it would be - make Lola the Lola from Space Jam.
