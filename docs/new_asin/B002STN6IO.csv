3982271,5,B002STN6IO,My husband and I just love westerns. We realy like Sam Elliott.. all of his movies are great. I had not see this on cable or tv and we were suprised at how good the movie was.,1320105600,2,175,3.7567567567567566
3982272,1,B002STN6IO,"poor choice.  Apparently old TV movies, or at least of that caliber.  Not the Sam Elliott i was looking forward to.  Gone To Texas is the better of the two -- it was interesting but weak.  Blue River?  Not a western, not entertaining.
Look elsewhere.  You can do better.",1319673600,2,270,4.408163265306122
3982273,5,B002STN6IO,"Sam Elliott is one of our favorite actors. Although these moveis are not Academy Award worthy, they have a good story. What's better than a good western story on a Sunday afternoon?",1299110400,4,181,4.6875
3982274,5,B002STN6IO,Have not had a chance to watch the DVD yet but can say that it arrived in the condition that I was told it would be in and I am Pleased with it.,1298851200,,144,3.393939393939394
3982275,2,B002STN6IO,"Blue River had only a guest appearance of Sam Elliot, Gone to Texas dragged, Boring, Don't waste your time or money on this one........",1296518400,16,135,4.666666666666667
3982276,5,B002STN6IO,"I like just about anything Sam Elliot is in, but his westerns are all one of a kind. He never leaves you wanting. His performances are all hard hitting and his persona seems to have been made for western movies. Even in the tired old Gone to Texas screen play rewrites He still keeps you on the edge of your seat.",1281744000,25,313,4.147540983606557
3982277,5,B002STN6IO,"I love Sam Elliot.  He did a good job as usual in both of these movies.
I recommend them to anyone who likes westerns.",1392681600,,118,3.9166666666666665
3982278,5,B002STN6IO,"Excellent.  Elliott does well with this character and has gathered some real pros to do this with him.

3982279,2,B002STN6IO,"Really an avid Sam Elliott, I was looking forward to Gone to Texas, the Sam Houston story. I could NOT get side B to play on either a laptop or DVD player.  Any ideas?  I did watch side A, Blue River.  Great cast for a MFTV movie!",1374883200,,230,3.851063829787234
3982280,5,B002STN6IO,A must for all Sam Elliot fans who collect his movies.  Two movie of his that are not as well known as others.,1373068800,,110,3.782608695652174
3982281,5,B002STN6IO,Really an interesting movie.  Always totally enjoy anything with Sam Elliott in it.  Always pure pleasure. Would buy more of his movies,1368748800,,135,5.090909090909091
3982282,3,B002STN6IO,Good hsitory of Sam Houston and the freedom of Texas for european settlers and mexican settlers alike. A bit long and slow moving in places.,1365638400,,140,4.64
3982283,5,B002STN6IO,Who doesn't love Sam Elliot?  He continues to make note worthy movies that motivate an inspire us with great vigor.,1365379200,,115,4.75
3982284,5,B002STN6IO,Sam Elliot is the consummate cowboy. He always does an outstanding job bringing to the screen. His calm easy in your face always comes through.,1364169600,,143,4.76
3982285,3,B002STN6IO,"Movie was ok, I like anything starring Sam Elliot
however had the movie had anyone else as the main
character I would not have bought it; rental maybe.",1360454400,,151,4.428571428571429
3982286,5,B002STN6IO,"It is a movie, a movie, yes a movie,It works just as it should. It is a movie you know.

Would buy again without thinking twice

very fast shipping",1357603200,,147,4.0344827586206895
3982287,1,B002STN6IO,"I bought these two movies because I thought they were Sam Elliott movies.  His role was minimal in the first movie, so I have attempted to watch the second movie yet.",1357603200,,166,4.354838709677419
3982288,4,B002STN6IO,"As a Sam Elliot fan I enjoyed Gone to Texas and Blue River.  I thought because of the subject matter that they would be boring but was pleasantly surprised with Sam's performance.  If you have not seen Sam Elliot in Western Movies before and like these, you might try Conager, The Sacketts and The Shadow Riders with Ben Johnson, Glenn Ford, Tom Selleck, Katharine Ross, Barry Corbin and more.  They have a lot more action and are based on Western Writer Louis L'Amour's books.",1356566400,,477,4.654761904761905
3982289,5,B002STN6IO,"Must I say more, haven't seen a movie of his yet that I did not like with Sam in it.",1354492800,,84,3.25
3982290,4,B002STN6IO,Sam Elliot is great as always.  This is a good movie for Texans and those who want to know more about the history of Texas.,1353974400,,123,3.92
3982291,2,B002STN6IO,"""Gone to Texas"" is story of Sam Houston--played by Elliott--and is quite well done.
""Blue River""? Didn't care for it. Certain aspects seemed ""sick"".",1351555200,,148,5.208333333333333
3982292,4,B002STN6IO,"This DVD is for anyone who likes Sam Elliott, my husband likes him in movies & enjoyed this DVD, Sam Elliott has his own style of acting.",1348358400,,137,4.111111111111111
3982293,4,B002STN6IO,Enjoyed this western Sam Elliott is a very good actor plenty of action well worth watching. Blue River was not so good thought it may have been a western but turned out to be more modern action movie.,1330300800,,200,4.2894736842105265
3982294,3,B002STN6IO,"I bought this because Sam Elliott was in both features, but is only a guest appearance in Blue River so have not yet watched this.
Gone to Texas however gave me a wider understanding of Houston's life and career so will lead to wider reading and research.  I was however distracted by poor make up, particularly beards and sideburns of the characters as these were easily identified as false in fact in some sideburns the stitching was visible at the edges.

Another pleasant surprise was Katherine Ross as an Alamo survivor, along with Travis's slave sent to warn Houston and his army of what would befall them should Santa Anna capture them.",1326326400,2,643,4.732142857142857
3982295,4,B002STN6IO,"We ordered this DVD for the Gone to Texas video and it was very good.  Blue River was an extra for us.  It too was very good, but only a cameo showcase for Sam Elliott.  Both were worth the purchase if you are a Sam Elliott fan.",1322438400,10,228,3.8085106382978724
3982296,2,B002STN6IO,"To state these movies are meat and potatoe type westerns would be stretching the truth.  More like cornbread and beans.  Sam Elliot must really have been hungry.  Definitely had that ""made for tv"" look.",1321401600,,202,4.882352941176471

8379605,5,B002STN6IO,"Gone to Texas is a very historically accurate movie about a larger than life man who was governor of Tennessee, president of the Republic of Texas,first U.S. Senator from Texas and governor of Texas.  He was removed as governor because he refused to swear allegience to the Confederacy.
It centers on Sam Houston's life through the Battle of San Jacinto.  A fun part of the movie is seeing if you can find Emily Morgan, the Yellow Rose of Texas.  She appears twice for a few seconds each time.",1442793600,,493,4.579545454545454

8379608,4,B002STN6IO,"I like both films because they have Sam Elliott in them, but ""Gone to Texas"" does tend to drag on and on.  One just wants to get going to the main
part of the story.
Both have great scenery and good acting.",1422230400,,206,3.9047619047619047

8379611,5,B002STN6IO,The movie was very good. I love Sam Elliot.,1406160000,,43,3.888888888888889
8379612,1,B002STN6IO,"Pathetic.  Trashed it after watching both part way.  I love Sam Elliott's character and most of his movies, but these two were sorry, and they didn't even make it to the 1/2 way mark before they got ejected.  Low budget, sorry script.  No good character and no morals was my main issue.  I can watch new trash any day of the week by just turning on the tube.  Was looking for something better.",1396569600,,393,4.315068493150685
