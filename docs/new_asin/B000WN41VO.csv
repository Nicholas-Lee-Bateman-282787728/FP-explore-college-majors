8623036,2,B000WN41VO,"Let me start by saying Kelly Worden seems like he would be a good instructor to learn from in person. The personality and knowledge he displayed on other short clips online made me purchase this DVD. That being said, this DVD is not very good at all. Rather than a well planned training DVD, this product feels more like random thoughts from an experienced instructor. No real structure or break down of individual key techniques. If you are experienced in edge weapon techniques, you will be probably be very dissapointed by this DVD. While there are some moments of valuable information, I believe there are easily much better knife training DVD's on the market.",1307491200,10,664,4.833333333333333
8623037,5,B000WN41VO,"Kelly Worden is well known for his expertise with knives.  I have written reviews on several of his previous knife videos and they have all been excellent.  His most recent contribution is in my opinion the most practical and effective knife combat  DVD to date.  This film not only shows the basic use of the knife in combat, but how to  defend against knife attacks as well.  One of the things I really like about this video is that it was filmed in a broken down building with rocks, bricks and other things all over the floor and surrounding area.  Showing the techniques in what looks like a real life bombed out building  really adds realism to the techniques. It demonstrates that his techniques and tactics actually work in this type of environment.  His training partners were dressed in military gear which also added to the training realism.

A lot of material is covered in this DVD.  Worden gets right to the techniques in this film.  He begins by showing the figure eight slashing lines and moves to the four blocking lines.  What I like about his system is how it matches the basic unarmed blocks and angles.  The high, low, left side and right side blocks can be done with the knife or the non-knife arm.  He shows the relationship between empty hand techniques and the use of the knife in combat.  He demonstrates how to combine the basic four blocking angles with slashes and stabs.  He emphasizes the practice of staying in a low stable ""crouch"" stance and moving forward, back and to the sides. This is combined while using the block and slash techniques.  He does not spend a lot of time on stances and movement but relies on a student's previous training in the martial arts or other combat systems.

The DVD also covers diagonal cutting and slashing in combination using your non-knife hand to grab and strike.  He than moves to using the basic thrusts and slashes in combination with each other while moving.  The advanced cutting methods are demonstrated. They include the standard knife crossada motion drills.  For those not familiar with crossada, it is merely a crossing the arms slashing movement forward and reverse usually against the attacker's arms, but can be done on other areas of the body.  Another advanced knife technique shown is what Worden calls the ""double zero"" cutting.  In this drill, you practice the four blocking angles but you perform two quick slashes on each angle.  For example, if you are using an inside block cut on the attacker's arm, the first cut would be the inside of the forearm and the second cut could be on the bicep.

One of the many things you will like about this system is how Worden combines the use of the knife along with the use of the free hand to grab, strike and pull  the attacker to you.  He emphasizes to stay on top of your partner when doing these drills.  In real combat situation you want to keep close to your enemy until he is totally neutralized.

He than teaches how to disarm and control your attacker.  He explains how to stop and control the attacker's knife arm by a wrap around method with a face/eye grab. At the same time driving the attacker's head into a wall or on the ground.  He shows numerous arm locks, wrist locks and finger locks in this DVD. He also has his partners demonstrate what he calls his dirty dozen.  These are various effective strikes(Eye Thrust, Palm to chin, Knife hand to neck, punch to throat, elbow strike, Head butt, knee strike, kick etc) to vulnerable areas of the body.

The final part of this excellent video Worden does a flow drill using strikes, unbalancing, moving to wrist locks, arm locks, arm bars, finger locks, face grab, and leg locks.  Though the techniques shown in the DVD are very practical,  like any complex motor skill, you are going to have to actually practice the techniques in order  to master the information in this fine DVD.  The good point is that you can actually practice the knife slashes and stabs without a partner; however,  you will need a partner to practice the flow type drills and the control/takedown movements.

In conclusion, if you are into knives and practical street combat techniques, you will want to own this DVD.  I give it my highest rating:

 5 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Knife Handling & Knife Defense for Police Officers Official Manual).",1249603200,10,4323,4.662698412698413
