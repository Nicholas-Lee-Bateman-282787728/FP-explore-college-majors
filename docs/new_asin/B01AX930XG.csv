7613837,5,B01AX930XG,"I love this series as if it were the best thing to ever come from Japan, this season especially is probably the best from the When They Cry series. I'll get more into everything now:

Story: 10/10
Without getting into spoilers I'd say to refresh your memory of the first season's story as well. If that season confused you, allow this season to clarify everything. We have 23 new episodes of brand new plot that we have not seen at all, and we get a clearer look into Rika Furude's part in this chain of death. I know, I know, ""But it says there's 24 episodes!!!"", let me clarify. The very first episode of this season is an extension of the Atonement arc from season 1, it's the aftermath of a big event and shows an investigation. (Expertly avoiding giving away first and second season spoilers). The Disaster Awakening arc has one of the funniest opening scenes in this season, it's a short arc as it's more close to season 1's 4 episode question arcs, this is the last we see of the short arcs. The second, Massacre arc...I can't say anymore about Massacre and Festival Accompanyment arcs because those have long stories and I don't know how to review them without spoiling. All I have to say, is that Disaster Awakening, a question you'll have is answered in Massacre. Almost immediately.

Characters: 10/10
We get a brand new character in this season! She's on the box art, but I'll get to that. The characters are the same from the first season, except slightly more reliable in this season than the last season. As I said about the story, When They Cry Kai focuses more on Rika Furude's point of view and how things turned out as they did. This shows a lot more of her and Satoko and I believe that's what made Kai so much better than season 1.

Japanese VAs: 10/10
I don't really know how to judge the VAs, but from a drama student perspective, it was really well done. You could feel the emotion in the characters and you could tell they really felt what they were expressing.

Box art: 7/10
My only problem with this release is the box art. The cover is directly from the Japanese release, and it looks beautiful, but that's not what I have a problem with. It's the side and back cover as they hold mild to severe spoilers. The pictures that Sentai Filmworks used on the back hold some spoilers, especially from the new character. Literally, one of the pictures on the back is from the last episode. GG Sentai. GG. The disc arts look fantastic, they don't have any spoilers on them aside from a minor one with a character (again, avoiding spoilers).

Animation: 9/10
If you thought that season 1's animation was really good from a 2006 anime, this is even better. This season, not but a year later, looks more fluid and feels more real than some of the first season. (Case in point, look at my pictures.)

Overall, as a season, this is a near masterpiece on level with such like Steins;Gate and Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. This release is fantastic, thank you Sentai for licensing this series and bringing us the second season which has, mind you, never been in North America ever.",1463443200,5,3097,4.531305903398927
7613838,5,B01AX930XG,"I cannot believe what I'm reading!
Amazon really should turn off reviews BEFORE a release. But I'm here to put other ""reviewers"" to rest.

This show is amazing. If you liked season 1, Season 2 builds upon the ongoing mystery7",1460332800,5,225,4.625

7613840,5,B01AX930XG,"I'm SO happy they FINALLY made a second season box set that could be bought outside of Australia! Higurashi is one of my favorite animes, but without season 2, you really don't get the full experience.

Season 2 has ALL the answers and an EPIC ending! I'm SO happy its finally going to be available on here! Fans must have really complained to the company, because for the longest time Higurashi season 2 was impossible to buy!

SO happy! Getting season 1 for my birthday, and gonna get this in the summer!",1457913600,8,506,4.489130434782608
7613841,5,B01AX930XG,Cannot wait! This show is amazing!!!,1457049600,4,36,5.166666666666667
7613842,5,B01AX930XG,"I'm so happy that they're finally releasing Higurashi Kai. If you finished season 1 and still were confused, I would highly recommend watching this 2nd season. It not only explains a lot of the events from season 1, but it builds on it in a way that stays true to the original. If you want to know even more about Hinamizawa and its cute/crazy inhabitants, the first 2 chapters of the original visual novel can be found on Steam as well.",1455753600,13,437,4.407407407407407
7613843,5,B01AX930XG,"Picking up where I left off from my first review, here we witness something special occurring; an anime classic that never received an American release is getting just that! I am overcome with anticipation! This second season follows Rika and her ""guardian spirit"" as they search for a timeline that will prevent the events of the last season from becoming set in stone. In other words, Rika is behind the timeline resets. It's a genius premise and provides more answers that this one, so, if you wanted to know what the heck was going on in the first season, this second season will help alleviate that confusion. It is not english dubbed, but there is so much kawaii going on alongside the horror that english voices just don't make it seem right. I prefer subbed, having watched the first season dubbed and this season subbed, but I must say we can't be picky with something that is just finding an english market after 10 years. It might not look pristine on Blu-Ray, considering the grade and flatness of the animation, but I could be dead wrong (hah). ""Kai"" is not as entertaining as its predecessor (which would be very hard to do), and I hope you really like Rika, but it is a necessary step forward if we are to have anything resembling a resolution. It may seem rather expensive at first, but look here; this is considered an animation classic, never released in the US, and containing 24 episodes. Most shows of this price are newer and contain 12, so I'd say we got a decent deal. Now, there are a series of OVAS, but I doubt they will be released here, and instead will end up on their own DVD. Just a side note. ""Kai"" lives up to the first Higurashi's high bar and gives its fans everything they demanded from the first season; what more could you ask for? Take my word as you see fit.",1455753600,17,1799,4.47112462006079
7613844,2,B01AX930XG,It's not gonna be dubbed in English so I'm giving it only 2 stars. I really hate subbed anime but I do love higurashi. If it was dubbed it'd definitely deserve a huge 5 star rating in my opinion. And I honestly think they could make more sales if they dubbed it in English but kept the option for subbed. I mean it really sucks for some people who can't understand what the heck they're saying. However I'm very happy someone finally licensed higurashi again. It's been far too long.,1455062400,14,483,4.377777777777778
7613845,5,B01AX930XG,"Currently the price for this second season is frightening but might be well worth it. Why? This season was never released in the US from what I know on DVD or blu ray, now it finally comes and most likely with a dub too in blu ray quality :D this is the season that wraps up all the confusion and mystery from season one, in just a fantastic way!! Definitely a must get to complete the series :)",1454716800,14,395,4.076923076923077
7613846,4,B01AX930XG,"To help you decide whether or not you want to see/buy this: If you're looking for more of the same sort of mystery psychological thriller that made the first season infamous, then you probably do not want to buy this. Or at least try to preview it on Crunchyroll first. If you love the characters and are dying to have everything strange in the first season explained and see what happens to those characters, then you do want to buy this. When They Cry - Kai is essentially an explanation of all the weirdness that happened in the first season, with about the first 60%  of it being almost complete exposition. Based on how American audiences have received such anime in the past, I can understand the reluctance to release the 2nd season in America. An average viewer might find it boring or be disappointed that they're not getting more of the chilling psycho horror that was in the first season. But if you're dying to know what happens to everyone and how the entire ordeal finally resolves itself, then you will like this anime.  There is no English dub for this version so you will be hearing different voices for the characters. I believe the voicing is done well and the artwork is probably a degree better than the first season. As for the sub-title translation, the translators were really dedicated to even getting the slang and drawl translated of the more rural characters. There was so much southern vernacular on those parts that for a second I thought Mark Twain was translating. I believe this is the first time I've seen a ""Y'all"" in anime subtitles.",1469664000,5,1569,4.640287769784172
7613847,5,B01AX930XG,"This is definitely an anime that carries a deep message, and doesn't feel like it was directly copy-pasted out of the visual/sound novel. Get it while it's still licensed, it's better than the fan dubs.",1469404800,,202,4.8
7613848,5,B01AX930XG,great,1469232000,,5,5.0
7613849,5,B01AX930XG,The disk was not scratch and works perfectly and it was delivered quickly also. The anime itself is also great.,1468627200,,111,4.6
7613850,5,B01AX930XG,"This second season of Higurashi is a fantastic conclusion to a great series. It's that simple. All of the horror and death in the first season, and then comes this. The tension is dialed up high, and it all leads to, seriously, one of the best finales I've ever seen. I'm not even going to spoil anything that happens. Except to say that, if you watch both sets back to back, you can skip the prologue of Kai. It's an information dump of everything that you find out at the end of the first season. Be prepared to cry, worry, and smile for all of these wonderful characters.

Sentai didn't include much in this release, like the last. There's no English dub, so be warned that Japanese with English subs is your only choice. For a ten year old series that didn't really take off on official release in the US, that's not a surprise. The only reason the first season came with English is because Geneon commissioned one on their initial release years ago. The animation seems a bit wonky on my copy sometimes, and I can't remember if that's part of the original release or if it's something with Sentai's transfer. Doesn't detract from the amazing story, though. Do yourself a favor and check this entire series out. The first two seasons are the main story, and everything after either adds to the backstory or just works as fanservice.",1468195200,2,1336,4.54356846473029
7613851,5,B01AX930XG,Absolutely awesome.,1467417600,,19,9.0
7613852,5,B01AX930XG,"This series crosses many genres, it keeps you wanting to come back for more answers every time you learn a little more!  Arrived in perfect condition, though I accidentally ordered 2 copies of this in my enthusiasm to see the next chapters.  My bad..!  ;)",1467331200,,255,4.622222222222222
7613853,4,B01AX930XG,"I'm ecstatic to own season 2 not only on Blu-ray, but in a specific release for North American viewers. Season 2 continues the neverending struggle that the characters are forced into, but it also explains why the same month happens over and over again. I won't get into any more of the plot to avoid spoilers, so let's just talk about the Blu-ray release in general.  The video quality is excellent, leaps and bounds over the first season not only in art direction but in terms of animation quality and consistency. The Japanese actors are all wonderful in their roles; there isn't a dub for season 2, but the dub for season 1 wasn't great so I'm over it. The cover art and disc artwork all look great. There's no PS3 disc regonition or alternate cover art, but I can live with minor issues like those. The only thing that I find slightly annoying is that the textless opening and ending songs are not available on the discs. Prior to owning this set, I had imported Higurashi Kai from Siren Visual, an anime distributer in Australia. The textless songs are available on that set, although it should be known that since those discs are in PAL format, the video is played slightly faster, making all the sound on the discs higher pitched, which is especially noticeable in the first few seconds of the opening. Now that we have this release though, those textless songs are the only thing that release has a one-up on our set, besides maybe the packaging being slightly better (it came in a nice slipcase). If you love Higurashi, definitely pick this up, it's necessary to tie up the plot line from the first season. Also, be on the lookout for season 3, Higurashi Rei, which will be releasing later this year. The sound novels are also being rereleased by MangaGamer on PC, with updated character sprites and a new translation!",1466121600,,1828,4.624615384615384
7613854,4,B01AX930XG,"This series is really good and i'm glad sentai filmworks was able to bring the second season over to the US after so many years.

But i do have a problem with sentai filmworks release. I bought the blu ray of this series and i've noticed in some episodes the resolution is downgraded from other episodes on the disc it almost feels like this was a cost saving mesaure on sentai's part to fit as many epsiodes on few discs as possible. Its a bit disappointing for that to happen on kai's first relase ever in the US

Other than that this was an alright release for a really awesome series. If your going to buy this i reccomend buying the dvd to save your self money since there really isn't much of a difference resolution wise",1465171200,,727,4.299270072992701

8748748,5,B01AX930XG,"Review is for Bluray product,  not the show:
Pros: The cover is nice,  I like that it's one case for the whole season with only 4 Discs. For those who watch subs; Subtitles stand out nicely, I know many shows choose subtitle color poorly ending up with scenes where they melt into the background, not the case here.  Translating seems solid too. I've rewatched this show at least 5 times and the subs hold up with the characters and story. This is always by biggest hang up when deciding whether or not to purchase an official release.
Cons: Unfortunately I do have a complaint, the 2nd disc is not secure at all! It falls out from the slightest of movements and it's in the middle page that you must move to reach the last 2!

The show: Higurashi no naku koro ni, is one of my all-time favorites! (This is the 2nd season, so watch the the 1st.) Kai has all the answers to the questions built up on the 1st season and a great conclusion to the story!  This leaves you itching to rewatch the 1st season just to catch all the little details you didn't notice before, now that you know the truth. I have thoroughly enjoyed showing this to people due to it's incredible re-watchability!",1510963200,,1182,4.4036697247706424
