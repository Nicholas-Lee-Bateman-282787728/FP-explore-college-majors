4587727,5,B0056AVBPW,"The Disco Exorcist is a homage to all of those fun filled, no holds barred, break all of the rules type of films that we loved from the 70's. The film shows everything the decade was famous for with great relish. The story revolves around Rex Romanski a rogue of rogues that is always using and leaving the ladies until he encounters Rita Marie. No one f$#@s with Rita Marie and with good reason as she puts a curse on Rex and has newest gal Amorena Jones (a 70's porn star). Full of great moments of gore and comedy, Disco Exorcist delivers on all fronts.",1336003200,2,556,4.304761904761905
4587728,5,B0056AVBPW,"What is the Disco Exorcist you ask? It's the brain child of director Richard Griffin and Scorpio Films. It's a total throw back to the 70's style no rules type of film. The story is about the ultimate womanizer Rex Romanski playing with the wrong girl who decides to make him pay for his philandering ways. Great acting especially by Ruth Sullivan as Rita Marie the woman you never scorn. Also great work done Michael Reed, Sarah Nicklin, and Brandon Louis Aponte. This is not a film for the squeamish or easily offended but for the fan of no rules film making.",1308182400,3,561,4.509803921568627

8459356,5,B0056AVBPW,Raunchy & cheap acting. My kinda film! Someone posted this on Facebook & it caught my attention so at the time I ordered I got the last used copy & was thrilled. Good condition. Decent packaging. Naughty film. Good times.,1420761600,,221,4.55
8459357,5,B0056AVBPW,"This is just one of gay writer/director Richard Marr-Griffin's perverse and hysterical indie films, this one with a faux-seventies sensibility.",1401753600,,143,6.2
8459358,4,B0056AVBPW,"Its a soft porn film with a bit acting thrown in,its another so bad its good nothing to tax the brain just have a laugh with some friends after the pub.",1382745600,,152,3.935483870967742
8459359,3,B0056AVBPW,"THE DISCO EXORCIST is a low-low-budget film that manages to parody the disco era, while poking (pardon the pun) fun at the porn industry. All while being a decent horror-satire. Disco dance king / uber-stud, Rex Romanski, is dancing, loving, and snorting his way along, minding his own business, when he gets cursed by a jealous lover w/ voodoo powers! Rex must perform an exorcism or die horribly! If idiotic splatter comedies are your bag, then TDE should get your lava lamp bubbling...",1369526400,,488,4.891566265060241
8459360,1,B0056AVBPW,"Here is a run down of the first 40 mins:
Soft core sex
talking
dancing
talking
dancing
soft core sex
talking
dancing
soft core sex
talking

After some of the most boring soft core sex scenes intermingles with disco dancing and a crap load of talking,  we are now at the 40 min. mark.

Oh hey, something just happened! A heart gets ripped out of a guy while he is filming a soft core sex scene.
After this point there is a little bit of gore and water downed blood dripping from people and hey there is even an exorcism and then basically the movie is over!  Awesome (sarcasm).",1363564800,,576,4.256880733944954
8459361,1,B0056AVBPW,"I'm a huge fan of bad, bad movies; all flavors and types, I can't get enough.  This is billed as a horror comedy, but it really is neither- It's a poorly written re-imagining of what the writers think the 70s wer eliek based on what I can only imagine were grainy pornos and bad grindhouse movies.  There's really nothing redeemable here-- don't waste your time.  The pacing is awful, the dialogue is forced, and the effects are below cheesy.  Again, there's not even any unintentional golden moments in here-- just drek.",1361232000,,521,4.6923076923076925
8459362,3,B0056AVBPW,"If you're into this kind of movie, well, it's probably just about what you're used to.  I used to be into this kind of thing, but I don't feel it anymore.  It was still watchable, and I sat all the way through it in one sitting, but this kind of movie doesn't inspire me anymore.

In my opinion it wasn't over the top in gore or breasts.  It really seemed like it was trying to be a legitimate movie about a disco exorcist.",1351814400,,423,4.0602409638554215
8459363,2,B0056AVBPW,This film was an independant crazy cover of the 70s and The Exorcist theme-films. It was not that creative - the concept is the best!,1350864000,,133,4.36
8459364,5,B0056AVBPW,"The Disco Exorcist is another great movie from Richard Griffin. I really liked his movies Necroville, Feeding The Masses, and Nun of That, and I also liked The Disco Exorcist. The first half is full of nudity, sex, and campy humor. However, the second half delivers the gore and 70's horror homages. If you're a fan of b-movies, demons, and disco, you must see this movie! It's the best indie horror movie I've seen since Caesar & Otto's Summer Camp Massacre!",1340150400,6,459,4.679012345679013
