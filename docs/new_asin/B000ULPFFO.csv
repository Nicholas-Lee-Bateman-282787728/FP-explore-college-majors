8213718,5,B000ULPFFO,"This movie is fabulous. I don't remember where I originally saw it, but it was on tv. Maybe on the BBC channel. I had never heard of it before. Its an amazing film, the same story told 4 different times, each time through the eyes of a different one of the characters. Amazing plot twists. Really great actors. This is a wonderful film, highly recommended.",1477353600,,356,4.492307692307692

8213721,5,B000ULPFFO,The twists and upturns in this miniseries were astounding. Each actor added so much to the parts and I loved the way we got to experience the story through one character's eyes at a time.,1367971200,2,187,4.371428571428571

8213723,3,B000ULPFFO,"This Ruth Rendell-ish mystery has an experienced cast, most of whom fans of BBC and British movies will be familiar with.  Elizabeth McGovern, who is obviously American, was actually the one slight disappointment as far as the cast is concerned.  Her portrayal of the devious sister-in-law was somewhat over the top but there were other problems, too.  The storyline contained some twists and turns, especially at the end, but overall the plot wasn't dissimilar from many others in this day of psychiatric overload.  All the characters seemed to be borne down with past trauma of one sort or another and they seemed particularly adept at aggravating each other's problems.  The father (Cieran Hinds) was well acted and probably the least unlikable of the four main characters, who were, in addition to the sister-in-law, the surly teenage son and the frigid wife (played by Maria Doyle Kennedy, also seen in The Commitments and The General). The story of the interactions of these four characters, dredging up the past and wallowing in its lingering effects on them, moved along at a pace designed to hold your interest and culminated in the requisite dramatic denoument and mystery solver.  Overall, it is a sufficiently involving saga as long as the viewer doesn't need to feel any real attraction to any of the central characters.",1199491200,15,1333,5.036363636363636
