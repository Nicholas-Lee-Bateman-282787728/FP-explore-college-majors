8244894,5,B0012A4QY8,"I've been searching for a DVD copy of this documentary since the late 90's when I happened to catch half of it on PBS before they aired the actual show. Wow!!! What an amazing behind the scenes look at this brilliant show. From it's 7min show stopping performance at the '93 Eurovision Song Contest all the way to it's American debut 2yrs later at Radio City Music Hall, this DVD captures all the magic that IS Riverdance. There are tons of interviews with the creative team, cast, celebrities, and fans of the show packed into it's 75min running time. Don't have a copy of the actual show? Don't worry because there is a TON of performance clips of the show scattered throughout as well as fantastic rehearsal footage as well. If you love Riverdance you will love this wonderful, in depth look at the story behind the show. An absolute must see, must own for any Riverdance superfan like myself!!",1348617600,,897,4.6125
