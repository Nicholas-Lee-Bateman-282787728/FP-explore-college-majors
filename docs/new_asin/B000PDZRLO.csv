SD video quality was also not good- my 11 year old Nephew could have done better with an old cell phone.",1367020800,,194,4.27027027027027
8190777,2,B000PDZRLO,"Not a very well written movie.  although the storyline is plausable, the details seem thrown together as filler.  A Good looking couple though (initially).",1348185600,,155,5.416666666666667
8190778,1,B000PDZRLO,"Only a movie for those that are gluttons for punishment. It starts out bad, gets worse, and then gets painfully bad. The only reason I got through it was because I was playing Batman: Arkham City at the same time.",1343433600,,213,4.35
8190779,2,B000PDZRLO,"This was my first experience purchasing a ""video on demand"" disc from Amazon and may very well be my last.  The movie skipped several times and froze once in a way that was obviously due to degradation in the source file and not the disc itself.  It was pressed on to a cheap purple DVD-R with the same poster image used for both the disc and also heavily stretched out to fill the case cover.  No extra anything, not even subtitles.

The film itself had potential (solid acting, concept, lighting) but fell short in a couple of categories.  Mainly the camerawork was terrible.  Nearly every shot was a static bust of whomever was speaking at the time - dynamic camera moves can be counted on one hand.  Add to this that the movie was all talk and you are stuck watching people converse for the whole picture.  Any time action is due to occur the viewer is detoured to a flashback or jump cut.  Casting was restricted to the point that only one scene has more than two people in it.  A critical court scene is handled by showing the exterior of a courthouse (the Supreme Court, no less, where divorces are never handled).  Costuming appears to have been handled by Ross Dress for Less.

So unless you really like watching people argue endlessly, avoid this one.",1280361600,2,1261,4.506607929515418
8190780,4,B000PDZRLO,"I sat on the edge of my seat waiting for him to successfully get revenge on his ex-wife. While the movie wasn't fabulously produced, I found it really intriguing to watch the characters turn from one person to another throughout the movie. Pretty cool, I think that they could have done a better job with the dialogue and painting better pictures in the flashback scenes.",1275955200,,371,4.723076923076923
8190781,4,B000PDZRLO,"I am not sure if this was a movie intended to appeal to my prurient instincts (yes, that it did) but I do think there's a good deal of quality to the movie, and I don't think the director really intended this to be just another sexed up movie.  Instead, I think the director was willing to let the producers make the first scenes get sexed up so that people would rent it, then would find there are other more solid, durable qualities that make the movie worth watching.

I watched all the way through, and it stood the test of a full-length movie, for me.  It was good.",1203897600,9,570,4.2110091743119265
