6130316,5,B00H3UCGEI,"One of the best television murder mystery series ever made. Why on earth this series has not been remastered and released on Blu-Ray is beyond me, especially with the success of Inspector Lewis (also Blu-Ray, please?) and Endeavour. The whole Morse universe is wonderfully worth watching.",1451520000,3,288,5.282608695652174
6130317,5,B00H3UCGEI,"MORSE was discovered during a time of my complete entrapment by BBC mysteries: it was (and is) by far the best scripted, filmed and cast of all those 1990 BBC endeavors. In the interim it was not available, I researched John Thaw and came to realized what a terrible loss his early death was. Recently I acquired Netflix, strictly to view those available Morse episodes again. Within the past three months I have watched them all, straight through, twice - catching more of John Thaw's genius with each one. I limit myself to one a week 'lest I become over fed and insuring they are seen at a time of complete focus. Amazon indicates there are more episodes than Netflix offers: could anyone post an answer to this? Thank you.",1444521600,7,726,4.592307692307692

6130334,5,B00H3UCGEI,"I am a Brit by birth (albeit now a Canadian), but it took my wife (a Danish Canadian) to get me interested in Morse.  The plots are frequently so complex that solving most of them is beyond me, although as a retired law prof and criminal lawyer I relish some of the legal and forensic aspects which are done with brilliant accuracy.  The world of the Oxford Colleges will seem strange to many in North America, but again the portrayal is brilliantly accurate.  A basic knowledge of English military, political and social history c1940-1965 is helpful in understanding some of the references and allusions, including some of the humour.  This version of the set is the original one: it is not widescreen and has no subtitles or closed captions, but its price is eminently more reasonable than that of the more recently remastered set, and its price for Canadians is much better from US suppliers than from ones listed on Amazon.ca even allowing for the decayed state of the Canadian dollar.

I strongly recommend this to all lovers of good mysteries and to all lovers of English society. life and humour.  The overall technical quality of the remastered set (seen on Netflix) is better than the one under review here, but as already stated the price differential is substantial.",1458518400,6,1277,4.808219178082192
6130335,4,B00H3UCGEI,"I have only completed the first nine discs.  One of these had a slight glitch, it stopped, needed to figure out how to skip past it then the rest of the disc was fine.  Most of the stories are great, good mysteries with some humor thrown in (didn't care much for episode three)....Morse is grumpy, kind, afraid of heights.  Sometimes gives Lewis a tough time, but Lewis can take it and even gives back.  Morse likes the ladies, but so far hasn't a permanent one. The opera music can be a bit loud, but goes away when the talking starts, but because there are no subtitles I tend to turn up the sound to be able to catch what they are saying and then am grabbing for the remote when the music comes on. I gave four stars because there are no subtitles.",1457913600,8,751,4.230769230769231
6130336,1,B00H3UCGEI,"Very poor recordings on disc, Cds were out of order and not in proper cases, and disc pages were broken in every case so the cds moved around.

6130342,5,B00H3UCGEI,"This ""Complete Series"" is the newest available set of ""Inspector Morse"" and it has all 33 episodes, as well as all three TV specials. It also includes Cast Biographies, Selected Filmographies and Morse Trivia to read.  It does NOT however include English Subtitles (or the photo of the back of the DVD case would state it). Nor is it remastered in sound or picture quality. Remastering and subtitles have been on fans' ""Inspector Morse"" wish-list for a long time, and it looks like we're still hoping. However, I have read that if you have a Region 2 DVD player, the Region 2 edition of this Complete Set does include subtitles (and may be remastered).

""Inspector Morse"" premiered in 1987 - and yet it does not feel dated. Only occasionally are you reminded it is an older show - once when someone types a letter using carbon paper, and once with a computer using the old DOS (remember green letters on a black screen?)!

I can put up with that, given the exceptional scripts and characterizations. I wish I had room here to give you a synopsis of every episode, or even my favorite episodes. For that matter, there are some scenes which stand out in their excellence.

Inspector Morse (played by John Thaw, now deceased) is cranky, intelligent, tenacious and curious. He loves his pint, he's addicted to crosswords, and he seems to only be attracted to women who are in love with someone else. He is a bull-dog when he sniffs something odd, and he frequently gets in trouble for overstepping.

His murder mysteries are anything but run-of-the-mill and definitely excellent entertainment.

This set includes the three 50-minute each TV specials: ""The Making of Morse"", ""Inspector Morse's Oxford"" and ""The Story of Morse"". This first two of these are available to buy separately, as indicated below.

I thought I'd give you a run-down of other options for collecting Inspector Morse. If you are only interested in a favorite episode here or there, I have created a review for each Collection Set and Inspector Morse Set with an episode synopsis, which may help you find the specific episode in which you're interested. I guess these episode synopses, covering all 33 episodes, were truly a labor of love! In particular, Colin Dexter, author of the Inspector Morse mysteries, has a cameo in most of the episodes. See if you can find him.

Dexter thought that John Thaw so perfectly embodied the role that in March 2014, he told the British newspaper, ""The Guardian"", that he had it written into his will that no one other than Shaun Evans could portray Morse on the screen.

A. . ""Inspector Morse 25th Anniversary Collection"". This set has all 33 episodes plus all three specials, ""The Story of Morse"", ""The Making of Morse"" and ""Inspector Morse's Oxford"". It comes in a case.

B. Collection Sets. There are six Collection Sets. All are available on amazon as I write this. Each Collection Set has 4-6 episodes.  The 6th of the Collection Sets, called ""Inspector Morse: Remorseful Day - Collection Set"" includes a separate disc with ""The Story of Morse"".
None of the Collection Sets have ""The Making of Morse"" or ""Inspector Morse's Oxford"".
Here is a link to the first of the Collection Sets, so you can get an idea of what's included:

C. Inspector Morse Sets. There are eleven ""Sets"", called ""Inspector Morse Set One"", and so on. All are available on amazon as I write this. Each ""Set"" has three episodes.
None of these eleven sets contain ""The Story of Morse"", ""The Making of Morse"" or ""Inspector Morse's Oxford"".
Here is a link to the first of the Inspector Morse Sets:

D. ""Inspector Morse - Complete Collection"" Boxed Set. This has all 33 episodes plus ""The Story of Morse"" and ""The Making of Morse"". Everything arrives in a nice wooden box. If you are giving Inspector Morse as a gift, the boxed set may be enough extra special to make the Complete Collection worth it, even at full price. It doesn't exactly fit nicely on a shelf of your DVD's though.
The Complete Collection does not have ""Inspector Morse's Oxford"".

F. ""Inspector Morse's Oxford"". This 1-disc TV special was prepared for the 25th Anniversary of ""Inspector Morse"", and stars John Thaw.

I can highly recommend having all of the Inspector Morse episodes in whatever edition. This is a fabulous and intelligent series which I've viewed several times through. (I have the Collection Sets and the separate ""The Making of Morse"" and ""Inspector Morse's Oxford"", because I collected them over time.)

8629632,5,B00H3UCGEI,I finally found this complete set at a price we could afford. This was a birthday gift for my partner who happens to originate from England. Thank you.,1524441600,,151,4.428571428571429
8629633,5,B00H3UCGEI,Was able to watch on Amazon Prime...loved it...wish there were more so have watched Endeavor...watching that again and starting to watch Inspector Lewis...Great writing...Great acting...Will probably watch entire series again...yes it's that good.,1514678400,,247,6.515151515151516

8629636,3,B00H3UCGEI,I love Morse and was excited to get this set.  Was suppose to be new.  I question if this is true.  Discs themselves look fine but were out of order to what the box stated the order should be.  Also the box was banged up and looked a little used.  The plastic disc holders were broken or chipped.  I had plastic pieces fall out when box was opened.  The collection was what I wanted so I can't complain about that.  Hated to pay new price for something that looked to be used.,1499126400,3,476,4.0978260869565215
8629637,5,B00H3UCGEI,"Morse was the foundation for the inevitable Lewis series and what a foundation it was. John Thaw is superb as Chief Inspector Morse, a brilliant criminalist with certain foibles that earmark this remarkable series, including his sidekick Whately. Good stuff.",1494633600,2,258,5.475
8629638,2,B00H3UCGEI,"The DVDs are fine, but 2 of the 4 cases were broken and DVDs were loose.  The DVDs themselves are not numbered so you have to look-up them to get them in the right order.  I will not order from the company in this future.",1493856000,2,221,3.888888888888889
8629639,5,B00H3UCGEI,What a treat.  My wife and I have been doing an episode a night and we are almost finished. Don't know what we will do then. It is fun to see the earlier work of familiar actors and compare them with current appearances. The video quality is great. This collection of Inspector Morse used High Quality DVDs. We were recently disappointed with a DVD video collection from another vendor. They used poor quality DVD Disks that sometimes would not work right out of the package. We are very pleased with this collection.,1491523200,2,517,4.619565217391305
8629640,2,B00H3UCGEI,"We returned this collection although we absolutely love the series and have watched it 4 times; had started watching again on Acorn when, without warning, they removed it. So, why the 2-Star rating? NO SUBTITLES! (Acorn had subtitles as did Netflix when they streamed it. You, Amazon, don't stream it on Prime.) The TV subtitles didn't work, either, although it indicated that it did. My husband is partially deaf and needs the subtitles. I have gotten used to them and like them because sometimes even American shows are hard to understand b/c actors don't always speak well, drop sentence endings, the sound is not terrific, etc. Add foreign accents and phrases to that and good luck following, hearing and understanding what the actors are saying.

I fail to understand why, in 2017, all DVDs do not have subtitles. The Seller told us that the series is going to be reissued around Christmas time and everyone is asking them to include subtitles.
