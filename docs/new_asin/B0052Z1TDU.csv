8454839,5,B0052Z1TDU,"The Scam is a film about the events and activities in the Korean stock market. After studying stocks for several years, self-taught trader Kang Hyun Soo hits it big by profiting from a burgeoning stock rig he's been following. His little escapade, however, disrupts the plans of crime boss-turned-financial mogul Hwang Jong Ku. After roughing him up a bit, Jong Ku offers Hyun Soo in on the scam of a lifetime, a $60 million stock rig. With the world slipping into economic crisis, Korea cashes in with its first featuring revolving around the stock market.

The Scam is a high-stakes crime thriller takes audiences into the back room wheeling and dealing of the rich and powerful, where sleek black suits hide white-collar crime. The movie was interesting from beginning to end. The actors did a wonderful job of making the story attractive to the viewers especially those who have no idea about what is going on in the stock market. Aside from that, it also provides great entertainment. The movie is a must-see and highly recommended.",1428278400,,1037,4.892045454545454
