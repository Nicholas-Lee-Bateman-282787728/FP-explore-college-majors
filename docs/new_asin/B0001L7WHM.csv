8013946,5,B0001L7WHM,"I love this tape. I'm a video junkie when it comes to exercise, and this is definitely one of my favorites. The workout is divided in 5 sections: a warm-up, lower body, upper body with weights, abs and a cool down. The movements are really easy and Petra (the instructor) is so nice that it makes the time fly by. The only thing that I don't like about this video is that the abs section is really really easy and short, but if you complement it with an abs routine of your own, it's great.",1158105600,3,490,4.168421052631579
