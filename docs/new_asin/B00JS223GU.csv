6389591,3,B00JS223GU,"I haven't read the novel, but very much wanted to like the film. It has a great cast, good production values, and seems to do a reasonably good job of presenting the period and place. (I lived in Ghana for 6 months in the early 70s and have known a number of Nigerians as well as Americans who lived there at various times). I found the film extremely compelling up to the end, which lacked dramatic resolution, seemed dismayingly anticlimactic, and left me questioning the point of the entire narrative I'd watched. I assume I'll find the meaning I missed onscreen in the book. Thandie Newton gave the best performance I've ever seen her do. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Anika Noni Rose both were brilliant, as usual. I wish the soundtrack had used more African music. I found the Western ""movie mood music"" jarring and culturally intrusive. With Nigeria in dire straits again, currently facing jihad in the north, rampant corruption and central government misrule today, I wish I knew what lesson this film wants us to take from the Biafran war...",1408147200,6,1041,4.7569060773480665
6389592,3,B00JS223GU,"It's not easy to make a good movie based on a brilliant novel and this film does not quite pull it off. The first half of the film focuses on two romantic relationships which in the book give texture to the story and reminds us of war's devastating effect on individual lives. In the film the relationships seem exaggerated and it's not until the second hour that the film redeems itself. The footage of the carnage is realistic enough to remind us that civil war is always savage whether it happens in the northern hemisphere or the southern, whether the antagonists are white or black, whether 19th century or 20th. If you have not read the novel, by all means read it and everything else Ms Adichie has written. She is one of our (humanity's) finest writers.",1407542400,11,761,4.562043795620438

6389594,5,B00JS223GU,"Very informative movie about the tension

6389595,3,B00JS223GU,"I love Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the author of the book that this movie is based on, for her lovely, deep, accurate, honest and gripping books and speeches. One thing she has indeed truly championed is her way of telling multi-faceted stories in such a way that we as readers can see the human side of sensitive subject matters such as ""race"", ""Africa"", immigration, gender and even (civil) war, the framework for her book and this movie.

While her novel ""Half of a Yellow Sun"" helped me greatly to connect with the Nigerian characters and their issues, thoughts, dreams and hopes, I believe the movie adaption fails badly in creating this kind of emotional connection. I couldn't put the the book down, yet the movie left me wanting. Here are some specifics:

- The love stories are not that touching:
Especially the relationship between Richard (a British) and Kainene is presented in a rather odd way. While I bought into their relationship in the novel, Richard's overly awkward and shy presentation in the movie made the ""love"" between these two seem strange and not believable.
Olanna, the protagonist, was giving me too much drama and sobbing. She has her struggles and outbursts in the novel, yes, but not to this extent. When I was in Nigeria myself, most women seemed more tough-skinned than her. Maybe the British actress Thandie Newtwon (playing Olanna) has not been exposed to Nigerian life that much. Her up-and-down love story with the ""revolutionary lover"" does not seem as exciting and charming as the movie attempts to portray it.

- The characters are too flat:
The personal, emotional and intellectual development of Ugwu, their houseboy, is shockingly lacking in the movie. The novel provides some great insights into his life and mind, but in the movie he is a mere peripheral figure - making Olanna's mourning over his supposed death appear not quite convincing. In my opinion, most characters lacked the depth to truly connect with them, even the protagonists.

- The dynamics between the twin sisters are not as nuanced as in the novel. In the adaption, they are just jolly sisters going through thick and thin, an old trope not representing the experience of many siblings.

On the positive side, we get:

- great performances by some actors: Particularly candid Kainene and Odenigbo's rather traditional mother truly excel.
- Good insights into the war and the political situation: Maps are shown, the basic tribal conflicts are explained and the original video material (e.g. old BBC news) made the war and the political situation come alive. However, the specifics of this particular war (life in a refugee camp, kwashiorkor (malnutrition) and its public representation in the Western world) don't become evident (they do in the novel though).
- At the same time, I give credit to the producer for not showing too many war scenes: I am tired of gruesome ""African"" war movies (such as ""Tears of the Sun"") so I was thankful that the novel as well as the movie focused on individual human beings being caught up in the war instead of stoic heroes saving the dark continent.

Maybe I am too critical, expecting too much from a movie adaption. Adichie's novel is an epic work covering many different characters and issues. The movie adaption deals with many of these people and themes only on the surface; thereby failing to create the ""heartfelt"" and intimate connection Adichie so wonderfully establishes in her novels. Aside from that, it is a good solid and educating movie about a country and a people during a civil war; no more, no less.",1406678400,3,3569,4.8990066225165565
6389596,4,B00JS223GU,"Very interesting storyline.  The book has lots of historical references and is interesting.  I struggled with the pronunciation of the names,  it would be helpful to have phonetic spelling.  Each time I encountered a new name I stumbled with the pronunciation.

6389598,4,B00JS223GU,"The 2014 Seattle International Film Festival hosted the acclaimed actor/director Chiwetel Ejiofor (""12 Years a Slave"") on Monday, May 29th @ the Egyptian Theatre. More details were in SIFF Programs.

Okay, let's talk about this drama based on the novel of the same name written by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and directed by BiYi Bandele. It brings us 1960s Nigeria on her shaky path to freedom and democracy. We see news clips from the time with a very young Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip deplaning at the airport and see clips of speeches made by Nigeria's new leaders.

We see:
  * Chiwetel Ejiofor (""Amistad"") as Odenigbo, a college post-graduate who has returned to his homeland to help his country join the world as a new democracy.
  * Thandie Newton (""Rogue"") is Olanna, a highly educated young woman deeply in love with Odenigbo; his mother is NOT in favor of this union! Much of the early tension is from Village -vs- Cosmopolitan cultures. Olanna is described as an ""educated witch.""
  * Anika Noni Rose (""The Good Wife"") is her sister Kainene, another sophisticated, highly educated Nigerian back to help her country make its transition.
  * John Boyega (""Star Wars: Episode VII""!!) Ugwu is the absolute heart of this film, a village boy who lies when he says he can cook rice (he really needs the job!). He becomes the cook, the nanny, the houseboy and the courageous heart of Olanna and Odenigbo's family.

It is one thing to read about the violence taking place in locations like this; it is another thing entirely to have to WATCH it! I found the horrific slaughters to be shocking and upsetting and there were times when I despaired of our folks making it through with their lives. The massacre at the airport was particularly distressing.

I had a lot of trouble making out the details of the political maneuvers because I really needed closed captions. I don't know if others had the same trouble with this excellent film. The DVD from Amazon will solve that problem.",1403913600,6,1987,4.794721407624634

6389602,1,B00JS223GU,"This is a thin copy of the novel. Yes it follows the story-line. The relationships between characters, which were so carefully crafted, have been whittled down to generalizations. The acting is stilted and doesn't ring true. All of the characters' facets have been cut down. The first half of the movie rushes along, trying to depict every major event, without any of the nuances. The director needed to choose, to slow down and create the intricate relationships, even if through small moments. This didn't happen, I didn't really care about the characters.  I could barely get through this movie, the first 30 minutes is over-dramatic, the music is terrible and adds to the soap-opera quality of the film.

I was initially a bit disappointed to see two non-nigerian actresses play Kainene and Olanna, but that quickly faded.  I fell in love with the characters all over again.  I agree, the movie does not do the novel justice.  I am not sure that any production could in a single film, yet this film still delivers.  The cinematography!  The soundtrack!

6389647,3,B00JS223GU,"I finished reading Chimamanda Ngozi Adichies novel Half of a Yellow Sun a day before April 14, 2016, which marks the 2nd anniversary of #BringBackOurGirls. Back in 2014, the militant group Boko Haram kidnapped about 276 Nigerian schoolgirls from the Chibok Government Secondary School in the middle of the night. Over the weekend, Pope Francis also arrived at the isle of Lesbos in Greece to show support to the Syrian refugees. To date, there are 4.6 million refugees from Syria, with 6.6 million displaced within the country after civil war broke out in 2011.

With the news cycle and a heart-wrenching experience with the book, all of these things were on my mind.

Half of a Yellow Sun is a novel set in Nigeria in the 60s   before, during and after the countrys independence, followed by a brutal civil war. The twins Olanna and Kainene are two of the storys main characters, whose lives shift dramatically at every turn of event that rocked the countrys political, economic and social stability.

The twins lives are intertwined: Olanna leads a life with Odenigbo, her revolutionary lover as Kainene calls him, along with a group of intellectuals they drink and opine with in the cool evenings; Kainene opts to run their family businesses along with her lover, an aspiring British writer, Richard Churchhill.

6389663,4,B00JS223GU,"Nine Things About the Film ""Half of a Yellow Sun""

1. This Nigerian movie is basically two short films with the same characters. The first half is a melodramatic romance. The second half is a historical war drama.

2. It's about two upper class, educated Nigerian sisters in the early 1960's and how they shock their traditional parents by shacking up with men that won't help their careers. These romantic choices help determine the roles they play in the Nigerian Civil War at the end of the 1960's.

3. The plot of the first hour is kind of boring as a story, but it's interesting as a character study. The older sister, Olanna, lives with a professor named Odenigbo that likes to imagine himself as a revolutionary. The younger sister, Kainene, runs the family business while sleeping with an English writer named Richard. There is drama, and cheating, and scandal, in both families.

4. While the first hour is a soap opera, it's also helpful in setting up the second hour. The opening scene of the movie shows Nigeria gaining independence from Britain in 1960, which sets lots of other things in motion. In between the family drama, you learn more about how Nigeria works - the geography, the class system, the prejudice and tribal politics.

5. Almost exactly halfway through the movie, the ethnic, economic, and cultural conflicts brewing in the background suddenly become the main story. Odenigbo's tribe, the Igbo people, don't trust the northern government. They carve out a little piece of the country and attempt to secede, declaring themselves the country of Biafra, independent of Nigeria. Everything comes unglued (in real life, over a million people died in this war that lasted about 30 months).

6. The movie attempts to explore topics such as nationalism, tribalism, identity, and what white Westerners are doing in their country. But since half the movie is spent on cheating spouses and relationship politics, there isn't much time for these more complicated ideas.

7. Thandie Newton is a really good actress that has never landed the big role she deserves (I still remember her from ""Beloved""). She does well in this movie, and I was glad to see her again. Chiwetel Ejiofor is another great actor, and he plays Odenigbo with a good mixture of intelligence, stupidity and dumb loyalty (the same year this movie was made, Ejiofor also starred in ""12 Years a Slave"").

8. The movie was filmed in Nigeria, which brings an authentic feel to the events portrayed. But it was strangely shot - it's beautiful, but sometimes looks like a stage play.

9. This isn't a great film, but it's a good one. It's entertaining, educational, and is an example of Africans telling their own history. This two-hour movie taught me more about the world's largest continent than I ever learned in school.",1445644800,3,2805,4.876050420168068

I began watching the movie within minutes of finishing the book and was disappointed that Ugwo's story (family, reading, writing) was missing.  Also, I don't think the movie showed just how much Olanna and Odenigbo suffered from hunger and strife during the war.  So many elements were not included in the movie.  A big however is that the movie captured the essence of the book.  I should have watched the movie first and then read the book.

6389717,3,B00JS223GU,"After Chiwetel Ejiofors work in 12 Years a Slave, I wanted to see whether his career would be interesting enough to follow after his Academy Award nomination. After all, while many Academy Award nominees go on to have careers worth following, like Gabourey Sidibe for example, but at the same time there are also many actors who seem to have peaked with their nomination, and soon after release hardly anything noteworthy. Though, alongside Ejiofor, there is also Thandie Newton and Anika Noni Rose as familiar faces worth noting, as well as John Boyega from Attack the Block who is to have a role in the 2015 Star Wars film. So, with the recognizable names and faces mentioned, lets talk about the movie.

Characters & Story

The story begins in the 1950s when Queen Elizabeth visits Nigeria and we meet Olanna (Thandie Newton) and Kainene (Anika Noni Rose) who are twin daughters of a chief who seemingly lives an upper crust life. Olanna, as well as Kainene, are both well-educated and while Olanna plans to be a lecturer at a local college, Kainene plans to work in a high ranking position within Port Harcourt.

Then the drama sets in. We learn of Olannas boyfriend, a fellow lecturer, Odenigbo (Chiwetel Ejiofor), who isn't highly liked by Kainene and is nicknamed The Revolutionary, and we meet Richard (Joseph Mawle), an English reporter on leave who fancies Kainene. And for most of the movie the focus is the trouble of these two sets of relationships, at least until the Nigerian Civil War. With that, the relationship drama gets thrown in the backseat for surviving becomes imperative, and with Olanna fully committed to Odenigbo, whether poor or rich, we watch as they go through hardship trying to survive in a world in which cultural prejudice has torn their lives apart.

Praise

The story and acting for each and every single person is done so well. Newton and Rose present two sides of a different coin as twins who may have shared a privileged upbringing, but couldn't be more different. Then, when it comes to Ejiofor as Odenigbo, him being a revolutionary isn't seen necessarily in him raising a gun or using bombs, but more so his thinking and conversations. Most of which help provide some sort of insight on why Biafra was made, as well as archival footage making it so it feels that you get a taste of the environment, as well as Nigerias history, as much as the characters.

Leading to a split in praise for Act 1 and Act 2. Act 1 features mostly relationship drama and to me, it felt soap opera like enough to keep you intrigued, but not so overdone it made you roll your eyes. And even when you take away the romantic story of Olanna and Odenigbo, and factor in Ugwu, you are presented a quality story about this kid taken in and seemingly raised like a surrogate son. Then, when it comes to Act 2, it feels like an almost edutainment history lesson. One in which the main points of the Nigerian civil war are noted while an entertaining narrative is given.

Criticism

But I must say, as interesting as this film is, it feels way too long. Which could be a testament to my attention span, or just because as much drama that is in this film, I just feel like no one really grabs a hold of you with their performances. For while heartbreaking things happen, people get passionate about love, politics, and other topics, the actors never transcend from playing a role to presenting people. Due to that, I felt a sort of disconnect which made it so I was more so seeing Ejiofor, Newton, Rose and etc., vs Odenigbo, Olanna, and Kainene.

Overall: TV Viewing

This is the type of film which seems like it would do better as a mini-series. Which I say because sometimes the film just seems like it tried to cram as much as possible, when it comes to the characters, the story, and the history of Nigeria, that it looks like with breathing room it could have been better. Plus, I feel with time it could have made it where the actors could have settled into their roles more and allowed their characters to seem more natural. For, in my opinion, while the performances were good, a part of me also felt like they were performing more so for accolades than to really tell their characters story.

Leading to the main reason this is labeled TV Viewing: It just doesnt keep your attention. For as good as the actors are, and how interesting the story is at times, its hard to stay engaged throughout. Be it because you don't feel like the actors get lost in the characters, the overall length of the film, or maybe even perhaps the unfamiliarity with the history of Nigeria, it leads to you possibly losing interest after awhile and yet coming back just to see how everything ends.",1410566400,3,4699,4.602150537634409

While growing up, my Jamaican father from time to time would mention the horrors of the Biafran war as he recalled it from news stories back when it was happening.  However, as with all other wars, it never had any personal resonance with me.  I've never read anything about the war and really appreciated that this movie brought out its horrors on a micro and macro level.  The shooting scene in the airport especially stands out in my mind.

The casting was exceptional -- especially Ms. Rose and Ms. Newton -- who play sisters whose lives are impacted differently by the war.  I'm glad I watched it although the subject matter is painful.",1410220800,2,716,4.511627906976744

The film is terribly scripted, the characters seem completely out of place in their western outfits, even their skin color seems to have been confused. The script seems to have no point, nothing is developed, the characters lack depth, their accents are English instead of Nigerian. On the whole I missed the richness of Nigerian culture. Having lived in Nigeria I can safely say that Western style dress was not popular after independence and even the wealthy classes wore traditional African clothes. This is clearly a film intended for Western audiences and perhaps as a break away from Nollywood productions but it lacks in substance. I have not read the book, however I am familiar with the work of other contemporary Nigerian writers and if that is anything to go by, then Half a Yellow Sun must also be more interesting than the film adaptation. Seeing as the story is set against the Biafra war, it seems only fair that the producers of this adaptation completely missed the point concerning what conditions must surely have been like at the time.",1408838400,2,1086,4.875675675675676

8653646,3,B00JS223GU,"Too much is missing from the movie to give a four-star review. The acting is great, the filming is great, but the whole point of the book is missed, and too much of the story is missing for the movie to be coherent. In the book, though Olanna and Kainene are twins, Olanna is beautiful and Kainene is not. The dvd case and the movie itself, throw that out the window and claim they are identical beauties. The whole point that one represents old Nigeria and one represents Biafra is obliterated by the meshing of the two. They come from the same parents, but are two different aspects of the same society. Another thing that is almost obliterated is Biafra itself. The name of the part of the  country isn't stated at all until 63 minutes into the  movie. I found that especially strange, almost as if someone was forced to make a movie about a history that someone else wanted to suppress. In the next 4-5 times the country was named, about 3 of those times, the name of the country was almost whispered, said in quiet tones that were incredibly difficult to hear. Genuine news footage was interspersed now and again, providing a really great window into the past. Having bombs go off around the car Olanna and Odenigbo are trying to escape in, and seeing a destroyed village at the end fall extremely short of the devastation described in the book. Ugwu's story is washed away, and the movie portrays Olanna and Odenigbo as not really affected by the war, and not at all by the defeat of the Biafran forces,  as if they were simply living their lives separate from what was happening around them. That flies in the face of the spirit of the book and leaves the audience shrugging its shoulders as to the entire conflict. What a shame.",1529798400,,1736,4.504761904761905
