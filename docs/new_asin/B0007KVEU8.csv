8200299,1,B0007KVEU8,"This DVD is not worth having. I watched it once and that was it. It now is at the Goodwill store. I think George Harrison is a genius too. He is the Beatle that is usually not given enough credit. And we'd like to know more about him. This DVD however doesn't do a good job. For those that truly enjoy George Harrison your money will be much better spent on ""the Concert for George"" DVD and CD or the last album George Harrison put out ""Brainwashed"". These are brilliant! And you'll enjoy them again and again.",1134086400,4,510,4.268041237113402
