7738217,1,B01EKY0FF6,"Pregnant Rachel (Laura Gordon) was apparently abducted by aliens. Her boyfriend Matthew (Michael Finn) tells the story in an institution as a flashback to both the time before she was abducted and afterwards.

The story was boring. He waited for her return and we waited for something to happen and they waited for the last 10 minutes where you see where their $50 budget was spent.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",1468800000,,416,4.763888888888889
7738218,3,B01EKY0FF6,"Intriguing story, but needs help. The storyline sounds intriguing, but it can be confusing at times with flashbacks, dreams and hallucinations. It is also slow at times, but in watching it, as with the main character, Matthew, you really find yourself wondering what is going on, and what is going to happen. For that reason alone, I watched it through to see how it ended. The ending does make it all worthwhile.
  Overall, not a great movie, but not a really bad one. If you're a fan of action, horror and/or sci-fi, you may find this one worth your time.",1466985600,2,557,4.56
7738219,3,B01EKY0FF6,"Nothing less than the continued existence of our species is at stake. But the protagonist Matthew is so happy to get his girlfriend back, he doesn't mind that the aliens returned her without everything screwed back together properly (we've all been there, right?) Or is that what really happened? His psychiatrist doesn't seem to think so. Is the psychiatrist an alien too? Or is Matthew going mental?

PROs
 It's a slow reveal, so viewers who appreciate suspense may appreciate the mystery of the story.
 You are probably wondering if you'll get to see the aliens. Not to give away too much, but... they aren't all hidden off camera.
 Attractive actors (Michael Finn, Laura Gordon,  Rachelle Dimaria ) who also are competent in their craft.
 Taking into account a presumably ""micro"" budget, the rudimentary special effects were acceptable.
 Although I can't speak for horror fans, in my mind the ""bits of horror"" Alien Strain is peppered with were a welcome addition.

CONs
 It's a slow reveal, so viewers who are easily bored... will get bored.
 I felt like I was watching someone else's dream. If I want to dream, I go to bed.
 Although only 82 minutes, this nonetheless may have worked better as a 1-hour television episode; for example, cutting out the whole sheriff plotline would not have diminished the flick.

If you aren't already sick of alien abduction witnesses ending up in mental health institutions &agrave; la American Horror Story: Asylum, then this might be your cup of tea. As a scientist who prefers an evidence-based approach to life, I generally don't go for the whole alien abduction routine unless it's done as comedy. Still, since Alien Strain is fiction, I can appreciate such a tale if it is told well. This one is intentionally disjointed as a mechanism for revealing the narrative, which isn't a bad idea if the story isn't muddled to begin with... but Alien Strain is told through the eyes of a confused mental patient.

Final thoughts: this is the kind of sci-fi flick you watch after midnight. I don't regret it, but I can almost see in my mind's eye the negative reviews Alien Strain will get due to the budget and pace.",1462406400,4,2154,4.804878048780488

7738232,4,B01EKY0FF6,"i liked it because of the alien abduction theme, but it's way too slow and confusing to be great.  There are too many scenes where objects are spliced, jumbled, or just pieced together indiscriminately.  This makes it hard to tell what's really happening to Rachel's body.

7738237,4,B01EKY0FF6,"From the box art I expected a syfy cheesy action movie.

What I got was a slow burn horror drama that's one step above your typical B movie.

I enjoyed it, but can see how those who were swayed by the box art might expect something completely different. This isn't a cheese-fest full of over the top action and acting, but a slow paced drama.",1475712000,4,342,4.246153846153846

8759074,4,B01EKY0FF6,"I thought this was good overall. The four main characters: Matthew, Rachel, Alicia and The Sheriff came across as very strong. The script could have been a tad better and some of the non-essential characters could have been a little less hokey, but the production and creature feature make up was done exceptionally well. I think the obvious hold back was the budget. But overall, this is a decent sci fi flick that should be getting a higher rating. I mean, if you have to click on four stars to tell people you like it, then four stars it is. Give this one a chance. A little slow in parts, but I swear, the acting is good enough.........",1531526400,,640,4.432203389830509
