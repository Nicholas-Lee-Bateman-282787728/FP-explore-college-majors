8446839,5,B004XDYCCM,This artist is amazing. How he manages to achieve the beautiful lights and depths of his landscapes with the dirtiest pallet I've ever seen is a miracle! Not to mention he is wielding a hake brush. He is definitely a magician . I love his presentation and learn something each time I watch his video.,1395792000,2,300,4.472727272727273
8446840,5,B004XDYCCM,I learned some nice techniques from volume 4. Steven shows and talks about his color mixing a bit more which I found very helpful. I feel that I'll be able to come up with similar paintings after watching the video a few times and then practicing the painting a few times. The shipping was quick. Amazon obviously keeps the DVD's in stock.,1382227200,2,339,4.483870967741935
8446841,5,B004XDYCCM,"I've seen Mr. Cronin on YouTube, and his fast and loose style is very inspiring and interesting to watch. I've learned quite a bit from watching several of his demos. His studio setup isn't the most professional-looking, but regardless, the paintings he produces are brilliant and beautiful. I love watching this guy work, and I feel I am ready to now take on watercolor in a way I never thought I could. Thanks, Steven! You're fantastic!",1381795200,,438,4.776315789473684
8446842,5,B004XDYCCM,"Steven's style is laid back, no fuss and easy to follow. He uses a limited palette and only a couple of brushes, a 2 inch hake and a rigger. Occasionally he will use a no. 8 brush. Despite his messy palette he produces some amazing paintings, all landscapes from photographs and sometimes plein air. I would like to see him expand his palette to other colours and even include animals and more people in his landscapes. However his style is a very pleasing realism, and his use of colour, contrast, distance and composition very instructive and helpful to both amateur and intermediate painter. I always enjoys his DVDs and his YouTube demonstrations. In his most recent demos he takes time to explain and speak into the camera more clearly about his use of brushes and colours. I would recommend him and his DVDs to all landscape watercolour artists.",1357516800,3,851,4.756756756756757
