7887748,5,6305310629,"I've got the World Video DVD version of this film.  It's pan and scan, English dubbed, but the image is nice and clear.  The only beef I have is the authoring was poorly done because the image freezes for a couple of seconds as the DVD switches chapters.  Also, at about the half way mark, the chapter count resets to 1, which is strange.
  If you've seen Hell'z Windstaff, which features both Meng Hoi and Hwang Jang Lee, than you'll get a good idea of the pacing of the fight coreography.  It's nice and fast (not Jackie Chan 80's fast, but fast enough), and doesn't rely on undercranking.  The story is pretty the usual Shaolin against Manchu fare.  I didn't like the weapons fighting scene towards the end which had Lung Fei and some other guy up against the protagonist Meng Hoi - I thought it was too slow.  But the finale is awesome.  Also, there aren't as many fight scenes as Hell'z Windstaff, but there are enough to keep the viewer interested.
  A great old school flick with great fight coreography that is real time rather than sped up or using frame cutting to speed up the fights.  Meng Hoi is a very agile, acrobatic martial artist.  Too bad he took a back seat in the 80's by doing coreography planning rather than acting and fighting.",1056153600,4,1252,4.458149779735683
