The place this came from was fast, packed well. Hope to get more movies from them.",1483401600,,236,4.222222222222222
8348147,5,B001YKH3AA,The two DVDs are in excellent condition. The picture sharp and clear. I recommend these great DVDs for everyone who likes to watch movies!,1415750400,,138,4.791666666666667
8348148,3,B001YKH3AA,"Partially through the narrower scope of these two films, a fire contained within a limited area, in one case, and an airplane in the other, they manage to rise above the more ambitious disaster series involving earthquakes, volcanoes and other earth shattering calamities. For the most  part, the acting is pedestrian,  the plotting simplistic and the visual stunts relatively far behind contemporary developments. Still and all, both manage to be entertaining if you can approach them with modest expectations. If you are too accustomed to the star studded, technologically superb, approach to disaster, with exciting additional bonuses, then you will want to avoid these inexpensive offerings.",1374192000,,695,5.547169811320755
