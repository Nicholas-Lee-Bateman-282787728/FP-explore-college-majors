Overall I am very pleased with every title; all of them arrived well packaged, no scratches or shipping problems, exactly as described.  The stories I've watched several times an love them each time.  The impact of multiple genres inside the Black Jack titles is a great mix of horror, drama, comedy, suspense and more - each with their own storyline, well followed and ending perfectly.  Not a lot of ""left in the dark"" from the ""BJ"" series / OVAs, etc.  Highly recommended to any anime watcher, though most I believe should be over 13 at least.",1370563200,,671,4.512396694214876

Black Jak is one of the anime that goes over a perfict 10.

Get them all, but you can wait till the box set is avilable, soon I belive, it will be cheeper this way, as for me I could not wait.",1098144000,3,255,3.618181818181818
