They are down-to-earth punk millionaires and they play a '77-inspired style of  rock'n roll-oriented punk rock, and they are a lean machine at that. Their frontman Campino is in their forties now but has the shape of a 20-year old singer, still stage-diving and climbing stage structures nowadays.

This particular show is from 2001, one of their first filmed shows; they rip through a 2hr, 28-song blistering set of their best songs, with some covers in their very particular style thrown in for good measure. The argy audience is histerical and sing along to their every song, but that is kept out of the mix most of the time, fortunately. The venue is huge and packed to the very last corner. Lighting is mostly stark-white for some reason but there are red and blue-lit scenes as well. The energy deployed is sky-high. Of all the DTH dvds out there (and there are a lot !) this is by far the best one. My copy is in the PAL format but my player converted it no probs.

pic :  nice 4:3 with a good pic bitrate hovering around 7mbps, 5 camera angles, fantastic editing but I had to adjust my gamma control to high to tame the burned whites that threatened to burn my retinas. It turned out the glitch was not attributable to the strong white lighting but it certainly didn't help. Other than that pic was very clear with just some of the shots exhibiting some volume-induced horizontal artifacts; nothing really experience-ruining.

audio : I used the LPCM option as usual, but there are also  5.1 and a DTS options available if you are into surround. Audio is mega-loud but detailed with incredible drum-sound; guitars are a tad overbright, bottom end a tad lacking and the vocals a tad too high in the mix, no deal-breakers of any kind .

Mine came with bonus dvd was uninteresting to me; it consisted of a documentary of the band travelling the country and a multi-angle option for just ONE song, c'mon !!

Conclusion : if you want to sample the band, this is THE dvd to get. Not only depicts an earlier, fresher stage of the band but has the better songs, especially if you can get it on the cheap.",1408838400,,2326,4.495260663507109
