This also has a variety of things happening in Peyton Place that you will find interesting.",1162598400,2,259,4.608695652173913
428742,3,6302000653,"It isn't mandatory that you watch Peyton Place before Return To Peyton Place as the actors are different and some of the characters did not reappear in the sequel. I watched both back to back and Return To... was just as glossy, trashy and colourfully slick as its predecessor.  With a story like this, taking place in a small town full of characters, there  are more than enough stories to interweave.  The audio commentary of Sylvia Stoddard is a great supplement to this dvd. (see also The Best of Everything)  She related stories about Tuesday Weld, Mary Astor and Grace Metalious among many others. This is a well-produced melodrama and I recommend it on that basis.",1131235200,17,671,4.758620689655173
428743,5,6302000653,"I liked this movie! And here's why: It's an exciting film whose content centers around a first-time novelist from a small New England town, a new trip to the big city (New York), and the whirl wind business of book publishing. Carol Lynley stars as the young writer Allison MacKenzie who works with Lewis Jackman(played by Jeff Chandler), a married head of the book firm in the Big Apple of the early 60's. Context really comes into play here, as a variety of top stars end up influencing each other, and Allison herself, who ends up with feelings for Lewis, as well as some she has never experienced before. The beautiful seasons of autumn and winter add to the nostalgic imagery of this movie in the northern states and the hustle and bustle of New York. With the introduction of Allison's new book to the world, she sets the literary world on fire, as well as the people she knows and loves in her own small New England town! Related items would be the first movie Peyton Place(B&W)and the book of the same name by Grace Metallious. While the first movie and the book were good, Return to Peyton Place holds it's own and is even better.",1127174400,6,1139,4.507246376811594
428744,5,6302000653,I found this film to be a perfect sequel to the original film and in many respects it is much better.  Jeff Chandler is excellent in the role of the publisher as is Carol Lynley as the writer.  It would be difficult to appreciate this film not having seen the original though.  So definitely see that one first.  The cinematography is good and the writing was well done.  If you're into melodramas from the fifties and sixties like Back Street and Imitation Of Life then you are sure to enjoy this one.,1125964800,14,502,4.413043478260869
428745,3,6302000653,"""Return To Peyton Place"" is an adequate follow-up to one of the

best soap operas in Hollywood history. The story is not as good,

and the performances are average even for this kind of film. The

best thing about the movie is Mary Astor in a brilliant performance as the Mother From Hell,who finally gets her

comeuppance. Overall,this is a routine but satisfying sequel

worth watching.",1120867200,6,388,4.818181818181818
428746,4,6302000653,"Okay, so it is VERY different from the original PEYTON PLACE, but so was the book! Carol Lynley and Tuesday Weld are gorgeous, adorable and totally enjoyable. Eleanor Parker and Mary Astor are campier than a couple of drag queens. It is kitschy, early 60s soap opera at is best. This should be playing in revival houses as a double bill with the original. Watch for Bob Crane in a cameo role as a talk show sidekick.

Enjoyable commentary by film historian, original theatrical trailer and 2 short movie-tone news reels are fun special features, but it's a pity that Lynley wasn't invited to do a track with her own remembrances...she has great anecdotes!

Beautifully preserved soap fest, best when viewed as a double feature with the original PEYTON PLACE.",1120435200,12,758,4.823076923076923
428747,2,6302000653,"After seeing both Peyton Place and the sequel I can tell you that I could tolerate the recast, Carol Lynley and Tuesday Weld were wonderful in their perspective parts.  But I have to wonder was it only the cast that changed in this sequel did the writers change as well?  My reasons for asking, the glaring inconsistencys to the original movie.  Over and over in this film it is stated that Selena was raped when she was thirteen, yet in the original film Selena, Alison and the others were graduating from high school when the incident occured.  Since when do thirteen year olds graduate from high school, also she looked pretty mature for thirteen.  Then there's Selen'as boyfriend (whose name escapes me at the moment) in the original film he stood by her, through the murder charges, the revelation of the rape, and the miscarriage, yet in the sequel I'm suppose to buy that he couldn't handle any of it dumped her and left town where he met and married someone else.  Then all the towns people after being put in their place by the town Doctor all rallied together at the end of the original film to give their support of Selena, yet in the sequel she is considered the town outcast?  I have nothing against sequels even with recast but this one strayed way too far from its original film that all creditbility for it as a sequel went out the door. It was all too obvious that the original film wasn't taken into account when writing the sequel.  Not credible at all.",1111708800,5,1472,4.528301886792453
428748,1,6302000653,"PEYTON PLACE was a fine movie.  So naturally they did a sequel.

None of the stars of the original returned (they must have known).

The talent-free, Carol Lynley, once again proves that.  The only good thing in this is Mary Astor and they cut her part a lot.

Stick with the original.",1108339200,4,285,4.403846153846154
428749,4,6302000653,"This is an interesting sequel from the point of view that none of the cast  from Peyton Place reprise their roles and the time period seems to have  been moved up 10 or 15 years without the principal characters aging. This  film retains the feel of the original in some of the scenes (especially  behind the credits where many of the pastoral New England shots from the  original were used), but it has a back lot studio look about it in other  scenes. Unlike the original, a good portion of this story takes place in  New York City as it revolves its focus amongst the pairs of main  characters. The story is standard soap opera material, yet it does not fail  to entertain thanks to fine performances from a menacing Mary Astor, a  charming and gracious Jeff Chandler and a noble Robert Sterling. Not to its  detriment nor benefit, the main characters of this piece consist of the  film's younger cast members who's performances are just standard with the  exception of Tuesday Weld. However, the film benefits from beautiful color  photography and Franz Waxman's reworking of his original Peyton Place  score, which is in stereo on this VHS copy.",965865600,36,1149,4.703517587939698

428817,5,6302000653,"I love this movie even more than the original.
The story takes up after Allison writes a story about the events of the 1st movie. The book gets picked up by an editor in New York and eventually published. Meanwhile back home the characters have moved on in their lives. Once the book is on sale in her hometown everyone reads it and even though she changed the names the townspeople were angry. As a sort of revenge they went after Alison's stepfather who is the school principal because he put the book in the high school library. Everyone discusses the book in a town meeting where all the bigotry of the town is brought to the forefront.",1438473600,,640,4.432203389830509
428818,3,6302000653,"A subpar 1961 movie made from a subpar 1959 novel, a sequel-by-contract from Grace Metalious to the bestselling PEYTON PLACE (1956) and smash movie (1957), whose definitive and generally happy endings among numerous relationships between townsfolk of this now-iconic New England village were often torn up or rearranged for the sake of this inferior sequel.  Much of what follows is spoilers and regrets; if you haven't seen the original flick or the original movie, much better to try either first before heading into this disappointment; THEY are top-notch.

As in Grace Metalious' sequel, RETURN tracks young Allison McKenzie (Carol Lynley) as she leaves New England for good to write a potential blockbuster of a novel called SAMUEL'S CASTLE in New York City.  Allison, quite sensibly, flees a Peyton Place mired in the technology of the mid-1940s (leftover Fox props?), operator phones and coupes with clutches, upon whose mountain has been superimposed a contemporary ski lodge (1961) and a modern French car (Renault) driven by a modern Swedish ski instructor (Gunnar Hellstrom) with modern ideas of his own concerning Selena Cross.  Yes, this is the same Selena who was paired off (happily) with Ted Carter at the end of PEYTON PLACE book and novel, but never mind that.  Here Ted (Brett Halsey) has married a sultry but relatively sensible Italian girl (Luciana Paluzzi -- in real life the two actors were married about this time).

Into this slumgullion of leftover Forties props in the town and contemporary, early-Sixties settings atop the ski resort and in New York, comes a thick slice of cheese in its Fifties Momism:  Ted's meddlesome mother (Mary Astor) more reminiscent of ""Little Norman's"" mother in the original, bans SAMUEL'S CASTLE from the library and messes up her son's promising marriage at the same time.  Hard to belive that the original characters in PEYTON PLACE, in retrospect, look noble and community-minded, but there you have it.  Of the major actors, Carol Lynley tries hard but is a too wan and pouty as the freshly published, emotionally starved author Allison McKenzie, Mary Astor insufficiently nuanced, Eleanor Parker creditable but overly imperious, and comes up short in the acting department versus Lana Turner in the original, more's the pity.  Only Jeff Chandler stands out as the gently amused but generally interested middle-aged book publisher who steers Allison into best-sellerdom and then tries to resist her forthright entreaties to drag him into bed.  As I said, this movie is strictly for those who appreciated PEYTON PLACE in its original formats, but don't blame me if this one, with its various rip-offs and mutilations, leaves you scratching your heads -- you've been warned!  Not an absolute stinker, but it does at times seem the folks behind it went out of its way to make it a disappointment.

428889,3,6302000653,"I wasn't exactly expecting great things from the sequel to a shamelessly melodramatic film, but the least it could have done was do some things different...and well. In this followup to PEYTON PLACE (which I actually quite liked), Allison has now gotten a book deal for her first novel, ""Samuel's Castle,"" which is based on her life and the people she knows in Peyton Place. However, after the book gets published (and that, after a long rewriting session), the townspeople don't find it flattering at all. That's basically because everything in the book was covered in the previous film. Despite the soapy and silly nature of the story, it still manages to say a few interesting, if unoriginal, things about small town life, censorship, and progressive values (at least for the time period in which it's set). However, most of this was relegated to a final scene which plays out in much the same way as the courtroom finale of its predecessor. Other positive things to say include that the cinematography, production design and sets were just as good this time around. However, too often this film decides to ride the coattails of what came before instead of exploring new intrigues and problems. Basically, it's dependent on the previous film to a fault. Of course, it doesn't help that none of the original cast is back, for whatever reason. The replacements simply didn't have the talent or charm that the previous cast did. Granted, there are a couple of decent performances, but only a couple. Those are Mary Astor (as Ted Carter's mother), and Tuesday Weld (as Selena Cross). Everyone else gave lifeless performances and amateurish-sounding line readings, living down to the soapy source material. Overall, RETURN TO PEYTON PLACE falls into the trap that many sequels find themselves in: it's content to rehash the previous film without much charm, no originality and, worst of all, a sub-par cast. The only reason I'm giving this three stars is because it was at least visually appealing, but otherwise there's not too much to recommend here. Only see this if soap operas really do it for you.",1427932800,,2101,4.92112676056338
428890,2,6302000653,I purchased this because I enjoyed the original Peyton Place so much.  But this sequel just didn't hold water.  It was suppose to leave off where the original left off and I guess it did in a way but it just wasn't the same.  I don't know if the same person wrote it or what but it wasn't as good.  To give an example of some of the differences from the original there was that one boy who left his over possessive mother to join the paratroopers to fight in WWII.  Well in version the mother is just as over possessive and manipulative except she is now the wealthiest person in the town.  Also  the main  character has to spend some time in NYC but the mother is all worried and doesn't want her to go.  But in the original movie she lived in NYC for a number of years.  The mother is also worried in this version of the movie about her daughter dating a married man as she had done when she was younger.  I just thought this line of thought was tiring from the first movie especially considering that the girl is now a mature woman.  If you never saw the original Peyton Place you may enjoy this movie more than I did.  The actors do a good job.  I just wanted a movie that was more like the original.,1426377600,,1204,4.111587982832618

Allison MacKenzie expects a telephone call or letter from New York (the publishing capital); she wrote a novel. A publishers promises her she will be an overnight sensation. Allison is ecstatic! What effect will it have on her home town? Do people in a small town like unwanted publicity? [The automobiles date this movie. Recognize any?] Ted returns home with a Big Surprise for his mother! Mrs. Carter calls Selena and invites her over. [To make trouble?] Selena quickly leaves. Ted and Raffaelas talk is overheard. Selena has a near accident. [Dont drive if you are emotionally upset.] They show Grand Central Terminal in New York. [Is it still standing?] Who is Max Perkins? Her novel needs editing, more hard work. We see them discussing the novel. Do those buildings still stand in mid-town New York?

There is friction between Raffaela and Mrs. Carter. [Note the hypocrisy!] Do people look for the nastiest explanation in peoples behavior? [Yes.] Allison meets the media (whose job is to push sales of a product). [Were they modeled on real people?] Samuels Castle is the book America is waiting for. Allison learns about NY society. The book is nothing like her original manuscript. But thats what sells books1 Will Roberta Carter use her power to censor this book? [Could Allison be sued for invasion of privacy today?] Could a man be too inquisitive? The School Board removed this book from the school library. There is controversy. Do people feel guilty about this book? Is Ted mature? Teds wife goes skiing on a dangerous run and has an accident. What about the baby? Allison wins an award for Book of the Year. Allisons step-father was fired by the school board.

She returns home. You cant buy back peoples opinions. [Advertising does this every day.] There is trouble for Allison at home. Mike Rossi will try to get his job back. Is Allison wrong in leaving? The Town Selectmen hold a meeting. The Reverend says a prayer. Mrs. Carter explains why Principal Rossi was fired. A compromise is suggested. Lewis Jackman speaks to the Town Meeting. So does Nils Larsson. There is a dramatic statement. Can only outsiders judge Peyton Place? Ted shows his skills as an advocate. Would this book be objectionable if it was about another small town? Selena Cross speaks about the Truth. Shes not ashamed anymore. Are the young people deserting town? [Few job opportunities?] Allisons mother speaks for the majority. Mrs. Carter speaks for the old values, they will regret their action. Allison will remain.

I never read PP or Return to PP as I preferred other types of novels. Is this novel relevant or educational today? There was no mention of the source of Mrs. Carters power and influence. Was she the owner of the only factory that provided employment for many of the townspeople? That explains power and influence in a small town. Many small towns depended on one big employer who wields influence of its employees lives. That is more important than the usual scandals of improper behavior. This is Hollywoods view of small town life; was it realistic. Note there is little mention of any religious influence. Or the lack of television sets in those days. The dislike of Allison can be explained by the jealousy of other people (human nature).

428990,4,6302000653,"I enjoyed PEYTON PLACE when I saw it decades ago and was curious about RETURN TO PEYTON PLACE, which I watched recently. Although not in the same league as its predecessor, Jos&eacute; Ferrer's film is certainly capable of retaining one's interest and does so mostly on account of the contributions of some of the actors.  This is Mary Astor's film, through and through, and it is a pleasure to see the great actress in her last important movie appearance.  Next comes Tuesday Weld, always excellent.  What a pity she was not the protagonist! Eleanor Parker is always good, but she has fewer chances to show her acting skills in a role that gave such a boost to Lana Turner's career.  Jeff Chandler left me indifferent, as did Carol Lynley.  The latter does not have what it takes to be the movie's center of interest.  She belongs to a generation of young actresses, along with Pamela Tiffin, Barbara Parkins, Yvette Mimieux, that never really made an impact on the public consciousness, in spite of their undeniable physical charms. On the whole the film has a made-for-TV look, and does not try to raise itself above the soap opera level.",1403740800,,1141,4.737373737373737

428995,5,6302000653,"As a fan of the original ""Peyton Place"", I was very excited to see a sequel.  In my opinion, it was better than the original in many ways.  Don't get me wrong, I still love the first movie, it's just that it is very rare to see a sequel that lives up to the reputation of the first movie.

The story begins with Allison (carol Lynley) receiving news that the book she wrote about her hometown, Peyton Place, ""Samuel's Castle"" has been published.  But soon we find out that not everyone in the charming and picturesque New England village is happy about reliving the events of a few years earlier when one of the town's residents, Selena Cross (Tuesday Weld) was raped by her stepfather.  She killed him but was later acquitted by a jury for acting in self-defense.  The legal trial ended, but the whole saga sits quite uncomfortably on many of the town's residents-especially the upright, Mrs. Roberta Carter (Mary Astor) who deems Alison's book a ""piece of trash"" and demands that it be taken out of the school's library,  From there we hypocrisy and duplicity on display as Mrs. Carter has trouble on another front: Her only son bringing home a ""foreign bride"" after a hasty ceremony of which she was not informed.

Everyone here is superbly cast, but when I saw Mary Astor, I was just blown away.  The style, elegance, and class of Ms. Astor is abundantly evident in her portrayal of the refined yet sinister Roberta Carter.  In fact, she practically steals every scene she is in and does it so very well.  It was surprising to me that she wasn't nominated for an Academy Award for her performance.  The backdrop and scenery of the film is breathtakingly beautiful.  I wish that there were more films of this caliber made today.  Jose Ferrer does an excellent job of directing as well.

Mary Astor's speech about changing known values for the unknown has a very interesting take to it 50 years later when so much of the kind of life exhibited in this movie is almost as antique to our way of life as the town's telephone switchboard operator in this movie.  The movie is glossy, with not as much location  photography as the original, but with a good cast especially Mary Astor in a truly memorable performance as a bigoted possessive town matriarch and staunch defender of the old, morality. Tuesday Weld is also very good as Selena.  Jeff Chandler, Robert Sterling do good jobs in the male lead roles and Eleanor Parker is fine as Constance. The other younger players give it the old college try and succeed to greater or lesser degrees. Extras on the disc include the prevue, some news reels, language options, and a commentary track which has some interesting things to say but often rambles on and goes far afield from the subject at hand.",1313798400,,1289,4.6607929515418505
429085,5,6302000653,"Although no where near as big a hit at the box office as the original, ""Return To Peyton Place"" came out in 1961 and only grossed a paltry $10,000,000. Many believe this was due to the fact that all of the original stars of ""Peyton Place"" did not want to be a part of the film due to a decrease in their salaries brought on by the costs of ""Cleopatra"". Joan Crawford was set to star in this sequel as Constance MacKenzie replacing Lana Turner, but bowed at at the eleventh hour because she found out producer Jerry Wald had offered her daughter Christina a small part in an Elvis Presley movie.

429151,4,6302000653,"So successful was Fox's 1957 production of ""Peyton Place"", that producer Jerry Wald requested author Grace Metalious to write a sequel (which he bought sight unseen) for another movie.  RETURN TO PEYTON PLACE was released in 1961, though sadly comes up slightly shorter than it's predecessor.

The story picks up a few years after the events of the first film.  Allison MacKenzie (Carol Lynley) earns the scorn of her Peyton Place neighbours when it's revealed her recently-published book, ""Samuel's Castle"", is nothing less than a thinly-veiled depiction of Selena's (Tuesday Weld) ordeal at the hands of her stepfather, and other local scandals.  Scary self-appointed ""morality leader"" Mrs Carter (Mary Astor) leads the charge for the book to be excluded from the school library, which could also result in the dismissal of Allison's stepfather Mike (Robert Sterling) from his post as principal.

Money was the main reason why Lana Turner never returned to play Constance in the second movie.  Fox was beginning to feel the pinch of the expensive ""Cleopatra"" shoot and simply couldn't afford her increased salary demands.  Three-time Academy Award-nominee Eleanor Parker (""Caged!"", ""Detective Story"", ""Interrupted Melody"") was actually a trade above Lana Turner in terms of career prestige, yet the character of Connie sadly never really goes anywhere in this film.

Wald also wanted to bring back Diane Varsi and Hope Lange to reprise their roles of Allison and Selena, and again was met by resistance.  Varsi had quickly tired of Hollywood and left town, breaking her lucrative contract in the process; and Ms Lange told Wald in no uncertain terms that she never wanted to play Selena again.  Happily, their replacements (fresh Fox contractees of the time) acquit themselves well; Carol Lynley is an especially-poised and lovely Allison.

Grace Metalious saved all her venom for the character of Mrs Roberta Carter, arguably the nastiest piece of work in all of New England!  Mary Astor earned rave reviews for her performance, which turned out to be one of her last big movie roles.  Luciana Paluzzi, Brett Halsey, Jeff Chandler and Gunnar Hellstrm co-star.

Fox brings RETURN TO PEYTON PLACE to DVD with a clutch of worthwhile extras, beginning with an audio commentary hosted by movie historian Sylvia Stoddard.  MovieTone news, restoration comparisons, the theatrical trailer, plus sneak peeks at other titles in the Fox Studio Classics range.  Recommended.",1256774400,,2465,5.282051282051282
429152,3,6302000653,"The much anticipated sequel to the 1957 box office sensation, somewhat rests in the middle of being a success and a failure.  Most lamentably, none of the cast members of the original film reprises their roles, for whatever varying reasons, nor does the original director, Mark Robson.  Miscasting and changes from the novel may account for some of the movie's awkwardness, but the quality of the performances and the last scene involving the town meeting which again, exposes the truth and the bigoted views of the townspeople, elevates it above other film sequels that suffered similar blows of comparison.  Conversely, the fact that entirely different locations and sets are used, also gives the movie a sense of unfamiliarity - Mamouth, California for the ski lodge scenes, Fox's Malibu Ranch and backlots for the remainder of interiors and exteriors - the rest of the footage comes from the 1959 film ""The Best Of Everything"" (New York) and the first movie.

Allison MacKenzie (Carol Lynley) publishes an autobiographical novel, Samuel's Castle, based on her hometown of Peyton Place and the people she knows.  She becomes romantically involved with Lewis Jackman (Jeff Chandler), her married publisher.  He encourages her to be as truthful as possible and never to be frightened of it.  But that's not the only repercussion that her book incites - the locals are offended by the truths that Allison's tome reveals.  Her mother Constance (Eleanor Parker) is both angry and fearful of both her daughter's expose and of history repeating itself, while her husband Mike Rossi (Robert Sterling) refuses to remove the book from the school library and as a result, his job as principal is put in jeopardy.  It also touches Allison's friend Selena Cross (Tuesday Weld), as she begins a relationship with a ski instructor, Nils Larson (Gunnar Hellstrom), when reading aloud passages of the novel cause Selena to flashback to the night she killed her stepfather in self-defense.  And Ted Carter's (Brett Halsey) marriage to the fiery Raffaela (Luciana Paluzzi) is on the rocks thanks to his meddlesome, evil mother Roberta (Mary Astor), whose bigoted view of her daughter-in-law and determination to keep her son in her clutches has tragic consequences.  Conflict ensues as Allison achieves literary fame and Connie's need to control her daughter surfaces yet again, climaxing in a showdown during a town forum in which the truth is again told, much to the dismay of Roberta, who is also on a mission to keep up the facade of moralistic hypocrisy.

Astor excels as the villianous matriarch, while Parker does a great job of taking on a role made famous by Lana Turner.  Chandler is sufficent support but on occasion seems lost in the shuffle, while Lynley does a commendable turn as Allison, but she cannot eclipse the fine characterization of Diane Varsi.  Halsey and Paluzzi were married at the time, which may or may not have factored into the casting, since Ted's wife in the novel was a woman from Boston named Jennifer rather than being an Italian model.  Hellstrom, playing a role that was originally that of a summer stock actor, is a bit out of place (although quite humorous), and his jealousy of any man in Selena's life is alarming and distracting, while Sterling is respectable as Mike, who supports Allison and stands his ground.  But by far the standout performance is that of Weld, who exceeds in touching the tormented past of Selena, never more so than in the scene where the past plays out in front of her, causing her to attack her boyfriend, and later resurfacing during the meeting, confronting the locals regarding their unfair treatment of her and Allison revelations of the hidden side of Peyton Place.  While Selena has a significantly smaller role than in the original (it's interesting that both Weld and Hope Lange, who originated the character of Selena, would costar the same year in the Elvis Presley vehicle ""Wild In The Country""), and does not compare to Lange's portrayal, it still makes the film watchable.  The lovely score of Peyton Place has had lyrics added and wonderfully sung by Rosemary Clooney, who was then married to the film's director, Jose Ferrer.  Some characters were eliminated, and it's a shame since it would have been great to see what became of Norman Page, Betty Anderson, the Harringtons, Doc Swain and Mrs. Thornton.  There are also several inconsistencies that do not make sense or match with the film's predecessor.  Selena and Ted were just friends?  They wanted to get married, and since when is Ted wealthy?  What happened to him having to save for law school?  Selena was raped by her stepfather at 13?  No, she was graduating from high school that same year, and since when was Lucas Cross called Luke?  The story is also not entirely true to the period (post WWII).  Sylvia Stoddard's commentary is enjoyable and informative, especially considering that she attended the Hollywood Professional School with Weld.  Watch for Bob Crane's unbilled appearance.  A moderate success at the boxoffice, Return To Peyton Place can never surpass the glory of the original, but it is intriguingly flawed, and an interesting follow-up.",1208736000,10,5186,5.0046565774155995

I understand that the young people were all upset about the hyprocrosy by the adults that lived in that town, and it was good that the book they were all up in arms about was written, but the truth of the matter is... a little bit of immorality goes a long way. Back then, I'm sure that movie had tongues wagging and we laugh at it now because we have seen so much more scandalous things in movie theatres since then.

429156,5,6302000653,"Return to Peyton Place begins with Rosemary Clooney singing the beautiful title song,(she sings it faboulously, and she is featured here because her then husband Jose Ferrer is the director (also see his State Fair..a hilarious mess) the Franz Waxman melody that enhanced so much of the 1957 film, Peyton Place. Then you get a whole new cast, and Carol Lynley, writing a book about Peyton Place with Jeff Chandler. She and he are 'artists"", and they have to deal with Mary Astor, a pillar of morality in Peyton Place. Her performance is not to be missed; it is a thorough lesson in screen acting, lessons she shared with Bette Davis years before. If you are curious about how to dominate a low end script, watch Ms. Astor do it.

Then there is Tuesday Weld, who should have been cast as Allison but is Salina Cross and very good in her scenes with Mary Astor. She(Weld) has some harrowing moments in trying to defend herself from charges of lustiness with certain folk in Peyton Place. Eleanor Parker is the new Connie and she is not as good as Lana Turner, but she has moments with Lynley that define a new kind of melodrammatic acting..so over the top Everest would be a mole hill here. . Also, Lucianna Paluzzi is here, with her Italian ways,her accent is so thick she is mostly incomprehensible,  and she is driven to ,literally, the heights and depths of despair. Her scenes with Mary Astor are seering moments of sado-masochistic behavior.  Bret Halsey, an actor with incredible limitations, is puddy for Mary Astor, who plays his mother. Robert Sterling as Parker's officious husband, and principal of Peyton Place High School, is an unintentional bore and has odd facial expressions and an aversion to E. Parker that makes one wonder.

The ending of Return To Peyton Place is a treasure of great and bad acting..terrible direction, and incredible style and talent, complments of Ms. Astor, on how to do the whole thing and take the film away from everyone.

There's a lurid quality to it all, and this sequel is not as polite as the first Peyton Place(a very good film). This sequel shows Peyton Place to be a really disturbed town within, like Black Rock in Bad Day At Black Rock.

The mentality of all of them is small and pornographic, and Allison's book about the past goings on is the sum total of the town itself,illiterate, mean spirited and low vibration, and Allison is like this herself, splitting infinitives, her verb tenses all mixed up, and her continuous pouting and constant referral in every crisis to sexual repression.  The book (written in the film)is, in an odd way, the best the town could ever do in this regard.  In this sense Allison is more Peyton Place than anyone else; she is proud of her bad book, and wants to build a new Peyton Place on it.

See this film on DVD, and enjoy all of its craziness. You will not forget Mary Astor. Also check out the talk shopw scene with Lynley and the dubbing of the host by Jose Ferrer..unbelievable, and this man worked with David Lean.",1171411200,4,3010,4.632270168855535
