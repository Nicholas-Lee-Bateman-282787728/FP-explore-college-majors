8493344,3,B00658QJ0Q,Good concert but Rod has better ones. The sound and band are only a 6 or 7 out of ten.  royal Albert Hall concert is much superior to this one.,1383609600,3,143,3.7666666666666666
8493345,5,B00658QJ0Q,"This dvd is not ever bad in fact it's good, very,very good!  The performance is filmed by a company in Argentina, appears to have not been at Times Square in New York, and there is nention by Rod to ""Noki,Noki,Noki, which sounds Japanese!  But Rod Stewart is wonderfull as always.  The scene looks to be a moderate sized hall-wherever it is. Interesting concert as Rod has assembled a diverse ensemle of musician: a violinist, steel pedal guitar, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, 2 drummers and back up singers-4 of them, Black gospel style and that's always GOOD!  Rod chose a real variety of songs, and because he is on a rather small stage he appears in a rather  intimate way. The concert is truly enjoyable  one all the way!!",1366934400,4,731,4.671875
