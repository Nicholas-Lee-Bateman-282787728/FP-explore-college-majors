4684440,3,B005FQ2GW4,"I thought I noticed a drop in video quality when I viewed the 3 bonus tracks. After looking at the back cover, I see why. They are 480i SD. Also, the bonus tracks are stereo only. For such a short Blu-ray disc, they certainly could have made it all HD and 5.1. At least, there is not much of a premium in price for the Blu-ray over the DVD.",1357862400,,340,3.9420289855072466
4684441,4,B005FQ2GW4,"a must have if you are Windwood's fan. Picture and sound quality are good, no complain at all. Glad I have it.",1335225600,2,110,4.045454545454546
4684442,3,B005FQ2GW4,"First off - I love Steve Winwood, especially his stuff with Traffic and his newest album - Nine Lives.  So I really enjoyed most of the songs on this DVD.  The picture quality is obviously 1080p.  DTS sound is available and is superb.  However, this is a very short set.  I can't believe they put out a DVD that's only about as long as a 45 minutes long.  I probably wouldn't have paid as much if I would've known this.

Track listing: Can't find my way Home, Empty Pages, Bully, Glad, Freedom Rider, Back in the High Life (ugh), Dear Mr. Fantasy, and Why Can't we Live Together.  All very short versions, to the point, with very little jamming.",1329436800,5,645,4.361344537815126
4684443,5,B005FQ2GW4,"Wow, just wow!!!  This is excellent.  Five skilled musicians at the peak of the game and enjoying themselves.  Lots of attention to acoustics and the stage is beautiful. Audio is crystal clear and well mixed.  Solid camera work.  I highly recommend!",1324512000,5,249,4.975609756097561
4684444,5,B005FQ2GW4,"This is the same concert released in DVD format around 2006, no new tunes, no extra material, no interviews, no bonuses. Now, there may not be much difference in sound quality between DVD and BR, you'd need either to be quite young, to (still) have very good hearing or own a super Hi-Fi set to notice any significant improvement. But the full HD video makes the whole difference. Be aware though,  there's no cheap way to remove all the imperfections of the master video tape and surely this transfer didn't attempt to do it. The picture is extremely grainy in many parts and throughout the concert you get different color temperatures coming from the stage lights (from bluish at the beginning to red-orange near the end). But this is an old show so what would you expect. I already had the DVD and now I bought the BR disc happily. This is one of my favorites taped performances and I'm glad they finally put it out on Blu Ray.",1323302400,11,930,4.502958579881657
4684445,5,B005FQ2GW4,"I was a little apprehensive as to the date of this recording.
Taken from the Album ""About Time"".
Coined by Eric Clapton as one of the best performers ever!
Abeit a little short in tracks this Blu-ray will not disappoint.",1322179200,5,220,4.525
4684446,3,B005FQ2GW4,Very nice audio. So many songs missing. Low spark would have been great.the bonus songs are poor quality.this would be a five star if was full length.,1424563200,,150,4.592592592592593
4684447,5,B005FQ2GW4,Well recorded and produced Steve Winwood DVD.  If you want to delve deeper that the Eric Clapton & Steve Winwood DVD this is a good next step.  Incredible Musician.,1424304000,,164,4.620689655172414

4684453,4,B005FQ2GW4,I like the sound of this band a lot.  Steve has still got it.  He's one of my all time favorites but this show is kind of a rip because it is so short. not even an hour long.  For a Blu ray that is not good at all.  4 stars because it sounds so good.,1368835200,,250,3.4107142857142856
4684454,3,B005FQ2GW4,"Steve Winwood performs well in this show but the set of songs is too short. Also like most of these Sound Stage Blu Rays the lighting is cheap, bland and boring. And frankly everyone in the band including Steve is poorly dressed. While Winwood fans are more about his music than any style he may or may not show, when he is so drably dressed it calls negative attention to itself and does ruin what could have been an amazing Blu Ray experience. I mean these guys knew they were going to be on camera right? So why not light the stage more interestingly and get some kind of style in the wardrobe. One final tech note -- audio sounds fine overall but lacks depth and dynamic range.",1367798400,,681,4.328125
4684455,5,B005FQ2GW4,Love love love Steve Winwood. a great concert bluray. Watch it on a tv with good surround sound...next best thing to going to a concert!,1358467200,,136,4.48
8470470,5,B005FQ2GW4,"Slightly raw, but thats the way i like it(also thats what you get with a live performance),very happy to include this blu ray into my Winwood/Clapton collection! Very competent back up band brought out a guy, who always to me, seems to shy to consider himself one of the greats! He's not coy--just demure!",1500249600,,305,4.666666666666667
