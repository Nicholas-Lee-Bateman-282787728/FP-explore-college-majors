1047200,5,6305570051,"This film verson of Virginia Woolf's meditation on the relative nature of time and space, on the passing of the empire where the sun never sets (the Indian trouble is here in the offing) is superb.  Is Clarissa Dalloway's party one of the empire's final celebratory moments? The passing of the old, pre-World War One lifestyle is richly evoked, as is the anxiety of the principals as they head into desuetude and hand over the reins to such as Miss Kilman and those whom Lady Bruxton would exile to Canada.  The casting is excellent, with Vanessa Redgrave, Michael Kitchen, Robert Hardy and Margaret Tyzack among the notables; Rupert Graves as Septimus Smith is simply beyond praise.  This is a superb viewing experience in every way.",1036713600,9,734,4.856
1047201,5,6305570051,"This 1997 film stars Vanessa Redgrave as Mrs. Dalloway, the Englishwoman introduced in Virginia Woolf's 1925 novel.  The book used stream of consciousness to create an interior monologue for her heroine and the film is true to that, a voice-over narration letting the viewer know her interior thoughts as she goes about preparing for a party in 1923.
Mrs. Dalloway is now in her sixties, but there are flashbacks to an earlier time, when she was a young woman being pursued by beaus.  She has made her choices now and has married a cabinet member and leads a comfortable life as his charming wife.  In her youth she rejected the suitor who looked for adventure in India as well as the tentative hint of a friendship with a woman, which might have gone further.  When both of them show up at her party, her memories surface.  There's also a sub-story of a young man who has been shell-shocked from combat in The Great War and the theme of suicide runs strong throughout the plot.  Even though he and Mrs. Dalloway never meet, it is clear why this character was introduced.  And it is also interesting to note that Virginia Woolf herself committed suicide in 1941 at the age of 59.
Casting is excellent, acting superb.  Everything is understated but yet very very clear.  I also loved the cinematography and the setting of a very proper London in 1923, especially the costumes.  The theme is universal as we all do look back on our lives and wonder what might have been.  Also, at only 97 minutes long, the video was exactly the right length. Definitely  recommended.",995155200,113,1565,4.650909090909091
1047202,2,6305570051,"Mrs. Dalloway
This British period-drama is based on the book by Virginia Woolf, a fact that comes before any of the actors or the director needs to be mentioned. This is because the fundamental flaw of this film is that it  seems rooted in its original format. In between the dialouge (probably  lifted straight from the book), unneccessary voiceovers by the characters  explain their thoughts to the viewer, using long and overly descriptive  text from the book. Must it be explained that a film adaptions job is not  just to replace the description with pictures (which, judging by the  voiceovers, this film does not even manage) but to interpret and give life  to a novel. And surely an actors job is to portray a characters emotions,  not just to stand there as they are reeled off over his or her head, which  is what they spend a lot of time doing. Indeed, many of the performances  are somewhat wooden, surpising from what appeared to be an accomplished, if  small time, group of Brits (Vanessa Redgrave, Rupert Graves, Michael  Kitchen).And then there is the story. Although mildly interesting in  itself, if a bit unful filling, the film goes at an angishingly slow pace,  and the feminist 'undertones' of the novel stick out from the dialouge like  a sore thum. To say one thing in its favour, the period setting looks  great, but the overall impression was less of a film and more of a novel  with pictures. And, by the looks of it, not a very good novel to begin  with.

1047203,5,6305570051,"I never imagined a book such as Mrs. Dalloway could be effectively adapted into film...until now. What a lark! What a plunge! Indeed... I found almost all of the characters casted for this film nearly perfect -- and of course,  in my opinion, no one could play Mrs. Dalloway so subtly and touchingly as  Vanessa Redgrave.  What touched me most about the movie were the  tantalizing returns to the youthful past, where young Clarissa plays about,  laughs, and trades amusing remarks with her friends Sally and Peter Walsh,  the man who who loves her helplessly, passionately. It's a moving book, and  the movie does justice to the complicated and intertwined ironies of life.  As an immense fan of Virginia's work, I must say the telling moment of  Sally's kiss is incredibly well done.

1047290,5,6305570051,"I came to this film from a lecture on the Western Cannon. I am still in the middle of reading the ""Mrs. Dalloway Reader."" I thought I would take a break and watch the movie.

Adapted from the novel by Virginia Woolf, is a screen play by Eileen Atkins. A lot of the dialog is directly from the book. Of course some things have to be different just to turn the story into a movie instead of a lecture.

The story is a lot more complete and in-depth than I can reveal in a short review.  However it is London, summer 1923. We take part in a day in Mrs. Clarissa Dalloway's life when she (Vanessa Redgrave) is about to have a party and meet old friends. Here through a series of flashbacks she contemplates on the choices she made in life.

On a side note, with all the different major actors in the movie one has a tendency to think ""Now where have I seen him/her act before?"" Luckily everyone plays his/her part so well that you soon forget the actor and empathize with the character.

The only thing that really bothered me was watching Evans (Richard Bradshaw) being dispatched in Septimus Warren Smith's (Rupert Graves) mind. They called PTSD shell-shock. I understand that it was a quite necessary part of the movie. I never had PTSD, but being surrounded by it, this came too close to home.

1047391,4,6305570051,"Having just watched, and reviewed, The Remains of the Day, I can tell you for my money Mrs. Dalloway is a better film, not the least because it is shorter, is exactly the right length, maybe 100 minutes. The theme is largely the same: what might have been. But with Mrs. Dalloway at least she made a choice -- Stevens in Remains makes none -- and has made a life that is at least worthy and worthwhile if only because she has her youth to play against. She will always wonder if she made the right decision, she will always wonder what it might have been like to have spent the night in the naked arms of Sally, a wonderful Lena Heady (Waterland, her best role), but at least she has that to wonder about. Stevens has nothing to wonder about.

Redgrave really is one of those very fine actors who deserves the accolades. I twice tried to finish reading The Atonement but was unable; it is a good film, however, and Redgrave's cameo at the end simply brilliant. This is at least the third film I know of where Redgrave's character looks back, which is I guess what she's left with at her age.

1047399,5,6305570051,"Eileen Atkins screenplay based on the classic modernist novel by Virginia Woolf is about as close as a screenwritter can get to duplicate the tone and dialouge, including following the novel's plot from the start to its interesting conclusion.

Vanessa Redgrave was perfect casting for the older Clarissa Dalloway and the beautiful Natascha McElhone as the young Clarissa, too, a good casting choice.

Virginia Woolf's novel was very controversial at the time of it publication due to its style and structure, writng the novel in a non-linear fashion, breaking away from Realism, and using the thoughts of its character's rather than actual dialouge to move the story along. This book is considered by many scholars to be one of the top ten modernist novels of the 20th century along side James Joyce's ""Ulysses and Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain.

All the performances in this film I believe were flawless. In particular Rupert Graves as Septimas Warren Smith, the shell shocked, damaged solider caused by his horrific experiences in WW1. Graves' apparent seemless forward and backward states of momentary lucidity and madness was quite impressive.

The novel and film approach many themes: love, art, the failings of the medical profession and our ignorance of psychology, the pomposity of the English Middle Class, sexuality etc. Not only did Woolf change the structure of the novel but also included then considered anathema subjects simply not talked about and never written...bad taste.

1047464,4,6305570051,"I recommend this film as an afterthought to the original novel by Virginia Woolf; it will clarify any confusion and bring an intimacy to Woolf's wordy explanations.

Mrs. Dalloway (Vanessa Redgrave/Natascha McElhone) begins her day on a journey to buy flowers for her party. Along the way she encounters a mysterious man ravaged by the memory of war named Septimus Warren Smith (Rupert Graves) who will become a factor towards the end of her delightful day of contemplation. Clarissa Dalloway meets a man from her past, Peter Walsh (Michael Kitchen/Alan Cox) and memories of her exuberant youth flood her with thoughts as she goes about her day as an English upper crust wife. Added to Clarissa's memories are thoughts of her long lost friend Sally (Sarah Badel/Lena Headley) a young woman who once embraced the immaturity of whims. So that in the end a day of celebration becomes a deeper exploration into life than Mrs. Dalloway could have ever expected.

Virginia Woolf wrote the original novel, ""Mrs. Dalloway,"" in 1925 and she intentionally wanted to stir a contemplated thought process into the art of a novel. She succeeded in that her novel is considered a modern classic and is timeless but extraordinarily complicated. However once read I believe that this film will bring about a closeness to Woolf's original characters and some closure to the reading experience. The actors in this film are all very good with a few standouts like, Redgrave, Graves and McElhone. Thankfully the film stays very close to the original novel and any changes are more of an awakening thought than true alterations. Add ""The Hours,"" (novel/DVD) as an added exploration into Woolf's mind as a writer.",1101427200,12,1690,5.01067615658363
1047465,4,6305570051,"Virginia Woolf's novel ""Mrs. Dalloway"" examines one day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway, in which the title character prepares for a party and looks back on the point in her life when she choose Richard Dalloway over Peter Walsh.  Meanwhile, the mentally ill war veteran Septimus Warren Smith spends his last day on earth.  The action of the novel exists primarily in the consciousness of the characters, for the story itself is essentially plotless and written in the stream-of-consciousness style of James Joyce.  Although written in the omniscient third-person voice, Woolf manages to enter the consciousness of her various characters, who are not as unconnected as they might seem to be, and reveal their feelings.

Translating this novel to the screen requires that it be done by those who have a strong understanding and affection for the authors and her characters.  Vanessa Redgrave is clearly one of those people and she commissioned Eileen Atkins to write the script so that she could play the title character.  Atkins is a Woolf scholar who not only played the author in a one-woman stage piece but also wrote ""Vita and Virginia,"" in which she and Redgrave played Woolf and her lover Vita Sackville-West.  Atkins chooses to allow us only into the inner thoughts of Mrs. Dalloway, using voice-over narration to reveal the thoughts that she would never speak out loud.  Those who have read the novel might not enjoy the film more than those who have not, since there are always limitations with bringing any literary masterpiece to the screen, but they will certainly understand it more, especially the first part of the film.

A strength of this 1997 film is how easily we accept that Natascha McElhone as the young Clarissa grows up to be Vanessa Redgrave's Mrs. Dalloway.  It is young Clarissa who chooses young Richard (Robert Portal) over not only young Peter (Alan Cox), but also over young Sally Selton (Lena Headey), whose kiss bespeaks something that is not going to even be thought about.  Now Richard Dalloway (John Standing) is a cabinet official, Peter Walsh (Michael Kitchen) has come home from India, and Sally is now Lady Rosseter (Sarah Badel).  Of course Mrs. Dalloway's thoughts go back to her fateful decision, made over the objections of her friends, when she accepted her life of comfortable sameness.  But her concern over the evening's party is just as big of a concern.  For those who are trying to figure out the point of the story the seemingly unrelated plotline involving Septimus Smith (Rupert Graves) and his Italian wife (Amelia Bullmore) helps the pieces come together, especially once Mrs. Dalloway's thoughts provide the big picture.

Dutch filmmaker Marleen Gorris, who won as Oscar for ""Antonia's Line,"" brings this film in at 97 minutes and while I think ""Mrs. Dalloway"" the film captures the essence of the novel, I cannot find it approaches the depth.  What makes the novel profound is not the end point that it reaches when we reach the close of a day in the life of Clarissa Dallowy, but the journey through her jumbled thoughts.  For Christmas I gave my eldest daughter the movie ""The Hours"" along with the Michael Cunningham novel and Woolf's ""Mrs. Dalloway,"" and I would think others would benefit from immersing themselves in the works of, and about, Virginia Woolf.",1096070400,18,3322,4.946043165467626
1047466,5,6305570051,"Virginia Woolf was introduced to me through ""A Room of One's Own,"" in a Women's Studies class. It seemed dry and rather dated. It was not until I saw Mrs. Dalloway that I opened up to Woolf as a writer. This adaptation is so often true to the book, and more importantly, true to the intentions of the book, that I have become a huge fan of Woolf. (Still hate ""Room,"" however.) Few movies are truly able to bring great literature to the masses while retaining the essence of the book and author. Mrs. Dalloway is that rare movie that forces non-Woolf fans to rush out and read all that she has written. As a lover of books, I recommend that every bibliophile and/or movie goer watch this. It rekindles great ideals and touched the heart of every person who watches the movie or reads the book.",1095638400,2,792,4.394557823129252
1047467,5,6305570051,"Having watched Mrs. Dalloway after having looked for it for at least three years, I can only say that I am breathless: True to Virginia Woolf's narrative, attentive to every detail, and with such subtlety is this movie made that I could find no better gift than this movie to a lover of Virginia Woolf's works. Vanessa Redgrave astounds with her incredibly moving performance, with a dignified emotiveness as only she can deliver- true to the bird-like Mrs. Dalloway.
Fans of explosions and other short-attention-grabbers need not apply, this is prime literature jumping onto the movie screen!",1079740800,7,593,5.123711340206185
1047468,4,6305570051,"Vanessa Redgrave gives a fine performance as Clarissa Dalloway in Marleen Gorris' adaptation of the Virginia Woolf novel.  It tells the story of one day inthe life of Clarissa Dalloway as she readies her house for a dinner party later in the evening.  Throughout the day, she remembers people and events from her past that had a lasting effect on her.  But, during her party, the news of a suicide causes Mrs. Dalloway to step aside and to wonder if she's given up anything with her own life's path.
Ms. Redgrave's performance is subtle and really shines during the party sequence.  Her facial expressions alone show what a fine actress she is.  Other great performances in the film are Rupert Graves as Septimus, a soldier suffering from a late onset of shell shock, and Alan Cox, as the young Peter who was desparately in love with the young Clarissa.
Not many extras on the DVD.  But the film is self is definitely one to watch.",1063584000,3,931,4.612121212121212
1047469,5,6305570051,"MRS. DALLOWAY, the film, has a jolting beginning: the battlefield of WWI with a scene revealing Septimus Warren-Smith in abject terror that his friend  Evans is about to walk into a mine explosion, a recurring memory for this character throughout the film.  One wonders how MRS DALLOWAY could start there - until the story gradually unfolds.  Then this seeming idiosyncrasy is shown to be just one more bit of evidence that the screenwriter is very in tune with the meadering writing style of Virginia Woolf.  What a joy to see a novel of such sophisticated complexity be adapted into a movie that is fluid, rich in characterization, thoroughly grounded in the technique of how Woolf mixed memory with present reality in her telling such an indepth history of a woman a bit out of synch with her world, all in one day in June, 1923, as she prepares one of her beloved parties.  Indeed, this film suggests that life is a 'party' where new acquaintances are made, old acquaintances are at times tolerated for social reasons, and the entirety of one's past can be summoned by the surprise appearance of signifcant people.  This film is blessed with the presence of Vanessa Redgrave whose Mrs Dalloway is wholly credible. But the integration of Clarissa Dalloway's past with her present is so adroit that all of the characters in the present are greatly enhanced.  Her love of Peter Walsh and of Sally say a lot about Virginia Woolf's ability to define  the inner aspects of her character.  Oh, and by the way, the beginning of the film introduces the thread that runs throughout - Septimus elects suicide as an answer to his life's questions, and we are left wondering if this might not be a viable thought running through the mind of Clarissa Dalloway as she reflects on her life choices at the end.  A brilliant cast of characters, in every role, dressed to perfection and photographed in echt, period England further enhance this wonderful film.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1053043200,13,1966,4.821428571428571
1047470,5,6305570051,"Vanessa Redgrave gives a spectacular performance in this DVD Mrs. Dalloway with grace and beauty. This story is Virginia's masterpiece that put her in the forefront of the literary community and helped establish her as a genunine story teller with great talent. She does not write linearly, she writes with the new style she introduced where she believed she could tell much about a character in a single day of their life through memories, flash backs, concurrent synchronicity events, etc. She opens a literary style that touches on the phenomenon of synchronicity.

Michael Cunningham cleverly took that title and turned into a novel that matches Mrs. Dalloway for its shear beauty. But this is a movie review and I can tell you that Vanessa Redgrave is brilliant in the title role. She should have been nominated for an Oscar at the very least. A day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway, planning a party, remembering her life and loves. It's a lovely adaptation from Woolf's novel. And of course begins with ""Mrs. Dalloway decided she would buy the flowers herself."" Buy this  yourself. You won't regret it.",1042329600,57,712,4.606299212598425

Beautifully crafted, shot and directed, this is a superb little picture, starring an excellent Vanessa Redgrave and Natascha McElhone. Its a witty, delicate and emotional day in the life of a 1920's society lady, reminiscing about the days when she were younger. Thoughtful, intelligient drama. Highly recommended (especially for someone who feels they want to watch something easy, enjoyable and quiet to watch).",1042243200,4,501,5.435897435897436

7891489,5,6305570051,"This reviewer saw Marleen Gorris's 1997 film ""Mrs Dalloway,"" after the novel by Virginia Woolf, when it was new, and it has haunted him ever since, much like the characters here are haunted by their own pasts.

Woolf's prose is deceptively clear, while actually concerning itself with many of the issues which emerged into greater prominence as the Twentieth Century proceeded.  The casting here is exemplary.  Vanessa Redgrave has a exceptional manner of allowing her audience to sense complexities beneath a serene exterior, which makes her ideal for the title role of this woman, who is hosting a party.

Rupert Graves portrays Septimus Warren Smith, a poet who is now trapped in a marriage and suffers from ""delayed shell-shock"" five years after the portentous conclusion to World War I.  He saw his best friend die before his eyes on the battlefield, and has now descended into psychosis.  Mr Graves, who has given us a beautiful array of characterizations on stage and on film, is brilliant as Septimus, who takes his own life after listening to a recording of the aria ""Addio, del passato"" from ""La traviata.""

The fact that this important film was a financial failure can only be taken as a condemnation of the antics of the film industry and the bad taste of the cinematic public.",1513900800,2,1289,4.885321100917431
