1232940,2,B00000JKXX,"Texas fought and won it's Independence from Mexico for ten years and that was given the short shrift in this video. Only a three word sentence.

This video is the typical nonsense that you get from Liberal professors and PBS.
The Texians (no, this is not a spelling error), who had been invited & encouraged to settle Texas' vast & mostly unpopulated lands by the Mexican government, joined with with native hispanic Tejano populations only (about 2,500) in the whole of Texas California up to Oregon,were in open rebellion against Mexico after having personal/civil rights revoked & atrocities committed upon them by the Mexican government.

After several battles (most famous being the battle @ the Alamo in San Antonio), an insidious massacre of Texian POW's @ Goliad by the Mexican Army, General Sam Houston attacked & routed Generalissimo Antonio de Santa Ana @ the Battle of San Jacinto (outside of present-day city of Houston) - a battle that lasted only 20 minutes yet decimated the Mexican Army, saw Santa Ana captured, and consequently ended the War for Texas Independence. Subsequently, the Texas Revolutionaries founded the great Republic of Texas which flourished from 1836 until it became a U.S. state in 1845 through a Joint Resolution of Congress for Texas Annexation.
U.S. Annexation precipitated Mexican aggression against its northern neighbor & is the underlying cause of the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), which had hugely devastating consequences for Mexico, both in terms of armed forces & territoral losses.

America ""stole"" nothing from Mexico you idiot liberal Professors.
The Mexican War for Independence severed control that Spain had exercised on its North American territories, (for more than 300 years) and the new country of Mexico was formed from much of the individual colonies that had comprised New Spain, including Spanish Texas.
The Texas Revolution or Texas War of Independence was fought from October 2, 1835 to April 21, 1836 between Mexico and the Texas (Tejas) portion of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas.

Animosity between the Mexican government and the settlers in Texas (who were called Texians) began with the Siete Leyes of 1835, when Mexican President and General Antonio Lpez de Santa Anna Prez de Lebrn abolished the Constitution of 1824 and proclaimed a new anti-federalist constitution in its place. Unrest soon followed throughout all of Mexico.
The war ended at the Battle of San Jacinto where General Sam Houston led the Texas Army to victory in 18 minutes over a portion of the Mexican Army under Santa Anna, who was captured shortly after the battle. The conclusion of the war resulted in the creation of the Republic of Texas.",1339891200,36,2694,5.1438356164383565
1232941,5,B00000JKXX,I had seen this series many years ago on PBS when it first aired. My youngest son is a history nut and schools don't really cover the US-Mexico conflict in detail so I thought this would be a nice learning opportunity for my son and a refresher for me. This mini-series presents a very balanced view of the conflict and highlights that period of Mexican history that is almost unknown to most Americans. It is put together in similar fashion to PBS acclaimed Civil War series produced by Ken Burns utilizing narratives and personal stories to tell the story. Highly reccommended to all who love history and American military history particularly.,1338249600,24,646,4.828828828828829
1232942,5,B00000JKXX,"Product arrived on time in great condition.

 Movie reveals aspects of the war that is not common knowledge to most Americans. The movie illustrates how our governments overt Manifest Destiny invasions of foreign countries during the 19th century operated and the negative, resultant problems it has caused that are still being felt on both sides of the border.",1323734400,14,361,5.206896551724138
1232943,5,B00000JKXX,"I was not sure how they would present the story, given that they had no motion picture films. So, I must say the visuals were very good, mixing photograpy of actual land the battles were fought on, re-enactors in military uniform, and old paintings.

The history itself is very informative and even-handed.  Both Mexican and American historians provide description of events. I would recommend reading books by General John Eisenhower, who is interviewed for the story, and Robert W. Merry to get some background.",1295827200,39,513,5.095238095238095
1232944,5,B00000JKXX,"This DVD on the history of the Mexican - American War is a not a candy-coated view of Old Glory waving over Chapultepec Castle and occupied Mexico City. It truly depicts how President Polk and his ""Manifest Destiny"" beliefs orchestrated this war with Mexico, simply to justify the land grab, as to the ""Victors go the Spoils."" I suppose some of my fellow Americans will object to some of the enlightenment, after all Davey Crocket and all those heroes at the Alamo were massacred by the tyrant Santa Ana. But, being able to be open minded, see truth as it was, this DVD is very revelatory. It helps too to understand the psyche of the Mexican peopl today, perpetual victims in history to foeigners. Yes, The USA has had its own part in this. Watch, and wash away any bias",1276819200,24,771,4.514285714285714

1232967,2,B00000JKXX,"An overview of the Mexican American War, by PBS, and as one might expect, favoring the liberal, Democratic viewpoint and recasting.  It was sympathetically slanted towards the Spaniards and the Mexicans/Indians defending fortress Mexico, in what was an emotional tribute, even at times coming across in a requiem-like manner.  This all may have been appreciated as at least reasonable if evidence and good argumentation was given to support it.  Yet evidence of justification either way, be it for the United States or Mexico was largely missing here.  And so then, if the documentary was to focus on criticism, it did not go far enough.  But even as a simple recounting of the military events -- the battles, the transports, and hardships of the War -- it was somewhat anemic.  It therefore is a rather lightweight summary of the War, listlessly slanted towards the defenders, without giving good solid reasoning and evidence -- even though this may well exist.  And given the length of the documentary, they certainly had the time.  One therefore I do not recommend.",1440547200,14,1068,5.028409090909091

1233016,4,B00000JKXX,"The Mexican War of 1846-1848 is overall not well known here in the United States.  When it is talked about it is usually described as the ""training ground"" for future Generals both North and South that fought in The Civil War less than 20 years later.  This documentary does a good and thorough job about describe the circumstances that led the United States to declare war on their southern neighbor in 1846.  The documentary does an interesting format of the background describing about how the War of Texas Independence put in motion the events that led to the Mexican War.  The United States recoginizing an independent Texas, later adding Texas to the Union, the US wanting land that was Mexican territory, the antagonistic view of General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna.  What makes this also a good video is commentaries by Mexican historians who describe the Mexican viewpoint of how unjust the circumstances were for Mexico before, during, and after the war.  The documentary also gives great analysis of the beginning of the war, the invasion of Mexico, the U.S. winning the battles of Monterrey, Mazatlan, and leading up to victory by taking and capturing Mexico City.
This is a good video for any secondary/college history class that is studying the conflict between Texas and Mexico, and U.S. and Mexico.  It is also a documentary that can be a good background to begin studying the U.S. Civil War.
The documentary also leads into the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo ending the Mexican War and the treaties that helped the U.S. gain more land in Arizona and the Southwest U.S.
The only reason that I don't give it a 5 star review is that at times, the story of the war becomes dry and the commentators though essential can get boring to the average viewer.
However, this is truly a great documentary that I recommend for anyone interested in the ""early years"" of the United States, Southwest U.S. History, Mexican History, Texas History, and Military History as well.  Recommended!",1375920000,25,1987,4.892857142857143

These presentations are interjected into the on going narration of this particular history of the war. The total four hours of the presentation is, necessarily a broad outline of the causal events leading up the war, the war itself, and the lingering effects of the war, particularly on the peoples of the Republic of Mexico. As a unique presentation from various perspectives of authoritative sources, it is a complete whole, unified, but perhaps not as well organized as might otherwise have been. Despite the latter, it is a five star introduction to a war with our southern neighbor, The Republic of Mexico, a country which deserves all the knowleldge, understanding, respect, and friendship which the citizens of the United States of America can develop and give to it for the sake of decency and our common fate.",1493942400,3,1077,5.022346368715084
