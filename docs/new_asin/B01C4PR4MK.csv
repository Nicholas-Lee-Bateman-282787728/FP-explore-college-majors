This is an adorable sequel, and I love Belka and Strelka.  An alien on the moon is stealing things from Earth, and Belka and Strelka go on mission.  They sneak on a rocket to go to the moon.  Belka's son, Pushok (who in real life was Stelka's mate), is also on rocket, but with a chimp.  The all end up on the moon, and need to figure out how to fix everything and get back home.",1467331200,,499,4.2
