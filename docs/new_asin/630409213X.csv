7862646,3,630409213X,"I'm not sure what Columbia was thinking when they put this tape together. I have no problems with the first short on the tape, ""Listen, Judge"". I think it's a very creative combination remake that is better than two of the shorts it borrows from (A Plumbing We Will Go; They Stooge to Conga) and on par with ""An Ache in Every Stake"". Shemp gives one of his more consistently funny performances as a stooge (loved his turkey stuffing scene).

It's the other two shorts on the tape I have trouble with. As far as the recycled Shemp shorts go ""Bubble Trouble"" has to be one of the worst. I would say roughly 95 to 96 percent of the film generously borrows footage from ""All Gummed Up"" then the closing minutes of new footage gives us the lame plot twist of Emil Sitka turning into an ape after eating the fountain of youth.

Honestly, if Columbia wanted to release a Shemp remake, titles like ""Loose Loot"" or ""Of Cash and Hash"" would have been a much better choice.

I'm not the biggest fan of ""Dunked in the Deep"" either. So many great Shemp shorts that would have been a better choice for a VHS release, such as ""Blunder Boys"", ""Three Hams On Rye"", ""Tricky Dicks"", ""Brideless Groom"", I could go on but I think you get the point.

Overall, the weakest Shemp tape, but I'm giving it a generous three stars because ""Listen, Judge"" is so good. ""I can't understand what happened to that turkey, I only had the dial set at 650 degrees"".",1354665600,,1429,4.401515151515151
7862647,4,630409213X,"This tape features three later shorts from the Stooge's careers and uses Shemp as the third Stooge to compliment Moe and Larry.

The first short, Listen, Judge, features classic puns and slapstick humor, though all of it is not violent. The Stooges act out a familiar scenario when they wreck a house as fix-its and then decide to make up for it as waiters. Shemp displays some Curly-like mannerisms here and Larry shines in a subtle way during his scenes.

If you think you're having a slight case of dejavu when watching Bubble Trouble, relax. This is a short using old footage from another short. There are some funny parts in it, but most of them were in that other short. There really isn't much that is new here. The Stooges cook up a potion to make their friend (Christine McIntyre) young again to impress her husband.

Third we have Dunked in the Deep. The Stooges are conned into helping a spy by becoming stowaways on a ship. There are some funny bits here like the corridor chase scene. There is nothing extra special about this short though.",1159574400,,1053,4.590425531914893
7862648,4,630409213X,"LISTEN JUDGE, BUBBLE TROUBLE, and DUNKED IN THE DEEP. Good shorts. The best one on the tape is LISTEN,JUDGE. Columbia Tristar has finally release a Shemp remake, BUBBLE TROUBLE. Every short on this tape is somehow reworked from an earlier short.
LISTEN, JUDGE (1952) is basically a reworking of AN ACHE IN EVERY STAKE (1941). The original short was better, but this was still great. This short also copies the beginning of A-PLUMBING WE WILL GO (1940) with the ""flimsy cases"" gag. The electricity scenes were somehow a lot like those of THEY STOOGE TO CONGA (1943). This, however, takes those three films and makes them into one funny short.
BUBBLE TROUBLE (1953) is a remake of ALL GUMMED UP (1947) with at least 88% used from the original. The five minutes of new footage is weird, but funny. The original short is heavily edited into this one. This remake was okay, but I like the original better. Columbia is getting better at remakes, but they get better once they get to MUSTY MUSKETEERS (1954), a remake of FIDDLERS THREE (1948).
DUNKED IN THE DEEP (1949) is the least best short on the tape, but still pretty good. The back of the tape says that the short was remade as COMMOTION ON THE OCEAN (1956) and that this short has reused gags from BACK FROM THE FRONT (1943).
Overall, a decent collection of shorts. The quality is good, except it comes out fuzzy on BUBBLE TROUBLE.",1008979200,,1382,4.621951219512195
7862649,1,630409213X,"LISTEN, JUDGE (1952) - Pretty average.  The plot is basically a combo of A PLUMBING WE WILL GO, THEY STOOGE TO CONGA, and AN ACHE IN EVERY STAKE with lots of reused gags from them. Not one of Edward Bernds' better or more original efforts, but still okay.
BUBBLE TROUBLE (1953) - Absolutely pathetic remake of ALL GUMMED UP.  Seriously, I never thought much of GUMMED to begin with, and 98% of this remake is just reused footage from that.  Up until the last 3 minutes a lame new plot twist is involved, where Mr. Flint (Emil Sitka) turns into a gorilla after eating the Fountain of Youth, and going after the Stooges.  Wasn't necessary and made no sense concerning the plot.  This whole short must've taken about 3 minutes to make.  A bomb.
DUNKED IN THE DEEP (1949) - A pretty weak short. A thin plot, and some slow-pacing in the scenes.  Shemp is forced to do some old Curly routines and gags, and it doesn't fit him at all.
A very mediocre tape, with the best of the bunch being just an average short.",994291200,,1005,4.370967741935484
