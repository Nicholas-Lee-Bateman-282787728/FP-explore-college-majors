2878731,4,B000S1KSDA,"when I first put this DVD on my initial thoughts were that it was a low quality production - a little like a home video. To be honest this is the case. However, after watching it through it has lots of charm and with hindsight I really enjoyed the 'fly on the wall' feeling. Remember its NOT a first class production but is enjoyable.",1251244800,,334,4.234375

8203820,1,B000S1KSDA,"Don't waste your time with this series.  Bad video camera work, bad English pronunciation, cultural and historical narrative is lacking. Basically it's a bad home movie.",1414713600,,169,5.5
8203821,1,B000S1KSDA,"This is nothing more than rather poor and amateurish videos, with insipid music.  There is no explanation of the scenes, etc.  I am glad I did not pay anything to watch this.  Love Amazon Prime so I can try stuff like this out and quit it when it is bad without having to pay anything.",1381968000,,285,4.1454545454545455
8203822,4,B000S1KSDA,"This is insightful movie of Temple architecture and artifacts that can be incorporated in new buildings. Architect's, cultural history seekers and travels would find Sakura Petals a must see.",1377561600,,191,5.620689655172414
8203823,2,B000S1KSDA,Homemade video with hand-held cam.  Poor video quality.  The narrator did do his homework and tried to make it interesting.,1358035200,,123,5.1
8203824,3,B000S1KSDA,"I anticipate this film may be of interest to those viewers planning an upcoming trip to Kyoto or reminiscing about a past trip such as myself.  The introduction is quite long at 3 minutes and 30 seconds.  I almost turned it off before the narration started.  The narration is in English, but the narrator has a fairly heavy accent.

The program covers:

- Sanjusangen-do
- Kyoto National Museum
- Kiyomizu
- Maruyama Park
- Yasaka Shrine
- Gion District
- Yasaka Pagoda
- Kodaiji
- Mausolem for Hideyoshi and his wife, Nene
- Chion-in
- Nightingale Corridor
- Nanzenji
- Kinkakuji
- Gion Cultural Center (Tea Ceremony, Koto, Geisha performance, etc.)

Along with a couple of others I may have missed.  The cinematic quality is somewhat amateurish as if shot with a home video camera and a bit outdated.  It was copyrighted in 2002.  This is mostly evident when viewing the street scenes containing people and cars.  The temples and shrines are timeless and worth seeing again and again preferably firsthand rather than through this venue.",1357257600,3,1038,4.846590909090909
8203825,4,B000S1KSDA,"This is a film of Kyoto, Japanese imperial capital for 1100 years, and a city of 2000 temples.  The film starts in Higashiyama at the Sanjusangendo temple with its 1001 multi-armed statues of Avalokiteshvara (Kannon).  The temple's present construction dates from 1266, and has survived for so long partly because it is built on a sand base resistant to earthquakes.  We are shown the Kyoto National Museum and its rich collection of classic art - much better than national museum in Tokyo.  Also the mausoleum to Shinran, founder of the Jodo Shinshu sect, which venerates Amida Buddha as a transcendant diety.  Japan has 165 Buddhist sects, more than any other nation. The Shinran mausoleum includes a large hall with ashes from 20,000 Jodo Shinshu Buddhists from around the world.

Kiyomizudera, a temple dating from 1633, is built on pillars on the side of a hilltop overlooking Kyoto, and its main building is a National Treasure.  The Otowa waterfall beneath the main hall is said to have therapeutic waters which confer health, wisdom and longevity.  The temple complex also includes a shrine dedicated to the Shinto god of love and serves as a place for resolution of love problems.  We are shown the Yasaka Pagoda and the large hall at the Rinzai Zen Temple Kodai-ji.  Also tombs of Hideyoshi and his wife, and the tomb of the last emperor to rule Japan from Kyoto, Kamayama; a tomb which was later consecrated as a Zen temple.  The film takes us to Eikando temple in the eastern hills of Kyoto, which was built in 835-863.  Originally a Shingon temple it was rebuilt in the 11th century by Eikan, a priest famous for his devotion to the poor and the infirm.  The main hall has a magnificent statue of Amida Buddha, the ""Turning Amida"" with its head turned.  It is said that when Eikan was dancing in the temple, Amida Buddha appeared and danced with him.  The final temple in this film, Ginkaku-ji, was built in 1482, and was originally a villa for Ashikaga Yoshimasa, 8th Shogun from the Muromachi period.  Following his death, the complex was turned into a Zen temple.  It is famous for a sand cone symbolizing Mt. Fuji in its attractive gardens.

""Sakura Petals - Temples and Zen"" is accompanied by a low key voice-over historical narrative.  There is no gabby tour guide standing at the center of the scene.  This is a low-budget tourist film, and includes shots of local food and local street scenes.  Like the other Flying Monk films, it is a good film for anyone planning a trip to Asia or simply interested in studying the history of Buddhism in Japan.",1264118400,2,2569,4.72808988764045
8203826,1,B000S1KSDA,"I purchased the item to show to a friend who had relatives visiting from Kyoto. With all due respect, I could have produced a better video. The camera work is amateurish at best, with poor framing and editing, no steadishot and narration taken directly from the Encyclopedia Brittanica.

The Kyoto relatives were quite amused by the descriptive errors in the narration. Clearly, the editing was performed by someone who had never been in Kyoto. Not worth the price.",1261008000,4,465,4.961538461538462
