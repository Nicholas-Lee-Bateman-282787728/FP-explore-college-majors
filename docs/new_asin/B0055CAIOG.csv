8457830,5,B0055CAIOG,"This is much better than the garbage horror we get spoon fed now a days.  This is a step back to the classic horror movies. The suspense builds and builds throughout the movie. I loved it!
So if you respect the classics this movie will entertain!",1402012800,,246,4.3478260869565215

8457832,3,B0055CAIOG,"Not really that gory. I thought this was going to be way different then what it is. People hyped it up to be way more violent then it actually is. This being said, it's still a decent film.",1384560000,,189,4.0
8457833,3,B0055CAIOG,It was what was expected from the start that something is going to happen when you read the movie plot.,1383782400,,103,4.2
8457834,3,B0055CAIOG,"Not as good as The Sleeper but still very effective for what it tried to do, and that was replicate the look and feel of 70s Grindhouse horror. It's a niche genre and a worthy effort. Starting to be a real Justin Russell fan. Would love to see him spend more time in the 80s slasher subgenre (i.e. The Sleeper). If you could give half stars, this one would probably go 3.5 for me. Gory kills, cute female leads, creepy killers. What's not to like?",1379808000,2,447,4.270588235294118
8457835,3,B0055CAIOG,"As a a fan of 70s Horror i liked this film. It was shot in such a way that it could of fit nicely between ""kidnaped Coed"" and Texas Chainsaw""; stylistically the film hit all the right marks, it looks like the 70s feels like a 70s film  for that i give it a high ratting. But continuity wise or believable story line i would have to say no way.  The two main caricatures  in the film head out to a old family cabin the driving takes up a good chunk of the film, later the farther of one of the girls dose the same drive in what seems like 10 minuets. The mane girl talks about how this cabin was such a part of her childhood but doesn't know wear anything is..ie hospital gas station. Its problems like these that kinda get on your nerve, you find yourself yelling at the tv screen allot because ,,,,well what is happening makes no sense. We no nothing about the killers and why they kill but it seems the whole town dose and we are never told why everyone is keeping this secret. I mean there is a dinner scene and the waitress knows the girls are being stalked but she says nothing. Isn't that just bad for business.
I must not be as harsh as i am this is very enjoyable what I did was i chose to put in my mind that the reason the killers are killing is a show of the randomness of violence and that the mane girl did allot of drugs thats how I got threw this film. i do recommend this film and have showed it to many people but they all have the same comments as I do, i just keep saying ""just go with it"" reason  is its suck a better trip then what is going on in todays dvd snuff bull shit i.e. Hostile, Saw.  This is a through back to a time when horror was dirty without hang a nude girl over a masterbating woman and creepy or scary with out a lock box. So i say watch this film, remember ""just go with it"" you'll have a good time.",1347148800,2,1839,3.97289972899729
8457836,5,B0055CAIOG,"Saw this movie when it premiered in Cleveland.  These guys definitely know how to make a good, classic horror.  Just enough gore, not too over the top.  This movie has a plot, instead of just a bunch of special effects.  Plan on seeing their newest release next weekend.",1309564800,10,270,4.5625
