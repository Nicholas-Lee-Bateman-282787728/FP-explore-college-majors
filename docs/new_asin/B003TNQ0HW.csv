8405290,5,B003TNQ0HW,"I obtained the first series of 'The Sweeney' from interlibrary loan, lucky me.  Already a raving John Thaw fan from 'Morse,' I am so thankful that I was able to view this classic television series!  Already an accomplished and successful television actor at this time, John Thaw gave his usual totally-convincing portrayal of a police officer in this series.  I remember the 70s perfectly well, and watching this was like a time machine for me, even though I've never been to Britain.  All the principal players in this series achieve completely plausible and believable performances.  In 'The Sweeney' Dennis Waterman is just as good as John Thaw.  If you enjoy Dennis, after seeing this performance, let me recommend 'New Tricks,' a currently-running British police drama available on DVD, which also features Dennis Waterman along with other famed British television actors who worked extensively with John Thaw. I am looking forward to viewing ALL of the various series of 'The Sweeney,' one way or another!  Don't miss this program!",1329782400,2,1037,5.136904761904762
8405291,5,B003TNQ0HW,"American viewers will know John Thaw from 'Morse' but for many British viewers he will always be 'Jack Reagan' of Scotland Yard's Flying Squad.

The Sweeney was compulsive  viewing in the nineteen seventies. The Sweeney is cockney slang for the Flying Squad a group of elite detectives who battle organized crime, armed robbery and other crimes carried out by professional criminals.

The success of the show is due to the partnership of John Thaw as Inspector Jack Reagan and his sidekick Sargent George Carter played by Denis Waterman. Reagan and Carter spend as much of their time drinking, smoking and chasing women as they do catching criminals, this is the seventies after all. Morse may use his brains to catch the criminal, Reagan is more likely to use his fists.

Unlike other British detective shows the Sweeney does not involve complex murder cases set amongst the middle classes. The bad guys in the Sweeney are working class armed robbers,hijackers, professional burglars and safe crackers. Reagan and Carter while being totally honest (the real Flying Squad was famous for it's corruption) behave just like the villains they chase.

Because guns have always been less common in Britain than in the US, even amongst criminals, the Sweeney contains some great fight scenes as the police battle it out with criminals armed with pickaxe handles, chains etc. The show also has some great comic one liners making it one of the most funny drama series ever.

The Sweeney is a must for all lovers of cop shows.

8405294,5,B003TNQ0HW,"Once upon a time, up until - maybe - the middle or late 1960's, the Metropolitan Police of London, England, were a proud and (for the age) effective force against crime and criminals.(Remember, this was before personal radios were standard equipment, telephones were FAR from being universally available and the Force was about 20% understrength. The well known, modern, scientific advances in the detection of crime were unheard of and far from becoming available. The Police were unarmed (except for a small 12 inch truncheon (night-stick).

In spite of these apparent disadvantages, the Police were able to hold their own in preventing crime - utilizing Officers patrolling the streets - and in the detection of crime - largely utilizing a large 'network' of Informants and undercover officers.

Extreme and totally unnecessary Puritanical thinking by (non Police) Senior Officers, resulted in a catastrophic and debilitating reorganisation of the Metropolitan Police. This resulted, directly, to the sad state of affairs that exists today. Today, few have any respect of the Police and where, once, many people would be willing to provide information and generally assist the Police, today virtually none does.

The Sweeney is a dramatisation of a select group of men who formed the Flying Squad in the good and effective days of the Metropolitan Police. The Flying Squad was charged with the detection of large scale or particularly heinous crimes - other than Murder. The 'Squad' was remarkably effective and was once much feared by the villains due to its effectiveness - and 'no nonsense' approach to thief taking!

Of course 'lines' were crossed! It would be inane to suggest that all Police are pristine in character and actions. However, over a century of serving the Metropolis had made it obvious that when dealing with unscrupulous, immoral criminals, one is hampered by being forced to wear kid gloves! The result of being forced to wear kid gloves and call everyone Sir - or Madam -has resulted in the debacle that is the Metropolitan Police today. There is no 'bite' and, therefore, no effectiveness in much of today's Policing. (Due to huge advances in scientific detection, a few types of crime are being successfully detected these days, but overall success in the detection of many crimes against the person or which affect individuals greatly are virtually ignored and remain but filed 'Reports' of un-investigated crime. The Public, today, are ill served by a largely ineffectual Police.

The Sweeney, dramatises the work of the 'Flying Squad' in its glory days. Some licence is taken, but it is largely a fair and accurate depiction of the work the Squad did at one time - prior to the Puritanical re-organisation. It was a huge success when first aired and won praise for its authenticity. It is a good and exciting series.",1282089600,3,2848,5.089935760171306
