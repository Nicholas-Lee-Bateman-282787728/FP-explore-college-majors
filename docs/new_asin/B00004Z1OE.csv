After watching this a 2nd time, I found myself pulled into the whimsical tale. I think Sara Driver (director) has actually put together a sweet and thoughtful film. Why this all escaped me the 1rst time is a mystery. Maybe I'd had a bad day! haha
Both Marianne and Alfred Molina do a great job with this story of revenge and salvation.(I'm still not too wild about the other actors' jobs) We get to see the sweetness of Ruthie and Lily, the two ghosts who have both met tragic ends. The Molina character is a lost soul who longs for redemption and finds it by helping our wandering, ghostly twosome. Who, in fact, have come into his life through the earthly object of a rocking chair.
I won't go into into the whole story, but suffice to say I was too hasty in my criticism. This is a sweet and whimsical drama/comedy that bears watching.
Sorry, Sara Driver, Marianne and Alfred Molina. My bad.",1088121600,5,1111,4.371980676328502

I'm a huge fan of Marianne Faithfull and have seen most of her filmwork and for the most part, it's been pretty good. However, her work in this mess is vapid and well, weird! So, if you are a Marianne Faithfull fan, you'll be really disappointed. (Check out her work in ""INTIMACY"" if you want to be pleasantly surprised.)
To try and explain what this film is all about would be difficult, as I don't think the writer or director had any idea either. I suppose the premise of a couple of ghosts attached to the same earth-bound object, benevolently helping some hapless musician find love while eking out revenge on one of the ghost's murdering husband sounds sort-of watchable, believe me, it isn't. I'm not sure why anyone would ever think this horrid film was releasable. An utter waste of time!",1074384000,,1010,4.648044692737431
