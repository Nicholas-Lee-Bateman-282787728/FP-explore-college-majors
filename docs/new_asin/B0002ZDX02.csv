8035223,5,B0002ZDX02,Kinda cool - saw part of this on TV & decided we wanted to see the whole thing. We like Roger Moore & having him narrate some of the lesser details/speculations on Christ's birth/life was cool. :),1403136000,,196,4.324324324324325
8035224,5,B0002ZDX02,"I understand that any film needs some verification and that we might all have doubts but scholars who are dedicated to research have their views but they also need proof.  The journey of the Holy Family is presented as some facts are revealed and although we might not believe some of the content the journey is Holy and very exciting.  Modern Day miracles do occur. Have faith and continue to learn more and more about Jesus and his life. I particularly really enjoyed this story. It is presented as a documentary style with some acting that is well done to accommodate the content of the story spoken by Roger Moore.

The Blessed Virgin continues to appear on earth and some who do not believe should take a pilgrimage to Medjugorje. Also, read about the Holy Family took refuge in the Milk Grotto and the miracles that still occur today. ([...]  ",1388102400,,849,4.633333333333334
8035225,4,B0002ZDX02,"I remember watching this special on NBC for years late at night on Christmas Eve. Even though the copyright is dated 2004, It really was produced before then, possibly around 1999/2000? I do remember watching it before 2004. I believe the manufacturer put 2004 because they deleted certain scenes. I had hoped to see those scenes in this DVD, but alas, no. The deleted scenes were about the Magi and how they probably reached Jesus three years after His birth. I found those scenes to be quite an interesting topic. I do not know why the manufacturer, ""Highland Entertainment"" would delete those scenes or why they even discontinued producing this DVD.
They speak at length about the Magi in reference to the birth of Christ otherwise in the DVD.
The video is quaint and has some interesting topics to ponder in reference to Jesus, His family, their journey, and other stories. However, it's not all Biblical and one should use discernment. All in all though, it's an enjoyable video to watch how the signficance of Jesus changed human history forever.",1259712000,7,1052,4.85
8035226,2,B0002ZDX02,"The product contents is excellent;  unfortunately it was used dvds and had flaws, but still, the contents is what counts.  The contents is out of this world. Please insist on producing new ones and let me know;  I asure you that you will get a lot of new orders.  Thanks.",1201132800,,271,4.36
8035227,3,B0002ZDX02,"I think folks should be warned that this film is not necessarily historically factual. I found much of it to be sensationalized and exaggerated for entertainment purposes. They treat subjects like Helena's relic discovery of the Magi's remains as possible truth. No doubt that, historically, the mother of Constantine did think she had received the remains of the magi, but the chances of them truly being their remains are unlikely, and yet this detail is curiously missing from the film. This sort of brushing over of historical facts happens throughout the film. The film also treats the gnostic gospels with more relevance than they really deserve, only briefly touching on the fact that the majority of them were written tens or hundreds of years after the original gospels and the film tells us that Christian Gnostics were in the majority. That's just not accurate. The film also includes a modern day Christmas miracle that's a bit too hard for even a believer like me to swallow. I'm giving it a few stars because, even though the acting is generally pretty bad, and the production a bit poor, it is entertaining, but films like these do nothing for the Christian faith but make Christians look gullible and foolish.",1166313600,7,1225,4.9227053140096615
8035228,5,B0002ZDX02,"Every Christian that longs for a better understanding of the meaning of Christmas, needs to see this outstanding telling of the first years of Jesus, and the miracles that have followed in his footsteps since then. For those who are unsure, it is an affirmation, and for those who do not believe, an illustration of actual events that are historically chronicled outside of the written Bible as we have known it.",1135468800,5,412,4.816901408450704
