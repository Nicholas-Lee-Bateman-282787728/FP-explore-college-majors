8595731,2,B00DP4AJQS,"This is a very nicely packaged set with attractive artwork, featuring the first four Jungle Jim movies. Each film is presented on its own disc. I won't review the content other than to say: Either you love Johnny Weismuller as Jungle Jim or you hate Johnny Weismuller as Jungle Jim. If you love him read, on; if you hate him, move on. I have just one complaint about this set, but it's a big one. The video quality is extremely poor--it appears as though the source material was SLP VHS. The images are very fuzzy... Considering this package was somewhat pricey at $45, save your money and stick with the individual Sony Pictures releases while you can still find them.",1396137600,8,669,4.583333333333333
