8622669,4,B00GFZLEP4,"Nice cross-section of the short films of silent movie comedian Jack Duffy, who made a career out of playing a senior citizen, when, in fact (like his contemporary, the ""hick"" comic Chic Sale) Duffy was a rather nice-looking, middle-aged master of make-up and characterization. All but one of the shorts are products of the Christie Studios, where Duffy developed into a star comedian, and while he's certainly funny in and of himself, he's also well-supported by the ace Christie production team as well as by veteran comics such as Neal Burns and Eddie Barry. And, while Duffy's ""real"" age allows him to mix it up in scenes of slapstick mayhem with a vigor belying his oldster character, he is, in the loony magical world of silent comedy, able to pull it off with aplomb. (And, alas, in the one talkie short in the collection, this magic is gone, and Duffy is reduced to just another actor playing an old guy...it's not hard to see why he drifted into bit roles after this.)

As to the quality of the prints, they are worn reissues, and perhaps somewhat incomplete, but acceptably watchable, and for silent-film fans, great value for the money. The Christie shorts are relatively rare, the negatives of the originals having been chopped up for TV viewing in the 1950's, so today we are lucky indeed to see films like Duffy's in any condition.",1451692800,,1344,4.743589743589744
