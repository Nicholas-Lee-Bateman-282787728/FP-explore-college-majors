8627042,5,B00GSTHD0C,"Much of this is what the writers THINK happened. No one knows why he did as he did. Yet you get to know Judas better which I think is good. Yet, this is told as a group of short stories. MOST of the time the next one takes off where the one before ended, BUT NOT ALWAYS. In the one where Judas went out and hanged himself, in the next one he was still alive and hanged himself again.",1491264000,,383,3.8607594936708862
