8039164,2,B00066205G,"The Black 6, about a gang of black, vietnam vets who fight racism in a southern town, after one of their brothers was killed was very phony.  The Klansman I expected more from Lee marvin and OJ Simpson.  Needless to say both movies were horrible!  I would not recommend it.",1340841600,,273,4.42
8039165,2,B00066205G,"Sometimes two for the price of one isn't all its cracked up to be, and if the issuers of this double-feature really wanted to mess over the buyer, they would have made this a three-for-one deal. The first film is The Klansman, and stars O.J. Simpson as a black militant who uses guerilla tactics to take on a small town chapter of the Ku Klux Klan after he sees a friend lynched. Knowing what we do about ""The Juice,"" this is a ridiculous notion. Lee Marvin is on the scene as the sheriff who seeks to bring the Klansmen to justice, but his character is little more than a cliche.

More ex-football stars make up the cast of The Black Six. This is another avenge-the-death-of-a-murdered-brotha flick,  and is as predictable as cool temperatures on a cloudy day. There is a scene at the end that is so preposterous--and I can guarantee you've never seen anything like it--that will leave you shaking your head and wondering what the writers (and for that matter, the director) were thinking...or smoking. The only thing missing from the scene is Jimmy Walker entering, clapping his hands and shouting, ""Dy-no-mite!""

I couldn't have seen Jim Brown or Fred Williamson doing either of these films.

However, if you are a collector of these films (as I am), they make a good addition. They prove that acting skill was not a prerequisite, and also that preposterous plots and predictability had no bearing on profits. Obviously, many studios just wanted to push product and were unconcerned about the quality of the script and acting, and films of this genre were definite moneymakers.",1313884800,2,1580,4.7765567765567765
