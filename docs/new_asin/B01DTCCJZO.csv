8756875,5,B01DTCCJZO,"Great historical film for everyone interested in 16th century Central Europe during the Ottoman expansion. The film was based on Gza Grdonyi's book titled Egri Csillagok (Stars of Eger). The book is about a century old, and the film was made almost half a century ago, yet the story and the film lost nothing from its original literary, entertainment, educational and inspirational value. The theme was built around historical facts: a handful of heroically brave men and women held up the besieged fortress of Eger (Hungary) against the powerful army of the Turkish Emperor for more than a month in 1552. Istvn Dob and Gergely Bornemissza were real historical persons, just as Blint Trk and Istvn Majlth were. The latter two spent the rest of their lives in the infamous Yedikule (Istanbul) after the Turks kidnapped them under the pretense of ""friendly invitation"". Gergely Bornemissza was indeed a very skilled and inventive artillery commanding officer. Another sad fact was King Ferdinand's refusal to effectively help the Hungarians with material or manpower contribution in the dire situation.
This is a spellbinding historical fiction film based on solid historical facts, packed with action and uplifting story lines.",1462665600,,1226,5.292307692307692
