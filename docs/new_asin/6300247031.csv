278407,3,6300247031,This is my favorite disaster movie.  The first time I saw it was when it came on network t.v.  I was about 14 years old and just thought it was exciting.  A cruise ship is hit by a tidal wave on New Year's Eve and is turned upside down.  Gene Hackman as a Priest tries to lead as many survivors as he can to safety.  Although most of the survivors don't go with him.  He and Ernest Borgnine argue the whole time.  Shelly Winters is heroic and not homicidal for once in what is a very good role.  And Stella Stevens looks terrific swimming in Ernest Brgnine's pink shirt.  And her panties.  This is her best movie.,1514160000,,613,4.162393162393163

278461,5,6300247031,"One of the best DVD reissues yet; THIS is how they should be done!  Excellent restoration and picture/sound quality along with every possible extra, including reproductions of lobby cards.  The extras include the AMC Backstory documentary, publicity stills, marketing information, technical info from director Ronald Neame about the filming of some of the more challenging sequences.  But best are the 2 full-length commentary tracks, one with the delightful Neame and then the excellent commentary from stars Stella Stevens, Pamela Sue Martin, and Carol Lynley.  These ladies offer a lot of helpful, entertaining tidbits and much historical reference as well.  They aren't like the airhead actresses of today; they really know how movies are made (particular kudos to Stella Stevens) and have a generous spirit in sharing them.  They also are very tactful in recalling working with the nightmarish Shelley Winters.  Great Fun! A truly excellent treatment of a nostalgic classic that left an indelible mark on many, many people. Highly recommended.",1510012800,3,1048,5.472049689440993

disaster movies that I saw as a teen back in the 1970s,
and even though my taste in movies broadened as that
decade progressed, I still love this movie. It's divided
into three sections: introducing the characters, the
disaster and it's aftermath, and the small group of people
who survive trying to get to safety. Gene Hackman, as
the 1970s antihero who leads the group, shines in one of
his greatest roles.",1509321600,2,460,4.691358024691358

278580,5,6300247031,"In the age of tiresome remakes and other disasters that call themselves movies,nobody in the Film and TV business did it any better than the late,great Irwin Allen! after Allen's TV science-fiction shows of the 1960s (""LOST IN SPACE"" and ""VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA"") he decided to take a new direction in his movie making career by doing ""disaster films"" in the 1970s,and he hit pay dirt with ""THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE"" (1972) which also became the biggest financial grosser for Twentieth Century Fox! under the intense direction of Ronald Neame,this original disaster movie was the ultimate nightmarish adventure! a 50 foot tidal wave capsizes the SS Poseidon on a New Years night at sea putting every man,woman and child through the most hellish experience that nobody could ever dream! with an impressive cast headed by Gene Hackman,Ernest Borgnine,Stella Stevens,Jack Albertson,Shelly Winters,Carol Lynley and Pamela Sue Martin,this Irwin Allen production earned its Academy award for best special effects by the late LB Abbott,who was THE main master of SPFX back in the days before CGI became the norm!
this BluRay edition of ""THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE"" is an absolute must for the true movie fanatic despite some imperfections with the audio quality,the picture quality is extremely great,making this classic 1972 disaster movie worth the viewing! ironically some six years after this Twentieth Century Fox release,Irwin Allen,who moved to Warner Bros. in the mid-late 70s had decided to make a sequel to his 1972 classic as both the director and producer,and wound-up creating a disaster of his own with ""BEYOND THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE"" in 1979. this inferior sequel didn't stand a chance,and flopped big time at the Box Office,and Irwin Allen never quite made his disaster films as successful as ""THE TOWERING INFERNO"",which was a rare co-production between the resources of both Twentieth Century Fox and Warner Bros. in 1974 earning him another great Academy award! even in the 2000s when the business made a bad habit of remaking classic movies,remaking this 1972 classic was also a great waste of time and money,and nobody in this business today could do disaster movies a greatly as Irwin Allen could! i recommend ""THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE"" to only the most serious and greatest of movie fans and consumers who know the true value of good movies!",1486771200,,2358,5.1592689295039165

This movie is one of those movies that you will cringe as you watch but won't be able to tear your eyes from. it is bad but in a very good way. You really have to go in knowing that the acting is atrocious except for Ernest Borgnine and Stella Stevens. You have to even now and then get a chuckle from Shelley Winters. The rest of the cast is at best annoying and at the worst sappy. Gene Hackman just barks and yells through the whole thing and Red Buttons is a cowering mass of flesh and just seemed out of place. Carol Lynley well never was much of an actress. As the ""kids"" Pamela Sue martin, who developes some odd crush on the reverend and Eric Shea as her younger brother.....so very annoying. But the boat turning over and the scenery is all worth seeing for the time. I do recommend it but just understand what it is.....a 1972 disaster movie with many disastrous performances.

The poseidon adventure is a real classic film.  The remake was cynical and lost track of what this was about. Sacrificing for others.  The actually used a real ship and damaged it and filmed in it.  The stunts and effects were incredible. and the cast was first rate.  Big stars to say the least, they even scored a hit single from the soundtrack.  The blu ray is better than the dvd for sure.

278855,5,6300247031,"I got the Blu-ray for around $5 on Amazon and it definitely is an improvement over the DVD version. The film is a classic from the 1970's, with a strong cast of actors (Gene Hackman, Shelley Winters, etc.)... far better than the remakes that have been made since. You must see this original. The acting makes up for any lack of special effects (compared to today's films). IMO it holds itself up with the best of the ""disaster"" films from any era. You can often find the DVD in cheap bins, but get the Blu-ray instead. Highly recommended.",1453593600,2,538,4.5

278864,5,6300247031,"Almost a Christmas movie, at any rate, a faux Christmas tree plays a pivotal role in the plot.  A huge ocean liner is going to be scrapped but before that can happen it runs afoul of an officious pinhead who wants them at top speed with no ballast and a GIANT tsunami heading straight for them.  Before you can say belly up, they are.  The few survivors fall into two camps: idiots and followers.  The followers trail after an indignant pseudo-religious minister with delusions of grandeur (Gene Hackman).  Hes hampered every step of the way by a loudmouth detective (Ernest Borgnine).  Its almost Oz-like as this ragtag group of brain-dead, heartless, and cowardly sycophants journey to the bottom of the boat.  (This paltry number of survivors has always left me with a fine appreciation for dry land).  Bon Voyage!

A fabulous example of a disaster flick populated with a lot of has-beens and a few whose careers went nowhere.  My favorite character remains Belle Rosen (Shelley Winters).  My least favorite character is the bombastic Reverend Frank (Hackman).  Director Ronald Neame later said that he regretted allowing Hackman and Borgnine to chew the scenery.  Considering he was in charge, isn't that a bit like buyers remorse?  Its not like they were hiding what they were doing!",1448409600,,1288,4.930232558139535

""What???"" I was intrigued. She says for the first half hour I asked every 15 seconds when was it going to happen. Then once it did I was transfixed and never moved from my spot in front of the TV. Nor did I speak again. I went around for weeks after telling everyone I saw...""The boat turned over!"" I would lay on the floor so I could see rooms upside down. It blew my young mind. Over the last 40 years this film has lost none of its appeal. I've even pulled the, ""it's going to turn over"" trick on children. Including my own. They love it.

Today was my sort of sad/feel sorry for myself day so I decided to watch The Poseidon Adventure. It was sad and it did have some very tragic moments but it was also exciting. I loved Shelley Winters in her part as the lady who was going to visit her grandchild in Israel with her husband. Gene Hackman was superb in the movie. he did an excellent job. All in all it was a very good movie that didn't make me cry very much. I did not like the part when all the people fell off of the Christmas tree as they were trying to escape the water. For once Leslie Neilson did not have a comic role and he did very well as captain of the Poseidon. Carol Lynley was very good, too. I am not sorry I waited so long to watch this movie but I am very glad that I did finally view it. I should not forget Jack Albertson either as I thought he did quite well in his role, too. All of the cast of actors did a good job and made for an exciting, entertaining, sort of sad, adventurous, and thrilling movie.

i massive Tidal wave crashes into a Luxurious oceanliner on New years eve
and flips over the Huge Oceanliner, so the top of the crusier is now the bottom
and the rest of the survivors have to try make their way to the bottom of the boat which is on the surface of the ocean
without being killed
lots of suspense & terror Brilliantly Directed by Ronald neame, Produced by Irwin Allen of course who also directed some scenes
but the credit goes to Ronald neame
also Brilliant acting performances by an all star cast for sure
Gene Hackman, Ernest borgnine, Carol Lynley, Roddy McDowall, Stella stevens, shelley winters & the list goes on

scrap the very old 2 Disc DVD set of this film
20th century fox have released this classic Disaster film on blu-ray with a new HD transfer in 2:35:1 widescreen
and the picture quality does look excellent, very nice sharp & clear picture better quality than the old dvd version
so 20th century fox really made the effort for this film no Doubt about it
i cannot say the same for the sound quality thou, only a 4.0 Master audio mix has been added
which does sound Good but not excellent the Audio sounds similar to Dolby digital mix actually, which is insulting
a 5.1 or 6.1 master audio mix could easily been added for sure but century fox did not bother, tragic
so it looks like century fox only made the effort with the picture quality

20th Century fox did however make an effort with the special features
amazingly century fox carried over all the extras from the old 2 Disc dvd set
many featurettes have been carried over, sometimes century fox don't bother carrying over the extras from the dvd versions
which i think is very insulting to fans for sure
so think yourself very lucky that they did with the Poseidon adventure

279186,5,6300247031,"Here is living, breathing proof that a film can be action-packed with special effects and still tell an absorbing and dramatic story--proof that action and hardware don't have to require that viewers check their brains at the door, and that films that do that are trite and lazy. Poseidon is about optimism and faith, leadership and sacrifice, living and dying, choice, and God's will for us. It doesn't get preachy and it doesn't get overly analytical. But it resonates with real ideas, real people, and a drama about how the two come together and how our protagonists hold on to hope against the backdrop of an escape from disaster. It takes the viewer on a visual journey not frequently traveled in the days before CGI, but it never forgets that the special effects are only the canvas upon which larger and more compelling ideas and emotions are painted. This was the ""disaster film"" that spawned the genre but contained none of the mind-numbing that became a hallmark of most of the films, driven by greed, that followed. Yes, Allen was a big part of those films. But the prototype, his masterpiece, held no promise of great wealth and was even nearly derailed over money concerns. Its production was driven by the things that make for great cinema and cinema lore: vision, ambition, smarts, an eminent director, top-notch screen writer, and a cast of seasoned Hollywood heavy-hitters who all deliver the goods. These folks act their hearts out--something to be genuinely savored considering that this caliber of performance won't be seen in any of the disaster films to follow. It's almost as if Poseidon really shouldn't be thought of as in the same category. And imagine that ... not a single firearm makes an appearance in this movie. No romantic visions of gun violence, no-one is shot, guns aren't pointed at people at every turn, and no-one barks those stupefying words, ""Drop your weapon!""  With all the action, the film-makers managed to make a thoughtful movie about the human condition that's lost none of its luster over the years and continues to deliver a positive message of hope: That in times of despair, we discover the inextricable link between courage and faith. It's not the fires and rising waters that are our adversaries; it's our fears and doubts. And it's often in the courage of others that we find our faith, our own courage, and our belief that ""Life always matters very much.""",1418169600,2,2411,4.851941747572815

279321,5,6300247031,"If you even remotely like the 70's disaster genre, you absolutely must own ""The Poseidon Adventure"".

This is arguably the greatest of all the disaster films, due to great special effects (done before the CGI age), and has great performances by Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine, with wonderful supporting roles by Red Buttons (yes, the hysterical comedian from the hilarious Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts), Shelly Winters, Jack Alberstson (Chico and the Man), Pamela Sue Martin (Nancy Drew), Eric Shea and Carol Lynley.

Leslie Nielsen (of ""The Naked Bullet"" comedies) has a short-lived, but intense role as the Captain of the doomed luxury liner.

A very intense and claustrophobic film, and possibly the ""mother"" or ""father"" of 1970s disaster classics"" (some claim ""Airport"", with Burt Lancaster and Dean Martin was the very first, depending upon your point of view).

I guess I'm not a disaster movie fan just for the sake of watching a disaster. Even during the first 20 minutes though, when I thought it was based on truth, I had to fast forward because some of the characters were just so irritating & it was boring. Once I realized it wasn't true, I couldn't get into it and ended up fast forwarding through much of it because at that point, I really didn't care & just wanted to get to the ending.

It remains on my all-time favorites list, to this day, and still holds up as a thrilling, tense story of what happens when a once-luxurious ocean liner, on her last voyage before being consigned to the scrap heat, is hit by a 90-foot tidal wave and turned upside down in the middle of the ocean.  Gene Hackman leads an all-star cast as Reverend Scott, who no matter what will fight to the end to lead a small group of like-minded survivors, after the ship capsizes, through the upside-down boat to the top (formerly the bottom) in search of rescue ... even as the ship is sinking further and deeper into the ocean as they do so.  The film, nominated for eight Oscars (and winning one, plus a non-competitive Oscar for visual effects) is a riveting dramatic thriller deserving a place on anyone's ""must-see"" list - then, now, and always.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: An opening title card informs us that the ship Poseidon was lost at sea on a voyage from New York to Athens; ""only a handful"" survived. Now, instead of just being introduced to the main characters, the viewer begins to wonder which ones will be alive at the end. Mr. Rogo [Ernest Borgnine] is a New York cop taking his first real vacation with his wife, Linda (Stella Stevens), who's self-conscious because she's a former hooker and thinks she spotted a former client among the ship's crew. Belle and Manny Rosen [Shelley Winters and Jack Albertson] used to run a hardware store, but now they're retiring to Israel where a two-year-old grandson awaits their doting attention. Another shopkeeper, a haberdasher named Martin [Red Buttons], is obsessed with staying healthy and living a long life, but has never found the time for a relationship. A teenaged girl named Susan [Pamela Sue Martin] is traveling with her younger brother, Robin [Eric Shea], to join their parents; the kid is a nautical enthusiast who keeps bugging the crew for tours, thereby picking up information that will shortly prove useful. A ship's steward, Acres [Roddy McDowall], is taken with a singer, Nonnie [Carol Lynley], who will be performing at the New Year's Eve bash later that night, where Acres will be on duty.

The rest of the film is nothing more than the struggle to reach their destination past increasingly hazardous obstacles, as tempers flare, the doomed ship continues to break apart and the onrushing sea pursues them like a predator. Without ever reaching Africa, Rev. Scott has found his calling. ""I've seen it!"" he exclaims to the others, after he's returned from a scouting mission to locate the engine room, and Hackman delivers the line with messianic fervour. Hackman's performance is a key ingredient in Poseidon, because Rev. Scott could easily have been a caricature. Ultimately, though, Poseidon works because of the simplicity of its nightmarish scenario. There are no conspiratorial subplots about building codes, cost-cutting, greed or other human elements in the disaster. Even the brief argument between the ship's captain and the owner's representative about safety measures is a red herring, because nothing could have secured the ship against the wall of water that capsized it. The film inflicts an unimaginable, unforeseeable disaster on a random group of individuals, and then we watch how the survivors react. Forty years later, it's still scary stuff.

Blu-ray Video Quality  20th Century Fox's 1080p encoded image quality of `The Poseidon Adventure' looks absolutely terrific. The source materials are in excellent shape and faithfully restored, and the image is beautifully detailed with rich, saturated colours, deep and solid blacks, and a sense of depth that is essential to conveying the sheer scale of the production. Compression artefacts, banding, artificial sharpening and other defects that would militate against a recommendation were nowhere to be seen. Fox has been on the front lines of experimenting with ways to make the appearance of older films acceptable to a generation used to contemporary ""cleanliness"" in their video experience, and the results have often been controversial. Overall it has stood the test of time and Fox has done a brilliant job and any youngsters viewing this Blu-ray will think it has been made in 2014.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 4.0 DTS-HD Master Audio track appears to contain the film's original ""four-track stereo"" mix, which predates Dolby Surround and its variations (which wouldn't be available until the following decades). Almost all of the sound occurs in the front three speakers with only occasional effects or reinforcement from the mono rear channel. The discrete centre channel aids in preserving the clarity of dialogue, especially as the noise of the ship's deterioration increases, and the stereo separation between the front mains contributes a welcome sense of dimensionality as the survivor's work their way through the various spaces and past increasingly challenging obstacles. The dynamic range is respectable but limited at both the bottom and the top; so that explosions that routinely rock the capsized vessel won't do much for your subwoofer and the high notes of John Williams' memorable score. Still, given the vintage of the production, the track sounds quite good.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Director Ronald Neame: Ronald Neame was in his early 60s when he directed The Poseidon Adventure and his early 90s when he recorded this commentary and sadly passed away in 2010 at age 99. Still, you'd never guess his age from the quality of this presentation, which is sharp, insightful and full of interesting detail. Ronald Neame's memory was no doubt kept fresh through invitations to address biennial conventions of the Poseidon fan club that met aboard the Queen Mary, where he and his wife would be put up in the Royal Suite, but his critical faculties are equally sharp, as he routinely points out lines of dialogue he wishes he'd changed, edits he would do differently today and directorial choices about which he's had second thoughts (notably, he'd like to tone down the intensity of the conflict between Gene Hackman's Scott and Ernest Borgnine's Rogo). Ronald Neame's observations on the relation between producer and director and on the changing role of the camera's ""eye"" in 20th Century cinema are invaluable.

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Actors Pamela Sue Martin, Stella Stevens and Carol Lynley: As is often the case with group commentaries, the three actresses have too much fun reminiscing and talking over each other to provide an informative commentary. In the latter half of the movie, pauses become frequent.

Special Feature: Hollywood Backstories: The Poseidon Adventure [2000] [25:09] The AMC series produced some excellent features on classic films, and this particular episode on `The Poseidon Adventure' is a fine example. Using both contemporary footage and new interviews from 1995, it describes how the Poseidon was green lit, nearly cancelled, rescued at the last minute and went on to become a classic.

Special Features: The Cast Looks Back [2006] [5:42] The interviewees include Sheila Allen (Irwin Allen's widow, who played the ship's nurse), Red Buttons, Carol Lynley, Pamela Sue Martin, Roddy McDowall, Stella Stevens and James Radford (consultant).

Special Feature: Falling Up with Ernie [2006] [4:10] Ernie Orsatti recalls how he was hired on Poseidon as an actor, but was suddenly plucked from the crowd by director Ronald Neame to perform the film's most famous stunt: the fall into a huge pane of glass.

Special Feature: The Writer: Stirling Silliphant [9:16] Recollections of, and tributes to, Poseidon's screenwriters by assorted friends and colleagues.

Special Feature: The Heroes of the Poseidon [2006] [9:53] A quasi-allegorical interpretation of the film that pushes every possible Christian element in the story to the breaking point and beyond. Contributors of this special feature included Christopher Heard, Stella Stevens and John Vogel.

Special Feature: The Morning After Story [9:00] Co-writer Al Kasha with Joel Hirschhorn describes writing the film's Oscar-winning theme song. Additional observations are supplied by Maureen McGovern, whose recording became the standard edition, Carol Lynley who performed the song in the film, and Rene Armand who recorded the demo and ended up dubbing Carol Lynley in the finished film.

Special Feature: R.M.S. Queen Mary [2006] [6:25] A brief overview of the majestic ocean liner, which both inspired Gallico's original novel and provided a template and locations for the film.

Special Feature: Conversations with Ronald Neame [2006] [8:51] Sinking Corridor: How the shot of Reverend Scott and Robin running along the flooding corridor was done, and how the negative ended up submerged in water and was nearly ruined. Also included is Generations of Fans: Fan mail. Turning Over the Ship: Combining hydraulics with camera angles.

Special Feature: Galleries: Marketing Posters and other assorted ads, Publicity: Publicity stills, Behind-the-Scenes: On-set photos and many featuring director Ronald Neames, plus concept sketches for costumes.

Special Feature: Storyboard Comparisons [6:53] Ship Capsises, The Vertical Shaft and Saving Reverend Scott.

Special Feature: Vintage Promotional Material: Original 1972 Feature [10:01] Teaser Trailer [1:38] Short and to the point. Original Trailer [3:17] Over twice the length of the teaser but less effective.

Finally, `The Poseidon Adventure' has definitely aged well both in its technical attributes and its storytelling perspective. Its admirable screenplay, direction, and acting performances allow its long list of potential survivors to really grow as significant characters in a disaster tale that is straightforward but challenging to assemble. Its human elements and action-packed presentation justify both its box office success and critical acclaim and that is why I am so glad I have now added this classic blockbuster movie disaster to my Blu-ray Collection and of course they could not be able to make this type of film today, especially without all the CGI effects, as it would cost double the amount of money to make today and if you have not seen this film, then you will be missing something that is totally unique and you will be stunned by what you view and you will be a nervous wreck by the end of the film. Highly Recommended!

279581,5,6300247031,"This is not a cerebral film, by any means, so if you're looking for something to make you think, move on! This movie, though a teeny bit slow to start, takes you on an adventure that keeps you entertained all the way through. (POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT) The loss of several characters along the way is tragic and keeps you in suspense, keeping you just on the edge of your seat. Even though it is from the 70's it keeps its interest, only showing its age in the clothing worn by the characters, and even that isn't too bad. I definitely recommend to anyone looking for an adventure film to pass the time.",1389484800,,601,4.375
279582,5,6300247031,"This movie's got it all: intentional and unintentionally funny dialogue, moments of pure camp, moments of true pathos, great acting, hammy acting, and fantastic effects from an era before CGI - it's the best disaster movie of the 70s.

279583,4,6300247031,"...says Captain Leslie Neilson seconds before a towering stock footage wave capsizes the SS Poseidon tossing a bunch of former Academy Award winners around and killing off all the extras we don`t care about, including that guy who was putting the moves on Nancy Drew.
This is where the movie really kicks into high gear. We have Father Gene Hackman screaming at everybody, Cop Ernest Borgnine screaming his wife Stella Stevens who screams right back at him. Shelly Winters gets her butt stuck in a Christmas tree and Red Buttons just sorta hangs around on the sidelines telling everyone how pathetic he is. Eric Shea is also around to prove he was the most miserable child actor of the 70`s .In Paul Gallico`s novel the boy went down with the ship - which would have been a more satisfying ending.
Highly entertaining with great sets and action moments like Winter`s heroic sacrifice, Steven`s bralessly climbing ladders and Pamela Sue Anderson`s legs. Sad moments include Hackman blubbering all over Winters face and Shea surviving.
The Blu-Ray is a must have. It`s cheap and it`s loaded with features. Picture and sound quality are also very good.

279587,4,6300247031,"I downloaded this movie, mistaking it for the more recent remake (listing said 2008). I remember when this original movie came out; it was considered a B-movie at the time. The cast had incredible actors: Shelley Winters, Ernest Borgnine, Gene Hackman. I was surprised and delighted to see most of my students engaged in this film from the start.
I'm not sure what it was that engaged them. Styling is definitely dated, as is the dialog, but in a good way. There was no sex or lasciviousness. There was no violence. There was only mild profanity by today's standards. Instead, character development and literary, thought-provoking themes were the focal points. As I showed this video during the last two days of class before winter break, the Christmas and New Year's themes were a plus.
Students today (at least in urban core schools with high poverty and immigrant levels) tend to be a bit lazy, a rare few have an understanding of integrity, and many are depressed and give up easily. The film treats addresses the issue of how blind faith can blunt us to our actual human potential to transcend difficulty. Courage, sacrifice, resourcefulness were highlighted.

This movie had my heart pounding from beginning to end, just waiting to see what happens next.

279860,5,6300247031,"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST DISASTER MOVIES OF ALL TIME, I had to get that out of the way. Yes this movie is about salvation, and being a christian I can say this. It delivers, the Bible and More specifically in the book of hebrews. Which is the book of faith, does state that there would and had been people who kept the faith. And there would be some who got their reward here on earth, and some would die without seeing their reward, since they got it in Heaven. The Poseidon Adventure is a disaster movie that actually takes a look at how people will or would respond in a disaster, you have the controversial Rev. Scott. Who leads a band of passengers who are willing to escape up through the now upside down ship, Ernest Borgnine is his usuall self in this. Stella stevens plays a prostitute, whom ernies cop married. Pamela sue martin, Shelley Winters, Red Buttons. They face different obstacles and they climb their way through the ship, and just when you think they've all made it, Rev. Scott sacrafices himself so they can make through to the keel of the ship. Ernie's wife is a casualty, and shelley Winter's character also dies. But it's in the process of the journey, the great thing about this movie. Is that gives you time with each character, before the disaster. So that as their climbing through the ship, you're there with them. And you're sad, as they're at the bottom of the ship, and the rescuers are cutting through the hull. Ernie looks back into the engine, with tears in eyes and remembers his wife Linda. A touching moment, now some have said the ending is weak. I partially agree with that, the original intent was as the survivors are flying away in the helicopter. They would see the ship slide beneath the waves, but the producers ran out of money. So we're left with the ending as it is. A great disaster movie, that has human drama that isn't forced down your throat.",1327536000,,1896,4.46685878962536

1.  Ladies, wear something under your long gown besides panties.
2.  Girls, wear hot pants under your long skirt so you have something on when you have to jettison said skirt.
3.  Practice holding your breath.
4.  Ask the kids on board if they have ever seen Broadway or Shaft Alley.  If any say yes, keep them in close proximity.
5.  Stick by the non-denominational ministers.
6.  The hull is thinnest by the propellers.  When the ship turns over that is where the guys with torches are gonna pop you out.

Since then we always would watch it when it was on tv but every time we did the ship had already turned upside down. So we never saw the movie from the beginning. When dvds started coming out we bought it on dvd(the first one disc release). We watched it and finally saw the beginning of the movie. When I saw the special edition at target a few years later I got it (just for the bonus stuff) and I gave my one disc to my cousin.

The movie Poseidon that came out in 2005 was good, but I really was in shock when the tv movie remake tried to remake the same 1972 movie with a twist on how the ship turned upside down.",1321833600,,750,3.9019607843137254

279909,5,6300247031,"The reviewer who wrote that this set is no longer available as shown with booklet and picture cards is right. What THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE SPECIAL EDITION DVD does come with is two DVDs and plenty of extras!

The Irwin Allen movie itself is an exciting adventure and features an all-star cast as they try and work their way from the top of the ship to the bottom, after it gets knocked over by a huge tidal wave on New Year's Eve, and is floating upside down. This movie is credited to starting the ""disaster"" genre and it really is amazing to watch considering the limitations of special effects during that time. There is not a moment where the viewer does not believe that these people are in fact on a ship and that it is under water. Amazing!

THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE is presented in wide-screen and looks fantastic! The movie with optional commentary by director Ronald Neame, and stars Pamela Sue Martin, Stella Stevens and Carol Lynley. The second DVD gives you lots of extras:

******  DVD 2 EXTRAS  ******

279915,3,6300247031,"Though I agree that the setting of the action scenes was amazing, since I used to enjoy watching the movie as a youngster in the ninties. I would rather say that the movie is somewhat incomplete and does miss a respectful amount of characters from the novel, which shifts the movie away from the original story written by Paul Gallico in 1969. The book definately brings more pinspiration and intersting adventures about the characters, including those that have not made an appearance in the motion picture. It was wrong to exclude Dick and Jane Shelby since they played a major role in the story. In my point of view it was extremely crazy to end the movie that Robin Shelby survived the wreck rather than drown. Paul gallico wouldn't accept such a fate for the young boy since the book has a dramatic ending with the boy gone and has his parents and older sister weeping over his tragic loss. Perhaps the creators of the motion picture couldn't bear the thought that a small petite 10-year old such as Robin died without having his chance in life. Hollywood should stiop creating to many movies with happy ends and make the endings dramatic and sad, just like the movie Love Story, which is identical to the novel. I rather have Robin dead than alive. I understand that it is a cruel thing for someone to die at such a young age, but that's what makes the book so wonderful that the child perishes. The book will never be forgotten that way. On the other hand, Susan wasn't supposed to in love with the reverend Scott, since the truth states that her first love lasted for just a few moments with a handsome young sailor, by the name Herbert. I keep rereading the lines over and over again how awesome it was that a sailor, no more than a boy, raped a girl of his own. he too perishes for what he committed. Susan would live her whole life remembering this boy forever. She must have loved him since she desired to be pregnant from him.",1280188800,,1939,4.480225988700565

Besides the bad acting, questionable dialogue and irritating amount of scenes which consist of people yelling at each other, there were so few likable characters that by the end I hardly cared whether they made it or not. The upside-down ship was the most intriguing character in the whole film.",1266969600,2,423,4.943661971830986
279929,4,6300247031,"New Years Eve 1972 turned out to be a deadly night for the S.S. Poseidon.  A brief subplot of some guy who runs the shipping corporation telling the captain (Leslie Neilsen before he got funny) to hurry up, three days behind schedule, blah blah blah.  Nothing really exciting until the wave hits.

Thanks to an undersea earthquake, a huge tsunami knocks the ship upside-down.  Many die because they don't listen to Gene Hackman.  Gene's character steals the show -- a rowdy preacher, he rallies around a small group.  As a few die (Roddy McDowell, etc.) the viewer is rooting for the survivors, shocked at the barriers and dismayed at the death and destruction.  The preacher curses God, then sacrifices  himself. Very sad.

Irwin Allen's film was a big hit in the 70s and opened the door to other disaster flicks such as Airport, Earthquake and the Towering Inferno.

There was a sequel and a couple of remakes, but nothing beats the cheesy plot, the yelling and screaming!  You know why Ernest Borgnine won an Oscar in the 50s (wasn't for McHale's Navy!) and that Shelly Winters can swim.

Maureen McGovern's hit song ""The Morning After"" came from this film.  Great movie score by my favorite composer John Williams (Star Wars, etc.).

A bit dated, but an amazing film of survival and sacrifice.  Must see.

This film even out grossed it's re-make ""Poseidon"" with 1972 dollars. Great cast (combining the talents of 15 Academy Award winners) including the BRILLIANT Shelley Winters who gives a heart wrenching performance as a plump jewish grandmother trying to survive to see her grandson.

279931,5,6300247031,"Out of all the diaster flicks of the 70s, this has got to be the best. Not that Towering Inferno wasn't good, it was just too long for my tastes. There's only so many times I can see an exterior shot of the same building on fire. Anyway, unlike the recent remakes, this version makes you actually care about who survives. Hackman, Borgnine and Winters give the best performances. Some bits with Hackman are his talks with his priest friend about being renegade in the beginning along with his sermon. My absolute favorite scenes with Hackman are when he cries over the loss of Winters and when he sacrifices himself and denounces God. You can feel that he is furious that He would violently take away Stevens' and Winters' characters just when they're about to escape. He's upset about McDowell's death too but that wasn't as moving or gripping like the others. Borgnine is brilliant as Rogo. My two favorite scenes with him is at the end when they're about to be rescued. He just gazes in awe about what's happening but then glances back into the engine room, knowing what he's just lost, and cries and when starts yelling at Hackman, blaming him for the death of his wife. And Winters, her performance is excellent. You cheer her for saving Hackman one minute, then grieving as she lay dieing in his arms and gives him her necklace. This is when Albertson gives a great performance when he emerges from the water and sees his dead wife and breaks down. The one character I wish that they stuck with that died in the book is the boy. I know he is helpful, but he is just annoying. Not that I just hate all kid actors but if did die, like in the book, it would be a shocking moment and, at least in my opinion, add better development to his sister. Another film that really doesn't use a lot of music except for a few occasions. If only the remakes could've been this enjoyable with great performances.",1249862400,,1902,4.484149855907781

279935,3,6300247031,"I am somewhat stunned that the prevailing sentiment about this film is so overwhelmingly positive. Perhaps it is a cultural effect or wistfulness for the 1970's. If so, I was not similarly affected inasmuch as I had not seen this movie until now (2008). The film lived up to its reputation for being an expensive disaster film with an all star cast. I found the special effects (especially the giant wave) to be amazingly good for the time, and was entirely entertained by the film until the ship capsized.

The film is ponderous, preachy, and pretentious. Worst of all it took extremely talented actors who I normally enjoy watching and wasted their talents, particularly in two specific instances. In a nutshell, I had a Gene Hackman and Shelley Winters overdose in short order. Disregarding the whole contrivance of Hackman's character as a questioning-pseudo agnostic priest with a foul mouth and bad temper, I couldn't get past the excessive overacting, which was clearly not helped by the extremely unnatural dialogue screenwriter Wendell Mayes foisted on the cast. In this film Hackman makes William Shatner look positive sedate even at his eye-rolling extreme. I couldn't help but feel that ""Reverend Scott"" found his proper Biblical locale when he fell into the lake of fire.

Likewise Shelley Winters, while seemingly comfortable in her role as a whiny matron (and former swimming champ), was perfectly matched with Hackman and seemed to be in constant competition with him for who could be most over the top. I thought her saccharine dialogue with her husband about never seeing their grandson was as bad as it could get. I was wrong: a few minutes later after showing why she was the only one on the ship trained to swim down stairwells and through doors (huh?), she abruptly has a coronary event of epic proportions. I started keeping an eye on the running time at this point.

I found Ernest Borgnine as a policeman to give a much better (but by no means understated) performance, but found the setup of him on the ship with his wife and former prostitute Stella Stevens to be better suited to a sitcom than a serious drama. And there's the problem: this entire film is one giant soap opera at sea with wholly unbelievable characters, and like a soap opera the talented cast's efforts are largely wasted as the underlying material isn't very good. On the positive side, I thought Leslie Nielsen was quite good as the Captain: it's a welcome reminder of his past as a ""serious"" actor.

I know this is a beloved cultural icon, and I can see that it would have been more impressive to see in the theater, but I just couldn't get into it. It is an interesting glimpse into the precursor of the 1970's disaster movies, which I actually like in general. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is technically infeasible: for example, the fire in the closed engine room would remove all the oxygen in short order, rendering the entire cast unable to breathe. Not that that's a bad thing. Worse than technical inaccuracy, though, it is relentlessly preachy and dwells superficially on the condition of man and particularly human suffering. The problem is that this is a disaster flick by Irwin Allen and Ronald Neame, not Sir John Gielgud in William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.

I like a good disaster flick or B-movie as much as the next person (and more than most), but I found ""The Poseidon Adventure"" to be bloated, ponderous, and worst of all, boring. I recommend this for viewing as a cultural icon of the 1970's: no more, no less.",1223942400,4,3529,4.8072487644151565

279975,3,6300247031,"For a film nearly thirty years old, Poseidon Adventure is still so effective that it would cause anyone planning to take a cruise to think twice. You probably know the plot--luxury liner capsized by a tidal wave. This synopsis is brought to life with suspense, drama, and sometimes, terrifying reality. One of the most effective cinematic touches is that in nearly every scene, the camera is slowly swaying back and forth to give us a sense that we really are at sea.  We follow the journey of ten survivors through the inverted ship to their hopeful rescue--narrowly escaping fires, explosions, and flooding corridors every step of the way. The sets are epic and nothing less than spectacular. Especially the inverted dining room when the Atlantic Ocean comes crashing in, and the engine room which is now a horrifying twisted metal inferno.  No, the movie is not perfect, and it is of course starting to look a bit dated. However the suspense and dazzling effects will keep you glued to your seat and you certainly won't be bored. Poseidon Adventure is a true classic. A must see for everyone--not just disaster movie fans.

Before, it gets pulled under. Gene Hackman did a great job as the preacher who leads the group through the dangerous traps of Poseidon. Ernest Borgnine wasn't too bad as the cop who butted heads with the Preacher. Shelly Winters was wonderful as the kind hearted, Mrs. Rosen. Who tries to help the group to escape. Even Red Buttons was good as Mr. Martin, the friendly and helpful man. Who keeps the peace in the group. Poseidon is a true disater film. Cause, when you watch it. You will understand why the tagline for the film is "" Hell Upside down"". Cause it is, but at the same time when you watch it. You will also see how six ordinary people can triumph over one of the mother nature's worst and most horrific disaters ever!!!",1164240000,2,1015,4.404255319148936
279977,4,6300247031,"It may not seem like anything particularly new these days, especially after the revival of disaster films in the late 90s. But in 1972, The Poseidon Adventure was a somewhat groundbreaking film. But we're used to a group of survivors fighting against floods, earthquakes, storms, sinking vessels, zombies, volcanoes etc so you have to keep this in mind when watching it.

Taken from Paul Gallico's novel (who himself was one a ship that almost capsized) the film features an all-star cast (though young viewers will probably not recognize a single one of them save Gene Hackman or Leslie Nielsen) with 7 Academy Awards between them. Surely, the bigger the stars have a bigger chance of survival! Not so! A capsized ship has many different ways of killing you as our unfortunate stars learn...the hard way. None of it is particularly graphic but there is a lot of tension and claustrophobia that makes it work. And the sets are quite impressive, if a little dated. When the Poseidon flips over it's already an ancient ship heading for the scrapyard. It would have been better if they destroyed something brand new and pretty, but I guess that means it wouldn't be so dirty and menacing when upside-down and full of salt-water.

Followed by a sequel in 1979 and a new version in 2006, TPA has become famous as the film that started the disaster genre and Irwin Allen as its creator. Truth be told, Allen only ever directed 2 (and a bit) of these movies and produced a couple more. I guess it's because TPA made such an impression that his name was linked to disaster movies he wasn't even involved with.

Strange though to think that Gene Hackman hated making the movie and has apparently, to this day, refused to watch it. Much like Ed Harris in the Abyss. I guess some bald actors should just stay out of the water.

279978,4,6300247031,"I love disaster movies, or any disaster movie that involves water - Titanic, Hard Rain, Titanic, Pearl Harbour, Titanic ... Yeah I love Titanic. But I was shocked when watching this film how much Titanic resembles it! There's a lot where you can see where James Cameron might have got some of his ideas from.

I felt very claustrophobic watching this film, not only were we watching it in the darkness, but there were also fireworks going off outside, and the film itself is very claustrophobic. There's no natural light, as the boat is capsized.

I had an awful time recognising actors in this, particularly Gene Hackman. I knew the name, I could NOT pick out which one he was. (Very blonde moment there.) I eventually recognised him, cos he was the main character (big clue there), and he was also using Simon Cowell's fashion sense - high waisted trousers, and polo neck TUCKED IN. I don't know why it took me so long to recognise him, but I managed to recognise Ernest Borgnine, who played Rogo, as being in Little House In The Prairie, in one or two episodes.

The Poseidon Adventure is a really good film, with no need for special effects or CGI, apart from the odd one or two. Nearly all the stunts were performed by the actors themselves, when possible, and they would have ended up with many bumps. What made this film all the more better was the lack of special effects, and it made it all the more real. I was holding my breath during many scenes - which was quite difficult considering I was blocked up with the cold at the time - and because it was so claustrophobic, it made it all the more worse.

280011,4,6300247031,"I hadn't seen this film before watching the remake, and I gave the remake a generous 4 stars ( I say generous because it was undeserved) and after seeing this film and seeing what the remake had to work with I'm appalled the remake wasn't better.  At least the ending to this film make sense.  The acting here is decent, for a 70's film, and Hackman (who is always top notch) and Winters both did wonderfully.  The action and adventure is this film is high intensity, and while the remake did copy a few of this films best scene's the brilliance was lost in the translation.  Point being that the original, in this instance, is much better than the remake and should be enjoyed by all who haven't had the opportunity to see it yet.  The story is similar in both, both involving a cruise liner flipping over due to a rogue wave, each set in their own time periods, but what makes the films differ is the people aboard.  In this film you have a priest (Hackman) struggling to make his way right with god, and he is the one who ushers everyone to safety.  He wants to help everyone.  In the remake you have a professional gambler only concerned with his own safety.  Not that that is the main reason this film is better, for this film also gets you involved with the cast of characters, understanding all of them, knowing all of them and so you thus can be concerned about all of them.  I guess all that really needs to be said is that if you're like me and you've only seen the remake, please rent this movie and see the masterpiece that inspired the flop.",1156464000,2,1554,4.327586206896552

280017,3,6300247031,"The original The Poseidon Adventure isn't exactly a film so good that it couldn't stand remaking. The first half hour before the wave hits is like a very badly written episode of The Love Boat, with painfully on the nose dialog (""What kind of priest are you?"" ""I'm a renegade! The very best kind!"") and hideously stereotyped characters. In fact, truth to tell, it's a pretty pedestrian affair even after the ship goes bottom up: strip away its high concept and all you're really left with is a long, slow wade to the grave for some of the characters en route to the cheapest closing sequence ever fobbed off on an audience in a major studio picture. Aside from the odd bit of dialog about the importance of life in the face of death or Gene Hackman's occasional tirades about or against God that hint at someone striving for a big theme, there's not that much of Paul Gallico's original religious allegory left either (if memory serves, in the novel the Reverend Scott had 12 passengers following him on his path to martyrdom). Worse, some of the performances are just excruciating to watch (particularly Red Buttons) while Roddy McDowall's attempt at a Scottish accent is particularly painful. It has its moments, but far fewer than you'd think.

No complaints about Fox's special edition - a surprising commentary from Ronald Neame (who has never made any secret of his dislike for the film in the past), several featurettes, trailers and stills gallery - although it is irritating that Fox have inexplicably cropped the original 1972 making of featurette to 1.85:1 when it was originally fullframe.",1150588800,3,1601,4.843065693430657

The remake sadly has bland & boring people/charectors.  This movie has the infamous  Shelley Winters scene.  Calling this a camp-classic would be wrong!  Its a classic.

280049,5,6300247031,"As someone who's just seen the new ""Poseidon"", and having just seen the original after a long ""hiatus"", I felt compelled to put my two cents in.

While the new ""Poseidon"" was taut with non-stop action and special effects, I found it severely lacking in the character-development department.

Which brings me to the original. Although the dialogue is somewhat dated and the special effects do not match anything by today's standards, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" works far better in that it is a fine piece of cinematic story-telling.  You get to know and care about these people, not witness two-dimensional characters taking a backseat to computer graphics technology.  The people and the story of their escape and survival remain the primary focus of the movie, while the special effects enhance and supplement this goal; not the other way around.

For its time, ""TPA"" was brilliantly conceived and its effects, amazing.  I was reminded, as I sat and watched the original, of just how real everything seemed.  Never did I get the feeling that I was looking at a set.  What also makes this film even more horrific and intense, imo, is that much of what happens is left to your imagination.  There isn't this constant need to repeatedly display death and carnage for shock value or in order to prove that it exists.  In fact, one of the most horrowing scenes is when parts of the ship explode, thereby putting those who have chosen to stay with the ship's Purser in peril.  Thereafter, you witness these very same people frantically clammoring up the Christmas tree as they try to escape certain death.  Heartbreakingly, the tree falls over from the passengers' weight, and all Reverend Scott can do is sorrowfully close a door to the screams and agony of those left behind.  To me, that is one of the more powerful scenes in this film because of what you DON'T see.

As for the acting, the performances in this film really stand out and make up for any ""cheesiness"" in the dialogue.  Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine are ""over-the-top"" as two of the main characters, and Shelly Winters more than holds her own as a Grandma yearning to make a difference.  All of the actors do a splendid job in making you believe in their dilemma and in taking you along for the ride.  You won't be disappointed.

Lastly, I had forgotten how ""diverse"" the dialogue was for its time, given the few curse words and light comedic moments. Stella Stevens' character declaring that she wanted to go first up the Christmas tree because she didn't ""want to get stuck behind fat-*ss"" took some edge off of the horror of their situation and made their characterizations even more real.

Whether or not you believe anyone can survive such a disaster, the story and performances in ""The Poseidon Adventure"" will make you think that it is possible, and herein is why the picture works and remains one of the greatest disaster films of all time.",1148601600,8,2912,4.764940239043825
280050,5,6300247031,"I first saw Poseidon Adventure on Christmas Eve 1972.  I was nine and my brother was almost twelve.  I vividly remember calling the theater and, because it was rated PG, asking the lady if my brother and I had to have an adult with us in order to see it!  Well, needless to say, my 9-year-old eyes had never seen anything like it and to this day the movie has a certain hold on me.  I bought the special edition dvd the day it came out.  I watched it four times the first two days.  Both commentaries are great but I think I like the commentary by Stella Stevens, Carol Lynley and Pamela Sue Martin a little better than the director's.  It's fun to listen to the three ladies reminisce and laugh together.  I have seen the new movie and I like it, probably because I like the premise of the story.  It's just a very different take on the same premise.  Poseidon Adventure will always be among my favorite movies.",1148083200,31,912,4.280701754385965
280051,5,6300247031,"Today it seems that every third movie leans on CGI to a point at which the term ""special effects"" has little meaning--but there was a time, and not so very long ago, when the words had a very literal meaning.  THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, loosely based on the novel by Paul Gallico, was very special indeed.  So much so that it was not simply a movie.  It was an event.

The film's fame is such that the story is extremely well known.  An aging passenger liner, the Poseidon, is making a final voyage at an unsafe speed and with insufficient ballast.  Shortly after midnight on New Year's Eve it encounters a ninety foot tidal wave and capsizes, leaving a handful of survivors to fight their way to the only point in the hull from which rescue might come.

The opening sections of the film, during which we meet various passengers, was filmed aboard the Queen Mary.  Once we enter the Grand Salon for New Year's Eve festivities, however, every set has been constructed to full size.  There are no CGI effects, no rear projections, and (with the exception of long shots of the ship itself) there are no minitures.  The cast works exclusively in the middle of tangible effects, and then as now, the result is remarkably disturbing.  It looks real because it is real.

And it is really that sense of reality that puts THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE at the forefront of its genre.  Disaster films have been popular since the silent era, but THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE was virtually without precedent in 1972. It is difficult to convey the visual shock the film had in its first theatrical release.  People screamed and jolted in their seats, and when the ship capsized the entire audience leaned to the right, clutching at their arm rests and each other.  You left the theatre physically drained, your conversation laced with nervous laughter.

It is true that the film's dialogue is more than a little corny, but this was indeed made at a time when children still said 'No, Sir' and 'Yes, Ma'am;' the film reflects its era, and many viewers were as shocked by the profanity as they were by the special effects.  But whatever the film's shortcomings in terms of dialogue, there can no dispute about the plot: this is one movie that really moves, and with such speed and logic that you can barely catch your breath.

The cast reads very much like a Who's Who of acclaimed actors of the day.  Leading man Gene Hackman was fresh from his Oscar-winning performance in THE FRENCH CONNECTION.  Shelly Winters, Ernest Borgnine, and Red Buttons were all former Oscar winners. Carol Lynley received heavy-weight critical acclaim in earlier films and Stella Stevens was the popular star of many light comedies--and gave the performance of career when she stood her image on its head.  Jack Albertson and Roddy McDowell were noted character actors, and even comparatively minor roles such as the ship's captain and chaplin went to such notables as Leslie Neilson and Arthur O'Connell.  Together they make the unlikely nature of the story seem entirely plausible.

The recently released ""Special Edition"" DVD cannot, sadly, compensate for the loss of the big screen--but that aside it is really quite fine.  The print is virtually pristine, and while the sound is a bit lacking it is solid enough to make me wonder at those who complain.  The bonus material is also very good, including considerable ""Making Of"" information, brief interviews with surviving members of the cast, thoughts about iconographic subtext, and story board samples.  The commentary track by director Ronald Neame is both informative and entertaining, and while the commentary track by Carol Lynley, Stella Stevens, and Pamela Sue Martin is somewhat spotty it is enjoyable none the less.  Recommended as a classic of its kind.

280056,3,6300247031,"There are a hundred and thirty-three reviews written for this film before mine. It's an okay movie, and I have little to add, good or bad, to its assessment.

But, for those who've seen this film, I do have this little which might amuse you:

It occured to me, watching this film for the first time earlier in the evening, that I'd seen this particular story somewhere before. A leader takes a group of difficult people on an arduous journey towards a promised land. Along the way, he briefly gets separated from them as he climbs up for guidance. While away, they become distracted and unruly, inviting his wrath upon his return. Ultimately, they complete their journey, but the leader himself (who takes undue pride in having accomplished the trip ""on his own"") is only allowed to view the promised land from afar; he dies before being allowed to enter it.

In a nutshell, this is the tale of The Poseidon Adventure. It is also, of course, the tale of Moses, which is what forms the basis for the plot of this movie. Because a film that does something like this *must* explicitly do so at one point or another, the Jewish couple discuss near the beginning (as they travel to Israel) that they might travel to the mountain where Moses had received the Ten Commandments. The film knew what it was doing, but it is subtle enough that I doubt many people see it. That's why I thought I'd mention it. It doesn't make the movie any better or worse than what it is otherwise--and you can read the other reviews here for an assessment of that--but it's an interesting tidbit that I wanted to share.",1147478400,5,1592,4.54006968641115
280057,5,6300247031,"Yes this is a great set, however when I checked out disc #2 it only listed 6 special features, not 9 as listed on the box. I am missing something.

280088,3,6300247031,"How often have you run into someone who feels that a film adaptation of a novel is never as good as the novel itself? It certainly can be annoying, especially if all you want to do is lose yourself in visual splendor. But I'm afraid I have to side with the literary aficionados in the case of ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" a well intentioned disaster flick that delivers plenty of action but skimps on deep, meaningful emotion, a quality that made Paul Gallico's original novel such a fascinating read. What little human drama that remains is shallow and brief, almost to the point of being completely unnecessary. It's basically an abridged version of the text, stripped of all complexity in order to present a bare bones action adventure. I suppose in that sense, this film does deserve some credit; action films are entertaining, and the fact that the filmmakers understood that showed that they knew how to appeal to a wider audience. And I have to admit: the scenes of destruction were fun to watch.

But that doesn't change the fact that this is an incredibly superficial film, great to look at but at times difficult to stay connected with. The transition from book to screen resulted in several watered down elements, not the least of which was character portrayals. I felt that the novel had an almost fable-like quality, presenting the kind of characters found in fairy tales and nursery rhymes: one-dimensional yet important in plot advancement. While they represented a wide range of caricature-type personalities that conflicted, they each served a purpose that almost supernaturally gets the passengers to try and reach the hull of the S.S. Poseidon. They all followed the leadership of Reverend Frank Scott despite emotional turmoil, distrust, hidden feelings of love and rejection, and at times, full blown hatred. It was as if they were somehow drawn to Scott despite the fact that most of the group was unwilling to follow him.

But most of that has been disregarded for the film adaptation. Now the characters are much less interesting, especially in the way that they all come together so willingly and set aside feelings of hostility in order to work towards their goal. That may be an incredibly odd and heartless thing to say, but I can't help but feel that the story was meant to embody the characteristics of a legend, something you don't necessarily believe but you do understand. The legend as Gallico saw it pitted a group of men and women against all the odds in a capsized ocean liner, each one assigned a personality type that never faltered. It poses some questions. How can anyone expect to make a perilous journey with an antisocial, resentful former actress? How about with a hard-nosed New York cop who remains suspicious, angry, and enabling of his abusive wife? Or maybe a brave yet unhealthy old woman who never seems to think she can accomplish anything because of her excessive weight? I could go on, but you get the point. These are all caricatures in the original novel, defined right from the start and unchanging even in the midst of disaster.

In this Irwin Allen production, we have Gene Hackman as Reverend Scott, who takes it upon himself to lead a group of Poseidon survivors to safety after a freak title wave literally turns their lives upside down on New Years Eve. Most people are skeptical and unflinching, but some do follow him: Lieutenant Mike Rogo (Ernest Borgnine), a New York cop; his wife, Linda (Stella Stevens), an angry woman who's afraid the past will catch up with her; Manny Rosen (Jack Albertson) and his wife, Belle (Shelly Winters); Susan Shelby (Pamela Sue Martin) and her know-it-all younger brother, Robin (Eric Shea); the lonely James Martin (Red Buttons); the frightened young singer, Nonnie Parry (Carol Lynley); and the crewman Acres (Roddy McDowall). They trek across the ship, working their way up towards the keel and back to the propeller shaft in the hopes that they can be rescued. Along the way they experience death, obstructions, and limited physical capabilities. They're being tested, pretty much to the point of questioning whether or not their efforts have been for nothing.

Fans of the novel will immediately notice the story changes: Sue and Robin's parents have been eliminated, as have The Beamer, Pamela, Hubert Muller, Mrs. Kinsale, and Kemal; Linda's hostility is almost exclusively directed at her husband instead of humanity in general; Rogo's bigotry, ignorance, and anger was dropped in favor of a more flexible demeanor; and Martin replaces Hubert Muller as the one with the caring, protective instincts for Nonnie (which are much more subdued). There are also other differences, ones that prevent me from going into detail due to spoiling the plot. I'll say this much; some of the deaths occur at different times while other lives are spared altogether, and the ending is completely different.

Despite this review seeming like a negative rant, the truth is that ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is not an especially bad movie. But it definitely is missing a lot of the emotional qualities that made Gallico's novel a great read. Maybe I was just too taken with it; anyone who reads a novel first will almost surely moan and complain about the foibles of its film adaptation, especially if the novel was well-written (I'm sure the films generated from Stephen King's works undergo just as much scrutiny, maybe more so). Or maybe I'm too dense to appreciate nearly two hours of nautical peril. But whatever the case, this didn't quite do it for me. If those of you reading this think that I've completely missed the point, then I'm sorry to have disappointed you. Next time I'll try harder.",1147392000,,5682,4.914583333333334
280089,5,6300247031,"Finally, TCF releases a DVD version of the film we can all live with, with extras!!

Having seen the film during it's initial run, and seeing it an additional 12 times in the theaters, i was obviously awestruck by the film's special effects, and the superb acting involved.

By now, many people since have seen the film, and with luck, hopefully a new generation will see the original, as those will no doubt see the remake that is in the theaters.

As a child, the first viewing of the film was an experience, as effects of that magnitude has never really been shown on the screen. The theater was packed and i had to sit with strangers as there were not 3 seats in a row for myself and my parents. I was 11, so it made no difference where i sat, as long as i didn't sit next to a smoker (smoking was allowed in the movies then).

What opened up my eyes was the acting, and the actors involved. Last time i saw Stella Stevens and Shelley Winters in a film together was 'The Mad Room', an adult horror/melodrama. Seeing them together again was cool, but Shelley, boy did she gain some weight. Even in 1971's 'What's The Matter With Helen?"" she must have started to gain even then. Stella still looks great!

One thing that i remember while seeing the film in the theater was the audience's reactions. The special effects were a delight to see, as many in the audience, including myself, has never been seen before.

All in the audience cried twice. Shelley's death scene, and Hackman's.

Rarely at the end of a film has this occured. A standing ovation. Happened every time i saw it, and just goes to show how effective a film can be.

This 2-DVD set deserves a standing ovation on many counts. I won't bore you with the specifics, as Amazon.com has already listed them, but will be rather frank in letting you know that the extras are worth the price alone, aside from the great film.

If anyone reading this article has not seen the original, please, do not base an opinion on it if seeing the new version. Very rare are remakes more superior than the originals. In many  cases, only the special effects makes a difference (like Titanic).  We all know what happens, and the eventual outcome at the climax.

Despite the special effects, superb acting, glorious sets and the chance to see Carol Lynly lip-synch 'The Morning After', the original version also has a type of humor that is so 70's, but it has to be seen to be appreciated.

I again applaud TCF for making things right and releasing the film with extras that gives us more insight and information on a film that is a classic tale of adventure.",1147305600,3,2605,4.458947368421053

In playing the film on my one working surround system, the opening theme music mixes like surround sound or 5.1, so don't be fooled by English Stereo.  During the capsize, the water rushing over the boat while everyone is flying about comes out of the rear speakers.  Very vital attempts were made to put this film in some sourt of surround sound as possible, and it really adds to it.

280092,5,6300247031,"Timed to coincide with the big-screen remake ""Poseidon,"" 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment are releasing 2-disc special editions of two classic star-studded disaster movies, including the 1972 original ""The Poseidon Adventure"" starring Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Shelley Winters and Roddy McDowell among a crew of 15 Academy Award winners. Produced by the legendary Irwin Allen (who made a career in the 1970s of turning out big-budget disaster movies) the movie, based on a novel of the same name by Paul Gallico, tells the story of the aging liner Poseidon, which is hit by a 90-foot tidal wave that knocks her over on her final voyage from New York to Greece.
Featuring impressive special effects for its time and excellent performances from its cast, the movie manages to rise above a trite script and corny dialogue as they travel through an upside-down world, into the bowels of the ship in the hope of rescue from above.
Perhaps the main attraction of this movie is the sets, which effectively create a world turned on its head that leaves passengers walking on the ceilings of a maze of passageways and falling into what was just seconds before the roof of a giant ballroom. The movie proved to be a smash hit in 1972 and itself garnered nine Oscar nominations.
The movie was previously released on DVD as a relatively bare-bones effort, an oversight which has been corrected here in what is a virtual embarrassment of riches for those of us who love to scour through the special features of those shiny discs. Alongside two audio commentaries, one featuring director Ronald Neame and a second with cast members Pamela Sue Martin, Stella Stevens and Carol Lynley are ten all-new featurettes that include a retrospective by the cast and crew and the AMC Backstory that looked behind the making of the movie. The longest of these short documentaries by far is the Backstory presentation that clocks in just short of a half-hour at 25:08 and details not just the fight by Allen to bring the novel to the screen, but also on-camera interviews with the likes of Roddy McDowell, Sheila Metthews Allen and Stella Stevens.
Fox apparently was reluctant to finance the $5 million picture and tried to kill the movie even after work had started on it. It was up to Allen to raise half of the budget, something he managed when he interrupted two rich friends playing cards at the neighboring country club who said ""Yes, but let us get back to the game."" The two men subsequently became even more wealthy.
The shortest documentary ""Turning over the ship"" on the effects shots in the picture is a mere 2:26.
The other documentaries cover such elements as the song ""The Morning After,"" the religious themes of the movie, how some of the scenes were created and a featurette, which this DVD shares with ""The Towering Inferno,"" on writer Stirling Sillipant.
Even given its short length at 6:27 is the featurette ""The R.M.S. Queen Mary"" which gives a fascinating history of the liner which served not only as a location for exterior shots of the ""Poseidon"" and the design of the ship, but also in the genesis of the idea for the novel. Apparently Gallico had taken a trip on the Queen Mary in the 1950s when it had been hit by a large wave. Tilting slightly plates and glasses went flying until the ship righted itself. Years later as Gallico sat down to write a novel the memory came back to him.
Perhaps the most famous shot of the movie is of the character Terry falling from a table into the glass ceiling below. This stunt was performed by actor Ernie Osatti, who was asked to do it so the movie could say that a number of the stunts had been performed by the actors themselves. This is recounted by Osatti in the 4:09 documentary ""Falling up with Ernie.""
Of the two commentaries the solo effort by Neame is the most involving with the director commending his cast for spending virtually an entire movie being ""damped down"" with hoses before practically every shot. Neame also reveals that he was ""terrified"" when he heard that Gallico would be seeing the movie because he had not stayed faithful to the novel, but was relieved to find out that the novelist loved the film.
Neame also explained the use of the ""title"" on the front of the movie which would seem to a casual observer to be a spoiler. As the movie opens we learn from a blurb on the screen that ""only a handful of survivors"" made it through the capsized ship. As Neame tells us, this was included as a means of holding the audiences attention through the first 20 minutes of the picture as we are introduced to the impressive cast with the audience trying to figure out who will survive.
The second cast commentary by Martin, Stevens and Lynley has, strangely enough, more periods of silence as the three seem to become involved in watching the movie unfold. It is also more anecdotal in nature. Stevens, for example, recounts getting into trouble recently for having her picture taken with the model of the ship (which apparently is on display at the maritime museum in Long Beach, Calif.), until it was learned she had appeared in the movie.
The three also talk about the casting and even mention how they had expressed an interest in making cameo appearances in the new movie, a notion which was met with no enthusiasm by the studio.
Perhaps the most interesting special feature is also the most unusual, an interactive feature that allows the viewer to follow the escape through schematics of the ship as they watch the movie. With a boat graphic in the lower right corner of the picture as a prompt, a screen comes up that shows the viewer where the survivors are, the path they took to get there and who is left. The schematic is based (as the movie and book were also) on the R.M.S Queen Mary.
Rounding out the DVD is a 10-minute archival 1972 promotional feature on the movie, two teaser trailers and the theatrical trailer, three storyboard comparisons and the transcription of an article that appeared in an edition of ""American Cinematographer"" with selectable images that take the viewer to image galleries.",1146960000,117,6084,4.718984962406015
280093,5,6300247031,"""The Poseidon Adventure"" is a great disaster film from Irwin Allen, who eventually became known as the Master of Disaster after this came out in 1972. This was the movie that started the disaster film craze of the 70s, and deservedly so. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is about a luxury liner traveling the open seas on New Year's Eve that has the unfortunate task of running into a 90 foot tidal wave that proceeds to capsize the ship and turn it upside down thanks to an undersea earthquake. Afterwards a small group of survivors try to make it to the top (or bottom) of the ship hoping to be rescued. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" starts off as a silly comedy for the first 20 minutes, where they introduce the main characters. These characters are portrayed by an all-star cast: Gene Hackman as a priest who's always barking orders at everyone; Ernest Borgnine as a cop who's constantly complaining about everything; Stella Stevens as Borgnine's wife, a former prostitute; Shelley Winters and Jack Albertson as a Jewish couple; Red Buttons as a lonely bachelor; Carol Lynley as the ship's pop singer; and Leslie Nielsen as the ship's captain. After the opening 20 minutes the real excitement begins. The passengers have to endure many dangers while trying to escape, and during the course of the film the real question is the same as it is in every disaster picture: who will die and who will survive? I won't dare say who dies and who survives. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is an excellent movie for most of its two hours, and I enjoyed the action, special effects, and the performances (which are terrific). Sure Borgnine has the worst written role in the film, but so what. He'll either make you laugh or get on your nerves. I felt a little of both. Same goes for Stevens who is a good foil for Borgnine. Hackman plays the reverend to the hilt, a man who won't let anyone give up. Winters is very funny as the Jewish woman who worries she won't make it because she's overweight, and Albertson plays off of her very well as her husband. Buttons is very good as the bachelor who's sweet and caring. Lynley gets to show off some singing talents, and does a decent job of singing as she does at trying to escape from hell upside down. Nielsen is a lot of fun to watch as he plays it deadly straight here long before playing it deadly straight in ""Airplane!"" and ""The Naked Gun"" comedies. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is pure adventure indeed. Terrific entertainment. And I can't wait to see the upcoming remake ""Poseidon"", which opens in theaters May 12th. It's the one movie opening this summer that I'm anxiously awaiting. Whether it'll be as good as the original film remains to be seen, but I'm sure it'll be better than the awful TV movie remake that aired on NBC last November.",1146614400,2,2767,4.626016260162602
280094,4,6300247031,"Watching this film again really does bring back the memories of seeing it for the first time in the cinema as a kid.
The 1970s saw a glut of disaster films but the Poseidon Adventure remains one of the best.

The plot sees an ageing liner - the SS Poseidon on her last cruise before being scrapped. Sailing out on this last voyage, on the cheap and with a disregard for safety by her owners, she encounters a tidal wave which capsizes her in spectacular fashion. From that point onwards, it is a desperate struggle for the surviving passengers and crew, to climb upwards through the stricken ship in search of rescue.

Casting and characterisation is generally good (with just some corn at times, hell this was the 1970s...).
Gene Hackman is a rebellious preacher who finds his own particular brand of very passionate faith, severely tested by the unfolding events surrounding the unfortunate SS Poseidon.
The ever dependable Ernest Borgnine is a cynical cop who has to dig deep into his own character as events threaten to overrun both him and his fellow survivors...
Shelley Winters makes her famous underwater swim in this film when she has to save Hackman's character.
You also get to see Leslie Neilson in a straight role as the ship's captain, infuriated by the reckless cost cutting of the owners...

The film used the original SS Queen Mary as the set and the result is a convincing, and at times gritty realism. The film is surprisingly brutal for its time and the band of survivors really does keep dwindling, as they make their desperate trek through the upturned and very dangerous hull of the ship. The upturned hull itself is a brilliantly realised world where all points of reference are changed. Ceilings have become floors and staircases are inverted. Fires, scalding stream, twisted metal, and flooding all add to the chaos and confusion.
The film runs along at a cracking pace and keeps the viewer's interest until the end.

That said, I would like to add my criticism to that already expressed by other reviewers of the fact that the existing dvd is in mono. Why?
I just hope that Twentieth Century Fox are to remedy this on the upcoming special edition dvd this year and give it the 5.1 soundtrack that both the film and viewer so richly deserve.",1146441600,5,2267,4.717171717171717

Why after the first release (That wasn't in Stereo) now this New 2-Disk set with all the added extra's, doesn't even have Dolby Stereo 5.1?  I would think that any Action or Disaster picture wouldn't be completed unless it has Stereo Surround sound.

The passengers are at first confused but then the realize they must go down to the hull to reach safety.  This means they must go up in direction to survive.

Most passengers are in the ballroom and a small band start the escape before the ship sinks.

Reverend Scott (Gene Hackman) - The reverend has questions of faith and is going on retreat to decide what to do with his life.

Rogo (Ernest Borgnine) - NYPD vice officer on his honeymoon.

Linda Rogo (Stella Stevens) - Bride of Rogo (hey that would make a great movie title!) who was a professional girl prior to he marriage (i.e. hooker).

Manny Rosen (Jack Albertson) and Belle Rosen (Shelley Winters) - The Rosens are a retired couple on their way to visit the Holy Lands.

Martin (Red Buttons) - A proverbial bachelor on vacation who has a crush on Nona.

Nona (Carol Lynley) - The singer in the band who has self confidence issues and a brother who is a drug addict (but he doesn't make it through the capsize).

 Susan (Pamela Sue Martin) - A teenager who has a crush on the reverend.

Robin (Eric Shea) - Susan's little brother who actually is the most together of the group.

Acres (Roddy McDowell) - A purser who accompanies the group.

The plot line is simple, who will overcome each of the obstacles.  Not all will survive, except the kids - kids cannot die in disaster films.  For the most part, these twists are well thought out and fairly plausible (for the situation).  The dialog is more there to establish the characters and it does this well.  You come to care for the characters and it does it so well, that you do not hate any of the characters.

The advertising tag line for the film was created by 15 Academy Award winners (including 5 of the actors).

Shelly Winters received the Golden Globe Award and an Oscar nomination for her great performance.

The special effects are fairly tame by today's standards but they were beyond cutting edge for 1972.  This film defined the multiple jeopardy film (or disaster film).  Anyone who is into action film, this is must have.

This movie also produced the Oscar winning song The Morning After.  This is one of the best songs from a movie.

I hadn't seen ""The Poseidon Adventure"" in a number of a years and approached it with a little trepidition.  Much to my surprise it was not the schlock I was expecting but rousing entertainment.  Why does this film work where others of it's ilk do not?  Credit scriptwriters Stirling Silliphant and Wendell Mayes for crafting characters that you care about instead of caricatures.  There are a number of fine actors in the cast, many of them Oscar winners, whose performances endear them to the audience.  Much to my surprise about the only performance I found unbearable came from the usually reliable Gene Hackman as the pompous preacher.  Maybe this was only a paycheck to you, Gene?  Credit also has to go to director Ronald Neame who keeps the film gripping despite the potentially off-putting carnage.  Impressively claustrophobic art direction adds to the film's mounting tension.  I can accept a fictionalized account of a doomed vessel over James Cameron's trivialization of a real one in ""Titanic"".

Yeah the story isn't exactly Jack London, the theme song is, as noted in another review, cheesy but that's half the appeal. This is one of those movies you can pop up some popcorn, crack open the fizzy drink of your choice, pop this in the DVD player and check your mind at the door.

Some of the acting is pretty over the top, though I personally liked Ernest Borgnine as the New York cop and Stella Stevens as his wife...and LOVED the Rosens...both Jack Albertson and Shelly Winters were great as the retired deli owners! Leslie Neilson was about what I expected as the Captain and Fred Sadoff wasn't half bad as a cut-rate Greek J. Bruce Ismay wannabe.

Ernest Borgnine also does well in the role he was born to play--a tough bone-head who is basically a nice guy.

The character actors are all terrific, with special mention to Borgnine, Stevens, Hackman, and of course the great Shelly Winters. I forgot, also, just how powerful John William's score is....music of a subtle pulsating, suspenseful, throbbing sound that adds quite a bit to the overall effect of the film.  The extras on disc 2 are also quite a bit of fun and will interest anyone who admires this suspenseful, marvelous movie.  Luigi ~ NYC",1112054400,3,1140,4.546341463414634

280215,4,6300247031,"Previously known as the creator of such 1960s TV shows as ""Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea"" and ""Time Tunnel"", producer Irwin Allen earned the title ""Master Of Disaster"" in 1972, when THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE was unleashed on audiences and basically kicked off the disaster film era that was to dominate the cinema until nearly the end of the Seventies.  Putting together an all-star cast (fifteen past Oscar winners), a robust plot (courtesy of Paul Gallico's 1969 novel), and Oscar-winning special effects, this film had it all, and in many ways still does.

This is the saga of the S.S. ""Poseidon"", en route from New York to Athens on what is to be her final voyage on New Year's Eve.  But Mother Nature has other plans for this ship, which one of the crew refers to as ""a hotel with a bow and a stern.""  A massive undersea earthquake northwest of Crete has created a monstrous tsunami; and at one minute past midnight, that wave slams into the ship with such violence that it causes the boat to completely turn over.  What began as a celebration of the new year's arrival has suddenly turned into hell and a lot of water.  It is up to a rebellious priest (Gene Hackman) to lead as many people as he can to safety; even here, he finds opposition from an argumentative New York cop (Ernest Borgnine).  But for anyone to survive, they now must somehow get to the bottom of the ship, which is now up, and do it before the boat finally goes under.

Although some of the melodrama is hugely forced by today's standards (sometimes, it's even a bit laughable), and the notion that a tsunami can completely overturn a passenger liner is a bit of a stretch in reality, THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE still manages to work because of the sheer force of its being a survival story.  Hackman and Borgnine, not surprisingly, are very good antagonists, but the cast also includes Shelley Winters, Red Buttons, Carol Lynley, Roddy McDowall, Pamela Sue Martin, and Stella Stevens.  British director Ronald Neame works with a solid screenplay adaptation by Stirling Silliphant and Wendell Mayes, and the Oscar-winning effects work of L.B. Abbott and A.D. Flowers is still impressive, even after the spectacle that was James Cameron's TITANIC.

Topped off by the Oscar-winning song ""The Morning After"" (later a big hit for Maureen McGovern) and an early grandiose score by John Williams, THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE manages to maintain plenty of tension and terror, even though many of its situations have become cliches by now.  It is a very good film to own, especially if you are into all-star epics similar to it.",1099008000,2,2587,4.737193763919822
280216,4,6300247031,"What starts out as a New Years' pleasure cruise soon turns into disaster for the passengers and crew of the S.S. Poseidon.  Starring Gene Hackman (Rev. Scott), Ernest Borgnine (Mike Rogo), Red Buttons (James Martin), Carol Lynley (Nonnie), Roddy McDowall (Acres), Stella Stevens (Linda Rogo), Jack Albertson (Manny Rosen), Shelley Winters (Belle Rosen), and Pamela Sue Martin (Susan Shelby), this movie continues in the fashion of other classic disaster movies of the early 1970s.

The Poseidon is sailing from New York to Athens packed full of holiday passengers.  After surviving a bit of rough weather, the Poseidon soon resumes sailing in calm seas.  However, a report is delivered to the Captain, played by Leslie Nielsen, describing an undersea earthquake near 8 on the richter scale.  This quake is causing huge waves due to the shock, and the Poseidon, on her last voyage, is heading directly into the epicenter of the quake.

Soon, a huge wall of water slams into the ship and leaves it capsized, with the hull facing up.  Rev. Scott soon manages to save a group of passengers by having them climb up the large atrificial Christmas tree located in the main ballroom to a balcony on the next level.

The group is soon snaking their way through the doomed vessel,  trying to reach the engine room.  The hull is only supposed to be an inch thick in the engine room, so Rev. Scott seems to think that this would be their best place to be rescued.  Meanwhile, the inevitable conflicts break out among the group members, especially between Scott and Mr. Rogo.  Despite these arguments, the group manages to keep moving upwards toward the hull. The upturned tables and, in one scene, barberchairs, add greatly to the capsized illusion.  After some harrowing escapes, and despite the loss of a few of the survivors along the way, the group manages to finally reach the engine room, but will they be rescued or is it too late?

I thought this was a very good movie.  The acting is first rate.  Gene Hackman is excellent in his role as the defrocked Rev. Scott, while Borgnine, Albertson, Buttons, and the rest of the cast do a good job as well.  The special effects are very good, considering this movie is over thirty years old.  The scene where the tidal wave slams into the Poseidon is exciting, and the undersea explosions are captivating, too. However, I thought the ending was a little anti-climactic and could have been done better. Still,  I recommend this film.  Action and disaster movie fans will surely enjoy it.",1094083200,7,2524,4.812064965197216
280217,3,6300247031,"""The Poseidon Adventure"" (1972) is a terrific thriller which ushered in the era of '70's disaster movies which reached its zenith with the thrilling ""The Towering Inferno"" (1974).  Actually, it's a tossup among fans over which is better.  My vote goes to the latter, but this Irwin Allen-produced gem is a close second.

There's no use regurgitating the plot, since everyone knows it involves a capsized luxury liner.  The real joy here is the cast, which includes Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Stella Stevens, Jack Albertson, Shelly Winters, Carol Lynley, Red Buttons, Roddy MacDowell, Eric Shea, Pamela Sue Martin, Arthur O'Connell, and, in a serious cameo, Leslie Neilsen as the ship's ill-fated captain.  Winters got the Oscar nomination for her touching work as a matronly Jewish grandmother, but the real knockout performances here are by Stevens in a very funny, scene stealing scorcher of a turn as a foul-mouthed ex-hooker, Borgnine as her bitter, pessimistic policeman husband, and especially Hackman as a nearly insane, defrocked minister who doesn't believe in prayer and has a adversarial relationship with God.  In fact, while some find Hackman over-the-top, this is one of my all-time screen performances and shows what a great actor can do with unusual material.  (In a word, he rules.)  Albertson is also very touching as Winter's husband, and Buttons scores solidly as a lonely bachelor who falls in love with Lynley, who is mourning her brother's death.  Actually, the only weak link in the cast is young Shea, who is unbearably obnoxious as pre-teen Robin Shelby, who at one point gets lost in the ship.  Would that he stayed lost, viewers may find themselves saying.

The direction by Ronald Neame, the musical score, editing and photography are all stellar, and the Oscar-winning special effects still impress 30+ years later.  They all more than make up for the by-the-numbers script, which Stirling Silliphant very loosely adapted from Paul Gallico's best seller.  Silliphant's introductory scenes and initial character development are pretty lame, to say the least, but things pick up considerably after disaster strikes, and for once it's not that easy to figure out who will make it out alive and who won't.  (Let's just say only the two Shelby kids seems safe bets.)  Among the highlights:  the spectacular capsizing sequence, the harrowing trip through the engine room, and the final fifteen minutes, which are almost unbearably suspenseful.  In fact, the film never bores and maintains an admirable amount of suspense for nearly 90 of its 115 minutes.

In all, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" remains a terrific spectacle and companion piece to the superior ""The Towering Inferno.""  In fact, the two films make a great day-long double feature, especially on a rainy day.  Even though Irwin Allen could not maintain the high standards of these two films, and followed them with awful offerings like ""The Swarm"" and ""When Time Ran Out..."" that gave the genre the bad name it maintains to this day, for these two films, he definitely earned the title ""master of disaster.""  **** (out of *****) for the film; ** (out of *****) for the DVD, which like ""The Towering Inferno"" offers less special features than the special edition VHS version released several years ago.  Maybe one day Stevens, Hackman, Borgnine and Winters will reunite for a cast commentary.  One can only hope.",1093737600,6,3397,5.114130434782608

Only Irwin Allen could turn something so out landish as a ship gettin hit by a tidal waze on new years eve into something very realistic. Like in real life disasters theres always a chain of events that lead up to the tragedy. In posidon adventure Allen gives us little snippets of infomation giving us an idea of what is about happen.

Stevens also has the best line in the movie: ""...just panties...what else do I need?"" Finally, a personal note: I was the same age as Eric Shea when this movie came out and I WAS that somewhat obnoxious, ocean-liner-obsessed kid at age 10 (""...the Andrea Doria stayed afloat ten hours.."").

While all the performers did very well, my favorites were Stella Stevens as the foul-mouthed ex-hooker starting a new life with her cop husband; Ernest Borgnine as Rogo, the aforementioned cop who brought all his trademark bluster, and innocence, to the role; Roddy McDowall, the oh-so-polite steward who always called everybody sir or ma'am; and Jack Albertson, the devoted husband of the doomed Shelley Winters.

280248,2,6300247031,"The Poseidon Adventure is regarded as one of the great disaster movies of the seventies, along with blockbusters like 1970's Airport and 1974's The Towering Inferno.  Based on Paul Gallico's novel of the same name, it's about a sinking ship, and the struggle of small band of survivors to escape.  The S.S. Poseidon is on its final voyage as a cruise ship, on its way to the scrap yard.  When this massive ocean liner is overturned by a tidal wave as a result of an earthquake on New Year's Eve, its passengers must make important choices which will lead to their salvation or perishing.  Under the leadership of Rev. Scott (Gene Hackman), a radical minister who believes God isn't to be prayed to because he doesn't listen, a small group of ten makes their way through the bowels of the sheep towards the propeller shaft, which seems to be the only hope of their salvation.  In the process, viewers are treated to stunning scenes of disaster, as the survivors must avoid fire and water, flooded hallways, and unexpected explosions.  Suspense increases, because you wonder who will survive and who will die.

Although on the surface it's the story of a sinking ship, like the submerged ship itself, most of this movie is below the surface.  The quest for survival has strong religious overtones, with the aim to be saved from certain death. Even the name of the boat - S.S. Poseidon, god of the sea - is in keeping with the religious theme.  Fittingly, in keeping with this idea of salvation, the main character is a minister, who points to the one way of escape from doom: ""Life is up there."" The religious background actually turns it into the gospel according to Rev. Frank Scott.  His call for people to join him has a religious note, reminding one of a preaching calling for conversion: ""I appeal to you for the last time.  If you stay here you will certainly die."" In fact, the movie begins with a conversation between two ministers, setting the stage for the fight for salvation that will come in the crisis ahead.  The other minister represents orthodoxy, and takes exception to Rev. Scott's liberal views.  But Scott is a liberal and radical minister, and in his sermon before the crisis preaches: ""Don't pray to God to solve your problems.  Pray to the God inside you."" His message is: It's up to you, be fighters, do it alone, fight for yourselves because God won't fight for you.  When the disaster strikes, these two ministers religious thinking goes head to head.  The conservative says: ""Pray for us, but don't do this."" Liberal Scott says: ""Maybe by doing this we can save ourselves.""  Orthodoxy is presented as old-fashioned and irrelevant, because the conservative minister perishes, while Scott is the messianic figure who leads his followers to salvation.  Towards the conclusion he makes an ultimate sacrifice to save his flock (after cursing God), disappearing in the flames for their sake.  The overtones to Christ's work is clear, and so is the message: Old fashioned religion doesn't work because God isn't involved in man's lives, and the new religion is for man to trust in himself as God.  In the process the movie does traditional Christianity a tremendous injustice by misrepresenting orthodoxy.  The dilemma between ""pray to God"" or ""work your own salvation"" that Scott proposes simply doesn't exist.  The two are not mutually exclusive.  Prayer and trust never eliminate human responsibility.  And success in human responsibility does not exclude divine sovereignty -  Scott's assertion at the end that God hasn't fought for them is patently false, because it is only through God's providence that human efforts can succeed as they do.  The implied message is a distorted and dangerous gospel.

The movie has other weaknesses too - the ending is rather lame.  There are many cheesy scenes, such as people climbing a Christmas tree and a fat woman turned underwater swimming champ in her billowing undergarments, combined with some corny characters like a half-clad former hooker, and a hippy girl who can't keep her wits together.  And the inclusion of a former prostitute as one of the main characters seems to be more something to titillate viewers and is rather nauseating after a while.  Probably the most annoying character is young Robin, a know-all kid who is given far more credibility than he deserves.  Neither the characterization or plot is convincing, but the real attraction are the spectacular scenes of the disaster.  Even watching this movie can be a traumatic experience as you share the experience with those in the sinking ship.  What made this movie the success it was, were the thrilling scenes of disaster as a feast for the eyes.  Thankfully, it wasn't salted with an immoral love story like Titanic, but Scott's new age gospel is equally horrifying.  Ultimately even a few stunning scenes don't save this movie from the religious disaster that it is. - GODLY GADFLY",1060041600,11,4922,4.8820697954271965

There has been debate of which is the better...Poseidon Adventure or Towering Inferno. In my opinion the Poseidon reigns supreme. The casting was well done. Shelley Winters and Jack Albertson were great together. In fact they must have enjoyed working together again, as they had done back in the early days when they were both struggling to make names for themselves. Ernest Borgnine and Stella Stevens both had great roles to play with great lines but opposite each other had great chemistry and proved perfect. I suppose Gene Hackman did what was required (and a bit more) but one gets a bit tired of his continual shouting (which has become a bit of a trademark!). Towering Inferno had good performances also but Poseidon's people seemed a bit more like regular people or something and they were easier to relate too. In Towering Inforno all but a couple of the main characters were related to the building, and hence the disaster, as opposed to everyone being innocent victims in Poseidon Adventure. Poseiden Adventure also provides you with more moments where you are not sure what will happen next. I guess Towering Inferno could be a little predicable. If you are only buying one of the great disaster movies of the 70s, get Poseidon Adventure without hesitation.

280253,5,6300247031,"In the 1970s, Hollywood had a fascination with disaster movies. So many of them were made that parodies of them were made (AIRPORT and AIRPLANE e.g). However, one of the first and best disaster films of all time is THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE.
The movie takes place on the deep waters of the Atlantic Ocean. The Poseidon is on it's final voyage to Athens, Greece. The ship is top heavy and the captain wants to stop and put on more weight, but the new owners won't have it. Time is money and they want the Poseidon in Greece for the New Year so the ship is ordered ahead at full speed. Unfortunately a major underwater earthquake takes place off the coast of Crete sending a massive tidal wave over 150 ft high crashing into the luxury ship. The vessle capsizes and the passengers only hope for escape is to climb from the top of the ship to the bottom.
The movie stars a supremely talented cast that includes 15 Academy Award winners. The special effects are still impressive, even more so considering that there was no CGI back in the 1970s. The story is strong and though the plot is interesting, the film focuses more on character and relationships than just action and excitement (a lesson more modern movies could learn from). The dialogue is real, yet never offensive or cheesy. The score underlies the film's action, adding to the film's effect, yet never overpowering the action that takes place on the screen. It was written by John Williams and his musical underscoring foreshadows the master memorable movie music composer that he has become. As a sidenote, I found it interesting that Leslie Neilson played the Captain in this movie and that he later went on to gain fame in his parody of disaster flicks.
Overall, THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE is a two hour treat worth watching. It is the best disaster flick ever made. It's a movie that not only has historical cinematic interest, but also stands on its own as a piece of moviemaking.
The DVD includes a remastered widescreen version of the movie, the original theatrical trailer, and biographies of the cast.",1051920000,,2063,4.68595041322314
280284,5,6300247031,"I will resist the urge to compare this 1972 classic disaster movie to James Cameron's Titanic because The Poseidon Adventure tells a very different kind of story.  The first thing you notice about this film is its truly remarkable cast; there are no less than 15 Academy Award winners showcased in this epic film.  While the special effects are very good for the most part, this film deals much more with the personal stories of the would-be survivors than it does the actual disaster.  The Poseidon is carrying hundreds of passengers to Greece on its final voyage; the representative of the owner orders the captain to proceed at full speed, despite the captain's (Leslie Nielsen) concern about insufficient ballast after weathering a fierce storm at sea.  As the passengers celebrate the New Year at midnight, the ship is hit with a 90-foot tidal wave caused by an underwater earthquake and turns completely over in the water.
Gene Hackman plays a maverick preacher named Scott who leads a group of survivors in a bid to save themselves, but only a select number of people follow him because the ship's purser insists everyone should stay where they are.  Reverend Scott's followers include a man and wife (Jack Albertson and Shelley Winters) who were on their way to see their grandson for the first time, a young lady (the exceedingly cute, pre-Dynasty Pamela Sue Martin) and her annoying but generally helpful little brother (Eric Shea), an incredibly loud and obnoxious former cop (Ernest Borgnine) and his equally annoying former prostitute wife (Stella Stevens), a hardworking and all-around nice fellow (Red Buttons), a singer (Carol Lynley), and a shipmate (Roddy McDowell).  Their journey ""up"" through the bowels of the ship in search of salvation is an arduous one that some individuals will not live to complete.  The journey will be one of self-discovery and emotional trauma for all involved, though.  Shelley Winters is absolutely wonderful in her role, although I myself found some of the comments by her and others about her weight being a burden to the group quite troubling.  Red Buttons is also terrific, outshining all others in his humanity.  Naturally, though, Reverend Scott is the most fascinating character of them all, and Hackman gives one of his finest performances ever in this role.  His unorthodox religious views and behavior are brought into sharp focus at the end, as his character comes to take on a strange martyrdom both similar and wholly dissimilar to that of Christ himself.
The Poseidon Adventure clearly ranks among the best disaster films ever made.  This is a very human drama, with some characters sacrificing their very lives for others, others complaining and rebelling at every turn, and the most vulnerable souls clinging to the hope of survival and placing all of their faith in a man who promises them safety and salvation.  Allegorical questions such as why God allows the kind of human disaster that takes place on the Poseidon are fairly obvious, making this a motion picture that will stay with you long after the story is concluded.",1051315200,5,3090,5.0

Bizarrely, characters would pair off and have sex in various corners during their quest to reach the bowels of the ship. Pamela Sue Martin...Caroly Lynley....Stela Stevens.....Chalk one major missed opportunity. Especially in widescreen. The mere thought of hotpants kept Gene Hackman alive underwater ten minutes after the average man would of exhaled. Remember that the next time you get on an ocean liner.

I had never seen this film, but it was the last film my parents-in-law had seen in the theaters! They didn't like the problems dealing with a theater (some things never change), so they only buy or rent movies now. I thought I would try the movie. I was pleased.
Some of the special effects are noticeably older, but very few. For the most part, much of it could have been filmed a couple years ago. Part of this is that a lot of the ""effects"" are real (as opposed to so many poorly done cheap digital effects today).
The acting is good, with a little too much of the 1960s style where some actors think they have to yell or the microphone won't pick it up. Besides that, pretty good.
The action is very good, with a lot of turns and little surprises. It may not be as good as ""Speed"", but few things are (if you think ""Speed"" is not great, try viewing it again -- I often forget how good it really is).

280288,5,6300247031,"One of the best, and one the most well-known disaster films ever, the Poseidon Adventure is the story of a small group of survivors trapped in a capsized luxury ship.  The film follows their struggle to survive, and persevere in an unusual and extremely dangerous situation.  The story, based on Paul Gallico's novel, features a wonderful all-star cast, headed by Gene Hackman, and Ernest Borgnine, with Shelley Winters, Roddy McDowall, Red Buttons, Stella Stevens, Jack Albertson, Carol Lynley, Pamela Sue Martin, Eric Shea and Leslie Nielsen.
It is New Years day, just after midnight, when a huge wave strikes the USS Poseidon, twisting the huge cruise ship, and leaving it upside down in the water.  Inside, the passengers and crew, who had been joyously celebrating the New Year, are suddenly facing a deadly situation.  Emerging from the crowd trapped in the ship's dining room, is Reverend Scott (Gene Hackman), who spearheads the effort to climb ""up"", towards the bottom of the ship.  A small group of survivors join the Reverend in the journey.  The movie focuses on their adventures, as they slowly make their way through the bowels of the ship, searching for a safe route to the ""top"", staying just ahead of the rising water.  As we follow along, we learn much about the survivors as people.  The characters become defined, and we come to have strong feelings about many of them.

Reverend Scott, is constantly challenged by Rogo (Borgnine), a police officer with his own ideas of what they should be doing.  The tension between the two men, keeps the atmosphere edgy.  The group endures much, and overcomes even more, in their perilous journey.  They struggle on, through hell and hardship, because as Scott says, ""...life always matters very much"".  Although not everyone will make it to the end, the survivors never give up.  As long as there is life, there is hope.  This is the theme of the memorable Oscar winning song, ""The Morning After"".  John Williams' powerful score, earned him an Academy Award nomination too.
Shelly Winters was nominated for an Academy Award as well, and the film has many other fine performances.  Hackman, and Borgnine are marvelous, their clash of wills, creates sparks on the screen.  Roddy McDowell is very good, in an understated but brief role as a steward.  Jack Albertson was never better, and Pamela Sue Martin, TV's Nancy Drew, makes her film debut.  If you have not seen this before, you have missed a real classic.
As to the DVD itself, the widescreen presentation is without any extras, except for a trailer and skimpy cast bios.  Most regrettable, in light of the recent ""Backstory"" feature on A&E about this movie, which detailed Irwin Allen's efforts to bring this story to the screen.  Catch this feature too, for some interesting background information.  There is so much more, that could have been done, to honor this film, and the wonderful cast that worked on it so hard.  Good or bad, the success of this film, and films like Airport (1970), helped launch the 70's wave of disaster films.  Irwin Allen, would follow up himself with The Towering Inferno (1974).  A few years later, there would be an inferior Poseidon sequel, ""Beyond the Poseidon Adventure"".",1030924800,7,3221,4.9185185185185185

Ernest Borgnine , who was in damn good shape in this movie is like the Archie Bunker of the ship with his wise cracks and Gene Hackman comes off incredibly beyond a super hero status.
Just think of what could have happened if him and Pamela Sue Martin were to find a quiet space for themselves on that boat WOOOOWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Shelly Winters is the heavy woman on the ship who shows incredible bravery.  Every time she has to hold her breathe to swim under water in that scene I see if I could do it like maybe most of you.

280290,4,6300247031,"""The Poseidon Adventure"" was the first movie that had viewers heading back to theatres for a third, fourth, or fifth showing. To know that it almost wasn't made because 20th-Century Fox didn't want to flip the $5 million bill makes it all the more incredible. It grossed $100 million (that's ALOT for the early 70's) and was the #1 box office draw of 1973. Now, I am a bit biased when it comes ""The Poseidon Adventure."" Movie fan that I am, this is the first one I remember going to see at the drive-in with my parents in December, 1972. And what a first movie! Imagine, in 1972 (when we were getting schmalzy film fare like ""Love Story"") watching an enormous tidal wave over turn a Queen Mary-like luxury liner. William Creber and Irwin Allen did a top notch job in filming a very believable ""hell turned upside down.""""Poseidon"" is based on a best selling 1969 novel by Paul Gallico, a tour de force of disaster at sea. The translation to film showed the characters becoming pretty cardboard and the dialouge being watered down so much the early scenes are laughably bad, but the special effects are superior for the time and one can't help but root for the wonderful cast. Gene Hackman (in a BAFTA winning role), Shelley Winters (in an Oscar nominated roll), Ernest Borgnine, Stella Stevens, Red Buttons, Carol Lynley, Pamela Sue-Martin (pre-Nancy Drew and pre-Dynasty), and even Leslie Nielson in a dramatic roll as the captain.

Stirling Silliphant's impossibly unbelievable screenplay is only eclipsed by 1978's ""The Swarm"" - a film that seemed like high art to me in 1978, and seems like a multimillion dollar practical joke 24 years later.
""The Poseidon Adventure"" was a difficult, incredibly expensive shoot (cuts were cornered in writing and continutity, however).  Many of the crew and performers must have stories about the shoot - can't we hear those in a commentary track?",1016928000,2,685,5.04424778761062

280322,4,6300247031,"This film comes in for a lot of unfair criticism as being corny, derivative, and melodramatic. Perhaps the drama is a little too high, but this is only apparent when coming into the movie halfway through. One of its best aspects is the way the drama is built up, from spoiled people enjoying their dinner dance in the opulence of a luxury liner, giving us an insight into each of their characters. The film would not convince without good special effects, and here they are superb. Not only the model work, but the skills of the set and effects designers are tested to their limit building an upside down model of a ship's engine room, with some working parts, and others spurting steam and water. Given that a credible backdrop has been built, the characters that populate the stage are no less skilfully constructed. The actors and writers have an equal hand in this. There's some young women whose main qualification is to look good in wet clothes, and the usual annoying kids, but on the whole the ensemble cast is on the whole well chosen for the characters they play. Ernest Borgnine's appearance often condemns him to play villainous roles, but here his character undergoes a change from a crass oaf into someone for whom we all feel sympathy, perhaps more so than for any of the other characters, and Borgnine convinces in his performance.... I wrote that review on 6th November 2001.. now see my review almost ten years later, from 25th December 2010: The new review refers to the DVD whereas the old was the VHS. I upgrade my review by half a star, but Amazon only allows whole stars!

It's curious how this film has stood the test of time, because there was a while during the 1980s when it was dreadfully unfashionable. Seemingly as stuck in the 1970s as Lex Luthor's polo-necked jumper and hair, and shown every year on television, The Poseidon Adventure was seen by some as the poor relation to its producer Irwin Allen's The Towering Inferno. But time has now proved kind to The Poseidon Adventure and we can now see how its slew of Oscar nominations were justified. The effects are such that it seems like the whole film is made on board an inverted ship, the danger seems real, and the technical details accurate. The film is a satisfying watch, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The journey from the ballroom to the surface takes us up a Christmas tree, through scalding steam, underwater swimming trials, and firey chimneys, but it also takes us on another journey, those of the characters. Watching the film for probably the fifth time, I centre on a different character each time. When I was a boy, I loved Oscar-winning actor Red Buttons, with his great name, and kindly face and voice, it's no surprise that I latched on to him straight away. It was only with the arrival of colour television in the 1980s that I realised that he had a head of bright orange hair, the reason for his nickname! when I watched the film in my twenties, I looked at the character of the disaffected priest, played by Academy Award winner Gene Hackman, and the fact that his journey co-incides with a journey he makes in his struggle with God. Then there's the old Jewish couple, played by Oscar-winning Grandpa Bucket actor Jack Albertson and his wife, played by Oscar-winning actress Shelley Winters. She starts as a hopeful granny, knitting for the grandson she hopes to see at the end of her voyage, with despair in the middle, followed by an heroic flourish at the end. I loved this couple in my thirties, because they reminded me very much of my (non-Jewish) grandparents. This time, I focussed much more on the character of Mike Rogo, whom I had previously regarded as a rude, uncouth man who ought to be left to drown, and saw that while he is indeed rude, and certainly uncouth, he exhibits heroism throughout the film, constantly showing his huge muscles as he climbs hand over hand to rescue someone, risking his life in the process. Troll-faced Oscar-winner Ernest Borgnine turns in a great performance, as he is believable as a tough New-York cop as well as a man who mourns the loss of other characters in the film. He is powerful enough to challenge Gene Hackman (whereas the other priest, no matter how much more moral authority he has, cannot). Rogo is also capable of winning the audience's sympathies when he has to take over from Hackman at the end of the film, no mean feat when you've spent the past 100 minutes being mean and rude. It's these characters, perhaps little more than stereotypes, but brought so believeably to life by the actors, that sell the film to me much more than its effects, no matter how well they're done. And the music's not bad too. On reflection (and on four or five viewings), I'd give this 9 out of 10 stars, because there are very few spots where this film doesn't get it right. As for the DVD, well some special features would have been nice. Actor biographies and a theatrical trailer aren't very special ""special"" features!",1005004800,3,4986,4.6466591166477915

The special effects as the partygoers begin to topple every which way is the forerunner to the sinking scene in ""Titanic"", but where that's just about the conclusion of that film, this is just the beginning!
Gene Hackman, a disillusioned minister, realizes that the only way to get help is to travel through the bowels of the upside down ship in order to get to the surface. Most passengers disbelieve him, with the exception of NY cop Ernest Borgnine and his loudmouthed wife Stella Stevens; Jack Albertson and his wife Shelley Winters, en route to join their grandchild in Israel; Pamela Sue Something (TV's Nancy Drew) and her kid brother from ""Yours, Mine, and Ours""; Red Buttons and Carol Lynley (who spends most of the movie in shock over her brother's death); and Roddy MacDowell, but he has a bum leg from the initial catastrophe. Well, in a disaster movie like this, starting out with a busted leg is like the woman coughing at the start of an Italian opera--chalk him off the list pretty early on.
I like ""The Poseidon Adventure"" because it reminds me of Moses leading the Israelites thru the Desert. Ernest Borgnine keeps arguing with every decision Hackman makes, but in the end, does what the Man of God tells him to do.

It reminds me a lot of ""Earthquake"" in the way that there is a basic setup of the main characters and their roles, then the disaster hits, and then characters are knocked off on the way to safety.  The only difference is the setting.
I agree with a previous reviewer in that the setup of the conflict between Linarcos and Capt. Harrison wasn't fully realized.  It only served as an explanation of how the ship was more easily capsized.  However it does serve as a window into Leslie Nielsen's non-comedic acting.
The other characters were too one-dimensional to be truly believable.  Gene Hackman as an atheistic minister?  Geez!  Overall, though, the star-studded cast does a decent job with a marginal script.

Like open-ended plot points?  Ask yourself: Why the conflict between the captain and Lenarcos (or however it's spelled) at the beginning?  It never comes up again, since both characters are immediately killed in the Big Gulp.  Must have been something to intrigue us while everyone was still boringly alive.
It's cruel and all to easy to make fun of Winters in her underwater scene.  Instead, ask yourself how the few remaining brain cells were removed from behind Stella Stevens' face to achieve that expression of hers when Hackman proposes a toast ""to love.""

However, for the first of it's genre, it is still a great film.  We are treated to some major and minor stars all thrust into a drama at sea, where the best special effect is Shelley Winters swimming underwater to save Gene Hackman who is stuck under 10 pounds of tin foil.  To be fair, the scene of the ship turning over in the ballroom is thrilling, even though the editing of the angles of the actors falling doesn't quite jive.  A large earthquake caused swell is possible, but breaking exactly at the point the ship is turning one minute after New Years Eve?  Okay...Hollywood.  ""Poseidon"" is a well-balanced script, slowly knocking off one actor after another and the upside-down kitchens, toilets and hallways make for funhouse thrills.  When the horrors and the drama almost become tedious, the writers throw in good laughable lines that save the story.  Just to see Stella Stevens say, ""I'm going next, in case fat-ass gets stuck"" (Shelley Winters) is worth the DVD.  Color quality is excellent and everyone looks so young, except Ernest Borgnine, who remains, uh, ageless.  Oh yes.  The better actors all get killed.",976924800,7,1482,4.829365079365079
280352,3,6300247031,"20th Century Fox missed the boat on this one.  This movie holds up remarkably well considering most of the dialogue seems a bit dated now.  Shelley Winters gives a good solid performance of the  grandmother on the way to see her grandson in Israel.  Hackman is a rebel priest, and Stella Stevens is the hooker made good by marrying cop Ernest Borgnine.  Everyone is having a good time until disaster strikes.  The special effects of the capsizing of the Poseidon were unsurpassed until Star Wars came along - and even then Lucas wasn't turning over a boat load of passengers.  The grand piano crashing through mid air still gives me stomach pains.  Yes, they don't compare to James Cameron's Titanic, but remember - they didn't have digital/computer technology back then.  I still don't know how they did it.  Which leads me to my next point.
The real disaster is the treatment Fox gave the DVD.  I didn't wait all these years for DVD technology to hear Dolby mono.  The movie was originally released in stereo.  Hearing all those screaming people from my center speaker doesn't cut it.  Hearing John William's fine score, and the Academy Award winning ""The Morning After"" in mono is a real disappointment.  I know there was a 'making of' documentary produced around the time the film was made.  Why isn't it on the DVD?  Why didn't we get a commentary track from some of the special effects wizards, cast, or director.  They can't all be dead.  Again, we waited for years for this to be released in a digital format, but my recommendation is to stick with the VHS version.  At least that is in stereo.",972691200,98,1602,4.6535714285714285
280353,4,6300247031,"This movie is great because it turns everything upside down. This really impressed me when I was a kid. They have to go down to go up, just like so many professions in life. This movie has a strong message of self reliance - don't wait around to be rescued, find your own way out. Under pressure society soon dissolves, reducing us to the level of rats in a maze. This movie is about human hubris. It would have been even better if everybody had died and, while we watched, somebody locked the theater doors and flooded the theater. Then we'd see who deserved to survive and who didn't. Let me tell you, it wouldn't be the people we voted for. This is going to happen to the World one day, but unfortunately it's going to be the people we vote for who'll survive.",971481600,,763,4.305555555555555

280355,2,6300247031,"This was among the first of the `All-Star' disaster movies of the 70's, and which were so well-spoofed in `Airplane!'. The plot involves a tidal wave that manages to flip over a large cruise ship, and the all-star cast (at least in 1972), which includes Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Pamela Sue Martin, Stella Stevens, and Red Buttons. With the exception of Hackman (is this how you follow The French Connection ?), the rest of the cast was better suited to the Love Boat, and not this boat. The dialogue is inanely silly, and Hackman, playing a cussing, derriere-grabbing reverend, just screams through most of this. It may have some larger cultural significance, but The Poseidon Adventure simply sinks.",970185600,4,706,4.991525423728813
280356,5,6300247031,"Excellent movie but for reasons other than the acting and the adventure.  The movie is an allegory following the life of Jesus Christ from his birth  to his death.  It is a modern Passion play in the truest sense of the word  and its wide appeal is due to the chord that the story of Christ touches in  all of mankind.  The movie begins with a rebel priest preaching to a small  group of passengers on a cruise ship, which is destined for catastrophe of  apocalyptic proportions.  The rebel priest is Jesus Christ.  Jesus was also  a rebel who was sent to change the status quo and bring the word of God to  the people so that they can be saved.  The tidal wave which was the hand of  God, the father, in motion came upon the cruise ship and overturning it on  Christmas night.  The world is now upside down and there is debate as to  the best course to be saved.  The rebel priest says that all must follow  him and have faith in him to be saved.  Not all heed the call.  Those few  that do are the chosen ones and they begin by climbing the Christmas tree  to follow their leader to the bottom of the ship.  Those that remain  perish.  Those that go with the priest are an old man and his wife (Joseph  and Mary), a former policeman and his wife who was once a prostitute (Peter  the rock and Mary Magdalene) and two children.  On their journey they  encounter various trials in which their faith in the rebel priest is  tested.  They encounter a group of people going in the opposite direction  led by a false prophet to their eventual doom.  When the small group  finally reaches the bottom of the ship and they are almost to their  destination their way is blocked by flames.  At this point the rebel priest  throws himself at a large valve to close it off, and in a scene reminiscent  of the crucifixion, the priest hangs on to the valve until the last minute  and he falls to his death in the water and fire below. The path is now open  and His followers enter the final door and at that moment they are rescued  as men like angels descend from a helicopter to cut them out of the ship  and save them.  The movie is replete with analogies drawn from the Bible I  leave it to the astute viewer to uncover them for himself.",966211200,4,2228,4.22488038277512
280357,5,6300247031,"This movie paved the way for every disaster blockbuster we have been running to see each and every summer since it appeared in 1972.  A vastly entertaining soap opera, set on a doomed luxury liner, this movie never  fails to provide thrills, stunning (esp. for its day) visual effects, and  performances that range from pure camp (Stella Stevens) to truly moving  (Shelley Winters, who was nominated for an Oscar).  The tidal wave turnover  is still terrifying, and the various sub-plots and near-romances between  ill-matched survivors never fail to be engaging; it's like a first-class  version of Love Boat, upside down, of course.

These questions merely hint at the giddy delights that await all viewers of this  vintage 1970s overblown, overacted, overwritten masterpiece. The characters  are little more than stock players straight out of central casting (the  gruff cynic, the reformed prostitute, the lonely batchelor, the plucky kid,  the aging couple), but, improbably enough, these people command our  attention and generate interest in their plight. We're not talking high art  here, but on the level of pure cheesy melodrama, few films have perfected  the craft as well. And, as stated, Gene Hackman outdoes even his Popeye  Doyle character as a skeptical, unconventional priest who roars and fumes  his way through the capsized ship.",952473600,2,839,5.2481203007518795

It's a story about a luxury ship called Poseidon on it's last voyage from New York to Athens. Unfortunately  a sub-seaquake develops a freak tidal wave and hits the Poseidon on New  Year's Eve. The ten survivors must find their way out through the capsized  ship with an erray of excitement and special effects to follow. This is  still a good movie with powerful acting from all of the main actors. Superb  directing from Ronald Neame and pretty special and visual effects from L.B  Abbott. Remember this was made in the early seventies so do not expect  terrific sound on this DVD version because you will not get it. I found the  film's sound mix to be very poor and dissapointing with the Dolby Digital  mono 2.1 mix. It's presented in it's original Panavision scope aspect ratio  of 2.35:1 and it does look sharper and more define.

The real stand-out in Shelley Winters(nominated Best Suppporting Actress)as  a loving grandmother who is forced to test her strength and her courage to  escape the watery tomb.

In my opinion, and according to most ship  captians, you ussualy try to hit a wave head on. You do this  because if a ship is hitting a wave broadside,the frequency of the wave  will match the frequency of the ships rocking motion, causing the ship to  capsize, and, enevitably, sink. That is why the plot has no point. The  moral, reaserch your topic before going with a plot. Or, make your tsunami  faster.",931564800,,518,4.4
280447,5,6300247031,"Anyone who has seen as many disaster movies as I have knows that this is arguably the best one ever made.  For a film nearly 30 years old, Poseidon Adventure is still so effective and real that it would make anyone planning  to take a cruise think twice.  You probably know the plot: luxury liner  capsized by a tidal wave.  This synopsis is brought to life with suspense,  drama, and terrifying reality.  One of the most effective cinematic touches  is the fact that in nearly every scene the camera is slowly swaying back  and forth to give us a sense that we really are at sea.  We follow the  journey of ten survivors through the inverted ship to their hopeful rescue  - narrowly escaping fires, explosions and flooding corridors every step of  the way.  The sets are epic and nothing less than spectacular.  Especially  the inverted dining room when the Atlantic comes crashing in and the  twisted metal inferno that is now the engine room.  Poseidon also gives us  some genuine emotional moments.  Most notably a scene involving Gene  Hackman and Shelly Winter's characters in the engine room.  The cast is  good, but Gene Hackman, Shelly Winters and Stella Stevens are best.  Hackman is our handsome hero, Winters is our unselfish caring mother, and  Stevens is radiant and adds a welcome touch of humor to the mess.  No, the  movie is not perfect.  However the suspense and dazzling effects will keep  you glued to your seat and you certainly won't be bored.  Poseidon  Adventure is a true classic.

The Poseidon Adventure is one that I very well remember as a child -- the luxury liner that turned upside down after it got struck by a huge tidal  wave.  It was scary for me to see at my early age. I even have nightmares  about  it (drowning).  Having watched it again after so many years, I came  to realize that it was a wonderful movie in its magnitude in those years.  I think this to be better than Earthquake, Towering Inferno and Airport 77.  Special effects are just so real and nerve racking that the viewer can just  feel the tension and fear that's going on.
