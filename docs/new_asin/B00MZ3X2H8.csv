6604802,5,B00MZ3X2H8,"Loved this series! Can anyone verify that it's dubbed? It says English but I don't see a cast listed and it seems cheap, even for a shorter anime. I watched it subbed and it was beautifully drawn, both cute and emotional, a fun take on the brother/sister love (not biological in this one, new stepbrothers).",1420070400,8,307,4.6

6604809,1,B00MZ3X2H8,"Spoilers ahead!!!
So I watched this whole thing and while every episode was fifteen minutes it still was a waste of my time. The fact that this got a sequel when so many other more deserving anime series haven't is disgusting. Some reviews are saying these are badass vampires not to be confused with sparkly ones. What makes them badass? That they don't rip the girl to shreds but abuse her time after time with the cheesiest wannabe sexy dominating dialogue. There is not one likeable character even the girl got annoying because she didn't take her chance at escape and kept approaching vampires with annoying questions that ended with her getting bit. This wasn't erotic at all because it wasn't consensual and not pleasurable for the girl it was more like watching someone get molested. The only reason I saw it to the end is that I wanted to know how they became sociopaths and what happened to their mothers. So the mom made them study some heartless women! I guess throwing one kid in the water to teach him to swim was the worst thing she did to deserve her gruesome end. Nothing much came about learning of the other mothers histories and I was hoping that once the awakening happened all of them would meet a fiery end but just like the entire series nothing much happened.",1491782400,,1284,4.586956521739131

6604829,2,B00MZ3X2H8,"I have been away from the anime scene for a while, wantonly losing myself in such gems as Black Sails, Vikings, and Black List. This probably was not the best choice for my return visit into the vast and imaginative world of anime. I knew what I was getting into before hand so I guess I can't really be too angry, I was just hoping that maybe it wouldn't be as bad as some have said it is.

  The animation was stunning and beautiful. The colors used served well to create a creepy and mysterious atmosphere. Each character was painstakingly drawn to have his own attitude and quite honestly was probably the only real personality these poor characters had. Suffice it say that my problem does not lie with the animation itself but with the extremely poor writing.

  The characters are extremely boring and  nauseatingly unbelievable. It felt like I was watching some weird twisted mixture of 50 Shades of Grey and Twilight. The entire anime is just a long drawn out fang rape fantasy shoddily held together by an extremely poor story-line. It constantly hints as you go that there is something more to it than what you are being given only to let you down time and time again all the way to the easily predicted ending. I would not even recommend this anime to people who just want to watch anything that might sate their fang fetish.",1454889600,3,1337,4.545833333333333

6604836,4,B00MZ3X2H8,"I just started to watch this anime a month ago, and I fell in love with it! I love supernatural anime/manga series, ESPECIALLY if there's vampires in it, and this is very different from the classical romantic genres for Vampires that are in Bram Stoker's Dracula, Vampire Knight, etc. (And goodness forbid, this one HORRIBLE saga that I'm not going to name)

Diabolik Lovers brings out the sadistic side of vampires you'd expect in Kouta Hirano's Hellsing and 30 Days of Night, but it still has a romantic side to it if you pay attention! I noticed that each of the Sakamakis have one of the seven deadly sins in their personality (if you notice, Ayato's prideful, Kanato has an insatiable sweet tooth, Shu spends most of his time sleeping, Reiji's envy towards his older brother for you-know-why, Subaru having the occasional bouts of fury, and Laito... O.O) which I thought was very interesting!!

For any fellow fan of the supernatural genre, I recommend this! XD

The animation is astounding and the music brings up the darker moments of Diabolik Lovers as well as the few, sweeter moments!

And the voices in the Japanese & English dub are fantastic, too! However, I'm not exactly fond of the person who plays the English dubbed voice for the main character, Yui Komori, a highschool girl with a strong faith in her Catholic religion... and Kanato could have sounded more child-like like in the Japanese dub...

Should it have had more episodes? ...Yes, but all-in-all, it's a pretty swell anime that was entirely based on its otome role-playing game counterpart of the same name! :)",1447027200,,1588,4.823529411764706

6604841,5,B00MZ3X2H8,"I haven't bought this anime, but I've seen it and loved it. Prior to what someone else commented on this anime it's not to be a romantic story like Twilight or what's in Vampire Knight. This is showing vampires as what they are truly meant to be. The boys living with the main female lead are seductive, mysterious, playful, coy, flirtatious, and downright sadistic. They said in episode 1 that she's their 'bride' or rather their 'sacrifice' in other words downright saying from the start what her purpose as a human living among them is. What can they say? They've never got no love.",1445299200,3,585,4.634615384615385

6604855,4,B00MZ3X2H8,"Not to sound like everyone else on here, but I was expecting more romance. One thing I always hated about animes like this one is that the female protagonists are always pin cushions. That aspect was a bit irritating. And as for the romance part, I thought with her living with six gorgeous guys, there would be a little more romance. There is some, if it could be called that, but I wouldn't bother with this one if you're just looking for romance. It's a good thing they're making a season two, otherwise I would be really angry with all the unanswered questions.

6604856,5,B00MZ3X2H8,I have watched this anime three different times.  I love this anime.  Like many other posts have said its very sadistic and the boys do not treat Yui as someone of equal value but as their food supply.  In a sense there is just a touch of romance at the end but not much.  Out of all the vampire animes I have watched this one is in the top two.  This is not for people who are weak at heart or are closed minded.,1435536000,3,413,3.869047619047619

6604861,4,B00MZ3X2H8,"I really love the art on this anime, and even though it was mostly the guys biting the girl im hopeing that the second season will make up for some missed fighting scenes that might happen, I would have to say this anime was alright, but I was hopeing the brother mostly Ayato would get mad and go psycho and honestly im a bit confused how the girl feels about the brothers lol. well on in all I cant fully rate an anime that I haven't completed SECOND SEASON COMING FALL (incase anyone is wondering)",1433116800,2,500,4.273684210526316
6604862,5,B00MZ3X2H8,"This definitely throws out the idea of a vampire romance (thank Otomate). I wouldn't have purchased it if it was romantic. For people who do not like the show for those reasons, you have to understand that she is their food. This is not a hentai, they are only biting her. So if this is too much for you, don't watch it. It is called DIABOLIK lovers. Japan's fans likes it and they have made it abundantly clear that a season 2 will be coming out very soon.

Now for the story-line. It is a bit backwards as you progress through the eyes of Yui. She is lured into the house for reasons unknown requested from her father. She then meets 6 young men; triplets, two full brothers, and a outcast brother. The characters are very memorable and this can't be said for a lot of anime. They are each crazily unique in their own way. You find that each of the brothers have a distorted view of the world and you can see that from their childhood memories and behavior. There is some foul language and grabbing which I personally don't like but the story becomes more clear as you reach the end. It still leaves a lot out for the fans and there is more in the video game, so this is the reason why they need to have a season 2. It wouldn't be complete without it.

I can understand that Diabolik Lovers isn't for everyone, but there are way more inappropriate manga and anime out there, I can name few. So watch it all first before you critique it. I personally loved it and adding it to my vampire collection: Trinity Blood, Vampire Knight, Betrayal Knows my Name, Hellsing, Owari no Seraph, Nightwalker,  and Gankutsuou.",1432339200,25,1612,4.384615384615385
6604863,5,B00MZ3X2H8,"Was packaged well (along with my Pocky), and arrived quite early than I expected! I originally watched Diabolik Lovers on Hulu before I decided to add it to my growing anime collection. Personally, I really like this anime. It was different, and the animation is superb. I don't think the English dub does this anime justice, but this review is coming from someone who loves watching anime in Japanese with English subtitles. I wish that the episodes were longer, and that an internal struggle was present throughout. Many reviews of Diabolik Lovers on various websites comment that Yui lacks self respect. It's clear that Yui accepts her ""position"" as the sacrificial bride, but I think adding an internal struggle would have made her a bit more likeable, (or perhaps relatable if anyone has been involved in a sadistic/controlling relationship). Quite a controversial anime, but I enjoyed it. I would recommend this anime to anyone. For those who have not seen this and are searching for something new to watch, I would at least check it out on Hulu or Crunchy Roll. Everyone has their own preferences. I'm an extremely open-minded person so that may be the reason why the story didn't bother me as much. Anyway, I hope this review helps!",1429833600,4,1240,4.881516587677726
6604864,3,B00MZ3X2H8,"Yes it is suave stylish great characters drop dead gorgeous guys, the imagery and artwork are beautiful and I love  the idea. A nice meek pretty young girl is sent to stay with a group of male vampires I thought this is so cool a human girl sent to live with a house full of  hot male vamps this is gonna be great. But here's the deal breaker for me she is treated like garbage abused verbally and physically I mean come on she's like a blood bank on legs their feeding on her hello at least show some friggin kindness

I kept watching thinking okay maybe things will get better attitudes will change once they warm up to her and they'll bond and be like a family nope didn't happen, I have only one regret that she could have somehow became more powerful than them and give them a taste of the hell they put her through. The end I must admit is intriguing. I really wanted to give this 5 stars but because of deep disappointment I just couldn't do it

Great Vampire Anime Series

Here are some really amazing vampire anime's [ 1 Hellsing. 2 Hellsing Ultimate. 3  Black Blood Brothers. 4 Rosario + Vampire, 5 Vampire Knight seasons 1 and 2.]  these are all top notch vampire anime series with excellent story lines, characters comedy and plenty of action. They grab and hold your attention keeping you wanting and coming back for more. being a die hard anime vampire fan I bought  1, 2  3 and 5 in list above from Amazon, haven't got 4 yet. I saw and love Blood Trinity and bought it here so I just had to add it to the list, Shiki is also very cool to",1429747200,3,1553,4.205387205387205

6604870,1,B00MZ3X2H8,"If you're into a gang rape fantasy, avoid at all cost.  Seeing it as it was airing on Crunchyroll on a dare, showed me exactly how bad the vampire genre has gotten.  Each of the vampires are rapists in an allegorical sense, and the main character is a block of wood for a personality.  As for the story itself, it doesn't begin until the half way point and even then, it has a convoluted story that I assume fans of the games understand more.  The animation is bare minimum with a dart game in episode 3 being the prime example of how poorly animated the series is.  The opening song is really the only praise I can truly give this show.  If you want a good vampire anime, Hellsing Ultimate and Black Blood Brothers are some of the best out there.  Avoid this horrendous title at all cost.",1427155200,12,789,4.29054054054054

6604873,4,B00MZ3X2H8,"I don't know anything about the video games this is based on, but the anime is very good. Well... the Japanese subtitled version is. The English dubbed version wasn't as good since they made bad casting choices on the voices and the dialog doesn't match the subtitles. Now the Japanese version with  the English Subtitles was excellently done. The cast vor the voices was excellent the voices perfectly match the personalities of the characters. Ultimately though, when it comes to the matter of if you should buy this or not, the answer is simple. If you liked the anime enough to want to watch ot more then once (and you can see it online for free before making the choice) then go ahead and buy it. I don't know about REGIONS, but you can play this DVD just fine on an American DVD or BlueRay player.
***ANIME SUMMARY*** There is alot of mystery revolving around things that are never explained. However, the meat of the story is that a girl was tricked into going to the home of some sadistic/cruel vampires to either be a potential bride or a sacrificial dinner. Either way her normal human life is over. In each of these too short episodes, the innocent human girl, Yui, gets to better know the brothers and slowly learns a little about the past that caused them to grow up to be such a dysfunctional family. While there is a lot of drama and dramatics there's no horror or messy ""M"" rated stuff in here, so its fine for teens to watch.",1425340800,8,1442,4.482889733840304
6604874,5,B00MZ3X2H8,"DiaLover BD was a pretty nice experience. The visual quality is pretty fantastic across its twelve episodes. Sound wise it was good too sounding much better than it did on crunchyroll streaming while airing over the season. I just wish the recap episode was included here.

Additionally there are no extras so its pretty barebones, but thats to be expected for most anime coming from Sentai and well any of the other companies in the US. For the cost, it feels like a steal for 20$ or so for 180minutes of content.

I loved their english dub writing for it too. Additionally their choice of YOURS TRULY for the disc art was splendid. Ayato is the best.",1425254400,2,652,4.564102564102564

6604880,5,B00MZ3X2H8,"Wow this is very different from any other anime I have seen, its pretty crazy but good. Now remember this is not a normal anime, it is a Sentai so it is for a particular audience. If you don't know what a Sentai is or if your looking for a fun series to get into, than this is not what you are looking for.",1423180800,8,306,3.796875
6604881,4,B00MZ3X2H8,"Diabolik Lovers is not for the faint of heart. The story is full of sadistic 'boys' (vampires), who use the main female as a blood supply. I mean, the opening song is titled 'Mr. Sadistic Night'. There is an interesting mystery going on however, in trying to find out why the main female's 'Father' sent her to the mansion to live with these 'boys'. The art style is very pretty, and the music works well with the tone of the anime.

I won't spoil the ending, BUT. For those who wonder at the weird pacing or dynamic between the characters, it's probably because this was a video game first. (Released only in Japan as far as I'm aware.) In it there are multiple 'routes' to take, and each delves deeper into each of the guys, and why they are the way they are. So, ymmv, as with all visual novel game-turned-anime. (I'm looking at you, Togainu no Chi.) Due to this, the story will probably make more sense to those who have played the game, or read about the plot online.",1423180800,18,972,4.370165745856354
6604882,3,B00MZ3X2H8,"Personally I bought this anime thinking it was going to be a romantic, vampire love circle surrounding the one girl, but it wasn't at all what I expected. There's a mysterious/interesting twist on the main girls entire life leading up to the day she was sent to live with the vampires which makes this show somewhat interesting. I wouldn't say this anime is romantic because the boys treated her so disrespectful, calling her mean names and practically using her as a living blood supply, ( I suppose if you're the type of person who enjoys Toughlove maybe you'll find this romantic.) However the animation was drawn beautifully and the voice actors weren't bad so I did decide to give this show three stars. This is just my personal opinion on Diabolik Lovers and many people might think I'm wrong and the anime was the best but I however just want people to understand my view on the anime. Another thing is I wish they would have added a sweeter romance and developed the story line better because I found myself getting bored after sitting through an episode where nothing exciting happened, except for her getting her's blood sucked by a different male vampire. Hope this help, super sorry if I offended any die hard Diabolik Lover fans! I just wanted to give another perspective on the show :3 and BTW the shipping was great, it also came early! SO YAY for that haha",1422921600,47,1372,4.650205761316872

8675408,5,B00MZ3X2H8,"Ive been in the DL fandom for quite some time. I originally bought this in 2015 and I plan on buying the second season to add to my collection. Personally, I find the games to be much better than the 12 minute long episodes of Diabolik Lovers. For those who are unfamiliar with the series, if you love vampires and live for stories similar to Game of Thrones, I highly recommend this series and fandom. The game its self is very much like GoT (CW/TW: Rape, blood, murder, abuse, self-harm, decapitation, incest, etc) and while the anime seems like its for 13 year old girls who love vampires, the games are most definitely not and would not recommend anybody underage playing the game.

So far the characters are very well shown and written as well as the story of the series. Though my only complaint about the series in general is that the episodes aren't long enough and the games need to be translated and put on PS4. Other than that there is not much to put here aside getting to know the series yourself and seeing how much youll love it or like it. Highly recommend reading the game translations before watching the series!",1517702400,2,1130,4.512195121951219
8675409,2,B00MZ3X2H8,I thought it would be more of a romance. I was disappointed and disturbed by some of the characters. The vampires were very derogatory towards the girl which was a major turn off.,1515456000,,179,4.454545454545454
