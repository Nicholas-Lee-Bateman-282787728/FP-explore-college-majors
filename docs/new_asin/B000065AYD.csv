1707028,5,B000065AYD,"My 11-yr-old & I were dying--our poor cat kept coming up to see if we had a problem. I note one reviewer was disturbed over the dog thing, but obviously didn't worry about Excel or Hyatt dropping dead regularly & the dog actually makes it through all 5 eps on this dvd & even sings the closing song (although seasoned a few times) My daughter was upset I kept stopping the closing to read all the comments (The English voice actress's wardrobe is credited to different sources each ep such as Straight Jackets ""R"" Us. There's a running joke about Andrew Kent in every closing credit. Ep 2 lists Translator Housing as Arcam Asylum. We even get a knock-knock joke.)
I usually watch in English with the subtitles beneath(except Dragonball Z-MUST hear the Japanese Vegeta voice), but sincerely had a hard time keeping up with the English jokes at the same time as the Japanese. I cannot believe how fast the actress speaks the next ep previews so reading the alternate version at the same time is hopelessly incomprehensible--separate is a must. Very much the Airplane/Naked Gun throw-everything-at-the-audience-&-something-will-stick genre. I didn't notice the bathhouse in every opening until watching the clean version--there is really too much to catch the first time. The vocal cast is ADV's group we've heard on Sorcerer Hunters & the Japanese cast includes Kotono Mitsuishi-Sailor Moon as our heroine Excel, Yuko Mizutani-Sorcerer Hunters/Chocolate as the Great Will of the Macrocosm, & Ryuzaburo Ohtomo-DBZ/Dabura & Bastard/Abigail as the Demon Sergeant in Ep 4 & Kabapu in Ep 5.
If you love tongue-in-cheek, this is a MUST. Politically Correct types will be deeply offended.",1023580800,4,1679,5.086956521739131
1707029,5,B000065AYD,"I haven't bought this, though I plan to, but I have seen the first 3 episodes subbed and I'm currently getting more. I've seen a lot of anime ((my favorite being Ranma 1/2)) but I haven't found any that is funnier than this one. These things make you addicted to the Excel Saga:
The death of Rikudo Koshi
I'z-chan
The reoccuring death of the members ((Hyatts are the best because they happen a lot one right after the other))
Iluparatzo doing out-of-character things.
Excel wanting to eat Menchi
Parodies of almost everything, including a weather channel.
I've said enough, I do believe.
Overall, I can't wait to get this DVD and the ones to follow.

1707030,2,B000065AYD,"I saw the first two episodes of this series and I truly did not like it.  The comedy was much to dark for my tastes.  I have no problems with a show with no plot, however, this series just rubbed me the wrong way from the start.  There is also the whole eating the dog thing which I can not stand even if it is for comedy value.  Sorry but I don't find the eating of animals funny, even if it is not really shown.  Parents: don't let your children see this it will disturb them greatly.  To parents and others: If you want a series that is funny and not as sick as this go get Dragon Half, Oh My Goddess Mini, or Slayers.  Don't bother with this.",1021334400,4,646,3.9612403100775193
1707031,5,B000065AYD,"Excel Saga is one of those DVD's you watch over and over again, because you're never gonna take it all in in one sitting. The main story is how Excel and team try to take over the city, and that alone will keep you occupied with trying to keep up with Excel, (in both her words and her actions, she's exhausting) but throw in a host of wacky support characters and plots which include :
.The cute alien princess with a tendancy to drop dead at a moments notice.
.The evil overlord who loves dating games and tries to play the guitar(badly).
.The imigrant worker who is too unfortunate for words, who has the gods on his side.
.The original manga author, who changes the theme of the show every episode and survives assassination from both his creations and his staff.
.The anime's director with the magical afro.
.Emergency ration pet Menchi.
.The mysterious S.A.A. led by the man with the rotating mustache.
.The Puchuu menace, cuteness from beyond the stars.
Does it make sense ? Not immediately.
Is it fun ? Of course!
This is up there with the Airplane and Naked Gun films for spotting little jokes here and there which you missed the first time round, and with so many different things being parodied all at once, you're bound to connect with the show on some level, so don't think it's just for the anime elite. For every joke against Trigun and Love Hina, there's a joke for something like Titanic and Star Wars. It's for anyone who enjoys a good laugh and a flair for the ridiculous.
and if you don't come away with viewing this without quoting at least half a dozen lines, then I'll eat my dog ! ^_^",1020643200,24,1608,4.454237288135594
1707032,5,B000065AYD,"I first saw this show at school...odd as that may sound its true.  IT IS THE MOST HILARIOUS SHOW I'VE EVER SEEN!  I haven't seen a lot of the animes they parody but its still very funny.  I've seen all 26 episodes and except for the last one every show parodys a different kind of anime.  One of the last episodes parodys mad max (or one of its sequels).  This show isn't for kids though, which may be confusing with all the puchus running around.  Just remember, they aren't so cute all the time.  The 26th episode is especialy adult...but this one isn't going to have that show on it so i don't need to review it here!  Check it out it will definatly be worth your while.",1017878400,13,673,4.203125
1707033,5,B000065AYD,"Excel Saga is a hard anime to describe.  Perhaps the full title explains it all, ""Weird Anime: Excel Saga.""  The story centers around Excel and Hyatt (Hyatt arrives in the 2nd episode and actually factors into the story starting in the 3rd episode) and their exploits with the secret organization called ACROSS that they work for.  ACROSS' goal is to take over the world starting with F City.  Don't let that description fool you though, b/c Excel Saga is anything but normal.  Expect a lot of random, screw ball humor, a lot of poking fun at traditional anime and mainstream movies/video games (Aliens and Resident Evil), and the most hyper character (Excel) imaginable.  The voice actress talks so fast, it would be great to see a gag reel of her recording sessions.
Each episode deals with one of ACROSS' plans to take over the world, all of which end up failing in hilarious ways.  Every episode is full of zany humor, it may be hard for some people to take.  For example, in the first episode, Excel dies about 5 times, but is always brought back to life by the Grand Will of the Universe.  In the second episode, F City is under attack by little cute teddy bear-like creatures (called Puchus) who fly in what looks like a star destroyer.
I would not reccomend this for kids.  It has next to no violence (if any), but it does have a few sexual innuendos in the later episodes.  But the main reason I wouldn't recommend it for kids is b/c the series is so zany, it practically makes no sense.  I really don't think kids would understand it or find it that funny.
Expect the unexpected with Excel Saga and you'll probably find it to be extremely funny.  It helps if you like things like Monty Python, Police Squad, and the Airplane movies.",1017792000,23,1742,4.527156549520766
1707034,5,B000065AYD,"Wow! i don't think i can say enough about excel saga.
the way i describe it to my friends it is the ""spaceballs"" of anime.  excel saga centers around the misadventures of the young and energetic (to saythe least) heroine excel who not only works for the very familiar looking, evil overlord (VERY familiar looking, eh tenchi muyo fans?) ilpalazzo, but she is in love with him as well!  throw in a terminally ill space princess... a manga artist who gets killed by his own creation, an anime director who gives his animated alter-ego as much screen time as possible. a poor dog whos name literally translates to ""mince meat"", a man who only speaks in subtitles and a group of pokemon like martians who want to take over earth with their cuteness and you have the FUNNIEST show EVER.

Hell you're likely to see more in the first 7 minutes of this show than you would in a whole series. That's not all either. ADV has a assembled an top noche dub cast that actually managed to top the Japanese version.(something that was thought to be impossible by fans of the subbed version). The most noticable is ovbiously Excel's dub voice played by Jessiva Calvello. You may have heard her as Mink in Dragon Half. What's interesting is that the Japanese voiceo of Excel also played Mink. Anyway, the gags keep coming and the more otaku you are the funnier this show is. Highly Recomended.",1079395200,,740,4.488888888888889

It makes fun of everything that needs/deserves to be made fun of. It's nice to watch someone on tv in cartoon form that's more messed up than I am, but yet reminds me of myself. I would recommed this to anyone who loves silly anime. You need to brain to watch this, cause none of it makes sense. So it's a win win kind of anime",1075420800,2,452,4.089887640449438
1707037,5,B000065AYD,"Excel Saga is the wierdest, funniest, most f***ed up anime I've ever seen. In every eppisode it parodies something else whether it be Star Wars or Dating Games. No matter what it decides to make fun of the show will leave you laughing so loud the neighbors will complain. Or if you're conservative, writing complaint letters to a bunch of organizations. Either way it rocks.
But before you buy this you should know that this DVD has absolutely no plot line whatsoever. In later DVDs my sources say there begins to be a plot line but not in this one. If you're looking for something dramatic with twists that will keep you guessing I reccomend you keep searching because you will not find that in Excel Saga.
However, if you are looking for a pointless way to waste time by all means buy this DVD, you will not regret it. Funniest anime ever.",1075248000,,841,4.503267973856209

1707039,5,B000065AYD,"I just started a new series and after deliberation decided on Excel Saga, and I must say, I don't regret it
it is up there with FLCL in the ""most insane anime ever created"" category, and when the first episode involves Ilpalazzo insulting the Excel Saga magna thus sending the heroine killing the creator of the magna/anime, well...
for the uninitiated, Excel Saga is a gigantic spoof of Anime, American Movies, heck its a spoof of just about anything, each episode follows an ""expirament"" theme, where Lord Ilpalazzo gives the members of ACROSS(his organization) something to do, they normally try, and normally fail....pitifully....
and in between Ilpalazzo might play a dating sim game where he attempts to finish the game...and normally fails...and throws it on the ground....and then picks it up....and continues to play...
It's a very good anime, but unless you know Japanese Culture and Anime to a minimal extent you might not get some of the jokes..",1066780800,,957,5.0251572327044025
1707040,5,B000065AYD,"A few months ago, i rented this movie from a local Movie Gallery.  By the end of this DVD i was rolling around on the floor laughing!

It is absolutely hilarious and i can't wait until I'm able to buy this and the rest of the series for myself!
  Our main character, Excel Excel, is part of an organization called ACROSS (employed: 2), which is trying to pretty much destroy the city Ef (or F, I'm not certain how it's spelled ^.^;)  in the first episode, she catches a dog (or cat?) and names it minchi (or menchi?) and carries it with her as a possible food source.  Oh, and she is in love with her Lord Ilpalazo, runner of ACROSS.
  As the series continues, we meet the next door neighbors (three men near starving because they're broke) agent Hyatt, new ACROSS agent, who has a tendency to die.  The ever adorable Puchuus, who bear a more than passing resemblance to the famous Pikachu, and many other demented characters.
Overall, I'd say this is among the best of anime to get.",1064707200,,1134,4.382775119617225
1707041,5,B000065AYD,"While the DVD package does have warnings about how Excel Saga might be hazardous to your sanity that is just a little too much.  IT is funny, but forget the warnings, it's not that funny.  You will laugh, but I doubt you'll hurt anything.
The story begins with Excel skipping out of a school and getting hit by a truck.  Don't worry, she dies a lot and does get hit by a truck more than once. Excel is a member of ACROSS - a not-so-secret organization which wants to rule the world.  Its leader, Lord Ilpalazzo, does this by sending Excel, and other members (such as the Princess from Mars who shows up in episode two), onto missions for ACROSS.  That seems sane enough.  Now add references, hundreds of them, such as the White Comet Empire from Star Blazers, Excel stealing poses from Space Cobra, a Prisoner in the Iron Mask who looks VERY much like a female character from Captain Harlock(or a female character from Galaxy Express or a female character of any other anime series that Leiji Matsumoto has made), Yoda from Star Wars, Resident Evil (the games), dating games and what you have is a really weird, and yes, very funny, story.  Add aliens from Mars armed with a huge spaceship and futon beaters, Space Butler (I don't get it either), fake film footage, an afro hair-do, government agencies and the fact that both female characters seem to die a lot and you have the anime verison of the X-Files marries Benny Hill while also dating Monty Python.
Besides the five episodes there are also the extras: sketches, previews, trailers, opening and closing songs, and the AD Vid-notes, kind of a Pop-Up Bubble that appears and helps explain or point out stuff.  Most of the time it, like Excel's super-fast dialogue, is hard to catch and be ready to use the pause button a lot.  But remember that even the Pop-Up Bubbles are sometimes just there to add to the humor and many times, like when Excel fell down a pit, are snatched away before you can read them by objects she falls past.  In other words they interact with, and sometimes even BLOCK your view of, the action.
Excel sometimes talks so swiftly that maybe using subtitles, even when you already have it set on English language, might not be a bad idea.  But that is not a problem, that just happens to be her character - she is hyperactive most of the time when not hungry.
If you are looking for a plot then REREAD what I just wrote!
Either way this DVD, with 125 minutes, has TONS of stuff on it.  New or used, the first DVD is worth it.  I even like the dog's ending song!",1064016000,4,2540,4.460043196544277
1707042,5,B000065AYD,"Meet Excel, (first name, Excel, last name Excel, Excel for short) the indestructible, hyper agent of the secret organization, ACROSS, under the leadership of the handsome Lord Il Pallazo.  Il Pallazo is bent on world domination, but for the mean time is dedicated to taking over the city F.  Next, throw in a bunch of miscellaneous characters, Hyatt, a anemic martian princess; Menchi, an adorably cute dog, and Excel's emergency food supply; Pedro, the foreign worker with a sexy wife and an adorable son; Nabeshin, the afro-wearing action hero, ""The Will of the Universe"" a strange plot hole that intervenes whenever something goes wrong, along with dozens of other strange characters, and you get one of the strangest, most hilarious anime of all time. This anime isn't called an ""experimental anime"" for nothing.  Each episode pokes fun of a different genres, from action films to romantic comedies, and contains many references to both Japanese and American pop culture; Star Wars, Macross, Di Gi Charat, Lupin III, just to name a few.  While Excel Saga doesn't have much of an actual plot, with all the antics, and slap-stick parody, it will leave you laughing for hours on end.",1059782400,,1184,4.99492385786802
1707043,5,B000065AYD,"Right from the start this series sets itself into a league of it's own. The intro music is every bit as catchy as the show itself. Excel's uber-cute look in the first few minutes is so dang... well, cute! And the constant switching between normal and super deformed characters is a hilarious staple of insane comedy anime.
The jokes in this show are just plain outrageously funny. You name it, they've done it. The director of the anime and the author of the manga are featured in just about every episode doing the most ridiculous things you can think of. Every episode carries an ""experimental"" theme they try out, from sports to horror, which greatly helps to keep things fresh.
What really keeps this series going for 26 episodes isn't just the over the top insane humor, it's the wonderful characters and story that keeps you watching and wanting to know what happens next. I particularly love the ending episodes where things get serious and wrap up well. It's one of them series where once you finish it, it will seem like you've known it forever.

1707044,4,B000065AYD,"Watch this with the pop-up option enabled!  There's more metaphorical context, undertones, sattires and subtle referrences of other anime (and non-anime movies and TV shows) in here than what wasn't so blantantly obvious.  The humour is more bizarre and clever than most recent typical anime comedies.  Some of the gags try a little too hard to tickle the funnybone (which ultimately results a mere sigh or roll of the eyes) but admittedly most of it is ridiculously funny.  I guess it really depends on how humourous you find overexaggerated slapstick instances like a young girl getting run over by a truck, laying in a pool of her own blood and jumping straight back up in an eccentric manner smiling wide with blood still leaking from her nose.  It's violent, melodramatic, sexy and stupid.  Definitely not for everyone, there's clearly many mixed reactions.  Some people only giggle at lighthearted, family-oriented, sentimental Disney type dribble.  Others may perceive it as entirely try-hard.  You only have to take your initial response to it into consideration.  Nonetheless, it's fast-paced and fun even as a novelty.  5 episodes on one DVD is amazing value.

1707046,5,B000065AYD,"Since I nicknamed myself as agentexcel, it should be apparent that I am a fan of the series.  Here are a few points that were not covered by some of the other reviews.
(1) The English dub is very good.  Excel is voiced by Jessica Calvello whose maniac performance fits Excel's hyperactive nature very well.  (Incidentally, Kotono Mitsuishi (Sailor Moon)is the voice behind Excel in the Japanese track.)
(2) The series was created during the recent and ongoing recession in Japan.  Many of the characters have problems securing stable employment.  This is the reason why Excel keeps Menchi as her pet dog and emergency food supply.
(3) The characters (Excel, Hyatt, Ilpalazzo) were named after Hotels.
(4) There was some crackling in parts of the Japanese track.  You will notice them if you are a perfectionist.  To the best of my knowledge, this issue has not been addressed.",1048809600,,876,4.878378378378378

Some have said that the Excel's voice is too irritating, and I'll admit she's made me wince, but it also fits her character perfectly.  You'll just love the way she sings the praises of ACROSS (the secret organization of which she is a member) with all the enthusiasm of a stormtrooper.  Along with her anemic partner Hyatt, Excel blunders into mission after mission to further ACROSS's agenda of taking over the....wait for it....*CITY*!  Mwhahahahah, gotta start small after all, wouldn't want to get ahead of ourselves now would we?

Then I saw Excel Saga.
If someone took every anime in history, added a dash of every great parody movie worth mentioning, threw them all in a blender and set it on liquify, the end result wouldn't even begin to come close to this series. With an opening that kills off the main character, a top-secret organization with only two members, and a soft-spoken space girl who is so fragile that she can't quite seem to stay alive, this series shows no mercy on every single standard of Japanese Animation.
If I had to pick out one flaw about this series, it would have to be the fact that it's humor is exclusive to Anime fans only. Everyone else will wonder why the main character is talking at a speed that can hardly be deciphered and why waterfall-shaped tears are supposed to be funny.

It follows the efforts of Excel Excel a member (one of two) of the ideological organisation of ACROSS, who are bent on taking over the world. Do not let this serious sounding plot fool you, this is one of the most manic, insane and hilarious pieces of anime around. The set plot soon disitigrates into a pool of insanity that will have you laughing all the way.
This is very much a parody anime. In between it's own unique humour it mercilessly makes fun of all aspects of Japenese culture (manga, dating sims) and even american B-movies. It is full of Small, subtle comedy and Complimented by huge unsubtle jokes that will have you Incapacitated with fits of laughter. I found I had to rewind it a lot, as I missed huge sections of the plot because I couldn't stop laughing.
The DVD menu is fairly simple to navigate, with plenty of extras to have a look at, including the Japanese trailers, which are the most misleading things I've ever seen. It also has AD Vid-notes, which is useful if you find you don't understand a joke or part of an episode (which never really happens anyway). It contains the first five episodes in the series, in English and Japanese with subtitles, if you prefer to watch anime in this fashion.
This is very much a plotless comedy and may not be for everyone, so if your looking for something deep, this isn't it. If thats the case by X 1999, then come back and get this. Why are you still reading this? Buy it, buy it NOW!

Despite the incredible amount of Japanese cultural references, this is a highly enjoyable series. From Koshi Rikdo's disclaimers to Menchi trying to escape Hyatt and Excel you'll be doing all you can to keep from dying of lack of oxygen!

A show written in its own particular perspective dominated by parodies, reoccuring staff cameos and martian Pokemon with the face of Golgo 13. Welcome to Quack Experimental Anime Excel Saga.
This is a series made by anime fans for anime fans by making fun of other anime. There is not a single bit of japanese popular culture that this series sees fit to parody, spoof and lampoon. Many viewers will think this series is utter madness, jumping around from plot to plot more than Cowboy Bebop. The truth of the matter is that Bebop has a structure and they make fun of that too.
In this first installment we are introduced to the City of F in the Prefecture of F and the secret Ideological organization of ACROSS. The goal ACROSS' intrepid leader Illpalazzo (say that 5 times fast) is to conquer the city! However ACROSS' top(and only) agent,  Excel Excel has difficulty completing her missions for ACROSS.

First off, it's just plain funny. Ask anyone who likes the immature weirdness, they'll say it's hillarious. Second, it's original--an anime that makes fun of other anime. Third, great voices. Monica Rial was practically meant for Hyatt and born a Hyatt. And Jessica's loud voice is perfect for Excel, and Hillary Haag does a fabulous job being Menchi the dog. Fourth, the animation is funny as well. I love how they do the crying.
Downsides are, you have to watch more anime to understand some of the jokes. Most of the jokes. I was left staring at the screen with drool dripping from my mouth at unfunny jokes about some other anime. I'm sure it would've been funnier, so I advise you watch more anime before this...Unless you have over like, 5,000 dollars worth of anime, you're good to go. Second and last, Excel Excel is so annoying after a while. I understand she must have a loud voice, but it gets so annoying after a while.
I reccomend it to people who have watch lots of anime, or decent amount of anime like myself. There's still some jokes that have nothing to do with other anime, so it's still funny. And by the way, the front cover of the third one makes fun of Princess Nine... I'll get to that when I review the 3rd one when I see it :) Chao!",1041206400,,1489,4.340501792114695
1707053,5,B000065AYD,"I got Excel Saga 1-3 for Christmas, and I love it! While I didn't laugh as hard as I could have, I was laughing a lot. Whether it was Ilpalazzo blowing Excel away when she wouldn't shut up (twice in fact, once with a bazooka!) or Hyatt's constant dying and fainting (I'm not sure whether she actually died all those times or not). There are lots of jokes that an American viewer wouldn't understand (hence the vid-notes, which are very helpful) and some that anime fans might recognize. Keep an eye out for one of Excel's neighbors who only speaks in subtitles!
Now, for the English version. This is the only one I've seen so far (I just got the DVD for Christmas yesterday) but the dubbing is very good. Excel's voice sounds perfect for her character (She talks so fast that all the words blend together in my brain!) and Hyatt's voice couldn't be any more perfect for her!
It is a little unsettling, but the sheer insanity of the show keeps it from getting too disturbing. Even Hyatt's constant dying/fainting spells and how often she coughs up blood are not as disgusting as they sound.
In short, if you like anime that has no real plot and is full of insanity, check this out! You're not likely to regret it!",1040860800,2,1212,4.463963963963964

1707055,4,B000065AYD,"Agent Excel Excel has more lives than a cat does...and needs them.
In the course of 1 episode of this strange series, she ends up dead no less than 4 times, only to be ressurected by the Spirit of the Macrocosm who is in league with Ilpallazo - the head of the mysterious organization ACROSS.
Thier goal? World domination. But they aren't going to start off too greedy. First, they're going to start with one city. But even that seems to be near-impossible. You could blame it on overzealous Excel, on ACROSS, or her lovable dog/emergency food supply Menchi, or you could blame it on thier battle plan. Mission 1 requires Excel to kill a manga artist. However, this artist is none other than the creator of the Excel series. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see where this will lead.
But the best parts of this series are the side stories; poor Pedro must try to find his way back to his sexy wife and loving son after his death by a freak construction accident created by Excel.
Afro Guy is in every episode (even the one that's supposed to be all women), and gets involved with supporting characters that always end up being people from his past. They never make it to the end of the episode alive. Then there's the 3 roomates who live next door to Excel...
There's a LOT going on in every episode. Sometime's it gives you a headache trying to keep up. But it's worth it.
The discs come with cute extras as well; an ACROSS membership card, a Sumo game, recipies for Menchi.
Great for older teens and adults, but even my 9 year old neice seems to like it. And just wait 'till you hear the closing theme. Absurd yet sad. The girls won't stop singing it.",1038960000,2,1658,4.403908794788274

1707057,5,B000065AYD,"""Excel Saga"" is taken from the Japanese comic book (manga) of the same name.  The name of the game for ""Excel Saga"" is PARODY!  And this series spoofs tons, especialy other anime series and Japanese culture.
This DVD contains the first five (of 26) episodes of this anime series.  The first episode is so out there that I didn't laugh at all -- kind of like the first time I saw Monty Python.  However, once you get past the shock, the series becomes very funny, especially if you can identify all of the jokes!  This DVD helps you to understand (and catch) some of the jokes by turning on an option in one of the sub-menus.  With this on, the dog Menchi will pop-up (like that video show on VH1) with an explaination complete with a bubble sound.  Be warned though, sometimes these can go quickly as jokes will sometimes only flash on the screen briefly!
The English dubbing is pretty good.  Having seen the show in Japanese, I wondered if they'd be able to do this in English.  However, the English voice-actress (who's name escapes me at present) does Excel right!  Great care has been taken to get the English voices as similar to their Japanese counterparts as possible.  Kudos to ADV on this!  But, if you want to hear this in Japanese (with English sub-titles), you can do that too.
There are some other features on the DVD, but it's small fry.  Nevertheless, that's not why I purchased this DVD.  I loved ""Excel Saga"" when I saw it and wanted to see the English version.  The translations may be a bit off, but all in all, a very good job has been done.  Can't wait to buy the next DVD!",1037318400,6,1594,4.407534246575342
1707058,5,B000065AYD,"First, let me say this: I am not an anime fan.
But, my boyfriend is, so naturally I've had to watch a few anime movies, and I haven't been crazy about any of them. But one day I was in the video store and saw what looked like it might have been what I call a ""chick anime"" (in other words, an anime that may appeal to girls). Well, I'm not sure if that is a term that can be applied to Excel Saga, but it did appeal to this girl. I loved it! It's not a movie, but an anime series, and Volume 1 contains the series' first 5 episodes. I instantly fell in love with it, from the very first scene. It revolves around a teenage girl named Excel who has a habit of getting killed a lot (think: female version of South Park's Kenny). She decides to join an elite organization called ACROSS, and the members include...well...just her - and the organization's leader, Ilpalazzo, who wants to take over (brace yourselves) THE CITY!
Of course, every episode revolves around Excel trying to help Ilpalazzo with his evil plan, and even though that is entertaining enough, there are so many supporting characters you will just fall in love with: her future sidekick who seems to be anemic; a homesick immigrant worker named Pedro who misses his son and ... wife""; annoying neighbors; cute little aliens; and an ""emergency food supply"" - her pet dog that looks more like a cat.
The DVD itself is nothing to rave about, but you don't even need any great special features to enjoy it - each episode more than makes up for it. If you haven't seen Excel Saga yet, I think you should - even if you aren't an anime fan. In fact, if you aren't, Excel Saga will make you one - although I haven't seen an anime since that can compare. That is, of course, except for Excel Saga Volume 2.",1037232000,4,1762,4.3102409638554215

The more you know anime, the more you get out of its constant parodies and spoofs of other anime series.  The optional pop-up notes (like Pop-Up Video) are really helpful in understanding visual cues and references to Japanese culture!  The episode spoofing Japanese Dating Simulation videogames is an absolute howler!
My only complaint with the series is the main character of Excel talks so incredibly fast, loud and squeeky that it's impossible to understand everything she's saying (in the English dub). Not even the English subtitles can keep up with her!  I feel like I'm missing many jokes simply because I can't understand what she's screaming about half the time.  Other than that one flaw, the english dub is really terrific... much funnier than that subtitles (which usually tend to be more literal translations).  Even if you are a subtitle snob, please give the english dub a listen... it's hilarious!  (Especially when Excel lets loose with a few four letter words!)
The DVD itself is excellent. You get FIVE episodes on one disc - which is a bargain compared with the piddly three or four episodes you get with most anime titles.  The transfer is brilliantly crisp and vivid.  Another great job by ADV Films!",1034985600,3,1329,4.945945945945946

Each episode is 100% insane, and it's always making fun of something, resulting in pure fun!
It starts out with our heroine, Excel, happtliy leaving Inuabe (dog stew) high shool, skipping out into the street, and then promptly getting run over by a truck. It gets crazier from there, with her dying two more times within 5 minutes. Then by the orders of Lord Il Palazzo, leader of ACROSS (total members: 2), Excel must conquer the city of F. More insane characters include Hyatt: The Martian princess who can die 4 times in 30 seconds, Nabeshim: The afro-wearing super hero, Koshi Rikdo: The series' creator, The neighbors, Pedro, and the Mysterious Man Who Appears In Episode 5.

Sumiyoshi and Iwada are always following Watanabe around and making his life miserable. For those of you who like outtakes, too bad, there are none.

I couldn't understand her half the time! I had to turn on the sub-titles and watch it in Japanese, and I still had to pause it now and then to read the sub-titles!

Why is Excel's neighbor always followed by his two friends?  Poor Pedro....tormented by the happiness of his sexy wife and his son.
This DVD is definately for adult anime fans. The story starts out that Illapallazo is going to take over a city (not the world) and Excel is for some reason the agent he picks for the job fresh out of school after she was run over and had flash backs of her life and then floated into some cosmos which is somehow a woman, she gets put into Illapallazo's basement to start her work as an Across agent.

Episode 4: Lord Illpalzo becomes occupied with a dating game which gets in the way of the mission, but produces some funny results.

Episode 5: Excel and Hyatt must stop a corrupt company from cheating employees. And Excel makes a new enemy.
Parodies: Salaryman manga, Resident Evil, Excel Saga singers.

1707071,2,B000065AYD,"Excel Saga is perhaps the most over-hyped anime in US anime fandom.  While hype alone is not a problem, there simply isn't anything in Excel Saga beyond that.  All this show contains is a constant stream of parodies of anime series (from the very recent to quite old).  There is no story holding this together (or if there is, it doesn't emerge in this first disc).  The characters barely exist--only one of the minor characters, constantly trying to escape his roommates, has any hint of substance.  To the extent they do exist, the characters are unlikeable--particularly the spastic, amoral Excel.
The unthinking, murderous streak in Excel's actions (and this is not hyperbole) highlights a second problem: what humor there is, is mean-spirited.  There is no light humor here--the jokes pretty much all depend on significant pain (or death) being inflicted on someone.  Note that it's not offensive in any way; rather, it made me wonder why I should spend my time watching it.  Even if you get all the jokes (and unless you've watched a lot of anime, including things never released in the US, you won't), it's more tiring than funny.
Excel Saga demonstrates one thing: it's apparently easier to parody a genre than come up with something new or interesting.  If mean-spirited, uninspired parody floats your boat, pick this up.  If not, save your cash.",1026345600,4,1355,4.929515418502203

1707073,5,B000065AYD,"Fair warning beforehand: Either you will love this anime or you will hate it. There is no middle ground.
Excel Saga is a parody of the Japanese and Anime, and has no problems with going over the top. The title character, Excel, is a just-graduated high-schooler who is working for a top secret organization called A.C.R.O.S.S. which has a total of two members. However, Excel has three distinguising characteristics: the ability to speak a mile a second, will do anything to please Il Palazzo whom she loves, and is a basic ditz. Il Palazzo is the leader of A.C.R.O.S.S., whose goal is to conquer the city of ""F"", but is easily distracted. Hyatt (who is introduced in episode 2) is anemic and faints a lot. And then, there's Menchi, Excel's stray dog/emergency food supply who even sings the closing theme (with translation). Other characters include Pedro, next door neighbors (one of whom speaks only in subtitles), and Will of the Microcosmos.
Just how wierd is this anime? In the first episode, Excel dies about six times (including once in the first 30 seconds), but the series Deus Ex Machina, the Will Of The Microcosmos, sets things straight. Excel's mission is to kill the Koshi Rikdo, the manga artist who happens to draw the original Excel Manga. Other episodes include a space battle, B-movie, Japanese love-dating video game, and newspaper story.
BTW: The original Japanese voice of Excel is the same person who did the role of Usagi/Sailor Moon in the Sailor Moon series. (The role was tailor made for her.) Jessica Calvello did the English Excel, which put a real strain on her voice.
One bonus feature of the DVD is a ""pop-up"" notes which explain some of the in-jokes for us Americans.

I know it's more then 5 ~,^  And with a friend who's anemic and coughs up blood what more can you want?
Seriously tho', there's a lot more of humor then Excel getting killed off, and Hyatt collapsing to the groudn with blood trickling out of her mouth, and Excel trying to eat poor Menchi, a mutt that has had the misfortune of crossing her path.  In the first episode they seem to parody the type of anime character who inspires people, which causes Pedro to work more vigoursly (Damn I just feel so sorry for that poor Pedro guy :-( )  2nd episode makes fun of science fiction, third episode makes fun of action flicks (grade be of course with some hilarious engrish[yes engrish]), the fourth romance comedies, and dating sims, and the last episode making fun of afternoon japanese dramas.
One of the greatest things about this DVD tho', is that ADV has added in video notes.  And it's very helpful to get soem of the jokes.  Every now and again, when something culturally funny happens that normal Americans wouldn't get, a little Menchi head pops up explaining it.

The Animated Version was Adapted and Directed by the rising star Director Shinichi Watanabe (Director of the famous ""Cowboy Bebop"" series). The Showed aired at 1:30 AM on TV Tokyo, Perfect time for all the Otakus to tune in.
  The show mainly makes fun of other Manga and Anime from the 1960s all the way to Today, but mostly stuff from the 1990s, so us  American Otaku can understand it for the most part. The show also makes fun of both Japanese and American Popular Culture (mostly Japanese), Ranging from Japanese Pop Music, Gameshows, Video Games, and movies (it pokes fun at Star wars a whole lot). Fortuantely, for us Americans who might not understand certain jokes, ADV films (American Distributers) Have added in a ""Vid-note"" System which works like VH1's Pop-up Video. When turn on, it will pop-up balloons which help explain some of these jokes.
  Like any good Parody, Excel Saga collects well known cliche`s and proceeds to exagerate them to a point of absurdity and thus makes fun of them. Some times it takes these cliches and puts them in the wrong places on purpose. Other time they'll put the wrong characters and put them into famous Scenes, or put the scenes into the wrong settings. The Characters themeselves are exagerated cliche's. Excel herself is the cliched energetic anime girl to the extreme. Hyatt is the cliched ultra-femenine and frail anime girl, so frail in fact that she is frequently stricken with life threatening diseases. The show will also throw in the ocaisional dirty joke.

1707083,5,B000065AYD,"This was referred to me by someone I was trading anime files with.  I watched the first episode, and despite some of my confusion.  I couldn't stop laughing!
The plucky, but slow-witted heroine alone was causing tears to well up in my eyes.  Add that up with the supporting cast, of which not one can be called normal or stable, and you've suddenly got the biggest mix of anime stereotypes gone horribly wrong you can have.
Now, I know Mr. Rice at the top of the list called the humor dark, and recommended series like Slayers, but this tops my funny list.  Slayers itself has dark comedy bad for families in the form of breast jokes, sexual inuendo, and the actual eating of a sentient lifeform (Noonsa, the fishman).
Excel Saga is no better or worse by comparisson, but the Excel Saga definately doesn't take itself seriously, mocking every form of anime and pop culture movie style it could possibly find.
This is one to watch over and over.  Share it, show it, live it.",1023580800,,973,4.537142857142857

7960797,5,B000065AYD,I don't know why i decided to get this i guess i just came across it. But I'm glad i did its a little weird at first but then this anime gets kind of interesting to watch overall it was a good buy i bought the other 5 volumes too and there good as well i shared them with my friends i made backups of the dvds using dvdfab one of the best dvd backup software out there. Oh also some people said you won't understand most of the stuff in this anime unless your an otaku i guess that's true but that doesn't mean you cant still enjoy the show i wouldn't know though because i am a otaku so i get all the jokes in the show.,1300406400,,620,3.813953488372093
7960798,3,B000065AYD,"(If you don't know what ""otaku"" means, this DVD is not for you.)

I get that most anime is weird by western standards, and Excel Saga is supposed to be weird even by anime standards. To some extent this worked for me; it was funny in a lot of places. (My favorite: ""Oh, no, her life is beginning to flash before her eyes! This isn't good!"" Or words to that effect; the first disk went back to Netflix weeks ago, and I never bothered with any more in the series.)

But most of the silliness wasn't all that funny, at least not to me. There's almost no plot, almost no characterization; or what there is of each is glacially slow. Maybe if I watched more of the series, I'd better enjoy the first disk. But even with the (highly recommended) ""pop-up video"" extras, there just wasn't enough humor to make this worth my while.

Really serious anime fans may love this. For the rest of us, not so much.",1155945600,,897,4.295857988165681
7960799,3,B000065AYD,"If Monty Python ever did anime, it would be something very similar to Excel Saga, which is to say that it would be hilariously insane and absurd.  Excel Saga is certainly that, and I did laugh out loud several times in this first volume, especially in the episode parodying romantic comedies (three words: Stick It In).  I also LOVE the opening song and can't get it out of my head!  My problem with the show, and why I only give it three stars: it is WAY too self-referential at times.  To parody something else is one thing.  To parody yourself, many times, in the first episode, smacks of smug conceit.  Maybe it's a Japanese thing, maybe they assume the viewers will have read the manga and get it, maybe it IS just conceit, but it certainly isn't very funny, at least not to me.  They try too hard to be too clever and laugh too much at themselves as if they were saying, ""Look at us!  Aren't we just so funny and witty?""  By the end of the volume they had toned that down a bit, and I enjoyed the second half of the volume better than the first half.  I haven't seen the rest of the series, but I liked the first volume enough that, in a fit of spontaneity, I might well buy the whole series.  Now I have to go home to my son and my sexy wife...NOOOO!!!!",1106611200,,1260,4.186721991701245
7960800,5,B000065AYD,"Excel saga is a great anime if your a die-hard fan or Otaku as i like to call it.  It makes many referances to other animes that are popular that mainly otaku will get.  I believe this anime is excellent for anyone to watch but id first watch some other anime if your a n00b to get half the jokes.

This series made me crack up from beginning to end and i Highly recommend it as an addition to any otakus dvd collection.",1103673600,,420,4.036144578313253
7960801,5,B000065AYD,"Wow. My dad got this DVD in hopes of watching it. He did not last. I, however, was enthralled at the overall insanity that was going on during this hilarious parody anime. It is hilarious in the truest sense of the word. Excel is one of my inspirations to annoy friends over the internet, and she never fails to make me laugh. This is possibly the greatest anime that I have seen.",1090454400,,380,4.291666666666667
7960802,4,B000065AYD,"I'm not an Anime old-timer, I've only seen a handful of things. I encountered a budget copy of the first Excel Saga, and found the gags pretty darn entertaining.  These disks would be REALLY great if Excel's voice track was toned down just a little.  It can get pretty tiresome to have to concentrate so hard on the screeching rapid-fire dialog to make sure I can make out what she's saying.  The dialog is generally pretty hilarious, but just a little too over-the-top to the point that it borders on the fingernails-on-the-blackboard effect.  Looks like the production company has the problem in general as well, as I also picked up Puni Puni Poemy by them and it has pretty much the same problem.  The main character's dialog track borders on torture, and is pretty much a constant feature...",1085356800,,795,4.731884057971015
