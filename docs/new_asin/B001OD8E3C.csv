8330482,5,B001OD8E3C,"The term poetic is thrown about a great deal by writers describing the films of various directors  sometimes its appropriateother times not so much. In the case of Its winter, its perfectly apt. In terms of the written and spoken word, poetry opens up the power of language  its rhythms enter the heart and soul of the reader / listener, opening doors that are harder for prose to access. Its almost a shamanic process  which is no doubt why practitioners of such ancient arts utilized verse for their stories, songs and spells. The gates of the mind swing wide for poetry  frontiers are more easily crossed or erased completely. In terms of cinema, I suppose its the rhythmic and metaphoric aspects of poetry that apply  without beating the viewer over the head by a simple visual recitation of a story or plot, the poetic filmmaker utilizes more subtle methods. Images are more languid  time is uncompressed (at least in comparison to most films made today)  everything about a character or storyline isn't laid out as if on a dining table for the viewer to consume like fast foodabsorption and consideration are required.

Rafi Pitts has based Its winter on Safar, a story by famed Iranian writer Mahmoud Dowlatabadi which, according to Pitts, is well-known to most Iranians [Dowlatabadi also wrote the story on which the 1969 film GAAV (The cow) was based]. The characters are working class men and women  their lives are unglamorous struggles to survive in a harsh world. As the film opens, Mokhtar (Ashem Abdi), husband to Khatoun (Mitra Hadjar) and father to a little girl (Zahra Jafari) announces to them that he has lost his job and sees no other alternative in supporting them than to travel abroad to find work. He leaves his family, including his mother-in-law (Safari Ghassemi) to survive on the meager wages earned by Khatoun, who works in near sweat-shop conditions as a seamstress. Their existence is a bleak one, but they have no choice but to struggle to survive.

Arriving in town around this same time is Marhab (Ali Nicksaulat), a drifter in search of work  he presents himself as a mechanic who specializes in repairing cranes. He meets Ali Reza (Saeed Orkani), who befriends the newcomer and secures employment for him at his workplace. Their friendship has its ups and downs  Marhab is argumentative at times, and alternates between throwing himself into his work and lazing about the job drinking tea and smoking cigarettes. In his travels about the city, Marhab notices the beautiful Khatoun and takes an immediate interest in her. Customs being what they are, he cannot approach her openly or too closely, so he observes her at a distance  he even finds out where she lives and watches her house. Word comes to him that she is married, and that her husband has gone abroad to find work, although there has been no word of him for several months, and the family hasn't received any money from him. One day Marhab sees a policeman walk up to Khatouns house, seemingly to deliver a message  immediately following the exchange with the occupants, wailing can be heard from within. Marhab guesses that the news is about Khatouns husband, and that fate has delivered him a chance to pursue her more directly.

At first his attempts at contact are rebuffed  first by the grandmother when he delivers a gift for the little girl, then by Khatoun when she confronts him more directly than he had anticipated: Why are you following me? This exchange between the two characters is perfectly captured in all its nuances by the directors patience and technique. In the interview included on the DVD, he explains that he wanted to show the shyness that would inevitably be expressed by Marhab in real life. Mitra Hadjar, who portrays Khatoun, is the only professional actor in the film, and is a well-known star in Iran  all of the other characters are played by non-actors recruited by Pitts during his pre-production period of actually living in the neighborhood where Its winter was to be filmed. Before shooting this scene, Pitts purposefully kept the two principals apart  they met for the first time as the viewer witnesses. The embarrassment and shyness of a working class non-actor doing a scene with one of the best-known female film starts of his country is real  and its just what the scene needs to come across as uncontrived.

Khatoun slowly warms to Marhabs attentions  his gift to the family of a well-made rug seems to cement the relationship. This seeming turn in his fortunes is followed shortly by a civil ceremony wedding, and he moves in. A scene shot from a distance on the street, showing Marhab and Khatoun meeting and sharing a walking meal, is touching in its silent tenderness. Without any physical contact between the two of them (forbidden under Iranian censorship regulations), the openness of their expressions and the ease with which they interact conveys volumes  and, being filmed sometime after the two actually met, the shyness of the earlier scene is completely washed away.

Marhabs undependability and contrariness eventually get him into trouble at work. His boss, who has a reputation for not paying his workers on time, if at all, grows weary of Marhabs complaining and insolence and fires him. Now the drifter, who seemed to be on the track to settling down with a job and a family, finds himself in the same fix as Mokhtar.

One non-visual aspect of the production that bears mentioning is the use of a poem by Mehdi Akhavan-Sales (1928-1990), Winter, from 1956. The poet is one of the most beloved in Iran, and the poem was one of the directors inspirations (along with the Dowlatabadi story) for the story and mood of the film. It is presented in song form by Mohammad Reza Shajarian (vocals) and Hossein Alizadeh (tar), in segments throughout the film, to wonderful effect. Shajarian and Alizadeh are incredible musicians, and are members of the all-star group Masters of Persian Music (some of whom also play in the ensemble Ghazal). Alizadeh has composed music for other films as well, including Turtles can fly (2004) and A time for drunken horses (2000). The poem is filled with haunting images of both the physical and emotional aspects of winter  it blends with the visual imagery of the film strikingly.

The cinematography is nothing short of stunning  but not for any panoramic shots of wide spaces, flashy colors or special effects. Pitts has worked wonders here, with help from director of photography Mohammad Davoodi (perhaps best known to western filmgoers for his beautiful work on 2001's Baran). Im sure there were lights used in filming, but the results are such that each and every scene appears to be shot in natural light  both the indoor and outdoor scenes are replete with subtle shadings such as one might find in painted masterpieces. The dialogue is uncluttered, completely unforced and naturally delivered  the performances Pitts has coaxed from his non-professional cast are first-rate, and add immeasurably to the effectiveness of the film. The story is told gently and slowly, without hurry  it unfolds as if it were occurring in the real world before our eyes. There are nuances to each character that become apparent only as we get to know and understand them  no one is painted in black and white as good or bad (and Pitts has some interesting comments about this in the interview as well), just as the world around us is populated by people who are more shades of grey than in sharp, easily definable terms. The result is one of the finest examples of cinema Ive seen in years  I look forward to future efforts from this director.",1468627200,,7622,4.848228043143298
8330483,5,B001OD8E3C,"The Edinburgh Film Festival screening I saw included a Q&A session with the director, Rafi Pitts, which gave extra insight into the artistry of this remarkable director (who sold his Teheran apartment to pay for the film). As is common in Iranian ""new wave"" or ""neo-realist"" cinema, all the cast except for the leading woman (a popular actress in Iran) were non-actors. The use of a professional for the role of the leading woman was part of Pitts' strategy to attract working-class viewers, since, as Pitts noted, it is difficult to make a film about working-class people in Iran which working-class people will actually go see. Similarly, this strategy lay behind the success of the scene in which the leading character, Marhab, talks for the first time to the leading actress. Marhab's shyness worked so well because the ""actor"" was genuinely embarrassed to be meeting a star in real life. One thing I don't understand in the reviews I have read elsewhere of this film is why Marhab is described by the critics as a ""bad boy."" This was definitely not Pitts' intention.

I look forward to seeing more from Rafi Pitts.",1219190400,4,1119,4.828125
