8206065,4,0762709960,I'm fairly new to the climbing sport.  This video provided some inspirational footage to help me mentally prepare for climbing once the snow melts.,1237939200,2,147,5.125
8206066,4,0762709960,"Doug Robinson brings a lifetime of climbing and guiding experience into a video that introduces beginners to rock climbing.  The words and pictures give great tips on how to move with control and composure over vertical rock surfaces, rather than pitching and flailing desperately.  I like the video so much that I've shared it with friends who are interested in learning to climb.
There are, however, some caveats.  If brief backside nudity offends you, you may need to hide your eyes while Doug makes the point that when climbing, all you really need are shoes.  Any instructional video will have its limits, and this one does not cover how to use climbing hardware or how to throw a dyno.
If you are interested in getting started in trad climbing, this is a must for your library.  The scenery will make you want to get out there and climb-on!",1018310400,9,846,4.6891891891891895
