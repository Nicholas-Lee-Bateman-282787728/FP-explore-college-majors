5962482,5,B00F0XC8XE,"As a parent of two young soccer players I can say Tasha's video brings a fresh and effective new way to teach ball control and soccer skills. These fun games and step by step techniques are different from the local community or school drills. Tasha's passion for kids, helping others, and soccer are evident throughout the video as she works with . Also reassuring was seeing the kids comfortable and in natural settings. This video gives me a great way to practice with my kids.

5962483,5,B00F0XC8XE,This is the best soccer (or football as we Brits say) training DVD I have found. My son's skills have greatly improved since I ordered this from Amazon. There's some really cool games to improve ball control that I have never seen before. The techniques were easy to follow. It has really helped our future premier league player! My son's soccer coach was really impressed. Super quick shipping. Arrived in perfect condition.,1381276800,5,425,4.916666666666667
5962484,5,B00F0XC8XE,"I am a soccer dad and a coach. To help my team improve their skills in soccer and more specifically in ball control, I studied many films and DVD training videos. I found none to be as impressive  as the one by Tasha Nicole. She teaches ball control to kids, parents and coaches in an easy and simple step-by -step method. She makes  practices fun and engaging. I have seen marked improvement with all my kids since we begin implementing her system. I wish I had known such method existed when I played soccer in High school. I gave Tasha Nicole System 5 Star+.",1381190400,7,561,4.384615384615385
5962485,5,B00F0XC8XE,"When I wanted to help some kids get to know and love soccer, it was overwhelming to sort through 20 pages of DVDs on Amazon. But this new one caught my eye - ""Ball Control with Tasha-Nicole.""

Besides the nice rhyme, it made sense to me. Isn't ball control the very foundation of good soccer? So I ordered it and had some youngsters try out the ""TNT System."" Now they're hooked and so am I.

This video is a great mix of fun and discipline that really motivates. Tasha is the best kind of instructor, one who clearly demonstrates the required skills, and shows us how to master them, one step at a time.

It is truly INSTRUCTIVE - for students, coaches, family and friends. Tasha cares. And all of us can grow by watching, listening, and by practicing her system. Because we all need a solid foundation.",1379376000,13,803,4.412162162162162

5962495,1,B00F0XC8XE,"Ok, so I'm confused -- this seems to be a promotional video for the training system, but there isn't much instruction in the video (?). It's all testimonials and promotion, from what we can see. Very disappointed. We are returning it.",1424304000,,234,4.7317073170731705

5962503,5,B00F0XC8XE,"I am an AYSO Coach in California .Grew up in Ireland playing soccer pretty much every day and still play today .
I broke out some of the drills on my U7 Girls team , focusing on the juggling section using the knees and feet . It was a change of pace for the girls from the typical 'Internet'  drills I had been running all season .Their response was excellent . They were certainly challenged but all of them were able to accomplish the basics after a short time . Some friendly competition developed . Each girl delighted in telling me how many 'keep ups' they could do. These drills are good foundations for game situations with balls coming at different speeds and heights and for developing the art of playing the more subtle pass and touch .

Look forward to moving on to the other drills in the series including soccer tennis and soccer basketball .

On a side note the content  is clear and  professionally produced .Clearly a lot of time was spent developing the material .You won't be disappointed !",1383091200,12,1008,4.4863387978142075
5962504,5,B00F0XC8XE,"This video title states it is for kids of all ages, and that is absolutely correct. My 6 -year old son is in his first year of recreational soccer and the techniques demonstrated in this video have been really essential in improving his confidence on the field. When it clicked in his mind that he could have ball control, he improved in all aspects of his game. I can't wait to keep using these techniques as he grows older.

But, what is really great about this video is that is also helps all different types of parents. I was not a soccer player and felt a little lost on how I could help my son improve when practicing at home. My husband played soccer, but he works crazy hours so he wasn't available to coach my son as much as he would like. This video was my lifesaver because Tasha-Nicole wisely breaks it down into manageable sections and explains her technique so clearly that even someone like me could follow it and teach my son how to be a better soccer player.

Thank you Tasha-Nicole for making this video!",1383091200,5,1022,4.402116402116402

They needed additional help on ball control as they didn't seem to be enjoying their team practices, but really wanted to play and get better.  This training DVD has helped tremendously and more importantly, has helped them with their confidence.  Five stars !!!  -",1510617600,,443,4.776315789473684

8611241,5,B00F0XC8XE,"I ordered this DVD to help my kids with their Soccer.  Our kids are just starting Soccer, and we had them in a beginner camp over the summer for 4 weeks, and they learned the basics, but nothing really focused like real ball control. I coach youth basketball, but I have never really played soccer myself other than just kicking the ball around.  So I needed to find training aids to help me help my kids.
I started to look around the internet for different programs, or instructional videos to help my kids, and I found this DVD from Tasha Nicole.  After doing some research on this video I decided to get it.
We just received it last week, and I had set up my laptop outside so my kids can watch the video instruction and try it out.
WOW, this video is GREAT!!  Our kids loved the training from the video, and are already showing much better ball control just in the first week!
I took some time to watch the video, and it is definitely a great training video for kids, parents, and teams.  Thank you Tasha Nicole for putting together such a great training video.",1506038400,2,1065,4.358585858585859
