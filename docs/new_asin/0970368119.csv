7794194,5,0970368119,I used to live in Berlin about the time this was made so it was fun to reminisce,1487721600,,80,3.5
7794195,4,0970368119,"A good mix of history with sights of Berlin 10-12 years after reunification.  It's pretty matter-of-fact with not much frills.  Copyright is 2002 and some of the expectations of things to come in the city at that time have now become reality.  Film quality is a little old, not HD-quality, but still good to watch.",1485475200,,314,4.672727272727273
7794196,1,0970368119,"This documentary does not really ""show"" Berlin or the ""hidden history"" of Berlin.  I was expecting WWI or WWII details.  I was very disappointed.",1393891200,,145,5.0
7794197,3,0970368119,"I agree with the other reviewer that the production quality of BHH is not studio quality.  Perhaps it's even amateurish, but if you are going to visit Berlin, this seems to me to be a better than average travel video.

Quite frankly, the most interesting question I found about the video was what a complete ass John Woods must be if the production team of Woods and Ladd sat down and came up with the idea that Brian Ladd had more on screen appeal.  I really didn't need Morgan Freeman to keep me enthralled, but Ladd lacks the stage presence of Ken Burns on a week long course of Quaaludes and Dos Equis.

It focuses morosely, perhaps even to the extent of being maudlin, on Berlin's darker history and it's political points are naive and under-researched.  Nothing on Berlin's roaring 20's.  A complete fail on Berlin's tremendous and unique contribution to the cinematic arts.  No Jung.  No Kafka.  And what happened to the Love Parade?  (In fact it kind of alludes to the love parade in a twisted kind of faux-cultural critique.)

There is also nothing of the mysticism which permeates Berliner culture from the 1920's all the way through the Nazi era.

In fact, there is entirely too much focus on totalitarianism, both left and right.  However, it's accuracy surrounding East Germany is slanted at best and devoid of analytical content.  It seems like the producers thought that it was more important to cover the deeds of Berlin's leadership, rather than the resistance to that leadership--the White Rose, Diedrich Boehnhoffer, the Red Orchestra, and a more in-depth look at the ingenious operations to escape and assist escape over, under and around the Wall.

Having said that, this video is a condensed version of history that an American needs to know before visiting Berlin.  Especially for younger people.  Unfortunately, it comes wrapped in a package that is almost too painful to bear.  I slept through lots of this kind of film when I was in grade school.  If you are going to Berlin, I would cautiously recommend this as a preview.  I would also recommend seeing the dentist.

Last thing.  Woods and Ladd are not allowed to do any of their own talent in their productions.  Someone, maybe a grad student in History, must be available with more charisma than Egon Krenz.  And, really, how do you do this and not show things on a map?  People go to film school for a reason.",1342224000,,2390,4.714975845410628
7794198,2,0970368119,"Interesting to watch, but its done in a very, very old setup where one person delivers a monologue, then onto some video, and back to the monologue. Exposure quality ranges from acceptable to mediocre. It reminds me of the high school days when a teaching movie came in and we went to the AV room, and the noisy projector would start up to show the movie. What's missing here and perhaps what should have been added is the fake projector noise and the warbling unsteady sound of a cheap teaching movie. The content is interesting but not very creative or original.",1290729600,,564,4.594059405940594
7794199,2,0970368119,"This is a bad documentary.  The book it was based on was wonderful and informative.  And Berlin itself is one of the most interesting and historically important cities in the world.  So how can the film be so bad?  It shows many, many buildings, landmarks and sites without telling you what they are and why they're important.  I only know, from having read the book.  This film seems to focus more on medieval history than on the last hundred years. It offers no insights and very explanations of why the building or site you're seeing is important.  What a waste.  This could have been so useful or at least interesting. Save your money. Read the book.",1199577600,,654,4.577586206896552
7794200,5,0970368119,"This is a worthwhile documentary for anyone who plans to visit Berlin or simply wants to know more about the city from its beginnings 800 years ago through its growth as a major European capital in the late 1800s to the horrors of the 1930s and 1940s and then to its stunning and redemptive rebirth today.

 The DVD has, besides an intro and conclusion, six sections offering images of period paintings and photographs and contemporary shots of buildings and other architecture.  The sections cover the Middle Ages, the royal period, modernity (meaning the early 1900s), the Nazi era, the Jewish experience, and the Cold War years.  Production values are high for what is essentially an academic approach.  Brian Ladd, the writer-narrator, and John Woods, the producer, use the video medium effectively to tell the story.  As an example, they cleverly use fleeting shots from a moving train as segues -- transporting, as it were, the viewer from one section to the next.

 There are too many interesting details in all periods to enumerate here.  Especially valuable, however, is the long look at the Jews of Berlin, numbering up to 200,000 in their heyday in the pre-Hitler years.  Ladd and Woods show Berlin's largest Jewish cemetery, where they linger with some irony on the tombstones of those who fought for their German fatherland in World War I.  They also take the viewer to the former site of a concentration camp just outside Berlin, where barracks and other sections have been reconstructed and posted with photos and text to remind Berliners and tourists alike what went on there.  It is evident that Berlin, rather than hiding the brutality of its Nazi  past, is facing it publicly and memorializing its victims not only here but, as is shown, at the Central Holocaust Memorial, an architectural shock, and at the New Jewish Museum, under construction.

 Several key people are interviewed, including a history professor, a professor of architecture, and the director of the New Berlin Synagogue.  Not to be missed are the enlightening remarks of Peter Pulzer, professor emeritus of government from Oxford University, on the Jews in Berlin then and now.",1158624000,7,2166,5.0083798882681565
7794201,1,0970368119,"Berlin's ""hidden history"" remains hidden in this uninformative, self-indulgent pastiche. The film makers spend too much time on out-the-window shots from the S-Bahn, without even trying to identify the passing sights. Tendentious disquisitions on famous sights fail to identify the sites, the neighborhoods, or even streets and surrounding buildings. Too little history and too little geographical information make this film a waste of time.",1155859200,5,441,5.90625
7794202,4,0970368119,"This film is more scholarly than the typical ""explore-a-region""  documentary because it was written by an expert on the city, Brian Ladd.  Instead of touring Berlin region by region, the film tours the city by historical era, starting in the Middle Ages, going through the Royal Era, the Weimar Era, the Nazi Era, the Divided City and the present. Ladd explores and explains the different types of architecture found in the city, and how the buildings relate to the various times in which they were built. There is extensive time devoted to ""Jewish Berlin,"" both past and present, including the magnificent synagogue and the new Jewish museum.  The DVD also contains, as extras, erudite discussions by Professors Johannes Helmrath and Peter Pulzer, who add additional historical background. Highly recommended for anyone who is planning to visit Berlin, or who is just interested in this fascinating city.

For those who want to see more of Berlin, I also recommend the masterpiece: ""Belin, Symphony of a Great City,"" filmed in 1927.  It is a remarkable film that puts you in the middle of the city before it was destroyed by war. Additionally, Wim Wenders' film ""Wings of Desire,"" while not about Berlin per se, contains excellent footage of how Berlin looked just a few years before the fall of the wall.",1110672000,15,1306,4.945205479452055
7794203,4,0970368119,"""Berlin's Hidden History"" provides an insightful glimpse into the Berlin of today and the psyche of its citizens, primarily as revealed in restorative and modern architecture, reflecting the pervasive influence of the past. Emphasis is on events of the post-Weimar Republic, however earlier history is not neglected.
A balanced and enlightening view of a great city's past.",1044662400,7,373,5.56140350877193
