8632167,5,B00HEY9F2Y,"The bust is really cool and its nice you can remove the mask to show his gnarly face.
I was blown away by the 3D edition of Predator, especially considering the movies from 1987.
Not a huge fan of 3D, but this was one of those movies it really worked with the Jungle setting.",1472083200,,275,4.111111111111111
8632168,5,B00HEY9F2Y,"Movie:
The movie was great. Lots of action, lots of fire fights and more. I will not tell you all about the story, but it is about aliens coming to this world to take advantage of hunting living beings, not animals, but humans. The rescue team is set out to find lost travelers and ends up taking the first step in saving the planet from killers from outside the planet earth.

3D:
The 3D is amazing. The transformation from 2D to 3D is beyond our expectations. I do not know how or what method the industry takes to convert 2D to 3D, but it must have taken a long, long time to convert because the 3D visual was fantastic. We have a lot of 3D blus in our library and this one is among the top ten for 3D quality.

Bust display:
The bust is of the ""Predator"" of nearly life size ratio of a human head. The front face mask is removable which easily slips off the bust. However, when the mask is removed, be warned of the hideous looking alien because that is one ugly ""mother <fill in the blank>"". Scared the crap out of my grandson the first time he saw the mask being removed.

Recommendation:
If you like the ""Predator"" series, then get this statue if you can. You will not regret the investment. It is a great piece to display in your movie library.",1411689600,2,1252,4.2301255230125525
