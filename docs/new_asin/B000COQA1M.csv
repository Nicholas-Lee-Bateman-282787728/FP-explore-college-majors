It's really a narrative that changes every time you work through it. Pretty clever actually, since the entire game playback/programming is accomplished entirely through DVD navigation authoring. Randomized chapter selection ain't easy! It was all shot with Pixelvision, which is why it looks so raunchy. This is supposed to push a sci fi aesthetic touching on old moonlanding footage. He could have used a higher res camera, but then it would have looked less authentic (which is hilarious if you think about it. Higher res, but less authentic...)

It's full of indirect jokes and off-kilter character development between the main character and various robots. The running joke is that the robots all assume they have mastered the important aspects of being human without understanding or suffering the effects and condition of being human. The captain is caught in a pathetic situation of being immortal, because he is revived in a new body every time he goes through the process of death.

There is some intellectual depth there, but it's also really silly. You HAVE to let your eyeballs go a little and enjoy it. There isn't going to be any ""Red Planet"" composite space walk sequence in this thing. It requires you to slow the 'eff' down and use your brain a little. Follow the narrative. If you can't handle the inner story and lack the patience for the pace of Kubrick's 2001, you are going to miss the entire point here, and most of the jokes as well. Ah well, it probably wasn't for those people anyway. That's who 'Medal of Honor' was coded for. Not that there's anything wrong with that...

PS: I am not Simon Tarr. I do know him, and I do own my own copy of Quark Star. I am not shilling for him here. I have played it to the end several times without any provocation from him, and I thought more of it each time.",1328486400,,1946,4.618497109826589
8201759,1,B000COQA1M,"6,000 chunks of trivia, presented in random order, do not add up to a fulfilling entertainment experience -- or really any experience at all.  With a space ship crafted of kitchen foil and a helmet to match, on a ""set"" that would have been embarrassingly amateurish in the '60s, some nebish in glasses & jeans talks to the camera or mimes silly activities in a multitude of minute-long fragments.  The idea seems to be that he's stranded in space and things have become horrific back home, but after watching segments with mounting impatience for 3/4 of an hour, I finally had to admit that a coherent story was never going to be revealed.  Whatever you do, don't waste $25 on this self-absorbed piece of navel lint.",1247356800,2,716,4.666666666666667
8201760,5,B000COQA1M,"Hi. I'm the filmmaker. If you gave five stars to Larry the Cable Guy and Lita Ford's greatest hits (see above), you're not going to like my work, so please don't get it. You might want to look around for other reviews or watch it on netflix first to see if you're into interactive art. Thanks.",1204416000,3,293,4.25
8201761,1,B000COQA1M,"OK, this piece of crap was made in some nerd's parent's basement. It's in black and white , probably filmed on a cheap pc/webcam. It's just a bunch of clips presented in random order ( probably because the producer/director/actor wasn't clever enough to think of a plot). The clips are only about a minute long and aren't very funny. ""Atack of the Killer Tomatoes"" looks like an multi Oscar winner compared to this. The worst thing about this DVD is..
