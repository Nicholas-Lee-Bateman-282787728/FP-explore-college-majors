2775010,4,B000NOKFJ4,"Bobby Collins used to do a show on the Comedy Club or Comedy Channel?  He was great!  I have been looking for a DVD of him for a while. Yes, he includes a line or 2 from the old days but since it has been 12 years since we have seen him it was still hysterical.  We had to stop it several times because by husband and friend couldn't breathe.  I thought they would have a heart attack or stroke, seriously.  We had to watch it twice after that because they laughed so long, they missed half of it. One problem though.  It was way to short!",1226966400,,539,3.9906542056074765
2775011,2,B000NOKFJ4,"Bobby Collins used to be the #1 comic in America to me a few years ago. However, with the last 2 DVD's and last 2 cd's, all with duplicate material, it is a shame that I can no longer say that.  he is still one of my favorites but this DVD has the same old material he was doing years ago.  I'd love to see a new and improved up to date Bobby.",1178409600,5,343,3.684931506849315

8180112,5,B000NOKFJ4,"Bobby Collins is a really funny, funny guy - you need to not be offended by the ""blue"" humor, though!  Seeing him on stage is so much better than just listening to him on CD.  His facial expressions and mannerisms are hilarious!  This is well worth the expense!!",1392595200,,262,4.416666666666667
