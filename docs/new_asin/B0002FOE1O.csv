It is definitely for absolute beginners, but she covered everything I need to know to correctly handle and start playing the clarinet. She only spent a few minutes on embouchure, but I think she covered it well enough to give me a clear picture. She did a couple examples of ""if you do this wrong, it will sound like this"" and they were really helpful. I'm definitely happy that I got it.",1380585600,,475,4.288888888888889
8027858,5,B0002FOE1O,This is a good video for the person who is new to the clarinet.  A lot of good basic information.,1319587200,,97,3.85
8027859,5,B0002FOE1O,Every beginner clarinet player in my program must view this video before they receive their clarinets. This is their first lesson.,1236384000,,130,5.238095238095238
