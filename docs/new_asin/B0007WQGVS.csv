2247008,4,B0007WQGVS,We've purchased all three seasons released. Unfortunately our small town didn't have a copy of the third anywhere so we had to go to Amazon and what do ya know . . . they have it in stock and ship it right away. If you like the cheesy drama of the 90's you'll love silk stalkings.,1128902400,,280,4.017857142857143
2247009,5,B0007WQGVS,Silk stalkings was a hit on USA during its run it had everything you would want in a miami beach dective show.,1127520000,5,110,4.045454545454546
2247010,5,B0007WQGVS,I am so glad to have Silk Stalkings on DVD.  The third season is great.  The show just gets better and better each season.  I am looking forward to Season 4 on DVD.  Love the characters Rita and Chris.  They remind me so much of Benson and Stabler on Law and Order SVU.  This is a great show for those who like Law and Order SVU.  It may not be as gritty as Law but it still has great story lines.  This is a must for those old fans of the show.  Go buy it!,1125878400,6,457,3.7263157894736842
2247011,5,B0007WQGVS,"Hello, I would like to know if anyone has experienced a problem with disc 3, episode ""The party's over""( at 42 minutes and 41 seconds the image briefly turns to pixels and then it comes back). Please, let me know it! Thanks.",1125619200,,224,4.357142857142857
2247012,4,B0007WQGVS,"Season 3 was the 2nd best season (after season 2), the plusses being the continued chemistry of Estes and Kapture, some cute medical examiners, and the introduction of the comic Captain Lipschitz, well played by Charlie Brill.  The show continued with the somewhat lighter tone introduced in season 2, but does have several rather serious episodes, which, while not high drama, work due to the leads' efforts.  The flaws of the season would be signs of the beginning of the end; John Byner, who played a likeable hustler who had a love/hate relationship with our heroes,  left suddenly midseason and we're introduced to his brother ""Atticus"", not as well-played and a somewhat sleazier character (I suspect these scripts were written for Byner, and he declined, as Atticus acts more like a pervert than a good-natured con-artist).

Also, as this was the 1st season the show was cable-only, it does appear to have slightly cheaper production values (as if that was possible) than seasons 1 & 2, although that was always part of the show's charm; it had no right to really work, and yet it does.

So if you like charismatic leads, over-the-top plots, and Cinemax-after-dark love scenes w/o nudity (featuring Carrie-Ann Moss and Robert Forster, among others, during the season), then Silk Stalkings seasons 1-3 are for you.  Season 4 was a lot more ""serious,"" with lame love relationships for the cops, and might be for die-hards only.  But seasons 2 & 3, especially, are a lot of fun.",1123200000,15,1482,4.904
2247013,5,B0007WQGVS,"Nominated for only one Emmy, the entertainment quality of Silk Stalkings is nevertheless evidenced by its nine season run which is one of the most enduring ever for an original cable TV series. Partly responsible for this lack of critical acclaim is that Silk Stalkings was a trailblazer in the cable genre, and handing out Emmys to original cable series didn't become fashionable until the late-1990s when Sex And The City and The Sopranos broke the cable barrier for good. Another contributing factor to the lack of peer recognition is that Silk Stalkings lasted about four seasons longer than it should have, given that nearly the entire cast and crew were replaced after the first five seasons. Regardless, this hour-long drama series set in Palm Beach, Florida contains all the necessary ingredients for a hit show - beautiful people in a beautiful setting with lots of murder, violence, and intrigue. Silk Stalkings offers everything one could ask for in a TV drama, and the show's success helped pave the way for additional original cable series such as Monk and The Shield...

Silk Stalkings follows the exploits of two Palm Beach, Florida detectives who investigate murders and other high profile crimes in an elite community which is no stranger to fame and fortune. Sgt. Chris Lorenzo (Rob Estes) and Sgt. Rita Lee Lance (Mitzi Kapture) are partners on the local Palm Beach Police Department, and each episode they must investigate one or more high-profile crimes. The dynamic relationship between Chris and Rita is a focal point of the show, and the two will overturn every stone and use every tactic at their disposal to bring justice to those who, either due to fame and/or wealth, believe they are above the laws that governor average people... Veteran entertainer Ben Vereen plays their boss, Capt. Hutchinson, in seasons one through three before being replaced by Charlie Brill (Capt. Harry Lipschitz) for the remainder of the series... Overall, Silk Stalkings is a finely scripted investigative drama cut from the same mold as Law & Order SVU...

The Silk Stalkings (Season 3) DVD features a number of dramatic episodes including the season premiere ""Crime of Love"" in which Rita becomes disillusioned when the parole board grants an early release to Tony Fielding, a convicted criminal apprehended by Rita several years earlier... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""Love Never Dies"" in which the Palm Beach fashion community is rocked when a young model dies from a drug overdose, and ""The Scarlet Shadow"" in which Rita becomes the subject of an internal investigation when she's the last person to see one of her friends before that friend turns up murdered...

2247068,5,B0007WQGVS,"This series continues to get better and better. One of your reviewers commented he or she thought season 3 was weaker than the previous seasons, but I respectfully disagree. The relationship between the two main characters seems to be getting stronger than ever, with a few bumps and bruises of course. The writing is up to par with previous seasons, I think. Look, this show will not go down as one of the best ever, but for my money, it is still very, very good. Looking forward to the next season.",1214697600,,500,4.5054945054945055

I recommend this series. It lasted for 8 seasons it had to be good especially on a cable network.,1213488000,,257,4.733333333333333

2247072,5,B0007WQGVS,"One more t.v. series I came across while looking on Amazon that I added to my Wish List and received as a birthday present.  I was skeptical of my taste in the early 90s vs. today.  I remember thinking it was a kind of a newer, maybe shallower Miami Vice-style, that was pretty risqu for regular cable t.v.  I used to watch it sporadically on USA late at night, but probably never saw two episodes in a row.

My fiance and I watched the first episode with my parents.  None of us really got into it and I felt a little disappointed.  A little while later (days? a week?) my fiance and I were looking for something to watch that wasn't too long, so we gave it another whirl.  After the second episode we were hooked and preceded to watch a bunch, one after another.  We cruised through the First Season way too fast that I even found myself watching the Extras!  To make a long story short, we're about half way through the Fifth Season now and dread the inevitable, that this is the last season out on DVD.

Yes, there is 90s cheese, florescent outfits that we can't believe we thought were cool, some questionable hairdos, swimsuits, only large-chested women always seemingly getting out of a pool at the crime scene wearing a thong bikini, every episode opens with a sex scene that ends in someone's death, and the list goes on and on.  However, we are totally hooked and love every episode and season!  It's part romantic comedy, part t.v. detective series drama.  I loved Miami Vice, but usually didn't find myself laughing whereas with Silk we are laughing during every episode and feeling good at the end of them.  There also is very little blood and gore.  You get the idea of what happened, but often see no blood when someone is killed.  The chemistry between Chris and Rita as well as them and the others characters is great.  I would say our only disappointment is you get attached to a few characters that all of the sudden never show up again in an episode (some of the coroners, Cotton, etc.).  Also, they are kind of bad about reusing characters that had such strong parts in episodes that it is sometimes weird to see them again in a different episode as someone different.  All in all, 5-Stars!",1187222400,,2211,4.468827930174563
2247073,5,B0007WQGVS,"My hubby is a groupie for this series, so he is thrilled with it.  Good quality, basic packaging, but full of everything he wanted.",1172016000,,131,4.458333333333333
8052978,5,B0007WQGVS,"The first two DVD sets (Season 1 & Season 2) have interviews from several cast members as well as from Stephen J. Cannell himself. He said of the show it was his longest running show (i.e., 8 seasons).

The show is about two cops who have a certain chemistry & are best friends who deeply care about each other. They are both detectives and are assigned cases that are referred to as silk stockings (sexual based crimes of passion) and the show takes place in Palm Beach Florida although most of it was filmed in San Diego and some of it in Scottsdale, AZ. Rita (Mitzi Kapture) narrates the stories that she and Chris (Rob Estes) star in during the first 5 seasons. That narration helps out a lot, but you won't find it after Mitzi left the show.

The new Captain, Harry Lipshitz (Charlie Brill) has a history with the NYD and Donny Dogs. The show just keeps getting better. Cotton Dunn is back. And the chemistry between Chris & Rita keeps getting stronger. Can't help but get the feeling that the sexual scenes at the beginning of most episodes is closer to soft porn.

I am glad that I bought the series. Mine had 6 discs (single sided) 2 in each case and 3 cases in an outer box.",1490659200,,1183,4.343891402714932
