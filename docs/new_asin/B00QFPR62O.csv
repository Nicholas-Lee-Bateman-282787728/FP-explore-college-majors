Also, it was something maybe from in the 40's. I know I had never seen any of the films on this DVD. Heck, I haven't even heard of any of these..",1503705600,,290,3.9322033898305087
8691116,5,B00QFPR62O,"Meet my expectations, as Amazon asked? No, it exceeded them! Well worth the price! I bought the DVD strictly for the 1949 Steve Reeves rarity, the Tarzan knock-off known as Kimbar of the Jungle. Sadly, Kimbar never made it past the pilot episode, ""The Lion Men of Tanganyika."" Despite its laughably low budget - Reeves made the quintessential jungle hero a full decade before becoming the quintessential heroic Greek demi-god and a household name.
  However, there were other lost treasures among the collection as well. The casts of these additional lost TV classics are impressive enough - Don Haggerty, Doug Fairbanks, Jr., Pulette Goddard, an aging Lon Chaney, Jr., and a young Richard Kiel - but the stories themselves are intriguing in a quaint, straightforward way today's television sadly lacks. From the Files of Jeffrey Jones, ""Pigeon Hunt"" (1952) makes the viewer actually care about the fate of a man who is either a murderer or an innocent who's been framed for the killing. Bulldog Drummond, ""The Ludlow Affair"" (also from 1952)  The 1961 episode of The Phantom must have been chosen for this colletion for its stellar cast because it's not very typical for the title character who has gone undercover; i.e., there is virtually no sign of his trademark purple costume and mask. As it is described as an unaired pilot, that alone would qualify it as ""lost."" Whatever he reason, it's an excellent episode with lots of action.
  Finally, there's the absolute oddity and possibly the most interesting show on the disc,  The Storyteller (once again dipping into the well of 1952), featuring the magnetic presence of its star, Marvin Miller. Most people my age (60) met him through the TV series, The Millionaire.  The Storyteller was the television version of Miller's radio series, The Story Behind the Story. Its unusual format consisted of Miller sitting in front of a camera while, as the series title says, simply telling a true story. I can see how this format might alienate most of today's audience members, but I found it utterly fascinating.
  The transfers are clean, and the sound is good. Neither are perfect, of course, but they are as crisp as broadcast television usually was back in the 1950's, so the target audience for the collection really should have no complaints. I'd buy a replacement copy in a heartbeat.",1438646400,4,2339,4.946428571428571
