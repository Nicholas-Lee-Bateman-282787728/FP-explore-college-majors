8227675,5,B000XATUU8,"I got this as a learning tool and it is great.  The stories aren't traditional Christmas stories, except the first one, though.  And it is told from the point of view of the North Star, which is kind of neat.",1268524800,,208,4.175
8227676,3,B000XATUU8,"These stories were enjoyable. However, I would recommend the product for older students who can read the subttitles fairly fast. It did not work as well for Kindergarden and 1st grade classes.",1231200000,,192,5.03125
8227677,5,B000XATUU8,"Most of my review (below) will be the same as the one I posted for the related product - Stories from Around the World - as they are very similar, just different stories.  I wanted first to add, though, that really only two out of the five stories in this collection are specific to Christmas.  This isn't at all a criticism, on the contrary it's to let you know that these are stories you will be able to enjoy year-round.  We especially love Tucket the Bucket - and the Elves and the Shoemaker is a classic.

I first discovered Bookbox products while living in China and searching for high quality educational materials that would help my young daughter (then 4 years old) learn the language. Their ""anibooks"" remain some of the best products I've found - daughter still loves to watch them after over two years now. It is so helpful to be able to see subtitles in either language (in our case, English/Chinese)- sometimes I will turn off the sound entirely and ""read"" the English subtitles to my duaghter so she can learn the stories. Most of the time, however, she is very happy to listen to the story in Mandarin and is gradually picking up the language along the way. Beyond the excellent quality of the graphics and the audio (the Mandarin narrator is very clear and easy to understand), I love the multicultural, gentle nature of the stories themselves. Even if you try to limit ""screen time"" as we do, you can feel good about the time your child spends reading/watching this dvd. Finally, the dvds support a great cause - promoting literacy worldwide.",1222128000,2,1560,4.620938628158845
8227678,4,B000XATUU8,"This DVD is a helpful supplemental tool for anyone learning Mandarin Chinese.  There are five animated stories: The First Christmas, The Elves and the Shoemaker, Tucket the Bucket, The Greatest Treasure, and Santa's Christmas.  The animation is elementary (the kind where characters' joints seem to move on hinges), but it is fitting since the style of the movie is one of a narrator reading a book.  The audio is in English or Mandarin, and the subtitles can be viewed in English, simplified Chinese characters, or both at once.  The characters are displayed in karaoke style, each character lighting up as it is spoken.  The slow pace of the narration and the subjects of classically Western stories are helpful in expanding my basic vocabulary and keeping my daughter's interest in learning Chinese.",1217116800,2,802,5.091603053435114
8227679,5,B000XATUU8,"These stories focus on Christmas but the words I wrote in the other review (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000XATUWG) apply fully. For people's convenience, am posting below.

These stories are absolutely beautiful! If I could give more than 5 stars I would truly do so. The text, music, animation are done superbly. The DVD menus are elegant and easy to navigate. The characters felt so real I felt I could touch them on the screen. All narratives carry a very positive message, being very sensitive to culture.

More so, the stories appealed to both the child and the adult in me. I wish BookBox had existed when I was growing up -- it would been a blessing for someone who craved a deeper connection to other languages, other cultures, and to my own family.

Indeed, parents and children will find these stories are a wonderful way of connecting with each other. Educators will find the audio and subtitles in different languages help in reinforcing literacy and language. This is based on proven models as BookBox has evolved from a mass literacy project developed by Dr. Kothari.

And for those that feel $14.95 is expensive -- give it a chance. I had similar thoughts but after checking the DVDs I felt it was very fair as I was getting high quality. To me, this is the standard price for a DVD and worth it, considering I can keep and cherish for a long time.

A little background to put my words in context -- I am 27 years old and am fully trilingual, having grown up in India and Brazil. I have known BookBox since the beginning and believe in their mission of promoting literacy and culture in a fun way. I have donated time, energy and financial support to them and will be gifting these treasured DVDs to children in my life.",1214870400,,1733,4.613636363636363
