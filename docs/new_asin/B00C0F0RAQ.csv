5683389,5,B00C0F0RAQ,"This is my favorite story.  While I love the more recent movie, I have to say, I actually find this mini series to be in many ways even better than the movie.  The movie, however, is still excellent.",1506211200,,199,4.2105263157894735
5683390,4,B00C0F0RAQ,"I love this version of Jane Eyre, but I am deducting a star for the video as the subtitles are not in sync with the visuals so it's difficult to watch when I need the cc on.",1505606400,,173,3.7027027027027026

8576030,5,B00C0F0RAQ,Caught it on Hulu where it is two long episodes and fell in love with the way this is presented. Mr Rochester is played wonderfully by a very sexy and talentedToby Stephens and Jane is Ruth Wilson who did a great break out role. Loved how the BBC maintained a lot of the book within this mini series.,1525392000,,300,4.189655172413793
8576031,4,B00C0F0RAQ,"There are a lot of scenes missing from this streaming version. Scenes that tell more of the story - add more. Can't have it all, I guess. But if you like this, borrow the DVD from a library and you'll see what I mean.",1524528000,,217,3.9545454545454546
8576032,2,B00C0F0RAQ,"I'm 24 minutes in and I don't think I'll finish. The dialogues are all off. So many little details are off (i.e., Helen Burns didn't have a tombstone, the furniture at Thornfield Hall wasn't supposed to be covered, Adele is way older than she should be). These details add up. The characters seem flat and nothing like the originals. I would have thought since a series had more time to devote to these details, they could have brought the book more to life. I get the impression that the script was written by someone who doesn't get the book...the director most definitely doesn't seem to get it. You're better off reading it

8576033,5,B00C0F0RAQ,My favorite adaptation of Jane Eyre.,1522281600,,36,5.166666666666667
8576034,5,B00C0F0RAQ,I Loved this version of Jane Eyre. It is really one of the best. Too bad for the heavy editing they do in the streaming version. Don't know why the complete version is not shown.  It seems editing is the way to go with streaming video here. It is most disappointing when you have seen the full version on CD or Television.,1512432000,3,322,4.193548387096774
8576035,3,B00C0F0RAQ,"I first watched this on DVD and really loved it. This is the best adaptation of the book that I've ever seen. Sadly, so much was missing in this streaming version. If I didn't know about it, I'm sure I wouldn't have missed it, but this edited version was a pale comparison to the full mini-series I saw on the DVD.",1509840000,4,314,4.163934426229508
8576036,5,B00C0F0RAQ,"I have read the novel several times and I have to say that it is my favorite.
I have also seen every movie and miniseries based on the novel.
Before I saw this version, I believed the 1980's BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zela Clark was the best(although a little outdated with the atmosphere of a video soap opera) and most true to the novel. And yet that version left out many of the important scenes which show the softer side of Mister Rochester, such as the time they spend together developing their relationship while spending time together enjoying the beauty and nature around Thornfield Hall. In that version, he seems harsh and cruel at times, making you wonder how Jane could fall in love with a man who at times treats her almost as badly as Mr. Brocklehurst! Still, Timothy Dalton is very dashing and passionate, and Zela Clarke is a believable Jane, although a little too prim and cool for such a passionate character.
In this version, some other parts of the novel were not elaborated upon, but so much more of the important scenes in which Jane and Edward share tender moments are developed.
This series is visually beautiful and the story told in such a way that some parts are shown as flashbacks which are stunning and serve the purpose of filling in backstory , dreams, and scenes which keep the story moving and exciting. The editing is brilliant!
The music is beautiful too.
Without spoiling, this is absolutely the best ending of them all!",1509667200,4,1467,4.6461538461538465
8576037,5,B00C0F0RAQ,"Jane Eyre has always been my favorite story, and this was the only version I had not seen yet. Without intending to, I saved the best for last. Not only did this production stay true to the vision of the novel, but the performers portrayed the characters' passion as it was always meant to truly be. More than this, I appreciated the visualization of the integral moments from Rochester's past recalled. The filmmakers went above and beyond to make the story replete. A beautiful, moving adaption of the classic tale!!!",1508025600,,519,4.777777777777778
8576038,5,B00C0F0RAQ,it is a hopeful version of Jane Eyre. Infused with as much light as is possible in a Bronte tale. True to the book but with an ending that satisfies better.,1507420800,,156,4.064516129032258
