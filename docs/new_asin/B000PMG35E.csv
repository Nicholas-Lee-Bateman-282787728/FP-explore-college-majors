8192597,4,B000PMG35E,"I have been practicing contemplative prayer as taught by Fr. Thomas Keating since the early 1990s, I happened on this series on EWTN. Fr. Dubay, who presents these programs, is much more the pedantic lecturer as opposed to Fr. Keating's conversational style, but there is a load of good stuff in each lecture, and they're well worth the effort. Quoting from the back of the DVD label: ""...widely recognized as one of the very best spiritual directors and retreat masters of our time, Father Dubay has spent many years studying and speaking on contemplative prayer, especially as taught by Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross and Sacred Scripture."" I would definitely recommend this set if one is serious about one's contemplative prayer life.",1421193600,2,744,4.96
8192598,5,B000PMG35E,"Amazon wants me to add a review, when I was hoping stars alone would suffice.  In any case, purchase this item to further your prayer life, and you won't be disappointed.  Amen.",1389657600,2,177,4.5
8192599,5,B000PMG35E,You might find Fr. Dubay's style a bit didactic as I did but stay with him.  He's very knowledgeable and the program is very helpful if you are interested in learning about contemplative prayer.  He's the old fella with the grey hair who's learned a lot in life about prayer.  That wisdom is invaluable.,1301097600,6,303,4.574074074074074
8192600,5,B000PMG35E,"this dvd set is all about true christian mystical prayer. In an age were the meaning of christian mysticism is blended and often twisted to eastern and new age ideals, its almost impossible to find a pure teaching of christian truth in book or lecture. I am not discrediting these other practices, but one is not the other and thats a fact not accepted by many. So I was very  pleased in discovering this wonderful gentleman, father thomas dubay ,and his great teachings. I have been on the deep christian prayer journey for decades and have come quite far . this lecture series deeply contributes endless new things to me. So this material is great for the beginer as well as you who are very deeply in love with the living GOD.Just a note that this is a lecture format given by a kind and brilliant priest who beleives that being head over heals in love with
GOD is the top goal in life. He realy knows this topic . I also suggest his lecture titled 'teresa of avila . personality and prayer'
