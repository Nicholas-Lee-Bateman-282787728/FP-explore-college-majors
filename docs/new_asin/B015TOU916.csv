And after watching a large number of ""supernatural"" horror films (non-slasher horror) that were in the ""stupid"" category, it was a relief to find one I found interesting! :-)",1517270400,,275,5.2272727272727275
8734611,4,B015TOU916,"Decent found footage.  Not a bad movie, and a good reason to keep filming during any kind of attack, invasion or whatever.

Spoilers

Loved the infectious demon angle and the giant nephilim you glimpse.  Keeps you wanting more.",1511308800,,227,4.894736842105263
8734612,1,B015TOU916,"This sad excuse for a movie, really put me at a loss for words. I did not like Sarah's POV. Her ability to not run and her whinny nature really put me off. Also lack of ability to do anything... really how did you make it that far.... Also that bitch Rachel why she there? she shoulda ben killed off first. DUHHHH Ok",1506211200,,316,4.031746031746032
8734613,5,B015TOU916,"Alot of people have written bad reviews because they're copies wouldn't play, but I suspect these people purchased the region B locked German release which would not work on any U.S. players because of the fact it is locked.

However, I have the region A release of this movie from Epic Pictures, and I can confirm that it does work on any and all Blu-ray players that play region A movies. Not only that, the picture quality for this Blu-ray release is absolutely beautiful. In addition to the great release, the movie itself follows a very original story that I enjoyed a lot. I highly recommend this Blu-ray release!",1503532800,,619,4.678899082568807
