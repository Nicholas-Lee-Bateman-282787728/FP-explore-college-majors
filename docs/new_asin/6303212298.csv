The film felt more orientated for adults then for children it was originally marketed towards. I don't have regrets seeing it. But I can't say I'll be in a hurry to see it again any time soon.

598243,5,6303212298,"Just saw this on TCM for the first time in decades, and I had completely forgotten (or never noticed because I was too young)... This is an absolutely BEAUTIFUL movie.  There are so many scenes that look like real paintings by the great artists.  The colors are stunning.  The artwork incredible.  It is at times just breath taking.

The story is solid, the artwork fantastic, the songs great, but ironically, the only thing that slows down this remarkable film at times is the cartoony comedy.  But this is thankfully kept to a minimum.  In fact, my roommate's mom absolutely hates cartoons.  Will not watch them, but when I told her this was Judy Garland's last movie, and it's a drama, she wanted to watch it, and actually liked it!!

Quite a classical masterpiece---from the creativity in writing, artwork in the animation to the delightful music, fantastic singing by Ms. Garland, plus an overall great story.  It also fueled my pet-less childhood to become a cat-parent in later years.  It's a MUST for all ages.

598450,3,6303212298,"A cute cartoon romp with the voices of some of history's greatest actors. It seems a bit overlong, trying to fill enough minutes to make it a full-feature film, but it has some great songs, a rudimentary lesson about the great artists of the fin de sicle and Hermione Gingold's delightful portrayal of a literal cat house madam!
It is a musical morality tale of the innocent young country kitty who goes to Paris to fall into the clutches of a wicked pimp and his associates.
The actual cartooning is not all that great; it is much flatter and plainer than ""The Aristocats.""
It's not really for the kiddies, because there's too much interplay and double entendre between Mewsette, Meowrice and Madam Rubenschatz that parents might be embarrassed to explain.
While it is an amusing film for adults, it falls short of being a great film.
But it is fun to watch.",1432339200,2,859,4.657894736842105

598763,5,6303212298,"This is a movie that has not been given NEAR the credit that it is due.

First we have to start with the voices, & what voices they are!

Robert Goulet as Jaune Tom.

Jaune Tom is a country cat, who is regarded as the world's greatest mouser, & he is indeed. When he sees a mouse, one of his eyes closes, & the other one becomes a kind of radar screen, zeroing in on his target. He bunches-up, & from the end of his tail, electricity crackles forward, & it is like he is literally shot out of a cannon. No mouse stands a chance against him. But he is quite satisfied with country life, & doesn't see the attraction of the big city. His only interest, is being in the presence of his true love, Mewsette.

Judy Garland as Mewsette

Mewsette is a farm cat that has been raised in a comfortable setting, & as Jaune Tom is in love with her, she's in love with him as well.

But when Jeanette, the sister of Marie who owns Mewsette, makes a visit from the city, & complains about the plain settings of living in the country, Mewsette is captivated by the stories of what living in Paris is like, & decides to ""accompany"" Jeanette to Paris by stowing away in the carriage that Jeanette came in on from the train station. Despite her feelings for Jaune Tom, who she now regards as ""plebeian peasant"", she sets out for Paris to become a sophisticated city cat, instead of an ordinary farm cat.

Red Buttons as Robespierre

Robespierre is a kitten, who is Juane Tom's best friend. He can't see the attraction that Juane Tom has for Mewsette, & would much rather become a mouser like like Juane Tom. When Mewsette leaves for Paris, Robespierre is overjoyed, & rushes to tell Jaune Tom, who only gets angry with him, & rushes off in an attempt to stop Mewsette. But Robespierre's loyalty to Jaune Tom cannot be swayed, & despite that he is just a kitten, while Jaune Tom is a full grown cat, he too sets off for Paris.

Paul Frees as Meowrice

Meowrice is a con artist, who will do anything for a buck. When he encounters Mewsette upon coming into Paris on the train, he quickly ""charms"" the naive Mewsette into believing that he can help her become the ""sophisticated"" city cat, that Mewsette desires. And it seems like that is exactly what he does, but we find out that he has other ulterior motives-namely what money he can get out of using Mewsette for his own ends.

Hermione Gingold as Mme. Rubens-Chatte

Mme. Rubens-Chatte is almost as much of a con-artist as Meowrice is. They have had more than a few ""dealings"" with each other, & she love money as much as he does. But she runs the most luxurious ""etiquette"" salon in Paris for introducing cats like Mewsette into Paris Society. Despite knowing what Meowrice has planned for Mewsette, she develops an affection for Mewsette, although that affection is short lived, when she thinks about the money that Meowrice is going to pay her for training Mewsette. (Some may remember Hermione Gingold as the wife of River City's mayor, in the musical-The Music Man.)

The Music of Gay Purr-ee

When you have voices like Judy Garland & Robert Goulet, you KNOW there is going to be some great singing, & Gay Purr-ee does not disappoint.

With lyrics by E.Y. Harburg & music by the great Harold Arlen, (of Wizard of Oz fame), and songs like ""Roses Red, Violets Blue"", & ""Paris is a Lonely Town"", (sung by Judy Garland), & ""Mewsette"", & ""Little Drops of Rain"", (sung by Robert Goulet), these songs work very well to support the storyline, and are absolutely delightful, & heart-wrenching at the same time.

One further note should be mentioned as well, in regard to the music of Gay Purr-ee.

The song ""The Money Cat"", that is sung by the character of Meowrice, is NOT sung by Frees, but by an uncredited Thurl Ravenscroft, (who was not only well-known as the voice of Tony the Tiger, but was also the man who did such a wonderful job with the song-""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"", from the animated ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"").

Gay Purr-ee is a movie that has never received the honor that is due it.

It is a wonderful story of love, desire, lies & deceit, & the couple who created it, the brilliant animator Chuck Jones, & his wife Dorothy, should have gotten much more praise for it than they did.

A quick note should be made here, & that is that Chuck Jones was still under contract to Warner Brothers when he & his wife created Gay Purr-ee, & this film was in violation OF that contract. This resulted in Warner Brothers firing him.

This is a great movie for all ages, & is a must-see for all animation fans!",1340755200,,4558,4.4412470023980815
598764,4,6303212298,"This Was The Greatest Cat Animated Movie I had ever seen when I was a girl; ""Gay Purr-ee"" Was The Real 1st animated Cat Movie, It came before Disney's ""Aristocats"". As a matter of fact when I watch ""Gay Purr-ee"" I can truly see many of the ideals Disney must have took from ""Gay Purr-ee"" to create the ""Aristocats"" that was made 10 yrs after ""Gay Purr-ee"". There's nothing like the original, if you want to see where it all started- This Is The One.

598818,5,6303212298,"In 2011, Woody Allen came out with his terrific hit - ""Midnight in Paris"" - which flawlessly moves between the urban sophistication of modern Paris and the intellectual crackle of Paris in the 1920's.  Martin Scorcese placed his hero ""Hugo"" in a Paris train station during the 1930's to create a steampunk mystery and a personal love letter to the origin of silent film magic.

On its ""own terms"", this movie is equal to both in the visual department. Yes, it is an animated film...but it creates a vividly colorful Paris backdrop as Van Gogh may have imagined it.  I have visited the City of Lights.  The clever post-impressionistic background of ""this"" cartoon made Paris come alive for me again.  And few chanteuses can ever compete with Judy Garland who sings one of her most wonderful numbers in the film. It's called ""Paris is a Lonely Town.""  The villain Meowrice aka ""The Money Cat"" is appropriately diabolical as he kidnaps naive cats who arrive in the city and sells them for what he can.

There is even an episode where a series of portraits of the female cat heroine (Mewsette) are imagined as if painted by all the great French artists of the century past - from Renoir to Cezanne to Picasso. Oh, so delightful.

This is a wonderful treat and it does indeed hold up after all these years.",1325203200,,1301,4.626086956521739

Garland sounds fresh and in top form, clearly in her mature peak. Goulet is her perfect compliment.

Chuck Jones and his wife actually give a brief survey of art from the 1890's perspective structured into the cartoon.

598869,5,6303212298,"This theatrical length animated classic has everything. Great voice cast, music and songs. The animation style reflects the Warner Brothers studio's short cartoons and has the look and feel of Chuck Jones' influence. Most importantly, it's funny when it needs to be. I've seen this many times over the last 40 years and it's still funny. Especially the cat villain Meowrice, voiced by Paul Frees and Hermione Gingold as the cat madam. Judy Garland's performance is bright and perky, her singing voice still vibrant. Besides a trip down memory lane, this is a great family film suitable for the young, and young at heart.
 My only complaint is that the movie was produced full frame, but the DVD is ""matted"" to match the theatrical aspect ratio. This has aired countless times full frame on tv, and that's how everyone is used to seeing it. There's no option to view the DVD full frame, but it's a small sacrifice considering it's such a beautiful copy of the film.

When I saw this movie again, I had to have a box of tissues.  When Garland sang ""Little Drops of Rain""  I so lost it!  I remembered every word even though I hadn't sung it since a child!  And the way it effected me the rest of my life became apparent!

Yes, it is hokey animation, but remember, it was made in 1962.  Not the top year for special effects or animation.

I did feel the same mixed feeling when Meuzette stopped singing ""Little Drops of Rain"" and it moved quickly into another scene.  That was the only part of the movie that confused me.  There should have been a moment to reflect on the song.  I needed that moment as a child and felt it as an adult too.

Also, the drunk scene was cute but in todays PC world, it is not funny any longer.

For those who balk because it shows a female being saved by a strong male, I could say the same about most Disney movies.  Many of us suffered from what I call ""Lady and the Tramp"" syndrome who grew up with such movies.  We never understood why we couldn't turn our tramps into winners like Lady did!

Thanks again for bringing this out on DVD.  I never realized how much this movie affected my life as I grew up.  I am passing this on to my grandkids and yes, I am over 50 and still young!

In fact, I think this movie is deriviative of ""101 Dalmatians"", a movie that was released in 1961, a year before the 1962 release of this movie.  Hollywood likes success, and copying a tried-and-true Disney formula is an attempt to capitalize on a predictable Disney success.  Both movies are about a search for lost loved-ones, both have bad guys who kidnap the lost loved-ones, and the fact that they differ in that one features cats in France while the other features dogs in England seems trivial.

My wife and I grew up with this movie showing up occasionally during our childhood (we are both fifty years old).  We are both enamored of this movie's plot and the wonderful soundtrack, which I personally judge to be superior to that of ""The Aristocats"" in every way (after all, animated movies coming from Disney Studios after Walt's death was of lesser quality until ""The Little Mermaid"" came along).

This movie is certainly no worse than ""101 Dalmatians"" and deserves much more than a two-star rating.",1128902400,8,1231,4.861244019138756

Nemo it's not...but it is a good, fun cartoon with plenty to keep everyone happy.",1126569600,2,329,4.140625

599010,5,6303212298,"Absolutely perfect restoration of a great Judy Garland movie, at least one that she lent her voice to.  Garland as ""Musette"" makes the cutest kitty with a dream.  A dream of leaving the farm for the big city, then discovering that the farm life wasn't so bad after all.  Juanne Tom (pardon the spelling...it means ""yellow tom"" in French) is her potential beau, a cat who's voiced by Robert Goulet.  Red Buttons is great in the film, also.  A fantastic family film.  I'd been waiting for years for this to be released.",1122854400,2,517,4.565217391304348

599012,4,6303212298,"I do not think that this film could hold the attention of the majority of Ed, Edd and Eddy-addicted children out there, but it really is a treat for the rest of us.  With its great show-tune musical (how could you not appreciate the power behind Garland's voice?!) numbers and artsy backgrounds/animations, I found Gay Pur-ee to be thoroughly amusing.  It's definitely vintage, so if you're pining for action-packed Power-Ranger slop or new-ish Disney wit, this is not a film for you.",1098748800,3,484,4.890243902439025
599013,5,6303212298,"If you've seen every Judy movie but have shied away from this one because Judy doesn't even appear onscreen in it..well you're in for a sueprise!
Judy as Mewsette is so enchanting, so hysterically funny, so French and so feline! There are sad moments, happy moments..but trust me this is an exceptional effort (especially if you love gorgeou animation) and one worth having in your collection.
Here's my original rave review...
Gay Purr-ee is meowriffic!!!!
I love it!!! The animation is gorgeous, striking and technically brilliant, Walt Disney eat your heart out. I particularly love the visuals with the different artists of the 'gay 90's' in France...Cezanne, Toulouse Lautrec, Seurat, Picasso, Monet, Van Gogh, etc. Very 'American in Paris', feline style.
Judy's voice is purrfect. As Mewsette, she's very French, very provincial with a touch of Parisian breathlessness, when she sings it's achingly beautiful.
Janune Tom is a honey. And the Money cat is the villain..the scene where the villain is mean is classic. Judy really put on the hysterics.
Funny bits..when she tries to walk with a bowl of milk on her head. And fails. Touches of Gigi.
the buggy ride. 'What's kissing?' 'erm, it's like touching noses' how true.
Chanpagne, Champignons and Champs Elysees. Bad American French. What'll you'll have? Milk? No make it Cream! How about...bubbles? And the cats actually get drunk.
Am I the only one who appreciates this film???
Put Gay Purree up there with Wizard of Oz on the shelf. You won't be disappointed.",1075507200,20,1519,5.08

And now it is here on DVD. And I must admit: This is a sweet cartoon. I especially like the sequence where Suzette is painted in many different styles (impressionistic and so on).
And my wife is happy!",1061424000,9,365,3.945945945945946
599077,5,6303212298,"This movie was one of my most favorite movies to watch as a child. Once it came out on DVD I snatched it right up.

599078,1,6303212298,"When I was younger, I thought this film was ok.  I saw that it came out on DVD so I bought it.  Maybe my kids will like it.  My God, was I wrong!  Jeez, was I embarrassed! As my kids were watching it, for as young as they were, they still showed facial expressions of being disgusted with it's lame, unamusing, out-dated charm and of its being so unappealing.  I almost ran to the bathroom to throw up because I was so embarrassed for having them watch such a lame, boorish, cartoon.

The story is just, well, so-so, nothing exceptional.  But, the songs are stomach-wretching!  That kind of music was out-dated even in 1962.  You'd have to be over 80 to find these songs entertaining.  I had to apologize to my kids.  Now, they're going to question me on anything else I bring home on DVD.  I really blew it!  Now, I desperately have to get rid of this stupid DVD quickly.  But, who can I give it to?  Someone under the age of 4, or someone older than 80 years old?  If I just threw it in the trash, my trash can would feel insulted.

I'm looking at the stupid DVD movie cover right now.  I'm feeling flushed and ill!  I only hope I don't vomit on my keyboard!

Believe me, think before you buy this movie.  And, don't think that you're going to be doing your kids any favors with this one.  This film will kill your credibility with them!  You have been warned.

599079,5,6303212298,"This was my favorite animated movie as a child.  I was transfixed when I saw it at the age of six and still am (too many years later).  The colors are beautiful, and one would be hard-pressed to find a little girl who doesn't fall in love with Mewsette. As far as I'm concerned, that is the ONLY name for a fluffy white feline.  And Jean-Tom is a real boy's cat, too.  I found a copy which my three girls, ages 10, 7, and 3 are all equally in love with. And it also gives a very amusing yet informative mini art lesson.",1049846400,9,519,4.009708737864078

When I learned that it was coming out on DVD I dug out my VHS copy and had a look, but couldn't make it all the way through. Disney's animation supremacy lasted so long because of films like this; cloying, cutesy-poo Disney knock-offs. I don't know anything about the production history of this turkey, but it reeks of a cold eyed attempt to cash in on the Disney market and a total absence of real enthusiasm. The songs are distinctly third rate, the voice acting is sub-Flintstones standard, and Chuck Jones' art is some of his least inspired.
  The whole film is shoddy, trivial, and annoying. It might entertain small children for whom Pokemon is too sophisticated, and I suppose that Garland fanatics will want a copy. As for everyone else: If you want to watch a musical, see The Music Man or Gigi. If you want first rate animation buy Spirited Away.",1049673600,,916,4.613496932515337

The background and animation are an incredible combination of French Impressionist art and charming 60s kitsch.  A fantastic antidote for today's violent ""superhero"" cartoons.

599084,5,6303212298,"""Gay Purr-ee"" is a very charming film that is sure to delight the whole family. It is cleverly and artfully presented, with Chuck Jones'  trademark Looney Tunes-esque animation, and a sweet little story, which,  though rather slim, holds the viewer's interest for every single one of its  eighty-six minutes. It also showcases some of the best vocal talent in  town: Judy Garland, Robert Goulet, Red Buttons, Paul Frees, and Hermione  Gingold. The story is simple: French country farm cat Mewsette (Garland,  using clever vocals) is bored with her dull and listless existence, and  leaves her home, her ardent suitor Jaune-Tom (Goulet, also in excellent  voice), and friend Robespierre (Buttons, whose squeaky characterizations  are pefect for his diminutive character). Once in Paris, the naive Mewsette  meets up with cunning Meowrice (Frees, perfectly diabolic) and Madame  Rubens-Chatte (Gingold, also with interesting vocals), who plan to make a  little money by making Mewsette into a courtesan, then selling her off to a  fat old tabby cat in Pittsburgh who wants a wife. But Jaune-Tom and  Robespierre are hot on their tails... The movie is also blessed with a  splendid songbook by E.Y. Harburg and Harold Arlen, who gave you the score  of ""The Wizard of Oz"". Children will enjoy the film's story and  characters, and adults will certainly be amused by familiar voices and the  film's light sophistication. No doubt about it: ""Gay Purr-ee"" is  one to see and take pleasure in, for it is abundant in this charming  animated classic.",966729600,61,1540,5.133064516129032

7841143,4,6303212298,"RELEASED IN 1962 and directed by Abe Levitow, ""Gay Pur-ee"" is an animated film about a beautiful feline, Mewsette (voiced by Judy Garland), whose romantic fantasies about life in Paris become the awful truth when she stows away to travel there, but her dreams are shattered by a shady cat (Paul Frees) and his sister (Hermione Gingold). Meanwhile, a tomcat named Juane-Tom (Robert Goulet) goes to Paris to save Mewsette along with his lil pal, Robespierre (Red Buttons).

I suppose it helps if you're a cat-lover, but I always liked this cartoon flick. Sure, there are too many songs and only enough story to make up for half the runtime, but Gay Purr-ee has its charm. The climatic confrontation is particularly entertaining. Juane-Tom and Robespierre are the best characters. To be expected, several of the story elements reflect real-life, including a drunken binge (lol), but also money-loving smooth-talkers who take advantage of the nave and ignorant.

THE FILM RUNS 85 minutes. WRITERS: Dorothy Jones & Chuck Jones with additional dialogue by Ralph Wright & Levitow.
