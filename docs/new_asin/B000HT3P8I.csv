2642707,5,B000HT3P8I,"Deepak is at the forefront of the consciousness revolution.  His latest works are by far his best, and I think he is one of the most important media figures of our time.  This DVD integrates science and spirituality in a much needed way.  This is amongst the titles I wish I could download into the minds of every human on the planet.  Honoring the various religions while presenting quantum mechanics is a difficult task which Dr. Chopra and his family pull off with respect and taste.  Another pioneer of ""The Good Future"".  Check out Deepak's comic book line as well, Virgin comics.  Thanks Deepak!",1164240000,15,601,4.721153846153846

a special screening prior to it being released, and I must say...I was

Impressed with the wealth of knowledge that Deepak Chopra revealed, as well as the overall special effects, and production value.

Hat's off to Mr. Chopra for such an insightful, and powerful revelation

of this outstanding material. Everyone, regardless of their beliefs should

have the chance to exprience this thought provoking visual, with great music that appeal's to human beings (young, or more mature) it covers

I love Deepak, and loved 'The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success' more than this one - and while this does have some great information in it - it's not the experience or enlightening experience that I expected.
I do have to say I'm kind of sick of all of these 'talking heads' movies - it's all relatively the same information - but they lack a story, an experience, an adventure you can travel along with that often helps to give you that experiential learning, and transformation that a good spiritual movie should.
If you're wondering about knowing God, I love this movie, and this movie actually gave me an experience, like my body was vibrating inside in a way - and I felt like something was clearing or moving inside.  Was awesome - 'Spiritual Warriors'.  More about loving, peace and forgiveness, and the experience of God that I know is real for me :)",1267574400,,1011,5.345911949685535

2642738,4,B000HT3P8I,"I'm new to Deepak Chopra's theories and I have to admit that I'll probably have to watch this several times before I grasp everything Dr. Chopra was proposing.  While some concepts I was able to get instantly, others I felt like we were bouncing around at hyperspeed and I couldn't see what some ancient cultures had to do with another, but before I could process that we were off to some scientific anaology.  Through it all though, I wasn't bored.  Overall, viewers need to come with an open mind to watch this.",1188172800,,513,4.554347826086956
2642779,2,B000HT3P8I,"I am a big fan of Deepak Chopra's, and I have a number of his books and CDs. Having just read 'How to know God' and having enjoyed it very much, I ordered the DVD.

I was expecting either a recapitulation of the book's argument - which would have been fine; or some sort of elaboration of the material in the book for those fans who have read it, which would have been great too.

Unfortunately the DVD is neither, and it's hard to work out what it is trying to achieve. Even with a solid background on Chopra's work it was difficult to find any thread to follow in the presentation; it jumped randomly from statement to statement, with no discernable direction or connecting thread.

Only in the last 20 minutes or so did it seem to settle down with Chopra running through his explanation of the relationship of God to the Quantum world, which is always worth a hearing.

So my recommondation to interested Amazon-goers is to buy the book; it is fascinating and cheaper. Only the most devoted Chopra fans will feel that this 60 minute chiaroscuro is worth the money.",1187827200,15,1067,4.484536082474227
2642780,1,B000HT3P8I,"Hello,

I saw this film at the theater a few days ago and was very disappointed. I had hoped  ""How to Know God"" would be a good introduction to Chopra's thinking, which I want to learn more about. Instead, I found it very glitzy, full of his ego, quite dull, and containing very limited development of his ideas. His extended treatment of quantum theory is more appropriate to the elementary physics classroom. (I do have a degree in science, though.) I would suggest that his writings are probably of greater interest than this indulgence. I got very tired of repeated scenes of Las Vegas with terrible background music.",1181606400,10,621,4.7407407407407405

2642782,5,B000HT3P8I,"I've been following Dr. Chopra's teachings almost since the beginning, and have been aware of the constant deepening and refining of his message. In the past week I watched this DVD and listened to the CDs of his Book of Secrets. Between the two, I've experienced one epiphany after the other. I began my spiritual studies in the early 70s with the Tao of Physics. It feels like a 35-year gestation period to FINALLY ""get"" the message and translate it into my own life. Dr. Chopra has been my primary midwife. It's all in there...everything you need to know to start living life in peace, harmony, love and bliss. I cannot recommend this too highly. It is a challenging but ultimately totally explicable rendering of the story of life.",1179014400,8,735,4.705426356589148

Although I've read it all, this is one of Chopra's best. For real fun, get the book and the DVD -- and check them both out together.

2642786,5,B000HT3P8I,"""How to Know God"" is an enlightened, yet measureable, experience. We can already place it light years ahead of two recent additions to the dialogue on the nature of the universe. Consider, for a moment, the video for What the Bleep Do We Know?, an outright infomercial for JZ Knight's cult that extends the claims of science into the realm outright false testimony about what is known about our bodies and the universe. Throw it away. Replace the few minutes you will spend watching ""The Secret"" with Deepak Chopra's ""How to Know God"". ""The Secret"" claims that your desires will become manifest just because you desire them. As we know from many intellectual and spiritual traditions, desire creates suffering. Instead of expecting wealth in your life ""just cuz"", why not learn a little about the science of our universe and its parallels to ancient beleif systems? The outcome is startling.",1176595200,6,891,4.946666666666666

If you know basic science of atoms and space and are looking for a deeper understanding of how to find God or the meaning of life you should continue with other videos' of Chopra's.  After viewing other videos' of Chopra's like ""Deepak Chopra: The Essential DVD Collection"" I found this video very shallow, but I am a scientist so have a very good grasp of Quantum Physics, so my view may me skewed.  I learned much more from his other videos'.  You will also learn more from his videos' if you have tried some meditation and read some on eastern religions like Buddhism.  He obviously has a foundation in this but does not, which another writer complains of, describe these techniques for learning how to understand how to get to the places he talks about.",1173398400,10,888,4.630573248407643

I did't gain any new information in watching this and my focus was mainly on its production value and how uplifting it was (as claimed on the dvd jacket)

Unfortunately I didn't feel excited watching this or uplifted. The dvd just felt very monotone throughout and I realize it wasn't done on a large budget, but the graphic effects were mostly below par.

This dvd may be more ideal for introducing someone into eastern spirituality. If you want something uplifting I'd recommend 'The Secret'",1171670400,2,666,4.782608695652174
2642813,5,B000HT3P8I,"Deepak Chopra brings a new understanding to our concept of God and includes ideas from Quantum Physics in this playful, yet captivating journey into the mind of God. We find Deepak Chopra in Las Vegas, wandering around in a desert where it seems to be snowing and viewing a movie in a theatre of the universe.

His narration throughout encourages a merging of many ideas into a wider understanding of how the universe works. He journey's to Egypt and India to explore how these cultures viewed God and then he delves into Greek Mythology.

The idea of Christ is briefly mentioned through a visual reference and the idea of a God visualized as a ancient man with a beard is quickly discarded. The God Deepak Chopra speaks of is much more the God of the ""Universal Mind"" with creative powers who lives through us while we are here on earth. The only hint that this is the same God of the Bible comes in when there is a discussion a out God being the ""Word.""

""How to Know God"" brings more of an understanding to the compatibility of science and religion and in that regard it is very intriguing. From a historical viewpoint it is interesting to see how people throughout time have tried to communicate with God and how people in every country on the planet find some way to recognize God in various forms. The Theory of Everything mingles with ancient scriptures as Deepak Chopra walks along rivers, releasing prayers onto the water in the form of a candle set on a leaf.

Overall, this is a beautiful journey, although depending on your own religious beliefs, you will find common ground or find yourself resisting various thoughts. I think the overall message is healing and meaningful and this movie will be enjoyed by anyone who watched ""The Celestine Prophecy"" or ""What the Bleep Do We Know."" In fact, this is even more accessible and should please a wider audience because it remains very grounded in reality while addressing spiritual questions that have logical answers.

The visuals throughout are especially stunning with my favorite scenes being the Elvis impersonator in the Pink Cadillac. As he drives into the future, the colors behind the car change the scenery, so when you look in the rear view mirror the world is alive with beauty. Perhaps that is a subtle message and includes the idea that when we awaken to our true reality the world seems more beautiful.

Synchronicity is also addressed, and as a student of meaningful coincidence, I was of course amused when I finished watching this DVD, walked into the kitchen and noticed 11:11 on the stove clock. I haven't seen that number for what seems like weeks.

Onward, to The Secret...

2642814,5,B000HT3P8I,"""The whole universe is a quantum mirage winking in and out of existence millions of times per second. We are being created over and over again. Genesis didn't happen just once--it happens now."" - From the DVD

What is ""reality""? Who are we? What is our purpose here on Earth? Does God exist? If so, how do we interact with this Being?

Based on the book of the same know, How to Know God by Deepak Chopra finds this philosopher and physician playfully contemplating the intricate workings of the Universe and our role in it--as well as the nature of spirituality. Mining myths that crop up all around us--including the hotels of Las Vegas!--Chopra reminds us that gods, goddesses, and heroes teach a vital, central lesson: we are wondrous creatures who should be doing wondrous things.

Engaging and accessible, How to Know God takes viewers on a wild ride spanning the glitz and glamour of Las Vegas to a virtual golf course--all the way to Fermi Accelerator Lab and onto black holes and the Event Horizon. Chopra discusses the nature of time, the enormous ""emptiness"" at the atomic level, the importance of the ""mind"" when decoding chemical and electrical patterns (what we deem ""reality""), and the mirage of time and movement.

Chopra also discusses psychological and spiritual ideas such as synchronicity (a term coined by Jung indicating ""meaningful coincidences""), clairvoyance, miracles, and godhood. Here are a few gems from the How to Know God DVD:

* ""Infinite intelligence can't be crippled by such a tiny thing as disbelief. Both the secular and sacred are one.""
* ""A god is myself in disguise.""
* ""Time is just a cosmic convenience to keep everything from happening at once.""
* ""How can we not see Intelligence behind such precision as the Big Bang?""
* ""Eventually, you can only know what God is thinking by becoming God yourself.""
* ""Chaos is only an illusion. It's what you see when you can't see far enough.""
* ""God is our highest instinct to know ourselves.""

With a run-time of little over an hour, How to Know God is a surprisingly fun presentation. Instead of lecturing from a static studio or stage (what I expected), Chopra traipses around the globe amidst some truly beautiful surroundings with the addition of some quality visual effects. He doesn't seem to take himself all that seriously, using clever anecdotes and amusing visuals while providing the Cliff Notes version of quantum physics.

If you're not that familiar with quantum physics and the role it may play in spirituality, reality and psychic phenomena, How to Know God is a fine general introduction to whet your appetite. Chopra takes a potentially boring, mind-boggling subject and makes it understandable, entertaining, and relevant for seekers and skeptics alike.

I found the dvd enlightening as expected with a high production value.  He covered many ideas that have been introduced in such movies as ""What The Bleep...."" as well as ""The Secret"".  I was not disapointed.  In fact as I've shared it with many of my friends, they have ordered copies of their own.  It was informative, yet, not didactic.

The program is worth viewing. However as usual it pales compared to the book. There is lots of glitz, sound bites and half stated thoughts. If you read the book before hand or already have an innate understanding of the subject then this film makes a great supplement however it is not organized enough to get anyone off the ground and is no place to start or finish.

This presentation in its attempt to simplify and be entertaining will be misleading to those people that think watching this presentation will give them anymore than a superficial introduction.
