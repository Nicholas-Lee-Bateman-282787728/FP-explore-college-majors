I found the clothing, the European background, & the entire late 60s-early 70s 'thought-processes of the young' (wow!) thoroughly engaging!",1430265600,,306,5.531914893617022

8368750,2,B002F3C6NE,"I'm sorry, but I was extremely disappointed by this film.  The best that can be said about it is the location photography, beautifully mounted by the talented Douglas Slocombe, the lighting, the costuming, etc.  As for the story, I don't know about Janice Elliott's novel, but it borders on the sick, with the too-close relationship of the first cousins, France and Margaret, and the carelessness (reflecting the free-wheeing morals--or lack thereof--of the times) of the determination on the part of the protagonists to find lovers for each other as a solution to their guilt.  I couldn't believe the editor expected the viewer to absorb practically everything about the cousins' relationship even before the opening credits are finished!  As for the acting, it seems to me that only Jane Asher came off as having any depth of feeling.  Hywel Bennett as France is fascinating to watch, very unusually handsome face, but having about as much involvement as a wooden Indian.  Sven-Bertil Taube (who can be seen today as the elderly man who hires the detective to find his long-missing niece in the Swedish version of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"") plays Fred likeably, but completely lacking in charisma.  As for Leigh Taylor-Young, she is, in my opinion, one of the poorest American actresses of her decade, only able to secure roles because of her constant willingness to go topless at the drop of a hat.  (Ditto in the equally disgusting ""The Big Bounce,"" from 1969.)  The scene following the death of the baby and the nude dancing sequence is one of the most disturbing and degrading I've ever seen on a screen.  I simply cannot buy that a mother could dishonor her dead child in such a selfish way.  You call it grief?  I call it a total lack of regard for anything sacred, or moral degeneration, she never could have cared for the child if she carelessly let him out of her sight.  I was very shaken by the emptiness of the whole movie.  The result?  Just more emptiness.  Not one of the four characters matured an iota in a year's time, and each played a part in the impending disaster, with the bulk of the blame lying on Manny.  I was saddened, also, to see the talented Clive Revill in such a wasted role as the millionaire, not to mention miscasting.  What on earth did he see in this Manny person, who is revealed to be simply a slut and a troublemaker?  ""The Buttercup Chain"" is indeed unfrgettable, but I wish instead that it were.",1413072000,2,2448,4.690866510538641
8368751,3,B002F3C6NE,"In the early days I had a crush on Jane Asher but never seen a movie of her, so now a had the chance !",1396483200,,102,3.12
8368752,4,B002F3C6NE,"Don't be fooled by the ""Martini Movies"" logo that invites you to see this film as mere laughable camp. It's an intelligent, visually lush examination of a particular class of people, making the most of their particular place in time -- but it's far more than just a fine period piece, as it reveals the tragic flaw of beautiful, privileged, but ultimately hollow & immature young people unable to deal with the difficulties of growing up.

Cousins Franz & Margaret obviously share an unresolved sexual tension, which they studiously avoid by seeking out more appropriate lovers ... except that life doesn't always follow their carefully written script. Hywel Bennett & Jane Asher are superbly cast here, embodying the Beautiful People of late 1960s/early 1970s London -- shaped by & responding to the countercultural currents of the time, but solely on a superficial level. Leigh Taylor-Young (as carefree American drifter Manny) & Sven-Bertil Taube (as vacationing Swedish student Fred) complete the buttercup chain of flowers doomed to fade with summer's end.

Granted, the film is packaged & promoted as something like a soft-porn fantasy. Certainly it has the look, with its gorgeous cinematography & equally gorgeous naked bodies of both sexes. But the sexual element is treated naturally, with the focus more on the psychology of the four young lovers. And that psychology turns out to be more twisted & bittersweet than any of them might have imagined.

Of the four, Fred is the closest to maturity, while at the same time being the most naive -- he enjoys the hedonism of this lovely summer interlude, but knows that it can't be sustained, that they do have to grow up. As a result, he's the one most likely to be hurt, and hurt deeply. Manny is at the other end of the spectrum, unable to commit to anyone or anything for any length of time, terrified of responsibility, losing herself in a desperately impulsive life. This leads to tragedy, abetted by the facile cynicism of Franz, who appears to be the most worldly & jaded at first, but is finally revealed as the most needy & lost. But his somewhat more reticent cousin Margaret finds herself ready to face what he can't, accepting that the long holiday is over forever. And so they all go their own ways, some still searching, some still fleeing, unable to hold onto their now-tarnished idyll ...

And so must we move on as well.

Highly recommended!",1343520000,5,2414,4.86374695863747
8368753,4,B002F3C6NE,"And I don't mean that in a harsh way, it's just that all 4 of the principal characters have personality defects (don't we all?) that dramatically affect the outcome of their relationships and lives. The tale centers around 2 cousins born from identical twin mothers on the same day (not bro and sis as is listed in product details) and who grow up together and have a bond similiar to twins. When they are reunited after college, they are incapable of having normal relationships with others as a result of this attraction for one another. But they're determined to try, and now we're introduced to a kind Swede who loves the girl (played by Jane Asher, Paul McCartney's 60's girlfriend and sister to Peter Asher of Peter and Gordon fame) and Leigh Taylor-Young, an American freespirit who's taken up with the male cousin, but is attracted to the Swede as well. So now a game of musical chairs ensues amid the four, and the results are rather unpredictable. A great time period piece from 1970, it captures the elements of thought, fashion, lifestyle and naivete perfectly and is a fascinating watch for those who lived then or have an interest in that timeframe. I enjoyed it even though the chain was kinked...",1276214400,5,1212,4.721698113207547
