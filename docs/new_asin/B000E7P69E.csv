8324106,3,B000E7P69E,"By some reviewers, this movie was rated as the third worst movie ever made.  I don't agree.  It was just miss-cast.  The story is a little flimsy, but other elements are certainly no worse than is being produced as entertainment today.

The merchant fulfilling my order did so promptly, and as advertized.",1345420800,,305,4.8076923076923075
8324107,5,B000E7P69E,"Now who among us can say that we ever addressed our mothers as ""Yes, my mother,"" or ""no, my mother"" when talking to the lady? Who talks like that in a voice that sounds more like ""I'm looking at a tin star with drunk pinned on it""?

I had already developed enough sophistication to recognize warning bells go off when a local TV station announced a world premier of a John Wayne movie from 1956 would now be airing.  That was in the 80's so I figured the station probably didn't put this in the wrong can, but more like it was so bad, who would air it except a local New York station that had to cancel the episode of ""Growing your own cabbage"" on the ""Green Grocer Program."" It must have been on a dare or a bad roll of the dice, or the sick humor of someone at the station.

Well, my intuition was correct. This was bad. It was so bad, I think it was actually good, good enough that you could sit through it one time for its novelty, and then dust it off before you would ever see it again. When I heard the script I roared like a monkey that just discovered he had been sitting on a crate full of bananas. You could see John Wayne actually look Mongolian without being a Flying Tiger. This fellow was so typecast in my mind, I almost expected him to brandish a six shooter from under his flowing robe or a derringer from under his pointy helmet and say; ""Holy Gobi, I wish you'd go for it. I wish you would, uh-h'uh, uh-h'uh!

This DVD would make a wonderfully sick joke for that person you buy a gift for at the office Christmas Party while maintaining your anonymity. You will have the pleasure of knowing that you are possibly inflicting hours of torture, or you could just keep a copy for yourself in the delusion that this will be rare treasure someday.

This makes me want to get on a fast ship going in harm's way or on Old Dollar, or on a Safari to Hatari, or North to Alaska.

I'm warning ya, Pilgrim, stand back and ya won't get hurt!",1335830400,2,1947,4.164893617021277
8324108,4,B000E7P69E,"This is the most unintentionable comedy in the JW arsenal.
An expected performance by Wayne and an emotional performance by Hayward
can only add to the spectacle. The sad legacy is truly tragic, but
the location only makes this film more betterer.",1282521600,,247,4.904761904761905
