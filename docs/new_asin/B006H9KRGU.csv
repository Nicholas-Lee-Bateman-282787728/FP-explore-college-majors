Conventional wisdom might say that a young man with astounding good looks, industry connections, and not a little ability would have a very smooth career. Not so with Hrithik Roshan, after causing a mass hysteria comparable to the second coming of Elvis or the Beatles things took a downturn for quite a while. Aside from the mega-hit&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kabhi-Khushi-Kabhie-Gham/dp/B0016GOMZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham</a>&nbsp;most of his movies were commercially, and critically, underwhelming. This includes my much beloved,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Na-Tum-Jaano-Na-Hum/dp/B000IZJRJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Na Tum Jaano Na Hum</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mujhse-Dosti-Karoge/dp/B00009PAC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mujhse Dosti Karoge</a>&nbsp;they were flops. To be fair, very few people said Mr. Roshan himself was the major problem. In fact, he was praised and awarded for his role in the mess that is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fiza-2000-Hrithik-Roshan-Hindi-Film-Bollywood-Movie-Indian-Cinema-DVD/dp/B004UR1VFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fiza (2000) (Hrithik Roshan / Hindi Film / Bollywood Movie / Indian Cinema DVD)</a>&nbsp;and other projects that never took off. Still, show business and human nature being what it is, he needed a bang. He needed several bangs!

The first major bang came in the form of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Koi-Mil-Gaya/dp/B0001EQI8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Koi...Mil Gaya</a>&nbsp;and the character of Rohit. Now I *have not* seen the Krrish saga yet! I'm waiting until they release Krrish 3 out on DVD, because it releases in theaters this November and I'm excited enough to want to see all three in a triple feature. Yeah... Pathetic I know! Anyway Koi... Mil Gaya put Mr. Roshan back on top with a super-hit and reminded most Negative Nellies why he created mass hysteria to begin with. Now, he needed to hammer home the point that he could do something completely different. Enter a childhood BFF with a major idea...

I am so glad I'm not born into a Filmi family! God the pressure! Imagine, your dad is an outstanding screen writer, poet, lyricist, occasional actor, knows a thing or two about directing, and is one of the most powerful names in the business. Now imagine your twin sister has ambitions to create a storm in Bollywood as a writer and director, and nothing is going to stop her! Now imagine you're a fun loving guy, dropped out of college with absolutely no clue what to do with yourself! Well, for two years Farhan Akhtar found himself in such a state. Finally, he decided I truly love movies. Well, once he found his Lakshya, he like the protagonist in his film, became unstoppable! His first film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dil-chahta-hai/dp/B0016GOM0Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dil chahta hai</a>&nbsp;became a super-hit WITH GOOD REASON! He proved he'd inherited his father's amazing gift with words, a modern approach to films that still respects tradition, and propelled the cause of function and form into Hindi cinema with dynamic commercial success. For his follow up, dad mentioned an old idea that he'd written a long time back. A screenplay that closely resembled the aimless period in his life with a twist. So of course he had to get in on the action!

As much as I adore, Hrithik Roshan (go ahead roll your eyes, I am) this isn't his movie. It's Farhan Akhtar's movie. His period without a lakshya, ensures the movie's first half isn't treated as a trivial comedy. In truth it's a quiet tragedy. Karan, is an intelligent, caring, good-hearted, young man who knows he should be doing SOMETHING with his life but is so lost he's become everything but apathetic. His family is certainly no help merely saying ""he's a good-for-nothing"" or ""why can't you be like your older brother Udesh?"" His girlfriend's well-meaning family compounds the problem by admonishing ""Whatever you do, do your best, or don't do it at all."" But all the criticism and encouragement doesn't address the real issue, Karan's inability to choose a lakshya.

It's one thing to write brilliant words, which Javed Akhtar certainly does. Even without a proper knowledge of Hindi and reliance on subtitles, one can hear how well the words are chosen. It's another thing to have a brilliant cast, which is certainly the case here. Names like Bachchan, Roshan, Zinta, and Puri, are nothing to sneeze at. Still another to have the ambition to tell a story which inspires such heated passions about one of the most dangerous conflicts on earth. But the main thing is even with all these elements, if the Director can't put his vision on the screen, the movie will fail. Farhan Akhtar, is not a guy I'd ever bet against. Director, Producer, Musician, Singer, Actor, Writer, Poet, Activist, Husband, Father, Athlete, and Daredevil! My only question is when does the man sleep? Without his brilliance, and dedication this movie could have failed artistically. This isn't a film that could be treated as an old school Bollywood production. I think maybe that's why commercially, it did respectable but not huge business.

But then, I don't believe money was ever the Lakshya here. I think it does something more important, reminds everyone that the people involved are not mere Glamorous Heroes and Heroines, looking for yet another Super-hit. These are people of substance, striving not only for artistic and commercial success but are also people with important things to say about life but also controversial and painful events.

Now I must confess something, I know next to nothing about India's boarder conflicts and the insanely complex and dangerous relationship between India and Pakistan. I only know that the boarders of India are some of the most dangerous on earth and definitely not on my list of dream vacation destinations (although Goa, and Agra are there). Intellectually, I'm not so nave to think this movie's political themes are unbiased. I wouldn't expect a neutral US movie about WW2. But I must say I did like the fact that the script went out of it's way to avoid demonizing every citizen of Pakistan, and avoided the idea of, ""Well, they started it so anything they give us, we'll just do the same to them."" Mr. Bachchan had a brilliant scene keeping perspective. So while I'd never say a movie like this tells the entire story. I appreciate the respectful attitude with which the story is told.

Performances: Amitji, for such a tiny role in an incredibly long and action packed film, the man knows how to make his presence felt without overshadowing the cast or the story. Such a thing is not easy, it takes humility, talent, guts, and dedication to the film as a whole. It's one of the many, many, many, reasons I admire Mr. Bachchan. He goes beyond celebrity and prestige, for him craft and professionalism is the ultimate achievement. His character, Col. Sunil Damle has the gravitas of command and deep compassion for his men. I think the thing that struck the most was the true sincerity and genuineness of his performance. I really believed in his feelings and his principles as a soldier and a man. Again since it is such a tiny role in such a huge film the credit has to go to the amazing talent and intelligence of Mr. Bachchan himself.

Om Pri, Mr. Puri might be my second favorite character in the entire film. Again it's such a tiny role but the impact left me amazed and eager for more. I don't know much about him other than what I saw in the amazing special features. What I saw also impressed upon me the intelligence, and sensitivity of this brilliant man made him the perfect choice for the character of Subedar Maj. Pritam Singh. This gentle, wise, war elephant provides compelling philosophy, wonderful wit, deep compassion, and is the unofficial Guru to all; even the Commissioned Officers above him. It's a brilliant highlight.

Preity Zinta, is one of the few actresses in Hindi films that has cornered the market on Sass! I think that it must have been cathartic to play a true feminist after her role for Mr. Akhtar in Dil Chahta Hai. Where Shalini was subdued and silent, Romi is outspoken, a take charge get-out-of-my-way, I-won't-shut-up, or-submit-to-any-man's-orders, type of girl. Quite frankly, it's a better than passing resemblance to the actress herself. But for all that bravado and moxie, Romi is also kind, sensitive, values respect, and gives it to others, even people who tell her she should shut up. While she is ambitious and determined, she's not about to get ahead by profiting from others dark moments. She's too honest and has far too much integrity for cheap tricks. That said, I wanted to smack her when she and Karan quarrel! Okay YES she was right, and if I were her I'd be pretty pissed off myself, but there's a little thing called over-kill! Jeeze it's not like he cheated or smacked her, everything else is workable. But Romi had her own growing up to do, and Ms. Zinta played the part well.

I don't think she and Mr. Roshan had major romantic sparks here. They certainly had a lot affection and a deep sense of caring. The genuine grief they both portrayed when they regret where their romance ended up was brilliantly done. That said, I just didn't get the feeling that they were passionate young lovers. It's like they skipped the youthful madness and got to the 50 year mark. Which of course is genuine love, but when you're playing characters just entering their mid-twenties, I think a little madness is needed. Normally, I rant at how sexual chemistry is too elevated in films, but in this case, it needed just a touch more.

The amazing cast of actors who played cadets, soldiers, and officers, Far too numerous to name them all and evaluate so I'll just say this: Every one of them touched me deeply. I mourned the ones who die, and cheered for the ones who lived. And to the idiot girl who ditched a sweetie, I hope she was miserable the rest of her selfish life!

Parents, Bonman Irnai as Karan's father is stunning in his role. I absolutely loathed his inability to see that Karan's aimlessness was not only due to youth and inaction, but also because of being told constantly that he wasn't worth the trouble. If you tell someone they're incapable of being productive, and worthless they become just that! That said, in the second half I cry at the beauty of the scene where father and son finally forgive, forget, and accept each other for who they are. Karan's mother, (I can't find her name) did a credible job being sympathetic yet ultimately loyal to her husband.

Romi's parents, (can't find their names either) roles are small, but their main impact shows very clearly how Romi came to be who she is. So I think that the underlying message about a parent's impact on their child positive or negative is powerful, and brilliantly done.

Music and Dance, I'll be honest I've seen and loved many soundtracks by the composers Shankar, Loy, and Ehsaan, but in no way is this there best work. Compared to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zindagi-Na-Milegi-Dobara-2011-Hindi-Movie-Bollywood-Film-Indian-Cinema-DVD-English-Subtitles/dp/B005DJDF2I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011) (Hindi Movie / Bollywood Film / Indian Cinema DVD) - English Subtitles</a>&nbsp;and the exquisite Rock On! It's nearly substandard! However, it does have one extremely special song, ""Agar Main Kahoon"" is just what my romantic's heart craves in a love song! Added Bonus: Farhan Akhtar does the vocals! ""Kandhon Se Milte Hain Kandhe"" is a beautiful and rousing patriotic number, beautifully filmed, with a sound that almost brings to mind a choir rather than a movie chorus.

As a song, ""Main Aisa Kyun Hoon"" leaves me cold, it's just too funky for my taste. HOWEVER, it just might be one of Hrithik Roshan's most amazing dance numbers ever filmed. If you look to the title of this review you'll understand why after seeing the film. When I watch it, I cringe. Mr. Roshan as always, is hypnotizing in his grace and perfection. But the number looks incredibly painful! I think to myself ""God, I hope he has a Jacuzzi at home."" The fact that nine years, two slipped disks, and one son later he can STILL do those moves (see Filmfare awards 2013 on youtube) scares the bejeebers out of me!

""Kitni Baatein"" is a heartbreaking song about heartbreak, (I know I should stop with the jokes) the melody is haunting, but predictable. The real triumph in this song is both Mr. Roshan and Ms. Zinta's amazing expressions during their performances. They made me sniffle a bit.

DVD Content and quality, on the first disc, Film and sound quality excellent! Easy access to songs and scenes. Second disc, Special features: The making of the film, BRILLIANT! In English, and really cool. One thing though, while people seem to me more than willing to be exceptionally boisterous in their mother-tongue, in English they whisper. Turn your TV up loud, this isn't a technical problem, they're just shy! The only one who looked comfortable with only using English was Mr. Roshan. I'm not sure why, they all speak it better than anyone I know, including me! Also there are deleted scenes, alas no subtitles. But I think if you watch enough Bollywood a little starts to rub off. I got the general idea. Then they filmed the Making of ""Main Aisa Kyun Hoon"" and let's just say that it's not only the Heroes in films that can dance, the crew is more than capable of being called into action if needed! There's also trailers, song promos, photos from the set, and music videos! All great fun.

One thing that I am angry about is that in the product description it said a special booklet was included in the package. HELLO I DIDN'T GET MY BOOKLET! Still, I'm happy with it. See this movie, Mr. Rakesh Roshan's little boy is a whole lot more than flash over substance.",1362700800,2,14312,5.16695427092321
