The stories miss the freshness and positive humor the ones in  'boys life (1)' have. We would NOT buy it again. The high price is not  justified.,930960000,,300,4.4363636363636365

(USA - 1998)

Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

BOYS LIFE: THREE STORIES OF LOVE, LUST, AND LIBERATION (1995) was an interesting - though blandly filmed - trio of stories which explored the pleasures and pitfalls of coming out. Though not without problems of its own, BOYS LIFE 2 represents a broadening of narrative horizons, with four short films that explore different facets of the gay experience.

MUST BE THE MUSIC (USA - 1996) is Nickolas Perry's take  on the lives of four young friends (three gay, one ostensibly straight)  who's visit to an LA nightclub reveals an array of barely-suppressed emotions. The tone is raucous and hard-edged, but the film comes to an abrupt ending long before the characters have been fully established or their situations resolved. Aspect ratio: 1.85:1.

Tom DeCerchio's NUNZIO'S SECOND COUSIN (USA - 1994) is the ace in the pack, a superb vignette in which a potentially lethal gay-bashing is turned completely around when one of the intended victims turns out to be a gun-wielding cop who seems to recognise  something ambiguous about the motives of one of his attackers. By turns hilarious and frightening, the film revels in its contradictions (ie. the warm-hearted gay man with an explosive temper; the sweet old guy who turns out to be an ignorant racist; the handsome young thug who isn't what he seems, etc.) whilst offering viewers a wish-fulfillment assault on small-minded bigots everywhere. Vincent D'Onofrio (the cop), Eileen Brennan (his dotty mom), and the gorgeous Miles Perlich (the thug) topline this small gem of a movie, and they each play their roles to perfection. Aspect ratio: 1.85:1.

Mark Christopher directs the much-praised ALKALI, IOWA (USA - 1995), the tale of a young gay farmer who literally unearths the secrets of his long dead father and immediately upsets the deceptive tranquility of his deeply troubled family. Beautifully photographed, the film generates an authentic sense of landscape and mystery, but the ambitious narrative is defeated by a patently inadequate running time (17 minutes). Aspect ratio: 1.37:1.

Finally, Tom Donaghy's THE DADSHUTTLE (USA - 1994) records the conversation between a young man and his doting father during a short car journey which culminates in a tragic revelation. Deliberately uncinematic, this is basically an actor's  piece, nicely underplayed by Matt McGrath (son)and Peter Maloney (father), but the dialogue is slightly too theatrical at times and the confined staging limits the film's emotional impact. Aspect ratio: 1.37:1.

Viewers should be aware that the original US DVD version of BOYS LIFE 2 (this title doesn't appear anywhere on the print itself) differs from the original theatrical release, which offered Peggy  Rajski's Oscar-winning short TREVOR (1995) instead of THE DADSHUTTLE. This is possibly due to copyright wrangles over the Diana Ross songs which figure heavily in Rajski's film.

Followed by BOYS LIFE 3 (2000).",954028800,14,2962,5.261146496815287
1006606,4,6305292981,"In 3 of these 4 shorts, homophobia lurks. All 4 are artistic, from minimal-realistic to episodic. MUST BE THE MUSIC: It's only four young teen guys going clubbing one night, scrappy and bopping. Business as usual with  young males, but these prowlers are all gay--showing we're ""different  and the same."" SECOND COUSIN: the tables turned, a New York cop makes  a gay-basher come home for dinner at mother's. The subtlety? Residual  internalized homophobia. ALKALI, IA: The film's jolty uneven flashback  style well suits its subject, a farm boy discovering his father was gay,  and his family is still anti-gay. But the best is THE DADSHUTTLE.  Apparently only the conversation between guy and dad in a car drive,  actually it's artistic genius, re-creating (not just reporting) son's  attempt to communicate, father's non-intended awkwardness. Bravo.",947030400,16,851,5.338345864661654
1006607,4,6305292981,"Sure TREVOR has its own video release, but I really prefer viewing it with MUST BE THE MUSIC, ALKALI (from the director of 54) and NUNZIO'S SECOND COUSIN.  As seen in theaters, TREVOR rounded out the multi-generational aspect of the program.  Seen that way, we were shown the experiences of various characters from pre-teen to middle aged. I don't want to knock THE DADSHUTTLE (included in this DVD release in place of TREVOR) for it is a well performed piece and worthy of a look. I must thank IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT for releasing this DVD in the first place!  MUSIC and NUNZIO'S are both presented letterboxed in their original cinema format.  ALKALI, filmed in 16mm is presented full frame.  As usual, Image's quality is great and the picture and sound quality runs circles around the previous VHS release.  The reds and flashing lights of MUSIC's club sequences don't look as fuzzy and those colors don't bleed into each other as in the VHS version. The sound is much more audible as well. ...

7887136,5,6305292981,"I couldn't believe it when I got ready to do this and saw NO other five-star reviews! Am I THAT peculiar? This is one of the best collections of short films I've ever seen, in any genre.

The first film on this DVD, about the clubbing teens, is pretty trite, except for Milo Ventimiglia and the ending. It's the only one of the four that's a typical (but not bad) ""gay"" movie. The last three films are unusual, each in its own way, and they're all outstanding.

Matt McGrath's performance as the son in DadShuttle is some of the most beautiful acting I've ever seen anywhere, speaking words so realistic and unmovielike that they'd have sounded pretentious spoken by anybody else. Coming from him they're sublime and profoundly moving. (Only mediocre actors become big stars. The truly great ones, like McGrath, never do. It's crazy.) I'm glad&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trevor/dp/B00007K027/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trevor</a>&nbsp;was taken out of this collection and issued separately. If it hadn't been, I'd never have seen DadShuttle.

Alkali, Iowa feels like great literature presented with lovely restraint and grace. I liked it a lot. The real surprise in this set, though, is Vincent D'Onofrio and Eileen Brennan in the hilarious dark comedy about a tough gay Italian cop and his mother. Every second of that film is pure delight.

This collection is much better than the first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boys-Life/dp/B00000JWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boys Life</a>&nbsp;(I'm watching the series in order), which surprised me because reviews trend the opposite way. Maybe it's because the three great films in this set are about and for adults, more intelligent and creative than most. They don't fit too comfortably under the ""boys"" banner, though. It'll be interesting to see how the rest of the series plays out.",1242864000,,1926,5.653979238754325

7887138,2,6305292981,"Of the four shorts on this DVD, only one Alkali, Iowa, is worth seeing. The other three have none of the emotional resonance of the three short stories of the first Boys Life trilogy. The acting in Must Be The Music was pathetic and the story almost non-existent. Nunzio's Second Cousin also lacked a purpose, and The DadShuttle was simply annoying. Rent this to see Alkali, Iowa but I wouldn't recommend wasting money buying it. I was disappointed.",1042156800,2,449,4.769230769230769
7887139,4,6305292981,"None of the 4 shorts on display are bad, but MUST BE THE MUSIC isn't very inspired, just 4 teenagers out clubbing and that's it. THE DADSHUTTLE is OK, featuring a conversation about mundane things between a father and son. Lots of words left unspoken there. Too long, though.
The standouts are ALKALI, IOWA, a novelettish subject worthy of Checkov given subtle treatment by Mark Christopher. NUNZIO'S SECOND COUSIN is an actor's dream, Vincent D'Onofrio hamming it up something wonderful as a gay Chicago cop out cruising, being harassed by gaybashers. Eileen Brennan as his chatty Italian mama
has a jolly old time, as well.
This is worth buying, for ALKALI, IOWA alone.",1038960000,2,671,4.946902654867257
7887140,2,6305292981,"I had a real tough time understand these short films. The difficulty I had was understand why they were made. There was really no point to them. I'll start with ""Must Be the Music."" Some friends go to a club. One friend ends up getting the pager number to one guy he meets there. The end. Did I miss something? Is that supposed to be entertaining? Next is ""Nunzio's Second Cousin."" Two gay men walk out of a club. A bunch of guys plan on gay bashing them. One of the gay guys pulls out a gun and threatens to shoot them all. He lets them all go except one. He invites him over to have dinner with his mother. After dinner, the gay guy forces the boy to kiss him and then pushes him down on the ground. The end. Is the point of this to teach a lesson to a gay basher? Why have dinner with him? It's stupid. And the acting of the gay guy is horrible. He is just obnoxious. Next is ""Alkali, Iowa."" A gay boy finds out his dead father was gay. The end. Last, and my favorite, is ""The Dadshuttle."" There's not much that goes on here except a rather long and hard to follow conversation between a father and son. The son is gay and I think he has HIV. The father doesn't want to talk about it so he just rambles on about pointless things. He's funny though. After it was all over I let out a big yawn and took a nap. I'm glad I only rented this.",1019952000,3,1339,4.0

Oh well, they were good, I'm greedy I guess. I bought 1 too, so I need to sit down and watch it too.",1007683200,3,393,3.9873417721518987
