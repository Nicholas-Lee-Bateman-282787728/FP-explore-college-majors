5865485,5,B00DY64A3U,"It's nice to see someone come up with a new concept for a movie, since so many plots have been reworked over the years.  The story line is pretty coherent in that it looks like something that could really happen. The director does a great job of getting you into the movie with the actors, who are believeable in their roles. The dialogue isn't stupid or cheesy like in some movies. The best part is that the movie has just the right mix of action, drama, and emotion - mostly action. Many movies depend on emotion and drama to carry the movie, but Gravity is pretty straightforward in that it concentrates on the story, which keeps the movie moving.

I promise you won't be bored, never a dull moment. A really excellent film!",1380844800,4,727,4.458646616541353
5865486,5,B00DY64A3U,"Gravity is without a doubt one of the single most impressive space films ever made. Alfonso Cuarn's skills as a writer and director are used to their fullest. Not since the likes of ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" or ""Apollo 13"" has any film taken us into the cold quiet reaches of space quite like this and stranded us there with such insurmountable odds of survival.",1380844800,5,359,4.538461538461538
5865487,5,B00DY64A3U,"No sound in space. They did it right. GRAVITY is one of the best space films ever made. It seems so realistic, far beyond anything done in that regard. I found it to be thoroughly captivating to the point where I was so immersed in this film that I felt like I was really in space. I have not had that experience ever since I saw 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY way back in 1968 in the theater. GRAVITY really is an amazing film. For me the realism, the technical aspects really drive the narrative. They almost are the narrative. I can't say enough about GRAVITY.",1380844800,5,554,4.285714285714286
5865488,5,B00DY64A3U,"Every now and again, there comes a film that shakes things up. It is called ground breaking, monumental and the film that everyone should see. So what  film has the privilege of gaining such praise? Why that would be Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity. The man behind films like Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban and Children of Men not only helms Gravity, but he also produced and co-wrote this space thriller. When the movie made its way to Festival circuits, viewers were awed. For months now, Gravity has had nothing but praised from the likes of critics and filmmakers. That kind of one sided critiquing is something that catches my eye. So was Gravity truly a masterpiece? Masterpiece may not be the best term for this film; but more or less.

The story of Gravity is quite simple. If you have seen the trailers or tv spots, then that's all you need to know about the plot. However, if you missed any of the film's advertisement, allow me to indulge you:  Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) finds herself in a heap of trouble after an accident above Earth's orbit leaves her stranded in space.

With no build up, Gravity throws you right into the thick of things. In the first ten minutes, the satellite is destroyed and Sandra Bullock finds herself adrift in space. Normally, I would be bothered by such a thing; but in case of Gravity, it works. While I believe there are some themes in the film, they are used with a subtly and don't play a major role in the overall plot. When it comes down to it,  Gravity has a thrilling story from start to finish; and it certainly works in the film's favor.

It's never easy to carry the stage by yourself, but Sandra Bullock showed that she can in this thriller. While this technically a two-man show, the perspective is center on Bullock's character and she does all the work. If Sandra is not at least nominated for Best Actress for the upcoming Oscars, I will be surprised. Why? Well it is one thing to play a strong character; it is another to play a strong character in a different environment, and that is exactly what Sandra Bullock does.  Don't worry, I'm not leaving out George Clooney. While I'm not biggest Clooney fan and I felt that George was being George, his role as Matt Kowalski was great for a supporting character. Still, at the end of the day, I have to take my hat off to Sandra Bullock.

There is no other way to put this: Gravity has to be one the most technically sound films I have ever seen. Cuaron's use of camerawork was awe inspiring. Where we are so use to a clip to clip format in movies, Gravity used longer cuts and showed so much in each sequence. The first person shots were used so well, it could make a some First Person Shooters jealous. There was some Questionable CG, but it didn't hurt the overall film. What certainly help the film were the visuals. Gravity had some of the best shots of Earth I have ever seen captured on the silver screen.

Then there is the film's 3D. Alright, I will be the first to admit that I'm not the biggest fan of 3D. If you can, i suggest seeing a movie in your standard 2D.  However, Gravity has my stamp of approval of being a must see  in 3D. The film used the effect to best of its abilites; from having things fly in your face to just seeing things stand out.  Gravity's 3D is worth every penny.

If I had to pick which scene was my favorite, it would have to be the destruction of the space station. The sequence was thrilling and the both the camera and the 3D made the destruction of the ISS that more impressive. The only scene I thought was weak was when Ryan is speaking to the farmer. I found scene hard to follow; though I did understand why it was there.

The title above says it all: Gravity is a definition of a movie experience. Sure the movie may not have the most solid of stories; but everything in this film works. This is a must see in theaters; and if you can, check it out in IMAX. My hat goes off to everyone apart of this project as Gravity is one best movie of the year.

5865489,4,B00DY64A3U,"WOW!  Finally a Clooney movie that didn't stink! And as usual, another hit for Sandra Bullock.

I did NOT see it in 3D, but I imagine it would be incredible to see that way -- it was pretty incredible in non-3D. Really nice visuals!

I have to say I was on the edge of my seat (figuratively speaking) throughout this movie, and practically holding my breath the whole time.  Space is a very scary place! One thing though, I have to admit I was getting a little nauseous because of all the spinning around they do (so if you get that way on amusement rides easily, you might want to wait until AFTER the movie to eat!)

It must've been done largely with green screen because while I was riveted I was at the same time wondering how the heck they could've filmed this.

My husband only gives it a ""C"" grade because he thought it was ""predictable"". Maybe it was, but I confess to being surprised at least once or twice.",1380844800,5,916,4.296511627906977
5865490,3,B00DY64A3U,"In space, no one can hear you scream... or your last gasp.

On the final space shuttle mission headed by astronaut Matt Kowalski (Clooney), Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock) is brought along to install a new type of software she designed.  Disaster strikes when the team is endangered by debris from an 'accidentally destroyed' Russian satellite.  The wreckage also damages other satellites in its path, disrupting communications.  Stone becomes separated from the now-destroyed shuttle, and the race is on both to find her and get to the safety of a nearby space station before the next orbit brings the fast-moving debris back around again.

The cinematography is, without question, amazingly beautiful.  Photos of deep space always illicit a thrill in us earthbound mortals, and this one's no different.  Some of the visuals and creative imagery, such as reflections on the astronauts' visors and the views of Earth from low orbit and Bullock spinning uncontrollably in space, will absolutely grab you.  There's also sub-text of being born again- with Bullock being framed in some shots as if she's in utero, complete with a loose cable symbolizing an umbilical cord, and her new life when she finally returns to earth, readjusting to gravity.

This is a brilliant concept, and it only takes two (three if you count Ed Harris' voice only performance as Mission Control) to pull it off.  Clooney as Kowalski is a great supporting character- a consummate professional, cool under pressure, knowledgeable of the situation and a storehouse of personal anecdotes which he'll happily regale you with.  Bullock's Stone is the complete opposite- quiet, withdrawn and nervous.  We get to see the wonders and terrors of space from her perspective, and it mostly works.

The problem is two-fold: one is Bullock's character.  She's intelligent and moderately resourceful, but also extremely high-strung and prone to panic attacks- exactly the kind of person that would not be sent into space.  After enduring the third instance of her going OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG in ten minutes, I wanted her to die already so we could get back to Clooney.

Second: because of her character's flaws, the script has to be dumbed down to accommodate them.  Kowalski rescues her and hauls her back to the space station via tether, but somehow keeps her TALKING, so she's continually using the oxygen she's running low on!  No reason for this other than to set up the no-more-oxygen-get-inside-quick-before-you-die scene, since he could've simply kept up the chatter himself and let her relax... and save her air. Upon reaching the International Space Station, their inertia makes them collide with it; Stone gets her foot tangled in wires, barely hanging on but manages to snag Kowalski's tether before he spins away, his momentum pulling them away from the ISS.  Here all Kowalski had to do was pull himself forward and let his new inertia carry him back towards the ISS, saving them both, but again...  Once she's returned to relative safety aboard the ISS, she completely misses a small fire starting in an alcove- that she literally went right past and couldn't have missed, except the script called for her to- so our next crisis is ready to go.

Gravity is one of those movies that was a great idea, and delivers for the most part but falls short in key areas for trying to stretch out the tension.  Not that it's a bad idea, but they just did it in the wrong ways.",1380844800,22,3430,4.970227670753065
5865491,4,B00DY64A3U,"While space adventures like Star Wars and Star Trek are and always will be the epic space dramas that dreams are made of, filmmakers really haven't spent enough time on ""down-to-earth"" pictures that depict humanity's current explorations in space.  Humanity's story began with small-scale satellite-building stories on the outskirts of the Earth and minor, yet important trips to the moon.  However, rarely do space adventures hit the big screen without an asteroid plummeting towards Earth, aliens launching invasions, or at least someone having a close encounter - most likely of the third kind.  Realistic films about space exploration have been few and far between, the most memorable of which came in 1995's Academy Award nominated drama, Apollo 13.  Since then, space has basically been treated like a hostile villain, portrayed as the setting of chaos and conflict - much as it is in the already highly praised space drama, Gravity.

Directed by Alfonso Cuarn (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Great Expectations), Gravity stars Sandra Bullock as Dr. Ryan Stone, an engineer on her first outer space mission.  Her commander, Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), is overseeing his last mission as his team orbits the Earth when Mission Control suddenly aborts the mission as satellite debris is quickly confirmed to be on a collision course with the team's location.  Unfortunately, the team is unable to defend themselves and the debris massively damages their shuttle and equipment, also thrusting the pair into space.  Running low on air and with only limited opinions, Stone and Kowalski are forced to use what means they have left to attempt to make their way to a distant orbiting space station in hopes of using an escape pod to return to Earth.  The voices of Ed Harris, Paul Sharma, and Basher Savage also star in supporting roles.

For all of this film's achievements (and we'll get to them), Gravity is still far from the perfect film that many make it out to be.  At the end of the day, the film's story is the only substantial hang-up.  You can sit and marvel at how this film looks, praise the acting, and even embrace the idea of coughing up extra money to see the film in IMAX 3D - but, the end result and the overall impact of the film simply doesn't get the job done.  Maybe it's just me (and that's very possible), but this film leaves a gaping void of borderline irrelevance and eventual unimportance.  The story doesn't provide a knockout punch that an Academy Award winner should deliver.  Gravity goes through a motion of floating from one dire straight to the next, easily making it understandable as to why this film only goes on for only a brief 90 minutes.  There are only so many different places you can float to in outer space before the question of whether or not these characters live or die needs to be answered.  The climax of this flick is foreseeable, and easily forgettable.

We can now move on to the film's outstanding achievements - and there are many.  By now, you might have heard that Sandra Bullock wasn't the first choice to play Dr. Ryan Stone.  Actually, she wasn't even the second, third, or fourth choice.  However, director and co-writer Alfonso Cuarn should be thanking his lucky stars (no pun intended) that he landed this A-list actress.  Most actors/actresses will tell you that acting on screen alone, without anyone else in the conversation is a complex, often taxing endeavor.  Fortunately for everyone (viewers included), Bullock does a phenomenally job working through her character's various, heart-wrenching emotional states.  Her character is full of fear from even the very beginning, but manages to face down each dire scenario, refusing to be fully engulfed by the constant fear of potential doom.

While Bullock is the domineering presence in this film, Clooney spends his limited presence portraying a character that's completely opposite in nearly every possible way.  He's cool, calm, and collected - even after a debris storm reduces the duo's likelihood of surviving to nearly nothing.  Clooney brings to the table everything we've all grown to love about the charismatic gentlemen, full of whit and poise.  Combined, the efforts of Bullock and Clooney make for an unstoppable force of chemistry, and by the time the film concludes, it will be incredibly difficult to imagine any other actors or actresses in these two well-written roles.

Without a doubt, Gravity is a beautifully visual film, providing a mesmerizing view of Earth from our planet's orbit.  In fact, it's so beautiful that it might be hard to get past the fact that it's actually CGI.  Sure, the film might be a bit CGI heavy at times, which will be abundantly evident in some portions of the film more than others, but for the most part it provides for an absolutely flawless experience - sparing no expense, I'm sure.  The eye-catching realism is quite breathtaking, often so convincing that you'll nearly forget you're watching a movie.  During the thrilling action sequences, don't be surprised when you find yourself lost in the moment, easily becoming engulfed in the array of panic that would likely leave most of us screaming in pure horror.  In other words, you'll be happy to be in a theater watching the events of this film, rather than in outer space dealing with the unimaginable living-changing experiences capture over the course of this film.

Overall, Gravity is going to be all the rage at the box office and understandably so - yet at the end of the day, it's not as epic as the spectacular space drama, Apollo 13.  The hype has been built so high for Gravity that not even the Earth's atmosphere could hold it down - but after the film levels off a bit, hopefully viewers will come to terms with the fact that Gravity is simply a forgettable piece of filmmaking.  That doesn't mean you should discount the experience of this film (which everyone should witness at least once), but this film is limited by a simple story and visual effects (in all their glory) that some filmmaker will no doubt elapse in the near future.  Sandra Bullock (and likely the film's visual achievements) will garner quite a bit of attention during award season, but ultimately there's very little that sets her performance ahead of an unmemorable role that parallels Tom Hanks in Cast Away.  In the end, Gravity provides outstanding, yet brief cinematic enjoyment, although I fear this film will eventually crash land in the ""good, but forgettable"" category of film.

5865492,4,B00DY64A3U,"""Gravity"" is the first film from Mexican director Alfonso Cuarn in six long years. His last film, ""Children of Men,"" was also a critically acclaimed science fiction film that impressed viewers with its incredible and breathtaking single-take action sequences. ""Gravity"" has been gaining even more praise with even director James Cameron calling it ""the best space film ever made."" With ""Gravity,"" Alfonso Cuarn has created a near perfect and terrifying 3D journey of desolation.

You see Kowalski supervising Dr. Stone in the opening of the film. There's a lot of small talk on Kowalski's end; an endless amount of stories on his part, a love for alcohol, and knowledge of his good looks that he throws into conversations with ease. Dr. Stone, on the other hand, is very nervous. They've already spent a week up in space and she just wants to get her feet back on stable ground. In other words, Kowalski is extremely relaxed while Dr. Stone can't stop being clenched up and tense.

This is one film that demands to be seen in 3D. Next to the screw flying into the camera that you've probably seen in trailers, pretty much anything that floats in zero gravity leaps off of the screen. There's a certain action figure that'll likely get a few laughs while drops of water, human tears, and a variety of astronaut gear drift into the foreground and hover directly in front of your face.

The space elements are exceptional. Alfonso Cuarn's perspective of space is just mesmerizing. Sometimes it's the little things like the reflection in someone's helmet or taking in the view amongst all of the destruction that wind up impressing you. The silence is deafening. Space in film has never felt so quiet and haunting. The carnage caused by the debris is also astonishing. Not only is it a wonder to watch unfold, but it's amazing to see anyone emerge unscathed from such devastation.

The one issue may not be a dilemma for everyone. Sandra Bullock's Ryan Stone makes this really heartfelt speech about where she comes from and her daughter pretty early on. It's extremely emotional and character defining. Needless to say, it's effective and memorable. What nearly ruins it though is that Stone tries to make another speech just like it in the final moments of the film and it seems completely corny in comparison. Up to a certain point, it works just fine but the whole ""it's been one hell of a ride"" part of it just debunks the whole thing and throws it into lame territory.

""Gravity"" practically redefines the space genre with its dizzying outlook of space, stunning cinematography, and the overwhelming sensation of being utterly alone. The sense of helplessness in ""Gravity"" is unlike anything you've ever experienced in a film before; an endless struggle to survive only heightened by the film's excellent 3D effects.",1380758400,4,2818,4.887029288702929
5865493,5,B00DY64A3U,"I've been reading about this one for quite some time, so I've been eager to see if it's the real deal. Anything starring two Oscar winners in a two-person film should be impressive.

Directed by three-time Oscar nominee Alfonso Cuarn (""Children of Men"") with a script by Mr. Cuarn and his son Jons, this science fiction thriller takes us to outer space where a medical engineer and an astronaut become untethered from their crippled space shuttle.

Drama ensues....
  * Sandra Bullock (""The Heat"") in the role of a lifetime, is a brand new space technician with only six months of training under her belt. As the publicity says, she has recently lost a young child and is trying to cope with her grief. Her language still reflects her life with a young child: when confronted by some confusing options, she automatically says, ""Eeny, meeny, miny, moe...""
  * George Clooney (""The Descendants"") is the flight commander. He is a major chatterbox: funny, informed, and very smart. He consistently uses humor to diffuse the situation. I still want to know what happened in New Orleans at the Mardi Gras!

My biggest problem is with credibility: that Russian Soyuz station is within visual range, as is the one from India. On the other hand, the special effects that illustrate the lack of gravity are exceptional. Objects which float away or drift into view remind us what a boon gravity is for us and why zero gravity is such a challenge. I tend to find films of this nature unsettling, and this one is certainly no different. BTW, that parachute was a nightmare!

Yes, I understand this is a work of fiction. Normally there is some slight attempt at being believable.  Plan 9 from Outer Space is more believable, and vastly more entertaining.

Poor Sandra Bullock, who I normally like, is forced to endure possibly the worst script ever written.  She does a whole lot of talking to herself and random button pushing in an attempt to operate the spacecraft.

To make matters worse, they even throw in the universally loathed dream sequences.

As Bullocks borrowed Chinese spacecraft is reentering the atmosphere items inside it are still floating around!  I guess the geniuses that wrote the screenplay figured that anything inside of a spaceship just floats around all the time.

The movie really has no ending.  Bullock makes it back to earth, but we have no idea where she landed. For all the audience knows she landed in North Korea and will never be heard from again.

In order to please the Chinese sensors, China hardware is utilized to affect a return to earth.  (China is now the second largest market for movies in the world, and a movie can contain nothing perceived as anti-China.)",1520121600,,1198,4.823529411764706

While a statement like that might trigger discourse among the majority of film aficionados, in all fairness a remake should improve upon the original source material  and while Gravity is not based upon either Kubricks film or Arthur C. Clarks book  the humanitarian themes and cinematic technical innovation are certainly present. The survival instinct of Sandra Bullocks is the core on which Gravity exists. The astonishing visuals, while tremendously praiseworthy in their own right, would only become stagnant if it were not for this Hollywood perfect narrative of being pushed to edge as Bullock wrestles with the dilemma of the will to live vs. the distraught to die. To be seemingly defeated is the road of return; to evolve into a new person and garner the rally of the audience.

Just because it takes place in space doesn't make it science fiction.  The action scenes are so far-fetched that it's comedic, (last 2 Star Treks come to mind which is difficult as I have been a Trekkie for most of my life).  I do like computerized special effects, don't get me wrong, but it goes so far beyond sometimes that my husband and I will just look at each other and shake our heads.

""Star Wars,"" ""Star Trek,"" and all the others think that audiences have to hear explosions and rocket engines or they'll be bored. But ""2001"" proved that the silence of outer space can be effectively mesmerizing.

The earth itself is also quite beautifully rendered, and is a star in its own right. However, aside from the effects there really isn't a lot to this movie. It didn't engage me as much as I had expected simply because it fails to achieve the emotional resonance it is clearly aiming for. The characters and dialogue are just too formulaic to be believable. It also stretches credulity to breaking point. Time and again I found myself shaking my head in disbelief at the near misses survived by Sandra Bullocks character and by the serendipity she repeatedly benefited from. Although it endeavours to be realistic the sheer improbability of what happens destroys the illusion and, for me at least, prevented me from caring much about what happened to the plucky, and always likeable, Ms Bullock.

5865897,5,B00DY64A3U,"This film was assigned in my daughter's college film class, so I watched it with her for the heck of it. What an amazing film and story, even though it's entirely made up. Because of the type of class, we dug deeper into the writer's background for this film, which was fascinating to learn about how this story grew from the realities of crossing the border from Mexico to the USA and all that goes into that for non-US citizens... what a transformation of ideas! Besides that interesting bit of insight, the excellent visual effects throughout this film made the entire experience so believable, as if it was all really filmed in space. I recently read an excerpt from Scott Kelly's experiences on the ISS and was particularly impressed with how similar it felt to watch Sandra Bullock's character deal with earth's gravity in the same way Mr. Kelly described it after being in zero gravity.

This film isn't for kids as there is a shocking scene or two when disaster hits, but these moments are brief and didn't ruin the experience for a wimp like me who can't stand gore anymore (there's too much of the real thing in life to watch fake gore that looks so real). I enjoyed the film much more than I ever imagined. It really transformed me for a while (which in the current political and world concerns these days, was a welcome experience).",1505347200,,1344,4.6

Yes, there are some unsubtle references to 2001 (that's a movie that will always be a benchmark), there are some annoying moments with George Clooney zipping around in his EVA suit, most of the 'science' in this movie is real....except for the holding onto exploding hatches....Some of the end scenes are heavy handed with message, but the messages are good.

I like sci-fi, horror, drama, and all that. I'll try to succinctly pro and con how I felt about it. I don't care about who'd billed the roles here.

Pros
- Many good attempts at realistic, space physics, even if CGI. It helps with immersion.
- The scenery, for when it existed (and wasn't being destroyed), was detailed and also felt natural.
- Some character relatability and emotional arc, in the sense of giving up to wanting to survive.

Cons
- Spin, twist, tumble, panic, heavy breathing, condensation, fling this way and that, barely grab on, etc.
- Can beat the dead horse for a while with the 'lack of self-confidence' and 'desire to live' narration.
- Too much talk! Silence is the speech between sound. In many situations, talk breaks the atmosphere.

Concerning the plot, there's only so many things you can do in space with what venues are available, and what situations might occur. In other words, it's (ever so slightly) predictable, but has some twists. I think it's worth a watch. Is it worth a buy? That's up to you.

5866022,2,B00DY64A3U,"Pretty unimpressive stuff dramatically.  Technically it's fairly impressive in terms of how some of the shots were composed and created, but the story is more like a TV episode of the Outer Limits or Twilight Zone caliber, and not really worthy of a feature film, in my opinion.

The general thrust of the film is to inspire women to get involved in space and science, ergo Bullock playing the lead.  Eh ... really, is that necessary?  I think women who want to go into the sciences have already made up their minds, and it doesn't strike me that society is wanting for other social groups to head into the field.  But, films are made to inspire, and ""Gravity"" was made with that agenda in mind.

I don't hate the film, although I have to admit it's hard not to due to all the hype injected into it.  And that's important because the hype injected into this thing assumes that the film's cause is in need of being addressed.  Well, no, it isn't.  And there's not much more to say about the hype and purpose of the film.

As I sat and watched this thing I kept wondering when it was going to be over.  That, and there's the usual lack of knowledge on the screenwriters part concerning the science involved in and portrayed in this film.  You can forgive that if the story is good enough.  But, like I say, it's like an episode of some contemporary modern scifi TV show blown up to feature film length and format.  Can you really get into that?

A real yawner, in my opinion.  I checked this film out at the library and returned it the next day.  I can't imagine spending money to see the thing in a threatre, much less renting or buying it.

Still, there's Sandy who doesn't skip ""leg day,"" and looking fit.  She acted much better than George, but George was taking direction methinks.

But I""d waited quite some time to see it again, and I just did not remember how much space action there was, and it is so nicely done and there's a ton of it.  Future me, watch again when again you think the film not worth a viewing.  I'd started this viewing ""just to see if I get caught.""  I did.

The initial writing was very weak, but once Sandy started her soliloquy, the writing was adequate.

I won't read the other reviews.  To me the CGI was just perfect -- did not see any iffy effects....physical laws were obeyed.  Somehow, I was thrilled at many points despite my knowing the outcomes...holding my breath underwater too, ya see?  That's good editing and me being a Sandy fanboy.  Nice.

* 1 star (Nope, DO NOT LIKE IT AT ALL!): I would either return or throw away this product. It was a waste of my money and not functional. I will never order again.
** 2 star (Think twice before buying - don't like it): I'm not a fan of this item and I won't order it again, but it has at least one positive quality.
*** 3 star (Its ok): This item has both positive and negative qualities. It may work for some people, but I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase or recommend it.
**** 4 star (I like it): This item arrived and functions as advertised. I would change a few things about this (including pricing), but is a good product overall. I would use this item.

5866123,2,B00DY64A3U,"Sorry, this film is a lot of noise about nothing.  Yeah, got all the accolades and earned a bucket of gold but it is all techno-nerd jargon and insides of spacecraft full of knobs and buttons and data screens.  Sandra Bullock is charming and animated and interesting BUT she has no one to play to or with.  the Clooney character is either in the background or entirely off-screen.  Here's a caveat.  If you have a large, 3D video at home OR you see this in a theater on a GIANT 3D screen, the immensity of space coupled with the beauty of the revolving earth is probably breathtaking.

But there is no intensity of dramatic interaction with a single character literally lost in space.  On a small, flat screen, our scientist-rookie astronaut just can't carry a 90-minute drama regardless of the dazzling scenery of earth and space.  Even in a darkened theater on a giant, 3D screen, this would seem to be more a fictional documentary than a real story.  Here's a clue: my son is an aerospace engineering grad and a NASA geek and he couldn't fight past his boredom to see this thing through.  If your goal is an absorbing drama, look elsewhere.",1487462400,,1143,4.5588235294117645

Clooneys boring banter and jet pack space rides ads 2 move levels of boredom to this disaster flick. Throw in some C&W music to bring it all together. The underwear scene was much better when Sigourney did it in a much better film. Lets not forget the fire extinguisher that makes an excellent jet pack while we hop from one piece of space junk to another. This whole absurd mess of visual effects makes something like Deep Impact look like a thoughtful and intelligent look at a potential disaster. I guess you either like it or not but how someone won a Best Director award for this is beyond me. If you can believe hopping from the shuttle to a space station to another space station and then successfully land on terra firma is something that could actually be done thats one giant leap but so was taking potatoes to Mars.

And in case anyone thought this was a sci fi film, it takes place in near earth orbit and could happen today.  What it is, is a story about survival.

We all know it's a great picture (the blu-ray was absolutely stunning) but what really blew me away were the making-of featurettes.

It was like a slice of life in the day of an astronaut that got screwed up.  Part of the theme was letting go in order to move ahead.  I could relate to that as it is often the same with rock climbing. If you want to climb, you cannot cling to the rock. You have to push your body away from the rock to let your shoes do their job.  So she had to learn to let go if she planned to survive. Not exactly boring or tedious, but a stronger plot would have given Sandra more to work with.",1482624000,,745,4.034013605442177

During a space walk at the Hubble telescope, a disaster occurs that sets astronauts on a fantastic journey that will severely test their resolve, high above the Earth. A realistic CGI-masterpiece, the movie stars Sandra Bullock, George Clooney, Phaldut Sharma, and the voice of Ed Harris. Academy Award-winning director Alfonso Cuarn's movie took home 7 Oscars in all. Wow, Sandra Bullock and director Cuarn! Very Definitely Recommended. Four REALISTIC Stars. (Warner Bros. films.

We didn't finish the movie, turning off the website and watch another movie altogether. We found this whole space romp incredibly flat, bland, and totally unbelievable. There is no character development and the events are unnatural and tired. What little science there is comes off as duller than dishwater. Every single move is easily predictible. I felt like the movie tried to sell something that could be real and I found that I could've wrote a better script. I honestly cannot fathom how this movie won the awards that it did.

5866424,5,B00DY64A3U,"Just finished watching ""Gravity"" released by Warner Brothers.
A disclaimer - while I do own the 3D version of this movie on blue-ray, I only watched the regular 2D version. So while I did get a little motion sick, you can only yell at me Zack Newsome and Jeff H. for disobeying your standing orders not to watch this movie in any version. [Don't even think of sneaking into the house and removing all the movies you think may make me motion sick and/or cause me to have a seizure Zack and Jeff.]
""Gravity"" is a gripping survival movie that chronicles the first and probably last mission of Dr. Ryan Stone - a physician who developed a piece of technology that will help improve the vision of the Hubble Space Telescope and extend it's reach into the cosmos. As she is installing the component she designed and built, NASA informs the crew of the space shuttle that the Russians accidentally destroyed one of their space satellites and that it has set off a deadly cloud of debris that is on course for the shuttle. Despite an emergency release of the Hubble and a race for the safety of the shuttle for an emergency landing on earth, the debris field destroys the space shuttle leaving Stone and fellow astronaut Matt Kowalski stranded in space. Their only hope for survival is to travel to the International Space Station and use the remaining Soyuz capsule to make a trip over to the Chinese Space Station for a return flight home. Only disaster strikes again, and Kowalski sacrifices his life so that Stone can have a chance for return back home. Only does she have the inner strength and determination to carry on and live?
Gravity is intense and does offer some of the best realistic space scenes ever filmed.
Highly Recommended!

5866425,1,B00DY64A3U,"I knew the plot was simple and unbelievable, but I wanted to see the effects in 3D.  Once again, I was extremely let down by Warner Brothers.  The 3D is as basic as converting 2D to 3D on your TV(nothing special/the worst quality 3D). Plus, in 3D, they give you an 'Auto Motion Plus' or 'Cinemotion' copy of the movie.  Meaning everything looks like it has been remastered using Computer Generated Imagery.

However, there are 3 reasons I gave it a four stars vice a lower rating:

A) Cinematography was outstanding
B) Though I am not a fan of either George nor Sandra, they did a good job. George with his usual laissez-faire characterization; Sandra knocked it out of the park.
C) No sex - which alone made it worthwhile in my book; tired of trying to find a movie without some sort of gratutious boob-flash or more.",1475971200,,506,4.372340425531915

5866447,5,B00DY64A3U,"I thought this was an amazing movie with stunning visuals, heart-pounding action, and great performances. Most movies about modern space travel revolve around the wonder, beauty, and science of it. ""Gravity"" tackles the uncomfortable side, which is that it's extremely dangerous. While on a spacewalk to repair a damaged satellite, Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is caught in a deadly cloud of debris in Earth orbit. The debris destroys her space shuttle, forcing her and her partner Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) to survive and find their own way back to Earth. I was impressed with the story, which I find hardest to write, taking the worst thing that could possibly happen, throw it at the hero, have the hero solve it, throw the next worst thing at the hero, and repeat. It's easy to throw a bunch of easy challenges than it is to truly come up with a real challenge and try to figure a way out. I lost count of how many times I truly thought Stone was doomed with no way out.

I found the special effects amazing in every respect. The CGI is realistic and immersive, bringing the vast expanse of space and the intricate spacecraft to life. The moments where Sandra Bullock drifts aboard space stations are the most authentic depictions of null gravity I've ever seen. At times, ""Gravity"" felt more like a documentary to me than a movie.

I saw ""Gravity"" in 3-D, and it's the first movie I've seen since ""Avatar"" that used 3-D as more than just a gimmick. The whole movie worked to put you into Sandra Bullock's place, seeing things from inside her helmet to hearing muffled sounds as if inside her spacesuit. The 3-D worked as another layer of depth to pull viewers in. When she looked down at Earth, the sense of distance was both thrilling and terrifying.

For a movie about space, ""Gravity"" had surprisingly little techno-babble. Most of the problems involved simple things like running out of air, fire, and getting caught on wiring. The solutions were equally easy to understand. Compare ""Gravity"" with ""Apollo 13,"" which pivoted around a faulty CO2 scrubber and calculating trajectories, and you'll see why that's such an achievement.

Of course, such simplicity comes at the cost of accuracy. The movie overly simplifies space travel and puts spacecraft way too close together, but I can forgive the flaws for everything it gets right.

The movie has little characterization, but I was surprised at how well it worked. With her predicament, sympathy came automatically, but they threw in just enough details to hint at a deeper background and make Stone a more rounded character. I thought Bullock did an amazing job, essentially carrying most of the movie by herself. It's hard to do, but she truly brought the character to life, and made her vulnerable, heroic, and realistic.

Overall, I thought ""Gravity"" was a remarkable movie that put space travel onto the screen in a way that's never been more exciting or awe inspiring.",1474416000,,2942,4.8389662027833005

We take for granted that when we let go of something, it falls to the ground.  And when we start moving, we will eventually slow down.  That isn't the case in space.  Plus, the problem they encounter in the movie seems plausible.  I don't know how realistic it would be for that problem to occur, but at least they are not fighting Martians.

5866576,5,B00DY64A3U,"Not sure I'm really qualified to review films, but it doesn't seem like half of the people who do it for a living are either so here we go.

I love this movie, it really does live up to the hype. I'm a sucker for space movies, and I'm sure every other nerd who drooled over Apollo 13 and lined up to see the Martian on opening night doesn't need me to tell them to go get this one. Go on, just do it, then for extra fun go read Niel deGrasse Tyson's tweets picking it apart. If you're wondering about quality, I thought the video and sound quality on the stream version were great, and I watched it with mid-grade home theater setup. If you're a truly dedicated quality junkie you might want to pick up a Blu-ray, my roomie insists that it's better and AV is pretty much his life, but I didn't really notice a difference. Also go for the Blu-ray if you don't have a particularly fast internet connection- buffering in the wrong spot in this film will make you want to tear your hair out.

People who aren't space fanatics: The cinematography alone is worth it, the crew really knew how to frame a shot for maximum impact and the CG is just gorgeous. As for writing, the surface plot is about an astronaut trying to survive a catastrophic accident, but the entire thing is an allegory for how loss can shred a person's life as swiftly and devastatingly as any rogue space debris. Parallels between the situation playing out on screen and how difficult it is to move on from a tragedy are expertly drawn with creative shots and well placed dialogue.

The pacing is really intense, and that tension does not let up for the majority of the film. I didn't zone out for a single moment the first time I watched it, and that's rare. I'm pretty picky about movies because they don't usually connect me to the world and the characters as much as books do, but this one did a fantastic job of making me feel for the protagonist, and keeping me engaged. Which is why I'm rambling about how awesome it is on Amazon even though everybody already knew that from watching this thing roll around in a pile of awards and critical praise.",1466553600,4,2120,4.362025316455696

With that being said, this film had a hidden agenda, which was to expose you images and scripts that revolve around pro-life, Darwinism, and religion. It was distasteful, annoying, and frustrating. For example: 1) Sandra bullock appears in the fetal position after narrowly escaping death. 2) Sandra bullock tries to commit suicide by reducing her oxygen, and minutes later begins to ""hallucinate"" or experience a spiritual phenomenon were George comes back from the dead (arguably a Jesus metaphor) and advices her on what to do. 3) Sandra claims to not be religious, yet in her moment of despair she begins to pray. 4) Sandra also begins to mention how her daughter is in a special after-life place when descending to earth. 5) finally, upon landing on earth, Sandra swims up and slowly reaches the surface. This camera angle captures her struggle getting up and also touching or feeling the earth. As she gets up the camera faces up at her from the bottom and all you see is nature at its best that is accompanied with inspirational music. This whole scene is Darwinism at play. This whole film is just disappointing all around.",1465948800,,1198,4.848780487804878

Clooney nearly steals the film in a supporting role but Bullock does well enough to carry the lead. Although it's a strong feminist role, in many places it's unrealistic in a literal sense so we have to accept a sci-fi touch to over look those. But I think the storyline and subsequent adventures are unique and engaging.

Good character definition bordering on a human interest story, a group of astronauts working in space encounter devastating issues resulting in two left alive. Survival becomes the name of the game and the movie's theme.",1464998400,,669,4.973214285714286

With Interstellar, this may be one of the most visually arresting realistic space films ever made. I've heard interviews with at least 2 former astronauts who said ""Gravity"" captured the experience of being in orbit better than any film ever has.

5866665,3,B00DY64A3U,"I watched Gravity, The Martian and Interstellar

Interstellar has probably all of the elements of a ""good"" captivating film comparing to the others. It's behind the science in comparing to The Martian, but it has a metaphysical angle that some may like (akin to 2001). I did not have any issues with the pacing of the film, though it might be long for non sci fans. There are some conceptual and science plot holes like any sci-fi film, but not in an annoying way (like gravity). Though for the main concept you'd have to suspend disbelief. I would put this in the same category as Kubrick 2001, but not above it. Story is a 5/5, Science is a 5/4.

The Martian is a more of solid ""science now"" movie. So while great all around it's not as ""sci-fi"" as some other more ""futuristic"" films, which is both a positive to some and maybe a negative to others. While I'm pretty good in picking up technical faults, they were not obvious in this film. This is a solid well researched film. If you're technically inclined you might actually predict technical problems before they happen, which was a surprise for me since pretty much any other sci-fi film I had watched before simply made things up. I can't think of many other films to compare it to, except maybe Gravity for what it tried to do and failed at. Story is a 5/4, Science is a 5/5.

Gravity is a film I wanted to like but it just has a number of conceptual problems that I can not look past. I was most disappointed in that while it was depicting ""space"" they could not stop and let you feel like you're in space. For example, 2001 did this brilliantly with the sound of breathing, in this film they just stick music in when they run out of all of that annoying dialogue. I did not like the Sandra Bullock character at all. Her character came off too much like the female equivalent of ""average joe"" in space, which I found annoying. Her presence in the film made all of the holes in the film rather glaring. The positive of this film is that it has realistic orbital mechanics (Physics). But not realistic Science. Story is a 5/3, Science is a 5/3.",1461456000,,2102,4.3984575835475574

5866778,5,B00DY64A3U,"So I also live in Spain and mostly buy my movies on Blu-Ray. Have been looking at an option to purchase movies online in English without needing a VPN to pretend I am somewhere else. The Apple ecosystem seems like the best, but I hate the closed Apple Ecosystem. I am a Microsoft grunt, in the sense I have a Windows phone, Xbox, Windows 10 PC etc., but the Windows store also has this retarded only in Spanish system where movies are not available in their own original language. I just went to Google Play to check out the Google option and they too have a retarded system. I see what Paolo says about the content owners, but I do not give two hoots about the content owners. At the end of the day, it is Apple, Microsoft, Google or some other company which is licensing me the content. If they cannot be bothered to license me digital content with a plethora of language and subtitle options, well then I cannot be bothered to purchase the content. Either give me something which is a value proposition or shove it, and trust me there are plenty of other options for obtaining the content for free in the languages I want.

The companies involved, content producers and licensing re-sellers need to smarten up and improve their game or they will never attract customers like me. I have no problem paying for the content, but I will not buy or ""license"" a shoddy product which I cannot even view in its original language. NO NO NO. Wake up and smell the coffee that we live in a multi-language world where people are travelling and interacting with different cultures and languages more so than at any other time. E.g. I am British, living in Spain with a Brazilian girl friend. I want to watch stuff in English , she wants to watch stuff in Portuguese or at least with Portuguese or Spanish subtitles. The online options available from the three major companies are all pretty poor. Stop locking down language options, and make it easier for the customers to get the content they want and are willing to pay for. These language restrictions are dreamt up by retards at the content producers who have a scant understanding of the markets they are selling too.

Aside from that, the content producers currently have an oligopoly in place with the artificial licensing restrictions by country which stop us from playing our content whilst travelling etc., Again, this is a Kafkaesque system drawn up by idiots who have no understanding of what their customers actually want. The EU is slowly coming around to realising what these retards have put in place and there is talk of removing the license restrictions by country and creating a homogeneous EU zone. Bring it on. Then there will actually be proper competition in a more normal marketplace rather than the current artificial monstrosity which as users we currently suffer through.

Sadly, right now, Apple appears to have the ""best"" system in place for language optionality. Disappoint Google! Google and Android have the most open architecture and I would much rather have bought into the Google ecosystem for movies.

5866810,4,B00DY64A3U,"DVD transfer is excellent which this film must have to convey the feeling of space.

The special affects are stunning which elevates this film's rating.  Sandra Bullock is very good as a specialist astronaut trapped by circumstances which leave her alone in space, drifting and in grave danger.  George Clooney appears in the opening sequences but, for most of the film, this is a solo performance.

The action centers on space debris which destroys a space shuttle and kills the crew.  Space walkers Bullock and Clooney are left to find a way to survive.  Soon, Clooney must drift away leaving Bullock (Ryan Stone) to fend for herself.  She travels to the ISS then to a Chinese space lab in hopes of finding a way to re-enter Earth's atmosphere.

There is some tension and, once again, great technical work creating the space environment where the film takes place.  The ending is flat and somewhat unbelievable so I left out the 5th star rating.

Recommended for viewers 12 and older.  Nice space adventure for the family and the older kids.  I found the storyline to be somewhat hard to believe since this is not a fantasy film.",1454976000,3,1131,4.743589743589744

5866830,2,B00DY64A3U,"I'd say the weightlessness was done amazingly well about 90% of the time, and screwed up royally 10% of the time. When it was done right, that and the Earth views were the best things about this movie.

I don't know diddly about the space program, yet I saw a LOT of glaring technical errors in this film. The lady going on and on and on after her oxygen was gone and her suit was filling with CO2 was one... that space suit must have as much volume inside as Santa's goody bag! Then the guy letting go because the cables wouldn't support both of them... they already had come to a dead stop relative to the space station, they were now both in neutral parallel orbits near it, so what exactly was pulling him away so forcefully? If anything they would be both rebounding slightly back towards it, in real life. Remember, there is no ""weight"" up in orbit, only mass and inertia. The open door in the dream part I'm willing to overlook since it was a dream but in real life you MIGHT barely survive half a second of full vacuum, if you could get immediate hospital care afterwards. Your blood would essentially boil as nitrogen and other gasses started bubbling out of solution. For that reason the dead bodies in the shuttle would have looked far MORE gruesome in reality... probably black & blue skin torn to shreds by popped gas blisters, plus blood coming out of eyes, mouth, ears, etc. Your lungs would likely burst even in half a second, should you try holding your breath. Then there is the space junk that circles the Earth way out there every 90 minutes, while travelling at a visually estimated speed of 50 miles per hour. I could go on about the impossibilities, but others have already covered more than I would even know to perceive.

Lots more parts might not have been 100% impossible, but were so outlandishly unlikely that they further distracted from the story. Parts such as the lady not barfing in her space suit at the first tumble, or her Russian spacecraft coming thru OK as every other structure in the area was torn to absolute rags by her bad driving. Well there is almost no end to the near-impossibilities in this movie. If I had been drinking anything while watching it, there would have been liquid spraying out of my nostrils about every 2 minutes.

Movies like this, and even more the positive reviews and awards they receive, make me very depressed about our education system in America and about the values of our culture. Not only are we stupid enough to make this film, we are stupid enough to applaud it as well. Our schools are obviously failing, but worse is that our culture itself puts no value in truth or accuracy or logic.",1454284800,,2665,4.513457556935818

There's what's known as a heating and cooling garment. This garment has a webbing of thin hoses all over the torso, arms, legs, and fingers to help reject, or accept heat as needed. This garment is what keeps an astronaut's body a the correct temperature, in other words. Then, you have the pressure suit.

Stunning visuals, and the best space movie I've seen since Alien. For a film with only two characters, George Clooney and Sandra Bulllock pull this off splendidly, he as the overconfident extroverted mission commander, and she as the destroyed by life loser who rises up to embrace life.  She's so messed up at the beginning  I doubt  NASA psychologists would have given her the clearance to go into space, but's let not worry about that. Despite the high tech setting of orbital stations, first a space shuttle docked at Hubble, then the International Space Station, then a Chinese station which, we trust, does not yet exist, the movie borders on romanticism, if not schmaltz. And for the scientifically literate in the audience, there's two glaring flaws. The first is where they're tethered together at the ISS, and Clooney gallantly disconnects to drift to his own death. But this is space, and there's no weight, only mass, and there's no force pulling them apart. Not even centrifugal force, you see Earth unmoving in the background. How did the scientific adviser miss this obvious point? The second gaffe is where she reaches the Chinese station, which is starting to descend into Earth's atmosphere.  Are they implying the Chinese are too dumb to put a space station in a stable orbit? But suspend the disbelief, you physics majors.

5866875,4,B00DY64A3U,"I am not the kind of person who
enjoys the theatrical experience, so unfortunately, that never happened. Oddly, I
was at the Dolby screening room in NYC yesterday for a press event where we were
shown a 2D clip of the film. The scene in question is where Houston alerts the mission
specialists of a pending emergency, and as satellite debris rushes in, one of the astronauts
is suddenly hit and hurtled into space.  Watching even a piece of this film for the first
time, with mounting intensity on the screen and the panning of panicked voices across
the theater in Dolby Atmos surround, I found my heart pace suddenly quickening.  When
the clip ended and the theater lights came up, most everyone in the audience let out an
audible gasp.  We had just seen something quite remarkable on that screen.  I could
not wait to get back home knowing that a screener copy had just arrived in my mailbox.

I am going to refer back to that Dolby Atmos presentation a little later in my review.

First, let's talk a little about the film itself.  On the surface, Gravity is a simple, yet
electrifying human adventure about survival in space.  However, as a whole, the
film is no doubt a Hollywood game changer and technological achievement for Director
Alfonso Cuarn and his team of visual and audio artists who have created not just a
film, but a very intimate and emotional experience.

As the film opens, we find mission specialists Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt
Kowalski (George Clooney) hovering above the earth, as they make repairs to the Hubble
space telescope.  There's some initial amusement to be had about Kowalski wisecracking
over the radio with Houston, as he effortlessly drifts in empty space.  However, things
suddenly go terribly wrong when Houston suddenly issues a warning that field of debris from
a blown Russian satellite are hurtling towards them at the speed of a bullet.  The onrush of
debris destroys the shuttle and crew onboard, leaving Stone and Kowalski on their own, fighting
to survive in an environment unsuitable for survival.

Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki expertly uses the camera both traditionally and digitally
to convey the sudden calamity of the stranded astronauts within the emptiness of space as they
scramble to grab on to whatever wreckage they can.  With amazing attention given to visual detail,
supported with a heart-wrenching score from composer Steven Price, Gravity becomes a survival
story like none other you have ever experienced...

...and for the very first time ever, this becomes a survival story that the audience endures as
much as the characters on-screen, thanks to its 3D visuals and placement of sound that makes
everything seem completely real.

Fortunately, this very personal experience seems to have translated quite well to the home
viewing environment, though I am a little perplexed as to why Warner stopped short of pulling
out all the stops on this Blu-ray release.  I'll explain more in a bit.

Visually, Gravity is stunning to watch. This is a flawless, razor-sharp, 1080p transfer with
unprecedented levels of detail. You'll marvel alongside Clooney as he gazes at the gorgeous
blue earth set against the deep blackness of space. The level of 3D doesn't quite live up to
what I had initially hoped for, but then again, I'm starting to accept the fact that there aren't as
many 3D purists out there as myself and perhaps my expectations these days have been set
unrealistically high.  In all, the level of depth and separation is quite good.  It's not as
exaggerated as I would have liked, but it does look completely natural. What viewers will notice
most when donning eyewear is the layering of effects that range from rays of sunlight and
sunspots to gauge notifications and smudges from within Sandra Bullock's helmet.  The most
important aspect of watching this film in 3D is how it conveys the size of objects within the vastness
of space.  There's a scene early on where Bullock, appearing as a mere speck, is spinning endlessly
within infinity.  Later, there are two memorable 3D moments aboard separate space capsules where
objects float in and out of frame.  I personally prefer the level of 3D during the sequence aboard the
abandoned Russian capsule, which we see later in the film, as Bullock frantically races through its
narrow passages in hopes of escaping a fiery disaster.

What personally disappointed me about the 3D experience of Gravity was the near absence of
forward projection.  I had really hoped that the visual artists would have allowed more objects
to move outside of the viewing area.  Within the entire film, I can only remember two moments
where projection is evident.  One involves a loose bolt and wrench that float slightly outward.
Another, much more prominent at the 1-hour mark, involves a water molecule (perhaps a
teardrop) that floats slowly forward and quietly hovers within the space that lies between display
and viewer.

Crosstalk/Ghosting?  Not a hint of it to be seen anywhere -- even in objects being rushed
towards the viewer.

In all, I can't be disappointed by the level of 3D.  It is only but a part of the sum of the total
presentation (which I will talk more about next).  Let's just say that some posted comments
by HTF members led me to believe that that there would be many exaggerated levels of
pop-out (which there isn't), while other comments suggested there was absolutely no forward
projection (which there indeed is).

So, let's move on to the audio presentation of Gravity which deserves just as much merit as
the visual.  Yesterday, while at a Dolby presentation, I was reminded of a quote that George
Lucas made after completing his Star Wars saga.  He said, ""Sound is only half the picture.""
After having just watched this film partly in Dolby Atmos and completely in 5.1 DTS-HD, I can
confidently say that this presentation exceeds that ratio.

I don't think I have ever been so moved by film audio as much as I have with this mix created
by sound editor Glenn Freemantle and sound recording mixer Skip Lievsay and the manner
in which it is spread across the entire soundscape theatrically and (much lesser so) in the home.
This is something that you not only hear....but feel.  Every mood is related through the use of
music and elaborate sound effects across every single channel.  At times, such as in the film's
opening moments when Houston is relaying warnings of pending disaster, the audio channels are
completely crammed with chatter.  Voices move from one speaker to another in a single instant,
and then back again. Then, there are moments of terrifying, complete silence with the exception
of the sound of a single heartbeat, pounded out in the LFE channel.  The soundtrack conveys an
often eerie feeling that I have never experienced in film before.  Even at its noisiest levels,
dialogue manages to come across with complete clarity.  While I feel spoiled by having heard
some of this in a Dolby Atmos setting, I am not  disappointed with the down mix on my 5.1 system.

....but this is the kind of film that would have compelled anyone (including myself) to upgrade
their system to 7.1, and yet, Warner has totally botched this Blu-ray release with just a 5.1 mix.
This is something that totally makes no sense to me whatsoever.  You take one of the best film
mixes of all time, give it the Atmos treatment theatrically, then strip it down to its barest essentials
with just a 5.1 mix.  Not the way I would treat a film that will probably walk away with Oscars for
its sound mix.

Damn you, Warner!  I would have gladly gone out this weekend and purchased two additional
speakers just to hear this film in 7.1.  Why did you botch up this disc's audio presentation?

Gravity arrives as a 3-Disc Blu-ray Combo (Blu-ray 3D+Blu-ray 2D+DVD and Digital HD
Ultraviolet).  The two Blu-ray discs are grouped together on a single spindle.  The package
is housed with an attractive 3D lenticular cardboard cover.

Gravity Blu-ray 3D Combo Pack, Blu-ray Combo Pack and 2-Disc Standard Definition DVD
Special Edition contain the following special features (not reviewed):

* Collision Point: The Race to Clean Up Space (Narrated by Ed Harris)
* Aningaa1 - A Short Film buy Jons Cuarn
* Gravity Mission Control
* Shot Breakdowns
* Sandra's Surprise!

There are no trailers at the start of the 3D disc.  This is preferable to viewers like myself
who would rather get to the main feature as quickly as possible.

Having watched GRAVITY on 3D Blu-ray, I have had to take a step back and re-examine
my expectations when it comes to the kind of elaborate over-the-top 3D that I prefer and
rate these films upon.  I have come to realize that the 3D aspect is only half the sum of the
total presentation itself.  When you marry it with one of the most complex sound mixes ever
created for film, you can't help but marvel at its completeness.  This a film filled with visual
and sonic layers, brilliantly crafted together, to make this a sensory experience like none
other you have had before.

Ignore my breakdown scores.  The total sum of the presentation ranks this as the best
3D title currently available.  If you own a 3D display, this belongs in your collection.",1453075200,,9208,4.832270408163265

Her aside, the story itself wasn't told all that great; the heroine constantly panicked, wasted oxygen, hesitated on following orders and hallucinated...yet she was cleared by NASA??

Parts of the story dragged on for far too long; when she needed to get her butt in gear and do something, she just sat there (maybe for dramatic effect(?), which made it boring instead of dramatic).  I'm not sure which awards this movie won, but I'm certainly sorry I wasted money on it.  I think the only thing that I was impressed with was the animation - but you could still tell that it was animation (especially when she grabs something to hold onto, and her body unnaturally (for space) slings around way too fast, and one scene in particular when she takes off the lower half of her suit - it looks really fake.

Overall I don't recommend this; perhaps if you can find it on Prime or some other stream site to watch it for free, then I would suggest giving it a whirl to simply judge for yourself.

I gave 4 stars because in 2D the movie becomes too flat and the impact of the images and amazing photography just disappear. And the beauty to show the dimension of the space gets lost completely. It's a perfect movie to watch in 3D otherwise you aren't watching the movie as it was meant to be. Yesterday I bought a 3D version on Blue Ray and it's just like in the movies. Fantastic. I had never been a big fan of Sandra Bullock, she always seen too plain and always like same character but in this movie she is stunning.

Movie: Sandra Bullock gets stranded in space, finds her way to a ship and crash lands. That's it. Thats the whole boring movie.

Sandra Bollock: Fumbles around scared the whole movie. Annoyingly. Her character was better off dead and she is too elderly. I guess microgravity is a good place for her and her arthritis, but microgravity can cause osteoporosis so grandma needs to stay on earth.

George Clooney: Talks about how ""good looking"" he is, then dies. Movie didn't need him making it worse anyways. Wish he'd died at the beggining.",1444176000,,549,4.881720430107527

I then bought it on 2D blu-ray and watched it on my 55"" HDTV (tiny... no comparison watching it on a bigger projector screen)... I can understand people complaining about the movie being boring; I actually had a family member fall asleep! If you actually just stream the digital copy on your laptop, you are COMPLETELY missing out on the EXPERIENCE... the story will NOT amaze you, and that's why many complain that it's boring. When I watched it in regular 2D, I just felt there is a lot of mundane scenes and wasn't as exciting... HOWEVER, when you watch it in 3D, it is a completely different experience because the 3D atmosphere alone is just so fascinating like you are in space with them.

This is a film that MUST be watched on big screen 3D - with 5.1 or greater surround sound - to be appreciated! I finally bought the 3D blu-ray version and setup my projector/surround sound system and the experience is just like how I felt in the theaters!

I thought the beginning of the film showed a lot of potential, but I wanted to cover my ears every time Clooney's forced performance called for him to speak.

The movie took a terrible turn towards the middle when it started involving hallucinations and dream sequences, which only drew out the film's length and made it a lot less realistic.

A really interesting concept that-overall-was not executed well.",1440115200,2,629,4.961904761904762

5867315,5,B00DY64A3U,"What an incredible movie. The first time I saw it was in IMAX 3D and it was jaw dropping. I'm ambivalent with the whole 3D thing and can take it or leave it, but in certain movies (especially this one), it brought a whole new dimension to the movie (a new space if you will :P). I have the regular HD Blu Ray version now, and it's just as thrilling as the first time i watched it.

First, one gripe to get out of the way:
The dialogue is very lacking. Second time around, i didn't even bother listening to most of the conversations. The visual treat that this movie provides, outshines the rather shallow exchanges. I don't think that this is too big of a negative (as it doesn't distract from the other elements of the movie). Most of the time Bullock is either talking to a ""Houston in the Dark"", or trying to portray to the audience some sort or relationship between her and Clooney. The delivery is ok, but it could've been spruced up. In my opinion the best dialogue was between Bullock and the crazy chinese father with the AM radio when they begin to howl (I think it's supposed to refer to the first astronaut in space,  good ol Laika). Another awesome use of noise clips was all the random sound bites picked up by radio after landing on busy busy earth (after an absolute silence in space, which again was very well daunting, it made the explosions and craft ripping apart that much more terrifying).

Everything else in the movie is gold! The sense of space, fear, the pacing and tension, cinematography, effects, casting is top notch. A word about Bullock: She's not my favorite actor and was racking my brain to think of someone else who should play the role. But honestly, there's no one else that comes to mind. She really embodied the femininity that was essential to the role. She was intelligent, strong, relatable, wore her heart on her sleeve, sexy and an unbelievable force that could conquer anything (overcoming fear, fighting to live, but also coming to grips with mortality).

A note about religion and science:
So on the Russian Space Craft, the camera angles to an icon of God and Baby Jesus walking on water.
Then on the Chinese Space Craft, the camera angles to a small Buddah figure.
I guess Cuaron wanted to suggest that religion will always be with mankind (wherever we go), even if we've become so technologically advanced as to experiment in space.
Also, when she lands in the water, in an untouched part of the world (eden), she undresses from her heavy spacesuit, swims to the shore, then crawls on the beach and then finally stands to walk (emulating evolution). The whole scene has a parturition quality to it, a rebirth and a welcome to earth vibe. I got that same feeling when she gets out of her hulking space suit the first time around on the space station... taking off bulky, man-made, clumsy garments to reveal a soft, supple, natural female figure.
It's not as subtle as it could have been, but the mix of  religion and science is apparent, and very well done. Especially when she decides to give in to death, and fights to live (with the help of a halucination, or better yet, Clooney in Angel form). She didn't know how to pray, but then moments later, prays and lives for her deceased daughter... Its that easy.

The movie in my opinion is a monumental achievement and highly recommended to everyone!",1439856000,3,3349,4.56405990016639
5867316,2,B00DY64A3U,"It was visually impressive in IMAX 3D. On TV, it will be nothing special. The story was awful, and Bullock and Clooney were essentially playing the same characters they did in Speed and Ocean's Eleven.",1439596800,,201,4.771428571428571

I did learn a few things from this movie:
1. Matt Kowalski has a bad feeling about this mission
2. If you want to create a tough astronaut character, give him a name you would expect for your plumber or garbage man
3. If you want to create a tough female character, give her a man's name, like Ryan and a tough last name, like Stone.
4. If you manage to escape the destruction of your spaceship, and another, and then another, and then still face drowning when you land, you are having a very bad day.

5867499,5,B00DY64A3U,"The diamond luxe version of Gravity on Bluray is quite literally heavy. The solid weight of the flip open book style case is instantly impressive. This thing is built to last. It's borderline a steelbook (but to be clear it ISN'T a steelbook). My only gripe with the case is how the disks are stored, I had a hard time taking the disc out and when it's placed back in, the surface of the desk touches the surface of the case. This has made me very worried  about scratching the disk with my now when trying to slip my finger under to get the discount, and scuffs on the disks surface from touching the case. At least I know how almost impossibly secure the discs are when fully inserted.

The menu buttons are surprisingly out dated. They look like buttons from a mid 90's version of Netscape or Internet Explorer.  The style of the buttons really did not match the overall design of the Blu-ray case, discs or the movie itself. If you've seen an image of the back of the case you'll see what appears to be the slipcover, two Blu-ray discs and an extra booklet. In fact you're looking at the same booklet rearranged in different positions. It's misleading  But I guess that's the only way to show you all sides of a product in a single picture.

The silent space version of this  film isn't exactly void of literally all music. You of course have the music that the astronauts play on the radios, that is  without a doubt understandably left in the film.  The film is supposed to be rid of any sound track, but there are ""stings"" (bursts of sound  made by some form of instruments or electronics in post production)  that occur once during a jump scare, and another time during the final moments of a fairly intense scene.

The special features documenting the making of the film are amazing! Dare I say ""out of this world"". It was a film with the kind of production not seen before so it was fantastic to see how they came up with a new way of filmmaking.

This does not have the 3-D version and I suppose, because 3-D takes up so much more space on a disk, they would literally have to release at least a four disc set to fit it all. When I have liked to have every version in one purchase, sure I suppose. I saw it in 3-D IMAX and it was incredible. But while I love 3-D in the theater I'm still not totally  sold on spending the money for a 3-D television and the extra money on 3-D Blu-rays. I'm impressed enough as it is with the quality and size of the image on a Blu-ray disc on my big screen television and with a nice sound system.  The film is fantastic enough even in 2-D.  I really don't think you're losing out much I not seeing the 3-D version.

A fantastic movie packaged in a fantastic way, I'm very happy with my purchase and I'm certain even a casual film lover would appreciate owning this product.",1435104000,8,2818,4.308712121212121

5867586,1,B00DY64A3U,"Gravity is an insult to storytelling. No exposition at all. The entire movie is one schmaltzy dramatic effect after another, and after 5 minutes I have to wonder why I care about the characters at all. It's almost as if the writers thought ""Oh we'll cast famous people as the lead characters so the audience will think 'No I don't want George Clooney to die, he's too important to Hollywood.'"" What makes it worse is that the characters are so one-dimensional. Clooney is typically narcissistic and Bullock is insultingly weak and emotional. It amazes me that this movie is praised for the spectacular effects when it truly shows the audience so little. The essence of writing is to show the audience why we should care about the story through events that build substantial characters. I feel like I'm watching the events of a reality TV show in space. Yeah, the Real Housewives of Space. Or better yet, the constant spray of debris reminds me of NASCAR or the insane car chases we see in World's Wildest Police Videos.

I can't stand the film score. It's like a trailer for a Michael Bay movie. The movie is so much worse than Armageddon with Bruce Willis. At least the mediocre drama was backed up by real human relationships. I understand the director/writer Alfonso Cuaron must've tried to do something ""different"" with this movie and build suspense and create emotion by doing very little in the way of story development in a minimalistic sense, but I have to ask ""why?"" It only adds to the sea of trash movies out there where there is no basis behind the maudlin dialogue and ridiculous scenarios the audience and characters are subjected to. If I were to compare this to 2001: A Space Odyssey, it would be like the horrible and inept low budget rip offs that you see packed 8 together in the $5 bin at Walmart.",1433548800,7,1817,4.642857142857143

I had initially put off watching Gravity because I couldn't imagine how it would be interesting to watch two people drifting through space. However, the suspense, action, and and surprisingly fast pace immediately hooked me in. It was not what I was anticipating. It was much, much better. I'm also a science teacher, so it was very enjoyable to view a movie that intentionally tried to keep the physics accurate. There were still some ""Hollywood Physics"" taking place in the movie, but not to the extent that they crossed over the threshold of enjoyment and became distracting/annoying.",1432166400,2,631,5.076923076923077

5867686,3,B00DY64A3U,The visual effects of this movie are tremendous.  Clooney was great as usual. Bullock was not believable and you could tell she was acting... Sorry maybe I'm not her biggest fan.  I just don't see her as the best actor for this role. Maybe I need to watch it again.  I'm sure plenty of people will disagree with my critique but hey what can I say everyone is entitled to their opinion.,1432080000,2,385,4.319444444444445
5867687,3,B00DY64A3U,"I'll admit that watching Gravity was quite an experience, and it was unlike any other movie I've seen.  The epic space film, which earned an academy award for best director, in some ways revolutionized film making.  In other ways, however, it is a step back for the modern film era which is already largely made up of spectacles of style over substance.

Gravity is tagged under the genre ""Science Fiction"".  While it definitely seems more plausible than films like ""Alien"" or ""Star Trek"", ultimately it is a stylized foray into space disaster with a number of physics errors that even the average Joe would notice.  Probably the most egregious issue is the position of the two space stations Stone uses for her survival.  Space (even within our immediate orbit) is huge!  If one space station is floating over Australia, the other could very well be over Canada.  So going from one to the other within an hour is like walking between those two countries within that time.  Less fantastic, but still very noticeable, is the way the debris seems to sling shot around in orbit and take out each craft in a highly specified time interval.  In real life, I'm would think that the chain reaction of exploding satellites would expand rather than act as a confined cloud with a mind of its own.  All this and more seem to plague a film that's supposed to take the ""Fi"" out of Sci-Fi.

Well, the film isn't the most accurate, but the visuals nonetheless are stunning.  By far the Best way to watch this film is at night on a huge TV screen.  The chaotic camera work and extended shots help sell the impression of trying to survive in an impossible environment.  I especially was impressed by the opening shot which lasts about twelve minutes without a cut.  One thing I really look for in films (sometimes even more than the story, acting etc) is the way shots and images work together to create a new experience.  After all, film is a visual medium in addition to a story telling one.

Now while I do enjoy incredible visuals and scenery, ultimately a movie must have a great plot populated with complex characters.  This is where the film falls short for most viewers.  First of all, the two characters (we never really see anybody else) are rather cliched.  George Clooney is the typical cocky hero he plays in a number of his movies.  Sandra Bullock has a tragic past that haunts her and drives her quest for survival.  George's character seems more concerned about breaking a space-walk record than surviving to Earth.  Sandra's Character is far more passive yet resourceful when it comes to problem solving (which includes piloting a Chinese space craft with equipment all labeled in Chinese).  The characters are indeed a bit cheesy, but that would be forgivable if the story line was breath taking, which, by large, it is not.  When you consider there is only two outcomes (She either lives of dies, and you can probably guess which one eventually happens) there's not much opportunity for twists, character choices, or subplots at all.  Sandra's tragic past does help you connect with her character; however, it's really the only dose of character development we get in the whole film.  Pretty images can only take a movies so far; it's the icing on the cake.  We need a compelling story which Gravity mostly does not have.

It's nice to see such a different film receive nominations at the Oscars.  Like I said, it's a very unique experience, but I just wish it was more unique with it's plot and story.",1432080000,,3505,4.687397708674305

5867708,4,B00DY64A3U,"** possible spoiler alert**
With all the arguments about the plausibility of this movie, nobody seems to question the fact that objects moving in the same orbit move at the same speed.  Go faster, go higher.  Go slower, go lower.  Ask Buzz Aldrin.  So even IF, the exploding satellite debris had come at the ship and station at that speed, and done that much damage - it would have been on its way up, and wouldn't have come around again in the same path.  In order to remain in the same orbit altitude, the stuff would have to be moving the same speed as the shuttle, not hundreds or thousands of miles per hour faster.  And George Clooney had no reason to let go, a simple tug in zeroG would have brought him back from the end of the rope, but the movie makes it look like he's dangling over a cliff.  As unlikely as the rest of it is, it's still a hell of a great movie - that never leaves the POV of Sandra Bullock's character, so you're trapped exactly where she is at all times - no teams of people on the ground working on a rescue, no newspaper reporters... nothing.  You're stuck in orbit by yourself.  Suspend some of the orbital laws of physics and enjoy it.  And space junk is a real danger, it just won't happen the way the movie portrayed it.  Again 4 stars, not 5 because I can't imagine a rewatch just yet.",1431648000,,1322,4.227091633466135

5867741,3,B00DY64A3U,"After hearing plenty of raving about this production, I finally managed to get hold of a library copy. And I found that the very thing I most feared might be the case, was indeed true. It's the same problem I've seen with so many sci-fi movies of the last couple of decades. The special effects are simply overdone to the point of being beyond ludicrous. I don't know, for one thing, how Neil Tyson can pick at the nits he does when commenting on this, yet completely ignore the stupid stuff that is right in his face. For example, when Dr Stone and her accomplices are maneuvering around the ISS and the other vehicles and get tangled up in a line or something like that, they get bashed around so much that every bone in their bodies would get broken, not to mention that there's no way the space suits could fail to spring leaks under such punishment. At times, it began to look a bit like slapstick comedy, it was so extreme. And when a shower of orbital debris comes along and starts destroying things--in reality, if there was enough space junk to be close enough to see multiple pieces of it...well, you wouldn't see it, because you'd be blown to bits by any of the thousands of little bits too small to even see, that would be along with the bigger stuff. Besides, it would be moving so fast that you wouldn't even see the vast majority of objects.

Sci-fi movies have always been full of stupid, implausible stuff of various types. But these insane Fx seem to be mostly a product of the last couple of decades. They are, IMO, the one-ton elephant in the middle of the room. To me, this Fx Xs is a bit analogous to the ""loudness wars"" that have gotten out of hand in music recordings, where digital processing has made it possible to make average sound levels higher than ever without overt distortion that would simply turn the music to mud; but in the process, any real dynamic range is eliminated, thus squeezing all the life out of a recording.

For me, this Fx issue was so extreme that it was hard to fix my attention on other aspects--the story, the acting, the dialogue, and so on--that may have actually been quite good.",1431129600,,2137,4.448979591836735

Clooney is more a lengthy cameo appearance in my opinion.  Cinematography is amazing.  The pace is desperate from the start and the ending is no exception. More than a space adventure. there is some character development.  Not sure it worked as well as the directors et al hoped though.  Felt like an add on to make it more than SFX.,1428969600,,467,4.5

5867872,5,B00DY64A3U,"At this point in time GRAVITY in Dolby Atmos is definitely the state-of-the-art reference disc. I listened to other Dolby Atmos titles on Blu-ray, but not even Dolby's own demonstration disc from August 2014 comes close to it.

The opening sequence with the title cards builts up soundwise to an overwhelming crescendo, but never before did I experience anything like that in my home theatre: It felt like the sound was physically suffocating me while the walls contracted, in none of my previous viewings of GRAVITY had the abrupt ending of the noise such a feeling of relief.

Naturally, where there is air there is sound, so the most convincing Dolby Atmos examples, IMHO, were inside the space stations which felt like not only those but the walls of my home theatre room, too, were coming apart, the fire was very immersive (almost making me wish to have brought a fire extinguisher along) as was the water pouring in at the end, and, last but not least, the insects humming above Sandra Bullock and myself in my home theatre.

This release finally showcases what Dolby Atmos is capable of, once engineered by able sound technicians. Very impressive.

Of course, film music is the ""salt"" to enhance the emotional experience of the film, but the ""Silent Space Version"" had plenty of merits, and I'd instantly recommend this version to anyone, who considered the original film to be too ""aggressive"" in terms of sound and music. Once the orbital debris starts hitting the Space Shuttle Explorer and the Hubble Telescope, instead of hectic music we'll now hear hectic voices from Houston and elsewhere which graphically convey the sense of danger and are in interesting substitute for (now) the lack of music. In general dialogues are much clearer and better discernible because there are no other distractions, other than heartbeats.

But most certainly, there is no music when we see Earth above George Clooney and Sandra Bullock's comment (""I love the silence"") makes much more sense and fits better with this version of the film. Frankly, this will be the version, I'm confident my mother will find more palatable when she comes to visit next time and to watch the film.

Regarding the bonus features I can't help but strongly recommend the little extra, featuring the eskimo Sandra Bullock was talking to in the film. In the film we only witnessed the conversation from her point of view, now we get the chance to witness their conversation from his point of view and what he was actually talking about. A little gem I'd consider a must-see.

And I also loved the Blu-ray packing with its ""monolithic"" character. By the way, I would love to see 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY re-released in the same kind of packing this release of GRAVITY arrived in.",1428883200,2,2749,4.848614072494669

Ms Bullock turns in another outstanding performance. A great character portrayal. Mr. Clooney does a very respectable job. Unfortunately, his role was all too short. I really enjoyed his character's bantering which off sets some of the tension in the short story line. Spoiler alert: Sparks do not fly between the two leads.

5867984,5,B00DY64A3U,"Sandra Bullock offers a brilliant performance in this $100 million extravaganza that capitulate the drama of a woman in space struggling at all odds to survive the tedious journey. The trouble starts during a spacewalk to Hubble Telescope when a Russian missile strike a defunct satellite which creates a serious hazardous situation for astronaut Stone (Bullock) and her partner in space astronaut Kowalski (George Clooney). The entire movie runs through the various scenarios where Dr. Stone keeps up with the danger until she successfully re-enters the atmosphere and lands in a lake. This is mainly Sandra Bullock movie where Clooney plays a supporting actor. Produced at such a record amount, much of the scenes were done using computer-generated imagery for the spacewalk scenes and automotive robots to move the astronauts. The production team found it enormously challenging to do the shooting in weightless environment.

The film was directed, co-written, and produced by Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n. At the 86th Academy Awards; it was honored with ten nominations with Cuar&oacute;n winning in the best director category.

5868019,5,B00DY64A3U,"This ""Diamond-Luxe"" Edition of ""Gravity"" comes in a spiffy new case with a fold-out picture book.  The primary difference is an additional audio option.  For viewers with the proper home theater set up (speakers and processor) you can choose to have the Dolby Atmos (7.1.4).  Without technical elaboration, that includes 7 normal speakers (2 front, center, 2 surround, 2 back), 1 subwoofer and 4 Atmos speakers.  This is very new technology for home theaters and hasn't been around too long at the multiplex either.  The 4 additional speakers essentially fire up toward the ceiling.  They can be acquired as add-ons which would sit on your 2 front and 2 surrounds or some manufacturers have released Atmos specific designs.  There are also a host of Dolby Digital options in various languages and even more languages with subtitles, some even with an SDH option.  Here's a review of the film and the 3-D version:

Most movie lovers can remember seeing a film for the first time that really got their attention. Usually it was in a real movie theater. For me it was ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" The juxtaposition of a flung femur bone transfiguring into a space shuttle lining up to dock at an orbiting station, all to the backdrop of classical music was mind blowing to this science fiction lover. A few year later, sitting in a large theater I was again mesmerized by a giant space ship moving slowly across dark space. ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" had a new technical trick at its disposal. Dolby Surround Sound. A new generation will likely have ""Gravity"" to look back on. Yes, it's that good.

Director Alfonso Cuaron (""Children of Men""), who also wrote the screenplay with his son Jonas, has managed to provide an electrifying thriller with a basic story. A flight crew headed by Lt. (a lieutenant, really?) Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) have been sent to repair the Hubble Telescope. The scientist in charge of the repairs is the ever-so-serious Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock). There are no other actors who have any role of substance other than the voice of Ed Harris at Mission Control early on.

In a quick turn of events, it is learned that the Russians have destroyed one of their spy satellites. The explosion has set off a chain reaction of debris hurtling through space taking out other satellites along the way. With only minutes to react, Kowalski's crew attempt to get the shuttle out of orbit. They don't. Now in survival mode, Kowalski and Stone must figure out how to get back to Earth. This becomes even more complicated, as radio communication with Mission Control has been severed.

Cuaron provides Sandra Bullock an opportunity to show her acting range and she responds with a performance that will be remembered for a long time. Stone's early panic, as the space debris knocks her away from Kowalski and the shuttle, comes across to the audience. We see the terror in her eyes, in her breathing and in the fogging helmet shield. The other star of the film is Cuaron's cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki and the visual and special effects department. It is the most amazing thing I think I've ever seen on screen. And yes, see it now. Don't wait for this movie to come to you by Netflix. And yes, see it in 3D. I pick and choose when to spend an extra $3 or $4 dollars on 3D and I made the right decision here.

Gravity has several meanings. The most used and obvious one for this movie has to do with the force of bodies falling toward Earth. But gravity also is defined as a serious or critical nature. Also, serious or dignified behavior. All apply. Cuaron and his team will likely need a truck to load nominations come Oscar time. Don't miss it.

BLU RAY UPDATE: I recently acquired a 3D television and having swooned over this film (3D) in theaters last fall, I couldn't think of a better movie to test out the display. It didn't disappoint. The package includes 3D and 2D options (separate discs) and a DVD. It also includes a digital HD (Ultraviolet) download. The special features are on the 2D disc.

I'm not surprised that the film retains the awe-inspiring luster of the theatrical version. It comes with 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio. The 3D, much like the big screen version uses the extra dimension to create depth of space which is certainly appropriate for a film which takes place in space orbiting around Earth. The color and sometimes lack of, is excellent along with deep, dark blacks. Shadows are in proper contrast and detail is remarkable. Check out hair stubble on Clooney's face and watch Bullock as she strains, once reaching the temporary safety of the International Space Station. Her neck muscles stretch and relax. Great acting and great cinematography. I can't say enough about the 3D element here. Frankly, I'm not a big fan as a rule. Still there are a few that get it right (""Avatar"" and ""Hugo"" come to mind). ""Gravity"" joins the club. While I did not watch the 2D version from beginning to end, I did see enough to that nothing is lost other than the depth. In either case, the discs are demo quality.

Likewise the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is flawless. It does a perfect job handling the big collision scenes and the subwoofer certainly got a workout in that regard along with the surrounds. But there are other elements well played out that I didn't notice as much the first time around. First is the use of silence. Director Cuaron and his Oscar winning sound squad have done a marvelous job, not only creating some unusual sounds but have integrated them beautifully into the various elements of the film. One second there are loud collisions, total silence the next. The sound of small fires starting and the whoosh of a fire extinguisher or a jet propulsion pack. It's just incredible. The other major element so important in the film is the soundtrack by another Oscar winner, Steven Price. It never resorts to an overabundance of strings, but it emphasizes the emotions and terrors of the moment. The lossless audio track handles it perfectly. Subtitles are available in English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.

My bladder almost burst because I would not leave the room nor would I even hit the 'pause' button...I just couldn't bear the thought of doing anything but watching with rapt attention until Ms. Bullock let me go.  Amazing!  I should, in all honesty point out that on second viewing I encountered a disturbing bit of discontinuity, but I'm not going to say more than that for two reasons...first, I don't like spoilers and won't become one; second, I found that within seconds after noting the gaff I'd forgotten about it and was swept back into the action, so I guess it's not all that important.

It's just an experiment in having a movie that only builds up tension and then creates a catastrophe--over and over and over and over again.

Well even 2 hours (felt like 3) of Sandra Bullock floating about in her short-shorts can't save this movie unless you bought it specifically to see Sandra Bullock floating about in short-shorts (then its a five start movie). The script involves stealing a series of sub-plots from previous really good classic Sci-Fi movies like Mission to Mars and Red Planet and trying to expand these minor plots into a full movie. The previous writers should sue for plagiarism! So two hours of Sandra hopping from one space station to the next milliseconds before each ones destruction, and seconds after her air runs out (she has good lungs), over, and over, to finally ride the Chinese station back to earth. The premise is ludicrous, her command of Russian and Chinese and technical knowledge of 3 different types of space stations is so unlikely and far fetched especially for someone who we are repeatedly told failed to master her own shuttle controls (marked in English) during mission training. As you can guess she gets it perfect when the chips are down (is there a down in space?). Resist the urge to run out and buy this movie.",1426377600,20,1303,4.6943231441048034

The science has been scrutinized, and rightfully so, but the critical vision of two particular souls disconnected from humanitys current home is the source of this films power.  Alfonso Cuarn directs a technical masterpiece which in this age of overinflated ticket prices for 3D and IMAX screenings, Gravity warrants the enveloping big screen experience, not to mention the immersive theater sound allowing appreciation of the now Oscar nominated score by Steven Price.

5868106,3,B00DY64A3U,"I was frankly quite surprised when I finished watching this movie and felt disappointed. It's easy to trace the source of that disappointment. It springs from the fact that many years ago, Stanley Kubrick did all this so much better with 2001 A Space Odyssey. Obviously, there is much more going on with Gravity, but as soon as disaster strikes, and by 1/3 of the way through the movie, you realize that there is only one way the movie can end. One thing the art department and the director should have learned from Kubrick is to keep it simple. Wildly gyrating stuff and actors in a totally unfamiliar environment, is very, very hard to track with your eye.

The director broke one of Kubrick's ironclad rules. You can't hear anything in space. It's not that stuff and actors made a lot of noise in space, but the musical soundtrack was totally too loud. Nothing at all would have been better, a la Kubrick, in his most dramatic scenes.

Overall, the wealth of detail of space station, Hubble telescope, escape vehicles, and earth views from outer space could  not make up for the sparsity of interest with only 2 characters. (That, I hope, is my only spoiler.)",1425772800,,1162,4.631067961165049

5868234,5,B00DY64A3U,"Gravity is a masterpiece!

WARNING: the following, is filled with SPOILERS. So if you haven't seen this film, you might not want to read the rest of this review.

All the harsh critics who love pointing out the scientific ""flaws"" in Gravity, are missing the entire point of the film.

It's important to note that Gravity is NOT a documentary or even a docudrama about astronauts and a tragic EVA mission. It was never intended to be either of those things. This film is an amazingly conveyed story about a parent recovering from the death of her child. All of the ""peril in space"" is incidental.

The action largely serves as metaphor for the obstacles Sandra Bullock's character must overcome, in order to let go of her crippling grief and to move forward. It depicts her struggle to regain control of her life, using the action as a storytelling device.

Clooney tells her that she needs to ""learn to let go"". Indeed, letting go is the primary theme of the film. She's a woman adrift in her own life, and this is reflected by her plight in orbit. The director uses ""poetic license"" for a lot of the science, in order to tell her story and make it visually thrilling for the audience.

At one point, she exclaims ""The tether broke! I'm detached! What do I do?!"" This dialogue is very important. In fact, from the very first moment her character appears, she exhibits a personality which is emotionally ""detached"" from everyone around her.

When Clooney sacrifices himself, it might not be scientifically accurate, but it does serve two important purposes. It demonstrates that she is unable to ""let go"", even when she's told that her very life depends on it. And it places her in the position of being alone, having to cope with everything on her own. Again, this was poetic license on behalf of the writer/director.

I also love how it repeatedly shows her pouring through instruction manuals. These sequences depict her ""learning"" how to make progress, until she decides that she's not going to give up.

The scene where she finally reaches this decision is beautifully realized. They show her in a state of oxygen deprivation, in which she hallucinates the return of Clooney (who represents her unconscious mind). It's essentially Bullock telling herself that life is worth living, and remembering previously compartmentalized information that will allow her to survive (prompting her to re-purpose the soft landing jets).

During the conversation, she's told that she needs to ""plant both feet on the ground and start living life"". And this is what we see in the final shot of the film. Her water landing, sinking and resurfacing (after nearly drowning), symbolizes her ""rebirth"". This is further illustrated by the shedding of her spacesuit, and emergence from the water in a near nude state.

Of course she wouldn't be able to immediately walk, or even stand, after spending so much time in a zero gravity environment (more poetic license). But the final shot is really a beauty, showing a close-up of her feet, as she firmly plants them, and takes several steps forward (moving forward with her life)...just as she unconsciously instructed herself, only minutes earlier.

Gravity is a beautifully crafted and exceedingly well told story. In this sense, it IS a perfect film. It's very sad, that so many people dismiss the film as being overrated, boring or scientifically inaccurate. And I'm sorry to see that Neil deGrasse Tyson has failed to embrace the poetry, by nitpicking it. As I said, the movie was never intended to be a documentary.

I did see a video, where he DOES say that he enjoyed it. But in the same video, he craps on the director's decisions, regarding the scientific inaccuracies...basically shrugging off the symbolism and poetic license.

I hold scientific accuracy to be very important. But in the case of Gravity, I truly believe it deserves a pass.

And now, I will humbly ask all the Gravity detractors to give the film one more view. Only this time, please look at it with my review in mind. Naturally, this is just a request. I would never attempt to impose on anyone, a task they have absolutely no desire to undertake.

If anything, Gravity is very underrated. As I said at the beginning of this review, it's a masterpiece!",1424822400,,4261,4.824417009602195

5868268,3,B00DY64A3U,"Bullock and Clooney take you on one of the most exhilarating yet terrifying ride an astronaut could ever encounter. Working outside the space capsule on space walk rendezvous can be disastrous, even deadly, if you become untethered as Clooney did. He would have slowly drifted away without an attached propulsion system. Even with self-propulsion, the system can fail or run out of its limited propellant supply, and the astronaut will keep floating off into space. The International Space Station (ISS) is not able to chase someone down. If the shuttle were docked, it would take too long to undock and mount a rescue. In that nightmare scenario, Clooney would likely have several hours of oxygen to contemplate the end. As long as the suit is intact, pressure will not be an issue. Either oxygen will run out or the system that removes exhaled carbon dioxide will stop working. Either way, Clooney would suffocate and continue on his way out into the vast, empty space. Another hazard that could hasten his demise is if a micrometeoroid (4mm or larger), traveling over 22,000 mph, hit and penetrated his suit. If he could not reach and patch the hole in time, oxygen rushes out. Without pressure in the suit, the liquid parts of the tongue and eyes begins to bubble and all saliva, blood, and internal fluids begin to boil. What causes blood to boil in space? The idea that blood would boil is a misnomer, because it has nothing to do with heat, it's the sudden loss of atmospheric pressure - a vacuum. Without pressure, liquid fluids convert into a gaseous state. From industrial accidents in vacuum chambers, we've learned that you cannot survive much beyond a minute. In  a vacuum, there is not enough oxygen, so the nitrogen that is saturated in your blood and tissues comes out of solution (forming nitrogen gas). This causes bubbles to form, known as decompression sickness. Also if you hold your breath, you can get what is called pulmonary over-inflation and your lung ruptures into your blood stream, known as an embolism. In the movie, the team have been on a week-long sojourn, performing exacting maintenance repairs on the Hubble Space Telescope. New instrumentation was installed, including the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) with enhanced infrared sensitivity. The Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) and Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) were repaired. The Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) was restored to its near full functionality. Basic maintenance such as the replacement of the gyroscopes and batteries were done. The milieu was halcyon until NASA suddenly declared an exigency and commanded that their operation be truncated or aborted, immediately. Reports have come from NORAD that a Russian satellite has incurred a strike from their own missile. The impact has created a cloud of debris orbiting at 17,000 mph and making a complete orbit every 90 minutes. The blasting and destruction of this defunct Russian spy satellite dispersed its remnants into fragments. The high velocity travel of these fragments impact still other satellites in propinquity. This, in turn, led to a disastrous series of cascading, chain reactions of annihilating more and more satellites and the circulation of fragments/shrapnel in larger expanses (it's sci--fi). This debris or shrapnel was on a trajectory path in the direction of the Explorer Shuttle. The storm of shrapnel passing caused catastrophic damage and decimated the Explorer, rendering it vitiate, inoperable and all bedlam, pandemonium broke loose. Their equanimity, virtuosity, and volition are put to the ultimate test, and their only hope is in reaching the ISS. The ISS varies between 205 and 270 miles above Earth, and it orbits 15 times in a 24-hour day. Due to the retirement of the U.S. Space Shuttle program, Russian rockets are the only means of travel to the ISS.",1424390400,,3851,5.093354430379747

I can understand the fear and fright of somebody in Sandra Bullock's situation, but she behaves as if she hardly has a clue as to what to do and barely responds to crisis after crisis in time to take action in order to save her life AlthoughI am sure many viewers would have rather she died much earlier in the movie to save us the time in this nearly plotless movie which should never get nominations for anything but a wasted opportunity.

5868358,4,B00DY64A3U,"Gravity is a mixed bag. It is far from a masterpiece, which is what many have been calling it. I won't go into the synopsis since it's been covered a dozen times over, i'll get right to it. Gravity is absolutely beautiful. Alfonso Cuaron's direction is marvelous and supreme, Steven Price's musical score is hauntingly epic and the visual effects are top-notch. But, the script and characters? Not even close to astonishing. I've seen people raving about the acting and how emotional this film is, but in all honesty, i thought this film was one of the most emotionless films ever made. Sandra Bullock's Ryan Stone was annoying, stupid and extremely unrealistic, and George Clooney's Kowalski felt like he was just there to fill in the space of a male lead (which is funny, since he doesn't have much screen time). Then, the script is decent at best. It does nothing new for the science fiction genre, or for drama, the dialogue is mediocre, and the story has been done before in other films and even in TV, just not to this extent. What i will give to Cuaron, though, is how he uses symbolism and themes like birth, rebirth and evolution (the most famous scene being Stone floating in zero-G, symbolizing a womb).

I don't hate Gravity, but i refuse to call it a masterpiece, for that it is not. But i will not deny the film's beauty and technical achievements in filmmaking, especially the extended 'long-shot' sequence at the start of the film.",1423526400,,1447,4.674509803921569

I felt like I was sitting through three hours of Sandra Bullock's character contemplating suicide, then trying to find a way to save herself, then contemplating suicide again, and finally trying to save herself again.

5868410,3,B00DY64A3U,"OK movie for a single view, but I found serious shortcomings in the movie as portraying itself as 'real.'  It was not.  The worst thing was their using 'sound' in space (space does not carry sound).  The director felt sound was needed to make the movie more dramatic.  Well, the Kubric movie ""2001"" was realistic, and Kubric used the lack of sound in space to great dramatic effect.  Which goes to show this director is inferior and does not care one whit about science OR reality - both of which are missing.  The whole thing becomes wildly unrealistic very rapidly.  Concept was good but poorly implemented - could have been no science advisers on set.  It was all about the 3D and the special effects (very noisy!  In space!).  Reality is nowhere to be seen.",1423008000,,761,4.57037037037037
5868411,1,B00DY64A3U,"I had seen Bullock on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno and he was raving about the movie and in the 3D format.  I am a big fan of 3D and it was with great expectation that I ordered this film.  However my excitement was short lived.  The 3D was minimal or non-existent and in fact the movie seemed better visually in 2D.  I later found out that this movie was not filmed in 3D but made 3D in post production.  This does not come up to the level of Pacific Rim, Avatar or the best 3D movie I have seen, Guardians Of The Galaxy which also had the 3D done in post.

The soundtrack was also a major disappointment.  In the beginning when Bullock and Clooney are working on the Hubble, there is the most annoying bass thump I have ever heard that made no sense other than maybe it was supposed to be Bullock's heartbeat.  This ruined the Bluray for me as I could not stand the annoying sounds coming from my subwoofers.

I can not believe that Academy was raving about this film and looking to heap honors on it... Oh well.. I guess we mere mortals will never figure Hollywood out.  Beware of the upcoming release of Interstellar.  I am a great fan of both Christopher Nolan films and also of actor Matthew McConaughey.  Saw this movie in the theater and it was not the film the trailers would lead you to believe it was.  I was so disappointed and bored with the movie.  I am also a big fan of Hans Zimmer scores like Inception and the Batman trilogy that I was amazed and how boring and lackluster the score is.

No. The acting is less that phenominal, unless you count Sandra Bullock breathing for 30 minutes as acting. Definetly would recommend for a large TV if you must watch it. Please don't.

5868490,5,B00DY64A3U,"This movie has many visual effects that the  average person would consider breath-taking yet believable having seen many of the ""shots"" from real life Space Shuttle and other videos of today. It allowed the viewer to experience them in a unique way however, actually having feel of the lack of gravity. The movie had a hidden ""pholosophical"" undertone that was buried in the video experience. The distress of the characters - and the simplicity (only really 2 charactiers) leant to a very personal relationship.  The writer/producer/directors of this movie were conveying many hidden meanings (the floating fetal position, et al). It was ultimately a story of the ""will to live"" - ""to survive"", and the willingness to accept an end when all hope seemed lost (the Chinese capsule - shutting down the air) only to have something deep inside rejuvinate her spirit.  The title ""Gravity"" seemed to refer to the ""lack"" of gravity throughout.  I must admit the ""luck"" involved in the capsule separating and finding its way back to Terra Firma was a bit unfathomable - being oriented properly so as to enter with heat-shields down and such.  But artistic license toward the climax made it acceptible.  In the end the true basis for the title ""Gravity"" became totally clear as she crawled to the shoreling and struggled to stand up - ah - the beauty of the gravity so many complain about as things drop to be picked up. She loved ""Gravity"" that point and we see its importance suddenly.  Sandra Bullock, her good looks aside, is an amazing actress who filled the bill well. Clooney was excellent if not complete himself, albeit in a space suit.  The use of a female astronaut was a good move, showing the strength of a woman and how a man complimented her instincts to survive. I watched the DVD 3 times, once alone - taking in mostly the effects as such video experiences will do and not really absorbing the meaning or plot.  The second time with the wife, she loved it. I worried that a Sy-Fy flick like this would not appeal to her (she likes fun family, chick-flicks normally.  She enjoyed a lot (a surprise to me). The third time I had my brother in law over and we watched it together, I pretending I hadn't seen it yet.  He was enthralled with the story and effects.  In the end, we showed it to the group of seniors here at the senior condo. The minimal, but appropriate, cursing by Bullock when in dire straits was not offensive with an occasion Sh.. and F..k done very quietly and in a moment of fear.
Our  Monday evening entertainment night showing went very well.  All seemed to enjoy it on the 75 inch screen.  My unit has a 57-inch with surround sound so it was very enjoyable there too.  This movie uses almost no sub-bass so a decent sound system is adequate. Surround adds a little with some audio shooting from behind - but not too much. It is well produced for a quality visual and audio experience without expensive gear.  I highly recommend it.",1421712000,,2957,4.623326959847036

George Clooney floats around in space and disconnects his tether from Bullock, for what seems to be no apparent reason other than....hey, okay I'll float over here now...and die. And poor untrained girl that Sandra Bullock is, she is expected to land herself back on earth using an instruction manual that looks like a DVD information brochure, or better still and old PacMan game instruction manual from the 80s. I kept asking myself: what would it take to make it better....different music...more characters...""gravity"" -- as in something anchored somewhere....and then I figured out what is missing: a plot! PLEASE. These actors are two of my favorites -- absolutely wonderful A-list talent. WHY did they take roles in what is such a contrived, hype-filled movie? At least I can rest easy in the notion that there will be no sequel, at least I hope so. What would you call it? Bounce? Float? Adrift? Dumb and Dumber.

5868551,3,B00DY64A3U,"I wrote, and re-wrote a review of this movie at least 3 times and this 3 star ""It's Ok"" rating is an astronomical stretch. but the next rating of choice was I don't like it.  If I rated, 2, ""I don't like it"", that would be untrue.  I stayed attentive to the whole movie and while I was more than a little pissed off on several levels, it did not rate ""I don't like it"" with me.  I would NOT recommend it and hope if someone wanted to see it, at least wait until it is showing on a Showtime/HBO or TNT/FX level of programming. Certainly don't pay money for it.  Well unless you want to waste Viggle points or other nonredeemable and worthless entertainment promotional offerings that are essentially worthless.

Sandra Bullock is the primary character in a stranded in space type of movie , where if it could go wrong, it does.  Kind of like a ""Hey, we're in space preview or announcement of Murphy's Law.

No doubt, those 10 academy awards came in the special effects department.  After about a half an hour, I was confident I could have scripted the movie myself -- and no one will be paying me to script movies any time soon.

First, it uses the newer Dolby Atmos standard, which probably will produce better sound (and surround sound) overall.

None of us liked it. There are times we laughed out loud. The plot is utterly cliched, you knew exactly what was going to happen, and didn't feel at all for the 2 main characters. And for the empty silent void of outer space, the soundtrack was especially loud and annoying.

The moments of suspense just weren't very suspenseful; the performances and script were predictable.

It's all about two people in space with a problem with their spacecraft and sacrifices must be made but I find it too drawn out that if I can prepare tea and cook it, than still find it not interesting than what can I say. If you relax with feet up you'll fall asleep so don't bother with the popcorn find something with life in it. Being made in space and we all know everything goes slow well I found the movie was the same pace. There is a bit of drama some silly errors are made by the crew so that gives it a tick as that is the action part. I rated this an B grade and that was the merits the cast did a terrific job performing the roles. It's only my opinion and you are quite welcome to see for yourself and be a judge.

5868769,2,B00DY64A3U,"This was said to be the best picture of 2013? Really?!

Ok so many people were shocked about the fact that I didn't bother to see this film in theaters. They said it was the best one of the entire year, apparently the Academy didn't think so and neither did I. I will not deny that the special effects were quite astounding, I never would have guessed that most of this film was done via green screen. The soundtrack by Stephen Price was excellent as well, adding to the grandeur and epicness of the film. The acting and story on the other hand is the film's shortcoming. I didn't find any of the characters engaging, nor did I find the story to be anything special. When I go to movies I expect everything to be great. I didn't even have such high expectations for this film when I finally saw it on television. So, I still am trying to figure out why so many people back this film, If it is the special effects then you clearly are not as deep of a film appreciator as you think you are.

This film is still worth a view if only once. Still, far from great and far from what so many have claimed it to be.",1419379200,4,1107,4.144186046511628

George Clooney acting, as usual, just like George Clooney, appears to have the emotional depth of a frat boy talking about his conquests while another astronaut tries out for Cirque du Soleil on the tether. Sandra Bullock reprises her stunning Oscar-worthy performances in the Speed franchises. That's about it.

NASA must have been desperate for astronauts on this mission because they chose frivolous and unbalanced people who never should have been allowed to leave earth. Not one of them evokes any feelings other than boredom and bewilderment.

Early in the movie, there is a voice-over about the fact that it is so very empty out there in space, strong evidence of the young and ill-informed audience this miserable, plotless, and silly film is intended for.

While the setting is in space, this is far from just a space movie (ok there's going to be a ""small"" spoiler, if there is such a one).  This is a story of crisis and change, a story of self-redemption and rebirth(the very last scene is a total give-away).  Matt K's (George C) farewell is anything but maudlin - but a reaffirmation of life in the face of certain demise - and his re-appearance is just perfectly executed by George, the director and writers.  Yes the special effects are amazing, but this film is far more than eye-candy (although Sandra helps) the acting is superb.  This one of those films that each time I see it I see/hear something  additional - almost like revealing Easter eggs in classic MS Office.  I may be guilty of over-thinking / analysing this film - but it's one of the very few that I've recently seen that continues to engage me long after the closing credits have rolled by.

5868816,4,B00DY64A3U,"I thought the special effects were pretty amazing.  There is some inaccuracy on the 'non-fiction' side though.  Some of the physics is incorrect, i.e. gravity when there shouldn't be, and a few in particular have profound impact on the story.  So, to enjoy this, one needs to leave their physics book closed and just enjoy it for what it is.  Similar issues with NASA authenticity and space life in general.  The lead character is cast as a payload specialist and somehow manages to operate an amazing array of... well, things.  I don't want to spoil it for you.

As to the plot, I found it very soft.  Actually pretty typical for an action movie.  The end of the movie had me wanting for more character development.  And, at 1-1/2 hours, the end comes a little too soon in my opinion.

So, it's one of those movies that is probably worth seeing once for the thrill, but not really something I would watch a second time.  Sorry to say that.  I think if they had added some pretext to the beginning of the movie and something on the end, it would have been more satisfying.",1418860800,2,1072,4.463917525773196

5868849,4,B00DY64A3U,"If you are going to see the movie, Gravity, try to see it in 3-D, because it makes a world of difference. The movie is long gone at this time from the movie theaters, so that means renting it, as well as owning a set capable of showing 3-D movies. The 3-D adds a lot of depth to the screen, which helps in the illusion of being in outer space.  And the movie producers don't give in much to the 3-D gimmick of having things hurtling toward the screen to end up in your lap. That is just a 3-D gimmick and sometimes overused. Instead, the 3-D adds a very nice dimension of depth and, well, space.

And since thre is no oneto watch except Sandra Bullock for at least two-thirds of the movie, it helps if you can watch it in 3-D. Not that Sandra Bullock is not worth watching, she is. But in that really bulky space suit and helmet, there's not much of her to watch. The storyline is pretty straight forward: she and fellow astronaut George Clooney are in space to do some repairs, when they get the word that a Russian satellite has basically blown up, and its debris is at the same altitude and position in space as they are, excedpt on th4e3 other side of the world.  And the space junk is roaring at them at a speed of thosuands of miles an hour. Some of the debris hits them and causes damage that they try to repair. During this, Clooney is set adrift and Bullock is left alone to try and save herself. How that goes I can't say as that would spoil the storyline. But its kind of a space version of the Perils of Pauline. My wife and I both enjoyed it, but don't think we will be watching it again for a long time -- it's pretty suspensful and emotionally draining if you get caught up in it, as we did.",1418688000,2,1706,4.132530120481928

5868998,5,B00DY64A3U,"It's strange to me that most people saw this as basically a space movie or science fiction story.  To me it seemed like a brilliant allegory about recovery from mental illness and transformation through grief, that happened to take the form of a science fiction story.  As someone who has struggled with depression and anxiety disorder - in part because of my own losses of people I love - I cannot envision an more apt experiential metaphor for what it feels like ... or doesn't feel like (because depression is really more of a flat line of experience) than the black vacuum of space.  For the entire first part of this film, Sandra Bullock's character is enclosed inside a suit, and in many ways, sealed inside her own head.  It's amazing to me that so many people whine about a ""lack of character development,"" when her character was clearly meant to stand in for any woman or man who has experienced a devastating loss.

When she is spinning out of control, un-tethered and floating into space - that is *exactly* what mental illness feels like when it gets you in its undertow.  You reach a point where you believe you may never make it back to earth, never feel grounded again, and like nothing can ever reach you ...

This is really a story about a woman reaching inside herself--and out--and through to the spirit world (her near-death experience), and finding the courage to decide to live again, and come back from the abyss to rejoin the world of the living.  She does this not by turning her back on her grief or fear, but by embracing it.  When she tries to commit suicide, she has an experience which you could choose to see as hallucination or divine intervention - either way, it salvages her life and arguably her soul.  She is spiritually reborn (womb-like imagery surfaces several times during the film), and in the end, we see her finally walk on her own feet again, ready to face the world.  There doesn't *need* to be a ""15 minutes later.""  The 15 minutes later is whatever she chooses to make of it - and whatever you do, if you find yourself facing such a challenge in your own life.

When I saw this film, it gave me something to anchor myself to - which was ironic.  Even watching the trailer I knew that this movie would be an anxiety-inducing experience for me.  The reality is, each of us is hurtling through existence just barely hanging onto each other and that black abyss of space really is always there, hovering right beside us and sometimes inside us.  This movie is about staring at that void and through it, and choosing to live despite the terror which is always there just under the surface, reminding us we can always burn up in flames or lose those closest to us.

And those are just my comments on the story.  Add to that some of the most spectacular special effects, filming and directing choices I've ever seen, and an absolutely revolutionary soundtrack and you have yourself one incredible journey into the human spirit.  Watching this film was actually a magickal experience for me ... it felt like more than just a film to me--a transformational vehicle.  This film does everything it can to truly put you in Bullock's head.  Allow yourself to really be taken on her journey, and it will change you for the better.",1417564800,13,3264,4.573883161512027

For a full five minutes all she makes are uuugh, ohhh...and other sounds as she is being bounced off metal pieces-never getting a scratch. Later, she gets to Russian spacecraft, saving herself from a fire, then in shades of James Bond she breaks into a Chinese Space Station using a fire extinguisher  as propulsion in space! SERIOUSLY!

5869034,4,B00DY64A3U,"Note: I'm updating this review as I've now had a chance to spend some quality time with this ""Diamond Luxe"" Special Edition Blu-ray Disc. See ""4/1/15 Update"" section below for my impressions of the actual ""Gravity"" Special Edition Blu-ray Disc with Dolby Atmos. I've left my original review intact here for posterity as my commentary (3D vs. Dolby Atmos) is still valid.

Original review (pre-release):

""Gravity"" is an intense audio and video experience, and an enjoyable film overall which is enhanced through the use of both 3D and Dolby Atmos surround. So why does the studio make us pick one or the other? The initial release of ""Gravity"" on Blu-ray is available in 3D, but with only a 5.1-channel soundtrack. It's a great-looking and sounding disc, but lacks the immersiveness of Dolby Atmos. This ""Diamond Luxe"" edition of the film will have a Dolby Atmos mix, but is not available in 3D. Frustrating!

I saw the film two nights in a row in theaters: first in Dolby Atmos (in 3D), then in IMAX (also 3D). Both were enjoyable, but the pinpoint precision of sound available in Dolby Atmos made certain scenes -- like the opening shot with the sound slowly growing out of the vast nothingness -- so much more effective.  Also, in scenes where there are layers upon layers of sound objects on top of the powerful score, Dolby Atmos helps to keep the mix sounding both coherent and immersive. Little details and spatial cues make it all very believable.

As for the 3D, I know the live action shots were shot with a traditional camera and upconverted to 3D, but really that's only the actors' faces. The suits, backgrounds, ships, etc. are nearly all CGI creations, rendered in 3D. I would consider this more ""real"" 3D than ""fake"" 3D. Hey, if the director thinks 3D is essential to enjoyment of the film, who are we to argue? 3D is certainly effective at accentuating the peril when rogue satellites and space shrapnel are hurtling toward the viewer and when one of the astronauts is spinning out of control attached to a damaged space ship. 3D also heightens the feeling of claustrophobia in the tight spaces of the ships and space station, making the experience of what these people are going though more immediate, and more real.

C'mon, Warner, let us watch ""Gravity"" the way Alfonso Cuarn intended: in 3D *AND* Dolby Atmos!

4/1/15 Update:

Having watched this Blu-ray now a couple of times all the way through, and repeating several scenes, I have to say, my opinion hasn't changed much from the theatrical release: the Dolby Atmos soundtrack of the Blu-ray Disc is nothing short of spectacular, but I do miss the 3D. If I had to choose one, I'd pick the Dolby Atmos 2D version over a non-Atmos 3D version, hands-down. If you have a Dolby Atmos-capable system, you simply *must* get this Blu-ray Disc. I've said for a while that ""Gravity"" is the poster child of Dolby Atmos, and this Blu-ray reinforces that.

Just sit back and watch the opening scene for proof. Deep bass and effects build to a crescendo as text on screen describes the utter inhospitability of space. The sound peaks at intense levels and abruptly ends, followed by a deep enveloping silence. Out of this audio void slowly come the sounds of radio communications among astronauts and mission control personnel. Only in Dolby Atmos can you pick out the individual voices as they span the entire 3D space, side to side, top to bottom.

Comparing to my memory of the film in theaters (I saw it twice in Dolby Atmos), I think the home mix on this Blu-ray is an excellent representation of the theatrical audio. Switching over to the standard 5.1 ""Silent Space"" track, these same conversations sound jumbled. I've never thought of standard 5.1 surround sound as ""flat"" before, but it feels that way, compared to the wide open Dolby Atmos mix.

Dolby Atmos is used to good effect multiple times within the film, including that opening scene, the initial bombardment of the shuttle with space shrapnel (at about 11:00), the destruction of the International Space Station (52:39), and the final scene with buzzing insects and the sweeping music (1:22:00). The sense of 3-dimensional space is conveyed well in the Atmos mix.

As for extras, there is a whole separate disc of Special Features, but these are mostly carried over from the previous Blu-ray release (with 3 new exclusives, detailed below). The main new thing here is the ""Silent Space"" version of the film. This is a bit of a misnomer, as there are still plenty of sounds and effects (including Dr. Stone's deep throbbing heartbeat). The only thing missing is the music. It's basically what Dr. Stone would have heard from within her own spacesuit (or from inside the various crafts she enters). Frankly, to me, this is an interesting experiment, but not one that I'd enjoy for repeated viewings. The film's score  by Stephen Price is one of its highlights and I miss its presence. Without the music, the film feels a little more like a documentary and is, ultimately, less dramatic.

Also exclusive to this release are three new videos, all in HD: ""Looking to the Stars"": a 42-minute homage to space-based SciFi films; ""Gravity: The Human Element,"" an 11-minute featurette on what it takes to be a real astronaut, and ""Sandra's Birthday Wish"" a 3-minute birthday greeting from Sandra Bullock to director Alfonso Cuaron (complete with completely cheesy green screen-based visual effects). Pile on the special features from the original release and it all adds up to nearly 6 hours of bonus materials (including 90 minutes for the Silent Space version of the film). In other words, there's a lot to keep a fan busy, if you're into that sort of stuff.

All in all, it's really an excellent release with top-notch video and audio. If they had included a 3D version of the film with Dolby Atmos, it would have been a clear 5-star Blu-ray Disc set, but even without that, it's still worth a purchase.",1417392000,149,5925,4.795098039215686

5869085,5,B00DY64A3U,"There are many people who have written negative reviews about this movie. I can understand that. But a couple of people said it did not have a plot and I had to laugh and wonder where they were educated. According to Merriam Webster the word plot means;  a series of events that form the story in a novel, movie, etc. The series of events in this masterpiece are as follows. Astronauts from the orbiting space shuttle are outside the vehicle waiting for Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock)  to finish some routine repairs to an orbiting telescope. Meanwhile they get word from NASA that a Russian satellite has been destroyed and the debris is orbiting and posing a threat. Of course the debris hits before everyone is back inside. The results is the Shuttle is destroyed, every one is killed accept Stone and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney). The two are left stranded in space. All communcations with Houston are cut off and they have to find a way to survive on their own. Hmm, sounds like a plot to me.

I think the reason some don't see this as a plot is because Hollywood has so bastardized the genre of Science Fiction, until if there are no death rays, explosions, or morphing aliens popping out of someone's chest, some people lose interest. People have been brainwashed into thinking that is what Sci-Fi is all about. Well I, for one, am glad to see true Science Fiction make its way back to the big screen. This is a marvelous movie, well acted and visually stunning - that is if you can see beauty in marvelous earth shots from space and not explosions. There is even a scene where you can see the aurora at the poll. This is the timeless tale of human ingenuity being put to the test against the natural elements of nature. Without the fall backs of explosions and death rays, the writers had to actually display some talent. You know things like developing the characters so that they are not just two dimensional stereotypes, but actually have depth.

What can I say I enjoyed this movie. At last a sci-fi movie that does not insult the intelligence but gives the viewer credit for having a brain. And if not that, just seeing Sandra Bullock floating around in her underwear was worth the price of a ticket. So see, I am not a complete snob. If you are looking for explosions and talking monkeys, then this picture is not for you. If you want an intelligent story, believable characters, and just love space travel, this is must have.",1416960000,,2439,4.561643835616438

5869088,3,B00DY64A3U,"The movie looks beautiful.  This has some of the most breathtaking scenes, especially when viewed in 3D.

Minor spoilers:

Things kind of fall apart from there.  The simplified premise is that a satellite is destroyed and debris becomes high speed shrapnel.  The dumb part comes in where all of the space stations and the destroyed satellite just all happen to be in the same exact orbit.  All of the space stations are also like a short hop in distance.  That is totally unrealistic.  The stations would be far apart and not all lined up like lily pads in the same plane, same orbit, same region, That would be a safety concern for one thing.  Also that debris would likely not act that way and ""just happen"" to be right in the path of the space stations which also just happen to line up perfectly.

That said if you ignore the plausibility and realistic placement of real space stations and satellites it looks good.",1416873600,,919,4.58282208588957

5869199,1,B00DY64A3U,"Giving this movie one star is being pretty generous, as I can sum up my opinion of it in two words: deeply annoying.

Looong shots of earth from outer space and looong segments of Bullock spinning in space while breathing heavily had me desperately looonging for the fast-forward button.  SO boring and frustrating.  But the single most irritating thing about this film for me was Sandra Bullock.  I've seen other reviewers complain that she was miscast.  I'm not sure if she was miscast or if the script and fleshing out of her character are what led to the major ""suck"" factor.  Either way, I couldn't stand Bullock/Dr. Ryan Stone.  I found myself repeatedly wondering how in the world such an utterly useless and incompetent idiot would ever end up on a space mission in the first place.  For the majority of the film she was grunting, swearing, and panting/hyperventilating.  Frankly, it sounded like somebody with painful constipation.  Between that and shouting ""no, no, no, no, no!"" ad nauseum, I began to think it would be a great service to humanity to just leave her spinning forever in space.  I honestly haven't had a movie character annoy me this deeply since Jar-Jar Binks.  Seriously.

Anyway, clearly some folks enjoyed this movie.  Sadly, I was not one of them.  If someone is contemplating whether or not to give this film a try, here's something that may help.....if you, like me, absolutely hated ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" but loved ""Darkstar,"" then you will probably hate ""Gravity.""  Alternatively, if you're a ""2001...Odyssey"" fan, then we have nothing to discuss, but you'll probably like ""Gravity.""  Good luck.",1415836800,4,1632,4.9411764705882355

Not much really happens in the movie - it lacks character development, script, or plot - all those things that you look for in a movie with such top headline starts.  Sandra Bullock and George Clooney carry this movie entirely (there are no other characters in the film by the way), but that's just not enough.

The only people who'll be convinced by the abject nonsense here are those who think that Disney's The Lion King is an accurate representation of life on the African savannah. Aside from wholly erroneous effects, the plot is virtually non-existent and the acting is, well, typical Hollywood stuff (e.g. not really acting in any meaningful sense). The camera work is adequate.

Sometimes less is more. As for the ""mistakes"" (speed of the debris, etc.), I see movies as evoked dreams. Dreams usually don't make much sense, and frequently defy the laws of physics. You just go with the flow. I also like the original Alien, even though it depicts sound in space, and has a really cheesy animated explosion at the end (even Forbidden Planet got that part ""correct"" back in the 50s when the planet blows up - just a silent expanding ball of light).",1413936000,,793,4.591549295774648

A Space Shuttle team is repairing the Hubble Space Telescope when they get word of  a debris field headed their way. It seems the Russians, for some reason (a test maybe?) have shot down one of their own satellites- accidentally creating a hazard to everything in orbit. Astronaut Kowalski (Clooney) rescues the set adrift Stone (Bullock) during the ensuing mayhem and after determining that the Shuttle is a total loss gets her over to the International Space Station. Stone survives that tip, Kowalski does not. George Clooney is off screen by the 35 minute mark, to reappear in a hallucination Stone has around 1:03- for about 3 minutes.

 Very little of anyone in the movie but Sandra Bullock. Her character barely makes it to the ISS, has to quickly leave- successfully piloting a damaged Soyuz capsule close enough to the Chinese Space Station to get to it with an improvised jet pack (fire extinguisher from the ISS). Our heroine makes it back to Earth (China?) by entering the Chinese station as it has already begun reentry and escaping in the remaining Chinese capsule (a Soyuz copy) during a fiery reentry. The most unlikely part of the movie in my opinion.

Gravity looks great and must really be something in 3D but if you aren't into ""space stuff"" beyond a generally very believable look to it (I think a large part of it was done in a computer) may not be for everyone.

The only extra on the DVD is a 10 minute mini movie of Dr. Stone's radio conversation with Aningaaq (accounting for Greenland in the credits), the rest of the special features must be on the Blu rays. I see filming locations as Shepperton Studios, England and on location in Lake Powell Arizona (I'm guessing Stone's landing was there, nicely greened up to look ""Chinese"").",1413676800,,1836,4.725

While true, let's just catch our breaths and offer a touch of perspective to all this Gravity-hysteria. Look, the movie is a theme park ride masquerading as a movie. Yes, it's extraordinary to see in 3D on a big screen. Have you tried viewing it on a normal TV (even if you have upgraded your standard definition picture tube to a newer, 'high definition' flat screen model, i.e. LCD, LED, or DLP technology) in ""boring old"" 2D? Yeah, that's what I thought! No one wants to watch this astro-bomb in normal old 2D because, well they forgot to come up with a story. What is here, is totally unbelievable.

And while we're on the topic of femmes bucking the male world - let's just get right to it: Ms. Bullock should've insisted she be depicted wearing the standard issue adult diapers that all astronauts (femme or not) are clad in when roaming the ""outer limits."" She catered to the male whim by allowing herself to be seen in a much more traditionally ""sexy"" outfit of skin tights undergarments. Please, people, it's time to accept that women have the same waste excretion functions as the big, strong guys we all forgive for making the bathroom reek on a regular basis. And when Ms. Bullock figures out how to operate complex outer space gear that was designed by a foreign government, well we can just say that implausibility is a true hallmark of this overrated fantasy.",1413676800,3,1552,4.705882352941177

SECOND HALF: ""Oh. They decided to try to win Best Picture a little too hard. Now it's just being cliche and stupid, and I'm caring less and less what happens, especially to this character for whom we have exceptionally little reason to feel.""

Seriously, if you're going to have essentially two characters for the entirety of the film, make sure they're written damned well, and that goes triple for the one who takes up all our viewing time. It's actually very simple why this film has such harsh criticisms: It sets itself up wonderfully, has an excellent premise, the banter between Bullock and Clooney is superbly done...But then disaster happens. To the plot, I mean, when one of them disappears, and every single good thing about the film goes with them.

It actually feels like, somewhere near the beginning of the second half, the guys making it realized they could probably win Best Picture without any trouble. Hence, they throw out everything that made the first half good, and replace it with cliche after cliche, and they load it on with so much sugar and saccharine nonsense that it can't get there.

Talk about a film that gets lost in space. It seems to forget where it is at some point, and what's made it likable until then. A truly awesome and intensely gripping first half is utterly destroyed by a dull and poorly-written second half, focused around a character who is astonishingly under-written.

You can't do that. You can't leave us with one character to focus on after an awesome first half, and then not develop them in any meaningful way, or change our initial impression of them in any significant way. I know it's hard, but you have to manipulate the audience more subtly than what's given here. You can't flat-out stop the film and wait until it's at just-movie-length-acceptable (about 85 minutes without the credits) like what was done here. That is not how character development works.

It's not Bullock's fault at all. Not in the slightest. It's her character's incredible blandness about her, and Bullock's impossible task of making her interesting, despite the writing giving her nothing whatsoever to work with.

The first half is easily five stars. Not even a question, it's some of the best filmmaking I've ever seen in my life. The second half is disastrous, and inverts itself into cliche, saccharine, manipulative nonsense that fails to finish itself.",1413590400,,2457,4.877697841726619

 Those of you who haven't been out to the flickers for a while, go.  Gravity holds our attention with all the immediacy of a pin sized hole in a spacesuit.  Lets start with the acting, shall we?  George Clooney plays an astronaut on his last mission.  Everything we ever wanted to find in a space hero, we find in Clooneys astronaut.  He has the casual confidence, demeanor and sex appeal of a fighter pilot, which makes him fun to watch and listen to.  He also possesses the iron hard competence that one must have in an environment so much more deadly than any on earth.  We must call this a supporting role for Clooney but we must also call it one of his best.
 I always find it encouraging when a beautiful actress like Sandra Bullock allows herself to be filmed as if she had only ordinary looks.  This often provides-in a superior actress-an opportunity to act her sox off and Bullock does.  We see very briefly another actor in a space suit and thats it folks.  We get Clooney for a while and Bullock from start to finish.  What a chance for an actress to stub her toe.  What a chance for an actress to shine like the stars.  Bullock of course shines like the stars.
 This is your basic train wreck movie moved into space.  This gives Director/Writer/Producer Alfonso Cuaron his chance to reach for the stars on his part, a chance that he does not neglect.  All the while, when the actors are contending with some problem or another which will kill them quickly if not solved, the Earth rotates majestically below.  When the action stops its heart pounding rush, we have ample time to look beyond the immediate disaster and see our lovely habitat.  This is the most beautifully filmed movie since Life of Pi.  The sets are out of this world, fantastically detailed and authentic.  The director allows us to understand in human terms just how big space stations are, if we float nearby.  He also allows us the chance to shudder in fear when we realize how inconsequential they, and we, are in the larger frame.  Visual poetry not often arrives in a disaster flick, no matter how epically heroic.
 This strong four saw blade movie will give Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron (Y tu Mama Tambien, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and Children of Men) his chance at the very top of the Hollywood pile.  He has shown us a wide scope of vision.  We want more.
 Gravity cost a big but not crazy $100 million to make and brought in $87 million in the opening week end.  The PG-13 runs one hour and 31 minutes. Never before have I watched a film in 3D where the 3D was not an issue but rather just part of the optical landscape.  I love this movie from top to bottom.",1413244800,,2678,4.439425051334703

5869411,3,B00DY64A3U,"There's not much to say here as other reviewers already said it all, but one thing i would like to address is the ending (non spoilers)...

  Its VERY lackluster, it totally cheats the people who sat there watching this film for almost two hours. I like to compare it to The Shawshank Redemption (a film that got its ending RIGHT!), and here's why.... The Director of The Shawshank Redemption once said that his movie was writen and was supossed to end right after Andy crawls out the tunnel to freedom, but he then said that him and others involved with the film felt as though they would be cheating the audience (who sat through over 2 hours of movie) if they did not give the audience an extra 15min of movie, not only showing what happens to Andy, but also showing Andy and Red finally meeting up again outside of prison (after red gets his walking papers) on the Mexico beach inwhich Andy always dreamed of while in prison. The ending in Shawnshank has to be IMO one of the greatest endings in film history, and an ending, that if was done by the how the script was written, would of never happened!

  Which brings me to Gravity... Gravity could have had an ending just as happy and just as satisfying as Shawshank, it was ""right there"" for the Director to add to, this movie has that feeling for me! But instead it went the Hollywood route, with me and my fiance walking out of the theater as if there was something missing, and there WAS!!! ""About 15 minutes of ending that should of and could of been added to the a film that was so good up until that point"", instead me and my fiance both felt as if we waisted 2 hours of our lifes on a movie that really never ended, it just abruptly STOPS!!! Very depressing!

  I give this movie 2-1/2 stars, the only reason i am even debating on getting this movie is for the incredible 3D to show off our new 60inch 3D TV, and also for our 106inch theater screen/3D Projector.

  If you have never seen this movie, please rent it first, then make your decision to buy only after watching it first.

 Hope this helped!",1413158400,,2066,4.360313315926893

The movie opens with george clooney jetpacking giant circles around the space shuttle, UNTETHERED (!) wasting precious fuel, while sandra dear struggles to make a simple repair to the Hubble telescope.  I realized immediately that I had been tricked into paying for one of the worst sci-fi movies ever made.  They made it a point to intro the movie with a narrative about the silence of space, then proceeded to make one of the noisiest space movies I've ever seen.  Constant mindless blathering, non-stop dramatic background music, explosions, jet hisses, howling (yes howling!).  And somehow sandra dear completed her 2 years of mission training without ever learning how to use a fire extinguisher in space (where fire is one of the greatest threats).  But she catches on quick, and soon after nearly knocking herself out with it, is soon using the extinguisher to propel herself through space in a virtuoso performance of spin neutralization and attitude adjustment!

When an artist has to explain symbols in in a work she or he has done, the artist misses the point of letting the visual effects do the communicating.

The cinematography was astounding, the writing great and acting, well, the acting was nothing less than superb. That manages to raise another point. I have seen very few George Clooney movies I actually liked. I've tolerated a few and downright cannot stand some others. This movie was so good I forgot he was even in it.

Having spent an entire career in the military, I'm aware what a good Mission Commander should be like. Clooney's character embraces the attributes required. I felt I would have been comfortable following that man to the Gates of Hell. His voice of reason and authority was absolutely powerful.

Sandra Bullock was no slouch either. I enjoy her movies and watched her transition from ditzy comedic roles to drama such as this fine film and Blindside. Bullock manages to pull off what may have been the role of her career.

Gravity, and rightly so, was recipient of numerous nominations for Oscars. Each and every one received was warned in spades. This was one heck of a film, adventure and movie. I'm only sad now I didn't see this at the theater.",1410307200,,1209,4.587962962962963

As some stated, there isn't a ton of time dedicated to developing the characters, but this isn't that kind of drama movie. By not spoon-feeding you the character back-story, you can more easily picture yourself in the situation and become immersed in the story. During the untethered spinning of Sandra Bullock, you can hear her rapid breathing and and see earth rotating around you, the score compliments this well by steadily intensifying the dramatics of the situation.
At the same time, there are very artistic moments. I got caught up in the movie and could really imagine being in space, looking down on earth. The visuals are fantastic. Space sometimes seems as something so removed from our lives that its almost unreal.

You might enjoy this movie if:

2. You know nothing of any national space program;
3. You have no understanding of physics; and
4. You have no understanding of orbital mechanics.

5870135,2,B00DY64A3U,"The special effects in this film deserve four of five stars; what this film attempts to teach us deserves negative two or three stars. The producers of this work would have us, first, imbibe the tired old notion that single mothers (Sandra Bullocks character - Ryan) are special people, victims in our supposedly male dominated society. As long as single mothers remain a meaningful voting block for Democrats, Hollywood will force-feed us this notion. The second thing the producers want you to swallow is that Ryan was functional enough to quality for a highly demanding assignment in the Space Shuttle (never mind that we don't launch shuttles anymore; Obama oversaw it's cancellation) but was too traumatized by her only child's accidently death years prior that she was unreliable in a crisis. Finally, Hollywood wants you to believe, in this film, that the dead can intervene in human affairs (as happens in this film) while at the same time believing that it is preposterous that there is a god and that God can and does involve himself in human affairs.

As an aside, Clooney clearly only agreed to stoop to doing this film if he was cast in the role of superhero - witty, courageous, wise, selfless; in short perfect. However, has anyone bothered to ask themselves how does the existence of a perfect man (the character's name is Matt) square with the notion that all men are jerks, which we are supposed to glean from Ryan's heroic single-motherhood?",1407110400,,1460,4.887096774193548

The music and special effects were breath taking. George Clooney and Sandra Bullock are amazing in there roles. Especially Sanrdra, she has always been one of my favorites. She showed me she could be emotional and as I said before was very believable as a woman who had suffered a devastating loss in her life. George was great too.
One of the great lines comes from George Clooney when he tells Sandra, ""I get it, its great up here, no ones going to hurt you"". ""but its time to go home"".
I have watched this movie over 4 times, and will watch it again. To me it is about overcoming obstacles in your life and not giving up.

5870243,2,B00DY64A3U,"It's alright....

The visuals are absolutely stunning. Watch a Blu-ray print of this and it will look 100% real down to the tiniest detail. The CGI team earned it's paycheck on this one.

The acting is superb, especially considering that Sandra Bullock played almost her entire role by herself and did it in front of a green screen. It's VERY hard to act by yourself. Its' much much much easier to act with a partner where the two can play off of each other's characters. And by being green screened for most of the film she wasn't even playing off of the environment. So the acting was phenomenal. You really believe Sandra Bullock is a first time astronaut who's scared but is relying on her training to remain calm when facing almost certain death. (George Clooney did the same thing, but he's only in the movie for about 20 minutes, and his character doesn't do much. He's more of a voiceover than anything else.)

But the story is where this one falls apart. it's so insanely unrealistic that you spend most of the film saying ""Oh my god...not even in a movie..."".

***SPOILERS BELOW***'

The whole plot is based on the idea that the Russians fired a missile at one of their own satellites to destroy it, which causes a chain reaction of debris moving a 50,000 mph into the path of Sandra Bullock and virtually every other satellite in orbit (Communications, space stations, GPS systems, etc). Yeah...okay. Forget for a second that all those things range in lateral distance from the ground by hundreds of miles from each other, so breaking one doesn't put the debris in the path of every other satellite. The unbelievable part is the Russians, who have been putting stuff in space longer than anyone else since the Sputnik days, would blow up one of their own satellites without knowing what kind of havoc it would cause. The Chinese have actually done this before. It freaked everyone out and caused a lot of danger, but nothing ultimately happened. The Chinese only did it because they were new to the Space Age and didn't think things through. The Russians don't mess around with space stuff. They are very good at it, and to quote Fred Thompson from The Hunt for Red October, ""Russians don't take a dump without a plan"". They know how orbits work as well as anyone else. So there is no scenario where the Russians would have caused such a disaster.

Next, the debris wouldn't be moving any faster than the original satellite that was blown up was going. Nor would the trajectory of the debris be different than the trajectory of the original satellite. So if the original satellite would have had to have been on a collision course with the Space Shuttle anyway. If that was he case then NASA would have been stupid to have put the Hubble Telescope there in the first place. The last time I checked, NASA was careful about that sort of thing....

That about covers the technical nonsense.

The rest of the plot involved Sandra Bullock traveling from the Space Shuttle to the Space Station 100 miles away in nothing but a space suit that is out of oxygen. Sure...

Then when she gets there the space debris comes back and blows up the space station (despite it only causing mild damage on its' last orbit) just in the nick of time for Sandra Bullock to climb into the Soyez escape pod and use it to fly to the Chinese Space Station  another 100 miles away so she can use yet another escape pod to go to Earth. Forget that the Soyez capsule has all the controls written in Russian. Bullock seems to be able to read Russian just fine.

Next up...the Chinese station, which has had the debris field pass by it twice now, is relatively unharmed until Sandra Bullock gets there then suddenly the debris comes back and destroys the station, knocking it out of orbit and sending it plummeting to Earth. Uh huh....sure. Could the debris destroy it? Sure. Could it knock it out of orbit? No way. The debris wouldn't have nearly enough mass to change the flight path of the station. It might destroy it's control systems which could cause the station to not be able to maintain orbit, but not in the 3 hours that elapses during the movie. But Bullock finds the Chinese escape capsule and fires it up and drives it home. Of course all the controls in this one are written in Chinese, which Bullock doesn't read a word of but correctly guesses which buttons to push. Sure....9000 buttons on a space ship with Chinese writing on them....anyone could just guess the right button to push.

REALLY REALLY SERIOUS SPOILERS TELLING YOU THE ENDING BELOW

Bullock finally reaches the ground alive and healthy....uh huh.....and is happy that she's made it to solid ground. Except that the solid ground she's found looks to be an isolated beach near a mountainous jungle region somewhere in Asia with no signs of civilization anywhere near it. She is wet from her water landing and has no pants (you heard me, no pants) or shoes. Her odds of survival at this point might be worse than they were in space. You can't survive when you are nearly naked, wet, and have no training on how to live in the jungle.

If this movie was about aliens that attacked our satellites it would have been a better story because at least then you can accept that there is a different set of rules being applied. But when you say the normal rules of physics and space exploration are what are governing the catastrophes it just doesn't make any sense.

A space movie like Armageddon is just as implausible but it works because the story tells you from the beginning that NASA is using a bunch of secret new equipment designed to compensate for all the unrealistic stuff that will happen in the movie. So despite you knowing that there isn't really a special space shuttle that can fly to an asteroid and land safely on it, you don't care because the story told you that in this world there is such a space shuttle.

You can be unrealistic in movies as long as you make it clear that the story is existing with its own set of rules. Star Trek, Star Wars, etc...they are all unrealistic space movies but they are entertaining because they tell you right from the beginning that their worlds aren't governed by the rules and limitations that our real world is. It's fantasy and fun. But Gravity goes out of its way to make it clear that it IS operating under the normal rules and limitations of our current space program and understanding of physics. So when you break those rules the movie falls apart.

One more thing....In the movie Bullock strips off the space suit and you see that she's wearing a tank top and panties underneath. Not that I didn't enjoy seeing Sandra Bullock float around the space station in her underwear after taking off her space suit....but a space suit isn't just bulky pants and a shirt that you put on over your underwear. Under the space suit she would have had another head to toe body suit that kept her temperature regulated with tubes all around it that carried heat to and from her body. Without that suit under the space suit she'd have boiled/frozen several times over in the 5 hours she was on her initial space walk.",1406505600,7,7120,4.5717647058823525

5870249,2,B00DY64A3U,"Visually amazing, but pretty darned limp story-wise. It's an entire film built around the survival story of a single character, and she's not a terribly compelling character. For me as a writer, it stands as a lesson in what NOT to do plot- and character-wise. [spoilers]

Protagonist Ryan (played by Bullock) has got zero personality, apart from stick in the mud. When the movie opens, during a spacewalk outside their shuttle, as her two co-astronauts are marveling at the views in deep space and enjoying the thrill of this experience so few humans will ever have she's just annoyed by their chatter and totally fixated on the minor motherboard issue she's outside the craft to assess---and why would a Biomedical Technician/MD be assigned that particular task in the first place?

When trouble strikes, her inexperience, inability to remain calm, and unwillingness to follow direct orders from the mission commander (played by Clooney) make her a liability and also make her less likable. I was rooting for Clooney, not the vaguely depressed, unfriendly blank slate Bullock plays.

Her only distinguishing characteristic is that she had a daughter who died in a playground accident at the age of four, and when this information is disclosed it doesn't really add much of anything to the story, or even to the character. She matter of factly states it was just one of those things, and has nothing more to say about it. When the Clooney character tries to press her for something, ANYTHING they can bond over, she says what she likes most about space is the silence, and that all she ever did on Earth was work and drive around at night listening to the radio. Wouldn't these two have spent enough time together in training to know one another a little better than that? They're more or less strangers to one another here.

Plot-wise, there are a TON of unanswered questions that co-writer/director Cuaron doesn't seem to think have anything to do with his story even though HE'S the one who wrote them. Like, why was the International Space Station abandoned, cut off from communications with Earth, and on fire? Why was the Chinese space station abandoned, yet still in communication with Earth? Why was the one guy Ryan made contact with on Earth an Inuit sledge driver, and how was he able to be talking to the Chinese space station?

Cuaron has said in interviews it's simply a story about the struggle for survival in the Darwinian sense, and his interpretation of the story is that Ryan is a survivor who overcomes many obstacles to survive in the end. WTF, Cuaron?! Why put those tantalizing loose threads of a mystery into the film and leave them totally unexplored?

By the end, for me anyway, it just turned out to be a big, ""So...THAT happened."" Yeah, the stakes were life and death for this ONE woman---everyone else on the mission dies in the first reel---, but unless you really CARE about that woman, so what?",1406419200,13,2928,4.811133200795228

5870438,5,B00DY64A3U,"It goes without saying.  Visuals enhance a film.  Visuals lend aesthetics to the film's story, pacing, plot.  And visuals often tell the story.

I'm trying to think of any other film where visuals dominate from beginning to end to the same extent as GRAVITY.  And I'm coming up with a goose egg.  Director Alfonso Cuaron has given us a visual feast featuring one dominant player:  Earth.  As GRAVITY's story spins along--the story of two shuttle astronauts about to get caught up in an outer space bad hair day--the crystal clear, vibrant blue sphere of Earth stretches out in the background, often featuring spiraling storm clouds, or one horizon is outlined by an oncoming sunrise.  In a word, stunning.  Yet the visuals don't end with the depiction of the Earth.  GRAVITY's story is launched by a Russian satellite being destroyed, creating a debris field that takes out other satellites, creating a relentless chain reaction of destruction.  As astronauts Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) are first cast adrift from their shuttle, to making their way to the International Space Station, to subsequently attempting to seek refuge in the Chinese space station, the debris cloud stubbornly follows, cutting an extraordinary amount of damage to all spacecraft before our very eyes.  Obviously, none of the destruction is real, yet the imagery and visuals are so compelling and believable the viewer can do nothing more than tightly grip the handles of his or her chair.

Finally, the visuals enhance the story of Dr. Ryan Stone, who is a reluctant space traveler at best, a novice who suddenly finds herself all alone in the vast nothingness of space.  As GRAVITY's story unfolds, we learn pieces of vital backstory about Ryan's life back on Earth; in a word, it's not been a happy one.  Yet Ryan knows one thing:  She's not ready to die, not this day, and she'll do whatever it takes to get back home.  This may be Bullock's finest performance by far, and she owes a thumbs up to her trainer; she's in miraculous shape for this role.  GRAVITY is a white-knuckle thriller presented by filmmakers at the peak of their crafts.  GRAVITY is a visual must-see, again and again and again.

5870440,4,B00DY64A3U,"For as many films as weve gotten about space over the years, very few of them are actually about space. The worlds of Star Trek and Star Wars are metaphors representing more grounded themes, and even Alien director Ridley Scott described his classic as a haunted house in space. Alfonso Cuarons Gravity, however, is a true space film, deriving its thrills and horrors from the fear of outer space itself.

Gravity has certainly earned much of the praise it has earned. It is rich with dazzling visuals and often terrifying sequences, of Sandra Bullocks Dr. Ryan Stone barely clinging on to survive. Its strengths, though, come awfully close to being Gravity's weakness - for nearly an hour we go through conflict-solution, conflict-solution. As thrilling as it is, this movie frequently becomes an exploitative experience.

After the turmoil, though, what lasts is its more long-term storytelling methods. A sense of order is created through key missions (such as approaching the Chinese space station, using escape pods to leave for Earth, etc.), orienting the viewer through what is otherwise a dizzying adventure. This narrative clarity also spills over into the films themes of survival and determination, and holding to heart one vision in order to survive.

This makes me question the re-watchability of this film; since so much of its meat is spent on these momentary thrills (however excellently crafted), there isn't that much emotional punch to invite additional viewings.",1405987200,6,1482,5.218487394957983

Most of the time in space, all you seen was a closeup for her face. Neil deGrasse Tyson picked this movie all apart for not being scientifically accurate. One of his beefs was Bullock's hair in the space station. When I hear that criticism I can only say one thing. Sandra Bullock is known for her long beautiful brunette hair, and she whacked it all off for this movie. For a movie star, and a lady, that had to be quite a sacrifice. I just can't picture the effects of gravity, and Bullocks hair making her look like a punk rocker. My only beef was there was no bathroom scene. After that traumatic scene with Clooney floating and flying around in space. I know the first thing I would be doing when I got inside of that Russian space station. I would be heading straight for the latrine. But hey its Hollywood, and entertainment factor was high on this one. I am just going to say I am glad I am a laymen, and do not have a PHD.

5870545,4,B00DY64A3U,"While Gravity does have one minor problem in that it's really hard to base an entire movie around the concept of drifting in space, the film does do everything in its power to at least deliver as much as it possibly can with such a limited idea.  While I don't really care for either George Clooney or Sandra Bullock, the good news is that Clooney's smugness is somewhat reserved and Sandra's usual talkative whining is at least justified in this case since her life is constantly in the balance.  After all she's lost in space by herself.  She has to depend on herself and her limited set of skills to figure out how to launch her space shuttle homeward.  Not an easy task.

Surprisingly Gravity does have its share of emotional moments, usually in the way Sandra reflects on her past and specifically a family tragedy that she constantly struggled with (and still struggles with).  The special effects are honestly amazing.  Whether or not teardrops and fire drops actually move as realistically in outer space as portrayed in this film is anyone's guess.  I'm leaning towards they are fairly realistic.  The film may be short at just over 80 minutes, but it's compelling enough that it's not a major issue.

I'm normally not even a Sandra Bullock fan.  The last movie she starred in that I enjoyed was the Blind Side and of course, Speed will always be a classic in my book.  But she nails another nail-biting unforgettable performance here.  When things go array and she's desperately trying to cling onto any floating objects she can fearing she might drift away into endless space, you really hope she can grab onto *something* just for the slim chance she'll be able to continue surviving, which is exactly what a good suspense is supposed to do.

Gravity proves one thing that used to be a personal problem I had in my late teens- knowing that outside of earth there's millions of miles of nothingness.  This can be the most frightening thing ever.  A lot of people think it's beautiful- floating around forever and experiencing nothing but silence, but I personally think it's terrifying enough to totally make me wish I was dead if I ever found myself in such a situation.  I'm not even exaggerating either.  This is why I was strongly against viewing Jodie Foster's Contact back when that movie was new.  In Gravity the camera angles do all kinds of twists and turns as Sandra and Clooney spin around which is enough to not only make me fear outer space even more than I already do, but can make a viewer dizzy.  It's absolutely brilliant the way the sunlight shines during certain dizzy segments, and its location based on planet Earth at the time these events occur.  It seems so realistic... but is it?  And by the way, Sandra and Clooney remain fairly close to Earth the entire time.

On a side note, it's very strange how Clooney and Sandra are spinning and floating around in outer space and having normal conversations.  I'm pretty sure I'd be quite terrified!  Even when the two separate and desperation kicks in, there's still a temporary feeling of normalcy which is really bizarre.

Overall I really enjoyed Gravity quite a bit.  Expect a slow, tacky and unappealing introduction since the movie basically just THROWS viewers into the outer space elements right away with very little in the way of a logical or appealing build-up, but I have to conclude that Gravity does its job in making me feel satisfied with the film.  The cinematography at the very least should be amazing enough to entice people to watch this.  Not for the faint of heart however- if you've ever had or currently have fears of what it's like to be somewhere other than earth much like the terrible thoughts that dominated my teenage years, this movie may sort of mess with your mind and make your imagination go wild in a frightening way, so be on the lookout for that.",1405555200,,3865,4.67603550295858

Sandra Bullock plays some kind of expert with a Ph. D who's created something NASA finds valuable; why she herself must be in orbit to install it is not really explained, you'd think an experienced astronaut trained by her to install the equipment would've been a better choice for NASA. George Clooney's character is the head guy and sacrifices himself to give her a fighting chance after the accident. Ms. Bullock provides abit of cheesecake in shorts and tank top but compared to twerking, it's quite modest. music is over done as the writers didn't craft an emotional story but the music tries to elicit an emotional response. 2 and 3/4 stars rounded up to 3 for cinematography, acting, and filmmaking team effort.",1405555200,,1080,4.780748663101604

Two good actors give so-so performances, which was probably the most they could do with a banal script and a silly plot line.  From start to finish the movie is a big crashing bore.

Hollywood has proven over the past couple of years that they can totally deliver on special effects. They get a gold star for that. Hoo-rah.

I had expected more after hearing all the hype. I think the story could have actually been more believable and done better. I say this because the way Sandra Bullock's character rescues herself was a bit of a stretch - just not believable.

In the same sense that the movie ""Armageddon"" had some ""one-shot or nothing"" gimmicks to make it all possible, Gravity does this way too much.

The amazing number of leaps from one failing spacecraft to another with too many ""just-in-time one-shot or nothing leaps"" - sorry you guys over did that.  And why George's character winds up lost - really? What? That was totally unnecessary and killed the idea you were building that this guy was going to help them both survive and make it home. And then transform the movie into a sad sack tale of misery and doubt and crying and then make several magic jumps to safety.

5870704,2,B00DY64A3U,"Really? ? What a schlocky movie! Spoilers....

Sandra bullock plays a female astronaut who has stereotypical Hollywood female issues. She's in the command module or whatever its called trying to let herself die because she's still depressed about her kid's death. So dead George Clooney has to motivate her to stay alive. She can't figure out how to make the ship move so he has to tell her to use landing thrusters. She admits she didn't think of that because she failed landing simulator training -- she got only six months worth of training, which sets her up to be so ignorant that a man will have to rescue her, Yet 5 minutes later she's sitting in a Chinese ship by herself and just by guessing at instruments she's never seen, figures out how to land THAT ship.

 So pathetic that she is not a strong female character but has emotional problems and has to be rescued by a man, and a dead one at that. Bleeech!

I'm surprised they didn't give her cramps or a yeast infection in space to round out the Hollywood female experience. ""Houston, the itching is killing me, Houston do you read me?""",1405209600,,1097,4.525252525252525

5870706,1,B00DY64A3U,"First the good. This movie was visually stunning.

Now the bad. This story was dull and Sandra Bullock's character was no Sally Ride.

Ms. Bullock played a less then qualified astronaut who goes into space to fix some hardware. Suddenly there's an emergency (who would have anticipated that there might be an emergency during spaceflight) and just as suddenly, I noticed that several of the laws of physics ceased being operational. For example, unless I just saw it wrong, Ms. Bullocks hair was always subject to Earth's gravity. Maybe that's because she used that greasy kids stuff. Anyway, Ms. Bullocks character has a good cry. Boo -yoo-hoo! Who let this wimp into the astronaut program in the first place? What a totally disrespectful portrayal of woman star voyagers!

Then things went from pretty dull to really dull. Real space flight is so much more interesting.

And hey, movie making people, I hate to be the one to break the news to you, but spaceflight is dangerous. I mean really dangerous. Do you know who understands that spaceflight  is really dangerous? Astronauts understand it is really dangerous. Although I can't prove it, I think that is one of the aspects of the job that they find attractive. Astronauts, men and women alike are the kind of people who look forward  to blasting off in a hurtling piece of machinery, riding big highly explosive rockets, pushing the edge of the envelope, & putting their hides on the line. Know what. That is one of the big reasons they fly in space. They every enjoy the danger. They know  bad stuff is always around the corner. And when it happens they are going to dig up some guts and rise to the occasion. They are not going to wimp out because they are the kind of people who crave that life vs. death struggle. Why do you think they become astronauts, as opposed to clerk-typists, in the first place? BTW: No disrespect to clerk-typists be they men or women -- they just don't belong in space.

If real astronauts acted like Ms. Bullock's character, we would have lost a lot more of them. Neil Armstrong would have never walked on the moon because he and Dave Scott would have died on Gemini 8. John Glenn would have freaked-out and been killed on Friendship 7. I could go on, but why? Real astronauts are brave. Ms. Bullock's character should have stayed in the typing pool.

This movie reminded me of Heaven's Gate. Beautiful to look at but a poor story poorly told. If it were physically possible, I would give this garbage 3 thumbs down.

PS Ham & Enos, the first American apes in space, were better astronauts than Ms. Bullock's character. They would give this space junk 8 thumbs down!",1405209600,2,2655,4.665952890792291
5870727,2,B00DY64A3U,"This movie is disrespectful of female astronauts. Sandra Bullock does nothing but whine and snivel for the first thirty minutes of the movie. She has to be rescued by the glib and competent George Clooney. (He should have had a white horse.) Astronauts are trained to handle emergencies and not to cry like little babies when things go wrong. What she should have done is to untether herself from the Clooney character and pop her helmet to prevent him from jeopardizing himself further on her behalf. (However, the movie would have been too short.) Had the Bullock character been male, we would never have accepted such ineptitude.

5870730,5,B00DY64A3U,"About 10 min into Gravity I realized the genius of casting two huge stars in the lead: instant empathy.

Most people know who George Clooney and Sandra Bullock are and many of those people like them both, too. Gravity uses their star power not only to sell tickets to a pretty daring film, but also to do away with the necessity of having to build up any major back story for these characters.

The action starts almost right away and doesn't waste time with bogging you down with flashbacks or unnecessary exposition. I'd go as far to say that this is the best star casting I've ever seen in a film - even better than Henry Fonda in 'Once Upon A Time In The West'.

Another thing that helps make this movie great is that the dialogue is nothing special - the relationship between Bullock and Clooney is based on banal banter for the most part. Normally that would kill a movie about just 2 people, but here it works because if this film had weighted itself down with 'deep' characters and a psychological intense study of them, the movie would have fallen flat. Even the cliche moments of tapping gauges that all of a sudden show empty, the heavy handed metaphor of human evolution, and all the other 'movie' moments all work to make this movie great because it just takes you on the most exciting, beautiful, stressful, incredible voyage I've ever seen in a film. Cuarn is in such control of this epic  and his craft as a filmmaker that he uses every old trick in the storytelling department from the dusty backlot of Hollywood and uses them in service of an adventure ride like nothing ever put on screen. Had he tried to infuse this film with more depth it wouldn't have been as good of a film because it would have taken you out of the moment and distracted you from the mission at hand.

This film is like nothing I've ever seen, I mean, it actually is the dictionary definition of 'spectacular' and 'epic'. I was so caught up in this film that my heart was racing pretty much the entire time and when it was over I remembered why it is that I love going to the movies. Seeing this in 3D is probably the only way to see the film; I can't imagine how much will be lost when watching it on a television because a lot of the tension and emotional texture of the film is built around a feeling of being adrift in a three dimensional space so large, vast, cold, and beautiful that a law should be passed requiring all movie theaters to show this film at least once a month.

Some of the science in the film is inaccurate (the stations are not anywhere near that close together because space is really, really big), but none of that matters because this is hands down one of the most fun and technically brilliant films I've ever seen.",1405209600,,2735,4.384615384615385

5870774,4,B00DY64A3U,"Prior to watching this movie, I expected a nausea-induced dizzy-camera festbut I was happily surprised by the careful consideration given to how the movie was shot in artificial space. Some shots might make a few viewers claustrophobic, but it definitely will get the heart pounding in many scenes. Certain scenes seem to go on longer than needed, but the pacing overall is quite good and the story is unique (for once in the sci-fi genre). I bought this BEFORE I had watched it, just going on reviews and previews I had seen. I have no regrets. Blu-ray video and audio quality are excellent, and the special features are exhaustive. I've watched the ultraviolet version streamed on my living room blu-ray player and it looks/sounds fine, but you can't compare it to the crystal clear sound and visuals of the blu-ray.",1405036800,3,818,4.85

I find it rather hard to believe that a scientist going along for the ride would have the flight skills and training to accomplish what S.B. does in the movie. The basic premise of the movie is OK, she's up there to help repair some non functioning equipment on an orbiting space station.  They don't exactly make it clear why she is the main expert to fix things, or what exactly she is going to fix, but that is OK.  What she is trying to fix is completely secondary to the situation of being caught in the middle of high speed orbiting scrap metal, and trying to get back down to earth.  In my opinion the only thing in this movie worth an academy award is the special effects and visuals.  I like SB, and I think that she is a decent actress, but her character in the movie didn't require that much acting skill.",1405036800,2,991,4.184210526315789

About other reviews. I was shocked at how many negative reviews there were, so I read a lot of them. Quite a few negative reviews from people who didn't think they would like it to begin with or parents who didn't like it and ONLY watched it because their kids were begging to watch it.

If you didn't want to watch it to begin with and knew you wouldn't like it......why would you write a negative review about it? Right? I mean why screw up the rating being a poor sport? You don't see me giving Downtown Abbey bad reviews; I know I won't like it so I won't watch it and got nothing bad to say about it.",1405036800,,788,4.246666666666667

I found myself physically tensed and drawn deeper into the movie. Some of the action, like sound in space, took a bit off the movie but Bullock gave a great performace!

I've never had this problem with a download from Amazon on my roku, so I don't know. And to make it worse, the subtitles didn't work. Not sure if there are any, but if there are, they didn't work.

What makes this edition a keeper for me is the incredible set of extras about the making of this space epic. I am in awe of what Sandra Bullock had to endure to make this movie seem more like a documentary than a work of fiction.

She leaves nothing in reality to which one can aspire ... zero, zilch, nada.  Her character-role in the ""Gravity"" screenplay is undisciplined, narcissistic and hysterical.  Simply put, as an astronaut crew-member, she is an incompetent, unprofessional, foolish and dangerous boob who puts her lack of situational-awareness above others and puts her gender to shame.  Why the real Sandra Bullock allows this kind of egregious imbecilic character-development is SHOCKING, given the well-known professional standards today's successful female astronaut candidates must meet AND exceed.  Her character is the erroneous quintessential 1950's stereotypical airhead stay-at-home mom who single-handedly destroys and surpasses the male-version of Murphy's Law.

This is perhaps the pretties film you will ever see. The CGI and special effects are awesome, and the ""wow"" factor lasts the whole movie.

But that does not stop this being a terrible script.

Sandra Bullock get trapped in space, as exploding debris destroys her shuttle, space station and rescue pod, until she eventually gets to another station and then home.

First, 90 min. running time astounded me. 2001 Space Odyssey still ranks high in the outer space photography dept.  Sandra comes across as a Sigourney Weaver wannabe & who can be tougher than Sigourney as an outer space woman?
I also felt Sandra was overacting, I couldn't believe her character was a real person. George Clooney acted way too calm & collective in a dire situation to me. I was expecting the space photography to improve from the beginning but it just stayed on the same platform. The only thing I felt valid was the anti gravity simulation, a difficult thing to do, but I never felt a hearfelt connection with the leading lady as she seemed very klutzy and was literally saved by sheer dumb luck.

5871050,3,B00DY64A3U,"2001 it is not, but GRAVITY is a tense and, at times, thrilling movie about survival that coasts on its stunning visuals while paying little attention to story and character. The plot is simple: two astronauts who are making modifications to the Hubble Space Telescope have to fight for their lives after debris from a Russian satellite starts to make its way towards them. The cast is quite small, and only Sandra Bullock and George Clooney have any screen time. Everyone else is just a voice on the intercom. George Clooney does his usual ladies' man routine, which he does quite well, and Sandra Bullock does a good job of a woman who never should have been allowed in space in the first place. That aside, they do an admirable job with the script they were given. Where the movie really excels is in the visual department. Alfonso Cuaron spent many years developing this concept and technology to make this movie, not unlike James Cameron did with Avatar, and it shows onscreen. These are some of the most impressive space effects that I've seen in a long time, although calling them ground-breaking might be giving it a little too much credit. The score is also worth mentioning, and helps to maintain the tension throughout the film. Still, I felt like the story was lacking enough, and the middle 45-50 minutes of the movie lags quite a bit. I have a feeling that I'd be looking at this movie differently had I saw it in theaters, but I didn't, so this is how I feel about it. The first half-hour, and the last 20 minutes were superb, but the middle dragged a little too much. Overall, it is a movie worth seeing, although to get the full effect of the visuals, it would probably be best to see this on the largest screen possible and with a decent sound system.

As for the story and the characters, I was still pretty much blown away, though I have a few minor problems.  Phaldut Sharma might have as well have just told us that he wouldn't be in the movie for very long as his lines did everything but spell that out in multiple languages.  I found George Clooney witty, amusing, and just plain fun to watch, but he came off more like an equal than the mission commander.  Sure, there was, like, one time where he asserted his authority, but that solo occasion was jarring in comparison to the rest of his performance.  In all his other scenes, he just seemed to be in charge because he happened to be the one who knew the most about space travel.  As for Sandra Bullock, I initially wasn't impressed with her and only continued watching because I knew that the film was only ninety-one minutes long.  She started out as a geek on her first space mission and there was nothing impressive or original there.  Then, she seemed to go from panicking and being unable to do anything to moping and feeling sorry for herself.  But I'm glad I stuck around, because in the last 45% of the movie, Sandra Bullock just...rocked!  While her performance wasn't bad throughout the beginning of the movie and just failed to truly impress me, I now know what director Alfonso Cuarn meant when he praised Bullock in his acceptance speech at the Academy Awards.  Even without the visual aspect, I very much enjoyed this film, though I do plan to watch it with someone sighted next time around.  For now, I will nevertheless stamp my recommendations onto this movie.  It had its problems, but they were either minor or the movie more than made up for them by the end credits.

If you have always wanted to visit outer space, seeing Gravity is probably as close as you are going to get to the real thing, such is the spectacular nature of its visuals and effects. The seat-grabbingly tense moments are well dispersed throughout this compact, 90-minute thriller, filling in for a fairly lightweight plot and lackluster script.

5871121,4,B00DY64A3U,"""Gravity"" is an occasionally contemplative sci-fi thriller directed by Alfonso Cuarn and written by Cuarn and his son Jons. It takes place in Earth's orbit, where the crew of mission STS-157 is doing some work on the Hubble telescope, when they are ordered by mission control in Houston to return to Earth immediately. Russia has unwisely shot down a defunct satellite, and the debris from the explosion has caused a chain reaction, sending a wave of debris from other satellites hurtling toward the astronauts. Mission Specialist Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), an engineer, veteran Mission Commander Lt. Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), and another astronaut are outside the Space Shuttle Explorer when they receive the message and are unable to take shelter in time. The Shuttle damaged, their colleagues killed, Ryan and Kowalski survive tethered together. Their only hope is to use Kowalski's Manned Maneuvering Unit to propel themselves to the nearby International Space Station, where they hope to find means to return to Earth.

""Gravity"" reminds me of the movie ""Cast Away"" (2000) in that it pits a lone human against nature in a struggle to survive, relying on one actor to carry the film. Though, in ""Gravity"", the astronaut's ordeal is punctuated by action sequences to keep the audience from realizing that we are watching a film about humanity's place in the universe. There is hope and hopelessness, isolation and connection, in Ryan Stone's struggle not just to stay alive, but to find a reason to do so. Stone's tearjerker backstory and the fact that she is buffeted about by catastrophe after catastrophe are lazy gimmicks employed to make sure we don't lose interest in her plight. A more typical, driven, careerist astronaut would have been more interesting and more difficult to write. Keeping our interest without the pyrotechnics would have been more challenging. The wave of debris takes 90 minutes to complete one orbit, so it conveniently wreaks havoc like clockwork. Nevertheless, ""Gravity"" creates real suspense and manages to be genuinely moving at times. And I like that it is essentially cinematic, tending to tell its story with images rather than words.",1403913600,,2186,5.175141242937853

The opening does not give me any reason to think this woman is qualified to be where she is, in spite of the persistent use of ""Doctor"" in front of her name. A few flashbacks to her journey to being chosen would have enabled me to know her better and care more deeply. As for the self-sacrificing colleague, he was shallow and two-dimensional.

Also, there is no gravity in space (okay there is a little from Earth and pretty much any celestial body, but not enough to make this scene so dramatic) so there would be no invisible force pulling Clooney from Bullock.

However the great CGI graphic magic was outstanding and made me raise the rating to 2 stars.  I was also extremely disappointed by AMAZON's streaming service that removed the digital 5.1 surround sound capability so, in effect, I'm rating this HD movie based on the streaming delivery over the internet from AMAZON and not the Blu-Ray product.  The sound was only in stereo...no center channel dialog which basically destroyed the clarity and no rear speaker sound which destroyed any possible 3d effect.  I would not recommend buying/renting/viewing this movie using Amazon's streaming service if you have a sound system that can take advantage of the digital sound effects.  To be fair, I am getting this movie for free on a 30-day trial basis as part of the Amazon Prime offer so this didn't cost me anything.  But I would consider the lack of digital 5.1 sound as a major factor as whether to commit to their Prime fees since I'd be reluctant to utilize their movie rentals as this is a major piece of that package.",1403654400,,1342,4.68936170212766

5871273,1,B00DY64A3U,"This movie was not nearly deserving of 5 stars in every category. I rated it one star to better offset all of the delusional reviews on here:

Visuals - 5 stars
Screenplay - 2 stars
Dialogue - 1 star
Realism - 1 star
Acting - 3 stars
Soundtrack - 3 stars

That'd be a far more realistic rating. The only high points are the visual effects (although the initial shot of the CG shuttle looks a little fake) and getting to see more of Sandra's figure than usual. The dialogue is complete throw-away. The laws of physics, reality, and probability are grossly abused, in terms of positions of satellites, orbital mechanics, the fact that the debris field had no chance of intercepting the shuttle once, let alone THREE times. Actual spacesuit gloves are far too stiff to deftly grab at objects, but in the film they were grabbing things with ease. The jetpack's speed and maneuverability is greatly exaggerated compared to reality. Trying to navigate space with a fire extinguisher would be a very difficult task in reality.

...It's obvious that without any sort of monster in the film to scare us, they turned the debris into a kind of monster...

Technical flaws aside, it's really the plot and character interaction that turned the film into a wash. The actors (Sandra B) are barely utilized in terms of their acting potential. I've also decided that George Clooney is really just a failed attempt to clone Sean Connery, and that his presence and demeanor is more often drab, annoying, and predictable than anything else. I'd rather have had Nicholas Cage. At least Nick is more interesting to watch.

It's like the Director was out to make a movie that portrayed the calm quiet and nothingness of space, but then grew bored and decided that he wished he were instead making a space monster film, with peril and dangers attacking the crew at every turn. Ergo, the malignant debris field, the raging fire, etc. everything he can find is out to get them, save the spaceship itself.

Even the absurd amount of action wouldn't be so bad if the character interaction were at least halfway decent. The acting itself isn't the problem, it's the Director's terrible direction combined with a mediocrely written screenplay. There was nothing going on between anyone to make it worth watching, like in the way Twister's interpersonal drama kept us hooked well beyond what the Twisters alone could do (or just about any other space oriented film I could name).

Even the soundtrack is poorly conceived, trying to impress upon the audience the absolute quiet of space with that crescendoing sound that makes you expect an impinging disaster. It was cool the first time, but reusing it throughout the film turned it into a too-obvious, borderline amateurish gimmick.

The only recent space drama I can think of that's worse than Gravity are the latest Star Trek reboot films, as if they ever had a snowball's chance in heck of capturing the vibe and spirit of what made TOS great, but that's another review.

Bottom line is, this movie is a good rental, but there's no way it's good enough to justify owning it at full retail.",1403308800,6,3112,4.769516728624535

The plot is essentially Bullock centered, it's a tour de force for Sandy, who does her wonderful job. And George Clooney does his usual solid work as the other astronaut, although he bows out quickly.

The plot? Not so much, an excuse for the effects, some of which are a bit over the top (using a fire extinguisher as a rocket in space? I dunno.....). But still a worthwhile watch, probably not something I'd buy to watch later.",1403222400,3,596,4.418181818181818

5871296,1,B00DY64A3U,"Implausibly hilarious physics at times. The writers/director didn't develop any attachment to the primary character (played by Sandra Bullock), and no one cared what happened to her in the end.  For a 90 minute movie, it shouldn't have been too hard to show a few scenes on Earth before she left on the mission, possibly hinting at a love interest or family--any reason she might have for wanting to get back to Earth.  Finally, why not get unknown actors/actresses for the lead roles? I don't need big names to sell me on a movie about space, and the unknowns would have kept me in the storyline rather than reminded me of all the other movies I've seen Sandra Bullock in.

The effects were, as promised, very good.  The pace was high throughout but faded somewhat after the initial event.  That there were multiple events, each at a separate location, occurring with clockwork regularity, struck me as somewhat implausible, even with orbits being what they are.

You will have to see Gravity to find out. This film is destined to be a classic. The eye becomes fixed on the incredible cinematography, not to mention the first 10 minutes of the film being a single, uncut scene - a scene comprised entirely of special effects, since it was not actually filmed in space (hard to believe when you're watching it). Besides the film being a visual vortex that keeps the viewer in a state of almost constant anxiety, its audio effects are nearly as powerful. Blending anticipated sounds with the absolute silence of space is a stunning effect in itself. Most critics seemed to think the film's one weakness was a lack of story, but I disagree. The story is as subtle and profound as the effects are mystifying and breath-taking. Sandra Bullock is phenomenal, especially when you consider that she had to make a credible, multi-dimensional character in near isolation and in the midst of a web of technical equipment that creates the illusion of a setting in space. If you are up for a heart-pounding, spirit-enriching, eerie, exhausting experience, Gravity is a must-see work of artistic genius.",1402790400,8,1287,4.935483870967742

5871418,2,B00DY64A3U,"This film fell flat for me.  The performances were good, but the subject matter and the format left me wishing I'd made another choice.  If I'd wanted to see an inspirational film about getting stuck in outer space, I would have just re-watched Apollo 13 with Tom Hanks.  As it is, I basically got a re-hashed, yet less uplifting version of that, starring Sandra Bullock instead.  Most of the movie is either a monologue, or close to it, and the only redeeming character in the film leaves the screen abruptly, about half way through.  What I believe was meant to be an intensely personal and emotional journey for the viewer ends up being a drag, where I just kept wanting the main character to snap out of it.  The ending, rather than leaving me inspired, left me wondering why the heck I'd wasted my evening on this trumped up tale.  If you want to do a night of of lost in space, just watch Tom Hanks in Apollo 13 instead (not because I'm a huge fan or anything--it's just a better story altogether.)  Sandra Bullock is still beautiful, and a great actor, but it's hard to even focus on her acting skills, when she's wearing either a reflective helmet, or underwear for the entire film--two extremes, but both detract from her performance.",1402790400,7,1243,4.5675675675675675

What Cuarn did with such a small cast was great, but the story is just lackluster (and he co-wrote it!).  My main issues are 1.  The script, it was very simple, but maybe that was the point making it seem as ""realistic/normal"" as possible, as if these were actual people.  so if the point then I get it.  2.

However, since the main focus is on Sandra, and what she goes through emotionally, it's a good ride. If you don't like Sandra Bullock you probably aren't going to bother with this movie, but I REALLY like her in this movie.

This is a much deeper movie and not to be taken on the literal level. for those who just want eye candy, this is NOT you movie.
My whole family watched it,(including my 16 yr old son) and we really enjoyed it. We got what it meant, about something drastic happening in one's life that sucks the life right out of them. But then put in a life or death situation, it brings out the strong desire to live again. That process of just wanting to give up, then the last minute burst toward the surface of the circumstance that has you drowning in it.
The only symbol that I missed which my husband caught was the embryonic fetal position that Ryan curled up into when she found her way in to the craft which gave her the life giving oxygen she needed. When viewing the special features this was spoken of and then I got it :)

Sandra Bullock and Clooney did a GREAT job delivering their lines.  I would have dissolved into laughter, or likely walked off the set with a parting shot, ""I will NOT make this crappy movie!""

They avoided a big mistake that lots of Sci-fi movies or tv shows unfortunately do, they avoided dragging you through flashbacks. I'm not against flashbacks but there are so many sci-fi movies and tv shows that have a great plot but to save money they give you lots of flashbacks. That said there is back story to the characters, mostly Sandra Bullock and seeing her expressions on her face while recounting past events is more interesting to me than watching it take place. You don't get to see the impact of the event on the character during the flashback , only their immediate reaction.
All things said, the movie does have it's flaws with certain observations of time moving faster or slower than it should and a few others but those are more nit picks than serious contradictions.

The whole losing-her-kid thing didn't do anything for me either.  I'm not sure if it was the delivery, or there just was no character development, or whatever, but it didn't bring me back into the story.

Actually. Those kind of reviews are inadvertently a positive broadcasting for how much depth there really is to this film.

Yes this film is by far the best space film since Kubrick's 2001. Yes i said it.
I would liken it to a 'religious experience'. I cried.
It was a spiritual wake up call to how precious life on this planet really is. It changed my whole perspective.

The film is a real to life depiction of life, and danger, in space with our current real-life level of technology.
Its important to this keep in mind before viewing. This is not a science fiction film at all.
It is so grounded in reality and current tech, only the hypothetical possibility of the events and details of the story are a fiction.

So don't expect lasers and aliens, and if your looking for something to shut up your brats while they scarf down some fries you might want to rent a cartoon about wise-cracking inanimate objects instead.

So ignore the bad reviews from the bungled and the botched, and prepare to have your vision of reality adjusted by...

Besides a weak, hackneyed plot, the laws of physics are ignored in small and big ways as well as a few other basic facts. But visually, the film is enjoyable.

5871652,2,B00DY64A3U,"As far as space movies go this one didn't seem to know which way to go except down.  I suppose Alfonso Cuaron wanted to create something visceral that would give us a better sense of what it is like in space, but the result is basically Speed in space with George Clooney in place of Keanu Reeves.  Poor Sandra Bullock is left bouncing off one satellite after another until she finally manages to get inside a Chinese capsule for her descent back to earth.  Clooney more or less helps guide her in what amounts to little more than a fevered dream.

You get little sense of any of the characters or what their purpose in space is.  It seems set in the past as the United States is still using space shuttles, which it scuttled 3 years ago.  Yet, the Chinese appear to have a space station, which is not set to be put into orbit until 2020.  So your guess is as good as mine when the action takes place.  None of it seems to really matter other than to show Bullock try to decipher Chinese letters to get her back home.

The odd thing to me is why the Academy thought so highly of this movie to bestow Cuaron with an Oscar.  There was nothing much to praise in this film.  Cuaron has done much better movies, as have Clooney and Bullock for that matter.  This was some kind of a 12-year-old's vision of space as he or she might dream up at Space Camp.",1401753600,,1349,4.206225680933852

If you know anything about physics, this movie will drive you nuts with the implausible situations that are depicted from the start to the end of the movie. The complete opening of the movie is implausible- the colliding satellites aren't in the same orbital altitude as the space station- the astronauts would have hours, days, or weeks notice the dibris would reach them- all sorts of solutions could be employed to keep the astronauts safe. The plot would have collapsed right there. The physics of bodies in space acted on by external forces don't behave as depicted in the movie in almost every case. The psychology of the astronauts weren't very realistic, either- people won't make it to astronaut status if they can't remain calm and sort through multiple life and death technical problems before they EVER go to space. As smart as Sandra Bullock's character might have been, there would be little to no likelihood that she could reprogram a Russian spacecraft's system to make it into a lifeboat. The CGI is spectacular, but the director should have budgeted funds for some technical experts to guide the movie such that the foolish storyline could have been avoided. My impression is the director didn't like being told his storyline was juvenile and stubbornly was going to make the movie his way.

5871732,4,B00DY64A3U,"GRAVITY (2013) is a well-acted Science Fiction film featuring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. It  has superior special effects and is genuinely touching in 2 or 3 places ... but, sadly, it has dozens of major plot-holes I just could not overlook.

The plot of GRAVITY is almost identical to that of the contemporaneous movie ALL IS LOST (2013; Robert Redford), in which an aging man making a solo sailing voyage in the Indian Ocean collides with a metal cargo container that rips a large hole in his boat. GRAVITY is quite a bit more engaging because, unlike with Redford's unnamed and taciturn character, we get to know some of the back-story of Sandra Bullock's character and do get to learn her feelings and thoughts almost non-stop ... and GRAVITY's amazingly similar concluding scene is at least 25 times more plausible than the concluding scene in ALL IS LOST.

In GRAVITY, Bullock and Clooney play the two surviving members of a space shuttle that is blasted to fragments by space debris. If we think about possible outcomes while watching, only these six are possible: Bullock and/or Clooney will soon die; Bullock and/or Clooney will survive with serious injuries; Bullock and/or Clooney will survive with little or no damage. No ""Spoiler Alert"" is needed when confirming that, by the end, two of these six outcomes have been presented.

As for the major plot-holes, most of them concern the orbiting space debris that not only is all moving at the same incredibly rapid velocity in an incredibly tight formation (which is implausible, given that the debris originated from an earlier collision) but its altitude above Earth happens to coincide perfectly with that of the American shuttle craft ... AND a Russian space station ... AND a Chinese space station (which is hugely implausible), AND this debris is on an absolutely perfect collision course, one after another, with all three (despite the fact that space is three dimensional, meaning there are TWO major variables besides ""altitude above Earth"" to be considered in any collision ... and the fact that virtually all orbits are elliptical, not circular, which MEANS that ""altitude"" will fluctuate in almost every object's case).

FURTHER, there is the fourth variable of TIME ... and here is where a ""slight"" SPOILER WARNING is needed. I won't waste words here about the fact that the American shuttle and the Russian and Chinese space stations were all moving objects. Instead, let's consider some ""WHAT IF--?"" propositions (the kind of thing nerds of all ages like doing when reading or viewing Science Fiction / Speculative Fiction): WHAT IF Sandra Bullock's and George Clooney's characters were outside their shuttle, exposed to debris, when it destroyed their craft? And what if they were totally unharmed despite hundreds of very near misses? What, then, are the odds that (given the three dimensions of space AND the time variable) the debris would go around and around the Earth and arrive and destroy the Russian space station at almost exactly the time Bullock and/or Clooney arrived there? And WHAT IF, when Bullock and/or Clooney arrived at the Chinese space station, the EXACT SAME THING happened there at THAT time to THAT space station?

I'm not NECESSARILY saying that these things DO occur in the film, but IF they do, are you prepared to ignore them?

Weighing the nature of GRAVITY's story--its ""Admiration Plot"" that is designed to make us feel good when we see people being brave and resourceful when faced by an array of life-threatening situations--against the screenwriter's lamentable lack of ingenuity, and factoring in the acting, the attractiveness of Bullock and Clooney, and the wonderful special effects of the opening scenes, IF I were giving this film a letter grade, it would be a ""B-"".",1401494400,17,3791,5.027070063694268

Much like Avatar wow'ed me in 2008, so did Gravity. The opening shot of the Earth left me totally breathless.

The sound design is stellar, the soundtrack is perfection. I bought the soundtrack as soon as I left the theater.

The script does require you suspend your disbelief at least to some level, even though the film tries very much to be authentic and realistic. I wan't nitpick on fine details, because the movie is not about upholding absolute realism, it's about the journey back on solid ground for one lone survivor.

On the acting level, SB delivers, and so does Clooney.

Bonus star: that long tracking single shot when the shuttle is hit. Wowza.

I didn't feel it was necessary for her to have such a tragic backstory, and it detracted from the emotional relevance for me.

Sandra is Dr. Ryan Stone, a brilliant engineer who with astronaut Gregory Kowalski are attempting to fix a satellite in space. Unfortunately a disaster occurs destroying their only ride back to earth and now attached to each other, they must make it to the International Space Station as their only hope to get home safely. Disaster after disaster strikes and Dr. Ryan, who in the beginning appears to be withdrawn and a somewhat sad and lonely woman, finds strength she did not know she had. The last half of the movie is strictly Sandra and proves why she is an Oscar winner. She is a strong personality that can carry just about any storyline if it is written and directed well. My opinion, she should have won the Oscar, hands down. And while I like George Clooney, he was good in the supporting role as aging astronaut because Sandra Bullock was beside him. I did however wish the director and/or writer would have made it a bit more realistic when it came to the antics he(Kowalski) pulls while Dr. Ryan attempts to fix the board on the satellite.

5871903,3,B00DY64A3U,"I enjoyed the special effects very well.  Good enough to make the unrealistic, sentimental story tolerable. Cuaron doesn't seem to understand the kinds of people who would staff a space mission, and the level of discipline in their training. As the director/co-writer of ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" he proved himself capable of great work. This story was an ambitious attempt to show a professional woman facing life problems that she had avoided, as she struggled to avoid death. For me, the brief working relationship with the more experienced astronaut was insufficient to bear the weight of an inverted telescope peering into her past, and the ""old-timer's old stories"" from the retiring astronaut struck me as simply unprofessional. Astronauts don't take time for such nonsense! In addition, Bullock's character showed no passion for her work, which all of us who do reasearch share. Yet it generates sympathy for the main character even though she bears no resemblance to someone who might do such a job, and there is no denying that this film provides exceptional 3D thrills and kinetic excitement.",1400803200,,1097,5.128491620111732

old Russian ship...reads some manuals and lands back on earth.  That's it!  How or why did it get 4 or 5 stars I'll never know...wasn't the story line.  Acting?  basically its panic in a space suit. Watch the preview and you won't need to rent or buy this one.",1400457600,4,668,4.487603305785124

The truth is however that this movie is completely riveting. I was captivated from the beginning to the end. If you need an escape from reality, this is it.

I actually ordered it here and did not have time to watch it, but then it came on Pay Per View on my cable network so I watched it that way, not that that has anything to do with it, though.

I had seen an interview with Sandra Bullock on some show relating about how she had to be in perfect physical fitness because she was almost always suspended by wires in front of a blue screen -- they were not in an anti-gravity situation, which makes it so impressive at how she and George did in this.  They had to be able to hold poses in mid air AS IF THEY WERE FLOATING IN GRAVITY, but they were NOT!!!  SO I SAY KUDOS TO YOU TWO, SANDRA AND GEORGE!!!!  YOU ARE AMAZING!!!!  I would almost like to see a movie about how it was made, but not enough to buy a DVD.

Anyway, we all know movies are to an individual's personal tastes, so I will just state the way that I personally felt and the reasons why:  The special effects were extremely amazing and incredibly good!  The storyline was interesting.  I wanted more at the end, though.  I wanted to see what happened after.... (not to spoil anything for anyone).

So aside from wishing there was more followup at the end, 4 thumbs up!  One middle finger for the ending.  LOL

She gets knocked into open space! What does she do? Freak out frantically and waste oxygen, of course.

But I gave it a try and I'm glad I did. There are metaphors of life I seen laced throughout the movie such as not giving up on yourself when someone you love is no longer in your life. I think a peak of the characters' life on earth/flashbacks (mainly Bullock's) would have possibly made an even more emotional connection to what she was going through.,1400198400,3,547,4.269230769230769

The acting and direction were fine enough, and the much talked-about special effects lived up to the hype. However, the major failing of the movie was the script, which was anything but riveting. The main problem was having Sandra Bullock's character carry on her struggle alone for a great deal of the film. Whenever George Clooney's character appeared on screen, the movie worked better (even considering a cheap manipulative trick in the script that eventually falls flat that I can't say much about without a major spoiler). If watching a flick involving the struggle of astronauts trying to survive after a disaster in space is what you're after, a far better choice would be Ron Howard's exceptional ""Apollo 13,"" which was released nearly 20 years ago now but still holds up after all these years.",1399939200,,960,4.824242424242424

It tells a fairly pedestrian survival story which is often told in a number of stories.  The characters are very thin and the focus is really on the special effects.  We learn Sandra Bullocks character lost her daughter but that is told as an aside and does nothing to further the plot.  We see George Clooney as just a cocky guy to give her character a counter balance.  Basically there is nothing in this space.

At each stage of the movie, credibility becomes harder and harder to sustain (although more credible than the outer space movie where a space shuttle was sent to blow up a comet).  Bullock does a good job with her part, so it's too bad the story line had to be structured to throw up one special effect after another, having her surviving not one, not two, not three, but multiple catastrophes, any one of which would almost surely have doomed her.

It would be a good job for private industry to collect trash I guess. The likelihood of this actually happening is extremely small. It would be nice if we had a way to get back into space other than going to Russia.

Sandra Bullock deserves an award for allowing herself to be abused in the making of the film. She has become a great actress and this film proves it, in case anyone has a doubt.",1399680000,,812,4.2727272727272725
5872208,5,B00DY64A3U,"I had to put in a subject line and I thought that would work considering the title of the movie. I mean, how many times can you say It was great! I loved it! Good movie! and so on. I had actually avoided seeing this in the theater because I couldn't imagine how Sandra Bullock floating around in space for two hours could possibly be entertaining. I like to rent movies to kind of play in the background when I'm working, so I didn't see the movie as much as I heard it. So the floating around in space cinematography was a bit lost on me and all I had was the story. And hey, it was great! I even ran through it again so i could see what I'd been hearing. Still good, but if it could work as a story WITHOUT all that visual stuff, that's what made it count. And it definitely did.",1399680000,,781,4.012820512820513
5872209,2,B00DY64A3U,This movie is not the greatest.  I thought it was really boring.  How it ever got rated as a best picture is beyond me.,1399680000,,119,3.9166666666666665
5872210,3,B00DY64A3U,"This is a movie that just does not entertain you all the way through.  It gets slow and has you fearing flashbacks because you wonder how much of the movie they can keep in space.  The main character's life on Earth is sad, and it gets a hell of a lot sadder in space.  Ok, depress me.  But uplift me afterward, please!  Give me some hot action!  Anything!  Gravity does not deliver, in my opinion.  It is depressing, slow, and mildly thrilling during a few scenes.

So why give it a 3?  Because the movie is done VERY WELL.  The scenes in space are as accurate as you can get.  The space station, shuttle, astronaut equipment, etc. look spot on.  You WILL feel like you are in space in 2014 with these characters.  You WILL appreciate the lives of real astronauts and understand why they are semi-crazy daredevils and heroes.  This movie gives you a healthy dose of respect and admiration for the men and women of ALL space programs who risk their lives doing the simplest of things in space.

And the scenes during which the astronauts get trapped in space between equipment are tense.  They just don't keep that tension or deliver many thrills.

I don't know if you've ever been in space, but don't book a trip there--it's terribly quiet, boring, disorienting, and the temperatures are quite deadly.

If you are a space nut or future astronaut, you HAVE TO watch this film.  If not, be forewarned: the story is slow.  Still, many will find it meaningful entertainment.",1399680000,,1471,4.559386973180077

If you take out the special affects and the never ending pretend suspense, there's nothing left.  She's goes from one almost disaster to another without any sense that it's not going to work.

I feel the excitement and media coverage of this film is overrated. There is not much depth or character development in this story. However I do agree that the aerial views are spectacular.

The Hubble will not be repaired ever again.  They are tethered to a shuttle - there are no, and never will be another, shuttle.  The Russians shoot one of their own satilites - this is not only totaly stupid but is in contravention of international treaty.  Then the damage cascades in a matter of minutes - physically impossible, there is a lot of space between satilites.  The shuttle is destroyed and Gearge and Sandra use a back pack to go to the ISS.  That is also impossible as the Hubble is in a much higher orbit than the ISS.  There would be no way to match orbital velocity.

Making-of featurettes  went really in depth with not only how they did the special effects, but delved heavily into story aspects and character as well.  I spent more time with the bonus features than it took to watch the movie.  The sound and video quality is unmatched.  Would highly recommend this Bluray combo.  The only caveat would be the DVD that comes in this package does not have the bonus features the Bluray does.  This was of little concern to me because I bought it for the Bluray, not the DVD.  But if you have a laptop or something that doesn't have a Bluray drive in it and you want to enjoy the bonus features on the laptop with the DVD, you won't be able to.

5872433,2,B00DY64A3U,"I really like Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, but I did not like this movie.  Sandra Bullock being panicky and freaked out throughout the movie does not make a plot.

5872435,5,B00DY64A3U,Some people who view this movie as just a unrealistic space flick are confused. There is so much more here. I was really touched by the Life vs. Death angle. It was a pleasant shock to see the depiction of the struggle to survive and portrayal of our need for human spirituality to cope with inevitable death is heartbreaking. This movie is more than special effects. Almost every scene is emotionally breathtaking. Simply amazing movie. One of the best I've seen. Thank you Alfonzo Cuaron.,1399075200,,490,4.776470588235294
5872436,1,B00DY64A3U,Totally boring. What else can you say... beutifully filmed but I started to just stop it . I love Sandra . I hope she can find a good film with intetaction with other actors. A waste of time and money.,1399075200,,201,4.05

5872438,4,B00DY64A3U,"Sandra Bullock plays Dr. Stone on her first space mission, carefully repairing an external instrument on the Space Shuttle while veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski, played by George Clooney, playfully zooms around in his space suit, untethered and wisecracking and trying to distract her. Mission Control abruptly warns them to go back inside the shuttle since the Russians have blown up one of their own satellites and unleashed a massive debris field that lies in their path. They are subjected to some very rough treatment once the debris hits, and they never make it back into the shuttle which is essentially destroyed. Dr. Stone's tether snaps and she spins out of control for a nauseatingly long period of time before Matt reaches her and attaches her to his space suit. The drama continues from there. They are in a life and death struggle in the most inhospitable environment possible - deep space where there is no gravity and no oxygen and no one to call if you're in a jam.

There's not much else I can report about the action without spoiling the plot, but it is at times intense and nerve-wracking. The special effects are superb. I would love to see a ""making of the movie"" documentary, but no bonus features were included on the DVD. The scenes inside the destroyed space ships are apocalyptic, and the views of beautiful earth from many miles above are just breathtaking.

There are only two actors in the film, other than a few other voice overs, and Bullock has the lion's share of dialogue and acting. Her journey, as she calls on untapped reserves of strength to face the dangers in space, is the central theme of the movie. Though this was an impressive performance by Bullock, the rather thin plot of the movie was not enough to elevate this into the ranks of memorable movies that you would want to watch over and over.",1398988800,,1840,4.711180124223603

With the lowered price that was posted for a short time, the purchase certainly seemed worth it, and my group of friends and I enjoyed it immensely.  The 3D was extremely effective and sometimes quite intense on my 106"" projector/screen combination, and the sound (I believe it was an HD Master Audio track) was at least as good as what I heard in the theater.  Sandra Bullock's amazing performance came across even stronger in my home theater setting (and perhaps because I was seeing the film for the second time and had a greater appreciation for her achievement).

There are always tolerances for reality in science fiction movies, but Bullock, a medical engineer, instantly becomes an expert astronaut, pilot, and navigator?  I don't think so.  The special effects are breathtaking, but that is now a given.  The reality of the movie is so hokey I didn't even make it to the end.",1398902400,6,439,4.723684210526316

I typically don't pay much attention to other people's criticisms of movies and I like to make up my own mind, but it turns out that many of the critics were correct. I'm a very open-minded person and forgiving, perhaps to a fault, but I kept waiting for something else to happen. I'm not sure what that something else is, or even how I selfishly wanted it to transpire for my own entertainment, but it was lacking substance for me. There were moments where I could feel the anxiety of the astronauts, but that quickly dwindled to, ""Okay, what else can we have here?""

5872490,4,B00DY64A3U,"I was really excited about watching this movie because what is better than some Sandra Bullock and George Clooney?? Very few things.

I was a bit surprised by the overall plot, however. Right out of the gate there is plenty of action and drama. Which I like! But at the same time, it really caught myself and others watching off guard. Maybe we were expecting a little more of an Apollo 13 break in. This is one of those movies that is pretty fast paced in terms of changing of events, and you get a little bit of background information on the characters as you go. This is what I didn't like. I wanted to know more about what they were doing and why they were there right from the beginning and we never really got a straight answer. It was so packed with space adventures that they never told us the simple answer: what they were installing on the shuttle to begin with and what it did. A pretty moot point in the scheme of things, but one that all 3 of us watching wanted to know!

There were times when things got REALLY unrealistic as well. And because of that, intense scenes turned laughable. Skip to the *End Spoiler* for the rest of the review.

*Slight spoiler, but general note about a scene*

For example: Not that I'm a rocket scientist, but I'm a little skeptical that an air tank has enough power to propel a person 1/2 mile+ through space and into a descending orbit of another satellite. I did actually pay some attention during the ""outer space gravity and orbit"" section of my undergrad physics class...

*End spoiler*

The amounts of time that certain characters were involved with the movie was also surprising. Like I said, This movie was a lot different than I expected...

* General character spoiler alert*

It's more of a one-man-show movie.

*End Spoiler*

And those are my thoughts. It was a very entertaining movie and definitely a different take compared with past movies in this genre. But some parts were a little too out of this world for the skeptical minds watching.",1398816000,2,2001,4.518005540166205

Without giving away the story, let's just say that way too much happened during the movie for the audience to not get to see what the world was like ""after"".

There are too many great movies with crappy endings, making them not great movies after all. It's too bad. Another ten minutes could have been used to answer some questions that I'm sure everybody watching the movie collectively have.

Other than a really disappointing ending, it was a pretty good and entertaining movie. I would recommend it.

Ok my first thing is that the graphics were wonderful beautiful and exquisite but as much as I can go on all about how beautiful the graphics were there was the problem with the realism. In the beginning it had realism they talked normal, small talk and when the debris started to destroy the space shuttle I thought
""Well this is something that may happen sometimes""
I kept watching intently and was surprised when all the disasters were happening I still thought this was a situation that didn't happen often but was realistic ok so when Ryan and Matt find each other she panicked I can understand that finds man dead understand then when they get to the Russian shuttle the first thing I noticed was that the parachute was all tangled within it. Now when Matt let's go I stoped right there looking at the screen I thought
""He...was right in front of you , you could of tug on his hand and boom he come back""
I do not believe that they were that close to the atmosphere. I'm going to state one thing that really caught my attention the whole time how much damage there was one that's the point where I no longer thought there was realism. When she explains about her daughter ...that's what gave me the third star in stead of one. Why ... Why was the ending so appalling to me let's see because the fact that she could of landed somewhere where she might not be able to find someone to help her ,she just came from space and she's weak she could die out there.

Well, sometimes the situations that the movie puts the character in doesn't give them time to develop a character.  Yet, I found that based on the events that was happening, it wasn't that important.  You still get a sense of who Sandra's character is and her own inner conflicts.  Without saying much more, I recommend this movie immensely.",1398470400,6,437,4.76
5872639,3,B00DY64A3U,"Apparently, ""Time"" called it ""The Best Movie of the Year"" and USA today said it was ""A Bracing Masterpiece"". It also won 7 Oscars and was nominated for ""Best Picture"".

All I can say is...

WHAT KIND OF CRACK ARE THOSE PEOPLE SMOKING?!!!

Don't get me wrong. It's enjoyable on a certain level. The 3D is pretty good.  But the acting is pedestrian, the script is implausible, and the entire story is highly predictable.

Was watching it the other night when I said, ""Right about now, Clooney should show up knocking on the glass"". *Exactly* on cue, Clooney shows up knocking on the glass.

Very basic and mostly boring storyline. Astronauts get stranded in space and try to get home. Come on, did you really think they'd let ""America's Sweetheart"" die in space?

Ugh. Not horrible, but I expected a lot more.

P.S. I noticed that I lot of the negative reviews are getting ""not helpful"" ratings.  While I can't control what you do, I'd ask you not to nail me, as this truly is my honest opinion, even if you disagree with it.  Conversely, if you find the review useful, then ""helpful"" ratings are appreciated! :-)",1398470400,2,1111,4.593908629441624

I don't do a lot of movie reviews but this movie intrigues me. I don't think I am giving anything away when I share that this is basically a movie about two people in space. While there is some breathtaking CGI and other special effects, this is largely a story about people and how they handle the unthinkable and the seemingly insurmountable.

Sandra Bullock continues to amaze me. I never thought the girl from Speed and The Net could have matured into the actress who can deliver such strong, character delivered performance as she has in 'The Blindside' and 'Gravity'. She skillfully delivers a performance that makes this movie something more than some sort of epic disaster flick in space and  more about the harrowing of a person. Her character is laid bare in this movie; she is not some steely-eyed heroine but a human who realizes that the perils of space are not the greatest threat to her survival.

It's refreshing to see the sci-fi genre approached in a more realistic manner. Gravity is basically a disaster film set in space. The action happens early and almost non-stop. Despite involving astronauts and whatnot, the plot remains simple. The visuals are stunning and the effects are (mostly) believable.

There was less character development than I expected, to be honest, but I was fine with that. I felt like the acting was secondary to the intense action.

I recall the 3D movies of ""yesteryear"" (westerns mostly) that amped up the feeling of every thing literally  flying off the screen at me. This is not like that. I found the 3D version to be much more subtle, adding a depth dimension thereby enhancing the scene.

In some aspects, the movie reminded me somewhat of the movie ""Phone Booth"" starring Colin Ferrell, or the old James Stewart movie ""Rope.""  It felt very much like the entire movie consisted of just one set and, in my opinion, even felt like it was filmed in just one take.  It was pure action and eye candy from start to finish.  I was amazed at how intense it all was and the action never seemed to let up over the entire course of the movie.  Even the several moments when things got quiet, there was so much drama in those scenes that, it still felt like an action movie.

All in all, the movie was quite short.  Just 90 minutes.  But, it was so action packed, maybe the length was correct.  Had it went on for another hour, perhaps it would have been too much.

I'm happy I saw it.  I'll probably watch it again tomorrow.

I'm tempted to dock it for not having a normal storyline like can be found in 99% of all of the other movies I've ever seen...but, honestly speaking, I kind of liked it.  It was out of the ordinary and I really appreciate it.

I will however dock it one star for profanity.  It is, after all, just a gimmick, isn't it?  Isn't it time for that particular fashion to begin to fade away for a while?  Thats what Id like anyway.",1398384000,,1330,4.2103174603174605

5872730,5,B00DY64A3U,Awesome. Deeply spiritual movie. Felt ready to face the world again after seeing Ryan's triumph over defeat. This was a tremendous movie,1398211200,,136,5.2272727272727275
5872731,3,B00DY64A3U,"Sandra Bullock is the worst A-list actress out there; she was utterly not believable as a female astronaut.  I have met several women NASA astronauts, starting with Sally Ride, and I have found them all brilliant, smart, savvy, tough as nails, friendly, and interesting.  Bullock portrays a whiny, wimpy scientist would would never in a million years be allowed up in space, at least by NASA. She's never changed from SPEED, 20 years ago.

The technical/scientific aspects of the film are full of holes, as Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson has already pointed out.

The movie should be great but is only okay.

Far better is the very short ""sequel"" to the film that you can find at HollywoodReporter... it's a short sequence showing the other side of the call with the eskimo/arctic hunter with the baby and the barking dog.  Ties the film together beautifully.",1398211200,5,852,4.841379310344828

5872733,3,B00DY64A3U,The hype over this movie caused me to be disappointed when I saw it.  It had good special effects but seemed condescending  The fact that George Clooney coached Sandra Bullock on through challenges played into the stereo type of women with less competency and who need the cool dude to be successful.  That is an old story line and to my knowledge not consistent with the women in the space program.  I guess I am a realist and like movies with a realistic story line.,1398211200,,468,4.470588235294118

5872736,5,B00DY64A3U,"*Spoilers* This movie is deeper than people are giving Alfonso Curan credit for.  For those who may be familiar to his work, he is all about layering and illustrating deeper themes through acting and cinematography.  It's not just a story lateral story he's giving, there's always a deeper message.

Face-value you have a edge-of-your-seat thriller taking place in outerspace.  Deeper imagery clearly presents the ideal of Rebirth, or second chances.  Sandra Bulloch plays a single mother who still grieves for the loss of an only child.  She's the focal point of the whole film, even George Clooney is just a supporting role, who acts as more of a guild for Sandra's character.  It follows the proverbial rebirth of Sandra's character after a tramatic accident on a space station.

I get that not all people aren't familiar with seeing metaphors and underlying themes in movies.  But going into the movie knowing there's going to be something deeper to keep an eye on than just the ""adventure"" of how she survives it what makes this movie so satisfying.",1398211200,3,1054,4.943181818181818

I remember hope floats and the net. Speed was good also. She is vibrant and fun loving. But please- come on - An astro physicist and an astronaut?  So, dings for casting. Then George with his cameo appearance. There should not have been any credits for him. OK, visuals were great- but over and over and over again... And OH boy - whom were their science advisors?? That is what I was most embarrassed by. lets face it- they missed their mark in a bunch of areas and it was a waste of money.

I felt that I was actually watching people in space, All of the careful procedures that the trained astronauts followed did not diminish the constant feeling that something was about to go wrong, and go wrong badly. When disaster struck, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, especially since the happenings were unexpected (as they should be). The actors were superb, but the major player was the weightlessness and other dangers of trying to stay alive in space.",1398124800,,514,4.988372093023256

I will not ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it. The spoiler for me was that Amazon could not deliver the movie uninterrupted.  I got a message that the video was loading several times throughout the movie, for those who have used Netflix in the past, it was very much like the buffering message. This is the first time I have received this notice from Amazon, I have watched many TV programs and movies through this service. I hope it was a 1 time event.",1398124800,,586,4.425925925925926

5872781,3,B00DY64A3U,"Granted, the special effects were outstanding -- worth seeing in 3D and on the big screen simply for that reason.  The story, however, was lacking in depth.

5872802,3,B00DY64A3U,"What a terrifying idea!  Stranded in the space with little oxygen in your tank while trying to dodge super speed projectiles!  I wasn't all that sold on the idea of some randomly shot down satellite destroying basically everything floating around the orbit including the ISS and the Chinese station.  You would think the Russians would put more thoughts into shooting down their equipment if there's even a tiny possibily of this happening?  I don't know if this is a universally accepted way of disposing old satellites but wow, they need to stop doing this just in case.

Anyhow, so basically, we just follow Sandra Bullock space station hopping until she can find an escape pod that will bring her back down to Earth.  The visual was pretty impressive.  I don't think I've ever seen anything like it but there's really no story attached to the movie.  She just moves on from one establishment to another... narrowly escaping destruction.  They try to make both characters human and introduce some background stories but didn't do much for me, really.  I do wonder what happened to George Clooney's character.  What a way to die.

Ultimately, it's like watching suped up version of NOVA.  Everything looks gorgeous.  Sandra Bullock did a great job showing her fear and utter helplessness of being stranded in space.  Other than that, it's just an eye candy movie with lots of explosion and the characters spinning around.  The movie was over before we knew it and we moved on.",1398124800,,1478,4.852

5872822,2,B00DY64A3U,".... .and, unfortunately, very little else to recommend this movie.  Some of the scenes in this movie are so preposterous as to be laughable.  In one silly sequence, Bullock boards a Russian space station and finds the attached shuttle just as a fire is engulfing the station itself.  She doesn't know how to operate the shuttle, of course, but immediately finds an instruction manual - written in Russian now, mind you, and in less than a minute is operating the controls like a veteran.  She expertly pilots the shuttle to a Chinese space station and finds another instruction manual, but apparently isn't able to read Chinese, so uses the ""eeny meeny miney mo"" method of selecting which buttons to push to guide the station back into the earth's atmosphere.  That was easily the most ridiculous sequence of events I've seen since Kurt Russell boarded a 747 through its belly in mid-flight, and found the instruction manual that allowed the plane to be landed safely in the dire ""Executive Action"".  If you're determined to purchase this turkey, get the blu-ray for the stunning images of the Earth from outer space.  You won't miss much by not turning the volume on, though.",1398038400,,1177,4.855

I went in excited to watch it because of the reputation it has, and the subject matter being right up my alley.  First of all how did Bullock get nominated for best actress in this?  Her character is bland, whiny, annoying and doesnt envoke one ounce of empathy.  The character development is horrible.  Everything about this movie is so far fetched, nothing realistic about it.  The whole dog-barking scene was so cringe-worthy.

The beginning was fine with the damage to the shuttle a real possibility, but that is where it ends. It comes down to hoping to space station s in ways that would work every one in a million tries if that. Once they get to the I international space station it is practically undamaged how is this. Then they kill off a character for no reason. They stopped moving but something was still exerting a pull defing physics. Also how does the main character survive flying into jagged parts of a station every two minutes. Sure those suits are built fairly rugged, but not enough to stop shop pieces of metal flying at least a couple hundred miles an hour.

This movie is a visual masterpiece. It is all about the visual effects for this movie. If you like a great story, you might not like the one in this movie. However, the visual effects will not let you down.

I couldn't believe that people actually enjoyed the heavy breathing and whining of Sandra Bullock for nearly 2 hours. This movie was seemingly supposed to simulate the feeling of emptiness, hopelessness, and loneliness while Bullock struggles to survive and overcome these feelings, but everything in this movie was completely unrealistic. I don't normally mind when movies are like that (I won't dock a star if someone shoots their gun 15 times in a western or something like that), but this movie was just ridiculous. I wanted to leave the theater but I just had to believe something was going to happen, so I stayed. Much to my disappointment that moment never came and the movie ended.

5872876,4,B00DY64A3U,"Gravity has been universally acclaimed by film critics and general audiences as a cinematic masterpiece-- a movie that perfectly bends the elements of science fiction with a genuine story. It is a fascinating experience due to its cutting-edge visual effects, its musical score, and a story that keeps the audience captivated until the end.

The movie stars Sandra Bullock, who plays the character of Dr. Ryan Stone, a genius medical scientist who is on her first mission to repair the Hubble Telescope. On the other end of the spectrum is George Clooney, who plays the character of Matt Kowalski, a highly trained and experienced astronaut who is on his last space mission. The movie begins with a light-hearted tone as all the characters are joking, listening to songs, and telling stories. However, this simple and routine space mission turns into a tragedy when debris from the Russian satellite, traveling at tremendous speed, literally spirals their mission out of control. The tranquil atmosphere in the beginning is transformed into a chaotic one until the very end. The entire movie follows the story of these stranded astronauts in an infinite space as they struggle against overwhelming odds to get back to the Earth.

The plot is similar to other movies of this genre, such as Apollo 13 and Space Odyssey, with the same elements of horror and tension, but it also different on many levels because Gravity offers much more than just astronauts trying to cope with a disaster. The use of extended, uninterrupted shots in which the audience can feel the silence of the space is cleverly contrasted with brief, chaotic scenes in which the audience can understand the unpredictability of the space. Beyond its thrilling plot, are the multidimensional characters who further makes the movie interesting. Gravity has only three major characters, but this number is reduced to two and eventually to only one for almost half of the movie. Despite of all the difficulties of a solo performance, Sandra Bullock delivers it perfectly. One of Bullock's best scenes is when she rests in an embryonic position shortly after she survives the first disaster and when she regains her capability to walk and stand upright, suggesting the formation and the resilience of life in the space and the Earth.

The most impressive element of this movie is neither its captivating plot, nor its appealing characters, but its dazzling visual effects. From the very beginning of the movie, the audience is left mesmerized by Alfonso's ability to capture the very essence of the space. The movie opens with a magnificent shot--a tiny dot gets bigger and bigger, eventually revealing the astronauts, the space mission, and the Earth from over 600 km above. These thrilling visuals and breathtaking views of the space continue throughout the movie. Adding to the visual artistry are the themes and imagery. Although the movie is entirely set into space, it still contains many of the universal themes such as the will to survive, psychological change, and the resilience of life. While themes such as an enduring will to survive the disaster was unoriginal, some others such as the evolution of human and the hint that life may have come from space were very creative and informative.

When all these elements are combined, Gravity, essentially, is a masterpiece. It is much more than a space mission gone wrong and more thrilling than just a space adventure movie. It is one of the best science fiction films in many years. I highly recommend watching this movie in 3D to understand how wonderful, yet horrifying the space can be.",1397865600,,3611,5.023372287145242

The whole movie consists of a chain of events that are less likely to happen than getting hit by lightning 200 times in one day. Really... space debris might be a real concern but somehow the main character finds herself in this situation where space debris are about to kill her, over and over and over and over.

Yeah, that's so unrealistic because satellites colliding has never happened in 50 years of thousands of satellites being launched into the orbit, and somehow this woman has near-death experience over and over and over and over until I'm left thinking ""really?""

I am a big fan of Sandra (okay, and George too) so for me to have to say that makes me kinda sad. I almost couldn't finish the movie but stuck it out and then kicked myself for sticking it out because the end... well, it sucked.

PLOT (No Spoilers)
Strong beginning. Eh - middle. Lame end. That pretty much sums up the entire movie. Good actors, terrible script. WHERE ARE THE REAL WRITERS OUT THERE? Not many good movies have come out lately, period :(

VISUAL EFFECTS
Amazing! But you can't base a whole movie around great special effects and no plot! (Or maybe you can! Who are all these people giving this movie 3, 4 & 5 Stars? WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE? Are we really that hard up for the next big blockbuster? Again, where are all the great writers out there?!?!)

~*~SPOILER ALERT~*~
They're in space. She floats off into space. George tells her how they can get home then he dies. She goes a little crazy. Fire in space. Pretty special effects. Hallucination of George coming back to calm her down and tell her what to do again. She does what the hallucination say and VIOLA! She gets home. End on her kissing the land after dragging herself out of the capsule. TA-DA! And the worst part is that I will never get that 1+ hour of my life back :(",1397779200,13,1379,4.251908396946565

Though the special effects were great (uhh, suspend your belief in real world physics though) and the acting was top notch, the movie, for me at least, tended to drag a bit in spots and was, to some extent, predictable. In my opinion, and its only my opinion, the movie would have benefited from more conversational interaction between Clooney and Bullock.

The movie was amazing and highly recommended. Sandra's haircut was the only ""bad"" part of the movie. The movie gave me enough sense of being in outer space that, if ever given the opportunity, I would kindly pass. Couldn't get pass the feeling of flipping over and over again headed to nowhere. One of my favorites of late.

The movie felt VERY realistic to me, because of my interest/knowledge of the facts.  I was surprised how much I liked the actual story line.  Always love Sandra Bullock, I felt like I was right there with her, while she went through all that hell.  Even if you are NOT a big space buff like me, you will love this movie.

Some of the scenes were not very complete with the details of how she recovered from the latest fiasco.  If they were trying to be realistic, they weren't very thorough.

And when George was hanging on to the rope attached to Sandra, she could have just pulled him in.  He let go like he was hanging from a tree.  Once he was stopped he would have stayed in that same spot or orbit.  After all there is no gravity in space!",1397606400,2,551,4.3861386138613865

This is a one that is done better then most and keeps the story more in the real world of space travel.  The space shuttle program may now be a historical footnote but we know that it was not devoid of tragedy and loss of life. The story here presents another element of that risk rarely explored, the possibility of a spacecraft getting hit by a meteor or small asteroid.  That is what happens here within the first 5 minutes and the rest of the film deals with how one astronaut, played by Sandra Bullock, attempts to survive and get back to earth.

The ride is intense, dramatic, and relatively short but still worth the experience. This is a well made film that uses some amazing modern CGI for visuals that draw you into it.

5873089,2,B00DY64A3U,"Made the mistake of picking up Gravity on DVD...I wish I hadn't!  That this movie is so popular is incredibly sad.

First of all, why would floating-around-George-Clooney 'hold her back' with the strap once his momentum had been stopped in space so he has to let go?  Aren't there other ways to make him a hero?  There is no ""gravity"" in space to pull him down!  Once his momentum had been stopped, she should have been able pull him in with just a small tug!  That had even been shown earlier in the movie!  How does this make this movie so 'realistic' as I keep seeing in the reviews?  Is it 'realistic' because they tell us that there is no air or sound in space?  WHOA!  I guess that explains why she couldn't just duck her head out the window and shout down to the people in Houston about what was going on...

Second of all, why would the Russians (of course) retire a satellite with a missile?  That is never done, they are always crashed into the ocean and I don't even think it is possible....  And what kind of 'chain reaction' can there be anyway?  Are these satellites just lined up like dominoes???  How is that realism?

Third, since when are astronauts just a bunch of goofballs who like country music and only care about jetting around in circles in their jet packs?  Since when does the Chinese gov't sanction religious figures (Buddhas) in their space station?  Since when can you phone home from space on AM radio and talk to a dog for an hour?  Dumb. Was it 'realistic' because of all of the buttons & lights & antennae & doo-hickies on all of the space stations????

Fourth, why do I feel like I've just been subjected to some kind of religious propaganda?  Is the message that all scientists are atheist until they are in space and their lives are in danger, and then they all of a sudden recognize that there is a heaven and that gives them meaning and the will to live and survive?  ....and after all, science just causes all these space problems anyway, and the world would be better if all the satellites just crashed, and we have no business looking at space at all?

Fifth, I don't even know what to say about that incredibly ridiculous ending.  Ick.

Fancy explosions with Sandra Bullock and her zero-gravity boobs & thigh-gap can only take a movie so far....  I did like seeing the Russian capsule bounce back since it was caught in the parachute ropes, but how in the world did this get such positive reviews???  ""Space opera???""(LA Times!)  ""Stunning Space saga?""(Total Film, James Mottram)  Those are real quotes from real reviews from real (professional) reviewers! There were barely 2 characters, and there was no character development at all!  Why wouldn't George Clooney shut the #*@*@ up?  What was she doing up in space?  How was she supposed to get rescued on that island anyway?  Did they forget to shoot the last hour of the movie where she talks to a soccer ball named Wilson?

Very troubled about the state of humanity (including both those who make movies, and those who review them) that this was so successful...  Man, that movie was B-A-D!  Glad it wasn't more than 90min, (and I checked at the 40 min mark), otherwise I would have quit.  I would much rather watch Speed again and see a bus crash.  Leave the space shuttles alone.  It is a good thing that the movie I saw in the theater was the Lego movie, instead of this one, otherwise I might never have gone again!

Fortunately, I did see the Lego movie, and it was awesome, so hope prevails... I'll give it 2 stars for the explosions & special effects--generous.",1397433600,21,3565,4.517996870109546

If you like thought-provoking movies that keep you interested even during slow periods, this is the movie for you.  It's seems relatively predictable but still keeps you anticipating what happens next.  George Clooney is great (he does funny/serious so well) and Sandra Bullock is a likable, vulnerable character. Probably not something younger children would watch attentively (probably a bit slow and cerebral for them). The visual effects are amazing and really help you understand what it must be like out in space. Very simple subject and not a complicated plot but holds your interest. Hard to say much more without giving away too much of the plot (although most people probably already know the basics). If you're wiling to invest emotionally in a movie, it's worth the investment.

The starscapes and debris fields come to life like nothing else I have ever seen before. Watching the space shuttle drift in front of Earth is simply stunning. The 3d images are simply astounding and add (pun intended) a whole new dimension to this movie.

It was well-acted by Sandra Bullock, certainly, and the visuals were amazing, but it's like one long series of bad events after another that eventually ends.  My friend and I watched it together, and she kept repeating every time another bad thing happened, ""Well, it really is her (Bullock's character) worst. Day. Ever."" without trying to be funny.

Bullock's acting was very intense.  Not overdone, and amazing at points.  But the whole movie you're kind of waiting for a breather, which comes with a contact with earth and a lullaby, but then it goes right back into Worst. Day. Ever. Mode, with one bad thing happening after another, with Ms. Invincible continuing to magically defy all odds.  Eventually things end, and you're left just kind of thinking: ""...well, that was a good movie, but Oscar-worthy?... not really other than maybe visuals/special effects.""  I fully ""get"" that this movie is not a typical space action movie but more of a character study.  As a coworker described it, it was basically a one-woman play, but even that doesn't change the fact (for me) that the movie was just not that amazing, which considering the hype (and the actors and director) I thought it would be.

Bottom-line: At $12.99 currently buying the movie is a good deal, but I would still recommend renting it first.",1397347200,17,1482,4.7952755905511815

While I appreciate the fact they got to the point at the start of the movie,  from there on it seemed like it was already starting to drag and it really did not appear realistic to me. Example - When Sandra's character is tumbling out of control through space, she keeps talking about how she is running out of oxygen and George's character finally catches her and even when she is finally out of oxygen their characters are still talking to each other. A good movie will try and appear as real as possible. When your out of oxygen you don't keep talking. A good writer could have worked around that.

The four stars is due to the movie stopping around three times, although I was warned that the HD quality would be lowered to prevent disruptions, I was ok with it, but it said that it was due to not being connected to the internet, which it was or it wouldn't have continued to play... but, I'm new to this, and hopefully it doesn't happen again.",1397260800,,1027,4.218274111675127

The entire time they talked about this and that was a metaphor for something and Mother Earth.  Don't forget the ""rebirth"" liberals always like to talk about.

Wow, I didn't think Bullock could pull it off but her brave performance was very believable and inspired. I expect she will have changed many viewers and directors opinions of the type of role she can play. She was in pretty much every scene and combined well with Clooney. Clooney played ""Clooney in a space suit"" and I found the movie picked up when he wasn't involved.

Maybe it's just because 3D has come so far in the last 10 years, or maybe it's just the right movie for a 3D movie, but either way, it's a hoot to watch with all the lights off.  The HUD from the helmets shows up in a very realistic manner, and I swear I could reach out and touch the floating Marvin the Martian doll.

Gravity pushes the boundaries of holy-cow but manages to stay mostly believable, (for the luckiest person in the world).
Of course there will always be nay-sayers and people with no imagination or bad taste lol who will bash and complain rather than taking the movie for what it is. Pure entertainment value and a wild nonstop ride.

5873453,5,B00DY64A3U,"The answer is Gravity, my personal pick for best movie of the year! (Actually, I have it tied for best with Nebraska, but that is another story.)

I saw Gravity in a good local theater. I eschewed the 3-D venue, didn't want to risk vertigo. Besides, I haven't found 3-D to be all that convincing going back to the days of House of Wax and The Maze. The blu-Ray comes with a 3-D disc, my projector is capable, there is a 3-D player in my rack, I have the glasses .........  I digress.

As good as I found the feature to be at the local cineplex, it was even better on my home theater screen. And, as much as I marveled at how engaging an ""action"" film can be without benefit of automatic weapons, explosives and/or a car chase or three, I was in awe upon watching the blu-ray supplemental materials.

Discovering the degree to which Gravity is a feat of ""engineering"", artistic direction and acting--principally by Ms Bullock, Mr Clooney and the voice of Ed Harris--is not readily apparent. But once you see those wonderful supplements (extras), the facts are revealed. All of which makes owning the blu-ray or DVD a must have.",1396742400,3,1126,4.504901960784314

I always enjoy Sandra and George Clooney's acting but the movie was God awful and so slow I felt myself aging! Was it the worst movie I've seen this month/year? no, but the whole feel and overall experience through the whole movie was less than average/ok.

But a couple of things said in the script at the beginning almost ruined it for me, regarding their position. I had to pause it and walk away for 10 minutes before resuming. Bullock (I think she said both things) said GPS was blown out, not working, and that they were somehow North. North as a space description is just plain ridiculous. It's always possible that GPS has been modified to accommodate 3D space without my noticing, but it probably wouldn't still be called GPS.",1396656000,2,621,4.654545454545454

After the first 10 minutes of gorgeous effects, the remainder of the film was boring, boring, boring. Clooney was a disaster, and Bullock, though she tried her best, was unconvincing - she did not have the gravitas to carry the part. There wasn't a moment in this movie when I thought she could be an astronaut. I don't know, but it seems to me that Hollywood has met its declining trajectile - they just can't seem to develop character in their films nowadays. It is not enough to watch spectacular effects - human beings are about character, but where are the actors that have any, not to mention the producers?

Gravity is a gripping adventure story with nonstop action, but it also has a great story and (for so few characters) very good character development. It had me biting my nails throughout the entire movie, wondering what would happen next.

I wasn't sure whether to purchase this DVD, so I decided to rent it from one of those kiosks you find in your local supermarkets. I figured if I really like it, I'd place my order on Amazon while I wait for the DVD to rewind.

Disclaimer: I am a fan of Sandra Bullock. I have liked her since her The Net and Speed days.

This movie, wasn't what I expected it to be. Looking back, I am not sure what I expected it to be, and I suppose, I went into watching it ""blind"", hoping for being entertained by a movie with two big names (three actually, if you do end up recognizing Ed Harris' voice as he plays the radio contact to the two on-screen stars). Fineprint: I'm also a fan of Ed Harris and enjoy many of Clooney's works.

I can imagine it would have been a fantastic visual display, watching this movie at a 3D IMAX theater. Especially the first 20 minutes or so of the movie with the space-""walks"" and when the disaster strikes.

Without spoiling too much of the plot/movie, broken down, this movie is about the struggle of a woman, with a tragic past, which has caused her to give up hope and nothing to live for. She simply goes through the ""motions"" of life: goes to work, does what is expected of her, and when the work-shift ends she zones out and disconnects from everything around her. Then during the 90 minutes of this movie, her interactions with Clooney's character and the disaster (the epicenter of this movie), put her at a crossroad, where she is forced with a critical decision: give up and let go, or fight to hang on to life.

I think the over ""hype""-ing of this movie caused me to have other expectations, and left me disappointed. Had the ""hype"" not been so exaggerated, and its marketing focus not been the ""space"" aspect of the movie, expectations would have be in check. Alas, not even the movie title has anything to do with the actual plot when you really think about it. The environment, and events that make Sandra's character go through the changes that make the actual plot of the movie are purely incidental. i.e., the same movie/plot could be done, for example, underwater, where the characters are deep-sea divers, and instead of the shuttle getting destroyed, the submarine does, and similar events make our heroine go through the same changes and emerge with similar outcome, and that movie probably would be called ""Pressure"" or ""PSI"" or some other lame title that distracts from the core of what this movie is really about. I digress ...

By the way, for Sandra Bullock fans out there, she is in really fine shape in this movie (assuming there are no computer editing or body-doubles used) and you get to see how great she looks, especially for someone at her age. Physically, she looks far better than her younger years.",1396569600,,2816,4.500978473581213

5873525,2,B00DY64A3U,The beginning of this film starts off where it shouldn't.  We find two Astronauts working on the Hubbell Telescope ... the Shuttle right next to them and they are suddenly without warning told to get the hell out of there.  There is a debris field headed their way that will destroy everything in it's path.  It does!!  This is a story of Murphy's Law with only one winner - Sandra Bullock.  The characters names are not even memorable.  Everything and anything that could go wrong - goes wrong and in the worst possible way.  Throughout the entire movie there is no story except for this one Astronaut to get back to Earth.  The other Astronaut played by George Clooney is killed in the first 15 minutes of the movie so it's definitely not about him.  Sandra Bullock's character goes through a nightmare of a living hell to try to get back to Earth.  She gets back and that's the end of the movie!!  Period!  It's over.

We just progress from Thing Goes Wrong A to Thing Goes Wrong Z at breakneck speed, with some cheesy lines thrown in (which bottoms out when Sandra Bullock starts howling plaintively to a radio broadcast of a dog), while George Clooney plays every character he has played ever, but this time wearing a space suit.

The special effects are good, and the sense of terror of the situation comes through, but apart from that there is no substance to this movie at all. If the directors had slowed it down a little they may have built a bit more credibility into the plot, but as it was, when the surviving astronaut finally surfaces from the ocean at the end of the movie I fully expected to see a shark's fin headed towards her.

If you are looking for anything vaguely intelligent, look elsewhere. This movie has no brain at all.

Having said that, for what it is, Gravity is not bad - a pretty distraction. But a memorable piece of cinema? No way.",1396569600,46,1074,4.469387755102041

5873582,1,B00DY64A3U,"Another reviewer said it best. The awards to this movie are ""worthy of an FBI investigation."" Honestly, the hundreds of negative reviews of Gravity are more entertaining than the movie itself. Case in point: this is revenge on Clooney for the ""infamous nippled batman"" LOL.

It doesn't matter how good the effects are. Throwing special effects around again and again and again, with no plot, does not constitute a movie, especially when most of the script is panicking/panting. There's no backbone to Sandra. In the first half, she is falling apart despite being rescued by Clooney more than once. Then in the second half, somehow we're supposed to believe this same woman pilots both the Russian and Chinese ships by ""eenie meenie minie mo"" on the buttons. I can't think of anything more demeaning to women.

By the way, I know acting is hard (I've tried voice acting for a game, I was terrible). I'm sure it's difficult to act scared and panicky in a believable way. But this single emotion for 90 minutes does not compare to actors who actually carry out dialogue of multiple emotions with multiple characters. One of these could be worthy of an Oscar. The other is not.

For the record, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to knit brows and turn quizzical at some of the stuff that happens. Seems to be a lot of derisive comments towards anyone pointing out that Clooney didn't have to let go, since he was already stopped and motionless relative to Bullock. But all you have to do is, you know, watch the movie? Notice how everything is always flying all over, rebounding and ricocheting, especially when Clooney and Sandra are tethered together, they rebound all over the place. But this one time---nope! no rebound! Instead, he is pulled along by the magical force of hollywood.

Then of course, as soon as Sandra flies off in Soyuz, the same parachute lines are caught on the station and...it rebounds! Doh!

I'm reminded of Meteor (2009 made-for-tv film), which I would've called the worst movie until now. But at least Meteor had a plot...a very flat and poorly, laughably executed plot. Meteor is still way better because it has an excuse as a micro-budget TV film, and at least I can laugh at it. But Gravity?

You could write the entire plot on a post-it note, and  you'd have room to spare to doodle spaceships exploding.  It makes the Star Wars storyline seem like Moby Dick by comparison.  I think you could have left Bullock and Clooney out COMPLETELY and the movie wouldn't have lost much as the special effects pretty much ARE the movie.  What a waste of talent and money.

5873643,5,B00DY64A3U,"This film puts a lot of things about our existence on this planet in perspective. What a fragile little bubble of life we have on Earth. What a vulnerable cocoon surrounds us, separating all this life from absolute nothingness. What's absolutely awesome is that 99.99999999999.....% (not an actual statistic) of the universe is absolute nothingness. And here we are on this precious little bubble.

Here's a little fact you might want to consider the next time you think about human-made global warming. In one billion years, the Sun will have gotten so much hotter (and bigger), that the temperature on Earth will be, on average, 100 degrees (F) hotter than it is now. That means, an average Winter day in San Francisco will be 150 degrees. The Arctic will be a cool 70.

I'm sure, if there is any self-aware life (notice I didn't say, intelligent life) left on Earth, someone will find a way to blame humans for the increased temperature. Wait another billion years and there definitely won't be self-aware life, or any life, for that matter, left on Earth. All water will be gone and the entire surface of the planet will be molten. Talk about a major extinction event! In three billion years, the Sun will have gotten so big that it will take up the entire horizon. How's that for perspective?

WOW, did I go off on a tangent...

Anyway, back to my review of ""Gravity"". Not only does it make you think about the fragility of our existence but it's also a heart stopping thrill ride! Some might think that 3D wouldn't add a whole lot to a film set mostly in space without a lot of foreground or background objects. I found it to be a definite plus. It provided a sense of isolation, panic and devastation that I've never felt with any film that takes place in space.

The special effects are astonishing. The weightless scenes are so believable, I would believe it if I was told the film was actually shot in space. They make the ""Apollo 13"" weightless scenes look amateurish by comparison. And I remember at the time, those effects were astonishing. I couldn't help but think how far they've come, in such a short time.

I almost deducted 1 star because there were a couple of obvious ""Hollywood-ish"" incidents written in the script which made me think to myself, ""oh come on, how stupid could you be?"" But just a couple and I won't spell them out for you. Certainly not enough to detract from the overall experience.

I am very glad that the director kept the movie to about 90 minutes long. It was the perfect length. And you must watch the special features. In the ""Making of"", they show how the space shots were achieved with actors interacting with the Hubble, the Space Shuttle, and floating freely in ways that could never be achieved with wires.

So we bought the Blu Ray, and while it is high quality, it isn't the same experience we had in the theater. Honestly, I didn't expect it to be, but we had to try. It is a very good solid four star film with a strong female character. Bullock does a fine acting job, and Clooney does his usual charming thing.

This film is almost non-stop action and a lot of it heart pounding at that--at least for me.  I found the initial premise of the movie quite plausible given the vast plethora of ""stuff"" (George Carlin would like that!) that is orbiting our beautiful planet.  Other parts of the storyline might have been conveniently stretched to make it work but to me if felt like a super smart, intelligent, courageous woman used all her faculties to overcome the many, HUGE obstacles that she faced to survive.  I really LIKE movies with strong female leads, e.g. Sigourney Weaver in Alien and Aliens.  Sandra Bullock as Dr. Ryan Stone in this film did not disappoint.

Aside from the storyline, I marveled at just ""how did they do that?""  I had read a review that explained in the briefest of descriptions but I still couldn't fathom how it was done.  Well, the good news is that this purchase has two DVDs and the second one shows all that was done to make this film work.  The second DVD was as interesting as the movie itself.  Every single part of the movie making process was profiled and every one of them was fascinating.  I was SO impressed with the courage, determination, time and talent that went into the making of this film.  The innovation of the production team was amazing.  They broke new ground on so many levels.  They have raised the bar and set a new benchmark for future such films.  The second DVD made me like the movie even more and I've watched the ""making it"" DVD twice--it was that interesting and good.

Finally, some information that I wish all movie sellers would put in their descriptions:

  -  It is rated PG-13
  -  It is widescreen ""letterbox"" format so you won't miss anything.  You will see it just as it was presented in the theater.  May I also add here, that this film is best viewed in 3-D but that said, I found nothing lacking watching it at home on my HDTV without 3D.
  -  It is a Digital Ultraviolet movie that you could download from the ""cloud"" which means you can watch it on a variety of devices--a very nice feature, indeed.

YOU WILL LOVE IT!

This a pretty good movie for space cadets (Star Trek and such fans and Space Fans in general) but also borders on a Chick Flick so your girlfriend or your wife might like it as well. I would have like to have seen a little bit more of a lead in to the start of the movie ... at least the shuttle maneuvering into docking with what they were working on The Hubble Telescope? and a bit more after the emergency landing that Sandra Bullock's character made in the Soyuz capsule. It's a bit far fetched that there are 3 International Space Stations and that a US astronaut with not much experience can figure them all out. that all have Soyuz escape capsules with the buttons exactly the same so you can figure it out. Also things must have been pretty screwed as far as satellite communications anyway on Earth to have that much satellite debris that can smash other satellites causing more satellite debris - that can destroy a space shuttle and three International Space stations. Anyway it was a fun ride again via HD with Amazon Streaming video.

The writing was at best lazy. Rather than develop Sandra Bullock's character, they simply gave her a terrible tragedy and tried to make us care about her because something bad happened to her. For me, this not only failed, but it felt contrived and again manipulative.

The action sequences were also lackluster. I've seen them all before in better movies.

The symbolism was ridiculously obvious. I just started laughing when I saw the frog at the end. I don't appreciate being spoon-fed while watching a movie. Let me uncover and discover. Put the cookies on a higher shelf and I'll reach for them. Put them on the bottom, and you insult both of us.

If you want a good action movie, watch The Avengers. At least you'll care about the interesting characters who are giving their lives to save others. As far as I could tell Gravity was about one woman saving her life for herself.

There are no heroes and villains, no monsters in space, no sweet little girls that need to be saved, no Star Wars weaponry, cast of characters designed to appeal to audience demographics. That's why there are so many negative reviews - people like what they've already seen. That's why there's rarely anything new coming out of Hollywood. This was something fresh, and different.

Strictly speaking, this isn't really a science fiction movie either. Everything depicted is current technology.

The action begins almost from the start. Character development unfolds gradually throughout the movie. Although the obvious struggle is between human being and the dangers of space, the more interesting struggle is existential. It's a universal struggle that everyone can relate to, but judging by the naysayer reviews, a lot of people didn't get it.

5873762,1,B00DY64A3U,"I have to report that I watched, quite possibly the most horrible, predictable, far fetched, unbelievable, pointless, intelligence insulting movie in the history of film. This over-hyped, over-expensed, over-rated gem was nominated for 11, that's right ELEVEN, academy awards - including best picture, best director and best actress (apparently for being able to breath heavy). If it wasn't for the unintended comedy that had me laughing at the next ""you've got to be kidding me"" plot twist (assuming there was an actual plot), I would have turned it off after the first 15 minutes. But, since I had spent $40 bucks on the 3D Blu-ray multi-pack as the first movie to watch on my new 3D behemoth TV, complete with make-me-feel-stupid glasses, I felt compelled to press on - and the 3D was cool, so there was that.

I know I would have been an annoying jerk in a packed theater as I chuckled at every death defying moment that likely had the general public on the edge of their seats. Besides the complete lack of any plot structure and the sheer random acts of disaster, there was the added absence of basis in any science reality or even possibility - which would seem to be a rather important starting point in a movie utilizing contemporary NASA at its base. As a side note, I really thought the actress' purported dream sequence should have been left as ""reality"" in the film as it was no more unbelievable than the other scenes. (Which of course makes me wonder how the dream sequence got the makers of this cinematic collection of impossible events to decide that the dream reached the apparent ""we've gone too far"" moment such that it must be a dream - when the other 99 implausible events didn't so qualify. Baffling, really.)

[SPOILER ALERT] I have to admit that I got my better half laughing at the end when I started saying ""watch out for the alligators, the alligators are going to get her"" as the heroine walked out of the mud from which this film exists after she survived every possible - and I really mean every IMpossible - perceived excitement inducing roller coaster ride of disjointed calamities.

This movie had neither a beginning, a middle nor an end. It just seemed to be a slice of a never ending pointless string of scenes strung together without any continuity other than my visualization of 16 year old writers sitting around the table saying ""and then (insert next incredible, ridiculous, special effect laden, without any basis in reality, event) happens."" On a serious note, how does a director win an Academy Award for not really directing anything? Because every - and I mean every - shot was in front of a blue/green screen and/or was 100% CGI. And the actors (there were only two) never had face to face time of over 10 minutes in the entire film. AND the award winning (Golden Globe? You've got to be kidding me!) actress only screamed or breathed heavy or tried to look scared throughout the film. Of course, I recognize that my opinions of this film put me in the minority, so I must consider the possibility that I'm wrong and everyone else is right. Okay, I've considered it - everyone else is wrong.

Although I would recommend you see this dredge simply because watching a train wreck has its own entertainment quality, I would not want to be responsible for even more lining the pockets of the producers who think this film is a product fit for human consumption. While one word titles for films make them memorable and recognizable, a more suitable name for the forces of gravity that attract this film to the landfill of really bad movies is ""Garbage.""",1396224000,16,3597,4.686708860759493

Many movies really solely on their story for entertainment. So worrying about the type of movie Blu-ray or 3-D is not necessary. So this would not normally be entered into a review. However in the case of ""Gravity"" (2013) the visuals of Lake Powell, Arizona, space and Sandra are important enough to warrant Blu-ray and even 3D treatment. I suspect it is just a matter of time before it gets the ""4K"" treatment. And even though space is silent the back ground music adds character and does not distract from the presentation.

Next to you I am probably one of the last people to see this movie. I watched all the hype for and against it.

5873826,4,B00DY64A3U,"Gravity is an incredible film, both in story and form of art. For once, we as an audience are treated to a female heroine that is the exact opposite of Alien's Ripley. This is more than a welcome change in the wake of too many movies featuring butch femme fatales.

Sandra Bullock stars as Dr. Ryan Stone, first time astronaut and mission specialist. She is fragile, bubbly, and is the least likely character in Gravity to conquer the harsh, unpredictable environment of outer space. Dr. Stone is accompanied by a fully staffed crew aboard the Space Shuttle Explorer, including George Clooney as veteran astronaut Lt. Matt Kowalski. The mission is simple: service the Hubble Space Telescope and return to Earth.

A random Russian missile strike destroys a defunct satellite and sends a giant wave of debris hurdling through space at break-neck speed. As a result of dumb luck, the debris destroys the Explorer and kills all crew aboard the ship, except for Dr. Stone and Lt. Kowalski. Kowalski estimates that they have about 90 minutes before the debris completes a full orbit and strikes them again. All communication with Mission Control in Houston has been lost.

The central story is a singular. It's here that director Alfonso Cuarn's (Children of Men) talent shines the most. Both of Gravity's central characters rely on each other to hop scotch between various man-made space structures, and get back to Earth in one piece. Due to the lack of communication with Mission Control and dwindling Oxygen supply, every successful move in Stone and Kowalski's game of chess is dependent on pin-point accuracy, with no room for error. When the pair get entangled in an escape capsule's already deployed parachute, Kowalski cuts himself loose to prevent Stone from drifting away with him into deep space. Now it's up to the rookie astronaut to figure how to board a distant Chinese Space Station and use an escape shuttle to return home.

The cinematography and Special FX are some of the most realistic I've ever seen in this context. The simplicity of Stone's losing battle with the lifeless atmosphere of space is both beautiful and terrifying. Like ""Children of Men,"" before it, Cuarn's distinct lack of monsters, aliens, or slasher movie villains lend Gravity a unique appeal in contrast to the majority of contemporary science fiction. Due to these qualities, Gravity nabbed 7 well-deserved Oscars at the 2013 awards ceremony, including Best Director, Best Cinematography, and Best Visual Effects. If you get the chance, watch it in 3D for the full experience.",1396137600,,2564,5.025882352941177

Ten years from now, members of the Academy will ask themselves - what the heck were we thinking?  Don't get me wrong.  12 Years A Slave is a good movie; however, it isn't nearly the game changer that Gravity is.  It's basically a classier, more accomplished version of Roots.  Speaking as an African-American, I wish the members of the Academy had chosen another way to assuage their white guilt.  Selecting 12 Years A Slave as Best Picture may have been the politically correct thing to do; but it rings hollow to me.  How can Gravity win Oscars as the best directed, best filmed, best edited, best scored, best CGI'd, best sound-edited, and best sound-mixed film yet not be worthy of the top prize.

Did she change? Well we the audience will never know. As far as the audience is concerned the Sandra Bullock character was standing on her feet before she got in space, only she was all butt-hurt about it.

Then came the moment I stopped enjoying the movie - when Clooney reappears in the space capsule towards the end. I actually would have rather that it had really been him with some fantastic story to tell. From this point on I really thought the film was schlock. Bullock is now intent on making it back. The capsule re-entry, for me, completely lacked any suspense. Gee, I wonder if she is going to drown at the bottom of the lake or river or wherever she landed??

Clooney phoned in his role while Bullock performed a wider range of emotion. However, I kept seeing her as more her character in ""Speed"". As for CGI special effects: they seemed gratuitous for the 4-14 year olds that might be in the theatre. They completely destroyed not only a space shuttle, but two space stations all for the purpose of having the action move from one peril to the another.

OK - visual affects are a nice achievement - That's it.
George Clooney's role was killed off too soon. He was the only decent part of the movie.  Ninety-percent of Sandra Bullock's moaning through out the entire movie consists of just one word...""uh,"" an in ""or woof woof!. On top of it she is the ugliest and worst actress there is!

Most of it is spent on Sandra Bullock muttering nonsense and instead of following and remembering the training lessons she went through before being shipped into the orbit, she becomes a nervous wreck. There was no logic behind any of her actions and decisions, even when she was able to stop thinking out loud, babbling nonsense and start doing things to try and save herself.

Her losing oxygen at an alarming rate as Clooney is engaging her in conversation.

Him being so cavalier about it and still with the dry humor. Yeah, I don't think so. Then him showing up while she's trying to go to sleep - but its a dream sequence.. that was just plain stupid. The fact that she could talk to a Russian man singing lullaby's but no way she could reach Nasa or any other high tech space station on earth who are obviously searching for her due to the blackout.. just too many dopey situations.  The made for TV lifetime random moment about her 4 year old daughter dying and how Clooney should say hi to her when he sees her and she found the red shoe...just plain drama on behalf of the writer/director.

It is hard to articulate exactly what is missing from the movie - after all, I didn't notice any glaring errors, and Geroge Clooney & Sandra Bullock did a fine job. This is supposed to be a drama/thriller, but I personally found the background sounds/music distractingly loud compared to the voice levels - in space will only travel through direct conduction, so I assume that they add the music so it isn't boring, but the volume was a bit too much for me.",1395964800,3,580,4.481132075471698

George Clooney almost becomes a cameo in the 10-12 minutes he's on screen.

Whether it's oxygen that never runs out (even when at 0%, with only ""in-suit"" oxygen remaining, prior to an *extended* action sequence with *prolonged* adrenaline-filled gasping/breathing)... The *true* physics of space (aka: gravity, momentum, etc. etc.); or any of the countless absurdities contained throughout.

Bullock's character, who is new to NASA (1st mission, after 6 months training, LOL)... Is inexplicably, intimately familiar with both the Russian & Chinese Space Stations, both externally and internally... As well as intimate knowledge of how to operate said Stations... And the miraculous ""luck"" of initiating the re-entry sequence, because even though all the buttons & prompts are in Mandarin (Chinese), they, (the Chinese) would of course engineer/design & build their Station/Modules/etc., in the same exact configuration (down to the exact same button-layouts) as its U.S. counterpart... so after 3 button-tries, she's saved, LOL.  WOW.

Ah yes, and let's not forget that it's boring as hell for the most part.

Best: ""Director""/""Picture""/""Actress"" -- THIS THING??, REALLY??! -- WTF?!
Admittedly, it's pretty to look at in a few places... It was technically challenging to pull off (somewhat believable space/anti-gravity), and so on...
But this shouldn't have been nominated for most of its awards, let alone, the winner of any in its categories.
I view each of its wins as the most insane ""participation trophies"" of all time.
-- With all seriousness, since when do (some) pretty visuals and (some) technically challenging film-making equate to ""Best"" of anything?

PS: Just because many think that Bullock was better than we've ever seen her, doesn't mean her performance was worthy of a ""Best Actress"" nod (which it wasn't); and I like her -- have liked her since ""Speed"" -- so this has nothing to do with a personal dislike for her as a person &/or actress.

The second issue was George Clooney.  He is a fine actor and did a great job in a supporting role.  The problem is that George Clooney in a space suit is the spitting image of Buzz Lightyear.

5874110,1,B00DY64A3U,"George Clooney (the infamous nippled Batman) coaches Sandra Bullock on crisis management in space. The appearance of a space shuttle is the first surprise, since the real shuttle program is scrapped, so one would expect to see American astronauts hitchhiking aboard a Soyuz. Regardless, for reasons not explained, and lacking expertise, Bullock crews a mysterious shuttle mission that involves screwing and unscrewing a metal plate. Typical of her mishaps throughout the film, she screws that up and needs help to stop bolts from tumbling away and becoming space junk. Suddenly, something goes wrong, people get killed, debris hurtles in every direction, Bullock panics and essentially spends the rest of the movie in a stupor, surviving only with cajoling from beyond the grave. The pacing is terrible: many times, the refrain at our gathering was ""GET ON WITH IT.""  Credibility is stretched: all space stations are within visual range, you reach them by pointing in a straight line, satellite orbits intersect like bullets in a crossfire. Adding to the wild west atmosphere, Bullock spends crucial moments chatting on ham radio with an inebriated Eskimo. We never learn the nature of the mysterious force that pulls Clooney away from Bullock selectively, and we never learn how Bullock operates Chinese instrument panels with razor precision, but maybe all instrument panels are the same, and maybe the universe wanted revenge on Clooney for those old Batman nipples.  Anyway, Bullock gets an opportunity to display her assets and acting talent, and that's really all that matters, right?  I mean, this is hardly a contender for the Oscars, right?",1395792000,4,1649,5.262357414448669
5874111,4,B00DY64A3U,"Gravity tells the story of a medical engineer (Bullock) and an astronaut (Clooney) who must work together to survive after a catastrophe destroys their shuttle and leaves them adrift in orbit.

One of my first thoughts after seeing this movie is that the concept (lost in the middle of the sea versus lost in the middle of space orbit) is a bit like the recently released Redford movie ""All is Lost"" (which I was disappointed with).  The difference being is that Gravity was done in the way that I wished ""All is Lost"" would have been done.

Gravity pulls no punches and quickly gives you everything right away by jumping into the action quickly.  The special effects are spectacular and the story kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time injecting both hope and despair throughout.  And unlike the Redford movie, gives me some character background that is enough to make me care about the character and also Bullock does a great job at detailing her actions throughout without being too much so.  Unlike All is Lost which chooses to use very little conversation or self interaction to tell the story (which I thought was its failing).

Although I am not a huge Bullock fan, she plays the role very well by displaying all aspects of the character in a way that is believable emotionally.

Although I watched at home instead of  IMAX 3D, my wife did and said that they were amazing on the big screen.  If the effects were that good on my TV, I could only imagine what they were like on the big screen.

Granted I will agree with some of the critics concerning the likeliness of the story happening and that doesn't bother me so much as I can suspend reality enough to enjoy the movie for what it is, which is a good science fiction thriller and worthy of 4 stars.",1395792000,,1767,4.490625

While Sandra Bullock's day is a lot busier than reality would dictate, the moviemakers have worked hard to place the drama into a plausible setting.  The drama is considerably more compelling when it's in a world we know.

Enough about science.  This movie is really a ride and it's a good one. The pace is relentless, with just a few short spots where you can catch your breath.  Sandra Bullock owns the role, and she's earned every accolade that's come her way.  My appreciation of her on-screen work was doubled when I watched the extensive making-of videos that come with the BluRay.  In most movies, the video extras aren't worth the bother.  With 'Gravity' the extras are really worth it.

The sound is worth a mention of its own.  The 5.1 mix on the BluRay is first-rate.  But if the movie ever does another round in the theaters, it's worth a drive to hear the Atmos mix.  I'm lucky to be in an area that has a large Atmos theater, and I made a point to see 'Gravity' in the big room.  I've never had a film experience that was so exhausting.  I had no adrenaline left.

If the planet below is supposed to be Earth, you cannot tell by the bad graphics. There only one shot that looks faintly like a fake northeast Africa.

George Clooney is ejected from the movie in defiance of the same physics that made for violent ricochets earlier on. This is the dumbest contrivance in the whole film.

Sandra Bullock got a good face job. As always, she can almost act. But with a script that forces her to go from a hysterical idiot to an amazingly canny technician to a mumbling sentimentalist, no actress could pull this off with credibility.

Review - 1/5
George Clooney and Sandra Bullock get lost in space for almost two hours. They talk, then they talk, they even talk some more. The most overrated film of the year no doubt. One of the worst films I have seen in quite some time. It was literally pointless. I don't believe anyone outside an amateur astronomer would find it entertaining. I should have known that going in. I don't believe Sandra Bullock has ever pulled off a decent performance. George Clooney is well, George in every film.

So, if you go into this expecting only to see one woman having a real bad day at work you will be immensely entertained by the fact that her day at work was possibly worse than yours, something you previously thought not possible.",1395705600,,501,4.1875

Except for all of the space effects - and worrying about whether Sandra was finally going to die in space - there was really no story - or rather that WAS the story for 90 + minutes!  When I think of the HUGE amount of money spent to make this film and how many wonderful and different stories  - maybe 3 smaller films -I just shake my head.

I mean the story line is............ First, let's wipe out the US Space Shuttle and kill everyone but the commander and some no tech skilled scientist (Ms. Sandy Bullock).  But, thank goodness the International Space Station is there to save them however, after she gets there, let's wipe out the International Space Station too.  Then, thank God the Chinese have abandoned their space station and it's close by, and finally, let's wipe that out too ................ Oh, btw, she has no flight training but manages to take control of the Chinese capsule, by reading the Pilot's manual in flight, and survives the descent to Earth.  Really?

Ultimately, let's have our heroine, after all this, land in the middle of a lake, almost sink and die (again) only to miraculously swim ashore and walk back to some civilization located down a dusty road, wherever that may be.  They should have had a band playing on the shore line to welcome her back.  At least, the music might be good.",1395705600,10,1169,4.696078431372549

5874262,3,B00DY64A3U,I expected more action and less of Sandra Bullock's breathing. I guess I'm tired of Sandra Bullock's acting ability. I wouldn't recommend this movie.,1395705600,,149,5.25

5874267,4,B00DY64A3U,My family & I enjoyed this movie. This kept me at the edge of my seat - the movie was as close to real as it gets. Makes it seem that this could happen in real life. Sandra Bullock was outstanding in her role as Dr. Stone.,1395705600,,222,3.74468085106383
5874268,2,B00DY64A3U,... but honestly pretty boring.  The story line was many unlikely catastrophes separated by even more unlikely escapes.  It never let up... until it mercifully ended.,1395705600,,166,5.346153846153846

I would have liked to have seen his character tested to the extreme. Sandra Bullock - yes, I know she's just a mission specialist and not a full-time astronaut - seems ill-equipped for the rigors and emergencies of space. Does NASA really let mission specialists fly out there, even if they nearly failed their training? Of course, no one knows how he or she will react under such extreme circumstances, but I'd like to think I'd hold up a bit more like Sigourney Weaver (in Aliens) than Sandra Bullock in Gravity.",1395705600,2,677,4.895652173913043

5874359,2,B00DY64A3U,"I am leery of movies with a lot of hype surrounding them but, since I really like Sandra Bullock in almost anything she does, I took a chance on Gravity.  The special effects and action sequences seemed very well done and Sandra's acting was quite adequate (though not beyond anything I've seen her do before in any of her damsel-in-distress roles such as Speed).  Still, the story was only mildly interesting and seemed contrived and unrealistic. Of course the scientist with only 6 months of training on various simulators is going to be placed in peril because that's how we set up conflict, right? Oh yes, and this tiny, slim, earth-based woman (while weightless in space and in a space suit, no less) is going to be able to perform great feats of strength. Overall, I didn't know enough about the character to be really invested in her plight (and frankly, what I did know made me sad for her but also wonder why she cared to fight for her life). The ending was somewhat anti-climactic as well.  I have to say, I'm not really sure why there were so many awards nominations for this movie, not to mention the Oscar for Best Director.  I don't know if it won anything for CGI but it might have deserved that at least.",1395705600,,1220,4.506787330316742

Nothing can top this...except possibly the companion short film Aningaaq, which shows the other side of the distress call made by Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock). If you've not seen the companion short film, search for it and watch it BEFORE you watch the movie.

This movie was 4 years in the making & required nonstop coming up with new technologies to accommodate the vision of the movie.  The story had many layers and involved symbolic images that made me think in new ways.  I couldn't imagine how a space movie could keep me interested, but this one was non-stop action & emotion & issues to solve.  Most amazing is that nearly every second of this movie appeared REAL...not science fiction, not futuristic, but what a space station & life in zero gravity would actually be.  I purchased this DVD after seeing all the awards won for it - I had to see what was so 'great' about.  And it is awe-inspiring great.  I understand why all the awards were won...what I DO NOT understand is why Sandra Bullock didn't leave with her own arms full of awards!  She WAS the movie.

I had high hopes that an action flick starring a female might depict her being heroic rather than pathetic but I should have saved my money and read a book instead. This movie is typical hollywood. Send a helpless lady to space and then let all manner of crazy things happen to her then have a strong man save her repeatedly while she makes whimpering noises....

Some from the latter camp complained that not much happened in this film, meaning it is just a space mission went wrong with 2 main characters.  That is exactly what is extraordinary about this film.  Clocked in 90 short minutes, it tells a simple story of 2 astronauts who tried to survive when everything went wrong during a space mission.  It is about human spirit, sacrifice, survival and those who managed to live and those who die.  The film is technically superb, unprecedented and well-deserved of the multi-Oscar awards, not to mention the Best Director Award.  Credit must be given to Sandra Bullock who gave a superb performance as the astronaut struggles to survive.

George Clooney was in the movie for a whole 10 minutes in the beginning, then it was Sandra Bullock by herself. Sure, she had to do a lot of things to get back to terra firma, but is lacked reality. What she did was impossible, made for a good movie I guess is what they thought. You can't get to a higher orbit without a large rocket engine to accelerate your speed.

When the plot came around to the asteroids heading for the ship, or maybe the  Russians were causing the space debris, it went down hill fast.

It started with the woman doctor who wouldn't obey orders to return to the ship because she wanted to finish her experiment, endangering the whole crew. Then she puts them into even more danger because she plays the silly little girl role of acting helpless with her I can't do bit, Killing off  the captain who risks his life trying to save her.  The rest of the movie is nothing but her crying over her dead daughter and poor me act.  WHEN it got boring fling some more space debris at the ship with loud crashes and booms.

The negative aspects are so noticeable and pervasive, that they are impossible to ignore, and bring the whole movie down: Bullock is essentially hyperventilating during the WHOLE MOVIE. It is hard to over-state how irritating this is, and it is a good enough reason not to see this movie in and of itself. Bullock is so inept at everything she does, that I wanted to shoot her by the end of the movie. Secondly, there are elements of the plot that are so unbelievable, that it makes me feel like a child...I realize this is sci fi, but still...

I'm still trying to figure out the why of it. Clooney plays the hero astronaut who sacrifices himself for the good of others. Not exactly a challenging dramatic role. Sandra Bulloch plays a scientist who is clueless in an outer space environment. In the opening scene alone there were so many unrealistic discrepancies that anyone with a even modicum of knowledge about a gravity free environment would be staring in dumb founded incredulity. Untethered tools and parts????? Give me a break. Obviously the producer/director thought we needed to be told that things which are not tied down in space tend to float away.

What follows is no better. While the actual incident which results in the basis for the plot is impressive and certainly plausible, Bulloch surviving close call after close call is laughable. Her acting is fine and believable in the role. On the plus side, for you guys, she is in her skivvies more often than not. She's not my type personally. The only thing worth an extra star in my opinion would have been if Clooney had been in his, but this film was so lame even that would be a stretch.

Two stars is for the special effects. They were indeed impressive and, by themselves, certainly rated 4-5 stars but the rest of the baggage from this flick ruined it. Glad I rented it and didn't pay full price in a theatre.",1395360000,,1480,4.581132075471698

5874563,5,B00DY64A3U,"I have never done a review of a film quite like ""Gravity."" It would be hard to place it into any one recognized film genre. This is a story of survival that may be similar to those you have heard of, such as Aron Ralston's story in the film ""127 Hours."" But this is placed way above our own familiar environment, in a setting usually reserved for aliens and futuristic galaxy travel: the vast emptiness of space. Words cannot fully justify the extent of this experience, though I will try my best. But this is really something you have to see for yourself.

Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a medical engineer, currently on her first mission in space aboard the space shuttle Explorer. Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), a longtime astronaut, is her commander. While attempting to fix a telescope, they are suddenly warned by Houston of an impending crisis: a Russian satellite was blown up, and its debris has spread into other surrounding satellites, all of which is now heading in their direction. No sooner do we hear their warning when, like a speeding bullet, the crew and ship is suddenly torn into by an intense hurricane of smashing satellite-parts, from which only Stone and Kowalski emerge unscathed. And, to make matters worse, the satellite connecting the astronauts to Earth has also been destroyed, leaving them alone in the dark. Think of ""Apollo 13,"" but with no Houston to guide them home.

As the film's opening lines state: in space, there is no sound, no light, and no gravity. If separated from your spacecraft, as Stone soon is, you will continue to drift endlessly, unless something manages to stop you. So, after being knocked out of reach from the ship, Stone continues to spin out of control. And director Alfonso Cuarn, with no regard for nausea-induced audience members, takes us right along with her. On one side, we see nothing but desperately empty blackness; on the other, an illumination of the bright orb of our own blue planet, which is now drifting farther and farther away.

Throughout the length of ""Gravity,"" there is really no single moment (maybe one) that the camera remains stationary. We either drift along with our two principle cast members, see POV shots through their space helmets, or travel in circling arcs, perceiving them as tiny dots in the distance. In Cuarn's last project ""Children of Men,"" there is a long tracking shot towards the end of the film, in which we see the characters wander through a hectic war-zone. In ""Gravity,"" the extended camera shots are used to similar effect, though, as mentioned, the atmosphere is soundless here. So, as the giant arm of a satellite swings around and smashes into the side of a space shuttle, there are no explosive bangs or crashes. The intensity of these moments comes only through the reactions from Kowalski or Stone: heavy breathing, upset voices, or the labored screams of a person desperately fighting for their life. And, at all times, it is intensified by the electronic spirals of Steven Price's form-fitting musical score.

Not since ""Life of Pi"" or ""Avatar"" has digital technology so seamlessly fit a movie. Yet unlike these two previous films, the CGI in ""Gravity"" is not meant to create an alien or dream-like effect. Instead, it serves to create as realistic a world as possible. A tiny droplet of water seeps from Stone's eye, and sails gently out in front of her. A pen floats gracefully around her head, as pieces of satellites soar through the air outside the space module, reflecting on the glinting sun, which has just started to peak its face from around the corner. As harrowing as much of this movie is, this is also, at times, a poetic experience.

""Gravity"" is, essentially, an allegory of the many cycles of human life. There is birth, struggle, companionship, loss, and, through it all, the will to survive. At one moment, Stone is shown floating in a fetal position when first coming inside a space module, her arms wrapped around her legs, as if still inside the mother's womb. This one shot shows Stone's renewed strength of survival after the start of her ordeal. She will soon emerge from this experience, reborn and ready to fight for her life rather than lay down and accept this as the end. It is the influence of Kowalski's calm confidence at the start that finally convinces Stone that she must survive, and that she must take control, despite her losses in her life back on Earth. With the exception of the first twenty minutes with Clooney, this really is a one-man (woman) show, and Bullock manages to carry the full weight of ""Gravity."" This is the type of performance that deserves Academy recognition, which would make it the second nomination for Bullock in only the last couple of years.

At once a virtual roller-coaster simulator ride, ""Gravity"" is also the most visually splendid film of 2013. And it's unlikely that another film will come close. It is a dizzying, entertaining, terrifying adventure.",1395360000,,4948,4.822143698468786

5874586,2,B00DY64A3U,"Alfonso Cuaron, the director of the movie, Gravity, gets credit for capturing the beauty of the earth as seen from outer space, but I think we gave too much credit to Cuaron and not enough to our creator of this earth.  As an artist, can I paint a picture of a star and take credit for its beauty?  I have seen NASAs orbital pictures of the earth and they are ten times more beautiful than anything Alfonso Cuaron created on the screen.  He did a good job of imitation, but the real thing is always better.

Most of the movie critics seem to love the movie, ""Gravity,"" or maybe they said it should win for best picture because they were afraid to criticize it.  I simply do not get it.  The special effects were fantastic!  Yes, I agree, butthe plot was so simple it failed to hold my attention for any length of time.  I kept waiting, and waiting for a subplot...throw me a George Clooney bone, anything.  Sandra Bullock (one of my favorite actors) had very little to do, or say in the film and kept whining, and whining throughout most of the movie.  I guess I just wanted her to be more ""professional,"" or tough like the Sigourney Weaver's character in ""Aliens.""  In 2014, most movie directors show women tough and capable of dealing with any adversity.  Perhaps Latin director, Cuaron, does not think women are liberated enough to be responsible for their own safety.

As most, I too was disappointed in the lack of reality in the movie.  I am no astrophysics major, but I have learned that one does not float from one orbital level to another orbital level so easily.  If that were possible, our high orbiting satellites would drift away into outer space towards the moon.  Even if they couldall objects orbiting around the earth are traveling at a fixed rate of speed around the earth and therefore the ""space junk"" would not be able to catch up with Sandra Bullock every few hoursas if she were standing still on earth waiting for it to hit her.

Towards the end of this pitifully short film, I was so disappointed to see George Clooney, the only responsible character in the movie, drift off into oblivion.  I kept hoping the camera would follow him.  At least his rescue could have been a subplot.  Oh, well...maybe in the sequel they will go looking for him and call it ""Gravity 2, In Search of George.""",1395360000,,2313,4.5011990407673865

There are plenty of twists and turns to keep the viewer off balance, but I was most impressed by the special effects required to make existence in a zero gravity environment plausible. In fact, were it not for a few details (hair seemed gravity-bound), one could easily suspect that the production company had managed to hitch a ride on a shuttle before the fleet was decommissioned. Tethering straps, for example, waved around with no apparent effect from a gravitational field, and the astronaut ""swam"" effortlessly through the space station in locations that one would assume prevented the use of wires or other obvious supports.

The entire movie took place in outer space and the special effects really had you ""reaching out"" as space items hurled toward you.  As for the story line, I believe adults would enjoy this movie more than kids or even teens.  It centered around an aborted mission,  the complications that Sandra Bullock's character experienced to reach a space station and eventually return to earth.  George Clooney had a very small part in this movie.

5874676,4,B00DY64A3U,"My daughter and I saw this movie in IMAX.  Everything you've heard is true - like James Cameron said, it's the greatest space movie ever made (as far as realism). No monsters or energy weapons, no evil interstellar empires, no spacecraft making roaring noises as they fly by, or maneuvering like dogfighting F16's - just a really bad day for current-tech astronauts. When Sandra Bullock uses a cordless driver to loosen bolts while spacewalking, what we hear is what she would hear in her spacesuit ; the muffled whine of the motor and muffled thumps of engaging the bolt heads, all conducted through her arm and suit. And a lot of breathing. When pieces of space debris impact the Shuttle and the ISS, there is no noise, but the story urgency is maintained by the radio chatter, the musical score and the spectacular and detailed explosions of pieces and assemblies flying and tumbling in all directions, in straight lines. All this set against a cloud-covered Earth. When I could spare a second from the action, I remember noticing both Italy and the Sinai Peninsula. I'm sure others saw more.

George Clooney plays the experienced spaceman, who is a master of keeping the work schedule moving with a light and friendly mood, mostly through non-stop stories from his colorful life. One minute they're eye-rolling groaners, the next they're a welcome, calm and distracting anchor for sanity in the void. Sandra Bullock is the rookie astronaut with a medical degree who is nevertheless being put to work checking out Hubble's circuit boards. She's competent and capable, but it takes all she's got to work on the Hubble while perched at the end of the Canadarm.

Sandra and George are the only on-camera actors in this 1 1/2hr movie. Ed Harris plays the voice of the CAPCOM in Houston.. (If anything ever happens to Tom Hanks, I think Ed Harris would have to take up a lot of the slack).

The space debris becomes a problem when the Russians fire a missile to destroy one of their own satellites (""Probably a spy sat"", says George). The destruction becomes a cascading domino effect that quickly engulfs dozens of other satellites, and the whole mess turns into a cloud of hypervelocity space junk orbiting at the same height as the Shuttle repair mission on the Hubble. This debris cloud takes a couple minutes to whiz by, or impact on something, and then you have 90 minutes before it orbits the Earth and catches up with you again. Nice !

The movie gives you a real sense of what's waiting just beyond NASA's experience, research, protocols and contingency plans. When one area of tech causes problems for another area (human-caused space debris becoming a deadly threat to humans in orbit) we're back to gut-level reactions, self-control and creative improvisation, particularly since we lose Ed Harris's, and therefore Ground Control's, presence early in the catastrophe.

As a scifi freak, I noticed some fishy things about this otherwise very physics-realistic movie, such as how the Hubble, the ISS and the Chinese space station all seemed to be in the same neighborhood, flying in a loose formation up there. Not so. In reality the orbits are at different heights, therefore traveling at different speeds, and also at different inclinations relative to each other. The overall sequence of events in the movie is  impossible, as far as movement between assets by free-floating astronauts. You can't be replacing batteries in the Hubble, and an hour later cruise over to the ISS with nothing but a spacesuit jet-pack.  Also, a couple little things, like Sandra Bullock's space helmet floating around in the cabin of a Soyuz that is currently decelerating, rather than jammed against the dashboard. For it to float, both it and the Soyuz have to be flying at the same speed.

I also have to believe that seeing this movie in 3D is the way to go. Several scenes made you feel like you're crawling on the outside of the ISS right with the astronauts. There's the rounded hump of a cylindrical section, covered with sun shield material, between you and them; you're waiting your turn to go in the airlock, and all you hear is voices and breathing on the radio, while huge chunks of debris fly by, momentarily blocking the sun and making you wince and blink. And when Sandra goes tumbling out of control, far away from anyone or anything else, for a moment you feel what it would be like to be that helpless, with a dwindling oxygen supply, only static on the radio, and with Earth and Heaven chasing each other in a circle across your field of vision.

But I am just another person willing to suspend disbelief for the sake of the experience, and this movie gets so much right, or at least what looks right (I haven't made it up to Low Earth Orbit, myself, yet) that I still came out of it having learned something. Just like being in any other wilderness, drifting free in Earth orbit can either be stunningly beautiful or a black terror. It's up to you to make that choice.",1395187200,3,4979,4.758980301274623

5874690,3,B00DY64A3U,"The backdrop for this story is near-earth orbit and it's breathtaking. It may be technically inaccurate in places, but for me, an average Joe who worked in commercial aircraft engineering, it's close enough.
The story, however, is hokey. Our heroine has a doctorate but is in a funk about the death of her daughter, just about gives in to the circumstances surrounding her which would terminate her life, but then has an epiphany and turns into superwoman. I think if the story were done with a lot more subtlety it would fly, but as it is there's too much to swallow for it to ring true.

While I don't think it says this, it must be set sometime in the future because some of what happens seems dependent on technology that I don't think has reached the level shown in the film. Accepting that, this picture has adventure, resourcefulness, and, yes, a close relationship between the main characters. As I recall, it won an Oscar for special effects. If so, it was very well deserved. Setting aside the noise level that wouldn't be present in space this was a convincing, hair-raising, endlessly challenging adventure.

5874698,1,B00DY64A3U,"I was astounded that this movie received the critical acclaim that it did. Everything about it was sappily overdone, including but not limited to, the acting, screenplay, art direction, story line, and musical score. Excessive use of CGI that had the opposite effect it intended (similar to the movie ""2012""). Instead of adding to the realism of the situation the viewer was constantly reminded that they were watching a Hollywood movie. The director needed to watch Apollo 13 about one hundred times first and get schooled by Ron Howard re how to make a well crafted and suspenseful astronaut movie.
  Although I realize that giving a filmmaker artistic license is important, there are far too many scenes that prompt the viewer to say, ""I don't think that reflects what would really happen in that situation"". An example would be the tsunami of space debris that periodically gets released which destroys everything in its path except Sandra Bullock. Another is her uncanny ability to quickly master the complexities of aeronautics and adeptly man the controls of several different spacecraft just using a handy dandy guidebook. She is a mission specialist not a pilot ! The final scene is the best example of this reality stretching. <SPOILER ALERT> While I agree that it is likely that she would land in water since the planet is mostly covered with it, what are the chances that it would be a shallow, placid, picturesque fresh water lagoon inhabited by cute little frogs? I mean really, where is the drama in that? Perhaps this is why the director overcompensates and tries to artificially contrive the drama at this crucial part of the story with the most sickeningly saccharine part of the score in the whole movie.

5874715,3,B00DY64A3U,"The visual effects in this flick are mind blowing.  They do an awesome job of making you feel like you're there... even more clearly than if you were actually there (if that's possible).  There are some scenes that are absolutely captivating.

That said... I was quite disappointed in this movie.  Apparently, I was subcouciously making a face of bizarre disappointment so much so that my wife interupted the middle of the movie and said ""OMG, you should see your face, lol"".

Anyway, I realize having just watched this in March of 2014 I am way behind all the buzz and hype, but I still had high hopes.  I'm a huge space fan, and while I heard reviews that said the physics just don't add up, I figured that was just snotty scientists picking it apart.  Um... it wasn't.  Several of the scenes were so blatently inaccurate that even my 4 year old son would ask... 'Why is he falling in space'?  ""uh, I don't know son... this isn't normal space apparently"".  There were just several scenes that were too silly (physics aside) that may have been entertaining in the theater with a group, but at home... just didn't fit at all.

In another strange take of the movie, several parts of it seemed rushed... almost like you didn't get a chance to capture the, uh... 'gravity' of the situation.

Sandra was solid... Clooney, seems to have no business being in this film.  There was a bit too much joking around, and I think this flick would have been awesome with a bit more seriousness to it (Tom Hanks?).

But seriously... The effects are mind blowing.  So if you don't mind the laws of nature and reality, or your good at kinda ignoring those things, this movie is awesome.  And even if you can't get over it.. it's still entertaining.  Just be mindful of the silly faces you could make during it.  :)",1395187200,10,1797,4.527950310559007

In my view this is almost a documentary about the human fragility on space. Finally a space movie without without explosions (sound can't travel in the vacuum of space). The most realistic space movie to date.
The views over our Earth-home are breathtaking!
It must be seen in the biggest screen possible with 3D.  Mandatory.
The panning scenes were created to take advantage of the 3D technology and a big screen.

It is hard to explain but it almost had too much suspense...over the top suspense if you will.  It made me feel anxious the whole time instead of enjoying the storyline.  And for all I know, the constant anxious feeling could have been what the director was going for.  But for me, that was a detractor for the movie.

Sandra Bullock was spectacular as critics have claimed and the visual effects were spectacular as well.  This movie was really all about her solo acting effort and the anxious feeling created by the director throughout the whole movie.  If you really like both of those things, then you will, in turn, really like the movie. If either one turns you off a bit, then you will feel more like me about it.  It's good but not great.

Overall, I give the movie 3.5 stars out of 5 but I rounded up to 4 because Sandra deserves the round up.  She really did knock it out of the park on this effort.",1395100800,2,1008,4.257894736842105

Here is the the whole movie:
For the first 15 minutes George Clooney zooms around in a space suit making pithy comments and being adorable as only Clooney can do. Then things blow up (very spectacular), then Sandra Bullock whippers, hyperventilates and sobs for an hour, then in a completely impossible series of twists she gets to earth alive.
That's it, the whole story.
The are two positive aspects to the movie.
  1) Some really spectacular space shots. Very beautiful.
  2) There are several shots that show that Ms. Bullock still have amazing legs.

5874845,2,B00DY64A3U,"OK, so visually this movie has some amazing scenes, but overall Gravity is terribly boring.  The characters are not well established from beginning to end -- so you honestly don't care whether they live or die.  Also, I think they put George Clooney in this movie because you're so familiar with his character and he's instantly likeable (because the other characters are so underdeveloped).  Unfortunately he's in the movie about 20 mins -- and that's it.  The story is very thin and repetitive.  Sandra Bullock does an OK job in this movie, but there's not much to the ""acting"".

True, the shots that were closer up did have an impact as did the fragments of the expoding space satellites and space stations popping into my face made me jump like nothing has lately, just really showed what could and could not be done with the 3D medium.  I got pulled into ""The Great Gatsby"" more than any other 3D film, and was expecting a lot more from this one.  The story was good in ""Gravity"" and the acting was fine, however, I was more taken with ""American Hustle"" (not a 3D film) with Amy Adams performance a standout as was her wardrobe and the chances she took with her cleavage.  This beautiful, usually demure, actress was more of an eye popper than all of ""Gravity"".

2) Movies are made by movie makers, not astro-physicists. So inevitably- They. Will. Make. Mistakes.

And when those mistakes are made, then Neil Tyson and others will come out to crow about it and I will get to learn things that I might have never paid attention to before. Like Nasa's space depris website, or orbit altitudes of stations and satellites.

5875016,5,B00DY64A3U,"""Gravity"" has been accused by some experts at playing loose with scientific possibilities but that smacks of nitpicking since it's such an unforgettable piece of great entertainment (especially in 3-D) that will leave you breathless.  In fact it's a tour-de-force for Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron who proved with his 2006 masterpiece ""Children of Men"" that there are few directors alive who are on his level with commanding and moving the camera in intense action sequences.

Virtually the entire film takes place in earth's orbital space, and it involves only two characters, an experienced astronaut (George Clooney) and a medical engineer (Sandra Bullock) on her first shuttle mission.  To say they get into trouble is the understatement of the year.  You might think I'm stretching things a bit, but after the final fadeout it leaves no doubt to me that the film is really about something beyond its simple plot.  I'm trying not to provide any spoilers, but I'll just say that I find the film actually becomes a socio-political metaphor for the progress of women from the fifties to the present as she fights for her life. This explains some of its sexist dialogue as well as its 'coda'.

The film deservedly won seven Oscars including one for director Cuaron, but it also won an Oscar for cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki.  Lubezki had to photograph actors, sometimes spinning on wires, in 'light boxes' on an empty stage surrounded by LED lights mimicking both direct sunlight and reflected light from Earth.  It might be that the camera work on ""Gravity"" was way outside the mainstream of convention, but the effects of Lubezki working with Cuaron were dazzling.

The plot was relatively realistic, in view of the space stations in orbit, and it brought to light the fact that we are definitely putting a lot of trash (equipment debris) on our outer atmosphere as well as down here on planet Earth.

Bullock's performance was good - not sure she carried off the scientist part that well - though any scientist finding herself/himself on a real-live situation like that one would probably not make it at all. Still, how can one not like Bullock?

The special effects were quite stunning - these ""creators"" keep getting better and better at their computerized craft.",1394928000,,746,4.8125

Okay, so it's got Sandra Bullock and George Clooney headlining. But at only 1:31min gravity feels more like an independent film than an epic hollywood blockbuster. It leaves you wondering what happened to the rest of the film? The storyline attempts to tug at your heart strings by repeatedly referring to Sandra's daughter who supposedly dies in a simple playground accident and Sandra's inability to move past the tragedy. But instead it comes off as very contrived and tries way too hard to make you cry with sappy descriptions of how Sandra's OCD driving around in her car is the sum total of her over the top tragic life..

George Clooney's character is the wisecracking comic relief to Sandra's constant buzzkill introspection. His constant playing of twangy country music through his spacesuit to annoy everyone in space and anecdotal tales of comical mishaps in his life help to keep the plotline from totally stalling out. But in the end, he floats off into space and leaves us inexorably stuck in a small space capsule with Sandra's monotone monologue and not so convincing attempts to look depressing. After another 30 minutes of listening to her depressing discourse, I was truly hoping she would burn up during re-entry just to put her out of her misery. But in the in end Sandra not so miraculously lands safe and sound on planet earth without a scratch on a nice stretch of tropical beach and she strolls off into the fade out and credits.

The movie does spend an inordinate amount of time showing epic CGI driven explosions and destruction as space debris caused by a very hokey explanation in the film repeatedly pummel Sandra and George. But in the end special effects just aren't enough to carry a film on their own and they certainly don't warrant an Academy Award Nomination.",1394928000,,2044,4.801136363636363

The flight experienced a fair amount of turbulence and without question the soundtrack itself is a palpable ""extra"" in the film. I found myself gasping at times.

I rarely gasp,  and connect recollect a flick that has made me done so in recent memory.

The cinematography and direction in the movie are positively genious.

Clooney is Clooney- and if you are a Clooney fan you may be a bigger one when it is over.

There's even a critical plot juncture that can only occur by ignoring the ever-so-slight following of physics/reality other parts do follow.

Would think only someone (had said young'un) that hasn't seen the science fiction greats of the last few decades could call this good.  C'mon, replace the 2 name actors w/lesser-known ones (who could easily perform the parts as well) and most would not have heard of or seen this movie.

Months ago, when I watched this film on a big 3-D movie screen, I was mesmerized by the first 10 minutes or so. The audience floats and twirls in outer space amongst the characters and the space gear. I was a child again sitting on the balcony at my local Bijou completely entranced by... magic.

Then The Accident takes place. And it's downhill from then on as this glorious opening sequence quickly makes way for... ""The Perils Of Pauline In Outer Space.""

Stultyfyingly repetitive, Bullock's whining finally wore me out. I started wishing Alien would show up and take care of her. As for Clooney, an actor I respect, he is soon reduced to nothing more than a soothing baritone and a patronizing bore. When the ""scientist"" finally splashes in the ocean, I fully expected Jaws to make an appearance, but I suppose they're saving that for the inevitable sequel..

Also, the odds of stuff like that happening is like the odds of shooting a gun at 100 yards and hitting a piece of paper on the flat edge.

5875236,2,B00DY64A3U,"This movie was a joke.  If you know anything about science and space, this movie would have insulted your intelligence.  The acting was two dimensional (nothing new out of Sandra Bullock and George Clooney) and the the story, although likely someday, was shallow and poorly presented.  It seemed to have been all about getting Sandra Bullock into her undies.

For example, when they thrust themselves to the ISS and Sandra Bullock got tangled in the cords from a parachute, Clooney appeared to be hanging on, like hanging from a cliff.  So, he let go to save Sandra Bullock.  What a joke.  In space, once the momentum was lost, he would have been floating, not hanging, about to drag them both off a cliff.  The movie was filled with these absurdities.

I guess the producer must think the audience is ignorant.  Well....based on the Academy Awards, maybe he's right.  The only reason I don't give the movie 1 star is because I liked Sandra Bullock's short hair....and she did look good in her undies : )",1394755200,3,1004,4.68

5875238,5,B00DY64A3U,"Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a brilliant medical engineer on a mission with seasoned veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney). Ryan is installing new scientific equipment to the space station when the team gets an order from Houston (Ed Harris) to immediately evacuate the mission and board the space station. It seems that Russia blew up one of its own satellites in orbit, causing thousands of large metal debris to start spinning into descent towards earth. However, the debris will pass by the astronauts every 90 minutes, a space storm of metal shrapnel coming at them thousands of miles per hour, adding to the tension of an already horrific situation they face.

Kowalski, a self-assured, and humorous vet of many hours of space time, instantly orders Stone to stop what she's doing and enter the space lab for protection. Stone, intent on finishing her mission, delays a minute too long, and the debris starts shooting by, tearing up everything in its path.  The space station is smashed and Stone and Kowalski are knocked loose of the craft and their only form of stability.

Suddenly Stone finds herself drifting away from the safety of the space station, spinning, spinning, in nothingness. Kowalski keeps talking to her--calming her down, and keeping her talking so he can locate her. Finally she slows down enough that she's able to flash her flashlight and Kowalski sees her, using his thrust jet pack to maneuver over to her, then tethering together so they can go off to search for a safe craft to take them back to earth.

Thus begins the long journey of Dr. Stone. Yes, this is about a strong character stuck in space where the odds are against her, but it's much more. It's about the strength of spirit and the sheer terror one can face when facing the unknown. The story reveals pieces of her life that affect her to this fateful day, and it shares her pains and memories. There is much more behind the story and some pretty strong symbolism of the underlying message of this film if you watch carefully.

As always, Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are at their best--seasoned professionals, and their personalities click together on the screen. Ed Harris is the voice of Houston, calming, concerned, and trying to help when possible.

The photography and CGI are so realistic I found it hard to believe that I wasn't watching an actual space walk. I'm not one for CGI, I think the majority of it looks like a video game, but the producers and software engineers behind this one worked magic to my eyes. They made everything look so real, the Earth so large, and the expansions of distance so long. My wife and I saw this first on the big screen, then on our own home set. Even on a smaller 42"" screen it was exciting.

If you rent the DVD, take the effort to watch the included extras, they are, combined, about an hour long, and there is much explanation on how the story came to be, how it was created, and even a featurette about Aningaaq, an Inuit in Greenland that talked to Dr. Stone while she floated through space in a capsule.

Sandra Bullock is one of my favorite actresses and her acting met all my expectations HOWEVER the movie itself was a complete waste of time. If you're into people floating around and having problem after problem then have at it...just wish I had spent my time and money on something else like having a tooth pulled w/o Novocaine :o(,1394755200,,389,4.416666666666667
5875256,3,B00DY64A3U,Technically the movie indisputably does a good job of recreating a fantastic environment. That's all folks. Maybe on a big screen ( I watched on my laptop) it would be more gripping. As it is I found it unbelievable.,1394755200,,216,4.564102564102564

5875258,3,B00DY64A3U,Very generic in plot and execution. Surprising with two superstars like this. Always like to see Sandra and George but not so much this time.,1394755200,,141,4.68
5875269,4,B00DY64A3U,Probably better to see at theater. Seemed very realistic in terms of science. Not so much in terms of story line.  Emotional connection was a bit wanting.,1394755200,,154,4.703703703703703
5875270,5,B00DY64A3U,Best movie of it's kind since Stanley Kubrick's 2001 - A Space Odyssey - there is an authenticity to being in space that is rarely achieved in most movies. A gripping story and a heroic role for Sandra Bullock. Recommended.,1394755200,,223,4.6

5875272,3,B00DY64A3U,"I realize that watching this movie on my 17-inch-screen laptop took away from the overall technical effects. There's still plenty of adventure. There is pretty much nothing but action with a little bit of dialogue thrown in for good measure. If there are going to be relatively few spoken lines, then those lines need to be better than they are in this movie. My attention bumped along, tethered to the screen. I got bored. I got entertained. And so on. Too bad they wasted money by casting big-name stars when any competent actors could have handled these parts.",1394755200,,563,4.755102040816326

5875296,5,B00DY64A3U,"After watching, I understand why it won so many awards.  Beautifully shot movie with an amazing actress. The special effects were mind blowing.  There was never a moment that dragged, the action remained steady even when the plot seemed unreasonable.",1394668800,,250,5.225
5875297,3,B00DY64A3U,"While visually this movie is stunning there is little else to it. The Honest Trailer (YouTube) review pretty much says it all.

The characters are little developed and seemingly completely ill-equipped and ill-suited to be astronauts. Not much more than a sci-fi skin on a poorly done Lifetime movie.

I saw it in IMAX, and it was probably worth the ride for that alone, but I cannot get my head around how other's are touting this movie so highly.",1394668800,38,448,4.658227848101266
5875298,2,B00DY64A3U,"I had high expectations for this highly praised ""Best Picture"" nominee. However, I was disappointed in some very basic areas.

1) The story and script lacked realism. When you do a movie and spent a lot of money creating realistic looking zero gravity effects, you should also apply that same template to the dialogue and different aspects of how astronauts might react in the circumstances portrayed in the movie. I grew up watching and following many space missions, and I have ingrained in my head how astronauts talk. What we saw in this movie was very Hollywood. What we saw in Ron Howard's Apollo 13 movie, was vastly more realistic. I think it would have been possible to create a compelling drama and yet preserve the framework of how astronauts behave under unusual circumstances.

2) Gravity effects were more along the lines of fantasy than science. So many of the scenes were aimed that producing a kind of acrobatic circus rather than being realistic.

3) Glaring contradictions. At the very beginning of the movie, there is the statement that is no sound. Yet in many scenes, there is sound made by things happening in space. I can understand the parts where the astronauts are working with tools etc. and how vibration can be transferred from the surface of one's helmet into the atmosphere of a space suit. But when I saw rocket boosters producing a sound, I couldn't wait for the movie to end. Some of the best scenes in 2001: A Space Odyssey, to advantage of the soundlessness of space and the result was powerful.

This is 2014, not 1968 (date 2001 was released). Surely, we can do better than this.

I could go on, but you catch my drift.",1394668800,6,1658,4.683848797250859
5875299,2,B00DY64A3U,I just finished watching this movie and am extremely disappointed.  It definitely was NOT an Oscar nominee movie in my opinion.  I think casting was a huge disaster.  Sandra Bullock was fantastic.  George Clooney was a joke in this movie.  Definitely not his type of flick.  The movie was interesting but choppy in places.  I think if more thought and expertise was put into the the whole project they could have had a great movie.  The end... absolutely horrible.  I just sat there saying to myself... that's it?  That's how it ends??  The hype about this movie made me think it was going to be something really special.  NO way.  Definitely not a movie I would recommend unless someone has it already and you want to borrow it just to watch it but not worth spending the money to purchase it.  This is not a movie I would watch again.,1394668800,,836,4.486666666666666

The ticket price buys you over an hour of super special effects of weightless in space; although, there is an occasional lapse in the laws of physics.  An example is a slow burning fire in an abandoned space station in what is presumably an oxygen rich environment.  If George had to be released from a restraining strap for velocity and mass, why not Sandra?  On the subject of mass, Sandra provides eye treats to the viewer with her usual superb carriage and chassis....when out of her space suit.

The background music won the academy award and I hardly noticed it which is exactly how it should be. So why did I like it more? The physics were all screwed up. There was hardly a thing about orbits, orbiting maneuvering and rockets that was factual. I love to get into movie and suspend belief but this one was just too out of reality for me to stay with the story. What makes it worse is that there is no reason that the story could have adjusted to better physics.

Sandra Bullock does a good job of creating the fear and reality of being alone in space.  I missed not seeing more of George Clooney as he is one of my favorite actors.  The ending did not give me a sense that her adventure was actually over.  The environment on earth where she landed did not seem to be much more hospitable than outer space.

It would have been more believable if Sandra Bullock's character would've died a hero on impact.

The performances were dull - i expected more from Clooney at least.  It was like they were reading the script for the very first time.  I have no idea why Sandra bullock was nominated for this film.  At least it was only 91 minutes long?  Maybe i should give it another star for not putting me through another 30 minutes of misery?,1394582400,2,480,4.337078651685394

5875453,1,B00DY64A3U,Gravity is one long and boring trip. George Clooney's character tries to interject humor but it is uncomfortable. I found the movie to be stupid and a waste of time and money.

There was practically no development of Kowalski's character and darn little of Stone's.  Now I know why Sandra Bullock didn't get the Oscar. Half of her dialogue was ""Ahh"" and ""Ohhh"" as she bounced through space. I'd love to see a re-cut version of this film with 50% of the special effects replaced by what were probably amazing scenes between our characters that got left on the editing floor.",1394582400,2,534,4.680851063829787
5875458,1,B00DY64A3U,"Really?? If NASA backed this vain attempt at reality (and it seems that they had some input with the space suits and ISS interior design) than I'm more disappointed in them than I am in the directors of this farce. Come on...anyone familiar with the Shuttle program knows that the Hubble Telescope and the ISS DO NOT fly in the same orbital plane and even if they did, they certainly wouldn't be only 100 miles apart. And if there WERE a Chinese Space Station, the same goes for it.

Do we really think NASA would not only hire but send an astronaut like Sandra Bullock (I can't remember her name in the movie) on a mission like this? Her character is constantly frightened, has no idea where to go when the repair was aborted and apparently failed to fly the ISS/Soyuz escape pod simulator. These EVA's are so choreographed and so trained on that the actual event becomes almost second nature. There's just no way Bullock's character would be this shaky. Further, it's amazing how she seems to get into and out of the complex NASA EVA spacesuits with aplomb...a procedure that typically takes one or two others to administer for up to two hours. And, oh yes, although certainly nice to witness, the astronauts who left the Shuttle to perform EVAs didn't do so with extreme short-shorts underneath...they wore thermal undergarments but, I do admit, most if not all didn't look as good as Bullock does in this minimum attire.

Do we really think that a Shuttle Commander (Clooney) would be allowed to fly around unabated with his jet pack, wasting fuel all the while engaged in useless chatter with Houston?

And the worst...Bullock somehow undocks the Chinese escape spacecraft from the Station, targets re-entry and as the remainder of the craft is burning up, disengages the capsule in perfect re-entry attitude and deploys the drogue shutes all while attempting to read the craft's directions in Chinese! Again I have to say...really???

Like the rest of the reviewers, I was generally pleased with the special effects but quickly lost hope for this dirge and hung in there only because I didn't want to waste my PPV money. If you know anything about manned spaceflight, stay away from this.",1394582400,2,2194,4.781002638522428

Real star was the special effects, including, for the most part, realistic portrayal of life in zero gravity / space environment.

This seemed almost an attempt of a castaway type performance with an actress with far less talent than tom hanks and a director that seemed to be doing everything he could to make the movie as short as possible.

It was certainly something to look at and the action moments are terrifying.  But once the dust floats away (space and all that) then you are left with something rather empty and boring.  Wasn't a bad movie, it's simply not one I feel the need to ever see again.",1394582400,,589,4.327272727272727

The scenes  were flat even as objects are  approaching, coming into view. So many chances for a thrilling 3D movie and the best we get is a loose screw ! ,and that was just ok. As far as the story line...again just ok, but as it plots along the more unrealistic it becomes. I know at www. blu ray.com this movie has gotten rave reviews which is why I bought it...but I have to say it just doesn't cut the mustard. LOL..I thought the GREEN LANTERN was a better 3d movie.

The other technical and engineering aspects were well executed; the visuals stunning and expansive; and the story line was otherwise well written and executed. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney both gave marvelous and convincing performances. All in all I would give this movie 4.5 stars out of 5. I highly recommend it.

Let's face it Sandra Bullock is always fun to watch, and she pulls this off, barely. Likely will not watch it again. Sort of anticlimactic, it starts out well and just goes downhill from there and becomes more and more unbelievable. Sandra Bullock does a good job with a mixed script, sort of a ""speed"" in space performance, just less likely to have a positive outcome. The views of earth from space are spectacular, the weightless scenes are remarkable.  The end is definitely a ""what were they thinking"" moment!

5875641,2,B00DY64A3U,"First off, the cinematography is great. In fact the best way to watch this movie may be to mute it and ignore the actors on screen completely, taking in the vistas when they appear.
Secondly, watch something else. Apollo 13 (1995), Contact (1997) and Another Earth (2011) are some suggestions. I know what you may be thinking if you were around for the nineties...""Who hasn't seen Apollo 13?!?!"" According to how the director shot the movie, the answer they suggest would be ""No one! Now believe what we show you!!!""

There are mild SPOILERS in this review but I will try to keep out details.

If you have ever seen one of the original Alien movies, you only need to re-watch it imagining that there are no aliens to have seen the movie Gravity - the cast would be screaming and dying while making terrible decisions with their own stupidity being the only thing chasing them.
Gravity is a movie that seems to ignore every space movie released before it, assuming the audience has absolutely zero working knowledge of this genre of movie or the real-life science it plays with. Think of it this way, if this had been released 20 years ago it would have been revolutionary. However, a movie this painful to watch being released in this day in age is just insulting. It was as though the director was determined to take something which had potential and steer it in every ridiculous and wrong direction possible. I found this movie to be an embarrassment and a failed attempt to reach an audience that existed many years ago.

MORE IMPORTANT SPOILERS WITH DETAILS BELOW

Here's what I didn't like:
 - Director assumed the audience was dull - way too many inconsistencies and stupid actions that no one in their right mind would perform in space.
 - I'm pretty sure astronauts don't wear a tank-top and underwear under their suits - while the real thing may have been unnecessary, a bit of effort would have gone a long way here.
 - Anyone else notice the ""fetal position umbilical cord silhouetted against the window symbolizing her rebirth"" ridiculousness?
 - If Kowalski (Clooney) had pulled himself towards Stone (Bullock) having her float around in space and launched the escape pod instead, he probably could have saved her and made the movie about an hour shorter.
 - I thought astronauts trained in space to prevent their muscles from atrophy.
 - The music was often waaaaaaay to cheesy.
 - For having 6 months of training, Stone seemed to have absolutely no idea of what she was doing.
 - I don't like watching people drag their feet, move as slowly as possible, and take as long as possible to complete every single task as a gimmick to try to create tension. It is much more pleasing to watch people make sensible decisions and work at a believable speed and it makes a tense situation much more believable.
 - This movie is just frustrating. It should have been good, the visuals were great but it was just awfully executed.
 - I think you get the point... watch something else.",1394496000,,2987,4.675572519083969

Sure, the visuals and technology at play making the picture is a marvel. The acting is good, not great. But strip out the visuals and the story is sort of average.

I'm not exaggerating when I say I think my heart was pounding throughout the entire movie.  I watched it on my iPad with my headphones, so that may have affected the viewing experience somewhat. I liked how, as a viewer, I could see what the character's viewpoint was at times.  That made it more intense and real. I think the graphics were beautiful. I feel like I know what it's like to be on the inside of a space station now! The story was compelling, raw, intense, and stressful! It's hard to give an in-depth review on this one without revealing details about the plot, and of course I don't want to ruin that for anyone.

Ok,where do I start?  First, I have to admit I'm a child of the space age, growing up with an aerospace engineer that worked on many a space program in the 50's 60's and 70's. I have to admit, I'm biased because of this and for that reason I don't suffer stupidity in space movies lightly.  That said, visually the movie is first rate, no doubt about it.  Technically however, there are so many flaws they're hard to count.  Anyone with any sense of reality about space missions with have a very hard time with this movie.
In a nutshell, Bullock who shows early on she's prone to severe panic is able to survive having only 1% of O2 for many minutes, a fire on the International Space Station, piloting Russian and Chinese Spacecraft when all the controls are not in English, and in spite of the fact she failed the piloting part of her training back on earth.  And please explain why she was nominated for an Oscar when all she does in the movie is panic, scream and cry?  Ridiculous!

The WOW factors would give it a solid five star rating; without it I'd give it maybe three stars. Now I understand why, after receiving multiple Oscars, it did not take the ""Best Picture"" award.

I know I have questionable taste in movies, but it doesn't mean I don't recognize greatness when I see it, I just may not be as into it.  There were moments where you felt the lonliness and solitude of the vaccuum of space.  It made me consider another probabilty I hadn't fully realised before.  While space is infinite and full of untold mysteries and wonders, it's also pretty f****** scary.  The panic, the knowlegde of your imminent death, knowing that no one could save you even if they tried...spooky.  So yes this is a commercial and critical hit and a special effects masterpiece.  But I guess I just wasn't feeling it.  I could be wrong but I don't think you can just launch yourself out of a space shuttle without oxygen.  Honestly though I don't know.

Beyond the crappy script, there was little that was realistic about being in space. Newton's 1st law apparently doesn't apply in space during this film. It was overly dramatic and under realistic. If you want to see a movie about space see Ron Howard's Apollo 13 or go to your favorite IMAX theater for one of a handful of wonderful films on space.

The plot is constrained by the time of the movie, only 90 minutes. I get that. The events occur over a matter of hours, which makes sense because breathable oxygen is pretty limited in space. Accuracy of space travel, and physics, is largely compromised to Hollywood. A spoiler-free example: the dexterity and range of motion the characters utilize in their space suits is similar to ski gloves and a big jacket.

There are a few very intense scenes where Sandra's acting chops come into play but overall, what was all the fuss about.

I've also heard the director go on and on about taking 4 or 5 years to get this to screen because new technology had to be invented.  That being said, I found that some of the scenes where the actors are outside the spaceship looked hokey more than realistic.

At least Bullock already has an Oscar but I bet she was very disappointed just the same.

0 (zero) stars for the rest. Who cares about accuracy and education with our fantasy?
1. Anyone who has watched NASA TV broadcasts of shuttle/Hubble/ISS walks will laugh at all the stupid dialogue that this movie pushes forward as a reality.
2. The Russians, as joint participants, would never use a missile to experimentally blow up a satellite close to any working space endeavor. Further, there are much easier ways to allow a satellite to de-orbit and burn. And, if it was to test missile capability against satellites, again there are much easier ways of doing that.
3. Although space junk and meteors, asteroids, comets, etc. can reach relative speeds in the tens of thousands of mph it is far fetched to have so much debris accumulatively arrive together and so quickly.
4. Velocity and acceleration is far more fine tunable with pressurized gas from a MMU so all that flying about was a ""bit"" excessive. Even the movement by hand was unrealistically excessive.
5. The continuous and at times nonsensical talking out loud dialogue by Bullock would seem comical to anyone who has faced dangerous situations.
6. Clooney's sudden appearance scene towards the end was far fetched.
7. The tumbling escape module, all aflame; the heat tiles just on one side so they are rarely in a position to insulate. The end result should have left her as a very burnt cinder.
8. The coincidental landing in a lake; the removal of her space suit deep under water. Most people can't hold their breath even lying still for 1/4 of that time. Then crawling/walking out of the water as if it was after a dip in the Mediterranean - pleassssee!",1394323200,2,1713,4.787162162162162

I had been warned.  I missed seeing Gravity in the theater, but friends who saw it lamented the needlessly unrealistic depiction of operations in space.  ""Okay,"" I thought.  ""I can probably look past that if it's a good story.""

And maybe I could have.  But the entire opening scene was so chock full of stilted, trite, off-pace dialog that I was already reaching for the remote.  But, I had friends over for the movie, so we pressed bravely on.

Suffice it to say, if you have ever watched more than about five minutes of video from NASA, you will realize that all of the behavior exhibited by the characters in the movie is unrealistic.  If you know anything at all about space and space science, you will realize that the plot of the film -- from the crisis that precipitates the action to literally every step taken to resolve the crisis -- is impossible.

If you know anything about physics, you will be simultaneously infuriated and amazed.  Infuriated at all the things they got absurdly wrong, but amazed at how beautifully the things they got right were depicted.  It's pretty clear that one area where they did put some effort into things was in the depiction of the microgravity (""zero g"") environment, and how objects and other phenomena look.

And ultimately, looks are the name of the game here.  Especially in 3D, the movie is visually spectacular.  As much as I would like to get rid of this disc while there's still interest on the used market, I will probably keep it because some of the visuals are so amazing.  One image of an astronaut floating, with only the Milky Way and the stars beyond, was just jaw dropping.

To wrap up: If you go into this movie purely for the visual spectacle, and you can ignore bad writing, bad acting and massive plot problems, then you can probably enjoy it.  See it in 3D if you can.",1394323200,9,1864,4.546546546546547

I did not want to see it, but my son loves space...I am glad I did! Yes it was intense, but the good kind of intense...what do you do in a case of an emergency? Are you going to give up? Or you are going to survive?
An Empowering Movie!
Don't Ever Give up!  That's the message!
Watch it with your Family",1394323200,,336,3.926470588235294
5875965,1,B00DY64A3U,"Except for the first twenty minutes maybe, it was really a snoozer.  I really like Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, but they needed to be together more to make this movie work.  I would not recommend the movie.",1394323200,5,212,4.552631578947368
5875966,2,B00DY64A3U,"The special effects are spectacular and the acting is top notch but the plot is extremely improbable if you know anything about survival in space or piloting. When you are exposed to the vacuum of space you suffer explosive decompression - you don't float around with a smile on your face. Space suits are very fragile - they cannot take that kind of abuse and how a medical doctor could read flight manuals in other languages and pilot a complex ship is beyond me, but Sandra was very beautiful in space and was worth the price of admission.",1394323200,,542,4.540816326530612
5875967,4,B00DY64A3U,IT WAS VERY REALISTIC AND GRIPPING. THE TECHINICAL WAS SPECTACULAR.I THOUGHT SANDRA BULLOCK DID AN ADMIRABLE JOB.I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE.,1394323200,,142,5.809523809523809
5875968,5,B00DY64A3U,"Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) are on a Space Shuttle mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope. After a Russian missile strike destroys a satellite, a cloud of debris in orbit is created. The debris strikes their Shuttle destroying it leaving only Stone and Kowalski alive and without any safe way to return to Earth. Their mission becomes one of survival.

The film features fantastic visual effects that give the viewer the sense that they are floating along with the action in the movie. When watching the film, you really get the sense of the beauty of Earth from orbit. The filmmakers also took great care to depict the microgravity of space in a realistic fashion as the astronaut characters float around on spacewalks or inside spacecraft.

Sandra Bullock does an excellent job of bringing her character to life as she overcomes adversity.

The film is also a real treat for those who like some science with their science fiction. The movie, which has been praised by scientists and astronauts, tries to stick to real-life facts when possible. This includes depiction of real-life spacecraft, such as the Space Shuttle, the International Space Station, and the Soyuz, correctly depicting that there is no sound in space, and realistic depictions of weightlessness. Some liberties are taken such as ignoring the realities of orbital mechanics.

This 2-disc DVD set also contains hours of fascinating bonus features mostly focusing on the making of the movie and how cutting edge technology was used to pull off the numerous visual effects in the film.

I thought this was excellent film. Ignore the naysayers. If you like science fiction, see this movie.",1394323200,,1701,5.060714285714286
5875969,1,B00DY64A3U,"Boring, Laughable. Unrealistic. Zero character development. Stupid script, possible written by a 15 year old? Bullock's acting: sophomoric. (Please Academy Awards, better nominees next year.) Floating around like a fish through these fully equipped, abandoned, but oh-so-convenient, space stations not bumping into anything, her little toes pointed. Hilarious. Her final act had us laughing out loud - it was that bad. Another part that we almost rolled on the floor laughing was the part with the fire extinguisher. OMG> who came up with that one?  Probably the worst movie we have watched in years, if not ever. Kept it on while we cruised the internet on our laptops, just to see if anything worthwhile happened-we had paid for it after all. What a waste.",1394323200,8,758,5.112903225806452

5875975,3,B00DY64A3U,"The visual effects are spectacular.  The story, unfortunately, runs out of steam about halfway through, and the plot twist seemed silly to me.  It feels like they got the premise set up and the plot tension established, and then didn't know what to do with it.  Ran out of money, perhaps?  Sandra Bullock's character spends way too much time acting out panic, and after a while it doesn't feel quite genuine.  I loved the pictures and the actors - too bad the story didn't do a better job of supporting them.",1394323200,,508,4.538461538461538

I am disappointed I am getting on this 3D train when the ride appears to be almost over, but hopefully more people give it a try with movies like this and it can see a comeback.",1394323200,2,465,3.9468085106382977

5875988,2,B00DY64A3U,"Yes, tedious, even in its relentless tension and constant suspense, heightened by the interminable shmaltziness of the score. I feel as though I subjected myself to a mild form of torture. And the final anti-climactic climax was so unrealistic as to be ridiculous.

5875992,5,B00DY64A3U,"I grew up a child of NASA. In the late 60's and early 70's they were the rock gods of the nerds. But later on, as the shuttle was such a disappointment, I turned my eyes back down to earth, wondering why we were wasting so much money in space and accomplishing nothing. Where were the space cities on the moon? The great space station wheels that science fiction showed us? Then Gravity came along. I don't care if it doesn't bend to every single rule of physics - Alfonso Cuaron (Children of Men) is BRILLIANT and this is a GREAT movie. The two person cast, and I usually don't care for Clooney, who is the same in every role, and Sandra Bullock are superb. The entire movie is breathtaking and it's hard to believe it wasn't shot in space. A MUST SEE.",1394323200,2,753,4.2727272727272725

If you like a good original story, one that you haven't already seen 100 times, avoid this movie like the plague.

Yes, I know it's a movie and believability is not necessarily the epitome of a good movie though for me, it is what I look for in a movie of this type - scientifically as correct as it can be, i.e. swimming to the top and walking out of the water after the harrowing experience of re-entering earth and almost drowning.

Many can tell you where Gravity failed, but I like to focus on where it succeeded. In two words, Gravity is stunningly visual. It's all about the cinematography, special effects, aesthetics, and emotions. I haven't seen such beauty since 2001: A Space Odyssey and Prometheus. Gravity was well-written and beautifully acted. There are scenes that might seem boring, but I assure you there is something going on in nearly every frame work. Gravity real strenght is in its ability to tell a story through every iconic scene.

Since space is so big, even in orbit at similar altitudes, I'm doubtful that debris from a destroyed satellite would rain in such dense patterns. However, it made for a great story. The combination of very realistic movement in orbit, along with the space debris hazard, made this an extremely interesting movie to watch. Clooney and Bullock were excellent.

The movie was not gaping maw boring as was Open Water (I fast forwarded the movie when I couldn't stand it anymore), but much worse than many other movies out there - even Avatar.  The special effects or CGI were very good, however.  This was the only reason I watched it through to the end.  Still, I was not impressed with the special effects to be eager to watch more of the movie.

Although it is a great display of special effects and technical work, the story and characters are never developed, leaving us to cling onto and picture the implied events from the few tales that are told during their adventure.

Most of the scene-setting stories and back-stories for astronaut adventure and disaster movies have pretty much become, for the most part, clich.  Of course there are places in the movies that require some suspension of believability but, I was more than willing to let that go.  The biggest suspension of rationale was the fact that the shuttle, the ISS, and the Chinese space station were all just right there for all this jumping between from spacecraft to spacecraft.  And just what force is it that keeps pulling on both astronauts while one was hung up on the shroud lines of the parachute while she tried to hang onto the line from the other astronaut ???  But, if you can get past all that, then just cruise from one clifthanger to the next whilst you wonder if anybody is going to live through all this.

Didn't they notice that was a dream and he wasn't really there ???  HOWEVER ... It's a GOOD MOVIE and worth watching and don't let the rinky-dink stuff that others bring up.

I had not planned on seeing Gravity ever. But all of a sudden, I found myself curious about all the hype surrounding it. It seemed to me that the reviews were torn down the middle: either they hated it, or they loved it. So I gave it a shot. I have to admit that it starts out a little slow and they almost lost me. But the next thing you know, Sandy Bullock is flying through space, untethered. That definitely woke me up. This movie had me sitting straight up, eyes glued to the television until it was over. It was way past my bedtime, so that is a significant detail. I can't really go on about why I liked it so much without giving everything away. But I would say give it a chance. Forget what you think you know and just watch the damn thing. I have never seen anything like it. I wish I had seen it at the IMAX or even just in a theater because my 40 inch did not do it justice.",1394150400,2,1024,4.0245098039215685

Good acting and awesome special effects reset the bar to a new level of non fiction fantasy that makes you wondering that technology will continue to be driving factor that drives picture production into the space age.

It is about the danger of living a life ""detached"" from the world, and the symbolic power gravity has over all of us.  The characters are who they are in order to bring balance to an overwhelming amount of peril.

Technically, it's perfect in my sight.  It's the kind of film the visionaries could only imagine before creating a movie like ""A Trip to the Moon"" a hundred years ago.  It is a big, red thumbtack marking a pivotal point in the lineage of cinema history.",1394150400,,614,4.342105263157895

She did a great job portraying the emotions, fear and intense effort one would do in outerspace.  Yet the performance wasn't better than other performances. George Clooney had a smaller role but the performance wasn't over the top exciting.
The concept of the movie and the visuals is what keeps you on the edge. There are times you are not certain if Sandra will make it back to earth.

I would recommend this movie because it is great to watch.  The acting was believable but nothing spectacular since the movie didn't call for an above average performance.

5876237,1,B00DY64A3U,"You know how it is when you shake a bottle of seltzer and finally open it,  just to find that the soda is flat.
That's how it is with ""Gravity"",  though I believe the studio knew it was a dud before all the hype,  and that is deceptive advertising - plain and simple.

The way this film was pitched I had actually considered the possibility of leaving the theater on an EMS stretcher.  I was expecting a movie that would grab me by the throat and not let go.
The only thing that did that was the yawn I was suppressing for most of ninety minutes.

Now the 3-D effect is anything but cartoonish, unlike the plot and characters.  I've seen better drama and writing by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.

Which brings me to the next problem with this film.

In ""Saving Private Ryan""  Captain Miller and Corporal Upham share a scene in which they talk about their lives back home.  These characters who are already deeply drawn are now given even more  complexity.

There is a similar exchange in ""Gravity"" between Kowalsky and Stone but to no avail,  these two remain flat as cardboard against a breathtaking space scape.  You never really know them or even truly empathize with them as you should with people in their situation.  Best Director!?!  Who's kidding who?

The American Motion Picture Academy does absolutely nothing but pat themselves on the back for doing absolutely nothing.

But let's face it,  this movie did all it was supposed to do,  and that is: make a lot of money.  Sadly, much of that came from others like myself who feel they were ripped off.",1394150400,11,1556,4.50179211469534

(Spoiler) Why did she have to let the captain go? According to the rules of gravity, when he reached the end of that tether, shouldn't he have bounced back? I mean, the station didn't appear to be spinning so centripetal force shouldn't factor in. It struck me and my husband as a little strange when the rest of the movie really showcased the nature of Zero G so spectacularly. Otherwise, this movie was awesome!

There are times I wish I could take my words back.

I remember seeing trailers for this and thinking at the time, how on earth can this be any good if our protagonists are stranded in space so early on? I said to myself, this movie is not going to be all that great, a one-trick pony at best.

Well, as it turns out, this pony has several tricks.

It's very rarely that I take note of the use of sound in a movie, but I have to say that I have not been this impressed with sound since the beachhead scene in Saving Private Ryan. It really is that good. A good example in particular is one towards the last few minutes of the movie.

As far as visuals go . . . I am still kicking myself for not seeing this in the theater or IMAX. I have a projector with a ~100"" screen and as amazing as that is I can only imagine how grand it must have been to see this on an even bigger screen. I particularly like the long, unbroken duration of many of the shots. The way the movie is presented definitely makes me feel that this is not something that could have been expressed as well in song, art, story, videogame or other mediums.

I see some people complain about the plot, or lack of it. I disagree. Not every movie needs to be a three-hour epic with a cast of dozens, deep background stories and side-plots. Imagine if all of literature were 1,000 page tomes like ""War and Peace"". How boring. So with that being said, this movie is more along the lines of an Aesop's Fable--a simple and short story with a couple memorable characters and an important message. I guess some people were expecting Lord of the Rings--in space.

Ironically, there are a few literary nods in this movie. One can spot foreshadowing and even a little bit of symbolism if you pay attention.

This is simply a thrilling movie to watch. More importantly, it's one of those movies I think you'll want to watch again. To paraphrase Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges, ""Rereading . . . is what counts."" When you have an strong gravitational urge to watch a movie again--even though you know how it ends, who says what and what happens when--that's when you know how good a movie really is.

Finally, Gravity is a great movie partly because it takes us as close to space as most of us will ever get . . . and at a fraction of the price offered by billionaires with bad hair.",1394064000,,2351,4.265168539325843

5876358,3,B00DY64A3U,I expected a lot more from this movie after all the hype. Don't want to be a spoiler but if you've seen the trailer you've seen the best of this one.,1394064000,,149,3.838709677419355
5876359,5,B00DY64A3U,"This was one of the movies I wanted to see in 2013.  It was one of few were I actually regretted not seeing it in theaters because everyone kept talking about how the movie was really good, and that the visual effects in 3D are amazing.  While my entertainment system at home is perfectly adequate for me, I know that it could not replicate the experience in a theater.

Fast forward to now, and I received this 3D copy of the movie.  This is the first 3D movie I've ever watched and the first I'll be utilizing my 3D TV.  This was actually an impulse buy after watching the Oscars. I caved and immediately purchased it (especially since 3D rental sites are hard to come by).

This DVD package came complete with the 3D version, BluRay, and DVD.  One thing I noticed is that the digital activation code was only valid for Flixster.  Normally, every movie I've purchased works both on Flixster and Vudu, but this one only had access to the former.  There isn't much information online, however it seems that Walmart is the only retailer that carries this BluRay along with a Vudu pass.  It makes sense considering that Walmart and Vudu are partners.  It's strange though that Walmart also carries the 3D version, but like the one on Amazon, it appears to not include a Vudu pass.  It would've been nice to have a Vudu pass as a backup to viewing this movie since I most likely wouldn't ever watch this movie on a small mobile device through Flixster, but that's OK.

Overall, great movie, and fast Prime shipping from Amazon as always.  If you don't care about the 3D version, I'd suggest you check out the ""Walmart Exclusive"" as it provides the most in both disk and digital formats, otherwise, Amazon as per usual, is the place to get it.

UPDATE: After logging into my Vudu account both on my Blu-Ray and computer, I noticed that an HDX version of Gravity did show up!  It looks like it just took some time for it to register from UV to Vudu.  Now there's no reason to purchase from Walmart, the digital code works on Vudu as well!",1394064000,,2033,4.451351351351351

5876361,3,B00DY64A3U,"Note: Spoilers

I hadn't the chance to see this at the cinema, but was still blown away by the effects on a 47"" 3D HDTV.

Positives:
Shots from inside the helmet were wonderful - along with the sound in there give great realism of what it may be there.
Special affects were good, including realism on how objects may disintegrate during a break up (ISS for example).
Earth sunset and sunrises looked wonderful.
The idea was a good one, and I'm sure the makers had good intentions.
Great acting from Clooney and Bullock.

Negatives:
The initial scene set off on a terrible footing, that was completely unnecessary for the story - Clooney jetting round Hubble for no reason. Completely irrational and no regard for damage to Hubble from the pack's emissions, and MMUs don't exactly zip around either. Also, Bullock had no SAFER pack of her own. All spacewalking astronauts have them. Here, they have tethers, except for the guy with the country music.
Clooney asking Bullock about her family and so on. Astronauts train for years together. You would assume the romantic situation and child may have been mentioned at some point in time during the training, but what do I know...
Orbits: Debris occurred at Hubble orbit - 347 miles up. ISS 230 miles up. GEO satellites were knocked out too. Problem being their orbit is over 22,000 miles up. Think New York to LA - going east. Some debris field right there. Also, inclinations are all off. Hubble has an inclination for the USA. ISS for Russia for Soyuz missions.
There is no gravity - Clooney wasn't pulling on Bullock. His weight had no effect. Yeah, just let him go, he's too ""heavy"".
Some of the high action scenes had music. As mentioned before, sound inside the helmet gave realism, but when the ISS breaks up, and the initial impacts - may have expected less in the way of mood music to ruin the realism.
Bullock getting out of the suit on her own at speed... takes 2 people, and longer than 30 seconds.
Air locks with outside locks and controls. Not so much.
Bullock in a top and shorts inside a spacesuit. No temperature regulation via the full-body liquid cooled suit then? Or adult diaper?
The fire extinguisher. No. Just no.

Overall, it was a good movie. Good effects and well intentioned and exciting, but for anyone who shows even a casual interest in physics, space and space technology, you may want to rent instead of buy - and hide the remote to prevent you from throwing something at the screen.

The story was very far fetched and unbelievable. The gravity free motion was quite good. The views from space were great.

When my wife watch something together we sometimes comment that the TV episode or movie has ""filer,"" scenes that have little to do with the story but they just had to kill time.

I don't see any reviews pointing that out.  If this movie didn't move you, then you've never had a personal tragedy in your life.  Lucky you.  I am amused by the reviews less than 4 stars and all the people pointing out flaws in the realism.  This movie was never marketed as being scientifically accurate.  I bet you all loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Star Wars and Transformers and all that ""real world"" stuff.  This movie is a masterpiece on so many levels, right down to the soundtrack and the obvious nod to Jaws when Clooney and Bullock return to the shuttle.

Even with stars like Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, a film with basically one actress attempting to carry the whole film just seemed to me to fail. Like I said, there were redeeming scenes, but overall .... Waste of time.",1394064000,,621,4.316239316239316

5876435,5,B00DY64A3U,I love to see Sandra Bullock act when she gets a good vehicle - and the vehicle she's in gives her an academy award opportunity!  I believed every step along the way in this one and Sandra gave us one of those rare performances that reach deep inside of you.  Soon as this one ended I texted my daughter to see it; how Sandra survives is truly inspirational.  Watch it!

Sandra Bullock miraculously ends up in a Chinese space station, can't read any instruments or control panels so uses ""Eeeny Meeny Miney Mo"", pushes a few buttons and ends up back on Earth. Yeah, right. I nearly choked on my popcorn.

Clooney's character was way too cavalier, arrogant and in the end annoying. I'm glad he disappeared quickly.",1394064000,3,400,4.867647058823529

Why on earth it won so many Academy Awards is a mystery to me.  I was glad when George Clooney's obnoxious character passed into oblivion (before I did.)  Sure the pictures of the far away earth are nice, but that's not enough to keep me happy.  I can just watch the Amazing Planet Earth for that kind of thing.",1394064000,2,476,4.2444444444444445

5876483,3,B00DY64A3U,Visually Gravity is awesome. I felt that way about the entire film until I remembered Apollo 13. This was like Days of Thunder .....not even believable......Sandra Bullock just  jumps in a Chinese space station as its being blasted by debris and flys it home!!!!!no consideration of re entry angle or anything. ......Come on Hollywood I know you love the reality TV platform but with films remember you still need to suspend our disbelief.

I have only one complaint and that is the DVD did not include closed captions.

5876591,1,B00DY64A3U,"Total unmitigated crap.  Plot not believeable.  Not worthy of good actors like Bullock and Clooney.  Speaks to movie industries penchant for going for youth where you blow things up, have visual eye candy that you can put in IMAX theatres and stick 3D glasses on people so they go ""ooh"" and ""aah"" over FX.

A movie like Nebraska, Blue Jasmine and Philomena are Oscar worthy.  Certainly not this piece of crapola.

5876592,4,B00DY64A3U,"Now that this is out on DVD, Blu-Ray, 3-D or whatever your preferred poison and the Academy Awards are over, you've probably heard quite a bit about ""Gravity"" already.  I hope I can add something interesting.

Is this scientifically accurate?  No, there are several areas in which it takes liberties for dramatic purpose.  For example: space debris traveling at 20,000 or 22,000 mph passes by on the screen looking like it's going about 200-250 mph.  In reality, unless you saw it on radar you would never see debris coming that fast before it hit you or hit something nearby.  Could the destruction of one satellite trigger such a rapid cascade of debris taking out most orbiting satellites (as well as space stations, shuttles etc?)  No, they wouldn't fall like a stack of dominoes in rapid succession.  However this relates to one of the strengths of the film: its grounding in real concerns.

The DVD or Blu-Ray has a lot of ""special features"", the best of which I felt was a documentary about the real problem of space debris.  I didn't realize this actually has its own name now (from the NASA scientist who first raised alarm flags).  As the documentary points out, our modern world increasingly relies upon satellites: for phone transmissions, GPS, TV, and all kinds of things.  And there's a huge amount of JUNK out there now.  I remember hearing about the Chinese ""shooting down"" one of their own ageing weather satellites to test the technology, which produced a huge amount of orbiting debris.  I did NOT remember ever hearing that an Iridium satellite collided with an out-of-service Russian military satellite producing an even larger amount of orbiting debris.  I remember one US shuttle coming back with a big ole chip out of the front windshield, thought most likely the result of collision with a really small object like a fleck of paint, at the huge velocities involved if orbiting things collide head-on.  I did NOT hear that the International Space Station has many such damage marks already.  I thought if we just took care not to increase the amount of junk up there, it would gradually decrease, as orbits tend to decay and stuff eventually falls back to earth.  On the contrary there is a real concern that further collisions between large objects in orbit will produce large increases in orbiting debris, increasing the odds of more collisions, causing even more debris, until we reach the point that most existing satellites would be in peril, as would future launches.  Once we reached that point, we could in fact lose many useful satellites and the services they provide, and be unable to safely replace them and be assured that their replacements would last a long time.  That's the realistic background for the story.

And this story is very well-done.  Visually it's fantastic (not just on IMAX and not just in 3-D, but on a home system too).  Dramatically, it's hard to ask for much better.  A lot of thought went into every scene, every word of dialog.  This is a movie worth watching.  The PG-13 rating also seems appropriate; there are scenes of dead bodies and it could easily be too frightening for children, but there is no unnecessary blood, gore, swearing or nudity.

The biggest complaint I could offer is: not only a lot of thought went into everything, on the ""bonus features"" they had to TELL you their every thought too.  A movie of 91 minutes ought not to have a special feature of 1 hr 45 minutes of talking about how they did it.  Sorry, I think that goes on a ""commentary soundtrack"" which should be cut down to 91 minutes.  But in addition to the nice science documentary, there's also a nice short film made by the director, very much related to the main feature, which I enjoyed watching.  Clearly, Cuaron really loves making films.",1393977600,2,3787,4.771121351766513

The experience of watching Gravity is exceptional and  literally out of this world. The problem for me is the poorly contrived story, and the lack of attention to general details that anyone who has a general idea of world history in space, probability, and common sense would easily (maybe not) see. We the viewers, are from the very beginning of the film wondering the state of mind of Dr. Ryan Stone after given the order to return to the ship because of debris. We later find, through revelations set in self inflicted death situations, a real Dr. Stone would have never in a million years passed the pre psychological testing for space because of suicidal tendencies and complete lack of motivation to survive. The consistent thread throughout the movie is that Dr. Stone  creates all of  the negative ""life or death"" situations. The combination of probability of  being hit from debris, coupled with her lack of ambition to live, and Dr. Stone's complete disregard to the time she has before her next ""life or death"" encounter was wayyyy to much - because in space no one's suppose to hear you scream

She escapes the space shuttle being blown to bits only to make it to the space station to take off her suit and float around in her underwear until the space junk obits the planet and comes around to destroy the station.

5876855,5,B00DY64A3U,"Gravity is an unparalleled 3D experience on a high quality home theater. On my very large Samsung 3D monitor Gravity is the best 3D experience thus far produced. It is not only better on my 720 CMR (Clear Motion Rate) system than in the latest, greatest IMAX 3D theater it is MUCH better.

The plot, actors, script, scientific accuracy, pacing and just about everything else is subpar. I have never felt that high quality special effects make a lousy movie worth watching. And I still dont. But like the first Star Wars in 1977 Gravity is a breakthrough technology experience. And like Star Wars, 3D Gravity (in the home theater) will continue to be enjoyable to watch. You couldn't pay me to watch Gravity in 2D standard definition or watch Star Wars as a play.

Gravitys theater versions, 3D/blu-ray/DVD/streaming versions are so different that they should be treated as distinct and separate products. Mixing all reviews of all versions into one big pot has made the reviews soup tasteless and unappealing.  Thankfully, some content providers are providing filtering of reviews by version, packaging, vendor performance, etc.

On a related matter: Gravity has put a final nail in the coffin of Amazons arrogance in refusing to filter reviews by version and issue (shipping, packaging, price, etc). I am so sick and tired of having to wade through irrelevant reviews that I no longer see Amazon as the best source of acquiring movies and TV shows. I have begun purchasing from a competitor that I was led to after I was fed up with not easily finding relevant reviews of 3D Gravity.

Hmmmmmm, only two actors, suspicious for Cannes-type weirdness....but not. I loved it. 90 minutes went by very quickly. Sandra Bullock was fantastic--I know, in a SCIFI--and this is a rare time where I will give the director most of the credit. She was awesome. Cuaron though put it together masterfully, and in such a way you don't notice the director's touch. You want the scenes at Houston. You want the public's reaction. You want to see the helicopters thumping in for the rescue. Denied. Almost purely first person. Artsy yes but deserved the Academy's recognition.",1393891200,,878,4.9391891891891895

if you have a below average IQ, you may like Gravity, because the script is terrible, and written for 3rd graders.  the only feeling you get from this movie is stress and tension.  boring acting, boring and fake characters, no realism, no physics, no anything.  this deserves no awards of any kind.  unless they are ""razzies""",1393891200,,564,4.524752475247524

5876917,5,B00DY64A3U,"Just talking with other people who have seen ""Gravity"", it seems either people loved it or hated it.
Personally,  I found ""Gravity"" to be a stunning visual experience accompanied by Sandra Bullock's fine performace.
Having seen the movie in 3D IMAX at the theatre,  and again in 2D on my 55"" TV, I would definitely recommend seeing this in 3D. The 2D version is not bad, however, the 3D format is what makes this a visually stunning experience.
Given the hype surrounding this movie, and seeing the 2D version, one can understand why some people feel the movie wasn't as good as expected.  (It's almost like having popcorn without the butter).
Nonetheless,  in 3D, the opening scenes make the viewer feel like they are right there with Sandra and George Clooney. Countless other scenes provide similar viewing experiences and a ""wow"" factor.  Overall, the 3D is really top notch.
As for the acting,  Sandra provides a great performance and George is typical George in his limited role.
Although there are a few slow moments in the film, these moments are used to build the characters and are like a ""calm before the storm"". If slow moments in a sci-fi movie turn you off, then use them for an opportunity to refill your popcorn bowl - 'cause when you return, you'll once again find yourself glued to the screen as the impending debris field makes its orbit back to Sandra. If you don't mind a little jibber-jabber between George and Sandra, these moments will pass by painlessly.
Overall,  there is still plenty of suspense and action to be had. And, whether seen in 2D or 3D, this is still a must-see film for fans of sci-fi/ space genre type movies.",1393891200,,1651,4.692041522491349

Without giving away the movie, it seemed to amp up quite early in regard to high intensity action. (Maybe that's what they were going for) The issue I had is that it did not calm down. Sometimes I need a little break before the next emergency pops on the screen. In that regard, I was thinking that the character in the movie would execute a world-wide tour of all available space stations or space craft...almost like a space-aged Frogger.

An astronaut has been separated from her ship by a collision with space wreckage..  She is trying to make it back to her ship -- any ship -- and here comes the deadly space wreckage again.

Transfer this story idea back to earth: Sandra Bullock has been separated from her small boat in the middle of the ocean, and she has to swim back to it.  One major problem: The tiger sharks.  They come for her and she barely gets out of the way as they pass.  Then as she finally places a hand on her boat and catches her breath -- she looks over her shoulder.  Here comes a Great White!  It,s bigger than her boat!  With huge monstrous jaws!  Now she has to hurry and push, and push, and push the boat out of the way.  Here it comes!  It's right behind her! One last push and the Great White barely misses her as it brushes against her boat.

But it's still not over.  Her boat is taking on water -- it's going to sink!  She has to paddle over to another smaller boat, not knowing if it is taking on water too.  And here come the sharks again!  Paddle Sandra, paddle!!!

It was really hard for me to look past the fact that these objects in the film are no where near each other, LEO comprises a massive area.  If you're working on the hubble, you don't get to scoot over to the ISS using a MMU, and then over the the 'Chinese Station' in your busted up Soyuz capsule.  Nevermind the 'event' in the movie is impossible, nor the idea that any such event could take down all communications sattelites which reside in a variety of orbits including geostationary which is Oh... 35,500 KM from LEO.  Nevermind physics and the limitations of pressurized suits...

If you're able to overlook all of these, it is, like I said a very pretty movie.  For me, I prefer substance over fluff, and this movie was nothing but fluff.  There's nothing to make you think, and really I didn't care about the characters all that much.",1393891200,,947,4.568047337278107

Especially if you watch all the special features. Once you get past them gushing out over the script being so detailed and well written for half an hour, you get into the amazing tech and team work it took to pull off this film. It was very well made.

As a person who is well envolved with CG due to game development, I knew when they CG-ed a scene and could tell natural movement from animation, but it never got so distracting I thought, ""oh, terrible cgi used there..."", so they did an amazing job. THen there is the films concept and execution of it. See this film and buy the Bluray! ONe of the best films of the year.",1393891200,,1349,4.307086614173229

Even though it's mostly computer created, it's scenes depict very accurately the depth and bone chilling aloneness of deep space. Both Clooney and Bullick turn in competent acting jobs, but only competent.  The dialog between the two sounds almost like they were reading a script, not saying lines.

Along the way, expect to swallow a lot of maggot-ridden CHEESE. Oh, and as for the oft-repeated claim that the film was ""realistic"", well no, just REALLY bad. A true embarrassment of the sort that can only be produced by overrated ""stars"" in an over-budget cesspool of shop-worn cliches. As for the director, well, I can't be too harsh because he IS the man who made ""Y Tu Mam Tambin"" which is a near-masterpiece.

On the other hand give it two stars for a story line that just plain dumb.  Try to get your head around a down-in-the-dumps woman who lost her only child in an accident whose life is sleeping, working, and driving around in her car, and, therefore, has given up on life.  (By the way, what happened to the father or anyone else?)  Regardless of all this, she is a genius scientist who is qualified to be an astronaut fearlessly wandering around in space while in a personal funk.  Her new zest for life happens in a dream visit by a dead astronaut who turns her suicidal melancholy around.  This enables her to suffer great catastrophic events, but still comes out a new optimistic woman.  Wow, makes sense to me!  Plus you have Sandra Bullock just needing to be cutezy from time to time.

The male hero (George Clooney) is deliriously happy just drifting off to a sure death enjoying the glorious sunrise on the Ganges.  Just an easy payday for old George

It reminds me in some ways of Cuaron's earlier film ""Children of Men"" (that review is coming soon).
It had a message, but that message couldn't be correctly conveyed without the film itself.

For the bottom line, i've gotta call this movie for what it is, and that simply is Perfect,

5877284,1,B00DY64A3U,"I just wasted $5 and 90 minutes of my life watching this dopey Brit-Hollywood junk. I'm giving it one star because the special effects are in fact really good. But the plot? Forget it. The dialog? Absurdly inane. My advice? Go read a good book instead.

Oh, and to those who think that the ""science"" in this film is realistic: Even if the Hubble Space Telescope, International Space Station, and a mythical Chinese space station were all conveniently aligned in the same orbital plane, and within a few km of each other, (which they are not - not by a long shot) it would be completely impossible to merrily flit between them with an astronaut backpack or spacecraft as was done in the film. You don't just point and shoot - the orbital mechanics involved are so much more complex than that, and to present such a scenario in such a simplistic manner is an insult to real science.

And while we're on the subject of merry flitting and scientific insults: The film opens with Sandra Bullock working on a Hubble repair while two other astronauts (Clooney among them) seem to be present for their own amusement. They're both playing in space like kids in a sandbox while Bullock does all of the work. During the real, incredibly complex, challenging, and heroic Hubble repair missions, every second of every spacewalk was meticulously planned and executed. There is no time for frivolity, and to suggest otherwise is an insult to the astronauts who train so hard and risk their lives to accomplish seemingly-impossible tasks. If you're not in the mood to read a book, go watch a documentary about the real Hubble repair missions - they're fascinating.",1393804800,10,1648,4.758741258741258

The story is more than just a ""survival movie"" in space. It is a meditation on the human condition, the triumph of the human spirit and the stunning beauty of God's creation.

I love, love, love how at the very end, the character Sandra plays emerges form the water, through the muck - unable to walk at first, and eventually standing upright and walking away after giving thanks. Symbolic in ways that brought me to tears.

There is more to the name ""Gravity"" than it's name makes you believe. The same is true of movies like ""Flight"". If you don't ""get it"" then I suggest you take some time to understand we are all ""at play in the fields of the Lord"".

W/O ruining the film, there is a part where Clooney is threatening to ""cut"" his tether to Bullock, saying he was pulling on her and she ""could not hold him."" Wrong! There was no centrifugal force being applied. Once movement has been stopped in space, it is no longer an issue! They acted like they were hanging from a cliff and his weight (they are weightless in space) was going to pull her off. Now for the Apollo 13 rip offs! They have Clooney listening to ""Twangy"" country music like Bill Paxton was playing on his portable tape player in Apollo 13, as his character Fred Haise. Another 13 rip off was when Sondra Bullock, in a very important scene, reaches out to tap on a gauge to see if it is stuck. First off, the gauge is an exact copy, or the same gauge ""tapped"" in Apollo 13. Nearly 40 years later, in an age of electronics, they show an old mechanical gauge in a spacecraft, even if it was Russian!

5877324,3,B00DY64A3U,"First, the obvious - this is technically one of most ambitious movies in a while, creating and executing CG techniques that will be emulated for years to come. Director Cuaron is an absolute master of incredibly impressive camera moves and filming setups (take a look at Children of Men if you enjoy these) and Gravity shows off a good dozen or so shots that you simply have never seen before. After a while, you lose all sense of direction and spatial awareness and it conveys a remarkable feeling of what total weightlessness might feel like, trumping Apollo 13 and all those that have gone before it. It's a truly magnificent visual feat that anyone with a technical interest in film will love - I rewatched several scenes a few times and bored my wife with my commentary.

That said, there's absolutely no substance to the story which tries to champion the will of the human spirit and the decision to choose life over despair. Very admirable notions indeed, but ideas that fizzle in this very, very thin plot that struggles to fill 90 minutes. Bullock is excellent at carrying the weight of the script (excuse the pun) and Clooney is Clooney, bouncing around space with his usual swagger until he makes a not-very-convincing decision about 30 minutes into the flick.

Whereas Children of Men was a fully fledged story with subtlely, density and believable back stories, Gravity puts Bullock's doctor character into space to change graphics cards and then fumble around for 90 minutes to avoid being blitzed by the debris from a Russian missile. NASA enthusiasts will yawn at the depictions of orbits, debris and weightlessness and for a film that gets all the visuals right, it's a shame they didn't make a couple of calls to the boys at the space agency to fact-check the action scenes.

I really, really wanted to love this film. Honestly I did but once you get over the staggering visuals, there's just nothing there to create any emotional impact and it certainly wasn't worth the sweep at the Oscars last night.",1393804800,2,2021,4.785100286532951
5877325,3,B00DY64A3U,"i didn't expect much going in.  that's why i didn't bother watching it at the theatres.  when it won the most oscars last night, i decided to see what all the hype was about.  SPOILER:  the hype is the special effects.

the story simply isn't there.  a woman is the sole survivor of a catestrophic accident in orbit and eventually makes it back to earth.  there is the silghtest attempt at humanizing this otherwise robot of a woman by allowing her admission that she once had a child who died tragically at age four.  beyond that, you could have put robots or androids in the starring role(s) (if you include george clooney's few minutes at the beginning) and the story wouldn't have suffered at all.

then there's the implausibility of the entire thing.  THAT, and the fact that it takes place in orbit, as opposed to, say, on earth, make it science fiction, i suppose.  but basically you've got ""castaway"" in space, minus the volleyball and with about an hour shaved off of your viewing time and a few years shaved off the main character's time.

except that it's more likely that tom hanks would have gotten off his island and back to memphis (or wherever) than that sandra bullock would have continually dodged space debris that destroyed several satellites, a space shuttle and not one, but two space stations.  not only was she miraculously spared getting hit by .... ANYTHING, not even the smallest pinhole-creating debris, but she survived floating off into space (remember that killed frank poole a mere 13 years ago), a fire inside a space station, and a 1960's apollo-style re-entry and crash landing.  and successfully managed to fly a spacecraft and complete various other technically complicated extra-vehicular maneuvers, with her self-professed lack of ability and failures in training.

i want this woman's luck!  (unless, that is, the island at the end is deserted and she goes through all that trouble getting back to earth only to end up on a deserted island.  with no volleyball or ice skate.  (let's hope so!))

don't watch this movie because it's a great movie.  watch it if you want to see how they can make an accident in space look real.  or watch it because you really dig sandra bullock or george clooney.  (but not so much george clooney.  his time in the movie is short-lived.  in all ways.)

and i firmly believe that if this movie had been done with any actors other than a-list actors, it wouldn't have even been considered for an oscar.  without the special effects it wouldn't have even been on the radar.  and if a man had been cast as the main character, it wouldn't have gotten nearly the raves.  but strong women in main character roles is big right now.  and sandra bullock, for various and sundry reasons, is currently hollywood's darling.  and if someone filmed george clooney brushing his teeth, people would get in line to buy the dvd.

TIP:  if you want a great science fiction movie with a somewhat similar plot that actually has a plausible story that you can also get involved in and a character you can actually care about, rent duncan jones' ""moon"".

I didn't think Ms. Bullock's role was so powerful that it rate Best Actress but she certainly did a great job with the script.  I don't know how an astronaut might act in such a disaster but Mr. Clooney showed great strength in his part.  He was what pretty much enabled Ms. Bullock's character to continue on.

The main character finds herself lost in space with broken equipment, trying to find a way to survive. The director portrays a very vivid feeling of being very small in a vast place like space and what it would feel like to be alone, hopeless and afraid. You are continually hoping the hero will get rescued and each time she survies the latest situation, you think all is well and it never is since another obstacle is constant. There is a never-ending pull of emotion on what she will do next.
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that her surviving as many hurdles as she did and still making it home safely is unrealistic, but if she had died out in space, it would have been a let down and no one would like the movie as much. And the symbolism of being re-born again from the water at the end was  bit much for me.

5877334,3,B00DY64A3U,"GRAVITY is fine if you just take it for what it is: A sci-fi thriller that is watchably compelling, with a number of twists and turnabouts, but without a lot of plot depth, character development, or any of that sort of thing. It has a few stretches and improbabilities, but it's hard to make a film of this sort without some of those.

All the same, good performances by Bullock (Dr. Ryan Stone) and Clooney (""veteran astronaut"" Matt Kowalski), who are the only living characters we actually see here. Though the Earth below looks rather artificial, some nice use of gadgetry and special effects.

I put off watching GRAVITY because it looked fairly predictable. It does, however, go in some unexpected directions. Yet, the story starts a bit too late: More on the nature of the shuttle mission and the relationships between Stone, Kowalski, and the rest of the crew before the disasters strike would have added something even if it would also have complicated things. Purely a matter of taste, but I think the middle portions would have benefited from more on the angst and strange thoughts that arise while trapped alone in space and less of the constant thriller-diller stuff we have here.",1393804800,,1485,5.319148936170213

The plot is astronaut Dr. Ryan Stone's adventure to survive these hostile forces of nature and return to Earth.  Sandra Bullock carries through her role in fine fashion, allowing the audience to sympathize with her character, hoping for her survival.  Stone uses her wits, her training, her imagination and even her meager religious sensibility which helps fortify her, in the quest to survive.  There is sadness here too, for people have died unnecessarily because of Russia's ill-thought-out missile strike on her own satellite.  One death particularly is poignant, because it was chosen willingly by Dr. Stone's compatriot, fellow astronaut, Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), when the situation puts the weight of his own body (i.e., gravity) against the survival of Dr. Stone.

I just couldn't immerse myself in a story based on such an absurd premise with so many implausible elements. On top of that thin gruel, a couple characters I had trouble caring about. Great acting? I guess you watched a different movie. It seemed pretty two dimensional to me. There were moments as my wife and I were watching that we both just sighed and checked the clock.

I guess those satellites are just packed cheek to jowl out there, huh? One blows up and suddenly there's some massive field of shrapnel taking out everything? Why didn't Sandra and George look around in the shuttle for some more O2 before heading to the ISS? Maybe there was another groovy jetpack thing on board. Maybe the shuttle itself could still maneuver a bit. Apparently some ham radio operator can establish radio contact with an astronaut in trouble but NASA can't figure it out? I think that was the part that put me off the most - the ongoing radio silence. Did we have a whole host of telecommunication satellites during the 60s?

The film's stunning (yawn) conclusion: Sandra Bullock gets in a Chinese spacecraft (she doesn't speak Chinese) that is attached to a rapidly disintegrating space station that is plunging into the atmosphere. She begins randomly poking at buttons... and happily gets back to earth just fine and dandy!

Look, I understand that the heroine is entitled to a bit of good fortune and/or serendipity. It's a movie, after all. But it's got to be somewhere within the realm of possibility!

In order to activate the glasses one must bring the glasses less than two feet from the screen and hold the button until a message pops up on-screen telling me the glasses are connected.

That said, the glasses work well. It's not like Imax or anything like the big screen, but the 3D effect is excellent.

The movie is a metaphor about isolation, death and rebirth, some of it subtle  and some obvious , such as the moment when Stone is floating in the womb of an airlock with a floating cord positioned like an umbilical cord. The dramatic conflict of man out of his element and struggling to survive is in a great many scenes.

Those who found this boring are a mystery to me and those who quibble with the physics forget that this isn't a documentary, but a work of fiction. They apparently have no difficulty with a movie where a tornado picks up a house and puts it in the land of Oz, but here they are disturbed by momentum and inertia not being properly portrayed.

It's movie, and it tells a good story with a sound structure and beautiful images, and an underlying life affirming theme.

The several hours of Extras will be fascinating to effects buffs, as they show how the movie was shot and the many innovations in filming that made the long takes and convincing weightlessness possible.

5877370,4,B00DY64A3U,"Let's get straight to it. Gravity is a survival movie. I always enjoy these types of films.

It has the following:
Great visual effects. Unique story told almost entirely in the setting of space. Great suspense. It maintains what it is without crowding the movie with unneeded scenes prior to the real story (all floatin' and space and what not) beginning and ending.

It lacks the following:
A deep and complex story that leaves you pondering it after you watch it. Inaccuracies with physics of being in space. Only two characters and yet the characters lack depth and aren't developed well.

That's a survival movie. You shouldn't expect anything more from it or anything less. The Oscar buzz is well founded in regards to the eye candy and sound editing. But best picture? Best actress?

The effects are great, I'll give it that. The sound editing is pretty smart; it keeps you to keep interested for the 90+ minutes.
But picture and sound isn't a story.
The film lost me the moment they blame the Russian for the catalytic and mysterious explosion which drives the who drama. (Nice political statement Hollywood).
Ask yourself this when you watch it: Would the movie be just as interesting if it was Bruce Willis instead of Sandra Bullock?
What draws you in is the fact we are watching a woman deal and exceed in a man's job.  Secretly we watch the film believing the odd are against her because she's a woman and she's lost in space as an astronaut. But she manages to beat all the punches God throws at her. Oh, George Clooney is in the movie for about 5 minutes when he decides breaking a world record is more important than staying alive.  America seems to like these film where a single actor is stuck. We saw this with Tom Hanks when he was stuck on a rock in Castaway. We also saw this with James Franco when he was stuck in a rock in 127 Hours. Now we see it again, unfortunately with Sandra Bullock (who looks very much like Keaneu Reeves now) in Gravity.  The ending is ridiculous! The whole scene of her swimming to the shore, crawling like an amphibian, and then walking erect as Man's evolution is a total joke.

Sandra Bullock is intense here, and she looks lovely and in charge, as usual. However, this is a showcase for special effects and a spectacle set in space, nothing more. A better script would have helped to get viewers involved, but maybe the Oscars will sway people into losing common sense in terms of accurately criticizing this film. I happen to like films that are set in space (well, mostly ones that don't include aliens, but also don't mire us into outright boredom--as in the case of ""Apollo 13""--talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk), and ""Gravity"", for all of its 'turn the camera on and see what happens' approach, is pretty interesting visually, but so thin in plot and understanding of humanity that I wonder why everyone made the fuss that they did about such a simple premise. Maybe I needed to see it in 3D, but I doubt that I would change my opinion even so!
The DVD looks great and sounds great, and mine plays like a charm. I had no problem with the special features, or the overall presentation. Again, this is not science fiction storytelling, but as a drama, it works moderately well, with great special effects indeed but little else to recommend it despite the presence of Sandra.

If that's the case I would not be worrying about him pulling her down, but I would be worrying about the space station falling towards them, if that's how zero gravity works.

After that it was blah okay.

I raved about it to everyone I knew.

Over the next few months, I heard a lot of disappointment from friends and acquaintances. I was baffled. Some people said the movie was about her floating in space, and that there was no story. Excuse me? What? Did you actually watch the movie or were you on your phone?

I don't know. I have tended to notice that many of the people that hated Gravity tended to be the lowbrow crowd that have very fickle attention spans. While I don't consider Gravity to have been a highbrow movie, perhaps I was wrong. Also, maybe it wasn't very good in 2D? 3D made the movie completely unreal.

5877455,2,B00DY64A3U,"Sick & Stupid Score: 1/9*

This is one of the dumber movies I have seen.  Maybe there is something intelligent or interesting about watching characters bounce around in spacesuits from one disintegrating spacecraft to another, but maybe after you have seen one spacewalk and one spacecraft disintegrate you do not need to see the same things over and over.

There were some unintentionally funny parts, however, such as attempts at deep philosophy about life and death and the will to live recited by a delirious Sandra Bullock; or perhaps when the ghost of George Clooney miraculously appears like a deus ex machina to give Sandra a little uplifting advice.  But the funniest parts of all concern the helpless woman stereotype when Sandra tries to learn how to ""drive"" various spaceships made by various countries simply by quickly scanning the handy user's manuals.  But, hey, she is a ""doctor,"" like most females leads in movies for the last 20 years, so she is a quick study.

There were no sick scenes in the movie, unless you count seeing Sandra Bullock in her underwear twice.  If she were any older, those same scenes would probably have been too painful to watch.

All in all, this is a typical end-of-career movie for some top-billing actors.  This is where they usually end up, in a second-rate sci-fi full of special effects, simpleminded dialog, and no requirement for any acting ability.  After this, they usually play senile geezer roles.

5877459,3,B00DY64A3U,"Gravity's gotten quite a bit of buzz, much of which it deserves. The movie is about an astronaut (Sandra Bulloch) who gets stranded in space after debris from a satellite destroys her shuttle. More importantly, it's the story of human survival against all odds. The character has to struggle against dangers in space as well as her own personal demons, giving her a surprising amount of depth.

However, I read this book soon after I read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Martian-A-Novel/dp/0804139024/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Martian: A Novel</a>, and I couldn't help but draw comparisons, most of which don't work in Gravity's favor. Like Gravity, the Martian is a sci-fi thriller about a stranded astronaut. However, unlike that novel, Gravity sometimes plays fast and loose with the science. There are many scenes which work great in a visual medium but are utterly unrealistic (astronauts navigating through a rapidly approaching debris field on a ""Rocketeer style"" jetpack comes to mind). These ""Hollywood"" moments probably made the film a commercial success, but took me out of the film all too often.

For some reason instead of bouncing back they just stayed stretched out like there was a weight on the end of the line.

5877469,5,B00DY64A3U,"Gravity is, to me, one of the big surprises of the year.  Out of all the hyped up films this year or even this season, this movie was the one of ones I did not really care to see.  It looked slightly cool from the trailer, but I thought I could easily wait to see it on DVD.  However, as the film was coming out I saw all the reviews and positive feedback the film was getting.  Gravity has about a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes at the moment and reviewers I listen to on YouTube gave it really high marks.  So with this film doing so well critically I thought Id be remiss if I did not see this film in the theatre.  I will say that this film should definitely be seen in theatres or IMAX, or you will be missing out.  This film was a really pleasant surprise for me.  The film looks amazing, has characters you care for, it keeps you on the edge of your seat, and has a great atmosphere.

The story is as follows.  You have this group of astronauts headed by Matt (George Clooney) and Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) who are on a mission to make modifications on the Hubble Space Telescope.  However, mission control (played by Ed Harris) informs them that the Russians blew up one of their own satellites which caused a chain reaction which caused other satellites to go down and that the debris is heading right for them.  The shuttle gets hit and everyone dies except for Ryan and Matt.  Now these two have to survive and get back to Earth.

First of all, the film looks brilliant.  I just watched it in 2D, so I can only imagine how it looks in 3D.  I do not have a theatre around here that has 3D so I cannot watch it in that format.  I would think it would be pretty scary in 3D.  I heard the 3D is amazing so see the film in 3D if you can.  The CGI is great!  It actually feels like you are in space throughout the entire film.  You get many beautiful birds-eye-view shots of Earth.

The action you get is great as well and it keeps you on edge.  This film does an outstanding job at building suspense.  Literally every five minutes there is a suspenseful moment that keeps you on edge and it keeps that up until the very end of the film.  The audience barely gets a chance to breathe between all these dire situations Sandra Bullock is put through.

The characters are both likable and ones you easily get attached to.  You really feel sorry for Sandra Bullocks character.  Having to be in such a situation is very horrible and I liked how she dealt with it all.  Some may complain that she is to whiny in the beginning, but if anyone was put in that situation we would be just as frightened as she was if not more so.  This movie made me never want to go into space.

George Clooneys character is also very likable.  He is pretty much the voice of reason for Ryan and he helps her throughout the film.  He is also very laid-back and a bit funny as well which you welcome in a film like this.  I really like George Clooney as an actor.  He has done some film that I really do not like (Batman and Robin) but he also has done some movies I like this one.  Regardless of the movie he is in I always like him though.

Overall, Gravity is a must see film.  You definitely should see in on the big screen in 3D or IMAX if you can.  However, the film does work well in 2D as well.  The film is definitely a wild ride.",1393718400,4,3314,4.1171875

5877481,2,B00DY64A3U,"I was really looking forward to seeing this film. I have been waiting for months for Amazon to have it for rent (I stopped going to theaters decades ago - I prefer DVDs and my big screen at home). The premise is full of incredible opportunities for fantastic story-telling, and with actors the caliber of Bullock and Clooney, I was hoping for something really, really great.

Unfortunately, as usually happens with ""Hollyweird"" these days, I was very, very disappointed. It falls so far short of the possibilities, that it is almost not worth mentioning them.

First of all, for those who are calling this ""science fiction,"" it is not. It is an action/adventure film with a tiny bit of drama spread on top. Neither is it science fact, although the film isn't moving enough to make me research the accuracy of the effects or story details.

George Clooney has joined the ranks of Sean Connery, Michael Caine, and Cary Grant in being one of those actors who can raise the level of a movie simply by being there. Sandra Bullock has also proven she has the acting chops for any role they throw at her. To spend 90 minutes banging these actors around in space suits instead of having them investigate the intense emotional and existential questions this situation brings up is a huge waste of talent.

There are many things I could criticize about the writing, but that would make for too many spoilers. I will simply say that it is written, like most Hollywood films, for 8-10 year olds who like action and adrenalin rushes. There is little or no depth to the characters, no opportunities for deep, soul searching conversations as they face death, etc. The writing is plain, drab, and lifeless.

There are, however, several opportunities to see Bullock in very skimpy, underwear-like clothes, also very Hollywood-predictable for attracting young males. (Not that I mind that part very much, being male. Bullock has a very nice body and I certainly enjoyed looking. One such instance even offers an homage to an icon of science fiction movies, in a remarkably strange moment).

Why Hollywood seems to need to have women disrobe in all sorts of critical and dire circumstances is an interesting window on the emotional maturity of the Hollywood elite. Interesting also that women audience members were not given the same opportunity to enjoy Clooney in similar garb, which I know large numbers of women would certainly enjoy. I guess they only wanted to overstimulate young males. (Okay, and not so young ones, too.)

The cinematography and special effects were indeed very good, and the movie is worth seeing for that alone. Just don't go into this film thinking that you will see or hear anything deeply moving or insightful. If you approach it as a shallow action film, you won't be disappointed.

It is, however, very useful in pointing out how very primitive and fragile our current public space programs are - about like people paddling kayaks across the Pacific ocean - very little concern for the survival and/or rescue of the brave people we send on these missions. I think we could do far better by them.

We can certainly do better movies than this.

5877484,1,B00DY64A3U,"Where to start
If you watch this movie without any prior knowledge of how the laws of physics work you might enjoy this movie.
Given all the critical acclaim and audience support you would think that this thing is a absolute masterpiece.  After watching this movie the thought actually came into my mind that critics were paid to give this movie a good review.  I have to concede the visual effects in this movie were amazing and I'll give them that.  Except a person can't give it a pass just because it looks pretty.  The scientific inaccuracies and implausibilities were the things that really took me out of this movie.  You might say that this isn't suppose to be totally accurate, it's just a movie.  Yet the director had a person from NASA on the set to make sure they got the facts right.  The acting was another problem.  The writing horrendous.  They would never have sent up an astronaut that had crashed in the simulator every single time, or had psychology problems in her past that could impair their judgement and be a risk on the mission. It eventually turned into a comedy and not a thriller with the line ""ini mini miny mo"" when Ryan was pushing the buttons in the capsule at random.
Some people cheered in the theater when she made it but for me it was hard to relate with her struggle.  A lot of the bad situations she experienced were the result of her own doing.  Who ignores a fire in a room and floats right by, with the thought that it won't be a problem!?

My main issue is not that it's a terrible film but the fact that critics believe it's a masterpiece.  It is not.",1393718400,17,1595,4.384353741496598
5877485,3,B00DY64A3U,"The story line is thin, lacking emotional drama and creative originality. The creative highlight is using a fire extinguisher for jet propulsion, if that gives you any idea. Acting is seriously impaired by small compartments, unnatural physics, full-body space suits, and a dumbed-down script. George Clooney manages to sustain a continuous smirk whilst quipping inspirational gems, akin to: ""you can either stay here [and die in space] or go home! It's up to you [baby]"". In this performance he's a cross between Buzz Lightyear and Hawkeye Pierce. Sandra Bullock, mostly in monologue or voice-over sequences, is respectable and convincing. So kudos to her, especially in light of the limited opportunities for physical acting.

The cinematography is beautiful, though not exploited enough. Sound effects and special effects are both spectacular. I'm curious and conflicted about the zero-gravity effects which, while amazingly realistic, sometimes defy Newton's Laws to achieve a theatrical outcome.

The ending is anti-climactic and consistent with the rest of the film: unimaginative and implausible,  I don't expect money back nor much of a chance on Oscar night.",1393718400,8,1167,5.544943820224719
5877486,2,B00DY64A3U,"When I first saw the trailers for Gravity, it looked a lot like Open Water in space. In Open Water, a couple on a dive tour of the Great Barrier Reef was left behind accidentally by the tour operators. It was a close personal drama as they both slowly lost the will to survive and eventually succumbed to the sea. There was always hope that they would be rescued, but it was slim.

The scenario in Gravity in reality is even more hopeless. Where the couple in Open Water survived for two days, the maximum amount of time that a pair of astronauts could survive on their own after the loss of a shuttle in orbit is about 8 hours with a 90 minute reserve before all life support was exhausted. While another shuttle if it was ready to go might be able to get into the right orbital plane, they would probably not be able to chase down and rendezvous with the stranded astronauts in time.

With that in mind, I knew movie was going to either be a really close drama with wonderful actors or something extraordinarily stupid. After watching the trailer a couple of more times, it was pretty clear that extraordinarily stupid was the most likely course. The movie did not disappoint. After showing us 20 minutes of unqualified and mentally unfit astronauts doing dangerous things that no astronaut would do on a spacewalk, the movie delivers a Michael Bay style nonstop action ride that is based on a paranoid space fantasy about the orbital debris problem run amok.

Alfonso Curon has joined the ranks of other storytellers that think the science in science fiction is completely optional if it could interfere with the storytelling in anyway. Without the science, Gravity is nothing more than a space fantasy dressed in the borrowed skin of reality.  I mention this because throughout the extras on the Blu-ray, I heard one thing commonly from all departments involved from the actors to the CGI artists was that they were working toward ""honoring the reality. Well, if they were really ""honoring the reality, then they all should have walked off the project in protest.

I don't give it one star, because the art department did a wonderful job and made some serious advances in CGI which opens the door for potentially better movies. The movie is beautiful, but is nowhere near worthy of the critical accolades it seems to be receiving as any deeper meaning is lost in the crashing of metal on metal.",1393718400,11,2398,4.659574468085107

5877495,2,B00DY64A3U,"The movie opens with astronauts space walking outside their space shuttle to repair a satellite. Actually, Stone (Bullock) the scientist is working while Kowalski (Clooney) is wisecracking and looping around, inexplicably squandering the precious resource of his propellant. They receive a warning of an approaching cloud of debris which can shred them, so they dawdle around a little more.

Not that it matters because said debris severely damages their ship and kills the rest of their crew. As luck would have it, there are two space stations close by, so Kowalski attaches a tether to Stone and sets sail for the closer of the two. Having wasted his propellant, its a predictable close call, with Stone exhausting her air supply. They clang and grab, clang and grab, clang and grab at the station, a scene that will be repeated ad nauseum throughout the movie. Stone latches onto the last possible hold on the station, naturally, with Kowalski barely in tow. He claims the force of his inertia (no movement and weightlessness  what force?) will pull them both off and inexplicably sacrifices himself by releasing the tether, instructing her to make her way to the air lock. Shes out of air, but pauses a protracted period to gaze around and contemplate before doing so.

Once inside, she immediately sheds her spacesuit to reveal her clingy tank top and short shorts. The entire astronaut contingent  are clad in elaborate temperature control suits under their spacesuits but shes dressed as though a splashdown at Venice Beach is a probability. This extended scene will be repeated, revealing the puerile mentality of the movie. You have a sheet of metal between you and an airless and heat-free environment and you cant wait to shed your protective gear at every opportunity. Really?

The clang & grab and stripping cycle will be repeated as she makes her way to the conveniently located Chinese and final space station. It also gets damaged by space debris but she still manages to pilot this unfamiliar machinery into a perfect splashdown.

They could have expanded the role of ED HARRIS's and scenes of mission control.  And the stupid plot line of killing off/ stranding Clooney's character right off the bat.  I watched it expecting to see a Clooney, Harris and Bullock Syfy space adventure, instead, another run of the mill lame movie with Bullock phoning in her performance and lines.

5877500,4,B00DY64A3U,"As cliche as it might sound Gravity at it's very best truly is like a rollercoaster ride. It's an experience that doesn't ask you to think about what's going on as much as it demands you to experience what's going on.  Pretty much from the word go,this film just starts building and stacking on tension and it just doesn't stop. It keeps coming at you from every which direction and before you know it the rides over and you want to jump back in line to get on it again.
For that very same reason though I can understand why some people won't like this film. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney both put on great performances but this isn't really a movie about an amazing ensemble cast,or a political,or social issue that will spark up a debate or thought provoking idea after you're done watching it. I would even argue this isn't a movie strictly about it's visuals. It's simply a visceral,and vicarious experience of surviving. So in that sense it kind of does leave you wondering what was the whole point by the films conclusion,but for me it's  something to watch simply for the spectacle,for the ride.

the 3D is very solid and the movie as a whole looks pretty amazing. Their are a few really nice pop out effects but i feel the best 3D scenes showcase the depth of outer space. As you're watching in certain moments the astronauts grow smaller as they float out into the endless darkness and you can really feel the depth in those scenes. I can't help but wonder if watching this in 2D for the first time would take away that feeling or not. To me the only shortcoming for this bluray 3D release is that it's not an IMAX 3D bluray which I felt would have been a much better showcase for this film. Had that been the case I think this would have been worthy of fives stars across the board.

Clooney's character would be more suited to a Las Vegas Casino rather than piloting a space craft. The hokey country music playing throughout the film added to the cornball feel of the movie.  I'm very surprised by the high reviews this movie gets and I don't know if I'm missing something but I found very few redeeming qualities to this movie.

5877547,2,B00DY64A3U,"There could be some slight spoilers here....so read at your own risk.

I will say up front that this movie was beautifully shot, and the scenery it provided was very nice.  However, story wise, this movie left a lot to be desired.  With all the attention this movie has received, I was expecting so much more.  This movie was only 90 minutes long(including credits), but given so much attention was given to the look of this film, I felt it would have been much better served to add a good 30 minutes to the film, and add a bit more depth to the story.

We never really got to know any of the characters.  There was no back story as to who these character were, why they were in space, and the aftermath of the ordeal.  The story picks up with them already in space...and withing a few minutes, a major situation occurs that has characters fighting for survival...and the ending just felt like a cop out.  Honestly, I felt after watching this movie that I missed the first 30 minutes of the film, and the last 15 minutes of the film.  The beginning of the movie should have started on Earth, with introducing the actual characters, who they were, and the mission they were involved in.  It's hard to feel too much compassion for the situation the characters were in when you feel like you have no idea who the characters are.  And the ending of the film should have give us a satisfying conclusion to all the work it took to get home...instead of simply cutting it off when it did.

I'll be honest with you, there was really no story at all in this movie.  I'm sure we could find some middle school kids to come up with a story with more depth than this film.  It seems that ALL the attention put into this film was for the look of the film.  I'll admit that it looked nice...but it takes more than good looks to make a good film.  And this film was seriously lacking anything of substance.  I'm frankly shocked that this movie received as much attention as it did.  I would have no problem is this film won some awards for the cinematography....but other than that; there was nothing.  Very disappointing.",1393632000,4,2106,4.395348837209302

5877552,3,B00DY64A3U,"Have you noticed that many years feature two films which are fraternal twins?  The Sandra Bullock vehicle ""Gravity"" is surprisingly similar to Robert Redford's film ""All is Lost.""  Both films feature a protagonist engaged in a crushingly lonely battle for survival against the elements... or in Bullock's case, against the vacuum of space.

The first impression most viewers make is: ""The cinematography is excellent!""  That's true; this film should be seen on a big screen, in Blu-Ray format.  An army of technicians really made each frame a feast for the eyes.  But every time I hear a viewer say ""It looks great!"" first, I suspect the ""Tin Man Syndrome:""  It doesn't have a heart.

No heart?  But it's dutifully weepy!  We are reminded that Bullock's character had a small child who died tragically.  A small, logical voice in the back of our head whispers:  ""Why would NASA send up someone with such profound psychological scars?""  Moreover, it's a bit annoying that she's little more than payload, insofar as she has little knowledge of how anything works in her orbital habitat.

The movie's pacing screeches to a halt at its midpoint too.  The film's Latin director has a long scene invoking allusions to the ""magical realism"" of many Latin American novels.  As in the novels, the protagonist carries on a rather matter-of-fact conversation with the dead.  It works in books, but it sucks the energy out of the film faster than the vacuum of space.

I also suspect that I am not the only viewer who is disquieted by the graphic depiction of a destroyed space shuttle and crew.  We already have two true tragedies to reflect on, as well as the loss of national prestige in the abandonment of the entire program with no successor in sight.

5877579,2,B00DY64A3U,"Most of the 5 STAR REVIEWS for this film  and many ""Hollywood Hype"" films just have to be film industry ""plants"".  Placed here as free, self-serving advertisements in the hype-machinery.

I felt guilty for not liking this one ....at first, but now....after reading many of the reviews giving low marks too, I feel justified. Nothing here deserves 5 stars or awards except the CGI and cinematography, which are stunning.

Oh and let's give Ms. Bullock kudos for staying physically fit at age 50...unless that was CGI assisted too.  You be the judge but she did look a bit like an air-brushed, photo-shopped Playboy magazine cover as she slipped out of her space-suit for the first time.

I couldn't quite put my finger on why I was left disappointed, but now I can.  Just read the reviews with 1-3 stars.  Those are REAL and the vast majority are well stated.  No point in my reiterating them.

5877584,5,B00DY64A3U,"Or Sandra Bullock's performance.  The first time I saw it in 3-D and was engaged to the point of near motion sickness.  The second time, I saw it in just ""normal-D"" and had invited a group of my friends to see it.  I looked down the row to see their open mouths and one friend said she was afraid she had kicked the head of the man in front of her several times.
For those who did NOT find this ""exciting"" enough.... all I can say is perhaps some further ""look within"" time is needed.  No this in not ""gross science fiction"" where aliens explode from bodies and the screen becomes all gory.  This is about human survival, and it centers on a person who doesn't feel much like surviving anymore.  Sandra Bullock has never been better; she is literally stripped of  her usual talents which are beauty, humor, and  natural charisma, to a short haired, sans make-up, lost and wounded soul, who might be any of us if we were rocket scientist intelligent.  Considering much of this movie had to be shot ""green screen"", it would be difficult to manifest the emotions both she and George Clooney displayed. This simple story, against the most gorgeous use of photography of our planet I have ever seen, (and it is breathtaking)... all I can say is, watch it again.  This was my favorite movie of 2013 hands down and all the Oscars which come its way are well deserved. George Clooney is perfect as the wise-assed , easy come, easy go, fellow who does return from death to give some needed spiritual coaching.  I hope GRAVITY wins it all.  It should.

Big props to Bullock in carrying the weight of an entire movie virtually her own, as Clooney's character bows out early on (granted the special effects gave her a wee bit of help).

The end initially left me a little baffled, as it seemed to be incomplete.  But in mulling it over it was a good and proper ending in that it completed the characters' journey to survive both the space tragedy and an earlier personal tragedy, and it was a pretty good counterpoint to the most poignant part of the movie, where Bullock's character had resigned herself to her fate.",1393632000,2,677,4.578512396694215

As science fiction, which I like very much, the circumstances are plausible. The story does not compare with the movie ""2004"" in which the story involving HAL still make me feel full of emotion, for good reason as it turns out. I wanted this movie to have that kind of emotion too.
I am very knowledgeable about space medicine and fairly so regarding space flight beginning with Alan Shepherd.
I did buy a DVD of this movie so that I could try watching it again to see if I could capture the amazement about the detail and the empathy many felt for the two characters.",1393632000,2,786,4.581560283687943

Don't they go thru 6 to 12 months of training that prepares them for every situation?  Don't they do psychological background checks?  Really, would NASA have allowed someone as detached from reality as the main character on a space mission where you have to follow orders/rules or people die?

The action is gripping, the suspense nonstop and the cinematography, whether made by computer, or camera, is just heart-stopping in it's beauty. With Sandra Bullock playing Stone with characteristic finesse you have a film that will generate hundred's of millions in revenue and a lot of derivative film making. In short, it is a classic, in the way that ""Gone With The Wind,"" ""Forest Gump,"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" were in their day. Go see it now.

5877594,2,B00DY64A3U,"I started this movie with high hopes and finished it very disappointed. The only great thing about Gravity is the cinematography which was beautiful and reminded me of how much I love space. The CGI was very realistic, and I know that it was probably even better on a huge IMAX screen. However, this movie doesn't have anything else going for it especially on a regular television screen.

I guess I'm old school because I think a movie should have story development or at the very least a character that I can root for and this movie has neither. I didn't know anything about the two characters that made me feel like I should invest my feelings into them, (sorry to say that Bullocks glossed over backstory wasn't enough for me). Heck, they didn't even know anything about each other which seemed very unrealistic. Example: At one point while they are trying to survive, clooney begins asking her questions like where she is from or if she has family to keep her focused. Those are two of the most basic things to ask someone when first meeting them let alone working with them in space for who knows how long. Simply put, the dialogue seemed to be used as a filler between action sequences and nothing more.  Furthermore, Bullocks character is supposed to be the one that you cheer for. This was not the case. I found her character to be extremely annoying and under-trained. She continually makes mistakes that I can't see any qualified astronaut making. Instead of rooting for her, I ended up betting on what she would do next that would jeopardize her life. It was irritatingly predictable, [spoiler] especially the part where she opens the door at the end and almost drowns.

As my mom said, ""the only thing she did the whole time was grunt."" I used to love Sandra Bullock, but if I hear her voice again it will be too soon. Her grunting/screaming/whining in Gravity was like nails on a chalkboard..I don't understand why this movie has so many outstanding reviews.. 1998's Armageddon is 16 years behind on visuals, but it is still a far superior and more BELIEVABLE movie than Gravity.

With that said, if you watch movies simply for cinematography and action (and don't mind two dimensional characters and little plot development) then you will probably love this film.",1393632000,16,2278,4.71608040201005
5877595,1,B00DY64A3U,"For a two-actor movie, this one is poor. Full disclosure - I'm not a great fan of either George Clooney or Sandra Bullock.

It strains the imagination that NASA would ever select two characters as inappropriate as the two portrayed in this film for a mission to the International Space Station. Bullock, as in her other films, is constantly on the verge of hysteria, and Clooney's semi-comic response, while an appropriate response to Bullock's character, is unimaginable as a portrayal of NASA personnel response to a crisis in space.

My wife and I agree on this one. Two thumbs down.",1393632000,13,586,4.85

It should sweep all the technical awards, but shocked it was nominated for Best Picture, Best Score and Best Actress (Sandra Bullock), to name a few.  At least one of her lines in ""Gravity"" is identical to the movie ""Speed"" (starring Keanu Reeves).

This was a fun movie and the special effects were fabulous, but that's about it.  Not worthy of a Best Picture nomination, let alone a Best Picture win and while I am a huge fan of Sandra Bullock, there was nothing super spectacular about her role or acting in this movie!

5877602,2,B00DY64A3U,"I really don't understand why this movie has been nominated for Best Picture and that so many people are predicting it to win.
I'm giving it two stars for the visuals, but apart from cinematography and special effects, shouldn't there have to be some plot development, interesting characters, and brilliant acting to be a contender for Best Picture?

I didn't find anything engaging about watching Sandra Bullock get knocked around by space debris, breath heavily, grunt, and mutter to herself for ... what, 1 hour and 10 minutes...

***Spoiler Alert***
The only other character in this movie is Clooney, who only lasts for about the first 20 minutes - maybe even less time. The ""witty repartee"", both real and imaginary, between Bullock and Clooney's character is contrived and stale but at least there is some interaction with another being. After he is done away with, there's nothing but Bullock and her desperate ravings and conversations with imaginary voices. She never sees or talks to another human being (or even a wild animal or friendly basketball) again. Did they spend so much on technical effects that they had nothing left to pay for some other actors?

I'm not going to comment on scientific realism since there are so many people who are far better qualified to do so, but there should be at least a little nod to reality. How can someone who's been slamming into objects and fighting for survival for days emerge completely unscathed with hair and makeup intact?

Apparently to compensate for the lack of inherent feeling in the script, the movie is drenched in over-the-top music (which, after a while, grinds the viewer down). ""Here's where you should really feel engaged"" is what the most dynamic parts of the score seem to be screaming at us. The problem is, almost all of the music is too dynamic and overdriven. It's too much.

No matter how stunning the whizz-bang effects are, they cannot (and certainly do not) draw the viewer in to the humanity and relatability of the characters. This movie, if the sound is muted, looks convincingly like actual space footage released by NASA. If you'd enjoy ninety minutes of that, you'll enjoy this film.

There were sections in Gravity that I felt compelled to fast-forward through. They were that dull; they dragged that much. One scene in the film seems to depend on racial stereotyping.",1393632000,6,998,4.934523809523809

5877657,5,B00DY64A3U,"Some films (Castaway, 127 Hours) have a simple premise, a basic tale of survival, devoid of large casts and complicated plotlines.  Co-written with his son Jons Cuarn, director and co-writer Alfonso Cuarn (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Y Tu Mam Tambin) has combined state of the art technology and remarkable acting by Sandra Bullock in a spectacular, tension-filled adventure, Gravity.

American astronauts Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), work on repairs to the Hubble space telescope as news of a nearby Russian satellite explosion is reported.  The quiet serenity is suddenly displaced by hurtling debris that decimates the repair mission and causes great damage to the telescope and more.  Caught up in a life threatening disaster and stranded in space without any hope of rescue, the two must improvise and utilize survival skills to survive under impossible circumstances.  As hope fades and oxygen running low, the astronauts must make difficult choices to make it home alive.

Caurn successfully conveys the emptiness and vastness of space and how isolated it can be.  What is remarkable is that this film could not have been made so convincingly until now because of recent technological developments.  Even director James Cameron (Avatar), who was consulted early on, championed the films ambitions for space realism that was years in the making.  A ground breaking achievement in visual effects, not since Stanley Kubricks 2001: A Space Odyssey or Apollo 13 has a film so realistically depicted space travel.  Even the realistic use of sound or lack of it enhances the authenticity.  Great care and research obviously went into the production.

The film boldly starts with a continuous panning shot for thirteen minutes with nary a cut.  When was the last time a major Hollywood film did that?  There are some remarkable shots in space like the one instance where Bullock is in a womb-like position which acts as a metaphor of life.  Gravity deserves to be seen in 3D (perhaps the best 3D film since Avatar) which opens up the magnitude of the visual effects.  When did any 3D film show a persons tears?  This one does.  The realism and emptiness of space will be hard to match so convincingly in future films.

Cuarn establishes a basic premise and creates a major conflict while continually upping the ante of impending danger.  The suspense is palpable as we feel as if we are there with Bullock and must figure a way to first get out of harms way and then to go home to earth.  The one film this reminds you of is Marooned.

This is Bullocks (The Blind Side) show all the way as you feel her fears amid every threat; she is in virtually every shot.  We learn to understand her feelings and get a glimpse into her past about her regrets in life.  Paradoxically, space becomes a place to escape her past or prove to be her death.  One major theme for her character is learning to let go whether it be a painful past memory or letting go of something in the here and now.  Its about finding a reason to live and finding a deeply personal redemption under the most trying circumstances.

Clooney lends strong support as her veteran colleague and voice of reason who offers instructions and calm amid tragedy.  You will never guess who voices mission control, but heres a hint- see Apollo 13.

Sure, despite convenient coincidences that facilitate some plot points and a couple situations that are a bit hard to believe, Bullock sells it with her conviction and desperation; you buy into the situation regardless even if it may be hallucination or a dream.
What should be noteworthy is the fact that Gravity is rated PG in an era when PG13 and R rated major releases dominate the marketplace.  And it runs a lean 90 minutes.  How such a simple tale of survival and hope becomes not only totally engaging but such a compelling, landmark work of cinema is the lasting legacy of Gravity.",1393545600,,3938,4.824143070044709
5877658,3,B00DY64A3U,Movie looks great. but just not an interesting story. acting i guess is present. basically sandra bullock just breathing heavy and talking to herself.

5877660,5,B00DY64A3U,"I was just absolutely astounded by the power of this movie.  You need the 3-D feature to fully appreciate the stunning visuals; and 3-D is not used as a gimmick here...with only two developed characters, the film relies heavily on the visuals of deep space. In a recent press conference, the director (and co-producer and writer) Alfonso Cuaron, was subjected to the usual inane questions from the press; one of which - especially idiotic - was a query about the difficulties of filming in deep space... Cuaron is forging quite a reputation in filmdom, with the fine films, ""Children of Men"" and ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" (arguably the best of the Harry Potter films) in his resume. This is by far his best effort though; and I would expect to see this movie - as a minimum - nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. While 3-D is de riguer for the visuals, you do not need it to appreciate the commanding and masterful performance by Sandra Bullock. Bullock is such a fine comic actress that she does not often get serious roles like this...and it is a pity. When she does get them - like in ""Blindside"" - she has excelled; and I feel certain she will get at least a Best Actress nomination for this superb effort. Bullock plays a mission specialist on her first space mission; the other developed character is the mission commander, played by George Clooney, who also does a fine job. The film is also technically accurate for the most part, even receiving praise from space veterans and you will not have to suspend your belief system to appreciate the story as it is one that could conceivably happen. The sound editing is also another plus...I have nothing but praise for this effort and give it my highest recommendation.",1393545600,7,1717,4.666666666666667

They're like you and me. They're just doing their jobs when incredible circumstances unfold and they have to deal with challenges.

3D is really the only way to see this with many vertigo inducing POV shots and amazing scenes of the earth below. That was the one thing that really hit me visually was just the scale of everything in comparison to the fragile human beings floating about and is something I had never felt with a 2D movie.

5877685,2,B00DY64A3U,"Gravity(released Aug/13),stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. With the unprecedented super hype and press push by both its stars,and it's endless comparison's to other past Sci-Fi films,in particular 2001:A Space Odyssey,you would have thought this was a film for the ages! Let's clear something up,shall we? Firstly,this film does not come anywhere close to the epic classic that was 2001,in plot nor style. Secondly,it is a simple and mundane film that I am sure looked impressive in 3D and on the big screen. An honest to goodness good picture however,especially one made in 3D, has to have some substance to it. It must strike a balance between a good and decent story and it's eye popping visuals. This one is just too long on S/FX ,coming up far too short on its delivery. It's a terrible waste of two good actors who mostly,it looks like,did their things in front of blue screens,hanging off wires.
The story finds Clooney and Bullock as two astronauts outside a space shuttle orbiting the earth. Bullock is concentrating on getting a communications array up and going,while Clooney is playing cowboy by doing mini orbits in his space suit around the shuttle. Suddenly they receive a warning to abort the mission. It seems the Ruskies have shot down one of their own satellites and the subsequent debris has had a domino effect. It is slowly but surely taking out  the majority of other satellites orbiting the earth. Before they can re enter the space shuttle,huge debris hits them,destroying the shuttle and killing the rest of the crew. The only two left alive are Clooney and Bullock,after a hairy rescue of Bullock by Clooney.
The two's only hope of survival is to reach the International Space Station,which has been abandoned due to the dangerous debris. Clooney gets a bead on it and they head for it. As they approach Clooney has no more propellant left in his suit to break with,and the two tumble over and around the station. When their tow line breaks it is Bullock that now rescues Clooney. Bullock has a tenuous hold on Clooney who tells  her to let him go lest they both perish. When she refuses,he unbuckles his line and puts himself adrift.
Inside the space station all isn't good. After a while the station catches fire. Bullock escapes into the only life pod left,which cannot make it back to earth because of damage to the outside. Inside the capsule she fires it up,but cannot escape the station as it is tangled in its' already deployed chute,which in turn is tangled in the station. This forces her to do a space walk to untangle the lines. As she does this, more dangerous debris comes her way smashing the station to bits.
Back inside the pod but free of the station, she drifts hopelessly. She manages to pick up a signal from an Eskimo on the ground,and they briefly talk as her craft flies far over his head,until she goes out of both their ranges. She then turns off her oxygen and prepares to die. In a dream she imagines Clooney is back aboard the pod. He tells her she must use the landing jets to get the craft to the Chinese space station and save herself. She wakes up and it gives her the strength to carry on and get herself to the station.
The Chinese station has also been hit and its orbit has deteriorated so much it is falling downwards,already hitting the earth's atmosphere. She gets inside,manages to jettison away from the station and eventually lands in a lake back on good old terra firma. Not thinking ,she blows the hatch and the capsule starts filling with water. It sinks to the bottom and Bullock tries swimming upwards but the weight of her suit keeps her down. She gets out of it and finally surfaces,drifting to land. It takes her a bit to adjust, but in short order she is walking on her two feet. Fade to black.
The film seems like the present but can't be, the reality is all shuttle missions have been scrubbed. After one gets over the panorama of the earth and their surroundings,you would think the film would pick up momentum and get some decent traction. But for me at least,it never even takes off. The director has not imbued these characters with anything that I can personally empathize with. As distant as they are from the ground,is the same way I feel about the film. It's cold and impersonal. As is the music that accompanies this picture,which detracts more than enhances. Clooney's smiling,devil may care character is just far too cool for school. When Bullock is trying to emote some fear,Clooney,either in off screen voice or in front of the camera, acts like her personal psychologist,telling her its all ok,and to calm herself. It just doesn't sit right. And you JUST knew at least one of them was going to make it back alive. I mean what kind of a film would it have been if they had both died......hmm,maybe better? Finally the film's biggest premise is just not,to me,believable. I couldn't swallow that the two were able to go ""station hopping"" as it were. Their shuttle gets destroyed,oh I know lets just go over to the ISS,which happens not to be too far away. When that goes chest up,ok let's just go to the Chinese Space station,right over there. It is far,far too convenient and totally unbelievable. Which further deep sixes this picture.
Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. The DVD doesn't have the extras the Blue Ray has(that's the big boys pushing we the consumers in the direction(s)they want),it has only a short film. The film is part of the picture. It's the viewpoint of the Eskimo Bullock talks to.
All in all a BIG disappointment. The film was NOT 1/10th of the hype they would have you believe it was. And it is certainly not a film you could watch over and over again.

This is the most intense scene in the film and probably one of the most in cinematic history.  It's a tall order for any film to maintain that level of tension and director Alfonso Cuaron should be given props for trying.  The majority of the film is devoted to astronauts Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) trying to get back to Earth from the deadly abyss that is outer space and in an economical ninety minutes the film maintains your interest.  The film is served by Bullock's turn as a woman who acts bravely in the face of peril which is reminiscent of Tom Hanks' work in ""Castaway"".  Little has been said about Clooney's work as the wisecracking astronaut who chooses levity when confronting almost certain death but he is terrific.  The film doesn't break any artistic ground but by advancing the technology of cinema through sight and sound it is a wholehearted success.",1393545600,,1115,4.78125

5877701,1,B00DY64A3U,"NO SPOILER GUARANTEE

This is a survival movie.  You know that in the first 5 minutes when only Clooney and Bullock are left alive.  I was so sure that we would enjoy this movie, being a fan of both Clooney and Bullock (who isn't?) that I did not mind actually buying the movie through Amazon when the rental was not available.  But I was wincing in pain most of the movie.  I certainly wanted Bullock to survive, but she is panicky and whining through most of the movie.  This seems a great insult to female astronauts and the NASA training program.  There is no sign of the stoic ""Houston, we have a problem.""  Clooney remains calm in a Han Solo grinning way which only adds to the insult to women.  Bullock is allowed to panic and cry and freeze up in a way that would be completely unacceptable for a male astronaut.  Sure, bullock is supposed to be the scientist, but do you think female scientists are incapable of staying calm under pressure and following their training?  In a movie asserting itself to be so realistic, this seems fatally unrealistic.  We see more bravery from Bullock as an average citizen in the movie Speed (good movie).

The next fatal flaw is in how they eliminate Clooney.  This movie tries so hard to be realistic that it eliminates sound in all the space crashing scenes, which of course is correct because space cannot transmit sound (But this lack of sound reduces the drama).  Then in one of the most pivotal scenes, Bullock holds onto Clooney who was drifting away with a cord.  The drift (not a fall) is arrested at the last minute, but Clooney exclaims that the cord will not hold.  Hold what?  The momentum that he had was stopped.  There is no force pulling on him at this point.  Well, actually there is, gravity, but the way gravity would work in space would be to pull him slightly toward Bullock and the rest of the debris.  Instead the movie plays it like two rock climbers on one rope and the guy at the bottom cuts the cord to save the other (See Day After Tomorrow or Vertical Limit - both excellent movies). So they wanted to create a situation where Bullock would be left alone.  But this situation is contrived in a way that suggest the characters and the movie makers no nothing about GRAVITY!

Other annoying mistakes is that Bullock would not know that when she uses the fire extinguisher that there would be an equal and opposite reaction sending her flying and almost killing herself.  This is used as foreshadowing where she takes this knowledge to use the extinguisher to fly her to safety.  But are we expected to believe that she never received training on how a fire extinguisher works in space.  She make several of these kinds of mistakes which suggest she is either the worst astronaut in history, or that NASA apparently does not train very well, or most insulting, women somehow cannot retain their training.  Then we are expected to believe that such a rookie has no problem figuring out another country's complicated space systems by referring quickly to a manual.

Every science fiction movie takes liberties with the way the physical world really works, but this movie is painful because it is basically trying to base its reputation on its realism.  The special effects are impressive, but I would not agree that we are in new territory.  And the story itself has such flaws that I really did not much care if Bullock's character lived or died by the end (and I love Bullock).  I think the academy award should go to the marketing department for this movie which sold the actors and the special effects so well that the story became irrelevant.  This movie will not survive the ages.",1393545600,23,3655,4.592592592592593

Up to this point Bullock is a pathetic, six month trained neophyte tethered to Clooney. However, once this umbilical is cut and Clooney, a NASA veteran perishes,Bullock becomes Alan Shepherd and Neil Armstrong rolled into one. When she does get stumped, Clooney comes back to help her in a dream while she is attempting suicide by turning off her air. This Deus ex Cloonea robs the movie of  its integrity and reduces it to a farce. She also masters Chinese and Russian in an eye blink and the piloting of two foreign spacecraft by looking at their manual for a few minutes after once again avoiding millions of bits and chunks of debris even when it destroys both the Russian and Chinese stations but does not even dent, fantastically, her escape pod which she rides down to earth through thousands of degrees of re entry heat amid thousands of pieces of  luckily parallel debris.

The acting is top-notch. Bullock and Clooney really do a phenomenal job, especially considering how the movie was filmed.

The plot is also great. It's minimalistic, but moving. Some people may consider this a bad thing, preferring a shoehorned love story or something, but this film isn't just another generic Hollywood production. It's simply an emotional survival story, which carries with it some deep themes.

Some people seem to get bogged down with technical inaccuracies or disagree with certain directions the plot goes. To them, I say that you've missed the very essence of the movie. There's no reason to nitpick things for being unrealistic in what is one of the most realistic sci-fi movies out there. If you want pure realism, watch a documentary or NASA footage. More importantly, though, liberties are taken for the purposes of advancing the plot and creating emotion.

5877754,5,B00DY64A3U,"I was totally unprepared for this movie, having not even a clue what it was about. I only knew that Sandra Bullock starred in it, and she is a favorite actress of mine. In addition, I ventured to see this movie alone and was immediately drawn into it.

I won't repeat the details of the movie, as others have done that, it is visually beautiful, so well-crafted that I was made to feel I was truly in outer space looking at home- the little blue planet- far away.  As the crisis begins in outer space, Sandra Bullock as astronaut Dr. Ryan Stone, is thrown into a catastrophic and almost insurmountable situation in which minute by minute, she is confronted with death and at the same time must make a choice whether to fight to live or not.

Gravity, is an apt title. Not only for the Gravity of the situation, but also for all that pulls at her and the choices as to what to hang on to and what to let go of in order to survive. There is that moment she is confronted with letting go of her friend and fellow astronaut, and that departure was painful to watch.  Your heart skips a beat as subconsciously our minds wanders at the thought of letting go of a loved one in real life, a parent, a dear friend, a child, a pet. We are often forced to let go when we don't want to. The guilt that often ensues from having survived. The internal anger for not being able to protect and rescue those we care for and love.

This is an emotional movie. The 3D portion of it being played out in our conscious and subconscious mind. I believe that to truly appreciate Gravity, one must be a little broken, having experienced the ups and downs of life.  A parent whose child has died, a cancer patient struggling to live or perhaps wanting to give up, the lonely and desperate, the heartbroken.

It is quite brilliant of the filmmakers that Dr. Ryans challenge takes place in the solitude and silence of space, with no one to help her but herself, for don't we all, in one way or another, live in the solitude of our minds? The space suit and space craft are both her life-line and what could be her death trap. Trapped is what she is. Trapped is what many people feel, with no easy way out, until a person explodes with a greater desire to break free. We can relate to her panic and running out of oxygen. We know that a sudden crisis changes a persons entire breathing pattern, and a person literally cant breathe as they suffocate on emotional pain and grief.

When she hallucinates that her, by then deceased, astronaut companion Matt, has returned to her, he is faintly reminiscent of God encouraging her. She plunges from deep space and crashes on earth, the rebirth of water, and its true that sometimes it takes a second fall, a crisis and hitting bottom to affirm our deepest desire to not just be alive, running through the motions, but to truly Live.

This movie is a Jungian masterpiece at every level.

Sandra Bullocks performance, magnificent. The writers, producers, director, the entire team created a masterpiece.

This movie will remain in my permanent collection along with Gone With The Wind, Titanic and Cold Mountain.

5877755,4,B00DY64A3U,"From the PR we knew to expect something big, and for quite a bit of this film, that was not an under statement. Holy Moly! My heart was in my mouth, I could feel my heart beating a mile a minute.

The film directed by Alfonso Cuarn's is so incredibly exciting, that I could speak superlatives all night. And, for most of the film it got me. There were a few moments near the end that the un believability factor kicked in, but OK. I have not seen anything so visually stunning. The sight of George Clooney and Sandra Bullock floating haphazardly through space hitting objects and each other. George losing his tether and then separating, all of this seemed real.

What seemed iffy to me is that Mission Specialist Ryan Stone had only 6 months of training before she went into space. It takes years and years of training, they missed the mark with that piece. However, off they are,something from another space vehicle went all wrong and debris in space was wrecking havoc. This is very believable. A woman with six months training going through all of the tactics and manning the ships, no, not realistic. This is a space thriller, and it works in most aspects. I am a very concrete kind of person, and so the unbelievable is a big deal to me.

Sandra Bullock gave a bravura performance, and if the rest of the competition was not as good as it is, maybe an Academy Award would have been hers. George Clooney for the short amount of time he was there was credible. But, as has been said, he would prefer to float in space than hang around a woman his age. The special effects are spectacular, and deserves every award to come down the pike. See this film and eat this all up. While I was watching, I wondered how the astronauts and their families thought of this film. It could happen, our astronauts could be lost in space. A film to remember.

5877758,2,B00DY64A3U,"I almost bought this film on Blue-Ray.  Thank God I only rented it for $4 on Amazon.  The dialogue was sophomoric, the acting mediocre at best, and the situations implausible and silly.  Both characters weren't even well-developed to hold our interest and the background info on Sandra Bullock's daughter was just a distraction to provide some insight into her character.  I still didn't understand what her strength was.  The dream sequence with George Clooney was awful as well, kick starting her into action.  The only good thing to say about Gravity is the special effects were decent but in my opinion, not better than 2001 (a 60's movie) with a more profound message.  The audio was impressive, but if you expected plot or drama in space, look elsewhere.  I would not recommend this movie.",1393459200,3,795,4.880597014925373
5877759,3,B00DY64A3U,"The visual effects are Oscar worthy; really spectacular. The story requires a suspension of most space science one knows. Actually the story is rather mundane and not noteworthy. Think of the IBM Watson supercomputer (the visual effects) running on top of a first edition Windows 95 PC run by a 50 mhz Intel computer with 60k of memory. Great power in the look, not much under the hood.

I give props to Clooney and Bullock for trying to pull the story off. It looked to be very physically demanding.

The above was based on the 3D DVD.",1393459200,,536,4.515463917525773
5877760,4,B00DY64A3U,"I really liked this movie. The graphics/special effects were out of this world :-)  I'm a big Sandra Bullock fan. She did an outstanding job in her portrayal of the stranded astronaut struggling for survival. I wish there had been more back story to the plot. The ending took me a bit to understand. There was a lot of symbolism. It was a huge struggle to get her balance and stand at the water's edge since she had been in space for a week and her muscles had suffered. Her struggle to gather herself up, paralleled the great effort of her decision to go on living, not to just survive, but to thrive. She had emotionally checked out after her daughter's death. Bullock's character had been lost on Earth in the grieving process of the loss of her daughter; and probably had only been able to deal with the grief by concentrating on her work. How ironic that she could bury herself in work, avoiding getting on with her life to the point that she left the planet on this mission where she faced imminent peril. However, she could not get away from the tipping point in her head. Both situations shared similar required determination. Her position in her grieving was metaphorically portrayed by the malfunctioning Soyuz station escape pod as she yelled and kicked in frustration at the stymied circuitry.. My favorite dialog in the movie was the pep talk Clooney's ghost gave her at her emotional crossroad moment -- It would be so easy to just shut down. Should she just end it all or should she keep trying to survive? She had defined her purpose for living by her role as parent. Her work appeared to be important; however prevented her from dealing with her changed life's purpose. At the very end, while she carefully put one foot in front of the other; I held my breath thinking, ""Oh mercy! Ok, she got through all that in space, then she almost drowned after splash down. Now she is going to get eaten by an alligator or giant snake"" Thankfully no creatures popped up from the shadows to harm her. She was all alone. She didn't know where she was. The big thing was she had the will to live again and the perseverance to find her way in the world on her own steam.",1393459200,2,2172,4.471032745591939

5877764,2,B00DY64A3U,"I watched this for the first time last night after reading a number of reviews and came away disappointed.  The best aspects of the movie were the visual effects and audio.  Both were very well done.  After those, the movie was bad.  I couldn't help but laugh out loud at much of the dialogue, it was cringe worthy if I tried to take it seriously.  A few scenes of notably bad lines come to mind.

-Clooney is cracking jokes as he's freely floating off into space for what very well could be his final minutes of existence.  I fail to believe this is how somebody would act when they're about to possibly die.
-Bullock is in an escape ship with impending possible death.  She laughs and says, ""If I die, no harm no foul.""  Again, I fail to believe this is how somebody would act when they're about to possibly die.
-Bullock's most used lines were, ""No, no, no, no, no, no,"" ""Come on, come on, come on,"" and grunts.  Riveting stuff.

The acting by the two was also not very good.  They didn't seem to be into their roles.  It's hard to explain, but it seemed like they were going through the motions as actors.  I didn't buy the idea of either of them being astronauts, they seemed like actors portraying astronauts.  I'm not sure how this movie gained as much admiration as it has from viewers and critics.  I'm scoring this solely as a movie watcher and not as someone who understands the intricacies of space or its physics.  From purely an entertainment viewpoint, it was very lackluster and below average for a movie of its scale, star power, and high marks from other reviewers.  I'm glad I did not spend the $15 to see it in theaters, although I'm sure it looked great in 3-D on the big screen.

Pros: Visuals and audio, both were very well done.
Cons: Just about everything else.  A clich back story for Bullock's character to try to invoke emotion from the audience at a few points, poor acting by both Bullock and Clooney, and horrible writing round out the most prominent cons.  Oh, let's not forget about Bullock selecting which buttons to use on a Chinese ship in order to prep it for landing by literally using eenie meenie miney mo (she even says the words as she's selecting the buttons) as a legitimate decision method.",1393459200,8,2235,4.469135802469136

5877769,5,B00DY64A3U,"Father and son team Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n and Jon&aacute;s Cuar&oacute;n wrote the screenplay (with assistance from George Clooney) and Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n directed (with capable assistance from director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki) what is likely to go down in cinematic history as a shining moment of the art of the craft. It manages to tell an impossibly simple story about surviving and not surviving astronauts out in space and makes the emotions so complex that the audience is left speechless. It is a staggering achievement.

Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a brilliant medical engineer on her first shuttle mission, with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) in command of his last flight before retiring. But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone - tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness. How eventually Stone manipulates the fragments of international spacecraft in her attempt to live is profoundly touching and extraordinarily touching.

Both Bullock and Clooney offer portraits not only of the characters they portray but also the hopes and fears of us all if ever faced with surviving the impossible. This is a film that must be seen to understand and appreciate the little miracle Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n has created. Grady Harp, February 14",1393459200,2,1392,5.439814814814815

It is so mind numbingly boring. There was one exciting part when the accident happened and then it was a snooze fest. Bullock's personal issues were irrelevant because they didn't really matter and wouldn't have made a difference in the plot line at all. It all looks like gratuitous 'floatie' space scenes but together into a movie. The plot was so boring. They should have either focused on her survival or her personal issues.

Stone and Kowalski are on a space shuttle mission to do work on the Hubble Telescope.

Soon, satellite debris is wreaking havoc on the space shuttle, telescope and the shuttle crew themselves.  Stone and Kowalski are the only survivors.

In this limited window, Kowalski and Stone must somehow make their way to the International Space Station and try to get in one of the escape pods to make the return to earth.  Unfortunately, the debris foils that plan and leaves Stone alone as well.  Will she survive to make it back to earth?

The visuals were stunning, so much so that you could truly feel yourself in the situations of the film. But why put all that talent to stressing out your viewers? Whatever happened to feel good movies? I think this is why Hollywood is not winning America over with 3D. So far, all the 3D films I've come across are either made for children (boring for adults) or contain too much fighting and/or terror. It's a shame because all of the 3D films I've seen, whether for children or adults, have had gorgeous visual effects. Why can't they create a visually beautiful film that leaves you feeling good or at least thinking about the story when you leave? The animated movies don't have to exclude adults. Just make the story as interesting as the visuals. Even Avatar, which had some of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen in a film had ugly creatures and lots of fighting. Stop with the... errrr... thrills already and just give us something that leaves us wanting more. Sheesh... it's not rocket science!",1393372800,3,1102,4.627551020408164

For a movie like Gravity, this really matters--and so I only give 3 stars for this otherwise excellent movie.

If you compare this video to Avatar, for example, which is truly 1.77:1, you can really see the difference it makes for the 3D experience.

Other than the aspect ratio, this is a very good quality video.  No other complaints.  If your Blu-ray player or TV/projector has a zoom feature, you may be able to partly compensate.

Folks, saw this one last night. I tell you, I've seen some pretty intense films in my time but this one hits the ground running almost immediately after the film starts and doesn't let up until the credits rolls. Got to admit, I was sitting on the edge of my seat the whole time wondering what was going to happen next. I think the thing I loved most about the film was, at times, you'd see things from a first-person view and that would give you a sudden sense of what Ryan's going through. My only gripe with Gravity is that, considering I get motion sickness, the way the camera constantly stayed on the move..it got quite dizzying sometimes.

While they did take a few artistic licenses here and there, they really struck the perfect balance between realism and a movie that is fun to watch.

This movie is not for everyone. It takes a bit of work to watch and take in. This isn't an action movie, and a bit more thought is required. If you are physics purist and are going to nit-pick every little thing you might not enjoy it. In my observation, the more realistic a movie is the more people like to criticize its realism.

Strangely enough, the utter silence in much of this film is every bit as dramatic. The beautiful shots of the space station, both interior and exterior would have made Arthur C. Clarke proud. If you want to get a sense of the experience of this film, think about stories in which someone is alone on a boat on a vast ocean and has to live by their wits. The isolation pervades the movie, and the lack of an intrusive score intensifies the feeling of what it would be like to be alone in near space. The photography is absolutely spectacular, and the 3-D effects are much more sophisticated than my memories of early 3-D. The 3-D is used to bring the isolation of the space station into contrast with the experience of the vastness of space. The plot line is sparse and the focus is on a very capable Sandra Bullock as a lone astronaut struggling to survive. George Clooney takes a back seat to Bullock in this film.

My first impression so was correct.

I don't know what science this movie portrays, but it isn't much like any reality I know.  I mean, maybe I'm just misinterpreting things. Maybe jet packs are viable space-walking amusements that can rapidly change your orbital position.  Maybe explosions in space have near limitless power and go in circles.

But, really, no.  This is a very shallow and empty movie that only clings to life with the terrible fear that the characters might die.  Of course, in shallow pathetic Hollywood movies there are no unhappy endings.  There might be a few casualties along the way, but the ending has to be happy.  So what's there to worry about?

As for the woman in space, well, at least in Barbarella the woman was scantily clad.  Here I see a woman in most of a space suit who mysteriously isn't being burned to death by the lack of a sun-shade on her helmet.

It is achingly beautiful at times, with just the right touches of poignancy. The music is just right and never overpowers the film. The direction is amazing.
There are three films that have put me in space. 2001, Apollo 13 and Gravity.
Clooney gives a wonderful performance as the mission commander, Kowalski that gets little attention as it is a supporting role. But I can't think of an actor I would rather have.
Sandra Bullock gives her finest performance in Gravity. She is transcendent. The last such powerful performance by a woman in a SF film was given by Sigourney Weaver in Aliens. I doubt she will win for best actress at the Oscars. She should. But while this is the type of film that may occasionally get acting recognition, it is always deemed enough simply to be nominated. Not enough to me. Bullock should win.
The same goes for the film and the director.
It's odd to see so many people disliking this film. I guess to many people, a trip into space and fighting to survive is not enough to make up a film. It needed more subplots, a larger cast, etc. Different strokes and all that.
I was worried that seeing this at home, without 3D, would diminish the effect. I needn't have worried. The impact of seeing this film was only minutely diminished.

In fact, I didn't read any of it before I watched the movie; I was simply trying to catch up on the award-winning flicks. And this one is brilliantly, achingly good. The effects are incredible, the lighting - dark and foreboding throughout - puts the viewer squarely into the space, the soundtrack amplifies the action without distracting in any way. (I couldn't even describe it without going back to listen.) This movie is perfect for men and women alike - so, don't dismiss it for date night. But if you're watching together, what you will want to prepare for is your own personal, visceral reaction to crushing (and very silent) isolation, loss of others, loss of hope, and abject terror. Along with the characters in the movie, you WILL traverse the stages of human response to trauma and grief . But this experience is wildly different when set in space, hundreds of miles above a beautiful but distant earth. That's new territory for all of us - and it definitely caught me off guard. Brilliant!",1393286400,11,1105,4.671794871794872
5877853,1,B00DY64A3U,I wish I had rented first I think it was very poor science fiction movie Sandra Bullock was the rite actor for this part I have a lot of her movie's and she was great in them. She does not fit the scientific type it was not believable in the beginning of the movie she was running out of air but she still had air for the rest of the movie SAVE YOUR MONEY RENT IT FIRST IT STINKS,1393286400,3,379,3.810126582278481
5877854,5,B00DY64A3U,"While watching ""Gravity,"" I was constantly reminded of Newton's First Law of Motion.

No, not the part about ""An object in motion tends to stay in motion,"" but rather the part, ""An object at rest tends to stay at rest.""  (In reality, both statements are easily combined into one and it was by the Greatest Mathematician of All Time.)  This was because I didn't want to get up off the couch while watching as it was so good; I wanted to stay at rest while Sandra Bullock did all the heavy lifting.

But if you're smart enough to rent this film, you'll realize that the first part applies as well.  While watching, I actually braced myself many times while Ms. Bullock or George Clooney were flying through space, headed towards an imminent collision with, say, their Space Shuttle.  (I thought that the Space Shuttle was mothballed quite a while ago?  Well, no matter.)  Or while Ms. Bullock was headed straight for a Russian Space Station and was obviously going to take a header.  (The Space Station's still there, I think.)

And you'll also think about the Third Law, when Ms. Bullock tries to put out a fire with a fire extinguisher and gets thrown violently backwards into a wall.  (There is another fire extinguisher scene, that I didn't exactly buy.  Perhaps possible, but highly improbable.). But you'll think about force equals mass times acceleration, momentum equals mass times velocity, etc. etc.  At least if you took enough Physics in college, I suppose.

But I really liked the fact that they showed Mr. Clooney here easily being able to do math problems in his head.  This would be an absolute necessity in space; taking out a calculator would be impossible, and forget about pen and paper.  I suppose you might be able to use Siri, but from my experience, she's not very good at math.  Or even finding directions or a good restaurant, really.  (I tested Siri on some Calculus problems that I did in my head.  I was superior, although she did get a derivative right in a simple case, but she failed on an integral.)

While I have a degree in Computer Science and a minor in math, I'm just betting that this film is a physicist's dream.  Most of the physics here really seem to be spot on, unlike most sci-fi films that I've seen.  At the opening of the film, there is even some text that describes ideas such as ""There is no sound in space.""  (Sound waves can't move through nothing, although Stephen Hawking might argue that dark matter is everywhere so maybe we should ask him.)  So the director, right up front, was saying that he was trying to get these things right.  And I think that he really did.

If I had a complaint -- I really shouldn't as I believe that this should win Best Picture at The Academy Awards, even though it most likely won't for some ridiculous political correctness reason -- it would be from a statistical analysis perspective.  If you see all of the bad things that Ms. Bullock has to endure, and you assume that those things are independent, and you multiply all of those together, you would quickly realize that the chance of escape pretty much goes to zero for her.  But this is still a film, and you still need the protagonist to endure the most difficult time of her life.  And you need her to not die, at least too quickly, so that you can make it to at least a third act.  So I'll let this one go.

What is interesting is the title.  When my wife and I used to live in Noe Valley in San Francisco, I used to always joke, ""Yeah, the physicists that say that 'gravity is a weak force' never tried climbing up and down the hills here,"" as we trudged up to our house on 28th street like Billy Goats.  But this film just might show that we earthlings take gravity for granted.  You'll only really miss it when it starts to decay as a function of k over r squared as you move away from ""Mother Earth,"" as Mr. Clooney might say.",1393286400,3,3873,4.454545454545454
5877855,4,B00DY64A3U,"Let me start by saying I loved this film, even on the small screen. It's an absolute edge of your seat thrill ride and sets a new standard for movie special effects. It has a clever way of making you think that you are there, in peril with George and Sandra (when did astronauts get so hot?) and some of the sequences are real (as we say in my country), 'brown trouser moments'.

So why don't I rate it 5 stars? I was tempted, and in some ways it deserves it. However, I liken it more to a thrill ride at an amusement park rather than a deep meaningful movie and I felt that some of Bullock's backstory in the film felt a little contrived.
Saying that though, this is still an amazing experience and everyone should see it once. Does it matter that it's not deep? No, not a jot, it is what it is, and it's great. Hugely recommended.",1393286400,3,832,4.167701863354037

First, we saw the movie in IMAX 3D which is the ultimate way to see this ultimate experience movie.  That's what this movie is:  it's an experience.  I had never seen a 3D movie which made you really feel that you were in a 3D environment.  This one did.  You feel as if you are there and it was a visceral, gut-wrenching experience.  Towards the end (won't give anything away here), I was brought to tears.  I felt overwhelmed.

Second, it would be hard not to be impressed by Sandra Bullock's performance in this movie.  As with Tom Hanks in Castaway, she is practically the only 'person' in the movie.  It has to be a very difficult task to act without someone to act 'with'; someone to play off against.  She does a great job--an Academy award-winning level of work.  I will not be surprised at all if she wins.

I'm going to wait and see what people say once the Blu-ray comes out before I buy it.  For me, it will be impossible to duplicate the experience of the IMAX 3D environment, even with a 55 inch tv.

5877883,5,B00DY64A3U,"This movie was throughly enjoyable and no doubt will clean up at the Oscars (although I don't see it getting best picture). In discussion and reviews I've heard it referred to as 'science- fiction.' This is somewhat misleading. Although it features fictional characters the story focuses on work NASA astronauts perform today, primarily NASA Mission Specialist Dr. Ryan Stone(Sandra Bullock).

The Science Fiction category usally encompasses highly speculative films set in the far future, like the recent 'Prometheus' and 'Star Trek Into Darkness.' Gravity doesn't feature the warp drive that gets you across the galaxy in a heart beat. Instead we are treated to the heroic and often unheralded work of astronauts today, exploring nearby space as best as current technology and budgets will allow. Hopefully the take-away from this enjoyable film will be more people getting excited about the important work of space exploration today. In Gravity a catastrophic space accident(no spoilers here) wrecks Dr. Stone's ride back to Earth. Director Alfonso Cuaron (Y Tu Mama Tambien, Children of Men and the best Harry Potter - Prisoner of Azkaban) gives us a front row seat as she battles for survival. In the 'life is unfair' category Dr. Stone faces one problem after another(or multiple problems at the same time) searching for a way home. And her home is right there, filling the screen beautifully and majestically.

Movies where dialog is limited due to all of the alone time by the main characters have to engage us in other ways(i.e,'WALL-E,' 'Castaway' and the classic 'Robinson Crusoe on Mars'). Through it's intensity and outstanding special effects this film does that. This nicely sets up the limited dialog where Dr. Stone, because she is so near to death, reflects meaningfully and poignantly on life. Viewing the film in IMAX 3D was awesome, definitely worth the extra money.

The degree that Bullock acts prissy, I don't know what to do, I'm helpless, no. Not acceptable soldier. All astronauts undergo strict, disciplined to determine what they will do in case something like an asteroid or a Dish Network satellite collides with their space vehicle. But no, let the female stereotypes, the bias, the lack of reality begin. It almost makes it not worth watching. I haven't decided yet. In real life, Bullock is a producer. In a male dominated space program, what does she think about losing control and not being able to perform under pressure? If the obvious female roles are worth fighting for, then what about the ones that show women to be frantic and full of panic? There are so few female fighter jet pilots that it's almost not worth saying that there are any female fighter pilots. What do some of them worry about? Family, how other people perceive them.

What dissapointed me that was the fact that this film wasn't very realistic and I know very little about NASA and space travel.  But traveling from Hubble to the International Space Station as if it were just a small space walk with a small jet pack... Oy.....

The lack of other characters was also a dissapointment.  Basically it's a movie with two characters and that's it.  No flashbacks to life, no NASA grown crew/staff etc....  Then when George Clooney dies off (sorry spoiler) then your down to just Sandra and Sandra alone as the only character.

It was disappointing to see Sandra struggle with her past, but yet it was all her verbal talk, they could have included some flashbacks of that past......

It would have been nice to have included NASA in Houston and how they reacted to the entire situation.... from their perspective.

If a person spent that much time spinning as Sandra did in the beginning of the movie wouldn't they get sick to their stomach?  What stopped her spinning, since I thought motion kept just happening in space unless something stopped it....

Then when she landed, it would have been nice to have Sandra walk or whatever until she was rescued, NASA in Houstons reaction when they found out she was alive and landed they can only assume safely.  I think you know what I mean.

But basically it's a movie with only two characters and a voice in Houston that is NASA.  Bug disappointment.

If I had to say something positive about the film it would be the views.... the views looking down to earth are amazing and really gives you the feeling of what it's like for what those that actually make it up into space see.  Seeing the earth from above was beautiful.  But I have to wonder if the ring of fire is really that visible from space.....",1393113600,8,2022,4.5484764542936285

[Any of us would be looking out windows trying to find the friend...but the last thing we would be doing is relishing our sexuality...]

Then after the sensual scene-she magically appears with new space suits.  This is where it just becomes not even plausible.  A huge insult to NASA - no person doing what she did would ever be allowed in space to begin with.

What is it with all the critical praise for this movie? I don't understand what all the hype is for. Why on earth is the acting considered so great? Clooney sounds like he's sleep walking through his entire performance. He's bland as hell and just seems to be doing this a little too understated. His acting is almost as if he's making fun of the whole thing. Like there's an inner smirk trying to get out at the audience in him. Bullock is fine, but she doesn't quite seem on the mark sometimes. There seem to be moments when the director should have used a better take. She's done better than this and her acting range in many of her films pretty much out-perform this performance. Most of those were not nominated for any Oscars nor where they outstanding enough to have been. Neither is this performance. The special effects are very good I will admit, but nothing particularly earth shattering, completely groundbreaking or astonishing. And the film is mostly special effects. In the past a film like Independence Day, which at the time had some of the most advanced special effects in cinema,  still was not nominated for Best Picture. Nor were many movies ever nominated based of effects alone. In fact people seem to generally and historically frown on films that are built around mostly effects and everything else seems secondary. Why now does this film earn so much praise?

There is nothing here but some pretty good effects and some stale to acceptable acting. The script is simple as simple can be, and elementary on top of it. Why are some critics and some of the public calling this film a masterpiece? I simply do not get it. Thinking back on some of the classic sci-fi  or drama movies that take place in outer space or are about space out there like Alien, Star Wars (for that matter any of the Star Wars movies), Blade Runner, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Contact, Apollo 13, etc., this movie is not anywhere near as good as any of them. It really isn't.

Movies are not what they used to be. Occasionally 2 or 3 good ones come along worth a genuine Oscar nod every year, and the quality of good films has bottomed out over the last 6 years or so. Movies win best picture Oscars now  that never would have been nominated 20 years ago. I go into movies with far less expectations than I once did, and still I found this movie a visually interesting treat, but other than that I found it just plain average and feel it is not some masterpiece unless films are masterpieces nowadays based on special effects alone. Was not very impressed and I don't see why this movie is nominated for 11 Oscars. I'm beginning to wonder if the studios aren't paying off the AMPAS members to get Oscar nominations or something. Read some of the other 1 and 2 star reviews, others seem to be wondering the same thing.

Worth a look if you want an evening of some slightly better than your run of the mill sci-fi with some way better than average special effects. Other than that I'd skip it.",1392940800,5,3135,4.547872340425532

There are formidable performances here to be sure. With a good home theater sound system the audio is top notch and compelling. Nevertheless, GRAVITY on my 47"" HDTV failed miserably to blow me away. Perhaps the 3D Blu-Ray is another matter--but I do not have a 3D set.

I tend to think that the sheer scope and detail of this masterpiece requires the immersive experience of a large 3D theater. Looking at it ""through a window"" on TV does not do it justice.

My intention here is not to critique the direction, actors etc. Simply put, this motion picture needs to be seen preferably in 3D--BIG and LOUD. On TV you can appreciate the performances and production value--but I doubt that you will be swept away into the story.

5877945,4,B00DY64A3U,"Although one has to be willing to suspend a lot of disbelief scientifically speaking, Gravity is a poetic film, and when allowed to be what it is, it's quite beautiful.  The story of Mission Specialist Dr. Ryan Stone (""what kind of name is that for a girl?"") is one of loss, but also of finally realizing that, even after suffering a devastating grief, her life is worth living, and finally, is wanted. Watching Stone's journey from paralyzing fear to courage and will is riveting, despite being essentially a one-woman show.  George Clooney's calm, rational portrayal of astronaut Matt Kowalski is understated and underrated, in my opinion.  In his brief time onscreen, he shows us exactly what Jonathan Frakes spent seven years trying to achieve in Commander Riker - a highly trained, highly competent, even gifted leader, yet one with an easy charm and sense of humor.  The character's absolute command of a terrifying situation was both believable and remarkable, and it is his calm that allows Stone to dig deep for her own resources.

While the science may be sketchy, you will marvel, wondering, How did they film this?  If you don't, you either work in the film industry, or you are a rocket scientist. In the end, though, it isn't the science that's important.  It's traveling at 18,000 miles per hour around an ever-closer Earth with a frightened woman who must answer the question we all ask ourselves: If I knew this was my last day to live, how would I face it?  Sandra Bullock's quiet performance sells the whole premise, and Cuaron's direction gives a lyrical quality to the experience.  I highly recommend it.",1392854400,4,1625,4.858695652173913

The production treats us to a rollercoaster of believable special effects forming a chain of links to Bullocks survival of the horrors of being alone in space.  True, she must ""dance through raindrops"" to make it to an abandoned Chinese escape pod and everything seems to convientley line up for her.  Don't all rollercoaster thrill rides end happily?

I say experience, because this film transcends stereotypes (sci-fi, thriller, drama, suspense); there is very little dialog; the only action is what's necessary; the science is the most accurate of any film to date. Let's just clear up that the best CGI/Special Effect is putting the actors into space. The story here is pretty much the antithesis of ""Armageddon"". Don't expect some hail mary rescue from Earth using some ultra Top Secret rescue ship. If there is a big explosion, you are not going to hear it - ""In space no one can hear you scream"". No Aerosmith rock tune or a Hans Zimmer Soundtrack is going to tell you how you should feel at any given moment. There are no heroes in this film, just people in a near hopeless situation. I watched this film on IMAX 3D, and will probably just watch the Blu-ray version. I am disappointed that it only has UltraViolet - I hate UltraViolet.

It brings to light that space travel is anything but routine and that any moment even the best of our astronauts and mission specialist can die to events beyond their control.

5878001,4,B00DY64A3U,"I wanted this movie to be perfect, as I have heard so many good things about it.
It was good, a great sci-fi movie overall, but maybe my expectations were too high.... I had a few issues with some of the content.

First of all, as others have mentioned, try and watch it in 3D. I watched a ""regular"" HD (non 3D) version, and the action sequences definitely didn't work as good for me as they should have. I could see in many sequences that such or such scene was completely designed to work in 3D. Not a deal breaker, but I kept thinking ""I should have watched it in a 3d Theater instead of my regular TV""

Secondly, the movie is trying so hard to be close to reality but some sequences ""break"" the immersion:
- the fetal position scene, which lasts too long and is way too obvious. Not really cliche, but way too ""perfect"" and obvious, feels like a weird attempt at ""making art""?
- The movie tries hard to make the audience understand that space lacks sound, all the sounds in the movie (including music) come from people's radios, etc... but a few moments completely break that, such as the music theme at the end of the movie
- some scenes feel cheesy, towards the end there is a monologue form Sandra Bullock about how she will be strong, etc... It's difficult at the moment to think she is talking to Houston, and not to the camera.

There are a few tiny moments in the movie like that which disconnected me from the experience, but in general this was a very solid movie, with good acting, good special effects, and constant pressure that kept me on the edge of my seat.",1392681600,2,1576,4.335593220338983

5878004,1,B00DY64A3U,"Yes, there are fantastic special effects, but the movie is just one error after another when it comes to what is possible.  If this were a movie about magic and wizards, maybe it wouldn't matter. But this movie tries very hard to be realistic. Here are just a few mistakes:

1) NASA would never send a medical doctor (Sandra Bullock) with only 6 months of astronaut training on a mission to go on a space walk to repair the Hubble Space telescope.  And the reason we're given for NASA sending her (that she figured out that a scanning device used in hospitals might work on the Hubble Space telescope but that only she is capable of installing and repairing it) is ridiculous.

2) The Hubble Space Telescope, by the way, is 100 miles higher than the International Space Station and it would be impossible to move from one to the other with a little jet pack.

3) The biggest mistake occurs when George Clooney lets go of a tether connecting him to Sandra Bullock and floats away.  This could never happen since they are both motionless relative to each other. It's like two people floating in a swimming pool holding a rope.  Some claim the parachute cords that snag Bullock when she's floating past are elastic, stretching until Clooney lets go, then snapping Bullock back, leaving Clooney to continue floating away.  But Bullock is clearly jerked to a stop by the parachute cords (as is Clooney by Bullock's tether), so the ""stretching"" explanation doesn't work.  In fact, it would take only a tiny flick of Bullock's wrist on the tether to bring Clooney toward her.  This is a jaw-dropping error in the film and Clooney's big ""you've got to let me go"" speech as if he's dangling over a cliff is complete nonsense.

4) Russia would never fire a rocket to destroy one of its satellites, particularly not with astronauts at both the space station and the Hubble telescope.  All satellites have their own propulsion to adjust their orbits and can be directed to crash into the Earth. Plus, Russia would owe billions of dollars to numerous countries if it wiped out satellites, space stations, etc. and Russia would know in advance if this were a possibility.

4) George Clooney says that half of North America just lost their Facebook, but access to the internet in North America is provided by DSL, cable, and 4G cell phones via cell towers, not by satellites.  These are the two dumbest astronauts ever sent into space.

5) Clooney and Bullock lose communication with Earth, but communication satellites are nowhere near where the exploding debris is. The Hubble telescope (where Clooney and Bullock are) orbits about 350 miles above the Earth. Communication satellites that keep astronauts in touch with Mission Control orbit about 22,000 miles above the Earth in geostationary orbits.

6) Sandra Bullock's little capsule at the end of the movie would skip off the atmosphere into space because it (and the space station it came from) are orbiting Earth at around 17,000 mph.  It would need to go through a deorbit burn for a few minutes to slow down before descending.  Without the necessary calculations for timing the burn, Bullock would never make it.  Didn't the film makers see ""Apollo 13""?  The idea that a civilian in space could just randomly push buttons and make it back to Earth is beyond unbelievable.

Some people tell me to ignore the mistakes since ""it's a movie, not a documentary.""  The thing is, it's trying to be realistic, an accurate depiction of surviving in outer space.  But with so many science errors, it's just counting on the audience being totally stupid.

That's why I'm glad so many people have spoken out.  If the movie had a great plot or great dialogue, maybe I could overlook some of these (and more) mistakes, but the plot is thin and silly and the ludicrous dialogue basically consists of Clooney's constant obnoxious jokey chatter and Bullock alternating between hyperventilating and her whiny ""no, no, no!""",1392595200,45,3948,4.804733727810651
5878005,3,B00DY64A3U,"Everything said about it visually is true. It looks outstanding and is unbelievably tense. But as soon as anyone starts with their back stories and oh so witty tales it is just annoying. Did Bullock really need her earth tragedy? Just a will to survive would not be enough for viewers. Did the producers insist that there must be at least one sit down with Clooney and ""Sandy"" on screen. And the sledgehammer rebirth/evolution scenes. Puhleeeeease.....A dialog free Blu Ray option should be offered.",1392595200,2,499,4.9523809523809526

5878015,5,B00DY64A3U,"A fascinating blend of opposing extremes, Gravity is gripping and white-knuckle intense from the word go, but also unexpectedly intimate as a character study. Many of its successes are due to an excellent application of sound design, which flutters from loud, echoey destruction to the sudden stillness of panicked breathing amidst the silence of a total vacuum. Outstanding visual effects up the ante a few more notches, expertly visualizing the helpless chaos of a rapidly-compounding disaster in low orbit in a way that's both picturesque and graphically terrifying. That the rules and environments are all so foreign and unfamiliar only makes it easier for the viewing audience to forget that so much of what we're seeing is CG. The underlying moral is more than a little blunt, and a few laws might get bent along the way, but to zero in on those is to ignore the focus of the ride itself.

This has two big stars in it, Sandra Bullock who plays the part of a skittish Hubble telescope repair woman, and George Clooney, the Comannder of the mission who just can't stop jibber jabbering enough to contribute to the story line. Two hours of these two spinning in space the last 45 minutes of which Bullock spends alone going from station to station  and preparing for the end. It wasn't really scary, I don't think it was supossed to be. The storyline wasn't very good either. Want to see Clooney in something good? See Oceans 11 or Oceans 13. Sandra Bullock has tons of great movies to her credit. This isn't one of them.",1392508800,5,727,4.385185185185185
5878033,3,B00DY64A3U,"This was a decent movie; I read it took four years to produce.

However, frankly, I found it a bit boring.  Yes, there were emotional moments, but there was nothing surprising.  The trailers made it seem as though it would be a sci-fi thriller.  It was closer to a documentary.

The cinematography, directing, and acting, were all top-notch.  George Clooney is always a top-notch actor in anything.  However, so much of the film was CG (computer graphics), 9 out of 10 scenes reminded me of current (or next, if you will) generation console games.  There were many first-person viewpoints, and the graphics were on par with what the Playstation 4 is putting out now.  A lot of scenes reminded me of Killzone: Shadow Fall, floating in space, opening hatches, etc, in first-person view.  It was a bit too much CG for me.  Granted, it would be difficult to shoot an entire movie in a falling plane (to simulate zero/low gravity), but still, so many first-person viewpoints and being 90% CG came off as too video game-like.

I have to give it credit for the acting and directing, and the quality of the CG; just too much CG and not enough real cinematography for me-the way great films seem to be going these days.",1392508800,,1210,4.629107981220657

I also thought it took a lot of courage to end the movie with the final scene of Sandra Bullock dragging herself from the shore and walking off.  No scene of a modern press mobbing the hero, etc.  Just the last image of a human, stripped of all technology, picking herself up and walking off, leaving nothing more than a bare footprint in the ground, like billions of humans before her.  Very cool.",1392508800,,514,4.4361702127659575
5878038,1,B00DY64A3U,"You have a film that you audaciously give a one word title to. You put an insane amount of money, and work and technical expertise into making a movie that depicts weightlessness realistically. You avoid many of the cheap and easy mistakes that prior movies made when they depicted the realities of outer space. You even come up with many innovative techniques to film weightlessness in new ways. Yet when it comes to the most pivotal scene in the movie, when the main character is left alone, instead of separating her by using any number of easy, logical ways that would be possible during the characters violent, prolonged crash with the space station, the director/writer chooses to have the tethered astronauts come to a full stop.
Any child that has lived long enough to catch a ball or ride a bike has learned enough of physics to understand what the director apparently has ignored - that if both astronauts have stopped, then George Clooney doesn't have to make a speech about sacrificing himself to keep Sandra Bullock from perishing - if he untethers himself from her he will just float there. There is no unseen force that will drag him away exclusively. The micro gravity that acts on Sandra Bullock and the space station is the same that would be working on him.
What was the director thinking? Did he conceive of the film while daydreaming about the classic movie trope of the tethered mountain climbers (the imperiled one always cutting the rope to save the other). Did he forget about the need for gravity for that to work? Did the producers, financiers, the technical people, the studio executives etc. all ignore that?

5878049,2,B00DY64A3U,"Hi, we have been thrilled w watching Amazon Instant Video, since September, until this one.
We have chosen to not subscribe to regular TV options and really like our Amazon experience thus far.
We could not get the volume and basic control panel to exit the screen,
going to full screen, then the option, ""yes or no"" on full screen, which if you answer wrong (yes) paused and sent the screen view back to ""normal"", as when first purchasing, and when clicking ""no"" -in blue, (suggested)  made us click on the background panel to get full screen view, but still showing the control panel. We tried everything we knew to view full screen without the control panel in view, to no avail. Would have much rather rented for $5.99, only this option was not visibly available to me until after I had actually purchased the film.

Sandra Bullock was pretty good, to be stuck in space w her, with the control panel visibly below and unremovable, and we really worried when George Clooney let go, & we were stuck w Sandra, all alone in space. When GC showed back up as a ghost, that was a comic relief, but similar type scenes have been used in many movies lately.
The effects were lovely and there were some well acted suspenseful moments .
Our only complaint was the control panel that we could not make go away.
As a mostly happy couple of 4 years, we have always had bad luck on Valentine's day, especially my girlfriend, who has always had bad luck on Valentines Day, which is why we decided to stay home and order a movie,
so the frustrations were sort of comical..... somewhat.
We did laugh about it.
If Amazon wishes to remove this movie from my library and give us an Instant Video credit, that would be awesome.
We paid $19.99 for it in HD, which sometimes actually works and sometimes does not.
We are watching through a MacBook Pro via HDMI to a 2011 LG lcd/led TV.",1392422400,,1865,4.4662756598240465

It is probably the worst movie I have ever seen in my life, it's like watching ""Open Water"" only with absolute silence. The action moments are stale and the only two major actor/actress in it hardly have any real lines or places to actually use there talent like they should be able to.

5878072,3,B00DY64A3U,"I bought this via my PS4 to see if it's worthy of buying in 3D Blu-ray... perhaps, I haven't decided yet. All I can say is that by the end of this movie I had literally yelled out ""what... really?, NO WAY did they write that into the screenplay, OH REALLY? no that didn't just happen, can't she HOLD ONTO ANYTHING when her life depends on it!?"" about 10 or more times.

It's all about the visuals, the story is a survival tale pretty much consisting of an emotional fluff back story and nothing more, the driving point of the movie is the 3D aspect and cinematography which is a lot of space shots/orbit shots. There are moments when I wanted to throttle the director... for some stupid reason they had Bullock's character literally stop and stare at the camera, yes... her life is in imminent danger not a second to spare yet she stops and turns towards the camera and looks right into the lens, another moment she finally makes it to the safety of the capsule to get back to oxygen then strikes a ballet pose, while that's not bad if it's timed right... she holds the pose for about 20 seconds, then transitions into a 'child in the womb' ball and that's held for another 20 seconds or more!

In short, once again it's as if the entire story was just fluff to get in the way, or give the excuse to focus on the visuals. I'm thinking of getting the 3D version because that might drive home the only worthy aspect of this joke of a movie. Maybe I'll wait until it's dirt cheap...",1392422400,4,1479,4.316546762589928

Very suspenseful movie, looking like she was about to loose her life over and over again.

We've seem this before in multiple other space flicks and NASA's own films.  It was nothing new.  The various camera angles are typical of the experience in space that many other special effects designers have mimicked before so was a bit tired to view again.

5878093,1,B00DY64A3U,"Saw this in a theater, and thought the 3D effects were good, but often contrived, as if they belatedly remembered they had 3D. 2 stars at best for use of 3D and all the missed opportunities to make this a truly spectacular feast for the eyes.

The first half of this movie held a lot of promise as it set up the story. Once the story was in place, the second half was simply an epic fail. Predictable in spots, and when not predictable, I couldn't help wondering if the scene only made it to the final script and then through the editing process because they needed the movie to be longer than 60 minutes.

I love Sandra Bullock's acting, normally. Not in this.  I don't blame her because I know she could have done better. I'm sure she did what she was told by the director or the script or both. She did her usual stellar job in the first half, but it's almost as if she knew this movie was a dud by the second half and just did whatever she was told.

I think George Clooney is extremely overrated. I never have understood the fuss over him. I've long since given up on him, he apparently sees no need to even try to live up to his hype, but a friend dragged me to see The Descendants. I thought I'd give him another chance. Waste of money.

5878097,5,B00DY64A3U,"Already nominated for four Golden Globes this year, I was really excited to finally get to see ""Gravity"". It's been called the best film of the year, and I can definitely see why.

Sandra Bullock stars as Ryan Stone, a brilliant medical engineer on her first shuttle mission with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney). During a routine space walk, disaster strikes and their shuttle is destroyed. Their left completely alone drifting into blackness, as their oxygen levels decrease rapidly. Fighting to survive, their story will leave you on the edge of your seat.

You've never seen space as vivid and beautiful, with stunning visual effects that will blow you away. Sandra Bullock delivers a stellar performance and deserves a best actress nod. George Clooney is able to bring new life into his acting, and immerses himself into the role. With Oscarseason just around the corner, this is a must-see for all ages. Rated PG-13 for intense sequences and language, ""Gravity"" was a visual feast that I couldn't get enough of.",1392163200,4,1033,5.035087719298246

5878099,3,B00DY64A3U,"Many reviews are going with the slant of believable sci-fi. Not really. One reviewer already pointed out the jet pack as one flaw and another about the earth rotating the wrong way. There's more obvious ones. Without trying to give any spoilers there's a part in the film where Sandra Bullock is trying to make it inside the hatch to save her fellow astronaught.who is drifting into the black...and once inside does she 'hurry' to get in the chair and do just that? No. She disrobes and does some fetal pose for the camera....while her target drifts further and further into unreachable....it just did not make any sense whatsoever..the hole affair left me thinking...hum...must have been in the contract to have this ""look I'm 50 and look how good I look"" because nothing else makes any other sense...not to mention she just stepped into a space station that is dormat....and even in her undies not one shiver from the cold.

Then there's just the major feats that take place that she must do to save herself. Do people really think astronaughts can just jetpack from one space station to another? Not once...but twice? Really?!

Then there's the dialouge. people just do not talk like this. not even in the middle of a major disaster like this...especially not in the middle of a major disaster like this.....""so where are you from?""....come on.

So overall. Bad writing. unbelieavable plot....even for sci-fi.

But decent acting, special effects and engaging at times ...but the pace is all over the place. Unlike when Sandra drove the Bus in Speed...no here the events are even more deadly and the outcome more bleak....but we have anything from joking, howling, posing, dreaming, very little actual fear or terror....which I would think would be abundance...or at least tension. No. it's more like an amusment ride. Everyone talks then they hit the top of the hill...for a few seconds there's some """"oh my God!!!"" then they reach the bottom...joke some, and prepare for the second climb.",1392163200,5,1992,4.919642857142857
5878100,5,B00DY64A3U,"At first, you will think you know the ending of this movie from the very start.  You've seen the previews, and yet I can tell you what you have seen is only a small part.  How can someone make a movie with such emotional courage, spiritual inspiration, and sheer determination out of what we have already seen?  But they do, oh they do!

It was motivational for me.  What makes it so?  I suppose it's the human side of us. How we control, or not control, our anxiety to survive. When is it time to give up, and when it is not? And, while the special effects don't even seem like special effects, they are more like pure photography.  So too are the sound effects because they don't seem like effects, but the real thing.  They simply allow the movie to be real.

If you've ever wanted to go to space, see this movie.  It gives you every angle, every bit of technology, and every fear coupled with the natural laws that matter must obey.  The only thing is, being human is more than a natural order of things.  Bad things do happen in space or right here on earth.  What are you made of? Could you handle it?  This is what this movie is all about.

Dr. Ryan Stone played by Sandra Bullock.  She is one of two main characters in the movie. I never once got the impression that she was acting nor did I see any bad acting that spoiled the scene.  She is a doctor, not particularly a life long employee of NASA.  So, she relies on veteran Astronaut Matt Kowalsky played by George Clooney.  His acting well is very similar to his other acting in so many movies; cool, calm and collected and well played.  He gives advice to Dr. Ryan on many times. She is wired with emotions, he is not.  Both are fantastic actors. However, I would like to see a movie where, just once, George Clooney loses it!  That would be fun!

Although the plot is fairly simple, taking us through it is not. What technology will fail? What can be improvised? This is probably not a movie that you would see twice.  Unless you really wanted to try and find the few tiny glitches in acting or perhaps some scenes where inertia and gravity theories don't seem quite right and you wanted a second look.  I suppose there might be a few of those.  But that would miss the true point of the movie.

In the end, the real point is that you too will thank the Earth for everything she has given you!  Bravo!",1392163200,17,2365,4.2657657657657655

I am serious, unless you are fresh out the box, maybe 13 years old or so, your life probably far exceeds the weak emotional plea of this gibberish.

It is not epic in any way...dialog is obnoxious trite and without merit, adding nothing of substance to the tale. And to make out like she could fly Russian and Chinese spacecraft is preposterous. Yes, it is science FICTION, and you must suspend belief, but this movie asks for a LOT of suspending. Sorry. Ain't buying it. And the cheap ploy about her daughter makes the whole thing seem like a sleezy hooker attempting to play on the heartstrings of an unsuspecting john. I felt dirty after watching this, kind of like Al Gore must be feeling now that Global Warming has been exposed as a hoax and our world is entering a new ice age. Dirty, corrupt, filthy, nasty, sweaty, and bloated.

5878102,5,B00DY64A3U,"I had the pleasure of seeing this film during its theatrical release in 3D and have wondered just how well it would hold up on home video. After viewing it on my computer, I can say without question that this is one of the best movie experiences I've ever had, even when reduced to a smaller screen with no 3D. I had no trouble with the streaming from Amazon and the picture was in clear HD all the way.

Sandra Bullock delivers the performance of her career as an astronaut caught in a disaster with seemingly no hope of rescue. George Clooney is also quite good as the commander of the mission who along with Bullock, must leave their destroyed shuttle in order to reach the International Space Station.

This film clocks in at under 90 minutes (not including credits) and it does not let you go for a minute. Even during the quiet times, there is the relentless pressure that is constantly being cranked up as Bullock and Clooney must race the clock to get back to Earth. Alfonso Cuaron co-wrote and directed this film and like many of his previous works, he manages to create a marvelous world that we inhabit with these wonderful characters. When you consider that we only see two people alive (a third astronaut is shown, but we never see his face...entirely...) for nearly 90 minutes, it is quite remarkable just how much faith is placed in the actors. Yet with two pros like Bullock and Clooney, this is really a piece of cake for them as they effortlessly carry the film. If anything, this film really shows just how few actors can pull something this like off so easily.

The world of Gravity is one that is both familiar and yet non-existent. We have not flown space shuttles for a few years, yet according to the STS mission in the film it is set in roughly 2014/2015. The Chinese station that is mentioned does exist, but is not nearly as complete as depicted. So, Gravity takes place in an alternate world that we can certainly relate. This may be due to the fact that the script had been first written several years ago, but only now was Cuaron able to make it a reality.

The CGI is naturally compelling and excitingly rendered, but the core of Gravity is that at its heart it is an experimental film. The opening shot lasts for over 12 minutes, unbroken and completely mesmerizing as we are introduced to these characters. We also switch points of view from being far away from the action to actually seeing what's happening through Bullock's eyes. Bullock herself wears little in terms of makeup and for the first time her true age does show through, but that is an asset and not a detriment to the actress who delivers a powerful, heartfelt and incisive performance that makes you really wonder why she was not even on the short list of actresses for this role. Plus, without giving anything away, the final sequence in the film is yet another ""experimental"" effect that is really quite profound when you understand what the director had in mind.

I realize that some people will not like this movie and I can understand why with all the hype about how it cannot live up to those expectations. It didn't help that I read a critic's review comparing Bullock's performance to that of Rene Marie Falconetti in ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" which is arguably the greatest performance ever filmed. No, Bullock is not THAT good, but it's wonderful to see the emotions cascade across her face. And even the tacked-on bit of background to Bullock's character about her daughter manages to pay off later in the film. There is hardly a false note or any sense of a wasted shot, Cuaron does the seemingly impossible by directing a film that includes everything that is needed and not one thing more.

I cannot say if this is the best film of 2013 since I have not seen all the nominees. However, this film is a true game-changer in terms of just how to create an action/disaster film. I have little doubt that big-budget CGI films that are in the planning stages are taking lessons from how to create a true thrill ride from this movie. To me, Gravity is more than just a great thrill ride however, I actually felt like I had never seen a film before while I was gripping the arms of my chair, a very rare feeling indeed.",1392163200,5,4228,4.520261437908497

The story isn't very compelling or deep (though it is still a good story about life and overcoming adversity) but the visuals of this movie make the adventure wonderful.

Now, reviewing this movie as it is offered through streaming.
-  I am not convinced that the quality even at HD is the same as a blu-ray (but the blu-ray isn't available yet so I can't compare it)
- The sound mixing is a little off (it seems background sounds and music overpower vocals, admittedly this will vary depending on the kind of sound system you have in your homes)
- The movie in 2D seems flat (I know, strange huh) for someone who has never seen the movie it might be fine, but after seeing it twice in theaters in 3D and experiencing the full immersion experience and the explosive scenes that really pull you in, the 2D simply doesn't have that same impact. This movie was clearly made for 3D.

It is Sandra Bullock ,That I am taking one star away from the movie for . Sandra is great do not get me wrong and plays the part well as anyone else . He physical shape is outstanding I would and still vote her best legs of 2013/2014 . I seen her on a interview when the movie hit the theaters and she spoke of how in shape she had to get . It shows greatly .
Okay the subtraction of the star and would only be only  a 1/2 star . The reason is i grew up with her playing in for lack of better term slapstick comedies with little to no plot and for lack of better term B rated. Every time this movie came to a serious part or a emotional high point I could not help or wait for her to do that snorting from Miss congeniality.  Maybe I am picky or just to old to enjoy this movie with out fresh actors .
I say buy it, enjoy it, if you can get over waiting for a snort to happen then you will truly enjoy both actors . If you like to see a woman in her later years with such a well defined body tone then this to is for you there is nothing sexual about the film . I tell you in closing the ex husband of hers Jessie James was his name you sure blew it  As Sandra has come of age and hope to see her in another drama soon now I am over the slap stick movies of her past  .

 I don't.  ( see ""Mission to Mars"" for a more realistic view of what a jetpack can and can't do)
Could they not have had a launch sequence to show how great George Clooney is instead of just telling him how great he is for the first ten minutes ?
Think they leave poorly trained rookies on their own, as if she was the only person who could install a circuit card in the HST ?
With three people outside, again working on the most important instrument in history, would two of them be screwing around ?

Where did the crews of the space stations go leaving their lifeboats behind ? (missed a bit of dialogue, explained in comments )
This movie had messages.
 They were :
Space is too dangerous for people.
People are too stupid to be in space.
Be glad and feel justified for ditching the most sophisticated spacecraft in history, and depending on Russian 1960's tin cans to get around.
Sheesh.
Just compare the depiction of astronauts in this film to that in the classic ""Armageddon"" and shed a tear for our heroic space program, that teters on the edge of existence.",1392076800,7,1432,4.534883720930233

5878118,5,B00DY64A3U,"We are in front of an original artistc proposal. Cuaron has made a film about the outer space without aliens of creatures from other galaxies. It's a very short tale about a terrible accident when the things come out of control. And the only possibility for surviving overcomes by far the theory from the books.

Bullock and Clooney alone in atmosphere zero. Communications breakdown and all this mess; you count with your knowledge and your surviving instinct. The film is far from falling into evocations or cynical comments. Houston we are blind is all what you'll hear; like a leit motive.

Sandra Bullock (I knew about her for the first time as Lenina Huxley in ""Demolition man"" another science fiction film) has made - at least to my mind- her best performance of her succesful artistic career. She shows us her weakness, despair, anguish, demons and limitations and never plays the role of a superwoman (Dislike the charismatic Rippley -S. Weaver- in Alien's saga, for instance) against all the odds.

Kudos for this singular script, for the overwhelming artistic direction, for the edition, for the brilliant special effects.

Pushing the boundaries of ultra real the technical perfection of Gravity is beyond reason, the full IMAX experience literally had you holding your seat. Beyond the tactile feel of the film, the ultra realism in movement and scope, never has space really felt so empty, hollow and dangerous and terrifying.

Logically however, the character haw six months training with NASA and jumps from the shuttle to three different space stations none of which would be orbiting in line as portrayed in the film. Then to think that she can figure out how all these systems work from her six months in training and the fact that they are all in different languages is hard to hold down. These issues of logic will cost it the ""best film"" Oscar.

Now, why watch it? Because it's thrilling, breathtaking, terrifying and amazing. Bullock pulls off a better-than-should be performance, her and the special effects and the emotional tug keep you riveted even if you're scratching your head at the logic.

5878131,1,B00DY64A3U,"This is an appalling film, just a horror show of junk science that would have been laughable had it not been quite so bad. I am not a scientist but even I could spot the glaring mistakes. (Caution: lots of spoilers ahead) The premise behind the film is that the Russians make a hash of blowing up one of their satellites and generate a lot of lethal space junk. In real life this wouldn't pose much of a risk, since all the various space stations and satellites are in totally different orbits. No matter, we'll chalk this down to artistic licence.

That would be all right if the plot were at least half plausible. It isn't. Sandra Bullock plays a scientist who, with just six months' training, is allowed to work on a space shuttle. She and George Clooney and an Indian scientist are repairing a broken piece of equipment when disaster! The space debris from the shattered satellite wreaks havoc. But this is special movie debris, so it arcs languidly over the horizon, clearly visible, and strikes the shuttle at perhaps 500 miles an hour. In real life it would be travelling at about 24,000 miles an hour. Clooney and Bullock make their way over to a Russian space craft that just happens to be nearby but wouldn't you know it? The only remaining escape pod can't be used because its parachute is partially deployed. The two of them try to get into the station anyway but get tangled up in the ropes and then Clooney wanders off into space to die, wisecracking all the way. Bullock fights her way into the Russian craft and makes her way to the escape pod, ignoring the small gouts of fire that appear before her. And of course the conflagration spreads and she is forced to escape in space pod that is almost out of fuel so she can make her way to a Chinese space station around the corner with its own escape pod and and and it descends into complete incoherence. You don't know what the film wants to say. Bullock bounces off so many space craft and pulls off so many highly implausible feats that it feels like Indiana Jones.

After  finally  seeing  the  movie ,  in  3 - D ,  which  the  ones  I'd  heard  the  reviews  from  had  only  seen  it  on  a  regular  screen ,  I'd  realized  they  had  missed  the  point  of  the  movie .

Gravity ,  in  my  opinion ,  was  never  meant  to  be  Apollo 13  or  2001 : A  Space  Odyssey .... it  was  meant  to  be  Gravity !!  No ,  the  storyline  was  not  complex ,  nor  did  I  grasp  some  deep  philosophical  meaning ... but  I  enjoyed  it  from  the  get  go .

5878144,5,B00DY64A3U,"Although this movie is stunning in a visual way with great acting and thrilling action produced by intense situations, I think only a few catch the real spiritual meaning behind it.  The movie consists of only two actors and is set entirely in space.  This simplicity behind it helps intensify the spiritual emphasis by eliminating distractions usually found in most movies.  There are no meaningless gun fights, perverse killings, and aliens monsters set out  to destroy the human race.  Instead the setting consists of two astronauts floating in the calmness of space attempting to repair a satellite while a visually stunning large earth looms silently below.  The calmness violently comes to an end  when an accident sends debris racing toward the astronauts and their space shuttle at over 50,000 mile per hour.  I don't want to give too much away, but the movie has one thrilling emotionally charged action scene after another.

The main underlying plot consists of one character Ryan Stone (played by Sandra Bullock) that goes through spiritual awakening through times of intense suffering and pain.  As the movie progresses, you find out in small pieces that Ryan is a emotionally tormented soul from her recent experiences on Earth; which could represent the human race in general.  The cold empty space the movie takes place in could also symbolize  the emptiness that exists without the incredible creation of life we all take for granted.

At one point Ryan decides to give up and peacefully accept her fate and eventual death.  Something most of us have experienced at one time or another in our lives.  I personally found this scene to be intensely peaceful.  This scene expressed how life at times can be intense emotional or physical suffering and death as a peaceful end to it.  At the brink of death and desperation, Ryan has a vision or spiritual awakening (also comparable to what Natives experience while hallucinating on Peyote) and decides not to give up on life and make her way back to Earth.

Spoiler alert:

When Ryan makes it back to Earth, her space pod crashes into the ocean.  She barely escapes to the surface after removing her heavy space suit and most of her clothing.  The scene very much portrays this as a baptism, or washing away of her past and being reborn again.  She swims to the beach with a new intense gratitude for life.  This scene is very powerful and gives the audience a new appreciation for this incredible beautiful planet that gives us all the scared gift of life.

5878148,1,B00DY64A3U,"REVIEW DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS.

The reason I was disappointed is that I was given the impression that finally, after years of mediocre and silly space flicks, we were going to get a real space movie. A movie that was designed to make you think, and a movie that rises philosophical questions about what it is to be human in space (2001: A space masterpiece). In addition, I was given the impression that for once, the science and physics were going to be on target, even though a certain level of artistic license was to be expected. We got non of that. None. The plot is so thin and far fetched, right from the get go I was mildly annoyed about having to swallow the concept in order to enjoy the movie. The dialogue is so cheesy, unintelligent, cringe worthy and poorly written, it is reminiscent of what we were served in the utterly ridiculous film ""Armageddon"".

That's right: Despite all of its CGI glory, superb looking imagery, and attempts at creating the illusion of realism, at the end of the day ""Gravity"" is no less silly than ""Armageddon"". It certainly has the looks of a better movie, but it doesn't have the depth of a better movie. In fact, I'll take ""Armageddon"" over ""Gravity"" any day if only for the entertainment value of ridiculous cheese. The words uttered by the characters in this flick are supposed to be those of astronauts - not your average truck driver. Maybe they should have made this a little bit clearer, cause they almost had me fooled. The astronauts portrayed in ""Gravity"" are in every respect as far from the real deal as you could possibly get.

The movie starts off with Dr. Ryan Stone - a suicidal medical engineer with six months of space training - working on the Hubble telescope(!). There. Let that sink in, cause the standard has now been set with regards to the level of realism one can expect for the remainder of this ridiculous space melodrama's running time. There is so much wrong with this film, I don't have the time or will to put my mind through every little detail one more time. As for scientific accuracy, sure, there are a lot of inaccuracies at play here. Countless, actually. But one scene in particular completely took me out of the experience: The Clooney exit - the most unnecessary death in a movie ever. When Kowaski and Stone finally get to the ISS, they bounce down the side until Stone gets her foot tangled in the backup Soyuz's parachute wires. Kowalsky is still connected to Stone by a tether, but he unclips himself to save her, and floats off into the void. At this point, the two astronauts' velocities relative to the ISS was zero - thanks to that parachute wire, they had really parked there. So literally all Stone had to do was tug Kowalsky over to her, and they both could have found a temporary safe house in the ship. In the movie we see Kowalsky completely nonsensically being pulled away by some mysterious force unknown to real life science. That scene is the equivalent of someone jumping off a cliff and falling upwards.

This is just one of the many, many annoyances that made gravity a mediocre watch. Oh, and the utterly pathetic attempts at emotionally manipulating the audience fell extremely flat and seemed to be directed toward a five year old. So they have a script that lacks everything, but figure throwing a dead kid into the mix will somehow make me forget that? Puke! I don't know what's wrong with all the critics who are apparently so easily duped. I'll end this on a positive note: ""Gravity"" does indeed contain some truly amazing special effects.",1389744000,49,3551,4.613924050632911

  Gravity has great visual effects though not all together accurate.  Overall it could have been an outstanding movie.  I think the movie would have been better with the story starting on earth with selection of the crew and building up of each character.  The Bullock character would have never passed the NASA mental screening allowing her into space.
  Once in space Bullock goes between periods of being a knowledgable astronaut and having mental meltdowns.  Her gasping, whimpering and crying are hugely annoying and look more like a housewife from the suburbs than a highly trained astronaut.

I finally connected my Nvidia 3D glass system and watched the Blu-Ray 3D version of the movie. And what a treat! I actually wouldn't recommend watching the entire movie in 3D, just the first a few minutes. You get the feeling that you're right there floating in Earth's orbit and the vast sea of stars behind it. You become submersed in the scene. It's very calming and exciting at the same time. Highly recommended.

Original Review (January, 2014):
It's the way this story is told through visual effects and great acting (Sandra Bullock) that puts the audience in place of the character, terrified in the cold darkness of space with the scintillating backdrop of Earth. It's the ultimate contrast in art: life below and utter nothingness above. It's like the movie has turned heaven and hell upside down.

But sorry, this is no ""Apollo 13"". The movie jumps immediately into the crisis, there is no backstory, there is no build up, and you aren't given the time or opportunity to become acquainted with, and therefore care about, the characters. What you have are moments of intense, heart-pounding action, followed by long... long... very long... drawn-out scenes of Sandra Bullock crying, whispering, hyperventilating, gasping, and talking to herself. I found myself fast forwarding several times, just to move things along, and I didn't miss any of the story; that's how prolonged it is! To her credit, I thought Sandra's acting was commendable, although I found her character to be annoyingly high-strung and almost flaky, repeating words and phrases, stuttering, etc. It's almost as if she had NO idea that going into space and going on space walks was going to be dangerous, trying work. Clooney's part is too brief, he's the only appeal in the whole thing, with his cute smile and crinkly eyes... ah well.

5878154,5,B00DY64A3U,"Sometimes it is hard to separate your true feelings for a film and the bountiful opinions of other, more vocal critics.  Walking into Gravity, I was nearly set up for sheer disappointment.  The buzz surrounding the film and the near unanimous raves for it made it appear to be one of those overhyped gargantuan films that leave the viewer with nowhere to go but down.  That was my biggest fear tonight, that I was going to wind up feeling betrayed by the early ink and ultimately have my theater experience dampened.

Gravity does not disappoint.

I don't really know where to start, or even how to construct this review at all.  There is hardly anyway to spoil the film for someone who hasn't seen it.  The only real question that one will have walking in is whether or not Sandra Bullocks character dies, and Im not about to reveal that answer, but outside of that there isn't anything I can say that will lessen the impact of the film itself.  The fact remains that this film is a thrill ride from start to finish and that it uses the most of every single frame in play, milking each scene for optimum effect.  The plot is simple.  Debris from an accidental missile attack sends waves of danger to a group of astronauts and essentially causes a lot of issues for the initial impacts sole survivor, Doctor Ryan Stone.  This initial wave of debris hits about ten minutes into the movie and from that point forward, the impact is felt.  It ripples from frame to frame, scene to scene, like the monstrous approach of a tsunami.

My hand hurts, because my wife was squeezing it for the entire ninety minutes.

Heaps of praise have been shovels upon the films director, Alfonso Cuaron, and the star, Sandra Bullock, and that praise is deserved one-hundred fold.  Cuaron is a visionary director, one that understands the fabric of film and how to present it in a way that transports you.  I saw this in Children of Men, and he does it again here, to possibly even greater effect.  Every aspect of this movie is presented in a way that entices the senses.  From the remarkable imagery (the way that empty space is captured here is breathtaking) to the effective use of sound (and lack thereof), Gravity completely takes over your body.

It lives in you.

In all honesty, I left the theater feeling like my senses had been heightened.  Sound was much crisper and the air around me was much clearer.  It affected me physically, which is something I never expected.

My hat truly goes off to Sandra Bullock though.  Without her dedicated performance, this film would have failed miserably.  As much as this is about the technical aspect of things, and as much as this is Cuarons movie, Bullock had a lot on her shoulders, and she makes this movie so incredibly human and intimate despite the grandeur of it all.  From an outside perspective, it may appear that she has nothing to do but panic (and she does a lot of that), but she slowly yet surely develops a beautifully fleshed out character who embodies the core themes of this film; namely the very will to survive.  Her solemn confession about her daughter paints a dark picture almost upfront, but she chips away at that density the reveal a woman renewed by her bleak circumstances to find the will to live again.  The film uses her (and she in turn uses to film) to completely flip the direness of it all on its head to unveil an uplifted spirit and delivers to the audience one of the most engrossing tales of internal and external survival Ive ever seen put to film.

Many critics have already heralded this as a masterpiece.  This year is so rich already, and Ive only seen a handful of films, but I won't hesitate to thrust that label on this film.  It truly is a marvelous piece of art, and it is easily the best film Ive seen so far this year.  The great thing about Gravity is that it isn't just a masterpiece in a singular aspect, but from every angle this film is nearly perfect.",1389484800,4,3938,4.518361581920904

Most movie lovers can remember seeing a film for the first time that really got their attention. Usually it was in a real movie theater. For me it was ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" The juxtaposition of a flung femur bone transfiguring into a space shuttle lining up to dock at an orbiting station, all to the backdrop of classical music was mind blowing to this science fiction lover. A few year later, sitting in a large theater I was again mesmerized by a giant space ship moving slowly across dark space. ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" had a new technical trick at its disposal. Dolby Surround Sound. A new generation will likely have ""Gravity"" to look back on. Yes, it's that good.

Director Alfonso Cuaron (""Children of Men""), who also wrote the screenplay with his son Jonas, has managed to provide an electrifying thriller with a basic story. A flight crew headed by Lt. (a lieutenant, really?) Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) have been sent to repair the Hubble Telescope. The scientist in charge of the repairs is the ever-so-serious Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock). There are no other actors who have any role of substance other than the voice of Ed Harris at Mission Control early on.

In a quick turn of events, it is learned that the Russians have destroyed one of their spy satellites. The explosion has set off a chain reaction of debris hurtling through space taking out other satellites along the way. With only minutes to react, Kowalski's crew attempt to get the shuttle out of orbit. They don't. Now in survival mode, Kowalski and Stone must figure out how to get back to Earth. This becomes even more complicated, as radio communication with Mission Control has been severed.

Cuaron provides Sandra Bullock an opportunity to show her acting range and she responds with a performance that will be remembered for a long time. Stone's early panic, as the space debris knocks her away from Kowalski and the shuttle, comes across to the audience. We see the terror in her eyes, in her breathing and in the fogging helmet shield. The other star of the film is Cuaron's cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki and the visual and special effects department. It is the most amazing thing I think I've ever seen on screen. And yes, see it now. Don't wait for this movie to come to you by Netflix. And yes, see it in 3D. I pick and choose when to spend an extra $3 or $4 dollars on 3D and I made the right decision here.

Gravity has several meanings. The most used and obvious one for this movie has to do with the force of bodies falling toward Earth. But gravity also is defined as a serious or critical nature. Also, serious or dignified behavior. All apply. Cuaron and his team will likely need a truck to load nominations come Oscar time. Don't miss it.

BLU RAY UPDATE: I recently acquired a 3D television and having swooned over this film (3D) in theaters last fall, I couldn't think of a better movie to test out the display.  It didn't disappoint.  The package includes 3D and 2D options (separate discs) and a DVD.  It also includes a digital HD (Ultraviolet) download.  The special features are on the 2D disc.

I'm not surprised that the film retains the awe-inspiring luster of the theatrical version.  It comes with 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The 3D, much like the big screen version uses the extra dimension to create depth of space which is certainly appropriate for a film which takes place in space orbiting around Earth.  The color and sometimes lack of, is excellent along with deep, dark blacks.  Shadows are in proper contrast and detail is remarkable.  Check out hair stubble on Clooney's face and watch Bullock as she strains, once reaching the temporary safety of the International Space Station.  Her neck muscles stretch and relax.  Great acting and great cinematography.  I can't say enough about the 3D element here.  Frankly, I'm not a big fan as a rule.  Still there are a few that get it right (""Avatar"" and ""Hugo"" come to mind).  ""Gravity"" joins the club.  While I did not watch the 2D version from beginning to end, I did see enough to that nothing is lost other than the depth.  In either case, the discs are demo quality.

Likewise the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is flawless.  It does a perfect job handling the big collision scenes and the subwoofer certainly got a workout in that regard along with the surrounds.  But there are other elements well played out that I didn't notice as much the first time around.  First is the use of silence.  Director Cuaron and his Oscar winning sound squad have done a marvelous job, not only creating some unusual sounds but have integrated them beautifully into the various elements of the film.  One second there are loud collisions, total silence the next.  The sound of small fires starting and the whoosh of a fire extinguisher or a jet propulsion pack.  It's just incredible.  The other major element so important in the film is the soundtrack by another Oscar winner, Steven Price.  It never resorts to an overabundance of strings, but it emphasizes the emotions and terrors of the moment.  The lossless audio track handles it perfectly.  Subtitles are available in English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.

Absolutely horrible ""plot"", terrible dialog, horrible ""science"".  The ONLY thing it has going for it are the special effects, and even those aren't done right!

The movie starts off with Sandra and George outside the shuttle trying to repair the hubble telescope, with George tooling around with a jetpack just willy nilly flying around the shuttle having a good ol' time while Sandra is doing the repairs, burning his fuel up.  Oh, did I mention that Sandra isn't an astronaut?  So while they're out there, the Russians decide to shoot down one of their own satellites, and create a whole bunch of space debris, that supposedly is flying around at 20,000 mph.  Then the debris hits the shuttle and telescope, causing all sorts of chaos.

Sandra gets flung out into the darkness of space, but George comes to the rescue.

I'm tired even going through the ridiculousness of this plot in my head.  Suffice it to say that the plot is as ridiculous as Armageddon.  However, Armageddon doesn't try to take itself seriously.  You know that going in.  Gravity pretends to be smart, while being completely stupid.

All this movie is is a bunch of eye candy, and I don't even think that was all that great.  At every opportunity, they try to show off their CGI by having junk float around the cabin.  There's pens and clipboards, and when Sandra enters the Chinese space station, they even have a ping pong paddle floating around!  She manages to escape from station to station, and amazingly, was able to operate each one, in Russian and Chinese, even though she's not an astronaut.

5878161,3,B00DY64A3U,"Gravity attempts to portray what astronauts would actually encounter on space missions, how space walks would actually unfold, and the hostility of the environment of space towards anything resembling Earthling life.

 The ninety or so minutes of Gravity are the linear unfolding of a series of destructive events in the lives of Astronauts Ryan (Sandra Bullock) and Kowalski (George Clooney). Directors Alfonso Cuarns hones in on these destructive events, treating them as a single, passing moment in time. A moment of crisis.

As far as doing anything in space is ever considered routine, Gravity opens with a group of astronauts undertaking what seem to be standard, routine repairs to the outside of their ship. The tone is jovial, if not a little tense as Clooney zips around the ships vicinity with a jet pack jokingly. He wants to break the current space walk record of seventy-five minutes. But Mission Control suddenly issues a warning. A massive field of space debris is headed straight for them.

From here on, only chaos reigns as Cuarn begins to eliminate all probable positive outcomes, one by one. After the astronauts ship is destroyed beyond repair Ryan and Kowalski attempt to propel themselves a floatable distance to a space station. As they push forward through spaces vacuum, towards their beacon of hope, spaces vastness and hostility are emphasized, along with their minisculity; I hate space, says Ryan somewhat lightheartedly. This comes after she has just been precariously saved from a perpetual spinning away into deep space, a particularly claustrophobic moment of the film,or rather, a moment in the extreme of claustrophobias exact opposite.

Gravity has all the individual parts of a film rated high, near a 10, but once the parts are assembled, the whole is not equal to the parts. Even though the film is shot in space, and is set to depict a realistic portrayal of how events like these could take place, the film is really just about Ryan, a single humans struggle to survive, and then with this revelation the epic space setting becomes incidental.

Problem: Ryan is not an interesting character. She seems ill prepared for such a dangerous space mission, and when she talks about her daughter, in a moment that I assume is used to attempt to ground the film in reality by showing us the why, we don't care about her daughter. The current situation at hand is much more interesting. Including this talk about life back home was a mistake that took me out of the moment. I don't care about Earth here; I care about this amazing crisis taking place just above Earth. A space movie should emphasize themes bigger than the individual. The mission should be more important than the life of the astronaut. Simply making it back to Earth alive is not an exciting enough conclusion.

Although maybe the best of her career, Bullock still delivers a subpar portrayal of a character that is herself subpar. I loved Cuarns Children of Men and I feel here Cuarns work is great. From a technical perspective, Cuarns filmmaking is incredible, the cinematography stunning, the portrayal of space amazing, so what went wrong? Besides a storyline that fails to transcend human matters, a factor that Cuarn may have been able to gloss over under different circumstances, when a film centers on a single actor, and that actor is Sandra Bullock, to quote Yeats, Things fall apart; the center cannot hold.

5878162,3,B00DY64A3U,"Storyline: Medical Engineer, Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra) and Astronaut, Matt Kowelsky (George Clooney) set out to space walking to repair a mal functioning unit of the Hubble Telescope. While doing so, they get info from their space station Explorer, that a catastrophic stream of debris, which is a result of a Russian destroyed space shuttle is right on their way and ordered to abort their job. But before they do so, the debris hits the Explorer and the Telescope destroying both. Both the astronauts have a narrow escape and try to reach the nearest International Space Station (ISS) but find that the crew over there have already abandoned the ship sensing danger from the orbiting debris, which has already partly destroyed the same. Matt instructs Dr Ryan to use the capsule of ISS to reach the next nearest Chinese space station Tiangong and sacrifices his life to save Dr Ryan. She completely loses hope and plans to kill herself by shutting down the oxygen levels of the capsule but recoups herself thinking about the sacrifice of Matt. She somehow reaches Tiangong and propels herself to Earth through its functioning capsule just at the nick of moment before the orbiting debris once again devastates Tiangong. Dr Ryans capsule lands in a lake and she walks out on the full gravity of the Earth, a pleasure that she never thought of enjoying again.

Positives: The movie watched in 3D gives a weightless feeling to the viewer throughout. The true experience of being lost in space and the difficult situations that astronauts face betting their lives is well established. The Directors skill in screening the entire movie  with just two people and their struggle to get back to Earth alive, is commendable. Cinematography and the visual effects of living in space is excellent. Great background music.

Negatives: Viewers might get disappointed when they don't get to see any other character in the movie, and not as a great entertainer. The advanced technology could have maneuvered the shuttles out of the orbit of the 90 minute cycles of the debris and avoid impact. Absence of quantified sentiment might have brought down the expected success.

5878163,5,B00DY64A3U,"Directed by Alfonso Cuarn, from a screenplay he wrote with his son Jonas Cuarn, Gravity is an extraordinary film, on a technical level arguably one of the best films set in space ever made. It's something of a mistake to think of it as science-fiction because it's a very near future human adventure based in the reality of what is achievable today.

The plot is fairly simple:  a team of astronauts working from the space shuttle are finishing up some routine maintenance and repair work on the Hubble telescope when they receive a warning from mission control that a mishap from a Russian attempt to demolish a defunct satellite has had a cascading effect that destroyed a large number of satellites and created a growing field of debris that is now hurtling towards them. The three astronauts outside the shuttle scramble to finish up and get back inside but fail to do so before the debris field hits. The onslaught destroys the shuttle, killing everyone aboard as well as one of the suited astronauts caught outside, leaving only two survivors - veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), for whom this was to be his last space mission before retiring, and medical engineer Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), for whom this was her first time in space - tethered to each other and nothing else. To make matters worse, the destruction of key communication satellites has severed Kowalski and Stone's communication with Earth. Alone in space and cut off from any possible help from Earth, the two now must try anything they can to survive, no matter how dicey the chances for success are.

A lot of people have commented on how well done the 3D in Gravity is, and I fully concur.  Cuarn uses the 3D to excellent effect not only in terms of enhancing the reality of the action that takes place but also of creating a sense of the vastness of space, creating simultaneous feelings of distance and of proximity when the astronauts are beset by all manner of space debris.  But what really struck me about the film was Cuarn's extraordinary use of sound to create a feeling of isolation, setting out from the very beginning of the film with radio transmissions that are barely audible to make the viewer aware of just how far from Earth the astronauts actually are.  The sense of isolation and sheer aloneness is palpable throughout the film, making you feel what the characters, particularly Sandra Bullock's Ryan Stone, are feeling.  One of the most moving scenes in the film is when Ryan happens to pick up a stray radio transmission when all other communication has been lost, and she clings to the sound even though she cannot understand what's being said because it's a connection to Earth, to another human being, even if no actual communication is possible. Gravity's sound team of Glenn Freemantle & Niv Adiri (both did the sound for Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours), and Skip Lievsay (True Grit, No Country For Old Men) have already been nominated for a Satellite Award for Best Sound Editing & Mixing and are certainly worthy of an Academy Award nomination when the time comes.

Another, more subtle, use of sound was casting Ed Harris as the voice of mission control. Harris, as some may recall, was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Flight Director Gene ""Failure is not an option!"" Kranz in Apollo 13, another extremely well done film set in space, and not coincidentally, involving a mission gone wrong and a race to find a way to survive.

5878165,2,B00DY64A3U,"I agree with most of the negative reviews: amazing digital effects, little plot.  It's one long disaster-escape-sequence, not any sort of great literature.

The nits:

Let me preface the first one by saying that the filmmakers went to great lengths to get the physics right, with glaring exceptions: you can't leap from one spacecraft to another one that's in a different orbit.  Even if you could, you wouldn't get there by pointing your jetpack toward it and blasting away, you'd most likely go in the other direction.  But I give the fimmakers a pass on these.  No, what bothered me was the long opening shot, where the camera is in orbit, with nothing but the earth and stars in view.  The earth moves beneath us, as in the videos we have all seen shot from space - and the stars are perfectly still!  Duh!  In orbit, you would see the stars moving at approximately the same rate as the earth.  This wasn't an exaggeration the filmmakers needed for a plot device - it was just a blatant miss.  After that, I spent the whole film looking for other dimwitted stuff, rather than concentrating on the story, thin as it was.

The other nit (and spoiler alert if you haven't seen it yet):

The Clooney character is Mister Capability, rescuing Bullock half a dozen times from certain death.  And then suddenly, when the two are hanging together by a thread, he comes to the ridiculous conclusion that she will be better off without him, and detaches himself to float off and die in the depths of space.  If the plot depended on his self-sacrifice, they failed to make a convincing case.  In The Perfect Storm, Clooney's offing himself at least made some sense.  Here, it made none.",1387670400,10,1678,4.614864864864865

without the 3-D. I saw it twice in 3-D at a theater. The first time, the
realism in 3-D was just overwhelming. It moves fast. I expected to have
nightmares, so I took a pill. No joke. The second time I saw it, a week later,
I was able to connect with the characters.

And that's the thing, the spiritual beauty of the characters matches the
terrifying realism of the context. The catastrophic shock, the shredded
illusion of safety, the suffocating sense of alienation, are a window
into their souls.

  ""Home, home where I wanted to go
  Home, home where I wanted to go
  Home, home where I wanted to go""

If you've ever known someone with Meniere's disease, this movie will strike
a chord. On earth, if we can't control our movement, it often means we are
immobile, we can't start moving. But in space, it means we can't stop moving.
It's like you're dreaming of flying, and then the dream turns into a nightmare,
and you just keep smashing into things and getting pounded by them. And you
can't make it stop.

I've never known anyone who went catatonic, but Sandra Bullock is all too
believable as someone whose mind shuts down from sheer disorientation.
Outwards, backwards, downwards, into the void forever.

I say that because its about 30 seconds out of 90 minutes of Oscar-worthy
performance by both actors in this movie. I really needed the second show
to appreciate this. The characters seem like people you know, yet with the
eloquence of good actors who are pouring their hearts into their roles.
Its said the eyes are the window of the soul, but in this movie, its their
entire faces, their expressions, their words, their body language. All of it.

This is a movie with basically just 2 actors, and Sandra Bullock and George
Clooney make a superlative team. Their characters don't have a personal
relationship. They have a spiritual relationship. Its easy to miss if you're
not looking for it. Especially George Clooney's character, because without
the panic, he's able to feel and express the quiet complexities, the wisdom
and compassion. Each actor has half the spectrum, and they fit perfectly.

Beyond the actors are the hundreds of other people who helped create this.
The best way I've found to learn about how much they contributed, on a
4 1/2 year project, is to search the web for interviews. Some critics have
called Gravity a landmark, a visionary milestone in movie making. When
Avatar came out on blu-ray it had 8 hours of making-of. I hope Gravity has
8 hours of making-of when it comes out on disc.

About the musical score, let me just say it evokes this movie. Its one of
those soundtracks where when you hear the music, the movie plays on the
inside of your eyelids, and suddenly it gets hard to speak.

About the directing, I have definitely placed Alfonso Cuaron's other movies
on my wish-list. He brings out the genius in others.

Sometime's, a labor of love turns out to be that person's ruin. Gravity is the
exact opposite. Its a labor of love, from a lot of people, that turned out to
be a mind-boggling achievement in every aspect of the film-making art.",1387324800,15,3193,4.631205673758865
5878168,5,B00DY64A3U,"The pre-release buzz on this film was approaching hyperbole. People were comparing it to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Avatar"". Calling it a masterpiece and a game changer. I was like, wow, this is the Hollywood hype machine going into full throttle. Hey, I like hype as much as the next guy. I love it when people get excited about going to the movies because some cultural phenomenon is tearing it up at the box office. Ultimately, I didn't  buy into any of the hype. I just wanted to see the film.

First of all, this was one of the best 3D experiences I've ever had. I've had quite a few. The finest of the lot would be ""Avatar"" and ""The Hobbit"" HFR 3D. ( I know a lot of people hate that high frame rate, 48 frames per second process that The Hobbit utilized but it made the 3D and C.G.I. remarkable ). I would place Gravity in a close 3rd place behind those two and in front of the great 3D in ""The Life of Pi"" and ""Hugo"".

The sense of depth in Gravity was amazing. The sense of weightless floating was palpable. Just as a space simulator, this film is a remarkable achievement of the first rank. This will win the Academy Award for best cinematography. Some people can't grasp how difficult some of the work was to do. This film should be recognized for the breathtaking visual feast that's on display here. The sound design was also extraordinary and deserves the highest praise.

Now we get to the narrative, the story, the plot... well now... Some astronauts are working in the Earth's orbit and then.... SOMETHING GOES WRONG! That's it, that's the whole plot. I doubt that's a spoiler of any kind. It might have been interesting if nothing went wrong? I don't know, that would be an avant-garde space film! But everyone knows something has to go wrong in order for the ""drama"" to commence. And something goes wrong again and again, every 10 minutes to keep the drama moving along. This is a very straight up, bare bones thriller structure. Which is perfectly legitimate, perhaps even showcasing bravery from the creative team, to just write a simple space thriller and then focus on the technical details, the simulation experience, not on the narrative.

Maybe that's why I deeply admire the film on a technical level but I don't love it. To add layers to the simple story, the film dives head first into a lot of symbolism. SPOILERS AHEAD. The endless umbilical cord imagery in the film when the astronauts are constantly entangled in one thing after another. Sandra Bullock floating like a fetus. The Earth itself as the mother of humanity and the force of gravity that draws it's wayward astronaut children back to the planet. How about Sandra Bullock emerging from the ocean at the end, like the first human or the first creature to crawl/walk on land. All the evolution imagery. Life began as stardust that floated to the Earth, was born in the oceans, then crawled onto land.  Hey, maybe this film is deep? Or maybe not.

The biggest problem is that Gravity relies too much on contrived plot points to further the tension and drama. A fire breaks out here, a spacesuit rips, a space station explodes ( more than once ), oxygen is constantly running out. Yeah, it's really hard to survive in space. Life in space is impossible as the movie states. But why all this artificial drama? One problem after another? It felt like the story was stuck on wheels that couldn't naturally build momentum, the writers/director just pushed it every so often... then they'd push it again and again. It was forced and contrived, not natural storytelling. Eventually it started to get so ridiculous, that when Bullock's space capsule crashed into the ocean and she escapes into the water... I thought for sure a shark would swim by and Sandra would have to punch it in the eye and fight it off!

Director Alfonso Cuaron, who co-wrote Gravity with his son... should be commended for not succumbing to Hollywood studio pressure to force Gravity to be more than what it is. The studio gave such helpful suggestions like, ""Cut to Houston and show NASA scrambling to save the astronauts"". ""Cut to flashbacks of Sandra Bullock's life on Earth with her daughter"". ""Develop a love story between the George Clooney and Sandra Bullock characters"". All genius suggestions...NOT! Thankfully Cuaron was able to stick to his guns. He could have padded the running time of the film with extraneous material, but he was wise not to go that route.

At the same time, it felt like a missed opportunity, because Cuaron could have gone in the opposite direction and made an avant-garde cinematic experience like 2001 or something down that road. Instead we get a conventionally structured thriller but one that takes place in space and uses the most incredible special effects and 3D.

Still, I would be a grouchy individual indeed if I didn't give this film 5 stars, just as a cinematic tour de force. Definitely a must see regardless of any griping about what could have been. A special and unique achievement.",1387324800,9,4992,4.675398633257403

5878171,5,B00DY64A3U,"Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n's latest work ""Gravity"" is about two astronauts lost in outer space. The simple premise is not only intriguing but plausible, and it is also very ambitious as the film virtually features only two characters. (It's three if you include the voice of ground control by Ed Harris, a nod to Ron Howard's ""Apollo 13."")

Having lost their space shuttle, two astronauts - Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Lieutenant Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) - have to figure out how to come back to the earth alive, while floating in the outer space. For Dr. Stone, who is a medical engineer, this is her first mission in space, which makes the situation even more difficult.

The storyline, especially its second half, is admittedly less convincing than the brilliant first part (the script written by Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n and his son Jon&aacute;s Cuar&oacute;n), but ""Gravity"" remains a thrilling ride throughout thanks to the stunning visuals and strong acting from Sandra Bullock.

Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n focuses more on the characters and the zero-G environment that is harsh to them, than the action sequences involving spaceships. Like Duncan Jones' ""Moon,"" ""Gravity"" is a sci-fi drama (with a more plausible premise) with an emphasis on characters, and it is brilliantly done.",1386892800,,1299,5.265700483091788

5878173,1,B00DY64A3U,"A lot of people who did not like this film stated it is not scientifically accurate or said that certain details concerning how the astronauts acted was erroneous as well.  There was even a person who wrote a review saying the film was so unrealistic because, when Sandra Bullock stripped out of her spacesuit, she was not wearing a diaper.  To those people, I say get a life and stop looking to Hollywood for realism.  It is a fantasy world.  It does not need to be realistic.  It just has to entertain you.

I, certainly, do not give this film one star for the reasons stated above.  Go read a book or go visit NASA if you want to learn about space.  I just thought the final product that I viewed was boring.  It definitely was not entertaining.  I'm glad this film was only an hour and a half in length.

The special effects is the only decent characteristic about the film, but it is not enough to save this clunker.  My biggest issue is that, during most of the film, the viewer is hearing Bullock panting.  I could bet that there was more of her panting throughout the film than there was of her talking.  It seemed that pronounced.  She starts almost five minutes into the film and never stops.  It gets annoying after awhile.

Let me preface my comments by saying that I think she is a good actress and I have liked many of her other films.  Unfortunately, this film will not be one of the ones that I will ever watch again.  Why?  Because it was that boring.  I just would have preferred a better bad guy than space garbage.  ""Oh No!!!.  Garbage is coming towards us.""

Gravity. It pulls us down. It places us solidly where we are. It defines us. There is no escaping the reality...although sometimes we try. Sometimes all we need to do is let go and let gravity bring us home...

Questions that the film conjured in me:
Where do we escape?
What causes us to awaken?
How do we pick up ourselves against the weight of the world and learn to walk again?
Who are we really when we are stripped down to our core?
To feel the pain, the fear, the loss of dreams amidst each breath.
To try again.

5878178,5,B00DY64A3U,"""Gravity"" is the latest in a long tradition of films in which survival in a hostile environment is a series of hops from one slightly habitable sanctuary to another.  It can be in a desert, underwater, or in space, but the premise is the same: one person against all odds tests her own mettle to (hopefully) survive and in doing so, come out a better person in the end.  In the case of Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), it's a form of rebirth.

Stone is on her first mission aboard the Space Shuttle Explorer with veteran astronauts Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and Shariff Dasari (Phaldut Sharma). It's not long before things go horribly awry in the form of a Russian missile strike on a defunct satellite, which triggers a recurring boogeyman: floating debris pierces everything in its path every 90 minutes.  The cloud of debris is catastrophic, and it's not long before Stone is on her own doing her best to survive.  But does she want to?  Lurking in Stone's past is the death of her daughter due to an accident, and she has been sleepwalking through life up to this point.  Kowalski (one of the few characters in Stone's literal universe) challenges her on this point.

And so begins a desperate struggle for Stone, alone and only partially trained, in the most hostile environment imaginable.  She battles the triple threat of asphyxiation, hypothermia, and insanity. On the third point ""Gravity"" distinguishes itself from other films, led by Bullock's excellent acting as a woman under extreme pressure.

Bullock (nearly 50, if you can believe it) is stripped to her core, both emotionally and physically, until there is nothing left.  And then, like a babe, must struggle her way out of tight spaces and cramped airlocks in a battle to return home.  Expertly shot and breathtakingly choreographed, ""Gravity"" is a thrilling spectacle in 3D.  It's a heavy subject, but well worth the ride.",1385856000,274,1897,4.854037267080745

5878182,5,B00DY64A3U,"When I initially read about the movie Gravity coming to theaters, I had no doubt it would be an interesting film.  However, for me, it was not a must see.  I grouped it that selection of films that I would see in the theater if friends wanted to go see it, or I happened to be downtown one day, with time to spare, and the film was about the play.  Once I saw it was only 90 minutes along (an unheard of running time in this era of 2  - 3 hour films), it move higher on my list since the time investment would not be that great.  All I can say is that I am incredibly glad I did go see this film on the big screen.

  Starring mega-wattage actors George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, Gravity is the story of a routine Space Shuttle mission that goes horribly wrong when a Russian attempt to dispose of one of their own satellites is botched, triggering a chain reaction of debris that threatens everything in orbit and devastates the Shuttle.  Clooney and Bullock are the only survivors remaining and their desperate goal is to find a way to outlast the debris storm and find a passage back to Earth using any of the available means that have not yet been destroyed.

  The wonderment of space, the race against time, and the feeling of claustrophobia are common thematic elements since the beginning of cinema.  In the hands of a lesser director, they could be mishandled and come off as badly clich&eacute;d.  Fortunately, the expert hands of Alfonso Cuaron (Children of Men and Y Tu Mama Tambien) manages to hit the right chord with every narrative development.  The breathless tension remains high throughout the film and Cuaron takes no shortcuts in showcasing the challenges the survivors face.

  The acting is first rate in this film.  Its not hard to see Sandra Bullock receiving an Academy Award nomination for her performance.  What also helps strengthen Gravity is that the science in the film, for the most part, is sound.  Too many space-based films play fast and loose with the laws of physics.  Yet, with the exception of a couple of deviations made for narrative purposes, Gravity remains true.

  The final aspect of this film that will captivate audiences is the stunning visual experience.  Gravity is one of those films that needs to be experienced on the big screen and, if possible, in 3-D.  It is a piece of cinema that knows how to use 3-D in service of the story, instead of as a gimmick to distract the audience.  The experience of this visual drama is one that will stay with you long after you leave the theater as the scenes replay in your mind over and over again.",1385164800,3,2593,4.518279569892473
5878183,4,B00DY64A3U,"This movie was about space accident but the cause, the acting and the directing made it original and much more interesting than others of the same genre.
Sandra Bullock and George Clooney's acting were engaging. They made me care for their characters. I was scared when they were in danger. I was relieved when they were safe. Sandra held my attention through the whole 90 minutes.
Director Alfonso Cuarn made the picture flow smoothly.

The suspense was gripping from the begginning till the end.

The Cinematography was beautiful. It showed eye-catching images of the Earth from space.

Of course it had logical holes that were bigger than houses. They did annoy me but I still enjoyed the film.

According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this movie as of November 22, 2013:

Release Date: October 4, 2013
Production Budget: $100 million
Domestic:  $242,199,000
+ Foreign:  $293,600,000
= Worldwide:  $535,799,000

So, it's popular both in North America and overseas. So far, it took in 435 million dollars more than its production cost. That's a gigantic amount.

In short, it's certainly worth watching.

P.S.
I'm very interested in the survival chance of astronauts in a space accident like this. So, I did a research and found some major problems that made this movie impossible to happen in real life.

1. ""There is no way to go hopping from one space station to another so easily. You can't just look around and see another spacecraft and then get there by simply pointing in the general direction with some soft landing jets and a fire extinguisher."" This is quoted from the article named ""What Does A Real Astronaut Think Of 'Gravity'?"" by Garrett Reisman, Former NASA Astronaut, posted on Forbes dot com.

2. ""How Hubble (350mi up) ISS (230mi up) & a Chinese Space Station are all in sight lines of one another."" This is a tweet by  famous astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson.
In other words, if China had a space station orbiting, it was impossible for Sandra to see it because it was out of her view.

3. ""Space jetpacks really do exist! They are called MMUs (Manned Maneuvering Units)... Even so, they are not practical for most missions and were retired almost 30 years ago.
They are also not a replacement for a ... spaceship.... Space is big! You can't just backpack around it the way you backpack around Europe. It would be difficult for Kowalsky to retrieve Stone, let alone use his jetpack's nitrogen farts to reach another spacecraft...""

3D tickets at the theaters aren't cheap these days but Gravity is definitely worth seeing.  For many movies, the whole 3-D part is something of a gimmick, but not so much in this one.  Yes, there are a few of those stock film shots when something flies by your head, but in general, you find yourself forgetting the fact its 3-D as you get absorbed in the story.  And the story is absorbing.

You shouldn't expect a large cast on this one.  In fact, it's a tiny cast.  The vast majority of the story (no spoilers) takes place in space.  But unlike Apollo 13 and other space movies, there is no real development of mission control.  Instead you get what's essentially a real time story about a horrific accident in space and the efforts of the crew to survive.

George Clooney plays a great role.  He's a career astronaut and an experienced hand.  On the surface he's a bit of a clown. Underneath he's all business. Using a mix of jokes and distractions, he tries to maintain the calm among the crew while desperately struggling to get control of the situation.

Sandra Bullock is the scientist in the crew.  She doesn't seem to be too thrilled about being in space but she's there to do an important job, and so she tolerates it.  If you've seen Sandra in other movies, expect something a little different this time.  Yes, she still has a bit of the quirky nature you'd expect but this is not fun and games.  It's a survival role, and unlike Clooney, she's not clowning around.

This is very much a character driven story.  However, the plotline is pretty riveting too if you don't get hung up on technical details.  This isn't a documentary, so don't expect perfection.  The cinematography is something of a mixed bag.  At times it's fantastic--as good as any I've seen.  At other times they seem to lose the grip, and it can look a big contrived and cartoonish.

The bottom line?  So long as you don't hung up on the technical flaws, I think you'll be entertained by fresh story that isn't formulaic.  And if you let go a bit, you'll lose yourself in a space adventure that gives you a birdeye view from space.  I'm confident that most who make the trip will be glad they saw this one in the theaters.  It's that good.  Maybe not quite five stars -- but for me, it's definitely the best movie I've seen this year.",1385164800,3,2330,4.454976303317536

""Gravity"" is that rare movie that, while a tour-de-force on a technical level, also happens to come with a great deal of its own - pardon the pun - gravitas.

Sandra Bullock, in a bravura, near-one-woman performance, plays Dr. Ryan Stone, an astronaut on her first mission into outer space, sent there on Space Shuttle Explorer to perform some much-needed repairs on the Hubble Space Telescope. While she's space walking with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), the shuttle is hit by debris from a missile strike the Russians have launched to take out a non-operational satellite. Things go from bad to worse when the two astronauts are torn away from the now-destroyed shuttle and are cast out into deep space with little hope for a safe return to earth.

Director Alfonso Cuaron has gathered together a team of technological wizards to replicate, as closely as is humanly possible, the experience of floating adrift in outer space: the weightlessness, the uncontrollable spinning (warning: take your Dramamine beforehand), the immense size and grandeur of Earth as seen from hundreds of miles above the surface.  The purely visceral nature of the movie goes a long way towards mitigating any qualms one might have as to the plausibility of every single thing it is showing us.

The screenplay by Cuaron and his son Jonas does well within the admittedly restrictive parameters demanded by the narrative, which is why the performances of Bullock and Clooney ultimately play so crucial a role in the success of the movie. They make us care about the people to whom this is happening - and, without that, all the special effects in the world couldn't make this concept work. Even from inside a space helmet, Bullock runs the gamut of emotions from queasiness to fear to anger to despair to resignation to hope to determination. It's all there, packed within a taut hour-and-a-half-long running time.

In a way, a film like ""Gravity"" makes movie-reviewing almost superfluous, since it's virtually impossible to convey in words the true nature of the experience. Go watch it for yourself.",1384819200,4,2107,5.040229885057471

5878188,5,B00DY64A3U,"Gravity is a non-stop, nearly plotless thriller about the perils of working in earth orbit , with a little human interest thrown in. Practically from the first, spacewalkers George Clooney and Sandra Bullock (who cares about their character names?) were pummeled and tossed about like toys in the vastness of space. After their ship is disabled, they need to make it to nearby space vehicles if they are to have any chance to survive. We learn about halfway through the story that Bullock has endured a personal tragedy, explaining a) why she is so mopey and b) why we should care whether she makes it back to Earth or not. But the real star of the show is the effects. Somehow, evidently without using the Vomit Comet or hanging actors from strings, the movie makers perfectly capture the physics of working in space. Cables float around, spinning objects just keep spinning and satellites adjust their course with silent jets of gas. It's a marvelous, and completely convincing illusion of the perils that astronauts endure.

As for the hokey personal growth story, with its tacked on tug at the heartstrings? Meh. The same for a handful of ridiculous scenes -- as when Bullock, marooned in a foreign spacecraft, randomly hits buttons hoping to get the thing to respond.

5878191,5,B00DY64A3U,"This is an AMAZING film, which I enjoyed greatly! This review includes very LIMITED SPOILERS.

At 90 minutes this space drama is a rather short film - but it packs much more tension, drama, scares and adventures than many two hours and a half action films. Only two actors really appear in it - three other people show themselves extremely briefly and elusively and there are also some voices on the radio and that is all. But those two actors are in fact exactly as much as this film needs and limiting the numbers was an excellent idea!

Almost all action takes place in space and a great effort was made to give this film a feeling of reality - especially the absence of sound in space is strictly respected, with muffled noises being heard only when one of the heroes hold some metal and hits other metal with it (metal, unlike void, conducts sound, even in space). One could think that it will hurt the film - but one would be VERY WRONG! It is actually exactly the contrary!

The rhytm of the film is very fast - an emergency occurs very early in the beginning and then all hell breaks loose and it continues until the incredibly dramatic, grandiose finale, with only brief pauses to catch breath. In the cinema where I saw this film, most people abandoned all attempts to munch after five minutes - me included. And I really like my popcorn...

This is NOT a sci-fi movie! The technology shown in this film really exists and purely in theory such a thing could really happen. Fiction elements were added by keeping the US space shuttle in service (they are all retired now) and by giving it a fictitious name, ""Explorer"". Real life space shuttles were named respectively ""Enterprise"" (the prototype, not capable of space flight), ""Columbia"", ""Challenger"", ""Discovery"", ""Atlantis"" and ""Endeavour"" - there never was a shuttle named ""Explorer"", but the name sounds like one a real shuttle could bear. Another fiction element is the presence of the Chinese space station ""Tiangong"", which is already fully operational, when in real life its construction should start only in 2020. BUT, the technology seen in this film is all there and there is no aliens, there is no mysterious forces, etc. - of course it is an adventure made in Hollywood, but in its nuts and bolts this movie is very realistic.

Both Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are excellent in this film. In fact I believe Ms Bullock deserves at least an Oscar nomination for this role. Clooney's character offers him a little less oportunities to shine, but he does it nevertheless!

I usually do not like 3D AT ALL, but in this film it actually adds a LOT! I advise strongly to go see this film on a big screen AND IN 3D, as long as it still plays in theatres! I will probably buy the Blu-ray version as soon as it is available, because here very pixel counts, but still, on a smaller screen and without a good 3D ""Gravity"" will lose part of its firepower.

Normally when a horror movie does that (and this is a horror movie, I don't care what anyone says) I don't want to watch the rest of it. In the end, I do feel that that element of the movie was necessary, however, and did enhance the plot of the movie. I want to watch this movie over and over.

Houston, I have a bad feeling about this mission,"" says astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) as he continues to joke around cruising around in jetpacks 370 miles above earth. The first scenes are incredible as the planet earth lies beneath the space shuttle while three engineers Dr. Ryan Stone ( Sandra Bullock) are tethered to it while doing patch up work on the Hubble telescope while talking to mission control played by Ed Harris- the sound effects on the dialogues are incredible.
Planet Earth never looked so beautiful and so is the long shot of the space shuttle slowly edging on to view and in 3D, one can feel the isolation, stillness and the soundlessness of space.
I have yet to see the making of the movie and I will but I think it would be a lot of people spending countless hours on special effects.
Gravity is a science fiction film with many scientific inaccuracies,  for example although Russians and Chinese have their space missions in roughly the same locality as the US missions it is not easy to get to their missions in space with jetpacks as shown in the film. There are other doubtable scenes but most people would hardly care for these inaccuracies as the magic is in the presentation about space and also about human loss and pain, isolation, the futility of life and in the perseverance to fight for its last breath.
I was surprised to find myself reacting so strongly at many moments in the film, even though the movie is only 131 minutes long......it keeps you in its grip for the entire duration suspended in gravity and riveted by the disaster that unfolds before your eyes. The happenings strike you again and again and stay with you.
As debris from a Russian space explosion hurls towards them, they are asked by mission control to abort their task and get back into the shuttle. As disaster strikes leaving people dead and leaving Stone and Kowalski stranded in space- the special effects are just amazing here.
I am not going to tell you what happens from this point but will point out that amidst the background of the CGI effects is the most moving human performance by Sandra Bullock. Just watch her in the communication with a greenlandic fisherman named on Earth's surface,  using a ham radio and feel tears coming out of your eyes...or in the final scenes. A performance of a lifetime. I think the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki and Sandra Bullock are the stars of the film.
Do yourself a favor and watch it on the biggest IMAX screen that you can see it on. You won't be disappointed....five stars. 10/18/2013",1383609600,3,2744,4.595918367346939

Gravity will grab you by the throat and will not let go. It is basically a 90 minute climax of the tensest, scariest, most beautiful film you've seen in your whole life. There is not a single moment where you can relax or let your guard down - just moments where Cuarn lets you breathe in between moments of utter, gut-clenching, brutal terror.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sandra-Bullock/dp/B00F4YKCFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sandra Bullock</a>&nbsp;gives an incredible, physical, emotional powerhouse of a performance, that can only be described as absolutely extraordinary. George Clooney is calming and reassuring in that way that only George Clooney can be. I really have nothing bad to say about this movie. It is perfect in almost every way.

For instance, in the way it subtly echoes sci-fi classics like 2001: A Space Odyssey (Stone's fetal position while floating weightless), WALL-E (Fire extinguisher propulsion), and Apollo 13 (Ed Harris's casting as Houston). In the way the score by Steven Knight is the most dread-inspiring, terrifying, and ethereal score of the year.

The cinematography - which is utterly, utterly perfect. Absolutely, transcendentally, ethereally, stunningly, hauntingly gorgeous. This will make your jaw drop. The camera work and the long takes are the most stunning I have ever seen. There is nothing to compare it to - this is unbridled, no-limits, risky, dangerous film-making at  it's most daring heights. The way Gravity captures the utter emptiness of space, the utter helplessness of humans in that great vacuum is perfect. If you had any childhood dreams of being an astronaut, Gravity will make you rethink them. Twice.

The scientific accuracy, including the lack of sound in space and the temperatures, the costumes - so real you think Cuarn burgled NASA's locker rooms for the film - adds another gritty sense of realism to the cold beauty of space. Bullock's magnetic and beautiful performance as a woman who finds herself and confronts her demons in the middle of the worst crisis that can befall a human (alone, zero oxygen, drifting 300 miles above Earth) carries the film with single-handed aplomb. This is Sandra Bullock as you have _never_ seen her.

Really, I'm just gushing here. Go see Gravity, on the biggest screen you can find, preferably in 3D, with blaring volume. Get ready to get thrilled, chilled, terrified, moved, and have your jaw dropped by one of the great talents of our time,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alfonso-Cuarn/dp/B000QGAU4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alfonso Cuarn</a>, and the greatest film of 2013 so far: Gravity.

5878198,2,B00DY64A3U,"Film critics need to stop name-dropping 2001: A Space Odyssey. Seriously, enough. There's no quicker way of piquing my interest, and no better way of ensuring my disappointment. Don't get me wrong here. Gravity is a decent movie. It can be quite arresting in its best moments, remains visually stunning throughout, and is reasonably entertaining for most of its duration. You could certainly do a hell of a lot worse for the price of admission these days. But despite its considerable strengths, none of them amount to a truly great film worthy of the absolute universal acclaim it has garnered.

I'm not going to devote a whole lot of effort into explaining the strengths of the movie because they've basically been enumerated by nearly every single critical review on the internet. Yes, this is an undoubtedly gorgeous film. The visual fidelity is really something to behold, especially during scenes depicting space station destruction. The particle effects are definitely the most eye-popping I've ever seen. What's even more impressive than the visual effects though is the truly free-form, highly original camerawork and cinematography. The vast majority of the movie is shot with lengthy, tightly choreographed yet completely unhinged floating camera pans that are dizzyingly complex. The camerawork is really the most resounding success of the film as it completely creates that feeling of weightlessness and spatial disorientation that the characters are feeling and transmits all of that directly to the viewer.

So yes, Gravity is certainly a spectacle and a visual feast, but honestly that's where the good things I have to say about it end. Thematically, this movie is essentially barren. All that's really at its heart is a half-baked attempt at reversing a traumatic, potentially damaging experience into a moment of rebirth, reinvigoration, and self-actualization. It's not even an original idea to begin with, but this isn't a particularly compelling rendition and the characters are at fault. This has got to be some of the most bland, undercooked characterization I've ever seen in a film with such positive reviews. After spending a full hour and a half with Bullock's character, all I feel I've really learned about her is that she's pretty damn efficient at taking on and off a space suit. Oh, and she has a pretty impressive lung capacity. I'm obviously exaggerating a bit- there's a very vague backstory involving the death of her daughter which gives us some perspective into her decidedly withdrawn and, frankly, boring demeanor. But it just isn't substantial enough to make her intriguing as a character and makes it very difficult to really buy into her transformation at the end of the movie.

What's frustrating to me too is the fact that a lot of these issues could've been resolved with a little more exposition. This isn't a long movie at all. It easily could've been 30 minutes longer without even the remote danger of being bloated. Just 30 extra minutes of scenes devoted to characterization could've done wonders for the film and really gave it some weight and emotional resonance. Bullock's breakdown scene in the fuel-less escape pod is the perfect glimpse into the movie this could've been. It's by far the best scene in the movie and the only time where I was truly absorbed in the story rather than just admiring the pretty visuals. In this moment, Bullock's character shows a moment of complete vulnerability as she realizes the bleakness of her situation. She is completely alone, both in the overtly obvious physical sense but also in an emotional sense as well. This is such brilliant moment because it takes the character's emotional isolation since the death of her daughter and weaves it directly into her current physical isolation, creating a nice metaphor that instantly breathes life into the movie and gives it a sense of purpose. The character has essentially been drifting in this dead escape pod ever since her daughter died, and it isn't until this moment that she has finally come to terms with it.

This moment is just as fleeting as it is powerful though, and it comes off as too little too late at this point. I do have some other more minor quibbles with different scenes in the movie that I thought were handled poorly as well. Early on in the film there's a nice moment where Clooney's character says something to the effect of ""nothing beats the view"" and the camera pans over Earth with some really nice ambient music that kicks in. But as it re-circles back to Clooney the music fades to complete silence a little abruptly and the transition into more dialogue feels awkward. There's also a particularly hokey moment where Bullock's character verbally compares her flight in the escape pod to the times where she would ""just drive"" after her daughter's accident. It comes off as a very forced attempt to integrate the relatively useless backstory into the present moment and just ends up being cringe-worthy. There's definitely more moments like this too- Bullock's howling along with the dog on the radio transmission or the corny, triumphant line of dialogue towards the end where she essentially announces something to the effect of ""well, whether I live or die this has been a hell of a ride!"" I realize these are relatively petty criticisms but the film stumbles like this enough for it to take me out of the moment and detrimentally affect the viewing experience.

At the end of the day though, this isn't an awful movie. It isn't even a bad movie. It offers up some very compelling set pieces, unbelievable visuals, and some truly phenomenal camerawork that alone makes it worth the 10 bucks. But it's also a film that is ultimately very hollow, essentially devoid of compelling characters, and severely lacking in substance. Yes, it provides the superficial thrills and the eye candy. But for a film with so many accolades, it really leaves a lot to be desired.",1383436800,17,5937,4.968812877263582
5878199,4,B00DY64A3U,"I found the film boring. Sure the view was stunning. Great sets. Great actors. But seriously, what did you expect would happen after disaster struck? One of two things were going to happen: Either they were going to survive or they won't. The film is consumed with us getting to that point. Sandra Bullock in a space suit reading a tech manual trying to figure out what button to push. Real? Authentic? Sure, but so was my yawn.

The visual effects are great on the big screen. I will be honest. I despise films which consist of one person being trapped and having to survive the whole film, because I know one of two things are going to happen...

What the film really needed was a big rubber headed alien to save them and probe their privates. Sure, I would have complained about that too, but at least I would have stayed awake.

BTW I loved 2001 because it mentally engaged me. This one did not because I knew one of two things were going to happen...

Sandra Bullock's acting was terrible and unconvincing. And, she looked like she was constipated most of the time. George Clooney came across just too perfect for such a life and death situation. He was too much like a saint in outer space!

I also felt mightily deceived by both the film's movie trailer  and by the official news media critics that fawned all over this pitiful movie! Gravity is so tame and lame you could take a child to see it without a second thought! It certainly won't offend a soul on planet earth!

But worst of all, was the ending! After you a watch a film you want to feel like there was a beginning, middle and end. In Gravity your jaw is left hanging because there's was no satisfying ending.

But this movie was absolutely fantastic. In IMAX it was terrifying to watch, putting myself in the position of Bullock, I could feel my heart stop. ANYONE who says this movie was a bore is either VERY unimaginative or just didn't want to see it in the first place. With a few passes of all the debris and one massive escape scene, this film has no lack of action or suspense either. The viewer gets a 10-15 second head start warning that the debris is about to his due to a musical build up that makes your blood run cold. Taking the blackness of space to a whole new type of black; fear.

5878203,3,B00DY64A3U,"There were six to eight minute action scenes, the likes of which one may have never witnessed before. A very poetic science fiction about earth and at the same time very easy to follow. I've seen a lot of Alfonso films including Rudo Y Cursi, Y Tu Mama Tambien (all time top ten) and Children of Men. This is his fourth best. This is his entry to the list of all time best films but at the same time, it failed to hit home like any of his other films did. He has also done Pan's Labyrinth and Bitiful but they are not in the same league as the other films I mentioned. Like Quentin with Inglourious Basterds, there comes a film which introduces a great film maker to the world or rather reintroduces the film maker. This film re-introduces the audience to the Alfonso Cuaron. But honestly, I like his ""brain churners"" like Rudo Y Cursi and Y Tu Mama Tambien way more. The photography, depiction, video, clarity, sex, everything is just so beyond the beyond. He is one heck of a film maker and sometimes he leaves you baffled. Just writing a review for a film of this magnitude makes you miss it. The acting is OK compared to how the earth, the moon, the universe behaves. You will get lost and found.

There certainly are some eye-candy moments, and it's the first time a 3D movie has actually made me wince when debris is flying towards you, but overall, I feel this movie was overrated.

Really, it's a human interest story. Surviving impossible odds. Truth be told, though, if such a thing did occur, Sandra Bullock's character would not have even made it to the space station as it was scientifically not possible to do so.

Still, if you want to forget about the plot, and just enjoy the special effects, then you'll most likely enjoy it. Recommend you see it in 3D, though, to get the most from it.",1382918400,17,709,4.48062015503876
5878205,5,B00DY64A3U,"I know there is a lot of great buzz about Gravity, but I have to chime in and agree. This is just a wonderful film. It's not deepest hour and a half of cinema to ever hit the silver screen, but as a Science Fiction film, spectacle, thriller, and all around emotional experience -- it's first rate.

Let me also say that I've been an Alfonso Cuarn fan for some time. I loved his version of Great Expectations. Y Tu Mam Tambin is extremely touching. And Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (a bit of a deviation for him) is the most personal and thoughtful of that octolagy. Cuarn knows how to combine intimacy with visual panache and Gravity is not only directed by him, but co-written, and produced by him as well.

The premise here is simple. Something goes wrong in space. Sandra Bullock tries to survive. The nothingness between worlds is both beautiful and scary. This is the most hostile environment mankind has ventured to. Maybe being pressurized on a really deep dive is about as bad, but at least there, up is up and down is down.

This is a gorgeous film. Everyone says so, and they're right. The 3D is subtle and intense. The panning and spinning shots are dizzying on purpose. I didn't even see it in Imax (just on a normal big Real 3D setup). In Imax it must be really intense. The visuals are generally seamless. The shots have a nice artistry to them, as one expects from Cuarn.

It's also, for all its big scope, a very intimate and personal film. Bullock carries it, and carry it she must as she's in every scene and there is only one other actor (George Clooney) -- and he's gone after the 25% mark. This is her film, and that same plucky charisma she displayed in Demolition Man, Speed, and whenever she picked a decent script over the 20 years since is there in  force. I'm not sure I totally believe her as a loner doctor, but she had me at ""hello."" You feel for her, for her character, and for the awesome magnificence of the circumstances in which she finds herself. There is just enough backstory  to sell the emotional depth. When she manages to get inside the International Space Station (after nearly being punctured, battered, and suffocated), she curls into a little zero G ball. It works.

The music is also very good, adding to the grandeur and scope . Just as effective is the consistent and utter lack of any sound that wouldn't be conveyed through vacuum. The shuttle and space station are destroyed silently. Hatches bang open without a sound. Jets release gas soundlessly. Like that moment in Saving Private Ryan where the artillery blast knocks out Tom Hank's ears, the effect is even more dramatic that the usual cacophony.

Gravity`s pacing is relentless. As each hopeful goal is neared, some new catastrophe intervenes, keeping possible salvation just out of reach. This is accomplished with a deft mix of understandable mistakes and by the sheer array of force deployed against our heroine. But for all that, this is a movie without any villains. The one secondary character borders on saintly. It's a classic ""man against nature"" thriller, and the scope of nature's ability to kill here is truly frightening. When you depend a thin layer of archaic and marginal 1960s tech for every ounce of survival, things like 300 degree temperature swings and small bits of metal traveling 20,000 miles an hour are formidable foes.

Let's sidestep for a second and talk about the Science Fiction. Gravity doesn't assume any future tech. It's set right now, or perhaps even 2011 as we haven't launched a space shuttle since then. The events are improbable, and even a few are probably unsurvivable, but the film doesn't go out of its way to be unrealistic or gratuitous. If I had to choose things to disbelieve, I can: Some of that huge debris storm would likely have hit Sandra (fatally). The sheer amount of physical punishment (being whacked around) would be pretty tough to take. Sandra manages to do a lot of things that are probably very difficult, very quickly. The 3 hours shown would be unimaginably exhausting. Her ISS Soyuz capsule was traveling pretty fast as she passed the Chinese station, and there is no friction in space, so I'm not sure the thrust in a single half-used fire hydrant would be sufficient to match velocity with the station. Or that she had the talent to fly with it. The early reentry of said station would probably be catastrophic as well. But this is all unimportant. Movies require suspension of disbelief, and this film doesn't demand such unreasonably.

Gravity does everything a film should do. It provides character and drama. Shock and spectacle. Thrills and tears. Enough said.

The makers of this film are very interested, indeed, about special effects. They like seeing 'space debris' and exploding space ships, which takes up about 30 percent of the 'plot'.

First and foremost, the photography in this movie is nothing short of stunning, in every sense of the word. The movie starts with an uninterrupted shot lasting a number of minutes as we get to know the characters played by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. I found myself staring at the big screen in total shock and awe (and I mean that as a compliment). Just when you think that's it's all form over substance, director and co-writer Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, previously best known for Y Tu Mam&aacute; Tambi&eacute;n (2001) and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004), in fact fleshes out the Sandra Bullock enough that we care for her and that we are emotionally invested, a key ingredient for any movie to be truly successful. And just when you think that you've seen it all, there is yet more to come. I was very impressed with Sandra Bullock's performance, and the buzz about her being nominated for Best Actress Oscar is certainly deserved. Last but certainly not least, I very much enjoyed the musical score by Steven Price (the soundtrack is available on Amazon).

Bottom line: this movie truly is a one-of-a-kind movie, and a unique experience that you will best enjoy on the big screen and in 3D. (This movie is the best use of 3D since ""Avatar"".) If you haven't seen ""Gravity"" yet, believe the hype and do yourself a favor and go see this in the theatre. ""Gravity"" is HIGHLY< HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1382832000,2,1628,4.749116607773852

I was surrounded by what I can only say was awesome! I almost gave myself whiplash a few times as stuff flew by me.

Just as I go to an action movie for the action and not for its ""accuracy,"" I went to Gravity to be ""wow'ed"" and despite a few moments of ""they can't do that"" it did not disappoint. Now waiting until I can get my home 3D version. :-)

Do not miss this movie in the theater if at all possible in 3d IMAX.",1382659200,3,872,4.093567251461988
5878213,5,B00DY64A3U,"This is simply the most amazing film I've seen in a long time. Between the acting and the visuals, it really feels like you're right there alongside the characters experiencing this. I admit this movie is better in 3D. Hopefully you have a surround system and a large screen 3D capable TV to watch it on disc.

Visuals: I couldn't imagine how they made it look so real, so I read up on it after I saw it. The space scenes were a cleverly done combination of CGI and properly lit faces. They had to come up with a whole new lighting system to sync them up. The indoor zero-g scenes required actor supporting automotive robots, plus perfectly choreography and acting to work. Totally amazing and believable. Bullock works long hours and showed expert acting skills to pull this off.

Reality: It turns out only a few details were not true to life. The initial disaster is something that's never YET happened in space, but could - The Kessler Effect. (Don't look it up before seeing the film.) By eschewing the typical movie explosions, they made the movie both factual and more believable. The trailers for the movie did feature sounds; they needed them to sell. But once you're in the theater, the actors rely on expressions, voice, movement, and breathing rates to indicate emotion. The music is not intrusive and was a big contributing factor to atmosphere.  It's impossible to describe the sense of terror and panic these things convey. Items outside the shuttle and space stations break up silently but no less frighteningly.  One article on line really summed this up for me, It said that most space films give a ""romantic"" view of space; this move imparts the actuality of the ""awesome and terrifying"" nature of it instead.

Acting: As I said above - superb. Sandra Bullock spent 10 hour days alone inside a cramped set to clomplete the film. She could only communicate by headset. her dedication shows. George Clooney is also at his very best, his easy manner even in an emergency a true portrayal of a long time professional trained to keep his head in any situation. (Bullock's character had only trained 6 months for her first space expedition.)

Sound: Stunning. Subtle. Composer Steven Price manages to make a perfect score that enhanses the emotion and action without being obtrusive. That's a hard feat to pull off in space, where nothing ahs sound. Portions were done to match the tempo of an actor's heartbeat. No percussion is used. There's an ominous, lonely feel. Soundtrack: shows no scenes, gives nothing away - google ""Gravity (2013) Official Soundtrack (Composer - Steven Price) (480P)""

Buy it. I plan to. You'll love it.",1382659200,5,2644,4.797802197802198
5878214,5,B00DY64A3U,"Gravity director, Alphonso Cuarn said that after this, he will never make another ""space"" movie.  Thankfully, the ""space"" movie that he did make is nothing short of spectacular, and should certainly make any director think twice before making the next ""space"" movie.

Superlatives abound when describing the intensity and the mind-blowing visual effects of Gravity.  Set in space, Gravity opens with the words, ""Life in space is impossible,"" and five better words do not exist to serve as prologue for the film that follows.  Doctor Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) are on a NASA satellite repair mission 600 kilometers above Earth's surface when rogue debris from a Russian satellite detonation rip through their station at 50,000 MPH, decimating their ship and sending the astronauts hurdling into space.

Cuarn majestically dazzles the viewer in the opening scene with epic silence, sweeping camera movements, and sensory immersion that rivals that of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.  He magnifies the strangeness and utter complexity of being suspended in space as Stone and Kowalski are shown performing a variety of tasks as they complete their mission while communicating via radio between each other and their contact at Mission Control in Houston (Ed Harris).

The peaceful, serene tone of the film's first ten minutes is mesmerizing but unsettling as a twinge of impending doom is resting uneasily in the audience's mind.  The thrilling contrast of the sudden catastrophe that befalls Stone and Kowalski is also handled with pure terror.  Tonal comparisons can be made to the 2003 film Open Water where primal fear is explored as two scuba divers are abandoned in the middle of the ocean hundreds of miles from shore.  Gravity taps into that same primal fear with expertise and style.

Gravity is a true cinematic ride.  While not deep in content, the film is absorbing, terrifying, and authentic.  Clooney and Bullock carry the movie with ease and with a tight running time of 91 minutes, the small cast merely emphasizes the ironically claustrophobic nature of space.  Cuarn's choices of point of view are magnificent as he allows the camera to effortlessly and seamlessly transition in and out of first-person at the most opportune times.  Few films give an audience such awareness and consciousness.  In once scene Bullock's character is suddenly sent spinning into deep space.  She loses radio communication and the camera assumes Bullock's point of view.  The audience abruptly is thrown into a very real experience of spinning, attempting to gain a point of reference, discovering oxygen levels are low, and likely literally holding their breath.  This is a movie to experience in a theater!  A

Gravity is rated PG-13 and has a running time of 1 hour and 31 minutes.  See it on the largest screen possible; it is playing in IMAX and XTreme theaters and can be seen in both 2D and 3D.

5878216,5,B00DY64A3U,"""Gravity"" is the very rare case of a film deserving of all the hype it is receiving. And I am about to heap some more on top.

Specialist Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Commander Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) are trying to run the very test Ryan is on this mission for, the test she trained for six months before traveling to space to complete, the very last thing they have to do before returning to the shuttle, and then to Earth, when they receive an urgent message from Houston. Russia destroyed one of their satellites with missiles, creating a debris field, and a chain reaction, destroying more vessels in the wake. The growing mass of debris is headed their way and they need to get to safety immediately. Before they can, the debris hits their shuttle, rendering it useless, and Ryan and Matt have to come up with an alternative plan. They also lose communication with Mission Control leaving experienced veteran Matt with rookie Ryan on her first space mission. They are going to try to get to the International Space Station, a distance away, and use one of the escape pods to reach a Chinese shuttle, which is even further away. And Matt estimates they have about 90 minutes before the debris returns.

Directed by Alfonso Cuaron (""Children of Men"", ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"", ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban""), and written by Alfonso and his son Jonas, ""Gravity"" is an almost perfect film. One of the reasons for this near perfection is it seems so simple - yet a lot of work went into making this film seem so simple.

The camera moves around a lot - the characters are floating in space, it would seem odd if they remained stationary - but I was very concerned this would cause some motion sickness. Cuaron does a very interesting thing. For instance, he shows us Ryan and Matt spinning, unable to control their movements, establishing their sense in space. Once he does this, Cuaron moves the camera towards Ryan until we are looking out of her helmet sharing her point of view. This is a remarkably good way of establishing both Ryan's place and situation before making us a part of her universe. It is also a great way to create some suspense; we can see Ryan has very little control as she spins around and around until we take her point of view and become a part of her journey and struggle. Strangely, because the camera's movements are controlled by computer, the nausea which can be caused by handheld camera isn't really a factor. Films like ""Captain Phillips"" and ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" are much more likely to cause problems if you suffer from motion sickness.

Cuaron and his team developed new technology to help make this film seem more real. It is always thrilling to see something new in film, to participate in something like this, to see the beginning of an exciting technological advance. While watching James Cameron's ""The Abyss"", I remember being awed by the Water Sprite creature. The technology used to create this character was further developed for the T-1000 in ""Terminator 2"". Now, it seems almost commonplace. In fact, the trailer for the new Keanu Reeves film ""47 Ronin"" played before ""Gravity"" and this same technology was used at least twice in that two-minute commercial. Now, when you watch ""The Abyss"", the Water Sprite seems almost quaint, almost prehistoric. The technology used to make Bullock and Clooney seem like they are actually in space, is already good, but I can't wait to see how it develops and how it is used in future films. Someday, I suspect we will watch ""Gravity"" again and consider how quaint that technology is.

As Ryan and Matt float through space you get a real sense of how helpless their situation is, even before the debris hits their shuttle - tools float away, they are tethered to the space shuttle by a small cable, communication is tenuous at best - and this sets you on edge almost immediately. Then, when all hell breaks loose, you have to wonder how they might ever make it out of this situation.

As impressive as the technology to create these images is, the cinematography is every bit the equal. Earth, and little else, frequently pops up, trying to dominate the blackness of space, showing us the void they are drifting through. The shuttle they use and the two other ships are represented, but they barely make an impression. And that is sort of the point - space is supposed to feel overwhelming.

There has been a lot of press recently about 3-D movie ticket sales. Quite honestly, there are too many films coming out that don't need to be in 3-D - the studios are releasing anything they can in this format to squeeze an extra $3 or $4 per ticket out of our wallet. And the public is catching on as they avoid paying this extra fee for many of these films. So when a film like ""Gravity"" is released and uses the 3-D technology in, perhaps, the best way since ""Avatar"", you should run, jump and go to the first screening you possibly can. The very composition of this film lends itself to the process - very often, one or two characters are the only figures on screen, against the black of space, allowing the figures to pop out and float in front of us, the vastness of outer space beyond them. I would really recommend the splurge of an IMAX 3-D ticket. It would be worth it.

Cuaron spent a lot of time working out all of the technical issues of this landscape and the sound design is also pretty extraordinary. Another director, say, Michael Bay on ""Armageddon"", fills the soundscape with explosions and music. In space, sound can't travel, so this is unrealistic. And annoying. In ""Gravity"", when the debris hits the shuttle, we see the destruction and hear some of it, but it sounds like an echo. Cuaron is letting the silence of space envelope us as it would the astronauts.

All this technology and production design would be a waste if we didn't have believable characters to root for, to take the journey with. Bullock and Clooney's characters are basically it and they quickly give us insight into each of their characters, allowing us to get to know them a little bit. We don't have a lot of time before the problems begin, but as the narrative moves forward, we learn little bits here and there. Surprisingly, these small moments do make us care about each of these characters and we find ourselves rooting for them to make it through this ordeal. My technical eye realizes the character development is very minimal. But the movie-lover in me embraces these moments and I begin to get lost in the story.

Bullock's performance is very good and different from most of the other films she has done. The only other instance I can recall of an actress taking on such a different role is when Meryl Streep starred in ""The River Wild"", an action film. Bullock's portrayal of Ryan Stone is very physical and very challenging. As she is swinging and rotating through space, she manages to make us believe in her character's dire situation. Again, it is remarkable how moving her character is when she has so little time to create one.

Alfonso Cuaron is a gifted filmmaker. He isn't the most prolific director working today, but he spends a lot of time crafting, shaping and making films that are interesting and unique. ""Gravity"" is his best film yet and one of the best films of the year.",1382400000,7,7301,4.638824439288476
5878217,1,B00DY64A3U,"I don't know if movie theaters still have booths where a guy fumbles with reels in a blue haze of projection light, but if there was a guy back there in a room above the last row, I would have told him to shut the damn thing down, not because it was awful, which it was, but because I was leaving and because I was the only one there. Really. Number one movie in America and I'm the only one in the theater. My first time with an unexpected private showing, albeit of an unexpected god-awful time waster. Oh sure the CGI was good, but how good was it really if I'm referring to it as CGI. Besides, never having personally been in space I can't vouch for it's authenticity. The much bally-hooed 13 minute opening shot introducing Clooney and Bullock floating around each other like Pillsbury Dough Boys on acid had me thinking, boy I really like this pair and the snappy dialog so I sure hope nothing really big and bad happens. Actually of course I was hoping for their demise from the get-go, they and all their space crap crashing to earth about 50 feet behind Pacino and Hackman who are reprising their Scarecrow thing from '74. Now there was some real acting. But no, I gotta watch Sandra Bullock alone aboard an abandoned Russian Soyez with as many dials, gauges and levers as the set builders can cram in, effortlessly locating a manual on how to run all this stuff. So these space capsules come with manuals? Apparently, and even though all the name plates on the dials and stuff are in Cyrillic because this is a Russian craft, seems the manual is in English because Bullock finds what she's looking for in about 5 seconds, spends another 5 reading it and va-roooom, she's got 'er running. She also got me running for fresh air and my Jeep. I lasted for close to an hour, but I think this thing ran for an hour and a half. I  paid 8 bucks to get in, offered 10 to get out, but ya know what,  they actually let me go for free.",1382313600,19,1933,4.3076923076923075
5878218,1,B00DY64A3U,"Gravity has scenes of peril that are incredibly repetitive and fairly predictable.  There are several scenes with debris crashing into the vessel and a fire starts on the ship: like that has never been done before.  The main character becomes delusional but in the end makes a snap decision to ensure survival.  Is that not the premise of most space thrillers in which people are stuck in space?
The only reason why such a rendition of this age old story works for Gravity is due to the heroine not actually being a heroine but an incompetent and suicidal woman who has not yet completely given up on life.  In a nonchalant delivery; back story and character development is given in which viewers learn Bulluck's character never passed her flight simulator, has a lost child, has no loved ones, but holds a doctorate.  Presumably, a doctorate is all that is needed to make into space for this film.  Because very early in the story it is revealed that Bulluck's character does not follow orders and is very unobservant of her peers.  This is where the film's logic completely is swept away for competent viewers would question how did Bulluck's character ever get cleared to go on the mission?  In real life Bulluck's character never would have been allowed to go due to: employer's notes of incompetency during her training, disregard for orders, and a psych eval stating she's suicidal.
And why after over a decade of viewing strong competent females from sci-fi/fantasy films/TV including: The Matrix, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Stargate SG-1, and The Hunger Games; are viewers presented with a female lead that is incompetent, unobservant, and suicidal???
Because the writers and produces practice Misogyny?  That is the only reasonable explanation because competent writers and producers would have realized that in the year 2013: women should be competent, pensive, observant, and independent.  And those writers/producers would realize that the story and perils of Gravity are so illogical that only a stupid, self hating, person could be the star: it should have been the male character portrayed by George Clooney.
Gravity is a slap in the face to viewers expecting a good, logical, and probable story that caters to the ideals of gender equality.  For those who want to see the same story of Gravity but delivered in a much better manner: watch the Stargate SG-1 episode: ""Grace.""
And for those who want to watch a good space movie that is based of true events: watch Apollo 13.",1382313600,17,2502,4.961722488038277
5878219,4,B00DY64A3U,"Other reviews will tell you more about the plot of ""Gravity,"" a story about two astronauts, avuncular veteran Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and nervous rookie Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) who get lost in space. I am not qualified to talk about the technical stuff and won't try. I'm also not a science fiction fan: I've never seen ""2001"" and if I saw ""Alien,"" I've forgotten it, which I mention only because so many other reviewers are comparing ""Gravity"" to those films. We saw ""Gravity"" because Alfonso Cuaron directed it, and he made ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"" the least popular but our family's favorite film in that series.

Everything you've heard about the physical beauty of this movie is true. The dialogue won't win any awards for originality. The characterizations are thin. I suspect that's intentional. By giving us cipher characters and words we are expecting amidst the stunning action set pieces and carefully chosen visual triggers (a fork, an icon of St. Christopher carrying the infant Jesus across the water, a Buddha), Cuaron makes it easy for the audience, male and female, to project ourselves into the situations and ask ourselves the movie's questions:

What does an individual life mean?
Why would anyone want to live?
Is there independent value in human life, or is it just evolutionary imperative?
Can we be saved, or must we save ourselves?
Does God exist?
If God exists, is a personal God with us, or is God simply a causation that leaves us alone in the universe?

Some reviewers have complained that the panicky Ryan Stone character is annoying. You could say that, but I think it shows a startling lack of empathy and an obsession with the technical question of whether NASA would really send someone of that disposition into space that disregards the movie's themes. What should have been a routine trip for someone who is not an astronaut by trade has turned into the equivalent of telling a first-time boater that they're going rowing on a calm shallow lake and then tossing them into a raging hurricane on the open ocean. It's a metaphor for what happened to Dr. Stone back home: she sent her four-year-old daughter to preschool and the child died playing tag. Events of what should have been an ordinary day call into question everything Dr. Stone knows and feels about why she lives and why she would want to live. I'd  be freaking out and I bet you would too. I've never had much use for Sandra Bullock, but her performance in ""Gravity"" won me over.

5878220,3,B00DY64A3U,"I went into the Imax theater expecting Apollo 13/2001 type entertainment. Instead I got a couple ""A"" list actors reciting a script.

Before the entertainment starts you have a retiring astronaut leisurely flying around the shuttle with no purpose only have as much fun before he returns home to never return to space again. This is quite normal for military pilots to have a last thrill ride before retiring or separating from the service but to burn up so much screen time with these antics seemed to me the writers and producers were trying to burn up screen time from the beginning.

Then you have a mission specialist who specializes in whining and crying about keeping her last meal down; again quite the norm for astronauts but why spend so much time with the norm.

A few minutes later Houston informs them about the satellite target practice. Missiom Specialist asks if she should be worried but Mr. Silver Fox tells her that Houston will do the worrying for them. A few more minutes of Mr. Fox cruising around the shuttle and Ms. Specialist holding down her cookies the feces hits the rotary device.

After the onslaught of debris which kills everyone but these two and renders the shuttle useless as a reentry vehicle they try to make a plan.

Instead of the bungee tether dance which used way too much fuel (not to mention all the fuel he wasted during his pre-catastrophe joy ride) they should have held onto each other preferably with him holding her in front so he could drive and navigate to the conveniently parked International Space Station. This resulted in disaster for him because he felt she couldn't save him after slamming into ISS deadstick because they ran out of fuel. She was tangled up in wires and he was still connected to her via tether but he felt he couldn't be saved so he unhooked his tether and he floated away.

She makes it inside, strips down to her astro undies and floats around trying to get the radio to work. In a few minutes the ISS is approaching the debris field again and she makes it to the Soyuz capsule only because there was an unrelated fire that was started on ISS. Remember she's in her undies and she's getting into another spaceship with no spacesuit. As the debris rains down on ISS she has enough time to quickly go through the simple checklist in Russian and undock. Unfortunately the shroud lines from the chute has her all tangled up so she has to do a spacewalk in this debris rainstorm and cut the Soyuz loose, fortunately the Russians left a spare cosmonaut spacesuit in the capsule.

After cutting free she gets underway for the Chinese space station that's in the neighborhood around the corner. She makes it to the Chinese space station and changes capsules because the ISS Soyuz doesn't have a chute. After getting away she discovers the Chinese capsule doesn't have any fuel to fire the retro rockets so she can come back home. So she starts getting weepy eyed and cuts her oxygen and takes a nap. End of movie.

Nope she wakes up due to Mr. Fox tapping on the window. She has her helmet off but he opens the door anyway so she holds her breath until he closes the door and it repressurizes. They have a talk about the school of hard knocks and he asks her if she thought about the maneuvering thrusters which has plenty of fuel to execute the deorbit burn. After a few more comments she has an epiphany and wakes up. She looks around and Mr. Fox is no longer there. Realizing it was a dream, she turns the oxygen back on, and starts the deorbit burn with the maneuvering thrusters.

Unfortunately there isn't a checklist this time and all the buttons are in Chinese so she starts pushing buttons at random. Fortunately the Chinese planned for this scenario because when she pushed the wrong button she got a bad tone and when she pushed the right button she got a good tone. So why do we need checklists when all you need are toned buttons?

Fortunately for her everything is automatic because the deorbit burn goes perfect, the capsule separates and orientates itself perfectly for reentry, the chutes deploy at the right altitide, and she splashes down.

Unfortunately the Soyuz both Russian and Chinese were designed to land on land not splashdown in the ocean. She must've forgotten the history of the Mercury program when Gus Grissom's Liberty Bell 7 hatch was blown prematurely when he splashed down and quickly sank in the Atlantic Ocean and he almost drowned. Unless she was short on air she should've stayed put instead of blowing the hatch. Fortunately she splashed down in a very shallow sea or lake because she was able to strip down to her astro undies after her capsule quickly sank and took her with it but she couldn't get to the surface because of her heavy suite so the striptease was warranted in this occasion.

So after rising to the surface she makes a quick swim to shore and crawls out of the water. I guess she was crawling due to an extended time in space thereby her muscles were atrophied or she could've been tired. She did however look pretty good in those wet astro undies.

This was the movie in 3D and it will be the last 3D movie I pay to see because it did nothing for the movie, the same thing happened last year with Prometheus, it looked much better and sharper in 2D.

The movie pretty much happens in real screentime so you have to take that into consideration. My review is the whole movie in a nutshell without getting into every scene or what little dialog, meaningful or meaningless, there was.

This movie did have a somewhat happy ending but in reality it would have been a total loss of all hands but the writers and producers took the deus ex machina approach to this movie from the beginning.

I can't believe all the 4 and 5 star reviews for this movie unless it's mostly the people from the studio making those reviews especially those that appear cookie cutter.

My 3-star review is for an okay or average if you don't think too much. Had I stuck to my guns when first hearing about this movie, I would've waited for it to come out on video and maybe buy used. Instead I saw an interview with a couple real astronauts on TV last week and they sold me on it.",1382313600,3,6181,4.524193548387097
5878221,5,B00DY64A3U,"`Gravity' is the sort of movie I would usually be railing about because of the over usage of computer generated special effects, but `Gravity' is the exception. Those special effects are there for one reason and one reason only, to serve and highlight the acting.

I could give you a point by point synopsis of the film, but that might make the movie seem pedestrian to someone who hasn't seen it. So here's the general plot: during a space walk on a shuttle, three astronauts are working on fixing the Hubble telescope when its reported a nearby satellite has exploded, first reports indicate there's no danger, but soon enough the shuttle and crew is being bombarded by exploding satellite parts at 25,000 miles per hour, only astronauts Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) survive and they're separated from the shuttle survival is the rest of the movie. It's Bullock's film as she moves from a scared mission specialist to someone that runs the gamut of emotions as she struggles to survive in an environment not suited to survival.

Director Alfonso Cuaron could have easily been overwhelmed by the computer generated effects or let them be the star. While he does give you sweeping panoramic shots of the astronauts floating in space with the earth serenely revolving beneath them, that is only to give the viewer a sense of what it's like to be in space. Quick flashes of Clooney's and Bullock's characters show how quickly the peacefulness can be swept away by the realities of space.

A note, while it's true that in space no one can hear you scream it also seems true that if you're a woman in space under your suit you need to be in form fitting panties and a skimpy t-shirt, true for Sigourney Weaver in `Alien' and true for Bullock in `Gravity.'",1382227200,5,1785,4.733118971061093
5878222,5,B00DY64A3U,"Gravitational force, tangential velocity, and inward acceleration aside, Gravity was the perfect film to get the gears for geeks like my friend and I, a photographer and a geochemist, rolling with its phenomenal views of earth from space, intricate and elaborate details of the insides of space crafts, heart-wrenching portrayal of the struggles with loss, solitude, and despair of the main character, and the amazing attention to details that make the film almost believable in the problem the plot presents to her. In the end, we were left asking as we wandered out of Ward Theater in Honolulu, Hawaii, could this happen in real life? (A discussion to be had over a couple of beers and a sandwich at Big City Diner - for sure!)

The intensity of Sandra Bullock's performance as the main character, Dr. Ryan Stone, is incisive. There are several moments throughout the film where the deep emptiness, loneliness, cold, and despondency that can be found in space (and that was promised in the movie trailer) really hits home. It's gut and heart-wrenching, and for those moments, even this slightly clinical observer was left with a tear in her eye. George Clooney, as Matt Kowalsky, played nicely off of the character of Dr. Stone. His is a charismatic character that appeals to the hard-worker in me - the resentful one that has yet to achieve something of greatness but is ready to be done.

Add to this great acting and desperation that the plot introduces, fantastic visions of the earth and its atmosphere as viewed from outer space, and what we have is a chilling interpretation of what it is like to be completely abandoned by hope and embraced by futility in an environment that is a paradise the character cannot enjoy.

5878225,3,B00DY64A3U,"I realize that my review will go against the general consensus on this movie. I had wanted to see it since the first trailer. I had high hopes for it. In some ways, I was not disappointed; however, in the ways that matter most to me--the ways that make a movie a frequently visited enjoyment--it fell short.

Let me start with what I think was good about the movie. And where this movie was good, it was great.

VISUALS
The look and feel of this movie are simply stunning. As a general lover of anything set in space, I feel like Gravity is unparalleled in its presentation of both the gorgeousness of seeing Earth from space and the horror of being at the mercy of things gone awry up there.

SCORE
The music just felt perfect, both geographically (I hope that's still the right word when we're talking about space) and situationally. I'm not sure I have much else I can say having only experienced the film once.

ACTING
I think I expected a good performance from Clooney (even though I couldn't help picturing a fox in a space suit the whole time). Where I was beforehand uncertain, but happily assured during the film, was with Sandra Bullock's performance. I thought she did a wonderful job, and her character was very believable. For someone who earned much of her showbiz money playing stereotyped female characters (even when she was supposedly playing someone strong), she showed here that she can play the lead role in a movie that is trying to talk about something big and meaningful. Which, unfortunately, is as good a segue as I can make into the next part of my review...

Before I go on, let me say that I understand that there are folks who will disagree with me on what I'm about to say. They may take it well, or they may say that I'm incapable of grasping how artfully the film succeeded where I accuse it of failure. Well and good--maybe I am incapable, or maybe there is less potential for objectivity in art than we like, and some of us are going to respond less enthusiastically about something that has great meaning for others. Such is life. Do try to be respectful :-)

My only real problem with the film is unfortunately a big one. Gravity attempts to go big--to be about more than its amazing visuals and A-listers. We are meant to feel for Bullock's character, and to care about her experiences in space because of her experiences on Earth. For me, I was never given enough of her as a character to feel anything more than a common distress with her as I watched her go through her present troubles during the movie. It's tricky, and I'm not claiming that I could solve the problem better than the writers, director, or anyone else involved in constructing this thing, but I just feel like I needed to get more of her as a character to care about her, and to feel like I care about her victory at the end. And so for me, the film ultimately fell flat, because, at the risk of sounding cliched, I don't think it earned the emotion that its ending demands.",1382054400,9,2983,4.464220183486239
5878226,5,B00DY64A3U,"The SFX of this movie are amazing. At several moments I thought to myself ""they must have filmed in space or how did they do that?"" Story was great. The actors Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are amazing.

If you can watch in IMAX 3D ( I believe it was made for IMAX) it is worth the price if you do not have an IMAX theaters near by try at least watching in 3D is an amazing experience.

The director did a great job keeping everything realistic, even the use of sound in space (no sound) and inside the astronaut suit very cool

Overall is a must see Movie.",1381968000,5,561,4.128440366972477
5878227,5,B00DY64A3U,"I honestly don't feel anything I could say would do this film justice.  It is suspenseful, frightening, touching, and an emotional powerhouse all wrapped into 90 minutes.  I really don't want to spoil the plot.  All you really need to know is that it's about people lost in space, but surviving space isn't what this movie's really about.  It's about life and it is beautiful.

I'm not a Sandra Bullock fan, but I thought her performance here was top-notch.  I felt attached to her character from start to finish.  George Clooney, while essentially just playing George Clooney, does a great job as the veteran astronaut who talks her through things, but as far as acting is concerned this is Bullock's movie, no question about it.

The visuals here are just incredible.  Not since Kubrick's 2001 has space seemed so beautiful yet terrifyingly deadly.  This movie knows how to capture the beauty and horror of the situations faced by its characters and does it with extraordinary style.  There are long stretches of silence, emphasizing the vacuum of space (as Kubrick did in 2001), but often the movie's best visuals are complimented by an outstanding score by composer Steven Price.

As for 3D: This is honestly the only time I've ever felt a movie needed to be seen in 3D.  I have been against 3D ever since James Cameron started this recent trend with 'Avatar', but I'm telling you now: If you can see this movie in 3D don't miss it!  3D feels like it actually enhances the atmosphere and emotions of this film in ways I don't think any other 3D film to date has.  As a whole I'm still against 3D films, but Gravity has shown me that there is a place for 3D movies.

Director Alfonso Cuarn ('Children of Men', 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban') has delivered a modern masterpiece.  It is worth seeing in theaters (especially IMAX 3D, as I did) and I feel that when it's on Blu-Ray I'll be analyzing its themes, and visuals for years to come.  Most importantly: I felt genuinely moved by this motion picture.  The scares, the tension, and the emotionally charged climax- it all just rang true for me as a viewer.  Gravity will likely go down as one of 2013's best and is a must-see.",1381968000,3,2193,4.6175710594315245
5878228,5,B00DY64A3U,"I remember when I saw the first trailer for Gravity. My wife thought it looked stupid. I thought it could go in several directions, so I thought I would keep an open mind. From that trailer, you would likely come to several conclusions. First, you might think the movie was trying a bit too hard to be dramatic. You also might conclude that it would be a terrifying, graphic, horror story of a sci-fi. You also might conclude that it would have overblown acting and direction that tries too hard to be edgy (in addition to dramatic). And yet...you might also conclude that this film would be DIFFERENT from the sci-fi that has come before, and break new ground if it met it's seemly lofty ambitions. Well the film is out and it is nothing you feared and everything you might have hoped for and more.

The Most Beautiful Realistic Science Fiction Yet Filmed

The film begins, and you are treated to the most astounding CGI/optical special effects yet seen for realistic astronaut work/spacewalk. A single, long, LONG shot allows the scene to unfold. The sheer beauty of the scene's visuals opens our eyes to how astoundingly beautiful the Earth must be from orbit. Throughout the film, if you have any appreciation at all for cinematography, visual effects, and just plain splendid film visuals in general you WILL be amazing. The way the opening sceene unfolds is more than that though. It's great film-making. The astronauts talk, Mission Control advises, the the astronauts go about their daily work. And then...all heck breaks loose.

""What do I do? WHAT DO I DO!?!?""

If you've watched ANY of the trailers for this film, you should know by now that it's a disaster movie...in SPACE. In a space of moments, events transpire that take everything from tranquil to terrifying. If you were to judge this film based on trailer alone though, you would miss something very important indeed.

From a two minute snippet of a film like this you can see the build-up. You are acclimated to a situation, then the music, the visuals, the dialog, and perfect direction quickly make you feel the gravity of the situation. In zero gravity, object have momentum and inertia until they are acted up by an outside force. In plain-speak this means if something is moving 20,000 miles per hour and heading your way, it keeps rocketing at that speed until it slams into you with unimaginable force. Likewise, if something is moving only 50 miles per hour in zero-G it just keeps right on coming, and unless you have friction (thrust), you won't change velocity until that thing (again) slams right into you. When the only thing keeping you alive is a few centimeters of cloth and a tank of oxygen, that's absolutely terrifying, and the director makes you feel it, see it, hear it, and experience it with amazing realism.

While mileage will of course vary, I am of the personal opinion that Sandra Bullock gives the performance of a lifetime and one that will define her entire career as the newbie astronaut Ryan, and George Clooney is splendid as the veteran astronaut Matt. They both come across as believable, and as I watched the film I felt very much taken along for the journey (thinking about just what I would do if I were in that situation).

""I hate space!""

Now, if you have ever seen a disaster movie in your life, you know that they are a series of unfortunately coincidences one after another that keep the protagonist on the edge of near-death (with some breaks in between now and then so you can catch your breath). This film does not stray too far from that formula, except perhaps that it is directed less like a disaster film (no interventions from unexpected sources to save the day, and the dangers are all environmental/psychological, so you won't have to worry about any psychopaths with knives, insane robots on the loose, etc).

Some people have said that this film is completely predictable, and others have said it is completely original. The truth lies somewhere in between. I have often been very irritated that people continue to blast a film simply because it uses tropes (tropes are not bad), and embrace something that hasn't been very well-done simply because it isn't familiar to them. What I am trying to say is...this film is NOT original in the story it tells. We've had movies about survival against all-odds in a crisis situation for a long time. We've had a few decent films about real-world space travel as well. What we have NOT had, is a film THIS well-made about this story told in this AMAZING WAY.

""Houston, I have a bad feeling about this mission.""

Some people have (justifiably) complained about scientific inaccuracies in this film. The objects of certain objects aren't correct, or are in the wrong direction. The likelihood of a debris field of a certain size being created as a result of an impact in space. A Payload Specialist being called a Mission Specialist. The fact that the main character does not act like an astronaut and acts more like you or I would... Yeah, some things bothered me too. If you know anything about NASA, a Mission Specialist trains like CRAZY. They don't let failures or people with obvious psychological issues on spaceflights (unless, again, they are just there to do one thing, in which case they aren't trained at all for spaceflight maneuvering [if any astronauts want to correct me my source is Wikipedia]). But after seeing the movie all the way through...none of that matters.

For one thing, this film is just far enough off from the real world that I can call it's setting an alternate near-future Earth (Earth 2 if you will). In such a world, EVERYTHING that happens in the film is POSSIBLE. It's POSSIBLE that NASA runs out of money and skimps on training, but gives a bit of extra training for emergencies. It's POSSIBLE that orbits are adjusted for one reason or another. And yes, it's possible that collisions happen, create a catastrophic debris field, and a person has to fight to survive the cold vacuum of space. And that possibility is what makes this film so darn amazing.

When you see objects moving, spinning, acting upon each other, it is all INCREDIBLY real. With a very small suspension of disbelief, you can swallow everything that happens and just go along for the ride, enjoying that under the exact circumstances of the film, everything would transpire exact as seen (or as a book on writing sci-fi that I once read said, you can setup whatever rules you want for your story, you just have to obey them).

""Either way, it's going to be one hell of a ride.""

This is one wild roller-coaster of a movie, and it uses EVERY trick at the director's disposal to make you take this amazing journey. You will taken inside of an astronaut's helmet and be able to read the indicators in their HUD, you will watch objects burn up into the atmosphere, you will be with an astronaut as they tumble and spin out of control, out of breath, terrified out of their mind. And the beautiful, compelling, thrilling reality of it all will take your breath away.

There are moments in this film that will stick with you forever. On this journey you will follow an astronaut's psychological death and rebirth, spelled-out in visuals that will easily make this among the highest ranked science fiction masterpieces ever made. There is no sound in space (though there is in the trailer, it is not there in the movie). The only sound effects are what a person inside a suit or spaceship would hear. The music more than makes up for it. Listening to it will make your heart pound. There is no closet horror here, no zombie hordes or dinosaur jack-in-the-box that leaps into view, and it isn't needed. The thrill of an escalating situation in space is all the terror you need.

But thankfully, this film is more thrilling than terrifying. You will feel stressed, but you will not feel drained. You will be taken to a low point, and then your spirit will sail up into the sky along with the protagonist. This film is NOT a downer. It will make you want to cheer.

""It's time to stop driving. It's time to go home.""

Within the story of survival there is another story. A story of a woman who has given up on life, and is just going through the motions, and now has to make a decision about whether or not she wants to live, whether it's worth the harrowing journey to SURVIVE and walk out the other side of the cold dark tunnel. Some people may think this story is cliche, or boring, or unnecessary. I think it's humanizing, compelling, and inspiring.

I'll make a confession. I AM a Sandra Bullock fan. I fell in love with her as a teen in ""While You Were Sleeping"". I've followed her career since then, and for me at least, she has always made an otherwise unwatchable movie one that I could enjoy (not a fan of Miss Congeniality or The Blind Side, but I watched both movies for her). I've been waiting though, for the movie that I would love her in more than anything she has ever done (much like I'm still waiting for the movie Daniel Craig or Jennifer Lawrence will be in that is good enough for me to want to own for a reason other than that he's in it and I like him). Well, for me, THIS is that movie.

Sandra Bullock is 49, but she has NEVER been in better form. She is gorgeous in this movie, a perfect representative for all women of humanity (I told you this was high-calibur sci-fi). She is at turns, normal, helpless, determined, angry, lost, strong, and at last, triumphantly spiritually transcendent. Ultimately, this is not a battle against the elements, but a battle against herself, and the conclusion is awe inspiring. The music, the visuals, and the actor combine to create scenes that are downright iconic, and the as I said, the end of this film will make you want to cheer.

After seeing this film I could not stop thinking about. I cannot stop talking about it. When it comes out on Blu Ray I WILL buy it and treasure it forever. I had thought no film could be better than Oblivion this year, but this film IS BETTER (And here I thought for any film to be better than that one was impossible. Silly me.) Do yourself a favor. Go out to a theater immediately and see this film. Great, compelling, entertaining, glorious art like this deserves to be seen, appreciated, and celebrated.

Oh, and it deserves to win Academy Awards for Best Actress, Best Director, Best Script, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Musical Score, and DEFINITELY Best Picture!",1381968000,5,10454,4.638918918918919
5878229,5,B00DY64A3U,"I saw 2001 when it was released in the theatre when I was a boy. It has always been my favourite movie. For years I hope someone would better it. I just watched Gravity in Imax 3D. I must state the difference between the two. 2001 is a fantasy of life and death portrayed in science fiction using futuristic modeling. Gravity looks almost like real (present) science that will make NASA proud. They are a totally different kind of science fiction movie. Fans of 2001 will not need to search for any hidden messages in Gravity. Haven said this, Gravity also had a spiritual moment like 2001 in a final scene (no spoiler intended).
If you like REAL space travel , this is the movie for you.
Enjoy!",1381968000,2,695,4.4375
5878230,5,B00DY64A3U,"My mom and I went to see this today.  I actually had no clue what it was about.  I have heard it was good.

Before the review, a few things.  If you are one who has motion sickness.  I would not see this movie.  I never get bothered by stuff moving around a lot.  But many times, while watching this movie, I started breathing really fast and my heart started beating faster.  It gets intense.  If you are one who needs a lot of stuff happening, this may not be for you.  Do not get me wrong, there are things happening.  But it is all set within a single area.  The camera never gets to far from the characters.  It does when they are in space, but when they are in the ship, it is very close to them.

There are movies in which a killer is in the woods and you must escape through all the hazards in order to find safety.  There are movies in which you are in a ship and must find land before massive storms destroy you.  There are movies in which one is abused and must find the courage within themselves to find safety.  All of those situations are dangerous and if you do not give your all, you will not survive.  Now, if you will, imagine you are in a place in which there is no air, no land, no possible way to survive unless EVERYTHING works to the exact degree that it was intended.  Welcome, to Gravity.

This is really a psychological movie.  It is about a person or people who with no contact, hardly any movement and all the odds against them having to find a way to live.  Sometimes they will realize that they have to do things differently, in order to live.  They may give up, only to have something happen that makes them realize they should and can survive, by using that which they have learned.  There are times in the movie in which the people will be outside the shuttle.  Due to something happening, debris is coming towards the ship.  When you see it, you will get very tense.  Then they are climbing on the stuff, trying to get to a location, you will feel tense.  It is very nerve racking.  There are no more than four people in this movie.  I do not want to give anything away.  But I just wanted to let people know that this is not a movie with a lot of back and forth.  It is almost like I am Legend.  There are things that bothered me in this movie.  Things that happened that really did not make much sense.  The very end is a bit odd as well.  After everything that happened, it just did not seem like a big enough ending.  But, I will buy this movie.  I can only imagine how intense this will be if I watch it at home.  It was an interesting movie that I am happy to have seen.",1381968000,7,2610,4.093069306930693
5878231,3,B00DY64A3U,"I had very high expectations and really wanted to love this film based on all the hype and the reviews, but in the end I was left with a feeling of disappointment. Yes, the CGI and cinematography both were very good and very compelling, but overall the script was fairly mediocre. It wasn't just me either - the four of us who went to see this film together all felt it was somewhat of a letdown. Granted, I wanted to see this film in 3D, but no one else did, so we saw it in 2D. True, seeing it in 3D would surely have made for more visually enjoyable experience, but that's about it. Also, after it was over I couldn't help thinking about what the crew of Apollo 13 actually went through in real life with their ordeal; and that further diminished the impact that the fictional ""Gravity"" had on me.

Overall, this film was ""OK"" to ""pretty good"" (with ""pretty good"" falling 1 notch short of ""good""), but not anywhere near as good as it's been purported to be by the critics ... I give it 3-1/2 stars.",1381968000,6,1001,4.268421052631579
5878232,4,B00DY64A3U,"I definitely see how this movie is such a smash hit.  Sandra Bullock and George Clooney together, and often Bullock alone, face crisis after crisis after debris smashes into their space shuttle.  Thus begins an exciting thriller set in space.  Bullock's attempt to get back to earth is much more complicated and tense than I would have expected.  There were many moments where the visual look of space engrossed me in the experience.

The movie relies heavily on sound vs. silence, on an almost first-person perspective of the crisis, and on a ""real time"" pace.  Real time means the story flows in the same timespan as it's depicted as; there's no skipping over time in the edits/cuts.  I think real time is used in Gravity to the same effectiveness as the great western suspense thriller High Noon.  The script is very economical, combining practical discussion of emergency measures with Bullock talking with Clooney about her personal background.  There's even a little humor, part of which is from Clooney having a WWII kind of joking/understated style of stating the problem (""This isn't going to be a joy ride"" is the kind of thing his character says when there's a big issue).

On a thematic level, Clooney's character helps her move forward in life instead of hiding from it, which is really what grounds the movie.  You really want her to survive and live her life with less melancholy once she gets back to earth, and there is great satisfaction when she finally does get home to earth and is so glad to get to shore.  The visual contrast from loneliness and blackness to the colors of earth is a quite satisfying resolution, as is the visible relief on her face at the end.  Sandra Bullock is an actress you can look at for solid minutes, and she remains easy to watch and doesn't seem like she's acting, even when she is sad or scared for a lot of the movie.  She is quite a natural actress.

I felt that the only thing missing from the movie was more development of/transformation in her view of God.  She talked about wanting God's help but not knowing how to pray, and said ""thank you"" (presumably to God) when she was finally safe, but there wasn't any further development.

It's a very unique movie in its construction, especially how it creates suspense with letting you hear the silence and the breathing and mechanical and electric noises, with music rarely getting much in the way.  It also grounds the whole story in a symbolic contrast between outer space's loneliness and earth's vivacity, which symbolizes Bullock's struggle to move on and embrace life instead of closing herself off from pain.  The mostly practical relationship between Bullock and Clooney very economically addresses, in the midst of various crises, her own personal struggle to move on and embrace life, which is what the movie ultimately is about.  For these reasons, I recommend seeing it.",1381881600,6,2886,4.791919191919192
5878233,5,B00DY64A3U,"I didn't think I would like this movie.  I haven't liked most non sci-fi movies about space.  Boring. I only went because it was the only movie available at the time I had available.  I was shocked to find this movie to be amazing on many levels.  Good plot.  Truly scary and tense ( and i'm pretty jaded). Very good acting. Incredible visuals.  And very thought provoking.
  BUT YOU MUST SEE THIS IN IMAX 3D. The 3d is essential to give you the feeling of weightlessness in space, a crucial part of the movie's experience.  And the IMAX  to give an appreciation of the magnitude of it all...incredible panoramas of earth or depicting the enormous emptiness of space sprinkled with stars.  As a backdrop to the astronauts, it makes you feel very small.
  Trust me.  You gotta see this.  No matter your taste, its sure to punch your gut and tantalize your brain.",1381881600,5,861,4.5359477124183005
5878234,3,B00DY64A3U,"The setting is a visual marvel. ""You can't beat the view,"" veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski comments, in regards to seeing Earth from space, before disaster strikes. When it does, it comes hard and fast. A girl Mission Specialist named Ryan, the only other main character, goes flying. She begins to drift away uncontrollably, into the darkness, as the level of suspense goes into full thrust.

It's a nightmare scenario that should've served as the gist of the plot. But it takes quite an imaginative storyteller to keep an audience engaged from there, so we're taken into more familiar cinematic territory and that aforementioned level of suspense starts to descend. In a sense, we're following the wrong character, though, for what it's worth, Sandra Bullock (still) looks sexy in spandex.

Sandra Bullock plays an emotionally tortured astronaut, and George Clooney, playing himself, is her partner. They're trapped in nothingness, and so are we. Imagine a galactic waiting room with a few explosions, some floating, and lots and lots of breathing. That's Gravity.  Oh, and they press lots of buttons in space machines.  Forget suspense, tension, and drama, despite the main character's internal struggle and perilous circumstances. The title has more twists than the film. (Gravity as in physical science and as in heightened danger?  Clever.) There simply isn't enough happening to make this an interesting film. There's a strong woman at the core, fighting against the odds and all that, but as a movie, it's flat.  Ripley she is not. (Actually, if that alien that got blown out of the airlock had shown up in Gravity, we might've had a film!) The effects are fine, but nowhere near as impressive as the hype suggests, which is also true of the film itself.  They made this movie at sea a few years ago and called it Open Water.

5878239,5,B00DY64A3U,"Lets put it this way  Gravity is now in my top three favorite films of all-time. Previously my top three were The Empire Strikes Back, L.A. Confidential and Casablanca. Gravity is now in that top three, although its spot is being internally debated. Its that good.

If you haven't seen the trailers for it, the film is about a group of astronauts who are hit by satellite debris and have to fight for survival. If youve seen the trailer, you're aware how intense Gravity looks. Well, it lives up to the expectations and then exceeds them by leaps and bounds.

Gravity is without a doubt, the single most intense, beautiful and (literally) breathtaking film Ive ever seen. Ive been a huge fan of director Alfonso Cuarn ever since I saw Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban, my first taste of his amazing style and vision. I was further convinced of his masterful sense of filmmaking after seeing Children of Men and his breakthrough Y Tu Mam Tambin. Cuarn not only has fantastic style, but one of his trademarks are now incredibly long single take tracking shots. Most people don't notice long, single takes and that there isn't a cut if its done well.

Gravity continues this incredible feat with a 17 minute opening shot! Its a remarkable feat and you become absolutely lost in the film seconds into it. Its a breathtaking film filled with some of the most beautiful cinematography in recent memory. Sandra Bullock plays the heroine Ryan Stone in a riveting performance. I haven't seen a more worthy Oscar performance yet this year. George Clooney, as Matt Kowalski, is also great, adding a sense of humor and calm to a chaotic situation.

Arguably most impressive about the film, is its attention to detail and realism. Yes, its a work of fiction and some scientific artistic merits were taken to advance the story, but ultimately it stays true to the realities of space. No sound. No gravity. No oxygen. Life can not exist there. These truths constantly run through your mind as you watch the characters struggle and fight for survival. The musical score is powerful and terrifying, amping up the reality of the scenes unfolding before you. I was clenching my armrest and reminding myself to breath throughout the film.

It is without a doubt, a remarkable piece of filmmaking. If you're able to handle the intense and nerve-rattling story, its an absolute must see. Just remember to breathe.

NOTE: I saw it in 3D and on a huge screen. If you're able to see it in 3D, you really should. It isn't gimmicky 3D, it just adds astounding depth to a visually remarkable film.",1381708800,7,2577,4.726057906458798
5878240,5,B00DY64A3U,"Gravity is a film where seeing it in 3D is not mere gimmick. The opening sequence is a fabulous experience in itself where the viewer is brought into the experience of the astronauts working outside the space shuttle. The initial view of Earth is not only breathtaking but one has the feeling of weightlessness as George Clooney, using his jet pack, does a space walk.  Gravity's director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n wrote the script with his son, Jon&aacute;s and came up with a simple story of survival that rivals Apollo 13 for sheer excitement with many moments fright. Ironically, Ed Harris is the voice of Mission Control. After the initial 13 minutes, where repairs are being done to the Hubble Space Telescope, there is no letup in the edge-of-your-seat drama.

Although this is a movie dominated by special effects, it is the performances of the actors that are truly memorable. George Clooney was an excellent choice to play Matt Kowalski, the mission commander. He brings an authority to the role as if he had flown a dozen space shuttle missions. Sandra Bullock is likewise excellent as first-time astronaut Ryan Stone. She is the focus of the film and turns in a superb performance as she desperately tries to find the lifeboat that will take her back to earth. There are some improbable moments in the film where Ryan manages to push the right button but it is the performance by Ms. Bullock that takes hold of the audience and makes us care.  Even in their cumbersome flight suits, Clooney and Bullock connect with their audience.

Gravity is one of those rare films that will have you thinking and talking about the experience long after you have left the theater. The stunning cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki and film music by Steve Sanger with the great performances ensure this will be a film to see again.",1381708800,2,1822,4.830128205128205

1. The acting - Both George Clooney and Sandra Bullock do a fine work.

3. The cinematography - Brilliant work that helps set your mind in it from start to finish.

4. 3D - Done well.

5. Action - Keeps moving at a pace to keep us in it.

6. A story - We get it.  Well written.

7. I wanted to see it again almost immediately.  This is a sign of a great film.",1381708800,3,492,3.7450980392156863
5878242,5,B00DY64A3U,"Survivalist movies are a favorite sub-genre of mine. I love stories about the underdogs beating the odds and overcoming seemingly impossible circumstances. I'm not a big sci-fi fan. I don't generally like stuff about outer space, aliens or monsters. I like a little realism in my movies, which is something that the sci-fi genre doesn't really know how to do.

The beautiful thing about ""Gravity"" is that every single thing that happens in it is possible. It all could happen in real life. It's a story about how deeply powerful the human spirit is, and how the will to survive can be more powerful than anything that might stand in a person's way. ""Gravity"" is every bit as much a character study as it is a popcorn movie. How often can you say that about a movie? It's pretty damn special.

""Gravity"" follows Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), a medical engineer who is just about to finish a 42-day long space mission with NASA with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney). While they're up there, flying satellite debris destroys their spaceship, leaving the two stranded in space, the sole survivors of this mission gone horribly wrong.

The film opens with an absolutely spectacular 13-minute long panoramic shot that sets the entire film in motion. It could be a flawless short film. The film ensues with many more extended shots that are done so beautifully. It's hard to believe this movie could be pulled off so seamlessly. It's the work of a masterful director, Alfonso Cuaron, who hasn't worked since 2006's Children of Men, which was an incredible film as well. However, I think ""Gravity"" will be remembered as his best work.

Sandra Bullock, who I think of as mainly a comedic actress, has pulled off a couple good dramatic performances over the years. She even won the Oscar for 2009's ""The Blind Side"". However, you've never seen her like this. Over the course of the film's brief 90 minutes, she has to play so many different emotions, that it's evident this is the work of an incredible actress. Her character goes from being scared out of her mind, to the ""I'm just going to give up"" depression, to deciding that life is worth fighting for. Her backstory is simple, but it is enough to make you connect with this character, and feel for her every step of the way.

George Clooney has a smaller part, but he does a great job with what he has. It's really Bullock's movie. It's a showcase for her remarkable talent as an actress, but it's also so much more than that. There's gorgeous symbolism and underlying themes of religion, death and rebirth. It's an intellectual popcorn movie, which is something that we certainly don't see enough in American cinema.

5878243,5,B00DY64A3U,"*I Enjoyed the Simple Story. People Complain that the story was 'clich and unoriginal'. It's about 2 people trying to survive in space. And it did that job (and story) very well. A Simple Story is not a bad thing. To me, a lot of films lately have had 'overly complicated stories' that drag the film down to the depths of Cinematic Hell. It was nice to see a very Simple Story told very Effectively.

*Very Well Acted. People say 'there is nothing to the characters' or 'there are no characters'. Sorry but I disagree with those people. I saw two of them, played very well by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. And I'm sorry, but I didn't want them stopping every 10 minutes to pontificate about God or The Universe. It's them trying to survive by themselves and trying to figure out how to do that. By the way, someone said that this was quote 'Clooney's worst performance'? Really? I would have picked Batman & Robin for that...

*The FX are Beautiful.

*The Score fit the film very well like a glove.

*Intense, satisfying, and not overly long (like the usual 2 to 2 1/2 hour flicks that normally come out).

5878244,3,B00DY64A3U,"Before I begin, this is a review for the nerdy masses. If you don't understand the relevance of Newtonian physics to a movie about space then just ignore everything I'm about to say. This review is aimed at the nit-picking few, not the general populous. I understand that but the nerd masses must be served too. Also, don't vote the review 'unhelpful' just because you don't know what 'Newtonian' means.

OK, so let it be known that I don't do movie summaries, so there's no chance of a spoiler. I also endeavor to keep things short and to the point so here goes...

To the positive, this movie has some wonderful moments and great cinematic execution. There are some truly breathtaking scenes that evoke an almost painful level of tension. The trailers do this movie justice and it is just as visually gripping as they would have you believe. There's also a faint thread of deeper meaning along the lines of the frailty of human life, connection to mother Earth, all that usual yadda, yadda. It's there but it's fairly weak.

Despite all the great shots though, the movie has a real problem with physics. I realize, of course, that every movie that has to do with space has this problem but it's particularly disappointing in this case because I expected so much more. At times the story disregards just how big the planet is relative to the tiny vehicles we use to travel around it and misses on points of simple Newtonian physics. This is reasonably ignorable for the first half of the movie but eventually it begins to wear on the scientifically minded.

In summary, this is either a great movie or a mediocre one. If you're the sort who will go home and look up the cockpit configuration for the Soyuz capsule to compare it to the movie... well, you may be fairly irritated at some of the disregard for reality this movie demonstrates. If you're able to put that sort of thing out of your head though, then you might very well enjoy the action of what's going on. Not really a movie with a ton to say on any deeper level but it does stir up any acrophobic tendencies. In retrospect, worth the $7.50 but to see it in the theatre but I wouldn't be nearly as excited about it as I was. Suspect this will lose quite a bit when it goes to the small screen.",1381536000,4,2256,4.468446601941747
5878245,5,B00DY64A3U,"First let me say this, it's not science fiction flick, at least not in the traditional sense.  It's a drama & a story within a story.

The film is phenomenally written & the story grabs hold & doesn't let go until the end.  It has been a very long time since a movie this authentic in portrayal as well as acting has graced the big screen.

If you have the option, spend the extra money & go the IMAX 3D route, you will not be dissapointed in anyway.

I am a space enthusiast, so even though some of the plot points are inaccurate, it is only minor stuff & doesn't take away from the film in anyway. The minor inaccuracies had to be done to make the film & story work. Unless your a NASA nut you won't even notice it & even then the film is so compelling & nonstop action packed (literally from start to finish)  you really don't have time to think about it.

With that said, this film screams authenticity in every other sense.

I have always loved Sandra Bullock films, she has the natural ability to literally become the person she is portraying. Sandy's performance in this film is undoubtedly one of her best & no one else could have pulled it off as effortlessly as she made this look. Sandy's acting made this film believable, you have a hard time remembering this isn't really happening.

I will be completely shocked & dismayed if she doesn't win an Oscar for her role. Yes, she really is that good.

This is just my opinion, but what makes Sandy so perfect for this role is her approachability. She is one of the very few celebrities that lives & acts like a normal person. She is so genuine & down to Earth. She doesn't act like a celebrity at all, she very much acts like an ordinary everyday person like the rest of us. She's a true star in every sense of the word & makes millions for her roles, but you would never know it from her personality.  This is why she is so successful in her career & why everyone adores her & the characters she portrays.

Gravity is a nonstop action packed, scary, emotion filled joyride, that only stops once the film is over. The story is very relatable to everyone, as it focuses on the tragedies, obstacles & hardships we all face everyday.

Go see this film, tell everyone you know to go see this film. In all honesty this film is very realistic & even some actual astronauts have said it portrays the overwhelming fear they all face when performing real missions.

This may sound crazy but those who have seen the film know what I mean & how true it is, after leaving the theater you will be changed, you will feel emotionally connected & you'll never look at your life the same way again. All of which is most certainly not a bad thing.

5 stars, A+, highly recommended & an absolute no regret purchase. DO NOT SEE THIS FILM IN ANYTHING BUT IMAX 3D!!! if you don't have access to IMAX theater, then definitely opt for the 3D version. Yes, 3D is more expensive ($13.00) & IMAX 3D even more so ($17.00) but it's more than well worth the money. If you choose to go cheap you will regret not spending the extra $ to see it. Honestly, $17.00 is a lot for a movie, but after the movie is over, you will feel as though you couldn't have enjoyed & experienced it any other way & will not have the slightest regret.

Hopefully Hollywood is watching & taking notes, we need more films like this. This was a very refreshing change to all the box office flops that plagued the summer. (With the exception of Iron Man 3, another outstanding film).",1381536000,7,3485,4.322085889570552
5878246,3,B00DY64A3U,"First off, I could not understand how the whole premise of this film could have occurred in the first place. Did the Russians shoot down their own satellite which caused the space debris? Surely the international community would not have allowed such an event to transpire if such consequences were possible?

I hated Sandra bullocks character. There were a few scenes that dragged on far too long and some which were completely out of sync with the serious tone of the film. One was a scene of her continuing to talk even though her oxygen was at 2%. Another was a scene of her talking to a chinese guy on earth repeating woof woof sounds. I couldn't wait for that scene to end.

I didn't understand why clooney's character chose to cut himself loose in the scene where bullock was barely holding onto him. Maybe someone can explain this.

Clooney's character brought a lot of charisma and humour to the film but had the negative effect of highlighting Bullock's awkward and hysterical nature. In a disaster/survival movie I want to watch smart, calm and resourceful characters not incompetent, edgy characters with emotional issues.",1381449600,5,1134,4.865284974093265
5878247,3,B00DY64A3U,"Heading into the theater to see this movie, I thought that it was going to be a great experience.  I had heard high praise from friends, it fits neatly into my favorite genre of movies (science fiction/drama), and it just looked like a really, really cool concept.  Unfortunately, I left the theater feeling ambivalent.

For a basic plot summary, ""Gravity"" tells the story of two astronauts who are stranded in space after a freak satellite accident pummels their shuttle and sends them both adrift.  Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) is the cool, cocky, non-stop energy personality, while Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is the nervous, scared, out-of-her-element type.  They must somehow find a way to survive in the vacuum of space while planning a return journey to Earth.

I will say this about ""Gravity"": the visuals are absolutely astonishing.  It really makes you feel as if you are in space with the two astronauts.  I didn't even see it in IMAX, but I can imagine that would be even a more visceral experience.

The trouble for me, however, is that I felt that the plot/characters were never really developed enough to truly care when it all starts to come together in the end.  It almost seemed as if director Alfonso Cuaron tried to tackle too many things at once and didn't really ""nail"" any of them.  There were shades of horror, suspense, drama, reality, and even humor sprinkled into the experience, but in the end I just didn't feel the emotion that is needed for such a character-driven film like this one to be considered great.

Thus, aside from the spectacular visuals, I was disappointed with ""Gravity"".  It isn't a ""bad"" movie, per se, so three stars are in order, but 2.5 would be my more exact ranking.  It just never sucked me into the plot or characters.",1381449600,7,1778,4.749185667752443

Sandra Bullock was magnificent and George Clooney was perfect in the role he played. Also the musical score was exquisitely beautiful and complementary to the story. In my view, the movie was flawless. It is a must see on the big screen.  2D is quite sufficient a medium to really experience and appreciate this film.

Here's the scoop. There's a space shuttle mission in space. The Russian's have blown up one of their satellites and the ensuing metal storm is taking out everything in its path. Next thing you know, the space shuttle and all the crew save for Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are dead. They now must fight to survive and make it back to mama earth.

This is a remarkable effort. I had the pleasure of seeing it in Imax 3-D (a first for me) and you feel as though you're in outer space with them. I've seen any number of sci-fi movies set in space but this tops them all in driving home the the sense of expanse, quiet menace, no sense of up or down and zero room for screwing up. The story is good enough. It's a 'Murphy's Law' scenario where one bad thing leads to another right up to the final breath stealing moment. Like ""Apollo 13"" you have people in peril in outer space. As good as ""Apollo 13"" is, this tops it on the tech side. SO much attention is paid to detail here. Small things, like seeing the various reflections in the visors of Clooney and Bullock. Bullock's tears floating away from her face as she thinks all is lost. There are a million little things like that that would take repeat viewings to pull in. Bullock is her usual good self here and she comprises a lion's share of the time. But the kudos have to go to director Alfonso Cuaron. He has a remarkable vision here and managed it with near flawlessness. His ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is one of the best in the series. And his ""Children of Men"" is one of my all time favorite films. I can't wait to see what he does next.

Like I said. The story is good enough, but it needs to be seen for the sheer level of achievement. Few movies come along that shake you to your bones like this does. If you still want to reclaim a lost sense of wonderment, this should do it for you.",1381363200,4,2085,4.233668341708543

Instead, it's a riveting man-against-nature (woman, actually) story, with Murphy's Law doing plenty to keep it moving. That alone would have made it a good movie.

But that ignores the cinematography. Words like ""grandeur"" and ""majesty"" kept running through my mind. Cuarn took the most dramatic location ever, low Earth orbit, and made the most of it. The effects that simulated weightlessness were utterly convincing, but really, the visual spectacle of hard, black space and The Blue Planet set a new standard.

It doesn't happen often, almost never, but I'm ready to go back and see this again. And yes, I'm sure the DVD will be great, but the big screen turns this into a very different experience.

5878255,5,B00DY64A3U,"For anyone who has played and loved ""Myst,"" ""Gravity"" is comfortably familiar.  After six months of training, research scientist Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is now on board a mission to repair the Hubble Telescope when satellite debris bullets through space and shatters their shuttle, and sends Dr. Stone flying across the empty abyss.  She is rescued by an experienced astronaut on his last mission (George Clooney), and soon she must find her way home across the vast expanse of space.

Not much happens in ""Gravity,"" and there is in fact only two characters that we see alive.  Its genius lies in its details, as Dr. Stone must navigate two space stations, and solve several technical puzzles in order to get home.

""Gravity"" could survive alone as a visual spectacle, but it goes further.  The director creates an emotional universe, with Dr. Stone crossing the emotional spectrum from fear and apathy to courage and resolve in her journey across space.  And in this emotional universe the director pays as much attention to detail as in the cinematography.

And that's why ""Gravity"" is such a powerful film.",1381276800,5,1117,4.967741935483871
5878256,5,B00DY64A3U,"The first thing to say about Gravity is that it's a beautiful movie. It's beautiful in the same way that Life of Pi is, just spectacular to look at. What's even more impressive about that is that it's nearly all digital. It's pretty amazing. In fact, the movie, much in the way of the Star Wars prequels, was delayed due to waiting for the technology to get to a place where the environment could be made to look realistic. Well, I've never been to space, but it looked amazing. I'm not actually sure it's Oscar material, but I won't be surprised if it gets a nomination for best visual effects.

The next thing that has to be said is Sandra Bullock was amazing. Even more so when you consider that she's the only character through much of the movie. The only other thing like this that I've really seen was the under-appreciated Moon with Sam Rockwell (seriously, you should see this movie). Most of acting is, in a sense, reacting, the interplay of characters (and actors) with each other. It's much more difficult when it's just... you. Nothing and no one to play off of. The dependency on monologues in Hamlet is one of the reasons it has long been considered to be the measure of success for actors. If you can pull off Hamlet (the character) believably, you can pretty much do anything. I think Bullock could pull off Hamlet. She carried the movie as if it was weightless. And, if it doesn't get nominated for anything else, Bullock certainly deserves a best actress nomination for this.

However, I do have to say how very disappointed I am with Cuaron that Bullock was, basically, a default choice, because they couldn't get anyone else to take the park. The anyone elses, other than Angelina Jolie, all being ""young, hot"" actresses that, well, can't much act. Most of them. Basically, they wanted a pretty face for the role, a role which would require the actor to carry the movie, not someone who has proven she can do the job. That is... just disappointing. But I digress...

The only negative I've seen about the movie has to do with Clooney and how Kowalski is such a flat character. As such, Clooney didn't do much acting. And that's true. Clooney was pretty affect-less, but I think that was intentional. He's not a real character; he's a representation of the person Dr. Stone sees him as. He's the strong leader that takes charge and isn't flustered by anything; at least, that's what he is to her, so that's, also, how we see him. So, yeah, the part didn't require much of Clooney, but I think it was perfect for the movie. He's so flat that we don't get attached to him, and that's required, because we, as the audience, are supposed to be focused completely on Dr. Stone.

Here there be dragons... um, I mean spoilers... Here there be spoilers. You have been warned!

As great as the movie is on the surface (and it is great just taken as what it is, a disaster movie in space), I think it's its deeper, metaphorical meaning that gives the movie greatness. After the disaster occurs, Kowalski needs to get Stone talking so as to distract her and calm her down, so he started asking her questions about home. We find out that, really, Stone has been leaving in space for a long time, since the death of her daughter through an unfortunate playground accident. The woman has no life. She goes to work, presumably doing something that relates to saving the lives of kids who have had similar accidents, although we never find that out, and, then, drives. Just drives. In silence. She has put herself as close as she can into a vacuum. Into a suicide-less death.

The death of Kowalski puts the loss of her daughter into perspective. Stone is trying desperately to hold onto him, but he can see that her persistence is going to kill them both, so he entreats her to let go, just let go. And it's here that we can see the flatness of Kowalski best. He's stoically heroic. There is no clinging to life on his part, just pragmatism. ""You have to let me go or we'll both die."" He is the sacrificing hero as seen through her eyes. ""You have to let go.""

Of course, this has a deeper meaning that applies more to the fact that she is still clinging to her daughter than it does to him.

After that, she enters the space station and strips out of her space suit, and there is a lingering image of her curled, fetus-like, in front of a round window looking out at space. It is the exact image of the womb and of her entering into a state of rebirth.

But it's not really that easy, because birth, as easy as it seems (to us in the USA, anyway) in this 21st century world, is not easy. And she almost gives up a little while later but has a lack-of-oxygen induced hallucination of Kowalski telling her that she has to make a decision: She has to decide to live. If she's not going to decide to live, she needs to quit living the lifeless life she's living and just get it over with. She switches the oxygen back on and chooses to live. Finally, she lets go of her daughter and says goodbye.

The final scene of her crashing down and escaping the capsule as it floods and sinks, the scene of her climbing out of the water is the very metaphor of birth. She stands there on shaky legs (after being in a zero G environment) like a newborn colt and faces a new day. A day with the hope of life, not one that clings to death.",1381276800,5,5327,4.409969481180061
5878257,5,B00DY64A3U,"As a HUGE fan of director Alfonzo Cuaron (HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN, which I consider the best film of the series; CHILDREN OF MEN, one of the best films of the last decade), I'd been looking forward to his outer space drama GRAVITY since it was announced. Of course, word of mouth from its film festival premieres was so incredibly good that it seemed like it couldn't possibly live up to this hype, right?

Short answer: YES IT DOES.

Synopsizing the film doesn't do it justice, but it follows astronauts Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), a first-timer in space, and Matt Kowalski, a smooth-talking chatterbox veteran who are forced to do whatever they can to survive together after a freak shower of debris destroys their shuttle in the most hostile environment that humankind has ever visited: outer space.

That's really it. The film unfolds in real time, and thanks to Cuaron's vision and the talents of Bullock and Clooney and all of the technical staff, GRAVITY is not only the best film of 2013 so far (and will likely remain so), it's also the most visually immersive and absorbing film I may have ever seen in my 36 years of remembering seeing films. At a brisk but unrelentingly intense 90 minutes, GRAVITY grabs you and it NEVER lets go. The script by Cuaron and his son Jonas isn't just filled with dialogue and action that gets you from one moment to another. It has surprises, and a significant amount of heart as it becomes slowly less about just survival and more about living life.

What really does it though, and this might be where the film might suffer on home video, is the ASTONISHING use of 3D. As opposed to 99.9999% of films that are shown in 3D nowadays, which is just a shoddy post-conversion so that the studio might squeeze a few more bucks out of the moviegoer, Cuaron actually USES the 3D as part of his visual storytelling. There are moments where you literally put your hands in front of your face in order to block the oncoming debris or whatever danger you might otherwise see coming at you. This speaks more to the immersive feeling of the film than just about anything else other than the storyline, performances, cinematography, effects and musical score by Steven Price... because all of these things are incredibly well-done. Bullock EASILY gives the performance of her career here, and Clooney does a brilliant job at keeping things grounded.

GRAVITY is not a very subtle film, and it's not designed to be. There aren't layers upon layers of commentary like CHILDREN OF MEN, and there aren't subversive elements like in PRISONER OF AZKABAN. This is cinematic storytelling without the veneer of having to be high-minded. It's pure cinema that will terrify you, exhilarate you, and absorb you like no other film in recent memory. It's a great artist that knows when to cast aside pretense that isn't necessary and just tell a breathtaking story. Cuaron is one of those rare artists, and GRAVITY is one of those very rare films.",1381190400,48,2984,4.730769230769231
5878258,5,B00DY64A3U,"It's been an awfully long time since an honest-to-goodness science fiction film, one that doesn't involve robot monsters, aliens, comic book heroes, or the like, has been made in Hollywood; but it seems like we have one in the form of Mexican-born director Alfonso Cuaron's hour-and-a-half opus GRAVITY.

Probably about as original and realistic a film as one could be that is set in the vastness of space, even if it is just above the Earth's atmosphere, that Hollywood has made after films like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, MAROONED, and APOLLO 13, films that it resembles quite strikingly at times, GRAVITY stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney as astronauts doing a routine repair job on the Hubble Space Telescope who find themselves in the middle of a crisis when a huge debris field, created by the accidental missile hit on a Russian satellite, destroys both the space shuttle and the telescope itself, and the remaining shuttle crew.  The horrifying incident leaves the two of them stranded some 300 miles above the Earth's surface, with only their spacesuits for protection against the airless and soundless vacuum of the void.

Their only hope for survival is to reach the International Space Station.  The trouble is, however, that the debris field caused by the satellite explosion has created a chain effect of other satellites and space platforms being destroyed in orbit, creating a massive swath of debris that keeps hurtling at them at thousands of miles per hour.  And some of that debris has indeed destroyed the I.S.S., and killed most of the crew.  Clooney sacrifices himself in order to get Bullock into the remaining Soyuz escape pod still attached to the I.S.S.; but again, complications arise.  Only after a hair-raising, eye-popping dilemma does Bullock get into the pod and head for the nearby Chinese space station, which itself has suffered tremendous damage.  Bullock, understandably in a huge panic, has only a limited amount of time before she gets into the Chinese escape pod and survives the intense heat of re-entry, not to mention another debris field created by the Chinese space station as it re-enters the atmosphere.

Whether seen in the regular wide screen format, in 3-D, or in the specialized IMAX 3-D (where it would share a further comparison with the 1987 IMAX documentary about the space shuttle program, THE DREAM IS ALIVE), GRAVITY succeeds as great science fiction; and while it is at times overwhelmed with the 3-D process and the avalanche of special CGI effects (though the budget stayed at under $80 million), the effects don't overshadow the storyline or the characters, which is a marked and refreshing contrast from most Hollywood big-budget spectacles of the 21st century.  Cuaron co-wrote the screenplay with his son Jonas; and although some of the situations don't conform so much to the reality of space as they do to a slightly clichd Hollywood version of it (something that Stanley Kubrick avoided extremely successfully in ""2001""), overall the end result is a film that has a lot of the grace of ""2001"", the extreme tension of MAROONED, and the high-stakes terror of APOLLO 13, films that it can stand up to comparison quite well.  Clooney and Bullock (the latter especially so, since she must carry most of the movie on her own in a way she's not had to do since, probably, SPEED in 1994) give very solid performances here.  And perhaps as a nod to APOLLO 13, Cuaron cast Ed Harris, who portrayed NASA flight director Gene Kranz in that movie, as the off-screen voice of Mission Control here.

The final result in GRAVITY is one of the best science fiction movies of recent years, and clearly a film to be relished as one of the best for 2013.",1381190400,7,3705,4.899361022364217

I was dismayed to be forced into a 3D showing, because they are usually mere gimmicks and more expensive. But upon leaving this movie, I not only have a renewed interest in going to the theater' but am a true believer in 3D as an effective medium. In this movie, 3D not only propels the story, but is a character itself!

The movie was co-written, co-produced, co-edited and directed by Alfonso Cuarn. It stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney as astronauts who survive a damaged Space Shuttle. The movie features something like an odyssey--going from a shuttle to the international space station to. . .

Sandra Bullock makes a good case for an Oscar nomination. She does a tour de force in her role. I am not sure that her recollection of her daughter helps a great deal, but it does humanize her.

This film is a perfect combination of ""Matrix"" and ""Inception"" and will pump your adrenaline to a maximum level! ""Gravity"" is a life time experience that everyone must see! If you add to the mix that Sandra Bullock and George Clooney star in it as main characters, it just doesn't get better than that!

Since this movie has so many genres, it's hard to tell its main one. This movie has adventure, comedy, sorrow, suspense, thrilling scenes, intense scary scenes and so much more! The main one out of all these fantastic genres is definitely suspense. You walk in feeling bored and tired and you walk out feeling like Ryan Stone in the movie. (Sandra Bullock)

The thrilling adventure begins when a young medical engineer named Ryan Stone goes up in space to help with installations for the Hubble Telescope. It seems like a casual spacewalk, but when she gets stranded away from her ship, ""Explorer,"" she needs to get back to Earth by hitching a ride on a different station. If you want to find out how and if she and her co-worker,  Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) make it back to Earth alive, you have to watch the film.
The movie has so much adventure and so many impressive and clear graphics, it's hard not to like it! You feel like you are right there, experiencing whatever the main characters experience. The acting is amazing and there is deep meaning behind it - what would you do, if you were alone in the deepest and darkest part of this entire universe, with nobody but yourself? What would your thoughts be? Would you be able to remain hopeful or just give up and let Space take you? The camera work is the best I've ever seen. Alfonso Cuarn, I give you standing ovation for directing this masterpiece.

My favorite scene is when Ryan is stuck in a damaged escape pod with no fuel. She thinks she's stranded. Before she decides to give up and loose hope of returning to Earth, she starts to see Matt. Matt gets in when she does not have her helmet on and shows her that she can get back. As soon as his statement is over, he's gone. She hallucinated him but the plan worked!  It's a very interesting and important scene in the movie and that's why I like it.

The movie is rated PG-13 and I honestly think it is appropriate for age 12 to 18. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and it is showing in theaters everywhere right now. I may be wrong, but I predict Oscar nominations for the cast and director of ""Gravity."" Let's see what happens in 2014!

5878263,5,B00DY64A3U,"The irony of the film's title is that there isn't any, gravity that is, but that's not to say it lacks gravitas. It does in ways both unexpected and transcendent. It's been seven long years since Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n's last film, 2006's emotionally propulsive thriller,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Children-of-Men/dp/B000QGAU4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Children of Men</a>, which was a masterful work of suspense in the midst of one seriously dystopian vision of the apocalypse. Somehow, the less-than-prolific filmmaker manages to surpass that impressive work with this terrifying yet genuinely profound 2013 science-fiction thriller that buzzes by in a fleet 91 minutes. Although Ang Lee effectively used 3-D CGI effects to enhance the magical realism of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-of-Pi/dp/B00BGZ8OLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life of Pi</a>, I have never seen a film use them as purposefully and powerfully as Cuar&oacute;n does here within the dramatic structure of the story. Co-written with his son Jon&aacute;s, the screenplay, by contrast, is life-size in its intimacy and even with all the technical jargon, at times poetic. This combination gives the film an almost mythic reach and at the same time, brings insight into the way the human spirit works against the overwhelming emptiness of space. The story takes place about 372 miles above Earth, and the alternately ethereal and scarifying setting is captured in brilliant detail by ace cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and special effects master Tim Webber.

Pay particularly close attention to the uninterrupted seventeen-minute sequence that opens the film. It's a bravura piece of cinema by anyone's standards. In brief, bio-medical engineer Dr. Ryan Stone is on her first space mission studiously installing a device to fix the Hubble Space Telescope on the U.S Space Shuttle Explorer. Mission commander Matt Kowalski is a veteran astronaut who devilishly spacewalks around her in a jet pack. Mission Control reports that the Russians have blown up one of their own satellites which transforms into a massive attack of hurling debris that arrives in a matter of seconds and will continue to make an orbital return causing massive destruction every ninety minutes. There is no time for the crew to return to the shuttle much less Earth, and the damage to the craft and nearby International Space Station is extensive. It's enough to say that Stone sets off on a journey not only of physical survival but spiritual awakening as her character has been in a listless state since a senseless personal tragedy occurred back home. If you don't count the voiceovers at the beginning, there are only two actors who make up the entire cast, and they are grade-A stars who bring their personal charisma to the fore.

George Clooney has the smaller of the two roles as Kowalski, and he uses his natural insouciance to great effect as his wisecracking gives way to a character who provides the knowledgably becalming tone that Stone needs at the story's most critical points. He makes one particularly risky scene work by the sheer magnitude of his character's life-affirming bravado. He also impressively wrote the scene. Even so, this is Sandra Bullock's film from start to finish, and it amazes me how she wasn't even among the top casting choices for the role (Angelina Jolie turned it down twice). Although Stone may come across as emotionally stunted, Bullock offers her natural likeability as a necessary counterbalance. However, that observation short-changes her stellar work here, especially the pure physicality of her performance. Intriguingly, her character is not that far removed from the one she played nearly twenty years earlier in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/While-You-Were-Sleeping/dp/6304765266/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">While You Were Sleeping</a>&nbsp;in that both deal with personal losses with an emotional alertness that wins us over completely. Only this time she does it with a graceful maturity that deepens the catharsis of the incredible odyssey she experiences, this in spite of a few overtly sentimental moments thrown in for good measure.

A NASA space mission to attach an antennae to the Hubble telescope goes wrong when a Russian missile destroys one of their satellites and the resultant debris field wreaks havoc. The two remaining astronauts, Kowalski, the mission commander and NASA veteran, and Dr. Stone, a genius who has had only six months' training and is there only to attach the device she created, are stuck in space and must devise their own rescue.

""Gravity"" is one of the best choreographed, most visually awe-inspiring films I have ever seen. From the moment the film came on, I was lost in space, my hands gripping the seat, and my heart hammering. The music was a beautiful counterpoint, emphasizing the key moments without overwhelming viewers.

We saw the film in IMAX in an RPX environment--essentially, Regal charges extra for leather seats, widescreen and upgraded sound. It was worth the near double price of the ticket. ""Gravity"" is the best film I have seen in a long time.

This is probably one of the most researched films in history and the hard work really paid off. ""Gravity"" took 4.5 years to make. Sandra Bullock said choreographing the zero gravity pushed her body to the utter limits.  While rehearsing, Bullock had contact with a real astronaut, Catherine ""Cady"" Coleman, who sent her texts from outer space to tell her various aspects of her job. When Coleman finally got to see the film, she said it was one of the best depictions of her work she'd ever seen.

WARNING:  Some people have complained about dizziness and nausea from viewing the film. People with vertigo and problems with 3D should probably not see ""Gravity"" in 3D.

5878266,5,B00DY64A3U,"Director Alfonso Cuaron (Children of Men, Harry Potter and the Prisoner Of Azkaban) took and amazingly simple premise of a fictional STS (Space Transport System) mission using the now retired Space Shuttle fleet and bringing the `reality' of walking in space to complete and full visceral life on the big screen. ""Gravity"" is one of those films where you'll leave the theatre feeling like you had just experienced an amazing adventure yourself.

Written by Cuaron and his son Jonas Cuaron (Year of the Nail), this is a fresh original story that will move you with every frame of film. This is one of those rare films where the experience is only enhanced if you see it both in 3D and in IMAX. It was a thrilling adventure. It was breathtaking. It was scary. It was awe-inspiring and it was a roller-coaster of action and event after event.

Sandra Bullock (The Proposal, The Blind Side) plays Mission Specialist and medical engineer Ryan Stone who definitively gives an Academy Award deserving performance throughout this production. She plays a nervous, somewhat excited and an extremely professional scientist sent up in orbit to enhance the Hubble telescope.

The Mission Commander, Matt Kowalsky, who is on his last mission before retiring to Earth, is wonderfully played by George Clooney (Batman & Robin, The Descendants). He is light hearted, professional and focused but knows how to make his team feel good about their work and being in space.

Things go terrible wrong as a Russian Anti-Satellite test goes wrong and they have to destroy it in space. Shooting and destroying it with missiles from Earth. The debris from the explosion (which we never actually see the explosion) is blasted into orbit traveling in thousands of pieces at the speed of a bullet.  (Which is approximately 900 to over 1000 miles per hour.) At those speeds, with no atmosphere, no resistance and no sound, within half-a-second they rip through, the shuttle, the probes, the satellites are literally pelted to pieces and yes, even some of the crew.

Because this happens in space, it's Clooneys, character that figures out that they stay in orbit around Earth at that speed and appear every 90 minutes or so and again rip through anything in their path until their individual orbits decay. The film is basically about survival in what is literally the loneliest place you could ever be. Space. No sound. The finale is amazing and the depths that Bullock's character goes through and the performance she gives will leave you inspired.

With just the two of the most incredible actors Hollywood has to offer(Bullock and Clooney), along with director Cuaron, they take you a thrilling (and peaceful) journey through space, space stations and even satellites that orbit above us as you read this even now. With beautiful cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki (Children of Men, Sleepy Hollow) and incredibly accurate production design by Andy Nicholson (The Mummy, Alice In Wonderland) ""Gravity"" is a full blown `real' movie experience.

The panoramas of the Earth and space are amazing. The stars shimmering against Earth are beautiful and quiet and incredibly detailed. (Especially in the IMAX and 3D format.) The music by Steven Price (The World's End) is just as inspiring as the images you see. This is one of the best Science Fiction films I've seen in a long while and it feels so visceral and life-like that you actually feel good leaving the theatre.

Clooney's calm, aw shucks, Mr. Cool Right Stuff character only served to highlight the sheer inanity of Bullock's character.

In the two-minutes, we see a brief intense and desperate moment in the span of a long movie where Bullock's character, Ryan Stone, tries to grab hold of anything and everything as her situation spins out of control. Many thought, ""Is that it? Is that what the movies about?"" or, ""Two people in space. That movie looks silly."" Well, ""Gravity"" is far from silly.

On the other hand, what you see in that trailer is exactly what you will have in store when you sit down to watch it. It is exactly what the movie is about and there are only two people in the entire movie. You will also see an amazingly well crafted, intelligent, exquisite and visceral space journey that possibly puts all other movies of the same vain to shame.

Regardless of what you think of the trailer, you couldn't take your eyes off of it for two-minutes and that is exactly the way the full 90-minute movie is. ""Gravity"" takes you into space and treats you as if you were a tag-along for Ryan Stone's journey. The direction of Alfonso Cuaron is spot on, if not for a few minor moments of over-dramatization.

Cuaron may be most well known for his direction of ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", but he also directed ""Children of Men"" and one of my personal favorites, ""A Little Princess"". This is a phenomenal achievement for Cuaron and for the history and future of film-making. If you've ever desired to go to space, this may be as close as you will ever get.

They play a medical engineer and an astronaut who struggle to survive an accident that leaves them stranded in space. Both are doing a space walk when an emergency situation involving Russia ""accidentally"" shutting down one of its own satellites occurs and they must dodge debris and return to their ship to survive. The performance of Clooney is solid as usual but Bullock is forgettable. It is hard for Bullock's charm to shine through in her spacesuit. While the visuals are impressive there isn't much in the way of dialogue or story. Although it is billed as a thriller this is more of a drama and remains predictable, hollow and slightly dull. If you are most interested in the special effects then you may appreciate this movie.

5878270,5,B00DY64A3U,"Inevitably, there will be those how nit-pick this or that aspect of this very realistic, minimalist film. I, on the other hand, found it surprisingly good. Why reviewers have made mention that Sandra was not the first or, allegedly, even the fifth actress offered this part is entirely beyond me. Of the names mentioned that were offered the part before her, I believe, going in, she would have done a better job than any of them. As it turns out she did an excellent, completely credible job. An attractive 50 years of age, she is credible in the role in ways that the younger actresses simply would not have been. If you've seen the film, can you imagine Scarlet Johansen doing as good a job in this role?

Also, I think it was a particularly gutsy move to kill off the male lead... and the minimalism of both the plot and the number of actors in this film attests to how strong it had to be artistically in order to pull off its high entertainment value. For me, this film is strong and would pair particularly well as a double feature with ""The Abyss."" After the film, I was moved to reflect that space may be a necessary playground for scientists, but it will remain far too technical and dangerous (much less expensive)to think that even semi-ordinary people will end up there on holiday anytime in the foreseeable future.

Finally, I particularly appreciate a science fiction movie with such a strong human element. The movie is a human drama set in near-earth orbit instead of the typical SciFi where machines, unbelievable action stunts, and spectacular visuals must carry the audience. Thanks to George Clooney's journeyman performance and Sandra Bullock's dogged determination to keep it real, this film earns a place in my SciFi library when many other alleged ""block-busters"" have and will not. See the film on its own terms, and look past the surface panoramas.

5878272,5,B00DY64A3U,"WARNING: Spoilers for Gravity follow below.

The theme of rebirth and the visual motif of human pregnancy runs prevalent throughout Alfonso Cuaron's long awaited new film, Gravity. The film I think first takes a scientific view and then gradually moves towards a more spiritual, religious one at the end. We first see Earth and then the space shuttle and Hubble appear as a dot getting bigger and bigger as we (or they) come closer and closer to the screen. It's when they first appear as a dot that I got the feeling that I was seeing a picture of a Hydrogen atom orbiting around it's nucleus (the Earth). Hydrogen, as we all know (or should) is the most abundant chemical substance in the universe, yet it is also the smallest and simplest one there is on the periodic table. The first shot mimics this idea of the Macro and the Micro, with us starting off in extreme long shot and eventually going in on a single bolt that Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) has to retrieve for Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock). Nuts and bolts are also very small, simple things that are essential parts of bigger structures, much like Hydrogen. We then hear via Houston (Ed Harris in a genius bit of voice casting) say that the Russians have sent an anti-satellite missile that has inadvertently caused a lot of high speed debris to hurtle towards the shuttle. While this is the inciting incident that kicks the rest of the film into gear, we never see the missile hit the satellite. However, you could interpret the missile and satellite as a sperm and an egg respectively. A sperm and an egg coming together is what causes the chain reaction that leads to a baby being born, just as the missile and the satellite coming together causes the chain reaction that leads to Ryan's rebirth. At the beginning Ryan is actually referred to by her last name, Stone. Like a stone, Ryan is essentially lifeless more or less, oblivious to the wonderful view of Earth and the stars around her. She is only focused on completing the task at hand. It's only later on that she is called by her first name, when the rebirthing process has begun and she has started to become more characterized. Another thing I found intriguing was that there are three main places in the film: the shuttle, the Russian space station, and the Chinese one. They remind me of the three trimesters that make up a human pregnancy, which, when added together equal nine. The film itself is 90 minutes long, which can also be divided up into thirds, or the typical number of acts that make up the story structure of a feature film. Three is also a reference to the Holy Trinity in Christianity although we get an interesting close up shot of a miniature Buddha statue in the Chinese Shenzhou capsule. Take that to mean whatever you want it to (or anything else I write here for that matter). One shot shows Ryan in a fetal position in the Russian station, which is more or less the same position a fetus is in when in it's second trimester. When Ryan has decided to give up and commit suicide, it's like an attempted abortion. Ryan attempts to ""abort"" her own rescue mission after finding out the Soyuz has no fuel. At the end when Ryan finally does make it back to Earth, she has to strip down to her underwear as her space suit is drowning her. She takes her first gasp of air and drags herself out of the water into the earthy mud. Water is an elemental symbol for life and earth is the stuff we all came from originally (if you believe in the bible. I do for one). Ryan then then offers up her first ever prayer, ""Thank you,"" to whatever deity she has now chosen to believe in, then gets to her knees, then to her feet, and then takes her first steps, reborn as a new person, facing a green wilderness of unknown possibilities.

Other thoughts:

I enjoyed the references to 2001: A Space Odyssey. Having there be no sound in space, the prevalent breathing sounds of the characters while in their space suits, effectively them fish out of water in the ocean of space. Even the fetal image of Ryan reminded me of the Star Child.

A bit of a reference to Alien with Ryan announcing over the headset that she was the only survivor of her crew, and the fact that she's a woman.

Gravity feels like a companion piece to Children of Men. I'll let you draw your own conclusions as to why.

I enjoyed the score, especially the rising musical que associated with the menacing debris field. Reminded me of the Joker's theme from The Dark Knight.

I thought it was very silly having Ryan move around with a fire extinguisher. It reminded me of Wall-E.

I didn't particularly like the shot of the satellite burning up in the sky. Looked too much like the Columbia. Just a quibble but it made me cringe a little bit.",1381017600,5,4745,4.490150637311704
5878273,5,B00DY64A3U,"""Gravity,"" directed and co-written by Alfonso Cuarn, stars Sandra Bullock as Mission Specialist Ryan Stone, George Clooney as Mission Commander Matt Kowalski, and an army of visual effects wizards. Stone and Kowalski run into a huge dose of bad luck when a communications satellite explodes and bombards their space shuttle with dangerous shrapnel. Stone and Kowalski lose contact with their controllers in Houston and are left to their own devices. Both of them know that their chances for survival are slim. Nothing further of the plot can be revealed, lest the movie be spoiled for potential viewers.

Sandra Bullock delivers a gutsy and poignant performance as a brilliant but lonely scientist who has little motivation to fight against overwhelming odds. After all, she believes that no one on earth will mourn her passing. Clooney, as usual, plays a self-deprecating and wisecracking hunk, who teases Stone and prods her to hang on, no matter what.

Much of the film is driven by amazing stunts, mind-boggling computer graphics, the gorgeous cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki, and constant doses of peril from fire, loss of oxygen, and that pesky space junk hurtling towards our heroes. Steven Price's pulse-pounding musical score serves as a fitting backdrop for this adrenaline-fueled film. The brief running time, a mere hour and a half, is sufficient to tell a story that is more visual than intellectual. Those who lack an advanced degree in astrophysics will have no idea if what we are seeing bears any resemblance to reality. Still, even if Cuarn's facts are way off-base, he is a genius at eliciting a strong emotional response. We cannot help but root for Stone as she vacillates between hope and despair; her courage and vulnerability keep us enthralled. ""Gravity"" is an electrifying thrill-ride that should garner a wide and appreciative audience.",1381017600,,1866,5.196013289036545
5878274,4,B00DY64A3U,"Most movies set in space show humanity effortlessly sailing through the void as would-be conquerors of the universe.  It's rarer for a film to show how dangerous space is, and how easily it can kill us, and no film in recent memory has done so as memorably as Gravity.

On a routine mission to work on the Hubble telescope, Dr. Ryan Stone and her companions come under assault from space rubble, and in the aftermath, the stranded survivors, cut off from help, must find a way to get down to Earth before running out of air...if other hazards don't kill them first.

Gravity's greatest strength is its visual spectacle, which is perfect in almost every way.  The visual effects are spectacular, the camerawork is flawless (including some very impressive shots that go on for several minutes without a single cut), and the depiction of how disasters in space might play out is both terrifying and awe-inspiring, with characters struggling with zero-g disorientation, and scrambling to grab onto things in a weightless environment, and how destructive debris can be while shooting around at hundreds of miles an hour.  As a visual and visceral experience, Gravity is without peer.

But while the film has perfect visuals, it's surprising how light the story is.  In fact, it almost feels non-existent due to how simple it is, with a lack of twists, bad guys, and conspiracies that other films feature.  And while there's no harm in having a straightforward story, I wished there was more to aside from ""Let's get back to Earth.""  More moral decisions and difficult choices would have helped greatly (there's one choice early on, but because we haven't had time to truly know the characters, it has little impact), and the characters are equally simplistic, with very little time given to know them and their motivations beyond wanting to survive.  While Sandra Bullock does a fine job, I didn't feel connected to her on an emotional level.  The some goes for George Clooney, who doesn't even get a backstory or characteristics besides being the confident, take-charge commander type.  The two are likeable enough; I just wish there was a lot more to them then what we're given.

While Gravity technically falls into the category of ""Visually spectacular but weak plot"", I decided to nudge it up to four stars based sorely on how good a job it does when focusing on spectacle and the struggle of its characters to survive.  It falters when it tries to develop those characters, but there is no denying that Gravity is a fantastically gripping survival film that sets a new standard for the ""Disaster in Space"" genre.",1381017600,19,2613,4.8690744920993225
5878275,1,B00DY64A3U,"Gravity is hollow. Beautiful, but hollow. A $100 million dollar film with a shell of a story, Gravity begins in media res with three astronauts orbiting a small satellite of sorts, making small talk, and repairing a broken component part. After say ten minutes, some space debris sends the astronauts, at least one, whirling end over end into the abyss. The camera goes with them, topsy-turvy, spinning and spinning with so much force it'll make you dizzy. And don't expect this to let up. Throughout the film, the camera roams around, in and out of helmets, through debris, and along the heavenly expanse of space. It all looks weirdly fuzzy though, lacking the pristine sheen one might have expected (or seen in a similarly staged film like Sunshine). The film itself is boring. The story, such as it is, is pure survival, with little to no subtext or emotional weight (save a crappy tacked-on backstory about loss that feels about as personal as the gaping suck-hole around it) and probably the worst performance of George Clooney's career. The man has shown an amazing depth in movies like Syriana. Here he plays George Clooney: hammy, reliable and unrelentingly dull. Sandra Bullock is a bit better, but is really only around to hyperventilate and occasionally strip down to her undergarments when the paper-thin script asks her to. Speaking of the script, the film is less a story than it is an amalgam of clunky plot devices: space debris, inexplicable fires, and of course, the threat of losing oxygen. Sure the film feels weightless and the CGI hardly looks fake. But compared to Cuaron's daring, satirical and multi-layered Children of Men, the film feels about as interesting as a space opera drummed up by a third grader. Worth seeing only for nauseating camera-angle enthusiasts and anyone interested in how a lot of money can be used to create a thing of frigid beauty, zero heart, and a lack of lasting impact.",1381017600,46,1925,4.871951219512195

The first opening scene was unlike anything I'd ever seen before on film--a continuous shot of about 10-15 minutes worth of soundless space, a stunning view of Earth, and then...was that Ed Harris I heard?  Oh man, the right stuff was back!

Alfonso Cuaron and his crew (the supporting players both on and off screen) deserve every accolade possible for this masterpiece. Cuaron is a cinematic genius! I read in an article that this filmmaking endeavor took him and his son, Jonas, four years before production started. What a feat in filmmaking! Everything about ""Gravity"" is spectacular. Oscars will be flowing for this film...

Sandra Bullock, well, she was born to play this role. She gave the performance of a lifetime. There were no quick takes.  These were very long scenes--and for an actor (all alone)--no interaction to play off another... for her to had conveyed that sense of helplessness and terror and heart-wrenching hope. How did she do it?!

The supporting cast was great: Ed Harris' voice-over at NASA's Mission Control Center and George Clooney--the comic relief.  I don't normally like him, but in this role, he was fantastic.

Steven Price...where had he been all this time??? This man was another genius!  The film score was impeccable.  The music added to the intensity and action of the film--and the climax--WOW!!! It was an edge of your seat ride--literally!

Hands-down the best film of 2013!!! Also, it's one of the greatest films I've ever seen. It's a groundbreaking--unique movie experience--which has been long, long overdue.

But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalski completely alone--tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth...and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.

The cast led by Sandra Bullock (as Dr. Ryan Stone) & George Clooney (as Matt Kowalski) is brilliant. The directing by Alfonso Cuaron (who also wrote the story & screenplay, produced and edited) is brilliant. The story & screenplay by Cuaron & his son Jonas is brilliant.

5878279,4,B00DY64A3U,"This film is visually stunning, technologically challenging, and psychologically tense.
It's also nearly ruined by being overly sentimental.

It stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Actually, they aren't just the stars, they are the entire live-action cast. Anyway, they both play astronauts as part of a team fixing something on the space shuttle. When a Russian satellite is destroyed, the resulting debris causes both of them to start floating away into the depths of space, where they will die a horrible lonely death unless they can find a way to rescue themselves. The whole movie is just the series of attempts made by Clooney and Bullock to get back into some spacecraft that can carry them back to Earth.

This is probably the most scientifically accurate space movie I've ever seen. Without being anchored into a specific direction by gravity, there is no such thing as up and down, left and right. The film is shot with this constantly rotating perspective (if you get motion sick easily, this may be a problem for you). The film also acknowledges that since there is no air in space, there would be no noise - this is mostly followed in the film, although apparently fire extinguishers are exempt from this rule. Oh, and their actual plan to return to Earth is also scientifically impossible. I'm not giving anything away on screen, but in real life, they would be doomed 15 minutes into the movie.

Although now that I think about it, their plan is not more impossible than the idea of Sandra Bullock being a genius astronaut (I mean, really? Considering only one female actor was needed for the entire damn film, how did we end up with the star of ""Miss Congeniality"" and ""The Net""?)

The movie plays on the term ""gravity"", exploiting all the definitions of the word. At the same time, the movie tries to be about the importance of holding on to life in the face of near-certain death. This caused some emotionally manipulative moments that brought the natural drama to a screeching halt and threw me off the film's trajectory quicker than a corpse attached to a jetpack.

Visually, the film is a masterpiece and should be seen on the big screen. It is creative, nerve-wracking, and serves as a fairly realistic impression of what it must be like to work in space.

The effects are staggering.  The views are mesmerizing.  The soundtrack is grand.  But Ms. Bullock's acting is what really makes this film the ride of the century.

Sandra Bullock's emotions come through in a way that brings me close to her.  I feel her fear, her anguish, her hopelessness. It's her acting talent that brings me into the story and gives me a part in the film.

Yes, the special effects tell a compelling story, as does the soundtrack.  But Ms. Bullock's acting puts this film over the top.  It is clearly the best movie this year; and for this genre, it's certainly the best ever.

I watched it in 3D.  For most films, I think 3D detracts (and distracts) from the story - but this film is better for being in 3D.  I also think that the experience in the theater is well worth it.

The story opens with a George Clooney voice-over. We meet astronauts working to repair a satellite. This shows how calm such a silent world can be. I reluctantly saw the movie in 3D, but this was one occasion that I came away feeling that it added to the experience. It almost made me dizzy seeing Ryan Stone (Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (Clooney) go about their routine business with Earth looming large in the background. Indeed, the cinematography was breathtaking throughout the 90 minutes.

I don't want to give away too many details, but if you have seen the trailer or even looked at the poster, you'll know that this movie is far from being a calm ride. An accident sends debris racing toward the astronauts like some kind of deadly shrapnel. What follows is a story about the strength of the human spirit, and the will to survive against all odds. Remember that the word gravity has more than one meaning.

While I enjoyed Sandra Bullock's performances in The Blind Side and Speed, I would hardly describe myself as a fan. However, I left the theater thinking that she carried the whole movie, and it's easily the most accomplished performance of her career.

Alfonso Cuarn directed Y Tu Mam Tambin, Children of Men, and the best Harry Potter movie (Azkaban), but this is comfortably my favorite from his impressive portfolio. The story is lean, gripping, thoughtful, thrilling, scary, breathtaking, beautiful, and emotional, and feels perfectly paced at every point. He doesn't insult us by giving too much exposition, and that draws us deeper into the story. His use of extreme close-ups is another reason we are drawn to these characters. It's hard to avoid feeling that you are a part of the movie.

As I watched, I thought of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Moon, Apollo 13, Cast Away, Alien, and a few other great movies. Cuarn lets us see his characters thinking, and that's a good thing. Remember that astronauts are not selected because they are stupid or incapable of adapting in extreme situations. I'm always impressed when I see a movie which takes the trouble to show how people really think. It's not an easy thing to do well. This choice works perfectly and helps the whole story succeed because it's so believable.

Although the visuals dazzled on a regular basis, my favorite shot in the whole movie was Sandra Bullock in the fetal position. It jumped out at me as being so appropriate for the scene, and it was a stroke of genius. You'll know what I mean when you see it. The opening titles remind us that there is no sound in space, just as Kubrick depicted almost 50 years ago.

I admire this movie so much that I would happily watch it again tomorrow. It's a wild 90 minutes. I left the theater feeling as if it was an effort to be back in the real world. I was totally immersed in the story to the point of being almost unable to function when it was over. I'm glad I had a long walk back to the car so that I could catch my breath.

There are so many reasons to see this movie, even if you hate science fiction. It won't be forgotten when the awards season arrives. See it immediately. I would even go as far to say you should see it in 3D.",1380931200,363,3436,4.5575364667747165

What makes this movie different from its many predecessors, including ""Marooned"" and ""Apollo 13"", is the stunningly realistic recreation of being weightless in space. And somehow, the movie manages to endow this environment, poised in orbit between a colorful earth and the limitless black void of space, with a surprising degree of claustrophobia.

The premise is simple. A U.S. space shuttle delivers a four-person crew to orbit to repair a satellite. Senior astronaut Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) and medical engineer (and rookie astronaut) Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) are on a spacewalk, working on the damaged satellite. Suddenly, Mission Control in Houston (the voice of Ed Harris) warns that a debris cloud from a destroyed Russian satellite is approaching at speed...

The collision between debris cloud and space shuttle is catastrophic. Kowalsky and a terrified Stone find themselves in desperate straits, untethered and with few options. How their dilemma is resolved is the exciting and frightening heart of the movie, a series of action sequences that should keep most viewers glued to their seats.

Very few American films today classified as 'entertainment', actually can rise to the level of Art. 'Gravity', the new sci-fi, 'Space Odyssey-like' thriller, starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, I'm happy to report, has made it into that pantheon. You would never imagine that a film that only features two actors, can be so compelling and captivating; but coupled with a barrage of extraordinary digital effects, co-writer and director Alfonso Cuarn, has pulled it off!

The story begins with Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock), a bio-medical engineer and veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (Clooney), on a spacewalk outside their space shuttle, conducting routine experiments, when they're alerted by Mission Control in Houston that a Russian satellite has exploded and the debris field is headed straight for the shuttle (inciting incident). In a spectacular sequence, the shuttle is destroyed and Stone is hurled around in space still tethered to the craft, bouncing on and off of it, like a ping pong ball. When she's finally separated from the craft, Kowalski, utilizing his thruster pack to maneuver, saves her from floating out into space and they make their way back to the space shuttle, which they discover has been destroyed and the rest of the crew members dead (one of the astronauts who had been outside the craft, has his face blown off).

As we break into Act II, Stone and Kowalski must make their way to the International Space Station (ISS), if they have any chance of survival. The 'ticking time clock', so inimical to thrillers, is used to great effect throughout the film. Kowalski sets his watch for 90 minutes, because that's when the debris field, will make its first orbit around the earth, and come back and possible hit them again. While floating toward the ISS, we learn of Stone's back story (her daughter was tragically killed in a schoolyard accident and she then decided to devote her life to her work). Using the thruster, Stone and Kowalski arrive at the ISS, only to find the stakes are raised again, as the ISS crew has abandoned ship and the Russian Soyuz space module has been damaged, useless for re-entry to earth. Even more thrilling and shattering is that Stone finds herself tangled in the already deployed parachute from the module and is holding on to Kowalski, whose weight is causing the parachute cords to break.

Suffice it to say, 'Gravity' avoids Hollywood endings by realistically arguing that space exploration is a danger business--and may result in death. Stone finds herself alone after Kowalski 'cuts himself loose' and we approach the 'dark moment' of the second Act, as Stone must maneuver the damaged module to a Chinese space station, Tiangong. But when she discovers that the module has no more fuel, it appears there's no hope. Stone's hopelessness is highlighted when she reaches a farmer on a short wave frequency, who doesn't speak English. The dark moment of the second act, always results in the protagonist discovering a solution to the problem; that happens during her hallucination that Kowalski has returned to help her, advising that she can still use the re-entry rockets to move the craft.

Now the protagonist must implement the 'solution' as we head toward the climax in Act III. There's more spectacular, edge of your seat machinations, when Stone uses a fire extinguisher as a makeshift thruster, to get herself over and into the Tiangong. I won't go into the rest of it, except to say that Stone must not only get herself out of a real pickle during the fiery re-entry to earth, but must solve a new crisis, after splashing down into a body of water, in a remote section on earth.

While I've been hard on Sandra Bullock, especially for her recent lame performance in 'The Heat', here she proves (when given the right material) that she's as good as any of the top stars out there today. It's an extraordinarily nuanced, low key performance, coupled with some physically demanding stunts, which I suspect were not all dependent on digital effects. Do you hear 'Oscar' calling? Clooney too is masterful, as he also delivers just the right kind of restrained performance to make this whole thing believable.

Alfonso Cuarn has admitted that not everything we see on screen is physically or scientifically possible. But so what! Much of the technical aspect is true to form and looks quite believable. 'Gravity' is much more than a spectacular visual feast--it's about a struggle against overwhelming odds. When Bullock (Stone) emerges from a watery tomb, after 'going it alone', a la 'Robinson Crusoe', there is the sense that we've just witnessed an awe-inspiring, story of survival and an uplifting paean, to the human spirit.",1380931200,7,4744,4.974779319041614

Just moments after this movie ended my daughter leaned over to me and declared, ""This is the most perfect film I have ever seen in just about every way.""

I had to agree.

GRAVITY gives you everything: thrilling action, awesome visuals, incomparable cinematic spectacle, a terrifying scenario, an exciting adventure, and a masterpiece of minimalist characterization. They all combine in one pedal-to-the-metal slam-bam technically perfect movie that gives you equal shots of hope and hopelessness from the first frame to the very last.

It is as electrifying a film as I have ever seen, with scarcely a down moment in it, hardly a misused frame. I won't spend time telling you anything about the plot; if the trailers haven't told you enough about why this film is a must see, then I can give you two words that should do it...

Sandra Bullock.

She is not only in practically every frame of the movie, but she exposes herself emotionally here in more ways than I could count: she is equal parts victim and heroine, emotional and calculating, frightened and bold, wounded and powerful.  She is a tortured soul who reveals herself in dribs and drabs, revealing her emotional torment when it will have the most effect.  The movie is as much about what HAS happened to her as what IS happening to her. She is able to make herself as interesting and captivating as the events that occur during the film, and this is important: rather than simply being a movie about a series of cascading terrors, it is equally about the human spirit, the ""stuff"" that lies inside us that drives us to go on when going on seems impossible.

GRAVITY is amazing. See it in IMAX 3D if you can; it is worth the money. The technology depicted in the movie is stunning--but I imagine I will be as amazed when I finally get the DVD and find out HOW these truly amazing scenes were shot. Alfonso Cuaron does remarkable job as director, co-writer and co-editor of this absolutely wonderful accomplishment. His technically perfect movie never loses track of the actor within it--I won't be surprised if this achieves Best Picture, Best Directing and Best Acting nominations this year, notwithstanding a half-dozen other technically-related ones.

There have been some critics who have found fault with the movie's accuracy when it comes to the positioning of the space stations, the likelihood of a debris field causing a ""Kesslar Syndrome"" this devastating, and some other technical flaws, but I will leave these people to their respective perturbations. To me it doesn't matter if GRAVITY is science fiction or simply fiction about science. What it definitely IS is a tour de force balls-to-the-wall spectacle that will leave you gasping. Don't miss it.",1380931200,711,2763,4.897216274089936

Most movie lovers can remember seeing a film for the first time that really got their attention.  Usually it was in a real movie theater.  For me it was ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""  The juxtaposition of a flung femur bone transfiguring into a space shuttle lining up to dock at an orbiting station, all to the backdrop of classical music was mind blowing to this science fiction lover.  A few year later, sitting in a large theater I was again mesmerized by a giant space ship moving slowly across dark space.  ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" had a new technical trick at its disposal.  Dolby Surround Sound.  A new generation will likely have ""Gravity"" to look back on.  Yes, it's that good.

Director Alfonso Cuaron (""Children of Men""), who also wrote the screenplay with his son Jonas, has managed to provide an electrifying thriller with a basic story.  A flight crew headed by Lt. (a lieutenant, really?) Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) have been sent to repair the Hubble Telescope.  The scientist in charge of the repairs is the ever-so-serious Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock).  There are no other actors who have any role of substance other than the voice of Ed Harris at Mission Control early on.

In a quick turn of events, it is learned that the Russians have destroyed one of their spy satellites.  The explosion has set off a chain reaction of debris hurtling through space taking out other satellites along the way.  With only minutes to react, Kowalski's crew attempt to get the shuttle out of orbit.  They don't.  Now in survival mode, Kowalski and Stone must figure out how to get back to Earth.  This becomes even more complicated, as radio communication with Mission Control has been severed.

Cuaron provides Sandra Bullock an opportunity to show her acting range and she responds with a performance that will be remembered for a long time.  Stone's early panic, as the space debris knocks her away from Kowalski and the shuttle, comes across to the audience.  We see the terror in her eyes, in her breathing and in the fogging helmet shield.  The other star of the film is Cuaron's cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki and the visual and special effects department.  It is the most amazing thing I think I've ever seen on screen.  And yes, see it now.  Don't wait for this movie to come to you by Netflix.  And yes, see it in 3D.  I pick and choose when to spend an extra $3 or $4 dollars on 3D and I made the right decision here.

Gravity has several meanings.  The most used and obvious one for this movie has to do with the force of bodies falling toward Earth.  But gravity also is defined as a serious or critical nature.  Also, serious or dignified behavior.  All apply.  Cuaron and his team will likely need a truck to load nominations come Oscar time.  Don't miss it.",1380931200,3,2838,4.628514056224899
5878290,5,B00DY64A3U,"After over two years of waiting and hoping, we finally set course. Gravity tells a story about survival, loneliness, with a grieving character (Ryan Stone). The film focuses on the pleasures of space but also the fear that it can bring. Some may say the film lacks in story and instead is big on visuals, I disagree. The visuals themselves are used as characters and emotions. Bullock was phenomenal and if she were not to get a nomination for an Oscar I would be surprised, though I would not be surprised if she won. Clooney to does an excellent job being the spirit that guides Bullock (Stone) in her journey through the silence and uncertainty of space. All in all this film is breathtaking from many areas, visually and emotionally. This is a film that will stand in time as the best ""space"" film created to date and will also be beloved by audiences of all generations. In short, an instant classic.",1380931200,7,905,4.592592592592593
5878291,5,B00DY64A3U,"The movie is great, the most immersive ever.  Spoiler alert for the rest of this review.  From the dream sequence with the return of the experienced pilot character, the physics of the movie get very dream like. The act of getting the escape capsule to within a few meters over 100 kilometers or so of distance with the use of a set of rear facing rockets meant for landing is the sort of thing that makes winning the lottery seem probable.  Also having enough velocity to close the distance, but yet able to attach to the Chinese station with just a hand hold is similarly impossible.  My interpretation of the second half of the movie is that once the dream sequence starts is that the movie may be like the conclusion of the TV series ""Lost"". Possibly as much about accepting death with a clear heart and head than a Homeric saga of miracles in life that return the hero home against all odds.",1380844800,3,896,4.445121951219512

Gravity is an incredible film.  Absolutely incredible.  Peerless in direction, Gravity features career defining performances from Bullock and Clooney, absolutely stunning, top-notch special effects and incredibly effective drama that brings this seemingly simplistic idea and narrative to life.  But above all, Gravity is the most fantastic space movie ever made.

Gravity is filled with visual splendor, and packed with layers of metaphor and meaning (much of which I am still debating with colleagues on)!  I haven't come out of a film for a long while equally blown away and perplexed, in a good way of course.  I love films that are appreciable by both audiences: those looking for entertainment (Which they will receive in spades), and those looking for a film that transcends being a film in the sleekest of ways.  Other elements of the film are peerless; the cinematography is beautiful, the minimalist score is effective, and the sound design is perfected.

It's hard to describe my feelings towards Gravity without abusing my ""positive adjective"" collection, but I'll just say the Gravity is pretty darned close to perfect.  It's original, intense and very entertaining.  It's also highly re-watchable with a purpose; it's packed with genius and beauty.

This is one perilous journey I personally want to experience over and over, deciphering it's layers and themes.  It will forever stick in my memory.  A one of a kind, incredibly exceptional experience.

Side note: 3D usage transcends Avatar and my personal favorite of the summer Pacific Rim.  It's essential to the experience, and proves to be one of the finest in-theater experiences ever.",1380844800,9,1764,5.136842105263158
5878293,5,B00DY64A3U,"I first heard about the movie Gravity from Phil Plait's ""Bad Astronomy"" website. He's a real stickler for scientifically accurate movies, and what he'd heard about Gravity had him very enthused early on.

So, early in the morning on the day of release, I went down to the theater, caught the first non-IMAX 3D showing, and was blown away.

Let's start with the opening visuals of Earth from orbit. Gorgeous. That alone was worth the ticket price. It gets better as the shuttle and its crew come into view.

Once the accident occurs and the two surviving astronauts find themselves in a desperate situation, I was astounded by how realistic the physics felt. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, and in space things behave very differently from what we're used to here on the ground. The way the astronauts yo-yoed about on their tethers as they tried to grab onto each other or onto a nearby structure had my heart pounding.

A common complaint from purists about space movies is the all-too-familiar sound of whooshing spaceships or the ear-splitting thuds as things explode. Not in Gravity. The only sounds heard in vacuum are those transmitted by the spacesuits. When things explode, the music is what heightens the drama.

The two main characters were played by George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, and they do a fine job of acting, perfectly believable throughout the film. Enough said.

As Phil Plait pointed out on his site, Gravity does stretch the science in a few places. In real life, it would be virtually impossible to get from the orbit of the Hubble Space Telescope to that of the International Space Station. That's why, during the final 2009 telescope servicing mission, they actually had a spare shuttle ready on the launching pad, just in case the astronauts needed rescue. But, obviously, there would be no movie if the producers insisted on this level of accuracy, so they fudged things a bit. No matter.

As for the PG-13 rating, it's warranted. This is one VERY intense movie. Are you old enough to remember the first time you saw Jaws in the theater back in 1975? Remember the way everyone shrieked when that severed head popped out of the hole in the side of the boat? Well, there are a couple of comparable scenes in Gravity early on. No one shrieked, but it was definitely gruesome.

There's also a bit of language, but nothing I can't imagine myself saying if I were suddenly cast adrift in a space accident.

All in all, this one is well worth the seeing, and I'm glad I did. But, with this level of intensity, could I stand another viewing? Maybe if I go with a friend.",1380844800,4,2618,4.686274509803922
5878294,5,B00DY64A3U,"I just got back from watching Gravity and I am still in awwww. Ryan (Sandra Bullock) and Matt (George Clooney) are on a space walk when debris hit the area they are working on causing them be detached from their ship and spin off in space. While trying to figure out a way to get home Ryan has one heck of a fight on her hands. Sandra Bullock does a phenomenal job in this film and I am sure she will get an Oscar nomination, if not the award itself for Best Actress. Whats even more phenomenal is how she carries the entire film herself with very little or no interaction from other people. When you add the 3D element to this movie combined with the stunning visuals, and wonderful performances it just takes you on that emotional journey even more. This is the type of film that showcases what 3D can do when given the right material. I will not give away any of the movie as to not spoil for those who have not seen it yet. I do highly recommend this work of art that is nothing short of a brilliant masterpiece that will truly immerse you and leave you breathless at times.",1380844800,21,1078,4.237864077669903

Cinemablend's ""To 3D or Not"" scale ranks Gravity 35 out of 35, but their reviews are of the film seen in a theater. The only thing I can assume here is that the blu ray is different. There is nearly NO 3D in most of this movie. (LG OLED65E6P) There are a few scenes of Sandra Bullock floating through narrow corridors and debris flying toward you that offer some good 3D, but that's 5 minutes. The vast majority of the film on this blu ray appears flat. Removed my glasses several times and saw nearly no separation between images on screen. Didn't see this one in the theater, so I can only judge the blu ray. The movie is good, but surprised to review this 3D blu ray as one of the worst in my collection.",1529193600,,844,4.184049079754601
