8670504,5,B009D4GS14,A lovely version of the great English classic,1515715200,,45,4.75
8670505,1,B009D4GS14,"First off, the fact that this video is categorized under COMEDY, is funny, itself.

One thing I'm learning - never order something unless there's an option to see a trailer. You would wonder how someone could screw up ""Jack and The Beanstalk"", but for a 3 year old little girl, this was scary. There's no animation and the drawings are not very 'kid' friendly. Even the music was bizarre.

This is nothing like the story from childhood.

I would NOT recommend purchasing this for a young child.",1472342400,,494,4.655172413793103
8670506,5,B009D4GS14,"My three year old daughter absolutely adores this version of jack and the beanstalk.  Personally I think it's especially wonderful for young children because of the story book narrative.  Instead of just being an ordinary movie, it is presented and read as a story.  Small children love being read to.  This move is also really great in the way it focused into the characters reactions while the narrator is speaking.  The narrator does an exceptional job at character voices.  Even as an adult watching it, the characters come alive!  I would recommend this movie to anyone with young children that has a love for classic fairytale a the way we do.  You will get lost in the story, which will also bring back wonderful memories of childhood. So make yourself a grilled cheese sandwich, and enjoy this classic story .",1471478400,,817,4.785714285714286

Isn't it sad what a poor example this story is?
Teaches disobedience & repeated theft.",1441584000,,159,4.517241379310345

8670511,5,B009D4GS14,"I watched this with my 4 year old grand daughter. She did not want to watch it but once it started she was glued to the Tv. Now it has become her favorite movie to watch. I loved the story as a child and had the musical score on "" records "" .. This version is wonderful and I am so happy to have introduced my grand daughter to the story and music. There is no need for words in this movie but it stimulates conversations.",1429142400,2,422,3.9186046511627906
8670512,1,B009D4GS14,My kids didn't like it.  The animation was terrible.,1417219200,,52,4.777777777777778
8670513,5,B009D4GS14,I downloaded the audio book for my 3 year old granddaughter.  She was glued to her seat.  I gave it 5 stars because the next time she visited she wanted to see it again and the pictures were well demonstrated.  Holding a 3 year old still for 20 minutes deserves 3 stars!,1394064000,2,270,4.153846153846154
