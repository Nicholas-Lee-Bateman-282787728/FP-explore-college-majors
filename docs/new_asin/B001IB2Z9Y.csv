3646554,2,B001IB2Z9Y,"I love science shows.  I love everything physics / astronomy / space.  I hate this series.  It seams lately that the Science Channel, The History Channel, and others try to make complex subjects simple by using moronic metaphors and annoying examples.  It has been a while since I STOPPED watching this series so I can't cite examples, but they are many.
I suppose this type of show makes science more understandable to someone who would never watch science shows to begin with, but then, whats the point.  I hope the producers of these shows get a clue, because for people like me who actually like the subject matter, this is painful.  We can handle straight science without insulting our intelligence.",1240358400,39,704,4.825
3646555,5,B001IB2Z9Y,"""The Universe: Collector's Edition Megaset""
(History Channel/A&E)
---------------------------------------------------------------
I bought this massive, 14-DVD set while in search of video materials to stimulate the the curiosity of a five-year old whose school has been doing a lot of space-related reading and discussion. I wanted to find materials that could build on what she's already learned, and would be exciting but not too complicated or disturbing. Based on other reviews, I have high hopes for this collection, although I think it may not work (yet) for this young, budding scientist.  I plan to review the episodes as I view them, so the review you see here so far is not a complete one. More like a review blog, I guess.

Anyway, the series that this ""mega-set"" collects are as follows:
""The Universe: The Complete Season One""
""The Universe: The Complete Season Two""
""The Planets""
""How the Earth Was Made""

And here are my reviews:

THE UNIVERSE, SEASON ONE: THE SUN
---------------------------------------
Informative, but sensationalistic. Although many of the visual metaphors help illustrate complex phenomena -- billiard balls used to show how atomic particles interact, for example -- they are also confusing and misleading in many ways. The real problem, however, is in the overly dramatized, alarmist framing of the narration. One of those oily-voiced announcers, the kind that record political attack ads, tells us over and over of the ""deadly"" threat of the sun's ""terrible power"", computer graphics show the Earth buffeted by ""explosions"" of solar energy; at one point an actual shotgun is pointed at a beachball-sized model of the earth and is fired repeatedly, until the ball is destroyed. Yes, solar radiation can disrupt modern telecommunications, but is all the violent hype necessary to explain this? I learned a lot from this episode, but I wouldn't show it to a young child; it's simply too disturbing and confusing.

More to come. Stay tuned.",1238716800,73,1976,5.300319488817891
3646556,3,B001IB2Z9Y,"I haven't yet played the DVDs - they arrived only today.  But the item was listed as 'new' - and they cannot be new because they are repackaged and the inside casing is terribly worn and not clean...the discs themselves have been cleaned and the cleaning fluid is streaked across the DVDs - I don't mind buying used items but state that they are used...state that they are 'like new' but when they have been played, when the INSIDE casing is worn down at the edges and along the sides, it's obvious these DVDs have been played...I will never purchase from this company again: ABC-DVD (the DVDs may play beautifully but that's not the problem -the problem is stating that something is new when it obviously is not!)",1281744000,,714,4.578125
3646557,5,B001IB2Z9Y,"I purchased this for my 6yr old son, and he loves it.  He's been very into all things space related for a few years now, and this fits the bill perfectly.  In our area, we have ""furlough Fridays"" with no school due to budget cuts.  On those days off, we work on some math, then watch an episode of ""The Universe"" and write about what he's learned.  He loves the DVD's, and has picked up lot's of interesting facts... it's even led to an interest in studying the periodic table since they talk about the chemical make-up of different atmospheres, and how the Sun lives it's life.  This is a great jumping off point for people and kids just getting into learning about Astronomy and Physics.",1265241600,8,689,4.436507936507937
3646558,5,B001IB2Z9Y,This is by far the best of any series explaining our Universe.  A must if you have an interest in the subject.,1262995200,,110,4.0
3646559,2,B001IB2Z9Y,"Product came in a timely manner and was packaged nicely.  However, more than one disk was damaged.  I won't buy here again.",1262131200,6,123,4.545454545454546
3646560,5,B001IB2Z9Y,This is truly the most amazing series ever put together to explain our universe and Earth.  This series answers questions that most of us though could never be answered.  Exhilarating and fantastic photos and graphics make this series a must have collection.  This is the kind os series one can watch over and over again learning more every time they see it.  I highly recommend their other series How the Earth was made as well (series 1).,1260230400,,440,4.675324675324675
3646561,4,B001IB2Z9Y,"I like to have lots of pictures of planets and moons and simulations of other things that happen in the Universe.  I like to think about all the things scientists are doing and learning now about the Universe.  Books like astronomy 101 help me understand what they are doing on these videos.  Spends a little too much time on the scientists sometimes and not enough time on the various pictures since there is so much to view.  Like a little more info about the various probes into our solar system.  I am still kind of a novice so who knows, I should have given 5 stars.",1258329600,,571,4.349056603773585
3646562,5,B001IB2Z9Y,The Universe has been a wonderful teaching tool to use in my high school Earth Science class.  This video set has everything we are covering in the book in an easy to understand and thought provoking method the students really get excited about watching.  I teach both academic and general level classes and the questions the kids come up with are high level questions I could never get them to ask from reading their text book.  The History Channel is my hero as they always come up with documentaries that are great for exploring a world where students in the middle of Illinois may never experience or think about.,1257897600,,617,4.6422018348623855
3646563,5,B001IB2Z9Y,"When my daughter and I first found The Universe on the History Channel, we knew it was a set we would have to own. We have been enjoying this set very much and all get so engrossed in each episode that the house could burn down around us. I would recommend it to anyone and feel it is appropriate for all age groups.",1255478400,5,316,4.031746031746032
3646564,5,B001IB2Z9Y,"I got this set for my 8 year old grandson.  He is fascinated by the science.  When he visits, he will ask to see one of these discs.  I find them interesting as well and I think they're great for all ages.  Those who have a curious mind will enjoy the series.",1252972800,14,259,3.923076923076923
3646565,2,B001IB2Z9Y,"I watched the first two episodes.

The narrator's delivery style gets old very fast.

The use of quasi techno pop pounding music, as if it will make the dull interesting, wears thin within minutes, and creates headaches thereafter.

I really do not like this series.",1241222400,24,266,4.866666666666666

8310613,5,B001IB2Z9Y,I teach freshman earth and physical science and the kids love these. They are current and up to date and don't bore the kiddos! I'm so glad I bought this,1389830400,,153,4.133333333333334
8310614,4,B001IB2Z9Y,Bought this for a gift but watched the set later. Great set. A good mini series on the universe and everything you would expect from one these from the History Channel.,1380240000,,168,4.451612903225806
8310615,5,B001IB2Z9Y,"This box set is simply brilliant. i finaly got it back off my brother who said it was a bit airy fairy. i was wondering what planet he was on. this stuff is fantastic.

Some of the scales like the size of galaxy's ect are mind boggling. Some of these objects are 200 million light years across without breaking a sweat. I wouldnt be surprised if they turned around one dy and said the universe is but a grain of sand on a beach or something way out there.

I have always been interested in what happens up there in the heavens but i wouldnt call myself a mathematicion, yet i can understand what these guys are talking about no problem. its really fun to watch these (usally on an exercise bike) for a few hours. Sometimes it will be totaly random, i trust whatever will come on.

I must say i will be upgrading to blu ray season 1-5 soon enough, i have yet to see all this on super high quality and cant wait.
i would recommend grabbing this series, prob in a bigger box set. Its amazing and great fun to watch.",1367193600,,1012,4.17948717948718
8310616,5,B001IB2Z9Y,"Behold something greater than yourself. This fascinating series is beautiful to behold and make you aware of how much you do not know and may never know. It also puts our life span in perspective. We are talking about a universe that is billions of years old and may still be expanding when humans are extinct.
This is a series that is definitely worth owning because one viewing is probably not enough.",1311465600,,403,4.611111111111111
8310617,5,B001IB2Z9Y,"I watched all the episodes so far, some more than once. I love how they explain it so that even if you've had no prior education in Astronomy, you will still be able to comprehend this. It's educational and entertaining. The visual are brilliant. All around A+

On a personal side note. I just took a college level CLEP test(a test that you can take in place of a class, if you pass you get full credit for the class). With no prior education other than this TV series. And I got high marks, 3 college credit hours towards my degree from sitting on my couch and watching this show. I recommend this for all ages.",1309910400,,612,4.275862068965517
8310618,5,B001IB2Z9Y,"I have yet to watch all the episodes; however, they were quite good and informative. I decided not to  buy season 3 & 4 though I have never seen them due to the fact they sound like Pop Science oddities....

Finally, I am skeptical how certain statements are made in the series as factual though I presume they are opinion... Worth keeping a critical mind about these things, but I suppose not necessary.",1292025600,,404,4.52054794520548
8310619,3,B001IB2Z9Y,"This is a very entertaining show about the origins of our universe, however, it is filled with inacuracies.  The episode I am watching now is about Saturn, and they are saying that your weight on Saturn would be roughly 2/3's of what it is on Earth, that is, if you could stand on the surface, which they maintain you can't.  This is untrue.  The rocky core of Saturn is several timess bigger than Earth which means that not only could you stand on it's surface (assuming you could withstand the atmosphere) but it's density is such that you would actually weigh more on Saturn - it's gravitational pull is actually far greater than Earth's.  Even more purplexing, they actually admit later on that Saturn does indeed have a rocky core that is larger than the Earth.  So not only are they giving misinformation, but they contradict themselves in the same paragraph.  They also continuously refer to the outer edge of Saturns atmosphere as it's surface.  I have never heard of anyone refering to Earth's stratosphere as it's surface.

I have seen the show several times, and every show that I have seen has had some obvious missinformation.  I do enjoy it for the marvalous visuals, including actual photographs as well as computer animation, but have been somewhat unimpressed with some of the astonomers and much of the naration.  To be fair, they get more right than wrong, but if they are mistaken on some of the very basic things, how much of what I don't know are they also getting wrong?  Which is why if I actually wanted to learn about the Universe, I would recomend a good book.  You may start with Hawkings Universe, or A Brief History of Time.  Or just about any modern astronomy text.

In summary, this is an entertaining show, but perhaps not the best source of factual information, so watch it and enjoy it, but if you really want to learn about the universe pick up a good companion book.",1289260800,11,1903,4.625
8310620,5,B001IB2Z9Y,The Universe is an excellent documentary that makes the universe easier to understand. It is basically a Geography class about the Universe. Fantastic photography and interesting scientific concepts.,1287964800,,199,6.142857142857143
8310621,5,B001IB2Z9Y,"This series fascinates me. I love to watch it but watching it in HD makes a big difference to me. I have been rethinking my strategy to get my HD library built of movies and TV shows/documentaries. I try to buy what I like when it is on sale/clearance.
But it is hard to beat Netflix HD quality ""Watch Me Now"" queue that streams HD (720P) to my HD TV. It is much better than watching at DVD quality. I guess this is an ad for Netflix because at $8.99, I can get these Universe episodes in HD from Netflix's Watch Me Now downloads. You watch as much as you like, as often as you like. And if you get bored with a series, then on to something else in your queue.
I rent these and at the end, I will not have something to hold in my hand but these internet options should get cheaper in the future. Having every movie I like in Blu ray does not make sense yet. The longer I wait, the cheaper blu ray gets. They will get cheaper until the next technology blows them away. then it is on to the next wave.",1285632000,,999,4.0
