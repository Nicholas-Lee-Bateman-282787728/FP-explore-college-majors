8027227,5,B0002EB5DA,"If you like odd foreign comedies from the back of your video store, look no further.

A Chicago gangland killer in the 1920s escapes to immediate post-revolutionary Soviet Russia and the Black Sea resort at Odessa. A hit-man is sent to find him. A case of mistaken identity confuses him with a distinguished foreign guest, making his job the more difficult. The enthusiasm for all things Soviet by the local apparatchiks makes for a great political comedy, and there are many subtle spoofs for those who look. Pay attention to names. The killer pursues his victim across the Odessa steps, while a film maker is at work; they bump a baby carriage that goes careening down the steps. The cinematographer wants to cut: the Director says, Naaah, leave it in.

A Russian film made on the cusp of the breakdown of the Soviet system, it's an excellent demonstration that humor transcends national boundaries.",1301702400,,901,4.882352941176471
