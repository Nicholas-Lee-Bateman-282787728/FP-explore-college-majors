home. Being a videographer myself I have traveled to many of the same places seen in this
dvd while on some of my own video shoots. I
highly recommend this video. The quality is very
good as well as the places chosen are some of
my very favorites. I could actually move to Point
Lobos and never leave. If you have never
been to Big Sur this video will make you want to
go. If you've been there before, this video will
surely make you want to go back over and over
again. You can feel safe purchasing this video. It
will be money very well spent. J. M.",1428969600,,598,4.033613445378151
8245988,3,B0012HENJE,"The scenery in this video definitely brought back some great memories from a trip I took.  However, there is no narration or commentary and the scenes are in suspense for 30 seconds or more each view.  Beautiful scenes...but dull.  If you're looking to take a nap or for bedtime sleep, pop this in and enjoy.",1283904000,,308,4.5636363636363635

for your pleasure in viewing.  Buy this if your going to the Big Sur.",1239926400,,141,3.8275862068965516
8245990,5,B0012HENJE,"Surreal Moments captures all the beauty of Big Sur in a way I never thought possible.  It really brings back all the good times I've had hiking around that area.  I highly recommend it if you want to relive all of your Big Sur memories, or if you want to see one of the most beautiful parts of the world without leaving your home.  Fantastic job!!",1208044800,4,347,4.2272727272727275
8245991,5,B0012HENJE,"This DVD is worth owning. Watching the breathtaking scenery reminds me of how fortunate I am to live in this area. When I watch this DVD it is almost like I am actually there. I get mesmerized by the spectacular beauty of God's wonderful creation. I get a real kick out of watching the critters on this DVD. If you purchase this DVD, I am confident that you will be pleased with it.",1203033600,2,382,4.2465753424657535
8245992,5,B0012HENJE,"I feel really fortunate to own this great piece of art. I am a local of monterey county and have ventured the georgeous Big Sur coastline many times but seldom captured any of its wonderous beauties in little more than memories. This DVD is a great way for me to calmly relax and revisit many of my favorite places, see wonderous new places, view some of nature's subtle tranquility that often gets overlooked, and witness some awesome things that I have never been fortunate enough to experience in my locale (like the double breaching of a pair of whales!). Whether you are looking for something soothing to relax to, beautiful background imagery for your home or business, or a memoir of the place your live or visited, you will find this DVD to be a treasured item in your collection!

If you haven't already, I highly recommend checking out this studio's other great work:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monterey-Surreel-Moments/dp/B00078TUJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monterey:  Surreel Moments</a>",1201478400,6,1043,5.553459119496855
8245993,5,B0012HENJE,"Wowie wow-wow! Nature's splendor.  Watch this DVD and only superlatives will come to your heart and mind to describe some of nature's best.  You're at the famed Big Sur coast - one of the most spectacular areas in the U.S., exploring & taking in all the marvelous sights.  You get views that you would see as if you were there, only better!  I used to go down to Big Sur from Monterey and there are some special scenes I was never lucky enough to witness myself, as creatures have their own time schedule.  This DVD is a culmination of many trips and hours spent capturing Big Sur shoreline and it's critters.  Something for everyone.  Fantastic and entertaining footage of irresistable sea otters, awesome whales, quiet harbor seals with the babes, fiery monarch butterflies,  tranquil flowers, stately redwoods, Pt. Sur Lighthouse.....too much to mention.  Experience many different visuals of the majestic coastline complete with pounding waves through rocks and waterfalls that meet the ocean as well as the green serenity of the coastal redwoods.  The much photographed Bixby Bridge, arial shots, sunrise and sunsets to knock your socks off!  The Big Sur area is world famous and you get to view a compilation of the very best of it.  This DVD will fill up your senses.  If you've been there, recapture the wistful memories.  If you haven't been there - you will yearn to go there.  Need to destress, relax and take in beauty? Wisely choose this DVD.  The quality of this DVD is unsurpassed in honoring that which is Big Sur.",1200441600,7,1530,4.804597701149425
