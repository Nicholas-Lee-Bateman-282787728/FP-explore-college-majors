8034998,5,6305837317,I love this DVD! It's so colorful and beautiful. The flowers and blossoms are just exquisite... and the detail is amazing. The music is uplifting and refreshing. I sometimes will program my DVD player to auto repeat (maybe the other reviewer might want to try that!) and it will play for hours on end. It's so nice to put on when I have friends over for dinners and visits... there's always a beautiful bouquet of flowers right on the monitor! Great DVD!,1154822400,2,454,4.548780487804878
