2385533,5,B000ADKTNU,"Every family that has a child who loves Winnie the Pooh should have this movie.  It is the true story of the little real-life bear that inspired the stories.  There is one war scene that might be too much for younger children, but I'd think kids from five year old and up, who watch it with their parents who can reassure them if they become frightened of the war, should be able to enjoy it.  There is no objectionable language or questionable behavior shown; it truly is a film that both the kids and their parents can really enjoy.",1154044800,23,534,4.373737373737374

The bear is a bit of an escape artists so when they decide to return it to the wild it then wants to be with people. (?)

The soldier smuggles the bear to England where he leaves it at the London Zoo. Briefly a dad and son ponder the bear's back story. Occasionally emotional. In extras a Making Of segment.",1509840000,,496,4.061224489795919

2385539,5,B000ADKTNU,"I found this story heartbreaking. Winnie was adopted by Canadian soldiers because a hunter orphaned her. I wish that there had been a way to rehabilitate her back into the wild right away instead of getting her used to dependence on human contact. The soldiers were brave and loving, and Winnie loved them right back, which is what makes the story so touching. Nonetheless soldiers and bear were all victims of a world that wages senseless, cruel war; a world that destroys the earth and its creatures for material gain instead of stewarding it. It's only humans that abuse animals, the earth and each other this way; and strangely science has found that they are the only creature that is not necessary to the health of an ecosystem.",1508889600,3,734,4.7421875
2385540,3,B000ADKTNU,"PROS:
- About how Winnie the Pooh came to be
- Good acting from all the players
- Winnie, both in cub and full grown form, is sooooo cute.

CONS:
- Way to much filler material; a lot of scenes have nothing to do with the focus of the story.
- Script could have been written a lot better; which in turn, there would have been better scenes to match in order to keep the movie a lot more fun to watch.

SUMMARY:
The scenes with and about the bear are way too few. Instead, for some strange reason, there are scenes that just don't make sense as to why the director/editor put them in. If edited without those scenes, the movie probably would have been only 45 minutes long.",1508716800,5,671,4.153846153846154

2385542,5,B000ADKTNU,"Winnie was good!!!  I was looking for something to watch and no one else was interested in this. It started a little slow and for a time I thought I was going to fall asleep. But I gave it five stars because as the movie progressed other family members started to watch it with me. Finding newer good movies, (I mean made since year 2K) that are not entirely for children, and that can hold an adult mind are so difficult to find -- think endangered species. I mostly watch Jane Austen movies and period pieces to quench my thirst for good stories that do not depend on gory violence or graphic sexual encounters. Sadly even some period pieces have gory violence and putrid sex that robs you of your dignity. This movie made me laugh, gasp, and tear up. When a story can grip me to the point I feel my emotions in a good way, it was worth watching to the end.",1508198400,5,859,4.237804878048781

I think this movie will stick with my daughter for her entire life.  She loved every minute of it, and thought the ""soldier was cute.""  It's a heartwarming tale, centered around WWI with none of the gore that involves war movies.  There's one scene that's battle related and you know what happens behind the screen of fog, but nothing gory.  I love the way the main character, played by Michael Fassbender, interacted with the bear.

2385573,5,B000ADKTNU,"Beautiful, very touching and tragic all the same movie. God, I watched it this evening with parents. I was so glad that lights weren't turned on, I cried and I almost cried out loud. I am a sensitive man, especially when it comes to a poor little bear creature that could have been shot and could have been dead so many times. A beautiful real-life story of a bear Winnie who was not exactly tamed, but she didn't know that she was a bear. This story is so touching and this humanized bear is not like any other bear I've seen. Those eyes she has are not of an animal, but of a human. That love she has for humans and humans that would rather shoot her to get rid of her. Heart-melting experience. True love between Winnie and her human ''owner'' left me speechless. A bear that melted hearts of others, she is like a kid who is so pure and loves everybody. It hurts to know that in reality several people were willing to shoot her. Yes, she changed people around her, but it still hurts to know that there is so much fear and hatred towards these or any other animals. This movie or a book can not have less than 5 stars. I can't understand how people on IMDB gave it 6. something stars out of 10. This movie depicts most of us (not me) the way we are, cruel, often heartless rapists of the nature and its inhabitants. What a wonderful creature. Is Winnie special? Yes. But it does not mean that other animals these days can not be like her. You must buy this movie and watch it, unless you don't care! If I had Winnie, I'd make a monument for her. She made a big impact on me this evening. I don't know what to say. Words mean nothing. I keep thinking of it and I just want to cry. Why can't we just treasure what we have?",1342569600,4,1724,4.149253731343284
2385574,5,B000ADKTNU,"I rarely cry at films, but ""A Bear Named Winnie"" made me cry -- not because it's sad, but because it's sweet. Michael Fassbinder is outstanding in this movie. Because of his performance you really got the bond he shared with the bear. All the animal ""performances"" were exceptional as well, even the wild dog's. This is the film ""War Horse"" aspired to be!",1341532800,,355,4.5625
2385575,5,B000ADKTNU,"This is the darling and true story of a bear cub whose mother gets shot in the woods.  The huntsman doesn't have the heart to shoot the little bear cub and eventually, a soldier in the Veterinary Corps adopts the little bear cub.  His whole troop becomes enamored of the little bear and adopt her as their mascot.  They name her ""Winnipeg"" after the fellow's hometown, but call her ""Winnie"" for short.  One of the top brass enjoys having a mascot, the other top brass holds great disdain for it.  Eventually, however, even the scornful fellow is won over when she pets him.  We are treated to several cute scenes where the soldiers, not knowing what else to do with her, try to set her free back in the wild.  But she always outwits them and comes back.  They end up over in England during World War I and not wanting to expose her to the front lines, they leave her at a zoo in London.  The arrangement initially only temporary.  Poor little Winnie is sad and refuses to eat, but eventually she is able to play with a little girl and both the zoo and the bear are happier as a result.  Her soldier ends up in a rest home for soldiers and his commanding officer seeing his depressed state arranges for Winnie to come visit him at the rest home.  The tears will flow, my Mother and I were both sobbing all throughout the film.  The soldier decides to let her stay at the zoo as the little kids love her and she loves them.  Eventually, the author of Winnie of the Pooh visit the zoo with his son and they start weaving a fancy tale about a bear named ""Winnie!""  For us Americans, some of the accents are hard to understand.  But the film is a definite five star and ten star and Oscar worthy show.  I think it is one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time.",1329177600,7,1765,4.2208955223880595
2385576,4,B000ADKTNU,I watched this video on TV and loved it. I have a friend named Winnie and decided to buy it for her as a gift. I knew that Amazon would most likely have it and they did. My friend loves it too.,1326499200,,193,3.619047619047619
2385577,5,B000ADKTNU,"This is a touching, wonderful story based on a real life adventure which involved a Canadian black bear named Winnipeg, later shortened to Winnie. This small orphan bear cub was adopted by a caring soldier, named Harry Colebourn, a veterinarian, on his way to World War I. Not wanting to abandon the bear cub, Harry manages to smuggle Winnie to England where he is able to get the cub cared for by the London Zoo.

The movie does a fabulous job of depicting Harry's loving care for the bear and the close relationship that quickly developed between this young orphan cub and the man. The story is beautifully portrayed and the acting is very effective and believable.

Winnie, having been raised by people developed a strong desire to associate with people and interact with them. She became a main attraction at the London Zoo and was greatly loved by both children and adults because of her friendly gentleness and playful attitude. During the time Winnie was a feature attraction at the zoo she actually would carry children around the zoo on her back. Winnie lived from 1914 until 1934 and during her life brought much joy and happiness to children.

One of the children she fascinated was a young boy named Christopher Robin Milne who named his teddy bear Winnie in honor of the famous black bear at the London Zoo. His father, A. A. Milne created the famous character, Winnie-the-Pooh, who even today continues to bring happiness to children and adults alike with his fictional adventures.

The world owes a debt of thanks to Lt. Harry Colebourn and his love for an orphaned black bear cub named Winnie.",1325376000,10,1609,4.756272401433692
2385578,5,B000ADKTNU,"The music used in the making of this film... outstanding. My favorite childhood hymn. As I watched the making of a beautiful friendship I was moved to laugh and moved to tears. It was one of the best family movies in years. My new favorite. So Christmas came in July, I am buying DVD's for my family and friends, so sure am I that they will delight in the antics and be moved by the sheer power of friendship between a Soldier and a bear.  Well Done.",1314230400,3,450,4.172413793103448
2385579,5,B000ADKTNU,"This is most certainly one of those movies that simply make everyone who sees it feel good.  It is one of those movies that can be enjoyed by the entire family, from the youngest to the oldest.  It is almost a must see for any one who is a fan of Winnie-The-Pooh as the story deals with the bear who was in the London Zoo and inspired A. A. Milne in his creation of the fictional Winnie.  (I know it is unreasonable of me, but I have never really trusted or been overly fond of people who are not Pooh fans).

The move starts during WWI while Canada is preparing to send the expeditionary to join other countries in Europe.  While in training the Regimental Veterinarian rescues a small black bear cub from certain death, brings her to camp and he and his men and friends take on the task of raising Winnie...a short version for Winnipeg.  Despite Army red tape and daring to beak a very long list of rules and regulations, the men of the Veterinarian Corps are able to smuggle their mascot to England.

This movie is loaded with a cast of very fine English actors which include, among others,  David Suchet, Stephen Frye, Michael Fassbender and Gil Bellows.  The acting here is quite good and each actor plays her part perfectly.  I must say that the bear(s) used in shooting this film were absolutely perfect in their assigned roles!

How Winnie ends up in the London Zoo is part of the story so as I am not into spoilers, you will simply have to watch this one for yourself.  It is a good tale though and you will enjoy the trip.

It should be noted that despite the fact that the fighting of the war is involved here, the makers of this movie have not used any scenes that would be inappropriate for children to watch. The adult viewer will be able to understand perfectly (especially if they are familiar with the fate of many Canadian soldiers who participated in this war), but there are no graphic scenes, I assure you.  There is no bad language in this move, no ungentlemanly behavior noted...it is just a good clean story, and as I said, excellent for the entire family.  Movies like this are getting more and more difficult to find it seems so when you find one, you need to grab it up quick.

It is also rather nice to learn a bit about the story behind the story of the creation of one of the most beloved of our children's literary icons.

The reunion between Winnie and the Canadian soldier who resued her from certian death as a cub was so moving.  It is amazing to see how the bear actors interacted with the human, especially the grown up Winnie played by Bonkers.

8077927,2,B000ADKTNU,"I found this difficult to watch. Spoiler Alert: A wild Canadian bear loses her mother to a hunter, is bought by a WWI soldier, becomes very attached to him and to humans in general, preventing her from ever living in the wild again, and so inevitably ends up incarcerated in a London zoo for the rest of her lif in a small dungeon-like cell, being fed the junk food of the era by enthralled kids. Apparently A.A. Milne was inspired by this Winnie to create the Winnie the Pooh series, but any resemblance between the real Winnie and the fictional one is in name only.

And of course, the three 'show biz' bears used for the film are exploited wild animals forced to 'act' and perform tricks, whose natural lives have been forever stolen from them.

Unfortunately there were no wildlife sanctuaries in that era, and as someone who is opposed to zoos, I was not at all comfortable watching Winnie in a barred cage on a hard floor covered with straw.

She was not tamed by the hunter, of course, but by a Canadian veterinarian who spirited her off to Britain when his regiment was headed for the front in World War I, and who then left her ""temporarily"" in a London zoo when he realized he could not take a bear to the front with him.
