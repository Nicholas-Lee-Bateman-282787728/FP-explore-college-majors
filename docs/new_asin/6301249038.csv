320830,4,6301249038,"Parents is a film I had known about for quite a while before I finally decided to check it out.  I was quite surprised by what I saw.  Bob Balaban's cold, minimalistic style was just the touch this film needed.  What could have been slapstick horror comedy (a la Dead-Alive or Evil Dead  2, both of which are great; that style just wouldn't work as well for this  film) instead becomes a superbly filmed satire of 1950s family culture.

I  never thought I could actually be afraid of Randy Quaid, but his  performance is truly blood-curdling.  (Strangely enough, due to the facial  expressions he makes throughout the movie, this is the first time I've ever  noticed a resemblance between him and his brother Dennis.)  He plays the  character with a understatement I didn't realize he was capable of.

I  understand why some critics came down on the climax and resolution of the  film, feeling it much too conventional in light of what had preceded it,  but I feel that there weren't too many more possibilities they could have  utilized.  The film works fine the way it is, and I recommend it to fans of  horror films and sharp-witted satire alike.",963014400,22,1149,4.65
320831,5,6301249038,"""Parents"" is a modern-day comedy about a 1950s family... the Laemlies (lem-lees). Young Micheal Laemlie lives a life of secrecy, pain and anxiety. Plauged by regular nightmares and, to some extent,  ""daymares"", Mike is a suffering child. He is moody, emotionless,  withdrawn, and a 'picky eater'... apparently emotionally disturbed. In  response to a drawing he is asked to create at school, Mike begins to see  the school pyschologist... but, well, she doesn't hang around for too  long.
This is a howingly funny gallow's-humor flick with a cannibalistic  twist that is sure to catch your attention and earn a special place in your  video collection. The music is idiotically happy, even in the midst of some  horribly gruesome scenes. The effect is... eerie, disturbing.

320835,3,6301249038,"46. PARENTS (comedy, 1988) Ever since their move to a new town 10-year old Michael has been feeling strange. Maybe its because his new house seems so big and spooky. Or maybe its because Dad (Dennis Quaid) and his Mom (Mary  Beth Hurt) practically force him to eat their favorite recipe they call  ""leftovers"" (a combination of meats and stuff). Whatever the case  he has grown very suspicions of anything and everyone. His growing  anxieties instill in him a wicked outlook towards life that gets him in  trouble at school. Sent to the school's counselor for help, she sets out to  investigate Michael's private home life.
Critique: Strange little film is  the blackest of comedies. The story is told from Michael's POV so  everything looks abstract and weird. Attention to detail of setting (50s  Americana), period pieces and customs is very rewarding. Bob Balaban's  craftily directed 'Pax Americana' scenes seem aesthetic and distant.  Similarities between David Lynch's own subversive 'Twin Peaks' society of  evil lurking underneath wholesome settings, seem to have had an influence  on Balaban (Lynch's own regular composer, Angelo Bandalamenti, provides the  music). The film also benefits from the stylistic brushes of  cinematographer-turned-director Barry Sonenfeld. The use of sweeping,  low-angle shots (illustrating this 'child's nightmare world) and use of  hand-held shots are wonderful. The cult overtones of the film make it not  for all tastes.

320896,3,6301249038,"Review-Here is an interesting question for the horror community. When you heard the news of Lionsgate releasing the old Vestron Video titles, how many of you thought they would be this diverse?  Parents seems like an odd title to release, but that is not to take away from how fun this film is. As a child, I had an overactive imagination and a love for horror films. Those things in my early days, kept me with one eye open when it came to my parents. When my dad would say he was going to take me to the boxing or wrestling matches, I was always worried that there was a plan to get me to go to church or some school event that I dodged. With my parents, there always a concern with me that they had some plan in action to get at me. I would have my night light on and the door locked with a board under the lock that nothing could get in my room. That feeling and emotion is what powers  Parents. It is a movie that showcases the fear kids have with what their parents do, when the lights go out. The film takes place in the 1950s and stars Bryan Madorsky as Michael. Michael is a little boy who has one life altering question to ask,  Where are all leftovers coming from? It seems at night his parents are fixing all this meat, but he is not sure where all this meat has been stored, or when it was bought.

It seems his parents seem to have this secret language when it comes to this mystery meat. As mom says the word,  Leftovers and the parents wink at each other and share a casual laugh. This film is never really sure what it wants to be. Is this a satire, a horror film or just an all out dark comedy? This questioning does hurt the film in the long run. It just feels there is no really payoff to the film. Randy Quaid and Mary Beth Hurt really turn in decent performances as the parents, but they seem so simple to the point that they feel cliched. When you dissect this film, it all seems fair. The cinematography looked fine. They capture the perfect look and feel for a film like this. The acting is fine. You have two actors, who sink their teeth into these roles as the parents, while winking at the camera all they can. The direction of this film is where I feel we can find the fault. This film needed an identity, a direction and most of all, execution. This film is a bunch of random ideas that serve as getting people moderately interested, while trying to figure out how to get them completely on board. If you were a fan of  Fido, I can see you getting into this film. This is not a bad film, it is just a middle of the road film that had the elements to be so much better.",1485302400,,2598,4.11439842209073

His dad has been delivering unique kinds of meat but who knows where it comes from as both of them cook together and the boy keeps getting odd dreams/nightmares lately as he finds out the truth of what's behind the meat.

Bizarre but amusing dark horror comedy that has been a cult fave since 1989 and one of the most underrated horror comedy mix films ever. This movie gives us a very David Lyncian-esque look at Suburban life in the late 50's with a nice score by Jonathan Elias and Angelo Balantomi (Blue Velvet and City of Lost Children) and very well acted. This movie maybe a bit disturbing and dark to some audiences but this movie is a required taste (lol on the ""taste"" part), this one relies on psychological themes than being a total gore-fest despite only a few moments of gore in it.

Don't spend an arm and a leg on this out of print version of PARENTS! Instead, there's a better and cheaper version of this uniquely dark humored and mildly disturbing gem!!!

Even though the DVD case erroneously states that the two films are presented in FULLSCREEN, the Red Carpet Double Feature release: ""FEAR""/""PARENTS"" (2006) actually sports gorgeous, anamorphic WIDESCREEN transfers of both films!!!! FEAR is an average film, but I've always loved the creepy, 1950s inspired PARENTS (I give it 5 Stars). The Red Carpet version starts (new!) at a measly $7.00 plus shipping for a total of ten bucks right here on AMAZON!

320998,5,6301249038,"This is a unique film. Not everyone is going to appreciate it, but there really are few films like it. It is one of those movies that fail with mainstream audiences when they first hit theaters only to finally gain some recognition many years later.

What I really liked about it was the ambiguity of the subject matter. Though it seems that the parents are indeed cannibals, because much of the film is from the point of view of a young boy with an over active imagination, that point is never entirely settled (at least in my mind). This aspect also explains the slightly hallucinatory feel of the picture.

And while the film truly captures what it is like to be suspicious of, and confused by, the adult world, really it works best as as an allegory for a young vegetarian who is repulsed by meat and can't understand why his parents insist on feeding it to him. This is particularly obvious when you pay attention to how vegetables are inserted into the film and the role (or lack thereof) that they play.

I eat meat, but I know people who grew up repulsed by meat. By associating animal meat with human, it puts you in the shoes of a child who feels that repulsion....and makes you take a second glance at the roast beef sandwich on your kitchen table.",1246320000,,1259,4.465217391304348
320999,1,6301249038,"The opening scenes of this ""dark comedy"" feature great 1950s cars, decor, costumes, and musical score! Perky housewife ""Mom"" is a kitchen whiz who serves up tasty looking left-overs every night. White shirt-and-tie ""Dad"" is ravenous after putting in long days at Toxico. (Clever company name!) Little Michael just wants to make friends at his new school - and eat something for dinner that's not ""mystery meat."" What a wholesome, 50s era set-up for a comedy about cannibals! I was having a fun time and even asking for ""seconds"" at the dinner table - until the little boy started having nightmares. Then I lost my appetite completely.

This is NOT a comedy and definitely not for the kiddies. The first fifteen minutes or so are fine, but watch out! When the film-makers start splashing blood around, ""Parents"" becomes a totally different kind of movie. That's too bad because it could have been a fine little comedy.

I have two questions for the screenwriter of this kitchen fiasco - what did the family eat in their old hometown, and why does their son aged 9 or 10 wait until now to refuse to eat ""meat""? My mother made the worst liver in town and we kids somehow choked it down. ""C'mon, Michael, how about taking just one bite of this delicious meat dish?

I think the father was bringing the body parts home to experiment on, not eat.  He was shown to be obsessed with his job, so this makes sense to me -- and would also explain why he doesn't want his son in the cellar, to find out his secret, that he's been illegally bringing corpses home to experiment upon.

Furthermore, when the school psychologist is killed, they don't show who did it.  I think the psychotic child did it, and didn't even realize it.

Finally, at the end of the film, the father knows that the son has seen the corpses in the basement, and THAT'S why he says ""So now you know our little secret.""  As for the meat, he never says, ""This is dead people.""  He just says, ""You'll learn to love it, just like your mother did,"" which is just a response to the boy refusing to eat his meat for a couple weeks in a row.  When he sets out to KILL the child, it's only because the child tried to kill him first and it pushed him over the top!

321001,2,6301249038,"Parents (Bob Balaban, 1989)

TV director Balaban makes his feature debut with this little comedy about which I can't quite figure out what to say. I know I was unimpressed with it; I simply can't figure out why.

The story concerns Michael (Bryan Madorsky, in his only screen role), a schoolboy who comes to believe that his parents Nick (Brokeback Mountain's Randy Quaid) and Lily (The Exorcism of Emily Rose's Mary Beth Hurt) are cannibals. This, obviously, messes with his head, which puts him on contact with school counselor Millie Dew (A Hatful of Rain's Sandy Dennis, in one of her final screen appearances). Is it all in his head, or are his parents really cannibals?

There is nothing terribly wrong with this film, per se; the acting is competent if nothing special, the script is predictable but decent, and at times amusing, the direction is solid without being notable, etc. It's average to the point of being innocuous-- which is a problem in a film about a kid who thinks his parents may be trying to feed him parts of other human beings.

And you know, for some reason, I just fgured out what's been nagging me this whole time. So how did it take this kid until he was ten, or thereabouts (I don't remember his age ever being specified), to start wondering what it is he's eating? And why does he stop? It makes no sense-- and as it's the basis of the movie, it undermines everything else. **",1153267200,,1408,4.575396825396825

It was as if his face had been injected with massive amounts of botox.  no expressions.  no emotion.
The storyline was predictible with little to offer in the way of ingenuity or thrill factor.  The scariest part of the movie might have been when the child turned around and ran into a foot hanging on a meat hook in the cellar.  Even then, his face (weighed down by the botox) registered nothing.  The father's death scene in the end lasted about 10 minutes of him flopping about trying to lay his hands on the child.

321043,4,6301249038,"""Parents"" is a really odd blend of your basic ""something's rotten in suburbia"" movie, a genuine horror flick, a lovingly created period piece, and...something else. Something even more disturbing than the movie's pretense.
The plot is fairly simple: poor Michael becomes convinced that his parents, who are paragons of suburbia, are cannibals. Are they? Really? The movie is told from Michael's point of view, and it sure looks like they are from here. The premise, and some of the touches, really have the feel of dark satire, and in fact I see ""Parents"" gets billed as a black comedy.
But look deeper in Michael's eyes, and it looks like something darker than comedy is going on here. It's not much of a stretch to interpret ""cannibalism"" as ""child abuse"" - look at how badly Michael is affected by his discoveries. The actual theme is broader, I think - essentially, the movie argues that the surface of suburbia can mask some really horrible things.

I feel I made a good synopsis on this film. That is the trick people will do, to get people to watch their films. Obviously I made the wrong choice on agreeing to rent this. This film was so boring. I can't believe anyone else liked it. I just can't believe I'm the only one who couldn't stand it.
The only good part is the ending. Throughout the movie I was thinking about how stupid I was for renting this. It was too weird and stupid to take seriously. I would assume only a younger child would like this because of how bizarre it is.
Do yourself a favor and rent this on a two-for-one night. I know that I'll never rent this movie again. Even if my life depends on it. It's too much torture sitting there for half an hour watching a movie like PARENTS. I'm just glad I know what it's like now, so I'll never have to worry about renting it again.

321049,5,6301249038,"""Parents"" is a modern-day comedy about a 1950s family... the Laemlies (lem-lees). Young Micheal Laemlie lives a life of secrecy, pain and anxiety. Plauged by regular nightmares and, to some extent, ""daymares"", Mike is a suffering child. He is moody, emotionless, withdrawn, and a 'picky eater'... apparently emotionally disturbed. In response to a drawing he is asked to create at school, Mike begins to see the school pyschologist... but, well, she doesn't hang around for too long.
This is a howingly funny gallow's-humor flick with a cannibalistic twist that is sure to catch your attention and earn a special place in your video collection. The music is idiotically happy, even in the midst of some horribly gruesome scenes. The effect is... eerie, disturbing.

7810390,5,6301249038,"Major Spoilers Below:

This film one could say is a sort of conflict between two competing ideas.  The initial idea is that the parents are cannibals and on its surface I completely agree with that theory.  It is what the director leads the viewer to think.  The other idea, dare I get into this, is the child, that strange, quiet, unusual little boy is a serial killer in the making and his parents, albeit secretive and disturbed at least on a mild level for the wife and up to a major level for the father, are both during the course of the story victims of a murder.

Let's recap:

1.  The story is from the boy's point of view.
2.  The boy has extremely violent and graphic nightmares nightly but he has no actual reason at that point to believe his parents are cannibals.  This means he couldn't have been psychologically scarred yet to justify those kinds of dreams (in theory).
3.  In school he speaks of cat mutilation.
4.  He shows signs of a Sociopath such as being apathetic (therapist said boy was rude), cruel (cat mutilation interest), emotionless (catching his parents making out should have agitated him somewhat especially if he really saw blood all over them as he remembers it), remorseless (assaulting his father with bat, spying on people, trashing house, stabbing his dad, mother dead, house blown up), murderer (trying to kill his father), serial killer in making (trying to kill his father and having no expression in face whether positive or negative as he's doing it; not even fear)
5.  The only time you see anything implicating parents beyond doubt in cannibalistic behavior is at the end when dad say's they should move to the woods near a highway for the accidents.  Since this is all from the boy's point of view, if boy is a lunatic how can we know this is what dad said?  Boy got it all wrong about the make-out scene.  He saw lipstick on their faces and remembers it all as blood.  I know their is an argument that maybe the boy blocked the make out blood image as he saw it and later remembered the truth but that's not how the brain works.  It would have to be the other way around where boy sees the blood all over parents then remembers it as just lipstick until soul searching therapy years later finally remembering it all as blood and not lipstick.
6.  The way the ending was set up as if the boy now suspects grandparents of cannibalism as well which suggests he'll kill them too.  Why not just turn these people in?  Why kill parents and now maybe grandparents?  Serial Killers justify their murders as well.

Conclusion:  Even if the boy was correct about all of it (he could be which would explain where he got the crazy genes to be what he is), his actions are way beyond the pale of normality and deep into the territory of Sociopath Serial Killer land.  I don't know if the parents were cannibals.  But what I do know is that kid is one messed up little tike.

7810396,5,6301249038,"Parents is a must see for horror buffs.  Comedy and horror are two genres that seldom work.  But Parents pushes that boundary and goes beyond the usual cliches one has seen over the years.
This could've been a straight up slasher film, cut and dry, studios makes a few bucks, next!  But that's hardly the case here.  The story takes place in the 1950's, as new neighbors (The Laemel Family) take up shop in the cookie cutter suburbia.
Their youngest son Michael (Brian Madorsky in his only starring role) suspects his well to do parents of having peculiar eating habits, and that his dinner may not come from the supermarket.  He is plagued by disturbing nightmares because of these worries.  It's too bad this was Brian's only role, the kid had the chops for it.

Randy Quaid and Mary Beth Hurt play the parents Nick and Lily to perfection.  Randy is chilling as the working class father who just wants to raise his son right and clashes with him often, trying to find a middle ground as the two have nothing in common and rarely get along.  His menacing presence never lets up and just when you think he will snap, he merely stays silent, which I think is extremely effective.
 Mary as the stay at home wife is perfect and frankly I think she outshines Quaid at some parts.  She plays her well to do housewife persona with chilling precision.
Sandy Dennis (In one of her last roles) plays the concerned and worn out social worker.  She effortlessly brings her quirkiness to the picture with such grace and I feel her role could've been more fleshed out (pardon the pun)
Even though the film is fairly short, it touches on some poignant things such as: loss of innocence, being an outsider, realizing your parents flaws, heavy stuff for horror.
Parents has this wonderful undercurrent of dread throughout.  I feel that newer horror films lack the atmosphere such as these older films do.  A few famous 50's songs also help set the mood and the dark nightmares that haunt Michael only make this suburban Gothic tale even more macabre.

I do want to point out that the film isn't a gore fest regardless of its R rating.  The content is certainly disturbing, but it never goes full on Dead Alive if you know what I mean.  There are a handful of nightmares Michael has, and its what you don't see that makes it more terrifying.
The film is directed by character actor Bob Balaban and I have to say I wish he did more like this.  Its rare to see a film that feels truly from the director and not the studio.  Siskle and Ebert predicted this would be a cult classic in the years ahead, and they were right.  I am so glad that Lionsgate stepped up to the plate to make their Vestron Video Line.  They have joined the ranks of Arrow, Scream Factory, Criterion, and the other titans as being the next label to give films the release they deserve.  The blu ray comes with a good 1080p transfer and great 2.0 DTS sound.  Special features include commentaries, a recent interview with Mary Beth Hurt, Isolated score track and a few behind the scenes selections.

Parents isn't an easy film to watch and its definitely an acquired taste (again sorry for the bad puns) but Vestron Blu ray comes through again to bring us a lost cult classic.",1485820800,5,3228,4.516351118760757
