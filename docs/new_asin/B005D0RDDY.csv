4656608,5,B005D0RDDY,"I was a fan of Three Sheets, and Drinking Made Easy did not disappoint.  If you like traveling, going out to new places, and having an alcoholic beverage or two, this is for you!",1358121600,,178,4.235294117647059
4656609,5,B005D0RDDY,I have followed this show for the last couple of years and love it. I not only learn a lot of places to go when I am in town but also how to make several drinks from all those places. It also is a drinking game so you can grab friends or in my case roomies and commence to drink with all the rules that they specify on the drinking made easy website. Zane Lamprey and Steve McHenna are total characters that you end up loving and following almost stalkingly looking for more seasons. I bought this for my sister and her new husband for her birthday. They already love it and have gotten more friends involved in watching it and going to the bars they see on the show in their town. A DEFINATE must see! Who knows you may become McHenna'ed after a few episodes.,1355875200,,760,4.1768707482993195

""Drinking Made Easy, Season One""
(HD Network, 2011)
-----------------------------------------------------
This road-trip/pub crawl foodie show features host Zane Lamprey and his sidekicks Steve McKenna and Marc Ryan, reprising their roles in the similarly-themed ""Three Sheets"" program. Basically, they drive to a city -- New York, Boston, Seattle, Austin, etc. -- and go boozing at a few of the hot local bars, breweries or distilleries.  They get bartenders or brewers to chat with them and share their wares, which inevitably get tossed back in a single shot or chugged in some sort of competition, and Lamprey gabs his way through the filming, invariably making their hosts (and the viewers) laugh. He's a very charming drunk.

The style of drinking - fast and furious - is very fraternity-pledge oriented, but Lamprey himself has a mild, winsome, likable personality and doesn't play up the oafishness that collegiate binge-drinkers are known for. Thus, the show has a lighthearted feel, and largely avoids the potential pitfalls of a ""Jackass""-style MTV lowest-common-denominator presentation. The voiceover narration helps keep things light - it reminds me a lot of Roger Lodge's glib narrations on ""Blind Date"" in the 1990s. (Does that sound like a guilty pleasure confession? Yeah, well, DME is, too...)

The show is fun and dumb but not as crude or crass as it could be - Steve McKenna has weekly eating competitions (eating ten-pound burritos, etc.) which are gross but not graphic; all in all the show is surprisingly tasteful. And if you want to learn about how various drinks are made -- beer, vodka, gin, wine, etc. -- and prepared (martinis, et.al.) there's some interesting info. On a local note: I was disappointed by the San Francisco show - they went to some interesting distilleries but the bars were pretty square.  They couldn't swing by Zeitgeist or the Stud? Too scared to hit a couple of gay bars?  Oh well - maybe next time.",1319414400,3,2005,5.253125
4656612,5,B005D0RDDY,"Drinking Made Easy isn't just a TV  show, it is also a drinking game. Within each episode, Zane and Steve introduce you to a game so that you can drink along while watching the show. The whole idea here is not to overdo it. If you lose, all you need to do is take a sip. So play along and enjoy your favorite beverage with your guest during the show. There are clever rules to the game; rule #1: if you are the first person to see Pleepleus (Pleepleus is a little monkey) hiding out somewhere around during the show, you can get someone to take a drink. Rule #2: if Zane or someone in his entourage makes a mistake in continuity--if you notice an inconsistency from one scene to the next and if you are the first one to spot this, then you can make someone drink. Rule #3: when there's a challenge, pick a side. If you lose, you have to take a drink. In addition, Zane and Steve will face off in the six, six-pack challenge. Whenever they have a challenge of sorts during the show, Marc will pick who he thinks will win the contest. If that person wins the bet, the winner gets six six-packs of beer.",1318204800,,1100,4.188679245283019
4656613,5,B005D0RDDY,"Drinking Made Easy is a great show for anyone who likes to drink and has a sense of humor.  Host Zane Lamprey and his sidekick Steve McKenna (along with correspondent Mark Ryan) drink their way across the United States imbibing on the local favorites in whatever town they are in.  The shows always include some sort of eating challenge and a six six-pack challenge where Mr. Lamprey & Mr. McKenna bet six six packs against each other in some sort of game like keg tossing, beer pong, darts, pool, kicking field goals at Cowboys stadium, bowling etc.  Mr. Lamprey has something of an iron stomach and didn't lose an eating challenge all season.  He ate some insane amounts of food like finishing off a six pound deep dish Chicago pizza.  The show is heavy on humor and Mr. McKenna is always the butt of the joke.  The show also shares the ingredients for most of the drinks made on the show.  The show is part travelogue, part alcohol history lesson and part stunt eating & drinking.  It all mixes up to a funny, kick ass show.",1317686400,,1027,4.483870967741935
4656614,4,B005D0RDDY,"Great show, it was shot and broadcast in HD.  Is it that cost prohibitive to release it on Blu-ray?
Oh well, Season 2 is coming to HDNet in a few months and we're hoping for a new season of Three Sheets also!",1313625600,5,208,3.9523809523809526

8466240,5,B005D0RDDY,"My boyfriend and I love watching this, usually on a Friday or Saturday night when we don't feel like going out but still want to drink. It's fun to learn about the different drinks, and hilarious to watch Zane trying to make drinks when he is sh**faced.",1393545600,,253,4.404255319148936
8466241,4,B005D0RDDY,"I'm an avid brew fan and the show does a good job of covering different styles of beer. DVR'd the show on Axis TV and watched most episodes. The premise follows the host and his buddy with a disgusting beard as they go around the US trying drinks and mixes. What's cool is that they show you recipes of drinks they try during their visits, I've yet to make any though since most of them include numerous ingredients that I don't have or want buy. Some episodes are more insightful than others, sometimes they make a drink, slam it and move on. If Zane comes back with a new show he should give a scale rating on each drink he tries. Though he does seem to like most cocktails/beers. One episode had him at a bar that made bacon infused vodka. It's easy to make at home too and good in bloody marys the owner said. Note, they do go to a few well known breweries, but often they hit a lot of dive bars with goth looking bartenders. But again, they cover all styles of bars and fancy restaurants across the US. A happy show to check out if your getting older and don't go out as much. It fills the void.",1383264000,,1100,4.169014084507042
