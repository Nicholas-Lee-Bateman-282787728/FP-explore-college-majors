3562257,4,B001F2U73W,"I got this b/c I really like Tenchi Muyo. It's not Tenchi Muyo, but I really enjoyed it. It focuses on a group of friends and the strengthening of their relationships with each other. I think it's geared more toward younger viewers, but it teaches a lot of important life lessons. It's a lot of fun and for the price you can't go wrong.",1348876800,3,336,4.265625
3562258,4,B001F2U73W,"My daughter loves Sasami and I don't wonder why. Sasami's character is kind of airheaded, but has a heart of gold. Season one was pretty light fare, a little bit of emotional problems were dealt with, but nothing that might upset any but the most sensitive young viewers. Season two gets a meatier story line, but I believe that it still falls well within ""PG"" guidelines. It aims to show how not all deception is obvious, but all still ends well, with the villians converted to the side of the good guys.",1337385600,2,505,4.5
3562259,5,B001F2U73W,"Sasami Magical Girls Club is the perfect complement if you like the Tenchi Muyo's series, but I recommed use the voice in japanese with subtitles, I love it, I can see at Washu, Sasami, and Mihoshi, I miss the rest of the gang but have the spirit of the Tenchi's series in the animation, don't read this go and buy it now!!!",1307318400,2,324,4.241935483870968
3562260,4,B001F2U73W,"To be fair to the series, I didn't watch all of this one. My daughter did, however, and she enjoyed it pretty much. We purchased both seasons at the same time, and she watched them all  religiously. I watched enough to make sure that things were kosher. There is no nudity or adult situations in this one. It's your basic magical girls anime. It's more about young girls finding friendship and learning to be witches. There's romance, and that's what my ten year old likes so I will say that it was a successful purchase.",1283904000,3,521,4.484210526315789
3562261,5,B001F2U73W,"I bought Sasami Season 1 & Season 2 for my daughter who is 12 and she enjoyed both Seasons.  She said it has a bit ot romance and funny drama that she finds entertaining.  She does not like the mushy romance or drama types they have to have comedy and keep them laughing in order to keep her interest, just like the other anime and manga's that she likes to watch and read.  So if your looking for a lighthearted anime for your tween or teen girl then this is a good series that they would probably enjoy especially since it also has magic.",1279152000,,540,4.173076923076923
3562262,4,B001F2U73W,"I am a big fan of anime, and my 4 year old daughter was completely mezmoried by Sasami and all her friends. She role-played, learned the words to the songs, etc. As a grown-up, I can say this is a children's show that is a pleasure to watch. Great animation, voice, music, even a good plot. There are some adult references, so if you are hard-core conservative, you are likely to be offended and rate this 1 or no stars. I agree that these few scenes really aren't appropriate for young kids, but I am not offended by a naughty word or a tight fitting costume, or some romance-hunting, and to be honest they went way over my daughter's head.",1274659200,2,641,4.35

8300695,3,B001F2U73W,"This story continues what was seen in season 1. They were cheap and used the same opening song with a few animation changes and accidently left in a spoiler. The ending animation has a huge spoiler in it. Yes, its still tenchi universe and the folks while they tried to make a kid friendly show, couldn't help themselves.",1430524800,,321,4.551724137931035

8300698,4,B001F2U73W,I was looking for a random anime to watch and was pretty entertained by this. It seems to be a type of anime that has a hard to find fan base and I am not a fan of this style but in the end it was well worth the price. I enjoyed it.,1403740800,,232,3.3962264150943398
8300699,5,B001F2U73W,This is a really good anime if you like to watch an anime about girls that have magic power and sasami has some fun moment.,1396396800,,123,3.96

8300701,3,B001F2U73W,"Pronunciation. Could we learn how to say Japanese names if we are going to do an anime voice over in English? Other than that, great little story for young anime viewers.",1371340800,,170,4.516129032258065
8300702,4,B001F2U73W,this series was fun to watch. it's not the best anime but it doesn't suck though. it's not what I'd expected but still fun to watch. I suggest watching the first part before seeing this part though.,1362009600,,198,4.378378378378378
