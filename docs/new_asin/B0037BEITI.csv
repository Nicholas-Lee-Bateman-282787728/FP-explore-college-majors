8390449,5,B0037BEITI,Movie caught my eye because of Joshua Burrow being in the Captain Morgan commercials. Thought It might be interesting to see him act. Have not watched it yet but will after Christmas.,1351209600,,183,4.75
8390450,5,B0037BEITI,"Robert Clohessy is one of the most talented actors of our time.  Seeing him first in Hill Street Blues back in the day, he does an impressive portrayal of Parker in this ""on the edge of your seat"" movie.  I love the scenes that look as though they were from the 40's, but then are tied into the present.  Elias Plagiones is an up-and-coming director, for sure, and I'm very interested in seeing what he does next.  What I love about indie film is it's not the same-old, same-old - which is almost always is with the studios. Give this a chance, I loved it!",1281225600,3,556,4.266666666666667
8390451,5,B0037BEITI,"THE CRIMSON MASK:  the Director has put together a great cast and crew!  He did a superb job on limited budget, and the Many film festival awards recognized that fact.  Order a copy to check it out.  I think this will be a launch platform for many more great products from Alias!!!",1278115200,,281,4.346153846153846
8390452,5,B0037BEITI,"My wife and I saw The Crimson Mask at the Louisville International Festival of Film and loved it.  A fresh take on the Noir film that gives the viewer hints of old and new style filmmaking. With twists and turns in the story that will keep you entertained and waiting to find out what happens in the end.  My wife and I both agree, The Crimson Mask is a good film by a great young filmmaker.",1268784000,5,391,4.131578947368421
8390453,5,B0037BEITI,"I was very lucky not only to see this film while interning at the Orlando Film Festival, but also had a chance to meet the Director Elias. Both are ingenious! The film was action packed yet not so much so as to loose the story line. The twists and turns kept the mind wondering what's next. The Crimson Mask is more than a great work of art, It's a movie that if you haven't had the chance to, YOU MUST SEE!",1267920000,7,407,4.037037037037037
