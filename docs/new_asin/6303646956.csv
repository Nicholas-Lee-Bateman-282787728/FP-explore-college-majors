7857177,5,6303646956,"I've been doing Michael Perrons routine for about 5 years.  his exercises along with Pilates are the only method that has ever worked for me with Great results.  i never feel as though the routines have become  stale and boring in fact i can't seem to reach a peak in these exercises where i still don't feel sort of challenged and like i stated in the beginning it's been 5 YEARS!
 I'd like to reach Micheal Perron and tell him this but i can't find him on line anywhere. It would be great if Mr Perron makes a part 2 of  this video but perform the exercises on the ""Bean"" or Swiss exercise ball to make it even more challenging!",1188345600,,630,4.216666666666667
7857178,5,6303646956,"This is a really great video.  I wasn't able to keep up with the instructor the first time I did it, but after just a few times, I am now able to keep up.  I will agree with the other reviewer that this may not be a video for someone who has a large gut because the exercises would be very difficult.  But with that said, if you want to lose the gut, building muscle aids in burning fat.
All in all, I think this video is well worth the money.  It really is a great abs and chest workout and it's easy to understand Michael's instructions.
Also, understand that with any exercise program, there is no quick, easy way to tone and build muscle.  It takes time and discipline, in both diet and exercise.  So don't give up, okay?",1058918400,4,725,4.142857142857143
7857179,4,6303646956,"All you need is a mat, and two dumbbells (min. 8 lbs each) to work this program. Michael is easy to follow and he demonstrates the proper form and technique through each movement. Once you make it through the advertisments at the beginning of the video (why do they have these?) the workout lasts about 30 minutes including warm up and cool down. It's a great workout for all fitness levels - you won't feel left out if you are a beginner, and the exercises are easily modified to accomodate the more advanced. Michael tells you everything you might need to know. I've seen many workout tapes for men, and this is one of the best.",1057795200,4,630,4.439655172413793
7857180,4,6303646956,For once a video that really targets the chest.  This video is really easy to follow and clearly focused on the abs and chest.  More intense than most women's video so you feel it more when you're done.  Short and sweet and the instructor is nice to look at.,1021766400,2,258,4.224489795918367
7857181,4,6303646956,"I recommend this video for anyone serious on developing their abs and chest.  Some of the exercises are difficult, but worth it.  The instructor is slightly robotic, but he appears to know his stuff.",925689600,6,199,4.823529411764706
