4934838,5,B00634MKMI,A lot of great Pokemon diamond and pearl episodes in this set. I enjoyed every one of them. Can't wait till I pick up the other two parts of this season.,1363305600,,153,3.967741935483871
4934839,5,B00634MKMI,"I can't wait to watch all of Sinnoh League Victors! Even though they don't make complete season box sets, you can buy these sets. However, these I find are not as of a reasonable price. Think about it, you are spending about $50  ($45 for the sets plus shipping and tax) for I think 34 episodes, when you can buy the previous bigger box sets (Battle Dimension, Galactic Battles) with around 52 episodes for the same price. I tried to wait until these sets went on a lower sale price, but still no change. Black and White sets 1 and 2 you can buy for cheaper and those sets are newer and have the same amount of episodes like these sets. So I think it's a rip off, but if you want to complete your collection, like me, go for it.

If you buy box sets 1, 2 and 3, then you will have all of Sinnoh League Victors. On here, Amazon lists them as ""Sets""  which is fine. Get all 3 sets and that's all of this season. If you are a Pokemon fan and enjoy the anime and want to complete some dvd box sets, buy these. So enjoy!

Also, if you have Pokemon Indigo League (3 box sets), Orange Islands (1 box set), Master Quest (2 box sets), Advanced (2 box sets), Battle Frontier (2 box sets), and Diamond and Pearl (3 box sets), Battle Dimension (3 box sets), Galactic Battles ( 4 box sets) then you must have a lot of shelf room because all together these box sets do take up a lot of space. Once when you buy these sets, you will save space because they are thinner (normal dvd size). Even Black and White seasons are the same as these sets.

**Important**- After watching the first volume. On disc 2 episode titled ""Pokmon Ranger: Heatran Rescue!"" it's stated as being number 11 (last title on disc 2) which is wrong, it's not in the right order. This should have been episode titled ""Keeping in Top Forme!"" which is on the next volume (disc 3, it will be the first episode labeled episode 12)."" So basically they switched the 2 episodes, IDK why, perhaps a mistake. Either way, don't freak out. You are not missing any episodes especially if you get all 3 volumes. I will keep an update if this happens again. Something like this also happened in the Galactic Battles box sets as well.",1358035200,2,2175,4.269417475728155
4934840,4,B00634MKMI,"My child loves this dvd set, even though it's not bluray nor the latest and greatest.  The 4 stories are entertaining to the point where she watches them over again.",1335744000,,165,4.5
4934841,4,B00634MKMI,"The final (and shortest) season of the Diamond/Pearl series begins with this first two-disc set consisting of eleven episodes. While the first episode is rather weak (Regaining the Home Advantage is yet another take on ""wild Pokemon wrecking a town""), it quickly picks up the pace with a two-parter Contest battle between Dawn and rival Ursula (also revealing how Dawn got the nickname ""Dee Dee""), the evolution of one of Ash's Pokemon, and Team Rocket's surprisingly successful theft of an entire power plant! There are a couple of weak episodes, to be sure, but overall this is an action packed collection of episodes that any fan of the series will enjoy.

The series continues to be presented in widescreen format, with no extras provides on the discs. Also of note is the change in the packaging; in previous seasons, the two discs sets were presented in a cardboard box, with each disc in its own separate case. With this season, both discs are stored inside the same case, which is a pleasant change for those who have space issues for their DVD collections. Sadly, there is no listing of the episodes provided, so I'll present them to you here:

1) Regaining the Home Advantage - A Metagross and a Magnezone are terrorizing a small town!
2) Short and to the Punch - Buizel trains to learn a new move.
3) A Marathon Rivalry - Ash and Pikachu participate in a race.
4) Yes In Dee Dee, It's Dawn - The origin of Dawn's hated nickname is revealed.
5) Playing the Performance Encore - Dawn and Ursula face off in another Contest Battle.
6) Fighting Ire with Fire - A battle with Barry leads to the evolution of one of Ash's Pokemon.
7) Piplup And Away - After being knocked out by Gible's Draco Meteor one time too many, Piplup runs away.
8) Flint Sparks The Fire - Ash reaches Sunyshore City, but the Gym Leader is not interested in battling anyone.
9) The Fleeing Tower of Sunyshore - Team Rocket steals Sunyshore Tower, which supplies power to the entire city!
10) Teaching the Student Teacher - Dawn spends a day teaching younger trainers the finer points of Pokemon Contests.
11) Pokemon Ranger - Heatran Rescue! - Ash helps Pokemon Ranger Ben track down a missing Heatran.",1331424000,2,2181,4.647668393782383
