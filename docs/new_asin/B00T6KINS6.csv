7001436,2,B00T6KINS6,Im very disappointed about this set. I thought they would made a better complete set like a yearbook or something like that. But just a box with the same individual seasons it's very disappointed. Not Blu Ray it's other thing that make me angry.... Hope they release another version soon.,1425081600,17,288,4.78
7001437,4,B00T6KINS6,"looks like it took hours for fox to choose this season 1 artwork for this set. I hope they add exclusive stuff to this set like a music cd from the final season or a disc of bonus features.
it only gets four stars because of the cheap box art",1425081600,5,242,3.86
7001438,1,B00T6KINS6,"FOUR seasons of the total six of this show were already released in Blu-ray..... and now the Complete Series package will only be available in DVD???

Probably this is a gimmick to make everybody who is (still) interested on this show to buy the DVD version....to later come up with the Blu-ray one!

So, for now, thanks, but no, thanks!",1423180800,28,337,4.6

7001460,4,B00T6KINS6,"The care the publisher took in capturing the series in DVDs was good.  I've not delved into the special features yet.  The series itself is, um, a bit uneven, particularly in the scriptwriting.  The actors did the best they could with the lines, that was obvious.  The musical arrangements were more consistent in their quality, and the voices of the performers, including the guests, were very good to outstanding.  I don't understand the snark from _Pitch Perfect_ in the RiffOff category ""Songs ruined by Glee"" -- there just weren't that many clinkers.

I recognize that people without a passion for popular music would be turned off by this series.  I get that.",1504310400,3,665,4.883928571428571
7001461,4,B00T6KINS6,"If you like Glee, there are always songs you will like. Bought it for my husband. It's Beatles. It's Michael Jackson. It's Bee Gees. Over and over and over again. But again, there may be songs you don't like. Just fast forward.",1503705600,,227,4.428571428571429

7001463,4,B00T6KINS6,"I wish they had in Blu-Ray, but it's still good.  I miss this series.  It's got great characters and great music.  It also has a lot of issues that teens and adults deal with.  There are definitely some episodes that are not my favorites, but the majority of them are worth watching over again and again.  My favorite characters are Blain and Mr. Schuester who both just sing amazing.  I also love some of the cameo appearances by some famous actors.  Overall a great show.",1502496000,2,473,4.4941176470588236

7001465,5,B00T6KINS6,"Amazing series! I've become a uber fan of Darrin Criss (Blaine).  Sings like an angel and has dance moves that i just can' t get enough of. I really loved the romance between Blaine and Kurt.  I'm glad they got their wedding, finally.  I loved the sectional/Regional/national comp , the dancing and singing were amazing.  I still think they should have won against Throat Explosion though, Blaine knocked it out of the park with  ""More Than A Feeling""!!!! Awesome!!! And it would have been such a great moment for them to win it for Finn. Oh well, the writers always have their own agenda for future storylines I guess.  This is a great series that can be enjoyed by anyone who loves great music and dancing.",1502236800,3,708,4.579365079365079

Sure, adolescents do not actually break into song and choreographed dance, but would not the world be a happier place if they did? This is good, musical theatre using contemporary music. The cast is ber talented: nothing is mediocre. I wish I had found Glee earlier. But the complete series without commercials is addictive!
If you watch it for plot, it is adolescent angst: the geeks vs the popular kids. And true to life, it has it's disappointments. Some dreams do not come true. But taken as a whole over six seasons, most characters find love, happiness and success.",1447977600,10,631,4.642857142857143

WOW!!! No, make that SUPER WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!

Fox and the Glee producers should be completely ashamed of themselves, and TOTALLY embarrassed to treat the MILLIONS of very loyal Glee fans in this terrible way!!!!!!!!!!!!

And sadly, this is all about the money, as they simply want to sell off old inventory. And if they are going to do that first, then that type of set should be MUCH cheaper. I am calling on all loyal Gleeks to not give in to this greed, and to NOT buy this set. Please wait for a NEW, proper Blu-ray set, that has special features, deleted scenes, cast interviews, etc., and one that will do justice to this great series!!!",1447113600,2,795,4.506944444444445

That being said, I am completely disappointed in the complete collection box set. It's just all the same season releases in a box. No extras or anything more that wasn't there before.  So if you already  have the majority of seasons on DVD you should just continue buying them individually.

7001594,3,B00T6KINS6,"My review comes from someone who A) did not own the individual season sets and B) Agrees after season 3 it went downhill

It's okay. The box is pretty, but it's just the six individual sets in one box. THERE ARE NO SPECIAL FEATURES EXCLUSIVE TO THIS SET.

It's actually appalling that in 2015 a major cultural landmark like Glee would have NO special booklet and NO deleted scenes or bloopers. This is easily the most ridiculous thing - fans have been clamoring for deleted scenes (of which there are known to be many) and bloopers. Not one set has ever included these and the hope was that the final series set would - nope.

Shame on you, Fox. The only other good thing is that I paid 59 dollars which is cheaper than if I'd bought the 6 seasons separately.",1431993600,47,759,4.368794326241135

I ordered this because I expected it to AT LEAST to have a uniform packaging for the complete show, not just the original packaging shoved into a larger box. All other box sets I own have at least done that much, which makes it something a little more special than duplicating what I already have since I have seasons 1-5 on dvd individually. I am also very disappointed that the Fox and Glee promoted season 6 dvd (individually and w/in the box set) was supposed to have bloopers included, but this set and the individual dvd do not contain any.

If you don't already have all the seasons, this is a nice set w/ everything together, but if you're looking for something special, this is not it. There's nothing new to this set including new packaging except for the outer box.",1431993600,47,845,4.416666666666667

And also, the information above says it will be in English, French and Spanish, it's that true? And if it is so, is it going to be American Spanish or European Spanish? (Glee in European Spanish is only available till the fifth season, which is at the moment being aired).

EDIT: Can someone who's bought it please look in the box if it can be played both region 1 and 2 (NTCS and PAL)? Because I've read here: http://www.azdvds.com/2898 that it supports both. And also, are all the seasons also in spanish (European or Latin) or at least subtitled?

7001600,3,B00T6KINS6,"(Temporary Review as of 04/10/15) As a long time fan of this series, I have a LOT to say about the waves this show has gone through, but for now, I'm holding off (until release date) to talk about this set. As of now, we have no information available about any bonus features on this (deleted scenes, outtakes, behind the scenes, jukebox, etc.). I'm a little worried that we'll simply get all of the discs from previous dvd releases just added to a bigger box in order to save money for FOX. My gut is pointing towards this as the price for this dropped so drastically overnight & that there is no plan for a blu-ray release (which, despite the fact that FOX is halting release to ALL of their programs, not just Glee), it feels like a slap to the face to have released 4 of the 6 on Blu-Ray and not the last 2 or the box set. It's unfair to get cheap on such a loyal fanbase (those who watched all the way through the questionable quality of Season 4 & 5 to get to a much improved Season 6) at the very end of such a journey; it's like you've left us out to dry.  I guess we will have to see what happens in the meantime. For now, 3 stars for the show and a good looking box, but don't disappoint me FOX; if all that we receive is the cheap option, I'm going to buy this from a third-party seller; after 6 years of loyalty, we deserve better.",1428624000,23,1343,4.087121212121212

I have been with the show since season 1 I have bought every CD, DVD, and everything else associated with it 3x over JUST to support the show. I hate to see it go!!!! It literally changed my life. I was on the verge ofsuicide and when I started watching this I had something to look forward to every week. I was closeted just like Kurt and Kurt ( Chris Colfer) changed my life I had a lot to overcome. I can now be myself without caring about anyone's opinion. ALL the actors and actresses are VERY VERY VERY talented. I look forward to seeing where they all go.

7001602,5,B00T6KINS6,"To be honest, I am also raging that there will not be a blu-ray release for this but we should be reviewing the show. Glee. What can I say, it's been an amazing ride! Back when Glee started I did not hop on the bandwagon. In fact, I myself was a little critical of the concept of the show. After a constant battle with myself I finally gave in and watched an episode. Followed by another and another etc. By the time season two was airing I was a fully fledged gleek and I have never looked back since. I was at the Glee Live Concert and it was one of the best experiences of my life. The characters, the music, the warmth, the storylines, the humour - everything about this show was loveable. Rachel Berry (played by the insanely talented Lea Michele) heads a group of misfits who become a performing sensation. For me, Rachel and Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) always steal the show and are my favourite characters. The first three seasons are golden television and if I'm being brutally honest, thats the way I like to remember Glee. The fourth season was a little dire with the split between locations and the unlikeable new characters. The fifth season rectified a lot of mistakes and by the end of the season it was producing brilliant episodes again. I really enjoyed the final season and the season finale was everything I had hoped for!

I am so sad to see Glee go, true it never quite recovered after season 3 and then the loss of Cory Monteith, but Glee provided light for me in a few dark situations and I genuinely believe it taught me some valuable lessons. I cannot wait to purchase this and relive the series over and over.
Easily the most talented, hard-working cast. Easily my favourite TV Show of all time. Farewell Glee, thank you for a lifetime of memories!",1427241600,13,1774,4.458461538461538
