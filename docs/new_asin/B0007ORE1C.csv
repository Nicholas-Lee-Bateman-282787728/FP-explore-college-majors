8049653,4,B0007ORE1C," and too many attempts to find parallels in Callass life and art with that of the character of Tosca. But nonetheless this is a valuable historical document. I defer to others whether this is the best Callas documentary out there. Certainly we have a bevy of reminiscences from some of the expected sources: Franco Zeffirrelli, Tito Gobbi, Grace Bumbry, Placido Domingo, et al. Also a nice representation of still photographs. But the true value of this DVD is the peek into the Callas Tosca performances at Covent Garden in 1964 and 1965, and in particular excerpts from the famous Zeffirelli production, alas the only complete opera we have of her on film. As for me, I would have wished for other aspects of her life and art better covered: her early performances in Mexico City; her singing of Wagner roles; performances and recordings of roles other than Tosca, like Carmen; the film Medea, with Callas in the title role; and most of all, her tempestuous relationship with Met general manager Rudolf Bing.",1448582400,,1010,4.872093023255814

8049655,5,B0007ORE1C,Callas is legendary...this recording lets us in on that legend.  One of the better flights into the history of this great lyric soprano.,1392336000,2,136,4.913043478260869
8049656,5,B0007ORE1C,"Maria Callas appeared for the very last time on the operatic stage at Covent Garden in the role of Tosca.  Though a huge success, it also marked the beginning of the end for this celebrated soprano, who would never get over the loss of Aristotle Onassis, fellow Greek and shipping magnate, when he married Jackie Kennedy, and every magazine or newspaper in the world covered the ongoing frenzy along with television news.

Grace Bumry, John Copley, Dame Judi Dench who speaks pointedly about the great acting skill of Callas, Plcido Domingo, Nicholas Gage, Tito Gobbi, Antonio Pappano, Alan Stevewright, David Webster and Franco Zeffirelli took part in this film, being interviewed and sharing insights into the legend that was Callas the diva, the artist, and the woman who took grand opera to grand proportions even in her personal life.  In some ways, the life of Callas could be considered as grand a tragedy as some of opera story lines, and yet as there was also grand vision of what it was to create and bring characters to life with the perfectionism and musicianship of Callas.  Her withdrawal from the public, in her last years, though understood to be a means of coping with her waning vocal strengths.  The turmoil of finding herself abandoned by Aristotle, for whom withdrew from performing on stage and had intended to forsake performing, never allowed her to emotionally recover from the betrayal.

The story line of Tosca, the jealous and dramatic character in Verdi's opera of that name, is utilized to give an overview of her life and performances, asking whether or not when Tosca (Callas) stabs Scarpia, could it have become a linked to feelings Callas may have harbored in regards to stabbing her unfaithful lover.

I find that his film, along with CALLAS a documentary plus bonus, are the two DVD's which capture the legend that was Callas the best, since there are no full length video performances of her in her glory as the stage phenomenon she is attributed to have been.  She was part of the era which is considered to be the Golden Age of Opera, and as such needs to be a part of a serious opera collectors video library.",1365379200,,2149,4.773584905660377
8049657,5,B0007ORE1C,"I am a big Callas fan! I have found that no matter how many books or cd's about her I have, there is something new in everyone of them. You never knew what would happen in her life. Her voice and her acting, in her prime, were the standard. Its too bad she isn't around for modern recording techniques. Luckily,we do have one of her great roles on film, her Tosca is the best. There will never be another Tosca like her. I appreciate the fact that Amazon has so many cd's and books about her. Buy some, you'll love her too.",1350000000,,523,4.137254901960785
8049658,2,B0007ORE1C,"This ""documentary"" merely rehashes a lot of the old clichs that have only clouded the artist that Callas was. It goes to all sorts of lengths to squeeze Callas' life story into the story of Tosca, a role which Callas despised, even thoug she was famous for that role. The only redeeming features of this DVD are several of the comments by Bumbry, Domingo, and a few others who actually speak of Callas the musican and artist. More than anything, however, this film does the same disservice to Callas that ""Master Class"" did: it drowns Callas the musician and artist in the drama of her personal life.",1273104000,3,600,4.616822429906542
8049659,5,B0007ORE1C,"To those who think that this is a single-track documentary on Maria Callas' career, you are right.  The DVD focuses not on Callas the woman, or Callas the singer of the 50's, but the Callas who returned to the theatre after a brief liaison with that snide Greek snake, Onassis.  The events in the film are reported factually, and there is much involvement from people in and out of the opera business.  Great singers like Grace Bumbry and Placido Domingo were here to give the public their thoughts on Callas the artist, the musician, the great singer (she really was), and as a professional too.  The director Franco Zeffirelli, who was a good friend of Maria, was also there to recount detail by detail the great amount of passion that Maria dedicated to this extremely complex role, and actresses like Judi Dench comment on Maria Callas' ability to act superbly.  Dame Judi Dench herself is a great actress, and undoubtedly she only comments on the best if they truly live up to their name.  She also said that she sang like an angel, and what is more is she did attend the performances Maria gave to London as Tosca.

Although very little survives of the video performances that Callas gives on stage, what little we have is enough to prove what a dramatic force she was to reckon with.  After watching snippets of Act 2 of Puccini's masterpiece in fuzzy black and white, I was no longer thinking of Maria on stage.  Instead, I was seeing Floria Tosca.  Every gesture Maria performs is simply astonishing.  Her Vissi d'arte is sung almost like a prayer, and the murder scene that follows the aria is bloodcurdling.  Hearing Tosca say ""Muori!!!  Muori!!!  MUORI!!!"" with Callas' voice is nothing short of being raptured to dramatic and musical heaven.  Just watch her and Gobbi interact, and you will know why the Callas legend survives even up to this day.  It will never end.  Callas is immortal.",1117324800,46,1901,4.694864048338369
8049660,5,B0007ORE1C,"The legend of Maria Callas seem to have taken on a life of its own  with a continuing flood of books and articles,  even a successful Terrence McNally play, 'Master Class,' and now this recent (2003) documentary from BBC-TV directed by Steve Cole. The subtitle of the  documentary, 'Living and Dying for Art and Love,' is taken from 'Tosca,' of course, and in a very clever conceit, Cole structures this film delineating the cross-currents of art and love in Callas's life after the plot of 'Tosca.' The similarities, of course, are eerie and its no surprise that Floria Tosca was one of Callas's most potent and famous roles; indeed the last she ever sang. Using vintage footage both of her performances and of newsreel and TV news footage we get many glimpses of the diva in the last few years of her life, and as background there are generous dollops of recorded performances. Adding to this are extensive interviews with people who knew and admired her, including Grace Bumbry, John Copley, Dame Judi Dench (who called her, not surprisingly, a 'great actress'), Plcido Domingo, her biographer Nicholas Gage, Tito Gobbi, conductor Antonio Pappano, producer and impresario Alan Sievewright (one of her close friends), Sir David Webster and, best of all, Franco Zeffirelli.

Much is said (and shown) of the 1964 Zeffirelli/Covent Garden production of 'Tosca' mounted for her. Indeed, there are three 'bonus' tracks--one of Gobbi singing 'Tre sbirri ... Una carozza,' followed by 'Vissi d'arte,' and Scarpia's murder beginning with 'E qual via scegliete?'. (There are also some snippets of Callas singing 'Norma', but they are few; most of the focus remains on 'Tosca.')

Without giving away too much, it is fair to say that the notion  that Callas was devastated by the loss of Aristotle Onassis to Jackie Kennedy and that it led to her death is cogently argued. It is hard to escape the impact of the tragedy on her final years. The editing of the footage of Callas, the musical background, the voice-over narration and the interspersed excerpts from the interviews are expertly, even artfully  done. This 60 minute documentary has a dramatic arc not unlike that of a gripping verismo opera plot and one keeps thinking what a wonderful opera could be made from Callas's life; has that ever been attempted or even contemplated? I wonder.

The added footage from the three opera scenes brings the total timing of the DVD to 71 minutes. Sound in DD 5.1, DTS 5.1, LPCM stereo. The film is in English, with subtitles in German, French, Italian.
