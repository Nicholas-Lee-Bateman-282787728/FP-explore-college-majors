8349044,5,B0021IEQBI,"I recently started using Sony Vegas Pro9 and wanted to burn DVD's. Since DVD Architect Pro 5 came with it, I figured I'd give it a shot. Most DVD creation for me was simply making data disks for backup. The last actual DVD with menu system I made was years ago and used the antiquated DVDit Pro. While that was a capable system, it didn't have anywhere near the capabilities that DVD Architect has. But... I really didn't know where to start. After checking online, I found the ""DVD Authoring with DVD Architect 5 - A Complete Guide to Sony's DVD Authoring Software."" I decided to invest in it and I could not be happier that I did. It answered all of my questions AND showed me many items that I didn't know the software could even do. The teacher, Gary Kleiner, is easy to listen to and explains everything fully enough so that even I can understand it. The package comes with four DVD's that are packed full of useful information. I HIGHLY recommend this course if you are interested in using DVD Architect Pro5 to its fullest extent. When they come out with a version 6 or 7 of the software, I'll be looking forward to see if this course is updated before I buy ANY other courseware.",1305590400,,1187,4.4
