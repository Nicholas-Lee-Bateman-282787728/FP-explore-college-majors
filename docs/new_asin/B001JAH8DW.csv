8312207,3,B001JAH8DW,"The video presentations for this series is probably fine for folks who have no visual impairments. I watched - well, tried to watch, but got a lot more out of the one I saw at a writer colleague's home by closing my eyes and listening to the DVD. So why not do MP3s as an option so I don't have to pay for all the DVD overhead because I had to turn it off anyway? I wonder if Sherri knows that 285 million people worldwide are estimated to be visually impaired. I actually get vertigo and a nasty nystagmus as I watched the video and it made me nauseous. Psychedelic images can also induce loss of balance and epileptic seizures. I can't figure out WHY the busy background images, that are probably OK in POP concert, were chosen in the first place for a teaching tool.
And the disembodied head whose eyes wonder all over the place - whose idea was that? Sherri, really!
Great content - really great - but very disturbing presentation. A bit like shooting yourself in the foot when you don't have to.
Is there any reason why this workbook is not available for my Kindle Voyage?",1424563200,,1077,4.36318407960199
8312208,5,B001JAH8DW,"I never have writers' block. Now, I know that is not completely true. I have story concepts and scenes but I didn't always know where I wanted to take them. The author asked a question that was only part of a lesson  on the two part DVD: What kinds of things interested me? At first, it was like the same old quick list; then it just came to me over the next few days: lost cities and treasure; conspiracy theories; It seems simple enough question, survival off the land; time travel and machines. Wierd. Later this list was to come invaluable. Everything in this whole series the DVD's with the workbook is like a layering, silt at the bottom of a lake. Like I said before, at first the screen shots of the teacher,  were a little disconcerting, because she wasn't behind a podium but inside the frame. The teacher will often say ""screen play"" I just substitute ""novel"" and ""story"". she does refer to novel writers at times. This process makes your the whole story telling process clean and juicy! If you can get the whole class with the workbook. It took me a bit. But well worth it!",1412899200,,1085,4.42
8312209,5,B001JAH8DW,"For the serious writer who is ready to start taking their plots to the next level; Sheridan's text is an amazing way to brainstorm your ideas and lay them them out in a cohesive way. Sheridan's guide is a step by step fully integrated program for building scripts which will grab your reader and engage your viewer on every page.

This guide is different because it works backwards, by examining the structure of existing classic and popular scripts to really engage with what makes a Great script work. Sheridan breaks down the elements of pacing, timing, plot flow, character development and suspense, until they are deciperable and understandable. Her instructions are almost like creating engineering templates for each genres. Follow the template and fit in your unique characters, plot twists, descriptions and screen shots, and VOILA, you just wrote a script in 2 weeks!

Or at least, I did.
I'm not bragging, but really I did. Using WRITING A GREAT SCRIPT FAST I took a messy pile of chopped up art school musings, and transformed them into a slick and understandable comic read that I would not be embarrassed to give to my college professor, my snobby uncle, or that guy who knows that one agent. Really, it's not that I had to sell short my creativity-- it's that I had see what made successful films and plays watchable -- across the board-- and then allow my story to DO THAT. That's all, and now I can submit.

Thanks you guys for making it real and readable!",1276992000,2,1473,4.723735408560311
