This is set in San Francisco. A man and wife sign an agreement to investigate their past before they can adopt a child. The husband is a traveling salesman for his business. Mr. Harry Graham seemed uneasy in the interview, Eve Graham appeared at ease. Their apartment is inspected by Mr. Jordan. Harry spends a lot of time in Los Angeles. Can he provide references from people there? Harry keeps clothes there so he can travel light. Jordan investigates Harrys background. Harry doesnt stay at hotels in Los Angeles, maybe its a rooming house? Jordan visits Los Angeles on business and visits Harrys address. He hears a babys cry! Harrys wife is asleep in another room. Harry leads a double life. I cant believe it! How did it happen? Harry tells his story.

Eve couldn't have children, she went to work in his office and worked out well (improved sales). Harry went on a tour of Beverly Hills to see the homes of movie stars. He talks to a woman in across the aisle. [Note the outdoor water fountain - out of order.] They go to dinner, she works at a restaurant. She is from Pennsylvania and is lonely. Harry calls Eve, she tells him about new business. We see a dinner at their home where Eve makes a sale. Then we hear their talk. Back in Los Angeles sees Phyllis at that Chinese restaurant. They meet again on Harrys birthday. Phyllis tells about her ex-husband; he met a frulein in Germany. Back in Frisco Eve leaves to visit her sick father back east; afterwards they will adopt a child. Harry visits Phyllis Martins rooming house, she is ill. Her doctor talks to Harry. Eve calls Harry, she will have to stay longer.

Should Harry divorce Eve and marry Phyllis? Phyllis needed him, so they marry. Eve returned, she has an heirloom watch for Harry. Next she will adopt a child; Harry agrees. Harrys son is born prematurely. Eve surprises him in LA! Phyllis hears about this and is quite upset. He offers her a divorce but she rejects this. I pity you says Mr. Jordan. I wish you luck. Back home Harry asks Eve for forgiveness, and leaves. Two men in suits take him away. A telephone call gives her the news. There is a hearing in court. His lawyer notes that if he didn't marry the mother of his child he would not have broken the law! The judge comments on this case and suggests a solution. Which woman would want him after he is released?

This is an average story about a crime that is rarely talked about. Was it meant as an exploitation to attract an audience for a subject that couldn't be shown on television then? There was another movie made around the same time called The Captains Paradise about an English sea captain who had and English wife in one port and a French wife in another port. The first was very domestic, the other very romantic. The only constant in this world is change. The first wife became more romantic and the second wife more domestic! A flaw in his plans? This was a very funny comedy that mocked stereotypes and the conventions of life. [There was no mention of the economics of supporting two households.]",1446854400,,3074,4.51346499102334
