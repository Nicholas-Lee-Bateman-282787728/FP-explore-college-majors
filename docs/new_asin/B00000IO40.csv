7911057,5,B00000IO40,I have a special girl who is now 33. She sits and watches these and signs and laughs whit them. Great stuff for the little guys. She is about 3 to 4 mentally. She has even learned some things from them. Grand kids love them also.,1236124800,,229,4.0
7911058,5,B00000IO40,"Like most Blue's videos, there are consistent themes/lessons to learn...For a lot of children learning videos, at times, the lesson is hard pressed.  Hence a child will get tired of it and the video will gather dust on the shelf. ""Treasure Hunt"" is my son's favorite because there are a sense of adventure and discovery which is hard to find in any learning video.  My son has been watching this video consistently everyday(by his request) from the time he was 1.5 yrs old to the present(2.5 yrs old).  A must buy video if your child is Blue's Clues fan.",1043193600,2,554,4.575757575757576
7911059,5,B00000IO40,"My daughter has been watching Blues Clues from the age of 6 months.  Today she is 17 months and adores the one and only STEVE!  She is mezmerized by  the songs and surprise guest in this one episode.  She smiles  uncontrollably when Steve and Blue ""skidoo"" into the Land of  Discovery.  This video takes the best of the Blues Clues theme and goes a  bit further, trying out new things.  It is definately worth a look.  My  daughter's first word was ""Stee!""...We all know what she was  saying!",964915200,6,492,4.465909090909091
7911060,4,B00000IO40,My son is only 9 months old and he is already addicted to Blue and Steve. Thanks Blue's Clue's!,961891200,,95,4.052631578947368
