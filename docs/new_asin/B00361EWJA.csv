4071801,2,B00361EWJA,This is the worst quality DVD I ever purchased.  The resolution was so bad it hurt my eyes.  Such a shame too because the live staged production is a treasure that does not deserve this treatment.,1454716800,,196,4.416666666666667
4071802,5,B00361EWJA,"Finally, a reasonably priced, color version of Mary Martin's Peter Pan with Cyril Richard!  This is a wonderful rendition of classic Peter Pan, 50's style--there will never be a better one in my opinion.  Although I read in the customer reviews about it being blurry on big screen TVs, I ordered it anyway and found the picture relatively clear on my TV (52"") and was not disappointed.  I would recommend this product for purchase.",1453420800,5,431,4.797297297297297

4071805,2,B00361EWJA,"I bought this for Christmas for my 3 year old daughter. I grew up watching the 1960 Mary Martin version on VHS and was happy to find it. It has ""Starring Mary Martin"" on the cover, but, when opening the package, it reads, starring JM Barrie (the author of Peter Pan who died in the 1930s?)

I am hoping this is an oversight that will be corrected and an appropriate DVD label will be sent on a replacement as I intended this to be a keepsake item for my child.",1451001600,3,460,4.111111111111111

4071816,5,B00361EWJA,"This is very odd.
I loved watching this on TV when I was young. Of course, since we had a B&W TV, I watched in B&W.
I loved watching it on VHS, in color. It was a bit soft on VHS, but I put that down to being recorded on tape rather than filmed.
TV shows that were /filmed/ can produce as sharp a VHS or DVD as anything else on film, but those that were taped can not.
The DVD is also a bit soft as a result.
But it was only when it came out on DVD that I realized the Awful Truth:
there were two of them, one from the mid-50s in B&W
and this one, in color.
I bought this one since it matched the VHS tape, but as to which I actually saw on TV ... who can say?
Possibly both. They appear to have differed mainly in who played the children (the adults, presumably, were the originals from the first run of the musical play).
Note: the disc lists ""starring J. M. Barrie"" but, not to worry, the movie is exactly what it claims to be: the Mary Martin Peter Pan.
Technical note: This is a DVD-R. It has the movie only (well, OK, there is a Main Menu with a ""Play"" button). Videophiles who want more will be very disappointed.
Now, if someone would just put out the version of /Once Upon a Mattress/ where Carol Burnett plays the /Princess/ (rather than the Queen), I would be /very/ happy. (Preferably the second one, where the secret lovers are /not/ married rather than the first, where they are, due to the Traditional Family Values of the 50s and the censors who enforced them.)",1515974400,,1477,4.114186851211072
4071817,5,B00361EWJA,Just as magical as I remember. I watched this over 100 times as a child. The VHS got burnt out. Its older so don't expect HD.  If you have a child who can use their imagination introduce them to theatre and to this program.,1514937600,,223,4.068181818181818
4071818,2,B00361EWJA,"The quality is horrible. You can barely see the characters, it is so blurry. It actually looks bettwr on VHS. I was so sad, I knew it would not be crystal clear, but it was unwatchable.",1514332800,,185,4.166666666666667
4071819,4,B00361EWJA,"Nobody who loves this immortal classic of American musical theater needs to hear from ME or anyone else that this is a magical performance. What seems to be at issue is the quality of the picture and whether or not it is in color. Be assured, first, that THIS version IS the 1960 color broadcast (unlike the puzzling Blu-ray in B&W). Yes, of course, the picture is blurred--it IS a TV program from 1960, so deal with it--there is no other choice at present. I noticed some slight improvement in sharpness when I switched from an upgrading DVD player to an upgrading Blu-ray player, however, after a few minutes, I ceased to care about the picture quality and just let my heart strings be tugged by the haunting score and superb actors. Besides Mary Martin's unforgettable performance in the title role, there is the equally definitive Hook of Cyril Ritchard (a touchstone portrayal, especially if all one has previously seen is Christopher Walken's flat walkthrough that was televised a few years ago--it looked like he couldn't wait to get it over with and collect his check).

True, it's a pity no restoration work has been done, and that's the reason for my four stars. However, for now, if one wants to see this beloved classic, THIS is the one to get.",1513900800,10,1256,4.683257918552036

About a year ago I THOUGHT I was finally going to have it, but it was a black and white version and NOT the version I grew up with. THIS ONE is definitely the version I grew up watching and time has been utterly powerless to extinguish the love I have for this movie or the charm and epicness of this amazing film. I saw some comments complaining that the visual quality of this DVD is very blurry, but one has to consider that this version of Peter Pan was filmed in 1960, and the technology they used then wasn't as sophisticated as it is now. I could still see everything fine and the dialogue is in sync and this version IS in color....not that black and white nonsense. I would highly recommend it.",1507161600,8,828,4.246835443037975

It was transmitted to the place which manufactures the dvds in a substantially lossy format.",1493337600,4,386,4.450704225352113
4071839,5,B00361EWJA,"When Captain Hook Intends to poison Peter, but poisons Tinkerbell,  Peter asks children ""Do you believe in fairies? This is faith in humanity. Though the years that faith has been tested, through ""Peter Pan Live!"" (which I reviewed) though the Election of Donald Trump, which made me feel the same way that ""Peter Pan Live!"" did, as the Ringling Brothers And Barnum and Bailey Circus draws to a close. As an adult, it's hard to believe on fairies, especially when you see how horrible humanity can be. But you must believe! Especially if you believe in youth, joy, and freedom for all. I LOVED the fact that Mary Martin was a women, because I was a six-year-old girl. The Musical defined me as a Feminist, even if I was too young to know what Feminism was. ""Peter Pan Live!"" took the two most powerful women in my universe, the women that played Peter Pan, and Tiger Lily, and SEXUALIZED them! NBC's power-trip of changing ""Ugg-A-Wugg"" because it was racist, was a miserable, and isolating experience. How could they claim not to be racist, and then, sexualize Native American women through Tiger Lily? The song is still followed by ""Distant Melody"" and the lyrics became PAINFULLY RELEVANT. The saving grace of ""Peter Pan Live"" was ""When I went Home"" the song that Peter sings about feeling abandoned and betrayed. It was no surprise that this was the song cut from the Original Broadway Production, It sounded like it was from the writers whose Musical I loved. Their last gift to me was making it ok to cry. I was sad, because up until that point I HAD believed in fairies, and that Mary Martin, my role model, had never done anything wrong. Plus NBC had done ""Peter Pan"" with Mary Martin, and a fair number of children, and had denounced them as racist. Social Justice Warrior that I am, I think the media could have handled it better. Like copying and pasting the Lyrics to ""Ugg-A-Wugg"" INSTEAD of posting videos with children in them. and NOT saying ""Ugg-A-Wugg"" was meaningless simply because you can't understand them. As a person with a disability, people can't understand me a lot, and at the time I first saw ""Peter Pan"" I was in speech therapy, so when the tape would come to ""Ugg-A-Wugg"" I would watch the brilliant Jerome Robbins choreography, and I would listen. I came to the conclusion that it meant ""help"" except ""Ugg-Ugg-Wah"" which meant ""I Promise."" ( Ableism is more of an undertone in this conversation) That ""I Promise"" was powerful, because with it I swore my loyalty to the characters, and the cast. When the lyrics were changed and NBC broke their loyal bonds by saying that everyone who worked on, or loved ""Peter Pan"" is o horrible racist, Sondra Lee, came to my rescue like she promised, just by giving an interview saying how sad she was, because she had happy memories off ""Peter Pan"" just like I did. The happiness it brought me was nothing to feel ashamed of, Sondra Lee is the hero of this story for relieving my isolation just enough, so I could watch ""Peter Pan Live!"" so I could tell people NBC is an EVIL HYPOCRIT! No, I couldn't be a Social Justice Warrior if I didn't believe in Fairies.",1492646400,,3127,4.6140035906642725

4071884,5,B00361EWJA,"I love the show, but the quality of this DVD is not the best. Looks like it was taken directly from one of the VHS tapes. It's a DVD option for people who want to see the show, which is fabulous. I'll warn you, the printing on the CD case is full of typos. You will wonder whether you have a bootleg copy or knockoff.
That being said, there has never been, probably never will be anything as wonderful as Mary Martin's Peter Pan.
Fans of the show will have to continue dreaming about the day when somebody takes the original recording and does a digital restoration. That high quality version is still in Never Never Land.",1458691200,8,622,4.3247863247863245
