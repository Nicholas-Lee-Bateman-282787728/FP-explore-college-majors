6424966,5,B00KGA8EHU,"Just like the first two Saints and Soldiers movies, well written, acted, filmed and realistic. Very often emotionally touching. Plus the makers of these movies do their research, they actually use the real tanks and vehicles that were available at that time! Makes the movies seem like the time it actually was. Nothing is ever perfect, but for an independent movie company, I was very impressed. Great movie to go with the rest of the series! Highly recommended.",1492819200,7,463,4.948717948717949

6424981,2,B00KGA8EHU,"Wife woke up while I was watching it, 10 seconds later she said ""the acting is terrible"" and fell back asleep. I liked Saints and Soldiers but this was just goofy. Church play quality acting, plot made no sense, the racial issues were contrived, accents were lousy and I don't think the Western US looks much like Germany. Oh and I enjoyed the semi auto BAR action. If they had made a movie of the Hellcats shooting various targets for 90 minutes it would have been better. There are lots of better and nonfictional WWII videos on Amazon that are worth your time.",1476662400,,563,4.475728155339806

6424984,1,B00KGA8EHU,"This was anti-traditional history at its best. It reinforces the present day false narrative that all whites were ...and are racists and that every American solider was a narrow-minded hater during WWII while every African American was a brave hero that was a victim of constant harassment and exclusion. Narrow minded biggest came in every color then as they do now. The incredible efforts and heroism of the Red Ball Express was grossly overlooked in this film and the characters were shallow and predictable. It shows the British as a color blind, openly inclusive society and military establishment. (Ask the Irish and the Scotts about that......) They forgot to mention the conduct and institutionalized discrimination in the British army against commonwealth troops such as Indian and Malayan (Burmese) troops. They even looked down on white Australian and New Zealand soldiers with a similar distain. The story line was good and could have been better if they didn't play the racial stuff so much and the acting was so abismal.. It was important to the story but it became consuming and distracted from the film. The Saints and Soldiers series has been a favorite of mine but this was a dismal failure and shows that political correctness is deeply ruled to the point of falsely reporting history there by detracting from the very real and incredible efforts made by African American troops in a segregated army.",1470873600,7,1419,5.042553191489362

Hoped that I could overlook the glaring deficiency in script, directing and acting enough to invest my full attention, but could never lose myself in it enough to forget that these were poor actors trying very hard to be natural.  I gutted it out to the end largely on the merit of the great military vehicles whose acting was flawless, and who deserved a better supporting cast and story.",1447632000,,556,4.770833333333333

It is not a big production with massive sound effects, lighting, or big name actors, but I thought the script was ok and the acting was not over hollywoodized. Simple... Basic...

As well noted, it looks like those TD guys had a lot of time on their hands given how clean all the equipment was.

My problem was this, the acting and dialogue at first were pretty weak and while they did improve once the action started, both were well below the first two movies.  Some have stated the real stars of the movie were the tanks, which I can understand, but I watch a movie for the whole experience, not just the action.

Ryan Little does some amazing things with period correct costumes, equipment, vehicles, etc... This is especially true given the shoe string budget.  But please, PLEASE work on the script and acting if there is a fourth installment.  Also, how about including the Pacific Theater in the next movie?",1427846400,10,765,4.664179104477612

This movie portrayed a boring and slow story with no characters that stepped forward to shine within almost 20 minutes. The story was badly developed, the characters were uninteresting and had no depth, no emotional component, and the pacing was way too slow.  I wasn't impressed with the casting, but you have to look to a bad script first.  And it makes no difference as to the budget of a movie.  If the script is bad, if it contains no emotional drama to peak the interest of the audience, it doesn't matter if it cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to hundreds of millions.  A bad story is still a bad story.
If this is a historical story, it's a shame the writing of the movie wasn't strong enough.",1424476800,2,928,4.366279069767442

What's not ok are the tanks. What we get to see are toy models like in those old Japanese disaster movies. Some of them are computer animated... no, not even animated... still Images, plastered into the movie. The life size tanks look like card board wagons more suitable for a brazilian carnival than a war movie. At least they could have tried to replicate the real tank models used in this stage of the war, but no, they thought up some fantasy models instead. Doesn't really work for credibility, I had to just laugh out loud a few times. On the upside, at least the depicted Germans speak real German or English with a credible German accent. All in all, a throwaway movie ok for a guilty pleasure pizza and beer after midnight moment.",1424390400,5,896,4.403614457831325

6425182,4,B00KGA8EHU,"acting could be better, I think the story of Negros that helped Patton clear the way has to be told. Look into "" Pattons Panthers"" and you will be amazed. ""Come out fighting"" was their moniker, many of these men fell in Europe AFTER training the white men that they ended up replacing. Truly great men from the ""Greatest generation"" that need to be recognized. Nicely done film, Spike Lee did a little better.",1414281600,4,409,4.54054054054054
6425183,3,B00KGA8EHU,"I could not make a movie like this to save my life however...if Amazon wants me to rate it I can only give three stars.

The opening shots are of the Harz mountains in the fall (rainy, snowy, mountainous, evergreen trees) however the majority of the tank battle scenes are in what appears to be the foothills of the Sierra Nevada in summer (dry, rolling hills) .  I checked the credits and it was actually filmed in Utah.

Uniforms worn by the soldiers were newish and cleanish looking and the tanks looked like they had been recently restored and no mud.

Acting was so-so.

Cool inside tank scenes.",1414022400,4,600,4.518518518518518

6425186,5,B00KGA8EHU,"Excellent World War Two movie. Tells a story of what had to be many, many untold stories of what a generation of American men did to help win a war against horrific evil. That generation, the greatest American generation, must never be forgotten and never will especially by their generation of children, us, the Baby Boomers.",1413676800,5,326,4.839285714285714

8658277,2,B00KGA8EHU,"Poor acting and story line with little understanding of military tactics.  When you are outnumbered three to one you don't take a time-out to debate racial injustice in the Army.

Two GIs run and run and run to get away from the Germans but when they go back, the Germans are just on the other side of the hill.  Where did all that distance go?  It was like a bunch of kids playing capture the flag.

The British officer taking on four Germans by taking one hostage from behind and threatening to shoot him was laughable.

This was another example of a cause looking for a movie!  I hope the other Saints and Soldiers are better than this because my hopes were high.",1516060800,,666,4.365853658536586
