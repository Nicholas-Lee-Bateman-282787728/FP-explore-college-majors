I'd met people who'd taken his workshops and I know he has a lot of ""technique"" (aka ""tricks"") that are not obvious from just looking at his paintings. If you are an experienced painter and are curious about how Mundy gets his ""look"", then here are your answers.  If you want someone to teach you how to paint, then you'll  be writing one of those ""worst video ever made"" reviews.",1439424000,,597,4.409090909090909
7799728,1,1596684410,"Horrible, worst DVD I've ever had the misfortune of buying and watching.. For anyone interested in purchasing it I have this advice, save your money, there's nothing of value here! Not only is there no substance to this DVD, you won't get anything worthwhile out of it, this person is not capable of effective communication, he speaks in monotone. So it's boring and lacking.",1407542400,,375,4.875
7799729,5,1596684410,"The information in this video is a springboard for learning and doing.  The information about the foundational truths is concise and sums up all that a beginner or an advanced painter needs to make sense of all the information out there about painting.  Sometimes it can be overwhelming to try to take in all that there is too learn, but these 7 truths that CW presents put it into simple words and explanations that bring it all together.  I have taken workshops with CW and would encourage anyone who wants to explore and understand these priciples to try to get into one of his workshops.  But if you cannot, then watch this video several times and then use these foundational elements to continue your study on your own.  You do not have to be an impressionist painter to use them, they are universal for every medium and every artistic expression you can imagine.  You do not have to learn to paint like CW, but you would do well to use his instruction to find your own artistic voice.  Thanks for sharing your lifetime of study with us CW.",1381708800,,1045,4.526595744680851
7799730,5,1596684410,"Can't tell you how much I enjoy this video! CW does an excellent job communicating with his viewers. I've been painting for about 5 years and am just now beginning to understand what it takes. I rarely have other artists to work with and to inspire me. Whenever I need a little motivation, I put this DVD in and sit back and enjoy. EVERYTIME time I watch it, I hear or see something I didn't see or hear previously. I would highly suggest this video as not only instructional, but highly motivational! It takes years do dedication and study to paint like CW. To expect to learn everything there is to know in a video, is a bit unrealistic. That said, if you watch and listen, there is a wealth of knowledge to be had. Thanks CW!",1378252800,,728,4.321167883211679
7799731,5,1596684410,"I found this video to be not only highly instructive but delightfully entertaining at the same time.  The close up views of CW's brushwork make vividly clear the steps this master artist follows to create a great painting.  His ""secrets"" are there for the taking. It inspires me to go paint my own ""masterpiece"".",1378166400,,312,4.7592592592592595
7799732,5,1596684410,"I have a large collection of the best in art education, including many DVDs . This one is my go to "" track to run on"". This is also classic CW. If you take a close look at the painting that is done, you can rest assured it is a keeper.  The reality of the search for our way forward lies in the intense study of another artists ideas. You might look at this and say, "" well, I know that"" I submit that ""knowing is not enough, we must apply it. Willing is not enough either, we must do."" This video challenges me to take the foundations to heart and make a demonstration that is  something new. That is the due to seeing the passion of this master at work.",1377820800,,655,3.9923664122137406
7799733,3,1596684410,"Too much talking and not enough action!  Camera work was sometimes too close up and made it difficult to tell what the artist was trying to show.  I don't think I learned anything new...but, it could be that I'm that bright!",1376611200,,224,4.439024390243903
7799734,2,1596684410,I feel this was the worst painting demo yet. This man has so much to give but shows so little. I waited for this demo to come expecting it to be like many other painting tapes I own but no. He hardly paints and talks constantly about a first year art level as mysteriously the painting paints itself. The best part of the whole thing was the tailor or the shots they used to sell it. He knows what we are all interested in and avoids sharing how he arrives at this. I'm sorry that when this was first reviewed by the publisher that it wasn't rejected. Life is to short not to share.,1316649600,8,582,4.114035087719298
