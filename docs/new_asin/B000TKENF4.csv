8209923,2,B000TKENF4,"The study of fandom is a new issue for modern documentary, and that is what it makes this movie worth watching. However, if you are not interested in the topic at all I wouldn't recommend it. The aesthetics of the movie are awful, the quality of the images is very poor and you can't even hear the voice of some interviewees.",1364947200,,325,4.344262295081967
8209924,5,B000TKENF4,"This is a film that captures a moment in time. The Bronze was created as a fan site and internet community for fans of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but it became so much more. Friendships, fights, marriages, partnerships and more were spawned from what started as a simple online fan community. If you are a former Bronzer, this film will be a nostalgic trip down memory lane. If you were not a Bronzer, but have participated in other online communities, you will enjoy comparing and contrasting your own community experiences with the ones recounted here. If you have never participated in an online community and wondered what they are all about, this film offers insights and tales from the people who where there when it all unfolded. To the uninitiated, online interaction often seems scary and impersonal. IRL shows the reality and the warmth that can spring from what starts out as ""only"" a ""virtual"" community.",1200096000,2,915,4.871794871794871
8209925,5,B000TKENF4,"This documentary offers a somewhat poignant look at regular people with regular lives who found a second family online. Although a Buffy fan from day one of the show, I never joined the online community for fear it would make me seem odd and lonely. This film made me realize what I'd missed as a result of my decision--the chance to participate in a wide and incredibly interesting social circle. Although the people in this documentary came to the Bronze for a variety of reasons, they all had a regular life outside that world. Furthermore, they all continue to have lives after it. However, for a brief time, they were part of something that was important to them, something that brought them together. There's nothing odd about that--isn't it what we all want ultimately? Tuszynski did a great job of bringing this story together and putting it on film. I recommend this documentary to anyone interested in Buffy, fandom, or online communities.",1200009600,,949,4.864197530864198
8209926,5,B000TKENF4,"I was a late-coming to the buffyverse: I didn't start watching the show until its sixth season.  I also wasn't a member of any Buffy fan community either online or off.  That being said, I really enjoyed this documentary and got a lot out of it.  Oftentimes we hear about the bad experiences associated with making friends and meeting people online but this film shows that sane, decent people spend time online.  You really feel the sense of community and the impact that participating on the Buffy message boards had on everyone involved.  The film seems pretty honest as well: there were arguments, hurt feelings, and it wasn't always nice and rosy.  If you've ever read Henry Jenkins' Textual Poachers and want to see how participatory culture has evolved in the last fifteen years then this documentary is a great place to start.  I'd recommend it for anyone interested in online fandom or for people who enjoyed Buffy.",1199059200,2,924,4.810126582278481
8209927,5,B000TKENF4,"This documentary has a specific focus and stays true to its original intent.  It is well-researched, intimate, flows well from one interview to the next, and captures a corner of the internet-that-was.  It can stand up proudly beside any academic documentary or entertainment memoir.",1198022400,2,283,5.409090909090909
8209928,3,B000TKENF4,"After hearing about the documentary, I made the decision to purchase it out of a mixture of curiosity and nostalgic thoughts. After watching it, the one thing that comes to mind is that this is truly an internet/fandom documentary. The people who will gain the most from watching this are those who were members of The Bronze and through that, met in real life and grew and developed as a result of that. Unfortunately, it also depicts those problems that parents fear so much these days; they refer to Trekkies as having a ""stigma"" attached to them, but in watching this, it looks as though most of the Bronzers shown have thought of The Bronze as their second home, and credit it as being responsible for who they are today. They talk about someone they dislike and the rumours about this person, but they leave out the excessive bullying and harrassment caused by so many of them to so many others. The Bronze towards the end was full of cliques - people causing fights, chasing others out for not conforming to their views. It wasn't a nice place in the end. The sound quality is dubious at best. This isn't what could be called a serious documentary, more a fan film shot by a fan for the benefit and memories of other fans. Perhaps it should have taken in the views of other Bronzers and even included the BronzeBeta which has been going now for many years. Hopefully most Bronzers have better memories than this small subset have provided.",1188777600,,1446,4.586872586872587
8209929,5,B000TKENF4,"This documentary brought back memories, both good and bad of a place the likes of which will never be seen or experienced again on the internet. Anyone who has called themselves a Bronzer needs to purchase In Real Life. If you had friends or family who never understood why you flew thousands of miles to meet people you met on the internet, you need to show them this film. Stephanie Tuszynski presents a true and honest documentary of the rise and fall of the online community known as The Bronze. I was and still consider myself a Bronzer; and IRL made me realize again how much I and so many others were deeply impacted by the online community and friendships we made, because of a show called Buffy The Vampire Slayer. Being a member of this online community changed my life for the better, and Tuszynski's documentary is a tribute to that.",1187049600,5,845,4.565789473684211
