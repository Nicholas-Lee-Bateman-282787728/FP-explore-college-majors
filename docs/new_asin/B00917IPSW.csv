Like Metropolis this film is simply astounding, what Lang envisioned and achieved is an epic production in every way. If you're interested in the history of film this is simply a must have. Imagine Lord of the Rings only decades before at the dawn of film making art and you have Fritz Lang productions.",1352505600,7,434,4.4375

5240766,4,B00917IPSW,"After seeing Metropolis I thought it would be fun to get Die Nibelungen. I was impressed with the quality of the restoration of the film & special effects, which for the day are very good.

I found the English subtitles annoying! Deutsch ist meine Muttersprache (German is my native tongue) and so I was able to read the German, though the script is a little too fancy at times. I realized my German isn't quite as rusty as I thought because I understood not only most of the written German, but the spoken German in the special features.

Die Nibelungen is a great old silent German film, one I know I'll enjoy for years to come!",1452038400,,630,4.422413793103448
5240767,5,B00917IPSW,"Beautiful and almost complete restoration of the Fritz Lang Mastrpiece silent film, kind of the Lord of the Rings of its day. I had the previous version and prefer it in some ways. The new version is tinted and I don't care much for that. Nice music, newly recorded, original score. Great action and pathos as jealousy and love and backstabbing (literally) takes place. The second half is concerned with revenge. A must see for silent film buffs.",1442188800,,446,4.730769230769231
5240768,5,B00917IPSW,"Die Nibelungen is a retelling of the Ring cycle,  This Ring cycle should not be confused with the Lord of Rings.  Fritz Lang as always makes a great film.  The one is told in two parts, Siegfried and Kriemhild's Revenge.  This version of the Ring cycle, has no ring and no Gods. It changes some of the basic elements of the old legend. Brunhild is not a Valkyrie, but a warrior Queen who will not marry  a man unless that man defeats her in Battle. Siegfried defeats a dwarf and steels his magic helmet and gains the power to change appearance and become invisible.  The Dragon is a full size dragon and for it time, 1924 is impressive.  They used a lot of white makeup on faces and lots of eye makeup in silent films.  Since we could not hear the actors speaking, so they had to rely on facial expression to convey all of their emotions.  The actors do a great job of letting you see their Anger, love, happiness , frustration and hatred.  The story is well written and both movies complete the story.  The second movie moves away from the legend and adds Attila the Hun to spice things up.  I still enjoyed both movies.  I liked the different take on the Siegfried saga, No Gods, no Rein maidens, and the gold treasure ends up in the Rein.  I would recommend it.",1441929600,,1264,4.323404255319149

There is a remake of it but don't bother, see this silent masterpiece. The sets, costumes and effects for the 20's are mind numbing for it's time, breathless fantasy and equal story. KINO is the masters that bring cinema to Blu-ray. There line of silent films on blu-ray is amazing and utterly flooring at the art form and craftmanship they put into there products. Die Nibelungen is the very reality of masterpiece. This is the film to own for it's old school amazing production. The special features are awesome and the transfer of this film is mastery at it finest. Never has this film been with such clarity. They honored this masterpiece film.

5240774,5,B00917IPSW,"My prejudices are: Fritz Lang was a genius, ""Metropolis"" is the greatest silent movie ever made and one of the ten greatest movies of all time. So now that that has been established the 5 Star rating is for ""Siegfried"" and NOT ""Kriemhild's Revenge"". First, ""Siegfried""...the opening scene drags a bit, spending 16 minutes establishing Our Hero as a splendid example of Nordic Manhood. The the fun starts as he begins his journey to Burgundy, self-discovery, an emo Princess, various dwarves, magic helmets, stolen treasure, a slightly incestuous love quadrangle, bathing in dragon's blood, epic heroism in defeating God's sworn enemies, back-stabbing treachery and a simply lovely funeral. And all this, mind you, brought to stunning life by the eye of Fritz Lang. Anyone familiar with the visuals of ""Metropolis"" can see Lang and his team's work here done on a smaller scale: the beautifully designed sets, the fabulous costumes, the matte shots, special effects, dramatic lighting; it's all pure Lang and a pure delight. It is not ""Metropolis"", but what is? If you are a fan of silent movies you will love ""Siegfried"".

""KR"" is another matter. I watched the whole thing in 2 viewings. It is one of those movies that is worth watching, but my guess is 90% of those who do will never watch it again. It was re-edited by Lang when it bombed at the box office and met with almost universal disapproval (as opposed to ""S"" which made big bank and the critics loved) and it is a mess. Weird and disjointed. K spends the whole movie staring either vacantly or furiously into the distance. Attila and the Huns are depicted as cavemen that scamper about like chimps. The Huns and Germans seem to fight each other 1 minute and then party hearty together the next. If you are an emo girl, an emo-gothgirl hybrid, or if you love ""Dr Zhivago"" you might like this movie. Maybe. I would give it a shot, it does have the usual Langian visual flair, but he and Thea really should have realized that this movie was a bore waiting to happen.

In sum: if you love silent films, epics, fantasy, and/or have a general appreciation for the GIANTS of the early days of cinema like Fritz Lang you will love ""Siegfried"" and it is well worth your purchase.",1411862400,7,2230,4.70076726342711

If you like adventure and you don't mind watching a film from the wary 20th century for hours at a time, I highly recommend it.",1405036800,,253,4.291666666666667
5240777,5,B00917IPSW,"This is, without the shadow of doubt, one of the BEST and GREATEST films ever made! It impressed me and moved me like few others ever did and its great finale left me shocked and devastated. I LOVED every single minute of it! Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Finally available in its fully restored version in the ""Masters of cinema"" series, ""Die Nibelungen"" is composed of two parts: ""Siegfried"" and ""Kriemhild's revenge"". This is a very long film - it lasts a grand total 288 minutes - but I swear I didn't see the time passing by! Made in 1924, this film is of course mute and in black and white, but even if such thing bothers you, after first two minutes you will stop noticing it. Me personally I like to see an old mute black and white film from time to time as they have a unique charm - and that one has this kind of charm and many other treasures as well.

This film is inspired by the medieval German poem ""Nibelungenlied"", which was also ONE of inspirations for Wagner's monumental saga ""Der ring des Nibelungen"". This film however is NOT connected to Wagner's works other than by common source of inspiration. Therefore, even if there are here some evil gnomes (the Nibelungen), one huge dragon and a fierce maiden warrior (Brunhild, the Queen of Iceland), do not expect here any Norse gods or Valkyries.

There is also NO music by Wagner. The music in this film is monumental - as it should be - and by moments it sounds as if Wagner was the inspiration for it, but it is nevertheless an original and distinct thing, written by Gottfried Huppertz, the man who was going later to write also the score for ""Metropolis"".

I will not talk here a lot about the plot. I guess virtually everybody knows, at least in great lines, the story of Siegfried, his exploits and his fate - and considering that the second part of ""Die Nibelungen"" has the word ""revenge"" in it, it is quite obvious that it tells how Siegfried's death was avenged.

Siegfried is of course the main hero in the first part, as is Kriemhild in the second part, but ""Die Nibelungen"" shows many other incredible characters, like Brunhild, the fierce, cruel and devilishly proud warrior-queen of Iceland, whose curse is to have been born so strong and powerful that virtually no man can be her match - and therefore she is doomed to either remain lonely or lower herself to the level of a man lesser than her.
Equally, if not more important, is Gunther, the man who was born to wear the crown of Burgundy, but didn't receive the strength or wisdom which would allow him to be a successful ruler - or man... Etzel (in fact Attila), the half-bestial king of Huns, is of course crucially important to the second part of the saga, as is his younger brother Bledel (in fact Bleda), a prince who is also a kind of fool at the court of his mightier sibling.

Kriemhild is initially shown as a virginal, angelic creature, to be adored, worshipped, cared for and protected and as long as her husband lives, this is exactly what she is - but when the one and only man she loved is destroyed by murder and treason most foul, it will wake up a bloodthirsty screeching beast from hell, which  was sleeping hidden safely from sight in the darkest depths of her soul...

But for me it was the grim, disfigured one-eyed giant Hagen Tronje, the evil alter-ego of Siegfried, who is the most impressive character. The man is clearly bad to the bone and enjoys murder and treason as much as others like to take a croissant with their coffee, but he is neither fool nor coward, he has a way with words which matches his skill with sword and he has his own, dark, ferocious and implacable sense of honour. Also his looks are IMPRESSIVE - I am almost certain that at least in general lines he was a distant inspiration for Darth Vader from Star Wars.

One thing however that I must say here about the story is that contrary to what one can expect, this is less a tale of heroic knights and warriors, but in fact it is much more the story of two women, who were horribly wronged and who got back at those who wronged them - BIG TIME! In the first film both queen Brunhild and princess Kriemhild are horribly wronged, betrayed and abused. Brunhild gets her horrible revenge at the end of the first film, but pays a great price for it. Kriemhild gets her REALLY HORRIBLE revenge at the end of the second film - and pays an even higher price for it...

Hell indeed hath no fury as a woman scorned, but this film teaches us in fact, that ALL HELLS have no fury as a woman wronged... I can hardly thing of another movie in which men would be so skilfully manipulated by clever, strong women, to do their bidding - and in which so many men would be so mercilessly destroyed by clever, strong and absolutely ruthless minds of two proud, but deeply hurt females... OK, nothing more here about the story.

Continuing about strong women. It is said that behind every great man, there is a great woman who made his greatness possible... Never was such thing more true than with Fritz Lang. Married from 1922 to 1933 Lang and his slightly older wife, Thea Gabriele von Harbou, were a real ""dream team"". He was a genius visionary director, maybe the greatest who ever lived and she was an incredibly gifted screenwriter, who also wrote novels in her spare time. Thea von Harbou wrote scenarios for the greatest of Lang's masterpieces: ""Destiny"", ""Dr. Mabuse, der spieler"", ""Die Nibelungen"", ""Metropolis"", ""Spione"", ""Frau im mond"", ""M"" and ""Testament of Dr. Mabuse"" - she also wrote novels ""Bengal Tiger ""and ""Indian Tomb"", which Lang would adapt to the screen long after their divorce - and soon after her death... Their collaboration on ""Nibelungen"" was total and this film is as much Thea von Harbou's work as his.

Now, this film is a treasure in itself, even if we appreciate it without thinking of the time and place in which it was made. I believe however, that to fully comprehend Fritz Lang's vision shown in ""Die Nibelungen"" it is necessary to place this film in the historical context. It is important to always remember the dedication which precedes the first scenes: ""Dedicated to the German people""...
This dedication was included there by common decision of Fritz Lang who directed the film and his wife, who wrote the scenario.

Thea von Harbou was a fierce German nationalist and even if Fritz Lang was a man of much more moderate political views, both husband and wife found a common ground when making this film and dedicating it ""to the German people"". Indeed, after already suffering greatly during the whole World War I, in barely five years, from 1918 to 1924, Germans were indeed crushed by many devastating, successive blows:

- in  1918 a sudden collapse and defeat in a war which one year earlier looked winnable

- in 1919 the Treaty of Versailles which imposed very harsh and in some points also humiliating terms on Germany

- from 1919 to 1920 a series of low level but brutal and bloody civil wars, involving far left, far right and Polish separatists

- in 1921 the beginning of hyperinflation and a partial defeat in war against Polish separatists in Silesia

- in 1922 continuation of political unrest, terrorist assassinations of public figures and more hyperinflation

- in 1923 more political unrest (appearance of Nazis), even more hyperinflation and especially brutal occupation of Ruhr by French and Belgian troops

- in 1924 continued occupation of Ruhr, with more and more brutalities by foreign troops and considerable economic damage to the country

Small wonder than in such situation there was a need amongst German public for something that would help people to take their minds away from this bleak reality, if only the time of a cinema sance. But of course providing some distraction was DEFINITELY NOT the only reason why this epic film was made and dedicated to the German people.

With its grandiose settings, larger than life characters and monumental music this film was reminding to the public the greatness of German past and its achievements. Also, by showing the terrible comeuppance the wicked ones get, it promised that there would be a time when scores would be settled with those who wronged and persecuted Germany and its people. The hand of Thea von Harbou can be clearly seen in this part of scenario, as she was definitely the fiercer and more bellicose one in the team - she would ultimately join NSDAP in 1933 and write scenarios for films made by Nazis until the end of the III Reich.

But even this is NOT all, as this film proved to be even MORE PROPHETIC than Thea von Harbou intended. Yes, Germany would got its revenge, exactly as Brunhild and Kriemhild got theirs - but ultimately it would pay also a high, EXTREMELY high price for it, exactly as Brunhild and Kriemhild did...

This is a unique, powerful, magnificent, monumental and absolutely heart-breaking film, which everybody should see at least once in a lifetime. See it, tremble with admiration and cry... A lot.",1397088000,9,9009,4.626174076393237
5240778,3,B00917IPSW,"Well I wouldn't say its ONLY value is as a relic, but its close. The first part of the movie it the most interesting. it deals with magic, court life and edict and politics, etc. Of particular interest is the story's gender theory. The weakest man wants the strongest woman, the strongest woman wants( or will only yield to) the strongest man, the strongest man wants the weakest woman and so on; now THIS is the story of life! That part of the movie was brilliant. The sets and acting are captivating, even mesmerizing. The first par of the movie made sense, and it was nearly perfect.

The second part of the movie it pains me to say, turns into nonsense and drivel. The key problem with it is that it basically becomes a proto Nazi propaganda film. The Huns and Atilla are reduced to cartoon figures and clowns. They're basically skulking eastern monkeys. The Germans are fair haired, tall, honorable, beautiful. The huns are skulking, scheming, debauched. It becomes impossible to beleive that THESE people were the fearsome warriors who almost conquered Europe. One can ONLY conclude that they were a ""horde"" who simply over-ran the noble westerners through sheer force of numbers, and of course through treachery. Atilla himself is a weakling, a husk, and a shell, inactive and inept. Thats a waste of one of history's great figures. Its pure propaganda, and has no basis in reality. The story itself in the second half basically disintegrates. Theres nothing there, it doesnt stand the test of time at all. But its a beautiful movie, and worth seeing for a view into 1920's German film making.",1395273600,4,1600,4.776173285198556
5240779,5,B00917IPSW,"Long before THE LORD OF THE RINGS and THE HOBBIT there was DIE NIBELUNGEN (The Nibelung Saga). This 1924 epic from Fritz Lang is the grandaddy of all fantasy epics and now it can be seen as it was first presented with over 100 minutes of footage restored and with the original music that was composed for it by Gottfried Huppertz. After all the attention that was given to Peter Jackson's J.R.R. Tolkien films, this is the perfect time to release this film  on Blu-Ray giving us the opportunity to see a silent equivalent of Jackson's cinematic accomplishments. For those of you familiar with the Wagner RING cycle there are some similarities but in fact it's an entirely different story.

The entire running time is close to five hours and is divided into two separate films SIEGFRIED and KRIEMHILD'S REVENGE. The entire story deals with deeds of valor and codes of honor and what happens when they are carried too far. Along the way there are dwarves, magic, blood oaths, ferocious battles and the devastating consequences when powerful emotions take over and rational compromises are rejected. The parallels to what took place in Nazi Germany a few years later are truly startling. Lang showed the world what would happen there 20 years before it did. It's ironic but not surprising that DIE NIBLUNGEN was Hitler's favorite film.

The outstanding restoration work done by the F.W. Murnau Foundation coupled with the powerful new Dolby soundtrack of the original score makes viewing and hearing this masterpiece a thrilling experience. From the stylized barbaric sets and astonishing camera effects through the ultra stylized acting and actions, we see more than German silent cinema at its zenith, we are witness to the rebirth of a truly great work of art. This 2 disc Blu-Ray set (one for each film) comes loaded with a number of special features that give background on the film and the people responsible for it. One minor quibble, I don't mind the title cards being in Old German but sometimes the subtitles are hard to read.",1392336000,,2033,4.869942196531792
5240780,3,B00917IPSW,"There must be something the matter with me!  I love silent movies.  I have bought Metropolis in several incarnations, own hundreds of DVDs of the great silent Comedians and serious serious stars of the era, and have even made it though ""Caberia"" and ""Intolerance"", but I literally can't stay awake during Die Nieblungen.  Thank goodness for reverse on Blu-ray players.  I finally was able to finish the first film, but realized by the end that I had no idea what was going on.  I ""rewound"" and discovered I had missed the entire scene with Siegfried and Brunhilda because I had nodded off!
I understand all the intellectual reasons that this is a good film, and have viewed the documentary included and read a lot on line, but the entire thing seems to be played in slow motion.

We are honored to be able to step back in history and share this moment with the audience of that time period. The expressions of the characters showed strong emotion ranging from jealousy, pride, hate, love, greed, life and death, binding the story together towards the culmination of total destruction. We viewed this film after reading the books, The Edda and Das Nibelungenlied, as well as the journal Der Worms Gau, 2001, which features the large Nibelungen fresco paintings by the German artist Hans Friedrich Grohs (1892-1981) in the Nibelungen City of Worms, Germany.",1371427200,,748,5.0894308943089435

Be advised that this is in no way a version of Wagner's Ring operas, but rather of the medieval epic poem on which Wagner partially based his story. The plots are closest in the first film but split off radically in part two, where Siegfried's grieving widow Kriemhild actually marries Attila the Hun in order to avenge her husband's death. Let's just say that my respect for the vision of Peter Jackson fell several points after I saw how Fritz Lang's masterpiece did everything he did nearly a century earlier and without CGI!

5240783,5,B00917IPSW,"Jean Renoir was a genius. I've seen most of his films and read many of his books. One thing he said that has always stuck with me is his idea that technological advancements would ruin (and had ruined) cinema. He said that technical constraints and overcoming those constraints is what made film an artform; technology would reduce it to a craft.

Lang's ""Die Nibelungen"" is a perfect example of this. Lang's silent film epic about a Nordic blacksmith's apprentice's rise to kingly prominence (he is, after all the son of Sigmund) and alliance with the King of Burgandy for their mutual benefit via the slaying of a dragon, discovery of the Nibelungen treasure and defeat of Brunhild, then ultimate downfall, is absolute magic. Lang uses every trick in the book including elaboratre set design (which withstands the scrutiny of numerous high-angle shots), costumes, split screens, fades, practical effects and makeup, double exposure, manipulation of film stock, and artful intertitles; the power of the story overcomes the limitations of the medium.

How refreshing, when in these moderns times, story is always overwhelmed by technology.

It's been said many times that Fritz Lang was ahead of his time. This film and Metropolis prove that fact beyond any doubt. If you like motion pictures as art, this film is a wonderful example of that premise.",1364601600,,506,4.173469387755102
5240786,5,B00917IPSW,"If Murnau's FAUST is pure dream-like fantasy, never settling on anything solid but dissolving from one mist-filled, wildly imaginative scene to another, Lang's DIE NIBELUNGEN is a fantasy film that has its feet firmly planted on the ground.

And what a ground it is: the sets, all full-sized (mostly), the miniatures, the outstanding costume design, the in-camera visual effects, the life-sized dragon that actually blasts Paul Richter with fire, all make up an amazing and economic retelling of the medieval epic, The Nibelungenlied. Gottfried Huppertz's original orchestral score has been reconstructed and recorded for this release and it is so good - Wagnerian but without resorting to Wagner - that I'm surprised it never had a life of its own in the concert hall. It's almost as if the images on the screen are an accompaniment to the music itself, rather than the other way around.

This two disc set is great, with SIEGFRIED on one disc and KRIEMHILD'S REVENGE on the other. The cinematography, sharp and clear and real rather than foggy and fantasy-like, really comes out in this restored print. Tinted a ruddy gold, except for the pale blue of Kriemhild's dream sequence (astonishing animation using charcoal sketches), the entire impression one is left with after its five hour viewing time is like having looked through a window into the ancient, legendary past. Very faithful to the NIBELUNGENLIED on which it was based, with a few simplifications here and there for dramatic smoothness.

An epic tale of how a single lie destroys two kingdoms and lays the land to waste, it is surprising that DIE NIBELUNGEN was so popular with Hitler and his brood. But then, like the characters in Part I, they were fully convinced that what they were doing was right. The codes of honor in Part I become liabilities in Part II, and everything goes straight to hell. It is said that SIEGFRIED was Hitler's favorite film; like most corrupt leaders, he never delved deeper into the rest of the story. And as a result, entire kingdoms were laid waste.",1362009600,3,2047,4.927536231884058

One of those geniuses was Fritz Lang and his wife, Thea Von Harbou who co-wrote most of his German scripts. Die Nibelugen is a classic Germanic folk tale that is so massive, its actually been cut into two films. This is a true epic spectacle on a massive scale that deserves a place at the table along with the original Ben Hur, Birth of a Nation, and Lang's most expensive and complex production Metropolis.

This edition of Die Nibelugen was recently restored under the watchful eye of the Frederick Wilhelm Murnau Foundation and has been painstakingly restored to as close a perfect as they could get.

It sounds obviously uncompressed and jumps out from my speakers. It is so crystal clear, you can hear the shifting chairs of the orchestra and I like to think I can even hear the cleaning of the woodwind instruments. :) I have always had a soft spot in my heart for live performances where you can hear the occasional shift of chair and audience cough, and this performance fits that... so some of you may find that annoying, yet it isn't overpowering. The soundtrack is so rich, I have turned my TV off, set my OPPO player to ""Audio Only"", and have enjoyed the soundtrack on its own while studying.

5240792,5,B00917IPSW,"They were Germany's powerhouse couple, filmmaker Fritz Lang who had a successful hit with ""Dr. Mabuse: The Gambler"" (1922), the famous director would marry writer Thea von Harbou, the woman he helped writing her screenplay and helped her with the production of the adaptation of her 1917 novel ""Das indische Grabmal"" (The Indian Tomb).

The two worked together for the film ""Der mude Tod"" (Destiny) in 1921 but for von Harbou, she would continue to gain acclaim in 1922 for her adaptation of F.W. Murnau's ""Phantom"" and the 1924 film ""Die Finanzen des Grobherzogs"" (Finances of the Grand Duke).

But as von Harbou was planning on her next novel known as ""Metropolis"", before that novel, she would and Friz Lang would work together in what would become a major, epic collaboration between the husband and wife team.

Writing a detailed script for an adaptation of ""Nibelungenlied"" (The Song of the Nibelungs), an epic poem created between 1180-1210 in Middle High German and is a tragic story.

The script would be part of ""Die Nibelungen"" and be featured as two films ""Die Nibelungen: Siegfried"" and ""Die Nibelungen: Kriemhilds Rache"" (Kriemhild's Revenge).  And suffice to say, the film was a success.  Deemed as a form of German Expressionist through symbolism, it is said that ""Die Nibelungen"" was the inspiration for Sergei Eisenstein when he created ""Alexander Nevski"".

At an event in Yale back in 1966, Lang said of ""Die Nibelungen"", ""I was interested in bring to life a German saga in a manner different from Wagnerian opera, without beards and so on.  I tried to show in the ""Nibelungen"" four different worlds: the primeval forest, where lives the crippled Mime who teaches Sigfried to forge his sword, the dragon and the mystic subterranean realm of Alberich, the deformed dwarfish keeper of the Nibelung treasure, which he curses when slain by Siegfried.  Secondly, the stylised, slightly degenerate, over-cultured world of the kings of Burgundy, already about to disintegrate.  And finally the world of the wild Asiatic hordes of the Huns, and their clash with the world of the Burgundians (Who changed their names to Nibelungen after taking over their treasure).

Filmed in nine months, it was the most challenging film that Lang had undertaken in his career thus far.  It pushed his crew to create something that has never been done but also to create a film knowing they will not have the budget, compared to something like a D.W. Griffith Hollywood drama.  He and his wife, Thea von Harbou knew how to work around budget constraints, while Lang knew how to push people's buttons but get the best out of them.

Working with a distinguished crew such as Carl Hoffman as cinematographer but also working with art direction courtesy of Otto Hunte and Karl Volbrecht, set decoration by Erich Kettelhut and Vollbrecht and costume design by Paul Gerd Guderian and Aenne Willkomm, it was a production that required the best in visual effects of that time period.

Atmospheric landscapes were built, Attila was inspired by etchings by Max Klinger and the German Expressionist of creating harmony, balance through its characters, its structures and architectural composition was important.

So, nearly 90-years after this film was released to theaters and would be released on DVD, an extensive 35mm restoration was conducted by Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung .  While there is no original cut that exists, fortunately many negatives of a variety of versions made for different countries  did survive, albeit in various states of deterioration.

Using today's modern digital technology, ""Die Nibelungen""which took four years to restore, was screened in April 2010.  And now, the HD special edition of ""Die Nibelungen"" was released on Blu-ray and DVD in the U.S. courtesy of Kino Lorber as part of their Kino Classics lineup.

VIDEO:

""Die Nibelungen: Special Edition"" is presented in 1080p High Definition and is color-tinted.  Having owned the previous Kino DVD release, ""Die Nibelungen: Special Edition"" looks absolutely magnificent on Blu-ray but most importantly, the restoration done by Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung was incredible!

It's important to note that when you start up both Blu-ray releases, you are given the following message:

""Despite its rich history and reputation, no complete, German version of Die Nibelungen exists today, neither in the form of original distribution prints nor camera negatives. This photochemical restoration is derived from incomplete camera negatives. Missing parts were supplemented with various dupe negatives and surviving distribution prints. The tinting follows the color scheme of the original prints and utilizes the authentic photochemical method: the creation of a black and white print, which is then colored in a dye bath. The German intertitles were digitally restored, taken from preserved prints and negatives. Reconstructed titles are indicated with the logo of the Murnau foundation. For the HD mastering, the picture was corrected in some places and severe film damage was digitally repaired.""

Similar to ""Metropolis"" which incorporated footage from other sources, you can not tell by watching this film on Blu-ray.  The film looks as if it hasn't aged.  Yes, you can see specks and scratches from this nearly 90-year-old film but the film's clarity is impressive.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Die Nibelungen: Special Edition"" is presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and the original 1924 score by Gottfried Huppertz is captivating.  HR-Sinfonieorchester and the Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra should be commended for recreating Huppertz 1924 score because as epic as the film is for its artistic and visual achievement, the music is magnificent!  I absolutely loved the music for this film!

Also, included is a LPCM 2.0 stereo soundtrack and intertitles are included.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Over a decade ago, when I first watched Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"", I absolutely fell in love with the film.  I came to enjoy Fritz Lang films, as well as films written by Thea von Harbou.

Watching as many Weimar-era films, watching many films based on German Expressionism, reading books on the genre and really, trying to imagine how filmmaking was in Germany during that era.  But one film has always caught my attention in terms of epic early German films and that film was ""Die Nibelungen"".

Yes, ""Metropolis"" was a masterpiece but ""Die Nibelungen"" was a major achievement for both Lang and his wife-at-the-time, Thea von Harbou.  Not only did this film lead to Harbou's work becoming internationally known but for its visual and artistic achievement, it would show producers that Fritz Lang was a capable filmmaker that is able to take on huge films.  Films that may not have the budget or the size of a D.W. Griffith Hollywood epic but Lang would have to find a way and von Harbou would have to accommodate any writing changes to reflect any changes that would be deemed to expensive.

So, during this time of German cinema, there was a lot of experimentation that Fritz Lang and his cinematographer Carl Hoffman  would have to tinker with.  For example, one scene in which the dwarfs are turned into stone by Alberich had to show a moment where the dwarfs are screaming.  The other well-known cinematographer Gunther Rittau would find ways to come up with movie magic through superimposing images.

For Siegfried's fight against the dragon, mechanisms were needed to be created in order to make the movement seem life-like.  So, I can imagine for early 1920s, how this film would be a marvelous achievement in visual effects in cinema.  The crew was pushed to their limits and no matter how strict Lang was to pushing one over the edge, it led to the efficacy of the film as ""Die Nibelungen"" looks and feels like an alternate world that has come alive.

But as the first film was more of an introduction of characters, the first film was important in establish Siegfried and Kriemhild, King Gunther and Hagen as well as Brunhild and how far one would go into exacting revenge.  Vengeance is a theme that shows no positive conclusion to either film as it only leads to tragedy.

For ""Die Nibelungen: Siegfried"", viewers were probably in shock as what looked to be the films protagonist, finds himself betrayed by the same people he worked and cared for.  The film was like an an adventure, a dream come true with tragic results.

But of course, Germans had a different interpretation of the film at that time.  Marx-Engels wrote in 1840 for ""Telegraph fr Deutschland No. 197"", ""Siegfried is the representative of German youth.  All those among us whose hearts are still untamed by the oppressions of life know what this means.  We are filled with the same thirst for action, the same resistance against the conventional... in us, the eternal weight up of things, the philistine fear of quick action is something we hate with all of our soul..we would like to tear down the barricade of circumspection."".

While ""Die Nibelungen: Kriemhild's Revenge"" was a film that felt bittersweet, dark and vengeful.  And because of that, I found it the most fascinating of the two films.  Mainly to see how a woman, so full of love, would literally give her soul and her life to see the man who killed her beloved Siegfried, killed.  And because she believes her life died when Siegfried was killed, but also when her family would do nothing but protect Hagen, the man who killed Siegfried, she is a woman on one mission.  And that mission is to exact revenge on Hagen and to her, that is all that matters.

Suffice to say, people have various interpretations of this film.  People are moved differently when watching this film.  Sergei Eisenstein was inspired by ""Die Nibelungen"" and it would give him the inspiration to go on and create his own epic ""Alexander Nevsky"", many debated the film because it was loved by Hitler and Goebbels and some even felt the film was anti-semitic  and that the character of Alberich depicted in the film had Jewish features.  In Lang's defense, he did consult the Ulmlauff of the Hamburg Ethnographical Museum in order to capture the overall look of these characters.

I'm not an erudite on German history or culture, so I'll leave it to the debaters to engage in polemic discussion.  For me, personally, I saw this film as a good vs. evil storyline with tragic consequences.  I know this is probably a bad example to use as a comparison, but in order to create a juxtaposition that some people reading this review will be able to understand, one can look at a film like ""Star Wars"" and see how one can be good, but easily consumed by darkness and vengeance.

In the first film, Siegfried and Kriemhild wore white and were the couple who were the symbol of love, Hagen and Brumhild in black and were symbols of darkness or instigators of tragedy.  The second film, Kriemhild who was once the purist princess had become a dark queen.  So dark that even Attila the Hun seemed as if he was weakened by his new wife.  Nevertheless, a tragic film, an epic film with wonderful architecture and the scale of the many people who were involved as extras without having to go to extravagant when compared to D.W. Griffith's 1916 film ""Intolerance"".

But one can easily look back at the film and think, how things would have never gotten out of hand if Siegfried kept his mouth closed.  Suffice to say, no lessons would be learn and this is based on a tragic poem.  But you have to give credit to Thea von Harbou for taking on such a monumental task of crafting a screenplay with full detail and Fritz Lang for bringing that script to life in cinema.

For silent epics, I found ""Die Nibelungen"" to be a more engaging and accessible silent film because its story and actors are coherent.  Sometimes, words do not need to be said and everything can be seen within one's eyes.  Actress Margarete Schon was fantastic as Kriemhild as you can easily sense the tragedy, the emotions of pain, happiness, sadness, love and evil.  Sometimes, there are characters who tend to overact but when it matters most, it's the look that you get from watching Margaret Schon, the eyes of Kriemhild and the transformation she goes from one film to the the second.  An innocent flower to a cold-hearted queen.

And for decades, this film has continued to entertain audiences of different generations.  I'm glad that Fritz Lang did not accept offers to remake ""Die Nibelungen"" because the film would lose have lost its luster and possibly be overacted or poorly acted.  For the way they are now, these two films manage to be effective and highly entertaining as silent films that can never be duplicated.

Now, with its release on Blu-ray, fully-restored, one can appreciate the painstaking effort by Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung for its four years of restoring the film.  Picture quality was fantastic and no sign of major damage.  Yes, for a nearly 90-year-old film, it will have its white specks and scratches but for the clarity alone, I was impressed of how awesome both films look on Blu-ray.  This is the cleanest, sharpest and best looking version of the film to date and I was impressed of how much of a difference ""Die Nibelungen: Special Edition"" looks in HD compared to its previous Kino DVD counterpart.  Big difference!

And as for the music, HR-Sinfonieorchester and the Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra's rendition of the original 1924 Gottfried Huppertz composition presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 was simply magnificent.  I was captivated by the music soundtrack and to heart in HD, I was moved and even going so far to look up if a soundtrack is available!  And as far as special features are concerned, there is a 68-minute documentary plus newsreel footage of Fritz Lang included.  But I'm just happy that these two films were presented together on Blu-ray and they look and sound so awesome on Blu-ray!

Overall, ""Die Nibelungen: Special Edition"" is an epic that silent films fans should watch and also own!  May you be a Fritz Lang or Thea von Harbou fan or a cineaste who appreciates German Expressionist cinema, ""Die Nibelungen: Special Edition"" is a Blu-ray release that is highly recommended!  5-stars!",1354233600,48,14777,4.984094616639478
5240793,5,B00917IPSW,"Die Nibelungen (1924) filmed at UFA (Read the book ""The UFA Story"").  Director Fritz Lang, the original story ""Siegfried's Tod"" I have seen it with German subtitles and other versions with English subtitles.  Paul Richter (Siegfried) was in 45 other films, from 1921 to 1972.

Siegfried (Paul Richter) is the son of the King of Xnnetn (Sigmund).  He forges his own sward so sharp that it cuts chicken feathers.  He is told that near the Rhine at Worms the King of Burgundy (Gunter) and his sister, Kriemhild is at a castle.  Siegfried, ""On the hour I leave for Worms to win Kriemhild""...""Show me the way if you want to live!""  He falls for the ""I know a short-cut"" routine.  Die Nibelungen snickers when he is out of earshot; ""Your way leads not to Worms, but to Death"" Guess who lives in the heart of the forest?  Yep it is Fafnir the Dragon.  Poor Fafnir was minding his own business getting a drink when Siegfried gets that ""What can I hack"" look on his face.  The dragon even wags his tail with the approach of Siegfried.  I won't give you the blow by blow.  I'll just say that smoking can kill you.  Fafnir gets stuck for the drinks and dragon blood drinks allows you to understand the birds.  A little birdie tells him that bathing in dragon blood will make him invulnerable.  You guest it cover your eyes.  Oops look real quick.  ""Dragon tail flicks linden leaf on Siggie's back.""  Can you say Achilles heel?  Meanwhile back at the castle Volker von Alzey is already singing to Kriemhild of Siegfried' triumph over Fafnir.  From here it goes on to deal with treasure, invisibility, and all the stuff that Teutonic mythology holds.

This is a quick over view of what will take three hours plus to unfold.

--------------------------------------------------
I have several copies; most of them are VHS. This was introduced to me n German class decades ago. Even though I have watched this several times I still come across a part that I do not remember.

I have also read ""The Nibelungenlied"" translated by A T. Hatto. Richard Wagner's ""The Ring of the Nibelung"" and various works related to the film.

So far my favorite of all versions is  ""Die Nibelungen (Special Kino Classics Edition) [Blu-ray] by Fritz Lang"" This comes with two disks and is well paced. The original German silent inter-titles; unfortunately inter-titles are in an ancient script. Still it is a tad better than relying on English sub-tittles.

There is a litany of added material and restoration corrections that would take pages to put in a review.

I am still keeping my other versions. So take a hint and do not wait for them to were out before getting the latest updates.

5240794,5,B00917IPSW,"Intricate, intelligent, and charged with emotional intensity, Fritz Lang's cinematic telling of the great German legend is truly magnificent to behold. Made when silent films were at their height of artistic and dramatic expression, DIE NIBELUNGEN (1924) puts the CGI blockbusters of today to shame.

The film perfectly captures a medieval atmosphere with an authentic feel to the sets and costumes. The performers especially are in total sync with the grandeur this subject matter demands. Everything is in keeping with how epics should be made, and Kino did a splendid job of presenting the film in a fully restored Blu-ray edition that looks glorious. Transferred from 35mm sources and dyed orange via a photochemical process (as per the original release prints), this is the closest we have to Lang's original vision. And there's a lot to see - just knowing that the grand sets were actually constructed for the film instead of having the actors popped into flat, digitally enhanced backgrounds adds a dimension of reality lacking in most contemporary films of this type.

For years historians focused attention on the first part, SIEGFRIED, whereas the second part, KRIEMHILD'S REVENGE, had a somewhat underrated reputation. While the entire film presents a profusion of imagery worthy of classical painting, it's the second part, for me anyway, wherein the heart of DIE NIBELUNGEN lies. One of the most moving scenes in any film ever made is in KRIEMHILD'S REVENGE where Siegfried's (Paul Richter) grieving widow (Margerete Schon) leaves home and stops enroute at the stream where her husband was murdered. She dismounts her horse and tells her escort to remain back as she, alone, walks over to the water's edge. She kneels down and with her bare hands digs through the snow and earth bringing up a handful of dirt upon which her husband's blood was spilled, and she swears an oath that his murderer's blood will drench the same soil. The poignant beauty of this scene, surrounded in snow and birch trees, combined with the intensity in Kriemhild's face as she makes her vow, creates a poetic moment upon which rests all that follows. Indeed, this scene is recalled to our mind twice: first, when Kriemhild bears a son to Attila the Hun (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) and she takes the cloth containing the holy soil to her bosom; then at the end when she unfurls the cloth, spilling its contents upon the slain Hagen (Hans Adalbert Schlettow), her huband's murderer, thus fulfilling her oath. It's the cornerstone upon which the entire story is built.

Maturely told, DIE NIBELUNGEN proves that a film doesn't need spoken dialogue to be great. The musical score on this edition is the original 1924 composition by Gottfried Huppertz, and it amply provides the appropriate degree of power and passion. Very much in the spirit of a grand opera, DIE NIBELUNGEN belongs in the collection of every serious classic film lover.

Extras include a feature length documentary on the making and restoration of the film, as well as newsreel footage of Fritz Lang directing on the set.

Instead, I mention differences between this and Kinko's previous edition, which I also own. Visually, this new edition is clearly superior. Too, it jettisons a couple redundant alternate takes which the first edition tacked on for some odd reason. The take chosen for Kriemhild's Revenge's very end subtly yet profoundly differs from the prior edition. For me the music track is a bit of a mixed blessing, which is why I removed a star. I like that music was written to expand the original score, adding welcome variety. That said I don't feel the addedl music quite equals the original's quality. (I remind folk that these are two of too few silent films for which large portions of their specially composed original music scores survive.) My problem is not with the score itself but rather with its recording, which I feel sometimes lacks the presence and impact of its predecessor.

8533850,5,B00917IPSW,"The film was better than I expected, although, as others have commented, it cannot be what premiered in 1925 due to parts of it being lost. That being said, Kino's version is the closest we'll probably ever get to this monumental, epic film from Fritz Lang. The prodigious efforts of the restorers have achieved wonders ensuring this important film from the 'silent' cinema survives into the future. I would have liked some improvements: the scratched images from archives could have been tidied up a little digitally, reportedly that is possible these days; and other versions have tinting apart from orange which should have been retained, such as blue for night shots and red for fire (assuming, of course, that was how Lang wanted it). The accompanying documentary on the production and restoration of the film is excellent. One of the discs' (there's two) best features is a new recording of the original orchestral score, which researchers reportedly found amongst the composer's private papers, that is timed to the images. A 1990s VHS issue of 'Die Nibelungen' plonked Tchaikovsky onto the soundtrack, would you believe? A word of advice for Amazon: this is exclusively a Region A Blu-ray issue, a piece of information that should have more prominence in your on-line frame (at the time of my order the relevant Region was vague), especially for Region B purchasers like me. What did I do? I had to go out and buy a Region A-compatible player in order to see the film, a little drastic I know but it does allow me the opportunity to see more of Kino's Region A 'silent' film offerings, and I might add that they should be all-Region. To conclude, anyone interested in the cinema's past should see this film. The reliable Leonard Maltin rated it four stars and declared it 'A must-see.' 'Die Nibelungen' has its critics, of course, then and now, but they cannot deny it looms large in the history of the cinema, especially the 1920s powerhouse German cinema, and this Kino release more than ninety years after its premire provides the best opportunity today to appreciate it ---- assuming you have almost five hours to spare, for that is how long the two parts of the film play.",1498435200,,2185,4.8293333333333335

8533852,5,B00917IPSW,"This is what Blu-Ray was always intended to be.  As complete a restoration of a silent film as currently possible.  The original prints cleaned up, sharpened and honed to play on digital screens.  And the grain in the film compensated for as much as is technically possible.  Not every shot is perfection; but every frame has been worked on to be the best that can be had.
This is not the movie shown in the theatres at the time.  That movie, as currently known of, does not exist.  But it has been faithfully restored to as close to the original as possible.  That is why, even at clocking it at around five hours, there are moments in the film when the narrative seems a bit rushed.  Certain scenes are missing, but you can readily ascertain what is going on.  I only wish Kino put as much labour into all of its BR releases as it does in this Fritz Lang film.
It is basically a retelling of the classic myths that comprised the Germanic legends.  Much as each country has in its legends from of old.  It is interesting how these stories go into forming a sort of narrative that is both different, yet vaguely familiar to one's mind.  Just as King Arthur and the knights of the round table form the English version, so think of this as a German version of those kind of tales.  Betrayal, vengeance, love: they are all here.  If you are an enthusiast of silent film, if you enjoy the knights and the legends of magic and love surrounding them, you shall enjoy these two films, which comprise a part 1 and 2 of the epic Lang is telling.
And I believe many shall enjoy the fire-breathing dragon which Lang constructed to further his story.  Not your dragon of today, but still monumental for its time; and that's real fire it is breathing.  Think of a small tank with a flame thrower.  No animals were harmed in the making of this film.  Stunt men, actors, extras--well, I cannot with authority speak for.

One last thing.  If I were the Lang estate, I would have lawyers on hold.  Once they see this movie, I am almost positive The JRR Tolkien estate and that other person who wrote Harry Potter shall certainly sue for copyright infringement! :)
