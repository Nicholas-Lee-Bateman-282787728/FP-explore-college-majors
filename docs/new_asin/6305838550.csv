7896882,1,6305838550,I was charged 30.00 for a 15.00 DVD.  When it arrived only half of it played and then it quit! Very unhappy with both issues!,1484697600,,125,4.0

7896885,4,6305838550,"If you're familiar with Nigel Kennedy you know that he's unorthodox to say the least.  This presentation is typical of Nigel ... doing a great classical composition in a truly unique fashion.  There's a different lighting scheme for each movement representing the individual seasons.  I really got a kick out of the intense yellow light and the sunglasses during the summer movement.  Nigel does intros to each movement giving a little commentary on Vivaldi's approach in composing them.  The only thing I didn't like about this video is the video quality itself.  Taped in 1992, it's a bit inferior by today's standards.  Coupled with the fact that this is only available on VHS so you don't have access to the sharp digital quality of DVD and you have a mediocre viewing experience.  Audio is good, and the performance is equally good.  If you like Nigel Kennedy you'll probably want this video.  If you want a more traditional video of The Four Seasons I'd recommend Ann-Sophie Mutter and Karajan's DVD performance.",1083196800,3,1018,4.935294117647059

the bad boy plays really amazing keeps the public in awe and wanting more.
if you liked this one check Nigel Kennedy's Brahms concerto for violin # 1 (another that's hard to get).
keep on rockin'",1051833600,,367,4.492537313432836
7896887,5,6305838550,"I listened to this in my car, so I can't comment about the visuals. But I will say that the sound is very clear and open. Also, I personally enjoyed the performance, and I'm quite picky about the 4 seasons (love Trevor Pinnock/English Concert, didn't much care for Parrot/Taverner players if that helps)",1026864000,4,303,4.735849056603773
7896888,4,6305838550,"When I first saw these music DVDs advertised I was bit worried about there not being any views of the orchestra playing - only pictures of scenes around Europe. Personally I like to SEE the orchestra playing because that  is the nearest one can get to actually being at the performance. However, I  was very surprised and pleased to see how well Naxos have done these DVDs.  The picture quality is absolutely superb and is as pin sharp as one can get  with the NTSC 525 line system. I'd love to see them if they are ever issued  in the European PAL system with their higher resolution of 625 lines!  The  colours are brilliant, clean and natural.
The sound is available in Dolby  5.1 and DTS and plain ol' stereo even though the stereo option is not  mentioned on the cover. What I found nice was that I could change from 5.1  to DTS while the music was playing instead of having to stop the disk. Of  interest to me was that the data rate when playing Dolby 5.1 was 448 kbps  but in DTS the rate went up to 1,509 kbps - an increase of three times.  This was definately noticeable in the playback quality where there the  sound was crisper and cleaner. The cover states that the audio is  remastered in Dolby Digital and DTS. What it doesn't say is what it's  remastered FROM. This concerns me because unless the original recordings  were made in Dolby Surround, how can one ever produce six channel surround  from two channel stereo unless the original was  multi-track  recording?
Now to the minus points! The cover states ""Features E-Z  Menu system for the most accessable navigation."" Personally I think  they should have called it Diff-ee-kult Menu System - because easy it is  NOT until one gets used to it! On the cover, the tracks each have a number.  On the disk they do NOT!  The DVD player only ever indicates a  ""1"" with the result that it's impossible to know which track is  playing without stopping the disk. Another irritating thing is that the  play time of a track can ONLY count up and not down. No totalising of the  disk is allowed with the result that one can't see how much time is left or  how much has been played. This may seem trivial, but I found it to be  annoying as I like to see how much time is left when playing a track. The  running time on the cover is 56 minutes and not the 85 minutes as stated by  Amazon.com. What would also have been nice is for the title of the musical  item being played to be displayed in small leters at the bottom of the  screen as well as the location of the scene. The only way one can find out  where the scene being shown is, is to go to ""Menu"" when the track  changes to the next one and click on Travel Notes. The track being played  is automatically highlighted.
This Vivaldi disk is excellent. I've never  been terribly keen on Vivaldi's Four Seasons, but this recording in DTS is  excellent and is the first time I have ever really enjoyed this work. If I  were to criticise the sound, it would be that there is perhaps a bit too  much echo which gives the impression of being in a large hall. The scenes  are mainly from around Italy and Switzerland are beautifully photographed.  For example, on track eight there are a couple of lovely views taken from  high up on a hillside looking down on the early morning mist filling the  valley below, with the tops of the trees poking through the mist. On  another track there are several exquisite scenes of the Chianti region in  Tuscany.",962582400,,3456,4.3769716088328074
