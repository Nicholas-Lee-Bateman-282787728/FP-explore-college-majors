1339981,3,B00004CM14,"This is one of the few films made about occupied Germany just after the unconditional surrender to the allies.  One German, now living in Australia, told me some years back that the de-nazification process never really expunged what he called the German sickness of nazism, and that former Third Reich Nazis still enjoyed influential and high positions in modern German society.  The neo-Nazis movement has now spread beyond Germany throughout Europe and beyond.  James Best is better known as a character actor in the television shows of the fifties and sixties.  He does a superb job as the lead in this movie.",1393027200,3,612,4.970588235294118
1339982,4,B00004CM14,"Tonight's picture was ""Verboten!"" and it was great. This is a lesser known Sam Fuller picture from 1959 and it was the last RKO movie. The setting and situation are really interesting. The setting is an unamed German city at the very end of WW2 and after the surrender. The streets are Nazi apocalypse in style. The sets are awesome. An American is shot by a desperate Nazi and nursed back to health by a German woman who wants to prove to him that not all Germans were Nazis even though her younger brother was Hitler Youth. The American falls in love, marries her and gets a new job with the American military government. Things go bad when the Werwolf start committing terrorist acts to undermine the Americans and see Nazism rise again. The entire thing is classic Fuller- sweaty hyper emotionalism, twisted politics, the ever present hooker with a shaved head and stock footage. The Nuremberg trial scene which confronts the Germans and the viewer with real Nazi atrocities is over the top and incredible. Recommended.",1391126400,5,1023,4.785310734463277
1339983,5,B00004CM14,"I saw Verboten, Samuel Fuller film at age of a young boy at 10 years old in 1958 and never really knew at the time a lot about World War II or yet seen a film about the wartime. It open my eyes to war and it show me the cost of war on both sides, but what stay on my mind was the wartime archives films of the concentration camps like Buchenwald and Auschwitz used in film which never left my mind to this day. Great little film from the 1950's which is worth watching and well told.",1389398400,5,483,3.888888888888889
1339984,5,B00004CM14,"For those of you who love war films and for those of you who love love stories, this picture is for you! Susan Cummings (as Helga)is clearly the standout. I have no idea why she wasn't a great film star after this movie. She plays her part with beauty and strength. James Best is good as the love-struck soldier caught between love for country and love for Helga. A true classic and a must-see film!",1364774400,3,399,4.333333333333333
1339985,4,B00004CM14,"Director Sam Fuller's mix of violence and sentiment works well in this set-in-Germany love story between an American soldier and a German woman. After the Second World War, hunger breeds a neo-Nazi gang of teens who attempt to overthrow American occupation forces with the lovers caught in in the middle. Powerful and exciting, the move is shown in it's proper 1:85 ratio. Well worth seeing for Fuller fans.  .",1356739200,2,410,4.942028985507246
1339986,4,B00004CM14,"James Best plays the last soldier left in a German villiage raided by Allied Forces during World War II.  He is wounded and nursed to health by a native (Susan Cummings) whose brother is still loyal to a local Nazi group.  The couple falls in love and wants to get married, but it is forbidden by Best's commanding officer.  Including some gritty footage of Nazi death camps and a daring rescue by Best of his girlfriend's brother from a burning train, this is one of Samuel Fuller's most underrated films.  It was produced after RKO Radio Pictures had closed in 1956, sold to Desi Arnaz and General Tire and Rubber Company.  There's an unforgettable opening scene, a shootout to the tune of Bethoven's 5th Symphony.",1272412800,9,716,4.696
