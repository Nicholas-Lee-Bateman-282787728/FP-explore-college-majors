616392,5,6303283845,It is a shame that they would cancel a show that was just getting off the ground. I was wondering what happened to it. The guy was such a good actor for the part. Sometimes they won't give a show a chance.,1253491200,,205,3.9047619047619047

The Blind gunman Canaan shows justice isn't so blind. It's one of those classic style movies that you can watch over and over - the final church show down is excellent - bad guys get theirs in the end! Action, humor, drama, shoot 'em ups are all there. Great casting, one of Assante's intriguing characters, Adam Baldwin suits his part well, Davi is the perfect outlaw thug, although Elizabeth Shue could have put more depth to her role.",1240012800,,580,6.0

616397,5,6303283845,"I used to watch this show every week religiously. And just when I was starting to care about all of the charactors including the 'jerks' it gets cancelled. Basically the show is about a cop, Ron Eldard, who loses his sight (in the line of duty i think but this was on TV the last time I saw it), and the repercutions he has when he comes back to work.

How people aren't sure he can do his job anymore and so he gets partnered with a female cop, who gets just as much guff as he does which i couldn't figure out except for the fact that she's a woman and the writers were somewhat unimaginitive? All the same, great, great, show. RIP Blind Justice. I think I even saw it on one of the top lists of shows that were cancelled to soon.",1188086400,11,732,4.048275862068966
616398,3,6303283845,"I have had this title on LD for years, but when it was available on DVD, decided to get it. It is unique in the content and I did like the soundtrack, it was unusual. There'I've Said a lot without giving too much away. Regards' Dewarren.",1163116800,,237,4.173913043478261
616399,4,6303283845,"Borrowing freely from westerns traditional and Italian, as well as from the Japanese Zatoichi series (blind swordfighter/masseur), BLIND JUSTICE works much better, and is a lot more enjoyable, than a mere plot description would indicate.

 Armand Assante plays Canaan, a man blinded in Civil War.  We see him first dressed in a black duster and wearing thick smoked glasses, walking across the desert with an infant bundled in his arms.  Three Mexican banditos approach, whooping and hollering and firing their guns in the air.  Canaan is dust, and if he manages to get out of this scrape he crawls into myth.

  Although we're led to believe that Canaan retains some sight, his condition seems to have enhanced his other senses to a remarkable degree.  Enough so that he's able to hear a scorpion walking across a hitching post from twenty feet and shoot it without touching the hand it was about to crawl onto.

  The plot demands all of his super acute faculties.  Canaan finds himself in a town under siege.  A decimated U.S. Calvary unit is holed up in the local church, sitting on a wagon full of silver and threatened by the dreaded bandit king Alacran (Robert Davi) and his merciless minions.  Oh, yeah, and there's that nurse Caroline (Elizabeth Shue) that he's got to kind of fall for, too.

  Assante is a great actor, and makes his incredible character believable.  The action is well choreographed and fast paced, save for a few flashblacks strategically thrown in to fill in Canaan's back story.  I'm not sure we need to know how or why Canaan was blinded, but we find out anyway.

  BLIND JUSTICE is compelling and an ingenious western.",1096675200,6,1651,4.797153024911032
616400,4,6303283845,"The plot of this 1994 HBO movie is fairly simple with a sprinkling of more complex sub-plots, but essentially this movie is about a blind man (played by Armand Assante) on a quest. This western works very well with the exception of one mediocre performance in the female role, but very few [if any] of us watch westerns for the love interest. The strength of this movie is in  Assante's excellent performance, as well as the universal appeal this movie will have across the board for fans of traditional American westerns and European [spaghetti] westerns alike. The director seems to borrow heavily from earlier ideas of Corbucci, Garrone and Colizzi, with a healthy measure of John Ford and Howard Hawks influence combined, to create a unique film in the western genre.  I have no idea what HBO intended when they funded this film, but in a 2003 era of Dungeons and Dragons and a post-democratic society a little grit, guns and gore goes a long way! Highly recommend.",1059696000,5,969,4.761904761904762
616401,4,6303283845,"Although derivative of many Oriental films, this short little western still packs a punch.
Assante is a nearly blind gunfighter traveling with a baby. He is looking for the baby's mother, asking everyone he finds about the town she is supposed to be in. He stops in one town where a group of soldiers is guarding a shipment of silver, which is being eyed by the local banditos. The soldiers, trapped, send Assante out for help. All hell breaks loose.
Assante is very good as the embittered gunfighter (and often very funny). His blindness never becomes gimmicky, although one has to wonder how he can ride a horse. He uses his hearing and sense of smell to shoot, how does he know in which direction the horse is going? Adam Baldwin, as the soldier's sergeant, is great, as he distances himself even further from the Baldwin brothers (no, he is not one of them, he can act). Robert Davi has his best role since ""Licence to Kill"" as the main villain. The one cast liability here is Oscar nominee Elisabeth Shue.
Shue delivers all of her lines in a flat monotonal vaguely-Valley Girl accent. She should be banned from doing any period films ever again. She has one embarassing nude scene, if you can call it that. At one point, she is sitting on a bed in her corset, and you can see part of her nipple mashed up out of her undergarment. It does not look erotic, it looks painful. Assante and Shue's forced romance is also the weakest part of the script.
One scene to watch for is in the climax as a major character is blown through the doors of a building. I rewound that three times just to bask in an action shot I had never seen before.
This feels like the first film of a proposed series that never came to fruition, and with an 85 minute running time, you have to wonder what they cut out. However, I do recommend ""Blind Justice.""
This is rated (R) for physical violence, strong gun violence, some sexual violence, some gore, profanity, very brief female nudity, and some adult situations.",1022112000,9,1992,4.505524861878453

616484,3,6303283845,A good movie to watch during those veg-out nights. Didn't like the ending though. It felt like it left one hanging.,1354492800,,115,4.523809523809524
616485,5,6303283845,I found this movie so entertaining I purchased it. Assante brings this character to life with a good script of wit and humor.  He is on a mission; determined to find a baby's mother entrusted in his care. His blindness is not a disability but merely allows him to develop different abilities. I could not leave my seat and after purchasing I continually paused to enjoy other aspects of the film as well. This is not for family night and is geared to a mature audience but well done nonetheless. ~j,1351382400,,498,4.472527472527473
616486,5,6303283845,this movie is a great one the main guy is a blind guy.  the blind guy is played by Armand Assante (Judge Dredd).  the blind guy shoots better then all of the other guys that can hear.  and nails the enemy on there own territory.,1351123200,,228,4.022222222222222

616490,4,6303283845,"Give Assante some credit for versatility, maybe even for guts. I can't imagine how this read as a script but he found enough to work with that made for an unusual film; I am assuming it was a HBO vehicle or some form of TVM, it had that smaller budget feel to it. Oddly enough, and probably for many actors, a small budget is a burden that they can't overcome as it means their every movement, gesture, line of dialogue has to ring true or the viewer is left with nothing to grab onto for interest in the characters or the storyline (ie. no clever editing, cinematography, location, secondary story/characters etc).

Small budget, big budget, glitzy storyline, skewed storyline, high adventure, gritty cop thriller, whatever, it doesn't matter with Assante, he treats every script that he does (okay, leave out Dead Lenny, which is the only time I will ever say that title again on pain of death) with a sureness and freshness that can be scary. I don't know what it is, except he also makes most of his co-actors better, makes even a peculiar part unexpected and pretty much a director can strip out everything else because they know Assante will just carry the film on his own.

I agree with the other reviewer that the female lead (Elisabeth Shue) was a poor choice, not sure what film she was in but it wasn't this one. I find that a puzzle, as Assante tends to make any female lead just sparkle, there is always a certain zest to the pairings. The only other film I can think of where the female lead just falls flat with him is the Passion and Paradise film, in both cases the common denominator was a too ""young"" actress/character who simply lacks maturity to be an compatible foil for his characters.

Rather than give  away the plot twists in this film - which would be a crime in any film that is going off the reservation as this one does with the ""western"" genre - I would recommend that you watch it with a eye on how Assante pulls off this unusual character; he is just fun to watch, a consummate professional. You can still wonder at some of the inconsistencies in the storyline and not really suffer from them; heck, it is a character study showpiece for Assante, which in tribute to him is probably what he can bring to any part he does.",1302048000,,2254,4.463592233009709
616491,5,6303283845,"This was such an awesome show - and when I see other shows that are put on DVD and not this one, it makes me wonder what's up.  Please release it on DVD.

7842551,5,6303283845,"This is one of my favorite programs.  Ron Eldard was excellent as Jim Dunbar, the detective who had to learn how to adjust, both on and off the job, with being blind.  And the rest of the cast was great, too, from his wife, who also had to learn how to adjust, to his fellow detectives, who lad to learn to treat him as a person and as a fellow detective.

7842556,5,6303283845,I'm sad that this show did not do better.  It definately had a unique concept.  Ron Eldard does a magnificant job playing a blind detective and you see his character grow a lot in the few episodes they got to work with.  We also get to see his relationship with his wife and coworkers mature.  You just have to love his relationshipe with his dog. It is a great show and I just wish it had been on longer than the short one season.,1413072000,,431,4.095238095238095

7842558,5,6303283845,"If you like westersn, and even if you dont, this is the film for you. Clint Eastwood badassery at its finest. assante makes a bgrade HBO special into a seminal western which also stars Elisabeth Shue and Adam Baldwin.

7842559,4,6303283845,"I remember seeing this movie as a kid and loving it when it was on HBO back in the mid 90s.  I had only seen it one time and I recently decided to purchase a dvd copy and give it another viewing.

So after ordering it online, waiting a few days and receiving the package, I popped it in the old dvd player, fired it up, picked up the popcorn and got started(This whole sentence was unnecessary, but eh).

The plot is centered around Armand Assante playing an ex civil war soldier, now blind wandering the west much like David Carridine in kung fu.  Yeah, thats right, he's BLIND.  I think once you get past the part, you're ready for some kickass time.

Early on in the movie you see scenes of his amazing abilities despite his blindness.  Early on, he encounters some thugs, but uses his ""spidy"" sense to outduel them and move on.  Its almost as though he developed a 6th sense after his blindness; I wonder if he ever touches the stove when its hot.

I don't remember exactly what the plot was, but theres a few shootouts, a robbery, a treasure chest and other similar western things, done in a fun way so you'll be pleased through the movie.  Jack Black also makes an appearance in an early film role for him.

While this movie is not considered a classic, I consider it a basic cable classic and a movie that will definitely come up if you go to google and type ""western blind guy"", this will be that movie.",1386633600,,1411,4.306818181818182
