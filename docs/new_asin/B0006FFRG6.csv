8041260,5,B0006FFRG6,"This is great fun. Be prepared for a very dark, gritty experience. This pays tribute to the Ken Ishikawa vision. These heroes are not nice people. They are vicious men who are brutal enough to endure the Getter rays that power their machines.",1423008000,,242,4.651162790697675

8041262,5,B0006FFRG6,"I had to type this again cause, I accidentally deleted my original post of this review. Anyway I really liked this updated version, of the classic giant robot anime Change Getter Robo. Only this time around they're fighting Oni, instead of the Mechasaurus Empire. But leave it to good old, Go Nagai to keep up the level of ultraviolence. As seen in previous titles Getter Robo Armageddon, Shin Getter Robo vs Neo Getter Robo, Mazinkaiser and Mazinkaiser SKL.But it's still highly enjoyable none the less!",1376956800,,504,4.9411764705882355
8041263,5,B0006FFRG6,"As a fan of the original Manga and shows (Getter Robo, Getter Robo G, Getter Robo Go, and yes even Armageddon) This one is the best of them all. In the original show the enemy was Evolved Dinosaurs, in this one it goes back to the Manga and they are fighting Demons (The Oni). The Robo's are updates of the originals that look fantastic, the characters are back to the extremes they were in the books. Ryoma is an unbeatable street fighter, Jin Hyato is a downright psychotic murderer. The only diversion to the team is that Benkei is the pilot of getter 3 instead of Musashi. As usual the storyline is bizarre, but it wouldn't be Go Nagai's show if it wasn't a little nutz. The Animation is great, almost as good as Armageddon but I like the style of the new show better. As with all Getter DVD's, go with Japanese audio and subs. The english dub is good, but the subs usually (especially armageddon) explain the stories much better, and the Japanese voices are over the top, which I love. Some of the voices in the dubs a painful in this one, so save it for re-viewing. Awesome show, if you are a Robot fan that you MUST see this, you are missing out if you don't. The anime is also a great drinking game, every time they say Getter down a swig, you won't make it to the 2nd episode.",1140566400,3,1285,4.270491803278689
8041264,5,B0006FFRG6,"Wicked violence, blood everywhere, severed limbs - this isn't your grandpa's old colorful Getter Robo show. In fact, New Getter Robo is actually closer to how Getter was originally intended to be: Although the classic 70's anime adaptation (continued with Getter Robo G, which many know here as Force Five's Starvengers) was toned down for kids, the original Getter Robo comic book was full of gore and graphic violence. Although New Getter Robo dumps the old Reptilian Empire in favor of the creepier Oni, it brings back the dark, violent feel of the original comic, even bringing back some classic moments that never made it into anime form before. However, it's packed with plenty of new material, making it a fresh experience for hardcore Getter fans and newcomers alike.

Although there's not much in the way of immediate character development in this volume and the cast is pretty basic at heart, the characters are brimming with personality and are lot of fun to watch. This goes double for Hayato Jin, destined to become the second Getter pilot: Originally a terrorist (or ""revolutionary"", as he calls himself) and the brains of his little organization, he won't hesitate to break his normally cool exterior with his psychotic, ultra-violent side when it comes to it - even brutally killing a fellow member of his that chickens out and tries to run away. Watching this side bubble out is quite a sight.

This volume is mostly introduction - each of the first three episodes covering one of the three Getter pilots and the fourth about their struggle to put up with each other and work as a team. Whether you're looking for exciting bloody violence, energetic and downright cool robot fights, or some rough and tough characters like they don't make anymore, this is well worth a look.",1117756800,,1791,4.8881578947368425
8041265,3,B0006FFRG6,"I have been following the Getter Robo franchise in the U.S. since its release as The Starvengers in the early 80's as a segment of Force Five.  I've always been a fan of The Starvengers, even though it was a bit campy, and was extremely pleased with the Getter Robo Armageddon series released by ADV Films.  On that note, I found myself less than satisfied with the first installment of the New Getter Robo series.  The mecha designs were very interesting, but the overall story and character development was somewhat lacking.  I really want to like the series, and will probably give it a second shot, but if you are looking for the same storay quality that was present in Getter Robo Armageddon, you might be disappointed.",1111363200,3,724,4.677165354330708
8041266,5,B0006FFRG6,"It is a wonderful seires, the first 4 episodes are really cool.

This is basiclly it for those who know the Getter Robo for the first time,it is a vailoent Giant Robot fighting Alieans searies, this one with the series Box, it is a nice good looking box that you get to put all 4 DVD in it when they are all released by Sep 2005, I am a collector, so I hade to get it.

It also came with a bandana,so I think it is worth the extra $10 over the reguler edition.

Now, for those of us who know the Getter Robo:

This show takes you back as a redo to the very first Getter Robo made in the late 70's,not the one that we knew in the US as Starvengers,no, this one is even for the one before it, it starts with how thw 3 pilots know each other and piloted the Getter Robo.

I really love it as much as I loved the Starvengers, a.k.a Getter Robo G, But I think GoNagai should do a modern version of Grandizer too, he already did Mazinger as Mazinkaizer, Starvengers was was redone 3 times now, Shin Getter Robo in 1999, Neo Getter VS Shin Getter 2001,and now the new Shin Getter. He has also redone Devilman in 1994, it is about time we see a modern versionof Grandizer.",1110758400,5,1164,4.043478260869565
