5014772,2,B006RH3QQ0,"I like to do the step aerobics on the EA More Active Wii video, but was getting a little tired of the same routine.  This sounded like a good alternative, but I was wrong.  I guess I am too old to do this one.  I could not follow Kathy and after the low level session I felt like I was about to die.",1343692800,,299,3.7142857142857144
5014773,3,B006RH3QQ0,"For the first time ordering from Amazon.com I am disappointed! The way this is advertised makes it sound like it is a NEW Step routine by Kathy Smith; now I have ordered the same DVD I have had for YEARS! I was looking for a fresh, new DVD routine by Kathy Smith! Amamzon needs to make it clear that they are repackaging OLD DVDS!",1340236800,8,330,4.171875
5014774,5,B006RH3QQ0,"this is a good step aerobics workout did not find it hard to follow, enjoy it very much.  would recommonded it to beginner.",1337558400,75,123,4.3478260869565215
5014775,2,B006RH3QQ0,"I thought that it was a walking DVD, but it is an old tape changed to DVD with a new cover.  I'm taking it to McKay's thurday to sell it.  Requires a $40.00 step device. Boo",1335225600,2,173,3.7777777777777777
5014776,3,B006RH3QQ0,I also must have missed where the description said this is a recycled routine from the past. The picture on the front made me think this was an updated workout. I was really disappointed when I saw that they basically just re-released an old video.,1333152000,,248,4.533333333333333
5014777,5,B006RH3QQ0,This is a great workout. This workout really does the job and you can work your way up to the full 35 minutes. Kathy is very carefull with the moves so you don't get hurt but still gives you a heck of a workout.,1332892800,47,211,3.8181818181818183
5014778,3,B006RH3QQ0,"I didn't realize I was getting a recycled 90's step routine.  Of course, it's a great Kathy Smith workout, & I had been looking for an updated step workout, as my old ones are on VHS & I can't use them anymore.  I got the 2 DVDs from the new ""ageless"" series, and like them a lot.  So I thought this was going to be in the same category - an updated Kathy Smith step workout which have been so effective in the past, but updated to incorporate new training techniques.  Nope, an old 90's workout, complete with bad leotards & guys in short shorts.  And the body sculpting and conditioning routines are outdated.  Sorry Kathy - love your workouts, but I think it would be better if you took your ""favorite and most effective workouts from the past"" and brought them to the new millennium.",1332720000,135,787,4.3561643835616435
5014779,2,B006RH3QQ0,"Not a huge fan of this DVD. The case photo makes it look like its an updated type workout, yet the actual video is straight out of the 80s. I don't like how Kathy instructs either. Also definitely not a ""beginner"" step workout, as its very fast paced with lots of move changes with little to no warning and long sequences.",1519344000,,322,4.295081967213115
5014780,5,B006RH3QQ0,Ive had this DVD for years and I used to do it daily in college. Ive added 3lb hand weights and after 20yrs its still a great workout!,1518393600,,134,3.8214285714285716
5014781,5,B006RH3QQ0,It is a great DVD. I read a prior review that explained how useful the DVD is and found all of it to be true. Have used the DVD a lot and keep finding helpful things in it. Also not boring at all. Good workout in a short period of time.,1518220800,,236,3.6470588235294117

5014783,3,B006RH3QQ0,"I like excercise dvd that comes with good warm up and good pace like this older program. U can skip the part that u don't want to do. In this step workout, I don't like the upper body and abdominal parts. Kathy tried to incorporate the step (which is not compact size like mine) for everything. The cooling down is continued with lower body part so u cant do it the other way around. Otherwise it wouldve make a good cardio excercise.",1517443200,,434,4.304878048780488

After going through this dvd I really feel like I've had an effective, calorie burning, strengthening workout.  I would like to find something similar to this but more modern, but haven't found one yet.",1513814400,,285,4.816326530612245

5014794,1,B006RH3QQ0,"This workout is for those new to step, not for people who have done step workouts before. The cardio is broken into segments, during which she teaches variations on basic moves in step aerobics. So there are no real routines. I got through the warm up and first segment, then fast forwarded to the end, which was just as disappointing.

This was a waste of time and money.",1509494400,2,372,4.470588235294118

There are 3 levels to this and I am glad to see that I am able to get this on DVD. Kathy explains things and I love the room where they do the aerobics.  I love the windows in the room",1508371200,,331,3.7

5014807,1,B006RH3QQ0,"I love Kathy Smith and have exercised to almost all her tapes/DVDs.  I happen to have this DVD on a VHS tape, but decided to upgrade, and that's the reason I bought this.  I only paid $6 plus change, so when I got it, I was undecided if I should return it due to the voice skipping out periodically.  It was disconcerting to hear the voice skip periodically every 10 - 15 seconds, sometimes it would go for a minute without skipping, and then it would do it over again.  When I contacted Amazon to let them know, the agent was kind enough to replace it and sent me a postage paid label to return the defective one.  Well, the same thing happened with this DVD.  I now realize it wasn't an anomaly;  these particular Kathy Smith  DVD's are defective.  I'm not going to return it.  It's a hassle, and to be credited for the $6 and change is not worth it.  I'll just continue exercising with my VHS tape.",1502323200,,901,4.241176470588235
5014808,3,B006RH3QQ0,It's ok.  She doesn't show you what the next moves are so when you finally get it she's onto the next move. It's a pretty good workout when I am tired of doing my other ones.,1501891200,,174,3.8333333333333335

5014815,5,B006RH3QQ0,"Kathy never disappoints with her timeless collection, the setting is great, the workout is great, you can't go wrong. You can adjust the step height to make it easier or harder. I love that I can focus on the exercise and not worry about what dancy move we are doing next. I'm very active, working out 6 days a week for at least an hour on programs like Cathe Friedrich, Chalene Extreme, The Firm, and many others.

That would be fine if that's what you were expecting, but is pretty surprising if you are expecting something from 2012. It's also not for beginners, she goes from move to move way too fast with little or no explanation. I got lost during the warm up and felt behind the whole time until I finally just gave up.",1492387200,4,384,4.273972602739726

5014827,2,B006RH3QQ0,"This is NOT for ""beginners"". She goes too quickly from one step routine to another, so by the time I figured out what she was doing, she was on to something else! I hate to say it, but I had a hard time just keeping up with the warmup!",1489449600,,235,3.816326530612245
5014828,5,B006RH3QQ0,This is a great entry level step DVD. I like the fact that she has warm ups and three levels of step training. You Can do all levels for an extreme work out or just pick and choose what you need.,1489449600,2,195,3.7804878048780486

5014831,4,B006RH3QQ0,"When I first got this video, my thought was:  ""Why don't they have a segment to teach you the steps --slow them down so you can learn them.""  The instructor goes so FAST.  I struggled for a week going through the warm up and the beginner's portion of the video.  Then I fast forward to the last segment, guess what.  There was the slowly given instructions on the way to do the steps.  Duh, why didn't they put this at the beginning of the video.  So now I fast forward to practice the steps and then go back to the beginning.  What were they thinking!!!!",1488931200,5,555,4.219047619047619
5014832,1,B006RH3QQ0,"Very awkward -especially the arm movements which are never explained. I highly enjoy step aerobics but this was just irritating and Kathy Smith speaks in a harsh way, not encouraging at all. She changes movements suddenly with poor timing so you can't get a good rhythm going. The background music makes me feel like I am in band camp in the 80s. Not fun or easy for he beginner and advanced/intermediate levels would not find it fun.",1487635200,2,434,4.64935064935065

The Buns & Thighs DVD was in perfect condition and played great.  The Step Aerobics Workout didn't fair so well.  The first and only time I tried to use it, it kept skipping, slowing down and freezing up.  I took it out of the player and noted that it had 3 small scratches on it.  I know I didn't put them there.  Today, I tried to fill out the form to have it replaced, but unfortunately, I needed to have returned it within 30 days.  Guess I'm out of luck, but it just doesn't seem right.  By the way,  the DVD is a good step video.  I only gave it 1 star because of it's condition.",1484611200,,708,3.9574468085106385

I was thrilled to find this on dvd and thanks to all the other reviewers that let me know this was the original one. As soon as I saw that, I had to have it. I used it tonight for the first time again, I am 63 years old now and I can still do it, yeah!!

I'm not sure but I think it may actually be from the 80's by the way they are dressed. Kathy gives great instructions and doesn't go too fast for this 58 year old Glama.

5014894,4,B006RH3QQ0,"This is a review of Kathy Smith Timeless: Step Aerobics Workout. I received a free sample for review.

Just to put this in perspective... DVD's were introduced around 1995. This workout predates the introduction of DVD's by 3 years. What we have here is a 1992 VHS step workout transported to 2016 but on DVD this time.

Once you get over the extremely dated hair styles, workout clothing and color schemes, you'll discover a rather decent step routine. You can do the entire routine or just skip to specific chapters to fit it into your limited schedule. However keep in mind that if you skip to a specific chapter you'll miss the warmup. Proper warmup is recommended before any workout.

This step workout is designated to be for Beginners and All Fitness Levels. I would say that if you are brand new to step aerobics routines, this might be a little too fast for you to follow. There is no introduction to the various steps... you learn as you go and I imagine outright beginners will be lost rather quickly or else be doing a lot of pause and play of the DVD during playback.

The music is not obtrusive and fits in quite well with the overall routine. It's background, as it should be.

Others have commented that the instructor is at times ""yelling"" and often out of breath while speaking. I don't get that impression at all. The instructor is efficient and this is an aerobic workout... anyone will be somewhat winded doing this and when you are in an aerobic condition, talking more than a few words at a time is difficult no matter your physical condition.

This is a good step aerobic workout. Yes, it is dated but I guess that's why this DVD is labeled  the ""timeless collection."" Just know what you're getting, that's all I'm suggesting.",1452470400,2,1750,4.589743589743589
5014895,5,B006RH3QQ0,"it will make you sweat, only a couple of workouts and you can switch them up by adding the upper body , abs or warm up exercises . The workout are pretty basic but I have just started and have trouble keeping up with these so I don't need fancy moves",1451347200,,250,3.9215686274509802
5014896,5,B006RH3QQ0,"Great workout!  Lots of level options for the workout that's needed.  Sometimes I'm up for a long, give it your all workout and sometimes I just have  15 minutes and that's better than nothing.  Make this your main workout or add it in to other workouts during the week to change it up a little and keep you motivated.",1449100800,5,318,4.338983050847458
5014897,5,B006RH3QQ0,Gives you really hard workout. Need to start slow and work yourself in to it.,1448236800,2,77,4.2
5014898,5,B006RH3QQ0,"I have had this workout for a very long time.  I still have my VHS tape of it -- a tape that is probably close to 15 years old now.  But, my VCR recently quit working.  Of all the exercise videos I had on VHS, this was one of the few I wanted to repurchase in DVD form.  And that is saying something.

So yes, first of all, you should know that this is an old (1990s) workout.  And you can tell by looking at it -- the hair styles, the colors, the outfits (including men in short and/or tight shorts), the music.

But, this is one of my favorite step workouts.  There are a few reasons:

(1) It's actually a long workout where you're moving the whole time (it is so hard to find good, long cardio workouts these days -- too many try to be ""timesavers"").

(2) It's suitable for beginners through advanced exercisers (Kathy offers some modifications to make things harder as well as easier, plus you have the option of increasing the step height to make it more difficult and/or stopping after one or two cardio segments (much more convenient, now that this is on DVD, by the way).  Even though I pretty much have it memorized, I was challenged the last time I did it because I tried it with a higher step after not stepping for awhile.

(3) The arms.  Seriously.  So many step DVDs have you repeating the same arm movements over and over while you do different things with your legs.  But there are actually a lot of different arm movements here.

(4) Actual water breaks between segments.  No need to pause anything.  Also, two heart rate checks and a perceived exertion check.  The heart rate checks may be less relevant in an era when heart rate monitors are more common.  But if you're low-tech, the option is there.  (Or just use the time to get water.)

(5) Choreography.  I can actually follow what Kathy is doing.  She builds up to things in my ideal way -- you learn one move at a time and build up to combinations.  But even when you are learning the early moves, you are still working.  (I am terrible at following choreography in exercise videos, in general...)  There are a couple of different routines in each segment of the DVD.  They're generally shorter routines, but that's fine with me.  I have gotten lost in more complicated routines from other instructors, but I can remember everything in these.

(6) Appropriate warm-up and cool down.  Neither feels rushed.

(7) Although it's old, the participants seem to be having fun and to know what they're doing.  You are not distracted by someone who can't keep time (which is something I've seen in pretty much all Tae Bo workouts and at least one semi-recent Denise Austin DVD).

(8) Production value.  Yes, it's dated.  But the music is at an appropriate volume so you can hear the instructor.  The backdrop is pretty basic and clean.  The camera work is such that you can always see what the participants are doing (no weird zooms or transitions).  Video quality is not astounding for modern equipment, but it gets the job done.

The strength/conditioning segment is pretty basic.  You do moves like biceps curls, triceps dips, leg lifts, etc.  It's not really new or innovative and if you have done more recent workouts, you will likely know more moves.  I tend to skip this segment and just do P90X strength DVDs on other days.  But, if you are new to strength training, you may find some benefit.  If you feel that you need more instruction than you get during the workout itself, there is a tutorial at the end.  I never even knew this existed because I would always rewind the VHS tape before I got to this part.  But I was fiddling around with the chapter menu on the DVD and saw it.  (Also, in DVD form, you can skip the silly skit at the beginning where the woman is looking for her step.)

Equipment needed:

*step (I recommend one of the longer adjustable ones, similar to what you see in the DVD -- these are a little pricey, but you don't have to modify the routine to use them)

*dumbbells if you're going to do the conditioning part (if you're just starting out, try 2 or 3, 5, and 8 as you may find that you can handle different amounts of weight for different exercises; if you're more advanced, feel free to move up -- I can do biceps curls with 15 and sometimes 20 pound weights)

*ankle weights (you'll have to stop the DVD to put them on but they can add some difficulty to the conditioning set)

*mat (for floor work)

Please note that you do not have to have any dumbbells or ankle weights, and you can skip the mat, if you plan to skip the conditioning section.  The step Kathy uses is a style that's pretty common so if you find you like step aerobics, you can use the same one for other workouts.

Overall, one of my favorite workouts and I'm glad to be able to do it again.",1447977600,104,4767,4.4036697247706424

Kathy's cuing could be better -- some moves are identified by name only (with no breakdowns ahead of time), some cues are late, some moves are not cued at all. Her form is also not the best so for form pointers, I would suggest following the folks on either side of her. This workout will make you sweat, and modifications (if needed) are pretty easy to make.

And when I got up to do something, he apparently noticed something because he told me what great legs I have;  I don't think it was his being in Irac too long.. must have been all that hard work doing these workouts..  ... excellent workout, and I don't care what the other reviewers say.

Who cares if this is an old routine?  If you like step, and want a sweat-bringing workout, this could be what you are looking for. (By the way, I am well into my 60s, so this brings back memories of step classes I took when I was younger)  I also like that it has 3 levels of step, warm-up and cool-down sections, and a toning section.",1389657600,4,512,4.183673469387755

5014979,5,B006RH3QQ0,I love the workout. Kathy Smith is easy to understand and although some of the routines confuse me she repeats the routines so you can get back on track. I also like the way the routine is broke down so you know which level to stop at and when to continue. Although I find Kathy Smith annoying at times I do love her workouts.,1377302400,3,326,4.109375

love step aerobics.  I needed somethng with no impact, and simple moves.  I also enjoy feeling like I am part of a 'class' without having to leave my home, esp. in the winter, but not all facilities are doing 'step' any more. I found what I wanted with Kathy Smith's 'Timeless-Step Aerobics Workout'. I was not put off by the music nor the 90s style workout wear.  The cues are well timed and unlike one other reviewer, I found hearing  her a little breathless reassuring!  I am sweating from every pore by the end,but not breathless or overly exhausted, and love the way my muscles 'feel it' the next couple of days.  It is now a regular part of my workout rotation. Only downside is when she passes off the cues to others in the class, but that only threw me the first time through.  Definitely worth the $.",1362182400,,886,4.398773006134969

This DVD is a great workout, but beware of the blast from the past...they are all geared up for a workout in the 90's (with scrunchies and big socks). I have to turn down the volume to barely perceptible so to not get annoyed by the dated music and I have to focus my eyes JUST on Kathy to avoid all the super-smiley cupie dolls in the background.

Finally, I found a begginers class that was more in my speed, only to have them cancel it after 9 months of me joining.
