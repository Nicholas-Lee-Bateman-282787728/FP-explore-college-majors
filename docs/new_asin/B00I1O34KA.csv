6247172,4,B00I1O34KA,"A movie that handles a delicate topic in American history very well. It doesn't present a biased point of view, but rather tries to show its effects from other points of view. I don't love it, but I would certainly recommend it.",1393632000,3,228,4.4523809523809526
6247173,5,B00I1O34KA,"difficult subject material.  With all the controversy lately that has brought this tragic situation back in the news, it gives a lay person who has no idea of active combat, an inside look of what went on over there.  I'm sure it was much worse, but this gives American's a glimpse of a soldiers perspective.  Thanks Luke Moran",1419724800,,327,4.603448275862069

The 43rd was not at Abu, we had a different mission. I was a medic. A good medic. I treated prisoners and friendlies.

6247179,4,B00I1O34KA,"This has been released in the UK as 'Prisoners of war' but I think `Boys of Abu Ghraib' - is a much better title. This has been written by Luke Moran who also directed it and in case you wonder what he looks like, he is also the star- so is it a vanity project? Not really it centres on Jack Farmer who goes off to the war in Iraq and gets assigned to the infamous Abu Ghraib where he works in the motor pool. He soon finds out that, apart from the mortar attacks, boredom is his main enemy and so volunteers to do guard duty in the gaol.

Once there he is introduced to some of the less wholesome methods of prisoner husbandry. Sleep deprivation, humiliation, stress positions and more. He then develops a friendship with one of the prisoners and soon he starts to look at his charges in a different light - what follows will have far reaching consequences.

This is actually quite a good film though it has attracted criticism for being a `white wash' of what actually took place - also no women soldiers are depicted. It is also an attempt to explain how the captors became torturers but at the same time only scratches the surface. Unless you were there you are probably not in a fully informed position to say. This though is based on actual events whilst remaining a work of fiction. As a film it is both interesting and engaging - there is not a lot of action here though so if you are looking for a war film then it might be one to avoid. If you like films that deal with the psychological effects of war then you will find a lot here to be of interest.",1408924800,3,1561,4.217391304347826

6247181,4,B00I1O34KA,"The film explores the brutality of an aspect of the Iraq War, and the resulting brutalization of an American soldier who is part of it.

6247182,1,B00I1O34KA,"This movie is a disgusting white-wash of the actual events of illegal torture, sexual abuse and perversions that happened at Abu Ghraib prison during the American occupation of Iraq.",1406505600,,182,5.310344827586207
6247183,5,B00I1O34KA,Very good movie about the ups and downs while serving in a war. I don't think it could have been told any better.,1398902400,,113,3.9565217391304346
6247184,4,B00I1O34KA,"This is a gritty war drama that utilizes Abu Ghraib and answers the question posed at the end, ""What kind of person could do this?""

Jack (Luke Moran) is the all American boy who volunteers to join the service. He is on a boring 6 month tour in the motor pool at Abu Ghraib. Bored with his job, he volunteers to help out the short handed MPs on the ""Hard Side."" Without any training, save for a quick tour by Sean Astin, Jack is now a fully functional guard of some the the world's most dangerous men.

Jack is initially appalled at the treatment of the prisoners. he is told ""You get used to it."" Jack's enthusiasm wanes as his tour gets extended, turning into the man he never thought he could be.

The film shows some of the torture at Abu Ghraib, but is mild compared to what has been described in the media. The humiliation and much of the torture is down played and can be considered justified to a sympathetic viewer attempting to understand the events. The Military Intelligence and contractors were only briefly mentioned and played no role.

For those you want to see a woman order naked men to make a pyramid or play leap frog will have to look elsewhere. This film treats the situation perhaps with more sympathy and dignity than it deserves, while at the same time giving us a gritty tale on how ""a person could do something like that.""

Worth a view for modern war fans,

6247185,5,B00I1O34KA,"What the hell are we sending these kids to these places for? The acting wasn't good, but it left me and I think others will see it too with equal points of view for and against torture. This is the main theme throughout the movie raising questions about the ethics of torture or enhanced interrogation techniques. However it's cleverly presenting a larger theme in that of the life of today's American soldier. I got to think most of these guys sign up because it's a career path it's a way to make money and get some training for a job. And especially in today's America where there is a dying economy no jobs and overpriced tuition I can't blame them for signing up for a war that they don't want to be involved in anyways. However soldiers are for the most part kids in the prime of their life, being asked to piss away those years in boredom and psychological time games. It's no surprise most of these guys come back and are screwed up in head and have to be on anti-depressants. I could live with that if these countries had an airforce, navy, or any way of threatening our way of life here. The real threat is a terrorist blowing off a nuke in a city in America, and honestly we'd be much better served putting these soldiers to work in this country monitoring stadiums, borders, and airplanes. We should invest in nuke-detecting drones that fly all over our country and get the soldiers out of these pointless ""wars""",1398470400,,1424,4.459770114942529
6247186,5,B00I1O34KA,"I really liked this movie. It felt like an honest and authentic look at what it must have been like to be a soldier placed in an impossible situation. I thought about the psychological tests that sure how good people in bad circumstances can make reprehensible choices. Where does moral responsibility lie? The story was cogent and compelling, the acting strong, and the ending in particular very powerful. Some of the scenes (in the prison) were difficult to watch, but I'm very glad that I saw it.",1396483200,5,499,4.747126436781609

6247188,5,B00I1O34KA,"I didn't know what to expect but I really enjoyed this movie.  It's been 10 years now since the Abu Ghraib prison photos came out.  Maybe this is the first treatment of it.  The movie is from only one perspective, that of a prison guard.  It seems authentic, not gung ho, and neither condemning or apologetic.  It makes you think and examine how you feel about the Iraq War and the realities of interrogation.",1396224000,,409,4.472972972972973
6247189,4,B00I1O34KA,"I liked this movie, I am always interested in movies like this. First, I am a retired correctional officer and second I had a nephew do two tours in Iraq so movies like this interest me. There was also a lot of controversy over these actions that took place at this prison so it was like getting a look at someone's viewpoint of what actually happened or what they say happened. I probably will watch it again.",1395792000,2,410,4.337662337662338
6247190,5,B00I1O34KA,I really liked the movie ... I recommend it ... it's a sad movie but it was part of the reality of what happened in Abu Ghraib ... things that should never happen again,1395014400,,168,3.9705882352941178
6247191,3,B00I1O34KA,"""I've gotten to know this guy, whatever he's in here for he did not do."" Jack Farmer (Moran) is a soldier on his first tour in Iraq. After a few months he becomes bored and applies to be an MP. He is assigned to the base in Abu Ghraib. He shows up as a wide eyed trusting soldier. After breaking the rules and talking to an inmate things begin to change, the rest is history. First of all the movie is a little slow moving but the fact that its a true story makes it that much more interesting and is enough to keep you watching. This is a movie where just about everyone knows how it will turn out but that only adds to the intrigue. While there isn't much action in this I will say some parts are very graphic and hard to watch. This doesn't show half of what we were told went on but that is a good thing. The thing I found most interesting was watching how Jack goes from a naive guard to part of the problem. While the story is important the movie doesn't do it justice. I really think the movie needs to be redone in a way that doesn't have a made for TV movie feel. To me the best part was the last 2 minutes. Overall, important but again the movie doesn't do the story justice. I give this a B-.",1394409600,3,1203,3.995850622406639
6247192,2,B00I1O34KA,"The writer-director-star of this film walks a fine line between white-washing the events and presenting a psychological exploration of what evolves when a perpetrator becomes a victim. He lost the opportunity of demonstrating how an ordinary morally good young man (or woman, which he doesn't even broach as there are no women soldiers in this film) can through indoctrination and boredom become the monsters he's supposed to be fighting. During the film he lightly hints at this and even nearly realizes this at the very end when he returns home after his tour and the effect of his experience are suggested with the relationship with his family and girlfriend and as the abuses are publicly exposed. What could have been a powerful exploration (like ""The Deer Hunter"") turns out to be milk-toast.",1393804800,6,798,5.053030303030303

8638278,1,B00I1O34KA,"Something does not seem right about this movie. It denigrates US servicemen.. MPs serve toilet paper like waiters and empty pails of human waste daily. Abu-Ghraib detainees are unlikely to use ""western"" toilet paper for their personal hygiene needs in the first place. Water and left hand has always been the practice and tradition. One prisoner per cell does not seem to be a bad arrangement...You do not see any food being served either. Looks wierd...Overall- not worth watching..",1481241600,2,483,5.1265822784810124
