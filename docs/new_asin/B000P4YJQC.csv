8188924,3,B000P4YJQC,"This dvd is o.k. because i love boxing and love collecting fights, plus i know these two fights are almost 40 years old so i shouldn't complain that much but the picture quality is really bad. It looks like it was copied off an old vhs tape where the tracking was going in and out. A couple of times i was having flashbacks from 15 years ago looking for my VCR remote to adjust my tracking and then i remembered this is DVD not VHS.L.O.L.....Both fights are fun to watch as all three fighters on this dvd gave there best effort i'm sure and Olivares was a true punching machine once he got going. As a matter of fact i have heard it said more than once before the time of Julio Cesar Chavez it was Ruben Olivares that was the greatest Mexican fighter of all time. Up to this point i don't remember too many of his fights, the one that stands out in my mind is his legendary battle with Alexis Arguello who he was beating for 13 rounds and then got KOed with one punch. That fight is not on here but instead he has one fight each with Bobby Chacon and Art Haffey. The ring introductions and prefight instructions are in english and unfortunetly for me the ringside commentary is in spanish. If you speak spanish you will most likey enjoy this dvd much more. If it had been in english i would have given it another star.",1342828800,,1318,4.234126984126984
