8614684,5,B00FE0WT3C,Exceptional DVD. I enjoy and respect all of Dr. Klappers work.  SOS is an issue that need to be correctly taught.  This presentation is exceptional in helping others understand how to heal from the SAD (Standard American Diet).,1496707200,,227,4.947368421052632

8614686,5,B00FE0WT3C,"The DVD arrived very quickly and well packaged. Dr. Michael Klaper is one of my heroes. He was a keynote speaker on the 2014 Holistic Holiday at Sea cruise. A well respected physician who understands the connection between foods and illness, Dr. Klaper tells it like it is regarding the health dangers attributed to the Standard American Diet (SAD). The medical information shared in this DVD should be a must viewing for every American who believes that cold-pressed, extra-virgin olive oil is healthy. Dr. Klaper, along with other noted physicians who've done the research, agree that the oil companies are great at marketing misinformation. The public are like sheep being led to slaughter, totally oblivious. Just take a walk in any American mall. The obesity rate is on display in all its glory. We need to make changes in how we eat, not only for our individual health, but for the sustainability of our planet. I highly recommend Dr. Klaper's DVD; it's eye-opening, educational, and can make a difference in your life.",1403481600,13,1025,4.965116279069767
