Barenboim effortlessly commands the orchestra from behind the piano in this superb production. I particularly love the emperor, and the final movement especially.

3964137,5,B002P9K9SW,"As more and more classical DVDs are becoming available, I am slowly replacing recordings that I already have on CD. This was an excellent opportunity to replace a number of CDs with one reasonably priced purchase. While one of the reviews I read (not on Amazon) noted that Mr. Barenboim played a few wrong notes and maybe was not fully able to balance some of the orchestral aspects due to his involvement as soloist, I should like to report that as someone who is not a super know-all where musical interpretation is concerned, I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this huge undertaking.
To realize that these works were recorded live during a three day period shows a capacity that few, if any, other musicians might be tempted to try. Playing the solo piano is one thing, conducting the orchestra another, and to pull it all off so magnificently is quite a feat.
These are the first recordings that I have seen or heard from the Bochum Jahrhunderthalle, a building that one would not assume would have the correct acoustics for this sort of endeavor. Whatever magic the sound engineers were able to work is amazing though it never at any times seems strange or artificial. The same can be said of the video, where a nice balance of showing individuals within the orchestra and Daniel Barenboim as soloist has been achieved.
I like these recordings immensely and most of this is due to Mr. Barenboim being in complete charge and being able to interpret the piano part and control the orchestra exactly as he saw fit.",1206921600,6,1518,4.7105263157894735
3964138,5,B002P9K9SW,"Daniel Barenboim is one of the greatest musician of our time. This complete rendering of the Beethoven piano concertos is a proof of his excellence: A great conductor and a great pianist, all at the same time! A delight in terms of sound and image. May be the best complete recording of the Beethoven piano concertos in DVD.",1201392000,3,324,4.603448275862069
3964139,5,B002P9K9SW,"I've always loved Barenboim since my first vinyl album of his Beethoven Sonatas sang me to sleep in my teens.  Having him on DVD is a magical treat!

I received the DVDs for Christmas and have spent the day after listening to (and watching) them.  What an experience!  The sound quality of the DVD is superb and I often get the feeling that if Barenboim didn't have to stay conscious to play and conduct, he would melt into the piano and music!

This brings up an interesting thing; a few weeks ago I bought the Askenazy DVDs of the Beethoven concertos and watched them several times, replaying some parts again and again to try to ""get inside"" the artist and his performance.  I was never able to.  Ashkenazy treats the piano as if it were something ""other"" than himself that must be mastered while Barenboim IS the piano!

You have to watch these DVDs to know what I mean.

I also think that the synergy between the pianist and orchestra is amazing when Barenboim is conducting AND playing!  All your cells will smile! I'm not kidding, you just gotta watch it!

Pure magic!",1198627200,17,1075,4.518134715025907
3964140,5,B002P9K9SW,"I've had very mixed feelings about Daniel Barenboim as both a pianist and conductor over the years. For instance, I really disliked his Bach Well-Tempered Clavier of a couple of years ago. But he has always been a masterful Beethoven player and that is clearly in evidence in this set of two DVDs on which he plays all five Beethoven Concerti, live at the Ruhr Piano Festival earlier this year (May 21-23, 2007), with the Staatskapelle Berlin, an orchestra for which he is Chief Conductor for Life. This set makes a fine companion to the DVD set of Barenboim playing all the Beethoven piano sonatas issued about a year ago. There are those who wonder why one would watch DVDs of concerts in preference to listening to a CD. Well, first there is the visual aspect, for me a very important component of the musical experience, but also since more music is generally contained on a DVD than a single CD, one often gets a bargain. This set costs about the same as two CDs, but one can't get all five Beethoven concertos on two CDs -- it takes three of them. So this set is a bit of a bargain compared to CD sets of the concerti.

All that would mean nothing if these weren't excellent performances, but they are. I was especially thrilled with Barenboim's Third Concerto, a particular favorite of mine. His first movement cadenza was, for me, worth the price of admission. Gloriously dramatic. Much the same could be said about the entire Emperor Concerto. I might have some quibble about the slightly heavy approach to the Second Concerto (which was, of course, the first Beethoven wrote and much more like Haydn than any of the others), but Barenboim's way with that concerto's delicious middle movement makes up for any concern I might have about the outer movements. As for the Staatskapelle Berlin, it is a top flight orchestra and they provide superb accompaniment. I guess I should mention, if it wasn't already obvious, that Barenboim conducts from the keyboard and I have no arguments with his well-considered conceptions; this Beethoven reminds me less of Furtw&auml;ngler, with whom Barenboim is often compared, than of B&ouml;hm.

An easy recommendation, particularly for Barenboim fans, but also for others who want solidly played and beautifully videographed and recorded performances of these great concertos.

3964141,5,B002P9K9SW,"Superb.  Just wish Mr. Barenboim had a cooler venue as the poor guy not only plays and directs, but must wipe the sweat off.  Poignant passages lose some thrill as sweat drops from the end of his nose...  I also detect the thumping of the sustaining pedal on the floor during exuberance.  Once it is detected, it rivets attention.  But then Gould drove me nuts with him humming.  Lastly, being a country bumpkin, I couldn't help notice the hangar-like setting.  While probably state of the art, it reminded me of a Target warehouse.",1387238400,4,532,4.655913978494624

3964144,5,B002P9K9SW,"There is far too much to say about Barenboim and Beethoven for a short review. Fortunately, it is all documented on CD's and anyone who wishes can here his youthful distortions become mature masterly (in most cases) rubato, in my view.

I write to call attention to the octaves in the Emperor (Concerto No. 5) which Barenboim plays VERY much
slower than any other artist I can remember (in 55 years of adoring this piece). For me, this tempo
and rubato sounds just right.

I also suspect that a piano of Beethoven's time might not have allowed the fantastic speed that our
virtuosos use today.

One wonders how Barenboim, whose hands are not as large as Andre Watts, for example, manages the octaves
so well.

By the way, I completely agree with the reviews praising Barenboim as a pianist. His Goldberg Variations
are a wonder and his Mozart minor pieces are nearly perfect. His Mozart piano concerti are a little more
manipulated than I like, without the joyous humor of the scamp that young Mozart was (before concerto 19)
in my mind, but they are very very good.

Enjoy the benefits of maturity!
Along with the technique of youth, that modern medicine allows.

PS At least on my BluRay player there is no menu or way to skip easily to a particular concerto, or at
least none I can find. Jumping movement by movement does eventually get you to the Emperor, after around
13 clicks, if I reckon correctly",1360800000,3,1405,4.622489959839357
3964145,4,B002P9K9SW,"I have over 150 classical DVD/BRs that I watch on a 106"" screen and listen through a 7.1 loudspeaker setup where the front speakers are about 9' 6"" apart and the surround speakers are on my sides. The room has sound treatments so I hear what's on the disc, not distorting reflections from the walls. My reviews concentrate on the surround audio, as you can pretty much judge the video and stereo for yourself on youtube and similar sites.

My collection includes both performances of Beethoven's 5 Piano concerts performed by Barenboim and Buchbinder.

Both have excellent picture, as is usual with Blu-rays.
Both top menus offers only ""Play"" or ""Trailer"", so choosing the sound track or a specific  concert is more cumbersome than it should be.

Audio is PCM Stereo (which I didn't listen to) and PCM 5.1. for Barenboim, DTS-HD MA 5.0 for Buchbinder.

Barenboim's orchestra sound is a bit of a mixed bag. While the orchestra sound stage is quite wide and you feel like sitting in row 1, he has an unconventional lay-out of the instruments. Normally, the first violins are at the very left of the stage, seen from the audience. To the right of it would be the second violins, then the violas, the cellos and finally on the very right the double basses.
He has the cellos next to the violins and the double basses behind the two on the left. Violas on the right. So you don't get that clean violin sound from the left, it's often ""muddied"" by the lower frequency string instruments next and behind them and the right side sounds kind of bland, string-wise. It gives a lot more impression of ""surround"" if you hear a melody played by the first violins on the left, to be then repeated by the cellos half right, then the flutes half left, then the bassoons to the right, etc. His set-up evens the strings out rather then details them.

The piano is in the center and well recorded as far as clarity is concerned. It also stands a bit out from the orchestra.

If you prefer a more traditional orchestra lay-out, the Buchbinder performance offers that, with the piano also more in line with the orchestra, not as much emphasized as in the Barenboim version. However, the sound stage in the Buchbinder version is not as wide and it gives the impression of sitting in row 8 rather than row 1.

So it is either conventional with Buchbinder from a bit of a distance or an unconventional lay-out up close with Barenboim.

I'll give both 4 stars, reserving the 5 stars for ""conventional and close"".",1356912000,8,2487,4.595936794582393
3964146,5,B002P9K9SW,"The first thing to note about this issue is the considerable generosity in playing length enabling all five concertos to be accommodated on the one disc. Add to that the undisputed reputation of Barenboim over many years as a highly respected interpreter of Beethoven coupled with an equally respected orchestra and recording company and the whole package seems unbeatable. As has been normal for Barenboim for many years, he directs from the keyboard and this has a clear unifying effect on the interpretation being offered.

This latest set of performances by Barenboim is fully aware of the latest thinking as regards authentic interpretation but played on modern instruments. The orchestra is reduced in size as appropriate. Barenboim has made previous recordings of these works, but in my opinion, these are by far his best. There is ample drive as is typical of Barenboim, but far less of a `Romantic period' feel about these performances than has been apparent in his previous recordings. In other words this set is firmly based in the `Classical period' but with increasing drama through the set which prepares the way for the `Romantics' without actually being there. In my opinion this is historically correct. The use of a reduced modern orchestra keeps the scale correct while allowing greater impact of the individually more powerful modern instruments. This balances his use of the modern 'Steinway Grand' solo instrument. In my opinion this is a good solution to delivering a period performance in a modern context.

The imaging is crisp and the camera work is fully involving without being invasive or distracting. The sound is presented in good quality DTS-HD surround as well as stereo. There will be those who do not warm to the venue which is visually rather Spartan, but it does have the virtue of not damaging the acoustics of the recording.

Having all the concertos on one disc and in such a high quality presentation as this makes for an outstanding bargain and so it should give much pleasure and satisfaction to future purchasers. In these circumstances it seems only reasonable to rate this as a 5 star issue. However, there is an alternative set now available of these concertos on a single disc by Buchbinder with the VPO on C Major. That too is fully deserving of 5 stars and may appeal to those who find Barenboim a little too insistent for their taste. The ideal would be to buy both! Either set is likely to give considerable musical reward so choice will be largely a matter of taste which is beyond the remit of this review.",1343520000,14,2560,4.880459770114943
3964147,5,B002P9K9SW,"If you like the three B's (Beethoven piano concertos, Berenboim and Bluray video/audio quality), you'll be happy with this recording.  Given that there are 5 concertos on this disc makes it something of a bargain.

From a musical perspective I am not a big fan of recordings where the soloist (Barenboim in this case) is the conductor as well nor do I particularly like live recordings but this is a true exception on both issues.  Barenboim and the orchestra seem to be communicating with a sixth sense.  To me, this indicates long hours of rehearsals and musicians who really know their material.  The orchestra seems small in terms of head count but their sound is big.  I'm not an expert but these are my impressions.

The large audience is especially quiet which is unusual for a live recording.

On the technical side, the audio recording is smooth and natural without overemphasis of any particular instrument or frequency range or reverberations.  The acoustics of the hall are amazing especially considering the simplicity of the design.  It looks like an aircraft hanger but sounds like Disney Concert Hall.  The camera positions are generally good and the director uses them well.

A small demerit for this disc (but not enough to lower my rating):  The on-screen menu does not offer audio mode selection so you'll need to use your Bluray player's controls to select DTS-HD Master mode if your audio system has this playback mode.  A small inconvenience when compared to other Bluray discs that have this feature built into the disc's main menu.  On my Panasonic player this means pushing the button marked Audio on the remote and choosing DTS-HD Master mode.

Enjoy!",1334534400,7,1678,4.918149466192171
3964148,5,B002P9K9SW,"I thoroughly enjoyed the performances. The Blu-ray video is very nicely done; Barenboim's mastery of these famous concertos is a joy to watch; there were some passages that I wished the cameras would show other performers and instruments than what's on the screen, but that's just personal taste. If one compares to CD and DVD-Audio non-live recordings of the same pieces, some parts of the audio kind of have ""reduced intensity"" in a few very brief moments; but overall a very good aural experience for these live performances. Highly recommended.",1331683200,3,548,5.1
3964149,5,B002P9K9SW,"Being a long-time fan of these Piano Concertos, I have heard many interpretations. However, I have never before heard them played so beautifully and with such passion. I received this disc yesterday, and intended to watch one or two Concertos over a period of two to three days. Of course I watched all five in succession in one day. That is over three hours of Classical Music Nirvana. This blu-ray has beautiful photography, but the DTS HD Master 5.1 is the real attraction next to Daniel Barenboim's superb interpretations. I can only join with all of the other 5 star reviews in saying that this disc is a must own for anyone who loves these wonderful Concertos.",1330992000,3,666,4.700854700854701
3964150,5,B002P9K9SW,"I was so interested in listening to Barenboim play the Beethoven Concertos that I bought a blu ray player to experience these performances; the purchase was well worth it. Set in a restored steel mill in Bocum near Dortmund, Germany, his five part, three day performance was part of the 2007 Klavier Fest Ruhr, a summer long piano feast in Germany.

Barenboim, the finest contemporary performer of the Concertos, shows a warmth and palpable intimacy with the composer and the Berlin Staaatskapelle. He is his animated self, but more restrained  than in his Triple Concerto and Choral Fantasy recording with Itzhak Perlman and Yo Yo Ma in DVD.  The audio coming from the blu ray is first rate. The picture is radiant and above criticism.  Camera positioning is extraordinary, superbly scripted, planned out note by note.  There are at least four close-up angles for his piano playing something not possible to even a holder of a front row seat at a live performance. Face on, frontal shots show the piano's hammers and dampers, rarely seen during a live performance.  His cadenzas,  especially in the Adagio of the Second Concerto, send chills to the listener as if Barenboim is alone at his piano, his fingers dancing along the ivories. One feels the intimacy of the moment.

A live performance offers so much more than listening to a CD.  The blu ray experience equals that. That more superb classical music is being released on blu ray,  combining razor sharp visuals and the high quality aural experience affords the classical music listener the finest  musical experience other than the live performance. I enjoyed the lengthy crowd applause in the end; it shows the gem&uuml;tlichkeit of the German concerto attendee; restrained and seated  throughout the first four concertos but exultant and standing after Fifth.  To see the Teutonic ice break is so thrilling.  An ""almost"" live performance to be enjoyed over and over.",1324166400,24,1927,5.0
3964151,5,B002P9K9SW,"These five Piano concerto's of  Beethoven,with Barenboim conducting the Staatskapelle Berlin orch and playing the piano at the same time,takes place in Bochum Germany 2007. A part of the Ruhr Piano festival according to the notes. Recorded live in an ex steel factory, turned into a concert hall, which makes a change from the usual venues. The girders are exposed which makes a different backdrop. I am all for that. The sound is excellent. Barenboim directs the orchestra not only by his hands,but he uses his head by nodding it,or using his eyes. A very difficult achievement. The tempo's are quick. He plays with emotion and passion where required. He is not a flamboyant character like Bernstein. A set that should be a part of every Piano loving fan. This is a master at work. Recommended. If I could give it ten stars I would. Worldwide.(Amazon .com has a habit of changing worldwide bluray into A-1 now, which makes it difficult for Australians like me.) 1080 HD-200 minutes-One disc.

3964152,5,B002P9K9SW,"In PCM stereo, the orchestra sounds close and dry, rather like the Cleveland Orchestra in the classic Leon Fleisher audio-only set. Everything, including the piano, sounds much richer in the DTS surround version. The aspect ratio is 16:9, and the visual component offers great clarity and depth of color, even in shots where the color is limited mainly to that of the string instruments and music stands. I can't say that the utilitarian hall is much to look at in the background, except when the shadows along the walls begin to lengthen; the cycle was shot over the course of three days, around sunset each day, and you can see the natural light change over the course of each concerto. That's an unexpected extra in an attractive release.",1306454400,7,741,4.796875

3964157,5,B002P9K9SW,This is a wonderful production with perfect picture and amazing sound. Barenboim performs exceptionally well as a conductor but especially as piano player. We have forgotten over the years how good a pianist he is. He interprets Beethoven conservatively and plays with perfect temperament and precision. Great harmony with the orchestra. This is music at its best and a must have. Phenomenal Blue Ray and I wish there were more available of this quality.,1290470400,,454,5.148648648648648

3964159,5,B002P9K9SW,"If Daniel Barenboim is not the world's greatest living classical musician he is certainly the most versatile. In a career spanning more than 50 years, his name is attached to many of the celebrated recordings of opera, symphony, small ensemble and piano solo. With the later half of his career marked by distinction at the podium, one may forget that he is still an accomplished concert pianist. Here we are treated to both talents as Barenboim conducts the Staatskapelle Berlin and plays all five of Beethoven's piano concerti. From the accompanying booklet we find that Barenboim first recorded these works in 1967 at the age of 24 under Otto Klemperer. Now he is revisiting them 40 years later on the occasion of his 65th birthday.

The challenges of serving as conductor and soloist are undoubtedly considerable, but Barenboim, performing entirely from memory and without a score, makes it look easy and natural. Even while fully engaged in his role as soloist, Barenboim never loses command of the orchestra. Sometimes his direction is in the momentary freedom of a sweeping gesture of his left hand. At other times it's the subtlety of his nod or the quickness of his eye. The Staatskapelle is perfectly attuned to these nuances and their playing is always on cue and never hesitant.

Among the many highlights: the wonderful exchange between piano and clarinet in the Largo of the first concerto, a thrilling account of the Rondo Vivace in the final movement of the fourth and all the beauty and majesty of the Emperor.

The performance was recorded before a live audience during a three-day piano festival in Bochum, Germany in 2007. The concerts took place in the Jahrhunderthalle, which features an architectural design from a converted steel mill. The minimalist interior with high ceiling and exposed steel beams forgoes the traditional elegance that adorns many concert halls (and the stuffy pretence that goes with it). Aesthetically, the Jahrhunderthalle stands as a venue that emphasizes comfort and clean sight lines above all. The sold-out audience is appreciative and respectful of the music. They are often in view, but rarely heard (even between movements) until their applause at the end of each work. They are smartly (if not formally) attired people who know good classical music when they hear it.

Some of the performances took place during daylight hours allowing the large rear windows to cast a gorgeous natural light on the audience as well as the performers who are further illuminated by soft stage lighting that highlights the musicians and their instruments where needed and without any harsh shadows.

The 1080i Blu-ray image is near flawless. Skin tones are natural and appealing. The color of the instruments and the audience attire is accurate with no bleeding. The ivory keyboard is properly exposed and balanced with plenty of resolution to see the distinction between keys. The black levels are strong without losing any detail in the jacket creases of the musicians. Close-ups reveal the polished brass of the French horns as well as the fine grain in the basses and violins. Barenboim is appropriately the center of attention and we can see the delicate wisps of his hair and the beads of perspiration that begin to glisten on his forehead by the third movement of each concerto.

The PCM 2.0 audio track is clean, but the piano sounds a little harsh above high C. By contrast the DTS HD-MA 5.1 track, by opening up the ambience of the rear channels and a broader soundstage, delivers a beautiful sound that is warm and spacious and devoid of any discordance in the upper register. The piano is properly centered while the sonic integrity of each orchestral instrument is presented with distinction according to its location on stage.

The full program runs at approximately 3:20. There are no supplements save for a handful of trailers of other Medici Arts releases. An interview with Barenboim, some rehearsal footage and a short history of the venue would have been nice, but unfortunately were opportunities missed. In the end that's the only thing missing as this is, in every other way, a most welcome release and another grand achievement for one of classical music's most distinguished artists.",1260662400,94,4245,5.021306818181818

I have watched this repeated times, and enjoy it every time; never tire of this music/presentation in front of a HUGE live audience.  Barenboim looks youthful and boyish, despite his gray/white hair, but he plays and directs with great enthusiasm.  The Berlin State Orchestra is excellent:  with conductor/Pianist Barenboim every measure of the way.

If I had any quibbles, it would be one passage in Piano Concerto 4: I, which I believe Barneboim plays a 3rd below what is written/improvises for a measure, but he plays everything from memory, and many listeners would not notice, nor object.

This is very satisfying.  Recommended!",1417392000,,809,5.1692307692307695
