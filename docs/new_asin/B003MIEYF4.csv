He has begun production of a movie version Yanis Varoufaskis Adults in the Room, about the economic problems faced by Greece with a politically ossified European Union leadership.

In this movie Costas Gavras tackles the refuge crisis, which has very much been in the news. While our president has made refugees an issue now in the United States, it is perhaps a bigger issue in Europe. Europe has been and continues to be hit with a largest influx of refugees. Syria, Lebanon, Lybia, Egypt, Iraq, Somalia, all these countries are rife with civil wars, unrest, terrorist attacks, foreign invasions, and military conflict  and they are all close to Europe, to where the refugees flee. This gripping, tense, perceptive film captures the exploits of one refugee whose only wish is to start a normal, new life in Paris. This story is rife with simple human emotion and pathos.

We know the name of the refugee. He calls himself Elias, but we cannot be sure. On the road and on the lam people will call themselves anything they want. We don't know where he came from, we don't know why he left his country, whether because of civil unrest or something else, don't even know precisely where he landed in avoiding the Coast Guard, although we can presume it was a Club Med sort of resort in Greece. Eden is West follows our refugee every kilometer along the way. On his journey he meets German and French tourists, Greek farm women, truck drivers, middle class Greeks, and an assortment street people, all of whom are willing to help him. He works under the table and most of all, avoids the police. It is truly an international journey. The languages of English, Greek, French and German are spoken in this film.

One is struck watching this film that for all the vitriol broadcast on the mainstream media about aliens, on a one-to-one basis, people will go out of their way to help refugees start a new life.  It was not their fault that their country of origin is experiencing unrest. It is ironic and at the same time oddly appropriate that the people most likely to help the refugee avoid the authorities come the countries most responsible for creating the unrest (are you listening France, Germany, or the US?) in the first place!

For those who just don't get the point of this movie, perhaps they should watch it again. This movie certainly bears repeated viewing. The action and direction are great!",1510617600,,2536,4.726244343891403
8400407,2,B003MIEYF4,"I associate ""Costa-Gavras"" with political thrillers, and so was rather disappointed.

Perhaps it is more suspensfull when seen from a European perspective.

Or perhaps it is a comedy when seen from a European perspective. The ending (and other incidents) suggest that that is possible.",1389398400,,285,5.454545454545454
8400408,5,B003MIEYF4,"I am a solid Costa Gavras fan and this is like no other film he's done before!

An original road story reflecting the reality of modern life. There is barely any dialogue in the film and plenty of circumstantial action against the backdrop of Europe.

It is original, refreshing and very well performed by the lead, who plays a character that has a child-like innocence with basic survival instincts.

In the end it feels like an Alice in Wonderland for our times. This is an exceptional movie!",1283990400,6,494,4.655172413793103
