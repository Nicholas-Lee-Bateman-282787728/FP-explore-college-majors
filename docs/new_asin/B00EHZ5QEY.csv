5914995,5,B00EHZ5QEY,"I don't normally go for movies like this. However, I found 3 Days of Normal to be genuinely likable and at times very funny--I've even brought this film up in conversation with some of my work friends. Overall, i'd recommend this film to anyone wanting to spend a night with a good film.",1376956800,,287,4.433962264150943
5914996,4,B00EHZ5QEY,"Maybe it's because we have a camp in that town, or that my wife is way in the background in one shot, but I really liked this movie. Good story, and some great humor (and a lot of local faces and spots.) Kudos to the Director for using so many locals in the production.",1376524800,2,269,4.0
5914997,5,B00EHZ5QEY,"I saw this movie twice at the NH Film Festival.  It was funny and enjoyed the scenes--since I have a place in Washington, NH, it was cool to see people I knew and places I have been too.",1376524800,2,186,3.8947368421052633
5914998,5,B00EHZ5QEY,Loved it,1443139200,,8,3.5
5914999,4,B00EHZ5QEY,"Not spectacular in any manner, and predictable, but good.",1430956800,,57,5.444444444444445
5915000,2,B00EHZ5QEY,"Very disappointed. Thought I would like it, but it really was too silly.",1426118400,,72,4.615384615384615
5915001,5,B00EHZ5QEY,Ok...so I spent some time with Mercea Monroe (yoga teacher training - so LA I know) and my review may be biased because I know how hard she's worked and I'm thrilled to pieces that she's making her way in an industry that's almost impossible to get into...and I also loved the movie.,1423180800,,283,4.3584905660377355
5915002,2,B00EHZ5QEY,It was okay for $1.99. I wouldn't watch it again,1420416000,,48,3.9
5915003,1,B00EHZ5QEY,"Some of the worst acting I've seen in a while. Pedestrian plot, even more insipid dialog.  Pass this one by.",1419292800,,108,4.4
5915004,1,B00EHZ5QEY,Contrived and poorly written plot.,1417219200,,34,6.0
5915005,4,B00EHZ5QEY,Wife loved it. I thought it was OK.  Next movie please.,1416528000,,55,4.0
5915006,1,B00EHZ5QEY,"pitiful, poor acting and dull story-line.",1412812800,,41,6.0
5915007,1,B00EHZ5QEY,Didn't like it.,1411776000,,15,4.333333333333333
5915008,1,B00EHZ5QEY,This  movie should be rated X.  The morality is terrible and storyline is terrible.,1411344000,,83,4.857142857142857
5915009,4,B00EHZ5QEY,"Cute love story but the ending was cut a bit short.  Still, worth watching.",1410307200,,75,4.357142857142857
5915010,1,B00EHZ5QEY,Thought it was a cute family film.. It's not. A lot more sex between men and women and some  .... Foreplay.. ? Of one man riding another wearing chaps.  Later the one partner says he only did it to get the sex tape of the other partners girlfriend. We see snapshots of the film.,1402704000,4,278,4.12962962962963
5915011,3,B00EHZ5QEY,"A cute but typical story. The acting wasn't great, the plot typical, but it was good entertainment. Don't expect too much and you'll enjoy it.",1399939200,,142,4.72
5915012,5,B00EHZ5QEY,This is a great movie if you understand the town it was filmed in. Washington NH is a small historic and vacation town in the mountains of central NH. life is simple with a city influence brought in by vacationers,1398729600,,213,4.35
5915013,5,B00EHZ5QEY,"Ordered this dvd - it was a good price and arrived in good condition and didn't take that long coming from the US.
It was a good "" feel good "" movie which I do prefer.",1397692800,,167,3.6666666666666665
5915014,3,B00EHZ5QEY,I kind of liked it.  It wasn't the best acting but I watched it several times during the time I rented it.,1396396800,,106,3.8181818181818183
5915015,3,B00EHZ5QEY,A romantic comedy about a Hollywood starlet who shakes up the life of a small-town sheriff after she hides out in his town over a long weekend.,1391990400,,143,4.333333333333333
5915016,3,B00EHZ5QEY,This movie needed some real acting like Reese Witherspoon. Wasn't bad. It was close to being good. I did watch it twice to get my money's worth.,1385769600,,144,4.37037037037037
5915017,4,B00EHZ5QEY,"Good movie. Okay, maybe not an Oscar quality film, but a fun happy movie. Mircea Monroe (Hart of Dixie).....need I say more? Okay...WOW!!!",1383523200,,138,5.043478260869565
5915018,4,B00EHZ5QEY,"This movie offered the viewer to experience real chain of events or should I write as real and normal as possible with action, laughter and a change of identity.",1383091200,,161,4.586206896551724
5915019,4,B00EHZ5QEY,"It was refreshing to get some clean entertainment, see a new face or two and I enjoyed it with my husband.",1383091200,,106,4.095238095238095
5915020,3,B00EHZ5QEY,"This movie needed something; more humor, a deeper plot, a faster pace...something. If you watch the preview you can pretty much fill in the rest...no curve balls here. It was refreshing not to have explicit nudity in a movie. You could have your teenager's girlfriend or boyfriend over and watch this with them. Still, it needed something more.",1382659200,,344,4.948275862068965
5915021,5,B00EHZ5QEY,"Well written, well acted- true love story- hope to see the leads more often or at least more writing. :)",1381968000,,104,4.25
5915022,4,B00EHZ5QEY,Virginia Madsen gives the movie some depth and is always a pleasure to watch. The teenage female lead is charismatic and I hope to see her in a more mature setting. A very enjoyable film that is a step above the typical teenage romancer.,1381104000,,237,4.409090909090909
5915023,3,B00EHZ5QEY,"I watched the movie to the end, but it is not memorable.  Good if you need to use up time.",1381104000,,90,3.5
5915024,1,B00EHZ5QEY,"I truly don't understand why this movie has so many good ratings. It's probably one of the worst movies I've seen in a really long time. To top it off, it's really not worth $4. Take my advice, just rent something else!",1380758400,2,219,4.238095238095238
5915025,1,B00EHZ5QEY,This was a terrible waste of 3.99!  It was like watching a jr high level play.  I struggled to stay awake as I waited for the acting to get better and a story unfold...neither happened.,1380758400,,185,4.257142857142857
5915026,2,B00EHZ5QEY,"Very slow, the lead male character could pull off serious but not funny, which is very important. I finished it, but only to see if it improved and because I really appreciate independent film.  Sorry, but just not a fan.",1380412800,,221,4.525
5915027,1,B00EHZ5QEY,"Well. We watched the first 15 minutes together, then looked at each other and pushed Stop. I watched  30 minutes more the following day then stopped it for good. Who would be the proper audience, I do not know...",1380412800,,212,4.435897435897436
5915028,5,B00EHZ5QEY,"Loved the simple, small town feel and all of the goofy supporting actors who add spark to the small town community.  The leads in the film were equally interesting and fun.",1379894400,3,172,4.548387096774194
5915029,1,B00EHZ5QEY,Best not to waste your time on this one. The plot is moronic. The acting is wooden. Who talks like these characters?,1379808000,2,116,4.318181818181818
5915030,4,B00EHZ5QEY,"This was filmed in my hometown.  Part of the fun was recognizing where scenes were filmed.  I also was a ""fuzzy"", in the background, extra in one of the scenes. The story line was the"" boy meets girl"" , which has been used in many movies, but it does grow old.",1379548800,,260,4.078431372549019
5915031,5,B00EHZ5QEY,Really enjoyed the location scenes of the little town of Washington NH.  Really didn't change the views much for cinematic purposes.  The story line was also much better than expected as were the actors.,1379203200,,203,4.9411764705882355
5915032,3,B00EHZ5QEY,"I wanted this movie to be better. But it's a predictable plot, for the most part, with a glitzy no-heart starlet and a small-town cop who, astonishingly, has never left town -- or not very often. The characters are not believable. The catalyst for the movie is a kind of young gad-about-town who seems to be a stand-in for all country bumpkin stereotypes.

Not even the Northern New England scenery looks good.",1379030400,,410,4.694444444444445
5915033,3,B00EHZ5QEY,"The plot was fairly entertaining, but nothing else about this movie was above average. The acting was okay at best, the script so-so. Also the dialogue was a bit crude for my taste. This film could have been improved with an expanded story line; it was only 1 hour 20 minutes long. All in all, I did not think it was worth the $3.99 I had to pay.",1378857600,2,346,4.102941176470588
5915034,5,B00EHZ5QEY,"An excellent, fun story.  Beautiful use of the New England fall color.  A charming story with a good array of characters.",1378339200,,121,4.714285714285714
5915035,2,B00EHZ5QEY,"I figured I would write a review since I got suckered into this movie based on the other good reviews (which it turns out are all written by extras in the movie).

Terrible acting. Slow plot. Pretty boring and blah all the way across. Definitely a waste of $4.",1377388800,5,260,4.3061224489795915
5915036,4,B00EHZ5QEY,The writing was clever and creative in developing the story line and the harmless plot line made this a fun watch everyone.,1377388800,,123,4.636363636363637
5915037,4,B00EHZ5QEY,"I have to confess that this film was made in my town and my wife and I are extras.  Still, I really found it to be charming.  Both main characters are very likeable and it's a well-written story.  It also doesn't hurt that it's filmed in a beautiful place.  Make some popcorn and enjoy.",1377043200,,286,4.2407407407407405
8605385,1,B00EHZ5QEY,Trashy.,1530748800,,7,7.0
8605386,1,B00EHZ5QEY,Top 10 worst movies I ever saw. Can not remember the other nine. Hopefully I'll forget this one soon.,1510444800,,101,4.368421052631579
8605387,4,B00EHZ5QEY,A good movie and I enjoyed it,1506988800,,29,3.2857142857142856
8605388,5,B00EHZ5QEY,"Loved it, but will be honest...I live in the town where the movie took place and was filmed. Totally enjoyed the story and seeing the beauty of our Town on the big screen!",1503619200,,171,4.212121212121212
8605389,5,B00EHZ5QEY,Really cute movie.  I recommend as a chick flick!,1475539200,,49,4.444444444444445
8605390,3,B00EHZ5QEY,"It's a quirky look at a debuty of a small town & what makes him spark when he meets a beautiful woman. She finds know what ""normal"" is and he comes alive when she is around.  Everthing is not the same anymore.",1474934400,,209,3.9761904761904763
8605391,5,B00EHZ5QEY,I thought the acting was top-notch.  Cinematography was beautiful.,1464307200,,66,6.333333333333333
8605392,1,B00EHZ5QEY,"too many inuendos, too much vulgar language. The general idea of the movie its ok but it should have been rated PG13 at least. W did not watch beyond the first 20 minutes or so.",1456185600,,177,4.085714285714285
8605393,3,B00EHZ5QEY,Nice easy watch movie.,1452902400,,22,4.75
8605394,5,B00EHZ5QEY,"It might help that I live near Washington, NH (yes, it's a real town) and that I know many of the extras, and nearly all the major locations used. It's the actual police station, the actual village store and restaurant, the actual village, and it's every bit as beautiful as the film makes it look. I was expecting hokey acting, but it was really pretty well done. As a low-budget indie film it won't appeal to everyone (and it's not for kids), but I was pleasantly surprised.

BTW, the real police chief is nothing like the character in the movie. He's an all-business professional. The police station is in the old two-room school house (used until about 20 years ago), and it doesn't have a jail cell as shown in the movie. They used one in nearby Hillsboro for those scenes. That door really leads to a storage closet.",1443225600,3,822,4.516778523489933
