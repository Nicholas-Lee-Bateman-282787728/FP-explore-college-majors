8696056,5,B00RW2LXPK,This is really cute too.  All of the Franklin movies have lots of 'twists' and action.  They're cute but not mindless so we all like watching them.  My boys are 3 and 4.,1468800000,,169,4.0606060606060606
8696057,5,B00RW2LXPK,"""Franklin and Friends: Deep Sea Voyage"" is one of two ""Franklin and Friends"" special adventures produced in association with Sea World, the other being ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Franklin-and-Friends-Polar-Explorer/dp/B00HPBAGNS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Franklin and Friends: Polar Explorer</a>."" It's a 44 minute adventure and a lot of fun for fans of this intrepid turtle and his friends.

Franklin and his family, including little Harriet, have gone for a beach vacation and they've invited Franklin's best friend, Bear, as well. Franklin and Bear are dressed for the occasion, Bear wearing a version of his blue vest featuring palm tree and beach motifs, while Franklin is sporting sun and palm tree pictures on his trademark red cap for the occasion. As the special opens, they're thrilling to the adventures of one of their favorite comic book series, based on the real-life expeditions of the underwater rescue team of the seals Paco and Francesca. They're excited about attending a special event in which they'll actually get to meet this duo, but when they get there, they're informed by an otter named Olive that the event has been called off, because Paco and Francesca had to head off on a real-life rescue. Franklin and Bear are understandably disappointed, but then get drawn into a real adventure of their own when Olive invites them for a ride on an actual submarine, captained by her good friend, the experienced sea-turtle Captain Delmar, or just ""Del"" for short.

Franklin and Bear are at first somewhat unimpressed, as the submarine seems like it's old and therefore not capable of much. They soon, learn, however, that old doesn't necessarily mean incapable, and sometimes may even be helpful when modern technology breaks down. Franklin also learns some other important lessons, such as that it can sometimes be important to slow down and enjoy things, despite his keen eagerness to get things done, a trait that will be familiar to long-time fans of the show. Overall, it's an entertaining adventure, that kids will enjoy, as will any regular follower of this well-established franchise.

The DVD doesn't include any bonus features, but doesn't include any promos or anything either, so it's kind of nice to get right into the action when you put in the disc after just a couple of brief company logo displays. If you don't select to start the film, or choose a scene, it will start automatically in ten seconds. The look is the best you can get for DVD quality and honestly, watching it on my PlayStation 3, I didn't notice any significant difference between it and watching this series in HD. The only real disappointment is the lack of closed-captions/subtitles, and it might have also been nice to have a French language track, given that the show is made in Canada, but I can live without this.

A lot has changed since the ""Franklin"" television series started in 1996, such as the look of the show (traditional animation to CGI) and many of the voices, but the core spirit of the show remains the same. This adventure is a lot of fun and was worked on by many staff who have been with the show since the beginning. The feature is in fact, written by John van Bruggen, with all songs written by him as well. If you don't recognize the name, then know that Bruggen directed the entire first season of ""Franklin"" as well as the movies ""Franklin and the Green Knight"" and ""Franklin's Magic Christmas,"" as well as writing ""Back to School with Franklin"" and several installments of both ""Franklin"" and ""Franklin and Friends."" The franchise remains in good hands.",1431907200,,3631,5.046666666666667
