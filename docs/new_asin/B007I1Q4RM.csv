8517183,2,B007I1Q4RM,"Short version: The Nostalgia Critic put it best when he said (in reference to ""The Last Airbender""), ""I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, I know it gets really annoying every single time I say ""in the show"", because it's an adaptation. Adaptations, you gotta make changes, I understand that, I really understand that, but... it's gotta be changes that make sense, guys!"" Not that ""The Magic School Bus"" show is the worst edutainment adaptation, but I just don't think it holds a candle to the original books.

Long version: Read on.

As you may have noticed, I usually review non-fiction books. That's because non-fiction books are more structured than other forms of edutainment (& thus, easier for me to review). However, I feel so strongly about ""The Magic School Bus"" that I had to make an exception. In this review, I list the 4 main reasons why I don't think ""The Busasaurus"" (henceforth TB) in particular & the show in general holds a candle to ""In the Time of the Dinosaurs"" (henceforth Time) in particular & the original books in general.

1) In Time, Ms. Frizzle, Liz, & Arnold are the only well-defined/developed characters (E.g. We learn that Ms. Frizzle's 1st name is Valerie & that she went to high school with Jeff, her paleontologist friend). The non-Arnold kids are basically wallpaper. The same goes for the original books in general. On the show, the good characters are even better developed (E.g. Ms. Frizzle is basically the female Willy Wonka), while the not-so-good characters are almost exclusively defined by their catchphrases & range from bland to awful: On the bland side, there's Tim, whose basically the Franklin to the show's ""Peanuts"" (I.e. He doesn't even have his own catchphrase); On the awful side, there's Carlos, whose basically a FOX Newsman (I.e. He's an arrogant, obnoxious, fear/hate-mongering bigot). TB in particular shows the good characters at their best (E.g. Arnold saves the class from a T.rex) & the not-so-good characters at their worst (E.g. Carlos spouts anti-dino speeches at every available opportunity).

2) In Time, most of the ornithischians & some of the saurischians are depicted with wonky hand &/or foot anatomy. Otherwise, the animals are mostly accurate for the time. The same goes for the original books in general, but not the show. See ""Review update #8 (It's a big 1)!"" for how TB in particular fails: [link in the 1st comment]

3) In both Time & TB, the class visits Ms. Frizzle's paleontologist friend at a dino dig. However, the similarity ends there: On the 1 hand, in Time, the class travels back to the Late Cretaceous Period ""to look for some Maiasaura nests"" because ""paleontologists have uncovered the bones of some Maiasaura...but are disappointed that they haven't found any nests"" (See ""Editorial Reviews"": https://www.amazon.com/Magic-School-Bus-Time-Dinosaurs/dp/0590446894 ); We learn that ""Dinosaurs Were Special"" compared to ""today's reptiles"" (E.g. ""Some dinosaurs may have been warm-blooded. All of today's reptiles are cold-blooded""); On the other hand, in TB, the class travels back to the Late Cretaceous Period ""to see what those ancient reptiles...were really like"" because Carlos brought up his ""prejudices and preconceptions about dinosaurs"" (See ""Editorial Reviews"": https://www.amazon.com/Magic-School-Bus-Busasaurus-VHS/dp/6304400683 ); We learn that ""there are more plant eaters than meat eaters. The meat eaters wanted a quick meal without getting hurt. They were not blood thirsty monsters"" (Google ""NTTI Lesson: Dinosaurs: Meat-asaurus or Veggie-asaurus""). I have 3 major problems with TB's story-related changes:* 1) T.rex shouldn't have replaced Maiasaura as the main dino; For 1, T.rex is the most overexposed & overstudied dino; For another, a cameo like in Time (I.e. 1 T.rex turns its head & glances at the class, but otherwise pays no mind to them) would've made more sense given TB's lesson; 2) TB (among other episodes) shouldn't have been based around Carlos' prejudices & preconceptions; Google Books search ""Considering Effects in Context As"" for why; Point is, bigotry shouldn't be allowed on an edutainment show; 3) All carnivorous dinos shouldn't have been depicted as being dangerous & all herbivorous dinos shouldn't have been depicted as being friendly because, to quote Bakker (See ""Maximum Triceratops""), ""that's wrong. In nature today, the most dangerous critters on land are huge, strong vegetarians. African elephants charge lions and try to squash their cubs. Black rhinos use their long horns to spear hyenas. Hippos use their big teeth to chop crocodiles in half.""

4) In Time, the epilogue consists of 2 pages in which Cole & Degen recognize some major falsehood in the story (E.g. ""A BUS CAN'T BECOME A TIME MACHINE"") & expand on what we learn from the story (E.g. ""Birds are the dinosaurs of today""). The same goes for the original books in general. On the show, the epilogue consists of 3 minutes (including the completely pointless & slightly racist intro) in which the producers or guest stars do the same thing while taking phone calls from kids. I have 2 major problems with the show's epilogue: 1) Unlike the book's epilogue (which concentrates on expansion), the show's epilogue gives equal time to recognition; 2) The show's epilogue fails to cover many story-related subjects & those that are covered are done so in an insufficient manner (I.e. Sometimes, it simplifies things to the point of being meaningless; Other times, it's just plain wrong). Again, see ""Review update #8 (It's a big 1)!"" for how TB in particular fails: [link in the 1st comment]

*I don't have a problem with all of TB's changes. In fact, I like that Carmina replaced Jeff as Ms. Frizzle's paleontologist friend given that there aren't enough ""female characters with personalities"" in cartoons (Google ""Revisiting My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic"").",1407801600,5,5859,5.200211864406779

8517185,5,B007I1Q4RM,"I watched a few episodes of this show when it still aired, and even though it was aimed at a younger audience (I was a teenager at the time), I remembered it being fun enough that I thought our 3-year old daughter would enjoy it. She simply LOVES this show!

The length is perfect (about 25 minutes per episode), and the characters are a good range of nationalities and personalities. Ms Frizzle is the teacher we all wish we had, and the humour in the show keeps even my husband and me amused (especially the last segment of the show, featuring The Producer). Quite a lot of accurate information is presented in an easy-to-understand and very attention-capturing manner.

I particularly like that this dvd offers the shows in English and Spanish, as we are raising our daughter to be bi-lingual and it is often difficult finding shows in Spanish. The Spanish-speakers are definitely native speakers; for someone who is trying to learn Spanish, it may be a bit too fast-paced, but as fluent speakers, my husband and I were thrilled.

Definitely a great buy!",1365724800,,1057,4.733695652173913
