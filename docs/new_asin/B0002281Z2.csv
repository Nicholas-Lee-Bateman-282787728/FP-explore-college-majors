8020292,5,B0002281Z2,"This episode is the seventh episode from the third season of Shining Time Station. It is the only Thanksgiving-themed episode of Shining Time Station, too. The Thomas The Tank Engine story in it is ""Thomas's And Percy's Mountain Adventure"".

Shining Time Station is one of those rare children's shows that has been sadly overlooked by many of today's children's shows (which most of them aren't that very good). It hasn't even been given a DVD release, either.

Fortunately, Britt Allcroft (the person who first produced the Thomas The Tank Engine television series, based on the late Reverend Wilbert Awdry's books and also co-created Shining Time Station) has mentioned on her Facebook page that there are people around her and co-creator Rick Siggelkow who are working very hard to get Shining Time Station either rebroadcast on television, released on DVD, or maybe both. While there are some admin issues to deal with, but the effort and support of doing so is much stronger now and those who are working hard to make it come true know how much this is important to those who remember seeing Shining Time Station when they were children themselves.

If you want to help get Shining Time Station released on DVD, you can sign the petition right here, and you can even sign the petition to help get the Director's Cut of Thomas And The Magic Railroad released on DVD, too: http://restorethemagic.org/.",1441411200,,1404,4.940677966101695
