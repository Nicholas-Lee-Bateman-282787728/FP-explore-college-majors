Luckily, discs snap firmly into laptop CD/DVD drives, so I was able to prevent the vibration in my laptop. I was then able to burn an exact copy onto a DVD+R. Once I got that hassle out of the way, I was able to watch the copied DVD on my TV.

The content of the DVD was excellent. Bennett Marine's DVDs generally get poor reviews, so I was glad that this was a good one. Sample clips of Bennett Marine videos are available on YouTube, so I already had a good feeling about John Rousmaniere's navigation instruction before I made my purchase.

Not everything sunk in during the first viewing, so I will be watching this multiple times. Watching it several times initially, and then once before each boating season is probably a good habit. For first-time viewers I strongly recommend watching it with a notebook and pencil and taking notes, just like you did when taking classes in school. The DVD presents some simple calculations for speed, time, and distance that I wish I had copied down.

This DVD is an introduction to navigation, so experienced navigators may find that they know much of the material already. Running time is 62 minutes.

I would have given this DVD five stars, but I deducted one star because of your potential hassle of needing to copy the DVD or returning it to Amazon for replacement.",1252713600,,1414,4.5770750988142295
8004988,5,B0000ZG0EU,"This is an excellent entry level technical electronic publication.

People new to boating would gain an excellent overview and basic understanding of both the traditional methods of simple navigation as well as the more modern sophisticated tools such as radar and global positioning systems (GPS).

Sufficient instruction is given to enable a skipper to start practicing the use of the various navigation techniques in safe waters.

Boaties of all levels will go away after viewing this DVD knowing they must not rely on just one method of navigation but need several available to them at all times.

A DVD on Navigation that I will be watching and learning from over and over again.",1123632000,2,684,5.0265486725663715
