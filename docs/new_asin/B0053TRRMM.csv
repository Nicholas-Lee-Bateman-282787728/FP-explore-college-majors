4552278,4,B0053TRRMM,"I went into FRAT HOUSE MASSACRE looking for two things: gore and male nudity. This is a surprisingly difficult combination to find in the horror genre, but I'm happy to say this film delivers. On top of that, it's also a very stylishly directed, well done throwback to the movies of the 1970s. It's kind of like Ti West's THE HOUSE OF THE DEVIL crossed with a David Decoteau opus.

While the film could have used more nudity (and what movie couldn't?), it made up for it by having some of the most impressive gore I've seen in awhile. It reminded me of an old school FRIDAY THE 13TH movie, with some great practical effects and very brutal kills. If that's your thing, you won't be disappointed.",1313280000,20,695,4.47244094488189
4552279,5,B0053TRRMM,"i hate gore, but i was visiting a girlfriend who's a film student at nyu and she convinced me to go see this. i went because i thought jon fleming was hot in will & grace, but i was genuinely impressed by his acting.

i bought this to check out the behind the scenes footage and see what his personality is like.

can anyone recommend any other good horror films with jon in them?

8455645,1,B0053TRRMM,"The premise sounded interesting and the retro, '70s look made me want to like this film, but overall I just can't. The movie does have a vintage feel, but I struggled to find an actor or actress that I even remotely cared about. The over-the-top acting from the frat president was so distracting that I found myself more irritated than entertained.

While the film had plenty of killings to justify the ""Massacre"" in the film's title, there was no real reasoning behind any of them and the gore effects were pretty substandard. Anyone can film a close-up of someone spitting out some red corn syrup guys. Also, I'm pretty sure there was more to fraternal college life in the '70s than an obscene amount of hazing, cocaine and abuse. The female characters in the film (with the exception of the maternal ""Olivia"" character) were nothing more than victims for abuse and on one occasion, sexual assault.

There was a somewhat interesting twist mid-way through, as well as a twist ending, but this felt tacked on and reeks of a cheap way out of finishing a plot. Given the title and setting, this could have been a great twist on a classic, what with a fraternity being central to the story. With classic slashers like ""The House on Sorority Row, The Slumber Party Massacre"" and ""The Initiation,"" this film would have been perfect for turning the tables and focusing on college-age male victims. The filmmakers really missed their chance to create something fresh out of so much history. Instead, they gave us two hours of inexplicable violence and abuse for abuse's sake. Oh, and many, many close-up shots of shirtless frat guys in their underwear.

Skip this one and grab something vintage. It's for the best.",1413849600,2,1707,4.779661016949152

8455647,1,B0053TRRMM,"Fortunately I bought a used DVD of this title in the marketplace. Even at that I feel I wasted my money. This movie is so bad I feel like I just gave away an hour an a half of my life for nothing in watching it. The plot is not believeable at all. This is just a senseless gore fest. It has none of the characteristics of the classic suspense slasher films like Halloween or Friday the 13th. I was not once on the edge of my seat anticipating the next moment of fear as there was none in this movie. The acting is atrociously bad as well. I actually like most Synapse DVD releases but not in this case. Rent it, if you can, before you decide to buy. You'll be glad you saved your money.",1356048000,,686,4.014598540145985

8455649,1,B0053TRRMM,Do cinemagoers really want to see  a film with  the violence so over the top and ongoing  that it detracts from any  worth that the film may have had.  Don't believe the hype on the  dvd cover sleeve which  says that the film is loaded with nudity. There is very little and no frontal- everyone keeps their privates hidden. The story is  also over the top and  unbelievable. How could so many students  just disappear from College without anyone wondering  where they are. The film is overlong at 2 hours and  also boring. When you  can't write a  decent story just pad it out  with  excessive violence  as is the case here.truly a worthless  film. Doesn't the director know that less is more. The less you show the  more the audience  get to  see  as was the case with Hitchcock.,1318032000,9,780,4.421428571428572
8455650,5,B0053TRRMM,This movie is AWESOME!!! It feels like an actual horror movie filmed in the late 70s! They did an AWESOME job with that!  And Jon Fleming as the star really carries the movie!!!! He's VERY easy on the eyes and a VERY believable actor!!  You may recognize him from the series Dante's Cove.  Enjoy the movie! You will NOT regret buying it!!,1316649600,3,338,4.419354838709677
8455651,3,B0053TRRMM,"Judge Gordon Sullivan, DVD Verdict-- Several things about Frat House Massacre are impressive. First, it's one of the few films I've seen out there that takes the homoerotic aspects of fraternity living seriously. Most films gloss over a bunch of men living together with a small joke about being gay and call it a day. Frat House Massacre takes that a step further. No, the film does not imply that everyone who joins a fraternity is gay, but rather that for an organization filled with young men who profess a desire for women, there are an awful lot of shirtless men running around obsessed with each other and their sex life. I'm not sure it's a balanced portrait of fraternity life (if such a thing exists in movies), but it feels like a nice balance with other fraternity movies. The film is also impressive for not being afraid to aim for some psychological complexity in the characters. Giving Sean a brother in a coma brings a depth to the characters that would be at home in a drama rather than the run of the mill horror story. As the frat leader, Mark is also a bit more realistic than I expected, though he's still a bit of a cookie-cutter villain since the focus is on Sean and Bobby.

However, those aspects of the film that make it an impressive indie effort will also likely spoil it for a lot of horror fans. First, I don't want to stereotype the horror audience, but we (because I include myself) are not known for a love of the homoerotic--quite the opposite, in fact. While a load of manflesh might not turn off every prospective horror fan (and could even attract a new demographic), it's almost certainly a hard sell to the average DVD renter. Second, the attempt at psychological richness, though impressive on paper, leads to a film that pushes the two-hour mark. That's a dangerous place for a horror film to be; just about every slasher and grindhouse film that inspired Frat House Massacre clocked in a lot closer to 80 or 90 minutes. I'd love to say that the film rewards the two-hour investment, but there are too many places where a bit of judicious trimming would have paced the film a lot more effectively.

One thing fans can't complain about is the amazing look of Frat House Massacre. Though made on a typical indie budget, director Alex Pucci really raises the bar in terms of cinematography and set dressing. It was aiming high to go for a retro-Seventies feel, and while it may not be period-accurate, the film effectively conjures a solid Seventies vibe. That look is solidly presented on this DVD from Synapse. The 1.78:1 anamorphic transfer replicates the look of those old-school film stocks, which means colors are a little off from accurate, but detail is strong and compression isn't a problem. The 5.1 surround audio track keeps the dialogue crisp and clear, with the occasional touch of atmosphere in the surrounds.

Extras start with a pair of commentaries. The first features director Pucci and writer Draven Gonzalez. The pair is obviously proud of their creation and detail its production and trip through the festival circuit. The second features the film's crew (as well as what sounds like quite a bit of beer), and gets more into the day to day workings of the production. We also learn more about these aspects of the film in the short behind the scenes featurette. Finally, the disc includes 20 minutes of deleted scenes.

Despite being a bit too long for a horror film, Frat House Massacre has enough gory charms to effectively conjure the feeling of the grindhouse films it's indebted to. The DVD's bonus features make this one worth a rental for those looking for a horror flick well outside the mainstream.
