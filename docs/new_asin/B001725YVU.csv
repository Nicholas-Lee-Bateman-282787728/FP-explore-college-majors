3167244,1,B001725YVU,"I only sat through the first give minutes of the video, which I found extremely ironic because it is called yoga for knee problems, yet the mute instructor begins the practice by going into full lotus!!!  I have learned through my practice that full lotus and half lotus are possible for people with knee problems, but I do not feel it is appropriate to have an instructionless video for people with no knee problems and CERTAINLY not by opening in full lotus without explaining how to safely get into the posture when you have knee problems.  I am no yoga instructor, but most of the yoga instructors I know do NOT recommend even attempting lotus without having a live instructor to assist you if have knee problems.  I later learned this by accident myself a few years back after I'd actually snapped my knee but pushing my body before it was ready and not having enough mind-body awareness at that point to realize what I was doing was wrong (until the unthinkable had happened, of course).",1420070400,4,993,4.630681818181818
3167245,4,B001725YVU,"This series is more beneficial if you are slightly familiar with the poses they use, just having done them a few times before with clear instruction, but I found it to give me freedom to explore the poses on my own.

Cons:
-Not helpful if you aren't familiar with the poses
-No explanation as to how these poses help with knee problems
-NOT for people with knee injuries

Pros:
-Short and to the point - no cheesy intro music!
-Gentle and relaxing (if you know how to adjust the poses to your comfort level)
-Without excessive commentary like some instructional yoga videos, you are able to explore each pose on your own.
(Instead of being told in the span of five seconds to open your heart, twist your knees this way, arch your back, AND breath into your pelvis while pulling it into your sit bone ALL AT ONCE, you are given a quiet time to FEEL the pose on your own - where is there pain; where does it feel really good; what happens if I adjust this way.)",1406246400,,959,4.322222222222222

3167248,3,B001725YVU,"If you have never had a yoga class, skip this video. There is NO VERBAL INSTRUCTION on it, whatsoever, except for an Indian yoga practitioner doing the postures (which are shown in a cartoon form in the pose, along with it's Sanscrit? or Indian name written below at the beginning of each pose), some relaxing music, and a bell that sounds, both, when the practitioner gets fully into the pose, and when it's time to stop.
If you've had a yoga class, you'll know the postures, which are not out of the ordinary ones, and you'll know how to engage your core, feel an invisible string pulling up your spine, and so forth.
However, if you are at the point where your knees are really compromised, some of the postures in the middle of the video, you won't be able to do; they require you to sit on your knees, and for someone like me, who needs knee replacement, it's not gonna happen.
These are probably traditional stretches and postures which, while they may have some benefit to someone who has had some mild knee pain because of lack of muscular support, and so forth, are not really tailored to someone with a knee injury, per se.",1368921600,19,1133,4.478260869565218

8264777,5,B001725YVU,"This is a short video in a series.  The first video in the series (Yoga: Mind Body Connection) is about 2 hours long and will teach you the asanas (poses/postures) used throughout the series.  The rest of the shorter videos, of which this is one, will simply demo a sequence of the particular asanas that will target the problem identified in the video title.  You do NOT get verbal instructions or coaching in this 20 minute video.  Go to the first video for that.  Here you get a presentation of ""the asanas that address the imbalances causing disorders [in this case, knee problems] and helping to reverse them.""  That said, I think this is one of the best targeted yoga series out there.",1427068800,,691,4.5772357723577235
