3092049,5,B0012L0TEI,"I feel I should write a review after going through this emotionally loaded production, but there is so much to it that I find myself at a loss for words.

""Billy Budd"" was not all that well received when it first appeared but many now consider it Britten's best, ""Peter Grimes"" included.  Perhaps it needed to be compressed from the original 4 act opera to the 2 act one that is now performed.  Certainly it is now a very tight opera that does not seem to have any superfluous bits.

This was recorded in 1966 in a BBC studio wherein there was built an accurate set giving the illusion of a fully-manned man-of-war.  The action takes place within this enclosed claustrophobic world of which the captain is king and feels he must must allow the laws to be enforced.  The orchestra (excellent) played on an adjacent stage while the filmed action took place on the set.  The actor/singers were most appropriately cast and were all wonderful.

The camera work is superb; and with cutting and camera placements illustrates the characters and the moral problems much more clearly than would be experienced by a theatre audience.  It feels as though the viewer is there and participating emotionally.  I suspect that the fact that it is in black and white, and not coloured, helps to emphasise the dilemmas that are presented.

The original recording has been painstakingly remastered.  The picture is very clear; and the sound, albeit mono, is surprisingly good.

I will not get into a discussion of the issues raised by Britten and his librettists.  There is certainly a lot to think about and discuss.  I hope that those of you who read this review and buy the DVD will enjoy doing so.

If you admire the works of Benjamin Britten, this is a must buy.  If you are open to being turned on to the works of Benjamin Britten, you cannot do better than start with this production.",1238976000,33,1871,4.638297872340425

8246672,5,B0012L0TEI,"There is no way around it.  This is the definitive version of a masterpiece.  It moves with the inexorability of a Greek tragedy, driven by a cadre of powerful singing actors, headed by Peter Pears, Peter Glossop and Michael Langdon.  The underlying homoerotic text of the original is carefully preserved (the librettist was non other than E.M. Forster himself).  And the music is simply exquisite. Now I recommend you go for the recently released ""Moby Dick"" (see my review)  What a combo!  Interestingly, the new ""Peter Grimes"" at the Met is basically done in stark black, white and gray . . . Did I mention that's how this Billy Budd was filmed?",1385078400,2,648,4.741071428571429
8246673,5,B0012L0TEI,"I would like my review to stand out and say something that hasn't been said in the other reviews. Alas, I have nothing to add but enthusiasm.

This is a very powerful opera and superbly staged, costumed, conducted, acted and sung. Peter Pears is a superb Captain Vere.

Okay, maybe I can add a little...I felt an undercurrent of some social/emotional issues here. I believe there is a gay sub-text that is important to the story. First, Billy Budd has no home---no one at home. He's ready to join the ship. No, no, that doesn't mean he is gay. But the Captain never mentions a wife back home either. Scenes of Captain Vere reminiscing clearly take place in a bachelor pad. The other conscript mentions his wife and family back home---I believe that give a contrast.

The superior officer killed by Budd seems to be motivated by a manifestation of jealousy. He calls Budd his ""Beauty"" and there are some squirmy scenes of touching which I believe imply a sexual attraction. The captain is restrained as a senior officer but Claggert is far less sophisticated. I would say that Otello (Verdi) has a similar under current---

The fact that Britten was gay has nothing to do with my observation. I believe it is there and I believe it is deftly handled by all parties.

So, maybe I did add something to the discussion.

The work is superb. It's beautiful in black and white. It's perfectly executed---no pun intended.

I highly recommend adding this to your collection. It is a treasure.",1382054400,2,1483,4.680769230769231

Even though the ranking is a silly business, Billy Budd, for me, is a supreme example of Britten's craft and achievement, second perhaps only to his Peter Grimes in the opera category. It was unjustly ignored outside the U.K. until recently. I believe this superb production will help bring to it the wider audience and the long-overdue recognition.

In a very broad sense, Britten's compositional model resembles that of a Baroque master. His musical language was set early on and it only developed and evolved very gradually. There was never a dramatic turn in his language. (Unlike the ""Chameleon"" Igor Stravinsky, for example.) The language and sound are so consistent that one can hear a few bars and tell it's by Britten and Britten alone. His enormous output with various degrees of perfection also makes him stand out among the twentieth century composers and reminds us of the Baroque (and pre-Beethoven classical) composers. For example, he has written 17 stage works alone, with at least 9 of them full-scaled operas. They were always written with specific singers in mind (at least partially) and produced soon after their completion.

A little bit of background might help here. Billy Budd, his sixth opera if you count ""The Little Sweep"" as one, was originally composed during 1950-1951. At that time, he was already a celebrated figure due to the great success of Peter Grimes, premiered in 1945 at Sadler's Wells. Britten's language at that time was already fully developed, and his youthful exuberance, originality and melodic inventiveness were apparent in this work. However, unlike Grimes, the first public performance in 1951, conducted by the composer himself, was not a popular or critical success. In anticipation of a BBC broadcast in 1960, Britten revised the opera substantially, tightened the structure and compressed it into 2 act. It is this revised 2-act version which is recorded here.

The story of Billy Budd is, in a sense, one of innocence and evil, as originally conceived by Hermann Melville. It is adapted to an operatic format effectively by Foster and Crozier. Since opera and literature are two different genres, certain 'transformations' are absolutely necessary. In the end, it lost some literary subtleties, only to gain in theatrical drama. Britten's music creates declamatory contours and musical effects which fit the libretto like hand and glove. Composed merely 5 years after Peter Grimes, the opera shares similar musical idioms and dramaturgy. If you adore Grimes, most likely you will like Budd as well.

This BBC Television's studio production, directed in 1966 by Basil Coleman, Britten's long term collaborator, is extremely effective. The cast, hand-picked by the composer, consists of the top-tiered British singers at the time.(*1) At the helm was then young Charles Mackerras, leading LSO, with Britten sitting in and giving advices. This TV production evolves againt the background of a warship, vividly reconstructed in studio. Glossop's Billy Budd and Langdon's Claggart deserve special mention even among this distinguished cast.(*2) But the ultimate hero is Peter Pears' Captain Vere. He embodies the character so memorably and convincingly; he *is* Captain Vere!

Technically, the video is black and white and the sound is mono. However they have been carefully remastered and the presentation is excellent.

------------
(*1) The liner note, which details the ""2 studio"" system and other things pertinent to this production, is a must-read!

(*2) Britten was entertaining the idea of inviting his favorite baritone Fischer-Dieskau for the title role. I wish he did!! However, Peter Glossop's performance, both vocally and theatrically, is extremely convincing and satisfactory.",1295308800,11,5429,6.635211267605634
8246675,5,B0012L0TEI,"The re-mastering of the original BBC production of this opera by Benjamin Britten is a real treat with Peter Pears. The story, adapted from Melville by E.M. Forster and Eric Crozier is a fascinating tale about the evilness of human justice on a ship under the Acts of War and other regulations having to do with court-martialing anyone for any misdemeanor in war time on a man-of-war and the opera deals with a lot of crimes all punished by death, an accusation of planning a mutiny, the actual striking of a superior officer, the murdering (though it was manslaughter) of this officer, and treason of the King and the country in the face of the enemy. Falsely accused by his superior officer, the foundling (who never managed to say orphan when asked about his family because of his stuttering, though he managed to say foundling) and volunteer in the royal service against the French in 1797, Billy Budd is unable to defend himself with words because he is silenced by a fit of stuttering again. So he hits the accuser and kills him, accidentally or incidentally but not with the intention of killing him. But that accuser is his superior officer, hence Billy Budd deserves death for hitting his superior officer and committing murder. He has to be hanged twice but they will reduce it to once. The point is not that miscarriage of justice, but the all-male environment that creates tension and stress that is at times hardly manageable.

The said superior officer is down on Billy Budd, in other words attracted by him sexually or at least emotionally, which he cannot accept probably both because that questions his masculinity and his authority over the men under him, and hence he decides to have him pay for that unmanly attraction of his. But Billy Budd is liked by everyone and the captain is himself attracted to that young and handsome foundling. This time we cannot say the attraction is sexual but the attraction is a deep emotion that makes the captain like Billy Budd and vice versa makes Billy Budd like the captain. In an all-male environment all kinds of distortions can occur in the relationships among the men in this closed environment that the ship is. But thats not what Benjamin Britten tries to show. He tries to show the dilemma in which the captain was when the events took place. He had to stick to what he had seen and avoid what he may have sensed or felt at the time. He then stuck to his testimony that meant two death penalties. But in his old age staged at the beginning in one flashback in the opera and at the end, that captain acknowledges the idea that he could have saved Billy Budd because he had the power to pardon the convicted man, and even before he could have testified about the loyalty of Billy Budd, hence the accidental and provoked assault on Billy Budds superior officer by this superior officers absurd accusation.

But he didn't and thus he, the captain, is to be tried in and by another court, a divine court in which he believes, and he believes this one is not going to be as lenient as Billy Budd. But the following episode is the main moment of that story. Just before being hanged and released to the deep sea, Billy Budd actually forgives the captain and that saves the captains soul, but then the captain could have pardoned on the spot and he did not do it, and that does not save his soul, that dooms his mental peace and his future after death. Thats the story of a sea episode in which a captain endorses a miscarriage of justice just to keep his liking for the accused secret in an all-male environment. It is very similar to Peter Grimes, except that in Peter Grimes the young apprentices die due to accidents, and yet a retired captain tells Peter Grimes to go at sea and sink himself in his boat and he does it. Miscarriage of justice again. But it is an opera, so what is so musical in this story.

The music and the singing are systematically dramatic and somber like hell. Instruments often run one against the others, creating conflicting points, even at times hiatuses, and that gives to the words and the images since it is a visual show a tremendous depth. But there are some moments when this depth becomes a tremendous elevation. Before his execution Billy Budd is visited by an older sailor who brings him a final drink and a biscuit. That scene is full of emotion and Billy Budd concludes his making his peace with the whole world and the injustice he is going to suffer with a final sentence that reads as follows when sung: Thats all, all, all, and thats enough, thats enough, thats enough. This is a marvelous direct allusion to Solomons trial or wisdom (due to the two repetitive triplets in the sentence) but it shows that the captain was the one who was confronted to a decision that could be compared to Solomons decision: Billy Budd is guilty twice and he is going to die, but this time the captain did not react like the real mother did in Solomons story, accepting to lose her child for it to live, thus revealing she was the real mother, the captain did not accept to make public his liking for Billy Budd in order to enable him to live for purely egotistic considerations to avoid any innuendo about his masculinity of authority, let alone his sense of justice.

And thats what is wrong with human justice: it is blind, deaf and mute: it does not see, does not hear and does not tell the truth. Thats why the text and the music are full of such triplets when dealing with life and the relations between the men on the ship. There are dozens of examples. Dankster declares that he is too old for fun, for dancing, for women. The three judges declare Weve no choice, weve no choice, weve no choice and this trinity is crucified by a final repetition no choice. And at the end Billy sings turning, turning, turning heads away from the hoist and the belay, with a double trinity, Solomons number anew and the allusion to his wisdom and his wise decisions. And the vicious and lying John Claggart, the master-at-arms, specifies his intention about Billy Budd as follows: Nothing can defend you, nothing can defend you, nothing, nothing, nothing. The first two phrases evoke some kind of war logic (he is at war against Billy Budd) and the final trinity builds up a pentacle of five nothing and that is devilish: he is so evil that the good of life is perverted into pure satanic evil with his warlike intention against his own men: if that is not treacherous, what is?

The music that accompanies the gathering of all the men and the arrival of Billy Budd for his execution is a real gem and diamond in the whole opera with rolling drums from time to time, with whining horns and mocking flutes that create a fake environment to introduce a fake sham of justice that is a real execution nevertheless. And the forgiving declaration of Billy Budd after the reading of the sentence Starry Vere, God Bless you shines like a dawning sun in that visual scene of an execution that was taking place in the middle of the night, under the light of the stars and that you never see except through the eyes and movements of those who look at it, of the beholders who are moved in some kind of maybe an intention of protest, and that is killed in the bud by the troops sent by the captain. This last scene of graphic voyeuristic indirect non-vision is a great way to be poignant without being over-realistic.

There is though a last remark I would like to add. This opera has a pattern I have already alluded to when comparing it with Peter Grimes. We have the sea again, we have some brutal life at sea and it is increased by the war going on. Once again it is the orphan, the foundling, the abandoned boy who is victimized by his superior, both his direct superior, the master-at-arms, and the captain of the ship himself who puts the three commanding officers who compose the court martial in a snaring situation to condemn Billy Budd on an incomplete testimony, which is in itself a crime in those Books of War, Billy Budd is thus the stranger in the crowd on the ship, the one who has no home and no family, as well as the victim of the situation, though this stranger among many is liked by all except one perverse individual. And it is this one individual who manages by his own death to trap everyone else in his lie. Remember Peter Grimes who was not liked by anyone but because an old spinster of a gossip ran a campaign of rumors against him, though she won in the end and yet saved her skin.

They can be a moving experience since he has a good eye for a great story but his music leaves me cold.  The best I can say for it is that is interesting.  But this performance, as a music drama, is riveting.  Everything comes together to create a wonderful realization of Melvile's story.
