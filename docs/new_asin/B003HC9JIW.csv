I started it two weeks ago plus and haven't stopped - I pop it in the morning and it takes about 20 minutes - but I feel SO MUCH BETTER.  She is great.

4124825,5,B003HC9JIW,"My treadmill broke last week. I live on the East coast and the daily temp is in the 30's. I needed a workout that got at least 2 miles in without dancing and hard to follow steps. I did this for the first time today with my ipod on. I didn't even listen to her and it was a great workout. I recommend to anyone who doesn't want to bother with the rumba or confusing steps and actors to annoy you in the background. Basic simple workout. You sweat, you shower.",1292284800,106,459,4.054945054945055
4124826,5,B003HC9JIW,"I love this DVD!  This is a perfect workout for someone who doesn't have that much time or is a beginner at working out and doesn't like cardio.  Personally I hate cardio and I am so uncoordinated that I can't do dance moves, so this workout is perfect for me.  Leslie's workout is 4 moves, walking of course, side steps, knee lifts, kick backs and kicks.  I wore my pedometer and you actually walk 1 or 2 miles, which shocked me!  You don't need any special equipment for this workout, just your sneakers.  I started doing Leslie's 2 mile walk about 2 months ago, and I lost 4 pounds and an inch off my thighs.  I am in pretty good shape and thought I won't tone or anything with this workout and I did!  What I do with this workout is I ramp up the cardio part so I get a better burn otherwise this workout could be boring for someone.  I challenge myself and go faster.  When Leslie walks front to back, I jump rope in place.  So you can workout at whatever pace you want.  I enjoy Leslie's workout because she's happy, but not to over peppy!",1290902400,122,1045,4.1959798994974875
4124827,5,B003HC9JIW,"2 heart attacks! After weeks of rehab I turned to Leslie Sansone's style of exercise. It duplicated what the rehab program taught with expensive machines, which I could not afford. A few DVDs I could afford. It worked! Latest testing proved that the second heart attack effects have been reversed, no permanent additional damage. The exercise, almost daily, helped, along with a smart diet, good Rx, and prayer.

If you have a heart condition, have a family history of one, or just need to begin to get in shape, this is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AS A BEGINNING. If you are already exercising, and want some challenge, Leslie has other DVDs, tons of them, to choose from. They all work the same way, walking, do-it-your-way--your-pace, and not dance routines. Sansone has DVDs for every age, every ability.

I even tried walking a paved walking path, locally, and found the DVDs offer me more of a workout, more aerobics, and less impact (stress on my old legs), than the actual walking trail. I've recommended several of Sansone's DVDs because of my own heart condition--and now I see the American Heart Association has agreed, and they too are endorsing this fine, safe, doable, and successful exercise option.

My wife and I do this together. Together is good, like healthy living. God Bless.",1276560000,322,1288,4.89908256880734
4124828,3,B003HC9JIW,"This is a good option if you want to do some walking in your home and have not been very active.

4124869,5,B003HC9JIW,"I love this DVD and Leslie Sansone too. I knew I needed to start doing something after being a couch potato for way too long. The question was what! I tried a few other workouts, but I just couldn't keep up with them. I have a lot of weight to lose so it's hard to me to put my foot over my head and keep it there for any length of time. I'm kidding, but some of these workouts made me feel like a fat slob and after trying to keep up with them, very unmotivated. I had heard a lot about Leslie Sansone and even used her DVDs a long while back. I decided to get back on track with her a month ago I dug out my old DVDs and started walking with her. That friendly voice and motivation were just what I needed to get me back on track again. In the beginning I couldn't keep up, but Leslie didn't care. She just cared that I was trying my best.  She kept me motivated and made me smile at times too. She told me I could do it and I knew I could too. After a week I was keeping up with her. It was getting easier and I was starting to enjoy it. I added this DVD to my collection to give me more variety. In a month Leslie helped me to lose 7 pounds. That may not sound like a lot, but to me it's a fantastic start. I did change my eating habits, but not drastically. I follow Leslie's lead and walk 6 days a week. This DVD is quickly becoming a favorite, but then again...I love all the DVDs I have of hers so far. If you have a lot of weight to lose, a little weight to lose, or are just looking to get moving again give this DVD a try and see what Leslie can do for you. Good luck to all and happy walking!",1489104000,7,1604,3.802395209580838

4124875,5,B003HC9JIW,"Being a very large woman who's in her sixties, there's not much I can do in the form of exercise. Leslie Sansone's DVD made it possible for me to walk a mile everyday in the comfort of my home and not worry about what I looked like.",1481760000,19,232,3.9574468085106385
4124876,5,B003HC9JIW,"I love Leslie Sansone's walk programs, and they have motivated me to exercise daily which I am sure has improved my overall health and stamina.  I began with the Walk Away the Pounds 1-mile, and 2-mile walks, and just love that one which is still my favorite so far.  Although I'm active, I am not the sports type, and I was not getting enough exercise period.  The 1 mile walk was do-able, and because I was able to do that without becoming exhausted (okay maybe just  sore muscles but that is good!), I was able to bump up to the 2-mile walk within 4 weeks.  I am still doing the 2 mile, now 6 if not 7 days a week and love it!

This video is somewhat similar to the Walk Away Pounds and different music, but in this one, Leslie is walking alone not with a group of walkers.  She is just as personable, upbeat, and motivating as ever, and the music is updated from the other video.  The thing I REALLY like and is important to me, is that each of the 1 and 2 mile walks, have their own individual warm up and cool down, which makes the workout seamless.  You can pop in the video and select 1 or 2 miles and go straight through from there.  In some of her other videos, the warm up and cool downs are separate segments and you have to pause to select them with your remote and it just doesn't work as well for me.

I also notice in this DVD that both workouts are a little bit faster paced and slightly more intense than the Walk Away Pounds workouts, so they are a bit more challenging for sure.  Either way, if you have trouble getting motivated to exercise like I did, try Leslie Sansone workouts.  The one mile gets you started and once you master that, you will move on to the 2 mile with no problem, and go on from there!  Leslie's personality is just wonderful, she's a real person, and with her, you know you CAN do it and you WILL do it!  Love her videos!",1481500800,10,1866,4.144444444444445

2. It's effective. Walking works. It's scientifically proven. If your trying to lose weight and build stamina this is the video for you.

3. It makes you feel good. When your done you feel more flexible, toned, and accomplished. You don't feel achy, sore or discoreged.

4125006,5,B003HC9JIW,"This is a great way to ease myself into working out again. This is also a good alternative for when I don't get my 20-minute walk outside in. There's no pressure. Leslie is reassuring. The programs are interval training involving your typical aerobic exercises countered with brisk walking. I especially like that this video only shows Leslie and no one else accompanying her. It keeps me focused and feels more like a personal trainer or one-on-one experience.

I initially looked into the video to see if it would be good for my mom to get in exercise and increase stamina after her stroke, which weakened her legs enough to require her to use a cane. Even the warm-up pace is too fast for her. Once you get into the high kicks and lifts with arm movement, forget about it. I wouldn't recommend it to those fresh off a stroke. I found it all suited me much more, though. I was an aerobic class warrior and used the elliptical but haven't exercised regularly for a couple of years. Yes, I do break a sweat but not pouring down with it, which I prefer.

That sounds pretty good to me.  And the background music to keep you on pace is certainly a plus.  When I think I have to walk a mile, I think ugh, but when I think I only have to do 20 minutes, that sounds so much easier.  When I don't want to walk I just say to myself, ""It's only 20 minutes.""

4125049,3,B003HC9JIW,"I love Leslie! I love walking at home! I love the moves, I love how it makes me feel, I love how listening to and watching Leslie makes me happy :)

I've been a runner for over 15 years. I normally run 1000-1500 miles a year. I've run 6 marathons, 2 ultra-marathons and countless 5k's, 10k's, half-marathons, etc. I usually run every morning, 6 days a week. Sometimes it's raining so I'll ""walk at home"" with Leslie instead. Sometimes I'll do a walk in the evening just because it feels good. Her walks provide a really good workout...even for a runner! I have at least a dozen Walk at Home DVDs...all of them 4 and 5 star reviews!

All that to give you the background as to why I'm only giving this 3 stars...and I'm tempted to go lower but it is, after all, my good friend Leslie...

This dvd is advertised as containing ""One 20 minute Gentle Walk"" and ""One 30 minute Brisk Walk""  NOT TRUE!!! I bought this dvd to give to my almost-74 year old mom, who can walk a 20-22 minute mile. I just did the first workout and used my Nike+ app and my Fitbit app to track my pace and distance.

I could tell right away that it was WAY faster than a 20 minute pace! The final stats were 1.25 miles in 20:00 for a 16:33 average pace. Anyone who knows pacing KNOWS there's a huge difference between a 16:30 mile and a 20 minute mile! This ""gentle walk"" was more brisk than some of her other regular walks! So no sending it to mom...I'm going to have to try and make mommy a video of myself walking a TRUE 20 minute mile.

To sum up...buyer beware...it's not what's advertised! If you want and need a 20 minute pace walk, this is not the one to get!",1441843200,2,1636,4.194267515923567

I like not having to drive someplace to exercise, not having to walk in bad weather, not having to worry about how I look (sometimes I exercise in my PJs) and being able to exercise at a time of my choosing. While some of the DVDs have strenuous workouts, this one is easy and especially good for older people and those who are out of shape.",1431043200,2,482,4.426966292134831

If you get bored with treadmills or can't afford a good one it's a great alternative. Also, if you haven't exercised in a long time, are trying to lose a lot of weight and need to start slow or are generally out of shape, I highly recommend this for beginners and intermediate walkers. She makes you want to do it! She is very encouraging and if you're a Christian, she plays contemporary praise and worship music in the background.",1430870400,2,526,4.43298969072165

I love it.  I just put it on my computer and do the 20 minutes a day, sometimes once - sometimes twice a day. .  What I like the best about her is that  when you are done, you feel well rested and ready to start the day.

I like that there is only Leslie in this one and no other people in the background; it makes it easier to concentrate and learn the moves (not that they are difficult). I especially like the countdown timer so you know exactly how much time is left.

update to previous review....  after doing the 2 mile walk for a while now some detail about what is going on in the video might be helpful to someone looking to try
it out...  Doing 2 miles in 30 minutes means your step speed is going past 4 miles per hour at some point.  The step speed increases 3 times during the half hour.  You
are not just stepping in place with this.  She has you doing 4 basic steps (her words) including stepping forward and back (2 steps each way), side stepping, single and double
(left and right).  Also variations of knee lifts (using hand and arm movements at same time), leg kicks (also with arm movements) and kick backs (ham string curls she calls them).

I started out doing the one mile walk and now do it twice in a row for 2 miles.  I use a Fitbit Flex and the actual 2 mile walk on this video doesn't give me as many steps as doing the 1 mile twice.

4125263,5,B003HC9JIW,"I found this to be an excellent way to start (and continue exercising.)  Leslie is cheerful, encouraging and her routine mixes it up enough to keep me interested.  I either follow her routine in front of the computer/television or use it as music and a beat to walk all over the house for the time limit.  The weather doesn't keep me from exercising.  It also helps my dogs as they follow me as I walk all over the house.",1409184000,,421,4.291139240506329

I believe if she slowed down a bit so people could work up to her level this would be great. I'm keeping it because I will continue exercising and I'm sure it will be  of value in the future. Beginner means a lot of things to a lot of people...if you are overweight and don't exercise it might be a bit much right off the bat for you...if you are already strolling along around the block, then this is a nice inside option. Leslie is very motivating and nice to listen to, you walk ""to the music"" so that helps keep you on track.",1405728000,,616,4.049180327868853

The only bad thing is Leslie is incredibly annoying and too peppy.  I want to turn the sound off after the second time I've done it.",1405036800,,400,4.025316455696203

4125285,5,B003HC9JIW,"I don't normally write reviews, but during my workout this morning, I couldn't wait to do so. The 1 Mile is a good starter, but it wasn't long before I was ready to attempt the 2 Mile. I'm an old fan of Leslie and I'm only good for about 30 mins. The 2 Mile is perfect for me. In the beginning, the 2 Mile is fairly challenging, but after several rounds, I decided I needed something more. I was missing the weights from my original VHS of years past, so I thought, ""Why not?"" I added 2.5 pounds to my ankles and held 2 pound weights in my hands throughout the workout. Then later after this became less challenging, I modified the ""2 up and 2 back"". I find those boring and I don't feel a whole lot from them, so I began alternating between wide steps ""2 up and 2 back"" or I do wide step knee lifts. Works the bottom just nicely.

I hope that if you are on the fence, this review can convince you to just jump on in. In the last month, with better eating and regular exercise with Leslie (3-5 times a week depending on how cooperative the kids are!), I've dropped 10 pounds. I'm not finished, but I'm encouraged to continue because it's so fun. This is a worthy investment!",1403481600,8,1174,4.171806167400881
4125286,5,B003HC9JIW,Another fabulous DVD by Leslie. I love that you can choose the one or two mile and the clock counts down your remaining time. The time really does fly by and you get a great workout in the process. Great for beginners or advanced. The steps are very easy to do.,1403395200,,261,4.137254901960785

4125288,5,B003HC9JIW,"I live off of a busy main road without sidewalks. For me to take a walk, I must first drive a few miles to a park. Too much work when I don't have a lot of time. A co-worker with the same location and time issues loaned me her copy of this DVD to try. The first morning I put it in my computer, and walked a mile in my bedroom, I was hooked! It's enough of a challenge for me right now to get the one mile in. I like that there is the opportunity to move up to the 2  mile, and then combine both and work up to a 3 mile workout. This program is easy to follow and I feel good when I'm able to get a mile in before my morning shower. Without this video, I wouldn't be getting much exercise. It is great for people who have been sedentary for a while (like myself--recovering from an Achilles tendon problem) and for people who are not into running but want to start slow and still get a good workout. I am 55 years old and need to lose 40 pounds. If I can do this, so you can most everyone else.",1401580800,2,994,3.825242718446602

4125291,4,B003HC9JIW,"MUCH better than the new Jane Fonda series, which has been disappointing in its poor editing and out-of-sync moves and music.  Sansone's instructions and prompts are reliable, she moves to the beat, and she's encouraging.  I'm just beginning to exercise again, following a health-imposed, multi-year hiatus which finds me in a post-youth age range.  :-(  The 15-minute walk was a good starter, and I moved up to the 2-mile walk very quickly.  When the day has been too busy to afford a walk, or the weather to bad to allow it, this is a great alternative, requiring no special equipment or large workout areas.  As for my reference to ""goofiness,""  I speak in a Southern drawl, so sometimes Sansone's chirpy instructions to ""Walk, walk, walk, walk!"" can sound to my ears like a honking goose, but goodness knows what I would sound like to her!  Highly recommend this video for ""women of a certain age"" or anyone starting out on an exercise program.",1401148800,3,948,4.773006134969325

The one-mile was a challenge at first, but I mastered it quickly.  After one week doing the one-mile twice a day I moved on the the two-mile brisk walk.  Boy--what a time!  It is only 10 minutes more than the one-mile, but the pace is much livelier and works all those muscles even better.  She adds a few new movements with the arms and legs to add intensity.  It is excellent. I was sweating after the two-mile.  She definitely keeps you hopping (not literally!) and works you to promote that healthy heart, which is the main reason I purchased the dvd.  It will be nice to tone up as well.  My husband is attempting it also--we are both 58 years young and in good health. I highly recommend this for anyone wanting to add some physical exercise to the daily routine without having to leave home and make a huge investment in clubs and equipment, as well as time.",1397433600,3,995,4.447513812154696

Leslie is very motivational during the exercises. It's not just walking it's leg lifts and side steps and a huge workout area is not needed.

4125325,4,B003HC9JIW,"I have been looking for an indoor exercise to do during this awful extreme winter weather.  For various reasons home gym equipment was out of the question; didn't want to join a gym because I wouldn't want to leave the house.  So, after reading many reviews of various exercise dvds here on Amazon, I decided to give Leslie Sansone a try.  I really needed something low impact and was just curious how walking in place could really be cardio exercise.  I started with the one mile because I didn't think I was in great shape.  Well, it is definitely a good choice for beginners or beginners-again like me.  After I did the one mile a few days I decided I wanted to do the 2 mile because my family/work schedule would not allow me to do the one mile twice a day as she suggests.  I tried it and had a hard time getting through it; I had to go back to the one mile.  After another week of that I tried the 2 mile again and I could do it and have been doing it every day.  I like Leslie's encouragement.  She isn't a cheer leader or a drill sergeant, just a friendly walking partner giving encouragement along the way.  The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is because I wish she would do a little more stretching at the end.  I also thought it was a little hard to go from the one mile to the two mile and thought it would be a great idea to have a 1 1/2 mile for the transition, especially for beginners.  Overall I love it so much I have looked into getting more of her dvds.",1394064000,7,1485,4.096885813148789

You have the 1 mile walk, and on one of the CDs I have you can work up to a 5 mile walk.  I do wish there was a little more variation to the workouts.  I stopped buying the CDs since the 1, 2 and 3 miles walks that I like, didn't vary enough.  I could have gotten by with just purchasing one CD.",1392768000,7,413,3.7011494252873565

4125335,5,B003HC9JIW,"I have several of Leslie Sansone's DVDs, but this is by far the best for me. I am not an athlete, and am simply trying to manage my weight and keep healthy.

This DVD starts with a 1 mile program that I used for the first week or two. The 30 minute 2 miler every day is enough exercise to keep me in good shape, and it's short enough to fit in almost every day. When I'm feeling really well I bump up the intensity with more arm movements or running in place. I go back to the 1 mile when ""I don't feel like it"" or if I've been off the program for a few days for whatever reason. Then I just build back up to the 2 mile.

I don't do the double side steps. My left knee is weak and doesn't like it. Instead, I do single side steps and do a variety of arm lifts.

In comparison to her other DVDs, this one was easier for me to integrate into a routine. The longer walks bore me and take up more time than I'm willing to carve out every day. Using exercise bands disrupts the flow, which reduces the aerobic benefit I am looking for. And then I have another DVD that provides a selection of 1-milers, but you have to string them together and again it disrupts the flow. This DVD works for me. I feel better every day.",1392768000,5,1214,3.9672131147540983

The beginner walk is good to get started and for days when you are short on time.  The intermediate kicks things up a bit but is still fun and the time flies. It has helped me get over the weight loss plateau also, when my weight loss stalled I got this video to help burn a few more calories and started losing the weight again.

I am really sweating by the end of the workout.  The only thing I don't like is the clock in the upper left corner counting down the entire time you are working out.  I have to hang a shirt over the TV to cover up the clock or I find myself constantly watching it and the workout drags on forever.  With the clock covered up it goes so much faster!

4125414,5,B003HC9JIW,"At first glance the Leslie Sansome walking videos might not seem like they could provide much of a workout or you might think that this may be too easy for you, but think again! She has videos for a wide range of intensity and miles -  up to 4 or 5 miles I believe. She does an excellent job of building up intensity that even those in great shape will feel it. Her videos are also extremely accessible. There aren't any complicated moves. Many videos say this, but in this case it is true. She uses a core set of simple moves and  builds on them, but there is never anything that might throw you off. I always feel great and no matter what shape I'm in I get a good aerobic workout. She is also great if you are busy and cant go to the gym, live in an apartment or are limited in time. Most people can fit in her 15 minute (plus warm up and cool down) 1 mile walk and you do get your heart rate up nicely. The way she has them broken out into 15, 30, 45 and 60 minute workouts makes it so easy to fit in a workout no matter what your situation. I have tried many videos, but I always keep coming back to these. Not to mention, she does not seem to age and always looks to be in great shape so there's the proof in the pudding!

From this I went onto using The Firm videos.  Leslie gets you going and is great for beginners.

A previously purchased 1-mile/2-mile DVD was scratched, so I turned to online versions. First, I love that I can get a streaming version (no more scratched DVDs!). Second, this one is excellent for my purposes of ""ramping up"" again.  I just completed the 1 mile. While I kept up fine, I did actually feel the burn in my muscles and did sweat. Now, if you have been exercising at all or have reasonable fitness, this video will be too easy for you.

4125464,4,B003HC9JIW,This is a great way to get started on an exercise program.  I love getting my walk done in my home.  I hate walking in the wind or rain and cold so this is a great way to get the best walk.,1361232000,2,189,3.4761904761904763

4125466,4,B003HC9JIW,"This is a great series for people just starting to exercise or those who have health and knee problems that can't stand up to more rigorous cardio.  As someone who is overweight, but not in horrible shape, I found the 1-mile a little too short to work up much of a seat.  It definitely got my blood flowing and was a nice, short walk when my time was limited, but I recommend Leslie's 3+ mile videos for those that want to push themselves harder.  This video is still valuable for when I have limited time but still want to exercise a bit, so it's not without merit.

Leslie does a good job of bringing all your muscles into play in your lower body through side steps and knee lifts.  I hadn't realized just how weak my outer thigh muscles (fascia?) were until doing fast-paced side steps for an extended period of time.  Like always, Leslie shows the viewer how to modify and intensify the workout by crouching down more and picking up your feet.  You can also maximize the workout by adding hand weights to the arm movements or even ankle weights.

Some people have commented that they find Leslie a little grating with her quirky comments and hyper-positive attitude, but I enjoy it.  She makes me smile and feel motivated and that's great.  I can easily stay on top of this workout and feel like I'm excelling in it which is better than some of the Jillian Michaels' videos that I feel like I can't yet keep up with.  (I'm not the most coordinated person in the world, I admit.)",1360627200,2,1482,4.431734317343174

4125469,5,B003HC9JIW,"I love this workout and all Leslie Sansone workouts.  It is simple, but is a great workout.  She is encouraging without being annoying.

4125476,5,B003HC9JIW,"The 2 mile walk is perfect for me. Takes 32 minutes. I use it on my computer and watch TV or a TV program On Demand on my computer at the same time (minimizing Leslie). I turn off the sound as I can follow along without her talking, which gets 'old' after a while. It seems to be a good enough aerobic exercise for me as I've been using it for about 3 years, several times a week. I like it so much better than walking on the treadmill for a few reasons. First, I don't have to worry about falling off. Second, the treadmill with incline causes me to have a backache. Third, I like that it is varied and not just one repetitive step. Leslie has me using my arms too, walking forward and backward, side to side, kickbacks, knee lifts, kicks, etc. If it's too hard for you, you can just do the walking in place for awhile, or go faster or slower than Leslie's pace. This works for me, but probably not enough of a challenge for a younger exercise enthusiast. It's nice to have the 1 mile walk option, which is 20 minutes, though it's too easy for me now.",1359849600,,1052,4.136585365853659

Those were the only exercises I did, apart from walking outside in nice weather. I didn't keep it up, however, and now I'm starting again. I couldn't find my old DVDs, but I've been very happy with this one so far. I'm 54 and in good health, but was definitely out of breath after doing the one mile walk the first time.

I hadn't exercised regularly for 7 years and decided it was time to get back into it. I started with the 1 mile walk every other day the first week, then 6 days the second week, then started the 2 mile walk 6 days a week. After about a month I discovered I was pregnant and was very comfortable continuing with this exercise program throughout my pregnancy. I added in other videos of Leslie's as I needed more interest, but continued to enjoy this 2 mile walk. I was able to keep up the 6 days a week pace even in my 9th month.

All the while, she is chatting with you as if the two of you were in the room together, which really serves to capture your attention and motivation.

I had been taking an exercise class, but on the recommendation of a good friend, decided to give these workouts a try.  They use virtually the same steps and pace that the class does, and I don't have to drive 15 miles and pay for each class!

So far I've been walking 5 days a week. I've only been at it for three weeks, but for me, doing any exercise for more than two days in a row, or even continuing through the weekend is HUGE. I've been renting the 1&2 and 3 mile walks from the Instant Videos on a weekly basis, but I've decided to purchase the DVD soon.

These are not the most exciting or challenging workouts I've ever done, but I always feel good after I've done it. Leslie talks through most of the workouts as usual, but she is encouraging and her cues are almost always spot on. These particular walks only feature Leslie, which I happen to prefer. I enjoy these walks because they are so easy to follow. I do find that the one mile walk is a little too short for me, but if I ever needed to break up my 30 minutes of activity, the 1 mile walk is perfect for that. I find that the two mile walk is perfect for my schedule, and most days it speeds right by. I'll admit there are some days I wish that clock wasn't in the upper left hand corner!

I picked up Zumba about a few months ago, hoping to get myself motivated to consistently exercise again, and while I do enjoy that series, I just don't find myself sticking to it the way I can with these workouts.

I walk everyday either on the treadmill in my garage or in the neighborhood. I turned to this DVD because it was 100 degrees outside and i did not want to miss a day of working out. I did the 2 miles and it felt great. I was surprised at how fast the 2 miles went. I like the time dials and the mile markers to show how far I have gone. Great work-out. Good for beginners. Simple steps and you can go as fast or slow as you want. Leslie Sansone is a great motivator. I like the one and one. Tomorrow I will try it on mute with Zumba music.

Edit--------> fast forward 6 months  This video was the spring board for me to finally getting a gym membership and losing the weight. i have lost 100 lbs and now want to lose another 50. The video got me into making the habit of working out everyday. After 3 months of doing this video, I was ready to try something different.

I always had excuses for why I didn't have the time or the resources. I finally decided no more excuses! This DVD was the perfect option for something that I can do as a mom of young kids even when its nasty weather outside. I started this a week ago and am still on the 1 mile walk. I thought it would be super easy. Silly me! It isn't just a fast walk. There are sidesteps, kicks, knee lifts, and other variations of those movements. The first 5 minutes or so is the warm up and then they up the beat of the music. For the next 10 minutes or so it is a fast paced rhythm that really gets your heart rate up and the first few days I was starting to wonder if I would be able to make it through the whole thing. Just as I was thinking I couldn't go much longer, the cool down began. It goes for approximately the last 5 minutes of the walk. The whole 1 mile is 20 minutes and just right for someone getting started with exercising. Here's to healthier lungs, heart, bones, and everything else that exercise helps!",1328054400,5,1153,4.083700440528634
4125531,5,B003HC9JIW,"Great simple workout, easy to follow and not boring. Leslie mixes up the moves and gets the whole body involved with side steps, knee lifts, oblique twists and arm movement, making the walk more intense than a typical stroll around the block. Her words are informative and encouraging. I like the timer on the upper left of the screen, it is motivating to watch the clock count down. You have the option to take a quick 20 minute 1 mile walk or a longer 40 minute 2 mile walk. This option makes me feel good about telling myself I'll do a second 20 minute walk later on that day, since I'm not always up for doing 40 minutes at once. The 20 minutes includes the warm-up, the walk, and the stretch, so it's good to get in and get out all in 20 minutes. The pace of the music increases and decreases along with the workout's intensity and cool down, so it's a good way to keep you matched up to Leslie's speed. I would suggest this to anyone who likes to walk and who is looking to do something rather than nothing at all for their workout. I travel a lot for work so this DVD is great for me. Now I have no more excuses! I can take a walk no matter the weather or location!",1327881600,5,1172,4.144736842105263

I contacted Leslie's website to order the DVD from exercise-tv, only to learn that they were not allowed to sell it.  I got on the Amazon site and of course they had it along with all the other exercise-tv workout shows.

4125542,5,B003HC9JIW,"Made for Exercise TV in conjunction with The American Heart Association, ""Start! Walking with Leslie Sansone"" contains two indoor walking exercising programs: a one mile ""gentle"" walking program and a two mile ""brisk walk"". Each walk is hosted by Leslie by herself and features a clock in the left-hand corner of the screen that counts down the minutes left in the program. Also included on the DVD are five mini walk/workout tips (Leslie mentions in the introduction a three mile walk but that is not included on this DVD).

One Mile Gentle Walk:

This is a nice energetic one mile walk that takes about 21 minutes (Leslie says it is a 15 minute walk but the 21 minutes include the warm-up, cool down, and stretches). The routine includes Leslie's four basic steps: walk in place, side steps, kicks, and knee lifts, as well as kick backs, walking forward and back, and upper arm movements. What I like about this one mile walk is that Leslie incorporates a few movements that make this a gentle yet somewhat brisk walk: double side steps, double knee lifts, and tap outs. Not only does it make you feel good about the one mile exercise but helps prepare you for some of the steps when you are ready to tackle the two mile walk.

Two Mile Brisk Walk:

This is a nice two mile indoor walk (it takes approximately 32 minutes to do) that gets your heart rate up and makes you feel like you've accomplished something at the end of the routine. Again it features Leslie's four basic steps as well but also adds in kick backs; double side steps; single knee lifts/double knee lifts/four knee lifts; side steps where you put your heel down in front; and tap outs that turn into lunges. Each mile takes about 15 minutes to complete and the second mile is more intense than the first. The cool down period lasts about five minutes including two and a half minutes of stretches. All of this makes for a nice brisk exercise program.

Five mini walk/workout tips:

These tips include Beginner Stretching; Brisk Walk Alternative for Beginners; Easy Walk to Stay Flexible; What Makes a Power Walk; and Anatomy of a High Knee March. Each of these is very brief (less than three minutes) and I really didn't find any useful information included.

Summary:

""Start! Walking with Leslie Sansone"" contains two very good exercise routines for both beginners and long-time Leslie Sansone fans.",1304985600,27,2372,4.71256038647343

I was doing the 4 mile super challenge, but found many excuses to get out of an hour work-out. There is a clock in the corner that counts off the minutes, so you know exactly how much more torture you have to endure.  I work up a sweat and feel that 2 miles, (3o minutes), benefits my health.  I have managed to do this workout for a few months now and have only skipped a day here and there. I have 3 of Leslie's DVDs and feel this one is the best fit for me.  The music is a little better...although it does in the middle repeat music from the super challenge.

4125548,5,B003HC9JIW,"Yes, I hate exercise and don't believe in diets. I am not perky, sporty or preppy. I also don't believe in diets or the whole diet culture. After my 50th birthday, however, I decided there were some absolutes I believe that I wasn't putting into practice. In 3 months, I've eliminate almost all refined products, fast food and soda. I eat simpler and healthier, while retaining a love of food and cooking. I'm losing weight, while not making that the goal. The last piece was exercise. I know my body needs to move to be healthy, but I can't afford a gym membership and know I just wouldn't go if I had one. Ditto on a treadmill. Where I live, it's either too hot or too cold most of the year for regular walks. I got this DVD, thinking the 20 minute workout was doable. I teach remedial reading and tell my students they could do wonders if they could read for 20 minutes a day, so I decided to put my money where my mouth is, so to speak.

I've done this video only 4 times, but I've done it 4 times in a row and am making it into a routine. I like Leslie and I usually hate exercise gurus. They're either too perky, or condescending. Leslie is neither. She's genuinely cheerful and supportive, without being so annoying, I want to throw something at her! I'm going to stick with the one mile until it becomes easy, then move on to the 2 mile and see where I go from there. My advice to anyone who's trying to be healthy, but feels the task is too daunting: start with this and just walk-walk-walk!",1301011200,37,1500,4.2631578947368425

She makes it fun and enjoyable to walk and especially not having to leave the comfort of your home (just stand in front of the TV and begin).

My husband does it every night after work, and we both feel this is a perfect amount of time and energy after a long day at work.  It is low enough impact that our knees, and other joints aren't being abused by jumping around or hopping etc; but tough enough to build strength and muscle on our couch potato, over 50 'back-ends' as Leslie says, lol.  --  Don't let the 1 mile one fool you either, boy howdy!  She starts all nice and sweet and you get to thinking she's going to cut you a bit of slack because it's only 1 mile... but HA!!! you're going to sweat and that's just the way it is!  --  I can't say enough how great this DVD is,  both the 1 AND 2 mile; so I'll just quit now so you can go order it!",1299110400,79,859,3.9190751445086707

I would highly recommend this DVD for beginners.  If you are further advanced, you could still use this DVD, since there is a second part that really revs up the walking and gets your heart rate up.

4125554,5,B003HC9JIW,"This video was recommended for me by a weight-loss expert, in a program initiated by my insurance company.  I am a 58-year-old who is diabetic and trying to lose about 40 pounds.

Prior to using this video, I normally walked about 1/4 mile a day, to and from work. I sit at the computer a lot, and consider myself ""out of shape."" With my diabetes and osteoporosis, the recommendation is to walk. At the same time, weather in our area is a bummer, too hot, too cold, rain, snow, you name it, it keeps ME from going out on the streets. Come to think of it, very little puts me out on the streets in public to exercise, so I guess this is a good idea.

Before I began, I watched the short series of Mini Workouts/Tips. I was somewhat disappointed that the one called ""Brisk Walk Alternative for beginners"" was a very short description of how to walk, not a timed walk. So I began with the 20 minute beginners walk. I lasted 10 minutes and 20 seconds - without doing a lot of the extras Leslie recommended to ""power up"" our walk. The second day I lasted a bit longer, and so on.

She DOES carefully demonstrate each of the four moves (basic walking, side to side, kick, and knee lift) as you begin. She later adds in other moves, both hands and legs, which give you a full-body workout.

I ran the video on my computer and needed about a 4 foot by 4 foot area to ""walk"" with Leslie, so you can perform these walks in any location. I wear my ""jammies,"" but do put on healthy footwear before I begin, since this is higher impact and you need good shoes to walk.

Once you have the basic moves down, you can turn off the sound and listen to your own music, OR you can continue to listen to Leslie and the music that she incorporates to help you keep your pace.

The video allows you to do the 20 minute Beginners walk (1 mile), the 30 minute Intermediate/Brisk Walk (2 miles) OR you can do both (for 50 minutes). For anyone who wants a good aerobic workout, this is a very good, well-rounded video.

If you are limited in mobility, you can actually sit in a chair and do your ""walking"" and movements and get a more limited, but still beneficial workout. You just have to be able to move your legs back and forth like you were walking.

If you are AT ALL like me, you will need a reminder. Buying the video won't help you to get fit. You actually have to open it, put it in your DVD player, and YES, you have to walk along with it. (sigh)",1298073600,231,2430,4.1862955032119915

I like the Prevention ones and especially the Denise Austin ones, but nothing compares to this Leslie Sansone video!  She is very natural and she is all by herself in the video.  I thought I would not like that, but I really prefer that she is by herself and not with a group like the other trainers, because you feel that she is a personal trainer talking to you.  Again, she is very natural and explains the benefits of each exercise.  The video has a 20-minute easy walk and a 32-minute brisk walk.  None of them are difficult and I think they're both great for beginners (like me).  And the fact that the video is endorsed by the American Heart Association makes me like it even better.

I am a 58 year old man who was in terrible physical condition. At my heaviest weight 240lb but my blood pressure has always been awesome, and blood Cholesterol has always been really good and my current weight is 165lb thanks to Atkins and my wife. The only exercising I have done was running and weight lifting 30 years ago in High School. I had a cute bartender friend at a restaurant I was working in told me she taught an aerobics class and if I would like to go, hell yes. After the class using leg weights and hand weights, I thought I was going to die. Every muscle in my body hurt for 2 months and I was so embarrassed about never told my friends.
Every muscle in my body hurt for 2 months -- does anybody reading this review know what that was or does it have a name?
My 500lb daughter started walking outdoors 2 months and is doing better. which made me realize. I needed to fix my badly out of shape body or it would be a point of no return. My wife goes to Gold's gym that works for her, I knew about my self and all the watching eyes, wouldn't work for me. My best bet was working out at home, using a DVD in my living room. I searched a long time looking for an easy, beginners tape one that I could do as an out of shape older man. The only exercise tapes I was familiar with was Jane Fonda read many reviews but decided she would be to advanced for me. Looking through the most highly rated DVD, finally chose -Start! Walking At Home with Leslie Sansone: Beginner/Intermediate - 1 & 2 Mile Walk. I bought the DVD on 3/21/18 stalled for 2 weeks finally put the tape in and selected Play All I watched an introduction and started the 1 mile walk. The walk is about 20 minutes, broken down to, warm-up, brisk exercise, cool down and stretching. Leslie Sansone does suggest you do it twice a day everyday for a really healthy heart. My first day I only lasted 9 minutes, I felt very uncoordinated, I was weak, could barely get my leg out to kick. My second day I was better lasted the entire section, but kicking and knee lifts needed work I notice every time I exercise now my veins in my arms stick out. After a week I really was feeling stronger, faster and more coordinated. I have exercised once a day everyday for a month but today I will start doing the session twice per day every day as she recommends.",1525478400,,2430,4.19017094017094

8396965,4,B003HC9JIW,"A friend lent me this video to use following a recent injury (slight sprain) to my right knee. I was worried I would re-injure myself doing this video, but when she was doing steps that I felt might not be good for me at this time, I just walked in place, and kept my arms moving. For her part, Leslie is good about repeating,'If you can't do something, just go back to walking."" Amazingly I worked up a good sweat and got my heart rate going even modifying the moves to that most basic. I was impressed. I will definitely do this again and again. I have been dieting but hit a frustrating long plateau. I am sure this will help. Guess I am going to have to by my own soon. Really impressed. Easy to do. Good Workout.
I also like her personality and find her motivating rather than annoying as I have with other narrators in similar Walk DVD. So far, i like Leslie the best!",1523750400,,874,4.208333333333333
