4007654,1,B002WNU0OY,"First, I DID NOT LIKE THE SUBTITLES and the DVD split in half coming out of player. I have since ordered the Wedding on a single DVD from a different provider.
I was disappointed not to see Julia Stiles in the second one...the chemistry was not there (although it was good)the third, Honeymoon, was a bigger disappointment because Luke Mably was replaced:( That was like Robert Pattinson  being replaced in Twilight! The Prince & Me franchise could have been bigger than Twilight! We need romantic comedies in the world today.",1285372800,,526,4.844444444444444

4007694,2,B002WNU0OY,"The first movie was delightful. both sequels kind of suck. There was nothing to congratulate regarding the scripts, except, perhaps, their predictability. Actually, the second movie wasn't nearly as bad as the third. I do not like to trash someones work, but the sequels",1434240000,,270,5.159090909090909

4007710,5,B002WNU0OY,One of our favorite movies is The Prince & Me so we wanted to see the second and third movies in the series to enjoy. She saw them and then said that we needed to have them in our collection.,1425859200,,191,3.8
4007711,3,B002WNU0OY,Just finished watching and for an unknown movie and sequel it kept me entertained,1423094400,,81,4.857142857142857
4007712,5,B002WNU0OY,"I now have all 4 movies and have thoroughly enjoyed watching a movie and not being scared, frustrated or whatever.  Of course the ending is going to be that ""they lived happily ever after"".  Underlying all the fluff is a good story of how to fit in being who you are.  That speaks for both royals and ""norms"" in these movies.  I just enjoyed the adventures in all of the stories and the transitions in characters was well done and almost seamless unless you are a purist from the first movie, ""The Prince & Me"".  Their personalities stayed the same.  The movies are funny and predictable but are action filled with romance and a mystery to be solved.",1422230400,2,650,4.466101694915254

4007723,4,B002WNU0OY,liked this but not quite as much as the first one: I think that part of the reason was the change in characters. I really liked the characters in the first movie.,1407974400,,162,4.09375
4007724,5,B002WNU0OY,Great movie's got it very quick,1404259200,,31,4.333333333333333
4007745,5,B002WNU0OY,"we had problem with first DVD  it would not play the second movie. but you remedied that for us.
the girls love it and the 4 movie also",1402012800,,135,3.8214285714285716
4007746,2,B002WNU0OY,"Movie 1 of the two set:  While Luke Mabley is a great actor, the movie was ""slap-sticky.""  I love romantic comedies, but not silly ones.  The original one with Julia Stiles and Luke Mabley was very well done.  The acting was super and the story line good.  I would have liked a better ending, but it did end up better than what the original script encompassed.  The original script wanted to make this romantic comedy into a somewhat tragedy.  This second movie was just way too silly for me.  So much so that I really don't know what to say to give my review.  I guess I could say it was plain preposterous!

Movie 2 of the two set:  The second movie in this ""two pack"" edition, was a little more sensible, but not by much.  To say these were a continuation of the original story is not so.  IMO they were three separate movies.  Changing actors for the sequels just doesn't get it.  To do so changes the whole feel of the story, especially when the continuing stories are played out in silly ways.  For the above reasons, I rated the  two sequels much lower than I would rate the original.",1400112000,,1091,4.321782178217822

4007749,3,B002WNU0OY,"Every girl no matter her age dreams of her prince charming. To dream of living in a castle, the fairy tale wedding and honeymoon.  I love the way they helped the village when they needed it. Good chick flick.",1385596800,,208,4.333333333333333

4007754,5,B002WNU0OY,"I have always heard of this DVD and it was a joy to see it for myself.  Having the 2 movies together is a great idea however, I did not think the the DVD was clearly marked as to which side to watch first. It should have been clear that it was a 2-sided DVD. I ended up watching the honeymoon before the wedding.  I could have stopped it but I was to caught up in it to switch it at the time.",1362096000,,392,3.710843373493976
4007765,4,B002WNU0OY,"Have to say that for an old woman this was not hard on the eyes.  Intriging, wholesome and fun to watch.",1361059200,,104,3.9523809523809526
4007766,3,B002WNU0OY,"Arrived in a timely manner and in good shape.  I've watched these movies online several times so decided to by.  DVD is double sided (one movie on each side).  There is a label on the top of the DVD telling you which movie is on side A and side B, but there is no indication of which side is side A or B.  I just guessed that the side with the writing was side A, but don't be fooled the movies are reversed.  No biggie though... I already knew about this from another individual's post.  Don't affect the playing of the movie at all.",1360800000,,534,4.086538461538462
4007767,5,B002WNU0OY,"Purchasing the double feature saved me money, but it was worth it. The quality of both movies was great. And the story line plays great in each movie. I would recommend this to everyone.",1360454400,,186,4.5
4007768,5,B002WNU0OY,I ENJOYED WATCHING IT.  IT WAS REFRESHING TO WATCH A PICTURE WITHOUT VIOLENCE OR BAD LANGUAGE.  I LOOK FORWARD TO OTHERS MOVIES WITH THE SAME STANDARD..,1359676800,,152,4.8076923076923075
4007769,3,B002WNU0OY,"I really loved The Prince and Me, so I ordered this. After I ordered,though,I found out that most of roles were going to be played by different actors than in the original movie, so despite being a bit sad, I knew what to expect. However, after watching both The Royal Wedding and The Royal Honeymoon, I would have to say I'm not completely impressed, though both movies are well-made. Julia Stiles was a great Paige in the original and Luke Mably played a perfect match when paired with her! There's just no chemistry between Luke and Kam Heskin, and yet, he was definetly a better King Eddie than Chris Geere any day...so my advice is..Let the original Prince and Me stand alone!!",1353196800,8,682,4.598360655737705
4007770,5,B002WNU0OY,"This movie series is very good. It keeps you wanting to see what is going to come next. I highly recommend. Loved it. The cd was a little confusing at first with what movie is on what side. I thought on the main menu they would give you a choice for the two movies, but no you have to flip the cd over. It would have been helpful if the cd said this. Other then that very good and fun to watch.",1353024000,,394,3.817073170731707
4007771,1,B002WNU0OY,"Finally got around to watching and to my disappointment enclosed was the Honeymoon which is the third movie to the series not the first and second as advertised.  False advertisement.  Tried to notified Amazon and because it is past the return date will not even give me a link to let them know about the packaging error.  What a shame, I guess service has a time limit.  So please do not wait to check things out completely not just the case but inside contents as well.",1352764800,3,471,4.441860465116279
4007772,4,B002WNU0OY,This was the perfect movie to watch during Hurricane Sandy.  People meet difficulties and overcome them. Not a challenging thinking or social issue movie really. Light entertainment.  And happy endings in both stories.,1352592000,,218,5.575757575757576
4007773,3,B002WNU0OY,"The Prince and Me was INCREDIBLE!! Julia Styles and Luke Mably were dynamite together, I loved the last scene with the passionate kiss.  I watched Edvard's and Paige's face so many times. The acting was Emmy worthy. I was hoping for a continuation.  The chemistry was missing with Edvard and Paige. Luke Mably is a incredible actor to pull this one off, (The Royal Wedding).  Whoever did these sequels knew nothing of fan loyalty for the original actors, if they had, the trilogy would have been wonderful.  I was really let down.  I bought them without reading the reviews first.  The only thing I liked about the Royal Honeymoon was the actor who played Eddie bore a striking resemblance to the real Prince William.  The plot was so unbelivable.",1316476800,,747,4.744186046511628
4007774,5,B002WNU0OY,"I liked the movies. I thought they were good. I thought I would mind a change in the actor who played Prince Edvard, but I did not. I would like to have seen more of Jonathan Firth. He is really good and funny besides. Overall I thought the movies very good.",1296000000,2,258,4.078431372549019
