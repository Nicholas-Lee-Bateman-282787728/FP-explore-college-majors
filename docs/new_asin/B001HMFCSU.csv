3630531,3,B001HMFCSU,"ECHO BRIDGE's FANTASY/ADVENTURE: 4 MOVIE COLLECTOR'S SET offers some so-so made-for-TVers with an average running time of 3 hours. This mfr. (aka ""Platinum Disc"") shows a faint watermark on-screen every so often. Their transfers  on more recent works such as these are decent (although not perfect).

This package is certainly worthwhile if you can catch a good deal on it.

3630533,5,B001HMFCSU,"I recently found these four films at a local store. I've always wanted to see Curse of King Tut's Tomb, the cover sucks you in. It looks like a crappy horrr film but it was on the Hallmark channel. It's a basic poor mans version of The Mummy and Indiana Jones, even though it reminds me more of the Mummy. It's a long film but I enjoyed what I saw. Take this into account, four films each are almost four hours long. One movie per side, the entire 3-4 hour film. It's a good deal and all them were on Hallmark channel.",1232409600,7,518,4.088235294117647

8308962,4,B001HMFCSU,"THE CURSE OF KING TUT'S TOMB
Thousands of years ago, the great Child King Tutankhamen ruled. Free-spirited archaeologist Danny Fremont is certain that if found, King Tut's Emerald Tablet would hold the power to control the world. Unfortunately, the only one who believes Fremont is his nemesis archaeologist Morgan Sinclair, a member of a secret society who wants the tablet to harness unspeakable evil on the world and will stop at nothing to get it. With the help of a crackerjack team that includes the doubting Egyptologist Dr. Barakat, Fremont ventures into the Valley of the Kings, toward Tut's tomb, nearer the portal to another world, and closer to the truth behind a mystery that will change the world forever--or end it.
My review: This Hallmark Original has some pretty decent production values, despite its' low-budget. It's an entertaining fantasy movie that combines elements of The Mummy and Indiana Jones in a(as others have mentioned) 'cheesy B-movie' kind of way. I loved the film myself. However, due to the fact that this was a mini-series when it first aired, it does seem to go on a little longer than it should. That shouldn't deter you from giving it a chance.

THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE
As the luxury liner Poseidon slices through the waters of an ocean storm, the greatest danger is already on board--a terrorist with an explosive message for the world. Detonated on New Year's Eve, the blast capsizes the ship leaving a motley few - the madman among them - struggling for survival in this upside-down life-and-death drama.
My review:Quite possibly my most favorite film out of the collection. This made-for-TV remake of Irwin Allen's 1972 disaster-movie of the same title, The Poseidon Adventure updates the story of the capsized cruise ship and is, actually, better for it. Rutger Hauer, Peter Weller, Adam Baldwin, Steve Guttenberg, and stellar cast of others make this remake a powerful one. I definitely recommend this one be viewed.

MERLIN'S APPRENTICE
The great sorcerer Merlin has returned to Camelot, a kingdom now vulnerable to ill fates and war since the theft of the Holy Grail, its greatest gift and protection. With the help of Jack, an irascible young beggar-thief imbued with his own unruly magic, the fight against unknown dangers begins - to find the Grail, restore it to its rightful place, and bring Camelot back to its glory days.
My review:A sequel in name only, Merlin's Apprentice does-however- see the return of Sam Neill as Merlin himself. This movie takes place some 50 years later with Merlin waking from a long nap and has very little to do with the first film and has more of an alternate story timeline. While this movie is good for a fantasy film by itself, it is not good as a sequel to the first film. That's all I'm going to say about that.

BLACKBEARD
In the Golden Age of Piracy, at the dawn of the 18th century, Blackbeard stood out among the lawless rogues as the most fearsome and notorious seafarer of them all. He killed for the reputation, and his reputation has become legend. Now, for the first time, comes the true story of pirate Edward Teach, the man who terrorized the seas.
My review:I'm not big on pirate films, I must admit. Treasure Island, the Pirates of The Caribbean series & Cutthroat Island are about the only pirate films I've ever really liked. This film, however, has changed my mind about them. I absolutely loved Blackbeard. It's a real shame that we don't see more films such as this in this day and time. Much like Westerns, you hardly see them made anymore and made this good.

Overall review:Sound purchase here. Definitely recommend this for lovers of Hallmark films.",1371081600,,3659,4.8496

Merlin,s apprentice is part 2 of Merlin teaches the boy how to use his powers.  black beard well about the most famous pirate.  the curse of king tut's tomb is about this guy that bring back from the dead the Egyptian evil and the people that are there to rescue the day will later have to fight against the evil.  all 4 action packed films.  i recommenced.",1344038400,2,524,4.350515463917525
