3659087,1,B001JP6504,"Plot non-withstanding, the actual quality of the movie is awful. There are multiple times where you see the frames catch and flip, or the movie ""skips"", and the sound is horrible even for an old film.
If you have prime, go ahead and watch for free, but don't pay for it.",1440201600,2,270,4.313725490196078
3659088,3,B001JP6504,"OK early 60's Italian-made, English-dubbed adventure flick.  I am only giving this film three stars because I generally like sword-and-sandal and period adventure movies, which this is.  A group of women are stuck on the women's section of the hellish Devil's Island.  They are subjected to horrendous conditions, back-braking work while chained up, and suffer unwanted sexual advances from the guards and particularly the warden.  But eventually good guy? pirates come along to relieve the women's suffering.  My complaint is the Synergy DVD release.  It is absolutely awful.  The film starts in progress and there are no credits.  There is virtually no color.  Instead it is tinged in a reddish color and the picture is not clear.  It is rather blurry.  The Something Weird VHS copy I once had was no better but it was slightly longer.  I once saw this film on TV in the 70's but I barely remember the quality of the broadcast since all I had was a black-and-white television.  If ever a movie needed emergency surgery re-mastering, this is the one.  I hope a cleaned up, re-mastered DVD, or at least DVD-R is released very soon.",1437264000,3,1131,4.853403141361256

3659090,3,B001JP6504,"There is no Color as such,everything is pink, NO CREDITS on the beginning at all. the film just starts.

The first 21 minutes as a portion of the screen blacked out at the top of the picture.
Full Screen Pan & Scan , soft focus.,nothing to recommend it

The film itself, is quite good,women prisoners on Devils Island ,being treated badly by the guards.

 Buy it by all means, but beware the condition of the print.",1297814400,6,415,4.421052631578948
3659091,2,B001JP6504,"""Women of Devil's Island"" is a turgid and trashy, dull and dubbed Euro-drama from 1962 about French women in enormous dresses imprisoned on Devil's Island and their cunning plans to escape. The Lieutenant in charge of the installation is a hedonistic sadist who whips the women and makes them pan for gold in an alligator-infested swamp. Periodically a woman gets eaten, but most of the swamp time revolves around singing in French until the audience begins to go insane.

Eventually a Captain comes to take command of the installation: he is handsome and humane, and the girls adore him, particularly Martine, whose sister the Lieutenant killed in cold blood. The tensions obviously revolve on two axes: the Captain versus the Lieutenant, and the women's plots to escape. Due to a traitor in their midst, the girls' plans are foiled, the new Captain turns out to be an idealistic pirate of sorts, and the gold is all stolen. Oh, and the Captain gets to wrestle an alligator.

The remainder of the film is one implausible misadventure after another, culminating in a huge, though laughably fake, firefight, and a rescue for all the good guys by the pirate ship. We discover that the pirates need the gold to fund the revolution, as they only care about equality, freedom, and justice.

The whole film is pretty smarmy, and very bland. The dubbing is poor (it was originally in Italian except for the singing, which was in French, apparently), the acting is very wooden, and there is constant swelling orchestral music. The print is absolutely wretched with enormous flaws, splices, tears, and incorrect positioning in the vertical plane onscreen. The film was made in 1962, but has obviously not been well preserved as the color balance is among the worst in memory: it's basically now in sepia with occasional hints of aqua.

This is a kindler, gentler women-in-prison movie that is relatively inoffensive, but has nothing to particularly recommend it either, except maybe the alligator wrestling. It is now available on DVD as part of a couple of different multi-movie disc sets.",1224028800,12,2081,4.971264367816092

8313385,2,B001JP6504,"During the French Revolution, young women are shipped to Devil's Island where they are forced to pan for gold among the gators and occasionally perform some comfort services for special privileges. Then when a new warden shows up, things change.

These are English speaking women who sing in French. The film I saw was on a 50 DVD set and not restored, although I don't think watching a restored version would have made a prison girl film without a shower scene, medical exam, or change of clothes any better.

Sadly this version even when it was made would of been drive-in caliber or a bad ""B"" movie.

8313387,3,B001JP6504,"old technology film but an interesting adventure story.  Disregards the realities of the ""French Revolution"" in which the Wholly Roman Umpire's puppet Napoleon guillotined virtually the entirety of the upper class while leaving the thieving preachers of the felony tax evading slave mongering ""religion"" gang untouched. But the film makes it appear there was at least some benefit for the ""Women of Devil's Island"" from the efforts of the revolutionaries.",1478736000,,455,5.5
