It deals with the subject matter in a tasteful, sensitive and intense way and although it  by no means justifies necrophilia it does offer us an insight into one of  the reasons why it is done and leads us to have some sort of understanding  and sympathy for the necrophile presented in this film.
The reason why I  am not giving it five stars is because I did not really like the style in  which it was shot; dark, slow and very very gloomy all throughout.  But  then how else are you to make a film which deals with such a morbid and  tabooed topic?",957139200,7,684,4.152671755725191

155723,5,0792899075,"I enjoyed this video.  It was a very accurate and sensitive portrayal of necrophilia, as well as paraphelias in general.  They did a good job in providing a basis by showing her experiences in puberty, and bringing it to  a climax in her first serious relationship's end and beginning, in her  adulthood. I also like the fact that they made it clear that it didn't  revolve around intercourse.  This may make it confusing to some viewers who  may want to inject their own ""in and out"" limitations, bringing  it down to just a way for the heroine to ""get off""...but that  just simply wasn't there. When explaining to her boyfriend who asked what  she does with the bodies, had it been as simple as sex, or even halfway  conventional, as far as mechanics, she would have said so.  She was not a  repressed person...but it was much more than that, and she was much more  than that. Unlike other movies, where the one cast as the ""perv""  is a one-dimensional monster, or a misunderstood beast, the main character  in this film is a whole person. The final conversation between her and her  boyfriend will haunt me forever.",946944000,6,1118,4.593908629441624

I didn't connect the dots until I got it home, I gave it a try because it sounded creepy and I have deep roots in the funeral business. The best thing I can say is it's only 79 minutes. My finger hovered ""at the ready"" over EJECT for the entire flick. It's pretty low budget to boot. The casket props looked like leftovers from an old horror flick (trust me!) and the embalming school scene was shot at an empty junior college.

155749,4,0792899075,"** This review contains spoilers. **

Sandra Larson has always been fascinated by death, especially as a sensory experience. As a child, she created rituals to bury dead animal that drove off her only childhood friend. These rituals were to her the only proper way to honor the dead. In college, she works at a flower shop, which inevitably leads her to Wallis Funeral Home, where she decides to work and study embalming. This is also where her obsession with death culminates in becoming a necrophiliac. During her study of embalming in college, Sandra meets Matt and impulsively decides to be completely open about her odd sexual proclivities. He becomes obsessed with her, trying to find out why she feels  the way she does about the dead and why he isn't enough. How far can their relationship last? How far will Matt go in search of answers and how much can Sandra feel for a living person?

I saw this movie a few years and ago and was completely fascinated with it. Although necrophilia is obviously disturbing and taboo, this isn't a film that wants to to disgust or repel, like Cerda's Aftermath or the German Nekromatik films. Some may find it boring because it doesn't have the in-your-face gore and extremely disgusting scenes that these other films have. At its core, it's a love story. Sandra is a normal, every day girl, for the most part. She really could be anyone. Her appearance is normal and her only weird aspect (besides the obvious) is that she doesn't interact with people much. The greatest part of the film is that Sandra isn't portrayed as a horrible, grotesque monster, which would have been very easy to do. She doesn't have sex with corpses because she's kinky or wants some sort of power over them, but because she sees it as a consensual spiritual experience. She believes there is still an energy and vitality in them after death and she can release and feel it with her love. Her actions are compared to that of the funeral director, who she discovers is also a necrophiliac. He prefers little boys (adding one taboo on top of another), obviously for personal pleasure, and reasons that they can't feel anything anyway. Sandra is horrified by it because it's a desecration of the dead, while she celebrates and respects those she is with. Molly Parker does a phenomenal job as Sandra, making her a sympathetic and sensitive character.

Matt is also an interesting character. He doesn't react as most people would when Sandra reveals her secret and he becomes obsessed with the reasoning behind it. He senses that she pulls away from their relationship. In an effort to be what she wants, he only succeeds in freaking her out and she holds him at an even greater distance than before. Although she has feelings for him, she's never been with anyone living and still feels drawn to dead people. His solution is to kill himself so he can be with her in a way she can connect with. The end scene is beautiful, haunting, and bitterweet.

Kissed is a wonderful film that shows necrophilia, an obviously distasteful subject, in an artful light. Sandra isn't condemned as monster. It acts as a character piece that shows the development of her fascination of death from childhood. It's a brave film that is easy to condemn, but shows this taboo in an unexpected way.",1329177600,,3292,4.718260869565217

155755,4,0792899075,"In most movies, necrophilia is either hinted about ('American Gothic') or used as a joke ('Dodgeball'). You rarely, if ever, see it portrayed onscreen. ""Kissed"" does just that. Instead of making the character a sick perverted person, the filmmakers actually present you with a character you come to like. This character is Sandra, played by Molly Parker (HBO's ""Deadwood""). As a child, Sandra develops a fascination with death that continues into adulthood. Once she gets a job at a funeral parlor and becomes an apprentice embalmer, she begins having sex with the cadavers. She doesn't do it to fulfill some kind of sick desire, but does it because it becomes a need. An experience she can't live without or explain. Then Sandra meets Matt (Peter Outerbridge), a person who indetifies with Sandra and shows no emotion when she reveals her secret to him. Instead, he becomes fascinated with the subject as well which leads to the final scene in the movie. The movie is haunting, but not disgusting or exploitive. No one who sees this movie should feel sickened by what Sandra is doing. It's not that what she's doing isn't disgusting, it's that the filmmakers don't make it look disgusting. Some of the reviews on the DVD proclaim the film to be poetic and provocative. It's both, but definitely the former. It's told very poetically, which is helped by Parker's voice-overs. Having only seen Molly Parker in ""Deadwood"" I'm impressed by how strong an actress she is. A lot of lesser actresses could've taken the dialogue and actions that occur in the film and made it campy. Parker nails everything dead-on (no pun intended...I'm serious, that was an accident). General audiences won't find this movie enjoyable; It's slow-moving and it's subject matter will most definitely steer people away. It's no masterpiece, but this is a movie that comes out of nowhere and hits you pretty hard.

155757,3,0792899075,"Director/producer/writer Lynne Stopkewich seems to be improving steadily. Finally, in this low-budget film, a professional ""feel"" is present most of the time.

The acting of the two stars--Molly Parker as Sandra Larson and Peter Outerbridge as Matt--is flawless. She appeared in Stopkewich's SUSPICIOUS RIVER and is probably best known as the elegant widow in HBO's series ""Deadwood""; he appeared in LUCKY NUMBER SLEVEN as Dumbrowski. A few of the other actors are adequate, but several come across as rather wooden and amateurish.

The basis of the plot is a Stephen-King-like premise: Ms. Parker's character believes that for a short while dead people's bodies still contain some sort of vital energy which is released if one ""loves"" them, allowing the living ""partner"" to know the individual, unique essences of these people to a degree otherwise impossible in human life. While working at a funeral home, Sandra has tested this many times before she meets Matt. When she tells him what she has been doing and why, he is intrigued and then wishes to confirm this for himself, but she refuses to take him to the funeral home after hours to do so. Can you guess HOW he is able to get around her refusal in order to discover whether she is right? (It makes ""sense"" in a way, but be warned: if somebody close to you has died violently in the last 3 or 4 years, you may not be ready for Matt's solution. You may never be ready.)

As for the necrophilia, ho---hum. It is ""tastefully depicted"" (as much as such a thing can be). Certainly some people will be too sensitive to deal with even the mention of the topic, but here it presented as a weird sort of SPIRITUAL THING and NOT some sort of kinky erotic turn-on for the audience--or some ghoulishly horrible act.",1146355200,7,1761,4.729641693811075
155758,5,0792899075,"This movie is based on a wonderful, transcendent short story by Barbara Gowdy that's called ""We So Seldom Look on Love"". It's a very faithful adaptation. The story and movie deal with a young woman's perceptions of the recently dead, the spiritual energy that they radiate, and her very special relations with the departed. The adoration of a body as its energy is blazing away from life to death is presented in such a way as to make the act known as necrophilia into something holy, a spiritual service to the departed, and an act of communion for the lover of the dead.

  This excerpt from the prologue of the story gives a good flavor for what you may expect in the film:

  ""When you die, and your earthly self begins turning into your

disintegrated self, you radiate an intense current of energy. There is

always energy given off when a thing turns into its opposite, when love, for

instance, turns into hate. There are always sparks at those extreme points.

But life turning into death is the most extreme of extreme points. So just

after your die, the sparks are really stupendous. Really magical and explosive.

  I've seen cadavers shining like stars. I'm the only person I've ever

heard of who has. Almost everyone senses something, though, some vitality.

That's why you get resistance to the idea of cremation or organ donation. 'I

want to be in one piece,' people say...  [but] no matter what you do - slice open the flesh, dissect everything, burn everything - you're in the path of a power way beyond your little

interferences.""

Seems fine to me - I mean there were plenty scenes of necrophilia so I don't know if it's cut or not. Of course if the DVD is really censored it'd be nice to see the original version but even like this the film delivers. Beforehand I thought it'd be either stupid or it'd be some kind of art-house dull stuff. I was wrong and slightly surprised. ""Kissed"" although is dealing with such an obscure, disturbing and hidden matter as necrophilia, is done very good. It's bright and for everybody. It's very sensual and erotic, exciting and serious at the same time. It's about true love although this love may seem strange to average people. It's not an exploitation flick and has nothing sleasy in it. It's very romantic and enchanting. You'll definately not regret watching it for I bet you haven't seen anything like that before.

Let me tell you upfront that you'd be making a huge mistake & missing out on a truly remarkable film which never really has gotten it's dues.

Molly Parker gives a full-bodied (no pun intended) performance as a young woman by the name of Sandra obsessed with deceased young men. It's as if our lead character Sandra can feel their dreams, their sadness, & is able to somehow make a connection with these expired young bodies as she later tells us. For some strange reason, this provides comfort & consolation I suppose for it eases her mind that she too will one day cross over as well.

To FURTHER complicate matters, Sandra meets a young college student who is as intrigued by her fascination with death as he is romantically attached to her. Needless to say, their relationship takes an awful turn as the film progresses.

Although quite sad & a bit eccentric, Kissed reminds of us how we fail to see while we are still in the world of the living. It seems as if we only notice certain things about ourselves or others after they have crossed over or left their earthly home. Many could argue or debate that we shouldn't be reminded through a controversial film such as this but then how could appreciate life anymore without it? Watch Kissed with an open mind & brace yourself once again as you hear the haunting music of Sarah McLachlan while the credits pass before our eyes.",1081296000,31,1550,4.548387096774194

Deeply erotic, but never grotesque when you really would expect it to be.  Here alone, the director has pulled quite a feat!
I had to see this when I first rented it (now I own it)-but I was afraid it would be too disturbing to take.  But surprisingly it felt like I was floating through the most spiritual dreamscape, and ultimately the triumphant Sarah McClaughlin music at the end resonated in me.

Molly Parker from the childhood has been fascinated with death. Working part-time at a funeral parlor, her obsession with the dead begins to consume her every thought and desire. It started with a dead bird when she was a little girl. She rubbed her body with a dead bird in front of her girlfriend and at that time, her period just started. Her girlfriend freaked out and ran away.
Her secret obsession, however, interferes with her burgeoning relationship with her boyfriend,Peter Outerbridge , who is a student at the doctorier degree at a college. She for the fist time had a boyfiriend and lost her virginity to him. The relationship goes on. But something is missing.
She had another relationship with corpses in the Funeral parlor. A lot of different dead males are her secret lovers. She secretly love them and with her dresses off, she actually had sex with them without actual intercourse. Now this part is kind of strange but Molly made it understandable by her own way. Her ceremony. Her strange dancing and being nude on top of male corpse's bodies.
Her boyfriend heard from her about it and little by little he becomes jealous about it. He thinks that she is not all into him.
He thinks that she loves corpse more then him. And that is because he is a living thing.
He even tried by dressing himself with suite and lies down in his bed pretending that he is dead and calls her. But she didn't buy it.
For her, he is just a living one.
Then the surprising ending.
Peter Outerbridge, Molly's biyfriend kills himself by hanging himself on the rope naked when Molly had a hunch and run to his house.
She witnessed his death but coudln't, haven't or even didn't stopped him. He faded away.
Then his corpse came to her funeral parlor.
Now Molly kisses him for the first time seriously to his lips with all her heart and soul without no doubt. He is all her's now. No one can interrupt her anymore. She got him in her own way toally whole heartedly.
The movie finished that way. And left alone, we as an audience didn't know how to react anymore.
IS this love? Donno. But one thing for sure is Molly fulfilled her appeite all right and sooner or later she has to let him go. She will find another dead corpse to love.

7792565,4,0792899075,"Kissed (Lynne Stopkewich, 1996)
[originally posted 23Jul2001]

Stopkewich, a production designer by trade, took a doozy for her first project behind the helm, an adaptation of Barbara Gowdy's ""We So Seldom Look on Love"" called Kissed.

Lifetime Original Movie veteran Molly Parker plays Sandra, a necrophiliac who gets her dream jobworking as a funeral home assistant. (I've found no conclusive evidence that Gowdy's story is based, however loosely, on the life of Karen Greenlee, but really... how often does this happen?) Early on, she finds herself pursued by Matt (fellow TV-flick veteran Peter Outerbridge), whose obsession with Sandra deepens as he attempts to understand and identify with the necrophiliac urge.

Outerbridge probably wasn't the best actor for this role, but the rest of the movie is quite well cast. Parker is wonderful, as is Natasha Morley (Hideaway), who plays her younger self. The funeral home's janitor, Jan (James Timmons, in his first and [to date] last film role), steals every scene he's in with impunity. This man needs more work, pronto. Similar to the casting, the script has its flaws (the main one is a decided overuse of voice-over narration), but there's a lot to like in it, anyway. Parker is excellent at deadpanning great lines; one can almost forgive the endless minutes of narration given Parker's voice, and the earnestness of her character. One wonders how many actresses could have pulled it off this well.

The movie's main problem is its pace, which is jerky at best. Long, languid scenes that stretch thirty seconds beyond where they should are followed by whirlwinds of activity without transition and vice versa too many times. After a while, the viewer begins to feel the existential version of motion sickness.
