8521967,5,B0008ENIJS,"As a low-budget horror fanatic, this compilation DVD is one of my most prized possessions. The bonus feature films by the Campbell Brothers (""Demon Summer,"" ""Midnight Skater"") more than compensate for the lack of material otherwise found in the ""Skinned Alive"" special edition. At $5.25, this two-disc set is much more affordable than purchasing each title individually, which would run you somewhere around $40.00. Though produced in entirely different time periods (""Skinned Alive"" in the mid-eighties, and the Campbell features in the early 2000's), the three films fit well into a collection- each sharing a ton of memorable gore effects, ambitious story lines, and a distinct touch of humor. It goes without saying that if you're looking for state of the art CGI and Oscar-caliber acting, you're barking up the wrong tree. However, if (like myself) you revel in the charm and integrity found in low-budget/home filmmaking, you will surely not be disappointed with this purchase.",1418428800,,983,5.3076923076923075
8521968,3,B0008ENIJS,"CONTENTS of SKINNED ALIVE 4 Movie Pack:

DEMON SUMMER--  Directors Andrew and Lucas Campbell both have roles in this gruesome story of a girl's murder that's gone unsolved for two decades and the curious high schoolers who inadvertantly set off more violence. Low budget amateurish imitation of Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead.""

MIDNIGHT SKATER-- Another gang of nosy kids tries to solve an on-campus murder. Written and directed by (guess who?) the Campbell brothers, who again appear.

SKINNED ALIVE--  A clan of backwoods crazies skins their victims before killing them.

SOMETHING TO SCREAM ABOUT-- The best item here is this documentary about nine 'B' grade horror movie actresses. Includes interviews, rare footage, photos and lots of film clips.

BRENTWOOD's 4-fers are nicely priced movie bundles. Video and sound quality of these digitally unrestored public domain films is generally fine. Discs are dual-side recorded.
