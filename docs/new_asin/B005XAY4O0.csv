An absolute ""TEN"" on the scales of rock documentaries.(or any documentaries for that matter!)  Doesn't contain one boring second. An absolute must have for any music  enthusiast.",932688000,6,275,5.066666666666666

There are not a lot of hills but it is a really fast, crazy pace. Good scenery and background music, and lots of good coaching by Paul on how to manage the ride and get the most out of it.",1350691200,,376,4.026666666666666

8590841,5,B005XAY4O0,"This is another amazing training video shot from a camera on the handlebars (but with no vibration!).  It has good music and can be used in several different ways. In this video you are in the middle of a group ride with all of the hand signals, conversation, and even wrong turns that usually accompany such a ride. You get the feel, as you train indoors in the winter, that you are actually with a bunch of riders in Nevada. This is much more enjoyable than watching people spin on trainers indoors, or outdoors for that matter. This is like you are actually riding this route.  I highly recommend this DVD.

Based on this video and the Anaerobic I video, I have ordered two more because they are that good.",1262822400,3,709,4.438461538461539
8590842,2,B005XAY4O0,Bought this for my husband for Christmas. Basically just a video shot from the front of a bike. OK - but I was disappointed with the quality. Hopefully my husband will be able to make it work for him.,1262131200,,200,4.153846153846154

8590844,1,B005XAY4O0,The quality of this video is bad. It really looks like somebody video taped the videos off a tv.,1199923200,,96,4.105263157894737
8590845,3,B005XAY4O0,"The DVD has a promising voyeuristic premise but goes off track almost immediately with a sequence of sex scenes that spare no time for foreplay and fly in the face of the ""erotica for women"" subtitle.  There is nothing erotic, much less sensuous, about seeing one couple after another slurp and sweat through the same unimaginative script.  Happily for those who might purchase it, the film is rescued by the last two vignettes.  Together, they show Candida at her exciting best.",1132617600,5,479,4.888888888888889
8590846,5,B005XAY4O0,"Pornography by definition is the depiction of erotic behavior (as in pictures or writing) intended to cause sexual excitement. When it comes to films, pornography is loosely divided into two parts, softcore pornography, in which the sexual unions are assumed to be simulated and hardcore pornography, in which copulation, fellatio and cunnilingus are graphically depicted in actual sex.

Amazon offers many of the softcore titles and I have even written Guides and Lists including dozens but until I came across Candida Royalle's Sex/Erotica for Women: (various titles), I was unaware that anything resembling hardcore porn was available.

The latest one I previewed was entitled ""Eyes of Desire, Part 1"". It was just as sexy and graphic as the first one I saw, ""One Size Fits All"" but for me the story didn't seem to flow as well. This film featured three well endowed women and four men and has voyeurism for a theme. Lisa (Missy) while staying with a friend in the hills of Los Angeles, gets turned on by viewing her friend having sex with her boyfriend, at his nearby pad, through a telescope. Soon she catches another couple and then she catches a stranger watching her watch them and I'll let you guess the rest. I liked Missy, she reminds me of Michelle Pfeiffer.

Unlike most adult films, Candida Royelle Sex/Erotica films are made by women, with women in mind. As far as hardcore is concerned this would probably be considered mild because there is nothing weird about the sex. No girl on girl and no sadomasochistic behavior, just straight sex. That's probably why it appeals to women and that's good enough for me.",1126310400,14,1625,4.880434782608695
8590847,5,B005XAY4O0,"It was the first porn film my wife actually liked. It gives you the plot of a good Cinemax adult show but also gives you all the juicy details and actual sex they can't show.

A graet couples film particularly if you like voyeurism.",1122422400,6,232,4.2727272727272725
