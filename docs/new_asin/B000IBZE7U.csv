It's worth watching once for curiosity.",1217030400,2,308,4.5
8144730,3,B000IBZE7U,This story is about two men raised together as youths but now as adults become adversaries each a master swordsman and each one willing to kill to advance their cost. This film was made by Koreans who have a totally different look and feel to thier style of martial art film making. I am one who enjoys this style it's combat scenes are more agressive and the story lines are dark in comparision. I give this film 3 stars because the interplay between the actors sometimes is long and the fight scenes are good but not great.,1202947200,3,525,4.422680412371134
