5116121,4,B0080QOK4I,"I found this long-sought video through Amazon. The quality of the production is generally good. It has been many years since I had seen the film on TV (it is rarely shown today). It is a worthy re-telling of real-life human experiences during a tumultuous period of human history. Those who have read the true story, the autobiography of the primary protagonist, will have to forgive certain Hollywood ""fictionalization"". However, the film is as good, or better, than I remember it to be. And the dvd is a welcome addition to my collection. The image is crisp, detailed black and white cinematography. The sound is excellent.",1349740800,13,625,4.90566037735849
5116122,4,B0080QOK4I,I read the book and the book is not only better but the movie changes much of the point of the book.  The movie she is treated badly in Japan when the book she was treated for the most part very well during the war in japan. The movie shows her mostly augueing about their defrent belifes where the book they only argued in thier early yrs. I would love to see the movie redone and the script by a woman cause thisman who wrote this script did a bad job in my opion. it is still a good movie to see but I highly recamend the book more.,1344643200,3,535,3.908256880733945
5116123,2,B0080QOK4I,"The story opens in 1935, as an unsophisticated Southern gal (Caroll Baker) meets a suave Japanese diplomat (James Shigeta) at a Washington party.  They fall in love and spend the war years in Japan, where he works for peace as she adjusts to a new culture.

This movie is based on a wonderful, sensitive memoir and could have been great but, for me, the miscasting of Carroll Baker almost ruins it.  She's gauche and unlikable with a shrill, twangy voice and limited acting skills.  James Shigeta, on the other hand, is perfect as the handsome and charming diplomat and gives an excellent performance.  It's a pleasure to watch him.

The movie feels rushed and shallow, never taking the time to explore the couple's feelings in depth.  I recommend the book by Gwen Terasaki instead.",1343001600,11,782,4.791044776119403

I am going to try one more time and if it still doesn't work, I am sending it back for a FULL refund.  I was very disappointed.",1430784000,2,328,3.9242424242424243
5116188,5,B0080QOK4I,"I first saw the trailer for this movie when I was a young high school student in the early '60s .  A few weeks after I had seen the trailer, a lovely, Italian-American classmate came to me and spoke glowingly of her experience viewing the movie.  Although I never got to see the movie at the time, the images of this biracial, bicultural, international relationship stuck in my mind--
Now, after several decades have past I am glad that I have finally gotten a chance to experience this groundbreaking (predating Guess Who's Coming To Dinner) movie.  My viewing of the movie was both moving and nostalgic in many ways.  James Shigeta was admirable and distinctive in his portrayal of the Japanese diplomat.  The role of Gwen and the challenges she faced was portrayed sensitively by Carroll Baker.  Given the time and setting of the underlying story and production of the movie, there are many timely international and cultural nuances which can be gleaned from this film.  A ""bridge"" to thoughtful consideration from different perspectives is always positive.",1427760000,2,1060,4.954802259887006

I saw this as a young girl and always remembered the scene where the character of Gwen was giving birth...however, I did not realize the historical significance of what was happening between Japan and the United States and the impact it had on this couple...The acting isn't the greatest, but I love James Shigeta, who recently passed away and his portrayal of this man who lost a lot because of his love for a American woman...good movie.",1414800000,,477,4.678571428571429

5116209,4,B0080QOK4I,"A long time fan of James Shigeta, I'm sure I watched this as a girl, but it was good to see it again.  Well done with excellent acting by both lead actors.  Carroll Baker and James Shigeta paint their characters with all their very human failings and incredible courage.  Gwen struggles to adapt to the Japanese culture and understand her new husband and his country.  A movie based on a true story that stands the test of time.",1412467200,,428,4.448717948717949

5116228,5,B0080QOK4I,"If you ever wondered what it would've been like to be in an inter-racial marriage just after the war, in this case WWII and some of the hardships associated with it, or, are of Japanese and American descent this is a movie worth watching.  While in my case it was the reverse, i.e., Dad was American, Mom was from Japan and they married in the early 50's while Dad was stationed in Japan during the Korean War, we faced a lot of silent and some verbal abuse as a result of their interracial marriage.  What really made me like this movie was it gave some poignant depictions of what strong willed and deep love could do and so soon after a very terrible war with even the deplorable mass destruction of lives and homelands in Japan (the Atomic bombs).  Kudos to the producers/directors of such an early release of this movie so soon after a disastrous war.  The acting is also not that bad for that time period....",1404345600,,914,4.4226190476190474

5116233,3,B0080QOK4I,"The film was enjoyable but short-changes the ""real life"" story.  I'd have preferred more accuracy to the book which helps one see into the lives of persons caught in that particular political and familial circumstance at that time in history.",1395705600,,242,5.05
5116250,5,B0080QOK4I,"I loved this movie when it first came out.  It has stood the test of time - it is as poignant today as it was then - and as well as anything I have seen, shows the unspeakable harm that is done to ordinary citizens when politicians start and soldiers go to war.",1389657600,,261,3.9245283018867925
5116251,5,B0080QOK4I,I am so glad that I watched this film last night and it still hung in the back of my mind after more than 24 hours. Has anyone's heart encouraged by something that's so sincere and so pure and not sugar-coated that moves your heart with awe. I am not going to spoil your fun by recounting the story but rather to share that I felt inspired to know that something real and beautiful still exists in the broken world we live because this movie is based on the true story. My next step is going to purchase the Kindle book and that's how much I love this film.,1376179200,,557,4.1192660550458715
5116252,5,B0080QOK4I,This terrific film gives a very honest portrayal of a  marriage during WWII between two people whose countries are at war. Carroll Baker and James Shigeta give great performances.,1375574400,,179,5.172413793103448
5116253,5,B0080QOK4I,"This is a fantastic, true-account love story. Carroll Baker delivers a top-notch performance. WARNING:  a real tear-jerker; a very sad story.",1375315200,,141,5.714285714285714

5116255,5,B0080QOK4I,"I've known of this film for a while but it has not been available. It tells the story of a white woman who marries a Japanese diplomat before WWII, and then chooses to be deported to Japan with him when diplomats are sent away soon after the war begins. She thus spends those years in Japan.
The victor always gets to write the histories (wouldn't it be interesting to read modern German and Japanese histories of that war?), so we've seen this from the American perspective often enough. This is another view.
I suppose that a similar perspective can be seen in the wonderful film ""Come See the Paradise,"" which shows a great deal of life in the US camps where racially Japanese people were kept during WWII, and where many of those interned were American citizens.
Anyway, this is a fine film that helps balance our viewpoint of the tragedies of war. It won't stop another war but it might make us pause a bit when we take our own side.",1366588800,4,938,4.459302325581396
5116256,5,B0080QOK4I,"All-time favorite movie - saw it when i was younger, it always stuck with me.  Appreciate it (always!) when a movie is colorblind and allows people to fall in love regardless of race or creed.  Way before its time.",1365206400,3,214,4.461538461538462
5116257,5,B0080QOK4I,"This autobiographical story of American Gwen Harold's marriage to diplomat Terry Terasaki is a very realistic look at the cultural clash between Japan and the United States before and during World War 2.  In the midst of racial prejudice and differing beliefs & practices, is a beautifully sincere love story between two people of vastly different backgrounds and ethnicity, told with honesty and integrity.  Carroll Baker is very emotional as the conflicted Gwen struggling to accept Japanese customs as an unwelcome American wife.  James Shigeta, always marvelous, gives a wonderful performance in stilted English (for this part only, as he is an American) as the proud diplomat Terry, a Japanese national, who loves his wife and child so deeply yet cannot let go of his inherent restraint even at the end when he needs Gwen the most.  Filmed in black and white which makes the war scenes and 1940s era very believable, this is a very good film told from the unique perspective of an American bride surviving the war inside Japan.",1362096000,18,1032,4.982558139534884
5116258,5,B0080QOK4I,"I recall seeing this film when I was a teenager, and enjoyed it just as much when I revisited it just recently.
