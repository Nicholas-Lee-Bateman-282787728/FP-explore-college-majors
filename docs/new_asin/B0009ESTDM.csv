8059516,5,B0009ESTDM,"There is subtle hints of yaoi throughout the series.  If you love a good monarchy, then this series is for you. There is tons of action and magic, but it also has a great story line.  Well worth adding to your collection!",1357171200,,221,4.238095238095238
8059517,5,B0009ESTDM,"This is a great series about a 15 year old boy named Yuri who is transported to another world through a toilet and then finds out that he is the king of ""The Great Demon Kingdom"" which is one of the more powerful countries there.

Volume 3 starts out with Yuri being held captive by the previous ruler's(Queen Celie) brother. Having been captured in the last episode of volume 2. What happens to Yuri you'll have to find out yourself by watching the movie. After that Yuri get word of someone in a nearby country who has been using the name of he demon king and to top it all off they got them selves arrested and are going to be put to death. Yuri being the nice guy that he is decides to go help him. But on the way Yuri ends up alone in a foreign country(not that the demon kingdom isn't foreign to him)with just about the last person he would want, Gwendle the two actually make for an interesting contrast.

I don't want to give away any more of the story so if you want to find out what happens I suggest you check out this movie it is an awesome series and this volume is probably the best one yet.

I highly suggest this movie to any anime fan who is looking for some laughs or just a unique story.",1134000000,8,1206,4.123404255319149

8059519,5,B0009ESTDM,"Yuri is a fifteen year old high school boy sucked down a toilet to become the Great Demon Kingdom's new Demon King.  This third volume starts off with Yuri in the clutches of ""the three not so look alike brother's"" uncle.  He somehow manages to escape and divert a civil war among the Demon Tribe, then the lot travels to find the Demon Flute (which looks more like a recorder) and a man who is locked up in a neighboring country who is supposedly the Demon King.  Look for Yuri in a dress, the appearance of the hot and sexy Demon King, Bando the dolphin, more jealousness from Wolfram and...wait!  Are Yuri and Gwendal getting along?!",1129248000,6,636,4.456896551724138
8059520,5,B0009ESTDM,I own all three DVD's now and I love them all.  The next will be great as well.  If you love Escaflowne but with a crazy twist you would love Kyo Kara Maoh!,1128902400,,156,3.696969696969697
