6657406,4,B00NIRGIPS,"I was slightly disappointed with Hot Tub Time Machine 2. It didn't have the same feel/tone like the original had, and it's one of my favorite movies. Although, I am glad they finally made this. The jokes weren't as funny, Chevy Chase was under-used, It also needed John Cusack. This time, they travel into the future (I prefer time-travel to the past better because it makes for funnier and more fish out of water jokes)

It has been a few years since their journey back to 1986 and the gang is successful and rich. Lou is a lot more arrogant and full of himself now. Nick has stolen other musician's music and Jacob is lazing about. After Lou makes a speech at a party about stepping over each other to get what you want, he is shot by an unknown assailant in his genital area. Nick and Jacob decide to take him back into the time traveling hot tub to figure out who did it and stop them, but they end up in 2025. They team up with Adam's son and try to save their present by changing the future. I'll still definitely buy the blu-ray when it's released, but I still much prefer the original. If you love dirty time-traveling sequels, you might enjoy HOT TUB TIME MACHINE 2!!!",1424563200,12,1177,4.35

6657408,2,B00NIRGIPS,"After remembering truly enjoying the first film, this cheap ploy for more of the viewing audience's dollars was a sad attempt, indeed. I'm not one to typically write reviews, as I'd be afraid to insult anyone I hope to eventually work with, however, this movie was pretty awful.  After the first ten minutes or so, I was afraid my girlfriend might be getting bored, as I too was feeling like the movie was dragging, and in truth, the story hadn't even started moving yet.  A surprisingly low-brow attack gets the events moving, and finally, our stars are on their way through time.  But for a few slightly cute, yet not so clever ideas about time travel, the experience was disappointing on the whole.  This movie is riddled with humor so base, and writing so poor that it cannot be compensated for with the would-be satisfying gratuitous nudity and raunchiness that someone familiar with the first movie would expect.  I would not be surprised if one of the stars of the first movie, John Cusack, is absent from this picture because the quality of it threatened to be so poor. There are certainly a few decent laughs, but don't go into it expecting to have a great time, or see a good movie.  Much like the characters themselves, the team that put this together likely finds themselves hoping for better results in an alternate universe where they made different choices.",1424476800,5,1372,4.7196652719665275

6657413,4,B00NIRGIPS,"Amazed that it is only rated two-and-a-half stars (at the time that I made this review anyway).  I think maybe some people just don't like funny, R-rated comedy.  Sure, it's not a perfect masterpiece, but I think it's very worthy of watching if you like irreverent, guy comedies.  Fits very well among movies like:  The Hangover, and Old School.",1497398400,,345,4.796610169491525
6657414,5,B00NIRGIPS,This movie is hysterical!,1497139200,,25,5.5
6657415,5,B00NIRGIPS,So the first movie was a brilliant homage to the 80's.  Equal parts fun nostalgia trip and well written comedy.  Could the sequel live up to the original?  Possibly but not on the same merits.  What this movie does is use its lore to have a ridiculous time travel adventure.  Your enjoyment will be based entirely on how funny you find the writing.  Its hard to tell you why the movie is funny without spoiling the jokes but I thought the movie was hilarious and if you enjoyed the first one beyond the nostalgia trip you should have a fun time with this one.,1496534400,,559,4.326923076923077

6657417,3,B00NIRGIPS,"The movie wasn't the worst thing I have watched. However, that does not mean I would recommend this comedy movie to any of my friends. There were some parts that deserved a good laugh, but most scenes made me cringe.",1496102400,,216,4.425
6657418,2,B00NIRGIPS,First of all I am not a prude in ANY way. But this has to be one of the worst sequels I have ever seen. It's not only crude but toe curling at times and I can't believe the actors - which are btw. known for being somewhat 'edgy'  agreed to this crap. The few times that were entertaining don't make up for the whole load of pubescent humor that pretty much ruled this movie. John Cusak knew why he ran from it.,1493942400,,410,3.9397590361445785
6657419,3,B00NIRGIPS,"Not a good follow up to the first one, but rarely this movies are. What could have made this one better is a good soundtrack. That was part of the appeal of the original movie.",1493856000,,176,4.057142857142857
6657420,1,B00NIRGIPS,"Loved the first movie. Second film is awful... I love Adam Scott so I won't blame him (in fact he's responsible for the funniest scene in the movie), but it left me feeling sleazy and dirty in a bad way.",1492214400,,203,4.1
6657421,1,B00NIRGIPS,"I loved the first one, and I enjoy stupid comedy, but this was awful. Just awful. There are very few movies I consider rating at all, but this is one of them.",1490227200,,158,3.96875

6657423,5,B00NIRGIPS,"I don't fully understand how it got such a bad rap. Overall I liked it. Is it more focused on jokes instead of the story line? Yes, but that's what Comedy is! I didn't watch it to contemplate on some philosophical idea or watch a mystery unravel. I watched it to have a laugh. Which it successfully made me do. If you want to unravel a mystery, try and figure out the real reason John Cusack isn't in the movie. John made a twitter comment that he wasn't invited to do it. The cast during an interview made a joke(?) that he is in the movie and they didn't tell them he was cut out. Which may have been true because there is a deleted scene where John pops in for a cameo as an alternate ending. However Rob Cordry (who plays Lou) suggested a theory that he is a serious actor and didn't want to do another ""dumb"" movie. I loved the first one and John is a disappointing missing element in the second one, but I think they a decent job trying to work around it. I don't agree with any of the bad critics.",1489881600,7,1004,4.101522842639594

I looked at the stars given to the movie before I watched it and knew going in that it was not one of the best movies of the year, but I thought it would have been better than it turned out to be.  The plot of finding the shooter was goofy.  And yet, I wanted to see the end to see who it was.

It IS a movie about dick jokes, but they took it to the next level, and got very meta and self deprecating, with both themselves, and the genre.

6657781,2,B00NIRGIPS,"I enjoyed ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" way more than I thought I would. I love time travel stories, and thought HTTM was a unique twist on the usual trope. I went into ""Hot Tub Time Machine 2"" hoping it would at least give me more of the same. It did, sort of. It gave me more of what I didn't like in the last movie, and less of what I did.

I thought the beginning of the movie had promise, showing two guys fully exploiting their knowledge of the future for personal gain. Lou and Nick have become rich, Lou by inventing Google (now called ""Lougle"") and Nick by performing hit songs before their creators could.

But all is not well. Lou has created a decadent monstrosity of a life with a bad wig, a boardroom where he encourages men outside to flash the female executives, and a huge painting in his house of himself doing obscene things to a tiger. He's driven his company into the ground because he has no original ideas of his own.

Nick is frustrated with the fact that he can't create any hit songs of his own. He's also having a crisis of conscience over the work he's stealing. There was one great moment where Lisa Loeb tells Nick how much she loved his song (originally her song) ""Stay"" so much that it felt ""violating.""

And Jacob isn't dealing well with the knowledge that Lou is his father, because, well, Lou is a monster.

When Lou gets fatally shot (in the groin, of course), the three of them try to go back in time to save him. But the hot tub time machine sends them forward in time, not backwards. They end up ten years in the future, where they realize that Lou's killer is from, so they have to find the killer in the future to save him in the past. Wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff. Really, it's just an excuse to goof around in the future.

I thought the world was way too advanced for a decade in the future with holograms and artificially intelligent cars. But that's a minor point. The biggest problem is everything else.

John Cusack chose not to do the sequel, which was one of the smartest decisions he's made since he agreed to do the original ""Hot Tub Time Machine."" But the lack of John Cusack really hamstrung this movie.

 HTTM2 made me wonder why I wanted to spend time with these guys in the last movie. Lou is an amoral sociopath who cheerfully destroys the lives of everyone around him. Nick was kind of a sad sack in the last movie, but has become more of a jerk in this one. Jacob is the same nerdy loser from the last one, but is also really arrogant. None of them are pleasant people, and they're all cruel to each other in ways that go beyond the good-natured ribbing in the last one.

It was only on retrospect that I realized Cusack was vital for the success of the last movie. He served as the regular guy, the center and leader of the troop of misfits from HTTM. Without him, the group descended into misery. Adam Scott was cast as his son to replace him, but doesn't work. He's a bright-eyed innocent who wears skirts and is just waiting to be made fun of. He doesn't provide the core that Cusack gave the cast, just another person to mock.

There's a scene in this movie which I felt overshadowed everything and also typified everything wrong with this movie. At one point, they go on a TV show called ""Choosey Doosey,"" where Nick is forced to choose to do things based on audience suggestions. Lou being Lou, he suggests Nick have sex with a man. But he doesn't count on the show's rules, where the chooser will be the one who has to do it, and is dragged on stage to be the recipient. We then see the two forced into virtual reality suits, electrocuted to ensure compliance, and the deed is done.

I spent a lot of time wondering why they put that scene in. I can only imagine the writers were thinking of the scene in HTTM where Lou bets a guy he'll give oral to Nick if he loses, and then loses. But what made that scene funny was that it went right up to the point where it was going to happen, and then Nick passed out. There's nothing actually funny about rape, which is what the Choosey Doosey scene boils down to. This whole movie has that kind of feel, like the writers weren't exactly sure what was funny about the last one, and just did the same thing less successfully.

I can certainly see some people finding this movie funny or funnier than HTTM, but that's a small group who likes dark and offensive humor. I'm not that type. I enjoyed the first movie despite its mean-spirited tone, not because of it. HTTM was a surprisingly original and unique take on time travel with a few dumb and ugly jokes. HTTM2 is just a bunch of dumb and ugly jokes.

Random Thoughts:
-I did enjoy the ""you're a nerd"" song they kept breaking into to make fun of Jacob. I was delighted to see the full ""OK Go"" version.
-The Nick Webber Shuffle was a hilariously bad and viral dance. I could totally see it catching on.",1477958400,2,4859,4.301969365426696

I am sick and tired of filthy language spewing out of actors mouth into my hearing.
I also do not like pornographic and ""suggestive"" scenes that are offensive to me and my family.
Does a movie require this to be good or successful. I say NO !

I could not and will not watch or listen to media like this that taints everything.
It had a good basic comedy/sci-fi plot line, but destroyed it with their coarse and unseemly scenes.
