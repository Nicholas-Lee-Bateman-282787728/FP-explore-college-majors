7855932,3,6303937888,"I remember seeing this movie when I was younger and searching out Michael Pare films (after Eddie and the Cruisers 2). What I remember most is the end song by Sean Patrick.

I bought the film and have to say, it is no where as good as I remember it being. The acting is all really bad, even poor Michael Pare was basically just playing Eddie again without the good emotion (probably because he is evil in this). I do still really love the song at the end, I wish it was long enough to get a good mp3 of or that there was a full version of the song out there somewhere.",1385078400,,568,4.0265486725663715
7855933,3,6303937888,"This is an ok movie. Adequate but nothing too exciting. I only got it because of Michael Pare` who is ,as usual, quite fine in his part. The story line is another ""cult"" theme where the bad guys are collecting people for nefarious reasons... not a bad movie for a dark rainy evening.",1243296000,,283,4.3584905660377355
7855934,2,6303937888,"Despite a name cast and a couple of Oscar veterans, this silly film has little going for it.
Sean Patrick Flanery, who is still trying to find that star making role, is a down and out musician with a cute girlfriend.  She is hired as a backup singer for Michael Pare, who is pushing a one world order with the backing of...oh, I don't know...could it be...SATAN.  Flanery has religious fanatics grandma Shelley Winters and evangelist Diane Ladd on his side, for what that is worth.
The pseudonym Alan Smithee is used by directors who take their name off a project, and I was surprised to not see it used more throughout the credits.  Five different writers are credited with a script that features more holes than an Afghani cave complex.  Michael Pare finally gets to use the guitar face that made ""Eddie and the Cruisers"" so successful, but the songs here are all really tepid and uninteresting.  Speaking of tepid, the special effects are awful, I have seen better use of computer animation on local television ads.
I cannot imagine the film makers started out with such a cheap idea, but after getting the cast, that is what the film degenerated into.  ""Raging Angels"" is a cool title to an otherwise bland film.
This is rated (R) for physical violence, some gun violence, some profanity, and sexual content.",1015113600,2,1312,4.707423580786026
7855935,1,6303937888,"This movie is more of a comedy than a horror.  Beyond the attractive qualities of the young leads, there was not much to enjoy about this flick.  Even good actors like Diane Ladd and Sean Patrick Flanery give poor  performances.  The only thing that made this movie worth viewing (in my  opinion) was the vocal stylings of Mr Flanery (yes, I watched the credits  and was really him singing).",952041600,3,391,4.594202898550725
