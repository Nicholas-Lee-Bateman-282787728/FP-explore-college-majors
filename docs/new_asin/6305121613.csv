7883719,4,6305121613,"""Hercules in the Haunted World"" is the clear winner here.  This Mario Bava production features South African bodybuilder Reg Park as Hercules; and the villain is Christopher Lee.

 Mythological and historical pastiche is in order here.  Characters include Deianeira, Proserpina, Jocasta, Theseus, and Telemachus.  They never appear on stage together in Hamilton's Mythology, that's for sure.

 This film was originally titled ""Ercole al Centro della Terra"" and is also known as ""Hercules Against the Vampires.""

 ""Hercules Unchained"" is the Steve Reeves/Sylvia Koscina sequel.  This one is kinkier and funnier than the original, as Hercules is made the love slave of an evil queen.",984873600,2,681,5.524271844660194
