4247083,5,B0042AGNBE,"When I first saw this film I was agog at the interesting and thoughtful treatment of the characters and the situation they found themselve in.  I had not read any reviews and so was completely unprepared and astonished.  I cannot write about it without risking spoiling the clever and unexected conclusion.  And reading reviews and/or descriptions of the film may rob you of one of the greatest surprises in today's cenima.

I think that once you see it you will want tell others about it so that they can share in your experience.  But you will be limited in what ou can say without spoiling it.

The casting is spot on.  Martin Landau gives one of his best performances.  The plot development is subtle and takes several unexpected twist and turns.  I rated this film as one of the best I had seen.

If you are in a situation involving older people, this is a must see.  But, it is not a film about being old but about being human and how unexpected some of the paths leading into the future can turn out to be.

If you want a good and thought provoking experience, Lovely Still is for you.",1300924800,3,1092,4.405
4247084,5,B0042AGNBE,This movie was beautiful and touching. Landau and Burstyn both give amazing performances in this promising film. I watched the trailer before it came out and finally saw it on netflix and I just bought it on here! It really is a great movie.,1298073600,,241,4.5
4247085,5,B0042AGNBE,"""When I saw you everything fit. It was like breathing.""

I hope someone someday says something like that to me. If you have heard those sentiments, bless you.  Like the one who loves you, your love brings light into the world.

This is a sweet wonderful film.  It begins gently. Give it the time. If you do, it will weave it's magic, capturing and cradling your heart as the story unfolds before you.

I especially liked the scene in which Mary (Ellen Burstyn) asks Martin (Martin Landau) to spent the next day, Christmas Day, with her. Martin, looking sad and pensive as though he's looking into the past, replies that he has never spent Christmas Day with anyone.  Mary pauses.  Looks up at him, and seeing his mood says cheerily, ""So is that a ""yes""?"" With those fives words she acknowledges his mood, and nudges him back into the present moment. It's a moment that offers a future together as a sweet promise.

And to top it all off, the music is wonderful.",1296518400,37,961,4.514450867052023
4247086,5,B0042AGNBE,"The screen play writing and acting of the principals in this film is outstanding, especially that of Martin Landau who delivers an Oscar caliber performance. I first saw this movie at the Milwaukee Film Festival where Martin Landau and the writer/director engaged the audience in a delightful question and answer session. Since then I have eagerly awaited its general release. The story is touching and poignant, funny, uplifting and sad at the same time. One of my favorite movies.",1294358400,,482,5.113924050632911
4247087,5,B0042AGNBE,This is an extraordinary movie. I can't believe the director is so young - his wisdom is way beyond his years. Landau and Burstyn are luminous and un-Botoxed in this haunting drama about what true love really is. Be sure to watch very carefully as the details give insight into what is quickly revealed at the end - that is how everybody is really related. I have been thinking about it daily since I saw it. You will never forget it!,1294185600,17,434,4.37037037037037
4247088,5,B0042AGNBE,"I can't tell you much about the plot because the movie has a twist that I do not want to spoil if you have not seen it.  I can say that the acting by Martin Landau and Ellen Burstyn should get oscars, it is amazing and wonderful.

Adam Scott is funny and Elizabeth Banks is beautiful and warm as always.  Do not miss this movie.  Buy it, give it to your friends, they will love you for it.",1292025600,3,389,3.948717948717949
4247089,5,B0042AGNBE,"A terrific, endearing  and thoughtful love story, set at Christmas time.  Love awakens.  Love enlivens.  Love embraces all and survives all..as these two elderly lovers remind us with their charm, their vulnerability and their unabashed affirmations and celebrations of one another..and the ending will blow you away and make you want to watch it again and again..so buy it for your family film library and watch it with your family over and over.",1291161600,,447,5.082191780821918

4247091,4,B0042AGNBE,"What a lovely surprise - loved it!  It stayed with me for days after.  I kept remembering snippets of it.  It's not what I thought it was. The story unfolds slowly and subtly clues are dropped that something is more then what it seems.  Robert is an elderly guy living alone and he works at a supermarket.  Mary is his new elderly next door neighbor.  Mary encourages Robert and they start a relationship.

It's filmed in Omaha, Nebraska during the Christmas season.  There's lots of snow, which is beautiful and creates one of the most memorable scenes.  Robert notices the falling snow and says something like, was it always this beautiful, did we miss it?  Mary encourage Robert to live in the present.  The acting, the story and the visuals are wonderful.  The morning rituals of Roberts waking up and grooming are funny and full of emotion, what a great actor Martin Landau is!  There are many funny and poignant scenes. For example, Robert soliciting advice from others on that ever so important first date.  Ellen Burstyn, as Mary, is fabulous too in this role.  The chemistry between the two seems real.  The two main supporting roles of Mary's daughter, Elizabeth Banks,  and Robert's manager, Adam Scott, are well acted, interesting, and add depth to the story.  A timeless favorite! I highly recommend it. It's ok if you cry!",1289260800,87,1336,4.759825327510917
4247092,5,B0042AGNBE,Martin Landau and Ellen Burstyn are perfect for this film and are so natural in their roles. This really is a terrific movie for the entire family and a great holiday movie. I'm ordering a few DVDs for my family and as early Xmas gifts!,1286841600,13,236,4.266666666666667
4247093,5,B0042AGNBE,"Great acting by two favorites. Many have said this is a sad movie, but it's not til the uncovering aspect story at the very end. I often found myself grinning ear to ear at the innocent beauty of their childlike natures and big smiles together.  5 stars (after the first boring 20 min.) This movie hits close to home in some ways and therefore by the end, it was very poignant.",1521763200,,377,4.309859154929577

4247101,1,B0042AGNBE,"Most of the film is a conventional love between two very elderly people.  Although it is supposed to occur over a few days, it is so slow moving that it seems just endless.  The film takes a sudden turn near the end, and the people turn out to be quite different from what we thought--so different, in fact, that the viewer feels tricked. This is supposed to be a story of eternal love, but the story is just impossible.  Someone who has the issues of the main character simply could not do what he is supposed to have done in this film.  This film misrepresents a very serious condition.  It left me feeling depressed, angry, and manipulated.  Skip it.",1510358400,,653,4.445378151260504

4247107,3,B0042AGNBE,"Well done film, great acting and lovely BUT ~ 2/3rds into the film it gets sad, strange and confusing and then depressing and it ends.
Dementia is a fact of life but I wanted more of a romance not a sad last third.

4247112,5,B0042AGNBE,"Such a tender hearted movie.  The acting of Martin Landau and Ellen Byrnstyn is of the highest caliber.  What appears to be an end of life romance is revealed to be something else all together at the end of the film.  There is plenty of foreshadowing, but one a! most willfuly disregards the clues so that the sweet dream can continue.

Yea, the entire movie goes by with you (or me) thinking I have it all figured out....and then...in the last 8 minutes your picture of what just happened completely unfolds & turns upside down.  What a shock, I had no clue what was really happening in the movie.  Now....I will schedule another evening to watch it again.

4247119,4,B0042AGNBE,"This is a tough film to watch. I won't give anything away but the reality of the story line hits home with millions of people.
There are small clues along the way but you hope they mean nothing. Uplifting and brooding. If you expect some chuckles, they come far and few between.
As a senior myself, it reinforces the sometime loneliness of old age. Friends and family disappear over a long lifetime. If you're blessed, you have a spouse who is your best friend for life. That simple lesson is lost on the young. Younger folks don't have the life experience that those of us in the twilight of our time on this planet. When you look at your life and realize that you have less ahead of you than what was already lived, your own mortality becomes a big question mark. Caring, compassionate, young people will get it and appreciate it.
The acting was superb. Landau (88) and Burstyn (84) are national treasures. While the movie is stunning, I would have rather seen the both of them in lighter fare. Who knows how much longer we will have these terrific actors around?
Watch it. Cry. And hug a loved one.",1497052800,6,1101,4.482587064676617

This was incredibly done, and all I can say is the ending makes me want to watch it again.  The acting was spot on too, Martin Landau and Ellen Burstyn both deserve awards for their portrayals.

4247123,5,B0042AGNBE,I watched mainly because I like the two main characters. Figured you can't go wrong and I wasn't.  Don't be fooled while watching this that its just another rom-com movie.  It seems that way for most of the movie but when things start unraveling I was blown away. It's hard to review this movie without giving it all away so suffice it to say you won't be disappointed in this movie.

4247134,4,B0042AGNBE,"A sweet and loving courtship and romantic adventure unfolds between a smitten very senior pair. One evening Robert ( Martin Landau), returning from his job at the grocery, is stunned to find Mary (Ellen Burstyn) in his home. She quickly invents a reason and he's satisfied. Their romance is set in a winter landscape at Christmas time. The seasonal music, lights, artistic stage sets and the movement of the characters from icy snowy outdoors to cozy toasty interiors generate a just-right nostalgic holiday atmosphere. Sensitivity and caring between and among the characters, including Adam Scott and Elizabeth Banks' characters is smartly developed. The story treats love in the twilight years with grace and appreciation, and displays bountiful artistic skill. To tell more would spoil. The only element I didn't like was the use of sort of kaleidoscopic, swirling, somewhat chaotic imagery in the interludes suggesting Robert's confusion upon arising. It felt a bit amateurish. But the film is an excellent one, with a lovely storyline ( Nik Fackler and Tim Kasher), skilled directing (Fackler) and exceptional performances by a talented cast.

fault in the details of the relationships, of who is living where and why. To me it seems unreal; the main character is not going to be left
on his own here, nor is his life's love going to be where she is. Perhaps, a contrived tearjerker, but worth seeing nonetheless. A sad, sad
fairy tale",1484956800,2,431,4.08235294117647

I admit - I have watched this several times and, even knowing the twists, still cry at the same places. No, that is inaccurate - I sob. . So fair warning, it is a tear-jerker. But sooo worth it!

Plus it didn't make sense that Ellen Burstyn was so lovely but chasing after someone who was obviously not dealing with a full deck.  But it got my full attention as I realized what was happening, and it became a real tearjerker and tragedy, but worth watching because it is so cleansing.  Very beautiful film.  Although I hear the criticisms of others who say this is romanticizing certain horrible medical realities.  We can only endure certain horrible medical realities if we DO romanticize them.

What I had considered as faults of the script (such as the strange presence of Ellen Burstyn's character in Landau character's home and his strange reaction to it, or the protagonist's peculiar relationship with the store manager,) all fell into place retroactively. Reading S.Dargin's positive review of the movie and then N.B. Kennedy's very critical but insightful review, presented me with a dilemma for my own rating of the film. Certainly there were flaws--including unnecessary subplots such as the manager's Ponzi game involving Christmas recipes, or the interview for a new employee at the grocery store.)

Yes, the story focuses later in the film and so much falls into place.

We see how all in the family are overwhelmed and become victims themselves.
A house without family photos is a metaphor for those who live but have not a memory of that life.

I don't want to spoil it for potential viewers but be aware that, if, like me, you have been through or are going through a journey with a loved one suffering with dementia, watching this may disturb you...or enlighten you...or both, as it did me.

I had no idea how deeply this movie would touch me and to those critics of the premise, you are certainly painting with a broad brush something that is as varied for each person as their thumbprints. I am appalled at the callousness of people to spoil a movie for others in order to simply express an opinion about the plot.  If you are giving an opinion it can be done with respect to another person's opportunity to draw their own conclusions.  You need not reveal significant plot features.  I do appreciate those that title their review spoiler alert but to those readers who have not seen the film, do not read them.  I remember the joint refusal of people to spoil The Sixth Sense when it first came out.  That is to be applauded.  And, in my opinion so is this film.",1463184000,,930,4.335260115606936

4248243,1,B0042AGNBE,"I hate spoilers, but I don't know how else to explain why this movie made me so angry. I wish movie makers would stop romanticizing the disease we shall call ""A."" The premise of this movie is utterly inane. A woman leaves a man with A alone so she can live out some twisted fantasy of reviving him with romance. A person with A so advanced he doesn't recognize his family members cannot live alone, cannot get himself dressed and make breakfast, cannot brew coffee, remember to take pills, find his way to work and back, etc. He certainly cannot recognize a ""new"" woman in his life from one day to the next, remember her name and be cognizant enough of time and circumstance to say, ""I've only known you for a week, but tomorrow I'm going to ask you to marry me."" Suddenly, short-term memory is no problem?!? And what's with that oddball subplot about prescription pills? There is no effective pill for A, so why is she all agita about him missing a few pills? What pills are these?!? Beyond the A problem, two people in their 80s getting themselves down onto plastic sleds and riding down a snowy, bumpy hill? They must have the bodies of people half their age. This all strains credulity to the breaking point.

4248473,3,B0042AGNBE,"I was pleased, in the end, that I watched this.

Heres my journey:  I liked it a lot at first; then I thought it was too storybook, unrealistic, and cheesy; then it was intense.  Like I said, in the end, I was glad to have watched it.  It wasn't cheesy or storybook after all.

Ellen Burstyn and all the actors do a great job.  That said, this movie is about retired people, primarily, at the end of their lives.  You don't know anything about their earlier lives, so its kind of like you just met two old people and are getting to know them, but know nothing about who they are, where theyve lived, if their spouse is dead, if they're divorced, if they're never married, or just what.

The movie has parts that are very funny, very sad, and very warm.  Yet, in one sense, it was very hard to watch.  In this:  it is a movie that deals in a very real way with the very sad parts of aging, with loneliness and physical slowness.  It was actually hard for me, on a personal level, to see how old Martin Landau, the person, has gotten.

At the end, I even thought about watching it again, but decided against it.  That speaks to two things.  First, that the movie had good merit and good plot--to the degree that I wanted to go back and see some things over that I had probably missed, and to re-experience the movie.  Secondly, my thought to rewatch it speaks to this:  the movie, because of watching old people in their loneliness, was too lonely for me to watch again!",1447200000,6,1468,4.260869565217392
4248474,5,B0042AGNBE,This is a really good movie.  A nice story with a definite twist that you do not see coming at the end.  Loved it.,1447113600,,114,3.7083333333333335

Ellen Burnstyn  and Martin Landau have the burden of pulling off what starts out as romantic encounter between two elderly people but is actually a familial intervention to save the husband from increasing isolation and alienation. As the deception wears off it is clear the target, the husband, is not better served by it. I was neither frighten by the attempt to horrify---the husband is seen howling and desperate when he believes his lover/wife has left him---nor was I sympathetic to the plight of the husband.

4248551,4,B0042AGNBE,Sweet start and thought it was a little slow but am a romantic so that was ok with me. Quite a shocking ending! Didn't see that coming at all. But overall I enjoyed it.,1445644800,,168,3.9705882352941178

Fast forwarding didn't reveal any more storyline than the beginning, so we cut it off rather quickly and didn't bother to finish it.  I was hoping to enjoy it for the lead actors, who I considered to be excellent ones.  Unfortunately, Martin Landau has not aged well and I didn't even recognize his leading lady.

4248573,5,B0042AGNBE,I would like to suggest that those who have watched the film and didn't care for it to watch it again and pay close attention.

4248578,5,B0042AGNBE,Yes - people are living longer these days.  But that also means that many will experience aging in ways that will surprise them.  This well-acted film is an exploration of what aging can mean to so many people.  The plot gently twists and turns and culminates in a touching conclusion.,1444953600,,285,4.66

 Why did the family move across the street from him? Why did his grown kids call him by first name? Why did his slimy-acting son want him to sell recipe books at the store? I don't understand all the deception. It really took away from the sweetness of the story, by adding several confusing scenes to the mix. Now the acting by Ellen and Martin was of course, wonderful. They are both really gifted. But the story line was really out there. I mean, why not remain in the same house and then start giving him the pills? It was a messy plot. I only give this movie two stars, one for each of the wonderful stars who acted in it. Their acting was enjoyable.

4248901,5,B0042AGNBE,"Turned this on in the late evening, knowing nothing more than the name of the movie and the lead actors.  I really intended it to be a ""go to sleep by"" kind of movie; quiet, no action and explosions, etc.
I WAS SLAM-DUNKED by this AWESOME movie!!  Terrific writing, dialogue, plot, etc.  Well shot...it was like visiting some neighborhoods that I grew up in.  The acting was superbly done.  I'd never heard of this movie before today, and I'm sorry I missed it earlier in my life.
WONDERFUL, POSITIVE, AFFIRMING, GLOWING.
I'd recommend this as a ""date night"" movie ONLY for couples that are truly, firmly, irrevocably committed to each other, for forever.  This is not  the movie to see with a  casual friend, but someone you truly, deeply love now...and intend to love forever.  Yes, FOREVER.

Okay, 'nough said.  Won't say more about the acting or plot, lest I reveal too much.

But when you do watch this, pick an evening with few distractions...turn off your phones...shutdown your internet and turn off all your devices.  You really should give this one your complete attention--and when it's over, you'll be glad you did.",1438646400,33,1127,4.77720207253886

However, the manner in which the family chose to deal with it was both loving and compassionate. Oftentimes, care outside the home and family are opted for, rather than to make sacrifices to ensure our loved one maintains some dignity in life, after all they have done for their loved ones over the years. This film demonstrates how the choice of one family helped to honor and safe the life of a beloved husband and father.

The cast is perfect.  Ellen Burstyn shines.  Martin Landau, Elizabeth Banks and Adam Scott are terrific.

I think that we decided that Martin Landau was 82 when he did this film. He was perfect for the part.,1431302400,,406,3.9634146341463414

I found myself thinking what a very special young man....must have had wonderful parents....and will certainly make a wonderful husband someday.  Of course at the end this was explained.

Also towards the end I realized how much it reminded me of <here's the spoiler> The Notebook.  I was lucky enough to watch that with no details so it unfolded as this did.

As other reviewers said, this will stay with you for days, maybe forever.

I watched this on Prime (thank you Amazon) but I will probably buy the DVD.  It's definitely one that can be watched again.....just like The Notebook.",1431216000,,814,4.683098591549296

It was wonderful to see the actors in the film and the honesty they portrayed by simply allowing their true selves to shine out of their characters was amazing to watch. Probably the best I have seen Landau ever do.  The story was carefully wrought and well played out. A bit of it was glitchy but I realized why at the end of the film.

I watched it a week later and didn't catch on to Robert's condition until the point where the majority of viewers probably did as well. Because of her all too familiar experience with my father's behavior as she's lived with him for two years, she recognized early on in the movie the signs of dementia. The outbursts, routine, rage, confusion, and Post-It notes were clear indications to her. For me, the story unfolded with frequent awkward and odd moments. Only after the scene where his mental state is revealed did they finally make sense to me, which is the objective of a plot twist.
  I thought the director handled the story with sensitivity and gentleness and wouldn't be surprised if he had some experience himself with someone who had Alzheimer's. The acting was GREAT, and I know the actors weren't in this for the money as one reviewer wondered who gave it one star--it's an indy film, and no one does that to get rich. I gave it four stars instead of five because of the plausibility of the scenario.

Good and even great movies can of course have bummer endings but in this case nothing really rings true about the plot development at the end of the film. The movie takes a totally illogical and unnecessary left turn two thirds the way through just to achieve a surprise and ultimately depressing ending. Mine is obviously a minority opinion but I thoroughly disliked this film. If you're looking for a better representation of old age and the pain of dementia I'd suggest you check out ""Away From Her"" or ""The Notebook"" and skip this turkey.

We had no idea it was not actually a Christmas movie, but a movie about Alzheimer's and dementia.  When I did a search for ""Christmas movies"" this one popped up.  The title, ""Lovely, Still"" and the cover picture make this sound like a ""lovely"" film and the title has nothing to do with this film.  What is lovely about any of this?  We were definitely in the mood for something uplifting and this was not it.  We were bummed when it was over.  The actors are good, but a lot of the plot was far fetched.  Not at all realistic that a man this impaired would be living across the street from his family by HIMSELF and with access to a gun. The plot just did not make any sense!  If you want to see a movie about Alzheimer's and a couple's love, watch The Notebook.  If you want to see a Christmas movie, don't watch this one.",1356739200,6,951,4.14207650273224

But for those of us approachng the winter of life, it contains very disturbing and chilling images of the worst ravages that Alzheimer's disease can wreak on a loving family. Anger, fear, and helplessness in the face of mortality are more easily rationalized by the young (and especially young filmmakers?) than by the old, who may in all likelihood soon face them. This movie would benefit from an age restriction warning: something like ""Contains disturbing images and depictions of hopelessness and dementia.

I'd give it 4 stars but for the absolutely stupid ending. I get it, the movie is from Martin's character's perspective. But I can't suspend belief long enough to get past a guy so demented that he doesn't know his wife but he can purchase a handgun and remember to give it to himself for Christmas? And he still has a driver's license? His family is living across the street and he communicates with his wife by telephone? He finds his way to work every day and stocks shelves in a store he owns? His wife takes him to a Christmas party in his condition? And on and on...If anybody can explain how any of this works in the plot I'm willing to listen. Moreover, I'd like to ask Martin Landau and Ellen Burstyn why they agreed to be in this turkey. Jack Nicholson or De Niro I could understand, but these two generally don't just go for a payday. Landau said in an interview in the bonus section that the original script had some bumps in it that had to be worked out before he would consent. I wonder if he had seen the finished product yet? This thing kind of reminds me of The Lake House that was out a few years ago. Shame there are great scripts just gathering dust out there while a kid plays at movie making.

First off, this movie was especially well written.  If you are tired of the regurgitated swill that Hollywood increasingly produces this will definitely appeal to you.

As you watch the movie, the characters are well developed and honest.  They could be your neighbor or a friend.  The acting was exceptional and believable as an elderly man slowly loses his ability to connect with the world around him.

But beware -things are never what they appear on the surface.

If you like a good love story that doesn't need sex and violence to ""enhance"" your enjoyment, this qualifies as an experience to be savored.  The plot line is well developed but provides a surprise that few will foresee.

Furthermore, several of my movie friend's stated that when watching it a second time, you catch greater subtleties within the premise of the movie and that they actually enjoyed it even more.  What could be a greater endorsement from serious movie aficionados?!

It's a definite must see, in fact, I enjoyed this as much as ""Love Story"".  Oh and don't forget to bring some tissues!",1329436800,12,1306,4.675438596491228

Unfortunately, it is promoted as a tender romance between two lonely older people when it is actually the very sad story of an aging couple trying to somehow cope with the devastating impact of dementia. It is human, it is honest, and it is powerful; but it may not be a movie that you would choose for a romantic evening with your beloved. This is particularly true if both of you have reached the age when dementia becomes a serious concern.

4249172,5,B0042AGNBE,"This movie breaks my heart in so many ways.  It is so close to my life experience that it almost hurts to watch.  The main character has a disease which causes him to forget everyone around him.  They never quite say this is Alzheimers and that's a good thing because I believe the character is suffering from the same disease as my father which is Lewey Body Syndrome.  He forgets everyone close to him but can still function on a daily basis, albeit under the watchful eye of those around him.  My father does not know my mother any longer and thinks she is a lady we hired to take care of him.  This mirrors the situation of the main characters in so many ways.  I won't give out any spoilers but will say this movie is so full of beautiful, tender moments of two elderly people simply trying to reconcile the cards life has dealt them and the children trying to understand the reasoning of their actions.  If you have elderly parents, this is a must see.  If not, then do yourself a favor and watch a magical little movie that will break your heart.",1323043200,7,1053,4.331632653061225
4249173,5,B0042AGNBE,"I first saw the trailer for this movie quite a while before its release.  I wrote down the title, and unfortunately forgot about it.  Flash forward a few months, and i see this movie in my recommendations on Netflix.  Well, quite frankly it still didn't ring a bell at first, but i went ahead and rented it.  Now, i'm younger than 30, male, and pretty open to movies.  But when i read the synopsis, i wasn't too thrilled about just another love story.  Ellen Burstyn was what made me take a chance.
While watching this wonderful movie, i started out pretty confused.  I questioned certain character traits in a few people, but they didn't leave a big enough impression for me to keep agonizing over them.  About 10 minutes into it, i started to smile.  The two main characters just seemed to be made for eachother, and everything they did just fit.  Scenes that would normally make my eyes roll, really touched me.  For instance, these two wonderful strangers kiss for the first time, and Christmas lights flash on.  Needless to say, my smile stayed on for quite some time.  Things just worked for these characters.

Then the pessimist in my questioned how perfect everything was.  I've seen my fair share of movies that seem good at first, then turn into train wrecks.  However, just when i was expecting the worst to happen, a glimpse of jealousy is shown from Mr. Landau's character that makes me think, ""oh, here's the hitch.""  Which draws my attention away from the normal ""it's way too perfect to be like this the whole movie"" attitude.

The different characters do very endearing acts for and with eachother, and it's all wonderful again.  And then that pesky pessimist in me is tapping my shoulder again preparing me for the worst.  Then i think i know whats going to happen, and prepare for it, and it turns out that i was yet again completely wrong.

Again, everything is back to normal, and then i have to prepare for the worst.  By the time the big reveal, the main reason this movie is so brilliant happens, i'm completely suprised, and taken aback, because this time i simply didn't prepare for it.  Everything was fine and i had this movie figured out.  Nope.  Wrong.

This movie was great for several different reasons.  The characters are all very likable.  Even when they aren't likable, you don't dislike them.  You just ask yourself why they are acting this way.  Watching these people, is like hanging out with very good friends who you know well, and even when they are jerks, you forgive them, because you know the real person behind the anger, or confusion.

I purposely didn't put much of anything in this review, just because to give anything away to anyone who is considering on watching this, is a crime.  This movie needs it's vewiers to be completely ignorant of any information before watching it.

8413362,5,B0042AGNBE,"By all appearances, this is a touching Christmas movie about a man finding love late in life.  There are signs, though, that it's not going to end happily.  Only, what you think is going to happen is not what is going to happen.  I read no reviews for this movie before watching it, so I was totally surprised by the ending.  Totally.  For that alone, I'll give it five stars.  Whether or not it's a ""realistic"" story is not a concern of mine.  It was a wonderful like Christmas movie, complete with Christmas songs, carolers and snow.  It ended up being something else, too, which was a sad surprise, but still an interesting surprise.",1526688000,,636,4.517543859649122
8413363,4,B0042AGNBE,"Moving film, Burstyn and Landau are great as anyone would expect. I like seeing movies about love at an older age, particularly since I'm getting there myself, lol. But this film is different, tender and touching without a true happy ending. With dementia and/or Alzheimer's there is no happy ending, only realizations and this film captures the familiar impact in a way that's rarely seen.",1526169600,,390,5.015384615384615

8413365,1,B0042AGNBE,"Watch it up until 104.17.  You'll have a wonderful, uplifting love story. Then turn it off. The rest makes no sense, there were no clues, and the work that should have been done to explain what then went on was abandoned in favor of using dementia as a catchall.  But dementia doesn't work the way they're trying to sell it.  You had an entire scenario of people and places and where they lived and worked, etc.  Suddenly it all changed completely and this was put down to dementia but dementia isn't that complete and consistent.  The twist that so many accept was just nonsense. I hate it when they make a lazy thing like this.",1523318400,2,629,4.434782608695652

8413367,5,B0042AGNBE,"""Lovely, Still"" sat on my Amazon Prime watchlist since I began my subscription two or three months ago.  I'd never heard of it and added it mainly because Rotten Tomatoes gave it 71% and because Martin Landau and Ellyn Burstyn are outstanding actors.  Recently watched movies I've enjoyed are, ""Blackhawk Down,"" ""Sicario,"" and ""Bone Tomahawk,"" So ""a romantic drama with a twist"" wasn't high on my list of must-sees.  But...wow.  How could ""Lovely, Still"" not have been nominated for multiple Academy Awards?  Made in 2008 for $5 million, ""Lovely, Still"" was nominated for ""Best First Screenplay"" at the ""Independent Spirit Awards.""  Great story and Oscar-worthy performances by Landau and Burstyn.  It's one of those movies I'll watch again, probably sooner rather than later.",1522108800,,776,5.260162601626016
