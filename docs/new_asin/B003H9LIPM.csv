4124761,5,B003H9LIPM,"This time they finally got it right with the packaging. The type of packaging used better secures the DVDs, and each DVD has it own storage space to where the DVDs are kept separate. I'm very happy with the packaging and I can now give five stars.

What is neat about this season is that it has sequels to previous episodes. These are the ones I will focus on.

* Mary 25: Sequel to Valerie 23. The Innobotics Corporation needs business so a project manager introduces Mary 25, a robot designed to be a nanny. Mary 25 uses the same Valerie 23 design and this bothers management and probably for good reason:
the Valerie 23 fiasco. Because of that management rejects the Mary 25 project. The project manager offers to field test Mary 25 in his home. His wife does not like that idea and problems do arise. A technician is assigned to work out the bugs. Also it is apparant that the project manager is abusing his wife and that bothers the technician because of a past relationship. He still has feelings for her. He then programs Mary 25 to turn on the project manager thus killing him. However the episode kicker is when it's reveal what happened to the Valerie 24 model.

* Promised Land: Sequel to The Camp. In The Camp the prisoners overpower their captors and are now free. Now they must deal with a earth that the alien invaders of years past pretty much ruined. The fruit that grows is poison. Now there are aliens on earth who are decendants of the alien race who invaded earth. Members from the camp encounter such a group of aleins. These aliens are not hostile but misunderstandings and the inability to communicate result in fighting. One young camp member is severely hurt. In the end the two sides reconcile and start to understand one another. The aleins even help heal the injured camp member and the episode ends with that the two sides will live in peace.

* The Origin of Species: Sequel to Double Helix. In the first episode a professor chooses six students (3 Male, 3 female) and takes them to what is a space ship. They board and the ship takes off. Everyone thinks they are going to the alien homeworld. Strange things happen: Two people vanish, the ship takes on a different shape, and students disappear into moving walls. Eventually the ship does land but not on an alien world but rather back on Earth-hunderds of years into the future. They find that the human race destroyed themselves with genetic engineering that unleashed an illness that wiped them out. The alien race that built the ship forsaw this and created the ship to save a sample of the human race. And while out in space, the ship took genetic material from all on board to create babies to repopulate the earth.

There are a couple of other standout episodes.

* Nightmare: Earth is at war with an alien race and a military ship is captured and all on board taken prisoner. Everyone is subject to a brutal form of interrogation as well as physical and psychological torture. The ship was carrying a bomb and one of the crew members who helped design design it activates it-and disables all the failsafes. They're on an alein world with no means of escape so lets strike a blow at the enemy. There's just one slight problem. They are not on the alien world, but on earth all along. The individuals were being tested. Now the bomb has been activated and there is no way to disarm it. The episode ends with the bomb detonating.

* In Our Own Image: Innobotics Corporation creates a new produce: The Mac 27. It is designed to be a labor robot. One goes rogue, kills a handler, takes a hostage and goes to an abandoned building. Mac 27 makes its hostage-thought to be a secretary-to perform repair work. The hostage is able to see memories of Mac 27 which are experiments on other robots as well as robots turning on their creators(flashbacks from previous episodes are used to portray this which I think is neat of this series). It may be these memories causing Mac 27 to act the way it has. It turns out the hostage was actually a troubleshooter sent to try and solve those problems and under the pretense of performing a repair she disables Mac 27. Turns out Mac 27 figured everything out and was not disabled. Mac 27 gets the needed information and activates all the other Mac 27 units who do turn on the creator and head out into society.

All the episodes were good but these stand out and I don't think space will allow me do describe them all. Again Amazon did it's usual good job of getting the item to me in a timely manner. I used the free Super Saver shipping and it did not take long to get the item. I enjoyed Sesaon 4 and look forward to Season 5 which is on order. Again thanks.",1338595200,2,4682,4.4678362573099415
4124762,5,B003H9LIPM,"Loved this TV series in the nineties. Great science fiction in self-contained stories (one does not have to watch all the episodes in order - as they stand alone). Season 4 does have more episodes (on an extra disc) that the other 6 seasons.

The point of me writing this review is the packaging issue mentioned in other reviews. I recently picked this season up from a vendor other than Amazon. The packaging was better/different than described by other reviewers (I do own seasons of this show with the exact terrible packaging that others have described). I seems that the manufacturer may be using better/different cases for these series at this point. The new packaging has a black soft plastic case (with its own artwook) within the outer cardboard cover. Each disc is seated in the case with its own retainer center ring - no disc sits on top of another. The discs will stay put in shipping and will/did not rub against each other - no discs were scratched in shipping or handling. I also receved Season 2 of this series (from a 3rd vendor) and it came in the same new packaging. (Neither season appears to be a bootleg - both are Canadien released.)

I have no idea when the manufacturer changed the packaging - or how much bad packaging was produced before this change was made, but you may not get the bad packaging with these seasons at this point.

(I did recently pick up Seasons 3,5,6, and 7 - not from Amazon - and these seasons came in the bad packaging. I would say 4-5 discs - per season - in the bad packaging were scrathed - however, with spot checking all the discs I received, seemed to play ok on my player.)

Bottom line: if you order these you take a risk in getting scratched discs, HOWEVER, there does seem to be some new packaging with these that increase the chances of getting your discs in perfect condition.

Take care and good luck.

PLEASE add a review if you order these from Amazon and you get the new packaging. I'd be curious to know.",1332374400,2,1972,4.479108635097493
4124763,2,B003H9LIPM,"I was sooo looking fwd to getting these. I am very unhappy about the poor picture quality on them. There are horizontal lines that are moving in the background that almost look like the frame is jumping. It is on all the DVDs I received. I was so in hopes that it would be good quality since I love this season the best. I was going to return them, but decided to keep them since the picture quality is slightly better when I view them on my computer. I already have an excellent DVR copy of ""THE VACCINE"" but when the DVR box fails it will be gone. That is really the only one I wanted. I am very sad that it is SO HARD to find good quality OUTER LIMITS shows. Won't some one take up the gauntlet and make us some QUALITY copies of this TV show? The star rating is for the quality of picture not the shows themselves--that season 4 was the BEST!!",1325462400,6,847,4.077844311377246
4124764,1,B003H9LIPM,This not the series from Showtime don't buy this Its the Canada edited version the only American version of this series is season 1 and is not edited i'm hoping Time life or some other company comes out with the full versions of these shows. Because the series is awesome. I will be waiting till then.,1325203200,10,301,4.392857142857143
4124765,5,B003H9LIPM,"This is an excellent show, I bought all the seasons. Unfortunately the DVD packaging from Canada is absolutely useless and damaging to the DVDs. The majority of the DVD sets arrived with DVDs loose and damaged. I have a machine that resurfaces the DVDs and that is what I had to do with many of them. I now have them in individual sleeves so the damage will not continue to happen. Since only season 1 has been released in the US and a compilation set was released as well, I had no choice but to order the Canadian releases. I am glad I did even though I had to do some disc restoring. If you can fix your DVDs I would recommend getting this series in its entirety.",1321056000,,666,4.2109375
4124766,5,B003H9LIPM,"Yes, the cd retainers are a JOKE. The discs will arrive scratched. Nothing can be done with the plastic retainers. I simply pull on them slightly and the inserts come right out. I recycle the plastic. I put the dvds in plastic slip cases. This is one of the best seasons I have seen. I was very entertained. I have five seasons of the New Outer Limits. This season is well worth your time and money.",1306108800,2,399,4.2631578947368425
4124767,3,B003H9LIPM,"I agree with previous reviewers that this has to be the worst designed packaging I have ever seen for holding DVDs. I rate the episodes 4-stars.  I would have rated the episodes 5-stars - except Canadian Home Video censored them to remove the occasional female bare breast that was shown in the MGM releases. However the boxes all these Canadian Home Video DVDs came in rates 0-stars, so I am giving this product an overall rating of 3-stars.

To keep from damaging the Outer Limits DVDs trying to remove them from the Canadian box, or while putting them back in, I found the best way is to put all the DVDs into an empty ""spindle"" box that had originally held blank CDs or DVDs.

I bought all 6 of the Canadian Home Video sets (Seasons two thru seven), dumped the boxes, & put all the Outer Limits DVDs (in order) into an empty spindle box that I had originally bought from Staples & that had held 40 blank DVD+RW discs. Now I can easily lift out any year & episode I want to watch, without having to fight the stupid little plastic clips holding each DVD in its Canadian box. The season number, disk number, & episode name are clearly shown on top of each DVD, so it is easy to find the one I want.  Problem solved.",1287187200,5,1217,4.324561403508772

8396936,5,B003H9LIPM,"I love this whole series and plan to order the remaining seasons I don't yet have.  I did not have any problems with the format of the dvd's - my dvd player is getting up there in years but there was no issue with playback.  The only issue was the condition the box set arrived - the plastic holders inside the case were damaged.  None of the dvd's were damaged though and so, I give this order five stars.
