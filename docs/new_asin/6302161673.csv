About 15 mins of cartoons recorded onto an EP tape? Come on...!
Wait for someone to have the good sense to release the lot on DVD - with the amount of Marvel movies doing the rounds at the moment it can't be that far away.",1051574400,,399,4.333333333333333
7822094,5,6302161673,This is some old classic Marvel cartoons with the primative animation. I only wish they would release a complete set with all the episodes. I am sure they are in an archive somewhere.  Why is it that Marvel fans are not asking for more of these classic masterpieces of animation.  I loved some of the old comics converted into limited animation in this one. The voices are just right. Subby himself was voiced by a prominent actor who I don't remember here.  All in all it's a treat for those who forgot these things existed so long ago.,1024704000,8,537,4.459183673469388
7822095,4,6302161673,"It's nice to see the Avenging Son in action again, and ""Atlantis..."" showed exactly that. Namor had to deal with a whole lot of problems. Neptune's Trident and Lord Vashti were missing, Lady Dorma got caught in quicksand, Atlantis was at the brink of warfare, and Attuma, who plotted the scheme, was about to take over the throne. But in the end, Namor triumphed and Attuma winded up with a bell around his neck as a sign of defeat (ow-chie!)
  Next is ""Doctor Doom's Day"", and it has everything! Doom's plan of world conquest (again?) started with an army of villians at his command...and the Avengers and the X-Men defeated them. But no problem, Doom had ""plan-B"" with Namor's name on it, which meant...uh, doom for the heroes involved. Luckily, Namor dealt with Doom, who escaped, as usual, and all was well...for now.
  The only complaints about the episodes were the powers Namor never had (the ability to communicate with fish and in his fight with Doom when his absorbed and discharged electicity like an electric eel) and deceptive advertising (in the 2nd feature, Thor wasn't the only Avenger there and Wolverine never appeared). But all in all, you'll enjoy this Silver Age classic. Imperious Rex!",1013990400,,1207,4.844660194174757
