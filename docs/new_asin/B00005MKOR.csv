7945701,3,B00005MKOR,"I purchased this DVD as it was focused around Nick Kurzon whom I once knew. He was a non committal heart breaker who enjoyed chasing women, leading them on, then breaking their heart. He was a classic 'Love Avoider'. Guys like Nick Kurzon should wear a warning. His disrespect for women was sad. It was interesting to know I was not the only one.",1481500800,,346,4.421875
7945702,5,B00005MKOR,"Being an independent film maker myself (who isn't now days, I mean, in the 80's everyone was writing a book, the 90's musicians...etc.) I recommend this documentary as a look at how it is done.  It isn't expensive equipment that makes a great documentary, it is a good story and teller.",1409788800,,286,4.607843137254902
7945703,2,B00005MKOR,"I've now watched Always a Bridesmaid and recent release First Comes Love. While I admire Nina's courage to bare all and really show how human she is behind both documentaries, I felt like both were self-serving productions that left much to be desired. I expected Always a Bridesmaid to give some insight into that 30something mark for women who are still single, yet the film felt like Nina's main objective was to simply complain about dating a younger guy who (like all men, who don't really grow up and get ready to settle until 28-32), just wasn't ready. I would think this would have been blindingly apparent with all of the footage from the film - especially to its director who pieced everything together... but, I guess hindsight is 20/20.

I will say however there is a gem at the end of Always a Bridesmaid when we meet the 90-year-old ever single woman who finally finds her love and marries - Nina captures the beauty in their wisdom and relationship perfectly... First comes love is the same when she revisits videos from her parents' youth. I just wish that more than ten minutes of her films could be devoted to such insight - and I hope if she continues to make more films, and sees this review, she may take that into consideration. Best - SJL",1390348800,,1261,4.579646017699115
7945704,3,B00005MKOR,"My feelings are in between on this documentary. On one hand, I was annoyed by just how much she spoke of marriage and the sense of urgency that she felt. She was with a man that clearly had commitment issues but she continued to press. She tended to whine-though that was more in the 'sequel,' ""First Comes Love.""

 But at the same time, this is an accurate depiction of some women when they feel they're at a turning point in their lives. She made this documentary without editing out things that didn't portray her in the best light. Indeed she was self-depreciating and that's one of the things I liked. She knew how this film made her look but was determined to show the desperation many women feel.",1376697600,,703,4.484375
7945705,4,B00005MKOR,"Okay, so it isn't the most comfortable film to watch. I'm sure plenty of female viewers will see some of their own emotion reflected in this work, as the film maker (who is, ironically, a wedding photographer) confronts her own feelings about marriage, love, having children...and her hopes and dreams for the future.

  Her situation? She is in a difficult relationship. She feels the clock ticking. She has a certain scenario in mind for her future but her boyfriend isn't exactly leaping at the chance to hop on board the marriage train. So she is stuck, somewhere between here and there, wondering if she should wait for the guy she loves...or move on in hopes of finding another match. It is a dilemna plenty of women (and men) face...stay or go, compromise one's dreams for love or hope to love as deeply with someone else? Face the possibility of regret or open one's arms to a different future?

  I was moved by this film, felt it was told as honestly as possible.",1152057600,,973,4.627906976744186
7945706,5,B00005MKOR,"This movie gives us an interesting insight into a 30 year old woman's perspective on marriage and, therefore, life. However, it is clearly not an essay on the topic but a rather touching and honest portrayal of a human being's (albeit one armed with a movie camera) quest for self understanding.

If you do not like documentaries you may not be as interested, but I did find it moving and specially relevant in a country such as mine (Colombia) where an unmarried woman in her thirties is considered Smithsonian material.

PS: By the way... I'm a guy; ovaries are not a prerequisite to feel related or ""get"" the movie's message.

PS2: Do check out Nina's other movie: Parallel Lines.",1151280000,,683,4.722689075630252
7945707,5,B00005MKOR,"Nina Davenport seems to ask the question in ALWAYS A BRIDESMAID:  Do you wait for the funny, compatible person you're with to get over his fear of long-term commitment, or do you keep moving, in the hope that you will find someone just as perfect for you who IS ready to take the next step?  She seems to prefer the former, but feels maybe the latter might be wiser (& her friends support the latter).  At 30, she exposes her own neuroses about wanting to settle down, get married, and have kids in a few years, as well as those of her 5-years-younger boyfriend Nick, who seems to be very gun-shy about commiting much at all.  She also profiles some of the clients of her wedding videography day-job and gets her friends & family's take on her situation.  There are also very interesting reminiscinces from elderly spinsters that Nina (and I) found fascinating, as well as reality-checks about whether one can have a purposeful, full life without marriage.

Below I have what probably wouldn't be considered a spoiler, but I guess there might be someone out there who might consider it one.  So, if you are avidly, paranoidly against learning specifics about a movie or book before you see/read it for the first time, don't read any more.  Just rent this DVD.

POSSIBLE SPOILER:  Nina had the very interesting (& possibly a little uncomfortable) opportunity to ask Nick's last girlfriend if she had any advice about having a relationship with him, and why it hadn't worked out for them.

I highly recommend this documentary's unflinching, highly personal look at Nina's relationships, as well as those of the people she profiles.",1146960000,,1629,4.7821428571428575
7945708,5,B00005MKOR,"I saw this documentary in a theatre when it showed in NY and remember being so impressed with what the filmmaker had been able to do.  She wove her own personal story into the broader story of other womens' lives, and marriage in general, and it made for a really interesting movie.  Some of the moments she captured (like a birthday party for her boyfriend where his ex-girlfriend was also there) were just fascinating.  Totally worthwhile to see this movie.",1086048000,2,459,4.7125
7945709,1,B00005MKOR,"I expected Harvard alum Nina Davenport to create an insightful film about marriage and women's choices around it. (Do women's expectations of marriage change years after the ceremony? How? ). Instead, I found this film to be a whiny, needy inspection of the filmmaker's frustration with her boyfriend who -- true to stereotype -- can't commit. In between, she jealously analyzes the couples whose weddings she films. To watch this intelligent director/writer/producer/editor do nothing more than dissect her boyfriend's statements with her friends and family, and endlessly discuss whether she should stay with him, was painful. In good faith, I watched till the bitter end. I regret that I didn't turn it off after 10 minutes.",1078790400,4,727,5.275862068965517
7945710,4,B00005MKOR,"I found this documentary to be more than moving! From beeing torn with feelings of beeing alone or beeing in love, you will see it all.  This movie is great for all walks of life.  I recomend this to any who are unsure of themselves as a companion to those looking desprately for one.",1026691200,2,284,4.2407407407407405
