8710278,5,B00VJ6D2SQ,"Plant Ant is a very well done documentary about ants, in particular Leaf Cutter Ants. We watched this because my 2nd grader is doing research for leaf cutter ants for school. It is very well done and was enjoyed by the whole family. It is pretty long (90 minutes), but kept the kid's attention. Among many things,  learned about the caste system for the ants, that they are eusocial insects, that they use collective swarm intelligence and what ant colony optimization is.",1460246400,,472,4.7560975609756095
