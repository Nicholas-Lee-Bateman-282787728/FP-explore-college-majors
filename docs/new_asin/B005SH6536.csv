4884843,3,B005SH6536,"I love the series and have bought every set up to this point, but the aspect ratio disappoints me on this one. From episode 190 onward, these episodes should be in 16:9 format, and why no blu ray? Even the extras for 190+ have widescreen, but they choose to crop to 4:3 for the episodes themselves. Why is this now being produced as though it's 2002? In 2012, just make a 16:9 release in HD.",1332633600,6,391,4.226666666666667
4884844,1,B005SH6536,"I really wish they would have just released the New Captain arc in one set.  Could easily be skipped then much like the Bount sets if you don't care for the filler.  Releasing it like this with three or four cannon episodes just shows a complete disregard for the product.  Hated the filler, loved the non-recap canon episodes that this set has.  Guess this means I'll have to get this set.  Bad enough you only get 13 episodes for the same price as the older sets that had double the episodes, now I have to pay that just to get the three or four I want.",1326672000,13,555,4.19811320754717
4884845,1,B005SH6536,"This filler arc drags on forever. Sure it has a few good bits here and there, but the villains are uninteresting, everything drags on and the voice actors themselves seem uninterested.

Not to mention, it's COMPLETELY detracted from the canon episodes left off from the Hueco Mundo arc. A big waste of time in the Bleach universe, none of it is canon and overall, a big step DOWN from Bleach's standards.",1326499200,7,404,4.690140845070423
4884846,4,B005SH6536,"So this dvd has the end of the New Captain Arc. That is not exactly a bad thing and I actually found the season to be enjoyable. It wasn't as good as the main story line but I did like it more than the Bount Arc. There is a lot of action and parts of it remain funny too. They've struck a nice balance between serious and light-hearted, so in itself it isn't a bad season. If you wanted to you could skip over it of course but...

Episodes 190-193 are not part of the New Captain Arc!!!!!!!!! They are the continuation of the main story line!
The last four episodes in this set are the beginning of season 10. Now one could always say that Bleach does enough recaps during the episodes that one could continue the story when they come out with uncut box set 13...but these are not filler episodes. They are quality great episodes, and shouldn't be missed.

Bottom line: decent season, but if you want to follow the story you need to see the last 4 episodes on this set. I liked the season so I won't feel like I'm just paying for 190, 191, 192, and 193 but hey, to each his own.",1326412800,14,1078,4.15311004784689

Ok boy can see ghosts, some ghosts eat other ghosts so there r other ghosts that stop the bad ghosts from eating the good ones, boy meets girl good ghost that gives him the power to become like her so that he can fight the bad ghosts.
I know that the bad ghosts r call something and r a little different than just ghosts and that the ones I'm calling good ghosts r called something else also.
I'm just trying to make it simple here ok. ^_^
I really do love this anime just don't want to go into great detail on what is what when someone just wants to know the basics of what they maybe buying even though if ur looking for a anime u most likely already know what ur looking for or buying if ur here.

4884938,5,B005SH6536,The best Bleach story arc yet is what you get if you buy box set 12. The story about Rurichiyo gets hotter. The new Captain of squad 3 is actually the mastermind behind Rurichyo's assassination attempt. He has a grudge against Head Captain Yamamoto. Ichigo goes after the new captain to stop him from killing the Head Captain. This is a very cool story arc. We get a little bit of insight into the past of Yamamoto and a good look into the man's character. This is not a box set that you want to miss.,1351468800,2,501,4.229166666666667
4884939,2,B005SH6536,"...and thats for the final four episodes on the third disk. These are the only episodes that have anything to do with the Arrancar saga. I don't know whats more disgusting, the awful filler arc (Though still its no where near as bad as The Bount <shudders>)or the fact that I have to pay $30 just for four episodes. I litterally only kept the last disk and threw the first two away.

That being said the last four episodes are very good and definately need to be watched before the next set comes out (dont want to spoil anything but major plot points are revealed).

In conclusion get this only if you really care about the MAIN story and even then you only need to watch the final disk. And to VIZ please stop screwing us and just release box sets with 20 or more episodes. Funiamtion releases ENTIRE series, 26 episodes or more for less then what Viz charges us for 10!",1339804800,,872,4.343558282208589
4884940,2,B005SH6536,"The 2 stars is obviously not for the show it self. Its for Viz media and there ridiculous prices for what you get. 1) Its only 3 discs and 13 episodes
2) You can't even call it a box set any more. It's just a dvd case with 3 disc inside of it. LAAAAME!!!",1335744000,,254,3.7222222222222223

This Ark basically ends at episode 189. 190 - 193 is a new season and it continues the previous Ark in set 10.
The new Captain Amagai Shusuke Ark has it ups and downs. It had some good fights but most of them it was the story of Rurichiyo. I gave this set 4 stars for the last 4 episodes that continue the main storyline",1335312000,,534,4.095238095238095
4884942,1,B005SH6536,"I feel like the previous reviews with 5 stars are part of a plot by Viz to improve their ratings... like who would say that it was a good price and/or value.  I love this series.  I absolutely love it, and if I was offered a deal that I could not consider just a slap in the face, I would buy it.  I have to watch it on hulu plus or weird websites that I get viruses from, but I won't buy this again until they start charging appropriate prices.",1335225600,3,445,3.922222222222222

8485015,4,B005SH6536,"If it weren't for the last 4 episodes on this set I'd say skip it. This filler arc isn't complete crap, but it does completely interrupt the Arrancar arc in a way that doesn't fit with the storyline at all. It's very jarring, but at least it's not a total piece of crap like so many fillers.

Sadly if you want the complete Arrancar arc, you will have to purchase this set for the last few episodes on here. I'm sure Viz cut the DVD's the way they did so that there was canon in every set. Because I can guarantee they would have lost a lot of revenue from people refusing to buy the filler arc sets. I have no idea who wrote most of them for Bleach but I'm convinced it's partially their fault Bleach anime was cancelled before the manga was finished. Because most of the filler arcs were truly horrific stories and sometimes even worse animation.

Get this one as cheap as possible because you're only paying for 4 real episodes. Still this filler arc is at least worth one viewing, unlike some others.",1529020800,,1004,4.335106382978723

8485023,3,B005SH6536,"Contains half-filler/half-canon episodes, which makes this a necessary volume albeit at bit of a frustrating one. The ""Captain Amagai"" arc isn't badly written or animated, but interrupts the middle on the ""Hueco Mundo"" arc and is nearly impossible to place in the timeline. It's still enjoyable, but once the main story resumes, I was left wondering how the ""Amagai"" arc could have happened (the ""Bount arc"" while long and tedious, at least fir itself into the timeline and actually foreshadowed some things for the final ""Quincy Arc"")

Moving on, the second half of this volume is excellent, and necessary for the complete main story, resuming the Hueco Mundo arc, full of surprises for some characters (if you haven't read the manga). If you skip to the next volume without this one, there's a large gap in the story.

Definitely worth checking out as well are the ""Omakes"", even the ones during the ""Captain Amagai"" arc, my favorites of which being the ""Quincy Encyclopedia"" segments, featuring Isshin Kurosaki and Ryuken Ishida.",1493942400,,1032,5.064705882352941
