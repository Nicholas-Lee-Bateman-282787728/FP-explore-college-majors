3418556,5,B0018QOIWG,"Although this is a 90 minute DVD, it really could be watched over two sessions -- there is a LOT of information in it.

This presentation makes very clear that depression has many forms, many treatments and that not everything works for everyone.  It interviews people from all walks of life who have (and have had) despressive episodes -- including teens, adults and older adults, black, white, gay, straight, etc.  The DVD addresses depression that is ""caused"" by trauma, post-partum depression, and depression which seems to come from nowhere.

This is an excellent introduction to the world of depression.  It would be particularly useful for watching with someone who knows little about depression and/or some who has some misconceptions or mis-information about the topic.

Importantly, the presentation does not advocate any particular treatment, but instead explores how some sufferers have used medication, others used talk therapy, some used shock treatment, some used in patient treatment, and some used a combination of these.  A key point that is well made is that most who have used medication find that they must try several different medications before they find one that works well for them.",1300838400,21,1208,5.227979274611399
3418557,5,B0018QOIWG,"Great survey on current thinking about this devastating, but so often treatable, illness.  As another reviewer noted, don't skip the Jane Pauley interview of some experts at the end.

From my experience, I am a fan of long-term psychotherapy as a remedy for depression rooted in childhood trauma as the case of  Dashaun Jiwe Morris indicated, although it does take patience and money (or good insurance, which also requires money).  I do think meds may be warranted and helpful in certain cases, however, especially when needed for stabilization early in treatment even if not needed later as healing is progressing.  I also have found the Swiss sociologist-psychologist Alice Miller's books helpful in understanding how childhood trauma produces adult depression.  Terry Real, a U.S. psychotherapist, also has some good books that tackle especially well the issue of trauma to boys and how male-female dynamics in patriarchy have caused this but can be repatterned.

Although the DVD is excellent, the DVD might have been improved by looking more at the sociological issues such as:

1. Women's and minorities' lesser status (especially traditionally before the Civil Rights Movement and the Women's Movement but still, alas, true to some degree today - hopefully not forever) making them more prone to depression;
2. CEOs and other high-ranking people perhaps falling prey to a common fallacy in our cultural thinking that being at the top will fix everything in your life (when it in fact can make you more lonely, ""it's lonely at the top,"" no?);
3. Workaholism being used as type of dysfunctional self-medication;
4. The fact that fathers can suffer from new infant depression too.

I also suspect our very wealthy country's focus on competitive achievement, especially in work environments, without setting any boundaries on this for parenting and family life for BOTH sexes, plays a huge role in this problem.

Maybe we'll fix this this century?  To me fixing it would mean both (a) successfully treating more people who get it, and (b) preventing it more successfully by getting at some of the mother/father-attachment & support, family system and sociological issues that create it (as noted in the DVD, only 30% of depression appears to be genetic in origin; environmental causes trigger it and make it worse).",1286582400,19,2319,5.17379679144385
3418558,5,B0018QOIWG,"What can I say that others haven't already expressed very eloquently?  The movie reviews the diagnosis of Depression, along with most of the treatments currently available, and most importantly, includes excellent interviews with a wide variety of people from all walks of life, who suffer with this illness.  Because of my own history with this illness, this was an extremely ACCURATE AND COMPASSIONATE documentary.  I feel, in fact, that it should be shown in ""health education"" classes in high schools, just as we have ""sex education"".  Many young people suffer from mental illness, but have no way to identify it, or ""name"" it.  A truly wonderful, informational, documentary.  Highly recommended.  I would recommend this to my patients, and the families of patients, with Major Depressive Disorder.",1273104000,72,802,5.317460317460317
3418559,5,B0018QOIWG,I think the movie is really great if you want to understand how it feels as one who are suffering from the illness.,1250380800,11,115,4.043478260869565
3418560,5,B0018QOIWG,Our 19yr. old daughter has been going through depression with some ocd. We have been trying to get her to seek counseling but wants to try to battle this on her own for now. It seems her depression comes and goes in a cycle every few months since Sept. Watching this video has given my husband and myself more insight and information about the illness. We especially liked the info. that Jane Pauley gave at the end. I just hope my daughter will consider watching this also. I would recommend this to anyone that is seeking more info. on depression because it gives real life accounts of people's situations.,1239667200,49,608,4.587155963302752
3418561,4,B0018QOIWG,"While some of the information in this DVD has been around for a while, there is also quite a bit of new, interesting data included. Yes, depression has a stigma and often needs to be talked about in an open, treatment-minded style. I found the work on brain surgery as a treatment for some types of depression very interesting. Since I am a college student studying attachment theories and post-partum depression, I particularly found the work done with babies and mothers interesting and relevant. PBS shows are seldom a waste of time, and the discussion by a CEO from The Fortune 100 business world was worth the price of this DVD. I recommend it.",1211760000,74,649,4.701754385964913

3418563,3,B0018QOIWG,"The response from my group was, ""It's Depressing"" and ""So, basically you have to take medication"".  I agree.  I'd like another video that has more therapy based treatment and a more optimistic vibe.  I've seen people overcome Depression in many ways.  This video is more focused on medication.  And the cases seem more severe than the average patient.",1436486400,,351,4.982758620689655

3418565,5,B0018QOIWG,"You will not regret purchasing this DVD. This program is highly recommended for anyone who is suffering from depression or would like to learn about what depression really is. In my experience, knowing the neurological basis for what was happening helped make it easier to accept that it was a disease like any other, rather than some kind of failing in myself, and thus made it easier to seek help. This video made a big difference.",1428969600,3,433,4.7105263157894735

3418568,5,B0018QOIWG,The people speaking about their depression and the professionals help any layman to understand the illness and help the person afflicted to not feel so alone and to learn that there are solutions.

3418570,5,B0018QOIWG,"This documentary is an excellent lengthy film on severe depression. It covers both unipolar and bi-polar episodes of what severe
depression is and what it is not. There are interviews with therapists and patients whom have been institutionized and have received
medication therapy; shock therapy; and interpersonal therapy (one-on-one). This documentary also covers suicidal patients. Thank
goodness it is not all about teenagers, but, it gives you a broad range of adults whom have been tramatized by various forms of mental illness. If you are suffering from severe depression than this documentary is for you and your loved ones and well worth
the money. This documentary also covers patients whom medication and pyschotherapy has not worked. Please watch this program.
I first started watching it from my public library several times and now I purchased it. Excellent documentary.  ------- Mrs. D.L. WC.

Still not certain how to best relate to him, and wish the program had provided more data on how parents can best help adult children with this problem.",1374710400,,304,4.446428571428571
3418572,5,B0018QOIWG,"I am a mental health educator and I use this video often in middle school & high school classrooms.  This documentary depicts the stories of various young adults and older adults who have dealt with some type of mental illness.  It gives their background and also what helped them.  I love that it has 3 young people who deal with depression, bi-polar, and PTSD.  It's still current and relevant and the students I show it to really seem to relate and enjoy it!  This video is an excellent resource.",1372809600,9,499,4.561797752808989

3418574,5,B0018QOIWG,I love this film because it brought out reasons why so many people I know act the way they do.  Many people don't realize that they are depressed which causes problems for family and friends who slowly depart from them.,1368230400,2,219,4.475
3418575,4,B0018QOIWG,Good quality.  We use for educational film and need this type of qulity and current film to hold interest of patients.,1360972800,,118,4.619047619047619
3418576,5,B0018QOIWG,"This is a helpful video for anybody impacted with the terrible disease of Depression. Mental Health issues are one of my ""special interest topics"". As I can afford, I get as many DVDs on Mental Health issues, especially Alzheimer's disease and related Dementias. I am caregiver of one afflicted with what her doctor has diagnosed ""multi-infarct dementia"". It ""looks"" like Alzheimer's Disease, but nothing can be prescribed for this person. I am also afflicted with Dysthymia. This video addresses several different disorders ""under the umbrella"" of Depression - major Depression, BiPolar Disease, Dysthymia, and some of the diagnostic criterion for each. It is not a ""dry"" presentation of facts. The viewer is introduced to several different people in this video, each afflicted with one or other of the disorders.

I think this video would be a good purchase, especially for people like me, a sufferer, a caregiver, professionals caring for people with this group of disorders. It might be a little too ""technical"" for a person who doesn't have some medical knowledge. But, I am glad I purchased it and have viewed it three times, so far. I intend to view it additional times in the future as well. There is nothing I wish I had known prior to purchasing this video. It is worth every penny I paid for it.",1341014400,5,1306,4.909502262443439
3418577,5,B0018QOIWG,"If you only see one documentary about depression, you should see this one. It has interviews with both sufferers and doctors. It talks about treatment, depression in men, women, children, possible causes, and offers hope.

Although it's a PBS documentary it's surprisingly very engaging, unlike its ""Men Get Depression"" (which is good in content if you can stay awake).

It doesn't romanticize depression like ""The Bridge"" does, but instead shows the toll it takes on the sufferers as well as their loved ones.

My favorite part is the interview with Andrew Solomon, the author of ""The Noonday Demon,"" who has to take a formidable cocktail of medicines just to stay ""sane."" It really lets you appreciate the gravity of some people's illnesses, which - to the skeptics of the medication's necessity - doubtlessly require medication to manage.

It's a must watch for anyone looking to learn more about depression.",1336435200,5,911,5.093959731543624
3418578,4,B0018QOIWG,Refreshing! This video scratches the surface. However is packed with useful information to help explain depression to those that have no clue. The first time I watched it I was in tears. The explanation that author gave was dead on. This does not blame the person in fact gives a name to what's going on. I would have giving five stars if it would have giving more info of what to do. Overall a must see.,1325289600,15,404,4.328947368421052
