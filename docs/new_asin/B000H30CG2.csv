8136142,5,B000H30CG2,Loved the series. Great stories right from the police blotter. Makes you feel that you were back in the day!!! Great purchase. I hope this series makes it way to TV rather than some of fictitious stories they want us to believe.. These are the real thing!!!,1444608000,,257,4.48936170212766
