4334466,5,B004DTLK76,"I am a long time fan of Karen Kingsbury.  I read the book long before the movie, I was a bit dissappointed with the movie, but also realize what producers are trying to accomplish; a larger audience by cutting religion out.  Although I do not agree, I will say I hope that if a movie about the Baxter Family ever surfaces, she will go to the producing team from Fireproof!  I too think the little snippets about learning to pray, and having God by his side all the time, was a HUGE part of the book and the story!  I also didn't like the way they portrayed the relationship with the biological father and son as ""good"" from day one, when in the book, it was obviously a struggle from day one!  I highly recommend reading the book, to be able to relate to this inspirational story!",1296604800,3,780,4.27891156462585
4334467,3,B004DTLK76,THIS MOVIE WAS A GOOD MOVIE BUT THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE A CHRISTIAN MOVIE AND WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT NOONE ECKNOWLEDGED GOD. I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT SOME OF THESE MOVIES JUST THROW A LITTLE BIT OF CHURCH IN IT AND IT BECOMES A CHRISTIAN MOVIE.IT HAD WONDERFUL ACTING BUT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEEN FAMILIES RELYING ON CHRIST OR TURNING TO CHRIST.,1296259200,4,345,4.492063492063492
4334468,1,B004DTLK76,"My wife read the book and was very much looking forward to going to see the movie. However, the movie was not true to the book in most of the christian aspects. Items such as the chikds cousins teaching him how to pray and more of the part where the family was in Haiti and the childs interactions with the Haitian children. The movie producers decided to only make the movie for a secular movie audience and left out all of the important christian aspects of the book. If you read the book first and then saw what they produced as a movie, you would seriously be disappointed in the movie. They ruined a perfectly good christian novel. I can't believe that Mrs. Kingsbury actually let the movie producers get away with what they left out.",1296259200,31,739,4.4411764705882355
4334469,2,B004DTLK76,"If you just see the movie and haven't read the book it seems like a fantastic movie, however, if you've read the book you will know that the ending fell flat compared to the book.  Molly and Jack became Christians at the end of the book and this was not the way the movie ended.  The book focused on God's redemptive power.  I really enjoy Karen Kingsbury novels, but the movie version of a terrific book by her was a huge disappointment.",1296086400,5,438,4.317073170731708
4334470,5,B004DTLK76,this movie is beautifully done and what a great cast and this movie gives a raw powerful message about what makes a family!,1296000000,2,123,4.391304347826087
4334471,3,B004DTLK76,"After 7 years in prison Rip Porter (Pepper) is released and comes home to find out he has a son that was given up for adoption.  He sets out to get him back.  A father who never knew his son (Pepper) wants a chance to raise him.  The only father the boy has known (Hauser) fights to keep him.  Due to a flaw in the prison system the adoption of the boy turns out to be fraudulent and a fight begins.  I have a feeling this kind of thing really happens.  This is not as good as I want it to be.  It was good, but TV movie good, like a really good Lifetime movie.  This movie is very emotional and you feel for the little boy the entire time and wish for his ordeal to be over.  This is yet another movie with a lot of potential but also falls flat.  It is a good movie just, again, could have been better.  When you watch make sure you give your lady kleenex.  I give it a B.

4334487,3,B004DTLK76,"This is a low budget movie with actors you probably haven't seen in anything but other made for TV movies, but the non famous cast does a brilliant acting job in this.  The only thing that lets them down and ultimately the viewing experience of the film down is the ending. without giving away what happens at this stage of the review, we've got big developments happening, then it's like they ran out of money, or what they had filmed so far took up the amount of time it was allowed to be (assuming this originally went straight to TV), so they just wrapped it up in a few minutes. Perhaps the Karen Kingsburg book of the same name does this too, I haven't read it, but experiencing the story as a standalone movie experience, that's what the film is like. This really should have been a longer movie, or perhaps a mini series. It has enough tension up to that stage, I as a viewer was invested into what was going to happen to have kept watching for longer.

This isn't a Christian movie or a preachy movie either, I notice a lot of religious extremists are rating this one star because it's not.  Just because the author the book the movie was based on normally writes under that genre doesn't mean they can't tackle something else or someone else can't adapt a niche market book to appeal to a regular audience.  I certainly wouldn't have enjoyed a preachy movie.  The basic plot of this one has a deadbeat arrested when the police turn up to his house and find his beaten cowering girlfriend.  He is sentenced to seven years in jail.  Like is sadly often the case his victim wants to rekindle their relationship upon his release.  The man of course claims he has changed, he's been rehabilitated and is sorry.  So she decides to tell him about the kid she gave birth to within nine months of his incarceration.  She tells him her mother forged his signature and they gave the kid up for adoption.  He's furious and wants the boy back.  The law apparently is on his side and the adopted parents are told their son will be given back to his biological dad.  Three visits are planned for Joey, on the second he will be told these friends are his biological parents, on the third he won't be coming back.  This is obviously devastating for the adoptive parents, who will do whatever they can to keep their son.

I think the movie lacks something that it could have been by making the biological father completely unlikable. This movie may have been more interesting and a better what would you do in this situation if perhaps Rip had been framed for a crime or went to jail for something safer for the child than beating his girlfriend to a pulp. If we saw him as a victim as well I think the film would have been more interesting.  But as it is you immediately side with the adoptive parents since you naturally want Joey to be safe.

Spoilers to do with the ending follow - For me it made absolutely no sense for Rip to give up his son.  He's turned down $2 million dollars, he's clearly a very selfish man who clearly sees Wendy as a possession and with the interactions with Joey he saw him as one as well.  He was really angry, punching mirrors and the like, and yet when we expect the biological parents to be arrested for trying to flee with their son we find out this doesn't anger him further, but makes him decide to give up all rights to see his son.  Wendy you could understand signing the paper since she did it once before and knows Joey is going to become a punching bag for Rip since she has become so again, but Rip signing the paper, no I didn't buy it at all.",1458518400,,3580,4.346846846846847

4334541,4,B004DTLK76,I watched this movie after reading the Karen Kingsbury book.  It followed the book fairly well.  Being an adoptive parent I could relate to the parents in the movie.  However I feel it brought up some horrible aspects that may or may not be realistic with today's adoption processes.  This plot was an issue in the 80's when we adopted our daughter and I lived with this fear in my heart for years. Today I hope the process has moved on to basically eliminate this fear. This was an entertaining film to watch but I'm glad I read the book first.,1396656000,,545,4.366336633663367

I think that the film would have benefitted from tighter editing as it seems to become repetitive in relating the story of infertility.  It could be upsetting to those couples who are in the process of trying to adopt.  Otherwise the film does depict the trial and error of adoptions which can cause upsetting consequences for the natural birth mother and the adoptive parents.

I had to paraphrase parts of the book to explain to others how different the DVD was from Kingsbury's theme.

4334591,4,B004DTLK76,"I'll admit, I thought I knew who would win it before I even watched the movie (I hadn't read the book in other words, still haven't, haven't got a chance yet). Things don't turn out as you expect. This is the second movie to do that that I've bought (the first being Sucker Punch), so it made it all the more enjoyable- ruining expectations while providing entertainment.
First hearing of Karen Kingsbury and seeing the covers of her books, I thought she may have been one of these completely traditional Christian authors. Then I checked out some of her writing, only to find out she does have gritty material. Watching this movie was no different- a husband going to jail after committing domestic violence after being drunk (and getting arrested), couples getting into heavy arguments (neither of which are that much into Christianity, but that shouldn't matter), and different forms of bribing.
When Richard ""Rip"" Porter gets of jail, his wife, Wendy, informs him that they had a child but, due to the circumstances then, she gave up their son for adoption. Now they want their child back. Only theirson's life with his adoptive family's a polar opposite from what they could have imagined- wealthy, blue-collar, a boat, they seem to have it all, yet get irritated when any friend tries to ask them to come to their church.
So begins the clash of the backgrounds, with bribes (either directly or through a politician wanting to do the right thing and can't believe his friend's lack of tact) and temptations to go back to dangerous habits.
Now, in case anyone gets on this movie's case for being ""religious"", my brother has enjoyed all my movies thus far and he hates religion, keep that in mind. He's apathetic abotut eh world and wishes Christianity would die off yet he enjoys my Christian movies without scoffing at any mention of God, Jesus, life, love, etc. that Christians are known for. This one was no exception.
I'll definitely admit that, though he's not in my top 5 fave actors, I do like Barry Pepper's acting (especially in Unknown as ""Rancher Shirt"" and Saving Private Ryan) as a struggling alcoholic trying to quit despite being harassed by Jack Campbell. I also liked how realistic Mira Sorvino's acting as Wendy was, as well as how emotional she got at the right times and her character's dilemma between her love for her child and deciding what the right thing to do was. Yes, I enjoyed Mira Sorvino in Mimic and The Final Cut (also one of the finest films where Robin Williams was actually serious instead of a comedian).
This film also shows how easy the legal system can be to manipulate and how easily manipulated the Church can be on any circumstance and how far people will go (without shame) to use one another for ulterior motives, no matter the meaning behind the motive.
The only thing I didn't like were a couple dry spots where it didn't feel quite organic enough to be believable. In a way that's surprising since Karen Kingsbury, who does great books, was on set to help out with the directing of the scenes and said in an interview that she wouldn't have changed a scene (so for the 1-star ratings who hated the film and said it wasn't like the book might as well dislike Karen since she enjoyed the production of the movie itself). And if anyone tries to condemn the film for being preachy, keep in mind- I can't stand traditionalism in the slightest and, though a scene does take place in an old-fashioned church, there's no preachiness (but a great choir singing), and having met the author personally, I can say that she is not a preachy girl at all, but very down-to-earth. Much like this film.",1333411200,,3637,4.675507020280811

4334593,5,B004DTLK76,"I thought this was a heart-wrenching and, at times, disturbing movie, but extremely well-done and worthwhile--not to mention suspenseful.

The movie portrays any adoptive parents' worst nightmare:  someone comes to your house and takes your beloved child away because the adoption agreement was forged many years ago.  The adoptive parents, out of sheer desperation, do everything they can think of to get their child back.

The birth parents, on the other hand, are also presented sympathetically.  After the husband is jailed for domestic abuse, the wife who, unknown to husband, is now pregnant, forges his name on the adoption papers so she can give the child away for the child's own good.  A few year's later, husband is released from prison, sober and determined to be a great husband to his long-suffering wife and start a family with her.  His wife reveals that they have a son who was given up for adoption.  Husband, realizing that he did not consent to the adoption, challenges it in court and wins.

The rest of the movie shows the adoptive parents doing everything they can to get their son back, while the birth parents do everything they can to earn the love of and make a home for their reluctant son, to whom they are complete strangers.

I thought it was a highly compelling film.  All of the characters were easy to relate to and sympathize with, but with visible and understandable flaws as well.  The ability to sympathize with all of the characters and their individual dilemmas is really what makes this movie work so well.  As a viewer, it was hard to know how it should end, because you were rooting for all of the characters.

Some will view this as a Christian movie.  I don't really see it that way, although there are certainly a number of Biblical applications one can draw from the film.  If you are not drawn to Christian films, I don't think this film will offend or alientate you.  If you are, you will readily see the Christian principles/values at work.

I thought this was a great film, and I really enjoyed it and was moved by it.  Give it a try.  You won't be sorry.

It probably is not suitable for elementary school children (my youngest is 11, and I think it would bother her at this point) due to the portrayal of domestic abuse and the trauma of parent-child separation.

The real parents don't give the child back to the prospective family after fighting.  Many (not all) prospective adoptive families get divorced.

Who would care about the many lapses in logic if it was just a comedy, or another of the many tired plots that are passed before us as film? But these are such emotionally charged issues: adoption reversals, domestic violence, alcoholism and child-abuse that the screenwriters, editors, directors, etc. should be ashamed of such shoddy workmanship. First, we have a battered wife whose husband goes to jail for more than six years during which time we are asked to believe that she never reveals that she is pregnant with his child and then secretly gives him up at birth. We are also asked to believe that she sends the adoption papers by way of a guard, who then allows another inmate to forge the husband's signature on the consent forms. The inmate who stooped to the forgery, by the way, never reveals to his fellow inmate that the wife is giving up the child, or that the child exists. Next, we are given the clearly happy and secure adoptive family which includes an obviously well-to-do father, mother and extremely bright and handsome six-year-old boy, who the Ohio court system immediately, upon hearing of the bizare story than an inmate forged the adoption consent, reverses the adoption and rips the six-year-old child from his safe and secure home. After just two visits with his new mommy and daddy the child is to be finally turned over to the recently released abusive man and his pathetic wife. We are to believe that nothing can be done to stop the insanity of treating a child with such insensitivity; not the lawyers; not the courts; not even a US congressman. And then, for the grand finale, we are given that the abuser loses it with the six-year-old and he returns from his second visit with the new ones to his adoptive parents badly bruised and terrified, at which point they decide to leave the country to protect their child. Simultaneously, the pathetic wife is sporting new bruises received from the loser husband/biological father and an end to the whole thing is achieved that is somewhat palatable. Ohio should be insulted if the film is not an accurate reflection of their lack of logic and/or compassion for children. If Ohio would really allow a travesty such as this to happen, then its citizens should consider moving. The writers might consider a different profession.",1310688000,,2362,4.805896805896806

4334614,4,B004DTLK76,"LIKE DANDELION DUST is a very small scaled film about a very large subject: adoption and the struggles that at times are associated between birth parents and adoptive parents. Adapted from Karen Kingsbury's popular novel by Stephen J Rivele and Michael Lachance and directed with sensitivity and fine pacing by Jon Gunn, the film succeeds primarily because of the exceptional acting on the part of the acting by Mira Sorvino and Barry Pepper.

Blue collar worker Richard 'Rip' Porter (Barry Pepper) is an alcoholic with anger management problems and as the film opens he is arrested for beating his wife Wendy (Mira Sorvino) and imprisoned for seven years. Simultaneously we meet the wealthy  Jack Campbell (Cole Hauser) and his wife Molly (Kate Levering) who are playing with their six year old son Joey (Maxwell Perry Cotton) and interacting with Molly's sister Beth (Abby Brammell) and husband Bill (Kirk B.R. Woller) who are suggesting that Joey, being adopted, should be brought up in the church: there is conflict as Beth seems to feel Molly isn't caring correctly for Joey since he is adopted!

Rip is released form prison and is clean from his alcoholism and anger management problems and Wendy confesses that when Rip was incarcerated she had been pregnant and because of Rip's problems she put her newborn son up for adoption, having her mother sign for Rip.  Rip is shocked with the news and at once wants to get his son back. An adoption agency is consulted in the person of Allyson Bower (L. Scott Caldwell) who is placed between the Porters and the Campbells in making the decision as to where Joey should be.  Because of the forged adoption papers Joey is still the child of the Porters and they fight the Campbells for custody.  Joey is in the middle and with Allyson's guidance tries to adapt to his birth parents on planned visits while the Campbells try every avenue to retain their beloved Joey.  How the game is played includes errors on the parts of both sets of parents but the situation is finally resolved in a very touching manner.

Sorvino and Pepper are brilliant in their roles as the beleaguered Porters.  The reason the film works as well as it does is the fact that the good and bad aspects of human behavior on the part of all the characters in the film is balanced.  It is a realistic look at what appears on the surface to be polar opposite couples - and in the middle is the very finely tuned performance of little Maxwell Perry Cotton.  This is a film that tugs a bit heavily on the heartstrings, but for anyone who has been involved in an adoption problem it will ring true.  Grady Harp, June 11",1309392000,,2633,4.675324675324675

4334617,4,B004DTLK76,"I haven't read the book that this movie was based on, so I can only comment on the movie itself. I thought it was well done. The acting was believable and I loved the message. Parents (both adoptive and biological) would do just about anything for their child. Now, having done a ton of adoptions myself (I was like the social worker in the movie) I felt that the premise was a bit far fetched. Most states would not allow a situation like that to occur, so I can only assume that Ohio law was researched in this case to make such a situation legally plausible. In Arizona, where I live, that scenario wouldn't happen. There are too many laws to prevent such a messed up situation from happening. Now if Joey had been a foster child and not yet adopted, that would be a different situation. Regardless, this movie tugs at the heartstrings and for me the message was good that birth mothers who place their children for adoption are ""loving them enough to let them go"" like the actress in the movie stated toward the end. Having worked with a lot of birth mothers in similar situations I can say that scene was very believable. It's hard, but rewarding to know that the birth mother did the right thing. She may have been with an abusive man, but she was still strong in her own way. She made choices, and her choice was to stay with him. I've seen that happen over and over as well. That said, I appreciated how the movie resolved at the end and how things were handled. And that poor social worker... I felt for her. She had a situation that was very hard to deal with, but she handled it well. I appreciated that, too. Sometimes it's a thankless job to be the one caught in the middle of custody situations. Been there, done that. Overall, this movie was worth seeing,  in my opinion. I really enjoyed it even if it did make me cry as expected. Again, I haven't read the book to compare the two. I don't know how close the novel was to the movie, so I can't comment on that. The spiritual message in the story was weak, but I'm not surprised. On the flip side, it's good to show that people who aren't Christians love their children enough to sacrifice for them, too. And this adoptive couple was willing to give up everything. That showed their heart for their child, even if their way of handling things was misguided. Desperate people aren't rational.",1306627200,,2356,4.4036697247706424

I was expecting a beautiful and entertaining Christian film on the level of ""Facing the Giants"" (An all time favorite of myself and my husband) but, instead, experienced a hollowed out shell of the book I had once savored.

If you get a chance to read the book do it, but save your time and money and don't bother with the movie.  Karen how could you allow this to happen???",1297382400,9,489,3.888888888888889
4334632,4,B004DTLK76,"Great movie unless you read the book first! I feel Karen Kingsbury was not true to her book. The personalities of the adoptive parents were not developed and made to look selfish in the movie, whereas the birth parents were made out to be hero's. Did Karen have second thoughts about how she portrayed both sets of parents in her book? And where was the basis of all of this...God?",1297036800,14,381,4.457142857142857
4334633,1,B004DTLK76,"I am an avid reader of Karen Kingsbury's books and was on the list to get this movie as soon as it came out. I am so disappointed! It was nothing like the book! Kingsbury is known for weaving a tale that is strong in christian values and in showing God's amazing character and the way He works even through the hard times. There was NOTHING in this movie to make it a christian film! There was NOTHING to learn about or show our amazing God. This movie did not draw me in, nor did the acting or the characters. The christian element was missing and therefore the movie was ruined. I was even more disappointed when I saw that Karen Kingsbury helped produce this! She obviously had a choice, and she chose the easy path that will appeal to the masses and make her alot of money, but at what cost?",1296864000,8,795,4.2368421052631575
4334634,5,B004DTLK76,"I was hesitant to rent this movie as I did not want to watch people who gave up a child try to get him back from a good adoptive home after seven years. I am glad that I rented it. The movie was inspirational. It is safe for people who have adopted, trying to adopt, or are thinking of adopting.",1296777600,,295,3.933333333333333
4334635,5,B004DTLK76,"This movie deserves a 5-star rating alone for Mira Sorvino's acting in it, she was so convincing in the role. The acting was good all the way around. I was bawling like a baby at the end of it. I thought it was a very moving, intense film that made you think.
(In reading a lot of the reviews I understand people are upset because they left the Christian theme, which was prominent in the book, out of the movie.  I haven't read the book, but my guess is they did that to reach a wider audience and not alienate anyone. My friend, who is a Christian, watched it also and we talked about that and her view was that as a Christian she understood the goal to reach out to all, not just limit it to her religion.  People can still read the book if they want that experience, but the movie itself I felt deserved a 5.)",1296777600,5,813,4.1069182389937104
