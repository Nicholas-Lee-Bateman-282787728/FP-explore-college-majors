8249983,5,B0013D8L9K,I loved this program when it was on.  Are there any more dvd's out there on this?Sure would love to purchase more.  This series gives people an inside look just as to how hard we ballroom dancers work to make it look so easy.,1310601600,,225,4.090909090909091
8249984,5,B0013D8L9K,"Ballroom Bootcamp was a short-lived reality show on TLC. This DVD collects five episodes of the original series.

As a dancer and dance teacher, I'll say that I love this show. Wish it had gone on for years, but alas that's how these cable series go.

What is it about this series that makes it tick? It's not a dance-instructional video and it's not really a competition reality show, as it may seem to be. It's really a show about normal people facing their own personal challenges and learning something valuable. The show makes me feel good about the world.

If I could say anything about the product specifically, I'd make two wishes:
1) I wish the entire series were available to review.
2) I wish that there were any supplemental material.

It's a pretty bare-bones package. Five episodes, each with three students learning a specific ballroom dance. It appears to be about half the entire series. Still, very much worth watching and re-watching.",1304726400,,953,4.7926829268292686

Very inspirational;it's amazing to see these people's lives improve. Also, Gocha Chertkoev, the main choreographer, is brutal and so entertaining to watch - he makes me laugh, and what an amazing body!!!",1211328000,7,363,5.066666666666666
