He was  at the D-Day landings and simply recounts his experience. Overall his  experiences are not all that exciting or even very interesting or  inciteful. There is some historic footage that is mildly interesting.  Overall this is not a video you will find yourself wanting to watch more  than once or twice.",968025600,,453,4.6

They now have my mistaken donation.",923097600,,258,4.375
7888074,5,6305280444,This was the best depiction of WWII on D-Day. I was not their my self but it made me feel like I was. This is definitly better than those old Black and White movies. I Think that every World War II or World War II  hobbiest's should get this movie!,922060800,,248,3.96
7888075,3,6305280444,"This is a good shot of what WWII was in the ETO for a Brit in a tank outfit, but it has no connection to the story ""Saving Pt. Ryan""which is the story of US soldiers.  The real life ""Pvt  Ryan""was a member of the 506 Para. Inf., 101st Airborne  Div.""signed""- Jim Norene, veteran of 101s A/B Div., 1944.",920764800,,302,4.084745762711864
