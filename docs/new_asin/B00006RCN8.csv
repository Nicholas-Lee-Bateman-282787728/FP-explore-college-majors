1787096,4,B00006RCN8,"I watched this film a few years ago and have never forgotten it. In it, we have two pre-teen sisters who are trying to deal with the mental state of their mother, which is getting worse and worse with each passing day. Their father is an endearing man, although a bit permissive, and does his best to hold the rocky family together.

The film takes a strange turn into what many conclude is our protagonist's (a girl named Angela) own slide into mental illness. I'm not sure that's the case, as I find reason to believe some aspects of her visions might have very well been true, but the point is that she's a tormented soul and finds escapism through a vivid imagination and a self-made quest that frees her mind from what's currently happening. This is a quest for purification from the evil of the world, one that she brings her sister along for the ride, and one that finds a handsome, peaceful Lucifer as their largest obstacle. He simply states to her on numerous times, ""I want you, Angela"" in a very gentle, yet thouroughly dark way.

Eventually, Angela's quest, with her young sister at her side, takes her across the back roads of her town. Her firm belief in her journey makes her the near victim of a crime as well as the viewer of some very bizarre happenings. In the end, Angela decides to face her fears directly.

The end of this film will leave you in awe.",1128556800,34,1373,4.440476190476191
1787097,5,B00006RCN8,"You never know for sure what a film will be like when you order it.  Sometimes you are pleased, sometimes not.  Angela is truly a superior film and it exceeeded my expectations.  The storyline took a sad turn with the mental instability of Angela's mother and how she had to be placed in an institution.  However, I was  more than uplifted by the job done by the girl who played Angela and how she kept seeking God and Heaven.  Miranda Stuart Rhyne's performance was most enchanting.  This is the best movie that I have bought from Amazon to date.  I really felt for Angela as she fought her nightmares and kept on her spiritual journey.  I will watch this movie again and again and that is not something that I do very often.  The young teen actress did a better acting job here than most actors and actresses do that are two or three times her age!  She should have a spectacular film career ahead of her!  I highly recommend this movie!",1104278400,22,939,4.395348837209302
1787098,5,B00006RCN8,"This movie sent chills down my spine even after the twentieth time of seeing it. Excellent architecture, this movie portrays imagination in a light that leaves you a little unsure of the diagnosis. It left me wondering if the magical things that happened to these girls was real or really in their imaginations.
It also allowed me to see a wierd, dark side of childhood again, like what I went through, circumstances that made survival and coping palpable and no longer hidden. I reccommend everyone see this movie at least once. Maybe the things hidden in this movie were unintentional, but there are layers to sort through.",1083715200,29,625,4.850467289719626

After watching this movie, I thought about it a lot and I couldn't seem to understand it. I watched it again and it came clear to me that the girls made up their own fantasy worlds to escape the very depressing or overly happy mood swings of their mother, and they search for a way to heaven and Angela dies when she succeeds. This movie was very interesting, and very well directed.",1055030400,14,629,4.206611570247934

There were so many things going on in this movie--yet--somehow the characters all stood out in their own way at the right time. I was completely impressed with the mood of the movie. One that could have been very depressing, was somehow, magical and so loving. The movie also brought out how children can survive through many things and sometimes...when all they have to reach out to is Heaven....God answers......I loved the ending, which at first look was sad, but then after rethinking for a few seconds, I realized that Angela had found her way......This movie is bold, not afraid to show how life really is without censorship attached, and therefore is refreshing and will be very easy to watch many more times....",1039564800,9,879,4.751633986928105

And what Angela says to the man at the carnival up on the balcony might be a good idea should a child get in a similar position unexpectedly. Otherwise, this movie is not worth the money or time it took for me to force myself to finish watching it. Very poorly filmed also. Keeping the yellow and all the black microphones out of the way of being filmed would be a good idea too. Extremely low budget doesn't have to mean sloppy filming.",1306195200,4,576,4.151785714285714
1787132,5,B00006RCN8,"So many other great reviews so I will keep this short. I agree with all the previous superlatives and accolades. This movie touches just about every human emotion we have. It is almost like a fairy tale adapted to a modern setting. The acting is superb, the music quirky in a good way, and the photography is excellent. Yes, there are some ""sophmore moments"" with boom Mics but overall the strong story and acting more than make up for these very minor mistakes.

What makes this movie so special is the young actress who plays Angela. Miranda Stuart Rhyne is so effortless in her part that I am completely at a loss to explain how she could NOT have been nominated for some sort of award. I have never seen such an ethereal and haunting performance from any other ""child actor"". You look at Dakota Fanning or Jodie Foster and nether of them have the same sort of screen presence that Miranda has. And there is something about her that is almost magical. In various parts of the movie she doesn't even look like the same person. In part this is due to different hairstyles, makeup, clothes etc. but I have never a seen a movie where a single actor's face could look so different from scene to scene. I have never seen anything like this with any other actor/actress...ever. Sadly, her career as an actress pretty much ended after this movie (only a few bit parts and a couple of shorts). Her touching portrayal of a girl coping with the horror of a family ripped apart (n this case by mental illness) will touch a deep and troubled chord in a LOT of people.

If I had to grab just a handful of DVDs for my ""desert island collection"" this one would be included. Truly, a lost treasure.",1292371200,6,1684,4.446601941747573
1787133,4,B00006RCN8,"This is an amazing and haunting look at how two young sisters cope as their family life is torn apart.

The father is unable to deal with his wife's horrific slide into mental illness.  Instead of dealing with the harsh reality of things they cannot even begin to understand, the little girls retreat into their own world.  The magical quality of this is tinged with the sadness of knowing why it exists.  The imagery is astounding.

This film is more a character study and a slow paced homage to childhood.  It is a visually haunting tale of the girls and their need to make sense of what is going on around them.  I would recommend watching this movie when in a reflective mood.",1255651200,4,680,4.479674796747967
1787134,5,B00006RCN8,"Deep, dark, and mysterious, Angela is a movie that is definitely off the beaten path. I remember finding out about this movie in the year 2000 and looking forward to renting a copy only to find out that the movie was yet to be released.

The original movie was released in 1995; this DVD wasn't out until 2002. Both releases received minimal publicity. Specials for the DVD include audio commentary from Rebecca Miller and a crew biographies.

today he would have made this film. I am not surprised it won awards.
Great acting, great writing, great directing. Excellent photography
and art direction. A modern tragedy, you get so involved with the actors you rarely notice the boom mic which occasionally dips into the top of the frame. Still much better then many Hollywood movies. Who can forget that gun which was left behind the drapes on the set of Three Men and A Baby. The merits of this film will be debated for a long time.",1244937600,3,557,4.58
1787155,4,B00006RCN8,"This movie, I think, is well done.  If you like the artistic form of the young female body, you will love this movie.  The scenes of the little girls were done very tastefully.  I have always enjoyed viewing the female body in its purest form.  It is a beautiful creation that many people, especially men, take for granted.  There is nothing sexual or arousing about any of the scenes and they are done in the most prestigious of settings.  Very well constructed.

The plot is a great one.  The only problem I had with this movie is when the girls were in ""the big nothing,""  the story started to bcome like choppy sentences.  The scenes changed to quickly and Angela was getting too many signs.  I think that this part was a little overdone.  The ending, although very dramatic and appropriate for the movie, could have been laid out better.  It left me with a sense of incompleteness.  Other than that, the movie was excellent and a masterpiece in my eyes.  Well done!",1209254400,11,970,4.526011560693641
1787156,5,B00006RCN8,"once again. the movie is  a little roughly crafted. There are a few scenes in which you can see the boom mike. or equipment. but the story, the acting and most of the photography is superb. The story reaches deep into the mind and the sweet-and-sour realism is the climax of art. The child actors, specially miranda stawrt rhine are in a word, sublime. there are some brief scenes of nudity so a little parental guidance. They are inocent and natural so no obsenity or adult situations are present. (that I can remember) the scenes are a family swimming in a river and are all conveyed very inocently and freshly, evoking the sense of being a child and with your family. Exelent movie.",1204156800,4,685,4.569105691056911
1787157,3,B00006RCN8,"""Angela"" was not your average film. It was a strong opening from Rebecca Miller, the spawn of playwright Arthur Miller and film vixen Marilyn Monroe, but where it suffered was that it felt too amateurish. Without biting my tongue ""Angela"" began impressively, strong opening with a family's move to a new home. The defined mother/father characters (albeit eerily similar references to Marilyn Monroe), two strong girl leads that seem to have genuine chemistry together, and an undefined era which allowed my imagination to flourish and ponder ignited ""Angela"" immediately. It was when the film moved into its second and third act, where it became alarmingly obvious that Miller was loosing her grasp on not just the film crew, but also the convoluted story itself. Visions of Lucifer, the Virgin Mary, a diluted neighbor, and the big elephant in the room - religion - seem to take priority over such important elements like character development, questionable motive, and family dynamics. Miller places so much focus on these symbolic references that this quality film begins to slip through her fingers. By the second act, where the two daughters embark on their own journey through this unknown town, which again is bombarded with referenced evils and unknown symbolism, that reality gets surpassed by a director who would rather shock than impress. The entire scene with the possible pedophile could have been an intense and memorable scene, but instead it falls short, because Miller is so focused on getting us to Lucifer that we only recognize this scene as a small blip on the radar. Again, I don't want to sound pessimistic about this film, Miller began with such a strong eye that I thought this was going to be an instant classic, but by the dull ending, ""Angela"" is so muddled that empathy towards the characters becomes greater than excitement for the film.

While our characters constantly have to play second fiddle to the symbolic religious references throughout the film, I must admit that they were eerie and interesting throughout bits and segments. Miller had a strong cast, a father who gave up everything for his family, a mother lost in her head (especially well played), and two daughters searching for meaning was an amazing dynamic - poorly defined - but amazing all the same. What I had hoped Miller would do was make these four characters the central focus of the story, but alas, it doesn't happen. The struggle between father/mother again are second to the religious symbolism, thus we lack the apparent emotion towards them. When all of these characters get to their final moments, we just don't care any further. We have given up. A scene was needed where the family reunites over a crisis that nearly tore them apart - clich? - I believe it would have strengthened the characters and transformed this film from a simply symbolic picture into a family drama. While ""Angela"" was the obvious lead character, all of these in the immediate family were worthy (and powerful) enough to watch equally. They all carried their weight well, one just wishes we could have spent more time with them.

Finally, an issue needs to be addressed with this film that was neither mentioned in the audio commentary nor in many posts about this film, but when a director cannot clean up or recognize that a boom mic has made it into at least five scenes (extremely apparent) than something is wrong. One cannot say that this film is superb with technical failures happening all over the place. This is your blood and soul when you create a film; why not present it like it was a wrapped Christmas gift, not like it was just found in the sandbox? That small issue really lowered the standard for this film, making it just another amateurish independent film created by someone who carries a famous last name.

Overall, I wanted to like ""Angela"", I wanted to sit here and say that I was impressed with Miller's first outing, but alas, I wasn't. It was such a powerful opening, but it floundered so quickly. Miller's focus on the religious element, while defining for Angela, deeply ruined the rest of the characters. The family became a shadow, with no real emotion surrounding them, but instead reacting to the beliefs of Angela. I was drawn into Angela's mother's story, but received no gratification or explanation. I loved her father's desire to be a good dad, but again, sitting in a circle or becoming baptized was more important. I was misled by the goals, and consequently missed the ""why"" and ""how"" for the final act. Coupled with the laughable errors by the crew (this should have been an introduction to the first day of using a boom mic), ""Angela"" just fell through the cracks. It perhaps was the obvious borrow from ""Gummo"" or just the drowning of symbolism, but ""Angela"" will remain - for me - another independent film trying to make its mark. I am eager to see ""Personal Velocity"" if only to observe if Miller successfully saw the errors and made the corrections. ""Angela"" was a first draft film, with much needed corrections and red markings in the margins.

Grade: ** out of *****",1199923200,10,5104,4.843069873997709
1787158,5,B00006RCN8,"There are two issues in this movie.  The first is of a couple of little girls growing up with a mentally ill mother.  Angela, in her immaturity, feels at least a bit responsible for her mother's situation.  She wants to be especially good, feeling that it is her 'badness' that keeps her mother sick.  This is very common.  One girl our family has grown to love as one of our own daughters understood that it was after her mother got pregnant with her the schizophrenia manifested itself in her mother.  So, when she was little, she felt she caused it to happen.

Angela has some idea of God and satan, Heaven and hell, but it is as a ten-year-old might have understood it.  It would have been nice to see where she had gotten such ideas.  Still, Angela wants very much to be a good person, and keep her little sister, Ellie, good.  However, she is still a little girl.  Parents could show this film to their own children, watching together, and use it to discuss the family beliefs regarding these topics.  It is a movie one won't soon forget, and one that will leave you thinking about it for some time after seeing it.

This is a very intense movie (and there is one rather explicit sex scene).  Still, my nine-year-old granddaughter handled it very well (we fast-forwarded through the short sex scene).  I presented the story to her as one example of what might cause some kids to act in ways that her 'in group' does not think is 'cool.'  We had a good discussion about how she should treat such kids because the ones she may meet might be going through the same type of thing, though the specifics may be different, as Angela in their home.  If a parent knows their child is dealing with such a friend, this movie would be a great way to help them open up about how they feel about the 'strange' kid, and for parents to teach understanding and even compassion for him or her.  This is a very penetrating movie.",1199232000,4,1916,4.410256410256411
1787159,5,B00006RCN8,"This is a provocative and rare example of when American goth art combines with American cinematic genius. Fans of David Hamilton may especially apperciate the artistic visuals of the young star, Angela, and her younger sister.
This film requires an open mind and one who apperciates all colors of art from darkness to light.
It brings you through the very real private journeys and experences of a young girl becoming a young woman. As with most girls at the character's age, Angela becomes isolated from her family and friends in order to find the answers to her inner questions on her own.
Many of the scenes are somber and distubring but beautiful.
The plot, in short, is about a eleven or twelve year old girl named Angela living with her sister and Mother in rural America.  Throughout the film, she is engrossed in her own journey to discover how she might gurantee her place in Heaven someday. The more she searches the more obsessed this quest becomes.  She soon finds herself in a world of angels and demons fighting for her soul.
Meanwhile, her Mothers becomes mentally ill. This too becomes a part of Angela's quest for understanding and finding her salvation. All the while, her young sister, five or so, stays timidly at her side, quietly attempting to make sense of her family's challenges and sister's fasination with another world.
The film invites you into the dark place that exists in every young woman's search for idenity and place.",1197504000,6,1453,4.808
1787160,3,B00006RCN8,"Released in '95 `Angela' plays like a lazy, dreamy summer's day lying around the house watching the curtains sway in the gentle breeze and scattered rays of sunlight dance around the room. You know what I mean, one of those days when dreams and fantasies weave their way into the waking world making every moment magical and filled with possibility.

Angela lives in such a world of her own making as she desperately attempts to escape the reality of living with a chronically depressed Mother and a family dissolving before her adolescent eyes. Seeing no other avenues to consider she looks for a way to solve her problems through a divine intervention.

In her intensely hypnogogic world nothing is what it seems to be. Lucifer lives in the basement of the family house, the Virgin Mary lurks outside the bedroom window and the elderly woman next door who walks constantly back and forth to her mail box looking for a letter that never comes is an angel.

This is a film filled with southern, backwoods atmosphere and understated meaning that does a superb job at blurring the boundary lines between, the real and the imagined, the sacred and the mudane. Definitely not for everyone but if you occasionally enjoy a little something off the beaten path you might want to give `Angela' a try. It's something that will either win you over or put you to sleep.

particular, is engaging as the young protagonist caught in a heavenly

struggle between good and evil to save her mentally ill mother. She

convincingly portrays Angela as a determined and feisty but naive and

vulnerable child in equal measure; someone who is headstrong but literally

1787163,5,B00006RCN8,"I enjoy discovering obscure, little known films that turn out to be little gems and hidden teasures of cinematic art. You almost have to find these films by accident to be aware of them. WALKABOUT is one. PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK is another. ANGELA can be added to the list of these pleasant surprises.

I think it would be very difficult to verbally describe what this film is about in such a way to prepare a prospective viewer as to what to expect. I read the reviews and customer comments and must admit the film was completely different than my preconceived notions had led me to believe. The only thing I could say is it is about two little girls and how the depression and mental illness of their mother influence and affect their view of the world in which they live.

Usually I prefer crisp, brightly and clearly filmed movies. This one has a murky, grainy quality to it that I would usually abhor. However I realized after viewing it that this murky graininess contributed significantly to the mood and atmosphere of the film. The music that was chosen also contributed to this atmosphere.

One who is offended by child nudity should probably avoid ANGELA, as the filmmaker obviously had no qualms about showing both girls (10 and 6) in more than a few scenes in sundry stages of nakedness. Nevertheless, these scenes (casual, spontaneous),just as the graininess and music, also contributed to forming the interesting atmosphere of the film. It would have suffered if any of these mood-setting devices had been omitted.

7972372,2,B00006RCN8,"this movie seems to get a lot of praise but not from me. I found it slow going, hard to follow (the generally low volume dialogue didn't help), and not very interesting. The two girls playing sisters, particularly the younger one, were the best part of ""Angela""- too bad their careers haven't come to much.
I found the picture quality and color to be good, the sound level much too low (singing or loud voices OK, general conversation very hard to hear. No closed captioning or subtitling)  4:3 aspect ratio, not 16:9 widescreen. It has ""extras"", (bios of some people other than the girls and not much else), that aren't worth your time.
If the idea of nudity offends you I doubt there's 2 minutes out of 99 with any of it. Most of what you see of the girls will be a few seconds flash of bare chest with only one, seconds long, full frontal view (of the younger girl, both girls briefly seen at a great distance). That's in the first half of the movieno nudity in the second half.
I felt like the movie just ran on and onand onand on.
