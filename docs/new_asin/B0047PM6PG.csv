Life in Perpetual Beta shows that one person can live their passion. Melissa Pierce not only walks the walk, but lives it through this film.",1325894400,,362,4.402985074626866
8418283,5,B0047PM6PG,"This is a film that really cuts through all of the excuses and crap that we make about why we can't create a living doing what we love. LiPB has a great roster of creative talent who have taken the risk and continue to build their lives by focusing on the moment - no 5 year plans, but what works and what makes them happy today. I love that the point gets across, loud and clear, that ""It's not easy"" and takes hard and focused work. But anything of quality does and it's always worth so much more in the end.

Standouts for me (among many other moments): Liz Danzico, Jim Coudal, Jeffrey Zeldman, Loren Feldman and Carlos Segura.

Funny and inspiring movie - you'll find moments stay with you and keep popping up when you need them to. Great work by first-time filmmaker, Melissa Pierce.",1288656000,2,789,4.397260273972603
