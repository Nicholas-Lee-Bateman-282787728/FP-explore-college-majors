7847434,5,6303447260,"Probably the best and sweetest Ranma 1/2 story line. For all you R&A fans, this is a MUST HAVE. When Akane goes on a trip to find a forgotten memory, what she finds is a forgetful boy who once risked his life to save hers. When Ranma comes along to look for her, what madness will happen? If you've never seen Ranma jelous, this is a real eye opener!! (""Yeah? Well, I know something you don't know! Akane is my fiancee! No one's gonna take her from me!"") Will Akane give up Ranma's love to compensate the one of a dying boy who once saved her life? Will Ranma give up on Akane without a fight? Will Ranma and Akane make up, once again? THe answers are in the video!",1071532800,,665,4.123076923076923
7847435,5,6303447260,"Ok, starting off... if you do not buy this video you are CRAZY!!!  One word to describe this... beautiful!!! I laughed, i cried(nearly), i loved it!  If you love the Ranma and Akane romance thing (which i happen to), then most likely you'll love this.  There's not much of hiding feelings in this and it's very humerous too (gotta love the grandpa).  For any Ryoga fans, I personally thought he was pretty cool too; very funny and sweet. Okay the short description is: Akane remembers a boy who saved her from monsters when she was lost in the mountains as a child.  She returns the mountains alone to find that he is slowly dying.  In return for saving her life, she vows to save his.  Of course, our Ranma goes after her and is VERY surprised to see that she seems to hold affection for this guy.  We have a scene of fighting for Akane, and at one point Ryoga enters the scene as he must have gotton REALLY lost.  It's a mission to save the boy of the mountains and win Akane's love!  Watch to see the outcome.  Not kidding when this is rated a 5 star. Deffinately worth the money.",970099200,2,1083,4.311881188118812
7847436,5,6303447260,Did my ears decieve me or did Akane proudly call Ranma her fiance? Or will Akane leave Ranma for the man without a memory? What is the water of life? Why are there giant stupid looking animals all over the place? Are the  dreams that Akane keeps seeing realy memories trying to resurface? All of  these questions will be answered in this video. My favorite part is the  second half when Ranma and Akane almost or kinda (depends on how you look  at it)acknoledge their real feeling for each other. Definetly the best in  the OAV series.,949795200,,535,4.474226804123711
7847437,5,6303447260,"This oav is one of the best, it was also one that the fans in Japan demaneded to see animated. Ranma and Akane have always denied their feelings about each other. Now Akane has always had men flinging themselves  at her, but she has never taken any of them seriously. But in the Oav  someone from Akane's past returns and makes Akane realize whom she loves.  Akane sees a televison advertisement about a strange forest called  Rowgonzawa. Akane then has a flashback about her childhood which is  connected to the strange forest. Akane packs her bags and goes off to the  forest in search of someone she can't stop remembering. Ranma of course  jumps to the chance to go off and find his stupid fiance. Akane is rescued  from a giant animal from a strange boy named Shinosuke. Akane stays with  Shinosuke and his grandfather for a few days. After a little detective work  she realizes Shinosuke is the same boy from her past. It turns out that  Akane owes Shinosuke her life and now poor Shinosuke is dying. Akane vowes  to stay and save Shinosuke's life. Shinosuke needs a special water in order  to live, and now Shinosuke, his grandfather and Akane go off to get the  water of life. Things get interesting when Ranma shows up and he challenges  Shinosuke to leave Akane alone. Ranma belives that he has lost Akane and  that she has made her choice. The second half of the tape is the big  conclusion to the problems. Now all we needed for a great Ranma episode is  Ryouga, a monster and cross dressing boys and a wacky old man(mission  acomplished). The greatest moment in this anime is seeing Akane get tough  and risk her life to save Ranma. We get to hear Akane pronounce proudly  that she has to go save her finace. It shocked me to hear her finally admit  without disgust that  she is going to marry Ranma. This oav can stand on  its own but it does help to know a little of the characters and how  everyone is engadged and who turns into what. This vidoe is one of the best  Ranma episodes and is a great add to anyone's collection.",947548800,11,2040,4.431266846361186
