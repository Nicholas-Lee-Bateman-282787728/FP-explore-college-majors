8469381,4,B005EZJ3EK,"My kids love it. I've got a nearly three-year old who wants to watch it whenever we let him watch a movie. It's not all that often, so maybe this would be different if your kids watch a lot of TV, but the disc keeps his attention the entire time.

I don't know if it's the voice of the cat, or the animation style, but I don't enjoy it. Not in the sense that it is a kids show, but in the sense that something actively bugs me about it. Oh well, they're not teaching my kids anything bad and they love it, so I'm not complaining!",1460332800,,529,3.94392523364486
