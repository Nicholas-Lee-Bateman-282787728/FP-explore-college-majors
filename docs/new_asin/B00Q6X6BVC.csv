6859228,5,B00Q6X6BVC,"Best movie that I have ever seen!  The book is better, of course; but the movie follows it closely right down to 3 movies for the 3 parts of the book.",1480636800,,150,3.838709677419355
6859229,2,B00Q6X6BVC,"At the moment today, on Black Friday (fitting, really), it's a good deal on a film that does everything in its artistic power to deserve it's dismal 4% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The sequels don't get much better, and that's without regarding the politics themselves; you could even say it's ""objectively"" bad.",1480032000,,310,4.980769230769231
6859230,5,B00Q6X6BVC,"Difficult picture, captures the essence of the book.",1477526400,2,52,5.625

6859232,3,B00Q6X6BVC,Good Movie but the packaging said digital copy but was only for 1.,1475107200,3,66,4.153846153846154
6859233,3,B00Q6X6BVC,What a bizarre production of a great book.  What were they thinking?  Three sets of principal actors?  Fortunately they were able to keep the story flow somewhat.  Sad sad.,1466035200,2,172,4.827586206896552
6859234,4,B00Q6X6BVC,As is typical with movies made from books the book was much better but the movie just couldn't fit in all the details of the book.  Still good to have though and it was delivered ahead of schedule.,1457481600,,197,4.184210526315789
6859235,3,B00Q6X6BVC,"Movies are good and closely represent what was in the book. To anyone considering buying this and hoping to get the Digital HD copy as the cover implies, you only get Part III on UV. Called 2oth Century Fox and the rep said that is all you get with the Trilogy. The Trilogy that is on VUDU must be bought separately.",1438732800,9,316,4.19672131147541
8690601,3,B00Q6X6BVC,"Okay adaptation of the story.  They cut out some parts I thought was important,  and changed a bit of the main story.

The big frustration is that the actors change every movie..... it makes the story really hard to follow when Dagny and everyone's face changed 3 times....",1525478400,,273,4.645833333333333
8690602,3,B00Q6X6BVC,"I have read the book, and w/ a movie of this type, was glad I did. The movie assumes too much and is too ""matter-of-fact"".",1523318400,,122,3.92
8690603,1,B00Q6X6BVC,Garbage that the trilogy only comes with a digital copy of part III. False/misleading advertising.,1522022400,,98,5.6
8690604,5,B00Q6X6BVC,Love this movie trilogy! Best way to get them is in this trilogy set.,1515888000,,69,4.0
8690605,5,B00Q6X6BVC,"Love the story, wish the actors would have remained across each part so it was easier to follow, but this is not a reflection
 of the vendor, but the production company instead.",1504396800,,177,4.53125
8690606,5,B00Q6X6BVC,The DVD's were what you'd expect.,1484870400,,33,4.666666666666667
8690607,5,B00Q6X6BVC,"Worked perfectly, enjoyed all three movies, liked ease of buying all three together",1484611200,,83,5.461538461538462
8690608,1,B00Q6X6BVC,"Was expecting to have the digital of all the movies, or I would have purchased DVD copies.
Very annoyed.",1483747200,3,104,4.526315789473684
8690609,1,B00Q6X6BVC,False advertising. It says Digital HD on the package but you only get a digital copy of 1 of the 3 movies (and it's the third one so you are out of luck starting the trilogy) !! That's straight false advertising.,1482710400,2,212,4.195121951219512
