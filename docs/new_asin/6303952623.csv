745231,4,6303952623,"Some of the TV shows from the '60s and '70s don't stand the test of time.  This show comes across fresh and not dated.  Our two lovable rogues are trying to earn amnesty by ""going straight for a year.""  This proves quite challenging and many interesting predicaments occur. Most of the scripts are inventive and fun. More light hearted than the ""Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid"" movie, which inspired the series. There's a fair bit of action but the violence is toned down. The best part of the show is the on screen chemistry between the two stars, Pete Duel and Ben Murphy (though off the set they were not close friends).  I took off one star because..
A. The picture quality is decent, but not great.  Certainly better than VHS.
B. There are no chapters or scene selections per episode. Feels like it was knocked out quickly and cheaply.
C. There are no commentaries or extras apart from a disc in an envelope inserted in the box which is a short series of reminiscences by Ben Murphy and Roger Davis sitting together and chatting. Davis had known Pete Duel for longer, was closer to him and actually narrates the opening of the show. He appeared in one episode as a sort of hybrid of the two characters. After the untimely death of Pete Duel, he was hurriedly made the replacement. However, the show never was quite the same and finished at the end of that year.  Not much is said about Pete Duel, a very talented but troubled young actor who apparently shot himself due to depression. More about this including interviews with Murphy and Davis when younger, along with family and crew members is available on YouTube by searching for ""Pete Duel documentary."" EMysteries, have a nice 21 minute documentary. Too bad this was not included and the other deficits addressed. Then it would have truly been a Collectors Version.  Nevertheless all the episodes are here and are very enjoyable.",1437350400,2,1894,4.66966966966967
745232,4,6303952623,"EXCELLENT package for western fans. Although the film quality of these reproductions is a bit dubious at times (some negatives look to have color distortions -- could it actually be disc printing problems?) -- but this is the entire series, from beginning to end. No doubt that Ben Murphy and Pete Duel managed for a time to keep the western alive on television in a fun and entertaining way until Duels unfortunate death. Season 2 content is especially entertaining in that Duel's comedy chops and timing become apparent, as he often develops and natural on-screen ease that plays well against the show's array of co-stars, as well as Murphy as his slow-burn counterpart. Brief third season content is unique for the darker, harder-edged Italian film quality the show assumes with the arrival of Roger Davis. Final Disc of this set offers an EXCELLENT new interview with Murphy and Davis who offer not only some rich insight in the series, but display what seems to be a warm and personal relationship that developed years after the show ended. A terrific, often overlooked American series that, for a time, shined brightly.",1435536000,4,1125,4.957671957671957

745234,5,6303952623,"Pete Duel and Ben Murphy are outstanding as outlaws Hannibal Heyes and Kid Curry.  The episodes often surprise by avoiding cliches and presenting people more realistically than a lot of TV shows did in that era.  Our heroes want amnesty because they are tired of running from the law and figure that the authorities are getting smarter and technology to prevent theft is getting more difficult to overcome.  But when they get a chance to make some big money, they decide they'll retire to South America because that's easier than waiting out the trial period for their amnesty.  They are very likable characters and easy to root for.  They aren't bad guys, but they aren't one-dimensional do-gooders either.  Roger Davis, an actor I like a lot, wasn't a good choice to replace Pete Duel because he wasn't even the same ""type"" as Pete.  I wouldn't have liked anyone replacing Pete, unless it had been Geoffrey Deuel, his younger brother.  It's haunting to watch the many times Pete's character smiles, even when a smile seems counterintuitive, knowing that he committed suicide near the end of the 2nd season.",1434931200,,1108,4.887700534759358

has a bonus dvd with interviews with both Murphy and Davis. Some parts are dark and grainy but still good enough since this show is
so good and the one of the best TV shows ever made and the best western ever made. Now of course as a fan since I was 8 years old
I was devastated when Pete Duel killed himself but Roger Davis the voice on the original opening and starred in the original version
TV movie The Young Country with Duel which you can watch on youtube. Why was it not included here is a crime! I actually think some
of the episodes with Roger Davis are better than some of the ones with Duel but the chemistry between the Murphy and Duel was great.
They should have made Davis the cousin and not just take Duel's place as Hannibal Heyes. I did notice in the last few episodes they
used the same footage of them riding in the desert over and over again like it's just one long episode if you watch them back to back.
The brought back the character Clementine played by Sally Fields and introduced another female character which wasn't quite as good.
She only lasted three episodes. But the show was brilliantly written acted and directed and now just another shoot'em up western. It had
great plots and twist and humor as well as action which Hollyweird could never make a show like this today! I watch this once a month
and never get tired of them. It's too bad the series wasn't given another season like most classic shows people still watch today!",1373760000,5,1600,4.318936877076412

I was intrigued by the movie and noticed a few differences in the characterizations of the main duo.  Ben Murphy,(Kid Curry aka Thadeus Jones) had an almost southern accent, and Pete Duel, (Hannibal Heyes, Joshua Smith) seemed a little too jovial to be the smooth talker.  Other than these differences they portrayed the same characters I came to know and love during the short-lived series.

This video reminds me how much Sheriff Lom Trevor didn't want to help the two in the beginning, to later become so delligent on their behalf.

745645,5,6303952623,"There is a tv show that is in my brain, ""Alais Smith and Jones"" (1971-73).  I did not get to watch it much, but when I did I always enjoyed it.  I enjoyed the buddy friendship between Jones and Smith.  Of course I was too young to understand the seriousness of the stories in the West.  I thought that was how people lived somewhere else and here I lived in a brick house with a green lawn.

  Ben Murphy is Thaddeus Jones/Jed ""Kid"" Curry.  Peter Duel is Joshua Smith/Hannibal Hayes.

  The tragic news of peter Duel is probably the first news report I remember.  It scared me for a reason.  When Peter Duel died, I thought it was just the character on tv and the footage on the news shook me up.  In later episodes of Alais Smith and Jones, I kept waiting for Peter Duel to return, but of course now I know why.

  Peter Duel was an actor on the rise.  The tv show was a hit.  However, Peter Duel was suffering depression and had a serious alcohol problem.  He committed suicide with a gun on New Years Eve, December 31, 1971.

  In 1972, they found a replacement by hiring Roger Davis. The series continued until 1973.

  This video is the tv-movie that started it all.  it starts with a cute story of how, in the west, it is getting harder for Smith and Jones to crack a safe.  Things are improving in security.  They try to dynamite a safe, but that foils.  Then Alias (Peter Duel) tries to crack the code of the safe.  He is a pro at it, well until now.  Then they steal the safe and jump it off a cliff.  It fell all right, but it didn't open.

  Will these bad guys ever turn good for amnesty?  Jeanette Nolan tries to help them.

7857590,5,6303952623,There are three generations in this household who have watched these DVDs. We all enjoy this entertaining series and it's nice to be able to watch something that is not verbally or optically offensive. I am grateful that some of these old shows are available on DVD. I really like having all of the DVDs in one case. It makes it easier to store and easier to pick up watching where we left off.,1452556800,,394,4.337837837837838
7857591,3,6303952623,My only issue is the digital quality. There's a distinct distortion during playback. I'm the only one so far to have noticed it but inthe 4th episode in the interior train sequences its especially noticable. Other than that we're very satisfied.,1448496000,,245,5.0

7857593,5,6303952623,"I have loved this show for as long as I can remember. It is equally hilarious and serious, keeping mostly true to the times. While Hannibal Heyes was a completely made up character, Kid Curry actually did exist, just not as portrayed by Ben Murphy. The real Kid Curry took his name from an associate and was a cold blooded killer. This Kid Curry is his real name and is not a killer. I much prefer this Kid Curry. For me, Pete Duel will always be the one and only Hannibal Heyes, which makes watching the last 17 episodes rather difficult at times since it was Roger Davis taking over the role for those final episodes. I am not happy about the choice they made for the cover of this, it should be Ben Murphy and Pete Duel on the cover, not Roger Davis. I have nothing against Davis, but he was only in the last 17 episodes, therefore, the rightful Heyes for the cover should have been Duel. That's just my take on it. Regardless, I have watched every episode a few times already, and I just can't seem to get enough. I am elated they finally put the whole series on DVD, this is my best purchase yet!",1445385600,,1101,4.247619047619048
