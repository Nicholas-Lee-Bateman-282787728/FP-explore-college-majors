8631271,3,B00H9RUL2E,"The 2013 Estes is pleasant viewing. I own Estes 2010 and 2011, and 2013 has a better selection of bands, in particular Band of America's Few, Scottish Power Pipe Band and the Williamsburg Fifes and Drums. Early in the video there are problems with the lighting and sound, but these problems are resolved after a few minutes. This video is for the tattoo ""junkie"" like me. If you are new to tattoos, then seek out a tattoo from Edinburgh, Nova Scotia or Quebec City. These venues offer much greater variety and professionalism of performers.",1426377600,,540,4.75531914893617
