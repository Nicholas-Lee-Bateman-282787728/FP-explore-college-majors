Other than that, this JDrama was very heartwarming and a blast to watch!",1516233600,,218,4.190476190476191
8269721,5,B0018G6702,"This short series is perhaps more inconclusive than what I usually like, but I recommend it very highly because of the fantastic performances of all three young leads, who really touch your heart, and the almost always thoughtful and quirky script. The series also has an evocative atmosphere, though it is mostly of cityscapes and industrial school buildings -- you are left afterwards with a strong and somewhat melancholy sense of place. With its focus on friendship, the story asks what draws people into loyal and honest relationships. There are some false steps, but the injection of a few unexpected supernatural elements and a smidgen of bitter realism actually gives the film part of its charm. This is not your usual makeover/Cinderella story, even if it starts out looking that way.",1349481600,2,793,5.061068702290076
8269722,5,B0018G6702,"If you love Japanese dramas this is a quintessential high school drama. For many people high school is a time when you really think about and discover the type of person you want to be. when Shuji (Kamenashi Kazuya) Akira(Yamapi) and Nobuko(Horikita Maki) come together to Produce Nobuta, they think they do it to help a recluse of a girl become popular. instead, they discover along the way that what truly matters is being there for each other and having friends who are truly willing to help you grow but also accept you flaws and all. heartwarming and sweet the trio work wonderfully together. I truly recommend it.",1344124800,,619,4.7407407407407405
8269723,4,B0018G6702,"This doesn't usually happen very often. As I watch the series unravel with plot developments and character changes, I could understand the popularity of the show. What suprised me was how I started to replay these scenes in my head. Things made more sense afterwards. Memories of the characters laughter and heartbreak play out with even more effect.

  Kudos, once again to Maki Horikita ( I adore her!! ) I hope her career gets bigger and bigger. Maybe, she might want to go back to horror movies. Good screamer!! Highly recommended.",1246406400,5,535,4.857142857142857
