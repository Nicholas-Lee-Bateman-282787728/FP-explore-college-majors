My two peeves are the not so great camera position (at one end of a tall track) leaving you squinting to see action at other end and heats aren't in order, kinda jumps around.",1223769600,,352,4.515625

First, problem with the way of the disk is being produced.  The disc simply won't run in one of my recent DVD players.  This indicates the disc is probably burned from a PC drive rather than a commerical disc copier.  Even the case's logo indicates that it is in DVD-R format.  Not to mention the crappy in-disc menu.

2nd, something's wrong with the disc format.  It seems to run in PAL rather than NTSC, at least during the copyright screen. Not sure if this is an issue or not with the actual video as I don't care much due to my next point.

3rd and most significant. The video shot is simply horrible. Pretty much the whole video is fixed at one angle.  The camera guy was probably sitting somewhere in the middle of the crowd.  He tried to do so much close-up shots from one side to the other and the result is that you'll feel dizzy after a while.  And if that's not worst enough, the view was constantly blocked by a bald guy at the bottom of the screen.  It distracted the action very much.

This production may be acceptable if this is a home-grown project dedicated to a club.  But it is a total rip-off to sell it at Amazon for full retailed price.  Actually I am very surprised that Amazon will carry such crappy DVD product.

If you are interested in demo derby, try Gods of Destruction Demo Derby as it is way better than this dvd.

Don't be fooled by its 2008 release or so called 5.1 or special wide screen format.  This DVD is simply an inferior product that should not exist at Amazon at all.",1219881600,,1588,4.268456375838926
