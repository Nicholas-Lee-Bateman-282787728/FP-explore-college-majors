5058881,5,B0077176AM,"As someone who had been eagerly awaiting the availability of this film, my mind is boggled at how it came out with so little fanfare.  Those interested in truth owe debts of thanks to the makers of this film, as well as others like Dmitri Cavalli,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rabbi-David-Dalin/dp/0895260344/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rabbi David Dalin</a>, and Gary Krupp....

About two and a half years ago, the following appeared in an Israeli news publication:
* ""Some things never go away....the wartime pope, who is now a step closer to beatification, has been accused of keeping silent during the Holocaust, of doing little or nothing to help the Jews, and even of collaborating with the Nazis. To what extent, if any, does the evidence back up these allegations, which have been repeated since the early 1960s?....
* ""On behalf of Pope Pius XI, Cardinal Pacelli [the future Pope Pius XII] drafted an encyclical, entitled 'Mit brennender Sorge' ('With Burning Anxiety'), that condemned Nazi doctrines and persecution of the Catholic Church. The encyclical was smuggled into Germany and read from Catholic pulpits on March 21, 1937. Although many Vatican critics today dismiss the encyclical as a light slap on the wrist, the Germans saw it as a security threat....Both Great Britain and France should have interpreted the document as a warning that they should not trust Adolf Hitler or try to appease him....
* ""Unlike many of the pope's latter-day detractors, the Nazis understood him very well. After studying Pius XII's 1942 Christmas message, the Reich Central Security Office concluded: 'In a manner never known before the pope has repudiated the National Socialist New European Order ... Here he is virtually accusing the German people of injustice toward the Jews and makes himself the mouthpiece of the Jewish war criminals.' (Pick up any book that criticizes Pius XII, and you won't find any mention of this important report.)
* ""In early 1940, the pope acted as an intermediary between a group of German generals who wanted to overthrow Hitler and the British government. Although the conspiracy never went forward, Pius XII kept in close contact with the German resistance and heard about two other plots against Hitler....
* ""Throughout the war, the pope's deputies frequently ordered the Vatican's diplomatic representatives in many Nazi-occupied and Axis countries to intervene on behalf of endangered Jews. Up until Pius XII's death in 1958, many Jewish organizations, newspapers and leaders lauded his efforts....
* ""The campaign against Pope Pius XII is doomed to failure because his detractors cannot sustain their main charges against him - that he was silent, pro-Nazi, and did little or nothing to help the Jews - with evidence. Perhaps only in a backward world such as ours would the one man who did more than any other wartime leader to help Jews and other Nazi victims, receive the greatest condemnation"" (Dmitri Cavalli, Haaretz.com, 1/22/10).

I found observations from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rabbi-Dalin/dp/0895260344/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rabbi Dalin</a>&nbsp;to be particularly telling: ""The anti-papal polemics of ex-seminarians like Garry Wills and John Corwell (author of Hitler's Pope), of ex-priests like James Carroll, and of other lapsed or angry liberal Catholics exploit the tragedy of the Jewish people during the Holocaust to foster their own political agenda of forcing change on the Catholic Church today"" (pp. 2,3).

""At home here on Long Island, he is Gary L. Krupp, medical equipment dealer, now retired....With no previous training or special interest in history, he has emerged as the Vatican's most outspoken Jewish ally in a heated debate at the crux of tensions between Roman Catholic and Jewish leaders and historians: whether Pope Pius XII, the pontiff during World War II, did as much as he could have to save Jews from the Holocaust. Mr. Krupp, 62, has raised enough money through the Pave the Way Foundation, a nonprofit organization he founded in 2002, to travel the globe, hire researchers to scour historic documents, sponsor a three-day symposium in Rome and publish four editions of a glossy, illustrated volume of evidence supporting his view that Pius XII spared no effort to save the lives of persecuted Jews....'I wrote 10 books about Pius XII, but in all these years I never knew how to shake things up for the cause like this wonderful man, Mr. Krupp,' said Sister Margherita Marchione, a professor emerita at Fairleigh Dickinson University who is considered the foremost defender of Pius outside the Vatican"" (Paul Vitello, NY Times, 3/7/10)

Dietrch Bonhoeffer was executed for his role in efforts to overthrow Hitler, in which Pope Pius XII had acted as an intermediary:
* ""Bonhoeffer was in the heart of the conspiracy, lending emotional support and encouragement to those more directly involved, such as his brother Klaus and his brother-in-law Dohnanyi....Dohnanyi got in touch with Dr. Joseph Mueller, a Munich lawyer with strong ties to the Vatican....Muller's assignment in October 1939 was to travel to Rome....to make contact with the British ambassador to the Holy See and gain some assurance of peace from the British if those in the conspiracy could oust Hitler....He convinced the pope to agree to act as an intermediary between Britain and the fledgling German government that formed following Hitler's demise"" (pp. 358, 359).",1341360000,16,6066,5.710963455149502

5058884,1,B0077176AM,"This revisionist nonsense is an insult to Minister Bonhoeffer, and innumerable priests and nuns that risked their lives to save Jews, many of whom were caught, tortured, and murdered with Jews.  True martyrs should not be confused with self-serving murderers as ""Silence is Compliance.""  Jesus would have been ashamed that this pope idly watched the mass deportations and murder of men, women, and children for the ""crime"" of being Jewish as was our Lord Jesus.

The Holocaust is a black mark against humanity that can never be extinguished as well as a black mark against Pope P. XII.

Rewriting history via this film and similar distasteful books does not alter the fact that many Christians endangered themselves from even within Germany itself, but PP XXII was too cowardly even from within Rome to risk his power and wealth of the church to even speak up and defend the vulnerable and innocent.

Had PP XII not been so incredibly selfish then he would have spokenly clearly and loudly to our brother Christians throughout Europe to fight the nazis, potentially saving millions of lives.

To embrace this horrendous lie of a film is to tarnish the memory of those TRUE leaders of Christianity, ""the flock not the pope"" who died trying to save only a small number of lives let alone the millions PP XII discarded in his evil complicity with the nazis.  Remember PP XII truthfully as an example of yet another ""leader"" gone astray and that blind obediance to Hitler or to PP XII leads to doom and moral impoverishment if favor of worthless material wealth and corruption of the church.

Jesus would be disappointed by this film, director, and actors!!!!",1338163200,3,1655,4.864768683274021
5058885,5,B0077176AM,"At last, a picture of this Pope, declared as a righteous man by the Jews post WW 2.  A tortured humanitarian and spiriitual leader.

5058887,3,B0077176AM,"This 200-minute made-for-TV movie (in two parts) depicts Pope Pius XII during World War II. He lives in Vatican City surrounded by Axis-controlled Rome. As the movie starts, the Germans are moving in since Mussolini is faltering and the Allies have landed on Italy. Part of the German's program is to deport Italian Jews to the German concentration camps. So both the war and the Holocaust loom over the city. The story isn't just about Pius XII. At least half the story follows three Jews who live in the Jewish Ghetto--two guys and a gal. At the beginning they have a love triangle--intellectual and supporter of the resistance Marco is the ""nice guy"" while black market profiteer Davide is the ""bad guy."" He's not so bad, though. He helps out people when he can. The girl is Miriam, whose father owns a bookshop with a secret printing press in the basement. In addition to producing propaganda, they can forge travel documents. As the Nazis clamp down, they are forced to flee, though our trio can't make it out of the city and have to hide in local monasteries and convents (which has been allowed by a direct order from Pius XII). The story goes on until the liberation of Rome by American troops in 1944.

James Cromwell (from Babe and L. A. Confidential) plays Pius XII and does a fine job showing both his inner conflict and his integrity. The three actors in the love triangle (which is fairly chaste and the romantic part resolves about half way through, leaving them to suffer under the German threats) are okay but their storyline is cliche and less interesting than the actual historical events. The Nazis characters run the gamut from fairly interesting to one-dimensional and wooden.

The history is accurate but occasional bits (like the flashback describing how a papal encyclical denouncing the Nazi government was distributed and received in 1930s Germany) feel more like an infomercial than good storytelling. At one point in the movie the Nazis plot to kidnap Pius XII but nothing interesting ever comes of it. The movie looks like it is trying to balance historical accuracy with an interesting story but overall doesn't hit the mark.

Surely this accurate depiction of Pius XII's actions to protect Jews during World War II is important but the movie isn't as satisfying as it could be.",1460937600,,2309,4.811083123425693

5058890,5,B0077176AM,"James Cromwell provides a believable and outstanding performance, possibly a career apogee.  This movie was recommended to me while on a Holy Land Pilgrimage last month.  Although I had a negative view of Pius XII during this time period, this film provided me with the factors and realities that pressed on him, the Roman Jews, and Rome during the occupation by the Nazis in the year prior to the Allied liberation in 1944.

The movie appears as a story of historical fact encased in several love stories.  The story appears to stem from knew materials the Vatican has released recently that paint Pius XII as a champion of the protection of the Jews.  It is a similar theme shot on location as another film I recently acquired from Amazon, Captain Corelli's Mandolin.  However, the latter has the back drop of the fabulous scenery of Cephalonia, Greece.

Under the Roman Sky was produced by Ignatius Press which seems to have a Roman Catholic slant but produces glowing films of this type regarding their religious icons.  Whatever the true story was, this film, through the credible performance of Cromwell, creates an image of Pius II which aligns him with sainthood.

5058902,5,B0077176AM,"Pius XII: Under the Roman Sky is a TV movie based on Vatican documents and testimonies about the secret actions taken by Pope Pius XII during World War II.

After the German soldiers occupied Rome in 1943,The Fuhrer,Adolph Hitler is ready to implement The Final Solution on the Jewish people. The screenplay features on how Pope Pius managed to save over 10,000 Jews as churches and convents in Rome were used to hide them from the Nazi soldiers. Aside from that,he also convinced high-ranking Nazi officials to cooperate with him by talking to them and touching their conscience about the evil deeds that the ordered to do. Added to that,the Pope did pray a lot and made sure that many bishops and priests fully cooperate with him. But despite all his efforts, thousands were deported to concentration camps such as Auschwitz. Added to that,it also told the story of the Jewish people before and during the German occupation of Rome. Also,we are introduced to many Jewish characters particularly Miriam and Davide,who are in love with each other and how the war affected them in way especially the former after she was captured by the Germans.

James Cromwell did a wonderful job in his performance as the Venerable Pope Pius XII.He portrayed the role very as a man with courage and conviction on doing good. He practically saved the movie from average acting from his co-stars particularly the gorgeous Alessandra Mastronardi,who was definitely wooden and uninteresting in her role as Miriam. As for the TV movie,it would have been better if it was central to telling the story of Pope Pius XII and his actions especially to quiet the doubters and critics who have considered this film more of a propaganda and a history revision by the Vatican to cover-up their inaction towards the Jews. I felt that the addition of the love story between Miriam and Davide provided some sort of a distraction to the main story instead of being focused on the Pope himself and his struggles against the Germans especially with regards to the Jews. But nevertheless,I still think that the movie did a wonderful job in providing the viewer information on the great deeds and defense of the late Pope Pius XII inspite of its flaws.",1417824000,,2215,4.841688654353562

Too bad they omitted the part about Pius sending birthday greetings every year during the war up till Hitler's death.  Pius never once uttered any public statement against Hitler nor did he make any public statement admonishing Catholics everywhere from participating in the Holocaust.  Yet after the war, he publicly threatened Italian Catholics with excommunication if they even VOTED for a communist.  It is clear where his sympathies lay.

So it would've honestly been nice if both sides of the story were reflected to some level instead of pure glorification of the church.

5058935,3,B0077176AM,"For a film that had so much going for it, this one was a real letdown, and I'm someone who's usually well disposed to this sort of Italian Catholic TV historical epic. Although it's called ""Pius XII"" on the American DVD release, the titular pope barely appears in this story, which is dominated by the fictionalized plight of a Roman Jewish family trying to survive the Nazi occupation of Italy in 1943. This latter story smacks of fictionalization and is fitfully interesting, but the film's biggest problem is that there are two story-lines -- one of Pius XII trying to outwit the Germans through diplomacy and one of the Roman Jews trying to survive -- that parallel each other without ever really intersecting in any meaningful way. It feels like you're watching two separate movies which coexist while remaining generally unaware of one another: The threads connecting them are extremely thin and don't even directly involve the pope as a visibly active protagonist. Furthermore, the Roman Jewish story dominates nearly every frame of this three-hour miniseries, relegating the figure of Pius XII to a minor background character for long stretches of screen time. This is unfortunate because it replaces the only good actor in the film -- James Cromwell as Pius XII -- with endless scenes of poorly dubbed Euro-actors churning through all of the usual romantic and historical cliches. Had the film been edited down to 90 minutes, removing most of the unnecessary fictionalized elements with the Jewish family, it might have gained some focus as tighter exploration of the complex historical legacy of Pius, but the film wastes time on so many unnecessary and poorly acted character scenes that it undermines its own message. It has a great star in James Cromwell and an excellent director in Christian Duguay, but both have done better work on Christian epics. Check out Cromwell as Cardinal Adam Sapieha, mentor to Cary Elwes' young Karol Wotyla, in the 2005 CBS miniseries ""Pope John Paul II"" for a truly moving character role. In about half the screen time, Cromwell creates his trademark sympathetic character in Sapieha without laboring, whereas in this newer film he is actually preachy -- giving self-referential lectures on human dignity to German officials and others -- to the point that the viewer may feel like enlisting in the German Army to shut him up. Cromwell is hampered by an unfocused script, but John Gielgud did a much better Pius XII as a supporting character to Gregory Peck's monsignor and Christopher Plummer's Nazi colonel in 1983's ""The Scarlet and the Black,"" which remains the definitive portrayal of Vatican efforts to rescue the innocent during Germany's occupation of Rome. For the French Canadian director Duguay, check out his ""Joan of Arc"" (1999) CBS miniseries with Lelee Sobieski for his best work in this genre or even his more recent St. Augustine miniseries (due on DVD in November from Ignatius Press Films under the title of ""Restless Heart"") to see him at his best. Better films on similar themes include Anna Paquin in the Hallmark Hall of Fame film ""The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler"" and Ben Cross in ""The Assisi Underground."" This ""Pius XII"" film is handsomely mounted, beautifully shot, and historically authentic in appearance. It's generally watchable and will pass the time for a few hours, but dramatically and artistically it's a real dud.",1380067200,5,3402,5.033687943262412
5058936,5,B0077176AM,"This movie helps dispel the myth that Pope Pius XII was a Nazi sympathizer, as the liberal media and various anti-Catholic extremist miscreants would have us believe. BRAVO! FOUR STARS!",1379462400,,185,5.2
5058937,3,B0077176AM,"This was an entertaining drama though I feel mislead by the title.

  In over 3 hours, Pius XII is actually seen on screen in what seemed like less than a third of the entire movie.  This was a disappointment and the reason I docked this otherwise fine drama by a star.

  As another reviewer indicated the central story here is chiefly a love story.  There are two Jewish young adults and a few other characters during the persecution whom they interact with that are the main focus of the movie.  This fills up the majority of the screen time.  Then every once in a while as if the director was reminded of the movie's title, there are also some scenes with the Pope in scattered Vatican scenes once in a while.

  We learn little about the Pope's background.  Also little of his actual historical actions and not much of the scope of those actions.  It was only after reading the insert booklet that came with the DVD after watching the entire movie that I learned that Pope Pius XII actually saved over 40,000 Jews in Italy.  I did not learn that from this movie which shows us only a very small subset of those saved apparently so that we get to know them and empathize with drama the smaller cast of characters.

  Though I enjoyed this movie for the one viewing, its interest for repeated viewings once seen is low as I already know the central love story now as well as their hardships and the Pope is not a major part of the movie as I had first expected.  So I docked it a second star as I will likely not be watching this movie again.",1378080000,6,1545,4.317073170731708

It is truly a testimonial to the great efforts of Pope Pius XII and his priests and nuns in those terrible years of suffering. This movie evoked a great deal of reflection on me and my family and confirmed the great admiration that we have for the memory of Pope Pius XII. It brought tears to our eyes. We truly and honestly felt great compassion for the Jewish community and what they endured at the hand of Hitler's regime.

5058948,4,B0077176AM,"I have really mixed feelings about this film.  On one hand, I really loved it for every time James Cromwell is on the screen as His Holiness Pope Pius XII it felt like I was watching Pope Pius.  Moreover, there were many subtle references to his devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary, such as praying the Rosary on a regular basis and even praying the Hail Holy Queen prayer, which is great since he declared the dogma of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary in 1950.  And even the secondary plot was effective, although it seemed to eventually carry more weight in the film by Part 2 and focused less on Pope Pius despite his name being in the title of the film.

However, my biggest problem with this film is that failed to address the extensive effort that Pope Pius XII made to save the Jews.  Granted it showed it on the local level in Rome and briefly alluded to many convents, monasteries, and parishes in Rome that sheltered the Jews, but Pius' efforts went beyond Rome and the film never addressed the Church's efforts to save the Jews on a broader scale and helped numerous Jews immigrate to safe countries outside of Europe.  Seeing that the film was over three hours long it should have shown this or at least had an epilogue that mentioned this before the credits.  The numbers vary on exactly how many Jews Pope Pius and the Church as a whole saved from the Nazi Holocaust, but many statistics show that he saved as many if not even more Jews that Oscar Shindler did, and yet Shindler is remembered as a hero (and rightfully so) but a black legend now exists that makes people believe that Pope Pius worked with Hitler instead of against him in WWII.

This film refers to Pope Pius' many statements and even an encyclical he wrote where he blasted the Nazis.  This was really awesome!  However, rather than build upon this to show the exhaustive work that Pope Pius did behind the scenes as Vatican City was surrounded by German occupied Rome.  The film showed some of this but did not even allude to the greater work that Pope Pius did.  Again, seeing that the film was over 3 hours long and a greater focus on the secondary plot in Part 2, this could have and should have been addressed.  For this reason, despite the wonderful portrayal of Pope Pius by James Cromwell, this film really missed the mark.  Considering that Ignatius Press already had a documentary that covers this material&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Hand-of-Peace-Pope-Pius-XII-and-the-Holocaust/dp/B001PB5Q84/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Hand of Peace: Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust</a>&nbsp;and they were the studio that made this film, they should have included this in the plot, which could have completely shattered the black legend about this wonderful and heroic Pontiff.",1374278400,36,2807,4.894514767932489

With perfect hindsight, those who say that ""He could have..."" have no understanding of the situation of the time, or the limitations of the Pope's power.

5058961,5,B0077176AM,"This is an epic film that tries in a most sincere way to lay to rest the controversies surrounding the war time role of Pope Pius XII, based on Vatican documents and personal testimonies currently being utilized for the beatification of this extraordinary man of God.

This movie has 2 parts. The first part begins with the Pope in his study. He sees a section of Rome being bombed and along with his entourage, taking with him supplies, he rushes to the scene of the incident to comfort the victims. It is followed by the Armistice of 1943 where by the Italy leaves the Axis. The citizens of Rome falsely believe that the war has come to an end. However this sets the precedent for the Nazi occupation of Rome. The Jewish community until then, lives in relative safety and here we meet the characters of Miriam and Davide, two twenty somethings who are long time friends and who secretly share a love for each other. The first part primarily is spent on the political situation in occupied Rome as well as the lives of these two people and their family.
In Part II, the Nazi occupation begins and we begin to see the actual role the pontiff plays to ensure the safety of the Jewish community by opening up the convents, monasteries and churches to shelter the refugees and getting a Nazi general to collaborate with the Vatican so as to protect these peoples whom are being sheltered. Also depicted is the elaborate plan that the Nazis had to kidnap the Pope.

What is well portrayed is the initial reluctance to help by some of the clergy,justifiably out of fear for their own safety, and after a impassioned secretly coded speech by the Pope, the great generosity and warmth with which these poor victims were welcomed with open arms by the same religious while exposing themselves to the same danger, and even standing up to the Nazi tormentors.

There is much more that can be said about this great film, however I would like you to watch it for yourselves.

My grievance with this film is that too much time has been spent on the love interest of Miriam and Davide, which could have been focused more on the Pope himself.

Also in this film we learn that some of the officials in the Nazi army were PRACTICING Catholics and were opposed to the agenda set by their superiors but were too afraid too intervene, that is until they are approached by the Pope who encourages them to stand up for what is right. This is merely tip of the iceberg in which the Pope was able to awaken the consciences of many.

James Cromwell does a stellar job in his role as Venerable Pope Pius XII.
One clearly feels the urgency of the times and the tensions are quite palpable.

The film is 200 minutes long in English with English and Spanish subtitles.

There is a very informative 16 page booklet which consists of the following chapters.
1. About the film
2. A short biographical column indicating the highlights of the Pope's life.
3. Venerable Pope Pius XII; Facts about his life and Pontificate
4. The Pope and the Jews by Deacon Harold Burke-Sivers and Carl E. Olson.
5. Four key papal texts from the pontificate of Pope Pius XII.
6. Scene selections.

This booklet also contains many stills from the film.

As mentioned earlier this film is sincere in trying to set the records straight. How successful it was is really debatable. However, one cannot fault the excellent portrayals of the Pope and the battles of consciences.

I would recommend the following documentary to complement this film:

The historical background is woven around a love story which tends to dominate the movie.  This takes the focus a bit from the historical background, but I suppose they had to find a way to make the movie interesting in this era when history in itself is not a big draw for many people.

I am interested in Pius XII and his efforts to save the Jews.
