6433514,5,B00KM478RW,"I purchased the DVD of Diana Kralls Live In Paris when it was first issued and rated it highly. In 2009 I bought my first blue ray disc player and looked forward to the release of this blue ray version of the concert disc. It is now here and everything about it screams excellent.

Initially I feared the disc might not play on my Region A/1 (US) blue ray disc player. Not to worry. The disc is apparently region free, and the cover indicates no region. As with the DVD the audio of this disc is superb. The picture is SD Blue Ray (enhanced standard definition) and here Eagle Vision Studios did (in my opinion) a much better job than it did with the release of the Bee Gees blue ray disc.

Diana Kralls band, led by John Clayton, Anthony Wilson and Jeff Hamilton is complimented by Alan Broadbents European Symphony Orchestra for an evening of most delightful entertainment. This is jazz standards galore. Buy the disc and enjoy!",1430784000,10,930,4.497041420118343

6433518,5,B00KM478RW,"I just put on my new Blu-ray copy of Live in Paris - which I've had on DVD for years - and fell in love with this concert all over again. Diana Krall's piano playing and Anthony Wilson's guitar solos are stellar - and the excitement of the band members about the quality of each others' playing is written on their faces.  The core quartet (piano, bass, drums, and guitar) was put together for the trip to Paris and had only been  playing togther for 4 days - but became her regular group for her next  several records (and on the Rio disk). It's a shame that she's been pigeon-holed as a singer, since she's a great jazz pianist, with very inventive solos, and accompanies her sideman's solos - which she's very generous about letting last several choruses - very tastefully.

The Blu-ray's image quality is several steps up from the DVD - and I'm watching it projected quite large. It's hard to believe that this is an upscaling job, since my player and projector have always upscaled to 1080 well, but not like this. I didn't realize how much sharper this was until I put the DVD in afterwards. They must have done this sharpening frame-by-frame.

Sure, the hand-held 8mm home movie footage around Paris looks grainy either way (if you want nice travel footage, stay with the Rio disk's scenic footage shot in HD), but concert closeups of faces and instruments on the Blu-ray are satisfyingly sharp, while the same shots on the DVD look obviously soft by comparison. In fact, the footage of the other musicians looks better than on the Rio disk.

The sound is clearer than on the DVD as well, with more high-end and dynamic range.

Get this disk!",1421107200,12,1649,4.569491525423729
6433519,5,B00KM478RW,"I've viewed this concert many times on dvd. I'm
really looking forward to having it on bluray. The music, production, lighting, the orchestra, the engineering  as well as everything connected with this concert is perfection of the highest order. The rhythm section cooks from start to finish. John Clayton on upright bass with that ever present grin on his face says it all. His close friend Jeff Hamilton on drums is nothing less then a complete master of his craft. Anthony Wilson on guitar always leaves me completely speechless whenever I hear him on this dvd. I'm a jazz guitarist myself and know what it takes to play at this level even though I'm  not there yet and may never be. If Diana Krall never sang a note and merely played the piano on this dvd, this would still be one of the greatest live performances ever recorded. This lady can really put down. With the addition of her vocals along with the swingingest rhythm section you will ever hear, and the orchestra arranged by Claus Ogerman makes this a once in a lifetime listening experience never to be forgotten. Fortunately I'll  have it soon on bluray and so can you to listen to and watch over and over again. J.B.",1420329600,,1183,4.597156398104265

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: This is a long awaited Eagle Rock Entertainment Blu-ray Disc, is proud to release the Diana Krall: Live In Paris' Blu-ray. This new Blu-ray presents an upscaled standard definition original material with 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround and also uncompressed stereo and sound for the best possible quality. Live in Paris' is a classic Diana Krall concert from 2001.

Live In Paris' was filmed at the Olympia in Paris in late 2001, was Diana Krall's first concert film and was released on DVD in 2001. The concert features tracks from her first four albums including many that have remained firm concert favourites to this day. It was an instant hit and went on to be certified gold, platinum and multi-platinum in many countries around the world. Now for the first time the original standard definition footage is being reissued on Blu-ray disc to benefit from the best available picture and sound quality.

As well as improved picture and sound quality, this release also offers bonus videos for ""The Look Of Love"" and ""Let's Face The Music And Dance"", plus concert rehearsal footage of ""Do It Again,"" ""The Look Of Love"" and ""Love Letters.""

This is a large, lush polished Blu-ray production with the Orchestre Symphonique Europeen & Paris Jazz Big Band and not one, but two conductors. Diana Krall also has her own jazz accompaniment for the smaller numbers. Some of her hard-core fans are not going to like this big band style, although some of the more intimate numbers try hard to imitate a jazz setting to varying degrees of success.

Diana Krall, like many jazz musicians, is in the latter category as one must interpret `jazz standards' and in doing so, one makes Nat King Cole's or Frank Sinatra's or Burt Bacharach's songs their own, and Diana Krall has done a disc full of Nat King Cole songs. Some people like the live performance to be identical to the released album; this is the ultimate what you see is what you get and it can make for some very sterile performances however.

Let me say that the arrangements and orchestrations here are completely different to any of her past performances, with the tempo, emphasis, nuances and phrasing all largely changed. Songs that are strongly lyrical are now perhaps more instrumental. I would say Diana spends more time playing on some tracks than singing, so much so that there are instrument solos here that are `missing' (as it were) on the original track. Slow songs are now jumped up several notches in speed and some songs sound much more relaxed than the Compact Disc tracks.

It is this variation that jazz lovers revel in. I might say, ""the track is as good as on the actual Compact Disc, but you should hear the version on this stunning Blu-ray."" I guess this will be stated a lot when this Blu-ray gets into mass circulation, because some of the tracks have already become my firm favourite versions.

The seventeen tracks are a brilliant varied selection from several of her past CD Albums, especially the Diana Krall awesome special DTS and SACD surround compact discs I have in my CD Collection, although the emphasis is more on the recent ones. As always, there are one or two tracks that I wish were there but that's the nature of these almost `best of' performances. I wonder if there isn't more footage somewhere? But despite that, here is the actual Blu-ray track listing:

Track Listing: 01. I Love Being Here With You. 02. All or Nothing. 03. Let's Fall In Love. 04. The Look of Love. 05. Maybe You'll Be There. 06. 06. Deed I Do. 07. Devil May Care. 08. Cry Me A River. 09. Under My Skin. 10. East Of the Sun. 11. I Get Along. 12. Pick Yourself Up. 13. S'Wonderful. 14. Love Letters. 15. I Don't Know Enough About You. 16. Do It Again. 17. A Case of You.

Blu-ray Video Quality  This is a very high quality anamorphic 1.78:1 feature with a very nice 1080p encoded image. The overall look is very fine; the colours are rich, the browns of the wood instruments and strings, the sheeny black of the piano finish versus the flatter black of the tuxedos and Diana Kralls's leather jacket. The darkness levels are strong, with excellent shadow and solid detailed blacks. It has my favourite feature which is translucent smoke. Skin tones are excellent, with the older male performers looking suitably lined - it is sharp enough to pick out individual hairs. There are close ups of Diana and the piano keyboard. The production looks to have used high quality Digital Video or video cams as there are trademarks like some stair casing and aliasing on guitar necks, piano keys and bows. There is also isolated bloom/bleed especially with some of the coloured highlights. There is a stylistic device that I'm certain will get up the nose of many people. Because it is Paris the producers have decided to intercut various scenes of the Paris streetscape into the concert. They are drab, grainy clips of the Arc de Triomphe, the Tripartite, the Parisians boulevards and tree-lined avenues. I am expecting the Eiffel Tower to pop up soon! Because of the look, I suppose you could call it ""Paris in Autumn."" One part I do really like and that is the rehearsal footage that's also interleaved into the concert. Shooting style is consistent and intelligent with no jarring angles or cuts, whilst the lighting is low but intimate. Crowd shots are limited with the band and orchestra as the focus.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Sonically there are two audio tracks, which are 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and 2.0 Dolby Digital Stereo. The stereo track is largely just under Compact Disc quality. Firstly, rear speaker use is limited to very faint audience and ambience. For me it's pretty much a front channel performance; I would be a bit offended if there was a strong rear channel element in a jazz type setting. The audience participation is limited but it's welcome when it happens. About that soundstage, it is diminished with the stereo track, perhaps those subtle rears are missed here in setting ambience. Avoid the stereo track, instead definitely go for the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, as that will make you feel you are actually at the concert and sitting in the audience, because the DTS track provides a totally smooth, relaxing detailed performance.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: There are two music videos added on that have nothing to do with the main performance. They both have that MTV sheen of a high dollar, well produced music video. Both are Dolby stereo and of listenable close to CD quality and both are identical to the CD Album tracks, i.e. they are standard studio releases.

Special Feature: Music Videos [1080p]  The Look of Love [4:3]. Let's Face the Music and Dance is 2.35:1 anamorphic and of a similar quality. You can see the long hours the producers spent creating the appropriate image. Both are standard track in length. I don't terribly mind the Dolby Stereo as they are the actual CD Album tracks.

Special Feature: Exclusive Rehearsal Footage [1080p] However, the best extra is a good one. Included is a just under 16 minute rehearsal and this is something that more music discs should have. It is of identical quality to the main production, that is, it is anamorphic and it has a 5.1 DTS track. It is much more casual, impromptu even, with performers in plain clothes and the performance is just as good if not better. Three songs are featured, Do It Again, The Look of Love and Love Letters. You can contrast the differences between these tracks and the ones in the main feature and these differences are there, even if they are slight. It is not chaptered, alas, however at least the menus and intro clip are stylishly understated.

Finally, I don't see how any lover of jazz and bossa nova cannot wind up buying this. Technically it's totally excellent and I what to expect from a full bitrate DTS track and you can swap the Dolby Stereo track for a purist 2.0 LPCM Stereo track if you prefer, but that's neither here nor there. The performances are uniformly fresh and excellent, with the `old' songs sounding so new and exciting in their execution. Personally I do not mind that `bigness' of the performances, whereas some people do not like the use of a jazz band and orchestra, but it is one interpretation and a good one. The video quality is excellent and the sound is close to perfect. There are lots of songs included within the 130 minutes and the rehearsal footage is a great bonus. I haven't had this disc for very long, but I love it already and an absolute pleasure to review. Live In Paris' captures Diana Krall doing what she does best, captivating the viewer with an amazing show, and that stunning voice, this is a must for any of her fans. Very Highly Recommended!

8659856,4,B00KM478RW,"I already own the DVD of the same recording and was interested in better video quality, which I got.  The Blu Ray has a distinctly different approach to ""surround sound"". The DVD has the perspective of a first row seat, with the musicians spread out in front of you and the reverb occurs in the surrounds, per normal. With the Blu Ray, the surround channels are much louder than on the DVD and Diana Krall's piano is much more present in the surround channels, sometimes to a distracting degree. It is almost as if you are on stage with the piano 90 degrees to your right. Reminds me of the old quadraphonic recordings of the 70's in that respect. Despite the fact that this is an SD Blu Ray, the video quality is quite good, noticeably better than the DVD.
