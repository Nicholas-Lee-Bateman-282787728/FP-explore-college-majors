8248708,4,B00130GP96,"My son, who at 3.5 years was delayed in his speech compared to peers, enjoyed theses DVDs. It did in fact help expand his ability to ask questions.  The format of this DVD is slightly different than the sentence builder series's which he enjoyed more, however I still think this was a worthwhile purchase.  Others may not like the simplicity of the videos but I think that is what makes them a good product.  This isn't a Disney movie and there's a good reason for that. It uses simple repetition and visual scenarios to help children understand the message.  The use of children in the examples is perfect.  While this didn't make my child fluent in his questions, he did pick up some language cues from the video that we could directly hear when he spoke to us.  Learning and language is a slow process and this was a good tool at the time he needed it.",1410998400,3,855,4.414012738853503
