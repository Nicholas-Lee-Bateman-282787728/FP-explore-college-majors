8036514,2,B00061S58C,"The curiously-titled ""Blade Rider"" takes three episodes of Chuck Connors' half-hour TV series, ""Branded,"" and links them together into a single feature. Since the story-line of each episode has little to do with either of the other story-lines, the result is a shapeless sort of hodgepodge which offers only sporadic points of interest. The first episode,  ""Now Join the Human Race,"" features Burt Reynolds as an Indian who's found trouble by leaving the Reservation. It was first aired on 9-19-1965. ""Fill No Glass for Me"" is a two-parter episode first aired on 11-7-1965 and 11-14-1965. It features Greg Morris but is best remembered for its beefcake-bondage scene of a bare-chested Chuck Connors spreadeagled between the branches of a tree under a scorching-hot sun. You can almost smell the sweat. The third episode, ""Call to Glory,"" is another two-parter first aired on 2-27-1966 and 3-6-1966. It stars Robert Lansing as General Custer. Fans of the ""Branded"" series might enjoy this compilation but they'd be better served by buying a DVD set of the entire series. The VHS tape reviewed here is of only so-so quality, particularly in regard to its somewhat faded color.",1333411200,,1174,5.114583333333333
