I have to be honest here and tell you I have never seen Ti Lung do a bad job no matter what the movie rating.  The Yip Hoi character played by Frankie Chan is his best.  He should have given him, Yip, another movie.
The transfer to dvd is very good.  Subtitles deserve the usual complaints.",1363478400,,428,4.234567901234568
