174221,4,0980357349,I always like Dr. Lam's Videos very much. It is a lot of help learning how to do sitting Tai Chi for Arthritis.,1364169600,9,111,3.869565217391304
174222,5,0980357349,"I have had people tell me that it is not tai chi if you are sitting down. These are usually people that think their form of tai chi is ""real tai chi."" Seated Tai Chi for Arthritis is ""real"" tai chi. I teach tai chi as an exercise. People who have difficulty standing do this form and exercise while sitting. Sometimes they even gain enough strength to start standing. That is what tai chi is all about. Helping people.",1317859200,25,418,4.30379746835443
174223,4,0980357349,"I bought this dvd because I have cerebral palsy and have some balance problems that can make standing exercise dangerous.  This is a good introduction to basic tai chi adapted for the seated practitioner.  The warm up exercises give a good whole body work out, considering that you are seated.  The adaptions of tai chi for seated use, still use some leg muscles (if you are able) in ways that give some of the same lower body practice through selective muscle contractions.  Dr. Lam's dual background as a medical doctor and a tai chi instructor allows him to combine both areas to get the maximum tai chi motions for a seated individual.

I would have rated the dvd higher if there had been more forms to practice.  I also got it for my parents who are in their 80's and it is a good safe low impact workout for them too.",1282435200,30,823,4.417218543046357

7794953,4,0980357349,"I have quite progressed Muscular Dystrophy, and very modified it works for me.  One thing I do though, so I can follow from the correct side, considering I'm facing them, is I use the VLC media player (it's free online, but maybe other players can do this too) and flip it horizontally.  I do that by going to Tools -> Effects & Filters -> Video Effects, then tick the Transform box, and from the drop down below it, choose Flip horizontally.",1494806400,,442,4.444444444444445
7794954,5,0980357349,I used to take Tai Che classes with my mother who has Alzheimer's and very limited mobility.  It occurred to me that if I could find a Tai Chi instructional video that could be done sitting down it might help her balance.  This is it! She remembered that she took Tai Chi and was excited about doing the exercises.  So happy I found this. It gives us a little extra quality time and I have no doubt she'll benefit from it.,1488758400,2,422,4.185185185185185

7794959,5,0980357349,Since I had one knee replacement and need the other one done I needed to devise a exercise program that I could maintain without causing knee pain.  Since I have heard of Dr. Lam before I was hoping that he had a program for seated Tai Chi and I was so happy to find this DVD.  The program is easy to follow and is giving me all the benefits of doing a standard type of Tai Chi.,1432425600,8,378,3.896103896103896
7794960,5,0980357349,"this is very good for me, as i have arthritis, and it is more difficult to do standing exercises.  the tai chi especially is slow and easy, and being seated is a plus.",1408579200,5,167,4.0606060606060606
7794961,5,0980357349,"Overall, I would highly recommend this video, Seated Tai Chi for Arthritis: 6 lessons with Dr. Paul Lam. Many individuals with health issues will find this DVD useful for learning a seated Tai Chi practice that focuses on improving mobility, flexibility, and seated balance, and provides gentle overall body strengthening.  I was able to use it from my first day after hip surgery.
