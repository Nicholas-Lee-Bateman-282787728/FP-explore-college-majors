2424823,4,B000BMY2KQ,"The son of an American soldier and a Vietnamese travles to America in the search of his father.  That's the story, his and the one of millions of immigrants looking for a better world.
This story is so potent that even some Hollywoodian clichs cannot ruin it (romantic music when he is with the Chinese girl, for example).  What is told is so important that the fact that our hero comes straight out of difficult situations without many problems is a mistake that can be forgiven.  The end is so subtle that you wish the little imperfections would be corrected to make this film closer to a classic.  My recommendation is to watch it: it helps a little bit to understand the way the world works, even when all the participants involved in the story don't go out of the way to make real problems for our half-American half-Vietnamese boy (after watching it think about all the things that could have gone ""really"" wrong).",1130284800,,920,4.591463414634147
2424824,5,B000BMY2KQ,"See this film...It's the best film of the year that nobody saw. If it didn't have Asian actors in the leading roles, it probably would have gotten more attention as it's a fine piece of work, worthy of the Best Picture Oscar, in my opinion. Even Nick Nolte (in a small, but pivotal role) delivers one of his best and most reserved performances in a long time. This is one journey you won't regret taking!",1129161600,5,404,4.4

2424826,5,B000BMY2KQ,"THE BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY opens in rural Vietnam in 1990. A young man, Binh (Damien Nguyen), is obviously unlike his fellows. He's tall and large-boned. In fact, he's the offspring of a marriage between a Vietnamese woman and an American serviceman back during the war years. The natives have a derogatory term for such children: Bui Doi, or ""Less Than Dust"". Indeed, Binh is ostracized even among the relatives with whom he lives - he must eat his meals outside rather than around the dining table. And, when another man marries into the family, Binh is forced from the house. Subsequently, he goes to Saigon to find his mother, Mai (Thi Kim Xuan), who works as a housekeeper in the home of an arrogantly rich family, the son of which has fathered a young boy by Mai, Tam (Dang Quoc Thinh Tran).

For a brief period, Binh works for his mother's employer. Then, a tragic accident forces Mai to compel her son to flee aboard a refugee boat with all her savings, Tam, and the Texas address (from their marriage license) of her American husband, Steve, whom she hasn't seen since he abruptly disappeared decades before. The two eventually end up in a well-intentioned, but grim, Malaysian refugee camp/prison. Here, Binh meets, and falls in love with, Ling (Ling Bai), a young singer wannabe from China. The two combine their money to escape to an offshore freighter, a veritable rust bucket, that'll ferry them (and a multitude of other unfortunates) on the final leg to the United States for a steep price up front and a signed contract for indentured servitude upon arrival. The voyage proves to be a nightmare that many don't survive. But, Binh does, and after a period working as a fast food delivery boy in the Big Apple, he sets out for the Lone Star State to find his father armed only with the address and a time-worn picture of Steve, Mai and himself taken when he was a baby.

The viewer may be forgiven for believing that THE BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY is a Vietnamese production. In fact, it's Norwegian, with English-subtitled Vietnamese dialogue evolving to pidgin-English, then American English, as Binh's language skills steadily improve.

The lead actors are undeniably Damien Nguyen and Ling Bai, though, because of their greater familiarity to American audiences, or because it was written into their contracts, Tim Roth and Nick Nolte, both of whom have crucial but relatively small parts, will probably receive billing in the movie adverts way out of proportion to their actual on-screen time. Roth plays the coldy practical, but not completely unsympathetic, captain of the New York bound freighter with its cargo of misery, while Nolte appears as Steve.

The ending of this visually eloquent and poignant film is bittersweet almost to the point of being tragic. Yet, the viewer is sustained by the knowledge that Binh is ultimately in a better place. Indeed, because THE BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY is a convergence of three tragedies, i.e., the plight of the outcast Bui Doi, that of illegal aliens smuggled into the U.S., and the terrible cost of the Vietnam War on some of the American military who served in that conflict, it would be a gratuitous cop-out if the conclusion was more warm and fuzzy.

Finally, if you think ""The Beautiful Country"" necessarily refers to the United States, then think again. For the characters, it's a matter of personal perspective.",1120780800,66,3365,4.886164623467601
2424837,5,B000BMY2KQ,"I do not write a lot of reviews, but I want to say something about this movie.  It is one of the most beautiful films I have ever watched.  Several things about this film: Damien Nguyen deserves an Oscar for this film, one of the most incredible performances I have seen.  The story is not only believable and touching, our main character is one of the finest characters I've seen.  The cinematography is extraordinary and the whole thing is a pleasure to watch.  Sometimes the quiet and contained moments are it's finest.  Lastly the music is absolutely perfect for this film and really moves the emotion.

2424845,3,B000BMY2KQ,"Just watched this movie last night.  It moves at a glacial pace and has long periods with no talking at all.  It leaves you plenty of time to fill in the empty spaces with thinking and what ifs.  Perhaps that's what they were going for.  Based on actual events, the story tugs on the heart strings a few times and also will bring a tear to your eye if you are soft hearted.  It's also frustrating sometimes because the dialog is so slow and you find yourself saying, ""Say something!""  The pace picks up half way through, albeit not a lot, but enough to keep you watching to the end.  I would recommend this movie if you like movies filmed in Vietnam and if you like slow, thinking type movies.",1381104000,,693,4.2846153846153845

2424859,4,B000BMY2KQ,"I didn't loved this movie, but I liked it. It is way better than average for sure. The movie had lots of beautiful scenes. In the beginning I felt that I was actually in Vietnam was watching people and how they lived there. The movie had a great story and plenty of actions with no lag between scenes. I was drawn into Binh life and was really interested in what was going to happen next. I felt sad when he didn't find love. I was happy when he finally found his dad and learn why his dad never went back for him and his mother. The only thing I didn't really like was, they didn't actually show us how Binh will explain to his father that he is his son. I would had love to seen that as well.

2424861,3,B000BMY2KQ,"Unlike other Vietnam War movies, The Beautiful Country allows the viewer to gain an understanding of the discrimination toward Amerasian children born during the Vietnam War.  The journey of the movie's main character in his attempt to leave a country that did not treat him equally, and at the same time to find his American father brings the hard reality of the pain and suffering Amerasian children had to suffer and experience in vietnam up until only a few years ago.  The movie nicely brings the viewer to a successful climax when the father and son reunion becomes a reality. For those of us Vietnam veterans that have personally experienced similar plights, the movie is a must see. For others, I would also recommend the movie if one is inclined to learn more about America's most unpopular war for too many reasons to get into with this review.",1268611200,3,854,4.763513513513513
2424862,4,B000BMY2KQ,"The plot and the characters are a bit clich&eacute;, but I like it that way. The acting and story lines are very well done. The director gets it right in so many ways. The main character, a poor young man of mixed American / Vietnamese parentage, is both shy and strong. His mother is loving and faithful. Her, and later his, employers are haughty, exploitive, and distrustful. This results in an unfortunate accident and his immediate departure to Malaysia with his younger half brother. Enter the Chinese refugee (Bai Ling). Attractive, kind, and practical, she makes her way in life by living off her looks. Then onward to the cargo ship for the ocean voyage. The ruthless snakehead ultimately gets his just reward. The refugees make it to America. The work is menial. The undocumented immigrants fall in love, but to no avail. She hooks up with a white American businessman. He travels to Houston and then Sweetwater, Texas, where he finds his long suffering father (Nick Nolte).

2424865,5,B000BMY2KQ,"There is much sadness in this drama. It is a story of an outsider--in this case, a bui doi, or ""less than dust"". This is someone of mixed parentage, specifically, Vietnamese and American, but living in Vietnam. His name is Binh and as the film begins, we see him in search of both his parents, neither of whom he knows.

He finds his mother locally, but also finds out his father is back in America, after marrying his mother in Vietnam. The reasons for his father's abrupt departure are mysterious, which drives the story, as does Binh's meeting Ling, a Chinese woman in search of a better life who, like Binh, also travels to America.

The sadness here penetrates directly to the heart. Ling has feelings for Binh but at the same time wants a life Binh can never give her. Binh has a very young brother, Tam, who accompanies him on his journey to America, during which deep sadness overtakes the two brothers. And when Binh finally does find his father in America, it is a sad reunion for several reasons.

The soul of this story is its simplicity, which is communicated expertly by Hans Molland (director of ""Zero Kelvin"" and ""Aberdeen"") and screenwriter Sabina Murray, who supplies an interview for the DVD. The acting is straightforward and effective; included in the cast is Tim Roth and Nick Nolte, as well as a number of unknown Asian actors, and Bai Ling as Ling. Molland is an interesting director who effectively fuses man, nature, and deep emotions. In ""Zero Kelvin"", this combination had the frigid setting of a polar region; in ""The Beautiful Country"", it is the hardships of life at sea--the journey from Asia to America via freighter.

This is a great piece of cinematic work that should not be overlooked. Very highly recommended.",1181692800,8,1747,4.718032786885246
2424866,5,B000BMY2KQ,"This 2004 Norwegian film begins in Vietnam in 1990.  Here, we meet Binh, the gangly 20-year old son of a Vietnamese mother and American G.I. father.  He looks different from his Vietnamese relatives who are raising him, and he has been taunted all his life for his awkward tallness and mixed race features.  Cast out of his childhood home, he goes to the city where his mother works as a housemaid for cruel wealthy people.  His American father has disappeared long ago but his mother has a marriage license that lists his father's home as Houston, Texas.  His mother gets him a job at the same household where she works where both of them are treated quite badly.  Because of a freak accident that will surely be blamed on Binh, he must leave Vietnam.  His mother gives him her life savings and he and his young half-brother who is about 5 years old leave on a long and unpleasant trek to America.

The trip to America exposes the realities of the global traffic in human beings.  After a harrowing voyage on an open boat, they finally get to a refugee camp in Malaysia which is a virtual prison.  Here, he meets a beautiful young Chinese woman named Ling who sells her body for food and money. She befriends him and helps him care for his young brother.  Later, she uses the money she has saved to get Binh, his brother and herself on a boat that smuggles people to America where Binh is forced to sign an agreement that will put him into virtual slavery.  The voyage is awful and there is little food or water.  People die.  All of this is shown in excruciating detail.  It is absolutely horrible and very very sad.

In America, Binh is forced to work in a Chinese restaurant, living in a barracks where he sleeps on his bed for only a limited time and then must give it up to the next man who will also use it for only a few hours of sleep.  During one very moving scene, he learns from his fellow workers that since his father is an American, he is actually an American citizen and didn't have to sneak into America the way he did.  He could have made an application in Vietnam and been flown here on a jet plane.  I must say that I shared his joy when he learned that.  Now he was free.  He could leave the slavery of the kitchens.

It's a long way from New York to Texas but he is determined to find his father.  He hitches rides.  He does odd jobs and we all get a glimpse of America through his eyes along the way.  Eventually, near the very end of the film he does find his father, played by Nick Nolte.  This meeting is not what I expected and includes its own kind of pathos that pulled at my heartstrings.  The film ends on a bleak but positive note.  It was a satisfactory journey for both Binh and the audience.

The part of Binh is played by a young actor named Damien Nguyen, who came to America from Vietnam at the age of three and grew up in California.  This is his first film which must have been a huge challenge.  He is in every single scene of the movie and had to show a tremendous range of emotions.  I applaud his performance as I applaud this film.  It was real and serious and thought provoking.  I loved it.",1169251200,8,3137,4.261016949152542
2424877,5,B000BMY2KQ,"THE BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY employs a Norwegian director, a half-Filipino writer, and a primarily Chinese and Vietnamese cast to paint its picture of a man's search for self-resolve and his father. As the offspring of a G.I. and a Vietnamese beauty, Binh (exquisitely portrayed by first-timer Damien Nguyen) is oversized and ostracized in his native land.

The plot of this movie is like a Chinese dhow tacking into a wind that keeps changing direction; if you have the patience to watch, its progress is both slow and unpredictable. As Binh progresses on his path, he graduates from fatalistic survival mode to self confidence. And along the way, Binh makes the acquaintance of Tim Roth as the memorable and morally devoid captain of a rusting scow filled with human cargo. (Where has Roth been? This film is a reminder that he's been MIA too long.)

SIDELIGHT: Screenwriter Sabina Murray worked with auteur Terrence Malick (THE THIN RED LINE) on the script preparation. His contributions was to work in memorable visual scenes (of which this movie has many) and the casting of Nick Nolte playing the magnificent wreck of a man. (In other words, playing himself.)",1167868800,16,1158,4.994818652849741

2424879,5,B000BMY2KQ,"This film was very well made and cast-the direction,screenplay,acting,cinematography,and location shooting all blended harmoniously. Nick Nolte's role was small in total screen time,but not in importance. Damien Nguyen was highly effective and believeable as the protagonist even though this is apparently his first film performance. Ling Bai and Temuera Morrison are strong in supporting roles. Ling Bai is an experienced and well-known actress,but Morrison may not be a household name to most in the US-he plays the role of a menacing ""snakehead"" smuggler to perfection-if anyone has seen him in ""Once Were Warriors""made in New Zealand it's apparent that he can play the kind of people you wouldn't want to know real well. The depiction of the alien smuggling operation and its aftermath in the USA is solid-I know from my professional experience of over 20 years as an INS agent. The film has a surprise in it-you think you know the story,but you don't. I don't put spoilers in my reviews. It's truly worth seeing.",1153180800,8,1017,5.132530120481928

The main character's courage and perseverance is really heroic. He rises to meet his challenges under unbelievably consistent bad circumstances...the stigma of being half Vietnamese/ half American, unwanted by both, constantly hanging over his head.

2424882,4,B000BMY2KQ,"The film opens with the statement: 'Bui Doi' meaning: ""less than dust."" The phase is used to describe the children of a Vietnamese mother and an American father. Not an uplifting beginning, but an all to true reality.

Binh (Damien Nguyen), a young man born of a Vietnamese Mother and an American solider decides to go to America in search of his Father. 'The Beautiful Country' chronicles the hardships, disappointments, losses and tragedies that occur along the way.

This is not what I would call a happy movie even though it appears Binh is successful at reaching his ultimate goal in the end. Finding what you are searching for doesn't necessarily mean everything will finally work out as you had hoped. True to its subject matter it shows the situation as it is. Many young adult Vietnamese of mixed origin are still looking for self identity and the Father that left them behind. A story that needs to be told. Ultimately you are left to wonder what 'Beautiful Country' is the title of the film refering to. Vietnam or America?

Wonderful performance by newcomer Damien Nguyen and the exotic Bai Ling, with solid performances by Nick Nolte, Tim Roth and Temuera Morrison.",1140307200,18,1178,4.821782178217822
2424883,4,B000BMY2KQ,"The Beautiful Country is a little seen and limited released film that has good intension like Heaven and Earth(Joan Chen, Tommy Lee Jones). It's a vivid portrayal of Vietnamese and Chinese refugees surviving the journey to America in the early '90s. Even tough Tim Roth and Nick Nolte had made a mere cameo performance, they had receive ludicrous top billing, while this film belongs to new comer Damien Nguyen who carried the film and the mesmerizing Bai Ling who shared some heartbreaking scenes with him was equally powerful.

Binh(Damien Nguyen) plays the offspring of an American soldier(Nick Nolte) and a beautiful Vietnamese woman. He's been abandoned by both parents and left to be raised by his grandparents who treat him like a stranger, because he's mixed race. Bihn eventually head to the Saigon city to find his estranged mother who works as a maid for a healthy family. Their reunion was a heartfelt experience, but a tragic accident forced him to take his half kid brother to flee the country.

While being kept in the Malaysian refugee camp, Binh befriends Ling(Bai Ling), a refugee from China, who dreams of becoming a singer when she goes to America. During this period, they had to endure a lot of hardship and torment, but they eventually escaped and got onto a boat that would take them to America. Tim Roth plays the captain who's seen it all and has no tolerance for anyone who disobey him. During the days floating on the ocean towards America, they had to face life threatening storms and battles amongst the refugees, and the most tragic thing happened when Binh's kid brother died of fever. Also, Ling and Binh gradually becomes sexually involved with each other. Will they be happy together and fulfill their dream lives in America? And will Binh find his biological father in Texas?

This film spent most of the screentime on the days prior to arriving America. At times it seemed a bit slow-paced and it's not really a film about being in America anymore. I must say that Bai Ling is increasingly become a great actress, and she's the most versatile Chinese actress in America since Joan Chen. She's played a villian, hooker, politician, vampire, and her stunning turn as an ageless feutus-eating abortionist in  Three Extremes: Dumplings. I think she's just perfect to play Ling in this film, because the role is a fearless broken soul, and she can speak English with an authentic Chinese accent. I prefer seeing her in starring roles in B-movies rather than the small roles in A-movies.",1135123200,2,2518,4.848837209302325
2424884,5,B000BMY2KQ,"While we are engaged in yet another intrusive ill-advised war, the time is right for the release of a story that reminds us of the lingering malignant consequences of the equally intrusive war in Vietnam. For those who falsely believe that a war is over with the signing of a declaration and the evacuation of troops this magnificently poignant film will be an eye opener. And for those who are aware of the broken families and bitter scars of war marking those who fought on both sides, the story will find a different response - one of memory of pain, regret, and wonder at the tale of just one survivor.

Binh (Damien Nguyen) is a half-breed, his mother a Vietnamese and his father an American soldier, and as such is has no country: he doesn't belong and lives as an outcast.  His struggle for life leads to his departing his village in Vietnam for Saigon where he reconnects with his estranged mother Mai (Thi Kim Xuan Chau), and his very young half brother Tam (Dang Quoc Thinh Tran), who works as a servant in an abusive wealthy Vietnamese household.  The reunion is touching and Binh joins his mother on the staff as a servant. An unfortunate accident occurs forcing Binh to flee to America, his young brother Tam accompanying him at Mai's insistence: Mai sees America as the beautiful country where her sons will find their father in Houston, Texas and have a new life.

The bulk of the film is the treacherous journey of Binh and Tam along with Ling (Ling Bai), a Chinese girl who befriends them. They survive a detention camp in Malaysia, a doomed boat trip, and a long journey aboard a filthy human trafficking ship whose Captain Oh (Tim Roth) monitors their survival (except for Tam who succumbs to fever) and ultimately releases them into the waters along New York.  Binh and Ling survive in Chinatown in New York in the most menial of jobs, again surviving abuse in the land of promise.  Eventually Binh travels to Texas for a reunion with his biological father (Nick Nolte) and even that reunion is marked by the permanent scars the war has left on the survivors.

Through all of the incomprehensible hardships Binh is marked with a spirit of survival that pays homage to the human soul's ability to sustain life through hope.  The message is powerful and for once is not cosmetically altered by the writers or the director or the fine cast. Damien Nguyen and Ling Bai are outstanding and the cameo roles are all superb.  This is an epic film, not a pretty one, but a film about the pity of war, one that pleads the case against war in simply recalling the disastrous after effects that many choose to forget. And it is a story of the triumph of the human spirit.  If we are to ever understand the pity of war and the inhumanity of war, we must be aware of the sequelae.  Highly recommended on every level.
