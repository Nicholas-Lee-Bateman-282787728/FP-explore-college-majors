6756005,5,B00OMBJYOG,"Athena has done it again--another fabulous educational DVD series dealing with the visual world. It is about women who have done marvelous work in the art world, when prior to the 21th century they were excluded professionally, or at best made to over-earn every accolade. The most astonishing revelation for me was seeing the work and hearing the life of an Impressionist that painted as well as Monet. When you hear the story, you'll understand why. It is eye-opening.

This is a must for all curious art lovers; art students; and inspiration for not just women, but any person felt to be a part of an excluded minority. Overcoming is the theme, but beauty is displayed in every scene. Some of the examples had to be dug from the public's unavailable stored treasures in cellars of museums. Women's works of excellence awaiting restoration funds before public display. Alas, the are world yet favors the male artist's work. After seeing this, you'll wonder why.
A must for the DVD shelf of every art library, HS, university, public, or art teacher.

SDH SUBTITLES for all 3 episodes, each a different time period, each with selected represented artistic women. Easily understood narration by Amanda Vickery (Queen Mary Univ, London). She's jubilant, and enjoys what she's doing.

1~~~~16th - 17th century works from Renaissance Italy and the Dutch Republic. During this period it was mainly the church providing professional artistic opportunity to the ladies. Properzia de Rossi trained herself in sculpture by first carving plum pit miniatures. She became the first female to carve in marble in the 16th century; and the masterpiece hangs in a cathedral's gift shop today. Sofonisba Anguissola painted portraits. Clara Peeters was a Dutch stilllife painter. Joanna Koerten excelled in papercuts, while Maria Sibylla Merian was way ahead of time in nature/science art.

2~~~~18th century ladies of Britain and France were considered amateurs (a positive movement at the time) and seldom found paying professional outlets. Some set out to change that. A Swiss-to-London artists Angelica Kauffmann, one of 2 women originally included in the Royal Academy, pushed her work into reproduction marketing masterfully. Elizabeth Vigee-Lebrun (Fr) painted portraits; 37 selfies. Another French artist, Rose Bertin, became Marie Antoinette's designer. Anna Maria Garthwaite was exceptional in bringing new artistic looks to textiles; while another English female, Anne Seymour Damer, became Britain's 1st female sculptor.

3~~~~19th-20th century women's rights movements involved art as well. There it took the form of visual trail blazers, further opening opportunity for ladies in public art. 6 were picked as representative. Lady Elizabeth Butler for war art, typically a man's domain. Berthe Morisot, domentic Impressionism. Gertrude Jekyll, garden design beyond just landscaping. Sweden's Karin Larsson known for interiors, and an art hero to that nation. Madeleine Vionnet, lady fashion that continues in vogue. Georgia O'Keefee, well, the modern lady artist icon.

8684191,3,B00OMBJYOG,"Okay, is the perfect description for this DVD.  The host is energetic and involved but she flaps her hands so much that it's distracting.

8684194,5,B00OMBJYOG,"For a documentary, this is enlightening and extremely interesting!  Usually when I watch them I invariably fall fast asleep (better than anything else I've found to help me get to sleep) but not this one.  Ms. Vickery is so passionate about this subject that even my husband watched part of it (he can't get through most of them either) and loved it as well.  I cannot say enough good things about this DVD - if you love art and want to know why most of the major art works were by men, watch this!  This is a keeper for sure.  Thank you Amanda Vickery!!!!!",1467936000,2,557,4.3173076923076925

8684196,4,B00OMBJYOG,"Very educational. Brought to light all new  names of artists and talents I never heard of before,just because they were woman. Artists who's names and lives should take their place in the history of art and get the full credit they have long been due. Thanks Amanda Vickery.",1440979200,4,274,4.708333333333333
8684197,5,B00OMBJYOG,"If anyone is interested in the struggle of women in the work place and women in the Arts then this DVD is a must.  The narration and the work that went into the product is equal.  That is to say both are outstanding and make for enjoyable viewing.  What some women suffered to survive in the world of art in the Renaissance and through the Baroque are well covered and should make the viewer wonder how they ever survived.
Only viewing will give an idea of which I speak.  A must for art lovers.
One of the leading History of Art did not mention a woman artist until the sixth edition (lack of Capitals intended)",1440374400,5,612,4.2956521739130435
8684198,5,B00OMBJYOG,"Professor Amanda Vickery hosts this stunningly beautiful and fascinating look at the lives of women in the world of art. Beginning with the Renaissance the program charts the progress of women artists, through the centuries up to the early 1900s. This is a story of creativity as well as a chronicle of the barriers and difficulties that were overcome for these women to achieve the right to produce works of art and to gain recognition and acclaim for their talents. Art lovers will appreciate the insights into the creation of these works, and all audiences will enjoy Professor Vickerys presentation style. History comes alive as we view the artists within their cultures and explore the impact of popular thought on their work. The program is in three parts, and is enhanced by a 12 page viewers guide which discusses examples of womens art in the prehistoric age, well known women artists in the global community, and womens contribution to art through fashion.
