The footage is quite hard to see. They tell some very interesting & dramatic stories though. One thing really surprised me though, former supreme allied commander, Dwight D. Eisenhower & General Omar Bradley are among the people who narrate, in actual interviews, along with a couple of fairly high ranking German officers.",1432684800,,493,4.880952380952381
