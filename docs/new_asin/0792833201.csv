138828,5,0792833201,"POLTERGEIST was the first DVD I bought with my player.  It was exciting to see this old film in its widescreen format, and digitally remastered.
Even though the movie was released 17 years ago, it still  hasn't given up any of its spectacular special effects or bone-chilling  storyline.  I don't think anyone could honestly say that clown scene didn't  scare the heebie-jeebies out of them!
Poltergeist was unique in that it  contained a certain sci-fi element inside its main plot of restless ghosts  haunting an innocent family's home.  There hasn't even been an X-Files  episode on the paranormal that was quite as captivating as this  movie.
Rent or buy Poltergeist on DVD (or VHS, if you must).  You won't  be disappointed!",917740800,,729,4.933884297520661
138829,5,0792833201,This is a real surprise! I didn't know that Spielberg had anything to do with this movie. Go rent it or buy it...you'll love it! It's not to scary.....,913161600,,151,4.241379310344827

138897,5,0792833201,"I disagree with those who say POLTERGEIST is dated.  It was the first major horror movie to draw on the conceit of poltergeists or other unnatural objects living in the television; newer movies have more elaborate special effects, but not this film's emotional pull.  JoBeth Williams leads a fine cast in this family horror show that may be too powerful for young children.",1508544000,3,373,4.904761904761905

138977,4,0792833201,"Poltergeist is one of the early 80s films directed by Steven Spielberg who also lead the SFX team ILM. It was the days of SFX before it was replaced by CG graphics. Sci-fi and light-mannered horror films could be the right choices for ILM team to showcase their skill and it did succeed just as ET did. It is purely a horror film for the children. Particularly Caron Ann, five-year-old girl was fantastic. It was too bad Heather O' Rourke who played the role of the girl passed away during the shooting of the third film. It is a nice film to reminisce 80s for sure.",1486598400,,566,4.349056603773585

139164,4,0792833201,"This version of Poltergeist has sub-par picture quality. It's tolerable, but unless you really like this movie, you won't enjoy this release.

That being said, the movie itself holds up well. Poltergeist is really E.T. and Close Encounters re-worked into a horror movie. The themes are the same. An other-worldly menacing force threatens family values. Poltergeists like aliens ask us to question our social mores. Television is a particular target. Did our Iwo Jima veterans and Native Americans live and die so that we can watch cable TV as well as munch on Cheetos and swim in our backyard pools? The national debate continues.

Fortunately, Spielberg doesn't take the sins of our national past too seriously. As usual, he brings up important issues but ultimately keeps the focus on story-telling. Tobe Hooper is on the same page. He's not above using zombie skeletons and sudden loud noises--not to mention evil clowns--to keep things moving.

Acting is pretty good considering all the child actors, though Hooper and Spielberg seem to favor over-acting from their adult actors as well.

I bought the more recent release with the all white cover. As far as I can tell, the visual quality is unimproved. If you still have the old snap-case version, you may want to keep it and save yourself the money. Maybe the Blu-ray is better, I haven't seen it.",1469404800,,1353,4.947136563876652

For the most part, the transfer looks great, the effects still stand out and sometimes even look better than the cgi garbage being thrown at us these days. The bad news is the scenes with the flickering television looks all muddy and murky, one of the disadvantages of HD. The dvd release never had this problem before. Because of the HD transfer we get a lot of digital noise that really makes you wish for an analog television,  it's that bad! As for the extras I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't any cast or crew interviews upon the making of this film. What we do get is a run of the mill documentary about paranormal experiences,  something that would have been okay had there been as I said earlier of the cast and crew. For about 80 percent of the film the transfer looks amazing, but buyer beware when the ""snowy"" and flickering scenes arrive, otherwise a pleasant viewing experience.",1465084800,9,955,4.477011494252873

139242,5,0792833201,"I just had to have this in my video collection.  Anyone who grew up in the 80's knows this movie.  It still does not disappoint.  It has that Steven Spielberg magic and still freaks me out!  I first saw Poltergeist on tv down in the basement when I was six years old.  We were one of the few families who had HBO and all the neighborhood kids gathered in our basement to watch this.  It was awesome and my love of scary movies has since grown.  Poltergeist is nostalgic for sure and brings memories of simpler times when you didn't need gore and blood.  You just needed everyday objects to do weird supernatural things.  That is more relate-able and therefore more creepy!  For example, it seems like everyone has clown issues or are scared of clowns.  It is because of this movie which is also responsible for the decline in enrollments for clown school.  There is no more dead space on tv where you are left with white noise.  Again, due to Poltergeist.  No one wants to risk demonic spirits entering the house all because someone innocently fell asleep watching the tv.  We just don't take those kind of chances anymore.

The acting is still great in this movie!  Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams are awesome!  Heather O'Rourke was so cute, may she rest in peace.  Best of all is the little psychic lady with the high pitched voice.  That was some brilliant casting right there.

All around a 5 star movie!  I can't wait till my daughter is old enough to watch this movie.  She is nine and I think this is still way too scary for kids.",1459814400,,1541,4.425

139263,5,0792833201,Love this movie. Great acting and story. I've seen in other reviews where people are complaining about the special effects. This movie WAS made in 1982. Not sure if these other reviewers realize that. For a movie made in 1982 these special effects are great. Too many movies these days rely too much on CGI and not enough on story. Either way the new remake doesn't hold a candle to this version and actually makes you appreciate this one even more. Jo Beth Williams and Craig T. Nelson are great at playing a happily married couple who love each other and their children very much. Zelda Rubinstein is amazing. There is plenty of substance to the story and you can feel the familial bond between the characters. Will always highly recommend this movie.,1457481600,,753,4.669172932330827
139264,2,0792833201,"The film is a standard classic in the horror genre and has Spielberg's mark on it in so many ways (even though he did the screenplay and served as producer, but not as director.)  It is an important classic for the contemporary era.

This DVD release however, has some of the worst extras imaginable - documentary of a a hoard of moronic spiritualists and paranormal ""researchers"" making preposterous claims about the existence of hauntings and poltergeists.  Pure and utter nonsense.  Nothing on the making of the film, the screen, Spielberg's interactions with the director, details about how the special effects were achieved ... not even an old trailer.",1457481600,,657,5.055555555555555
139265,5,0792833201,"Before we begin tonights review, I want to tell you all a fun story. I have a ten year old nephew, that I've watched many a horror movie with. We have sat through gore-fest after bloodbath, and he has been entertained but unfazed. After we watched this however, he didn't want to come back to my apartment for the next few weeks, because he was too afraid. He still refuses to watch it again. This was two years ago.
Without trying to make myself sound as old as I am, I will never stop arguing that the seventies/eighties were the golden age of horror. Yes, there were terrible movies, but there were so many great ones to choose from, and even the bad ones were fun and loveable (mostly). Which brings me back to Poltergeist.  Originally released in 1982, this movie had something to scare everyone, and it did so at a PG rating.
I will repeat that. This movie is rated PG.
It is one thousand percent scarier than the 2015 remake, and even that got a PG-13.
This is partially because it was directed by one of the greatest horror icons that ever lived, Tobe Hooper, because Steven Spielberg, who wrote it, was contractually forbidden from directing another movie during the filming of E.T., and everyone was impressed with what Tobe did with America's favorite chainsaw wielding maniac.
The story goes like this...
The Freeling family lives in a suburban community that was built by the real estate company that Steven Freeling (Craig T. Nelson) works for. One night, the youngest daughter, Carol Anne is found conversing with a television that is displaying only static. The next night, she again makes her way to the television, but this time an apparition in the shape of a hand appears, curls around the room, and disappears into the wall. This signals an earthquake that only affects their house, and Carol Anne calmly states one of the most famous lines in horror history, ""They're here"".
The next day, Diane (JoBeth Williams) begins to notice unusual activity in the house. Chairs move, silverware is bent, and the family dog barks insessantly at the spot in the wall where the apparition disappeared. When Steven gets home, she shows him some of the new tricks, and instead of being freaked out, they are actually thrilled at the paranormal activity. That night however, the frivolity ends and the terror begins, the family is attacked, and Carol Anne is pulled into another dimension, but can still be heard calling from the television.
The family seeks the help of parapsychologists, who inform them that they aren't being haunted by a ghost, but by poltergeists. The parapsychologists then call in Tangina (Zelda Rubinstein, in one of my favorite roles in a horror film), to help find Carol Anne, and to clean the house.
Scare Factor 10/10 This movie is terrifying, and not only does it have ghostly scares, it hits a lot of different fears and it does then well.
You will look at gnarled trees differently, and you won't be able to look at clown dolls in the same way ever again.
Seriously, to hell with that clown doll.
The special effects still look amazing, even after thirty four years, and this is something that most digital effects will never achieve.
Even with all of this inspiring fear, the biggest terror is from the feeling of hopelessness when confronted by insurmountable problems. When escape is not an option, and it seems like you and your family will never be safe again, and the film presents this beautifully.
Gore 2/10 I'll say it again. This movie is rated PG. That is not to say the movie is not without its moments of gore. The entire scene that starts with the steak crawling across the counter, and ends with one of the parapsychologists in a washroom is completely disturbing, and the pool scene is a lot of people's fear come true. To make things even more gruesome, due to lower costs, instead of using plastic skeletons, they used real medical supply skeletons, adding to the legend of the curse, which we will get to later.
Acting 10/10 This is not a B-movie, and these actors are of the highest caliber. When the ghost attacks begin, Steven actually looks like like a man that hasn't slept in days. The emotions are actually felt, the fear, the sadness and the love for the family. Special attention should be paid to Zelda Rubinstein.  From the moment she enters the movie, despite her small stature, she is nothing but personality, and you can't help but to love her immediately.
For a bonus, look for James Karen (who we all loved in The Return of the Living Dead) in the role of Stevens boss, who is the one that unknowingly cracks the entire mystery (I won't give anything away, but it's all the fault of corperate greed.)
Recommended 10/10 This movie is a staple of great horror, and no matter how many times you watch it, you'll notice something new to admire. When I was sixteen, I worked in a video rental store, and we were only allowed to watch PG rated movies (Have I mentioned this movie is rated PG?), so being the lover of all things horror that I am, I abused their rule and watched this movie repeatedly. It was watched at least once every shift I worked, and while everyone else grew tired of the repeated viewings, I never got bored with it. If you haven't seen it, go do so tonight, just make sure there are no clown dolls nearby.
I said earlier that I would talk about the curse. While many horror films are said to have a cursed production, there are none as famous as this as the Poltergeist series curse.
Dominique Dunne, who plays the oldest daughter Dana, was strangled by her boyfriend and left for dead in a driveway. She went into a coma and died five days later at the age of 22.
Two of the actors from Poltergeist 2, Will Sampson and Julian Beck (who is the scariest horror villian of all time, but we will discuss this later), both died within two years of the movies release. Julian Beck actually died before the movie was released, but from stomach cancer which he was diagnosed with before filming began.
In the most discussed reason for believing the curse, actress Heather O'Rourke, who played Carol Anne, died at age 12 from cardiac arrest and septic shock caused by congenital stenosis. She dies shortly after the filming was complete for Poltergeist 3, and the film was dedicated to her memory.",1457308800,,6280,4.631390134529148

139270,3,0792833201,"Poltergeist may have been based on the childhood fears of Steven Spielberg, but those fears (of clowns and of being watched by tv entities) fail to translate into a truly frightening horror film. We see demons operating through a TV set, kitchen chairs suddenly assembling themselves into a balancing act, and trees supposedly attacking a child through a window, but what exactly do its viewers have to fear?

The few ghosts who make appearances are no more horrifying than an Iron Maiden album cover. One scene depicts corpses rising up from a burial ground, but only best resemble a crop of display dummies from a mall Halloween shop. The three most suspenseful scenes destined to be the spookiest, rapidly turn into letdowns. Children who watch Poltergeist may want to go to bed with the lights on, but as far as the horror genre goes, all that this movie can muster is an aura of moderate spookiness. The cast reacts naturally towards the paranormal occurrences in the first half of the movie, but when the special effects take over, it seems as if each scene is desperately trying to outdo the one that came before. By this point, the film has crossed over into something absurd rather than frightening. The cast do what they can, but can't keep up with the effects to save this film from being reduced to a small glob of ectoplasm.",1456617600,2,1337,4.713675213675214

139465,5,0792833201,"Few haunted house movies can hold a candle to Poltergeist. Other haunted house movies: it's time for your baby food! Poltergeists' extraordinary special effects - at first it's sprinkled ever so delicately with curiosity. Then SLAM! insanity all at once, everywhere! With unpresidented applications ideas of terror in such a variety and unrelenting speed. The whole movie just torments the viewer with the question 'what else could they do, what's next?' Then! Next comes! In a somersaulting climax of insane proportion, with scary ideas and effects that keep coming. If you have never seen this you will think 'holy s**t!' I'll bet the house chip on that.
The effects are accompanied with accomplished acting, that's convincing. The anguish the actors display subjected to this demon spirit! It disturbed me. Along with the effects; It's punishing to the senses!
The soundtrack and score are also very deep.
It begins with a soft dancing lulabye kind of feel that's romantic, forgiving, loving. A ballerina music box like a jawbreaker that never goes away. Then it drop kicks your ass, with a winding, uncomfortable, storm feeling of tumultuous symphonic psychotic possession!
You just want to go in and say 'get the f*** out of here!'

139467,5,0792833201,"I absolutely adore this movie. Not only does it bring back good memories as a teenager, I also liked Heather in this movie. It is very sad she died at the age of 12 in Feb. 1988. Had she lived, I think she would have had more acting roles, if she wanted them.
For me growing up as a teen in the '80s, it was a nice time in my life. Being 16 in Nov. 1982, I saw this for the first time on cable TV, which was a new thing in those years. So, I really never got to see it in the theater or as a ""widescreen"" movie until later on when DVDs first started to come out.
This edition has definitely cleaned it up as it probably has never looked this good since it's debut in the theater. The sound and picture quality are fantastic, even for DVD format. I watched this on a 60 inch Samsung LED TV with 3D surround sound. The extra features they added to this are ok, but could have been better. Come on WB! This is the 25th Anniversary, can you please make an attempt to at least bring over some of the features from the Laserdisc and the Theatrical Trailer? Although I rank this movie a classic in my book with fond remembrances, the special features could have been much better.
WB, MGM, and MIRAMAX are apparently going down in Blu-ray history for making skimpy bare bones discs with little or no extras on them. MGM being the worst as some Blu-rays don't even have a freaking menu.
Paramount and Fox are the leaders in this format, for me anyway. I own at least 500 Blu-rays as of this writing. I have still a few hundred DVDs, some not worth an upgrade, but most I have replaced as far superior editions.
As quality of the film and sound itself, a definite improvement here over previous editions. 5 stars.  I think we can all agree on that, but to put out a 25th Anniversary with a few ""poltergeist"" doctors features, it doesn't do this edition justice for overall acceptance of the movie's fans. GET IT RIGHT WB!

Perhaps in the future, we can get a nice package with ALL movies and added features together in one box set which would include the Theatrical Trailers!  The added features already exist, plus they can make some new ones with Craig T. and JoBeth Williams discussing the making of the movie. I am sure they would love to do it.
Heck, if Barbara Steele (Queen of Gothic Horror) can come and do one on several of her movies and career, surely they can.

139468,5,0792833201,"Poltergeist begins with an opening you could stand up and salute...........if it wasn't for those pesky ghosts and an overly inquisitive TV set.
Cuesta Verde is a quiet neighborhood of tract homes (little boxes on the hillside, little boxes made of ticky tacky).
Then poor Tweetie dies and all hell breaks out, followed by a storm (there's always a storm in horror movies).  While the parents smoke pot, their son is traumatized by the sight of a clown doll.  Seriously, who would buy a toy for a kid who's clearly afraid of it!?!  The poor kid also has tree issues.  ""It looks at me.  It knows I live here.""  Meanwhile, their daughter is making new friends.............with the TV people.  A fork bends, a glass breaks, the chairs perform acrobatic routines.  Phase one of Cuesta Verde has a dark secret, beware what lies below.

A classic ghost story (whoever directed it), great fun, more creepy than scary.  Beatrice Straight and Zelda Rubinstein lend an air of sophistication to all the typical jump-scares.

I had a fun time watching it the other night picking out all the iconic 80's stuff I saw throughout the movie...like the toys in the children's' rooms, certain books that were being read in the move by the cast. But aside from that...this was the first movie that really gave me the creeps as a kid growing up in the 80's...and I don't scare easily.

139489,3,0792833201,"If you enjoy the 80's, horror, camp and old special effects, then you will love this film!  I was a kid in the 80's so everything about Poltergeist is familiar to me.  The clothing, the old clunky remote controls, the attitude of expansion at any cost.  Oh, wait.  I guess that's still happening.

Anyway, Jo Beth Williams and Craig T. Nelson are great in this film.  They have real chemistry.  You believe they love each other and are a team.  The kids are pretty great, too.

If you are seeing it for the first time, or if you haven't watched a lot of old films with special effects like Raiders of the Lost Arc,etc,  it will seem cheesy to you.  It's well before the CGI stuff of today.  But, try to relax, enjoy it for what it is and laugh at the stuff that is silly.

139717,5,0792833201,A classic movie that still holds up today.,1434412800,,42,4.375
139718,4,0792833201,"I'm of a somewhat skeptical mind about the movie ""Poltergeist.""  It's a fun film, an entertaining film, an occasionally frightening film, but it shouldn't be a film by which to judge real-life parapsychologists (or poltergeists and hauntings, if you believe in such things).  ""Poltergeist"" is Hollywood, after all, with typically Hollywood ghosts and typically Hollywood exaggeration.  Heaven help us if such demons as the ones depicted in this movie actually frequented our homes.

Now, here's the thing:  Co-writer and producer Steven Spielberg and director Tobe Hooper (""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"") wanted to do something a little different in the way of a ghost story.  Rather than setting it in a conventional haunted house, they decided to place their tale in a tranquil Southern California housing tract, with a tranquil, almost fairy-tale musical score by Jerry Goldsmith.  Their idea was to show how spirits of the dead can exist anywhere, even where you least expect them.  Of course, Spielberg was riding high at the time, having already made ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" and he probably would have directed ""Poltergeist,"" too, if he hadn't been working on ""E.T."" the same year.  As it was, Spielberg probably did more than just write, produce, and edit the film.  He probably gave Hooper a good deal of advice in managing it as well, hearsay indicating that he directed a few scenes himself.  In any case, ""Poltergeist"" shows all the signs of a Spielberg picture, from the happy family to the ""lost"" kid to the elaborately exaggerated special effects.

So, what's a ""poltergeist""?  My Random House Dictionary defines it as ""a ghost or spirit supposed to manifest its presence by noises, knockings, etc.""  But that's something of a misnomer in the case of this movie because what we have in ""Poltergeist"" is a full-fledged haunting, something the movie's characters even mention.

The family involved are the Freelings:  Dad Steve (Craig T. Nelson), who sells houses in the fictional Cuesta Verde housing track; Diane (JoBeth Williams), his wife; Dana (Dominque Dunne), their teenage daughter; Robbie (Oliver Robins), their eight-year-old son; and Carol Anne (Heather O'Roarke), their five-year-old daughter, the only one in the family who can hear the spirits living with them.  A trivia footnote is that two of the three actors playing the children died relatively shortly after making the movie, Dunne strangled by an ex-boyfriend the year of the movie's release and O'Roarke a few years later of an intestinal inflammation.

In the story, the first indications we get that things aren't all they appear is when we see a monster tree outside Carol Anne and Robbie's window and a clown doll in their bedroom that would scare the bejabbers out of anyone, child or adult.  When the poltergeist (or spirit) shows up, the Freelings think it's kinda fun.  The spirit rearranges furniture and moves objects across the kitchen floor.  Things soon turn bad, however, when the tree tries to eat the boy, and the spirit inside the house kidnaps the little girl, taking her into some other dimension.

And what do the Freelings do when these horrifying incidents occur?  Do they go to the police like sensible, responsible parents?  Nope.  They call in parapsychologists from the local university (no offense, Loyd), a team headed by Dr. Lesh (Beatrice Straight), who soon discover they're in over their heads.  Consequently, Dr. Lesh calls in a psychic, Tangina (diminutive Zelda Rubinstein), to exorcise the demons in the house.

Although most of us are quite familiar with the film, another good friend of mine had never seen it until a month or two before this writing.  He rented it on DVD and was sorely disappointed.  He thought it was the dumbest film he'd seen in years.  Maybe you had to have grown up with it; I dunno.  ""Poltergeist"" does get rather preposterous, with hyperbole the order of the day.  Spielberg's ghosts don't just do a few spooky things; they literally turn the Freeling house into a demonic hell.  Well, if you've seen the movie, you know what I mean.

Spielberg and Hooper seem determined to create a blockbuster more than merely scare an audience.  There are a couple of creepy scenes, to be sure, like when the clown doll crawls under Robbie's bed.  But most of the time, the movie contents itself with fancy special effects--a multitude of objects flying through the air, monstrous heads appearing in doorways, gigantic light displays, and a finale in which the filmmakers pull out all the stops and go for a huge pyrotechnic finish.

I have to admit the movie has never frightened me.  Not when the Wife-O-Meter and I saw it in a theater on opening night, not later on tape and DVD, and not now.  Nonetheless, I have always enjoyed its humor (""Mosquito ever suck on you, son?""), its characters (""Y'all mind hanging back? You're jamming my frequency""), its flamboyant attitude, and its disregard for tradition.  Think of it more as a fun-ride than a horror movie, and you'll get more out of it.

Video:
The movie's colors are intensely deep and rich, with strong black levels to set them off.  Some viewers will find this image extremely attractive, while others, like myself, will find it more extreme than real life.  When I look out my window, these are not the colors I see.  What I see looks more subdued.  Anyway, that concern aside, the video quality is quite good, the Warners engineers using a VC-1 video codec and a single-layer BD25 to reproduce the movie's 2.40:1 ratio picture.  Would the engineers have been able to use a higher bit rate on a BD50?  I don't know.  VC-1 is a pretty efficient tool, so a single layer may have been all that was necessary for the best possible video.  Still, whenever I see a single-layer disc, I have to wonder about PR at the very least.  People feel more reassured when they think they're getting the best.

In any case, Warner Bros. tell us on the packaging that this is a ""new digital transfer from regenerated picture elements.""  The ""regenerated"" term is new to me, but I kind of think it means they restored all or part of the movie.  The colors are deep, as I've said; a natural film grain provides a realistic texture; and definition is usually sharp, although there are also some stretches of softness.  On my television, Venetian blinds showed a degree of shimmer, which was oddly distracting in otherwise so pristine a print.

Audio:
The disc offers English audio in Dolby TrueHD 5.1, Dolby Digital 5.1, and Dolby Digital 2.0.  Note, however, that if you are going to listen in TrueHD, you'll have to select it from the menu, as the default is regular DD 5.1.  The TrueHD has a slightly lower overall volume level than the other tracks, perhaps due to its slightly wider dynamic range, so you may also have to turn your gain up a bit more than usual.  Once selected and adjusted, the TrueHD supplies wide dynamics, an ample frequency range, and strong impact.  The midrange is mostly smooth, with occasional lapses into nasality.  Additionally, you'll find a broad front-channel stereo spread and, from time to time, an impressive rear-channel response.  While the movie may not exhibit current state-of-the-art audio, it's the best we've heard from this particular movie, maybe ever.

Extras:
The disc's primary extra is a two-part documentary made in 2007, ""They Are Here:  The Real World of Poltergeists Revealed,"" totaling about thirty-one minutes.  Part one, ""Science of the Spirits,"" contains comments by various psychic investigators and ghost hunters on how science tries to find answers to paranormal phenomena.  Part two, ""Communing with the Dead,"" is more of the same, with an emphasis on the question of whether there is life beyond this existence.  It doesn't seem to occur to any of them that almost every religion in the world for the past 5,000 years has believed in an afterlife.

The next important bonus is having the disc packaged in one of WB's Digibooks, a hardbound, glossy-covered, book-like affair with some forty-four pages of color pictures and text information on the film.  OK, personally, I'd rather see the studio spend their Digibook money on dual-layer BD50s and possibly higher bit rates than on pictures and text that I may never look at again, but that's just me.  The extras conclude with thirty scene selections; English, French, Spanish, German, and Italian spoken languages; English, French, Spanish, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, German, Italian, Korean, Norwegian, Portuguese, and Swedish subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Parting Thoughts:
""Poltergeist"" is more of an extravaganza than it is a horror flick.  It's certainly not a traditional ghost story, which is more to the point.  Spielberg and Hooper wanted to do something similar to what ""Rosemary's Baby"" had done some years earlier; that is, show that demons can exist anywhere, not just in old, spooky mansions but in downtown apartment buildings or peaceful suburban housing tracks.  In this regard, ""Poltergeist"" works, and the filmmakers bring their usual flair to the proceedings.  It's just that the more I watch it, the sillier a lot of it looks.  Oh, well, it's still a good amusement-park ride toward the end, which is the main thing, I suppose.

There is no cause for concern. But is it? Literally from the first frame we understand that the house is something abnormal.

The mixture of both comedy and spookiness was perfect. Even watching it today over 30 years later I think the effects still stand the test of time. A lot of the fears that were used through out this film certainly are still the fears kids have today and even some adults. I just hope the remake is as good as the original one as I love scary movies and so much of what is being put out today isn't worth watching.,1426636800,,578,4.078947368421052

This film is about what the name suggests and how such a haunting effects the lives of one family of five.  My favorite actresses are JoBeth Williams who plays Diane, the mother of Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke) the adorable 5 year old little girl who's the star of the film.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates the classic horror films' unique quality of the 70's and 80's which can no longer be found in horror films we see today.",1426291200,,625,4.456140350877193

This early work marks him as an early found footage groundlayer with his Freeling family being as close to a real family as you can get. Messy homes, talking over each other, sexually active parents, pot smoking behind closed doors, kids chasing each other. Beautiful and brilliant. Notice how in recent films all families are picture perfect and the homes immaculate? Kind of takes away from reality and therefore the fear.

139898,5,0792833201,i love this movie very much but i believe it is very wrong to do a recreation of the movie. Changing character names from carolanne to maggie. this harms the franchise very much. I enjoy the originals very much due to the factor the main lead role actress Heather O'rourke stared in every poltergeist. It is sad that she died but as in memory of her i believe making a remake isn't doing justice but we will see what the new version looks like. can the actress of the new poltergeist try and beat her double ganger the late great Heather O'rourke we shall see very soon.,1423785600,,570,4.336448598130841

Granted, its dated, but what made it great then, still has some pull.  However, I was disappointed in the Blu-ray version of this movie.  Something about the sound and even the film quality seemed lacking.  Honestly,  do not know if it is the time gap, transfer, quality versus now, or the format of the original film footage.  Not sure it will hold the same weight it did back in the day, but my kids enjoyed - even with the special effects spectacles of now.  Granted, I have to put a comment on the re-do coming out ... hope they can bring out the same characteristics of the original to grab audiences of the old and new release.

139950,5,0792833201,"A teen in our household wanted permission to watch a really scary movie for Halloween. Most horror movies are sexually explicit or violent to the point of being sick. We cannot keep this fast maturing young person from harsher movies much longer without soon transgressing from parenting to censoring, but we wanted one more year ... just one more year that is a little closer to childhood than adulthood. This movie let us have that while making our teen quite happy. This kid went from ""What!?! It's not even rated R? That's so unfair!"" To ""Okay, you were right. That really scared [sibling]. I mean, it didn't scare me, but ... Our house is not built on a graveyard is it?"" It's scary, but fun-scary. You can't beat that.",1416873600,,724,4.62015503875969

This horror movie stands the test of time.  Spooky to this day.  It even has a sad or touching moment depending on how you look at it, when the mom feels her daughters spirit run through her on the stairs.  It can tear you up if you have kids.  The movie has some iconic film moments too, the clown toy scene, the woman cleansing the house, and the music score - unforgettable. That is why I will watch this movie again.

This is a 13 and up film, language is not great for and the mom and dad smoking weed in their bed room is unnecessary. The intense scenes are still good and some make you smile at how they are set up.

139980,5,0792833201,"As we ramp up here to Halloween 2014, I've been going back and showing my kids some of the horror films I grew up on; ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Halloween"", ""Halloween 2"", ""Friday the 13th III"", ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", ""Black Christmas"" and ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"".

Not sure why the 7 year old wakes up screaming lately??

Just kidding, both are teenagers, and with stuff like ""The Walking Dead"" and ""Criminal Minds"" on TV, they have access to stuff a lot gorier than those 70's & 80's classics. With that said, I was curious to see if they would like ""Poltergeist""? In this world of ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""The Conjuring"", would ""Poltergeist"" seem dull, and the F/X goofy? ""Poltergeist"" is a film that truly scared me as a kid, and it's been a few decades since my last visit with Carol Anne and family, so I was looking forward to re-visiting the film.

The movie immediately dates itself by showing the family snoozing as the TV stations ends it's broadcast day. )Wow, did that bring back memories?!) As soon as the picture fades and the electric snow begins we hear these ominous whispers coming from the screen. Carol Anne, the youngest daughter in the Freeling family, begins to talk to the static, carrying on a one-sided conversation while her parents' look on. The following night the same thing occurs, only this time something comes out of the TV, and jumps into the wall above the parents' bed. Carol Anne turns to her parents' and says the famous phrase ""They're Here"", and indeed ""they"" are.

As storylines go, this one is a pretty basic haunted house tale. And so many of this film's aspects have been ripped off over the past couple of decades, that this film may look familiar to you, even if you haven't seen it before. With that said, there is a style to ""Poltergeist"" that you just don't see anymore. Credit Tobe Hooper or Steven Speilberg, but the look of the film, and way it's shot gives this film such a feel and a unique look, that it still seems new and fresh today. The scares are also earned here, there are no phony jump scares or music suddenly blaring to get a cheap thrill.

There is suspense, and chills galore, but there are also a lot of laughs found here. The Freelings come off as a real family, and the casting is perfect. These actors play so well off each other, that you really buy the whole family dynamic. The special F/X, particularly the strange and wonderful lighting used in the film, hold up and add to the film's atmosphere. Both of my kids loved the movie, and I don't think I'll wait so long to revisit this spooky little development in Cuesta Verde next time.",1413936000,,2622,4.558386411889597
139981,4,0792833201,it's a classic,1413849600,,14,4.0
139982,5,0792833201,"The Freelings live in Cuesta Verde, a planned community created by Steve's company. Diane is a housewife who takes care of her children Dana, Robbie, and Carol Anne. One day, objects just start moving by themselves in the family's kitchen. The family is delighted at first until a tree tries to kill their son and their daughter is missing. The Freelings employ the help of parapsychologists to get their daughter back. Who are these spirits and why do they want Carol Anne?

Poltergeist is the haunted house movie that I measure all others against. Very few have reached even close to its achievement, so I'm not a huge fan of most of them. Poltergeist, although made in 1982, isn't as predictable and steeped in tropes as many much newer films like The Conjuring or Insidious. So many of the scares come from out of nowhere: the tree almost eating the little boy, the face scene, and the ending (including that creepy clown and the spreading of the haunting to the entire neighborhood). The suspense is expertly sustained throughout the film and actually has occasional significant scares to justify the high suspense level (again, unlike many recent films). The practical effects have held up well over the years. So many moments are equally creepy to child me and adult me. I still can't believe the film is rated PG because I had so many nightmares as a kid and it is still a very memorable and scary film.

One of the main strengths of the film is the family. They have to be sympathetic or the plot just wouldn't work. The beginning establishes them as a normal, everyday family. They disagree and fight, but ultimately love each other. The happenings at the beginning start out as fun family events. Chairs and children are slid across the floor by some unseen force and it's all fun and games until Carol Anne, the angelic looking 5 year old, goes missing. The family stays united even as they mourn for their lost member. Their pain is poignant and the viewer can't help but feel for them. The scene where the parapsychologists first come to the house is perfectly performed. The family hears Carol Anne running from something and she ends up running through her mother, who breaks down with emotion because it's the first physical contact she's had since her child has been gone. JoBeth Williams is amazing and I can't watch the scene without crying. Heather O'Rourke isn't the best child actor, but her delivery of the line ""They're here"" will live on in horror movie history forever. Craig T. Nelson as Steve is more skeptical than his wife, but no less caring about his daughter. I like that Poltergeist takes the time to get to know the family because if we don't care about them, the film falls flat.

The ending is wholly unexpected. After rescuing Carol Anne, the house should be clean, but the spirits return with a vengeance, exposing the dead buried under the neighborhood. It's just another example of a corporation making shortcuts in their business and allowing the public to face the repercussions while they reap the profits. The company was surveying another cemetery earlier in the film, showing active planning to build another community without moving the dead. This theme has been in film for a long time and is still quite relevant today.

Poltergeist is the perfect haunted house film. It avoids a lot of common tropes and proves to stand the test of time. I was on the edge of my seat the entire film and it felt that anything could happen at any time. I love this movie and will definitely revisit it for years to come.",1413590400,,3554,4.69983948635634

140001,5,0792833201,"I've never seen the movie in its entirety, so I'd like to thank Amazon.com for the opportunity to see it. :) Steven Spielberg is a master storyteller. Most of his movies are about ordinary people, living ordinary lives who end up in extraordinary circumstances and this movie was certainly no exception. Just as brilliant as his storytelling, Spielberg utilizes everyday objects and turns them into sinister catalysts. I may never look at my TV the same way again! The movie isn't just about nasty things that move objects and make noises. It confronts the audience with a subtle wink of the eye; it's not a good wink, but the type that you know something is off-center. Of course, the viewer knows something is off-center; it's a thriller. But Spielberg treats the audience to something more than a run-of-the-mill haunted house. There are well-established characters and the ocasional funny moment. Then just when you think the movie is running through the regular course like many others before it (there's something here. I'm scared. I need to change my panties, let's get out of here), he twists the plot and shoves you straight into the rabbit hole. The rabbit hole drags you into a black hole and you don't know if you'll come out in one piece-if at all.
I don't like slash-and-gash films. That's gross, not scary. This film attempts only to send chills down your back and to keep your TV off for a few days.

140032,5,0792833201,"I love this movie for its warmth, tender emotions, good scares, and perhaps the best screenplay Steven Spielberg ever wrote. Performances are soaring. JoBeth WIlliams does her finest work, portraying both love and discomfort with a soul-transparency that is gripping. Author/activist/actor Zelda Rubinstein likewise turns in a controlled, authoritative performance. Of course, Jerry Goldsmith's score is magnificent. So is it worth upgrading to Blu-ray from DVD?

Without hesitation, yes. I've seen this film probably 15 times, had the VHS, then the DVD. But the Blu-ray knocks out of the park. On my 46"" Samsung screen, it was like the first time I saw it in the theatre. I cannot overstate the presence or the quality of the transfer. It was an act of love and artistry.

DGA records Tobe Hooper as the director of this film, and the controversy lingers. The end is pure Hooper, wildly funny excess, shocks, extreme closeups of faces in terror. But the best of the film is vintage Spielberg: the lighting, the looks of awe as the camera moves in or out.

140073,4,0792833201,"If you've grown up with the film fantasies of Steven Spielberg (read: do you own a television and watch it often?), then you might still be capable of feeling that special pulse of terror that runs throughout the illogical, convoluted, crazy, slam-bang, and clearly operatic ""Poltergeist"". Yes, it's true, this is not so much story, but it is a lot of roller-coaster--if you are scared of the idea of ghosts, then ""Poltergeist"" is probably not for you! The performances are good, but aren't really meant to be as deep as all that. As to the other reviewers on here who are saying that this is not a 'horror' movie, I think it very much is a supernatural thriller (so it all depends upon what you include under the 'horror' umbrella), although it obviously isn't a stupid blood and death film either. SPOILER ALERT: I think the whole point of ""Poltergeist"" is that no one dies or gets hurt by the end yet the entire movie is ABOUT the threat of death. That, to me, is a pretty intense 'horror' idea. I initially thought ""Poltergeist"" was going to be a comic-book idea and only moderately frightening, but it really is scary; I had the worry that it might be too much like ""E. T."" but it is most definitely the dark shadow of that movie. It is an illogical story, and it has the Spielberg feel to it, but it's an amazing seizure-inducing light and effects show nonetheless.
The picture on the DVD is fantastic, as well as the sound--you really have to watch it in the dark with the sound cranked, or otherwise there's no point. It is a pretty dark film, and that element still works I think. I have not witnessed any of the sequels to this, but the original was more frightening--and more surprising--than I expected going in to it. B",1391385600,,1732,4.519108280254777

Horror movies have suspense, grizzly murders, gratuitous blood -- I will even give it up for creeping dread (a la The Woman in Black). Poltergeist is exactly what it promises to be- the Steven Spielberg of horror. It's saccharine, overacted (dated might be a better word) and it is dependent on a Deus ex Machina (brilliant Zelda Rubenstien) and no one in this movie learns a lesson or changes their character as a result of the trials of the story. Everyone is a victim of circumstance. Heather O'Rourke stares off camera and parrots lines like a ventriloquist dummy.

140092,4,0792833201,"Sometimes to judge a film fairly you really need to consider the time at which it was made and what film-making technology existed at that time. I was there, I saw it in the theaters, and I remember.  This was the first big budget film to really tackle the subject of paranormal investigation, and at the time it was made it was seamless and sleek.  It would be easy for people today to put it down for some of the early 1980's effects, but let's flip this perspective around and consider that no CGI whatsoever was used; it wasn't there for them to even consider. This film was made purely by models and camera work and stop-motion and exuberance. It also managed to be bold, what with Mom being a pot smoker, which really went on and was very common at the time.  And yet that didn't make her a bad mom at all! In fact, she was portrayed as an awesome mom!

The captured shadows of Mulder and Skully a decade before The X-Files aired. It as one of Spielberg's very few explorations of the supernatural.  And for those people out there who personally stared into the abyss... those who had really survived paranormal experiences... this was the first film to almost acknowledge that they weren't alone or crazy. None of those people ask for it to happen and none of them enjoy it. It is like a dark and awful and terrible intruder, ransacking their lives, just like the family in the film. While the film does go over the top with trees grabbing children from their beds and getting sucked into televisions it also presents certain very true-to-life elements, such as the paranormal investigators and the way the events left permanent marks on everyone involved. The family's perspectives on certain every day things was forever altered, such as their aversion to televisions. All in all this is a very entertaining film that managed to contain several bits of truth about a subject that up until then was considered goofy to even bring up. For many it was a great introduction to a larger and more mysterious world.",1389139200,,2017,4.591666666666667

The main family is just like any other family and that's pretty much all you know. I don't think I even heard any of them called by name until about 30 minutes in. I know that's not the point of a movie like this but things like that bug me now, even though they didn't used to. Plus the kids often disappear for lengths of time. It seemed like they never wanted all three together in a scene if possible. The funniest part is how the old construction guys treat the oldest daughter. And after adding up everything you learn about her, she is kind of a ho, lol. Her comment about knowing the hotel they're staying at was hilarious.",1389139200,,901,4.2748538011695905

140160,4,0792833201,"Poltergeist is, perhaps, one of the best horror films ever made about a haunted house in California.  Now, while the movie was made in California, people better look into the real past of what made the movie come about.  If you really want to hear the true story behind the motion picture, then look to a little town called Black Hope, Texas, and there you'll find some of the ideas that movie maker Steven Spielberg used to make this wonderful horror movie.  The special effects in this movie are by far the best I've ever seen for a motion picture!  But there's one thing lacking on the extras menu: the original movie trailer from 1982.  The trailer was very well done and I've tried to find a true copy of it on YouTube, but with limited success.  All the same, this movie, along with the sequel: ""Poltergeist II: The Other Side"" are the only ones that really had any meat on the bones--the third movie was ridiculous beyond anything imaginable.  The special effects were poorly done, in my opinion, and the movies could've ended with just ""Poltergeist II: The Other Side"".  Now some might disagree with me on that, but that's okay, because that's why we have our own opinions.

Dominique Dunne who played Dana in the film was tragically murdered by her Boyfriend some months after the film was released in Theaters 1982
will still be remembered whenever i think of or watch Poltergeist
and the same with Heather O Rourke-Carol anne who died tragically just few weeks after Poltergeist 3 was released in Theaters
so this classic will never Die and always will be remembered in years to come

i read on wikipedia that During filming that Tobe Hooper and Steven spielberg had lot of arguments about how certain scenes should be directed
and that Craig T nelson and Jobeth williams had a Difficult time of which Person to take Direction from
Tobe Hooper takes all the credit for the Director of the film ofcourse
even thou Steven spielberg was Exect producer on the film he still had alot of Ideas of how certain scenes should be Directed
at the same time that Poltergeist was being filmed steven was also Directing E.T.
and therefor Tobe Hooper and Steven spielberg clashed styles and then some scenes Steven directed and other scenes Tobe Directed
so it's just what i read i don't know if it's true or not.

this POLTERGEIST 25th ANNIVERSARY DELUXE EDITION BLU-RAY BOOK is the best version any fan will get of the film
the picture and audio has been given a HD transfer and it looks fantastic in Widescreen
the Audio quality has been given a HD upgrade aswell so the sound quality is beautiful
much better than the DVD release from 2006

the pages in this book tells the story of the making of Poltergeist and the Actors from the film aswell
the pages don't mention Tobe Hooper and Steven spielberg clashing styles at all
but it's very interesting reading
the special features are exactly the same as the 2006 DVD release
THEY'RE HERE-REAL WORLD OF POLTERGEISTS REVEALED which is a short featurette with Psyhcics and Paranormal researches explaining Poltergeists
there's no interviews with Craig T Nelson or Jobeth williams
and SCIENCE OF THE SPIRITS/COMMUNING WITH THE DEAD which is another featurette with Psyhcics
it would've been Great if Craig T nelson or Jobeth williams were interviewed atleast
or even get an interview with Steven spielberg or Tobe Hooper
but no, no interviews with the Actors or Director
this movie will make it's 35th Anniversary mark in 2016
so maybe warner bros will release another Blu-ray re-issue with a making of Documentary
with interviews of Craig T Nelson, Jobeth williams and steven spielberg but we can only Hope

but for now all fans will have to accept this 25th Anniversary blu-ray
so i gave this blu-ray 5 star rating cause of the amazing Picture and audio quality in High Definition.",1383350400,,2696,4.816414686825054

We let her watch Poltergeist one morning to see if she could make it through the whole movie. She made it and said it was a little freaky but didn't know what all the fuss was about.

140255,5,0792833201,"Well-done original ghost stories are among the best forms of horror. This is certainly one of those movies that demonstrated that there has always been that fear of the unknown but when it's in your house, after your children, it's always that more terrifying.

 We have geniouses behind this masterpiece. Stephen Spielberg as the director/producer has already proven he could build terror in Jaws and proves it again with this. Tobe Hooper (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) is the producer/director as well although there is some dispute over where to lend the credit. Spielberg actually wrote the story and screenplay himself, which surprised me a little as I always thought he was just the director for awhile.

 But enough with movie politics. Steve is a successful realtor, and with his wife Diane, daughter Carol Anne, teenager Dana, and son Robby, they all live in the Freeling house. A 2 story but not overly huge home in your typical suburban surroundings.

 Carol Anne is the main star and she's as cute as a button. We instantly fall in love with her. She is just too precious and it was a wide decision casting her as the focal point. The acting could NOT be improved upon. JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson really hold it together.

 At first when haunting incidents occure (accompanied with beautiful sound effects/music and perfect anything else) they're just exciting for the mother and daughter duo while they freak out the father. One night during a thunderstorm a tree comes to life, breaks through the childrens window, and grabs Robbie. Distracting the parents, Carol Anne is summoned to the TV, where she is sucked into a ghostly type of void.

 The family then goes through sheer hell to try and get her back - including hiring a quirky parapsychological ghostbuster Tangina.

 This movie has some really wierd parts like where the ghosts are filmed coming down the stairs or the toy clown from under the bed. And, just when you think it's alright in this movie, something else seems to happen.

 If I look deep enough I can uncover some minor faults. One is the boy. He's not the worst actor but he irritates me, especially the scene where he's freaking out about his sister in the TV. It's..irritating. But other than that, nothing much.

 Great ending, great beginning, great cast, great suspense, great plot all equal Poltergiest. A hell of a ghost movie that you should have seen by now. If not, shame on you!",1379635200,,2435,4.803357314148681

Spielberg let Hooper take the credit as director but seriously, if you've seen this movie then you know that it's a Spielberg film all the way. It's every bit as good as Raiders, E.T. Jaws and Close Encounters.
A friend of mine worked on Jurassic Park as a PA and got a lot of inside scuttle and one of the discussions was about Poltergeist and an inside long term Spielberg production crew member confirmed that this was a Steven Spielberg film in all but name.
And as far as I'm concerned it's a must buy for any Spielberg fan especially if you love his first 5-6 films more than any of the others.
And this Blu-ray looks magnificent. I've always loved this movie and the digibook is a great way to have this on the shelf, the other thing is just how wonderful and new the image is. I'm just waiting for 1941 and The Sugarland Express to be released on Blu-ray and the very best Spielberg films will all be out.

140288,3,0792833201,"Poltergeist was a fantastic film followed by two entertaining sequels. While the video and audio are great the extras are sadly lacking. The only featurette ever released by Warner Bros. was a 31-minute documentary ""They Are Here: The Real World of Poltergeists Revealed"" about real-life ghost hunters. In other words, this is a bare-bones release with no documentaries on the film, no deleted scenes and no director's commentary. There is so much to this film and franchise that hasn't been aired because of the issues over directing and the Poltergeist Curse. The vault is stuffed with Poltergeist material. Hopefully the 2014 remake will be followed by a beefed up special deluxe edition of the original masterpiece fully loaded with behind the scenes info.

I rate the film 5 stars and this release 3 stars. Buy this Blu-Ray for the film only. The studio has hinted for years at a deluxe edition but it has never been released. I know it was partially completed and then scrapped because copies of it still float around underground. A 3-disc Poltergeist Trilogy (soon to be quadrilogy) with 5 hours of supplements would be amazing.",1377129600,,1135,4.973684210526316

140324,5,0792833201,"Growing up, my family never played frightening movies. A few cartoons scared me as a child but this was my first real introduction into ""scary movies"". It definitely made an impact on me and my imagination!

When I was in middle school, my friend would throw Halloween Parties in a house that was apparently haunted. Before we went to sleep the first year she pulled out her Poltergeist DVD and informed us this was one of her favorites from her childhood.

The movie starts out illustrating a family who lives in an innocent suburb where nothing really ever happens. But the mood gradually starts to change as their daughter begins to make communication with ""tv people"" and eventually sucks her into their world. The transition between normal and different is done effectively and all of the main family character's acting is convincing, the mother's in particular. I was really moved by her crying for her daughter.

The next Halloween party was fun, we watched The Ring, but it didn't nearly have the impact that Poltergeist had on me. I am not sure if I can find the correct words to explain why but it is just so well executed and balanced between horror and humor. It just really made a connection with me.

It's not a classic, by any means, but it is a very good one without the off-putting horror shots (gore, heads being squished, bloody body parts being tossed around, etc.) which are accepted today. Both the leads do well individually and as a couple, while the two younger kids are guided to be quite satisfactory. The oldest child is pretty much left out of the action. Of the ""specialists in the supernatural"", Zelda Rubinstein, as the expert at house cleaning (of poltergeist), does quite well in her first film. She is gone now.
From the discussion of the guiding spirits for the film (see the editorial reviews and some of the others) clearly it must have been Spielberg who kept the lid on the horrors and the emphasis on the family and the familiar. If so, it was providential for the film since it is the difference between an audience of devotees and younger people and an audience of everybody.
At any rate, I commend the film to those who have not yet seen it. It has not aged at all, although lacking in the technological advances that people have come to expect. It is still a good people movie, the essence of longevity of appeal for an audience.",1367452800,2,1279,4.493562231759657

140398,4,0792833201,"Ever wonder where all the jokes about haunted buildings being built over old burial grounds came from? Well, it was ""Poltergeist.""

This was the movie that not only immortalized the ""They're heeeeeeere!"" line, but tapped into the spookiness of everyday things -- the closet, the underside of a bed, a staticky TV or a closed door. Some of the special effects are a bit dated, but it gives you the feeling of being a young child who genuinely believed that a hellmouth exists in your closet. Or was that just me?

The Freeling family lives the perfect suburban life. Steve (Craig T. Nelson) is a real-estate agent and Diane (JoBeth Williams) is a housewife; they have a lovely new home, a golden retriever and three kids -- teenage Dana (Dominique Dunne), Robbie (Oliver Robins) and barely-out-of-preschool Carol-Anne (Heather O'Rourke). All is lovely and well.

Then... weird things start happening. Chairs start moving by themselves. Specters whirl out of the TV. Earthquakes. Then a tree smashes its way into the house and abducts Robbie  -- and while his parents rescue him, Carol-Anne is sucked into a vortex in her bedroom closet. I swear to you, none of this is even slightly as funny as it sounds.

Now Carol-Anne is missing, and though her family can hear her occasionally, they have no idea where she is or how to find her. They call on a parapsychologist, Dr. Lesh (Beatrice Straight), who is totally out of her element. So she brings in an otherworldly psychic (Zelda Rubinstein), who may be their only hope of getting Carol-Anne back.

""Poltergeist"" is an odd movie. It's a genuinely horrifying, spooky movie that taps into a lot of primal fears that every child has -- scary trees, lightning, dark closets, things under beds, fizzing TVs in darkened rooms. The poltergeist activity is kind of cheesy-looking (A FLYING LAMP! SO SCARY!), but most of the things we see are genuinely disturbing, like a child almost getting eaten alive by a giant knotty tree.

It's also one of those movies wise enough to save a lot of the horror for the end -- while there are plenty of scary moments earlier on, the last fifteen minutes are a relentless onslaught of skeletons, mud, thunder, screaming and a grotesque gulping portal to ""the beast"" appearing in the wall.

But at the same time, ""Poltergeist"" has a strangely family-friendly vibe. It was directed by Tobe Hooper, but it has the unmistakeable fingerprints of producer/writer Steven Spielberg all over it. It focuses on an ordinary, harmless suburban family living their usual lives (their biggest problem is the death of a pet bird), which is suddenly thrown into chaos by outside forces. And unlike most horror movies, there isn't even a lot of violence... well, except for one grotesque hallucination.

The late Heather O'Rourke is best remembered now for her ""They're here"" line, but she actually gave a pretty decent performance -- she had the affected quality of a child actor, but she also had raw talent. The scene where she's shrieking at the ghosts to stop tormenting her is just chilling.

Nelson and Williams are excellent as the harried, increasingly terrified parents, as are Dunne and Robins as Carol-Anne's terrified siblings. You really feel that these people ARE a family, whatever annoying qualities they have, and that they will do anything to protect each other. And Zelda Rubenstein was just a lot of fun -- her childlike voice and quirkiness (""You're right. You go!"") are just charming.

""Poltergeist"" is the scariest family film I have ever seen -- a genuinely spooky ghost story that keeps amping up the horror. Definitely a good movie, but don't watch it during a thunderstorm... near your closet... with a clown doll.",1367020800,2,3702,4.9072

140439,5,0792833201,"""They're here!"" Steve Freeling and his family move in to a beautiful new neighborhood, only to find that their home is infested with evil spirits in the 1980's Horror classic POLTERGEIST! POLTERGEIST presents an image of the ideal American family turned upside down by the supernatural forces at work within their home, but one who manages to find strength in one another in order to overcome all obstacles. The film is perfectly cast as such, with JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson playing the loving, down-to-earth parents who live in a quiet California suburb with their three kids (and Golden Retriever, of course). We instantly relate to them because they are heartfelt and real, but also because they are imperfect just like the rest of us. These small town vibes can largely be attributed to the involvement of writer/producer Steven Spielberg, who has long been rumored to have taken over the director's chair while filming with TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE creator Tobe Hooper. Using state-of-the-art technology from Industrial Light and Magic, the spirits in POLTERGEIST were brought to life on screen unlike anything audiences had ever experienced in the past. The scares are softened by the film's light-hearted mood and Jerry Goldsmith's gentle score, making it enjoyable for all ages despite a few startling moments. Although her life was tragically cut short, POLTERGEIST will forever hold the legacy of Heather O'Rourke intact thanks to her endearing performance as Carol Anne Freeling, the family's youngest daughter. Carol Anne has since become one of the most recognizable characters within the genre, while POLTERGEIST is commonly cited as being one of the greatest Horror movies of all-time.

140468,5,0792833201,I have this on VHS as well. An absolute classic in my book. I'm a fan of Spielberg. I don't think there is a movie of his that I haven't liked.,1356998400,,143,3.6451612903225805
140469,5,0792833201,"Spielberg's stamp of sheer visual excellence and in the warmth and humor of the performances are all over this film.  Director Tobe Hooper (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Salem's Lot) lends his own scary sensibility.  It's a creative match made in heaven (and hell).

What elevates Poltergeist beyond a mere ghost story or horror thriller into a genuine love story is the believable performances by all the actors.  You really feel for the Freeling family, and feel their pain, when their youngest child, 5-year-old Carol Anne, played by Heather O'Rourke, is abducted by spirits, and you root for the Freelings, as they struggle to re-claim her from the forces of the netherworld!  This love, along with the love in the performances of the actors in Spielberg's other ""little"" summer of '82 movie, E.T., is palpably real.

It's amazing that parapsychologist Marty peeling his face off into the sink didn't garner this film an R rating!  It would be interesting to hear how producers Steven Spielberg and Frank Marshall ""negotiated"" a PG rating with the MPAA.  Tell your young kids to cover their eyes during this scene!

It would be nice to have a retrospective documentary here, containing interviews with surviving cast and crew, development of the Poltergeist story, an ILM featurette, with supervisor Richard Edlund, explaining how the groundbreaking-at-the-time, pre-CGI, pre-Ghostbusters visual-FX (whose visual FX Richard Edlund also supervised) were created, a sound-FX featurette on the film's otherworldly spirit noises, a memorial on the late, great Jerry Goldsmith, who composed Poltergeist's score, and a treatise on the ""Poltergeist curse"", which seems to have claimed not only Heather O'Rourke but Dominique Dunne, who played her older sister, Dana, who was strangled by her boyfriend.  The excellent Real Poltergeists Part I and II documentaries are the only extras already included here.  Reduce the sound level on these; they're much louder than the movie.

I will re-purchase this title if a mondo Special Edition of Poltergeist containing these elements surfaces.  Until then, the transfer of this film is magnificent on blu-ray, the best it has ever looked outside a cinema, the best way to experience Poltergeist at home.  I endured the horrible pan/scan version on VHS before Ted Turner released a slightly sub-par letterbox version back in the late '80s.  The addition of anamorphic and a much cleaner transfer on DVD brought back some of the magic.  The blu-ray really shines, shows Spielberg's and director Tobe Hooper's wide-screen Panavision compositions of the ghostly spectacle in all their full-resolution glory.

Don't waste your money on the Poltergeist sequels.  They blow.  This original Poltergeist is the seminal masterpiece, an all-encompassing story, a oner, that should've ended, for the Freeling family, anyway (spoiler alert), when dad Steve parks a TV (no more TV!) out on the balcony of the Holiday Inn on I-74.  A different family with a completely different family dynamic?  Might have made a good second movie.

Poltergeist II adds some interesting Native American folklore and spirituality to the franchise, and the Reverend Kane, played by ANCIENT Julian Beck, is scary as hell.  Still, it's weak compared to the original.

Poltergeist III (Poltergeist in a high-rise) is just ludicrous, absurd, merely an attempt to further cash in on the franchise.  It's only fascinating to watch because little Heather O' Rourke, who played Carol Anne, was visibly beginning to exhibit the signs of her real-life illness which would, shortly thereafter, really, tragically take her life.  The other side is a little brighter with Heather there, one more blonde angel.

140492,5,0792833201,"(no spoilers--that I know of)

Spielberg has been the king of special effects films for many years,
but you could argue instead for Wes Craven in the horror genre. And
now the Lord Of The Rings producer Peter Jackson. Eileen Moran very
recently left us, and she worked on LOTR and on Spielberg's Avatar.
Plus lots of different media that incorporates special effects.

Besides the special effects in Spielberg's Poltergeist, there is
an appealing trademark to all his flicks, and that any fan of his
should know is family. They are feasibly family movies, and up until the
90's in a niche not Disney. After the 90's Disney movies became
more contemporary, a little more adult. Spielberg's movies have
a lot more action, and what's known as ""sci-fi violence"". A curse
word, occasionally. In Poltergeist, much macabre action occurs, like
the swimming pool scene. I'm not convinced that the scenes containing
the cadavers were filmed as I've read. There is definitely spiritual/
afterworld discussion as one might expect. The ""cleaning woman"" comes
right out and lays it on the line to the Freelings--they have been
presented with forces otherworldly and have no choice but to believe
it. Now they have to believe they can get their daughter back from
an evil being in their own house.

A sad and tragic hallmark to this movie is the violent demise
of the actress who played Carol Anne's sister. I will let you
do your own surfing for that story.

My friend Mike really sums it best when he said,

""The television has an interesting role in that movie. Perhaps the first time that a tv was utilized almost as a main character/antagonist. There are other more subtle subversive themes going on as well, picturing suburbia and the American Dream as an encroachment upon sacred elements.""

Poltergeist has some of the most heartfelt, honest, heartbreaking, wonderful dialog, you just don't get such honest and stirring dialog like that anymore.

The music is haunting and beautiful, directing is amazing and immersive, the horror is palpable, but never over used, the other side never shown too much to destroy the mystery, tension or fear... incredible pacing, with one of the best comedic levity-filled endings that just works out of any horror ever made.

A little girl, the youngest in the family, during a storm, hears voices within a tv set and unknowingly warns that ""They're here."" The way she says that not only is cute and sweet, but given the context, is also chilling. Then the weird stuff happens. Too bad the bird had to go (not the eldest daughter's ""bird"" either, that one was creative).
I wish I could go into much of what happens, but I had no idea what would actually happen, so I can't say much in case someone else (unbelievably) hasn't seen this yet either. Suffice it to say, though, that even paranormal researchers have caught the field day, and so does a psychic. In the small moments where nothing actually happens, there's earnest dialogue about certain mysteries of life in connection to what all is going on.

140546,3,0792833201,"This is another one of those films that came out when I was in the Air Force at Hickam AFB, Hawaii.  To me, all the very best movies were released in the eighties because  we finally got past all that cheesiness of the campyness of the seventies, and this was before computer animation and CGI started to reduce the integrity of special effects that made more recently films look so cartoonish.

What really gives me the chills about this film is, although I came from some pretty frightening, nightmarish neighborhoods of Detroit, while I was in Hawaii, I started to see the beauty of the modern day home design and construction, and when I finally got stationed in Northern California, this development of Cueste Verde looks a lot like the neighborhoods of Vacaville, California (about 50 miles from San Francisco), so watching this film again since I've been in California, has given this film a whole new sense of terror to me.

The classic ""haunted house"" of film's past usually look more like some hundred year old house.  But this film makes the modern day house look like it can be haunted too.  Whenever I drive through Vacaville, I am reminded of this film.

It is also amazing that even though this film is only 30 years old, it's interesting how so many of the actors and actresses in this film are already dead and gone.  Even Heather O'Rourke (who played 4 year old Carol Anne), is dead and gone.

Yeah, I'll have to say that this film has some stronger means of terrifying me more than just being a haunted house film.  I feel like this can happen even in my own neighborhood.  Thank you Steven Spielberg for putting classic horror in a modern day reality setting.

But, because this film came out in the early eighties, it remains one of my favorites to remind me of my wonderful military days.

What presentation has going for it is incredible visual effects that breathe a life of their own in this BD format. The soundtrack is 5.1 (I still wish for a day where 7.1 is the industry standard), and there are a dozen plus languages for subtitles. The packaging itself is a small data book with interesting recollections, comments by some of the cast and crew (though nothing die-hard fans might not have known prior).

140550,5,0792833201,"I remember that I went to see this film with my buddy in early summer 1982 and we thought it was really scary.  The movie begins with a light-hearted, humorous tone but things get pretty tense rather quickly.  Who can forget that creepy tree right outside the house, the scary clown, the face-ripping scene, and that intense swimming pool scene in the climax.  The film is rated PG and the PG-13 rating did not come around till around 1984 or 1985.  I am sure if this movie was to be released today it would be rated PG-13.  Craig T. Nelson and Jobeth Williams are great as the parents of some very likeable and believable kids.  Their family is so likeable that you really get emotionally involved in the action and their hopes of saving Carol Anne and the rest of the family.

There has been a lot of controversy over who actually directed the film.  Steven Spielberg was the producer while Tobe Hooper was the director.  The movie has Spielberg's fingerprints all over it.

140582,5,0792833201,"You know how many YEARS I've been wanting to watch the original Poltergeist?  More than 10, that's for sure.  I just don't understand why it took this long to finally be able to watch it.  Oh sure, I could have bought the DVD on amazon but the price has always been really high (perhaps because people realize how much of a classic it is?)  The rating scores here on amazon are MIGHTY impressive, and I'm about to give it its 200 5-star rating.

My expectations were INSANELY high last night.  Every horror buff I've ever known raves about the original Poltergeist.  Knowing how much I love films such as the Amityville Horror and the Exorcist, I simply could NOT go wrong.  Talk about searching for the gold at the end of the rainbow and not even having to BE near the rainbow- this movie was destined to be in my top 5 horror classics of all-time, no doubt about it.

Anyway, what makes the movie so good?  Or rather, what makes it so scary?  Well for those of you who happen to be in the same category as me and never got a chance to see it, you probably already know a few things.  One, the blonde-haired little girl has an obsession starring at the static on TV screens late at night after the Star-Spangled Banner is over, and two, something evil is lurking inside the home.  Just what it IS that's lurking however, is where the suspense comes in.  These are definitely things *I* knew before going in last night.  Now however, I know a whole lot more, haha.  I realize these things were just the tip of the iceberg.  There's actually a REALLY compelling and frightening story taking place here and even more amazingly, this movie takes the atmosphere and the jump scares that *would* seem cheap in other films, and uses them fantastically and right at home here.

Alright, where to start.  How about the kitchen scene with the chairs?  I won't be giving it away but something extraordinary happens here even though nowadays it's a recurring theme in scary movies and stories.  I imagine back in 1982 people were totally shocked and on the edge of their seats over such a segment.  I actually didn't see it coming.  Proof that a subtle camera view and a quiet and unpredictable scene can really produce amazing results.

Now the BEST part of this movie has to be shortly after the halfway point when after its finally been proven that a poltergeist is living in this house, everyone is awake in the middle of the night and whispering and carrying conversations with each other over the fear that they're experiencing.  This is when the investigation team comes into the home and becomes friends with the family.  This is what I mean when I say the story is compelling.  This particular type of segment when people are discussing their fear and how to handle the presence of a poltergeist (and having plenty of time devoted to it) is what *makes* a horror movie exciting to me.

This segment is a good 15 minutes long and it never feels overlong or overdone, and proves that time devotion is the key to success.  I was actually waiting for something loud, menacing and terrifying to suddenly happen amongst all the whispering and quiet atmosphere but... what happens isn't QUITE what you're probably thinking as a viewer, but... without spoiling it, the glow at the top of the stairs leading to an unusual circumstance that wasn't presented by the naked eye until AFTER the poltergeist crew went over the tapes is what strikes me as the most fasciating part of this segment.  Heck, just the fact that whatever was lurking upstairs in the kids bedroom decided to make its presence known to the family and ghost hunting team downstairs in the middle of the night is terrifying enough.

What's interesting is that the blonde-haired little girl that's become synonymous with the Poltergeist series actually becomes TRAPPED behind the walls of the house when her obsession with communicating with the demons through the static-y television screens finally becomes too much and sucks her in.  Another highlight is the presence of Zelda Rubinstein, the creepiest woman to EVER set foot in a horror film.  Back in the 80's she was downright awesome.  Nobody was better at delivering their creepy lines than Zelda.  Her presence ALONE makes the movie that much more chilling.  She does a spectacular job telling the story here and why the blonde-haired girl is stuck in the other dimension.  If Zelda's scary face doesn't frighten you, surely her high-pitched speaking voice and her eerie, slow-walking demeanor will.

Of course the movie isn't without some faults.  The tree that comes alive and blasts its branches through the bedroom window and hogs up the little brother almost had me laughing because of how ridiculous the trees behavior was, and you know, I really don't KNOW what to think about the ending when the house folds up and destroys itself.  A part me of was thinking ""The family escaped just in time!"" but another part of me thinks ""Wow, that was totally the creepiest thing I've ever seen- what if MY house ever did that?"" and whenever the father would come home and get frightened when he sees lights constantly flickering through the windows, these were *awesome* and tense moments that reminded me of the Amityville Horror.  I didn't even know what to think about the swimming pool/floating bodies segments (which is more like a mud pit than a pool) until I watched the beginning of Poltergeist 2- NOW that scene seems really good to me.

I could just keep going on and on about the many fears that were highlights.  How about the peacefulness of the bedroom closet, giving an almost heavenly setting, trying to suck the kids into the other dimension?  It made it seem like the kids would be curious enough and willing to go just because of how beautiful it was.  THAT'S truly the sign of something evil- not just being able to fool kids, but doing so with what confusingly appears to be by God's hands.  Oh, and whenever the mother got an itch to attempt to open the bedroom door even though the evil presence was denying her to enter?  Yeah, GREAT atmosphere and tension once again.

I just have zero complaints about this movie.  A proper amount of time was spent building to a well-told horror classic.  That's all I can say.  Worth owning indeed, even if you do have to spend a little more than usual.  It's totally worth it.",1334361600,,6348,4.662769784172662

The movie is a classic; many of the things we know about Poltergeists actual came from this movie.

140586,5,0792833201,"Great horror films age well, transcending decades with a unique universal appeal. It's a simple formula. When done well, with the best talents and checkbooks of Hollywood backing the project, it creates the kind of classic the 1982 film ""Poltergeist"" represents. Producer and writer Steven Spielberg, and to a lessor extent director Tobe Hooper (and his contributions are a controversy to this day), decided they wanted to update the ageless ""haunted house"" genre, transporting a fireside tale to the endless sea of modern American suburbia track homes. In doing so, they've created a big-budget horror extravaganza as warmly comfortable as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-s-A-Wonderful-Life/dp/B001M432XA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It's A Wonderful Life</a>.

I first saw this the week it opened and can still recall the audience screams when the paranormal expert stands before a mirror and later, the clown sequence. When the film finally ended, following an unbearable rollercoaster of suspense and exploding effects, as one we breathed a deep sigh of relief. Since that joyful experience, I have watched ""Poltergeist"" many times, owning a VHS and now DVD copy. I marvel at the overall package and its gentle brilliance.

From the opening scene, we are introduced to the Freeling family, an energetic messy mix of still-youthful California parents with three children. Casting is key here, and Spielberg made the same strategic choice he did with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jaws-Two-Disc-30th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B0008KLVG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jaws (Two-Disc 30th Anniversary Edition)</a>&nbsp;by hiring unknown but talented actors for the leads. Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams do not disappoint, carving classic, award-worthy portrayals of loving parents. While both actors achieved considerable success after ""Poltergeist,"" for better or worse they will forever be known for these roles, heartrending, touching and a perfect symbol of the undeniable strength of healthy parenthood. The main reason ""Poltergeist"" has achieved such enduring success is because of their extraordinary work, celluloid parents who can easily stand alongside the Hansons (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Remember-Mama/dp/B0004Z322O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Remember Mama</a>) and the Minivers (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mrs-Miniver/dp/B00011D1OU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mrs. Miniver</a>).

Something is not quite right in the Freeling household as there appears to be a sinister presence stalking the youngest child (Heather O'Rourke) through the TV. There's soon a mysterious earthquake, scary thunderstorms and that tree outside the bedroom window is pretty creepy. These early sequences create growing dread, all the more impressive because they take place within warm, appealing domesticity. This leads to one of the most terrifying scenes ever filmed, and it's telling the moment is one of the quietest in the film. Alone in the kitchen one morning, Mother Freeling sees chairs out of place in the dining area. She replaces them and walks to a kitchen cabinet, returning within seconds to see them shockingly stacked upon the table. This unedited moment, taking place over roughly 10 seconds, will chill you to the bone. I've read this scene required a single take, with a strategy involving multiple off-camera assistants. It's unforgettable filmmaking requiring resource and ingenuity, rather than special effects, as horrifying as the twitch of Boris Karloff's hand.

Spielberg, as he often does, likes to have his cake and eat it too. Having effectively displayed the suspenseful muscle of a prime Hitchcock, he soon turns a bedroom closet into the equivalent of a drunken night at Studio 54, evidently a portal into another dimension where the ""Beast"" resides. The Freeling's daughter Carol Anne is kidnapped by ghosts in the dead of night, and they must recruit paranormal experts to save the day. ""Poltergeist"" never lets up and just when you think those pesky banshees are gone, they come back for more. Similar to the casting choices of the Freelings, Spielberg achieves perceptive wonders with the actors portraying the paranormal experts. Beatrice Straight, in her best role following her Oscar-winning success in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Network/dp/B000I5SY9Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Network</a>, portrays angelic balance as the supportive spiritual leader Dr. Lesh (in a role originally intended for Shirley MacLaine). A young Richard Lawson also provides fine work as Ryan and, of course, Zelda Rubinstein as the famous, Hobbit-like psychic Tangina. Their colorful efforts to document and overcome this sinister gang of ghost demons are thrilling moments of unbearable tension.

I suppose the eventual explanation for the haunting is unbelievable as one would imagine when building homes and swimming pools construction crews would have to dig deeper than ""six feet under."" But by the time this skeleton in the closet is offered, ""Poltergeist"" has already won us over multiple times. What Spielberg has brilliantly achieved, and where his mastery is on the level of his classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/E-T-The-Extra-Terrestrial-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000A2IPP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (Widescreen Edition)</a>, is in creating a fantastic middle-America story fit for the entire family. Granted, preschool children (around the age of Carol Anne) would be traumatized by this film, but young teens and their parents can watch this on Halloween eve and marvel at the amusement park thrills. Steven, at the height of his unparalleled filmmaking wonder power, has recreated the timeless ghost story with the only victim a bird in a cage. This film is so good even the two terrible sequels that followed have been forgotten, unable to dent the reputation of its original (ironically, similar to the ""Jaws"" sequels).

""Poltergeist,"" a work of uncommon imagination, should ultimately be studied in film classes as one of the greatest horror films ever made.",1328227200,2,6958,6.598907103825137
140587,5,0792833201,"Without retreading every review on here, this is one of those movies you may have seen as a kid and relished the mild gore and violence, just enough to chill but not damage. The only thing I will add to this is that Tobe Hooper probably didn't direct this movie alone. In fact I suspect that Spielberg had an eye over his shoulder throughout. The fact is, Hooper has never directed such a polished production before or after. Besides Texas Chainsaw, this is the only other notable film to his credit being that he is primarly a B-movie film-maker. Compare Funhouse that he directed around the same time. TOTALLY different style. I guess we'll never know to what extent Spielberg was involved, but from what I've read, he was certainly responsible for the look and the acting. Regardless, a great 80's movie.",1326758400,,807,4.690140845070423
140588,4,0792833201,"""Poltergeist"" is the closest that Steven Spielberg has come to making a horror film. Yes, I know Tobe Hooper got credit for directing the film but Spielberg's fingerprints are all over this movie.

The film remains creepy all these years later holding up remarkably well probably because Spielberg and Hooper rely on old fashioned suspense thrilling techniques to anchor the movie while employing some novel (at the time) and new techniques. The other part that keeps ""Poltegeist"" so potent are the strong performances by the actors particularly Jo Beth Williams and Craig T. Nelson in the main roles as the parents.

""Poltergeist"" looks quite nice in its Blu-ray debut--the film looks surprisingly sharp with robust colors (particularly when compared to the original DVD transfer--the remastered DVD comes from the same high definition source and looks quite nice as well). Detail is quite nice and while there is some mild speckling springkled throughout the film, the presentation looks spectular for the most part.

Unfortunately when the movie was remastered for Blu-ray and DVD we didn't get any extras such as a commentary track (no suprise given that Spielberg doesn't like commentary tracks) nor do we get any extras on the making of the movie (not even the vintage featurette done at the time).

We DO get a rather clever featurette that discusses the subject matter of the film. The featurette entitled ""They Are Here"" is pretty good even if it isn't tied directly into the production of the film. We get a parade of parapsychologists surrounded by clips from the movie discussing the REAL world of spirits.

 The film is surrounded by tragedy (as there was the murder of one cast member and the premature death of Heather O'Rouke. Perhaps the rumors that swirled around the film at the time that Spielberg had stepped in and taken over the direction of the film played a role in the decision not to include anything about the making of the movie itself.

The audio isn't lossless which is a pity--it's presented in a 16 bit presentation that's quite nice but I'm a bit surprised we didn't get a lossless presentation.

Although I'm a little disappointed by the lack of extras here the film itself looks exceptionally good and THAT'S what you'll end up viewing over and over again.

140624,5,0792833201,"I decided to review POLTERGEIST mostly because i know this movie became a classic and then a cult throughout the years but its also a perfect example of what i call fantasy/horror. It is a perfect match between  horror AND fantasy....It is also another example of an epic artistic collaboration between director TOBE HOOPER (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Toolbox Murders) and Legendary writor /director STEVEN SPIELBERG from  which i don't even need to quote films.

Another reason would definitely be Heather....Even today in 2011, I still have lots of questions from friends and entourage regarding my views on THE EXORCIST and that little possessed girl who died making the movie...every time i have to explain that NO, they are not talking about the exorcist, they are talking about Heather O Rourke in POLTERGEIST. YES, Linda Blair from THE EXORCIST is alive and well!! Sometimes still making appearance in movies!!! Some say that Heather , the cast and the set were  cursed because they were making a movie about ghosts and bad spirits, some still believe that's the reason why she died........

Poltergeist is another movie that got me hooked right away and marked my childhood. I must've been the same age as heather when i first saw it, or maybe a year or 2 older. She became a friend right away, a friend that would help me not to be scared throughout the movie, i was very scared of ghosts and monsters at that age but i was also fascinated by it at the same time. I must've figured out this cute little girl would probably take care of all undesired ghosts and help me watch the whole thing without being scared! And she kinda did in a way....the magic aspect of this movie got me hooked for the whole ride!!.

With poltergeist 2 and 3 that followed a few years later and local TV station playing all of them at least once every year , me and my sister quickly got to know heather (""Carol Ann"" in the movie) and poltergeist. She was kinda like a heroine to us, just like what ALICE became for me a few years later in NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 4 - THE DREAM MASTER.

The quality of the film is exceptional, it is a very good story that will get you hooked pretty quickly, the acting is good and you actually get to care about them!!!. As for action and suspense and surprises this one is definitely a winner in my book!!! Special effects are great! And we even have some truly sad and compelling moments in there too. This remastered version is fantastic!!! A few minutes in the movie and you won't even be able to tell it was actually done in 1982!!!!!

To end my review, i would definitely say that this is a real classic!!!! A must have!!! Especially if you've never seen it!!!. Heather..(or Carol Ann)..will always be in my heart and remembered for this excellent movie that was also part of my fantasy/horror addiction...(which i don't want to get rid of...lol)............So thank you heather for those magic moments!!!.......RIP...

140625,2,0792833201,"I clearly should have seen this when it was new and I was young enough to be scared by it.

I guess it was a major accomplishment at the time, but it had serious flaws from the outset and hasn't aged well.  If it had been a good movie otherwise the primitive special effects wouldn't matter, but, now that the effects look so cheesy it doesn't have a screenwriting, acting, or storyline leg to stand on.

The acting is mediocre at best.  A grab-bag of random, over-the-top, phenomena stand in for an actual storyline.  The characters and their reactions don't make sense: Who stays in a house with a child-eating vortex in the bedroom closet, whether or not it has supposedly been cleansed by a spirit medium?  Furthermore, once the phenomena resume, who stays another leisurely week or so while they pack up to move??  I was starting to think they should just let the thing have that blonde kid, since she was turning out to be such a liability.

Also, if you're particular about your hauntings, this isn't about poltergeists.  It's almost more of a demon thing, except not really.

I'm often critical of Tobe Hooper's directing, but there is no doubt that Poltergeist represents his finest directorial work (although rumor has it that producer/co-writer Steven Spielberg did more than his share of the directing job).

I'm not sure why they called this film Poltergeist because the goings-on in the Freeling house go way, way beyond typical poltergeist activity.  Things start out small (chair stacking, objects moving on their own, utensils bending on their own), but it doesn't take long for things to get completely out of hand.  Initially, though, the stage is set with the typical fears most all of us experienced as children - fear of the dark, the closet, something under the bed, thunder storms, stuffed toys that suddenly become creepy when the lights are out.  Fortunately for most of us, those fears are just childish fancies.  The same cannot be said for the Freeling children.  Unable to go to the police with their story (yes, officer, we think our lost daughter is somewhere in the house and we can still communicate with her through the television from time to time), the Freelings call upon local paranormal researchers for help.  Needless to say, this blows the socks off of every other case they've investigated, leaving them no choice but to call in reinforcements in the form of a short but formidable medium (Rubenstein).  Then, just when you think things are under control, the movie ratchets things up to new heights of action and suspense.

Poltergeist definitely has the potential to frighten some viewers, with scare tactics ranging from the small and subtle to the unbelievably grandiose - and even the most over-the-top occurrences work in the context of the presentation.  No stranger to large special effects budgets, Spielberg made sure that all of the visual effects were believable (including the use of real human skeletons in one scene) and added to the suspense of the story (except that mirror scene, which really does feature some of the worst special effects I've ever seen in my life).  Not having seen this movie in many, many years, I had forgotten just how impressive it was.  It features some of the best interaction of actors with special effects that I've ever seen, making it easy to keep suspending your disbelief in the face of the most incredible of circumstances.  You even get a sense of resolution at the end, which is something you rarely find in horror movies today.  Poltergeist is, without doubt, a classic in every sense of the word.

I would be remiss if I didn't also mention the Poltergeist curse (a result, some say, of using real skeletons in the movie), which adds yet another layer to the atmosphere of the film.  As most people know, Heather O'Rourke died tragically at the age of 12, but it's easy to forget that her co-star Dominique Dunne (daughter of novelist Dominick Dunne) was murdered by her ex-boyfriend within months of the film's release.  Of course, the curse doesn't seem to have affected Craig T. Nelson, who went on to have a long and successful acting career.  You can't help but feel sad, though, watching cute and talented little Heather O'Rourke, knowing that she died so young.",1310515200,3,3732,4.975845410628019

140655,5,0792833201,"My siblings and I saw Poltergeist(1982) on TV in the late 1980's. We found all two hours of the film riveting and scary! The Freeling Family live in a suburban home and they endure a series of bizarre incidents(chairs move of their own accord and utensils bend). However, the terror escalates as ghosts kidnap their daughter Carol Anne(Heather O' Rourke) and keep her held hostage in another dimension! Poltergeist is a German word that means ""rumbling spirit"". Tobe Hooper(The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Lifeforce) directed Poltergeist and there are rumors that producer Steven Spielberg actually directed some scenes.
Poltergeist cast member Dominique Dunne died in 1982. Heather O' Rourke died in 1988 during post-production of Poltergeist III(1988). Lou Perry(the construction worker helping himself to Diane Freeling's breakfast) died in 2009. Fans of the Poltergeist movies miss them as if they were family. The late Jerry Goldsmith wrote a superb music score for Poltergeist. It's tender...and intense at the same time! Everything from The Simpsons to Scary Movie 2 to Family Guy has spoofed it.

140657,5,0792833201,"Everybody everywhere knows of a ghost story; some place nearby where something goes on, or has gone on. Usually, there's a rational explanation, like the people who were frightened by a moaning entity they saw by the side of a country road one night; a white shape lingering next to a tree making a deep moaning sound. Turns out, it was at the edge of a cow pasture, and a black cow with a large white spot on its face discovered it could scratch its neck by rubbing against a tree right next to the road; at night, all you could see was the white spot. And when the cow mooed, well...I can't say I wouldn't be soiling my pants if I didn't know what it was either. More always goes on in the mind.

In recent decades, evolving technology has made the study of energy fields possible - imagine if you could go back in time to the colonial days and use a magnet in front of the superstitious people of the time? They would be as terrified of you as the cast of characters in the film ""Poltergeist"" were of the thing which took their little daughter away. Everything alive and once alive has an energy field to it, this is a proven fact. At the moment of physical death, just what happens to your energy? The irony is, it's something nobody here really knows for sure, but WILL know one day. If nothing awaits us, we will know it when we ultimately ""shut down,"" and if we in fact do go somewhere, we will ALL find out.

In Hooper and Speilberg's 1982 masterpiece, Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams are cast as a happy, attractive, upper-middle class couple with nice kids, who are about to go on a very rough ride. Their house is located on a spot where it shouldn't be, and an unseen being, known only to the youngest daughter, has a few tricks up it's sleeve. This is where the idea of evil becomes so disturbingly plain, in a fictional story as this and in real life. Evil invariably involves the corruption of an innocent; here it talks to this trusting innocent little girl as her friend, only to later invade and abduct, always with an invitation, per ""Captain Howdy"" from Blatty's story ""The Exorcist.""  And in this kind of story, the real horror is in putting yourself in the position of this family - what would it be like to suddenly lose the youngest member of your family? It could be an evil spirit, as in this movie, or it could be the scummy parolee who lives down the road you warn your little ones to avoid. He's friendly, isn't he?

In ""Poltergeist,"" beautiful cinematography and spectacular special effects soften the blow of this particular tragedy, but create an enhanced viewing experience nonetheless; Steven Spielberg makes fantastic-looking movies. Everything about this movie is beautiful, even the ugly shots, such as ""Marty's Midnight Snack,"" a genuily horrific sequence. Good lord, that's nasty. But every scene is so vivid, it just leaps off your screen; the lighting, the set design, and the camera work are of the highest standard. You are comfortable watching it.

Some bad times have befallen some of the people in this film; in the 1980's Dominique Dunne, cast here as older daughter Dana, was absent from the first sequel, because she foolishly had a live-in relationship with a real piece of work named John Sweeney. An acting role she had for her next movie cast her as a battered woman, and the make-up department didn't need to do too much; her bruises were real. That ended when the lowlife, bottom-feeding, scum-sucking Sweeney placed his hands around her throat and throttled her to death; who does this stuff anyway? Most recently (at this writing) Lou Perryman, a longtime friend and associate of director Tobe Hooper, befell a grisley fate. In this film, he was cast as the construction worker who talks to Diane (JoBeth Williams) through the kitchen window as the yard was being dug up to install a swimming pool. In 2009 his home was invaded by an axe-wielding ex-con who hacked him to death during the burglary; what a horrible way to go! Again, evil running rampant in this world, worse, because it's the real thing.  And of course there was the doomed Heather O'Rourke. Even while she was alive and well, one could see she had this ethereal, ghostly beauty to her that set her apart. There was something to her that wasn't of this world, and that was one thing of many which made her performance in ""Poltergeist"" so memorable. She was THE poster-child for purity and innocence. Such a sweet little girl, a trooper to the end, never letting on just how gravely ill she was, her swollen face during the third installment of this series being the only indication of something being wrong. And by then, her illness had taken its course and she was then taken away from us; not by a fictional spirit, only to return, but by the real angel of death. And she now knows just what awaits us at the end.

As a P.S.

In the extras, the two - part documentary of paranormal investigations has its plusses and minuses, raising some interesting points, open-mindedly looking into the possibility of unseen presences here with us. But are we really supposed to interact with them, if they are in fact here? Without super-sensitive devices, communication is out of the question, unless you are ""tuned in,"" like little Carol Anne Freeling in the movie. And look what happened to her and her family. Do you really want to go there? When I die, I want to come back and spook these people good, give 'em their money's worth.

One last point, just getting something off my chest; in the documentary, paranormal investigator Patrick Burns, I believe, is a charlatain at most, and a pseudo-intellectual at the least. He talks to the camera with his head cocked to the side, as someone who knows it all, with an edge we'll never have. He tries to flex his mental muscles by saying of Electric Voice Phenomena, ""...EVP is an acronym..."" No, mister genius, an acronym is a set of initials which can be pronounced as a word, like ""Special Weapons And Tactics."" The initials of this phrase are s, w, a, and t. You can pronounce it; you say ""SWAT."" How do you pronounce ""EVP?""...""Evip?"" Acronyms have nothing to do with ghosts anyway, so you just told me you like to talk meadow muffins and hope people are buying it. Too bad, because this really is an interesting topic. But the movie itself is excellent, anyway.",1295827200,,6335,4.594164456233422

140659,4,0792833201,"This is a great classic 80s horror film.  It has the suspense and suprise and the creepy special effects but not the violence and gore of harder core horror. An average family has their life taken hostage by a ""noisy spirit"" or poltergeist. All begins mildly with moving objects and voices that only the youngest child can hear. The poltergeist quickly increases the activity to frights in the night and eventually to taking the little girl to wherever the poltergeist resides.  The movie progresses in attempts to get the child back and to reveal the root cause of the poltergeist's presence. Of course, one really only needs to say, ""Steven Speilberg"" to recommend this movie.

140682,4,0792833201,"When I saw Poltergeist (1982) in the theater back in '82, I really liked it.  It really was unlike anything I had ever seen before in the horror genre.  It stuck with me for a long time.  I used to watch it all the time when it was playing on any cable TV movie channel.  I hadn't yet seen any of the classic haunted house/ghost story movies, such as House On Haunted Hill (1959), The Innocents (1961), The Haunting (1963), The Legend Of Hell House (1973), Burnt Offerings (1976), The Amityville Horror (1979), The Changeling (1980), etc.  I was just a kid back in '82, so Poltergeist was really the first haunted house movie I had seen.

These days, while I still like Poltergeist, I don't rank it in my Top 10 haunted house movies of all time simply because the above mentioned movies are far superior, in my opinion.  Not that Poltergeist is weak, it isn't.  But I would classify Poltergeist as a haunted house movie that's pretty much suitable for the whole family to watch.  It has that Stephen Spielberg family-friendly ""children's charm"" feel to it.  You know what I mean - a middle class couple that lives in a nice new house in a nice new subdivision and they have some small children and a dog.  These things alone lighten the mood right off the bat.  I know I should judge this movie on its own merits, but I have grown, over time, to prefer the more serious haunted house/ghost story movies that have a dark atmosphere from start to finish and usually take place in an old mansion, like most of the movies I mentioned above.  So, as a result, when I watch Poltergeist THESE DAYS, it doesn't quite satisfy my craving for really dark atmosphere and seriousness like the other movies do.  Back in '82 I would have given this movie 5 stars.  These days, it's 4 stars.  It's a good movie, but it's too much on the lighter side for me.  I prefer psychological horror that the previously mentioned movies provide over the in-your-face and over-the-top horror of Poltergeist.

I must say the movie gets darker and creepier as it progresses, which is good.  Some of the scenes are scary, some of the scenes are over-the-top (that's an understatement), while other scenes are meant to be humorous, while still other scenes come off as cheesy.  In this movie, you'll actually SEE the ghosts.  For this kind of family-oriented movie, it's totally reasonable and acceptable.

I really like the clown doll in the son's bedroom.  Creeeeeeppppppyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The score by Jerry Goldsmith is adequate for this movie in that it fits in with the whole family-friendly/charming feel to the movie.  By no means is it scary music.  No way.  If you want scary and creepy music in a haunted house movie, watch the original The Haunting (1963) with its score by Humphrey Searle.  It fits perfectly into the dark and creepy atmosphere.  Another movie with a great score is The Changeling (1980).  Also, The Legend Of Hell House (1973), The Amityville Horror (1979), and Rose Red (2002) have great scores.  Even The Innocents (1961) has its moments of great music.  Stephen Spielberg co-wrote and co-produced Poltergeist while Tobe Hooper (The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Salem's Lot, The Funhouse) directed it.

The plot:  Some ghosts begin communicating with Mr. & Mrs. Freeling's five-year-old daughter Carol Anne through the ""snow"" on the TV set in the wee hours of the morning.  This is the way the ghosts get into the Freeling's California home.  The ghosts kidnap Carol Anne and her family makes a great effort to rescue her, much to the ghosts' displeasure.  Do they succeed?

This DVD has some good special features, one of which is a documentary called They Are Here: The Real World Of Poltergeists Revealed in 2 parts: 1) Science Of The Spirits, and 2) Communing With The Dead.

Overall, a solid movie that you should like if you're into haunted house movies and/or haunted house movies that are more family-friendly and over-the-top.",1284422400,2,3935,4.739322533136966

Terrifying and original supernatural horror drama from writer-producer Steven Spielberg and director Tobe Hooper is one of the greatest horror movies of all time.

Brilliant acting by the cast that even launched the career of Craig T. Nelson, excellent special effects that hold up today, a memorable score by Jerry Goldsmith and jolts galore in this non-stop rollercoaster ride of pure thrills and scares.

POLTERGEIST is one of these.

The transfer is great.  I was 2 when it came out so I never got to see it as a big-screen experience and it is a revelation to see it as such: I liked this movie before and I LOVE it now.  However, the transfer's not the problem...it's the master.  I don't think they cleaned the film sufficiently when they struck the master because there's noticeable dirt and pinprick abrasions throughout the film: it's not terrible, or even plain bad...but if you are a videophile like me, it can be a bit unnerving.  The worst part is the living room scene where they first speak to Carol Anne: there's a series of faded vertical scratches through the middle of the screen throughout the entire scene...I would have hoped they'd notice that and paint it out, but they didn't.  Thankfully the scratches are thin and faint (and they don't show up again) so they're not unbearable, but they are irritating.  The film is grainy, but in the good way (1980s film stock wasn't as sharp as it is today) although some grains seem a little larger than others at times...but I can't prove it.

As for special features, well, I think POLTERGEIST is never gonna have the special features it deserves due to the whole Spielberg/Hooper controversy, so I won't get my hopes up.  Basically the picture reminds me of first generation DVDs of classic movies (the first Road Warrior DVD comes to mind)...much better than VHS, but it could be improved/cleaned up.

Colors, tones, blacks and all that other stuff seem to be fine.  Aside from the maintenance issue, I don't see any other problems with this transfer and at $20 right now is a great find.",1254009600,10,1936,4.712166172106825
140729,5,0792833201,"**** PLEASE NOTE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW, IF YOU'VE NOT SEEN THE FILM YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO READ MY REVIEW FIRST ****

So this is one of those films that I ""should"" have seen a long time ago; it came out in the early summer of 1982, when I was 16, between my junior and senior years of high school. I didn't yet have my driver's license and lived 10 miles from the nearest theater, out in the country, so had to rely on mom or friends with licenses (of which I had none) to get to movies - and I had a minimal allowance and didn't work outside of the plentiful chores at home. Thus I didn't see a lot of movies, and I really had no interest in horror at that point, and didn't really know directors or writers. The fact that the guy who wrote, produced, and co-edited (uncredited) this film was the same guy behind my previous summer's favorite ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was just something I didn't catch. And for whatever reason, I've never caught up to it in all the years since, still not being a huge horror fan and no longer being a huge Spielberg fan.

But last night I finally did, and what was I thinking leaving this so long? This is Spielberg really hitting the core of his suburban-southwestern-America-as-the-world mythology, his nuclear family beset by strangeness and chaos from beyond, and hitting it supercharged on all cylinders. Interestingly enough the only reference to a specific place here is a quick mention of ""I-74"", which runs from Iowa to North Carolina - but the feel of the place to me wasn't much different than that of ""E.T."" or ""Close Encounters"", obviously the two films with which it has the closest affinity. It's Everywhere USA I suppose - everywhere outside of the Northeast, anyway. Flyover country.

Of course this is credited to director Tobe Hooper - the man behind ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Lifeforce"" among others - but it feels Spielbergian all the way through, from the pans over the tract housing, to the cutesy kids, to the visual references to buddy George Lucas' work to the playing of one of Spielberg's favorite films, ""A Guy Named Joe"" on TV. In fact, the film opens with a TV, as the station goes off the air after midnight (I guess that'll date the film to many) and we're left with static. The story is pretty simple - a nice, young suburban family consisting of parents Steve & Diane (Craig T. Nelson and Jobeth Williams), and kids Dana, Robbie and Carol Anne (Dominique Dunne, Oliver Robbins and Heather O'Rourke) live in a modern, bland but very comfortable large suburban home and are beset by a demonic presence which eventually snatches Carol Anne away after some less harmful fun, leaving her parents to try to get her back through use of parapsychologists and a medium/mystic. The film builds rather slowly for its first half hour, then escalates pretty quickly - which works well because you'd wonder why the family doesn't leave right away otherwise. From about a third of the way in, it's a roller-coaster ride every bit as exciting as Raiders but there's a lot more going on underneath I think.

Steve and Diane love each other and seem to be fairly committed - this is a rare Spielberg happy family with few problems - on the outside. Sure they're a little distracted, they smoke a little too much dope maybe (this was a bit of a surprise) and they're not terribly concerned about the kids' nightmares at first - but there's nothing really wrong here that is their fault. Except that they're shallow and just don't seem to pay all that much attention to what's going on around them, don't seem to have much inner life. Spielberg and Hooper build the early part of the film quite carefully - subtle moments like Diane's comment to Steve to ""reach back into our past, when you used to have an open mind"" show us that this is a couple that has chosen this rather dull and conformist existence; later we start to feel that they also are going through life blindly and purposelessly. The one scene we have with Steve on his job (he's a salesman for the very same models of homes that he lives in) he seems a little distracted, uninterested, having to dredge up how to sell the home rather than really showing enthusiasm. The house the family lives in is the setting for over 90% of the film, their sanctuary, their only world.

But then the supernatural forces take over their lives - they have to let others in, and the ""ghostbusters"" (well, two of the three) show themselves to be very serious and very aware of what they might be dealing with. Beatrice Straight, as Dr. Lesh, the psychologist in charge, and Zelda Rubinstein as the psychic eventually called in to form something like an exorcism, are very clear that there are powerful forces - that they absolutely believe in but cannot truly understand - at work; that this situation calls into question our most basic beliefs - but it's never quite clear what if anything Diane and Steve believe in, other than their daily existence of working, sending the kids off to school, etc. At first I thought that the reclaiming of Carol Anne would have been a good ending for the film - but they have to actually go in and fight the monster lurking at the heart both of the house and their own shallow psyches, and though they escape physically unharmed, at the end the dream house is gone, and there is a palpable sense of defeat as the bloodied family retreats to a hotel, pushing the symbol of their solipsism, a TV, outside.

I haven't seen enough of Tobe Hooper's work to really be able to say that this fits in any way with his directorial ""vision""; it's pretty clear that Spielberg's is an equal, if not the presiding, voice here. Maybe the photography is a little less pretty, maybe it's a little more gruesome and a little less sentimental than his other work, but whether that's coming from director or writer/producer I'm not sure I care - this is the most clear-eyed and pessimistic of Spielberg's early films, still plenty full of the gosh-wow (the FX look pretty good for a film of this period and the scares are still there) but on the whole a pretty harsh indictment of the shallowness of the suburban fantasy-life and of the denial and repression of history - as we find out, to no one's surprise, that the development our heroic family has been living in is an old burial ground, never de-consecrated, never forgotten, at least by the dead. They don't, in the end, manage to bring anybody over to the ""other side"" - but they do cause enough trauma to prevent any typical Spielbergian happy ending from glossing over.

Pretty much tied with ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" for my favorite film with Spielberg's name on it.",1252886400,3,6665,4.5723849372384935

140736,5,0792833201,"Here we have one of the scariest films of the 80's - a classic.  Who can forget ""Carrie Anne, Don't go into the light!!""  Films of this age are hit and miss with blu ray transfers.  Sometimes the quality is subpar and sometimes the film is so dated however good the transfer it lacks any true oomph.  Luckily neither of these two things happen here.

The blu ray transfer shines.  Colors are crisp and there is no grain visible from age.  One might think that the type of visual effects used this long ago might not transfer well but they certainly do.  They pop.  Added to this brilliant picture is audio that keeps the tension mounting and will have you jumping at every scare.  Dialogue is strong and audio effects utilize all speakers to their max.

It is great to see that such a classic film has not aged and is just as effective today.  This blu ray disc also comes in a special hardcover case that has a great booklet about the film.  For those who remember the film definitely purchase it on blu ray in its new glory.  Those who have never seen it will get a definite treat.",1237075200,4,1083,4.323383084577115
140737,2,0792833201,"I'm sorry to say that this is probably one of the lamest horror films I've ever seen.  If you're a casual movie-goer, the dumbed-down, cheap scares might be to your liking, but for horror-lovers, I reccomend staying away.  For one thing, Spielberg is not a horror movie director, and it shows.  There is no sense of style, pacing, or atmosphere to the film.  In fact, only a pointless gore scene halfway through and a few cheap jump scenes throughout could justify this as a horror movie.  Actually, for me the most frightening part was that Tobe Hooper, the mastermind behind 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,' was involved in the making of 'Poltergeist.'  For another thing, it's hard to fear the movie's antagonists when they are not only continuously relied on for laughs, but also lack any sort of mystery or menace.

All in all, this is a horror film for people who don't like horror films.  If you've seen masterpieces such as 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', '[rec]', 'Halloween', 'The Thing', 'The Sixth Sense', or even (dare I say it?) 'The Blair Witch Project', however, you'll probably be bored.  Poltergeist feels like a popcorn family movie that had a few scenes added to market it as horror.  The effect, I'm afraid, is not good.

Still, however, do NOT like the parents smoking drugs with their 3 kids in the house.

I am VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE DVD.  Where are the extras?
No interviews with the remaining cast, no deleted scenes, story on film or effects , etc.  Just a lame thing on poltergeists.  Will NOT even waste my time watching that.

140760,4,0792833201,"""Poltergeist"" is one of my favorite horror pictures and I just introduced my 18-yr-old niece to the film with this blu-ray edition.  She found it very scary and was stunned it was only rated PG (considering the year it was released).  The picture and audio quality of this edition are both wonderful but, as noted by other reviewers, there are no real extras.  Because of all the behind-the-scenes drama I have a feeling it will be a very long time before we see an edition which includes some really meaty extras.  The book was nice, and had a few facts I wasn't aware of (the change from an ""R"" rating and the use of real skeletons on set...eww!)

Be aware, however, that like all previous versions the really severe edit between the family kitchen and the neighbor's house is still there - I don't think there can be a clean copy anywhere in Hollywood if this is still going on.  I know it supposedly has something to do with Pizza Hut being dissed in the scene, but since it was one line I really think they could've muffled it and kept the complete scene instead of cutting a big chunk.

This is a classic, highly entertaining horror movie and well worth watching again.  If you have an older version of the dvd (or even the vhs tape), now is a good time to upgrade it to blu-ray.",1227398400,12,1285,4.3924050632911396

I know Blu-Rays often are criticized for the lack of extras, but I must specifically comment here on the PQ and AQ.

I absolutely love this film, for its storyline, characters and visual accomplishments achieved for its time period. I did not expect a quality transfer such as this one, when I popped the disc in. I purchased this at Target yesterday which had it at a price comparable to Amazon's, after tax, and with a temporary price reduction.

I use a 42"" Panasonic Plasma, Onkyo 605 receiver, Panasonic BD30K Blu player and Paradigm Speakers, on this particular set up.

The picture is amazing! There are some areas where there is a bit of noise in the sky shots over ""Cuesta Verde"", the housing development. However, other than that, for a film that is 26 years old, the picture and sound are stunning. The colors really pop in this edition, and the sound during the paranormal phenomena is spectacular. Blacks and detail are very rich and the sound is thunderous when it should be, but even throughout the film, as it needs to be.

The Digi-Book packaging is a neat little perk, as it adds some history, production notes and intewresting little tidbits. Although these can be found on the net, as well, for the same price and even cheaper than some other Blu-Rays, the packaging adds an extra incremental value.

If you love this movie, the transfer is absolutely worth picking this up! If you just like it, give it a rent. I have 100's of HD DVD's and Blu-Rays, and this is one of the best transfers I've seen, of those films I have viewed. PQ: 4/5 AQ: 4/5. I am taking 1 point off, for the few instances of grain (sky, and one scene where there was a black line going up and down the picture in the film, not my tv), and the fact that the sound was not quite as powerful, as it could have been.

 Where is the theatrical trailer? In the theatrical trailer for the movie, there is part of a deleted scene where everyone is looking at the tapes of the ghosts. They see a black shadow with red eyes and behind it the shadow of ""the beast"".  Diane covers Robbie's eyes and screams ""That thing is in there with my baby!"" Steve has to pull her away from the video monitors. I'm sure there are other deleted scenes as I know there is an outtake. The scene where Diane is forced up on the ceiling was originally shot differently. There was a spider-like stain above her bed that she ended up being dragged across and there was supposed to be more of an emphasis on a ""ghost rape"".  The spider-like stain was supposed to foreshadow what the children's closet ends up looking like. I've seen pictures of this scene with the spider-like stain and I have to say I like the cut in the movie much better. There are also plenty of documentaries that could've been included on this dvd. You can watch the Making Of Poltergeist on youtube. The MGM release at least had an 8 page booklet with production notes and photos! I hope Warner Bros will release a special edition of the movie in the future with a lot of the extras I've mentioned! There's been a long debate over the years of whether Steven Spielberg directed it instead of Tobe Hooper. I know Spielberg helped out as he did with other movies he produced.(The Goonies) Who cares who really directed it. Give the fans what they want!!!!",1214870400,4,1720,4.506410256410256

It starts off with nice shots around the town where everything seems normal, and you can definitely tell Spielberg was directing this. The story evolves around a family in there home, who start to notice strange things happening around there house. At first the wife thinks it's amusing, some of the spirits seem to be playful, until one of the evil ones kidnaps there daughter and pulls her into the in between world.

The family then seek out help to get there daughter back, and all hell breaks lose.

--------

For a movie made in 1982, the visual FX are pretty good. Unlike if Spielberg had of made it today, it would be 90% CGI Overkill.

It's a great film, and just when you think it's over, it starts again and becomes a movie you are really not expecting.

I'm glad I realized now that I had not seen this before, or else I would kick myself. It is a great flick, and I can;t wait till I rush out and hire the sequels.",1213920000,2,1130,4.232558139534884
140811,4,0792833201,"In 1982 Steven Spielberg gave us this enjoyable spookfest; it was directed by Tobe Hooper (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, 1974), and it is definitely a fun thrill-ride. It contains a few truly fright-inducing set pieces, particularly the clown doll scene. Many's the kid who had sleepless nights because of that. Very effective.

From the first glimpse of Poltergeist (The National Anthem heralding the end of television's broadcast day...before most TV was on all day and night) to the last comical scene, you are guaranteed a good time with plenty of chills and thrills. This is not just a good scary flick, it has that magical Spielberg touch. The direction, cinematography, and performances are good. The budget is good, as are the effects for the time.

We meet a family that could be our neighbors. They're normal. Not goody goody, not quirky, but average and typical. Believable. So it's so much more jarring when evil forces enter their lives.
I like Poltergeist. It's got class. It knows when to be funny, and when to scare you. And when you think the supernatural danger is finally gone, it gets even worse.

I have one small complaint about this film. Unfortunately there is a stupid (and poorly done) jump-cut around the 34 minute point where the Mom is showing her hubby the moving chairs; apparently the theatrical release included the line ""I hate Pizza Hut!"" uttered by Craig T. Nelson, and Pizza Hut took issue. (Check any legitimate copy of the film's screenplay and you'll find this dialogue.) Therefore, every video release of Poltergeist, from VHS to dvd, has this ridiculously inept edit which cuts from JoBeth Williams in midsentence to when she and Nelson are on the neighbors' doorstep. It's a disorienting and cumbersome jolt, not smooth at all.
Maybe I'm nitpicking a good film, but they could have cut it at a better point where a character wasn't speaking. Or didn't MGM consider dubbing over Nelson's line with different dialogue? It's done all the time. Oh, well. It's just a little drawback to a perfectly good spooky film.

But even with that peccadillo, Poltergeist is one of the best modern haunted house films available. It's not as chilling as the classic ""The Haunting"" from 1963 (based on Shirley Jackson's wonderful novel). Poltergeist is more of a funhouse ride, and it always satisfies.",1203724800,3,2326,4.9411764705882355
140812,5,0792833201,"Being a huge fan of this 80's masterpiece, I eagerly awaited the arrival of the new DVD, certain it would contain an abundance of special features and extras. I was sadly let down. After the numerous documentaries made on the Poltergeist series, there was no excuse to keep them off of the newly released film. No only did the film NOT deliver the extra features that I expected, but it removed the theatrical trailer that was on the original DVD release. That said, the box was attractive and came with a nice protective cover which was about all the new release had to offer.

Aside from the feature flaws, the film was supurb. The actors were believable and warrented much of my sympathy. I really cared for the Freeling family, which is more than I can say for many characters in the horror genre. The scares were valid and the film brought several common childhood fears to life. One of the final scenes involving young Robbie and his toy clown continues to frighten me each time I watch Poltergeist. Unlike many of the new horror films we see today, Poltergeist is not particularly gory and will appeal to an audience who doesn't relish an abundance of blood, gore, and innards.

Part of what made the film such a great success was the music composed by Jerry Goldsmith who's music was also featured in The Omen. Be sure to check out the sountrack if you enjoyed the music in the film.

I highly reccommend Poltergeist to any avid horror fan or anyone seeking a few hours of quality entertainment. Don't miss this one!",1203379200,3,1524,4.595588235294118
140813,4,0792833201,"1982 was a banner year for Speilberg, who has a production credit on ""Poltergeist."" ET was released about a month after this fine ghost story, and both movies have withstood the test of time. Although the film was directed by Tobe Hooper, Speilberg's presence on the set is undeniable. Craig T. Nelson and Jobeth Williams play ""yuppie"" parents to three children. The youngest, played with cuteness by the late Heather O'Rourke, is abducted by a supernatuarl force and suspended into a ""phantom zone"" somewhere within the confines of the cursed house. The classic ""They're here"" became a well known tagline for the film. The cast is excellent, of course, but perhaps the best of the lot comes in the form of a creepy seer played by Zelda Rubenstein, whose shrilly, infantile voice provides enough goose bumps to last the duration of the film.

Although I can not say that ""Poltergeist"" is genuinely terrifying, it is good fun with a spooky premise. I liked when Jobeth Williams plunged into the pool and the corpses began to surface, and there's a few touching moments, too, especially considering the unfortunate and premature deaths of two of the children in real life. The music is both whimiscal and eerie. This film also spawned two sequels, neither of which come close to entertaining viewers as this offering.",1199577600,2,1315,4.923423423423423
140814,3,0792833201,"Documentaries of real Poltergeists and Hauntings, don't want it. Yeah, we get a full featured ""Real World of Poltergeists"" included with this special edition, but who is Warner Brothers kidding here? This is not Unsolved Mysteries, this is a classic movie. Where is the making? Where is the story of the poltergiest curse which includes death of cast members and some poeple in involed with the movie? Where is the story of Heather O Rourke's sudden death? Where is the controverisal heated story between the director Tobe Hooper and producer Spielberg?  You're not going to get anything about it. No cast interviews, no storylines about the movie's infancy,  nothing about the making of the movie, just another decent documentary about hauntings and poltergesits and contacting the dead which has nothing to do with the movie itself. In all seriousness, there is nothing wrong with the documentary included with the film, but it just doesn't belong here.

As for the movie itself, we know how awesome it is, and yes, it does look like it's been cleaned up quite a bit. Boasting it being digitally restored and remastered it probably true. It's defintely the best looking poltergeist I've ever seen on my TV. The audio even seemed to get an upgrade too. As fans know, this came out 25 years ago in 1982, wow, has it been that long, but amazingly, it has still withstood the test of time as is still considered to be one of the best movies ever made. I personally believe the movie is Spielberg's best, more than E.T., Close Encounters, you name it, Poltergeist is probalby his best work. While Tobe Hooper takes credit for being the director, that's where the controversy starts between Hooper and Spielberg. And I can honestly that's why WB has ignored a full fledged making of the movie knowing the controversy it may spawn between Hooper and Spielberg. But even without the interviews or making of the movie, if you haven't bought this movie yet, now is probably a good time, just don't expect any good extras that have anything to do with the movie.",1199145600,8,2053,4.793785310734464

Although it's a ""little older' now, it still scary. I hate that clown!!!

Little does he know that the owner of the real estate company built homes on top of areas that used to be cemetary plots (he never made arrangements to move the bodies, only the headstones). But this is the least of the Freelings worries. The family is visted by ghosts in the TV where only the youngest daughter hears them. Carolanne (Heather O'Rourke) talks to the ""TV people"", and they somehow leave the TV and dart into the wall of her parents bedroom. Unexplained disturbances follow until the spirits from the TV get nasty. They even manage to grab Carolanne from her dimension and bring her to theirs. As the Freelings get nervous, scared, and angry that no one believes them a group of paranomalists agree to help and tape the occurrences, as long as its not shown on ""That's Incredible"". When things still are happening, enter  Tangina (Zelda Rubenstein) who is a well known psychic. Steven (Nelson) tries to trick her because he believes her to be a phony. As Steven is laughing saying that he was trying to answer her through his mind, Tangina shoots back by telling him sternly that she did hear him and she doesn't like trick questions! Tangina explains that there is a force keeping Carolanne hostage and will not let her go. She calls this thing, ""The Beast"". In the sequel, the ""Beast"" takes human form of a reverand (Julian Beck) who refuses to believe that he is dead.
 The movie is transfered great on the DVD. The only extra is the movie trailer as well as the scene selection. This is a great movie to have in your horror collection.",1193788800,2,2149,4.652631578947369

140820,2,0792833201,"This is one of my favorite movies, and I've reviewed the earlier DVD issue elsewhere.  My review this time is purely for the new DVD reissue which is one of the biggest disappointments I've come across.  Let's start with this ""25th Anniversary.""  The only mention of the anniversary is a haphazardly placed sticker on the outer sleeve. The fact that it was just slapped onto the box gives the buyer an idea of how much thought went into this new DVD.

Then there are the extras.  A documentary about true-life hauntings.  Okay, that's not bad.  But wait - where's the original trailer for the film that was on the earlier DVD?  It's been removed. Did the trailer get sucked into Carol Anne's closet and is being held captive by the Beast?  What purpose did removing the trailer serve?

This is a pointless release.  My advice is to hang onto the earlier release which is anamorphic AND has the trailer and skip this one; there will be another, hopefully better, release someday.  Warner Brothers should be ashamed.",1192147200,119,1014,4.698863636363637
140851,4,0792833201,"Jim Hemphill from reel dot com says it best  ""Unfortunately, given the movie's contentious production history, the DVD contains no commentary track and no making-of documentary--25 years after the fact, the participants still won't talk about what went down on the set"".  Doesn't that make the film more eerie and mysterious with all the talk of the curse behind the movie.

Mysterious things like Dominique Dunne who played the oldest sister who's only movie was Poltergeist and who was choked to death that year by a boyfriend.

Heather O'Rourke who played Carol Ann who only appeared in the Poltergeist trilogy and the same year part III was released died of initially described as an acute form of influenza but later changed to septic shock after bacterial toxins invaded her bloodstream.

Oliver Robins who played Robbie during the clown scene where he is being choked by a clown in his room, something went wrong with the prop and Robins was actually being choked and Spielberg had to rush in to help him.  This is included in the jacket of the original release.

I also read an interview with Zelda Rubinstein that played Tangina on Movie web website a couple of days ago and there is a somber feel of her interview when commenting on the film, this was just a feeling I got.

Jim Hemphill from reeldotcom also points out the clash between director Tobe Hooper (Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1974) and Spielberg who wrote and produced and describes how their styles turn out one good horror film, he makes a lot of good points and I recommend taking a look at his review if your a fan of Poltergeist on Reeldotcom.

Another of Hemphill's points I would agree with is his comment of Poltergeist being ""touching and horrific at the same time"".  I felt the strongest performance was between Jobeth Williams who played Carol Anne's mom and Heather O'Rourke who played Carol Anne it was indeed touching and Jobeth gave a solid performance.  Oscar winner Beatrice Straight also portrays a believable connection with the mother.  Last but certainly not least Zelda Rubinstein playing Tangina with limited screen time and standing at only 4' 3"" tall she gives a big performance and steals the scenes she is in.

I think Spielberg is a genius of a director and can take things to the limits himself but I could feel his influence on this film which Tobe Hooper directed and not in a good way.  It had a happy feel like from E.T. and the music to me just didn't fit.  Although on the flip side the music and effects I'm not in agreement with are the 3 Oscar nominations the film received, so maybe I'm wrong and the effects are just dated and were amazing in 1982.

All the talk about the curse and the mystery is freaky stuff.  I firmly believe what you don't see can be much scarier and your imagination will fill in the blanks with something far worse.  That being said I felt some of the special effects very dated and crossed over into Sci-Fi instead of staying with horror.

Great examples of subtle, effective, and scary moments:  The mother fixing the chairs and turning around and there all on the table: Freaky.  The Clown in the chair and then not in the chair: Freaky.  Carol Anne just sitting and talking to the television at first:  Freaky.  Hearing the voices mumble back oh so slightly:  Freaky.

Some perhaps over the top venturing into Sci Fi and loosing some horror:  The Clown with a different face on it once it attacks, although it'll make you jump initially just a bit over the top and not so eerie.  The tree as a kid was very scary to me but this time around it looked pretty fake and the fact it comes in the window to eat the kid, again over the top.  Some of the ghosts at the end were something I remember seeing in Ghostbusters and the house crumbling up into the ground again Sci Fi ish and over the top.

Without a doubt there were many many moments that were genuinely scary and stick with you and it is a good horror film that should be in every horror fans collection but I felt it could've been so much more in terms of actually horrific.  Maybe Hooper can do his own remake and go to as dark a place as he wants.

To recap you don't get commentary talking about what went down on the dvd but in my opinion it keeps the mystery of the film going.  I recently watched the older version on dvd still available and the picture quality needed an upgrade and to quote Hemphill again ""the gorgeous transfer on this disc beautifully preserves some of the most elegant widescreen compositions and expressive lighting effects since the glory days of Nicholas Ray and Vincente Minnelli.  Along with a few new interesting features at a good price.",1192060800,4,4664,4.566105769230769
140852,4,0792833201,"I just watched this great DVD and had to get a couple thoughts out there.

The only previous version I had of this film was a VHS recording from cable TV years ago - so not the best sound or picture.  This DVD is obviously MUCH better than that!  The anamorphic widescreen and relatively clean transfer are wonderful, as is the remastered sound.  I've always remembered this as an extremely scary movie and parts definitely still made me jump (OMG, that clown!!) and was surprised to see it was only PG (not even PG-13).  Amazing how PG can scare you when done right.

I am one of those who watches extras and am disappointed in the fact that there simply aren't any of real interest or that go in-depth about the movie itself.  However, as others have noted, my main goal is to watch a movie I love so I'll enjoy what I have and hope a special edition comes along in the future (preferably remastered in high def).

Sadly, that glaring edit mentioned by another reviewer about the previous DVD edition is still in this version - and it is glaring.  All I can figure is that the master used was badly damaged at that point and no one has been able to find another copy to use to fix that segment.

Overall, a great movie transfer and a joy to watch again.  I'm glad to have this quality transfer.  I just wish they had been able to fix the editing error and give a look behind the scenes.",1192060800,4,1388,4.296153846153846

140855,4,0792833201,"It's hard to believe that it has been 25 years since the release of the Steven Spielberg/Tobe Hooper masterpiece Poltergeist.  What is even harder to believe is that Poltergeist gets a near-bare bones DVD release to celebrate it's 25th anniversary.  Now before you go off screaming at Warner Brothers, let it be said that first and foremost the audio and video quality of the film has been completely remastered.  Even in a regular DVD format, Poltergeist has never looked or sounded this good from what I can remember.  The one special feature that was included with this release is a documentary on hauntings in the real world that features interviews with experts as well as some of the crew of the film, which is an interesting watch on it's own, but that's it in terms of features.  No commentary track to be found, no documentaries on the film itself; absolutely nothing in terms of looking back at the making of the film.  Not only is this baffling, it's unacceptable.  As for the film itself, Poltergeist still remains a compelling creepfest and one of the best efforts to come from Texas Chainsaw Massacre writer/director Tobe Hooper, even though there are times when the film still feels as if it's Spielberg at the helm instead.  Regardless, if you have fond memories of Poltergeist and don't already own the previous DVD release or don't care much about DVD extras, then by all means pick this up.  However, if you already own the previous release, you might as well keep waiting for an extras-laden edition that may very well see the light of day somewhere down the road.",1191801600,5,1584,4.751824817518248

The picture and audio quality on the disc however is AMAZING, vastly superior to the original disc. I have done extensive comparisons and the first thing I checked was the neighborhood title sequence, which was riddled with dirt on the original DVD. Not so on this new disc!

I was lucky enough to see an HD presentation of the new DVD transfer, via satelite, of ""Poltergeist"" last night (10/4) at my local theater. It was a bit of a dissapointment.

First, the film's original aspect ratio (2.20:1) was made to fit the theater screen (1.85:1), so there was some croppin' going on (it was only noticable in a couple of scenes, but it stil sucks). Second, the film was only presented in stereo and not in surround (this sucked real bad, because I have the original DVD release in 5.1 Dolby & it sounds awesome).

As I sat & watched the film, one thing is very noticable & thats the films age. ""Poltergeist"" needs some film restoration pronto. From what I saw there seem to be a noticable amount of color fade throughout the film. So much so, that when I got home I popped my DVD copy into my player just to double check. This also could be chalked up to the way the film was being broadcast.

The new featurette was also shown after the film & that came in crystal clear. This includes scenes from ""Poltergeist"" that were used throughout. The featurette is pretty lame & if you watch ""Ghost Hunters"" or ""Ghostbusters"", for that matter, you already know the basics.

The major problem with ""Poltergeist"" is that the rights are owned by Warner Brothers & not MGM who released the film in June 1982. That said, I can only assume that any & all special features, deleted scenes, etc. are owned & forgotten somewhere in the MGM film vaults. As for the cast, my guess is either they weren't contacted to contribute for this release or they declined because they were busy with other obligations or declined out of respect for Dominque Dunne (she was strangled to death by her boyfriend on 11/4/82) & Heather O Rourke.

Even with a newly restored anamorphic transfer, the absence of special features is shocking and about as much fun as staring at a blank television screen filled with snow.

I remember watching a Making Of documentary on HBO back in the 80's when they were running this like 3 or 4 times a day and it was excellent showing Spielberg on-set.  What many people don't know is a rarely publicized fact that Spielberg, ironically,  ""ghost directed"" this film over Tobe Hooper providing much of the creative input and decisions that elevated this film above lucrative B-horror fare and making it accessible to mass audiences world-wide.  I would also have like to have seen some new cast interviews and a documentary talking about the alleged Poltergeist ""curse"" that has haunted these films with the deaths of Dominique Dunne, Heather O'Rourke and Will Sampson and Julian Beck from the sequel and to hear what the surviving cast members like JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson have to say and their reflections.  I'd also like to see something in tribute to Jerry Goldsmith's great work scoring the film and something more in-depth with Richard Edlund and his visual effects team creating the special effects of Poltergeist.  I know Spielberg has refused to do commentaries for his films because he believes the film should speak for itself but what about Tobe Hooper who could have had an opportunity to present his testimony about the making of the film.

There is a plethora of material that could-have-been included to make this a first-class presentation and celebration of a great film, not just for fans but for audiences in general.  A film of this caliber should be treated as a historical document that has a legacy and a story behind the production that is always fascinating to be heard.  To give this the bare-bones repackaging with new anamorphic transfer and a generic documentary about the paranormal that I could watch anytime on cable is really doing a disservice not just to the fans but to those who know absolutely nothing about this film and may be viewing it for the first time and are denied discovering the intriguing story-behind-the-story.

It was released in the summer of 1982 when ""slasher flicks"" were soaking up the screams at the local cinemas.  The genius of Poltergeist was that it managed to cram brilliant acting, awe-inducing visual effects, genuine laughs, gut-wrenching frights, and a truly classic musical score into 115 minutes of celluloid without ever resorting to being vulgar or cheap.  An impossible feat for today's horror movie standards.

POLTERGEIST is one of the best horror films ever made, period. For those of you who've never seen it, here's the setup:

An all-American family, headed by Craig Nelson and JoBeth Williams as post-hippie-now-yuppie parents, move into a new house in scenic, idyllic Cuesta Verda, along with three kids and a dog. Nelson is an up and coming real estate agent who's been left in the dark about the VERY hinky circumstances regarding this particular suburban housing project.

Very soon, the house is beseiged by ghosts of the past, monsters that seem to be cut from white mist, gargantuan garden trees, and, well ... an exploding steak. The youngest child, Carol Ann, is kidnapped by the ghosts and kept in a parallel, electronic dimension hidden somewhere behind the screen of their television set. I ask you, how's THAT for originality?

The performances are top notch, the writing is witty and real, and--strangely--the 1982 special effects still hold up wonderfully. Also, it made the PG rating, so your kids can watch it (if they're not subject to night terrors, that is).

There are a lot of rumors about behind-the-scenes difficulties and dramas--some of them decidedly paranormal--that really would have been worth an extra disc of special features. I want that. But the movie is five-star entertainment, in any format.

140942,3,0792833201,"So, yeah it's a bummer that Warner dropped the ball and then decided to kick it across the street for it's 25th anniversary  edition. And by the response by all the other reader reviews there is nothing I can say to add insult to injury. But I will dream about what might have been. First I had the laser disc and on that there was a vintage making of with behind the scenes, interviews etc. I'm sure Warner still retains the rights to it so why that was dropped is a bit confusing. Also on the laser release was a stil gallery. Not important but it did have some nice candid photos of cast and crew. An audio track would have been nice. Tobe Hooper recorded an excellent track for Texas Chainsaw and I'm sure he would have done another one for this along with Craig T and Jo Beth. A couple of nice featuretts would have made sense since Heather O'rourke and composer Jerry Goldsmith have sadly passed and it would have been a nice gesture to pay homage to them since Heather was the movie and Jerry's soundtrack is considered to be his best and a character in the film unto itself. But alas...and so we get a doc on specters that might be interesting and a soundtrack in 5.1. Hopefully the picture has been cleaned up and remastered but I haven't found any specs on that yet.

140943,3,0792833201,"This is a five star movie, don't get me wrong. It is one of the best modern horror films I've seen in my lifetime partly because it happens in a normal suburban house to a normal suburban family. In fact, the house in the movie looked very much like the house I was living in when the film was released in 1982. That's what makes it so scary - there are no teenagers on a roadtrip, no spending the night in a haunted house, etc. Just a normal family going through the motions of their normal lives when one day those lives are turned upside down by forces they not only don't understand, but didn't even believe in until they ripped into the reality of their world. The ending is completely unexpected and I won't spoil it for you if by chance you've never seen it.

However, if you just bought or are planning to buy the older edition, I wouldn't say ""If I'd only waited"" and take it that hard. It doesn't look like Warner Bros. did enough to this film to warrant a new edition. The following is the Warner Home Video press release on the extra features:

""Presented in Anamorphic Widescreen with its soundtrack remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby 2.0 this 25th Anniversary Edition of Poltergeist also includes the ""They Are Here: The Real World of Poltergeists Revealed"" documentary in 2 Parts: ""Science of the Spirits"" and ""Communing with the Dead"". Also on the disc is the Theatrical Trailer.""

So there it is. Only one disc and no commentary track is mentioned, which to me would be essential for a new edition to be worthy of a double-dip. Thus my rating is 5 stars for the film, 2 stars for the planned new edition (mainly because I've come to expect so much more from WHV). Since I weigh extra features heavier on a special edition than the film itself, I come up with a total of three stars for the new 25th anniversary edition.",1187481600,5,1843,4.430678466076696

Warners is usually so great at their releases: why even BOTHER with this? More double dipping to come?

Then it picks up with the disappearance of Carol-Ann.  Who could forget the classic lines, ""There, here!"" and, ""Go into the light, Carol-Ann.""?  Also, how many scary movies are out there that are well-done where no one dies?  ""Watcher in the Woods"" is another great example of creepy without vulgarity or death.  The sequels are cheesy, leave out the character of Dana (the actress was murdered after this movie was made), and betray the plotline of this movie.

140970,4,0792833201,"What makes this work of Mr. Spielberg's so great is not so much the ghosts and monsters, but the powerful theme that corruption and deception transcend life and death. We meet the Freelings. While Steve and Dianne have their faults (like smoking pot), they are reasonably good parents. Steve shows himself to be a good real estate agent. (He is effective without being obnoxious or pushy, and he is responsible for most of the sales in the area.) One great thing about this movie is that we have a fair amount of time to meet the family and get to know them before the horror begins. Soon afterwards, we start to see objects in the house moving. (Granted, it is strange that under the circumstances no one seems to have mentioned it before, but a movie only has so long to put together a plot.) While nothing really drastic has happened, we get the impression that these moving objects are just the start of something. Later, Caroline (the youngest of Steve and Dianne's 3 children) disappears. But they can still hear her voice. The skeptical (but desperate) Steve and Dianne go to supernatural experts for help. (Drastic situations will make non believers a bit more open minded!) Well, we see more and more ghosts. (Some of a monstrous nature.) And along with Steve, Dianne, Dana, and Robert, we may be asking: 'Why?' The psychic who comes in may be of some help, but her facts are far from straight. At one point she falsely claims that the house is 'clean.' Respecting those who have not seen the movie, I will not give away the ending. But I can safely say that Mr. Spielberg shows us that these horrors are the result of some real down to earth corruption and deception. (Poor Steve UNKNOWINGLY played a part in it.) It would seem that the genius Mr. Spielberg gives us monsters for show, but then reminds us that our own sins of dishonesty, ambition, and moral games are the true horrors in this world. Thank you Mr. Spielberg for raising this point so well. As the great Shakespeare said in his ""Hamlet:"" 'Foul deeds will rise, / though all the earth overwhelm them to men's eyes.' (""Hamlet"" 1.2.281-282).",1177027200,,2114,4.625
140971,5,0792833201,"Poltergeist (1982) was the first film I saw in theaters that truly scared the bejesus out of me.  I remember the event distinctly, as I tagged along with my friend Martin (we were both twelve at the time), who was a real horror aficionado (he was the only kid I knew who had his own subscriptions to Fangoria and Famous Monsters of Filmland), really having no idea what I was getting myself into...co-written and produced by Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark), and directed by Tobe Hooper (The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Lifeforce), the film stars JoBeth Williams (The Big Chill), Craig T. Nelson (Stir Crazy), and Heather O'Rourke (Poltergeist II: The Other Side).  Also appearing is Beatrice Straight (Network), Dominique Dunne (The Shadow Riders), Oliver Robins (Airplane II: The Sequel), James Karen (The Return of the Living Dead), and Zelda Rubinstein (Under the Rainbow).

On the surface the Freeling clan would seem your normal, middle class, American family unit living among the suburban splendor of Cuesta Verde Estates.  There's the father Steve (Nelson), mother Diane (Williams), and their three children Dana (Dunne), Robbie (Robins), and youngest daughter Carol Anne (O'Rourke).  Life proceeds normally, that is until Carol Anne begins talking to the static that appears on the television once the broadcast day is completed.  This is soon followed by strange phenomena (inanimate objects moving of their own accord and so on), all of which seems to be localized within the Freeling's home.  It's all harmless enough, that is until the old, gnarled tree outside Robbie and Carol Anne's bedroom window tries to eat a family member, followed by an unseen entity absconding off with Carol Anne into another dimension of reality (while no longer present in a corporeal sense, her parents can still communicate with Carol Anne through the television).  Unable to comprehend the situation fully Diane and Steven call in a parapsychologist named Dr. Lesh (Straight) in an effort to get their daughter back, who then, in turn, after witnessing the extreme paranormal activity firsthand, brings in a diminutive, clairvoyant troll named Tangina (Rubinstein), who's something of a cross between E.T. the extraterrestrial and Yoda, only a lot less adorable.  Once on the scene Tangina reveals Carol Anne has been taken by an extremely powerful and malevolent spiritual entity, one that covets Carol Anne life force dearly, so much so it has somehow managed to transverse its own plane of existence into ours in an effort to shanghai the cherub faced little girl.  A plan to recover Carol Anne is formulated, and is successful, but soon the real nightmare begins as the aforementioned malignant spirit pulls out all the stops to reclaim that which it lost...

As I mentioned earlier, this was the very first film I saw in the theaters that really put a good fright into me (the first film I saw that truly scared the hell out of me was Halloween, although I saw that on video tape).  In watching the film last night I thought it odd that the film was released with a `PG' rating (back then there was no PG-13 rating), but apparently it was going to be rated `R' until the filmmakers appealed and got it changed.  I do remember there being some public concern at the time that this film was unsuitable for the likes of me and my peers given the frightening nature of the material, said concerns eventually redoubling after the films Gremlins (1984) and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) were released, both of which were ultimately responsible for the creation of the `PG-13' rating we've all come to know and love.  Regardless, I'm just glad I was in the right place at the right time to see this film in the theater as I did, as it was one of the more memorable experiences I've had during my misspent youth.  Watching the film again last night I find I'm able to appreciate it much more than I did when I was younger, specifically in terms of just how well the film was put together.  The character development alone is really amazing.  The first sequences feature the Freeling household at night, as the family dog wanders the house looking for things to eat.  In following the dog, we see all the family members, while they slumber, the last being Carol Anne.  Whether we realize it or not, we've just gotten a large hunk of exposition through a relatively simple and efficient visual manner, which is definitely a Spielberg trademark.  Spielberg co-wrote and produced the film, but it's also believed by many he was directly responsible for much of the visual appearance, with Hooper basically overseeing the mechanics of shooting that which he was instructed to shoot, by Spielberg.  It's also believed Spielberg, who was making the family friendly E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) around the same time, refused to take more credit than he did specifically because he didn't want people to associate such a terrifying feature with his touching, fantasy/adventure drama.  This seems entirely plausible, as I do believe Spielberg is something of a control freak, and if he didn't like the way things were progressing under the helm of Hooper, he most certainly would have intervened.  I suppose it doesn't matter all that much as the end result was a truly frightening and memorable film, one that will linger in the recesses of your mind long after viewing it...the special effects, provided by Industrial Light & Magic, were spectacular, and still hold up well some twenty five years later, although I will admit the face removal scene looks a bit goofy now.  As far as the performances, I thought they were all wonderful, especially in terms of JoBeth Williams, who provides an incredibly strong female lead.  I've read some complaints the performances weren't realistic, but really, who knows how one would react in such a situation?  To me, it was all the characters could do to hold themselves together during their ordeal.  They knew their daughter was still alive and relatively safe (for the time being), and their focus was on trying to get her back.  Everything else here worked for me...Jerry Goldsmith's vibrant and appropriate musical scoring, the level of development of the various characters (both primary and secondary), the pacing, the scares, the revelations, the ominous sense of something malignant, the spectacular finale, it all adds up to a remarkably entertaining feature, one definitely worth owning.

The picture on this DVD release, presented in both widescreen anamorphic (2.35:1) and fullscreen (1.33:1), looks sharp and clean, with minor signs of age present (I did see some dust specks in a couple of scenes, but nothing overly obvious).  The audio, available in Dolby Surround 5.1 in English, and Dolby Surround stereo in both French and Spanish, comes across strong.  Regrettably, there really isn't much in terms of extras other than subtitles in English, French, and Spanish, along with the original theatrical trailer.

By the way, this film was followed up by a couple of sequels, Poltergeist II: The Other Side (1986) and Poltergeist III (1988), both of which were fun, but unnecessary, at least in my opinion.  Also, Warner Brothers has hinted at a special edition, 2 DVD set, anniversary release in the works, so if you haven't purchased this film on DVD yet, you might want to hold off.",1169596800,9,7373,4.97233523189585
140972,5,0792833201,"Books are usually better than movies. The same can be said for this one, but not by much. The book added some much needed depth that the film should have used. Another level of creepiness, this time seen from the other realm and it's ghosts.

The film did a great job of keeping it's viewers creeped out with all the horror, ghosts and kidnapping of a Carol Anne. Good special effects, even for an early 1980's film. The crawling meat, the guy ripping the skin off his face, and the climactic ending were very well done. Poltergeist is one of my all time favorite horror films.

I enjoyed the acting immensley. Heather O'Rourke was such an extremely cute child. I can still see her cute image in the Rams football helmet as she slides across the kitchen floor, as she is asking for pepperoni pizza. Fun stuff. JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson played the distraught, frightened parents. Their chemistry together was very believeable.

Tangina plays a huge part in the book, unlike the film where she appears only at the very end, and is only there because she was asked by the ghost hunters. The book has Tangina constantly dream about the ""other side"" and it's ghostly occupants. She eventually sees 5 year old Carol Anne lost in this other realm, and the dreams takes on another level of realism for her. She know understands that the little girl must be rescued. To make matters worse, she knows that she must confront the guardian of the realm; the beast. A creature who wanders the Freeling family home regularly without being seen. Very cool creepy visual.

I was freaked out on many occasions reading ""Poltergeist"". The part with the beast and describing it's thoughts and how it is filled with a venomness hates really got to me. The battle between the beast and the psychic Tangina in the other realm is epic. There is even a part in the book where the beast buries his horns in Tangina's eyes. Wow! It would have been great if the film, even slightly, delved into the other relam.

Bottom line, both book and film are great. Both are highly recommended.",1169510400,,2065,4.615803814713897
140973,4,0792833201,"Directed by Tobe Hooper (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), written and  produced by Steven Spielberg, this film has excellent credentials and doesn't disappoint.

The potential gory excesses of Tobe Hooper have been reined in by Spielberg (although there are still some grisly moments- I'll never feel the same about a midnight snack again!!), so we are left with an absorbing and emotional story acted out brilliantly (Jobeth Williams and Graig 'Mr. Incredible' Nelson in particular).

The effects are very 80s and don't look too good now, but the strength of the film is its grounding in domestic reality and, for once, the viewer can identify with an ordinary bunch of people and feel afraid for them, rather than just not caring which of the super-pretty teenagers is going to get eaten next.

At times I thought this could be a Disney production for kiddies. The acting was pretty lack-lustre.

140977,4,0792833201,"Admittedly, there are some truly frightening scenes in this classic shocker from Steven Spielberg, who co-wrote and executive produced and acclaimed horror director Tobe Hooper.  Spielberg's influence is certainly evinced in the family-oriented theme, and the attempted wholesomeness of the ghastly goings on.  Hooper's flashy style helps in establishing the movie's overall creepiness.  But in viewing this film some 20 years after its initial release, it almost seems to be a parody of itself and its imitations.

There are times when it seems Spielberg holds back, not wanting to be TOO scary; he in fact argued with the ratings board to get the PG rating over the proposed R.  (There was no PG13 at this time).  The special effects of the beast are pretty routine compared to today's.  The gibberish that also explains the beast is pretty contrived and even diminutive Zelda Rubinstein's presence as the psychic seems to be a caricature of all the mediums we've been exposed too since.  The cast tries gamely but some of their dialogue is just too trite (especially with Beatrice Straight's character).  Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams try gamely and one can't fault their interpretations.  Ironically, the two daughters in the film suffered tragic deaths:  Dominique Dunn, the older daughter, was murdered by her boyfriend the year POLTERGEIST was released and angelic little Heather O'Rourke succumbed to abdominal stenosis some 6 years later.  POLTERGEIST is certainly better than most of the horror fodder out there today, and it does have some scary moments.",1160956800,4,1571,5.2151394422310755

I remember watching it first in theaters, then on VHS. I never have seen R-rated movies, because I happen to think that you can experience fright without gore, romance without nudity, grittiness without 4-letter words. Just consider Alfred Hitchcock's classics, like the original Psycho, to see that it's suspense and the threat of doom that really count, not spattering blood and severed body parts. To answer another reviewer who said this film isn't for true horror film buffs, perhaps he's right. The reason this film was so popular is that it plays well on common fears, rather than simply showcase mayhem. The ending of the movie, where the family battles the demonic forces holding their daughter captive, is a bit over-the-top, but overall this is a good thrill ride that's also tasteful.

Poltergeist is still one of my all time favorites.  I bet the practice of relocating cemetaries was common back in the day but now I think people are more aware of respect for the dead.  In this movie the construction companies' greed led to this families house to be haunted by many ghosts.  I love the story here and the movie is still fun to watch.

The Movie: It seems that Carolanne's life force is confusing the spirits who are lost in between here and heaven.  They think that the allumination her spirit sends out is the real light and that is why they seem to be haunting her.  Well another presence (The Beast)does not want those spirits to make it to the real light so that presence uses Carolanne to restrain them from traveling to that light.  This family goes through the pain of losing thier daughter somewhere in the house.  Paranormal researchers are called in to investigate the unbelievable event.

Unlike that film though which is creepiness galore, this film is a bit more streamlined with memorable spookiness. With Spielberg you'll get kiddie friendliness although how this managed to pull off a PG(apparently hard fought) is beyond me.

The film can accurately be described in one sentence: a family tries to get back their daughter after she's abducted into the TV. There's nothing else really besides the occasional thing that goes bump in the night that happens to have teeth or can move around. Usually these kind of films don't have much of a plot anyway but we're not looking for novel-like twists and turns, just a good scare or 2.

The film contains many memorable moments such as the classic line ""they're here"", and probably the fastest facial surgery you'll ever see(which to be honest I think Stir of Echoes ""borrowed"" from). Not to mention the film had a great pace. As co-star Heather O'Rourke(Carol Anne) said: ""The first one really kept you going. It was exciting. Well, after you see it a lot of times, it isn't so much. But the first time you see it, it really jumps you."" No arguments here.

Unfortunately, that very same actress was part of a sad duel tragedy as a rare disease ended up claiming her life at age 12. It's really sad to see her quotes on IMDB since she obviously would've loved to pursue acting as a career. The other tragedy was co-star Dominique Dunne(Dana), who was killed in 1982.

Now hopefully I'm right but I hear there's going to be a Special Edition soon and it sure needs it. There's literally 4 menu options, the only bonus feature is the theatrical trailer. We need commentaries, making-ofs and retrospectives. It's a well-made horror film without being outright scary. It's more like a fun kind of scary, if there is such a thing.",1138406400,3,1962,4.73900293255132
141047,5,0792833201,"Is the film slightly cornball? Yes, and forgivably so.

The fun and fascination erase all shortcomings.

The little girl who sees spirits that the family can't. The shocked team of paranormal investigators. The small psychic with big ability.

Infused are Speilberg type moments of humor. Like the college investigator who brags about filming a toy truck moving across the floor... in time lapse, the ""event"" took several hours. At that moment, the bedroom door to the missing girl is opened... and all items in the room are levitating and flying in cyclone fashon. Cut... next scene, with the lead investigator holding a tea cup... rattling as her hand shakes. Brilliant!

A young niece of mine once said she thought the film's ""effects"" were ""cheesy.""  Well, this girl grew up in the ""lord of the Rings"" era. The effects were spectacular for it's day, and the misty, vaporous ghost manifestations are VERY effective! The ""beastly"" manifestations at the end of the film are truly terrifying.

The musical score is masterful, composed by the late, great Jerry Goldsmith.

Not a ""realistic"" horror movie, in any sense of the word... but it's engrossing.

Lord knows The Exorcist is still scary.

A bunch of modern CG effects wouldn't save this film because it's got too many FX already! Throwing a bunch of skeletons, skull animatics, wormholes and what-have-you at the characters doesn't make a movie scary; careful pacing, appropriate music, dialogue, and cinematography do.

But when Spielberg and Tobe Hooper got together to make POLTERGEIST, it was destined for great things.

First off, the acting is top notch (Craig T. Nelson, JoBeth Williams, Oliver Robins, and Heather O'Rourke are all superb) and there are no actors in this movie who underplay or ""overact"" their roles. The family is right on key and so are the rest of the characters. The special effects are not over the top and the scenes of supernatural nature will surely frighten you (this stuff does happen in real life, make no mistake). The suburban setting is particularly more memorable than some big prestigious mansion. It's not the typical place to find supernatural lurkings and so it works on a much deeper level than, say, ROSE RED (which I still like).

The story centers around a family moving into a brand new home in a beautiful neighborhood that seems so quaint and idea for family life (the house actually belongs to one of the crew who worked on the film). Little do the Freelings know that their new idea home sits on an indian burial ground, and that messing with holy soil won't win any points. After the family settles in, we see all these strange and creepy events taking place, whether it be the stacking of the chairs in the kitchen, or Carol Anne sliding across the kitchen floor while dad watches in disbelief. All the supernatural occurences are splendid, but terrifying at the same time. The events begin to get worse, with Robbie nearly getting eaten by an old and very scary looking tree, and then Carol Anne swallowed into the unknown by the light from the closet. But one of the best sequences has to be the clown that almost pulls Robbie under the bed. You already knew from the beginning how nervous he gets with that clown, but then his fear is completely realized in that sequence. Zelda Rubenstein comes into play as the likable Tangina, a psychic with the power to help the Freelings get Carol Anne back. The first time you see the monster in the movie, it's not as scary as the unexplained events...but it still creeps you out when you see it. The ending to the film was very funny, but you'll like it. The tv was one of the ""unknown gateways"" to which you could hear Carol Anne, but not know what was happening to her...well that last bit where the tv in the motel room is shoved off was actually amusing, but you'll understand why they did that.

POLTERGEIST remains one of the strongest horror flicks of all time. No doubt about it, it remains one of my top ten favorite horror movies of all time with its strong cast, superb visual effects, and effective storyline.

This is the film that must be seen in a theatre and on a big screen.  Definately a ""lights out"" film.
 Please don't let your young children watch this one.

 This film directed by Tobe Hooper and the screenplay written by Steven Spielberg, Michael Grais and Mark Victor, based on a story by Steven Spielberg, was a total surprise and is a word-of-mouth hit.  I saw the film in 1982 not knowing what the film was about.  I just simply saw the advertisement in a magazine and went to go see it at night.  I never heard of the word, ""poltergeist"" before and didn't even know what it was until I saw this eye-opening film.
  So that others are surprised too, I will not reveal the special effects or most of the plot of the film.  It must be seen from the very start to the very end.

The movie begins with the tv channel sign-off of the National Anthem playing and  the snowy picture.
 Remember: it is not your tv set. It is just a close-up scene in the movie.

  It appears to be a normal middle-income tract of modern homes in the town of Cuesta Verde, California (it's actually Simi Valley, California and Agoura Hills, California).
  The Freelings are a normal family in every way. Diane, 32, (JoBeth Williams), is the wife and mother of three who laughs with and loves her husband, Steven (Craig T. Nelson) is the husband and father. He needs to try and keep an open mind. Dana (Dominique Dunne) is 16, the teenage daughter, Robbie is 8 (Oliver Robins) the nice son who likes Star Wars (1977) and is full of wonder, Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke) is 5, the youngest daughter who likes, Tweetie, her bird. Sweet and innocent is every way.
 Steve is the best seller in his real estate company. His family loves the house they live in.
  The loving parents put their young children to bed. A huge storm is passing by causing lightning and thunder and that worries Robbie.
  A Strange, unexplainable phenomenon is about to happen.

  Good, strong ensemble cast. I paid to see this movie again and again in 1982.

  Also in the cast: Beatrice Straight, Dirk Blocker, Michael McManus, Virginia Kiser, Lou Perryman, Beatrice Straight, Richard Lawson, Martin Casella, Zelda Rubinstein, James Karen, Robert Broyles, Sonny Landham.

3 Spacial Features.

Oliver Robins had a real scary incident during a scene with the clown doll. Steven Spielberg thought he was just acting and even told him to ""keep going"", but not until he saw Robins face did he realize the boy was really in trouble. Spielberg finally ran over to Oliver and released the puppet off of him.

  Dominique Dunne was at home October 30, 1982 rehearsing with actor-friend David Packer for the ""V"" The Miniseries (1983).  Her former boyfriend, John Thomas Sweeney who was very abusive to her, came over and dragged her outside, strangled her and left her brain dead. David Packer called the police. The police did arrive and John Thomas Sweeney was arrested.
Dominique Dunne was removed off of life support 5 days later. She was 22.

  Lou Perryman died April 1, 2009 at the age of 67. He was murdered with an ax in his own Austin, Texas home.  He played ""Pugsley"", a pool construction worker, in Poltergeist (1982). He was the one tasting the food at the kitchen window tasting the food.

 Julian Beck died September 15, 1985 after filming his scenes in Poltergeist II: The Other Side (1986). he had stomach cancer. Age: 60.

Will Sampson died June 3, 1987. Complications after surgery from a heat & lung transplant. Kidney failure. He really was a native American Indian Shaman. he was in Poltergeist II: The Other Side (1986).

Heather O'Rourke passed away February 1, 1988 during production of Poltergeist III (1988). Intestinal stenosis and Cardiopulmonary arrest caused by septic shock. She was 12.

141080,5,0792833201,"Here we go.  This is the story that gave me my life-long fear of clowns and creepy-looking trees with faces, when I was misguided enough to prove myself a ""big boy"" to my older sister oh so long ago.  She got me good with this one.

Widely regarded as one of the most troubled, cursed, and overwrought productions in the history of Hollywood, ""Poltergeist"" was -- in a way -- Steven Spielberg's swan song to being a legitimate horror director.  Extreme fans of this film often wonder when a Special Edition of the movie will make it to DVD, with loads of tasty extras, deleted scenes, and making-of documentaries.  Answer: probably never.  I know it ain't gonna happen anytime soon.  Too much controversy and on-set secrets that wish never to be brought to public light.

The film itself: steadfast competition for Spielberg's other venture that same summer of '82 -- ""E.T.""  I think we all know which got the more attention.  In the Editorial Review is an interesting hypothesis abut how the two films might reflect polar opposite memories for Spielberg in suburbia.  Nice idea, it could have some truth.  But I like to think of Spielberg's ""Poltergeist"" script as the final dissertation to a horrendous bout of private paranormal research.  (The antithesis to this may be ""Always"".)  Alright, let's climb the rollercoaster...

The Freeling Family (name importance: the culture of Steven and Diane's past: the hippies; and how they become prisoners in their own home) wakes up late one night to the littlest daughter Carol Ann speaking into the television static of a disconnected station.  Seconds before, while ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" bellows the last commercial of the night, the camera lens is literally up against the TV monitor, close enough to trace every pixel, inviting us to look THROUGH THEM...  Nothing too serious to start.

Several unrelated instances succeed that, most of them sort of humorous (silverware bends on its own, a milk glass shatters, the pet bird dies, etc.).  But the strange things begin to grow in frequency and in power (levitating chairs, Carol Ann makes mention of ""the TV people"") until the spirits from the television flat-out invade the house -- shaking it to its very foundation -- and abducting Carol Ann into a netherworld portal placed in the child's closet.  They're tricky bastards, too.  Not above creating a fatal diversion.

Obviously unable to cope with something so fantastic on their own, the family solicits the help of University Paranormal Researchers (Dr. Lesh, Bryan, Marty) to not investigate the spirits in their house -- but to find a way through them to get Carol Ann back.  They don't care about the haunting (they do, but...), but their little girl is SOMEWHERE inside the house.  I swear, if anyone wants a reference subject on how to be not just great but IDEAL parents... emulate the Freelings.  I would show this film in a child-rearing class in a heartbeat.

Real helps seems to arrive with a rather potent clairvoyant, Tangina (Zelda Rubinstein), who maps out and enacts a cross-plane rescue mission to pull Carol Ann back to this Earth, and thereby ""cleaning"" the house of demonic infestation... or so they think...  Spielberg literally breaks Hell out of the ground in the final 15 minutes: an effects free-for-all that launches carcasses at the family as they scramble madcap for the open road, culminating in a hair-raising, spine-shivering implosion big enough to swallow the house.

If this is not Spielberg's most cohesive script, it is assuredly one of his smartest.  The consistencies in research I've done on my own are (unintended pun) dead-on (cold spots, peripheral motion, globules, loud growls and bangs, etc.).  But I just adore Tangina's monologue about the nature of ""death"" and the subsequent facts of WHY the spirits have taken the girl: there is an implicit purpose.  (A chief detail just skimmed over in dialogue is that Carol Ann was born INSIDE the house, thereby amplifying her lifeforce to the restless spirits that occupy the ground beneath them.)  In the writing... was Spielberg trying to create the coolest set of parents in the world, or what?  Even if he wasn't trying to, I think he pretty much did.  Oh, who cares if they smoke joints before bed?  That makes them all the more relatable to me, because, though they are bonafide family people, Steven and Diane are still hippies at heart.  They're all too human... facing a truly inhuman adversary.

Jobeth Williams was nominated for an Oscar for her role as Diane Freeling and she was robbed.  This is fact.  Want proof?  Observe the extended reaction shot Tobe Hooper (this is what the man's famous for) puts on her during Tangina's monologue mentioned above.  That look on her face represents PRIMAL, HELPLESS FEAR (not seen since the original ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" back in '74) strong enough to freeze the very tears on her cheeks.  Her entire embodiment of Diane Freeling is acting of a transcendant caliber.

Future Oscar-winner Stephen Hunter Flick's sound design will shake your bones.  The dead silence in the house, Diane working up some nerve, to look insi-- A HURRICANE SCREAMS AND RAGES INSIDE THE ROOM--!!  Hoo, boy.

""Poltergeist"" (a German word translated as ""knocking ghost"") is one of those rare entertainments that goes beyond its category.  Sure, look at the front box, and you'll slide it into the Horror section.  But this film's heart, what this ghost story is *about*... is the impossible lengths good parents will go to to protect their children.  (Upon Diane's first face-to-face encounter with The Beast: ""NOOO!!  DON'T YOU TOUCH MY BABIES!!"")  Diane breaches the afterlife for her daughter without so much as a backwards glance.

A genuine and deserved staple in the ""American Horror"" canon, ""Poltergeist"" is a madhouse frightfest, a wrenching family drama... and just one helluva good time at the movies.",1114473600,3,5895,4.981576253838281
141081,5,0792833201,"For whatever reason, this film is an amazing reference point in cinematic history. Whilst Tobe Hooper must have made some significant contributions to the film, I can't help but feel that the film was story-boarded by Spielberg.
In many respects, the film is finding its footing as to how it plays off the innocence of Heather, the Geekiness of the brother, the parental concerns of the ""parents"", and the incoming and gradually pervading malevolence of the spirits that no-one knows about.
In so many ways, the film leaves very many threads loose. And probably, this is why the film can stand up to multiple viewings. There is no resolution for many of the story elements. About the only element that is definitely resolved is how the parents treat TVs forever  after... especially in the last shot of the film.
This is one film that works on its own, but can work well with POLTERGEIST II and the discovery of one set of answers.
However, POLTERGEIST is a scare on many levels, and just works so well on tapping into primal, primaeval forces, maybe even promordial  forces, in life.

141084,4,0792833201,"The original tag-line of the movie gets it right: It knows what scares you.

I have no idea how many times I have seen ""Poltergeist"" now, but it never fails to keep me entertained and it's never left me.  As much as I loved E.T. in the summer of '82, I spent the entire summer wanting to see ""Poltergeist."" One Saturday, we four kids finally did get to see it.  My mother says she has no idea what she was thinking letting my youngest brother, who was 6 at the time, see it but these were the days of G, PG, R and X so PG seemed okay. (Warning, this movie would be a definite PG-13 today, no questions asked.  NOT for young kids.)

It's interesting that so much of the things you hear about the movie are tangential to the plot: who really directed the movie, Hooper or Spielberg? Is there really a curse? Should the scene with the parents smoking pot have been included?

First, I think Poltergeist was collaborative.  There does seem to be a lot of Spielberg in the movie with just a few hints of Hooper (I've seen both ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""'Salem's Lot"" in the past few years and neither of them anticipates ""Poltergeist"" nor does any work Hooper has done since have any real cache.)

The more I watch ""Poltergeist"", the more I enjoy it.  Here are some of the things I've always loved:

--  JoBeth Williams! JoBeth Williams! JoBeth Williams! She is so good and so convincing in the movie.  I was young when I first saw it and Williams wasn't a huge actress at the time, and it only increased the reality of her performance. Some of the best moments in the film involve her character, Diane.  I also love the relationship she builds with Beatrice Straight's character.  If 1982 had been a less competitive year, I think JoBeth Williams would have been nominated for an Oscar.

-- I love how Beatrice Straight and her grad assistants represent the ""rational"": the sciences. The paranormal researcher aren't portrayed as cocky or ridiculous, just very determined until they encounter a force far bigger than anything they've ever dealt with before.

By contrast,  we have the diminutive psychic Tangina (who has now become a pop-culture icon in her own right) who is the spiritual heart of the movie, representing the realms of the preternatural.

I think what makes Poltergeist so good is not that it's horror-movie scary as much as psychologically scary.  As a kid, I think we understood the fears of the young children in the film because we all know of at least one person who was scared or clowns or the tree outside their window or the closet.  When I last watched this film, I saw the movie from the perspective of an adult and it's just as scary.  What can be more frightening to a parent than the abduction of their child? This movie just nails those fears.",1111449600,,2776,4.5230460921843685

Most of us didn't, if I recall correctly.  I've seen it a number of times since, and it still gives me the chills, although ultimately, the whole story is outrageous (especially the ending) and has more to do with creating a movie that will draw a large audience than tell a plausible story of a poltergeist haunting.  That is, if such a story can be plausible.  Still, it is one of the better paranormal-themed movies out there and so if you're into that kind of stuff and for some reason haven't seen it, it's worth watching.",1109548800,,752,4.274647887323944

The DVD itself is pretty much bare bones wise in terms of extras besides offering a great looking picture and a trailer, so hopefully someday MGM will release a Special Edition version of the film that fans have been looking forward to for some time.

For two straight nights, Carol Anne wakes up to the static reception of the Freeling's television set. She seems to be talking to the static channel. Seems as though, Carol Anne is receiving communications from ghosts, located in another dimension, where Carol Anne claims to her parents that, ""They're here"". The next morning, the furniture is being moved around by an unseen force. Now, you would think this particular scene is rather hilarious and you have every to think that it is historically funny. But that night, while in the midst of a storm, an old tree, sitting next to the house, horrifyingly comes to life and grabs Robbie, shattering his bedroom window. Steven and Diane run out to the backyard, desperately trying to save their 8-year-old son. What slipped Steven and Diane's minds is that they left Carol Anne in the bedroom alone. Her bedroom closet opens on its own, where an unseen force takes Carol Anne into the closet. Luckily enough, Steven has rescued his son from the horrifying tree, which is taken away by a mild tornado. Steven and Diane rush back inside to check on Carol Anne. They check the whole house, but cannot find Carole Anne anywhere. Robbie stands in his parents' bedroom, relieved and still very frightened until he hears the voice of his little sister. He looks around and finds that her callings are coming from...the television set.

  Steven and Diane have decided to get their help from three parapsychologists: DR. LESH (played by Beatrice Straight), MARTY (played by Martin Casella), & RYAN (played by Richard Lawson). That night, Steven and Diane try calling out Carol Anne's name, whilst the three psychologists watch. Diane calls until she hears Carol Anne's pleasant little voice. They realize that Carol Anne is inside the house, but through another dimension. Everything goes well as Carol Anne tries talking to her family, until something evil begins chasing her, causing her to lose contact with her family. Dr. Lesh and her assistants spend the night for more activity. One specific occurrence during the night is when Marty decides to get himself a midnight snack. Grabbing a stake from the fridge, Marty consciously watches the stake move across the counter and begin ripping itself apart. Scaring the hell out of him, Marty runs to the bathroom to wash his face. As he washes his face, the light becomes brighter than the sun, scourging Marty's face, where he then rips the flesh right off his face in a bloody mess. But he comes to realization that he was only hallucinating. Moments later, the cameras are turned on and pointed towards Robbie and Carol Anne's room, where something is seen floating down the stairs. Everyone looks up in fright, as the apparition disappears. They roll back the film and watch what the camera had picked up. They find the spirits of poorly deceased people. Seems as though the Poltergeists are the ghosts of people who are not at rest.

  Dr. Lesh has brought in some extra help. The extra help comes from that of TANGINA BARRONS (played by Zelda Rubinstein). She explains to the Steven and Diane about the ghosts they had seen and why they are in need of Carol Anne's existence. The deceased need Carol Anne to help them cross over to the light into Heaven. But Tangina then goes into the evil portion of this whole nightmarish ordeal. There is an evil presence in this dimension with her. This evil being is only a child to Carol Anne, but to the adults, the evil being is The Beast.

  Grabbing rope and entering the kids' bedroom, Tangina, Steve, and Diane desperately try to save their little daughter, while Dr. Lesh and Ryan pull on the rope from downstairs. Diane goes in after Carol Anne, where Steven is horrifyingly frightened by what Tangina had spoken of: The Beast. He drops the rope, as Diane and Carol Anne fall through the downstairs ceiling. Diane and Carol Anne have survived and are doing fine, where the family decides that they're packing up their belongings and moving on out of that house.

  While Steven works for just a few more hours on the night of their departure, as Dana has dinner with friends, Diane is home with Robbie and Carol Anne. While Diane is taking a bath, Robbie is suddenly pulled under his bed by his horrifyingly toy clown. Diane finishes drying her hair, until she hears Robbie and Carol Anne scream. She tries to rush out to them, but she is pulled up onto the ceiling by an unseen force. Seems as though Tangina only cleared out the good spirits, but had seemed to have accidentally left the evil in the house. She makes it out of her bedroom and reaches the children's bedroom, but the beast appears at the door, throwing Diane down the stairs and out of the house. While in the backyard, screaming for help, Diane slips into their empty swimming pool, where the bodies of the deceased suddenly appear from the ground. The Freeling's house was, indeed, built overtop a cemetery. Steven's boss had moved the headstones, but had left the bodies where they were. Diane escapes the corpse-filled pool and enters the house. She makes to the kids bedroom and saves Robbie and Carol Anne as their closet breaks away and becomes the entrance to Hell. As they rush through the house, trying to get to the front door, more coffins pop up, revealing more dead bodies. Steven arrives and freaks, grabbing his boss and screaming at him for the horrible mistake he made. He meets up with Diane and the kids, as they jump into the car. Just then, Dana pulls up and finds the horrifying mess. She takes one look and jumps into the car with her family, while screaming in fear. As they drive off, they house is broken away into the light and all is left is an empty space, where that beautiful house once stood.

  Can you survive the most terrifying poltergeists stirred up by Tobe Hooper and Steven Spielberg? The only you can find out is by watching POLTERGEIST. But be careful, it knows what scares you.",1106006400,,6388,4.776065276518586
141108,5,0792833201,"Every since ""Poltergeist"" was released there has been debate about who influenced the final result more, Director Tobe Hooper or Producer Steven Spielberg.  I personally think the answer can be discovered by comparing Poltergeist to their previous works:  I ask you, is it closer in style to ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""?

All that aside, ""Poltergeist"" is a rippin' good ghost story.  Craig T. Nelson and Jobeth Williams play the parents of a family that unfortunately lives in one wicked suburbia haunted house. The movie develops slowly, giving us time to care about this family.  Mr. Nelson and Ms. Williams are dream parents - cool, funny, smart and devoted to the family and each other.

The kids are pretty typical movie kids and their performances don't detract.

Initially, there are just a few unusual and creepy goings-on.  Chairs move by themselves.  The youngest daughter, played by young Heather O'Rourke, makes out voices that come through the television late at night after everyone else has gone to sleep.

At about the midway point of the film the owners of the ""voices"" start some serious shenanigans in the house and in the confusion, take little Carol Anne hostage.  You're on the edge of your seat the rest of the movie.

Some academic ghost-buster types move in and set up cameras and recorders. Next thing you know, weird things are happening to them as well.

Made before the CGI age, ""Poltergeist"" nonetheless has some impressive special effects.  The story tries to get under your skin.  It doesn't just pick one thing to be scared of.  There is no 25 foot shark or machete-wielding madman.  Instead it succeeds over and over again at creeping you out at everyday objects.  The old oak tree in the back yard becomes a menace.  Toys in the kid's room turn sinister.  The kitchen becomes a fright-hall.

When everyday objects are suddenly turning against you, what can you do?  These are the things the family and the ghostbusters have to deal with while they try to figure out if they can get Carol Anne back.

My first experience with ""Poltergeist"" wasn't watching the movie.  I was in a multiplex, next door watching something else, but through the walls WE were listening to the audience watching ""Poltergeist"" next door shrieking and screaming.  I know I wasn't the only person thinking ""What in the WORLD are they WATCHING next door?""  We stepped out of our movie at the end to see the overhead sign.  We knew this was something we HAD to go see.

We weren't disappointed.",1099353600,76,2528,4.816279069767442

141113,5,0792833201,"Director:  Tobe Hooper
Cast:  Craig T. Nelson, Jobeth Williams, Beatrice Straight, Dominique Dunne, Zelda Rubenstein.
Running Time:  114 minutes.
Rated PG for ghastly scary scenes and some language.
The anticipation for ""Poltergiest"" was imminent.  With ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" director Tobe Hooper teaming with the likes of Steven Spielberg (who has directed such classics as ""Jaws"" and ""Jurassic Park"") and Frank Marshall, it was bound to be a supernatural classic.  The team did not disappoint.  This film is one of the most stylish, devilishly entertaining horror films of the past quarter century, using superb special effects, fine performances, and an elegantly humorous screenplay as a springboard to portray the terror of restless spirits.
The opening scene of ""Poltergiest"" is the most famous, presenting the cute six-year old girl Carol Ann in front of a disoriented television screen.  As the girl turns back to her family, who has fallen asleep watching a television program, she proclaims ""They're here!"", creating the foundation for a tense, roller-coaster ride full of ghoulish thrills and chills.  When the family realizes that their house has been inhabited by fiendish spirits who wish to use their daughter as tool to reach the next world, parents Steven and Diane (played extremely well by ""Coach""'s Craig T. Nelson and the charming Jobeth Williams) must put their faith back in love and use sheer determination to save their family from the evil ghosts.
Some of the most memorable and witty scenes involve the quirky haunted house specialist (played by Rubenstein), which she guides the Freeling parents into a world of unspeakable horrors as they attempt to rescue their daughter.  The musical score by Jerry Goldsmith is evocatively on the mark, using a chorus of children vocalists that not only create a glorious harmony, but add an eeriness to the film.  ""Poltergiest"" is not only a ghost tale, but a film that renders a theme of hope and faith, using a gentle touch that is not found in many horror films.  A magnificent spectacle of stricly original terror, ""Poltergiest"" has withstood the tests of time and is still of one of the best.",1085270400,2,2167,5.145299145299146

I watch this movie so many times and I never get scared of it.  Alot of people out there like it too, only a few think it isn't that great.  Everyone asks me why is this movie PG and I have 2 things to say to that
1. Back in 1982 PG-13 wasn't a rating
2. It couldn't have been R because it has no frontal nudity and rarley and swears.
So, I hope that answers your question.  Anyway, this film even thou PG is not for kids.  It may be a bit to scary and intense for younger viewers.  A part that still scares the heck out of me is when the clown pops up and another part that scares me is when the guy is in the bathroom and he's ripping of all his skin.  It may look a little fake, but what do you expect, it was made 22 years ago.  This movie should be in any movie collectors shelf, even if your not a big fan of horror films cause this movie is for movie likers of the age 9 and up.  So, go ahead and get this movie, it's worth every penny and will remain a gem in any one's shelf.

141155,4,0792833201,"This 1982 horror film is from writer/producer Steven Spielberg, who purportedly gave the director's seat to Tobe Hooper, revered director of the classic slasher flick THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE (1974).  It has been long rumored, however, that Spielberg kept Hooper under such tight reins that POTERGEIST is, in effect, really all Spielberg's.  But regardless of whose vision it may be, POTERGEIST is a very scary and very entertaining movie--a worthy entry in the horror genre.
After its cloyingly honeyed opening sequence, POTERGEIST shifts gears and becomes both a powerfully frightening suburban haunted-house story and an eerie contemporary tale of ESP and the paranormal.  Unseen spirits enter a tract home via the TV and cause some minor spooky mischief, then graduate to more violent and corporeal grotesqueries.  When a little girl gets sucked into the netherworld, psychic investigators and a freaky little clairvoyant are called in to do a little ghost-busting and rescue the child.
Most of the scares are cinematically original and genuinely scary, with many that play upon common (and in adults, buried but extant) childhood fears.  The creepiest of these is a scene where a gnarly tree comes to life and pulls a child out the bedroom window, and a little episode with an evil clown doll is a real spine-tingler, too.
POTERGEIST is a well-planned, solidly structured film that first carefully establishes an unearthly ambiance, then pushes the audience inexorably towards its heart-stopping preternatural crescendo.  Admittedly, the way in which the protagonists resolve their crisis seems somewhat contrived and therefore rather weak, but the film is so well acted and most of it so effectively frightening that the one minor flaw can be easily forgiven.
The DVD from Warner Home Video is a no-frills package, which in this case means you get the theatrical trailer and the option of watching the film in full-screen pan-and-scan or anamorphic widescreen.  But the digital transfer looks very good, and the retail price is quite reasonable, so this is one that undoubtedly deserves a spot in the film collections of all serious horror aficionados.",1079395200,4,2162,5.267441860465116
141156,2,0792833201,"Love the cast, love the ideas, but this movie never scared me over twenty years ago when it came out and it definitely doesn't now.  It felt more like an amusement park ride than a horror film.
There were rumors at the time of its release that Tobe Hooper had been fired or barely showed up, giving control of the film to Steven Spielberg.  I've never heard any follow up to that, but it's obvious that this movie is more of a Spielberg film (cute kids, harmless thrills, constant tracking shots, etc.) than a Tobe Hooper film (think of the dark, mischevious cynicism of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE).  I don't know.
All the whispering scenes drove me nuts.  Did they think the ghosts wouldn't hear them?
The ""experts"" in the story didn't seem afraid of anything and made the supernatural sound fun and fulfilling.  How can you feel any dread when Beatrice Straight and that crazy little psychic are all giddy?

141158,5,0792833201,"A young suburban family's home is taken over by other-worldly visitors who in an act of absolute vengeance, kidnap the youngest daughter.

The best of all screen ghost movies, ""Poltergeist"" delivers non-stop action & spectacular special effect that still manage to look good & spooky even after 20 plus years. The film is able to capture every childhood fear and use them effectively as tools to scare the pants off the poor children, Carole Anne and Robbie (Heather O'Rourke, Oliver Robins respectively) & the parents, Steven and Diane (Craig T. Nelson, JoBeth Williams).

There is the fear of water and in this case, a half finished, muddy swimming pool (or hole in the ground would be a better description) is used in 2 unsettling scenes. The first is when the worried parents, fearing that their child may have slept walked right into the muddy pool, frantically search for her in the dark, slimy waters and the final classic scene during the film's riveting climax which has poor Diane wearing nothing but her PJ's, falls into the muddied waters and is accompanied by a bunch of unwanted swimming companions. Then there is the fear of creepy clowns. This one is especially a bad one since many children and adults alike are already mistrusting of clowns and I guess you have this film (and Stephen King's ""IT"") to thank for this. There is also that fear of that menacing tree (with arm like branches), in front of your bedroom window and that classic childhood fear of monsters in the closet, or underneath the bed. The writers really didn't leave anything out and the films classic tagline ""It knows what scares you"" is fitting.

What I love about this film is the build-up. It all starts cute, with the angelic cherub Carole Anne, walking charmingly down the staircase almost in a trance-like state, and begins talking to the television set. The family soon begin experiencing some mild paranormal activity- glasses breaking, cutlery bending, furniture moving by themselves, the family dog begins to react to a presence in the bedroom etc, and the mother, Diane, at first, seems amused by these strange occurrences. Quicker than you can say boo, the activity turns sinister as a supernatural assault is unleashed and Carole Anne is sucked into a netherworld and the family has to turn to a team of parapsychologists and a psychic dwarf for help. Although the film is bit long, running approximately 114 minutes, and there is a lot of supernatural talk (much of it is interesting though, especially Tangina's speech during the last quarter of the film), ""Poltergeist"" is a film that is paced like a roller coaster ride. Every few minutes or so, something happens, and the climax is one of the most fantastic of any ghost movie.

One of the film's key features is the Oscar-nominated special effects. I know many of today's younger audience who are only familiar with CGI may not realize how incredibly spectacular and intricate these effects really were. Yes, there are moments when the effects show its age. The face ripping scene for instance, although still gory and it remains one of the films memorable highlights, it is clearly apparent the head is fake (although the flesh and blood is incredibly lifelike).  Most of the time, the effects hold up well. The very memorable scene, where that floating phantasm, with its many tentacles, glides down the stairs, in my opinion, reigns supreme as the greatest ghost ever visualized on film, along with the spectacular almost spider-like monster that materializes at the films climax when Diane is trying to save her screaming children.

Another of the films notable factors is the excellent ensemble cast. The performances are solid and the stand-out is JoBeth Williams. She is specially delightful and her performance was Oscar worthy as she does some really nice things here and delivers a strong dramatic performance.  The rest of the  cast delivers in spades - Nelson, Robins, Beatrice Straight, Zelda Rubinstein, the late Dominique (""What's happening!"") Dunne all do their best with the great material and no review would be complete without mentioning the late, angelic Heather O'Rourke. I just have to comment on her unblemished radiance and cuteness and her performance is noteworthy. Considering her age, she must have been no more than 5 years old when making this pictures, she is effective during her key scenes and it is a tragedy this talented little actress died at such a young age.

""Poltergeist"" was originally slapped with an ""R"" rating. The film's producers did not want this (maybe because this rating might hinder the film's success at the box office) and successfully fought against it claiming that the film had no sex, no nudity & no excess violence (to which there is a point since the violence on film is supernatural in its nature and aside from the ghosts plaguing the Freeling's home, no characters actually died in the film -  in real life, that is another story altogether) and I guess the censors backed down. At the time, ""PG-13"" did not exist so the film's rating was dropped to ""PG"". Either way, ""Poltergeist"" remains a visually stunning horror film and combines grade-A special effects with a human element that most horror movies lack. It's an unnerving but remarkable horror tale of things that go bump in the night. Highly recommended.",1076025600,,5332,4.93422519509476

141161,4,0792833201,"Poltergeist, directed by Tobe Hopper, provides a break from traditional horror films.  Lacking graphic violence, this film is instead a psychological thriller, which focuses on the feelings of a family in distress after their daughter disappears.  Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke) is sucked into her bedroom closet, and into another dimension.  Still in the house, Carol Anne is able to communicate with the rest of her family.  The movie portrays the family's desperate struggle to bring their baby girl back into the world of the living.
The scariest aspect of the movie is that it breaks the feeling of comfort.  A home should be a place of safety and protection.  In the movie, ghosts invade the home of this family, destroying any innocence that might exist.  The unsafe atmosphere should frighten, and keep the viewer alert and anxious.  The close, personal relationship one has with his home and family is the root of horror that appears in the movie.
Very engaging and suspenseful, the movie keeps the viewer on the edge of his seat.  It entertains at every level.  It is a psychological thriller in that the family has to live with the fact that their daughter is alive and in their own house, yet they cannot reach her, and it is crammed with action and effects.  Every scene is important and action packed, therefore making the film enthralling and entertaining; the brilliant sequence of events leaves the viewer begging for more.
Made in 1982, the special effects are sub-par for this day and age.  In no way do they detract from the overall satisfaction of the movie, but the ghosts appear like cartoons and the monsters almost seem silly.  For its time, the special effects are top of the line.  Twenty years later, viewers are used to more.
While the movie provides some background information on the characters, it does not tell enough about Carol Anne, and the rest of the family.  Throughout the entire movie, it is difficult to empathize with the little girl while she is trapped because there is not enough time for an emotional connection to be made.  It is hard to feel her pain or grievances, frankly because it is difficult to really care about her well-being.  Although aimed more toward the emotional struggle of the family, a connection with the little girl would have made the film that much more frightening.
While older and more primitive compared to modern day horror movies, Poltergeist is still very highly recommended.  The psychological aspect alone can haunt one's nightmares and leave an overall feeling of fear.  This movie is a must see not only for horror fans, but for all people in general, because of its entertainment value, as well as its ability to scare without blood and gore.",1069718400,,2722,4.852813852813853

The little teenage girls and boys watch psycho and laugh at it, because it's old and there parents said it was scary, and yet they turn around and say movies like They and Feardotcom are scary. No sorry people those flicks aren't scary. Poltergeist is one of those horror gems that seem to be loosing respect. Believe me this is a truly scary movie, but it also tells a story and has spectacular acting, some great humor, and lots of scares and suspense. The film is about a haunted suburban tract home in a development very much like the Arizona one in which Spielberg was raised. Spielberg also cowrote the screenplay, which taps into primal, childlike fears of monsters under the bed, monsters in the closet, sinister clown faces, and all manner of things that go bump in the night. At first, some of the odd happenings in the house are kind of funny and amusing, but they grow gradually creepier until the film climaxes in a terrifying special-effects extravaganza when 5-year-old Carole Anne is kidnapped by the spooks and held hostage in another dimension, and then the psychological horror stuff happens. You feel like these people are like you, and they seem just like your next door neighbors. While it's not nearly as frightening as Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or the original Nightmare on Elm Street, Poltergeist is one of the smartest and most entertaining horror pictures of its time, and remains one of the scariest movies ever made. Watch it alone in the dark, and do yourself a favor, take it seriously, I mean what's the point of watching a scary movie if your just gonna make fun of it and laugh at. Try sitting down and doing that with Saving Private Ryan, and you'll see that an event that was horrifying and horrendous can be the funniest experience of a life time. To enjoy a movie you must view it as it was meant to be viewed, this is a horror flick, and it was meant to scare you. Don't expect anything, just watch with an open mind.

There are three aspects to this film that I would commend to your attention. First and foremost, this movie has heart. (Well duh, it's a Spielberg project!) The family members are well-drawn and well-portrayed, and the love, humor, and tension between them is never far from the surface of the movie. The movie finds its emotional center in the relationship between the mother and the youngest daughter (portrayed by JoBeth Williams and Heather O'Rourke, who, not coincidentally, turn in the finest performances of the movie). One may accuse this film of dipping into sentimentality on occasion where these two are involved, but this emotional core is also what makes the movie tick.
Second, this movie does what I prefer my horror movies to do. There are a handful of moments of genuine Bejeesus-expelling fright, but this is not generally a movie for which you will be wanting to close your eyes throughout. (Which is not to say that this is a fun-for-the-whole-family movie! When it scares, it goes for the juglar. I would definitely advise a PG-13 mindset.) Nor is it a movie that focuses on the adrenalin factor (though the last 30 minutes are quite a rush). For the most part, rather, Poltergeist goes for the chill down the spine, mostly through the fear of things not seen or understood. Here, it succeeds brilliantly, on both childhood and adulthood levels. Zelda Rubinstein's speech halfway through the movie is an example of the latter, as her character Tangina explains to the by-now terrified family members what is happening to their house. Her dialogue may be corny and full of new-age spiritual references, but it NEVER fails to send a shiver down my spine, as she taps into the fear of losing an innocent child to an unknown malevolent presence, and absolutely hits pay-dirt.
What makes this movie particularly chilling is its soundtrack and sound effects. While this movie has been justly praised for its visual effects (though a bit dated by modern standards), this movie is brilliant at getting you to HEAR and FEEL terror instead of just seeing it. Not only does Goldsmith effortlessly weave an beguiling suburban childhood motif with thoroughly eerie and sinister orchestrations, but the sonic images are guaranteed to stick in your head just as effectively as the visual ones. Consider the static from the TV, the earth-shaking groan of a tree, Carol Anne's voice emanating from the walls, the sound of raw meat inching along a countertop, the sound of a flourescent light changing in intensity, even the sound of Tangina's voice... Poltergeists are ostensibly phenomena that create noisy disturbances, and while this movie stretches that definition quite a bit, the noises in the movie are one of the things that keep me returning to this ill-fated house and family again and agaain.",1062720000,3,3074,4.936293436293436

I hope eventually the studio will release a director's cut, or at least a special edition DVD with deleted scenes, documentaries, etcetera. The remastered Dolby 5.1 sound is excellent, but the aging and non-remasterd picture could use some help.

141187,3,0792833201,"I don't know about you, but I seek for some degree of realism in the movies I watch. Realism becomes even more crucial if horror movies are at stake; because nobody can get engaged with phony horror scenes. I constantly watch horror movies, and bought 'Poltergeist' on an occasion, with great expectations, since it was directed by Spielberg. But I am very disappointed with the production, as it stands out as a black mark among Spielberg's great works. Why?
The whole notion of becoming one with television, receiving messages from 'them', talking to 'them', and  then after all scaring people by some strange forces is totally meaningless. The use of little children with blank faces is effective in that it exploits strange feelings inside us. However, I do not think that the little girl in this movie succeeds in that. Special forces, moving chairs, sudden tornados are all a part of this movie.
I believe that Spielberg had done a far better job with his Jaws series. And believe it or not, I felt more tension when I was watching those, and not 'Poltergeist'. If you like to see things that do not occur in the normal life, than please go on, and see 'Poltergesit', for you will not be disappointed.",1053820800,2,1207,4.720379146919432

The development was built on an old cemetary, but the bodies were never removed.  Also, the Freeling home has been invaded by a strange para-psychological presence.  Strange and unexplained occurances begin to take place.  At first, the occurances are minor, such as items sliding across the floor, but eventually, the occurances begin to get much more scary in nature until finally the Freeling's youngest daughter Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke) is captured by the supernatural forces and placed in another dimension.  The family can only hear Carol Anne's voice through the TV.
The family solicits the help of a parapsychologist to help them get their daughter back.  However, the presence has also sensed the efforts to retrieve Carol Anne.  Each member of the Freeling family must summon up their inner strength and put their fears aside in order to help Carol Anne.  Finally, Carol Anne is rescued and the parapsychologist declares the house as ""clean""; but is it?

141212,5,0792833201,"""Poltergeist"" is the result of an inspired pairing of Tobe Hooper and Steven Spielberg, who brought out a scary shocker of a horror movie.  It's the story of the Freeling family, living a solidly upper-middle-class life in a solidly upper-middle-income tract suburb that just happened to be built over a cemetery plot that houses the remains of some very disgruntled ghosts.  Funny things start happening, innocuous at first; remote TV signals get scrambled (the guys are sitting around watching the football game and find Fred Rogers singing ""It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood"" at them instead), then chairs start zipping around on their own and floating in the air, and it's all great fun for a little while.  But then the ""TV people"", as little Carol Anne calls the spectral figures that seem to inhabit the family Sony, get nasty, and Carol Anne is kidnapped and transported to an otherworldly dimension.  Time to call the neighborhood ghostbusters.  A trio of parapsychologists enter the premises from the local university, only to have the pants scared off them by the ghostly invaders.  An expert is needed, and arrives in the pint-sized form of Tangina, a medium who is more than a match for any old ghost.  Carol Anne is rescued, and the ghosts vanquished...or are they?  Papa Freeling wisely decides to get his family out of there, and calls in the movers, but unwisely, they decide to spend one last night in the house, and hoo-boy... turns out those ghosts were just biding their time.  The resulting shenanigans literally raise the roof.  Hooper knows how to work the horror to the max, and sometimes it gets not only hair-raising but stomach-churning (witness one of the trio tearing his face off over the bathroom sink) but ultimately we know it's all in fun.  The actors are very good indeed and the three Freeling children, played by Dominique Dunne, Oliver Robins and Heather O'Rourke, are excellent.  But the biggest delight is Zelda Rubinstein as Tangina, a born ham if there ever was one.  ""Poltergeist"" has sense enough not to take itself too seriously; it's a delicious concoction of shivers and laughs all mixed up into one great fun package.",1046563200,4,2173,4.904371584699454

This time Spielberg challenge us with a house that has a lot of paranormal disturbances. The victims are JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson and his kids, specially the little daughter who is capturated by the ghosts.
We get really scared with some scenes in the kids' room with the alive tree attacking. We even get a pause when the ghostbusters leaded by Beatrice Straight and a midget woman appear.
The final attack is particularly frightening, with all that difficulties of getting out of the house, but it can't get out of my mind the  time the midget said ""This house is clean"". Too early to say that, I think--
One thing that also confuded me was JoBeth Williams being so young and having already a 17 year old daughter!

141216,5,0792833201,"Poltergeist is one heck of a fun movie ride. Steven Speilberg and Tobe Hooper undoubtedly created the best ghost movie, and made it extremely hard to beat. Although recent ones have almost succeeded (e.g. The Others, The Sixth Sense), Poltergeist still remains number one.
 Speilberg, co-writer, tells the story of a normal, suburban family who begins to notice their house is becoming a little haunted. When their youngest daughter disappears into the house, they call upon a group of psychologists to help them with finding their daughter and relieving their house of the evil inside. This story is amazing on film as we watch the Freelings see the ghosts do tricks with chairs to becoming more sinister with clown attacks (Personally, one of the creepiest scenes in the film).
 What made Poltergeist even better is the chemistry that was found in the entire cast. The family of the Freelings seemed so real. It's not hard to believe that they are an actual family. Jo Beth Williams and Craig T. Nelson are actually lovely (Weird choice of word, but it fits) as the loving parents, and their show of emotional range was right on. Heather Rourke, who played Carole Anne, is an amazing actress for her age, and handles everything with quaint little charm. The remaining of the cast were all wonderful, fairly developed, and you cared about their outcome in the movie. I must mention Zelda Rubinstein. She played the little, creepy psychic and her part added some nice humour while adding creepiness to the film.
 Sadly, WB has given us a bare DVD. Only the trailer is present within the dvd. There were rumours that a special edition was coming, but they were scratched as WB denied them or either scratched their idea. But I'm happy with the movie on DVD as it is one of the best.
 The best, indeed. Poltergeist is my #1 pick for ghost / haunted house movie. If there is ever one that succeeds it, then it's going to be mighty darn good.",1036800000,6,1938,4.707964601769912

141219,5,0792833201,"Meet the Freelings.  They are your average likeable suburban family living in an average suburban neighborhood living out the perfect suburban dream.  The father works as a real-estate agent, the mother is a happy homemaker, and the son and two daughters go to school.  On Sundays Mr. Freeling has his male buddies over to drink beer and smoke cigars while they watch the football game on TV.  On weekdays the kids gab and feud before going to school.  The kids have a great room filled with toys and posters.
But all is not as it seems in the Freelings' suburban paradise.  When little Carol Anne Freeling starts hearing voices coming from the television set and odd occurences start happening, the Freelings realize that supernatural beings have invaded their house.  And they're malignant.  Soon, the Freelings' suburban dream turns into a nightmare when little Carol Anne is kidnapped by the beings and held in a different dimension.  The Freelings must enlist the help of a trio of parapsychologists and a psychic midget if they are to get their daughter back.
This scary, thrilling horror film was co-produced and co-written by Steven Spielberg who also conceived of the story from an episode of the Twilight Zone.  Though Tobe Hooper is listed as the director, Spielberg seems to have had a David O. Selznick-like influence over Hooper.  Therefore, I do consider it to be a Spielberg film.  Indeed the film feels very Spielbergian.  There's the suburban setting, a story that deals with ""aliens"" (not extra-terrestrials), the child abduction, the mother who embarks on a quest to save her child.  All these elements have Steven Spielberg written all over them.
Besides being scary, the film manages to be quite funny in several place.  There's the scene where Steve Freeling and his neighbor feud with their remote controls, the scene where Diane Freeling is caught by her son smoking a joint, the scene where Steve accidentally knocks over his slimy boss' car.  These moments do much to keep the film from getting too grim.
The special effects are excellent.  They were created by George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic.  Jerry Goldsmith's score is also very good.  It is sometimes suspenseful and creepy, other times deceptfully lighthearted.
Certain scenes will likely have a lasting effect on you after the film is over.  You may develop a dislike of clowns.  You may also be tempted to get rid of your television set.",1029369600,2,2431,4.953086419753086

141231,5,0792833201,"Steven Spielberg doesn't just make great family films and moving dramas. He also can help make a great horror movie. Of course, he had some help from famed horror director Tobe Hooper. However, make no doubt the hand of Spielberg is all over POLTERGEIST and the movie wouldn't be the classic it is without his guiding vision.
The movie is about the Freeling family, a typical suburban family living in an above average suburbs. Everything about the Freeling's life seems normal. That is until the youngest daughter, Carol-Anne. (Heather O'Rourke) starts hearing voices late at night from the television. She wakens the family late one night to announce that, ""They're heeere.""

141236,5,0792833201,"Next to Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film THE SHINING, POLTERGEIST is one of the very few horror films from the 1980s that has any business being called a masterpiece.  This parapsychological suspense thriller from co-writer/co-producer Steven Spielberg and director Tobe Hooper (of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE fame) offers plenty of chills, thrills, macabre humor, and superlative special effects.
Like a lot of Spielberg projects, POLTERGEIST involves a middle-class suburban family--in this case the Frelengs (JoBeth Williams, Craig T. Nelson), who live in Cuesta Verde Estates, a Southern California development built by Nelson's real estate firm.  One night, however, they discover that their home has been invaded by poltergeists, or noisy ghosts.  Their young daughter Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke), a clairvoyant, seems to be in contact with these ghosts, whom she calls ""TV people"", because they eminate from the family television.  Then the ghosts abduct her from her bedroom via her closet door, spiriting her away to a netherworld somewhere between life and death.
This forces Williams and Nelson to seek the help of a team of parapsychologists, led by Beatrice Straight and Zelda Rubinstein, to somehow get ""in touch"" with O'Rourke.  The unconventional means used to get O'Rourke back from this ghostly storm involve tying a rope around Williams, who ventures right into the middle of ""the light"".  When she comes out magically through the living room ceiling, she has O'Rourke in her arms.  The house is ""clean"", or so everyone thinks.
But in the finale, the ghosts return to exact an even more terrible vengeance on the family.  Earlier, it was revealed by Nelson's boss (James Karen) that all of Cuesta Verde was built over what had once been a massive cemetary.  The climax has tombstones jutting up out of the ground and the swimming pool, plus skeletons and corpses.  Nelson and Williams manage to flee from Cuesta Verde alive, but they are now homeless.
The alleged behind-the-scenes artistic conflict that took place between Hooper and Spielberg does not seem to have affected the quality of POLTERGEIST.  Although some scenes are gruesome enough to jeopardize the film's 'PG' rating (originally, it nearly got an 'R'), the film mostly avoids the worst gory excesses of the slasher movies of the 80s in favor of suspense and special effects.  The greatest element involved is the presence of a family unit an audience can believe in.  Special credit must be given to O'Rourke, whose performance here is one of the best ever put on by a child actor in any movie.
Hooper's excellent handling of the material is matched by the special effects work of Industrial Light and Magic, as well as the superlative music score by veteran Jerry Goldsmith.  Although followed by two vastly inferior sequels and a TV series that had absolutely no connection to it other than the name, POLTERGEIST remains one of the most effectively scary films of modern times and thus comes strongly recommended.",1010102400,5,2997,5.139917695473251

Now there something about this movie usually I look at movies like Freddy Kruger movies and think that they are just the stupitest thing but Poltergiest literally gives me chills the whole movie is eary.

This happens to be a great film in the horror genre. It still astounds me that this film is PG, because if this film was released today, I am sure it would be hard R or NC-17 for intensity. If the MPAA can grill Wes Craven for making Scream too intense, this film will redefine the word for you. This film, I feel might just be the scariest film of all time. There are alot of great horror films out there and a lot of crap, but this film dares to get under your skin in the ways Something Wicked This Way Comes does or The Watcher in the Woods. The mood regresses you into a child state and a child's point of view towards horror and subconsiously we are forced to relive our own nightmares while viewing this film. It begins unforgetably and epicly with the Star Spangled Banner and contines bit after bit building suspense and humanity within the characters and us that by the time the film erupts in a frenzy of terror, we are drained and tired and scared to the bone. Closets devour children so do trees. Clowns attack and drag you under the bed. In the bathroom at night, a feeling comes over you and you feel the need to rip your face off. Demons jumping out of the closet, fathers being told to threaten to hit their children, maggots, dwarf women, etc--image after image is so frightening and yet clouded in a suburben neighborhood trying to lend credence that this is normal. At night in the dark, this film starts strobing on the walls with the flickering tv and puts one in a mood that makes you realize how tame so many of todays horror films are. This film was PG, so was Gremlins and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom--all were oversaw by Spielberg and all were reasons the PG 13 now exists, though by today's standards these films would be R if not NC-17. What terrible times we live in.",997056000,8,1949,4.284552845528455
141251,5,0792833201,"""Poltergeist"" came out the same year as Steven Spielberg's ""E.T."", which is amazing and kind of a plus. Both films tap into the horrors and fantasies that children have. And both take place in a safe, sunny suburbian town. 1982 was, I think, an exciting year for Spielberg. Anyway, on to this movie. It's a scary roller-coaster ride. The ending leaves you feeling the same way you did with ""Aliens"": drained and exhilarated. If there's any horror/scary movie that deals with children being possessed, taken away from their parents, or caught with some supernatural spirit, I'm in on it. There's nothing scarier than that concept which I just mentioned. Recently, the AFI ranked this movie No. 84 on their list of the 100 most heart-pounding movies. You can't go wrong with this movie. It's one of the most entertaining horror films ever, and one of the scariest.",992390400,4,862,4.870748299319728
141252,4,0792833201,"Forget the controversy over who REALLY directed this movie (Hooper or Spieldberg). All that matters is that this one is a classic! If you really think about it, the premise is as hokey as they come (a girl gets zapped into the other-side through a TV and the best route to saving her is through her bedroom closet). But somehow the goofiness is made palatable thanks to brilliant directing and a memorable score by Jerry Goldsmith. I always remember this movie more for the music and it's quotable, sing-songy dialgoue (""Cross over children...all are Welcome...all Welcome""...), especially from Tangina.
The brilliance in the directing shows through in the movie's ability to put such a breathless adventure inside a house. What should have felt claustrophic and flat is instead a movie that's fun, energetic and touching. The performances are top-notch, and the viewer really feels the characters are taking this ""crisis"" seriously.
As good as the directing, acting and special effects are, I recommend seeing this movie more for the music. Never, in my opinion, has Goldsmith been better. He perfectly captures both the innocence and horror of the movie, weaving the two together into a truly memorable score. The tornado scene ranks as one of the hokiest moments every featured in modern horror cinema, but it sure is a wild ride thanks to Goldsmith's urgent scoring of the scene and great editing.
I would forget the two sequels. Part 2 takes itself way too seriously and Part 3 is just plain bad.",988848000,6,1501,4.9603174603174605

Although a bit of Spielberg is noticing at times, if it weren't for the opening credits where they plaster his name on just about every credit that u could possibly think of, there's NO way that any Tom, Dick, and Harry would ever notice that he had anything to do with this masterpiece. Its paced like a roller coaster. It never gets boring from start to finish. That's an HONOR! Kudos to Spielberg for fleshing out such a vivid and imaginative screenplay. Guess some of that JAWS notoriety rubbed off and his head inflated to the size of the Goodyear Blimp. Anyway, the film is scary in every aspect. Although i was surprised that a film with such gore could somehow slide underneath MPAA raters and snag a PG rating. Wow. They musta been thinkin...Hey if Spielberg has this film under HIS belt...why not try to make another JAWS! Except this time use Ghosts and Better f/x to better the monster.

141254,5,0792833201,"POLTERGEIST: (noun)-meaning noisy ghosts. See movie for details.
I saw this movie for the first time back when it was released in 1982. I was twelve years old at the time, and found it genuinely frightening.  Now that I'm older and have seen it many times, it doesn't scare me so much anymore, but it still delivers.  A collaboration between Steven Spielberg (of such films as....well you know!) and Tobe Hooper (director of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre). POLTERGEIST is the only ghost story that I have ever seen that delivers chills, state-of-the-art special effects, and unforgettable (and very believable) performances by the entire cast, yet remains in a class all its own simply because it laces these elements with both humor and warmth.
After living in their brand new house for the last five years, the very close Freeling family starts to notice strange happenings every now and then. Particularly observant is 5-year old Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke as an absolute doll).  At first the ghostly pranks are a little exciting to the family, but soon they realize the ghosts are not simply just playing around, but mean real business.  The POLTERGEIST swings into full force, making it's intentions clear, pulling the family into a living nightmare from which they may not escape.
This DVD edition doesn't really offer many extras, but the picture is the best that I've ever seen (the televised versions that we saw for years were very grainy, even blurred).  An interesting observation that I made was that the theatrical trailer actually shows some extended sequences/dialogue that are not in the film (?).  Maybe we'll be treated to a special edition somewhere down the line.  Followed in 1986 by the sequel POLTERGEIST II: The Other Side, which would've been slightly better had Hooper or Speilberg been involved.",988243200,9,1824,5.0198675496688745

From the opening scene when Carol Anne first talks to the TV to the scary supernatural events that occur later in the film, this film never fails to deliver. The story is very credible and moves along very nicely. Holding it all together is the excellent score by Jerry Goldsmith. His ""Carol Anne"" theme is one of the most memorable tunes of the 80's. A big nod also goes to the ensemble acting by the excellent cast. You never for a moment doubt these characters. Their ultimate goal of finding their girl at all costs is very heroic. I believe the film has been reclassified as PG-13, due to a scene involving illegal drug use and a scene of extreme gore.

141256,5,0792833201,"Hey I saw this movie for the first time ever in the theaters when I was 7 years old, and this movie scared the heck out of me (to put it nicely).  I hated this movie between that and when it hit cable, then I increasingly got not-scared of it.  I just recently purchased this DVD and watched it for the first time in 12 years and to be honest, when you take the spooky and gross out stuff out of it, it's a heartwarming movie.  Plus for me it reminds me of life growing up in the early 80s, since both young kids (Carol Anne and Robbie) are around what my age was then. Based on first hand experience, please do not show this movie to your kid if he's that young.  I went after begging my mom to take me there. LOL Robbie (Oliver Robbins) is a boy who has possibly two of any 8-year-old kid's worst nightmares come true; a tree (or any object that looks mean) coming to life to take him away, and a clown who comes to life to attack him. Carol-Anne (the late Heather O'Rourke) ends up in another void, and her mom finally goes in to get her, to put it simply.

The Freelings are a typical surburban family living in a typical neighborhood until weird disturbances(poltergeists!) occur in their house. The Freelings, not being very smart(I'd move out!) don't really mind these disturbances until their the ghosts attack one night and their youngest daughter is sucked into the TV set!
Getting help from parapychologists(not quite Ghostbusters), they try to get their daughter back. Very scary stuff as the ghosts fight back! The movie as I mentioned still is very scary and packs quite a punch. However, it also shows a mother's love for her daughter and all she would do to get her back. Sentimental stuff.

141279,1,0792833201,"While I'm glad to see that Poltergeist is available on DVD, I'm dissapointed with the studios for not adding of any kind of special features. I would've loved to have seen a 'making of' documentary for this movie. And why not? I know footage of the making of this movie exists, because I've seen some of it on a Spielberg biography, and the laserdisc version. So why was none of it used for the DVD!? It would've been far more interesting than a little 8-page booklet, but that's just my opinion. But MGM and Warner Brothers aren't exactly renouned for special edition dvd's.
As far as the audio and video quality goes, it wasn't that bad. Poltergiest is presented in dolby 5.0, and the picture, available in both wide and fullscreen, was fairly decent, though a little too dark at times.  Unfortunatly, those were the only two things keeping this disc from being a total waste. All in all, Poltergeist is a great movie, but a dissapointing dvd. And with the Warner Bros. version being packaged in a cheap cardboard 'snap-case', it doesn't even have the eight-page insert the MGM version has!
There is some good news though. Warner Bros. is releasing an actual 'SPECIAL EDITION' OF POLTERGEIST in the fourth quarter of 2002 to mark its 20th Anniversary! More good news is that the first R1 DVD of POLTERGEIST II: THE OTHER SIDE will be released at the same time. So, if you haven't purchased this title yet, my advice to you would be to wait until the special edition is released. The current edition offeres nothing more than VHS quality picture, and a grainy, fullframe theatrical trailer.
In closing, I'd give the movie 5 stars for sure, but I'm rating the DVD. I just think one of the greatest horror-thrillers of all time deserves more than a trailer and an eight page booklet. I hope the new version will be newly remasterd, have a good 'making of' documentary, interviews with both Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper, deleted scenes, production photos, conceptual drawings, DTS sound, the whole works.

Kids race remote control cars down sunny streets, and inside the families house, toys clutter the bedroom, and a group of beer drinking men huddle around a football game.  Everything seems in order and peaceful.  Until the plot thickens.  The little girl hears voices coming out of the tv.  When she unleashes them, the family will never be the same.

While the rest of the family is struggling without her, Carol-Anne is trapped in a terrifying place which may have a certain evil presence.  The family does hire specialists to help them.  This includes a midget woman that seems to know all about this.  I loved the way that this movie gave the chills whenever anything remotely eerie happened.

141284,5,0792833201,"In spite of its flaws (and there are a few) this is one of the greatest  horror flicks of all time.  At the same time, I find it difficult to put  Poltergeist in the same genre as other classics like Psycho and The  Exorcist.  That's because Poltergeist is really a strange blend of humor  (both blunt and subtle) and terror.  It's a mixture that seldom works (see  April Fool's Day, among others), but is orchestrated perfectly here.
The  film's opening scene is unforgettable, with little Carol Anne (Heather  O'Rourke) being summoned in the middle of the night by creepy, droning  voices emanating from the television.  The next 30 minutes are rather  light-hearted and jocose as we are introduced to the Freelings, a  middle-class suburban family enjoying a seemingly normal, happy life.  Yet  a threatening backdrop hovers over this little piece of Shangri-la.  As we  bear witness to several brilliant foreshadowing techniques, especially the  scenes with the clown and the tree, disquieted feelings of an impending  nightmare enter our sub-conscious.  And then, almost without warning, the  incubus reveals itself...and true hell commences.  Watch this film and  you'll see how well it plays upon some of the worst childhood fears -- have  you ever been scared of what may be hiding in your closet or under your  bed?  Those fears are likely to return after watching Poltergeist.
The  movie has a fine supporting cast and the special effects (by 1982  standards) are superb.  Jerry Goldsmith's score is both enchanting and  haunting at the same time.  Also pleasing to note is how the producers  managed to make a grade-A horror flick without a single character death.

Somehow, all the magic and atmosphere the movie builds up in the first half  is blown away by the somehow silly-looking skull. But it had to be done  somehow and it doesn't keep the movie from being good. The tree- and clown  attacks are highlights as well as the Parapsychologist's hallucinations  with the meat. The film has a really beautiful photography, just check out  the scene where the boy is on the tree and sees the storm coming on the  horizon. Well done, indeed.

In some of the best dialouge and acting Ive ever seen in this  type of movie, Diane looks back and says ""STEVEN, DONT LET  GO""!...When thinking about this scene, it really puts you IN the movie  and not just watching it.  Imagine how strong this woman was to trust her  husband to hold on to the rope that was dangling her into the unknown. Its  an extremely powerful scene. THIS WAS WHAT THE MOVIE WAS ALL ABOUT.  The  bond between the family members.  One scene immediately after this, is  when Diane gets her daughter and passed back to this world.  Its excellent,  because when they come through they are in a fetal position, and covered  with ""cervical"" fluid like they had been ""REBORN"".  After this point in the movie also, Diane and her daughter Carol-Anne have  an ""air of innocence"" around them.  AGAIN brilliant acting, and  direction.

The plot is excellent: Little CarolAnn Freeling (played by the late Heather O'Rourke)  is abducted by dark, sinister forces through her TV. She has a connection  with them that they want. JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson play  CarolAnn's traumtized parents with deference. Zelma Rubenstein plays the  psychic who does the battle with the mysterious poltiergeist in a constant  struggle between good and evil. What shocked me most with this film was how  real the effects looked and how credible it was. It made me think  ""This could actually happen to anybody"". An excellent ending  which gave perfect leeway for a sequel. Again, a classic ""haunted  house"" film that will NEVER cease in it's power to terrify.",947894400,,842,4.914893617021277
141338,4,0792833201,A typical american family's house gets invaded by ghosts that come out of the television set. Lots of suspence and entertainment that doesn't let down for a minute.

141339,5,0792833201,"POLTERGEIST is my favorite horror movie of all time. This movie is almost enough to actually cause me to believe in ghosts. The movie is very scary and suspenseful, and it manages to pull this off without any kind of  graphic violence. The reason for this is because we come to care about the  characters, and so when they are threatened, we are able to have compassion  for them. Ultimately, this movie is about how love between family members  can conquer over evil.",945475200,2,468,4.602409638554217
141340,5,0792833201,"I remember watching this movie on t.v. when I was a kid.  Then I rented the video one day and there were parts they didn't put on t.v.  The movie made alot more sence.  The acting in this movie by the adults and the kids  is amazing.  I can watch this movie over and over again and never get sick  of it.  That is why I am buying the movie now.  I hate all the commercials.  The only part I thought was cheesy was, when the scientist is looking in  the mirror after he throws up and starts to peel away at his face.  But for  the time it came out (1982)  even that isn't so bad.  Buy this today.  You'll love it.",936057600,,612,3.861788617886179
141358,5,0792833201,"This movie rocks my world.  As a little kid, some of the scenes were quite terrifying.  Now that I'm older, I can really appreciate the finer features like the soundtrack, plot line, and acting.  While this is a purely  fictional sci-fi kinda thing, it seems all-too-real.
The only part I  didn't really like about this flick was the inconsistency of who the  ""TV people"" are.  Did they come into the home from the  television, or were they left there when the father's real estate company  moved the cemetery?  (And how, indeed, did the surveyors, construction  workers, AND pool diggers avoid hitting one of those coffins that springs  up in the end of the film while digging and lying the foundation?  Poltergeists are the least of the Freeling's worries; I smell a CONSPIRACY  THEORY!!!)  The second movie provides a better reasoning as to the spirits'  hovering around the house (and more specifically, to Carol-Anne), and the  third even more so (not to imply that these movies are necessarily GOOD,  just to say they fill in the plot gaps of the original).
Some very good  scenes include the ""mother"" ghost descending the staircase with  the others around her, and the scene just before Diane ""crosses  over"" to retrieve her daughter, tethered on a rope by Steven.  Tangina, laughable and ineffectual throughout ALL the  ""Poltergeist"" movies also has a good scene when she explains of  THE BEAST to the others.  ""He liiiies to herrr...  he tells huh things  onlah a chiiiiuuld could undah-stand....""
Very good movie; some  slight exceptions.",930700800,,1548,4.94140625
141359,5,0792833201,"Surely this wonderfully freaky movie is on its way to becoming a classic.  Heather O'Rourke is an adorable towheaded angel, the parents,(Jobeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson) are cool, pot smoking, laid back, etc. with a  seemingly great relationship. The brother, Robby, is a seemingly typical  older brother.  The teenage daughter, played faultlessly by the late  Dominique Dunne, is the always bitchy, know -it- all.  Special effects are  great, good laughs, tremendous scares, and a kick ass theme song to boot.  Highly unusual all the deaths and accidents associated with the cast and  this movie.  Makes you wonder how close to the truth about the spirit world  this movie might have been.",925344000,,694,5.107142857142857

However, this one manages to actually be pretty good! The beginning is slow, and it's a little slow from there until the end where there's so much happening, it's insane!! Really enjoyed it, definitely recommend it.

I rented it from Prime Video and noticed it was really quiet, even at full volume on my laptop. Disappointed about that because the noises like screaming and the booms and all were very loud, but the talking was super quiet. I had to put on subtitles which where fast so I would be reading what hasn't been said yet!!",1522800000,,675,4.487804878048781
