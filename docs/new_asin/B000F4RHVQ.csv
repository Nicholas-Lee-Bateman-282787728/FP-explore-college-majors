8117438,4,B000F4RHVQ,"This old 1998 movie isn't bad, it's low budget and obviously made to go straight to TV at the time, with bedroom scenes where Kelly Rutherford's character grabs and pull the blanket with her so you don't see anything when she gets up.  Likewise Adrian Pasdar's character does similar things.  Those are the two main actors in this film, like all TV movies they used a current high rating show actor (Rutherford was in Melrose Place at the time) to get the viewers.  She has of course gone on to star in Gossip Girl and other TV shows since this movie.  Pasadar was fairly young in this movie, you're watching thinking I know his face but can't really remember where, well he was in Heroes eight years after this as Nathan Petrelli.  The other actors I don't really recognise from anything but they give the kind of acting performance you'd expect from this kind of budget movie, the prison breaker guy overacts a bit.

Basic plot of this one has a guy who has hidden his past from his now rich girlfriend, has gotten his life back on track working as a stunt pilot while hoping his one helicopter for hire company eventually becomes successful.  Where he would have got the money to become a pilot with his past is never mentioned.  One day he tells his girlfriend he has a booking by someone who wants to look at cattle ranches they might want to purchase.  In flight the passenger pulls a gun on him and tells him to fly to a prison.  The prisoner and his girlfriend know all about the pilot's past and his current sneaking into Mexico flights.  They expect him to take them there, but his helicopter doesn't have the fuel for that and it's not like the police are that stupid they can't find a helicopter when the escapee wants to make a detour first anyway.  Can the pilot make it back to his girlfriend alive?

At first I thought this was going to be really bad, when a guy is shooting at the helicopter than detonates a bomb on board, I was thinking why would have bothered shooting at the helicopter so I was relieved when it turns out that was a stunt movie job and Colt (the main character) says the same thing.  But although The Perfect Getaway is no great action movie or anything, you're likely to becoming across this for a few dollars in a $2 store or something.  If that's the case or even if it's on TV, it's worth checking out.",1473120000,,2344,4.393518518518518

8117442,2,B000F4RHVQ,"Helicopter pilot Colt Erickson (Adrian Pasdar of ""Heroes"") nearly has all his ducks in a row. About to propose to his longtime girlfriend (Kelly Rutherford of ""Melrose Place"" fame), and nearly in the black with his business due to various assignments stunt flying for movies, he's ready to settle down. He thinks he's going on a routine charter flight until a woman (Alicia Coppola) puts a gun to his head and forces him to assist in a prison break. Due to his former juvenile record and past association with the escapee (Antonio Sabato, Jr.), Colt is thought to be an accomplice, and has to use his stunt flying skills to pilot them to safety, while also trying to elude his captors.

Cheesy dialogue and improbable situations are abundant in this underwhelming thriller filled with plenty of too stupid to live moments and considering the protagonist is a stunt pilot, it is pretty light on the stunts. And Pasdar has the perfect voice for silent movies.",1190592000,5,957,4.8
