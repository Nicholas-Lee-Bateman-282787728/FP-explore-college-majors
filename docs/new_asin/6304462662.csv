While there are things mentioned specifically about her, this work is really about all well-educated women who went to college in the early 1960s.  I loved how women would reflect upon things unacceptable now.  One alumna said, ""It would be elitist to say now, but back then, I was honored when they referred to us as 'the cream of the cream.'""  A mother of an alumna said, ""It sounds bad now, but I sent her to Wellesley so that she could become a wife and mother.""  I think those who like this documentary would really like Julia Roberts' ""Mona Lisa Smile.""

Recently, Facebook has made many experience what these Wellesley alumnae experience as they get older and face reunions.  How do those who are childless, divorced, unemployed, infertile, etc. face their classmates who are happily married with children and successful careers?  Later a woman states, ""Yes, I have a Wellesley degree, but how do I compete with men, younger women, and cuter people nowadays?""  This documentary is not a sugary ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"" episode: it speaks of all that feminism has created, but also the areas that it did not resolve.

This work does not treat women as a monolithic group.  It stated outright that Hillary's class of 400 women only had 6 African Americans in it.  It stated that while white women struggled about family versus work, Black women never saw that as an either-or choice.  The show covers a woman who later comes out, although neither she nor the show uses the L-word.  I loved seeing that, but I wish the program acknowledged that even back in the 1960s, there were women at Wellesley who had same-sex desires, AND acted on them.

The work may seem outdated to some as it doesn't mention that Hillary became a senator.  Moreover, it came out far before her unsuccessful presidential bid.  The work doesn't have that material to juggle with how the final glass ceiling has not been broken.",1246665600,2,1948,4.75
