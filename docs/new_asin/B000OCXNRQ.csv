8184395,4,B000OCXNRQ,"My daughter LOVES Clifford. She loves watching this DVD, and I like the ""play all"" option :) It keeps her busy so I can fold laundry or do dishes. It has cute charaters and every story has a lesson. Cute carrying case that she can hold too.",1282176000,,240,4.127659574468085
