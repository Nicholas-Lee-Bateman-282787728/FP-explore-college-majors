6267424,5,B00IK481FO,"Murdoch Mysteries aka the Artful Detective on the Ovation Channel is the best show on TV!!  I love this show it's just great.  Good story lines, superb acting and great scenery.  All around good show - minus all the usual violence. Even though  Detective Murdoch works only homicide cases - the murder is the final result of a truly great script.  Every season is just marvelous!!!",1409616000,64,381,4.712121212121212

6267428,5,B00IK481FO,This series is not always shown on TV where we live.  I received the first four seasons as a birthday gift and got hooked and have bought each season since.  I have even pre-ordered the newest season.  They are an interesting series that give you an idea of how life was in that era.  It is especially nice since the language is not crude.

6267445,5,B00IK481FO,"Clever series, well done and they FINALLY gave Murdoch some cajones!  He's SO smart... just too twit-like in the earlier episodes.

There are 10 seasons (so far) and I'd like to be more accurate on the rating.
The first 6 seasons are streaming (on Hulu) and then the following 4 must be purchased (from Amazon).
When first I began watching this... I was taken by the sets, by the costuming, by the casting, the directing, the writing ... it's rich and wonderful.

What I could NOT figure out is why this Murdoch is such a prissy character!  (If I knew a way to contact the producer... I would have!)  I even asked Uncle Google 'is (this actor) gay'?  SO much time is spent on his pretty boy look... most especially his pretty eyes and amazing closeups on his eyelashes (!) that ... well, it was interfering with the enjoyment of the program.  He is SUPPOSED to be a smart hunky guy.. yet not coming across that way at all.

Evidently I was NOT the first person to have that reaction since the prissiness was (mostly) fixed by the second season.  Murdoch still isn't believable with women... and obviously has great fun when he's with men.  I care not, but the character is NOT written as gay... oh well.

The second season got better ... the supporting characters are wonderful and fully fleshed out and all the surrounding elements are wonderful too.

I've liked it so well that I've actually begun to binge watch and am now nearly through the 7th season.  NO, Julia did NOT get hung... YES, at the last moment he rescued her..... and then DIDN'T EVEN WALK HER HOME?????  (See what I mean about him not being a mench?)

The series is worth watching (in my opinion) just for its cleverness and lusciousness and the amazingly fun scripts that have more plot turns (AND wonderful inclusions) than you might guess at.

I guess if I'd add/change anything I'd have Murdoch STOP crossing himself EVERY time he's looking at a dead body (what??).  I'd LOVE to see him less perfect and with messed up hair... (even the time he was drowning below decks on a sinking ship his hair looked pretty darned good)... and I'd love to see him finally get his testosterone shot so Julia could get the man we'd love her to have!  (The occasional quasi love scenes are .... I guess the word is.. 'vapid'?)

Oh... and, for goodness sakes, have that man take an occasional drink when it's offered!!!!!

ALL the other characters (all of them!), the sets, the scripts (twists and turns) and everything else, makes this absolutely worth watching.

Murdoch?  Cast him in some bromance fantasy and he may shine there.",1485734400,,2588,4.592592592592593
6267446,5,B00IK481FO,"I love this show.  It has developed the characters so much over the seasons.  It stays true to form most episodes, without the monotony that can easily be found on mystery shows.",1485561600,,178,4.53125

They try to give time to each actor's role on the show so it is not just about one or two characters. It is good entertainment and I watch all the seasons. I am trying to find if there is a Season 10. Keep it coming. It is interesting to watch and learn the politics of the day and how it affected peoples' lives.",1476921600,,468,3.9368421052631577

6267577,5,B00IK481FO,"Quirky detective, curmudgeonly inspector and light-hearted constable solve crimes with the help of coroner. It has much of the same feel as NCIS, a murder mystery that doesn't leave you feeling terrified to be home alone (with the possible exception of one episode!). If you watch from season 1 you will get a better sense of the relationships between the characters. They include controversial issues with a reasonably open mind yet with outcomes that are consistent for the time period of the series (late 1800's-early 1900's). Each season is better than the previous.  A pleasant surprise overall.",1470700800,,600,5.185567010309279

6267588,5,B00IK481FO,"This is such an enjoyable series.  Mr. Bisson's portrayal of Det. William Murdoch makes the character seem real.  He's compassionate with the victims of crimes. and very tough on the criminals.  His scientific approach to crime solving makes him ahead of his time.  Constable Crabtree is his student, but George still has a few ideas of his own.  Insp. Brackenreid is the old school cop relying on methods other than scientific in most cases, but he resorts to Murdoch's methods on more than one occasion. There are few fights and definitely no car chases.  I'm looking forward to the next two seasons, then I don't know what will happen, as season 9 seems to be the end of the line.  I hope Acorn will pick up any new seasons.",1469923200,,727,4.589147286821706

6267687,5,B00IK481FO,"Want an entertaining escape to a simpler time? Well, this is one that also provides some light historical references, a good mystery solved with human intelligence and ingenuity. The actors themselves are not as familiar to United State viewers as to their Canadian viewers but become well-rounded and provide insight into the eternal nature of the conflict or individuals trying to fit into the norms of their society while trying to adapt those to better fit their individuality. People who like the cozy style mystery will feel at home and may find interesting historical glimpses: people who like period fiction with romance and humor will feel at home. It is not for those who want action-packed cars chases: horses could outrun the cars at the time.

Personally I came to the series with trepidation about the historical aspect but found myself enjoying the mysteries and the sense of everyone being in some way a misfit in society. It is not the gritty realism of the period that other series have embraced. It has more in common with ""Columbo"", ""Monk"" and ""Murder, She Wrote"" than with ""Whitechapel"", for instance. Maybe the Canadian influence is partially responsible as I can imagine Louise Penny's residents of Three Pines stepping into a time machine and coming out in Murdoch's Toronto.",1461024000,5,1299,5.013888888888889

6267710,2,B00IK481FO,"This series can best be described as corny. It's like the writers took the Angela Lansbury ""Murder She Wrote"" formula of a character who stumbles into contrived and ridiculous situations, and frequently the details of the show feel unbelievably anachronistic, particularly the coroner Dr. Grace character doing the CSI medical examiner-style investigations of things like blood transfusions or studying brain tissue. Seriously.  The acting frequently is stale, like watching animated mannequins. The costumes and locations are decent, hence 2 stars, but the artificial acting and writing just ruin the series.",1456185600,,609,5.766666666666667

6267728,4,B00IK481FO,"The show has lost it's way a little, but is still entertaining. The Gillies-as-Moriarty thing got old quick,  seemingly an attempt to draw out the longest courtship in TV history, and real-life characters such as Edison are starting to do cameos more than being integrated into the plot. In previous seasons that fiction/fact weaving was masterful. Some of the mysteries can be solved so early in the show that it's a bit like the old Murder She Wrote, where you could all but look at the list of guest stars and determine the culprit. Still, the characters are likable and it's better than most of the productions today.",1446422400,2,621,4.75

Detective Murdoch solves crimes circa 1900 using modern day CSI methods that he invents.  The scripts are very good.  It took awhile to get used to the under the eye mascara that the Murdoch character uses but after some time it ceased to be a distraction (it made him kinda funny lookin').,1438646400,,394,4.585714285714285

6267825,5,B00IK481FO,"Fast paced through the 7 seasons I have watched. Detective Murdock, his sidekick George the blustery Captain & two beautiful lady doctors make up an awesome cast. Murdock is not only a clever detective 1900's Columbia style, but is also a great inventor we'll ahead of his time. There r some great storylines of murder & mayhem with interesting real characters like inventor Edison & author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
 as well as fictional interesting adversaries. There is a time where Murdock goes against his own rules & quits the police force because he let an innocent woman go to save her from hanging. He wanders for awhile and then returns to his job determined to win the woman he loves who.after marrying a fellow doctor divorces him. Then the doctor is killed by serial killer & somehow pins the crime on Julia, Murdock's loves
 Murdock saves her & is pledged to end the serial killer's life of crime. Well worth a watch!",1435536000,,928,4.6871165644171775

The characters are like a throwback to the good old days where shows like this one actually HAD characters and weren't just a collection of visual violence and confusion and one-liners. Each character complements the ensemble beautifully: Murdoch as the brainy straight man versus the lovable George and the boisterous inspector, and also vs. Julia, the emotionally daring and risk-taking person.

The sets are so well done. The story plots keep you interested. There is the good mixture of mystery, drama and humor to satisfy all of ones senses. And something that lacks in other series is that there are truly likeable personalities in the show. You know who the good people are. Some shows blur the lines so much that it is hard to actually know who you really are wanting to see succeed. That is not a problem in this Murdoch Mysteries.",1432771200,,605,4.3628318584070795

It is a very different twist on what could have been an over used premise. The insights into the morals and capabilities of the times are fascinating. Murdoch is, of course, brilliant, brave, and true. He often has arguments with his rather Puritan sensibilities, but in the end he does the right and proper thing. The BBC has again triumphed with an excellent series and delightful stories. Keep up the good work!",1431993600,,542,4.776595744680851

6267903,5,B00IK481FO,"I know that very few good series, needing good writing first come along very infrequently. It takes many factors to have a successful show and sometimes it happens when it doesn't seem it should,This is one of those shows-historically interesting, intelligent engaging premises with witty writing, and as well, engaging character portrayals for a police drama in this age of instant gratification and high octane visuals. It has little gritty violence or cheapened language.
In this Season 7, there is promise for Det. Murdoch and his betrothed, Dr. Julian Ogden. Crabtree is slowly getting more responsibility from Det. Murdoch on his cases, he being a simple humorous constable character (although with a good mind for logical detecting) with a pension for an outlandish Sci-fy imagination, (enjoyably gullible) which he portrays convincingly, only adds, once again, to the entertainment of this series.",1429401600,,905,5.425531914893617

Well bumping(or trying to) bump off the inspector is your breast cancer show. Half of us will never watch again, others will slowly fade.

6267950,5,B00IK481FO,"Det. William Murdoch, aka The Artful Detective, is a police detective in Toronto in the 1890s. The other main characters we see in all the episodes are Chief Inspector Brackenreid, Murdoch's boss; George, the constable who works with Murdoch; Emily, the current pathologist and the object of George's affections; Julia, former pathologist now psychiatrist, the object of Murdoch's affections. There are other regulars that we get to know, such as other constables in the station house, a murderer who consistently eludes Murdoch and threatens him... There are many ""guests"", such as Nikola Tesla, Arthur Conan Doyle, Thomas Edison, Winston Churchill, Emma Goldman... The episodes deal with history, new inventions, changes that will come in the 20th century, and always a murder to be solved. You get to know the characters and their back stories. We find out, for instance, that George was raised by a number of ""aunts"" - in a bordello! We watch all of them get older and some of them get fatter! The characters are 100% believeable, brought to life by the incredible actors and the creative writing. I am currently taping Season 8 but absolutely will be purchasing it as soon as it's available. If you're a fan of very intelligent detectives, such as Sherlock Holmes and Nero Wolfe, I strongly recommend that you add William Murdoch to the list.",1427500800,,1347,5.017857142857143

There is something compelling about this series from the very beginning. At first I wondered if I truly wanted to buy the next seasons. After the second season, I was totally hooked. This is not like American television: it is definitely Canadian and has that polite sensibility to it. Love the late 1800s/early 1900s period too!

The characters are engaging, the plots inventive.  And the settings are woven thru with current events of that time period - the first fingerprinting, blood typing, electric lightbulb, motorcar, etc.  And the series is family friendly - no vulgar language, lewd behavior.

The cases are well thought out and the acting is superb.  The attention to details is masterful and is more than the equal of most other crime details.  I would like to see this series go for at least another five years.  It is amazing that some of the TV stations think it is an English series because it is so well done and in other markets it is thought of as being ""good"" American programs.  Whatever the other critics from around the world think, we know that is Canadian product that more than measures up to other nation's productions.",1425427200,,683,4.467741935483871

The writing of each episode never disappoints. The timing of ""the look"", the pun, the abrupt directional focus of Detective Murdoch at a time when Dr. Ogden has other passions on her mind are all priceless. The viewer can't help but love the characters. They are all good people trying to do a good job the way that they know how to do it. The undertones of romance for the dating couples and the married couple interject subplots that keep the viewers always waiting.....and waiting...well come on already! There is always a new topic added consistent with the history of the time which makes the characters even more real.

All of the characters are well-written and well-played by a talented Canadian cast that return season after season.

This turn-of-the-century period series should not be missed, especially by those who like Sherlock Holmes' style whodunits. Highly recommended - you will not be disappointed.

However, this particular episode, ""A Midnight Train to Kingston"" is a rare disappointment.  There are plot inconsistencies, unanswered questions, and completely atypical behavior from the usually competent Toronto Constabulary.  The acting, as usual, is superb, but the actors deserved better writing to support their efforts in this case.",1420588800,,620,6.0227272727272725

She shows up constantly invited or not, and the relationship with Murdoch has turned into the teen age girls silly fantasy. There is so chemistry between them as he had with two previous characters. A shame it turned supersilleous, it was a very good series. The convenient murder of Darcy was insulting. The cops are depicted as rediculous buffoons, it's not well done enough to be amusing, but embarrassing to watch.

Detective Murdoch is fascinated with technology and he implements cutting edge processes such as taking ""finger marks.""  Dr. Julia Ogden is the coroner and she, too, blazes many new trails in her profession.  We get to know the main characters and the supporting characters as they work together to solve crimes.  We come to care about their back stories, challenges, triumphs and relationships.  This series has humor and heart.  An intriguing mystery unfolds in every episode, some of which are chilling.  There is very little gratuitous violence.  Some episodes feature historical persons of the time, i.e., Houdini, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Nicholas Tesla, Andrew Carnegie, etc.  American secret agents and spies make appearances, too.

6268071,5,B00IK481FO,"This is just one of my favorite TV programs. Set at the end of the 19th and start of the 20th century in Toronto, it follows the innovative Detective Murdoch, a lover of science who keeps track of all the newest innovations in technology and attempts to use them and even some of the people involved in their discovery to solve crimes within his city. He is aided by a female coroner, who eventually moves on into psychology, thus bringing in medical advances as well. She is replaced as coroner by yet another young female doctor. Both characters serve to address the changing roles of women and society's reaction to them. In addition, Murdoch has as his boss an older fellow who is not as adept at understanding the new innovations in police work, is sometimes impatient with Murdoch's fiddling with them, but always supportive and awed by them. Lastly, there are several constables to give a bit of levity, particularly one who believes in werewolves, zombies etc. Each character is a favorite and all keep the viewer interested in discovering who the culprit is who is causing problems in Toronto",1420243200,,1101,4.769633507853404

6268083,5,B00IK481FO,"Murdoch Mysteries has everything: it's a historical detective/police procedural, it's quirky science/steampunk, it's costume Victoriana (now moved up into the Edwardian/Belle Epoque), it's rich character drama (with a detailed show ""Bible"" now reaching back 7 seasons), it's a family show with a lot of humor,  it's an edgy show masquerading as a family show, it's period romance, it's stealth politics (feminist/Canadian-US relations/homosexuality...) - good grief, what does Murdoch Mysteries NOT do? There is no show quite like it in the United States, though I would say if you crossed Joss Whedon's light touch with the X-Files and then made that a police procedural set in Victorian Toronto, you might get something close.

Many people assume from the title ""Murdoch Mysteries"" that this show is similar to the British period mysteries seen on PBS. This assumption is wrong. Murdoch Mysteries is paced closer to American shows, and while it has won kudos for historical accuracy (extreme detail goes into the set and costumes) the show has a lot more fun with might have happened (rogue automatons? mole machines? zombies?). And, of course, the Canadians don't have an accent to Americans. During the period in question, Toronto was a thriving port on the Great Lakes, and the show includes some interaction with Buffalo and New York. In short, this is a show Americans can easily get into, and it would be a shame if the ""PBS-sound"" name was the point of deflection.

One more point: Murdoch Mysteries has recently been syndicated in the US. However, the episodes that I have seen (tucked away during very late hours on obscure local channels) have been so savagely edited for commercials that scenes that are crucial for character development in later seasons are missing. Therefore, even if you've seen the syndicated version on TV in the US, I recommend that you buy the DVDs to see the whole episodes as they should be.

Murdoch Mysteries is a huge recommend for me - the first TV show I've truly enjoyed in years. It's unbelievable that U.S. networks missed out on carrying this gem, and thus US audiences have largely remained ignorant of a show that's incredibly popular - indeed beloved - all over the rest of the world.",1418947200,,2235,5.0

6268096,4,B00IK481FO,"I debated three or four stars.  Three, because the plots follow a somewhat rigid line.  Four, because I happen to find the show just, well, relaxing.  One doesn't have to think much, the characters are fun -- esp. now that Jonny Harris has been given more presence on the show -- and there are a few over-arching plots that run through seasons and episodes -- enough to make it interesting.  Also, the historical angle is good, both in terms of how, through the seasons, newer inventions and technologies are incorporated into the police work and social/cultural environment, and we get to meet real-life people, such as Thomas Edison.  I enjoy best when the crew goes off to Newfoundland and films off set -- very nice.  Otherwise, the series is supposedly set in Toronto, and Canada at that time has a different enough history from our own to add a dimension of interest.  There are two sets of love interests -- finally, one seems to have been resolved, just as another breaks down.  The downside, I find, is that some of the ensemble acting team are better than others.  It's pretty clear.  But:  there is humor, there is mystery, there is history, and there is nothing too troubling or violent about this show, so it's just, well, relaxing.

The cast is wonderful, the mysteries are thought provoking and always engender conversation about the time period, the inventions and explorations of the time period which is really saying something. What other television show has one Googling ""what year was xxx invented"" ?  The soundtracks by Robert Carli are delightful and so unique. I classify the music as lite steampunk and adore them, they're always a perfect addition to each episode - I even purchased the Murdoch Mysteries Original Soundtrack Vol 1 to lighten the mood at the office. It's family entertainment at its best; no one has to cover their eyes or be embarassed by the antics on the tv screen. Don't get me wrong, Walking Dead is one of my all time favorite shows BUT we do not have enough quality family entertainment on the tube these days and I for one miss that choice.

6268152,5,B00IK481FO,"The Artful Detective is back for a seventh season and it may be the best yet because it not only blends the Murdoch Mysteries trademarks of ingenious crime-solving with tongue-in-cheek humor but also gives us a deeper understanding of some of the characters.
As in the previous installments, season seven liberally sprinkles historical characters throughout the narratives. Thomas Edison makes an appearance, for example, as do Guglielmo Marconi, Emma Goldman and Andrew Carnegie. Some fictional characters from previous seasons also re-appear (a plus as far as I'm concerned.) James Pendrick is back (and for a change Murdoch is not accusing him of committing a crime) and so is the beautiful con artist Eva Pearce. James Gillies - the arch fiend who previously killed off Dr. Julia Ogden's husband and almost got her hanged for the crime - is also back for a star turn.
I won't give away any plots but I will note here that this season's shows feature (among other things) ax murders, blood-doping, bicycle racing, monsters, kung-fu fighters, and a very engaging homage to another great Canadian television crime show - The Republic of Doyle. Romance is also in the air - and the course of true love does not always run smooth.
If you are a Murdoch fan - and I freely admit that I am - then you will certainly enjoy this seventh season. If you are new to this outstanding Canadian television series, you will not get lost in the narrative because the writers are very careful when it comes to giving viewers enough backstory in each episode to allow them to feel at ease with the principals.",1415750400,,1593,4.817518248175182

6268154,3,B00IK481FO,"I love the series but the soap opera content between Murdoch and Julia is getting to be a little stale.  She is too progressive for him and he does not seem to want to change from his stiff-necked view of life, etc.  The disintegration of the romance between George and  Emily saddens me as to the hardness given to the character of George.  But at least it doesn't have the wishy-washy of  Murdoch and Julia.  The costumes are beautiful and the scenery of Canada is awe-inspiring and makes me want to go to Canada for a vacation.  I hope they get back to the nitty gritty of police work and dispense with all this domestic stuff.  Hope season 8 is better or I am a long forgotten fan. Also, the morgue scenes are getting a bit too graphic for even me.  Let's get back to the seasons 1-5 like the Newfoundland one was.  Beautiful scenery, good mystery and a feel good show.",1415664000,7,873,4.333333333333333

6268170,5,B00IK481FO,"MURDOCH MYSTERIES, SERIES 7.  This award-winning Canadian television series of crime dramas seems actually to have at least some roots in the United Kingdom, as ITV, a British creator of TV material, gets a producing credit.  Its an early-days police procedural, set in Toronto, in the late 1800s, to as late as 1901 that provides a good-humored twist on crime procedurals.  Detective William Murdoch (Yannick Bisson) pushes the boundaries of Victorian-era criminal science using then radical forensic techniques for the time, including fingerprinting and trace evidence, to solve some of the city's most baffling, gruesome  murders. He is a kind, soft-spoken, religious, honest,hard-working and disciplined sort of man, by no means one of the roistering detectives  we so frequently see today. In his work, Murdoch is ably assisted by coroner Dr. Julia Ogden and Constable George Crabtree as he introduces such concepts as finger marks and lie detecting machines. The detective has in this the support of his somewhat doubtful superior, Inspector Brackenreid, though at times, even Brackenreid finds Murdoch's methods - and claims  somewhat overwhelming.

And, even though he is occupied with enforcing the law, Murdoch often crosses paths with famous figures of the time, including, in earlier series,  Arthur Conan Doyle, Houdini, and H.G. Wells, and in the current series, such figures as Thomas Edison, Andrew Carnegie, Emma Goldman and Sherlock Holmes  apparently not always entirely fictional.  The series is based on the popular novels by Maureen Jennings, was seen on public television and on Ovation as The Artful Detective.  The entertainment is available both in streaming format and on DVD.  The box set consists of 18 episodes on five discs, running approximately 792 minutes plus 109 minutes of bonus programming including making Murdoch featurettes and a photo gallery.  And, thank goodness, subtitles, as some of the local dialects of Canada are on display.  I received this as a review copy.

The Montreal-born Bisson, a handsome man, plays the gently pious Montreal-born Murdoch, who crosses himself when he comes to a death scene, and understands that, as a French Canadian in bigoted Toronto, city of the Family Compact, he will never be promoted.  He and the supporting actors around him create an entertaining, warm ensemble. Thomas Craig, born in Yorkshire, whose natives are famed for their blunt, bluff nature, plays the blunt, bluff Insp. Thomas Brackenreid.  The lovely Helene Joy, born in Perth, Australia, portrays Murdochs on again/off again love interest, Dr. Julia Ogden, formerly the coroner, now a psychiatrist, a character who is, unfortunately, somewhat bland.  The same could never be said of the Newfoundland-born standup comic Jonny Harris, who plays the highly entertaining Newfoundland-born Constable George Crabtree with his own native accent, and who seems to be getting more and more screen time as the series progresses: one episode of this series brings him back to his native province, which was apparently not yet a full province back then.  Georgina Reilly, born in the Home Counties, U.K. plays the pretty and lively Dr. Emily Grace, Dr. Ogdens replacement as coroner, and Crabtrees on-again/off-again love interest.

I have previously reviewed Murdoch Mysteries Series 1 and 2 on their respective pages, and loved them.  The earlier series do offer some backstory, but it is possible to pick the production up at any point.  Murdoch is an interesting character: troubled, yet talented, while the interplay of the characters at the cop shop is touching and entertaining.  The turn of the twentieth century environment seems well presented, in clothing, social life, standards, interiors, transportation, the mix of automobile and horse-drawn vehicles on the roads. Highly recommended.",1414627200,19,9463,5.035256410256411

The tie in with historical figures and history.  Love the prospective of Canadian and US interplay.  Cast and characters fit well together.,1413849600,2,302,4.730769230769231
6268182,5,B00IK481FO,"LOVE this show!  This is a GREAT season of Murdoch!  Where Murdoch started off in the late 1890's, it is now 1901 - times are changing & progressing. Murdoch meets up with a couple more famous people of the era. We see the return of some previous characters & suspects. Great shows - very well done. And of course they leave us (AGAIN) with a bit of a cliff hanger.  This season has 18 shows instead of the usual 13. This DVD has some extras on the making of each episode, as well as the music for Murdoch Mysteries, & a ""photo gallery"". There ARE English subtitles for the hearing impaired.  I'm just sorry I'll have to wait another year to watch the next season (I don't have cable or satellite, just DVD's)",1413763200,,709,4.30827067669173

6268190,5,B00IK481FO,"If possible, this charming series just gets better and better. Yannick Bisson's tongue-in-cheek portrayal of the thoughtful, clever detective makes you wish he was the head of a current day law enforcement agency, bicycle and all. This season's adventures include the return of Sherlock Holmes, a tangle with the Loch Ness monster, a presidential assassination and improbable as it seems, Thomas Edison as a crime suspect. Every episode reminds us of the wonders of uncovering clues and solving crimes in an era long before the forensic work of TV shows became ordinary. If you've found that the CSI-NCIS-Law&Order franchises seem a bit shopworn, spending time with Murdoch and his team will revive your enthusiasm. This Acorn set includes 'making of' featurettes for the series, giving an added dose of fun. Can't wait for the next season!",1413331200,5,840,5.1838235294117645
6268191,5,B00IK481FO,"Go back to 1901 Toronto, Canada and visit Police Station No. 4. This is a world undergoing massive changes and science is really coming into its own. I love the series for its tons of comedy. And, of course, lots of murders.

In Season 7 you get 18 episodes averaging 44 minutes in length each, for a total of 792 minutes of wonderful murder mysteries. ""Murdoch Mysteries"" is a hybrid. It's a police procedural, because your protagonists are policemen. But it takes place in a time when forensic science is in its infancy.  So a lot of murders are solved by good old intuition and attention to detail, as is the way in an amateur sleuth series. The historical tidbits are fascinating.

If nothing else, you will keep coming back for the characters. In particular, Constable Crabtree is a favorite, as he lends a lot of the comic touch. Totally sincere and dependable, he also loves conspiracy theories and is such fun to watch.

The DVD/BluRay  boxed sets have 5 discs. The show is presented in 16:9 widescreen, stereo, with English subtitles available. With 18 episodes, I don't have room to give you a synopsis of each episode, but season 7 does continue the ""Murdoch Mystery"" style of introducing new scientific or medical discoveries that were coming to the fore in the early 20th century. Another hallmark of ""Murdoch Mysteries"" is having a true historical person show up in the script. So, I can't resist giving you a run-down of the NEW discoveries showcased in each episode and some of the REAL people who are portrayed.

In addition, I would like to give a nod to the delightful ""Making Murdoch"" featurettes = Bonus Features on the disc sets. Each of the 5 discs has these ""making of"" shorts and they are enjoyable viewing, many times giving background details to the story-lines. After you watch all the episodes on a disc, you'll enjoy watching these shorts. There's a total of 109 minutes of featurettes divided among the discs - a Bonus with a capital B for the viewer.

One question that has not yet been answered for me is just who writes and diagrams so very neatly on Murdoch's famous blackboard.

Episode 1. ""Murdoch Ahoy"" NEW Mouth-on-mouth resuscitation, developed by Swiss doctors, REAL Annie Taylor
In a bonus feature, Eric Conroy, Honorary Captain, talks about the SS Keewatin, the ship on which this episode was filmed. It is the ""oldest surviving Edwardian steamship in the world. There were about 3,800 steamships built between 1900 and 1920, including the Titanic and the Lusitania.""
Episode 2.  ""Tour de Murdoch""  NEW Bike sprockets, Blood doping and Blood typing
Bonus: Jordan Christianson, episode writer, says that this episode explores ""the beginnings of cheating in sports. We started digging around and found that bike racing was the pre-eminent sport in 1900. THE spectator sport."" This may be the time for the beginnings of modern forms of sport cheating, but not cheating itself. I've read about cheating in Roman chariot racing!
Episode 3.  ""The Filmed Adventures of Detective William Murdoch"" NEW Headphones, REAL Thomas Alva Edison
Bonus: Yannick Bisson, who plays Murdoch, says, ""It's an absolute riot filming this episode. I don't think I've ever laughed more in a week.""
Episode 4.  ""Return of Sherlock Holmes"" NEW Facial reconstruction from a skull.
Episode 5.  ""Murdoch of the Living Dead"" NEW Brain surgery lobotomy
Episode 6.  ""Murdochophobia"" NEW Treatment of phobia as other than craziness
Bonus: Jim Lovisek, animal wrangler tells us, ""One of the ways we wrangle a spider is to make sure it's at the right temperature. Because if it's too hot... it runs too quickly.""
Episode 7.  ""Loch Ness Murdoch"" NEW Snow balls, summertime treat
Bonus: Michelle Ricci, writer: ""Unfortunately, we couldn't actually reference the Loch Ness Monster, because it hadn't been sighted, in the way we do today, until the 20's or 30's.""
Episode 8.  ""Republic of Murdoch"" NEW Sexual orientation as in medical study/awareness
In Episode 8 we finally get to meet Crabtree's oft-cited Aunts!
Allan Hawco plays Jacob Doyle in this ""Murdoch"" episode. Hawco is better known for playing Jake Doyle in ""Republic of Doyle"". So for ""Murdoch"" he is basically playing an ancestor of Jake.
Episode 9.  ""A Midnight Train to Kingston"" This is a FABULOUS escape thriller!
Bonus: Paul Aitken, writer, says that it would have been ""such a shame to kill off such a great villain."" So they didn't!
Episode 10. ""Murdoch in Ragtime""
Bonus: Nick Jennings, music journalist/historian explains, ""The Ragtime era, which preceded the Jazz Age, was the 1890's to 1910.""
Episode 11. ""Journey to the Centre of Toronto"" NEW Tunneling machine and ""Hot Dogs""
Bonus: Great historical information. Seismographs were well established by 1901, but scientists still knew nothing of plate tectonics.
Episode 12. ""Unfinished Business"" Think Hitchcock's ""Strangers on a Train""!
Episode 13.  ""The Murdoch Sting"" Great episode! REAL Andrew Carnegie and Cassie Chadwick
Bonus: Inspector Michael Sale, Toronto Police, retired, ""What was lacking then was communication between police forces and even within police forces. ... A person would commit a crime in one jurisdiction, move to another jurisdiction, commit similar crimes, and there's be no link between the two.""
Episode 14.  ""Friday the 13th, 1901"" NEW Special curling shoes and the curling ""slide""
Bonus: This was like a horror movie of a cabin-in-the-woods variety. Hlne Joy, who plays Dr. Ogden says, ""It's a lot of fun. A lot of running and screaming in the woods!""
Episode 15.  ""The Spy Who Came Up to the Cold"" NEW Fountain pen
Isn't the title a great play on words?
Episode 16.  ""Kung Fu Crabtree"" This has a great fight sequence where Constable Crabtree is hand-cuffed to Wu Chang. Chang tells Crabtree, ""Kung Fu is not a word for fighting. It is any skill achieved through diligence and hard work.""
The history given is a little different from what I've read of the era surrounding the Boxer's rebellion.
Episode 17.  ""Blast of Silence""
Bonus: Tom Barnett, who plays Richard Welsh, the man trapped on top of the pole, comments, "" 'There's going to be a little bit of a sway', they said! I didn't really know what that meant til I got up there.""
Episode 18.  ""The Death of Dr. Ogden"" This episode features puzzle/cipher solvers trying to solve a cypher created by Edgar Allen Poe, which had never been solved. REAL In 1840, Poe wrote about cyphers in ""Graham's Magazine"", and offered a free subscription to anyone who could send him a cypher he couldn't solve. Six months later, after solving 100 cyphers, he published two puzzles by Mr. W. B. Tyler to conclude the contest. For many years, it was assumed Poe was Tyler. It took computers to finally crack Mr. Tyler's puzzles. One was finally solved in 1992, and the other not until 2000.

In addition to the making-of bonus featurettes, Disc 5 of the boxed sets has a Photo Gallery. It is a slide show of rehearsal and film stills that takes about a minute to run through.

A very recommended murder mystery series. Light-hearted yet touches on serious stuff, great puzzles and great fun!

Did you know that there was a set of mystery movies that proceeded this TV show? The actor playing Murdoch is different and it's set in Winnipeg. But still very good with lots of humor. A new release will soon be available on amazon:

6268192,5,B00IK481FO,"This is one of our favorite shows. The cast is perfect. Murdoch is a serious detective but also a bit of a science geek, which adds color to his character. Jonny Harris as his sidekick, Constable Crabtree is perfect and brings humor to the show. Thomas Craig is also wonderful as Murdoch's boss. I can't imagine anyone else in those roles.",1412985600,3,339,4.573770491803279
6268193,5,B00IK481FO,I'm hooked on this series. The calmness of Murdock and his mannerisms really bring back the good old days. It is very well cast. I've now watched all seven seasons and awaiting season eight.,1411689600,3,190,4.617647058823529
6268194,5,B00IK481FO,"Awesome 1900-01 sets, props & costumes. Realistically gritty. Multiple plots in this historical Toronto suspense & crime drama. Includes fictional unveiling of [then-new inventions, science and forensics beginnings, and new merchandise.] Murdoch's path often crosses with historic personalities. Charming entertainment amidst suspense. Toss in a bit of romance, and much comedy.
Older episodes seasons 1-6 are combined in a catch-up set.

Season 7 can be viewed as stand-alone, but you DO WANT every episode.

Yannick Bisson's leading role is rejoined with his boss, Brackenreid (Thomas Craig); Crabtree (Jonny Harris, a comic genius) smitten for sexy forensic Dr. Grace (Georgina Reilly) who replaced Dr. Ogden (Helen Joy) who now is a psychologist; & Constable Higgins (Lachlan Murdoch).
Each episode has about a 6 min ""making of"" bonus adding almost as much as the length of 2.5 more features. Added to the 18 episodes in this set, this is a lengthy 5-disc set packed with award winning entertainment. Definitely in my top-10, right there beside Downton Abbey.
