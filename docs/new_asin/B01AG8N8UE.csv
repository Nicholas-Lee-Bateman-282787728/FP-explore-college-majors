In America, I think the medical examiner's office, coroner's office and the police are strictly separate. The coroner's office is an elected position.",1499212800,,260,5.214285714285714
8747259,5,B01AG8N8UE,"I first began watching ""Silent Witness""  when Amanda Burton was the main star. I found myself constantly entertained episode after episode. Now here I am watching Series 19 and am truly amazed after all these years that the  storylines are still fresh - still entertaining. High praise for the producers, directors and writers of this show as well as Emilia Fox, Tom Ward, William Gaminara, David Caves, Richard Lintern and all the host of guest stars throughout these years. There aren't many shows like this one. (For those of you who may not know - Emilia Fox is the daughter of Edward Fox and Joanna David, both well known British actors. She is also the niece of James Fox - another great British actor and the cousin of Laurence Fox who stars as James Hathaway in the superb ""Inspector Lewis"" series.)",1488844800,,807,4.716312056737588
