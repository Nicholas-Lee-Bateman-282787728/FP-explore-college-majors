8225772,5,B000WUY5W2,"This was definitely worth my time as Mr. Corea casually but effectively lays out and demonstrates his attitude and actual process that he uses to compose, improvise and practice his original jazz, taking it from a riff all the way through to getting it down on paper, playing it solo and then working it out with a trio. He makes it look so easy!

This is not an overly technical tutorial, though it is not really a ""beginner"" tutorial either, though beginners could easily gain some valuable insight if they grasp the ""can do, let's do"" attitude and approach Corea lays out so smoothly and logically.

 Corea assumes you have basic technique and basic music theory down. Nevertheless, there's things here that serious beginners can appreciate if they hope to compose their own jazz tunes at some point.

Corea is very comfortable and inviting in this video and gives the viewer lots of opportunity to see his fingers dancing up and down the keyboards as he demonstrates the kind of creative process he apparently follows himself, imagining and fleshing out tunes step by step, with both logic  and intuition.

The lessons on this video are easy to digest and definitely are a valuable addition to the jazz education legacy. Definitely an  inspiring, pleasantly spent hour spent with a clear minded keyboard master.",1311724800,,1315,4.896396396396397
