8258401,5,B0015GPO6S,"Great information about safety presented in a very kid-friendly manner.  Safe Side Superchick is goofy, but the message is clear.  The serious stuff is re-emphasized at the end.  My kids didn't want to watch something educational, but they thought the videos were very entertaining and ask to watch them again.  My kids are 6 and 9.  Not sure how much longer the older one will be entertained by this, but for now, they both enjoy the videos, and I like the message.",1484524800,,466,4.634146341463414
8258402,5,B0015GPO6S,"Great information, although my 8 and 10 year old looked at me very oddly afterward and said, ""we already know this mom!""
I still recommend the purchase. It's good reinforcement. Even though my kids think they know it all, they still sat through the entire presentation. So that means it was entertaining!",1464739200,,304,4.865384615384615

8258404,5,B0015GPO6S,This video is very kid friendly and informative.  My daughter who is 3 and my nephew who is 6 both enjoyed this video.  The kids learn something while being entertained.  I recommend this video to anyone with children!!!!,1274659200,,221,4.7631578947368425
8258405,5,B0015GPO6S,"A really good tool to empower your children to stay safe in todays world.  It really seems to work on their level.  My four year old now seems to really understand what he needs to do in potentially dangerous situations.  He's a little young for the internet one, but he will see this that the appropriate time.",1221350400,,311,4.421052631578948
