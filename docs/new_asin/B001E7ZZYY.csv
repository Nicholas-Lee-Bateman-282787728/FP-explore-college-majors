8297061,1,B001E7ZZYY,"The Snake and the Stallion(A Cobra & Ferrari Dvd) Formerly known as Cobra Ferrari Wars(Not to be confused with the book of the same title perhaps why the Dvd's Name was Changed.)Is a Two-Disc Region Free/NTSC Format(Mine is got it from UK)or All Regions,and is a very in-depth look at a Short rivalry between Ford,Ferrari And Shelby. It is a Must for The Blue-Oval or Prancing Horse Fans and Racing fans in General,I like the archival Period footage which of course focuses on the Car I hate the Cobra,A Ford powered British AC Ace and A Car which I hate but less so the Ferrari(I prefer Ferrari yet I lie that Ford took revenge on Ferrari.)While Shelby is to be admired not just for his wit,intelligence and Business Acumen I cannot be a fan of the enemy camp(Being Oldschool GM and Bowtie/Corvettes Guy).I already knew the story which has been told alot yet a story that is not told on Dvd is that of Jim Hall and The Chaparral. The Dvd has Bonus features which includes Extended/deleted scenes from the original aired on BBC program such as More interviews with other personalities. The Focus is Heavily on the Shelby camp which Is probably part of my dislike if I was not a huge Fan of the other guys I'd give it five stars. The Highlight for me is the Cobra Daytona Coupe on Fire pictured,The Cobra Roadster on Fire Pictured and the Brief,Very Brief(not the focus of the film of course)Footage of the 1963 Corvette Grand Sport(1964 Sebring Race the #2 and #3 Coupes,The #2 being at the start parked,and the #3 Driving away all in it's glory in Color) which is a Car that would have Creamed the Cobras and Ford had not Gm pulled the Plug,there is no mention of how the Cobras got handled at Nassau 63,64. Only Riverside,the Debut of the Stingray/Cobra 62'.The Corvette Grand Sport(GS) Vs. Cobra story needs to be Told on DVD as well,and a book featuring the very brief but interesting rivalry.(There is one such book I have.)I am pleased and have watched the film twice the original and the shortened versions and will do so again and recommend to Ford Friends. I recommend it to anyone.",1415923200,3,2091,4.578666666666667

8297063,5,B001E7ZZYY,Great auto history! Excellent clear video footage of historical races and legends! I was very surprised to see the detail the writer went through for this documentary.,1395360000,,167,5.222222222222222
8297064,4,B001E7ZZYY,"if you are a shelby fan, you have to have this disc, the first disc is great, & the second is only information",1384992000,,110,3.8260869565217392
8297065,5,B001E7ZZYY,This film has been a joy to watch multiple times over.  It is nicely paced and loaded with great footage of the golden age of auto racing.  The film is well made enough that it should even apply to people who aren't Shelby or Ferrari fans and just want a good underdog story.,1378080000,,275,4.169811320754717
8297066,5,B001E7ZZYY,"This is an absolute "" Must Have "" for the Cobra , Daytona Coupe , GT-40 fan ! The interviews are outstanding from the people that were there from the start. I should mention the only small errors I found was when Pete Brock was talking of the 221 cu in truck engine which was the predecessor to the 260 & 289 there is a photo presented of the so-called 221. This photo is not of a 221 but either a 272, 292 or 312 - note the exhaust manifolds cross-over pipe & the 2-lug valve covers for starters. And the other small error is a promo film with Ken Miles shifting gears with the parking brake lever handle in the up or pulled on position, oh well, BUT - From the start of the early days when the first 260 Cobra ( CSX2000 ) awoke the Hot Rod world, on to the race Cobras with full house 380 HP 289 power sweeping the fields. Pete Brock's Daytona Coupes beating Ferrari at Le mans in the GT class for the world Championship , onto to the 427 Cobras that annihilated the Corvette Gran Sports. It's all here ending up with GT-40's dominating Le mans as well ! I review this DVD quite often , it's a no nonsense tell it like it really happened DVD with a cast of people who made it happen ! Thanks To All Involved - 5 STARS !",1320624000,,1221,4.02880658436214
8297067,4,B001E7ZZYY,This is an enjoyable look at the fight for road race supremacy between Shelby/Ford and Enzo Ferrari.  If you are a Cobra or Ferrari nut then you probably need this in your collection.,1320019200,,183,4.545454545454546
8297068,5,B001E7ZZYY,"I am building a ford library on the Mustang and one day while talking with Gayle Brock Peter Brock's husband and designer of the orginal Shelby Daytona Coupe that won the GT class against Ferrari, Shelby's competitive rival. A spark was lite to expand the library to early racing development which started when Henry Ford the Second nicked named ""the Deuce"" tied to purchase Ferrari only for the deal to go sour. Only later on did I fine out that Eno Ferraris nicked named ""El Commendatore"" was actually planning a hoax to draw national attention from the Italian people who's pride in ferrari was a national treasure in Italy.

I started with books on the Shelby Daytona Coupe and moved up the ladder to the famous GT-40 project. Hears the kicker! no matter how much you read. nothing like being their at time when automotive racing history was made by Americans at Le Mans, Sebring, Daytona Beach, left a void were the all the pieces had to come together. Putting a visual perspective with the written word of historians like this documentary was a tremendous help.

The Snake and the Stallion ( previously titled the Cobra Ferrari wars) is a fascinating documentary that puts you were the action is and helped me put the puzzle of the writers word in these books about this subject matter together.
I highly recommend this documentary to any person as ""my self"" researching early Le Mans racing or a true to be Ford racing enthusiast. Sometimes seeing history filmed can mean more than just reading about it . Their are some very good interviews with people who were their at the time these events evolved. ""This is a must have documentary"" for the Ford racing enthusiast and Gt-40 and cobra owner.
