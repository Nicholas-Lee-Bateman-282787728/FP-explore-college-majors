Even if you are not a boxing fan, Split Decision will engage you on the most basic level: we were all immigrants once, but few of us had it this hard.  You will root for Chavez as you watch a man caught between two countries and stopped short from grabbing the title he felt he deserved.  An arrested development tale with a happy ending, this film is for anyone who loves boxing or cross-cultural issues.",1078876800,2,614,4.142857142857143
2039798,5,B00013F2U4,"Split Decision is one of the most compelling personal success stories of the past decade.  You will fall in love with Chavez as you watch this well-done documentary.  There are three stories in one: (1)  the rise and fall and rise again of an American dream; (2) the story of many foreign-born heroes and the challenges that they have in dealing with family and roots that span different worlds - the unknown culture of their parents' world and the culture of their new lives - and (3) the classic success story of determination and hard work.  Unlike many documentaries that only catch part of the story, this one gets the whole thing: having captured the high points by filming Chavez in United States, in Mexico and everywhere that counts.  Split Decision awoke the same excitement that I had when I watched Rocky as a boy, but was much more powerful - because it is a true tale.  I give this DVD my highest endorsement, you'll enjoy it immensely and you will want to share it with your friends and family.  Further, for boxing fans who would like to entice their friends and family who may not have such a great view of the sport, this is a must buy, for it portrays an important human element.  In fact, the recommendation for the DVD came to me from someone who was previously a die-hard anti-boxing fan, now a convert.  I am a boxing fan and I had the same luck in showing the documentary to my wife.  You'll love it, this is a guaranteed winner!",1078876800,,1453,4.46969696969697
2039799,5,B00013F2U4,"Whether you are a fight fan or not, Split Decision is an amazing story of one man split between two countries and not completely at home in either.  Jesus' unforgettable story puts a name and a face to just one of the countless stories of people caught up in the byzantine immigration web between Mexico and the United States.  And if you saw Jesus is his last fight against Erik Morales, you'll know after seeing Split Decision that he has shown the same courage in his personal life as he has in the ring - He fought toe to toe with one of the top five fighters in the world with ONLY ONE ARM for the better part of ten rounds.  I have watched hundreds if not thousands of fights and I have never seen courage like I did then. Whether you love boxing or not - and Jesus is exactly the kind of fighter that will make you love it - you don't want to miss his story.",1078617600,,865,4.106508875739645

8017487,4,B00013F2U4,"If documentary about a champion boxer who was deported for a crime he participated in when he was young.  It is about injustice, but it is really about the character and heart of a champion. I enjoyed this film.",1482278400,,211,4.410256410256411

8017493,5,B00013F2U4,"I've known him personally for about 5yrs. His sister is my mom's friend. His sister usually gives us tickets to boxing events in the Chicago area, his brother usually fights on the fights we attend. Chavez is so humble in person, he usually sits with my family and talks to us about his brother, he never praises himself or tells us about his accomplishments. His sister gave us the DVD with his autograph at a party because she said he liked us and hoped we'd enjoy it. I love it. It really shows how tough and gritty life can get for a Mexican American living in the streets, but it also shows that with a great family behind you things can get turned around.",1261440000,,661,4.338709677419355
8017494,5,B00013F2U4,This documentary is well worth the watch.  It is a good example of what can be accomplished in America against what would seem unsurmaountalble odds.  Reccommend highly for boxing and non boxing fans.,1168387200,,200,5.03030303030303
