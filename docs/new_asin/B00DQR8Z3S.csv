5847900,5,B00DQR8Z3S,My son really enjoys this DVD. He watched the Mission Marvel episode 3 times on the first day we had it. He has asked to watch it the last 2 days as well. He is making his way through all of the episodes. This DVD is well on it's way to being frequently played.,1380844800,,261,3.8518518518518516
5847901,5,B00DQR8Z3S,"Our daughter has grown up with Phineas and Ferb and there was a time I could repeat almost every episode word for word.  Now that she is older she isn't quite as bad about watching things a million times over, but those are memories we cherish as parents!! So when I had the opportunity to review this Phineas and Ferb movie I knew she would love it, and I was right.

The first day we received the DVD she grabbed it and disappeared with it. When I asked her how it was, ""It's Cool, I'm going to watch it again."" So there you have it in the words of a 15 year old but it didn't resurface until I told her I had to watch it and she finally let go of it long enough for me to watch the whole 137 movie.  But as soon as it was over it was her's again for the taking, so I'm assuming it is much better than I could have ever imagined.

Phineas and Ferb with Superheros is a much watch film and it brought lots of great superheros together to create an action packed adventure.  It includes bonus adventures: Fly On The Wall, Sidetracked Part 1 and 2, Primal Perry Parts 1 and 2, Backyard Hodge Podge, Knot My Problem and Mind Share.

I think that this is the perfect combination to bring Superheros into more children's and teenagers lives.  Because lots of them grew up watching Phineas and Ferb it will be a hit in most households!  This super cute movie released on DVD on October 1st, 2013 so make sure you pick up a copy today!!",1380758400,,1430,4.137184115523466
5847902,4,B00DQR8Z3S,"To say Disney owns a large chunk of pop culture would be an understatement. How many companies out there can claim they have Mickey Mouse, Darth Vader, and the Avengers all under one roof? The time we knew was coming is finally upon us. The melding of the Disney Universe with the Marvel Universe is here, as proven by ""Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel.""

A blast from Dr. Doofenshmirtz's ""Power-Drain-Inator"" bounces off of a space station built by Phineas and Ferb. It drains the powers of Spider-Man, Iron Man, the Hulk, and Thor, leaving them defenseless against a gang of super-villains bent on destroying the world. Phineas and Ferb must join forces with Nick Fury and the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. to help restore the heroes' powers before it's too late. They're joined in their battle against evil by the O.W.C.A. and their top agent Perry the Platypus.

While I imagine many hardcore comic book fans are going to see ""Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel"" and roll their eyes, the target market it's aimed at will smile and take it all in gleefully. If Marvel purists couldn't see this marriage of worlds coming a mile away, they were obviously hiding their heads in the sand. If you like it, then watch it. If you don't, just close your eyes to it and move on. That's the best advice I can give.

Personally, I think combining the two worlds is ingenious and does nothing but expose millions of kids across the world to the Marvel Universe and timeless characters like Iron Man, Spider-Man, the Hulk, and Thor. How can there be something wrong with using a children's TV show as a tool for them to be introduced to a whole new element of entertainment?

Besides the ""Mission Marvel"" full-length adventure, the DVD includes six bonus ""Phineas and Ferb"" adventures as special features. That's a whole lot of zaniness from the two troublemakers and their pet platypus Perry.

""Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel"" is fun for the entire family. It's the first of what I believe will become a frequent melding of two (or maybe even three) different universes. Can you imagine a world where Han Solo and Chewbacca join forces with Captain America and Captain Jack Sparrow as they take on Venom and a legion of Skulls? The time is coming, folks. The time is coming.",1380585600,13,2258,4.720812182741117
5847903,5,B00DQR8Z3S,"As a fan of both Superheroes and Phineas and Ferb, what more could I ask for. This was a fun DVD that brought some of the best superheroes together (in my book) and pair them up with two very cool brothers for some crazy fun and action packed adventures. As always, Phineas and Ferb make something that backfires a bit and the whole group has to work together to set things right. All-in-all though this was a super .-fun episode and definitely one that any fan of either superheroes or Phineas and Ferb will love!

When I think of these Walt Disney quotes, I think of a group of intelligent people who knows exactly what they're doing! they're having fun with whatever they're doing, even if it is impossible, they intend to try new things out because of the ideas they have, and when people enjoy it, they show it to their friends and families!

Wisely bringing the heroes to the Phineas and Ferb universe, rather than vice-versa, the story is a goofy romp around the familiar P&F landscape. Of special high note are the scenes in which the super-villains try to make sense of Doofenshmirtz evil machinations. There is, of course, a suitable important role for Perry and both Candace and Isabella show their bonafides and earn entry into what is still too often an all-boys' club. And as always, a handful of terrific and funny songs.

Lighthearted, entertaining, funny and just shy of wonderful. But that's good enough.",1388361600,,775,4.908396946564886

5847959,5,B00DQR8Z3S,"Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel is a 2013 Disney DVD compilation of the 2013 Disney/Marvel animated special plus six P&F episodes. In this new adventure, Phineas, Ferb, Candace, Isabella, Baljeet, and Buford are greeted by four of the Marvel Universe's greatest superheroes, Spider-Man, Iron Man, Thor and the Incredible Hulk as the heroes are lost of their powers, all due to Dr. Doofenshmirtz's inator destroyed by Perry the Platypus. But the arch-villains of the heroes knows of the situation and tries to conquer Danville, so it is up to the Marvel Heroes, Perry, Nick Fury, and the agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the crew to stop the villains. Also in the DVD are six Phineas and Ferb episodes featuring Perry teaming with an Canadian secret agent Lyla Lolliberry, Perry and Doof matches wits with a vengeful Australian platypus-hunter, Liam O'Cracken, and Phineas, Ferb, Isabella, Baljeet, and Buford trade minds with five alien convicts who tries to take over the earth. The only special feature this DVD has are Disney sneak peeks of upcoming Disney favourites like Iron Man and Hulk: Heroes United, The Little Mermaid, Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H., and a teaser trailer for the Disney Hoilday adventure Frozen. Mission Marvel is the very first collaboration of Disney and Marvel Entertainment since Disney's 2010 purchase of Marvel Characters, Inc. The only minor problem is when Mission Marvel premiered, some Marvel fans were upset that Spider-Man was included in the Superheroes instead of Capt. America, I feel Disney made the right choice in Spider-Man and Not Capt. America. P&F: Mission Marvel is just perfect for both Phineas and Ferb and Marvel Comics fans!",1382227200,,1677,5.146520146520147

This DVD features a movie feature the Disney Phineas and Ferb characters as well as some popular superheros.  My husband and I enjoyed watching it with our boys and it was a great family movie night for us.  After the movie there are six bonus adventures which of course we enjoyed as well.  Whether you are a superhero fan or a Phineas & Ferb fan, I think this will be a hit!  I actually hope they do more of these but we will see.  We missed Captain America which wasn't part of this group, but Iron Man and Spiderman were a hit.  Until I saw this DVD I had no clue that this combo of Disney and Marvel characters existed, glad I came across it!  Oh and of course there are crazy silly songs from the gang and Doofensmirtz which are classic Phineas & Ferb fun.

I received this DVD to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.",1381449600,,1009,4.2631578947368425
5847961,5,B00DQR8Z3S,"This mash-up, the first between a Disney property and Marvel since the Disney purchase of Marvel, of course got lots of buzz when it was announced as a Disney Channel special episode of the an animated series that not only deserves its praise and popularity, it has not allowed success to spoil it.

Because of the Phineas & Ferb premise, literally anything can happen during its perpetual ""summer vacation,"" so an out-of-nowhere encounter with Marvel characters doesn't have to be over-explained with a dream sequence or other device.

It's neat to see how the Marvel heroes, which have the advantage of inherent sly humor on their own and thus don't need to be ""sent up,"" work with Phineas, Ferb, Candace and the gang, swapping powers and pretty much doing everything the talented writers could come up with. The heroes appearing are: Iron Man (voice of Adrian Pasdar); Spider-Man (Drake Bell); Nick Fury (Chi McBride); Thor (Travis Willingham) and Jerry Mathers as The Hulk (just kidding--he's voiced by Fred Tatasciore.

The comedy gold of the whole show is the very funny interplay between Dr. Doofensmirtz and the Marvel villain, who, unlike the heroes, take themselves very seriously and therefore cry out to be made fun of. I laughed out loud at the musical number, ""My Evil Buddies and I.""

The villains who romp and frolic with Doofensmirtz are Venom (Danny Trejo); Red Skull (Liam O'Brien); M.O.D.O.K. (Charlie Adler); and Whiplash (Peter Stormaire). Yes, Stan Lee's in there, too.

I would have loved a nice audio commentary on this disc or perhaps a short doc about how it was done but there are, instead, these episodes included as bonus features (wouldn't it be nice if they released a full season?):

* Fly on the Wall
* Sidetracked
* Primal Perry
* Backyard Hodge Podge
* Knot My Problem
* Mind Share

In addition, the package includes a comic book and a poster, so it's a fine value for the P&F and Marvel fan.",1381449600,7,1928,4.806646525679758
5847962,5,B00DQR8Z3S,"I am going to be reviewing both the content and movie set.

The content is great-this is the best of the Phineas and Ferb and the Avengers.  My kids really enjoyed it! The only thing my daughter was a little disappointed about was that Captain America is not part of the crew.  If your kids like P&F they will love this one!

As for the set, it's great! It comes with a small poster and comic book.  It's packaged with a fun sleeve that slides over the case as well.  These little extras make it even more fun to open and watch.

Overall, this set, and movie are winners!!",1381190400,2,572,4.192660550458716
5847963,5,B00DQR8Z3S,"This movie my entire family enjoyed from start to finish! There's plenty of action, laugh out loud lines, original songs, and overall good wholesome fun! My husband said it was a total Geek fest and I couldn't agree more. I got a real kick that even Stan Lee made an appearance several times.

One part of the movie was pretty hilarious when an elderly lady got off a bus saw all the villains in the park and muttered something about the town being weirder than Portland. Being from Oregon myself, this line was extremely laughable because Portlandians take quite a pride in themselves and their city for being weird.

Throughout all the action packed scenes and saving the world, kids learn all about teamwork, forgiveness, second chances, and never giving up. I know my kids were pretty engaged and couldn't wait to see what would be happening next. They've asked to watch the movie several times since we've gotten it.

Other than the full length feature on the DVD there are six bonus adventures which makes run time of the entire DVD about 145 minutes long. Each DVD comes with a free collectible comic book and an exclusive one of three Mission Marvel Poster (Our DVD came with a Perry the Platypus poster) ! Subtitles and language are available in English, French, and Spanish.

Overall my husband and I highly recommend picked up a copy of this movie! My son and daughter ages nearly 3 and 5 years old enjoyed the flick quite a bit. It's not often we come across films we all can enjoy but this one fits the bill. No scary moments in the least, just amusingly good clean and clever fun.",1380931200,5,1594,4.582456140350877

8596398,5,B00DQR8Z3S,I bought this thinking that my son hadn't seen it yet. He was a little upset to have it because apparently this episode shows up in the netflix series too so he didn't NEED it. BUT he still loves to pull it out and watch it and point out different things to me. I like Phineas and Ferb so I was glad to have it as part of our collection. It came with extra episodes as well.,1486598400,,374,3.8701298701298703
