962154,4,6305089566,"The first act was a drag.  The beginning of Act 2 was wonderful (Zancanaro's opening aria which was warm and beautiful got great applause), then the score wilted.  But from Act 3 right up to the shocker of an ending, the whole thing was absolutely beautiful.  Everyone sang wonderfully.  The plot had enough devices to keep it interesting.  I don't like ballet, but I enjoyed this one, the dancing was clever (but what did it mean?) and the music was beautiful and fun by turns.  One note.  Merritt's character in particular, but all the rebels in general seemed obsessed with a death wish!  I want to die, would that I could die, it is better to die than to...  Good grief!  If they'd all had their way, the opera wouldn't have lasted 10 minutes, just a stage littered with contented corpses.  And (sigh) why must everyone suffer so in a  Verdi opera?  I quibble.  It's just old fashioned melodrama.  I highly recommend this, first and second acts notwithstanding.",1106352000,12,965,4.660714285714286
962155,5,6305089566,"This is an excellent DVD musically. The only fault I can find with it is a fault common to many DVDs of operas; some of the leading singers look much older than their rolls. In the opera house this is not a problem because you cannot see the singers closely enough to notice, but in movies, TV, and DVD closups this obvious age problem detracts from the overall effect. Since in operas, I consider the music to be the most important part, if I must choose between excellent singing and looking the part,I would choose excellent singing every time. Therefore, I give this DVD 5 stars.",1105142400,14,583,4.509433962264151
962156,5,6305089566,"NOTE: Be sure to buy the less expensive release now available (I just bought this one at more than twice the other's price...!!!).

This is a rich rich melodic feast sung by wonderful voices...particularly the baritone and bass.  Contrary to other reviews here,I don't worry about costumes or production details unless they are egregious...and these are fine, perfectly acceptable.  I also don't worry about DVD extras -- I buy for the music and the singing and in those qualities this DVD and this opera are first rate.  A delicious banquet of opera meat and potatoes, and delightful bons bons to boot.",1104796800,12,603,4.9405940594059405
962157,4,6305089566,"I've been living in Asia for many years and I somehow missed hearing of Cheryl Studer. A few years back a friend played a cut from this DVD for me- Studer's singing of ""Merce, diletti amiche,"" and I was hooked. What incredible singing- the voice radiant, the coloratura nearly flawless, the diction clear and clean.(Compare her singing with the very strange sounds that Martina Arroyo made in this aria in the 1974 recording with Levine). Studer's singing throughout just makes you glad to be alive.

Muti's conducting is also another reason to treasure this disc. The music is so beautiful and he approaches the score with delicacy and energy at the same time. The ballet is wonderful evidence of how fine his conducting is.  Some have complained that this dance episode is too long but I can't hear it often enough.

For me Chris Merritt is the one fly in the ointment. I find his singing dry and colorless; but, at the same time, you sense that he is giving his all for Muti and this gorgeous music.(Domingo for Levine, in his early prime, is golden voiced). The rest of the cast and the staging are very fine.

I'm not a judge of sound but the transfer sounds great to me (better than the EMI disc). And it is  very reasonably priced. Not to be missed, especially by Verdi lovers.",1103414400,30,1284,4.565217391304348
962158,3,6305089566,"Vespri is a wonderful, underappreciated opera. It probably has the most ensemble numbers of all of Verdi's operas, even more so than Ballo. It requires great singers but has relatively few ""showy"" numbers for them, a fact star singers may resent given the length of the work. The soprano gets the haunting ""Arrigo...."" which is really part of a duet, the well known Bolero, and a melodramatic ballad in the first act; the base gets the eloquent ""O tu Palermo."" The musical and dramatic quality of tenor and baritone arias are not as high, yet their music is equally demanding. The ensembles are magnificent: all sorts of combinations from a-capella quartets to choruses to full-out unison oh-so-beautiful-italian-melodies. Most of the opera seems written in long melodic lines in minor keys (I have not checked a score.... it sounds that way to me). Yes, there are some passages where the inspiration is not up to the rest, but those do not occur often.
I first became acquainted with this opera when the Met did it years ago with Montserrat Caball, Nicolai Gedda, and Sherrill Milnes, in a somewhat undistinguished Swoboda/Dexter production. Caball's singing was the ""stuff of legends,"" as subsequent hearings of the broadcast performance continue to attest. And she was followed in the part by the likes of Scotto, Deutekom, et al.
The La Scala performance is particularly distinguished by Muti's conducting. I'm not a fan of his conducting in general, but here he excels: energetic, lyrical, propulsive. It is a pleasure to hear Giorgio Zancanaro, a truly robust italian baritone the likes of which we don't seem to hear in America often. His Met appearances were brief. Ferruccio Furlanetto is a good singing base, elsewhere a good Leoporello; Studer and Merritt are fine, but ...... one longs for great voices as Elena and Arrigo, and good as they are, the greatness one has heard totally eludes them. The opera is given complete, even with the ballet (one wishes they would have used the Jerome Robbins choreography.... this one is undistinguished and boring, and so is the dancing). The production is sumptuous. Much love seems to have been placed by all concerned into this project, and in general it shows.
The sound is excellent.... uncompressed stereo. Unfortunately, this is probably the worst DVD I have ever seen (the reason for the 3 stars). I do not know the reason for this utter failure. I have not seen this performance on tape or disc. It looks like the performance was underlit for the source television broadcast and therefore the problem may never be resolved. At points I found it hard on the eyes as I tried to focus in utter futility.
The question then becomes..... if this is as good as it gets, is there another Vespri in the works?  I doubt it. Get it..... close your eyes from time to time..... it certainly is not unwatchable.... the worst moments occur in the luxurious ballroom scene.... close-ups are ok. Why could La Scala not gotten somebody like Brian Large to supervise things? Italian unions? Pity.",1017619200,21,3037,4.908560311284047

7882484,4,6305089566,"I purchased this disk as part of the ten disk La Scala Set; I wanted to familiarize myself with a number of operas to which I have never seen or listened. This ""Siciliani"" was a pleasant surprise. I think it has a lot of fine music within it's rather over long pages. I hear a little of ""Rigoletto's"" Conspirators' Chorus and some ""A Masked Ball"" echoes in the Ball Scene. Personally, I would have either eliminated the so called Paris Ballet or cut it in half. It was done quite beautifully by the dancers, but ballet is just not my cup of tea and it makes the already long opera much too long without adding to the drama. Besides which, I don't think the ballet music is Verdi at his best. I sort of feel like The Emperor in ""Amadeus""; ""it just has too many notes"". The last act is kind of weak. It has some fine music, but the massacre at the conclusion just does not seem to work very well. Although  perhaps not one of Verdi's greatest operas, it is better than the best of many lesser composers it and deserves to be seen more than has been it's history.
Not having seen the opera previously, I have no basis of comparison with other performances. With the exception of the two ""young lovers"" being too old looking and not particularly attractive, the cast was excellent, costumes and scenery opulent even if way past the 1260's in which the rebellion was supposed to have taken pace, the orchestra, chorus and conducting were all very fine. Sheryl Studer was particularly fine. The stage direction was good in a very traditional sort of old fashioned way which I prefer to some of the modern versions of traditional operas.

I would just like to note that most of the reviews were made in the early 2000's and not much mention was made of the sound and video quality. The video is ok for a pre high definition Blu Ray video, but not comparable to a good Blu Ray disk today. The stereo sound was a little harsh and constricted and not really comparable to a good Dts 5.1 surround audio common today. These La Scala tapes were made by RAI for television broadcast and mostly limited television equipment of the day, not necessarily for the wonderful home theater equipment available today.

Still, an excellent, inexpensive way to hear a very worthy, rarely played and recorded opera.",1429228800,,2289,4.524154589371981

7882486,5,6305089566,"How do I remember the Met's most unfortunate staging of this opera!  Characters were supposed to climb up from the beach into the town.  Well, the powers that be decided for the action to take place on a set of descending stairs!  And then Caballe fainted after the first act and the public had to wait for an hour and a half.  but she did finish the performance.
La Scala's version is led by two formidable American singers: Cheryl Studer and Chris Merritt, both in superb voice.  A solidly traditional staging, thank God. I just do not like the French habit of demanding ballets that really do not contribute anything to the action and make the performance longer than it should be. Personally, I loved Zancanaro as Giorgio de Monfort.  I already have four from La Scala collection, and plan to complete the set (11 operas).",1374796800,4,826,4.623287671232877
7882487,3,6305089566,"I first saw this DVD years ago at the home of a friend.  As I wasn't impressed with it then, I can't imagine why I bought it now.  Perhaps because Studer is one of the few sopranos who can make it through the difficult bits, perhaps because I saw the names Eagling and Fracci in the ballet credits and my friend had fast-forwarded through the ballet.  Oh, well, it hasn't been a total disappointment -- but anyone who saw the Glyndebourne Giulio Cesare as his/her introduction to opera will be traumatized by the ""stand and deliver"" acting in this production.

La Scala productions in DVD are never my first choice.  I'll buy them in CD, of course, but visually they are usually disappointing, even the 21st century ones.  In this production, just about every everyone has his/her eyes glued to the conductor (Muti).  This is especially true of the chorus: if you've seen the old b&w Tebaldi/Corelli Forza, and remember the chorus of monks in the oath scene, you'll get the idea: it's embarrassing.  In the third act ball scene for example, the Vespri chorus members, singing about the glorious, joyful festivities, are all lined up in a bunch, facing forward, expressionless.  When done with that part, they turn as one and exit.  Even watching the conductor, their phenomenally difficult unaccompanied bits are ragged; (perhaps they're supposed to be -- I've never heard them any other way...)

Neither Studer nor Merritt look the part of young adults -- I think Arrigo is supposed to be a teen-ager as per libretto.  Merritt must have been chosen for the part because he has the D above staff in Act V.  Imagine, choosing a tenor for one note.  I'd rather see Domingo and have the note changed or the aria transposed down (yes, blasphemy, but it was only one of those gratuitous arias the French ""grand opera"" demanded, so why not?)  BTW, I've seen Merritt in roles more suited to him and he's fine in those; he's definitely not bad in this production -- that is, his singing isn't.

About that libretto: Scribe gave Verdi the first three acts in a reasonable amount of time, and then sat on Acts IV and V for two years.  I have no idea why: apparently (and unknown to Verdi) it was an old libretto that had been written for Donizetti, who started to set it and then abandoned it.  What took so long for Acts IV and V to be completed and given to Verdi?  After all, Scribe had a factory of hacks to help him.  Scribe has a lot to answer for -- and not just for Vespri.  But that's a subject for someone's doctoral dissertation.

Zancanaro, Furlanetto and Studer are superb, but you may be able to get a CD of Vespri that suits you.  Buy this DVD only if you are a fan of one or more of the principals -- or if you ignore the visual and merely listen to the excellent singing and conducting.

Now about that ballet maligned by other reviewers: have you ever seen a decent one in a La Scala opera production?  By La Scala standards, this one is terrific.  The choreography is unimaginative, but that's an improvement for La Scala.  The dancers are excellent.  I suspect Fracci and Eagling were added as a ticket seller -- both were under-used and Eagling seemed a bit off his mark.  Look for those two on other DVDs.  The second pair of soloists is outstanding -- but who are they?  They are not given credit separately from the corps.  And the camerawork was not done by anyone familiar with ballet.  And the costuming -- enough, you get the point.

So, five stars for singing and conducting, one star for direction and production.  Seems a shame that amazon's system doesn't allow for anything other than an averaging of points.",1333324800,9,3631,4.559505409582689
7882488,5,6305089566,"This old (1990) and thoroughly old-fashioned production truly is Verdi as Verdi should be done. The orchestra in black, elegant Riccardo Muti in white tie and satin lapels, traditional sets, almost no milling around on stage by the chorus, no hint of nudity, no singers lying on the floor or leaning into the walls for their arias, huge voices and gorgeous costumes ... Or perhaps it should be gorgeous voices and huge costumes, to accommodate the lovers Arrigo and Elena ... singers standing stage front, feet planted foursquare, arms extended to expand the rib cage, projecting gorgeously even to the cheap seats in 'paradise'!

""Squillo"" is a technical opera term for the 'ringing' quality of the trained voice that allow it to project over thick orchestration. You'll hear astounding squillo from all three principal male singers in this production, most thrillingly from tenor Chris Merritt (Arrigo) in the later acts. That clarion quality is less obvious in the voices of baritones and basses, but both Giorgio Zancanaro (the French Governor, Guy de Montfort) and Ferruccio Furlanetto (the rebel leader Giovanni Procida) offer conservatory-perfect demonstrations of how squillo is different from mere volume. Both of them make even their most piano asides pierce through the orchestral textures. Furlanetto is unsurpassable in his dark role as the relentless patriot. Cheryl Struder (the Duchess Elena) sings with consummate taste and lovely timbre, but she's out-matched by the three males at times, and that's the only musical weakness in this resoundingly musical production.

I Vespri Siciliani was composed first with a French libretto and staged in Paris in 1855. When it was 'translated' into Italian for staging in Parma, ironically the setting was also translated, to Portugal, for political reasons. This La Scala production uses elements of both scores, keeping the extended ballet sequences from the French opera but using the Italian libretto. The pair of dancers who enliven the visuals of the third act are Carla Fracci and Wayne Eagling. Canadian-born, California-raised Eagling is 100% Italian 'bella figura', with a kind of grace that's the physical equivalent of a singer's squillo.

To my ears, I Vespri Sicilano is one of Verdi's finest musical achievements, alongside Simon Boccanegra (of 1857) and Ballo in Maschera (of 1859). I can't imagine why it's not produced far more often.

Just a thought about those ""traditional' sets and costumes: the historical event known as The Sicilian Vespers occurred in 1282! It was a rebellion against the Angevin French King Charles the First!! But this staging uses uniforms, gowns, and peasant frocks of the 19th C, perhaps of the Napoleonic era. And I'm fairly sure that such costuming would have been what Verdi and his dramaturges expected. So ""anachronism"" was part of the traditional staging all along? Would it be any more anachronistic to stage a music-drama depicting an uprising in 1282 in the garb of Chechens or Libyans in 2011?",1316736000,8,3007,5.232365145228216
7882489,5,6305089566,"This is ""Grand"" Opera of the grandest style. Written by Verdi for the Grand Paris Opera house. It is truly a pageant of the history of a people seeking freedom from a tyrant ruler. Filled with idealism, drama and high human emotions all in grand, soaring melodies with Verdi at his operatic best. I have loved this work since I first heard it with Arroyo and Levine in the 70s and later with Susan Dunn and Ricardo Chailly. Both good productions but no match for this present recording. The setting is 13th century Sicily now governed by an agent of the French King of Naples. The governor (Montfort) is cruel and repressive and well acted and sung by Zancanaro. He has as hostage Elena whose brother was murdered by the French and is sung by Cheryl Studer. The hero Henri who turns out to be Montfort's son is sung by Chris Merritt. The conductor is Riccardo Muti at his best and grandest. This is probably the only complete recording that includes the full ballet music and none of the usual cuts for the singers. We can thank Muti for this. The music here carries the drama which is just as well as both Merritt and Studer are superb singers of their parts but are rather stout individuals so stage action is best kept to a minimum. And soar they do. They are a good match for each other and their singing is glorious. Both have clear large voices that can handel the challenge of the difficult Verdi line. Some ten years later they would again appear together with Muti in a superb William Tell of Rossini. The ballet is at the end of Act 3 and titled The Four Seasons. The prima is Carla Fracci; both she and the corps are excellent in a truly satisfying ballet full of beauty and happiness. I'm really thrilled to have it included in an otherwise cruel, bloody strife filled opera. I highly recommend this album.",1313020800,6,1818,4.478915662650603
7882490,5,6305089566,"This is one Verdi role Merritt can handle beautifully.  He and Zancanaro work beautifully together and both sound wonderful.

This is a pretty tuneful opera for such a macabre story.  Rarely doe it have a soprano who can get thru the bolero beautifully and this is no exception.  But Studer does as well as most.

As usual I fast forward thru the ballets......but thats just me.  It would take the Bolshoi to keep me on play.",1248912000,6,425,4.526315789473684
7882491,5,6305089566,"My goal in viewing/listening to opera is to keep in touch with Italian language and get in touch with Italian opera culture in preparation for an upcoming trip. Someone with rudimentary Italian (io) could easily understand (without subtitles, but following  the libretto and referring to the synopsis) this production of ""I Vespri Siciliani"" because it had communicative staging and costuming, decent (Furlanetto) to superior (Zancanoro) acting, and numerous closeups of the interactions of the main characters. One example of make-it-accessible stagecraft: The costumes of the male Sicilian chorus were probably historically inaccurate but expressive of place and station, showing the locals in clear contrast to the occupying French.  I fast-forwarded through the (overly-long, not very interesting) ballet in Act III but was otherwise fully engaged throughout. Like other La Scala productions I've seen that were filmed by RAI TV, a first-rate theatrical performance made into a top-class home viewing experience.",1183161600,10,1016,5.766666666666667
