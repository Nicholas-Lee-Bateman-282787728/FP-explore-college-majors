Another hilarious onslaught of profanity and poopy humor covers this crap encrusted set.  Again, fun box art that follows suit with the binding having the logo when all sets assembled.  Volume two all condensed onto one disc, so if you missed out on volume 2, be sure to pick up this golden turd instead.",1473465600,,385,4.617647058823529
