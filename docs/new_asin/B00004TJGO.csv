1350373,4,B00004TJGO,"I'm not a huge anime fan, but I have friends who are, and they got me hooked on this series. I was on tenderhooks when we got to the end of set 1, and had to get this set right away to find out what happened. This series was just as gripping; there was a point where I couldn't stop watching it, where my boyfriend and I were looking at each other and saying, ""Just one more . . .,"" despite the lateness of the hour and work the next morning.

 It's the characters that get you. I'm not a huge Miaka fan, but I can allow for her impulsiveness and teariness because she's 15. But I do like her pureness of heart and her selflessness, something that many reviews don't mention, and despite her incessant tears and her repetitive screams of ""Tamahome!"" I grew to care about what happened to her. And I *love* the Suzaku Seven, especially Hotohori and Nuriko, and I always wanted to know what happens to them. As for Nagako, I've seldom seen a villain I enjoyed hating more.

 I give this set 4 stars instead of 5 for several reasons. There are many things that are not explained, such as how and why Nakago by himself is so much more powerful than any and all of the Suzako Seven, and where the Empress suddenly came from (that would have been an interesting storyline to have seen). Secondly, there are some inconsistencies. In the first series, Miaka's overnight trip back to real-world takes three months in book-world, but events that happened 90 years ago in real-world also happened 90 years ago in book-world (which means that one of the Priestesses was over a hundred when she dies). Finally, I wasn't satisfied by the ending. It left too many things unsettled--and (SPOILER!) I'm still angry that Hotohori died.

 But see it anyway!",1090886400,2,1738,4.484177215189874
1350374,4,B00004TJGO,"I have to say that for a good portion of this half of the series, I was Less Than Impressed.<p>First of all, the writers seemed to forget about their WONDERFUL supporting cast (except, of course, for when they were killing them off, but I'll get to that) and focused a great deal of this half to JUST Miaka and Tamahome. While I can find it in my heart to stand Miaka, I hate her and Tamahome as a couple. Probably mainly because somebody forgot to give Tamahome a personality. There's a good ten episodes (the figure could be off; I never actually counted) where I seriously considered just giving up on the series all together; it got repetitive and annoying.<p>However, I stuck it out, and I'm really hoping that anybody else who spends any amount of time on this series will do the same. Except for the middle section, this half is a REAL emotional roller coaster. It has the same comedy as the first half (though in this half there were quite a few awkward gags that would have been better left out, and there might have actually been more fanservice in this half than in the first, which, if true, would really be saying something), but there are several episodes that will leave you in tears, even watching them a second or third (or more) time. There are deaths, and a lot of them; they increase in frequency the later in the series it gets, and for saps like me, the last few episodes will get really hard to watch. While these episodes are very dramatic, it's a shame some of the best characters are killed off as this leaves them unavailable to provide relief during the rocky middle section.<p>On the plus side, we also get to learn more about the history of the Universe of the Four Gods and the Priestesses who came before Miaka and Yui; this information was intriguing enough to keep me invested.<p>I got to the last three or four episodes thoroughly believing that no ending could really satisfy me, and I am VERY happy to say that I was proved wrong. While an attempt at garnering sympathy for Nakago failed and I still don't like Tamahome, I was otherwise blown away by the ending. It was wonderful, and I was very glad that I did stick with it. Take my advice on this one; I'm sure you won't regret it.",1086307200,2,2221,4.45945945945946
1350375,5,B00004TJGO,"... and really, the best part of all of Fushigi Yugi, including Eikoden (shudder) and Oni (though not including the manga).  As I said in my previous review of Suzaku, I believe this series is under-rated, and, to repeat myself further, I was guilty of this as well.  I really didn't like the first few episodes, but kept watching and grew to like it.  Then I saw Seiryu, and it was all worth it.  Seiryu has all of the characters we have grown to love, with a much deeper, darker message than Suzaku.  We grow to understand why Yui has grown to hate Miaka so much (you would too if you ended up with a mind-f***er like Nakago).  We really begin to feel for the characters and their heart-ache.  And we begin to see Yu Watase's deeper messages: messages about life, love, friendship and war.  When I first started Suzaku, I wondered how anyone (Gilles Poitras) could list Fushigi Yugi in their top 41 recommended titles.  Seiryu made me see why.  It's a great series, and once you make it through the first half, you can enjoy the wonderful second installment.",1085702400,,1060,4.50261780104712
1350376,3,B00004TJGO,"Well, I'm writing this under the assumption that all readers are considering buying/have bought and watched the first half of the Fushigi Yuugi series. I'll start right now by saying that I've only ever seen it in Japanese, so I can't give you a fair opinion on the English dub.
In brief, what I thought of Fushgi Yuugi in general- well, I really quite liked it. It's not a favourite of mine, and I don't think it ever will be, but its still incredibly cute and funny.
What I thought of this set:
Well, excuse me while I go bang my head against a wall. Don't get me wrong- the second half is definately not bad, and for the most part is very, very enjoyable. There are, however, certain aspects that have inspired within me the urge to hurt something.
1) The complete shifts in characters. Miyaka started out as a likeable character. Granted, she was a ditz, but the character had spirit and passion, and was done very well. By this point in the series though, her personality has shifted completely. Gone is the girl who was willing to fight a gang in an alley because she didn't have to worry about teachers yelling at her. (This was in episode 3, I believe.) Enter Miyaka, weak priestess, who wanders around wailing and blushing, waiting for people to cater to beck and call....
Tamahome suffered the same personality shift as Miyaka. Like her, I really loved Tamahome at the start of the series. His character was portrayed as being shallow with a good heart underneath it all. Like Miyaka, he was hilarious, and incredibly likeable. I shamelessly admit that I was cheering him on the whole time, hoping he'd 'get the girl'. By the time the second series rocked up though, he had Miyaka and had become a simpering mess. He was completely whipped, no longer the strong character I liked. It was extremely disappointing.
We get to see more insight into Yui, but not much into the Seiryuu Seven, which is vaguely disappointing, but can be forgiven. We see the Byakko Seven- well, three members- and slowly find out more and more in the dark past of 'The Universe of the Four Gods', which I have to say, is excellently done. Sadly though, there is very little Hotohori- in my opinion, a real shame, as his character was wonderful and his Japanese voice actor is one of my personal favourites.
The plot is still engaging. It doesn't focus on the other members of the Seven as much as I'd like, in favour of screams of 'Tamahome!' 'Miyaka!' but each character does get their brief spot in the limelight.

The drawings are still excellent, and the animation flows as well as the first season. When it's not trying too hard to be deep and meaningful, we see that wonderful Fushigi Yuugi humour, which was originally the first thing that caught my attention. There's still plenty of fanservice, which was kind of misplaced, considering this is a series that targets girls, but is still funny.
All in all, the second series is enjoyable, and is a nice way to round out the series. The ending leaves a bit to be desired, but that's what the OVAs are for. If you've seen the first half of Fushigi Yuugi (which was, to me, superior) this half is a necessity. I don't think that, on the whole, you'll be disappointed. Still, if you're anything like me, you'll wish that certain parts had been revised.",1048550400,15,3291,4.577966101694916
1350377,5,B00004TJGO,"...This is the best anime series I have ever seen.  The first season of the show or the Suzaku box set was very light-weight compared to the Seiryu box set (second season).  The first disk of the Seiryu set has the best episodes of the entire series.  Thankfully, they included Nuriko as the center character of the series at this point in the show.  He is my favorite of all of the characters, you can say I am mildly obsessed with him.  He truly is Miaka's best friend out the the Celestial Seven.  He is there for Miaka when Tamahome visits his family, and is there to comfort Miaka and her heart break.  He opens up to Miaka and Tamahome, the only two who truly know who he is, and why.  For those who've seen the show, he's a transvestite, who loves Hotohori, but there's a very interesting twist in the first disk of the second series that is left to interpereation.  He also is there to counsel both Miaka and Tamahome yet again when their future is at a cross-roads.  Unfortunately, for those who've seen it, we know what happens, and from personal experience, it's the hardest disk to watch, because of the inevitible scene.  I cry EVERY SINGLE TIME I WATCH that episode!  It's so heart breaking, you just ask ""why does it have to happen?""
As for the rest of the second season, it's fantastic, better than the first, and that's saying a lot, because it's such a magnificent series, all around.  There is far more character interaction, and we discover more about the Suzaku Seven as the series progresses.  The undeniable love that the characters have for one another is incredbily touching.  Nothing can shake the bond between the characters, not even death.  The Seiryu set is far more dramatic and gut-renching than the first.  The interaction between the two worlds come to a head on war, and the love and respect between Miaka and Tamahome is always put to the test.
The Seiryu Seven become more evolved into the plot, with a few of the warriors setting some rather dark moods.  Nakago is an unbelievably fantastic villain, who continues to minipulate Yui (Miaka's best friend and worst enemy) with every word and action.  You feel bad for him once you witness the very end, for you realize where this ultra-secretive warrior is coming from.
I trust that anime fans will love this series, although it is rather long.  The series end is predictable, and was left open for the third season, which never happened, and instead the OVA was introduced a little later.  But this is a fantastic series, perfect for all ages.  I guarentee all will love it, for everything that it has, love, drama, action, comedy and magic.  The magic is in many forms, it'll make you believe in the power of love and friendship.",1047600000,9,2717,4.591286307053942

7922527,5,B00004TJGO,"I will try to write a review of the entire Fushigi Yugi series so that you can have a complete (and overall) picture of this wonderful anime. Therefore, if you don't want to know what happens next then please stop reading the specific section because spoilers will be included all over in the review that is to follow.

Apart from it, I will try to maintain an overall review so that to inform the reader as much as possible without giving too much away.

Fushigi Yugi - The Mysterious Play - (Boxed Set 1, Suzaku)

Two fiends, Miaka and Yui - the typical Japanese high school girls- will come across a book called the `Universe of the four Gods' and will be drawn into it (SPOILER! The book basically presents itself to be something like a gate to a parallel universe with the difference that the gods of this parallel universe are the ones who `choose' whom to allow to enter and why, something that will be implied latter on, in the second box set).

There, the two girls will be confronted with a world that is divided into four kingdoms and resembles Ancient China, but each of the girls will end up in a different kingdom as a priestess of the kingdom's god; and their goal will be to gather the seven `holy' warriors in order to summon the god. The catch: the girls will be enemies. On top of that, Miaka will deeply fall in love with one of her warriors, Tamahome, who will love her deeply as well but: Yui will want him two; the emperor will love Miaka etc.

The first arc, deals more with the story and character development, the viewer learns a lot about the world/kingdoms, the citizens agony etc. Of course all this will be accompanied with a lot of action as well.

Fushigi Yugi - The Mysterious Play - (Boxed Set 2, Seiryu)

This is the continuation of the first arc. Now that the viewer has gotten into the anime, the story takes off. After failing to summon Suzaku, the warriors will have to find two holy ornaments in order to achieve it. The story starts to get darker and darker, very emotional and the actual conflict between the two parties of holy warriors takes place, and the true feelings of the love triangle (Tamahome-Miaka-Emperor) will be tested; is their love destined to fail? Additionally, characters that you will learn to love, from the first arc already, will die (be it children, men, women, warriors, emperors or whatsoever)... Last but not least, the final battles will also occur not only in the Four Gods Kingdoms but also in our world as well, because the universes will start to collide (may sound confusing but once you watch the anime it is easy to understand, it is just if I will start to explain it I will give the story and twists away, sorry guys). What will be the end?

Fushigi Yugi :The Mysterious Play OVA Boxed Set

Tamahome is now Taka (well, re-incarnated) and lives together with Miaka in our world. However, trouble occurs once a very powerful and dark force tries to escape from the world of the four kingdoms and wants to come and to destroy our world. Now again, the couple will be drawn back into the book, travel forth and back into the universes, the Suzaku Seven are gathered again and hell brakes loose; because the love of Miaka and Tamahome is in serious danger (not to mention the worlds as well).

Fushigi Yugi - The Mysterious Play - Eikoden

This is, for the time being, the last of Fushigi Yugi that is out there. In these OVAs, Tamahome and Miaka are married and she is pregnant. However, a girl named Mayo will enter the book of the four gods as a new priestess of Suzaku and will try to: steal Tamahome from Miaka, who will fall into a coma, kill the Suzaku Seven, take the child of Tamahome and Miaka as her own etc. Tamahome will enter the book but the world he once knew is starting to fall apart...

Overall opinion about the series:

Personaly, I believe that this anime alongside with Escaflowne, tops every other anime in the Fantasy genre. It is very emotional, has strong character development, solid and very interesting story with way too many twists and will keep you hooked up till the end (that is something that will happen for sure hehehe)

As for the animation:

The first arc has a fair animation but still a good one (in order to get a picture, the animation is something like crave of the fireflies). The second one is updated (something like Trigun). In the first OVAs the animation is definitely updated (something like FMP). Last but not least, in the last OVAs the animation remains in the same level as the previous OVAs but the creatures' animation is something like the ones you see in Digimon (well, personally I preferred the way they used to be in the previous OVAs).

Music:

The music, no matter arcs or OVAs, opening or ending, is very - very good and emotional. You will love the music in it.

Worth buying or not?

I will be honest. Personally I love these series and bought all of them. However, the price may present itself to be an obstacle (took me two years to buy the complete show). Therefore, if you can afford it than buy it for sure and you will not regret it; if not, than try to rent it if possible because these shows are definitely worth watching. Not to mention the fact that the series all together are very long (something that I liked).

Well, I hope that I could help you by presenting you with an overall picture of Fushigi Yugi. If so then please click on the yes button below ^_^",1152748800,11,5413,4.459514170040486
7922528,5,B00004TJGO,"Although the first half was comical, this is where the drama sets in.  When I bought the VHS version, we took our time buying the first half of the set.  When it got more serious, we started buying almost three at a time (my mother and sister was helping my brother and I out with it).

At the second half, Yui and Miaka are now priestesses of Two of the Four Gods (Miaka: Suzaku, and Yui: Seiryu).  The most significant warrior in their corner are Tamahome (who's become a BIG softie) and Nakago (who's a cold-hearted [...]).  They are warring against each other because...of Tamahome, among the issue of being neglected in Yui's time of need.  I'm not giving away any more spoilers now.  The mood in this one is a lot darker than in the first half (of course).

If you are a tenderhearted viewer, and rooted for the Suzaku warriors, like I did (you had no choice really)...please keep a tissue handy.  I felt sorry for some of the Seiryu warriors because of their hard pasts (and didn't for the ones that had lived before because they had no age limit or are gay).  I can't believe I still get misty-eyed every time I think of it!  You'd think that after 4 years I'd have gotten over it, but...I guess not!  Not completely, anyway!

In order to fight for the better good, some people are killed and sacrificed in order to prove/provoke something to someone--and in my case, for character development and a juicier story. Let me stop here, before I give anything else away!  I'm letting you know that the series is that good!

If you liked the first half of this series, you'll like the second half even more because of the suspense.  Note to all: if you watch this half, keep the viewing down to a minimum.  When I watched it, I could only watch (at most) a tape at a time.  That's three episodes.  If it was a traumatic (read: emotionally draining) episode, then it was only two.

This half is for kids over the age of 13, because of mature situations.  Reminder: keep the hankies handy.  You'll need 'em.",1119744000,2,2008,4.4289617486338795
7922529,4,B00004TJGO,"The time has finally come! With the defeat of Tamahome's spell, Miaka can finally summon Suzaku and make her wishes. She learns that she is only allowed three, so she must choose wisely. Torn by the many promises and requests of the people, Miaka knows that her heart wants nothing more than to be with Tamahome.

But the summoning ceremony is disrupted with the exposure of a traitor. Despite all saddness and new pains that Tamahome and Miaka must now face, Miaka and her warriors prepare for another way to summon Suzaku. But their happiness is soon extinguished...

While I was able to get mine to play and all episodes were there, the quality is pretty bad.  The picture is dark and grainy and the sound track does not match up with the visual.  Sound effects and voices occur a few seconds after the action.  It's really quite disappointing.

I'm puzzled as to why there are no (or at least none listed as such) used DVDs of the ""legitimate"" 4 disk version.",1116028800,6,497,4.24468085106383
7922531,5,B00004TJGO,"The first season of the season ends in a cliffhanger (gasp!), leaving you wanting more! I greatly respect Geneon for making Fushigi Yugi a more affordable series by spacing out the DVDs. The Suzaku boxset (which I also have) costs $200 whereas these individual DVDs will get you the same episodes in only $80 or so. The designs on the covers are very pretty (and they are reversible too). Overall, this is a great buy! Every shoujo fan should try this series! Although the first season isn't as emotionally moving as the second season (which made me cry every time I saw it), it still is a great purchase.",1106092800,5,605,4.559633027522936
