8383771,5,B002XLGOI6,"Another film about how a man gets into trouble with the mexican mob.  Then turns to his brother, who happens to be a prominate member of an Los Angeles gang.  Whate happens afterward is an all out war to gain the money that is necessary to pay off the mexican mob not to kill the major characters.  Many characters try to foil this plan and complete anarchy insues.

This film is well done, espically since it is a low budget film and it is a disservice that it didn't get more exposure.  The acting is very well done.  The director did a great job in leading the way in the film and storyline.  There were some minor points that could of been better if the film could of had a higher budget.  But otherwise it is a great film to watch.",1268784000,6,736,4.170212765957447
