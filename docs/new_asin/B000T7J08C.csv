8208012,4,B000T7J08C,"""Here's a project that younger children can do - with a little help. You don't have to be a professional. The patterns can be traced directly from the TV screen, cut out, and used to shape the dough. Chef Harold Alexander shows how to mix the dough and use the patterns to score the gingerbread as well as mix icing to use as glue to build your house. Use your imagination to decorate your house with frosting, candies, gumdrops, dried plants, and artificial foliage. Like most things, it's easier to learn while watching an expert work. Cookbook Videos offer that opportunity. Sub-titles emphasize the Chef's directions and list each ingredient as it is added. The complete recipe is graphically presented on the tape along with nutritional information. Cookbook Videos are used in home economics classes nationwide as well as for home schooling. Chef Alexander has owned two restaurants and a cooking school during more than 20 years as a professional chef.""",1448323200,,960,4.968944099378882
