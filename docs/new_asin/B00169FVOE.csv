Given the barren and beautiful landscape that is used to great effect this could just as well be Afganistan.

The French have quite a few skeletons in their closet as they tried to hold on to their colonial power in the wake of World War 2. As it is these chapters of history are silent set against the American Vietnam War.

The story focuses on one Commissioned Officer who starts the war as an upright man but soon things become less clear until he becomes a man he would detest. There are plenty of other characters and the build up is seamless.

Strongly recommended.",1254268800,6,776,4.368055555555555
8261692,5,B00169FVOE,"How easy it is to judge comfortably seated in an armchair film, ranking without appeal the good on one side and the evil on the other. The Manichean vision of good and evil simplifies to the extreme the humans who, to quote a passage of the film by Pierre Schoendoerffer, ""The Honor of a Captain"" made the man stick to one idea.

The man is not an idea. It is not reducible to the single dimension, dry, without a soul, out of the time and foreign, of the idea. The man lives ideas. He does not live only from ideas. The man combats what he believes to be evil with its strengths and weaknesses, with his errors in a story; his and that of his time.

The war in Algeria shown in ""The intimate enemy"" is tough, ruthless, terrible as is the idea of war. The young lieutenant, brilliantly interpreted by Benot Magimel, is immersed in suffering. He replaces a death in combat in a bled lost, surrounded by fellaghas. The death prowls. The betrayal is his valet. The fear is shared. What sense?

This exceptional film directed by a remarkable Florent Emilio Siri, plunges us into the complexity of a double battle: the survival of the being and his soul.",1220832000,5,1149,4.436018957345971
