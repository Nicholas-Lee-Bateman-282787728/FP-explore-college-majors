Later it was revealed that Terry had not honored his marriage, his ministry here was dissolved by the board, he left CO and settled in TX, then later divorced, and started a new life with another wife. It was an end to something miraculous here in CO, if you attended any of the lunch for the Lord meetings on Wednesdays, then you know. I think he was a modern day cantor to usher in worship for the Bride. It crossed denominational lines, it brought unity among the Body and there was nothing as sweet as hearing and participating in the New Song. It was for a brief season, a very anointed experience, and the lives of many were changed by the presence of the Holy Spirit.",1327968000,4,752,4.340425531914893
