8369072,4,B002FIRSCI,"The Mobster Movie Pack brings together all 20 feature films available from Echo Bridge's Mobster Classics series into one convenient 5 disc pack. Many of the films were originally released by major studios like Warner Brothers and Universal. The others are independant releases, or they come from smaller studios like Pathe, Monogram &  PRC. If you are a fan of old Gangster films, you'll enjoy this set!

The multi-disc movie pack releases from Echo Bridge (and companies like Mill Creek entertainment & Passport Video) offer a lot of entertainment value for the money.

All of these movies are now in the public domain. Very few of them have been cleaned up or digitally restored, so the image quality varies from film to film. It is generally good - and with certain films like ""The Big Combo"", it's excellent. As other reviewers have mentioned, the companies logo ""Platinum Disc Corporation"" does appear in the bottom corner of the screen from time to time, which is annoying and distracting. It's an inconvenience, but after a while you will learn to ignore it.

There is an interesting mix of rare entertainment here, featuring stars like Carole Lombard,  Leonard Nimoy, Alan Ladd, Yul Brynner - all in very early film roles.

Some of the set's highlights include, an early talkie with Carol(e) Lombard as a gangster's love interest. Alan Ladd's fine performance in Gang's Inc., Leonard Nimoy (Star Trek's Mr. Spock) as a young tough boxer in Kid Monk Baroni, Yul Brynner as a cunning smuggler in Ports of New York and ...The Big Combo, a cult film noir - this stylish film alone makes the entire set worth it! The package also includes Walter Matthau's only effort as both star and director - Gangster Story.

It's worth a look.

Had I known it was a Platinum Obnoxious Disk product, I would have never purchased the set.",1336608000,4,319,4.517241379310345
