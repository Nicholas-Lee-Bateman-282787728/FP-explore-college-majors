8283887,5,B001BNFR2G,"This six-DVD set is an absolute must-have for any true Yankees fan! Relive some of the most exciting games in recent Yankees history. The set includes Game 5 of the 1976 ALCS with Chris Chambliss's walk-off homer, Game 6 of the 1977 World Series with Reggie Jackson's three homers on three straight pitches, Game 2 of the 1995 ALDS against the Mariners when Don Mattingly played his final game at Yankee Stadium, Game 6 of the 1996 World Series which started the Bronx Bombers' run of 4 World Series titles in 5 years, Game 4 of the 2001 World Series when Derek Jeter earned the nickname ""Mr. November"" for his dramatic 10th inning walk-off homer moments after the Fall Classic had moved into November play for the first time ever, and the final game of the 2003 ALCS against the rival Red Sox capped by Aaron Boone's extra inning blast. These six core games helped the Yankees maintain their claim as the greatest team in all professional sports!",1317081600,,947,4.642857142857143
8283888,4,B001BNFR2G,"The marketplace prices make this a steal even if two of the games are available in other sets. To me the Seattle game and the Aaron Boone game alone are worth the price of admission.

The Seattle game especially as it shows you the difference that 14 years makes. In that game you had 57,000 people chanting expletives at Ken Griffey Jr in unison and the Mariners had to be pulled off the field after Mattingly homered as there was a near riot. Last week, you could not get half the Stadium to coordinate on ""Who's Your Daddy"".

But I digress. All of the games are classics in one way or another and are sure to make any Yankee fan's day. The presentation is nice in a metal box instead of cheap cardboard that you normally find.

Four stars because two of the games are available in other sets and the games are not widescreen.",1257724800,,828,4.329032258064516
8283889,3,B001BNFR2G,"This is a terrific set in terms of packaging and presentation, but I'm with the man who said that those games which are already available on DVD shold have been replaced. Personally, I would much rather have had Ron Guidry's 18Ks game in its entirety... and what about the Graig Nettles Show, a.k.a. Game 3 of the '78 Series? I'm glad to have this set for the previously unreleased games, but I object slightly to the repackages...still, these are the ones the fan voted for, and Vox publicum, vox dei, right?",1229990400,,509,4.604395604395604
8283890,5,B001BNFR2G,"This is a great set celebrating the greatest Yankees games in historic Yankee Stadium.  Just being able to have ""Donnie Baseball's"" last game at the Stadium is awesome.  What a game that was... The 1995 Division Series vs. Seattle where he hit .417 and who can forget the incredible two games of the 2001 WS vs. Arizona.  Game 4 is here experience all the magic again from that night when Tino Martinez homers with two out in the ninth and Jeter wins it with his November magic.  Reggie's three HR game from 1977 is also here as is Chris Chambliss' HR to win the 1976 pennant.  If you're a true blue Yankee fan as myself this 6-disc set is for you.  YANKEE STADIUM FOREVER!!!",1222992000,3,675,4.403225806451613
8283891,4,B001BNFR2G,"Great games from the Stadium, quility is great and the special features are ok. Bottom line, I would replace the Mr. November game and Mr. October game since those games are already on DVD. But it's a ""Must have"" if your a yankee fan.",1220832000,5,234,4.340909090909091
