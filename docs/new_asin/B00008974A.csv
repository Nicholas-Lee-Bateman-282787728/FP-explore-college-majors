One day he is trying to save a boy that is about to be hit by a car, he is killed instead. He is approached by a pretty girl flying on a broom. Her name is Botan, and she's the Grimm Reaper. She offers him a chance to regain his life. After coming back to life Yusuke becomes a Spirit Detective. He gain spiritual powers and hunts down rogue apparitions that cause trouble for the living world. He is joined by his friend Kuwabara, the demons Hiei and Kurama. Together they fight off the deadly demons that seek to destroy the world.

After winning their 1st round team Urameshi faces a team of guys controlled by an evil scientist. The men are actually noble, but are fighting against their will. Team Urameshi doesn't feel right about fighting good people used as slaves. Only the spirit wave can save them.

This is  a great series. It has lots of cool characters, good animation, voice acting, and a very engrossing story. It's a very long anime, so if you want to watch it be prepared to like it and spend a long time with it. It's one of those that gets more interesting as it progresses. Even though it has a bang up start it maintains the flow throughout. I would even go so far as to say that it's one of the most famous anime series' of all time. It has a bit of a Dragonball Z vibe to it, and everyone likes that. I highly recommend Yu Yu Hakusho to every anime fan, it's simply amazing.",1353110400,,1502,4.28169014084507
7980621,4,B00008974A,"Yu Yu hakusho: Vol 10: The Evil Dr. Ichigaki contains four episodes, numbers 33 - 36 in the anime series.  This DVD is pretty boring until the compelling storyline about Dr. Ichigaki's secret plan gets going.  The end of the DVD is very powerful and worth the wait.

Episode 33: A Day in Waiting - A small respite for Team Yuremeshi from fighting.  Yusuke is shocked by the inability of his Spirit Gun to fire.  Meanwhile, Hiei tries in vain on the beach to get his paralyzed and petrified right arm to begin to heal from the attack he used in his last fight.

Episode 34: Kuwabara is haunted by psychic dreams about the members of Team Ichigaki.  Are these dreams a warning or a call for help?  What can Kuwabara do about it?

Episode 35: A Glimpse Beneath the Mask! - The Masked Fighter is revealed not to be the old Genkai, as everyone suspected, but a pretty young lady.  But her true identity remains a mystery.

Episode 36: Ambition Destroyed: A Trial of Light - As Yusuke struggles to stay out of harm's way, Kuwabara refuses to attack Dr. Ichigaki's fighters.  This episode is quite moving and satisfying.

Extras include a Kurama action figure preview, behind the kanji, and character profiles.",1121644800,,1203,4.591549295774648
7980622,4,B00008974A,"The full title of this DVD is ""The Evil Dr Ichigaki"", and it contains 4 episodes of Yu Yu Hakusho. This DVD covers the second round of the Dark Tournament.
Yusuke and his friends are forced to compete against Team Ichigaki, who are basically human, rather than demonic like most of the competitors. I hesitate to say more, because I don't want to give anything away. Suffice it to say that we learn more about the Masked Fighter, good triumphs enough to make it to Round Three, and evil is punished.
As the Dark Tournament progresses, Yusuke's team is suffering an increasing number of injuries, and is getting worn down. There are at least six more episodes of Dark Tournament after this DVD, so there should be some challenging fights ahead. In this way, this DVD is exactly like every other YYH release.",1046995200,3,806,4.643356643356643
7980623,5,B00008974A,This DVD is perhaps the best of the English released Yu Yu Hakusho dvd's yet. The story becomes even more interesting with new plot twists and character turmoil. Like most other YYH dvd's there are awsome battles and new attacks. In this dvd Team Urameshi fights as together in a 3 on 3 battle royal in their second round fight. This product is great if you enjoy anime and are already familiar with the Yu Yu Hakusho story line and characters. And fortunately this DVD doesn not leave you on the edge of your seat with a cliffhanger like the last batch of DVD releases in December.,1043625600,2,582,4.4485981308411215
