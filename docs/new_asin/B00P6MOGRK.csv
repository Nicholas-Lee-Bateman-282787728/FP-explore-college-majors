6787837,5,B00P6MOGRK,the movie was excellent.  best war movie i have ever seen by far.  this dvd is pretty nice as well...my only complaint is that the movie is on both discs so you do have to change out discs roughly halfway through...but at least this version is still in print and the audio and film quality were fine.  several extras are also included.,1502409600,7,335,4.370967741935484
6787838,5,B00P6MOGRK,"Great movie. Quite brutal as one might expect given the subject matter, but definately worth a look.",1494806400,4,100,4.9411764705882355
6787839,1,B00P6MOGRK,Vastly overrated in the positive reviews. Hammy overacting. The only positive might be the historical portrayal of the brutal killings the Nazis committed against Russian citizens during the war.,1493164800,,195,5.758620689655173
6787840,4,B00P6MOGRK,Interesting movie about WW2 from the perspective of the Russians. Helps explain the harsh treatment of the Germans following the fall of Berlin.,1437955200,6,144,5.304347826086956
8686543,5,B00P6MOGRK,"A powerhouse of ww2 film making, this film tells about the Belorussian genocide first hand through the eyes of children, always the first to suffer in wars, also is a good antidote to the constant pushing of a ""Jews"" only holocaust, the holocaust was not just Jews as modern media wants people to think but Belorussians, Russians, Slavs, Poles, the mentally ill, intellectuals, Christians, and Germans.",1533081600,,402,5.106060606060606
8686544,5,B00P6MOGRK,Most realistic war movie I've seen.,1529539200,,35,5.0
8686545,2,B00P6MOGRK,"Not a very good movie.  Poorly done, with little excitement.  The Germans are portrayed like fanatics when both of those sides were equally guilty of atrocities.  The only good historical scene is the constant FW 189 flying over for reconnaissance.",1521936000,,248,5.15
8686546,3,B00P6MOGRK,It's all about a kid's life in Russia during the war.  Some will like it but I did not.,1519516800,,87,3.5789473684210527
8686547,5,B00P6MOGRK,At least in the top three of war movies,1510704000,,39,3.4444444444444446
8686548,1,B00P6MOGRK,Its a great movie but the second disc of the movie was covered with scratches and it really pisses me off!,1509148800,,106,4.095238095238095

8686551,5,B00P6MOGRK,"A very harrowing look at the brutalities of which the Nazis and there collaborators did to the peasant population of Eastern Europe during World War 2.  A very surreal picture that is almost a nightmare acted out. The information revealed later on as to the making of this film clearly shows how much the director and film crew strove for authenticity regarding the type of images seen here. Of course, it's not a documentary, but as close to one as anyone could get from a dramatized picture. There are scenes in this movie that will haunt everyone familiar with the true incidents of that time and place in history. Any true WW2 buff should see this film. It is as close to realistic as any fictional war film that I have every seen -- and I've seen over 80 war films.

Certainly one of the most anti-war films ever made, seen through the eyes of those who most suffer from war: the civilians!

P.S. Post War Soviet propaganda and atrocities are irrelevant here; this film is precisely about the events that transpired while Russia was an Allie in the war, not a later enemy to be hated. Try to concentrate of the fact that MILLIONS of human beings -- including children -- suffered and died surrounding the events depicted in this motion picture.",1505001600,11,1249,4.591928251121076
8686552,5,B00P6MOGRK,A classic that stays with you long after viewing it. This movie is timeless and I have no doubt that i will still move people a hundred years from now.,1502928000,5,151,4.066666666666666
