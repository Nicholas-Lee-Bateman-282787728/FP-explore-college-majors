3531456,5,B001DJ7KHS,"Very surprising. I can see why certain people like it, heck, it's pretty much a must-see for fans of this type of B movie schlock. I bought it by accident and was going to get a refund but I decided to watch it. I am glad I did. I am one of those fans and I really liked it. It has a feel similar to Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, which I also appreciate. Knock this down to a 2 star rating if you don't like this type of cinema. BTW the ""porn"" isn't that prevalent, it's more of a sin = death type of movie that goes a bit farther than allot of films do. Enjoy!",1462752000,,558,3.8189655172413794

I'm not familiar with the source material, which may have helped, but  the story felt very indecisive, like it couldn't pick a focus and so never really got out of the gate to deliver up to its promise. However, the acting was better then you'd expect (and Trace Adkins as The Man? Awesome!), the dialogue was often hilarious, and the make up was awesome.

3531473,1,B001DJ7KHS,"I really do enjoy low budget horror films.  But this one was just so terrible that I could only find one about it that I liked.  The costumes just looked like they were lazily done, and they weren't scary at all.

The plot doesn't really make much sense.  Why would you make a deal with the devil to have the power to kill everyone you hate, only to have them resurrected as zombies and you're then stuck with them for eternity as zombies?  If she really hated them as much as she supposedly did in this movie, wouldn't you want make sure that they stayed dead instead of having them around forever?

The only part of this movie that I liked was the brief appearance of Dale Dickey, I really liked how funny she was in ""My Name is Earl,"" and it was cool to see her here.  But even that little ray of sunshine couldn't make this movie interesting.

If you like zombies and horror, this is a movie that you can pass on.",1417219200,,917,4.2

It came in the mail from Netflix, although no one in my house knows why because everyone says they didn't add it, but my mom and I watched it anyways. The reason why I gave it five stars, it scared the crap out of me. Not in the typical, jump out of your seat or scream way...this movie actually gave me a nightmare. I made the mistake of watching it again while I was house sitting for a family all alone at like 10pm. Not my smartest decision....",1401753600,,534,4.047169811320755

I already recommended it to a couple people already.. they happen to like horror movies.",1397433600,,374,4.485294117647059
3531477,5,B001DJ7KHS,I bought this movie because of Trace Adkins .. I thought Trace in a Horror Movie How Cool. Although he makes a couple of cameos in it . Its still a GREAT Movie. I would compare it to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986). Due to the comedic parts of it. All and All an excellent movie.

3531478,5,B001DJ7KHS,This movie is highly underrated. It is both comical and frightening at the same time. The actors did a wonderful job in portraying their respective roles. This movie is not the typical cliche horror flick but shows a lot of deep psychological struggles that people go through. And how other people's actions may have an impact on a person's actions and rationality. I would defiantly recommend this movie to anyone who loves  a bit of screaming and a bit of laughing.  I enjoyed it a lot.,1387324800,,488,4.662790697674419

3531483,3,B001DJ7KHS,"A deal with the devil places a curse over the local trailer park, turning its tenants into a pack of redneck zombies from hell that are left to clean up any of the roadkill that wanders in off of the highway. Unluckily for a bus full of miscreant teens, this means them. Straight out of the pages of the Imperium comics comes TRAILER PARK OF TERROR, a zom com that is as trashy as its name implies. What opens up as a unique new horror anthology quickly falls back into your typical hack 'n slash. The writers apparently care as little about their characters as the audience does, seeing as how the troubled teens do nothing to garner our support besides getting naked and dying. What we do have here are some awesome special effects by the Drac Studios team, who introduces us to some wicked make-up designs that bring the undead hillbillies back to life. It is only unfortunate that the story and humor weren't any stronger, because there is a ton of wasted potential that will hopefully be reintroduced in a sequel.

Check it out you won't be disappointed. Pretty much a girl who is abused and mistreated by the freakish inhabitants of the trailer-park,Darla plans on leaving the park with a boyfriend but he gets killed by the inhabitants. Darla makes a deal with the devil & goes back for her much deserved revenge. Fast forward 30-40 years as the paper clippings in the news say missing people still not found. Well on rainy nights this ""park"" suddenly appears and entrances them in a sadistic game of perverse suffering & sin. It is all a part of the deal made with the devil,to take the souls of the sick,the weak & the only twist is the ending. That surprised me but hey it is cool. Gore galore,lots of adult graphic scenes and alot of zombie terror. Fun B splatter film with a good story.",1350259200,,932,4.393063583815029
3531486,4,B001DJ7KHS,"I was expecting to be let down again, since i had a few flops come my way... This movie is pretty darn cool.  Seems the main complaint is that the people in the park aren't zombies.  They are, but they aren't.  They are the damned - much like 2001 maniacs.  This is a story of someone basically selling their soul for revenge, and damning all in the trailer park.  They are generally zombies and ""do"" eat people, it was mentioned a couple times.  They can only be out at night though so they do not follow typical zombie rules.  The movie is fun and gory with rockabilly flair. I have basically mentioned 2001 maniacs and that is mostly what this is like, so if you enjoyed that film - this is close to it.",1347580800,,706,4.223880597014926
3531487,3,B001DJ7KHS,"I love zombie movies, but this is not a zombie movie. There's no eating of braaaains and you can't ""kill"" them by shooting them in the head (I assume, since nobody actually tried). It's just a bunch of pissed-off re-animated redneck corpses who have to kill any visitors to their trailer park before sunrise. It's more Texas Chainsaw Massacre than Night of the Living Dead. But, cheesy (of course). Aside from the lack of zombies in this zombie movie, though, it has a lot going for it. The film quality, acting, make-up, effects, and soundtrack are all really good. If you can get over the disappointment of the missing zombies (I couldn't), it's an entertaining watch.",1339545600,,670,4.7844827586206895

3531491,3,B001DJ7KHS,"Somewhere between Tobe Hooper and Sam Raimi lies Steven Goldman. He has a few projects under his belt and this is the most recent and only feature length horror film to his credit. That's why it's such a shame.

He shows a genuine flair for directing. There are a lot of deft touches throughout and he elicits some very good performances from the cast. Aside from Tracy Walter (in a minute part) I didn't recognize any of the other cast members, but they all turned in surprisingly good performances. The camera work, editing and soundtrack were all good. What really sinks this puppy is the script.

Here's the scoop. A young girl in a southern trailer park is set to go on a date with a guy who might lead her out of the trailer park life. He gets killed by a couple of the residents. As she flees the scene, she runs into the Devil who gives her a gun and tells her to do everyone in. She does just that and years later they are all the walking dead. A bus, driven by a preacher, and loaded with young misfits he's trying to ""save"", runs into a storm and seeks refuge in said trailer park. Now it's a game of who will survive.

Now....trailer parks have garnered a particular reputation over the years and it isn't a good one, but this is downright nasty. And that's what helps sink this script. This is very sordid, seamy and mean-spirited. Much of the ugliness revolves around sex. There is an Asian massage 'therapist', the mom who has to engage in the making of adult films with the local sheriff for her husband. Then there's the grossly overweight resident that is horribly unkempt and eats all manner of unspecified meat. And, of course, the all-purpose male redneck who is involved in any number of illegal activities. They are just an overall grizzly bunch whose existence one would just rather not consider.

Then there's the plot itself. Putting a group of people in peril is not original, but it requires a method. You need to meet the people and there is a hierarchy established which dictates who gets killed in which order and who is the last man standing (so to speak). They totally miss that here. Though each character is different, you don't get to know any of them well enough to build a sympathy. They are killed in no particular order and the choice for the survivor is entirely arbitrary.

This IS a watchable movie and fans of nasty, gory horror will no doubt enjoy it. But it's definitely ugly and I hope Goldman gets a shot at a better script down the line because he seems to have some genuine talent and it would be a shame to let it go to waste.",1304294400,,2577,4.428270042194093
3531492,5,B001DJ7KHS,Well I have nothing bad to say about my purchase. The DVD is in great condition and it arrived alot sooner that expected.,1299888000,,121,4.304347826086956
3531493,3,B001DJ7KHS,"Anyone that's spent any amount of time in a real Tennessee Trailer Park may not be impressed (because there's nothing more scary than having to come up with $150 a month for rent or getting your tires slashed) but this is a movie worth watching just for some of the crazy scenes. It's one of those you might not want to go back and watch the entire movie but you would go to the scene menu, cue it up and say to your friends ""Hey, watch this!""

The story is kind of weak. Girl is treated bad in a trailer park. She makes a deal with the Country Music Superstar Trace Adkins Devil and apparently he gives her some kind of future revenge come back to life powers. For some reason she teams up with the other dead people/zombies that treated her bad and they all treat young people they don't even know bad just for stopping by the trailer park.

Here's the reasons I bought this movie in order:

1. I know it's stupid but like hundreds of other movies I've watched it had a really good DVD box cover. Cool box art and pictures move movies more than anything. Especially horror movies. The movie actually has that kind of neon green look that's on the cover. I've been fooled so many times by these horror box covers that I get really excited when one pays off!

2. Trace Adkins. I read the back of the box and Mr. Hillbilly Bone Trace Adkins is in the movie. If you're from the south. They ain't nobody cooler than Trace Adkins. If you are from up North just imagine that Obama's name was listed as one of the people in the movie. You would have whipped your EBT card out and had time to watch this during your paid vacation for the worker's comp hangnail claim that you are recovering from. Mr. Honkey Tonk Badonkadonk probably ain't in the movie for a total of five-minutes but if you watch the credits all the way through he's got a pretty good tune that plays called ""Welcome To Hell"". Trace's real life is actually way more scary than any horror movie. The guy has actually been shot in the heart by his then wife! Google that one. I ain't lying. That's just one of many horrible injuries Mr. Ala-Freakin-Bama has endured!

3. I bought this at an Essex Retail Outlet store in Cookeville, Tennessee for a dollar. The plastic on the cover was ripped really bad and the DVD had some light scratches on it. I couldn't pass up that kind of deal.

Don't kid yourself and believe that this movie is anywhere near as good as 2005's ""2001 Maniacs"". It's not. There's no Robert Englund type to carry this movie. It's probably considered more enjoyable for the modern horror crowd than ""2000 Maniacs"" but just because that movie has to be viewed in a 1964 mindset to be appreciated.

You want to laugh at some uber creative gore and hear a pretty cool soundtrack for a straight to DVD movie? Put a non-refundable deposit, maybe the title to your 1979 Trans Am, down on ""TRAILER PARK OF TERROR!""",1296000000,,2886,4.373134328358209

The lead white trash ghoul /girl is hotter then doughnut grease and the cast over all is good, but for the high level of splatter here and for seeing the unrated version were oh were was the nudity ? I mean really, every one has a lot of sex, all of which is done with clothes on. I loved the red neck rocker who sings us a song here and there and the rest of the dead cast is funny.

Naomi is a beautiful woman living in a trailer park full off ugly, sterotypical trailer park trash. She is meeting a boy for a dance but three men show up and harrass her and kill her boyfriend by accident. She then makes an epic speech, runs off, and runs into Trace Adkins. He's either the devil or god, who knows. He gives her a gun and she goes up to the trailer park and kills everyone and then blows up the park. The credits roll with a bunch of newspaper articles of missing people, ala 2001 Maniacs (the remake to the original). We meet a group of troubled teens and then they got trapped in a rain storm! They hit a truck in the middle of the road and end up in the trailer park that Naomi lives in. The movie is slow paced but soon begins to pick up. The monsters looked good, the gore was good, and the music was also pretty damn good. The ending was weak as the goth girl makes the same speech Naomi did after he boyfriend was killed and they just walk off. A driver picks her up and takes her to a truck stop. Why not a hospital, I do not know. They pan on a shot of Trace Adkins smiling as they drive off and the burned down trailer park.

3531502,4,B001DJ7KHS,"Trailer Park of  Terror (Steven Goldmann, 2008)

By far the most pleasant surprise of the week's movie watching, Trailer Park of Terror is another comic book adaptation that managed to get no distribution in an age where the comic book adaptation is king (cf. My review of The Dead One a few months ago). Goldmann's last feature effort was the awful Toby Keith vehicle Broken Bridges, and to be honest, I wasn't expecting a great deal. Goldmann's continuing fascination with bad country music continues here (there's a Trace Adkins cameo), but other than that, this was a very fun ride.

High-school beauty queen Norma (Nichole Hiltz, recently of the TV series In Plain Sight) is stuck in the trailer park, but she sees the possibility of an escape: she's found herself a boyfriend from outside, and hopes she can use him as her ticket out. Until, that is, some of the less savory inhabitants of the place decide he's not good enough for their little Norma and show him the door. Permanently. Enraged, Norma makes a deal with the devil (Adkins), who gives her a sawed-off shotgun. Oh, yeah. Fast-forward a few years, to an idealistic youth pastor (Matthew del Negro, probably best-known at this point for a minor role on The Sopranos) and the six charges with whom he's spent the last week in a woodland retreat. After an accident during a rainstorm, they find themselves at the same trailer park, now deserted except for Norma, who invites them in for coffee and scary stories, and insists they spend the night...

There seem to be two types of people who watch this movie. There are those who find the first half-hour, the story of Norma and her deal with the devil, to have been full of promise, and the rest of the movie bad, and those who thought the first half-hour was dull as dishwater and the rest of it was fun. I liked both parts for different reasons. The first half-hour does, in fact, feel like an entirely different movie. There's an element of absurdity to it, because Goldmann takes all the stereotypes and amps them up to the nth degree, but Norma's pathos is entirely believable despite the ludicrousness of the situation itself. Then we get to the pastor and the kids, and while the plot here changes gears entirely, I thought the quality of the acting stayed level. What does change is that the absurdity sticks out like a sore thumb, rather than achieving the same delicate balance it did in the first part. Thus, while the entire movie is a comedy-horror hybrid, the comedy part feels a lot more natural in the first bit, and like it's trying way too hard in the last. I was more than willing to forgive it, because there's a lot of darned good acting in this flick, given the budget they must have had; in the world of modern no-budget horror, a lot of aspects of this film put it right up there with Deadbirds and Shallow Ground, two of my favorites of recent years. No, it's not without its pitfalls, but so much about this movie speaks of a guy who really gets both comic-book adaptations and horror films that I found it absolutely impossible not to like, bad country music and all.

3531507,3,B001DJ7KHS,"If I'd known that Trailer Park of Terror was based on a comic book series by Imperium Comics, I would have viewed it a bit differently from the beginning.

I will, however, preface this review by saying that this is a very well made film with top notch blood-spurting, makeup and digital effects, great cinematography, and excellent sound production. The viewer must keep in mind that it is intended to be a fun horror romp, and should not be taken too seriously. it's an anything goes horror flick with many redeeming qualities. A true fan of horror comedy (this film tries hard), one who can check his or her brain at the door, will have a few chuckles, and even maybe a guffaw as the film unfolds.

A few familiar faces in the cast include Priscilla Barnes and veteran character actor Tracey Walter, who serves up a few rather unintriguing lines as a patron of the truck-stop diner, and returns in the end to help out a survivor.

Trailer Park of Terror does have a hot blonde in the beginning...

... which takes place at the trailer park sometime in 1980 or 81, where Norma (Nichole Hiltz), our hot blonde born into the wrong way of life, is bothered, berated and bullied by the trailer trash on her way to meet her ticket out of that hell hole: her boyfriend Aaron. On her way out of the park her story is musically narrated by a sideburned southern-rock guitar-Elvis with bad Billy Ray Cyrus hairdo and a Billy Idol lip.

But alas, her runaway dream is not to be. Aaron is inadvertantly off-ed by the trailer trash and as Norma runs away from the hokey pokey she encounters a mysterious southern-rock-devil-went-down-to-Georgia stranger (Trace Adkins) who gives her a new ticket. A ticket for revenge in the form of a gun. But it comes with a hefty price tag.

Returning to the trailer park Norma makes quick business of all those who harrassed and humiliated her. Then she sits next to the fat lady she shot through the mouth, where she turns on the propane gas, lights up a smoke and waits for the explosive fire to seal the deal. Singing her ""come to me Satan"" song.

Jump ahead, through a montage of newspaper clippings and signs posted on bulletin boards flashing across the screen, we're clued in to a trend of missing persons cases. Finally the somewhat nauseating camera pans end and we arrive in 2008, outside a roadside diner where a busload of kids from a church retreat group have stopped for some drinks and snacks before they continue their journey back from a week of finding salvation for their various depraved activities. Apparently the week at camp didn't work. But they learn what they should be repentant of as the film moves on.

We're briefly introduced to the characters that will take us through the rest of the film, but not really enough to care about what happens to them, except for maybe the goth chick played by Jeanette Brox. I'm partial to goth chicks.

After shoplifting porn, attempted sex in the bathroom, and a certain favor in exchange for drugs, the unsaved are back on the bus. The film does have it's share of bad one-liners, evident by the first lame line delivered by the porno-shoplifter kid on the bus when asked to check his cellphone for service. He lamely quips, ""looks like a deadzone."" Groan. The commercials from a cellphone company that rhymes with horizon are comical, but the line did not work here.

I don't want to give away the whole story. Suffice to say the bus is rendered inoperative, and a thunderstorm dumps buckets of rainwater on them as they seek refuge at... you guessed it, the Trailer Park of Terror. Hey, the real horror has only just begun.

Now we get into some real gruesome gore effects, and finally a decent dose of humor. See, the trailer trash are still there, haunting the place where they died, in the form of crazy, red-neck zombies hell bent on having a good gruesome time.

Perhaps the funniest bit comes after our sideburned southern-rock guitar-Elvis with bad Billy Ray Cyrus hairdo (sans Billy Idol lip, you'll see why) is blown apart when he accidentally steps on his own claymore mine as he chases the goth chick through the woods. One of his cronies attempts to reassemble him with duct tape and a staple gun. This is when we realize the movie is supposed to be a comedy/horror, and it might work there on out after all.

Things get a little inflated as our zombie rocker jams from atop his public address platform narrating the depraved scene unfolding in one of the trailers below. And the intensity elevates right to the crash up ending.

Ultimately the film ends up growing on the viewer. Well it grew on me. Check your brain at the door, it's just entertainment of a sort. It was funny in parts, and well made. I might watch it again.",1238716800,,4734,4.58698224852071
3531508,3,B001DJ7KHS,"This was funny and gorey. Not that scarey, but well done for a straight to DVD horror movie. Definitely better than others I have seen. It's somewhat like Rest Stop meets Devil's Rejects, but it's really a unique horror movie all its own. Nichole Hiltz is genius and really should have had more screen time. The movie starts to drag a little towards the end, which probably isn't good since it's only 91 minutes long. If you're not expecting a fine cinematic experience and like funny, bloody zombie horror movies, give this a shot. Good, fun rental!",1236556800,,550,4.680412371134021
3531509,4,B001DJ7KHS,"As we all know, there is no shortage of direct to video horror films out there(mostly zombie oriented).  You only need to scan the shelves at the local video store and you'll see probably more than you'll ever have time to watch in your lifetime.  And there's at least two more out every week!  They have snappy, midnight movie titles and equally snappy artwork on the covers(well, not all of them).  And of course we rent or purchase them, and usually end up screwed.  Many of them look like they were filmed with a low quality digital camcorder, many promise something(a killer, creature, or amount of gore or sex) that's never delivered.  And many praise the appearance of a cult film star who shows up for 6 seconds in the beginning of the film.  Even those of us who adore low budget film making, and can make allowances for their shortcomings, find ourselves viewing things we can barely tolerate.
I'll admit that this film led me to believe I'd be hosed again.  After all, both the zombie thing and the crazy redneck thing have been pounded into the ground.  Not to mention the whole new slew of ""retro horror"" films that try to recreate the style of a particular subgenre(Texas Chainsaw Massacre and 80s Slasher films seem to be the main offenders) from a particular era almost always fail.
Imagine my surprise when I watched Trailer Park of Terror and found that:
A) It looks like a real movie, not a student project.
B) It was indeed a ""retro"" style horror film, but...it actually worked.
C) The makeup jobs on the zombie rednecks were quite impressive.
D) The soundtrack was actually fitting to the movie.
E) There was actually a cool story-a slight variation on the typical plot of a band of kids who end up lost and terrorized by crazy rednecks.
There are more positives, but those are the ones that immediately jump out.  The plot of this movie concerns an attractive chick, Norma, who massacres all of her neighbors at the trailer park where she lives, then commits suicide.  Before the massacre, she had made a bargain with(we can assume)the devil.  Now Norma governs the trailer park with the undead rednecks she once killed.
A bus carrying a group of troubled teens involved in a religious rehabilitation program, breaks down in the rain and wind up seeking shelter at....The Trailer Park of Terror of course.  Here the teens are relentlessly pursued, terrorized, killed and tortured by the demonic hillbillies.  One poor S.O.B. is skinned alive, then fried in boiling oil!
For the modern age, this is a nice midnight movie that brings to mind the feel of films like Motel Hell, Texas Chainsaw 2 and perhaps Night of the Demons.  It's not a winking at the camera homage, and it doesn't feel the need to reference other films of the genre(though there is a nod to H.G. Lewis and 2000 Maniacs at the beginning).  It's gruesome, crazy, and of course it's tongue in cheek.
My only complaint would be that director, Goldman should try to keep the camera still.  He goes for that annoying rock video camera style that's supposed to be ""cool"", but isn't, just irritating.  Thankfully he uses it sparingly and doesn't go overboard with it.
While Trailer Park of Terror won't win any awards(though it did make Rue Morgue's Guiltiest Pleasure Of 2008 spot) and won't go down in history as a great or classic horror film, I'd definitely recommend it to cult horror fans who are a bit sick of getting burned on stuff like Ulli Lommel's Zombie Nation.",1236470400,2,3456,4.684297520661157
3531510,4,B001DJ7KHS,"Well, if this ain't one knee slappin' redneck rendezvous from hell; Yeehaa!  I thought this movie was very entertaining, to the point of hilarious in some instances.  No, not the so-bad-it's-laughable type of film; It's really good all the way down to the raucous humor in it.  The plot works well and the characters are believable, as are the excellent effects and makeup; good cinematography as well.  I'm critical of the zombie type of horror films, especially when they make attempts at humor too.  This one just pulls it off, kind of in the same way ""Dead Alive"" does.  This movie is definitely reminiscent of ""2001 Maniacs"" though; If you liked that one, give this a try and I doubt you'll be disappointed.

I took away a star because this is not the perfect movie of course.  I also really wished that Trace Adkins had more screen time. Even in the little time he had in this you can see the talent, and ow what a hunk.

Years after taking revenge on them all, she still keeps company there with them all, only they all happen to be kind of undead.  Naturally, this doesn't bode too well for the bus full of teens that have broken down in the area.  Wholly predictable, Trailer Park of Terror offers up some great blood and gore effects work, but it takes itself a little too seriously to have as much fun with it as one possibly could.

3531522,1,B001DJ7KHS,"Some movies when released almost right a way build a cult audience and that's what has happened with Trailer Park of Terror, but my question is were we watching the same movie? Now there are plenty of classics and cult classics I may dislike, but can understand why so many people did like them. And there are movies I love that are hated, but again I understand why. But in the case of Trailer Park of Terror I cannot for the life of me understand how this has picked up an audience.

Watching Trailer Park of Terror for me was quite a chore and by the end I wasn't even paying attention since I just didn't care what happened anymore. Trailer Park of Terror for me easily rates as one of the worst horror movies I have seen this year. Off the top of my head the only movie that was worse was the remake of April Fool's Day, but Trailer Park of Terror isn't far behind.

The screenplay by Timothy Dolan was horrible, the characters are useless and not in the least way are they entertaining. Dolan tries to be too smart for his own good and write a campy cult classic and it's just not working. The concept seems like cult movie gold, but Dolan screws it up and writes a horrible screenplay.

Director Steven Goldmann doesn't really fair much better, while all the blame cannot be placed on him since he didn't have much of a script, but his scenes are paced very sloppy with no feel of excitement and visually the movies looks rather lousy. The first 50-minutes are pretty much a waste and add nothing to the movie. These 50 or so minutes could have easily been cut out with no harm done to the movie. By the time the zombie action starts I didn't really care. And the worst is the movie doesn't even deliver when the action starts; the scenes are lame and try too hard to be entertaining and you really won't find anything new here at all.

When all is said and done Trailer Park of Terror is a total misfire and for me fails on every level. While my rating might be a bit too harsh it was potential totally wasted.",1226016000,6,2018,4.288713910761155

This time the unlucky victims are a van load of foul-talking teens and a counselor heading for Jesus Camp-too bad they never made it because if anyone needed Jesus Camp....Hmmmm..let's see... they all use the f-bomb, one girl is a goth, one kid likes looking at nudie pictures and there's a couple who have sex at the drop of a condom.  Even the counselor has problems and he is always making the sign of the cross when he has a wicked thought-needless to say he makes the sign of the cross a lot.

The movie is gruesome and gory-one poor guy has his chest skinned to make jerky-then he is lowered into a giant fry-o-later alive and becomes barbeque.  One of the killings was new for me-a girl rips open a guys back with her feet.
