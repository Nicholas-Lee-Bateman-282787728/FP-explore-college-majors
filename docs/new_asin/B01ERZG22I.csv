7739761,3,B01ERZG22I,"This is for ""Restoration"" 2016 and not the Robert Downey Jr. version which Amazon has lumped together.

Dr. Rebecca Jordan (Emily O'Brien  ) and her husband handyman Todd (Adrian Gaeta ) move into a new home that requires some restoration. They discover an old Teddy Bear with a girl's diary inside.  Weird things start to happen which include a bunch of jump scares.  Granted a kid's diary is no ""Evil Dead"" book, but there is something going on as the diary indicated there were issues in the neighborhood.
About 40 minutes into the film things go to the next level. The ending was pretty much expected and I was hoping it would be something else, as the twist was a mixed horror genre.  The ending messed up what was a half decent ghost story.

7739769,1,B01ERZG22I,"Good grief, multiple disappointments just in the first fifteen minutes.

1) What a terrible beside manner she has. The poor guy is trying to die and she's practically commanding him to hang on so his family can see him one last time. It's not about the family, he's the one dying, and she's stressing him out in his last moments. Bad doctoring.

2) Her husband throws a bear at her without realizing there's a book inside it?

3) 'Surgery' on a stuffed animal?

4) A doctor should be smart enough not to try to open a diary lock with a kitchen knife. Come on!

7739783,1,B01ERZG22I,"Who are these cover artists? They should be hung by the neck until dead for gross fraud. This home made attempt at 'watching paint dry' was created on the premise that some extremely tame sex scenes should suffice in place of 1. A story 2. Acting skill 3. Atmosphere 4. Pretty much everything a movie should be. I don't know if I've seen worse, the ""F-"" Prime horror flicks all blur together after a while. The synopsis gives the impression there's a ""creepy kid"", great! because you can't go too wrong with a creepy kid. Well, sorry for the spoiler, but there isn't one. She's mentioned but she isn't present in the movie. What there is, in the last dying moments of something that started on life support, is a 25 year old guy with braided hair in a dress (well it seemed like it to me and it was the closest thing to horror here). This utter drivel wouldn't keep the interest of a 3 year old let alone scare or disturb them.

7739784,1,B01ERZG22I,"I just had to warn people not to spend their money on this crap. Terrible wooden acting, cheesy dialogue, ridiculous plot, zero suspense, you name it. Don't be fooled by the high reviews. This is definitely one to avoid at all costs.",1489622400,,233,4.571428571428571
7739785,3,B01ERZG22I,"Apparently this film is very polarizing.  There are a lot of people pissed about the 5 star reviews because they are wrong...in their opinion.  And the five star people loved the movie.  I'd like to say that both sides have their points...however anytime you read a review that says worst film, blah blah blah, it makes me think someone has missed a hell of a lot of films out there.  This is far from the worst horror film I've seen.  But on that note it isn't exactly high on the list of good films either.  I think this film can best be summarized as ""Meh"".

The film tries really hard to set up a spooky tale with a twist.  Unfortunately, a couple of cheapo jump scares aside it never makes it.  There is the ghost of a girl, but she seems...kinda hit or miss on what she's supposed to be communicating.  The big reveal as to whats going on was obvious from maybe half or two thirds of the way through the film.  The twist ending is only a twist in that it doesn't play out EXACTLY like you thought it would...but just to be sure they hammer it home like you might not have figured it out.

So telling you all that, I'd say if you are on Prime wondering what to watch next and this is free, you'll get your monies worth.  If there's a price tag attached, you've been warned.",1487721600,2,1278,4.209876543209877

I don't know how movie reviews rentals are  refunded. Wish I could help. Here I go, I'm about to watch it anyway and I'm going in with a positive  mind set and crossing my fingers.

So it's no ""big budget"" horror, that's ok. To me those are the best sometimes. I enjoyed the movie and I'm watching it for the second time.",1472601600,,449,4.113636363636363
7739805,5,B01ERZG22I,"I loved it! And here's why:

To me the movie is about a mystery. It's creepy and haunting in places. With the exception of the ""blood and guts"" later on (because I prefer movies that scare me in my mind), I have to say I really enjoyed it!

Since I see this film as such, it works perfectly in this framework. (All of this is just my humble opinion, of course. :) )

So let's break this down a bit...

As the movie begins, I wanted to notice how my feelings were in regard to the story. How did they do? Did it flow? Plus were there plot twists that kept me guessing?

As the film started, everything is normal. The characters are introduced and I thought okay, I can handle this. Then the husband finds the bear

Shortly after that point is when I started to become creeped out.. (This is when I knew I was on a good ride, when I noticed that.) Later it switched gears again, which left me realizing that the Filmmakers really knew how to put something like this together.

The ending surprised me. Leaving me going wow.

There is so much going on that I felt I could watch this again and enjoy it even more.

The question ""Did it flow?"" I can honestly say that it did for me. It progressed in a logical manor. The tension building as the mystery was being revealed.

All in all I can say that if you enjoy a good haunting mystery, you should check this out. (I believe it's billed as a ""horror"". I think it meets this genre head on but brings it's own unique flare to it.)

7739851,3,B01ERZG22I,The movie was fine. But just fine. When we rented it the movie had a five star rating. Apparently the directors friends got to rate it first.  This movie is a solid three star but that's it. The premise was fine but left you wondering if you were really understanding what you thought you were understanding. The production value was great. But the storyline and acting were three stars at best. For the price I wish we would've passed.,1466726400,5,436,4.518987341772152

Definitely worth a look for supernatural and occult film fans, and horror folks who want a smarter, creepier date-night movie.",1466640000,2,388,4.594202898550725

7739854,3,B01ERZG22I,"I sat down with my wife recently and watched this movie as she had found it and thought it looked interesting. I have to agree with her after watching it that it is an interesting movie. The story itself is pretty original it does go into some of the common ""demonic"" tropes at times, but over all these are pretty shallow cuts.
My one gripe with the movie, and it is this one gripe that cut off two stars, is the story just doesn't go deep enough by this I mean, the story telling, has a pretty darn good setup, they had quite a lot to work with here. But when it came time to deliver it was all over just to fast.
Is it worth paying money to rent, well, maybe. Personally I would say wait till this comes up on prime or you can rent it for cheaper then 5 dollars.",1466553600,2,765,4.006535947712418

7739856,5,B01ERZG22I,"Very atmospheric little horror pic. Beautifully shot, and the music warrants a soundtrack. Zack Ward's performance really stands out.  Having been in the industry since he was a child shows in his comfort on screen.  But, for me, the highlight was the cameo of stage and screen actress, Pamela Hyatt.  She brought true emotional depth to the film.  The consequences of crimes from the past truly come to light in her scene.  Great twist at the end of the movie.  Those, like me, who don't like their endings to be tidy and saccharine sweet, won't be disappointed.",1466380800,,563,4.752577319587629
7739857,1,B01ERZG22I,"Right now this movie has  4/10 stars on IMDB. Even that is too much. I have no way to request a refund. I'm up late with my lady, we'd like to watch a horror movie we've never heard of. I've got Amazon up on my TV through Roku. Oh, creepy ghost girl in new house. 5 stars. OK, I'll buy it, why not? It looks kinda bad but how bad can it be at 5 stars? I remember reading something about Netflix ratings and how they're based off the movies you watch and rate and not from the general public. But no, sure enough, this movie rates 5 stars on Amazon and a measly 4 out of 10 on IMDB.

Bad, really bad. I'm a child of the 80's. I love bad horror movies. This is just painful. We almost turned it off. I want a refund because the reviews are not accurate and there's no way they're real. They read like they were written by someone who's first language is...not English. Which is fine by itself but it really smells like some foreign workers got paid to review this movie. If this was Netflix I'd go ahead and cancel their service and start pirating like it was 2008. If my Amazon Prime membership simply offered movie rentals then I'd go ahead and cancel their service. But, the movie was that bad. I feel completely duped. I don't mind paying but when the reviews are so far off from sites like IMDB then something fishy is going on.

I am trying to get a refund because the whole thing feels like Amazon screwed me. You know I would've rented the Revenant but no, the only option was to buy the movie. I would've rented several other top rated movies, but again the only option was to buy it. Even then do you really even own it? Seriously considering just pirating movies again. I'm trying to play by the rules but disingenuous business practices like this are just...wasteful.

I know I know, get over it. What was I expecting? 5 stars means it has something for everybody. This movie has nothing for anybody. Scratch that, the main actress has very nice bone structure. That's it. I posted a screen capture movie when I bring it up on my phone on Amazon. You can see the 4/10 and 5/5 reviews. Using Roku I could see some other ""IMDB options"" but all that was offered was a list of cast members and now actual IMDB reviews.",1466380800,31,2224,4.250591016548463
7739858,1,B01ERZG22I,"This is probably a 1 and 1/2 star, but I gave it one because of all the fake five star reviews. Zero budget, 4 actors, do a poor job of making a movie you will figure out in the first 10 minutes. There are no special effects to speak of, no sets, pretty much nothing. Not even a decent jump scare (they almost pulled one off, almost).

8759475,4,B01ERZG22I,"I started off watching this with a skeptical mind; the plot involved an 11-year-old girl who mysteriously goes missing, but she somehow managed to keep a diary of her thoughts, and hid it inside a stuffed animal. Right there this struck me as pretty implausible - what 11-year-old keeps a pencil-and-notebook diary at all nowadays (except maybe Amish, or Mormons)? So this kept the movie at a solid 3 stars for me... until it got to the end.
Not going to lie - the ending scared me pretty good. I am an avid horror fan, but I have to say that I don't think this movie is suitable for all viewers. It's not that it's particularly raunchy, or bloody at the end; it's more to do with that creepy, this-is-making-my-skin-crawl feeling you sometimes get, and in this case it wasn't at all comfortable. This is a dark movie. After it was over I said a silent prayer of thanks to God; I'm glad I believe in God, and I'm glad I don't know anyone like the 'friendly neighborhood couple' portrayed in this story (they were frightening).  'Monster movies' can be wonderfully entertaining, but at the end you usually breathe a sigh of relief because you know that monsters aren't real. When 'monsters' are portrayed as people, though (as is shown very effectively here), that seems to stick in my head longer, because these types of monsters look just like everyone else. What started off as just another average, middle-of-the-road story slowly progressed into a darker and darker tunnel... leaving me stunned at the end.
I watched this late at night, and I was supposed to go and check the basement area before bed. After watching this, I skipped it - that's how scary this was. Again, not recommended for sensitive people - it's like drinking an espresso with the coffee grinds sticking to your teeth. You've been warned...",1534550400,,1814,4.70440251572327
