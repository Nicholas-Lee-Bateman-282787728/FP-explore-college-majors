8034889,5,B0002YLDNM,Great anime serie. I tested it wrom the net. I loved it. Be warned that its kiddy. So just try it out on the net. I bought it because I liked it.,1335916800,,145,3.5625
8034890,1,B0002YLDNM,"I purchased it at an anime con, just because I thought it sounded interesting.  I mean, who wouldn't want to transform at will from a child to an adult or vice versa?  However, I found it so boring I fell asleep.  Also, the sweet nature of the anime as a whole would be enough to send a person into a diabetic coma or diabetic shock. There's angelically good, but this anime takes ""sweet""  to a whole other level entirely.  It's like trying to eat an entire bag of sugar by itself in one sitting.  Wanna try it, be my guest.  But don't say I didn't warn you!!!!!!!!",1219363200,,565,4.224299065420561
8034891,4,B0002YLDNM,"This is one show for the kids... most specially to little girls that love to imagine wheresoever they find themselves in to. I usually buy anything ""cute"" and care less whether it turns out a worthy addition to my growing collection of anime or not. BUT, if not for the 2 magical dinosaurs (Pugg & Mugg), I would never suggest this as a ""good buy"" to anyone. Unless, you're one who don't mind listening forever to Lala's English audio (which, by the way, sounded annoying). Some kids may not mind that at all since it's mainly a fantasy story to begin with.

If you must buy something with ""cute-ness"" all over, go for ""Little Snow Fairy Sugar"" instead. While Sugar can be ""annoying, she still have more better moments than Lala.",1217462400,,729,4.564885496183206
8034892,5,B0002YLDNM,"THIS IS NO POP GLAMOUR FASHION CARTOON,BUT A LITTLE GIRL TRANSFORMING INTO A POP STAR THROUGH HER PEN & SKETCH BOOK!!

AWESOME SERIES WITH A VERY SAD ENDING!!

IF YOU LIKED JEM YOU'LL TRULY LOVE FANCY LALA!!!",1145404800,2,208,4.594594594594595
8034893,5,B0002YLDNM,"At first look you will almost certainly dismiss this title as just another piece of ""popstar fluff"" and pass it over. Don't. Fancy Lala is suprisingly intelligent, charming and engaging.

The basic premise is that a young girl is given, for a time, the gift to transform herself into an older girl. She then balances out her time as a child with time becoming a model and eventually a pop idol. Simple enough.

Where this series gets interesting is how it takes this child's experiences as a young adult and uses them to help the child grow, and come to grips with many of the problems which face a kid her age. For instance, the series adeptly deals with a child's fear of divorce, need to learn to balance work and play, understanding the difference between myth and reality, coping with loss, and so on. All in a manner which isn't preachy, just fun.

Other series I'd compare Fancy Lala to are 'Kiki's delivery service' and 'Figure 17.' This is a great title for kids, and it's enjoyable for adults too. See for yourself.",1111104000,13,1025,4.559782608695652
