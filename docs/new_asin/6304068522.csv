771747,3,6304068522,"Five years later the Ghostbusters decide to regroup and save New York City one more time, in spite of the mayors reluctance to let them wreck more havoc.  This time the plot requires that they put a baby in jeopardy.  Hate and pink slime conspires with Vigo the Carpathian (a painting) to takeover the world.  He plans to be reborn through a baby with the help of an irritating sidekick Dr. Janosz Poha (Peter MacNicol).  (Sounds an awful lot like Chucky.)

The same dynamic is repeated.  Same cast, same problems, same bureaucrat pinhead who imperils the city by having the team committed at a crucial moment.  Its all familiar, little better than a remake of the original.  Whats the point?
 Too much of Bill Murray and very little of everyone else also doesnt help.  They should have left well-enough alone.",1488412800,,810,4.7214285714285715

Instead, lowered expectations garner a fresh and funny script with new quirks and nuances. We easily identify and cheer for the protagonists. The visuals are fine; the plot is in gear, and the cameos by Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd are spot-on and not just nostalgic. Editing makes the whole comedy procedural tightly knit and fast-paced.",1477699200,,464,4.886075949367089

772218,4,6304068522,"If you hadn't seen Ghostbusters 2, you definitely need to. Of course nothing is as great as the original, but it was definitely worth seeing. This movie follows the cast from the original ghost busters in some new adventures where a rive of slime is running underneath the city and is causing a great deal of problems. The movie sees greats like Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd, and Sigourney Weaver back to follow up in this great comedy.

This is well worth the price of renting, but you probably should just save yourself some money and buy it outright. It's a good movie and will always be a good backup if you're wanting to relive some of your past or childhood and watch these great movies.",1474329600,2,688,4.504

772527,5,6304068522,My reception of thE Ghostbusters sequel is probably shaded by the fact that I grew up with both movies. I've always loved both films and was shocked when I found out how many fans of the original didn't like Ghostbusters 2.

772588,5,6304068522,"I know a lot of people hate on the sequel but it's still a funny and enjoyable classic.  Not as good as the original, but it's hard to top some primary movies.
The characters and their lines are why you watch this. Not for the story so much. I mean, it's the same story as the first pretty much.

772805,5,6304068522,"I just bought this film. I love Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters 2. The new Ghostbusters film tarnishes that legacy in the name for cheap greed. The only thing that disappoints me more is the fact that Bill Murray appears in this and not the planned films Ivan (egon!) wanted to do. I imagine in an alternate universe Ghostbusters is bigger than Star Wars or Lord of the Rings. In this universe we have two excellent films. Ghostbusters, which will not be surpassed AND this film. Maybe not one of the Greats, yet still great! The only part of this film that is disappointing is the end, I appreciate the overall point (Good can and will win over evil) but the manner in which they did it... first the Statue of Liberty and then the singing... eh, it just seemed a bit lazy to be honest. Like they couldn't think of a better way for the populace of New York to be 'In the Victory!"" I think they could have done a number of different things... like the Ghostbusters calling up citizens with spare packs to defend the city from a horde of ghosts... they could have had new yorkers helping each other out (rather than just running away from a crime) simple, but effective. They could have had the final fight in the open on ground level so everyone can see what is going on, with Vigo winning until people start to try to intervene (distracting him momentarily) so that the ghostbusters can ... save the day rather than just sit around effectively as the clean up crew. Yet the ending aside, nearly everything else about this film is pitch perfect.",1468195200,,1542,4.510714285714286

I think the idea of a megalomanical sadistic warlord from the past coming to modern New York through a painting makes a good ghostly villain. Let's not forget that the movie has the same sense of humor that we loved in the original plus a dancing toaster and a bathtub that tries to eat people.

The Statue of Liberty stepping down from her post when she is brought to life is awesome! That scene always gets my adrenaline rushing with excitement every time I watch it! It's sad that the movie business doesn't do those kinds of things anymore. No one could replace Dan Akroyd, Harold Ramis, Bill Murray, or Ernie Hudson with their banter, wit, and chemistry, because they made what is so special about Ghostbusters! It's way too hard to recreate those friendships! For this sequel, not the best, but worth watching. A 6/10!",1459209600,,681,4.73109243697479

This movie tries too hard with a cute uplifting message. I like the message. I like the idea, but somehow the way it came together was juvenile - like Dora the Explorer level combo.

774157,5,6304068522,The original Ghostbusters is one of the greatest comedies ever made. For some very bizarre reason part 2 was and to a degree even today hated and I`ll never understand why. Even certain cast and crew members hate it. I think its just as fun as the first one. Obviously not as fresh and even uses a similar script structure as the first but its still a very solid sequel that has alot of laughs and thrills. Def a very worthy follow up. Just really sucks that they had to throw away any possible potential for a great reboot and instead make the movie they ended up making.,1457654400,,572,4.305555555555555

774284,3,6304068522,"I'm conflicted on this sequel.  On one hand, yes, it's a comedy sequel.  Generally those are pretty horrible.  And there was a lot of wit, charm, and fun lost from the original.  On the other hand, this movie had quite a few good ideas, and some funny jokes and situations that I still think are really quite good.  But it all kinds day comes together and makes me wonder what could have been.

Vigo the Carpathian is an absolutely excellent Ghostbusters villain.  He's a classic egomaniacal type who still manages to command the scenes he's in.  And as for him being the driving force behind the plot of the movie, I totally buy it.

And I don't even mind the fall from grace that the Ghostbusters experienced after the original movie.  It makes sense, given the context of the people that they dealt with in the original, that what they'd managed to accomplish would be ultimately dismissed by the people that they essentially saved.  And it out them back as the paranormal janitors that they were originally.

What doesn't work for me is the pacing and the overall writing.  The jokes are there sometimes, but it just doesn't have the sharpness or wit that the original had.  A lot of the jokes just come out as sad and tired.  And a lot of the interpersonal stuff going on between characters doesn't seem to have much heart to it.  It's like they are just going through the motions as the plot demands it.  To add to that, some scenes just go on too long without really adding anything to the film.

Honestly, I think this would have made for a killer 40 minute film.  Less as a feature length movie.  It feels like a lot of it drug on just for the sake of padding the running time.

I liked Vigo the Carpathian, the subplot about the negatively charged slime under New York, and the Statue of Liberty scene.  So it's not all bad, and there are some good parts to this.  But it just doesn't quite coalesce into a great film.  Depending on mood, this would either be an okay watch, or I'd hate it and turn it off after 10 minutes.  Part of why I will sit through it is because I liked the characters from the first film.  So I'm grading on a curve.  But I'd have to say that this overall is a middle of the road type film.  Not bad, not great, and averages out to be mediocre.  Wouldn't watch it if you didn't like the first film, but if you did, you might find some things to like about this film too.",1457308800,,2405,4.317673378076063

The first Ghostbusters film wasn't as good as most people think it was, and this one isn't as bad.  It hums along pleasantly enough, never making much of an effort to distinguish itself from the first one, but the cast is just as talented as ever and they do what they can to sell this material, which is actually quite a lot.

There's very little of the ghoulish type ghost and fearsome critters you found in the first movie, and far less feeling of paranormal activity. In other words, it's just stale.

The villain is almost sufficient to follow Gozer  (and, as a plus, isn't an Annie Lennox wannabe), and is the real victim of this movie. He had a lot of potential.

What totally ruined this movie was the ""positive slime"" and the walking Statue of Liberty, and the whole ""unify everyone"" like a bunch of Care Bears to run the bad guy away.

The lack of proton packs is inexcusable. They were by far the coolest hero weapon of the 80's.",1412985600,,718,4.492307692307692

i guess Columbia pictures decided to release the sequel on blu-ray this time
for the 30th Anniversary of the first Ghosbuster's movie
this sequel is still pretty Good film, of course the first one is the best
Bill murray and Dan Akyroyd are still Hillarious in this sequel
Ivan Reitman still Great at Directing the film
if you love to watch the first one, watch the sequel after it.
both films have been mastered in 4k blu-ray technology 2:40:1 widescreen quality
so the amazing picture quality on this sequel is exactly the same as the first one
plus an all new 5.1 master audio track has been given to the sequel aswell.

as for the special features,
there were no extras at all when this film was released on special edition dvd back in 2000 now
well i'm happy to say that Columbia pictures have added a new retrospective featurette
with again Ivan Reitman and Dan Aykroyd interviewed about the sequel
goes for about 15mins, the first 5-7mins they give recollections of the making of the sequel
and then the rest of interview is talked about the GHOSTBUSTER'S Video game
and also a still possible Ghostbuster's 3 sequel which has been talked about for over 10 years now
through Ghosbuster's fan website and Fan Blogs
Dan Aykroyd says that he's already written a few scripts for the 3rd sequel, if there will be one
but it's up to Columbia pictures to give the Go ahead, he talks about it in the interview
very interesting 15mins

from a fans point if view
Harold ramis has passed away now so the magic is Gone as far as i'm concerned
if a 3rd sequel was going to be made, it should've been made back in early 2000-2005 i think
so many years have gone by now so it's to late in my opinion

if you buy GHOSTBUSTERS 30TH ANNIVERSARY BLU-RAY, buy the sequel aswell
Definitely worth the cash, 5 star rating for sure..",1411171200,2,1889,4.5337243401759535

775580,4,6304068522,"Ghostbusters II, while really good and often quite funny, didn't pack the punch of the original.  It's hard to fault the movie.  The original was, well, ORIGINAL.  Now, on the eve of Bill Murray announcing the cast for Ghostbusters III, it seems even more important than ever.

Signourney Weaver still plays the not-so-hapless woman who is now a mother -presumably the baby was Murray's- and she once again gets drawn in with the Ghostbusters.  Rick Moranis still has a very active roll but the highlight performance and achievement of the movie was Vigo, actor/wrestler Wilhelm Von Homburg.

Ghostbusters II is a laugh but it's hard to take it alone considering how fun and unique the original was.  Make no mistake, it's well worth watching, especially if watching the two movies back to back.",1410307200,,795,4.932330827067669

Sorry folks I don't have it yet, but I am definitely buying, unless they drop the ball and it looks no better than the DVD.

As for the film, it is only slightly lesser than the first. Yes, the first is an undeniable genre creating (EFX Comedy) classic. However, the sequel is NOT just a repeat, except for the fact that ghosts must come back. How else can you bring them back? So the plot mechanics need to be forgiven. It's Ghostbusters 2, you knew it would happen, you wanted it to happen, they implied it would happen again with the closing shot of the first film. The writing here is underrated. I think Ackroyd and Ramis got a bum-rap from critics and Murray himself. The first movie was the character set-up, this is the pay off, becasue catching up with these characters is like the best dessert after the best meal ever. Like the later seasons of Seinfeld, the characters are all established so now they can just riff comic gold out of them. Venkman being a TV host, Ray owning an occult bookshop and making b-day party appearances with Winston, and Egon going back to the lab, it's all such a pleasure. Ghostubusters on trial, brilliant! Evil sludge that feeds off of New York bad vibes, brilliant! All of it is hilarious and you almost don't need any ghosts. There are far more funnier one liners in this movie than the first, they just aren't T-Shirt catch phrases (And I owned a ""Who You Gonna Call"" in child's medium). Amazingly, the rest of the cast not only holds their weight with these comic geniuses some of them steal scenes (Peter MacNicol) Only in the last moments does it go super-formulaic and get sequelitis, but before that Gold, Jerry, Gold!

I will return to review actual Bluray. I have been waiting for this one for a while.",1408406400,,1788,4.53250773993808

In 2014, it seemed a tired manifestation of well-worn gestures, body language and badinage. It's as if each time they went into their routines, it was with a backward thought, how did we do this when it looked fresh and funny to the audience. It's quite possible that it still seems fresh and funny, or, at least nostalgically funny, for the audience which remembers them, back then. As I indicate, it seems to me something like the A&C comedy when it burst out of burlesque in New Jersey to the Kate Smith Show on Radio and then quickly into the movies, making audiences of all ages laugh with their distinctive routines as compared to the two rapidly aging comics grinding out their movie quota each year and then bringing it to television mainly for the youngsters.
At any rate, as always Sigourney Weaver looks good even though she is not allowed to do any actingwhile the Guys do their best to infuse their routines with some comedy.

In this movie their ""god"" wanted to ""rape"" someone for the ""son to join the father"". The character (who eventually played on Ally McBeal) knelt and kept saying ""My Lord"". It was very offensive. The plot didn't even make sense. Ghost form out of sewage because of how mean the town is? Come on. Did they poll kindergarteners to fill in the gaps in their plot?

775929,4,6304068522,"Ghostbusters 2(1989) is considered one of the worst sequels ever made. I think it's an underrated sequel. The film does try to appeal to families with its warm, cutesy factor. The producers of the film tried to make it feel ""modern"" with rap and soul music from 1989. Ghostbusters 2 starts with a downbeat tone. Peter and Dana have broken up and the Ghostbusters went out of business. The Ghostbusters have to go back into business as a dead conquerer tries to take over the world on New Year's Eve.
Bill Murray is still great as the cynical, wisecracking Peter Venkman. Acting in dramas helped Murray's career. The formula for Ghostbusters 2 is similar to the first. The film references The Blob(1958) and La Bamba(1987). The film also pokes fun of He-Man! The TV version of Ghostbusters 2 uses alternate takes to cover up curse words. There's some fan service with Slimer driving a bus and stuffing his face with food. Cheech Marin makes a cameo as a guy who sees ghosts from the Titanic! Ghostbusters 2 still blends supernatural horror with comedy. A woman's fur coat comes back to life and hops away!

776013,4,6304068522,"Who ya gonna call? This follow up to the incredibly popular GHOSTBUSTERS is very good even though the first one was a few notches up. Ghost slime and other bad things have returned to New York City just as its inhabitants are getting too comfortable and forgetting what our heroes did for the Big Apple. Bill Murray is his usual awesome self and some of his best lines are dealing with the ghostly villain, especially when he insults it and especially when he delivers the ""sensitive"" speech. He and Sigourney Weaver have some good lines. Dan Akroyd and Harold Ramis return in supporting roles of sorts but Rick Moranis (their night lawyer friend) has equally funny lines as Murray. Peter MacNicol, who was not as well known back then, plays a creepy Slavic artist/scientist who lusts after Weaver's character and makes a deal with the evil entity to gain power.

The 1989 budget for this film was roughly $37M and it yielded a whopping $215M+ at the Box Office. The sequel had what was, at the time, the biggest three-day opening weekend gross in history, a record that was broken one week later by the Michael Keaton BATMAN. (Wiki) Dan Akroyd, Harold Ramis and Ivan Reitman had been extremely reluctant to work on a part 2 but enough pressure made them do it. That said, even though it did well all three of them wanted to work on other projects and that's why there was never a GHOSTBUSTERS 3 (though IMDB as something listed for a part 3 in preproduction but that doesn't mean much in Hollywood so we'll see).

CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; HUMOR: B to B plus; SPECIAL EFFECTS (dated): B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: March 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B plus.

BEST DIALOGUE (spoilers): Egon: I'd like to run some gynecological tests on the mother. Peter Venkman: Who wouldn't?  //// Egon: Vigo the Carpathian. Born 1505, died 1610. Peter Venkman: 105 years old, he hung in there, didn't he? Ray: He didn't die of old age, either. He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disembowled, drawn and quartered. Peter Venkman: Ouch. Winston: Guess he wasn't too popular at the end, huh? Egon: No, not exactly a man of the people. Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy. Peter Venkman: Wasn't he also Vigo the Butch? Ray: And dig this, there was a prophecy. Just before his head died, his last words were ""Death is but a door. Time is but a window. I'll be back.""  /// Peter Venkman: Hi, Egon. How's school? I bet those science chicks really dig that large cranium of yours, huh? Egon: I think they're more interested in my epididymis.  /// Louis Tully: Your Honor, ladies and gentleman of the audience, I don't think it's fair to call my clients frauds. Sure, the blackout was a big problem for everybody. I was trapped in an elevator for two hours and I had to make the whole time. But I don't blame them. Because one time, I turned into a dog and they helped me. Thank you. [the courtroom is in bewildered silence] Egon: Very good, Louis. Short, but pointless.  ////

Dana: Okay, but after dinner, don't put any of those old cheap moves on me. It's different now. Peter Venkman: Oh, no! I have all NEW cheap moves.  /// Ray: [of the insulting birthday party kids] Ungrateful little yuppie larva. After everything we did for this city. Winston: Yeah, we conjured up a hundred-foot marshmallow man, blew the top three floors off an uptown high-rise, and ended up getting sued by every city, county, and state agency in New York. Ray: Yeah... but what a ride.  //// Louis Tully: (reading a fairy tale to a little girl) So the 7 little dwarves had a limited partnership in a small mining operation. And one day a beautiful princess came to live with them. And they bartered housekeeping services for room and board, which was a real good deal for them because they didn't have to withhold social security or income tax or nothin', which you're really not supposed to do, you see, but for the purpose of the story, I think it's okay.

//// Dana: You're much better than you realize. You don't give yourself enough credit. Peter Venkman: I need to hear that kind of stuff. You know, if I had this kind of stuff for like on a 24-hour basis, I could have myself whipped into shape by the end of this century.  ///// [the ghost of the R.M.S. Titanic appears in New York Harbor, and numerous ghostly figures emerge from it] Dock Supervisor: Well, better late than never.  //// Ray: It looks like a giant Jell-O mold. Winston: I hate Jell-O. Peter Venkman: Oh, come on. There's always room for Jell-O!  //// Peter Venkman: Uh, perhaps you can help me? I'm looking for a love-potion aerosol, that I can spray on a certain Penthouse Pet, to obtain her total submission.  //// [Egon and Ray are showing Peter and Winston their breakthrough with a slime specimen] Egon: Go ahead, Ray! Ray: [shouting at the slime] You! You worthless piece of slime! You ignorant disgusting blob! [slime twitches] Egon: You're nothing but an unstable short-chained molecule! Ray: You foul obnoxious muck! [bubbles dangerously with every insult] Egon: You have a weak electrochemical bond! [starts to bubble over] Ray: I have seen some disgusting crud in my time, but you take the cake! Peter Venkman: This is what you do with your spare time?  ///// Dana: Hello, Peter. Peter Venkman: [whips around Melodramatically, and speaks in a soap opera-esque deep tone] Hello, Dana.

///Peter Venkman: So, what happened to Mr. Right? I heard he ditched you and went to Europe. Dana: He did not ditch me. We had some problems, and he got a very good offer from an orchestra in London and he took it. Peter Venkman: So he ditched you?  //// Peter Venkman: Dana, you just never got it. I'm a man, I need to feel loved. I need to be desired! Dana: When you started introducing me as the old ball and chain, that's when I left.  //// Judge Wexler: [two ghosts in electrics chairs are attacking the court room] The Scolari brothers!
Ray: Friends of yours? Judge Wexler: I tried them for murder, gave 'em the chair! You've got to do something! Egon: Why don't you just tell them you don't believe in ghosts?  ////Janine Melnitz: It is really a very nice place. Needs a woman's touch. Louis Tully: [closing the door to Oscar's room] Shh. Bed time. Janine Melnitz: You are so great with kids. Louis Tully: Oh, thanks, I practiced with my hamster. Janine Melnitz: [holding what it looks like a crystal ball in her hands] So, you live alone? Louis Tully: I used to have a roommate, but my mom moved to Florida. Janine Melnitz: Why don't you come here and sit with me. Louis Tully: Okay. [he moves to the couch Janine is sitting] Louis Tully: So, you want to play Boggle or Super Mario Bros.? Janine Melnitz: No. I think motherhood is a very natural instinct.  ////

Peter Venkman: [as the Mayor walks in] [Raising his voice over the rest of the 'Busters] Peter Venkman: Lenny. Big man. The Mayor: The Ghostbusters. Winston: Mr. Mayor? [Holds out his hand, wanting to shake his hand] The Mayor: What is this? A slumber party? Ray: Well, that's why we wanted to see you. The Mayor: Listen, *I* don't want to hear anything about it. You got 2 minutes. Make it good. Ray: [Getting started] Well, first of all Mr. Mayor, it's a great pleasure to see you again, and you'll be happy to know that 50% of us voted for you in the last election. The Mayor: I appreciate that. Peter Venkman: I'm sorry we have to meet under these circumstances. Ray: Mr. Mayor, we're here tonight because a psychomagnatheric slimeflow of immense proprtions is building up beneath the city. The Mayor: Psycho-what? Egon: Psychomagnatheric. Peter Venkman: Big word, big word. Egon: Negative human emotions that are forming into a vicious ectoplasm with *explosive* supernormal potential. The Mayor: Can somebody speak english here? Winston: Uh yeah. Your honor, what we're trying to say is all of the bad feelings. You know hate, anger and the vibes of the city are turning into this *sludge*. I didn't believe in it either. But, we just went for a swim in it and end up almost killing each other. Hardemeyer: [to the Mayor] [Aggrivated] Hardemeyer: This is insane! Do we *really* have to listen to this? Peter Venkman: [to Hardemeyer] Can't you stop your lips from flapping for 2 little minutes? [to the Mayor] Peter Venkman: Lenny, have you been out on the street lately, do you know weird it is out there? We've taken our own headcount, there seems to be 3 *million* completely miserable a***oles living in the Tri-State area. Hardemeyer: [In disbelief] Please? Peter Venkman: I beg your prdon, 3 million and *one*. Hardemeyer: Hey. Ray: And what *fuggy brain* here doesn't realize, that if we don't do something fast this whole place is gonna blow like a frog on a hot plate. Hardemeyer: [In disbelief] Yeah right. The Mayor: What do you want me to do, go on television and tell 3 million people they have to be *nice* to each other? [Begins to walk off] The Mayor: Being miserable and treating other people like dirt is every New Yorker's god-given right. Your 2 minutes are up, good night gentlemen.  ////

[at Dana's apartment, Louis and Janine watch on TV the movie ""The Lady from Shanghai""] Janine Melnitz: Is, like, she the killer or what? Louis Tully: No. That's Rita Hayworth.

776105,4,6304068522,"Not much can top the original Ghostbusters movie, at least for me.  That was the defining film of my childhood (I was 7 when it came out).  After I saw it, my list of career goals instantly took shape: (1) be a Ghostbuster.  I put in some serious practice time running around the house with a backpack and an umbrella or toy gun (makeshift proton pack) shooting at invisible ghosts.  I probably scared my parents quite a bit.  Although I failed to become a Ghostbuster, the film stays with me and is one of the most potent pick-me-ups in existence (just pop it in the player and under most normal circumstances, my mood gets better).

So when news of a second film came out a half-decade later, I was of course very excited.  By that time however I was also not 7 anymore, my career goals were somewhat more nuanced, and what I expected from a film also reflected a bit more personal development.  Plot, characters, all of this was a little bit more important now.  The second film delivered...sort of.  The same great characters were there but the plot seemed a bit more contrived and forced.  The ghosts didn't seem as threatening this time out and Bill Murray didn't seem as engaged in the whole thing.  I recall mild disappointment (although what can compete with a walking Statue of Liberty when you're 12?) and didn't see the film again for many years.

I recently bought a copy on DVD to see whether my 12-year-old critical judgment had any merit or whether I was just a jaded pre-teen given to quick dismissal of pop culture items that didn't measure up to expectations.  I found that I was both right and wrong.  As a 34-year-old I can say that the plot is very contrived.  It is meant to follow the format of the original from what I can tell (an hour-and-a-half-ish build-up to the confrontation with the big villian, while the Ghostbusters have to battle lesser ghosts as well as annoying Government bureaucrats who want to shut them down) since the original format ""worked"" and that is what audiences expect from a Ghostbusters movie.  It seems a little unrealistic that the Ghostbusters would be sued out of business after saving the city from an ancient evil deity who would have destroyed the world but hey, why not.  There has to be some explanation for the 5-year absence and a few obstacles to tackle before the big showdown.  The main villian (Vigo, the ancient...uh...evil tyrant) also isn't as legitimately menacing or well-established as Gozer (the terror dogs in the original were actually frightening and the chase-down of Louis was truly funny).  All that said, the courtroom scene is very funny (and closest to the real spirit of the original) and the slime concept is pretty cool.  The slime alone is enough to sustain the movie plot-wise and if it had been the main villian rather than Vigo that would actually have been better.

Which brings us to the characters.  Bill Murray, the leader-among-equals, seems at times to be dialing it in (as does Siguorney Weaver).  At other times, he does seem more engaged (as, also, does Siguorney Weaver).  The other Ghostbusters seem to act about the same as they did in the original, which is where a lot of the film's heart comes from (and why this isn't overall such a bad review).  There isn't enough Rick Moranis screentime but given his secondary role in the overall plot we do get a decent dose of his comic acting.  The same goes for Annie Potts (my childhood crush). It's nice to also see Slimer the ghost here, especially given his popularity from his significant role in the Ghostbusters animated TV series which followed the original movie.

It's ultimately the characters who make this movie for me.  These guys could be reading from the phone book and I would probably listen in.  Watching it in 2011 I felt that while this sequel might be lacking in some respects, overall it was the feel-good adventure movie it was meant to be.  It rightfully doesn't take itself too seriously, which is refreshing for anything related to the action genre (or action-comedy). Great cinema?  No, of course not. But it's definitely worth a watch for those who have a nostalgic streak for fun 80s adventure-comedies.",1309392000,18,4182,4.701923076923077

776108,5,6304068522,"Ghostbusters is a classic comedy film. I just got the blu-ray of that film recently and the picture, audio, and extras were all amazing on it. It is by far the definitive edition of the film period. Now there is Ghostbusters II. First of all it was an impressive followup to the original. Not as good but is a worth see. It was just as funny as the first film and the special effects were as good as the first film.

But there's something I'm not laughing about. The first movie is on Blu-Ray (yes indeed), but the sequel isn't? WHAT? Yeah everybody claims that the sequel is extremely underrated and some people claim that the sequel is inferior to the original. Some of the actors and filmmakers prefer to look at the original more than the sequel and I respect that. But the sequel was pure entertainment to me and Columbia should put this out on Blu-Ray soon with a great transfer, which the previous dvds have but no extras. The third movie is in production and should be out in a year or two and all the original, Ghostbusters and actors are coming back, with the exception of a couple, maybe. So is director Ivan Reitman. Maybe Columbia will put it out then. I'm not keeping my fingers crossed on that though

Also, another note to add: Columbia put out Men in Black in a great Blu-Ray release. Where the hell's the sequel to that movie on Blu-Ray? The third film in that series is currently in production. Maybe they'll put it out then.

That put, Ghostbusters II was a great followup to the classic original but a Blu-Ray release would give this movie the justice it deserves.",1280880000,,1585,4.458620689655173
776109,4,6304068522,"I seem to favor this *slightly* over the original. I think it's because I grew up with this one. I rarely saw the original when I was a kid, so childhood memories bring me back to the sequel. Not to say that this is better than the original (which it obviously isn't), I seem to care a bit more about this one. Anyway, the sequel is really, really good. Despite it being less urgent and less imaginative, you get to see the main characters again, and their dialogue is as sharp as ever. There is more horror and even more drama, and the special effects look more convincing this time around. True, it's not as wholly satisfying as the original, but it still holds up pretty well.

So why is it that most fans of Ghostbusters hate or never mention Ghostbusters 2. Whilst it was definitely inferior to the first Ghostbusters, you have to realise, that was a tough act to follow, though they definitely tried and did very well. Dan akyroyd and Harold Ramis speak enough technobabble to keep it interesting and Bill Murray is just as funny as ever. Plus moments like the river of slime and the walking Statue of Liberty were pretty epic. All in all, if you saw and didn't like it as a kid, give it another shot, you may like the second time around.",1278892800,,732,4.470149253731344

But, when an evil pink slime tries to take over New York City, the call goes out for the Ghostbusters!

This sequel was really a lot of fun.  Lots more music in this one.  Rap style, pop style, -- Bridge!  Hit IT!

Sigourney Weaver reprises her role as Dana, but she has a baby and Peter still tries to pick up on her.  The love story even extends to our little guy who was a dog in the last film -- he gets a piece too, but I digress.

Bill Murray, not as witty & quick with the jokes as he was the first film; still, a funny guy.  Baby Oscar stole the show.

The film moved a bit slow in parts, but parodied itself which is where most of the fun came from.

Also it was predictable, following the exact same pattern as the first film.

Best scenes:  Making the Statute of Liberty come to life and walk down the street with people cheering.  The sixteenth century evil ghost from Carpathia doing his thing.  And the quotes were silly, too:

""Being miserable and treating other people like dirt is every New Yorker's God given right!""

Slime covered museums and toddlers stir the mix.  The baby of the piece, Oscar (what, named after a hot dog?) was actually two babies in this picture, twins I think.

So if something's weird, and doesn't look good, we know who to call -- Ghostbusters!

We both really enjoyed the original and felt that it had more than held up over time, but we we were tremendously disappointed with the sequel.  This is a joint review of both films.  We watched the original film on Blu-ray and the second one on regular DVD.  I won't say much more about the format except to say that the quality of the Blu-ray was somewhat disappointing.  In fact, the quality of the DVD was very nearly as good as the Blu-ray.

Rewatching the first film, it was fascinating to see what a simple story it told, and how short it was.  There really is very little to the film apart from the simple story and a string of scenes the become a framework for a series of jokes.  The one thing that surprised me was that I don't find Bill Murray's jokes, many of which feel ad libbed, as funny as I did when I saw it when it first came out.  This is balanced by Harold Ramis and Dan Ackroyd being funnier than I remembered.  The special effects all look pretty good by today's standards, except for Slimer, who didn't much appeal to me when the film came out and still doesn't.  But the highpoint of the movie, then as now, is the Stay-Puft marshmallow man, which is definitely one of the greatest movie monsters ever.

I saw the sequel when it came out, but over the years found it odd that I couldn't remember anything about it.  I remembered that Sigourney Weaver's character had a baby, but that was the extent of it.  Rewatching the film it is easy to see why I couldn't remember anything about it:  it is simply not a very memorable film.  The pace and the rhythm are erratic and many of the jokes are simply unfunny.  The plot isn't very interesting and seems pretty formulaic, the formula being the first movie.  It was, in fact, almost a remake of the original with some names changed and situations altered.  Both my daughter and I were very unhappy with it and did not think it a very worthy sequel to the first film.

The original 1984 GHOSTBUSTERS still plays like a film that was the product of some imaginations in the grip of a real vision, while the sequel feels like a film made to cash in on the success of the former.  It isn't like they weren't trying, they simply weren't inspired.  GHOSTBUSTERS 2 just is not a worthy sequel of one of the more memorable light comedies of the eighties.  Speaking for the two of us, we definitely enjoyed the first movie, but wish we had passed on the second one.  I just hope that I remember the latter as poorly as I did the first time.",1258070400,,2756,4.337890625

Good film BUT NOT CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL.

Bill you can NOT beat his performance in both films as Venkman.

The DVD package.  Lack of anything special.  NO EXTRAS EXCEPT 2 EPISODES OF THE ANIMATED SHOW.  CHEAP.

Though there are punchlines that people might repeat such as the ""sometimes s**t happens"", it could've work better as a comedy like the original.

This if the first movie you should see on Halloween then the original and so forth.",1223510400,,728,4.6
776177,5,6304068522,"I was just a little kid when this came out in the theater. I was too young to see the original in theaters, but by the time of the sequel (five years later) I, with millions of other kids, was a complete fanatic. I waited with bated breath for this thing to come out back in the summer of 1989... I watched my taped-off-TV copy of the original ten times a day in preperation... etc.
I could never not like this second offering, but even at the age of six, I was somewhat confused at some of the elements in Ghostbusters 2. (I deep analyzed every detail then, even more than I'm about to do now..) Stylistically, the movie falls way short of the first. This is odd, because all the same people were involved, who made the first movie so unique. From director Ivan Reitman, all the way down to that guy who played the mayor. Even the concept for the second script had a great idea, that just seems somewhat mishandled in the production. This could have easily been on par with the original, but a few things make it lack. The music for instance is pretty cheesy. Theres this goopy generic piano stuff thats all over the place, like Reitman just picked up some rights for it on the cheap. The quirky score for the first is nowhere to be found.
The first twenty minutes of the movie waste way too much time trying to show how all the characters went their own seperate ways after the battle with Gozer in the first. These sideplots date the movie (mention of the world ending on new years 1989...feh..)and are pretty much useless to the overall story. Also to many shots are taken at the fact that in 1989, Ghostbusters had become such a huge franchise for kids. Like the line ""The proton pack is not a toy"". I had a toy proton pack. It was cool. The scene where Ray and Winston sing for a bunch of kids was somewhat pointless, and since its right at the beginning of the movie, the whole vibe is cheapened right off the bat. Also, whats with Winston shaving the mustache? He was such a bad ass in the first movie, and he's pretty goofy in this outing. Did he just not dig the mustache anymore? maybe,, but I think that Ivan Reitman wanted him to resemble the cartoon version more. And maybe to be a little less tough looking. For the kids.
Also, Annie Potts' Janine was made to look more like the cartoon version. Although, she must have taken some sexy pills, because she's way hotter this time around, and it works for her. The cartoon Janine was originally a cross between Annie Potts' original likeness and I think, Cyndi Lauper. Cartoon Janine was kinda trashy at first (japanese animation values) Around the third season, the cartoon changed her image completely, to the the big round glasses and the bright long red hair, making the cartoon Janine a lot more conservative looking. Annie Potts took this new cartoon likeness and floozed it up quite a bit. I crack up when she seduces Rick Moranis later in the film. Still, this is just another crack at the franchise itself, although one that worked well.
Anyway, I guess it doesn't really matter now. I still think that there should be a third one. The first Ghostbusters may easily be my favorite movie of all time, but the second one is just a somewhat ok attempt to keep the ball going... even though it never went any further. The first installment is timeless and will be enjoyed for generations to come, but this one may not live on past the memories of some us perpetually six year old fans from the summer of 1989.

776178,4,6304068522,"Ghostbusters II is both an insult to the original and to the audience sitting through it. The film has none of the charm that made the original work and the effects are ATROCIOUS. The music is absolutely lousy and the plot makes the original look like The Merchant of Venice.  First off, the characters are less serious in their intentions and more drawn from a comic strip. The success of the original and the cartoons series must have had a push in this. Rick Moranis is wasted from being a real person in the original (that might be a stretching description) to a poor sap delivering some of the worst one-liners in history. Harold Ramis is a parody of himself in the original, remember how humorless he was? Even Sigourney Weaver doesn't carry any sort of context with her character this time around.  A movie like this must mix the elements of comedy and horror effectively, Ghostbusters II doesn't. It tries too hard to be funny without letting situations build themselves up as in the first. Even Venkman's delivery is totally off.  Overall, a total waste. Just watch Ghostbusters again and don't even both with this one. The message in particular is both too pacifist like that year's The Abyss (a far superior film) and too simple for any audience outside of fourth grade.",1223078400,,1281,4.709821428571429

Very entertaining and underrated sequel! Sure it doesn't have any of the sheer brilliance or excellence that made the first movie a classic but this is still an exciting sequel with good laughs. The creature effects and special effects are done by Industrial Light and Magic, i think they are well done effects including on the Scareli Brothers sequence in the court. The acting is good and the storyline isn't too bad, the film offers a couple of appearences by Cheech Marin and Ben Stein and this is worth another look.

776180,3,6304068522,"The ""Real Ghostbusters"" DVD releases have been controversial among longtime fans of the show because they are not season boxed sets and contain only one or two of what are considered the best episodes of the series. Some fans have theorized that the best way to increase the likelihood of boxed set releases is to purchase the DVDs that are already out. What of the episodes themselves?

""Night Game"" is the best ""Real Ghostbusters"" episode currently available on Region 1 DVD.  It is a joy to behold as that great rarity:  an episode focused largely on Winston, the least-utilized Ghostbuster.  Especially praiseworthy is the scene in which a white security guard runs away from a supernatural situation in panic while Winston strides directly toward the problem.  The animation quality of this episode is also much better than usual for this series.  This episode's only real flaw is that it's a little too obvious that the Umpire creature is being voiced by the same actor as Egon (Maurice LaMarche).  But listen out for the Umpire's big monologue, possibly the most philosophically rich dialogue ever written for Saturday morning television.

""The Bird of Kildarby"" is a more ordinary episode, but an enjoyable one.  It provides the movie character of Mayor Lenny with one of his welcome animated appearances, and it's heartwarming to see Ray become no-nonsense and bossy in negotiating with the ghosts for Peter's release.

""Killerwatt"" and ""Lost and Foundry"" are both very good episodes, but their plots are so similar that they tend to blur together in the mind.  The decision on Sony's part to release them on the same DVD seems questionable, to say the least.  A noteworthy moment in ""Killerwatt"" is a scene in which Janine blows Egon a kiss and is then kissed by Slimer:  the same action occurs in the show's opening title sequence, and yet the animation is not identical to that in ""Killerwatt"".

""Creatures of the Night"" has the only good piece of cover art of the three ""Real Ghostbusters"" DVDs; on the other two the characters don't even look like themselves.  Overall ""Creatures of the Night"" is a better collection of episodes than ""Spooky Spirits"", but not quite as good as the third ""Real Ghostbusters"" DVD, ""Slimefighters"".",1190592000,,2242,4.957219251336898
776181,3,6304068522,"I don't like 'best of' DVDs because they never include all the best episodes and even if an episode is only average it should still be on DVD.

I only want the first 2 seasons of the Real Ghostbusters(RG) on DVD. During the first 2 the show had great plots, funny and witty dialogue, and great chemistry between the characters.  Everything worked. Then the show really did a 180 quality wise after season 2. The show lost Lorenzo Music (Venkman) and Arsenio Hall (Winston). Also the plots and dialogue were not up to the standards of the first 2 seasons. Last but certainly  not least Slimer became the star of the show.

In short after season 2 the RG became just the average Saturday morning kiddie cartoon show. In fact Filmation's Ghostbusters cartoon was actually much better than this show after season 2. That's how far this show slipped.

776265,4,6304068522,"I'm going to go against the crowd here and say that Ghostbusters 2 is a superior film to the original, and here's why:
  While it is true that the original GB was an original surprise hit, beating out Indiana Jones, Gremlins, and other big movies in the summer of 84, Bill Murray was coming off of Stripes and was playing the same smarmy guy he always played in the early 80s.  In GB 2, Murray is way more likable and he allows his great costars to have more fun moments, like the discovery of the river of slime, Rick Moranis gets to be the Ghostbusters' lawyer and ""suits up"" as an honorary Ghostbuster this time.  Anne Potts, Harold Ramis, Dan Akroyd, and Ernie Hudson ALL have better material and seem more interesting this time around.
  I like the way both Ghostbuster films make use of New York locations.  Ghosts and undead beings walking around New York is a fascinating sight that never gets old because the special effects are really top notch.
  This movie is just less cynical than the original.  In fact I love that the overriding message of the film is that people sort of created the river of slime by being so cynical and that New Yorkers could pull together and change that outlook.  That interesting theme gives this movie a heart that the original lacked I think.
  But all of that aside, I just think it is a funnier movie.  In the courtroom when the Ghostbusters put on their proton packs and sing ""Doe,"" Ray,"" ""Egon,"" and the look Harold Ramis flashes Murry is priceless.
  Anyway this is probably the best movie ever inspired by Saturday Night Live cast-members, at least in my book.  So give it another try.",1185926400,6,1632,4.515358361774744

776270,4,6304068522,"The Saturday morning animated follow up to the original Ghostbuster movie is here. Problem is there is no complete sets containing all of the '86-91 series, just random selects.

The ""Real Ghostbusters"" so called because FILMATION had the TV rights for the ""Ghostbusters"" name back from a live action-low budget Saturday morning show with Forest Tucker and Larry Scorch as bumbling ghost catchers, along with a guy in an ape suit. Filmation revised their concept after the unrelated Ivan Reitman film was a success, so there was briefly competing animated Ghostbuster cartoons. The REAL Ghostbusters succeeded inpart because it had all the recognizable props from the movie, the characters Ray, Egon, Winston and Peter Venkman. But chiefly, it boasted some of the best voice talent in TV animation: the great Maurice LaMarche(with loads of voice credits most recently working on the new FUTURAMA MOVIE for Dec of 2007) Arsenio Hall (so to be TV late night host), Frank Welker (of Scooby Doo fame as FRED) and Lorenzo Music, who is most famous as the voice of GARFIELD was ironicly replacing Bill Murray as Venkman, who would later serve as the new voice for the Cat in two feature films. The series also had some notable writers like Michael J. Straczynski of BABYLON 5 note.
Later after several seasons the series evolved into the SLIMER and the GHOSTBUSTERS show, featuring Slimers adventures before he meet the GBs.

This one features a bonus episode which happens to be the SECOND EPISODE for the cartoon series: Killerwatt. The animation is more polished on this one, more like the opening credits, all the way though. Later the time constraints would make future episodes less remarkable overall, except for Proton pack fights which tended to look glossy. Killerwatt is the story of a ghost who is possessing electrical appliances involving the boys in some dept. store battles and ultimately a big showdown with the power behind the possessions. Introducing the ECTO-2, a ghost-fightin' helicopter, the new bigger containment system and the multicolored GB uniforms (along with hair highlights for the crew, and a rat-tail for Spengler).

Also on this DVD Night Game (Field of Dreams meets Faust), the Bird of Kildarby (NYC castle haunting), Lost & Foundry.

Watch for ""Ghosts-R-US"" the series pilot, which starts with a shot at the cartoon ghostchasing rivalry by having some ghosts pretending to be ""ghostbusters"" in order to put the ""real"" ghostbusters out of business.

Which leads them to check out the sewers and I'm not sure if it's actually explained why. I guess because the baby carage took a mind of it's own with the baby in it on that street or something.

The judge gives them permission to get rid of them which of course leads to them being allowed to be Ghostbusters again. In mildly entertaining scenes it shows them catching ghosts again. They soon realize that the painting at Weaver's museum job might be the big problem basically...just because Peter (Bill Murray) thinks it looks evil.

The production values were as high as in the first film, and Victor Fleming once again provided capable direction.  There was only one problem:  the script was deeply flawed and far inferior to that of the previous film.

For those of us who remember the original ""Ghostbusters"" as an all-time classic from our childhoods, ""Ghostbusters 2"" is the precise equivalent of that hypothetical ""Oz"" sequel.  For an hour and forty minutes we get to see the characters from one of our favorite movies, played by the same actors, in another movie.  The only problem is that it isn't a *good* movie.  ""Ghostbusters 2"" is painfully derivative of its predecessor; it's far less well structured; and Randy Edelman's score can't hold a candle to Elmer Bernstein's for the first film.

Sadly that's not the case with this collection. You only get four episodes from the first season, and not in order. It's like that old VHS video release mentality again. You would figure a DVD can carry at least twice the amount of eps as VHS so why be stingy? There are over 70 episodes out there on season one alone. Still that's better than nothing I suppose. Don't expect any bonus features on this collection as the price point just doesn't scream ""special edition"" at all. Anyway here are the episodes that should be on this DVD according to my sources:

Night Game - Winston plays a game of ball with somebody's soul as the wager.

Lost and Foundry - When a ghost is merged with melted steel, strange things start happening all over town - including the firehouse.

Bird of Kildarby - The boys battle it out in a haunted Irish castle... in the middle of Manhatten.

Killerwatt - A spirit with a taste for electricity takes over a power plant.

Meanwhile, Venkman's old flame Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) has an infant son named Oscar, whose soul is wanted by the spirit of a centuries-old psychopath who inhabits a painting at the Museum of Modern Art (where Dana works). When the killer, Vigo, possesses Janosz, Dana's boss, and the Ghostbusters discover that the slime runs on bad feelings (and they live in New York, home of rudeness, har de har har) and is connected to Vigo, the Big Apple's going to get a bite taken out of it.

 Pardon my stupid comment about the apple, and listen up: this is one of the best sequels ever. It has the same things the original had going for it: the clever writing by Ramis & Aykroyd, the dry wit of Murray, the fine direction of Ivan Reitman (he of Stripes and Animal House), and the amazing special effects (tell me the courtroom sequence isn't at the same time hysterically funny and eye-poppingly cool). So when there's something's weird, and it don't look good, who you gonna call? Well, it sure aint FEMA...",1135382400,3,2135,4.7466307277628035

There's not much storyline to this film, and it does come across to start with that the Ghostbusters are no longer speaking to each other - at least that's the impression I got. The villian in this movie is not at all scary - Vigo, with the supremely evil eyes. I got a bit lost with the whole 'romance' bit between Bill & Sigourney Weaver's characters, as I don't really remember it that well from the first one. But girls be warned, if your boyfriend suddenly starts nodding along to when Bill Murray starts talking about positions in bed, and mentions that when they're ""spooning"" he gets her hair in his mouth. I think threatening to sleep on the couch should just about get him.

The green guy doesn't appear much in this either, apart from towards the end. I can't remember the name but he used to scare me as a kid! :) How embarrassing. Also, what is it with Ernie Hudson getting virtually no lines in this?! He disappears for chunks of the film at a time, and when he does appear in the film, he seems to be pushed back to allow others to display their larger than normal egos.

I have to say, I'm not sure which film I prefer best, although loving the theme tune forever! That's the great thing about Halloween, get to hear that over & over. (Along with ""Thriller"".) I think they really have to be watched back to back, as it's been so long since I've watched the first one, I don't remember a lot about it.",1130889600,4,1496,4.335714285714285

So this was the only Ghostbusters I got to watch a lot of.

Without Vigo, this movie wouldn't be anything.  Vigo's cool, but little else in the film is.  The river of slime is boring.  It's too bad that Vigo doesn't really show up until the end of the movie.

The movie moves SLOW at some parts, particularly the parts where Bill Murray tries to develop his relationship with Mrs. Weaver.

At least the statue of liberty walking was something new.  It was almost as good as the stay-puft marshmallow man.  The only real improvement that I see from the first film to this one is that the Ghostbusters secretary got a new hairstyle.  She's a babe in this one.",1120780800,2,940,4.184357541899441

In this whimsical, but often tedious, sequel, the ghostbusters are back, after being banned from ghostbusting!  Which makes no sense as everyone hailed them as heroes after the defeat of the Marshmallow Man!  But for plot purposes, that's what they decided to move this movie.  Although the original cast and director are back, they don't seem as inspired or ""in to it"" like they did in the first.  Bill Murray and Sigourney Weaver seem to be going through the motions; Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis are pretty much what they were in the first; and Rick Moranis & Annie Potts, who were so much fun in the original, don't seem to be a part of the story as much in this one.  Peter MacNicol as the crazed museum curator is excellent in his role, and we get some fun support from Harris Yulin as the Judge and Janet Margolin as the prosecuting attorney.

The effects this time are fairly similar to the original, but the use of the Statue of Liberty in the climax is a little too far-fetched even for this kind of film.  We also don't know how they get her back in the harbor after the cataclysmic ending.

The plot of the second movie involves the ""bad feelings"" of New York city, somehow coalescing into a pink goo (dubbed ""mood slime"") which in turn feeds energy to Vigo, the evil wizard who is the main bad guy.

The Ghostbusters use a variety of new equipment to beat Vigo, and the special effects are first-rate throughout. The coutroom scene with the spectral Scoleri Brothers is especially good.

Ghostbusters II has many funny moments, with tons of quotable lines (just like the original). And while an appearance by the Statue of Liberty falls flat, there is still enough good stuff here to make for an enjoyable experience.

Comparing this film to the first one is stupid, b/c the first one was a totally gothic film and this one is simply a different movie with some of the same elements (concepts of the supernatural, characters).  Sometimes, now that I'm older and quite a bit more jaded, I find myself bored out of my mind by the long-winded first half hour or so.  But when I was 5 and the dullness of reality hadn't been forced upon me (when I started school, I had to learn & study math and needed to tone down my zeeal and sit down and concentrate on ""real"" stuff and life kinda went downhill from there...), I found myself at times scared by this film (the music at times was TERRIFYING!) and at other times wishing I knew the lyrics to that song the people outside the museum were singing at the end so I could sing with them!  The ""good vs. evil"" story still appeals to me even today and the memories I have of this film and all it had to offer (including toys that had bright and colorful packaging!, which probably would have been stopped if this film hadn't come out and rekindled the passion many people felt for the Ghostbusters ""franchise"") are worth more $$$ than all the profit this film & its predecessor made!  I can't say this for a fact, but I think many people don't know (and/or don't remember clearly enough if at all) how to watch a movie without focusing on logic, but, rather, letting your senses do the talking!

776420,3,6304068522,"A lot of the original magic is absent in this belated sequel. The storyline isn't up to much and is never taken full advantage of. One thing that is sorely missed is the wide, powerful score from the first film. The late Elmer Bernstein ducked out of scoring this one and (the awful) Randy Edelman took over. This could have been alright if he respected Bernstein's work but he used none of the themes from the original. It's all just light-hearted cues and dullness.

The plot takes a backseat to long character explanation and development. The Ghostbusters have been out of business since blowing up Central Park West. Which is total crap! The saved the world from the destruction of Gozer. Why the hell would they go out of business? A totally ridiculous story that does nothing but aggravate fans of the first. Who on earth thought of this?

Now the Ghostbusters are forbidden from performing public services. But a narrow-minded Judge wants to send them to jail for causing a massive blackout. Then, 2 ghosts show up and they bust them and before you can say 'Who ya gonna call?' they are back busting undead ass.

Something I find very stupid and annoying about the plot is that the aforementioned Judge and a City Attorney repeatedly say that they do not believe in ghosts. Obviously these guys have forgotten about the 200-foot marshmallow man and the evil voice of Gozer booming all over Manhattan Island.

And this time the villain isn't as scary as the Gozer. Now we have Vigo, a 14th century madman who wants to return to living form and has targeted Weaver's child as his host. He plans to do this before the stroke of midnight on New Years Eve 1989 or some baloney. For a film that has it's build-up and climax on New Year's Eve there is no mention Xmas whatsoever. And the ending with the hidden painting is REALLY corny.

Bill Murray was very open about his distaste for this film when it came out. He said it was pointless and he never really wanted to do it. The Ghostbusters franchise was taken in a much stronger direction with The Real Ghostbusters TV show. At least with that they never went out of business for saving the world. Honestly, what stupidity!

However, it was thanks to the TV show that this movie was toned down a bit and more family-friendly. But the TV show and the first movie have something this film doesn't; atmosphere.

A scoop of trivia: In the montage with the Ghostbusters running all over New York after suddenly coming back into Business we see a clip of Ray driving like a maniac and Peter gives him a strange look. This scene was originally going to follow after the scene in which Ray is hypnotised by the painting of Vigo. The Ectomobile was supposed to crash into a tree in Central Park and we see a shot of the license plate fall off and Ray come out of his trance. But this entire scene was cut from the film and is only left in the montage.

Ghostbusters 2 is to Ghostbusters what MIIB was to MIB. A total repeat. Which makes the out-of-business/back-in-business plot even more retarded as we have to go through the establishments all over again instead of devoting that time to a stronger, better plot.

The Painting was truely a scary ghost, and in some ways may have been one of the biggest problems with this movie. As for the actor's, it seemed like the jokes just didn't work. Probably if your looking for a true movie comedy, go with the first Ghostbusters. This movie wasn't very funny, and was semi-scary drama.  Let me now review this dvd in detail: Movie charctors: I could see that Bill didn't really have a feel for this movie. Most actor's in this movie do decently, but not as well as the first movie. The support cast also wasn't very good this time round. One of the biggest problems with the movie charctors was the lack of humor. . . . . .80% Movie Plot: The plot basicly was put around the Slime and the painting. Basicly The slime now has feelings and is effected by how people in New York feel, and theres a ton of it in the sewers. The Painting is a self-portrait of a known Murder that died in a very bad way. Anyways The painting's ghost needs a host to walking again in human form. And of coarse Dana and Peter's baby he wants. Go figure. You think this ghost would have known better. lol anyway. . . .85% Movie effects: The effects where very interesting. The Art department sure gave the movie some very interesting ghosts. However Some things didn't quite work. The Statue of Liberty was way off the size of the real one.

776468,4,6304068522,"The story starts off on a bummer note.  The ingrates of the Big Apple sued Ghostbusters for saving the day in the first movie, result of which they went bankrupt.  Secondly, Peter Venkman and Dana Barrett did not get back together, having parted on bad terms.  Rather, Dana got married and divorced to someone, but not after having a child, Oscar.
However, when an invisible force hijacks Oscar's pram, sending it on a merry whirl on First Avenue, Dana looks up Egon, now working at the Institute for Advanced Theoretical Research.
Dana is also working at a museum restoring paintings.  However, prominent among the paintings is a large portrait of Vigo von Homburg Deutschendorf, a 16th Carpathian nobleman with a very nasty leer.
Upon investigating with those familiar instruments, the ex-Ghostbusters detect something under First Avenue.  The scene where they imitate some rough-talking workers is funny.
There are some interesting concepts introduced in this sequel.  One is the river of slime discovered by Ray, which is a great effects sequence.  Egon finds out that the slime is a psychoactive substance reacting to human emotions.  Their experiments on this with a toaster is a highlight, which reminds me, I gotta add some Jackie Wilson to my collection soon.  Anyway, this leads into the whole message of this movie, how mean people became, even back in the 80's.  Ray says ""I can't believe how things have gotten so bad in this city there's no way back.  Sure, it's dirty, it's crowded, it's noisy, it's polluted, and there's people all around who'd just as soon step on your face than look at you, but c'mon!  There's gotta be a few specks of sweet humanity left in this burned out burg!""  The idea of psychokinetic energy generating a high emotional force that could call down demons is nothing new, as in the case of black magic, but that's one of the reasons used to explain the presence of ravaging demons in hentai anime, feeding on bad vibes.  The mayor at one point says, ""What am I supposed to do, go on television and tell ten million people they have to be nice to each other?  Treating other people like dirt is every New Yorker's right.""
Lewis Talbot (Rick Moranis) is back, helping the GB's out, even in babysitting.  ""I'm very good with children.  I practiced with my hamster,"" he says.  He's got a better deal in this go-around--he scores, so that gives me hope.
Ditto Janine (Annie Potts), who has a somewhat reduced role in this movie.  However, the only downer in this movie is Peter MacNicol who as Janosz Poha, Dana's Hungarian colleague at the museum, has one of the most annoying voices, call it a very bad imitation of a Hungarian Doctor Strangelove.
Seeing some familiar things, like the Ghostmobile with the ECTO-1 license plate, the proton-backpacks, the steaming traps, lots of slime, and even a bureaucrat who makes life difficult them, is welcome.  The usual one-liners by Bill Murray are there--""I'm a voter.  Aren't you supposed to lie to me and kiss my butt?"" he says to Jack Hardemeyer, the mayor's assistant, but I also found Harold Ramis kind of lightening up in this movie.  While some ghosts do come out of this movie, it's an equal amount ghostbusting and exorcising as well.
So, as a sequel, is it better than expected, and something I wished I'd seen at the box office when it first came out?  To quote Egon, ""is the atomic weight of cobalt 58.9""?",1061856000,2,3399,4.762798634812286

776471,3,6304068522,"Ghostbusters was such a uniquely entertaining and hilarious film that nearly any sequel would be doomed to fall short of the lofty expectations ladled upon it.  Unfortunately, Ghostbusters 2 does indeed fall short, and far more so than one would have expected from such a great comedic team.
First, the story: a few years after the Ghostbusters saved New York from the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man, the guys are banned from practicing ghostbusting--yet soon their talents will be required again as a new painting at the museum where Dana Barret (Sigorney Weaver) works is posessed by the Dracula-like spirit of its likeness, Vigo.
My first problem has to do with the implausibility of these events.  Why would the Ghostbusters, after obviously having saved the city, be banned from ghostbusting?  And why does Dana have a kid--not Peter's?  I let that pass, though.
From there, it seems the painting has a rather unnatural attraction to Dana's young baby, though whom it believes it can be reborn.  Peter MacNichol as the geeky museum curator does deliver a hilarious performance as he falls under both Dana's and the painting's spell.
The Ghostbusters return to duty when they find a strange psychoactive slime flowing through tunnels beneath the city, a slime that causes negative emotions on contact--but which reacts positively to ""Your Love Lifts Me Higher,"" animating a toaster to dance (and eventually the Statue of Liberty).
Needless to say, the Ghostbusters save the day.  Yet he film lacks many of the elements that made the original so unique.  The dialog and situations, though funny, aren't so dead-pan and lack the timing that created the chemistry of the first film.  Nor does the villian seem quite so menacing as a giant marshmallow man.
The movie does provide a number of laughs, but there's a reason you see it far more often on cable than the original: the licensors know very well which one is the superior and thus charge more for the rights.  The film is in and of itself decent as the product of the Murray-Akryod-Ramis team--it just couldn't live up to the original.",1047686400,13,2088,4.942857142857143

Maybe that's why when I picked up the remastered edition I felt slightly let down that the actual movie wasn't as good as I remembered it. Vigo is still creepy, but once he steps out of the painting, he's just an old man in a costume. Even worse, in a rather anti-climatic ending, Vigo is easily beaten. So Ghostbusters II is diminished in that it fails to live up to the high nostalogic expectations I had of it.
But that's not the only thing though, Ghostbusters II feels...watered down compared to the original. Yes, the plot was exactly the same, but that wasn't really the problem for me. Maybe it's because the original movie spawned a huge cartoon series, and Columbia felt that it had to cater to the kiddies, and a lot of the adult-oriented jokes were removed (also, Jenine's hair is now red, as it was in the series). The problem may lie with Dan Aykroyd. He was the heart of the original movie, and the way he played Ray with a snappy, serious attitude made for some of the most memorable moments. Here, after Venkman grabs Ray's ears and forces him to reveal their new client, Aykroyd loses his spark. He gets possessed by Vigo, he's the one who has to venture down to get the slime, he's the one who has to give the speech about goodwill towards the end. It's a weaker, kiddier Ray, like in the cartoon, and here it weakens the film.
However, I still enjoyed Ghostbusters II a great deal. The special effects are amazing, considering that they were made in 1989 before CGI. The ghosts look convincing, and the Statue of Liberty scene, though obviously bluescreened, is excellently composited. There are a lot of funny gags, including scenes from the montage, the river of slime, the abandoned underground railroad, and the courtroom battle. Plus, it's just great fun to see the entire team reunited, they really play off each other very well. It's hard these days to find so many comedians together in one film. The DVD itself is a very nice edition. It's not a special edition, but for its relatively low price it's a definite purchase. The picture and sound quality are great. For a scene that you can use to demo your sound system, check out the courtoom scene. The rear speakers pick up the drafts and echos of the room, and the ghosts pan from speaker to speaker as the guys blast 'em. Also of note is that the film comes in three different audio languages and a bunch of subtitles, particularly in Asian languages. I'm Asian, so it's nice to see Mandarin subtitles, even though I can't read it that well. How does this apply to you? It might not, but if nothing else, I at least give Columbia points for the variety of languages one can enjoy the film in.

776531,5,6304068522,"A great follower of the original movie. It was almost guranteed a sucess because the original cast remained...and that meant more humour and more savin the day in style.
An evil painting of a carpathian sits in the Art Museum, while down below in the deepest tunnels evil slime runs through the heart of New York and radiates evil on the city. The Ghostbusters are once again fighting against the evil spirits that haunt the city.
We have a killer cast again including:
Bill Murray as the great Peter Venkman - who can't help but make humor out of situations, though he remains the most confrontational when it comes to battling ghosts.
Harold Ramis as the ever so intellegent Egon - his smooth, in the know character creates constant humour throughout, while his intellegence makes him the Brains of Ghostbusters.
Dan Aykroyd as the Ray. He is often either challenged by spooks or brings across child like characteristics (remember how he reacted when they first looked at the ghostbusters headquarters).
I could go on but I think you get the drift.
Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters 2 is pure genius - from the script to the the casting. We have a great cast of comedic actors - Murray, Ramis and Aykroyd and the script written by Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd contains the right level of humour and scares.

776532,3,6304068522,"Let me start off by saying that I am a HUGE fan of the original ""Ghostbusters"".  The original movie was funny, smart, and an all around good movie.
The sequel on the other hand, is a merely a good movie.  If the first movie never existed, then I would probably like this movie more.  As it stands, this movie lacks the sense of wonder the first film had, and also is missing a lot of the heart.
While watching this, you could tell that Dan Aykroyd had a lot more input in this movie than he did in the first one.  There aren't as many jokes, and the overall tone of the movie is very dark.  Granted, the courtroom scene is very funny, but the rest is severly lacking in comedy.
On a positive note, the FX are amazing, and look much better than the first movies FX.  The performances by the actors and actresses are for the most part pretty good.
The sound FX are about the same as the first movie, which is a good thing.  The music on the other hand, in a word, stinks.  I loved the first movie's sound track, and this one seems to stray very far from it.  The movie is filled with ""pop"" tracks that are very annoying, and simply don't fit the movie.
I'm assuming that most of you already know what the plot is, but if you don't than read one of the other fifty reviews.  My major beef with the plot is that it is too similar to the first's.  In both movies, an evil being comes through means of Dana Barret, and only the Ghostbusters can stop it.  The thing that bothers me the most about this movie is the fact that not a single person remembers what the boys in gray did in the first movie.  Nobody believes in ghosts, yet five years ago, a 100ft marshmellow man storming through manhatten.  Whatever.
Overall, this movie is a good movie on it's own, but pales in comparison to the original.",1013644800,,1794,4.207602339181286
776533,3,6304068522,"When I first saw this film back in the summer of 1989, I remember being somewhat disappointed. I enjoyed the film, but I wasn't as excited with it as I was with the first. I didn't think very much of the film from then on. But now, after catching this film recently for the first time in years and years, I enjoyed it a lot more and thought it was a better movie than I had originally thought. Not great, but not bad. The film picks up 5 years after the original, and we find that our beloved heroes haven't had the best of luck since their big victory a few years prior. But when Dana Barrett(Sigourney Weaver)has a ghostly accident involving her little baby, the guys are brought in on the subject and the Ghostbusters are back in action. It appears that a evil spirit in a painting wants Sigourney's baby in order to reborn again. Nothing really new there. There's also a river of slime flowing through the city that feeds off of the ""bad vibes"" of the people in New York City. Okay. The effects are pretty solid, but might not seem quite so to people who have been fed such incredible effects in movies in the last few years. Our actors are all back and are all as entertaining, charming, and funny as they were in the classic original. But, I don't know, there's just something that isn't right. I can't quite put my finger on it. The original film was a special, monumental film. I guess anything that follows up will always seem weak to comparison. At least Rick Moranis returns for some comedic relief. Ghostbusters 2 isn't as memorable or special as the first, but it's very entertaining and is better than most sequels.

The special effects, if anything, seem less spectacular than it's prequel, which came out 5 years earlier, and the plot is unexciting, confusing and drags on.  The culmination of this stupidity reaches its climax when citizens of New York City sing together to diminish the malevolent energy responsible for the ominous protoplasmic formations which are enveloping the city! Judas Priest, how stupid is THAT?! It also seems that the only action in the movie is at the very end and it's cheesy, at best.

776631,5,6304068522,"I'm really shocked that so many people have bashed Ghostbusters 2. The sequel to one of the best movies ever. I just don't understand why.
Ghostbusters 2 is far better than it's predesscessor. There are many different kinds of sub-plots that are great and work very well together. We have the plot of Vigo The Carpathian trying to dominate the Earth and trying to be re-born in the World by possessing little Baby Oscar, we have the sub-plot of Peter Venkman being Dana Barrett's Girlfriend, the sub-plot of the guys trying to get a good reputation, the sub-plot of the Slime River flowing underneath New York City feeding off the negative energy of the City. All those sub-plots and their mixed together flawlessly.
Although the main plot is basically just a rehash of Ghostbusters 1, it's still great and original. An incredibly evil Tyrant named Vigo lives inside a Museum Painting and tries to dominate the Earth using a River of Slime flowing beneath New York City that absorbs all the negative energy of the City. He also tries to be re-born by possessing Baby Oscar. It's up to the Ghostbusters to stop him and once again save the world.
The performances are also worthy of an Oscar. Murray once again steals the show as Peter Venkman, the other Busters are very well developed, and the rest of the actors are great. Peter MacNichol gives a superb performance as Janosz Poha and Wilhelm Von Homburg makes his Vigo character a million-dimensional villain.
The music is also fantastic, and you better believe me when I say that it's some of the best music ever created. It changes from being Romantic (Peter dating Dana), frightening (the Slime River flowing beneath NYC generating evil Monsters) and being incredibly heroic (the 4 Ghostbusters saving the day from the Scoleri Brothers in the Court Room battle scene). So much great music and it works quite well with the movie.
The special F/X are also some of the best ever put on film. Vigo's transformation into a nasty Demon towards the ending, the battle in the Court Room between the Ghostbusters and the Scoleri Brothers, and the Statue Of Liberity walking through NYC. Wow! How come the F/X didn't win any awards?
And the Ghostbusting scenes are great. As I said earlier, the battle in the Court Room is a special F/X cyclone and is really incredible. The confrontation between Vigo and the 4 GBs at the end is superb. And Lady Liberity strolling through NYC is awesome!
Reitman's direction is still good and gives GB 2 a very special and hard-worked feel to it.
All in all, Ghostbusters 2 is an excellent film that shouldn't be missed by anyone. Give it a chance and don't listen to those lame-brained Critics and Reviewers who panned this film years ago and still do it Today. Their all clearly insane (then again, who listens to critics, anyway?).
The DVD is also decent. The menus look very cool, the picture is very clear, the sound excellent, and it's cool to view GB 2 in both Widescreen and Fullscreen formats. The extras could've been much better though. All there is are a few Theatrical Trailers, Scene Selection, Production Notes, Biographies of the Cast and Crew, and that's pretty much it. Still, buy it anyway.

776633,5,6304068522,"Ghostbusters II (1989)
Ghostbusters II is an excellent follow-up to the 1984 classic, Ghostbusters. Although many people over the years have found  it to be too flawed to be on par with the original,in my opinion, it ranks  with the original and is almost done as well.
Story: The four  Ghostbusters from the first film are out of business after destroying the  giant Marshmallow Man from the first film. His defeat caused millions of  dollars in damage to the city of New York,causing the Ghostbusters to get  sued big time. They have normal jobs,but soon get back in the  business.
They get back in business after they discover a River of Slime  flowing beneath New York City that absorbs all of the negative energy from  the city,such as hatred,anger,and greed. They used illegal drilling to get  through underground,and are in court. However,two Ghosts throw a riot in  the courtroom. The Ghostbusters  manage to defeat them using their infamous  ""Proton Packs"" and ""Ghost Traps"",and their in town  again.
They soon learn that a painting in the musuem contains an  evil  100-year old Tyrant named Vigo,who plans to rule the World on New Years Eve  using the Slime flowing beneath NYC.
Ghostbusters II is a HIGHLY  entertaining sequel that NEVER EVER gets boring. I'm honestly really amazed  at how so many people think it's weak compared to the original  Ghostbusters. I found it to be just as entertaining,funny and scary as  Ghostbusters.
It is a little flawed. The script could use some stronger  energy (like why was Ray's encounter with the Slime Creatures in the Slime  infested sewer the first time around never  explained,and the same  applies to how Vigo got into the painting and where it came from) and the  loveable song from the first film only plays at the beginning and end for a  very short time. Still,Ghostbusters II is a classic film that is very much  on par with Ghostbusters in my honest opinion.
The special effects are  absolutely spectacular,Murray's character  still has excellent quotes and  one-liners,the new ""Slime  Blower"" weapons Ray Stantz &  Winston Zeddemore use are awesome, and the finale is absolutely  superb.

There are only four things that make the Ghostbusters movies  the masterpieces that they are: The Concept, the Characters/actors, the  Special FX, and the humor.

Yes the movie takes itself even less seriously, but the chemistry between these guys is just too good to instantly write off. The classic Elmer Bernstein score is traded in for a delightfully refreshing source music soundtrack filled with, what was then, contemporary hip-hop that gives the movie some extra bounce.

Despite the pretty obvious overt commentary about what was happening in New York City at the time, nothing was taken away from the story, which itself was a pretty classic Ghostbusters plot. The movie was reportedly modeled to be more like the animated cartoon series ""The Real Ghostbusters"" after it became such a hit with the kids, rather than it's predecessor, after all 5 years is a pretty long time for a sequel.
