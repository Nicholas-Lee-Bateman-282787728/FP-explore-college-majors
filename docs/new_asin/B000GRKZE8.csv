8455544,4,B000GRKZE8,"This DVD is absolutely mind-numbing for me, but my 18 month old LOVES it. He's a fan of anything Auburn and will watch it for hours. It consists of little kids wearing and playing with lots of (licensed) Auburn paraphernalia alternating with shots of various ballgames (football, soccer, basketball, baseball).  There's also plenty of cheerleader footage.  It is of good quality and it attempts to teach a few useful concepts: numbers, alphabet (how to spell Aubie), and colors (orange and blue only). The background music is low-key so it only gets loud when they feature the marching band. All in all, a good choice if you have a serious Auburn fan in the under 2 age range.",1207526400,,676,4.769230769230769
