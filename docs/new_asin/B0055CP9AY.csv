4573674,5,B0055CP9AY,"Having purchased ""Naked Beneath the Water"" by writer/director Sean Cain, I was anxious to see his next released film. Gotta say I wasn't disappointed! Mr. Cain seems to have an innate ability to tell a story, along with all the horror features! All-in-all, another great production from Velvet Hammer Films and Sean Cain! Looking forward to the release of his next film as I will add that to my horror collection!!!",1324425600,2,415,4.859154929577465
4573675,4,B0055CP9AY,"This movie has it all -- comedy, drama and zombies. What else do you need? OK, so it doesn't have midgets, but that's a common complaint I have with most films. I'm giving it four stars and reserving my five-star review for a hopefully zombie-midget packed sequel!",1324339200,6,264,4.638297872340425
4573676,2,B0055CP9AY,"Not what I had hoped for: so little zombie mayhem, far too much melodrama.  Most of the movie deals with the relationship/triangle of three people: two police officers, and a wife they both love (while the rest of the world goes to pot).  Somehow, I can't quite believe survival would be put on hold so that three people could endlessly yap about their dysfunctional friendships.  I expect zombies in a zombie movie, not a handful of folks hiding in a house as they discuss a failed marriage and a partnership about to be dissolved.  It also didn't help that the lead character Frank (Jack Forcinito) is thoroughly repugnant and difficult to watch.  No wonder his wife and his partner want to leave him, the guy is a creep.
The tone of this movie was totally from a soap opera standpoint, with a few zombies tossed into the background.  If it was meant to be funny, it failed, if it was meant to be horrific.............well, define horrific, it was pretty abysmal.
Not a keeper.  I'm almost sorry I bothered watching it in the first place.  I'm certainly sorry I wasted money on a frustrating viewing of a subpar movie.
Well, the Santa zombie was worth a chuckle.",1323993600,21,1164,4.616504854368932

4573689,1,B0055CP9AY,"How dare give this title to this piece of crap. There was one zombie in a Santa suit and one set of Christmas lights.

You know why they LIED about the title? Because if you call it the ""Oprah Oxygen Network talk about your insane feeling for extended inappropriate times while zombies at nipping at you leg"" movie, no one will watch it.

Out of 1 1/2 hours, I think there was 82 hours of talking, cheating, double cross cheating, divorce gone bad, emotional sharing, bromance crap.

Then there's the insanity. A cop that shoots at zombies 10 feet away, shoots 8 times and hit ""nothing but net"", just swishes through the air, no zombies. They pump 20 shells into this one zombie and always miss his head. A guy is backing up an attic ladder and a zombie is below him, so maybe 4 feet away. He can't hit him once with 5 rounds? They meet a guy in an attic covering up his dead baby and they're fine with him. A group of survivalists come to rescue them, she gets in a fight, gets naked to prove she has no bite marks and the cop handcuffs on the toilet, hand out the zombie ridden window, to make sure she's clean. Guess what - they try to nibble on her.

By the end, you are so rooting for the zombies to kill these non-stop talking emotion sharing ""men"".

If I could, I'd give -10 stars.

If you dare to make a piece of crap like this, give it an honest titlle: ""The worthless emotionally twisted feminine cops that can't shoot, but share their feelings and bromance."" Oh, that's right, that would never EVER sell. So you lie. I think they added a scene or two with Christmas stuff just to try and salvage this piece of crap.

How dare you.",1450569600,,1641,4.257234726688103

You think it's gonna be about a zombie Christmas, but other than a Christmas tree in the background, one zombie Santa and a 30 second exchange of gifts, that's all there is to do with Christmas.

I'm a fan of many a low-budget movie. The budget was not the problem here at all. Unlikable characters, poor script, lack of anything really relating to Christmas, sub-par acting (which I CAN live with in a decently scripted movie), all of these make this a movie to be ignored. This is a movie very reminiscent of ""Autumn"" (mostly people talking and arguing with a few action sequences tossed-in) except set in LA.

It's extremely talky in scenes that have nothing to do with the plot.  (A scene in which two people play a drinking game is cute, but goes one FOREVER.)  The title is misleading.  Even though it does take place at Christmas time, it's Christmas in Los Angeles, so it feels like any other time of year.

4573732,2,B0055CP9AY,"With the title alone, Silent Night Zombie Night could have been a contender for cult status.  Unfortunately, the film takes itself way too seriously.  The beginning takes off like the proverbial rocket with excellent quick cutting opening scenes.  The zombies are respectable (make up done well) and the gore effects are very believable.  Then suddenly, the film jars you to a near-slow motion stop with a mediocre storyline about a romantic triangle (???) that definitely isosceles'es the zombies leaving them with the short side of the story.  By the way, the cover is misleading as the wife never handles a single weapon (save a club in the beginning) for the whole film and obviously serves no purpose other than token prize to be protected.  This could've been an awesome Christmas movie (zombie elves, zombified reindeer, hell even a zombie Santa), but the motif is barely explored with the one lone Santa that shambles across the screen.  There was even an opportunity to exploit an original idea:  I don't recall the alpha zombie idea ever being used.  This could've really become something but instead again, the asinine romantic angle had to play out instead.  The climax is not exactly what you'd call edge of your seat worthy, and though the film leaves itself open for a sequel, this writer could almost care less whether or not the survivors make it to where they are going, much less to the end of their street.",1361059200,,1426,4.855371900826446

Who are these people and what is the relationship?  Never really addressed.  Hardly any humor in this.  Too little Christmas references.  Did they forget this was a Christmas theme?  It does get a little better in the second half, but the end disappoints too.  In summary: storyline horrible, dialog bad, acting fair, cinematography fair.  Don't waste your money on this.

4573740,3,B0055CP9AY,"A week before Christmas, a viral outbreak turns the citizens of Los Angeles into flesh-eaters. On the brink of severing ties with both his wife and his longtime partner, an L.A.P.D. officer instead winds up trapped with them as death closes in. That's the plot to Sean Cain's Silent Night, Zombie Night.

Robin Pierce of Gorezone Magazine saying that Sean Cain has outromeroed George Romero with Silent Night, Zombie Night--I don't think so. Why? Well- there's very little zombie chaos. It centers more on the drama of a love triangle(two policemen & the wife they both love) than it does on what's going on around them. Not only that but, other than the fact it takes place during the holiday season and Santa appears as a walker, it really makes no sense to call this movie what it is called.

Course, if you can get past all the B.S. and whatnot, it was an ok & decent watch. However, like Devil's Playground, I can only recommend a rental, at best. Buying this is such a complete waste. However, if you can find it in a bargain bin somewhere for a five-spot, maybe....but I'd give it a look beforehand and then base my decision on that.",1347321600,2,1140,4.556097560975609

4573745,3,B0055CP9AY,"Not a literal see-saw of course: a figurative one.  This movie challenged my willingness to accept almost anything simply because it's a zombie movie.  Therein lies the ""see-saw"": it was a bad movie, it was a good movie, then a bad movie, then a good, then...and so forth.  I started out thinking ok, the acting really is bad; but it got better, and better, until by the end it was quite good.  And the two main characters fit right in with the good movie-bad movie paradigm - they were cops, and literally one seemed like a good cop, the other like a bad cop.  Unfortunately - especially for them - they ended their assignment being a couple of jerks whose bravado nearly got them killed.  In fact, the absolutely absurd macho excess at the end was exactly what proved the undoing of the male heroes of ""Doghouse"" (another offbeat but thoroughly engaging zombie movie).

Not to fault the zombies for any of this, though.  They did everything expected of zombies - with one interesting twist: there were two kinds, one the passive zombies who spend most of their time walking aimlessly about; the other attack zombies who spent all of their time stalking normal humans and even planning strategies of attack.  There was even a virtual first for a zombie movie: a poignant character, who took a moment from trying to survive to lament the unfairness of the zombie assault.  His son had been bitten and, instead of trying to deny the boy's growing zombification, had shot him to keep him from becoming a zombie himself.

Through it all, the heroine - the bad cop's wife, who also loved the good cop, who loved her back, which affected their primary focus - remained closer than anyone else to the central theme.  So much so, in fact, that at the end when given the grisly task of undoing the inevitable result of the cops' using up all their bullets to have fun with the attack zombie instead of killing him outright, she was up to the task.  Score one for feminism.

8457982,3,B0055CP9AY,"This is an alright zombie film in a made-for-TV way, but it doesn't live up to the premise of it's title, that it's a Christmas zombie flick. to be that, it would have had to work in a lot more Christmas decor, atmosphere and spirit into the proceedings, which it doesn't even attempt to do. Most of this was probably due to budgetary constraints. It should have been set in Connecticut or somewhere with snow but instead is set in L.A. where it;'s usually 70 degrees on Christmas Day. Snow costs too much. The Christmas decor is minimal and there's no attempt to play appropriately inappropriate Christmas music, which could have been fun. But it costs a lot to license songs for films. There's one zombie Santa, and that's about it.

What we're left with is then a basic small budget zombie movie with a few actors in a small apartment and a few outdoor shots. That's how you do a small budget film: not many actors, not many sets. but without all that you have to turn to a character plot since you can't have rampaging zombie scenes, so this becomes a fairly conventional soap opera with two men in love with the same woman. There are other developments, of course, but that's the thing the plot turns on. Uniquely, there are two kinds of zombies: the slow, lumbering kind who mostly seem to be in a trance, and the ones with red eyes who possess intelligence and are fast and limber and can even climb fences to get at you. The zombies are pretty decently bad looking for a low budget film. These are actually ""infected"" and recently so. The acting is also okay, on a par with a minor TV show  or film.

Adds nothing new to the genre but a good addition to the catalog as a holiday movie (without much direct reference outside of Santa zombie and some decorations). I hope it's still on Prime next Christmas.",1455667200,,641,4.62280701754386
8457987,3,B0055CP9AY,Silent Night has some hits and some strikes. It's definitely lower budget and that is clear in the graphics and the story. The main actors do a good job though and carry the movie and all the action. The end is a head scratcher. Good for a laugh and to kill some time but not a must see. I loved the reviews in the movie calling it the best zombie movie ever and better than Romero. Ahh that was a good laugh.,1455580800,,409,4.0
