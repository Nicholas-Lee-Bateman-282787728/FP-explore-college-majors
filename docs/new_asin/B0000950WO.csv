I love mysteries. I love the P.D. James series. I love watching the investigation. I love the intellect of James. I love the way he deals with other characters.",1216425600,,333,8.0
1879179,4,B0000950WO,I thought this DVD was very well made. I liked it very much. Would recommend it to anyone.,1178409600,,90,4.055555555555555
1879180,4,B0000950WO,"I would give this five stars if the story line was not so choppy.  That expressed, I like Roy Marsden and this mystery twists and ducks, bobs and weaves to its solution.  It will keep you guessing.

The DVD is in perfect condition and the seller sent it promptly.  So maybe it ought to be 4 and a half stars.",1375574400,,308,4.083333333333333
1879181,3,B0000950WO,"I love PD James' works, and this is one of her trickiest,  but the movie does not do it justice, changing the ending to make the murderer look sympathetic, when in reality the murderer is cold-hearted, cruel, sadistic, and full of fury.  The movie missed this, but having said that Adam Dalgleish is performed well by the original Dalgleish actor and the rest of the story fits well; it is just the ending that changes what could have been a really good film to mediocre.",1361923200,,471,4.529411764705882
1879182,2,B0000950WO,"I'm a big fan of the Adam Dalgleish detective stories and recently purchased DVDs of the first three books in the series.  ""Cover Her Face"" was bad and ""A Mind to Murder"" worse, so I had only slight hopes for ""Unnatural Causes"" and they were quickly dashed.
  Although the script adheres more closely to the original plot than in ""A Mind to Murder"" it suffers from an unsuccessful attempt to develop the relationship between Dalgleish and Deborah Riscoe.  Roy Marsden falls flat as a romantic lead, Mel Martin bears little resemblance to the Deborah of the book, and there's no wonder sparks don't fly between them.  And alas, the script writers fail to salvage their fiasco with a poorly staged storm rescue scene.
  Please read P. D. James's Adam Dalgleish novels if you want 5-star detective stories; don't judge them by the DVD adaptations!",1360800000,,844,4.819444444444445
1879183,5,B0000950WO,"Make a hot cup of tea and just sit back and enjoy--we did and I keep
wondering how I didn't see who the culprit truly was;",1358294400,,122,3.730769230769231
1879184,3,B0000950WO,"My wife is more of a P.D. James fan than I am and has read the book; since I haven't I'll simply address my impressions of the DVD. First I'll mention that my wife also gave it three stars although the rating here is strictly my doing.

Importantly it was good enough that we wanted to finish it instead of stopping it at some point before the ending; that's saying something in its favor. As a music lover I'll admit the theme music is hauntingly beautiful and often finds its way into my thoughts; this sort of gets things off to a good start. The story as presented was not hard to follow and had some very dramatic and provocative scenes. I'll not repeat the story here but will simply say it made sufficient sense for me to avoid frustration with the progress of the story.

I always find English scenery interesting and the images presented as representing Suffolk held my attention. It seems like a rugged and unforgiving coastline along there as I'm much better acquainted with the softness, usually, of the Gulf Coast (hurricanes are an exception of course).

My wife and I agree that the situation involving the Commander and Deborah was somewhat abrupt there near the ending and didn't seem to have a sufficient buildup to justify what happened. We also share the opinion the ending seemed much too contrived and was the biggest disappointment of all.

By and large we shall probably not seek this one out to watch again although the first time around it was worth three stars.

I suggest you view it before you buy it.",1311120000,2,1530,4.569343065693431
1879185,4,B0000950WO,"Too much effort has been put into providing space in the shortened series episodes for all of Jame's plot. This makes for dead end plot lines, incomprehensible scenes, comprehensible scenes which no longer advance the plot. Clearly if one tries to adapt a complex novel such as one by the later James one must cut to the bone or saw off all the branches of the tree leaving only the solid trunk. Nevertheless, seen without concern to how faithful the film is to the original book, it is an entertaining hour and forty minutes. This episode marks the emergence of the humane, decent Dalgleish as distinct from the almost pure copper we saw earlier on. There is a parallel between his relationship to his lady-love and the murder victims to those who loved him. Aside from this, it is best to stick to the main line and not get too involved as to be frustrated by the seeming digressions
Should be pleasing to all James fans and to the general listener to PBS or BBC Mysteries",1291680000,,974,4.5397727272727275
1879186,2,B0000950WO,"The screenplay did not quickly identify the characters/relationships and was confusing for half the presentation.  The audio (as with many DVD's from the Mystery Series) was poor, getting loud and then too soft to understand.  Audio clarity was also poor making the ""English"" accents hard to understand.  The last 10 minutes of screenplay was truly horrible in concept and technique.  An implausible storm rescue scene that looked as if the technology used to film it was from the 1930's (or earlier).  It also appeared as primarily a ""time filler"" for the DVD run time requirement.  All in all a VERY mediocre effort for a fine novel's (novelist's?)plot.",1278979200,,655,5.074766355140187
1879187,3,B0000950WO,"The movie is well acted, well scripted and effective.
We believe the detective is trying to stop the blood from flowing
and just gets there too late because the murderer
is one of the least likely suspects to have the ability to pull off the crimes.
I enjoyed this one more than most.
The movie has that British quality of sort of
suspended emotions with stifled rage flowing below the surface.",1253232000,,394,4.563380281690141
1879188,4,B0000950WO,"P. D. James's stories are all nicely textured, with carefully-layered plotting and interesting characters.  In this story we have a crime novelist who is found dead, his hands severed from his body.  The suspects have alibis; one (a slightly effete and decidedly obnoxious critic) is played by the superb Bill Nighy.  There are two subplots, one involving a sleazoid gangster, the second involving Dalgleish and his relationship with his girl friend.  As those subplots intersect, the girl friend is threatened. The climax is particularly memorable, with a storm at sea and Dalgleish trapped with a suspect in a seaside cottage through which the winds are howling and in which the water is rising.  This is definitely worth a look, if only for the Nighy character.",1233273600,4,764,5.08
1879189,5,B0000950WO,"This is one of James' most suspenseful DVDs-just below A Certain Justice and
Original Sin. The ending is particularly so. Once again,Marsden plays Dalgliesh to
a ""T"",moving the case along at a good pace throughout. It is too bad that he is
unable to commit more time to his long time girl friend though. The color is excellent,
though I miss (as usual) Closed Captioning (even a list of characters with a summary
of their roles would have been useful as an extra. However,one does have the book &
can review the DVD (which can be a plus).The color is good,and the acting excellent.",1220400000,3,581,4.596153846153846
7989408,5,B0000950WO,Roy Marsden is to PD James what Joan Hickson and David Suchet are to  Agatha Christie,1449273600,,85,4.3125
7989409,3,B0000950WO,"Good movie.  Book better than the movie, if I had it to do over again I would not have ordered.  These movies are black & white.  There is a change in some of the story line in the DVD versus the book.",1446336000,,201,3.738095238095238
7989410,2,B0000950WO,"I watched this DVD again yesterday and it did not improve by a second viewing.  Please read the book and skip the movie.  The story is suppose to be Adam Dalgliesh and a holiday visit to his Aunt Jane.  His aunt is not even in the movie and I think that she would have added so much.  Instead his girlfriend Deborah is featured and she did not add anything to the story.  Roy Marsden is good as usual as Adam Dalgliesh. The movie shows Dalgliesh as running the investigation. He is not the investigating officer, that is DI Reckless.  In the book, P.D. James shows how Dalgliesh feels at being on the sidelines and could be considered one of the suspects.  I did enjoy the other characters.  The storm scene was good and the writer should have finished there or with Dalgliesh back at New Scotland Yard.",1438992000,,803,4.414965986394558
7989411,4,B0000950WO,"early in this series,  ok  ---- but series gets much better.  most BBC series are hard to beat  ---  always good acting",1420156800,,119,4.2272727272727275
7989412,5,B0000950WO,This is one of a series of PD James movies.  They are just what the doctor ordered if you love a good mystery.,1413676800,,110,3.782608695652174
7989413,5,B0000950WO,Marsden is a bit dry which makes the show. Great overall.,1408147200,,57,4.2727272727272725
7989414,5,B0000950WO,great movie. Any British mystery fan will love these. This one is excellent as are all the other Roy Marsden movies.,1406937600,,116,4.571428571428571
7989415,5,B0000950WO,"Written a good story with a great Inspector playing the part. Of course, I enjoy Marsden a lot so I may be a little biased. Anyway the story is good and keeps you interested and all the actors do a great job",1402617600,,207,3.9523809523809526
7989416,4,B0000950WO,"Any book by P D james is a fantastic read.  Her language flows, her grasp of English and turn of phrase absolutely superb.  I was pleased to find this new DVD with Roy Marsden as Adam Dalgliesh.  He is such an understated actor who reminds me of Robert Donat in the 'Winslow Boy' and Cary Grant in 'An Affair to Remember.'  They all can produce an effect by using nuances and understated body language which heightens the interest of the viewer.  Marsden i s just superb and I love his small smiles and well controlled body language with the women in the series.  He really has done justice to the detective Adam Dalgliesh in P D James books.  I view the DVD,s over and over when I need an escape from my humdrum life into something beautifully acted and spoken.",1401235200,,762,4.4
7989417,5,B0000950WO,I like this actor and he is good in this part. I wish he had done more of these shows,1388016000,,85,3.3
