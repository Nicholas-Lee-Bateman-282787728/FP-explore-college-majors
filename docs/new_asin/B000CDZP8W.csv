2459961,1,B000CDZP8W,"The video basically shows that clicking works, but there's no instruction on how to actually do the training.  It's a VERY short video on kids playing with puppies and an ADVERTISEMENT for the website and products.

Bottom line:  It's a total waste of money and should be labeled as an advertisement.",1207958400,7,300,4.8431372549019605
2459962,2,B000CDZP8W,"The idea of this DVD is great. Showing how you can clicker train a puppy, and that it is so easy, even a kid can do it.  For the most part, the DVD achieves that goal, but some poorly chosen footage, and kids who need to be clicker trained ruin the disc.  This looks like something that I could have produced with a DV video camera, and DVD authoring software.  It shows some good tips, but overall misses the mark.",1179619200,6,415,4.1625
2459963,2,B000CDZP8W,I did not learn much I did not already know.  If you have read even a very short book on the subject you will have covered all of the information in this DVD.,1178409600,9,158,3.787878787878788
2459964,5,B000CDZP8W,"This is a great video that shows how simple it can be to train a puppy using clicker training.  The most wonderful part is that it shows new trainers (children) and puppies with little to no training, and the simplicity of training a puppy.",1236729600,2,240,4.454545454545454
2459965,5,B000CDZP8W,"Clicker puppy not only shows how easy it is to train your puppy, it has great footage on training rabbits as well.  This is a wonderful DVD.  Clear, easy to follow and comprehensive.  Well worth the price.",1227916800,3,205,4.486486486486487
2459966,5,B000CDZP8W,"This DVD not only demonstrates how effective and quickly learned clicker training can be but also, if one watches both the children and dogs as the clicker is used, shows you the appropriate way to use the clicker with your dog.  A video of how to do ""clicker training"" is worth a thousand words of description -- and this DVD certainly does that illustrating.",1227830400,6,360,4.625
2459967,5,B000CDZP8W,"Clicker Puppy is a great visual description for parents to use to help coach their kids.  It is cute, and catchy.  The segment with the two cats, one being chased and one being left alone has so many applications...worth the dvd just for this showing kids (and parents) how to avoid being chased... I reccomend Clicker Puppy to all my families.

2459968,5,B000CDZP8W,"I recently viewed this video with my daughter who got her first Aussie a couple of weeks ago.  It was perfect for a beginner.  I appreciated the demonstrations and am excited to see her get started with it.

Thanks",1220313600,18,214,4.435897435897436
2459969,5,B000CDZP8W,"I *LOVE* this DVD! Both as a professional trainer, and as a breeder (Australian Shepherds, 15+ years) I think this is a fantastic DVD for introducing the concept of clicker training. It isn't an actual 'training' DVD (as in, this is how you teach 'heel', this is how you teach 'drop on recall'), but does teach a few behaviors while introducing the concept of clicker training & reinforcement. The emotional appeal of young children and adorable puppies are sure to hold people's interest. Plus, it shows that clicker training is so easy, even kids can do it! I like this DVD so much that I give it to each of my puppy families in their 'puppy pack'.

2459970,5,B000CDZP8W,"I use this video frequently to introduce individuals and families with children to the fun of using a clicker to train a puppy.  Children enjoy watching the cute puppies and parents can see how easy and safe the methods are. Viewers can see the communication that quickly develops between the puppies and the child trainers. The footage clearly shows how successful the children can be in a very short amount of time. The DVD comes with a printed supplement that gives important instructions on proper use of the clicker  to train a pup. The bonus clips on the DVD include among others, more training tips and a useful segment on the basics of dog body language called ""Speak Dog"".  I show this segment when doing dog bite prevention education sessions with children and their parents.  I am a professional dog trainer and behavior consultant and I find this DVD to be top notch.",1217894400,29,879,4.7254901960784315
2459971,5,B000CDZP8W,"This engaging DVD shows children clicker training puppies and makes the method accessible and appealing. People of any age will learn the basics quickly and be able to get started training their pets. As with everything produced by Doggone Safe, safety is stressed. This is a wonderful resource for families with young children!",1217635200,25,328,5.2075471698113205
2459972,4,B000CDZP8W,"Clicking is such a simple concept that it was actually difficult for me to grasp at first. Children are much more receptive;  so the beauty in this is it's simplicity. Because most of my golden puppies go to homes with children, early foundation is essential.  Getting and keeping the attention of both the child and/or the puppy can be difficult.  This is fun and instructional and has huge rewards going forward.  I recommend it to all my puppy buyers.",1217462400,11,454,4.708860759493671
2459973,4,B000CDZP8W,"It's wonderful to have a clicker training DVD on the market now that's geared especially for children and puppies. This DVD has a nice overview of simple obedience skills, and also covers the teaching of good manners like sit-to-greet.  There are even a few tricks included, too.

The training is shown in real time, and even though the kids don't always have perfect training skills, you can see how they get positive results with all the pups featured, and everyone is having a good time.",1217462400,11,490,4.752941176470588

8098029,1,B000CDZP8W,"This DVD is a complete waste of money--unless you want to know that you can use a clicker to train a puppy--but I just told you that so you don't need to waste your money.  This DVD doesn't teach you how you go about using commands (hand then verbal) or when to click for a behavior!  It just keeps telling you that it's possible.  I learned more from youtube videos than this DVD.  I don't think I've ever written a negative review before but this warrants a giant ""No!""  My friends have used clicker training and it works, but not from watching this DVD.",1377388800,,556,4.3076923076923075

8098031,4,B000CDZP8W,I am a 4-H leader for our dog project and I watched this with my own kids. My two youngest loved it and have already started using the ideas in here on their dogs. We did the clicker game with the group at our meeting this week. I only recommended this for trainers working with kids or parents with kids who are very interested in training their dogs.,1355356800,,352,4.1911764705882355
8098032,1,B000CDZP8W,"This dvd was an utter waste of money.  After reading the description and then seeing the dvd I could have thought that I received the wrong dvd. There is about 15 minutes of actual puppy/clicker interaction on the dvd.  The rest is fluff, filler and advertisements and it appears to be a home made production.
Surely there must be something better on the market than this.  The ""bonus"" tracks take up 80% of the dvd and they have almost nothing to do with clicker training of dogs.  There is even a rabbit training included!
A huge disappointment.",1339113600,2,547,4.608247422680412
8098033,1,B000CDZP8W,"Thought this would have alot more info on clicker training. It plays like a really bad home video with kids having fun with pups but no real concrete explanation on how to clicker train. I am a big advocate of clicker training and feel there's better material out there to learn how to clicker train your dog. I recommend Clicker Training for Dogs by Karen Pryor.

""Clicker Puppy"" would be a good program for using with children, to increase their confidence and skills.
