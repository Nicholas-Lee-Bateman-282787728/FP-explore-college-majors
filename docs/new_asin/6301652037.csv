341855,5,6301652037,"I have this movie on VHS it's one of my all time favorites and one of the best 80's movie ever made even tho the stars are kids it can easily be adults in these roles but since it is kids it makes the movie even better.

My VHS tape is wearing out so I'm waiting patiently still for this to be released on DVD it had a laser disc release so i don't get why they don't put that on DVD.

They can also stop wasting time re releasing multiple versions of a movie already released on dvd when great movies still have not been released at all.

My top 5 Movies that need to be released on DVD.

1-Big Shots
2-Hot to Trot/Bobcat Goldthwait & John Candy
3-Second Sight/Bronson Pinchot & John Larroquette
4-Pure Luck/Martin Short & Danny Glover
5-Madhouse/John Larroquette & Kirstie Alley

And i guess you could add Meatballs 3 starring Patrick Dempsey.

But by far Big Shots is the one movie that deserve a DVD above any especially so it doesn't disappear forever.",1266451200,,957,4.348314606741573
341856,5,6301652037,"I love this movie. It has adventure, comedy and a heartwarming story of
friendship and fatherhood. But don't get it twisted. This is not sappy, sugar coated kiddie movie. These kids have car chases with the police and the mob. You may remember Darius McClary from ""Family Matters"". It was the sitcom that made Steve Urkel a household name. Darius played Eddie Winslow. Anywho. Whenever you need a too laugh you self silly and see
some of the best car chases since ""Smokey and The Bandit"" , this is the flick for you. I've showed this movie to everyone I know from 18-85 years old and they all enjoyed it. This is truly a buried treasure.

Dear Santa...it's 12/19/10 and I am still waiting for my dvd copy of this movie. Maybe if I am a good I will get my copy for christmas next year. Ok. I know you tried. Whenever I get it I am sure it will be worth the wait. Maybe even some dvd extras. I now have an AARP card and I still love this movie. I have cookies to bake so I have to go now. Be blessed and not stressed.",1163030400,7,1015,4.152284263959391
341857,5,6301652037,"A worthy purchase if you can get your hands on it. A shame it is not available on DVD yet. A great movie from the 80's, with good performances from two young actors.

341875,3,6301652037,"The interaction between the boys keeps the film together. The plot is unbelievable.  No, it doesn't have to be, but I always wish writers would stretch a little and figure out how to get from one given situation to another believably. In a way, I think this wants to be a different take on Home Alone 2, but it feels like part of the drive of the early part of the film is to take away Obie the white kid's innocent view of life. It's clunky and uncomfortable in that way. The very first dialogue is he and his dad fishing and Dad is talking explicitly about the birds and the bees. The syrupy music and early morning lighting suggest that this a delicate bonding moment. I think it's partly the Era (Stand by Me came out the year before), but the film makes it so important for the kids to swear. That equals coming of age, see?

The bad guys in this movie should have been fleshed out more. They come off as idiots without being all that funny. Robert Prosky is less vulgar here than in Christine, but unnecessarily heartless.

Overall, it's entertaining.",1411171200,,1057,4.410256410256411
341876,5,6301652037,I love this movie from when I was a kid......watched it with my kids last night and they loved it! Timeless classic!!!!,1406851200,,119,4.454545454545454

341878,4,6301652037,This was a great movie and I really enjoyed watching it with my kids. Very diverse and it was touching.,1391212800,,103,4.2
341879,5,6301652037,"In the best tradition of Ivan Reitman movies, this is a roller coaster ride of a road movie. Obie, a young ""white boy"" from the suburbs, who has led a fairly sheltered life, runs away from school. In the process, he gets lost in a down town area and doesn't know how to cope. Scam, a streetwise ""businessman"" of the same age, agrees to help him, for the right price. This mismatched pair have a riot of a time avoiding murderers, cops, and ""the man"", becoming the best of friends in the process. One of my all-time favourite films. Sheer entertainment. Enjoy!",1391126400,,559,4.490196078431373
341880,4,6301652037,"I hadn't thought about this movie in years. One of the kids who starred in it sat behind me in first grade. Hah! I remember seeing it in the theater when it came out. An amusing, exciting adventure.",1388275200,,198,4.2368421052631575

341884,5,6301652037,"I would watch this movie when I was a kid. I always loved and enjoy it. It is a story about two kids from different worlds who become friends. One boy from the suburbs and one from the streets.  One boy had lost his father and another is waiting for his dad to come get him. They steal a car, Robb a store to get something that was taken from them back. Then go on a  adventure to find something they both need and or missed.

This is a movie made in the 80s. It is not one of the clean cut crap movie you see today. This movie had kids cussing and using cap guns. If you don't like that stuff then this is not the film for your kids. But if you like a fun adventure with kids in a time long forgot. This is the film for you. I have not seen this movie in about 15 years.  But I still love it and remember. It made me smile to see it again and I made sure to watch if a few times before my rental period expired then I bought it.",1370390400,2,929,3.7487179487179487
