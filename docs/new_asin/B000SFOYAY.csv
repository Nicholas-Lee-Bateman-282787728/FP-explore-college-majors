2884337,5,B000SFOYAY,I bought the DVD for my son Dustin who is 2 1/2 years old.  He absolutely LOVES The Wiggles and this DVD was no exception.  He watched it constantly until we bought him another Wiggles DVD from the store.  I really enjoyed this DVD and all of The Wiggles DVD's.,1210464000,,261,4.18
2884338,2,B000SFOYAY,This video is definitely Different from the other Wiggles videos.  The animation is a little wierd with the Really Big Heads.  My 4-yr-old did not really like it.,1209859200,,162,4.75
2884339,4,B000SFOYAY,"I bought this for my grandchildren,  they love it.  They ask for the Wiggles eveytime they come to my house. They are 4 and 2.  Space Dancing is the latest Wiggles video we have added to our Library.",1204502400,,199,4.184210526315789

8205200,3,B000SFOYAY,Disappointed.  This is not the originally released Space Dancing movie.  They left out one of the songs which was a favorite (!!) of my two oldest boys.  When I bought this movie for my younger two...they were disappointed that the song was not included.,1417219200,,254,4.7272727272727275
8205201,1,B000SFOYAY,"Update:
Here is what I have figured out about ""newer"" Wiggles videos. In the beginning, they were awesome to get your kids up and MOVING and DANCING. Now, many of them contain what is more like ""toe tapping"" tunes rather than good exciting DANCE tunes. I do put this in on occasion, but my two year old still doesn't seem to care for this all that much, it still just seems pretty slow moving. It's so-so, buy at your own risk.

Old review is below:

You may want to refer to my other review on The Wiggles ""You Make Me Feel Like Dancing."" Me and my older son were HUGE fans of the older videos, so I recently purchased a few new ones to add to our collection for the sake of my 18 month old toddler son but boy were we in for a surprise -so far the new ones are pretty bad, it seems the Wiggles have lost their magic and forgotten what made their early videos so fantastic (catchy simple lyrics and simple fun dance moves that appeal to young kids). This Space Dancing video was awful, boring, and nothing special.  It was more like an average cartoon you'd find on TV...actually correction, make that a below-average cartoon with bad music. It's heartbreaking, I tell you! I tell myself that the Wiggles probably didn't really write this script for this terrible piece of work, they probably just signed on for some cash, at least that's my hope, seems to be the only thing that can explain how something that was so good is now so bad. Anyway, my toddler is bored by this video and so am I, if it grows on him as he gets older I'll update this review to be fair, but for now I must balance out some of the other reviews (which puzzle me) and warn potential buyers that you might be better off wadding up your dollar bills and playing basketball with your trash can rather than buy this video. It would be more fun than watching Space Dancing. The sad truth.
I'm sorry.  :-(",1304208000,,1876,4.290960451977401
8205202,5,B000SFOYAY,"My daughter(now 2) has so much fun dancing and watching the Wiggles! This DVD has a great animation quality. I find myself dancing, singing and humming their fabulous songs!",1297555200,,173,5.0
8205203,4,B000SFOYAY,"Wiggles space dancing is my 3-year-old daughter's favorite Wiggles movie. We rented this every trip to Blockbuster just so she could get her ""Wiggles"" fix. Last Christmas it was on her want-list, but she didn't get it during the holiday. So, I found it on Amazon last month and decided to buy it. Much to my surprise, her grandmother bought the same movie for her too. So, my daughter has a copy of this movie at our house, and one at grandma's.

If you have ever seen the Wiggles in concert, or watched any of the Wiggles movies, then be prepared for a unique experience with Wiggles Space Dancing. The cast of the Wiggles; Greg, Jeff, Murray, Anthony are converted into computer animated avatars in Jeff's dream. Even Dorothy, Captain Feathersword, Henry the Octopus, and Waggs the Dog become computer animated.

After a visit from some space aliens, the Wiggles are led aboard the spaceship by the ever inquisitive Captain Feathersword. A few ""magic button"" presses later and the colorful comrades blast off into outerspace. They crew are lost in space and wind up visiting a few planets (and singing lots of songs of course) on their way back to Earth. Once back on Earth Jeff wakes up. The viewer is left wondering if the dream was real, or just a dream after all.

I recommend this movie to anyone with previous experience watching the Wiggles movies or concerts. It really is a fun adventure for the little ones to watch.",1281052800,,1428,4.681274900398407
8205204,2,B000SFOYAY,"My two daughters and I love the Wiggles.  We own about 20 DVDs, almost every one they've made.  This is the only one we are not a fan of.  It's just weird.  My 3 year old kept asking where the Wiggles were.  She didn't understand that they were animated wiggles.  There is too much goofy story and not enough singing and dancing.",1261699200,,329,4.225806451612903
8205205,5,B000SFOYAY,"My boys have been watching this movie at least once a day, everyday, since we received it.  Great, purchase.  The Wiggle Rock!!!",1251504000,,128,4.7727272727272725
8205206,5,B000SFOYAY,"This is a very good DVD. It is very different from the normal Wiggles shows.  It is a story using clay/computer images.  My girls really like it, but it took a time or two for them to really get into it.  They LOVE The Wiggles, so after they were use to seeing the Wiggles a little differely they really enjoy watching it.",1243209600,,322,4.161290322580645
8205207,5,B000SFOYAY,"My 2 1/2 year old nephew loves this video and learned the title instantly, so the first thing he says when he visits me is ""watch Spacing Dancing?"".",1219795200,,148,4.321428571428571
