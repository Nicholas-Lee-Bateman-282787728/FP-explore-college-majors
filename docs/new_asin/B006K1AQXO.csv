5000349,2,B006K1AQXO,"We love Word Girl, but DO NOT GET THIS ONE unless your want your kids to start calling people names and being mean. That is now Miss Power gets her power, and as much as I tell my 4 and 5 year old boys that it doesn't work for her (Word Girl does, of course, defeat her), they run around the house saying I'm Miss Power and have gotten into saying things like ""You're stupid"" and ""Your smell"" then laughing...thinking it is funny and gives them power.  I am trying to back pedal fast out of this, not allowing them to watch it anymore...but I sure wish I hadn't in the first place.",1386720000,2,581,4.1415929203539825
5000350,5,B006K1AQXO,Granddaughter has enjoyed Word Girl & continues to enjoy her.  There are not a lot of female super heroes.  Word Girl fills the bill.,1384560000,,133,4.5
5000351,4,B006K1AQXO,Ms. Power is a bully and Word Girl stands up to her. My daughter loves Word Girl and I love the message in this story.,1373587200,,118,3.76
5000352,4,B006K1AQXO,"After recently rediscovering this show, I was reminded of its simple charm and clever humor, and how it has fun with the superhero genre and hero/villain dynamics.  This DVD has a great bit of content, including a two-parter ""A World Without Wordgirl"" and a silly but fun spin-off based on an in-universe show called Pretty Princess and Magical Pony Power Hour (which is both silly and doesn't take itself seriously, but also has an innocent charm).  The main event, ""The Rise of Miss Power"", is a great mini-movie.  Many of the stories main villains show up, along with cameos for almost every less common villain (Yay Learnerer!).  The story isn't ground-breaking, but it has great heart and there were a few gem moments.  Whether trying to teach some new words and morals to your kids, or looking for a fun and innocent cartoon, I would recommend this!",1366243200,,855,4.789115646258503

5000354,4,B006K1AQXO,"When I originally set this up to record I thought it was a 1/2 hour episode when in fact it was an hour long special, so I missed the last half.  I eventually saw the rest of The Rise of Miss Power on the PBS Kids site but this episode was so good that I wanted a recording to watch whenever I wanted.  I figure that PBS isn't going to have another 1 hour time slot for WordGirl anytime soon, so the chances that Rise of Miss Power will be rerun seem slim.  So I ordered the DVD.  I watch WordGirl for the witty banter and gags more than anything.  The superhero action is fun but not remarkable (what do you expect from PBS?) and I already know the definitions of practically all the words they present in the series.  A departure from the normal episodes are intervening segments featuring the Pretty Princess character instead of May I Have a Word.  Pretty Princess, of course, is super cheesy but the writers are fully aware of this and the result is delightfully ironic humor like that of Mystery Science Theater 3000.",1351123200,2,1023,4.352631578947369
5000355,5,B006K1AQXO,"It is most likely the best Word Girl film there ever will be, with a great plot. However, the summary is a little off as one of the people commenting here mentioned (Word Girl isn't just angry at villains). If you like Word Girl, this movie is the BEST!",1338422400,4,253,4.183673469387755

5000357,4,B006K1AQXO,"Great PBS kids show; clever and funny script writing, great characters, and excellent voice acting. Show is enlightening, enriching, and entertaining. My biggest disappointment with this release (and other previous DVD releases) is that Beau Handsome and the ""Beau-nus"" round of the game show ""May I Have A Word"" is not included, nor is Captain Huggy Face's ""Show us the definition of the word ... "" spot and his resulting dance moves. You have to watch the TV episodes to see those. I'm sure there's some sort of reason why those segments are not included with each episode. Still, a let down.",1332633600,4,594,4.833333333333333
5000358,5,B006K1AQXO,"this is a very good film one the best wordgirl episodes ever. It delivers a very good message that bullying in any form or situation is wrong and degrading. I totally recommend this for anyone, with or without kids.",1331596800,4,215,4.538461538461538
