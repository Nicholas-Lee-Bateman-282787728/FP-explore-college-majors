I got my copy through audible.com and listened to it while driving to and from work. Loved every lecture and discussion. Professor Brier is an avid Egyptologist whose specialty is mummies.

I was especially enthralled listening to his musings on The Exodus during lecture 32. The information he provides a plausible case to Exodus taking place during Ramses II and that it was Ramses II's son who was lost at about year 20 of his 67-year reign.

I should add that during my 15-- years residing in Egypt, I lived a short while in the area Brier theorizes was the route utilized by Moses.

Further, I was fortunate to visit a newly discovered tomb to Merenptah in the area 1 Km north of the Masala in Mataria, which is old Heliopolis (On). Merenptah was Ramses II's 13th son, successor to Ramses II. On my second visit to this tomb I got a couple of photos of a bust of what archaeologists thought was a Ramses-era statue. One of the objects was, essentially, a mini-Sphinx with a twist.

The Sphinx had two cat-type legs and at approximately heart height, the carved relief of a lion head that reminded me of a cougar's head (female lion with no mane is what I mean).

I'm no Egyptologist, but I mention the above just in case someone reading this review might be able to make a connection as to the sculpting of a sphinx with the additional legs extending down as of Ramses were sitting in a chair and merged with the Sphinx, plus having a lion face on his chest.

Anyway, this lecture series is outstanding and is a great alternative to reading chronological texts on Ancient Egypt.

Professor Brier's love and respect for the Egyptian culture is refreshing. I would rate this as one of the best studies of Ancient Egypt ever produced.",1428710400,2,1755,4.56687898089172
186618,5,1565855744,"Fantastic course, the amount of information that is covered in this series is incredible. Professor Bob brier's teaching style is Great! He  blends hard knowledge and fact with his own educated speculations on certain topics like king tut for example that makes the learning experience captivating and easy to follow. He paints a picture of these ancient people that allows us to imagine them as they were; real people with lives and problems like us today. As far as Egyptology courses, or just ancient egyptian history classes in general this is one of the best.  I would highly recommend!",1424390400,,591,4.959595959595959

It couldn't be otherwise because know other production has 48 segments of a 1/2 hour each. Bob Brier, the lecturer, clearly knows his topic and his enthusiasm comes through most readily to viewer. I learned a great deal, and in addition to watching other productions on ancient Egypt, I've read more than one book. I loved this. :-)",1391472000,2,429,4.657894736842105

186624,5,1565855744,"This is a well thought out course that develops the material chronologically while digressing into areas of special interest, such as Akhenaten and monotheism, so that the progression of the material is always rather fresh and exciting.  Bob Brier clearly loves Egypt and Egyptology.  I went through the material prior to a trip to Egypt and was amazed at how well these lectures prepared me for what I saw.  Without them I would not have understood the significance of what I was seeing as well, even though we had an egyptologist guiding us on the trip.  Most of all, I think the lectures engendered in me a love for Egypt and its antiquities.  Listening to these lectures is a great experience.",1311638400,3,697,4.7272727272727275

His love for ancient Egypt and obvious talent for teaching makes you wishing for more at the end of each lecture. Even after reading quite a bit on the subject this course gave me so much new and interesting information. Just a pleasure to listen.,1259193600,4,404,4.328947368421052
7796505,5,1565855744,"Greetings Amazonians,

Briers Great Course The History of Ancient Egypt is fun and informative. It runs in more or less chronological order from the earliest human origins on the Nile to the life of Cleopatra. If you have an interest in history or in the topic in particular you will almost certainly enjoy this course. Each lecture is informative and the course fits together quite well. There is a lot of information in the course. Brier is an excellent lecturer who injects humor and thoughtful comments into each lecture.
If you are interested in Biblical history and the problem of the historicity of the Joseph stories and the Exodus, then you will find Brier offers a complete lecture on each topic. I was rather surprised that Brier came down pretty solidly on the side of historicity or some likely historical events being the basis of the narratives.

Enjoy.",1525046400,,868,4.858108108108108
7796506,5,1565855744,The content is fantastic......this DVD-series filled-in the holes and gaps in my personal knowledge of ancient Egypt and Dr Brier's lecturing style is spot on.....THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!!,1506988800,,186,5.448275862068965
7796507,5,1565855744,"Bob Brier, in my opinion, is one of the best presenters in the Great Courses Series.  He is personable, doesn't rely entirely on just notes- he really has it down pat- outstandingly knowledgeable of his subject matter; keeps eye contact on the camera- therefore audience- almost , and I'm not exaggerating, all the time. Buy HIS courses, and you will be well pleased, believe me.",1498867200,,379,4.8307692307692305
7796508,5,1565855744,"Let me first preface my review by saying that I was a history major in college, and I have long had an interest in Ancient Rome.  I have read many books and watched many documentaries on the topic over the decades.  So, I am not a newcomer to this topic, but I still learned things in this course.  The professor is cogent and organized and provides a good timeline.  My main complaint is that this is a little too much of a broad survey course for such a nuanced and important part of history.  The later part of Roman history especially gets short shrift, though, to his credit, the professor warns the listeners at the beginning of his intent.  He justifies this at least somewhat by arguing there is a nebulous line between the end of late Roman period and the beginning of the early Medieval period.  While there is an argument to be made for his approach, I wish this one of the Great Course's 60 lesson classes to give enough time to do more justice to the Imperial and late Roman periods.  That being said, I will give the professor the benefit of the doubt that he did not have a say as to the length of the course.

I really liked the professor's tempo of switching between political and social history.  He struck a very nice balance, which is often hard to do with many courses becoming overly dominated by one or the other.",1493596800,,1336,4.372469635627531
7796509,5,1565855744,"I have taken many history classes in my life and this one ranks as one of the best. This course represents exactly what the Great Courses series is supposed to be about: the best professors giving the best lectures. This course covers the history of Ancient Egypt from the earliest historical information through the ultimate fall to Rome, a span of approximately 3,000 years. The professor uses a sequential approach to the lectures working his way through the history of the civilization, which works marvelously to help develop a chronology of events in my mind (the professor rarely gives an actual datehe wants you to learn chronology not dates). For example, I knew that the pyramids were built before the time of famous Egyptians like Rameses the Great, but the sequential presentation really helped me appreciate just how vast the timescales in Ancient Egyptian history really are. It is fascinating to think that Rameses the Great was as separated in time from the construction of the pyramids as we are today from the reign of Charlemagne. Throughout the course, the professor takes occasional ""side trips"" from the sequential order to discuss general topics that are not unique to a particular time period, such as the process of mummification, the practice of mummifying animals, Egyptian mythology and Egyptian medicine. These side trips keep the course from becoming monotonous and provide a lot of color and interest. From a presentation standpoint, I really appreciate how the professor makes it clear when he is deviating from the sequence to take these side trips, which avoids confusion. The professor is extraordinarily enthusiastic, very well informed and exceptional at presentation skills.",1489449600,,1712,5.206521739130435
7796510,5,1565855744,"Ok, so this is the first book I've fully read on Ancient Egypt.
What made me purchase this on audio is because listening to Prof. Bob Brier (author) say that ancient Egypt is the most important ancient civilization in ancient history, won me over.

This lector series is a great start into uncovering Egypt. I learned soooooo much and researched all that stood out to me in this book. It's easy to listen too and Prof. Brier is really entertaining to listen to, you can hear the enthusiasm in his voice.

The coolest part in this book for me is that Prof. Brier tells you when he's going to provide his theory aside from archeological facts. Because there's still so much more about A.E that's undiscovered and lost, that it leaves gaps for theory and logic to apply itself.

Also unexpectedly, a big part of learning A.E is learning the stories of the archaeologist themselves on how they uncovered artifacts and tombs. Which is important, because you find out why certain aspects about Egypt are glorified and others aren't as much.

Example: King Tuts tomb was discovered by archeologist Howard Carter and Carter was English. King Tuts casket itself weight 250lbs and was made of pure solid gold. Meanwhile Psusennes I's casket was made of pure silver and was found by the French. Gold is worth more in both countries so King Tut is talked about more often. But Psusennes I was the richer king, as back in ancient times, silver was 3x worth more than gold!

Great book and course! I highly recommend it to anyone. It really covered a vast array if not every area of A.E life! definitely a 5 star book.",1488067200,,1604,4.614035087719298
7796511,5,1565855744,"I really like Professor Bob Brier!! this an excellent course, hope to be able to find the rest of the set",1469664000,,105,4.0476190476190474
7796512,5,1565855744,"Background:  I have listened to about 20 of the lectures in the audio book format and now I had seen the DVD set, at a great price and I couldn't resist getting them too.  This series of lectures from Dr. Brier is something I was made aware of on a sampler of another of the ""Great Courses"" sets that I had checked out from my local library.  This was something that I always said to myself that if it hit the right price (not that it's not worth more than I paid, just ""how much do I want to pay for a DVD set"" sort of thing)

I am not going into reviewing the content too much as there are HOURS AND HOURS of it, though I had a few questions about the DVD set that I hope to answer for others who may be wondering the same thing I was.

Is the DVD set worth it if you have the audio book version?:  It depends.... (some answer, eh?) ... I mean I do not think you are missing a ton of content with the audio book version, though like the other ""Great Course"" DVD Sets I have seen over the years, there are visual aides like maps when he is talking about different areas or times in Egypt's history.  When he is talking about a person, alot of times there are pictures of that person (or status anyway)appearing on the screen.

Professor Brier's style is ...well it's exactly what I saw on The Great Course's own website from another reviewer...He is not that sort of teacher talking down to you, but rather that family member or friend you always got along with and just love to have a conversation with. Mr. Brier KNOWS ALOT about what he is talking about though it's his enthusism that really comes through when you hear him explain things.  I was already interested in learning about the ancient past and a fan of Mr. Brier as well as Dr. Zahi Hawass, though I could see someone watching these for the first time, who didn't INTIALLY have that same interest, REALLY enjoying this series.

There are some parts of this series where things are based on OPINION and Mr. Brier points out that ""this is JUST MY OPINION... IT'S NOT FACT... and I could be wrong ..."" when explaining his opinion AND he also goes into detail explaining the opinions of some others who he may not agree with but like I just pointed out he thinks ""well maybe THEY ARE right"".  I can not say how much I LOVE this open mindset and the williness to say ""I may be wrong""

The one thing to be said is these WERE recorded in 1999, so some of the facts may not be true today due to new discoveries and to be honest ... Mr. Brier (and others... ) may have been some of the people who made those new discoveries.

I would definitely recommend this course in any form and while I had my own limits for how much I would pay for the DVD set ... I can not claim the DVD set is not ""worth more"" than what I paid, because I have to be honest, IT is WORTH more than what I paid.  If you can get over the fact that this being recorded/released almost 15+ years ago from the time I am typing this and some new discoveries were almost definitely made SINCE then... then I would say no one even slightly interested in this course would be disappointed, getting the audio version or the DVDs.",1455235200,4,3148,4.181818181818182
