8298552,5,B001EL6EG8,Purchased for Grandchildren to watch with Grammy over the holidays.  Laughed until we cried.  Funny!,1263168000,,100,5.6
8298553,4,B001EL6EG8,"I bought Shrek the 3rd with Shrek the Halls because I knew there was a sub par shrek movie I had seen and my son loves Shrek 1 and 2.  He is just under 2 years old and he will watch either movie straight through no problems.  Thankfully he also enjoyed Shrek 3 which I find rather tedious.  Shrek the Halls is a breath of fresh air, and rates up there with Shrek 1.

Pity it is a made for Christmas TV episode rather than a movie...because it is a great view, just not worth the standard DVD price tag given the length.

I recommend this package, my son loves both movies, but we typically watch Shrek the halls and Shrek 1/2, we only watch Shrek 3 once a month tops because it just isn't as good.",1252713600,,697,4.0583941605839415
