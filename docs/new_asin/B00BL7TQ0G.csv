5643408,4,B00BL7TQ0G,"Wow, what an amazing film!

While this movie plays like a slice of life drama in a neighborhood in Recife, every single scene is carefully and meaningfully put together to speak about the nature of social structures in Brazil which date back to plantation times.

These things may be more discernible in Northeastern states like Pernambuco where the plantations once flourished, formed the basis of the societal constructs and defined human relationships, but their residue still permeates the country as a whole, which, while trying to move beyond them, still remains mired in the same kind of stratifications.

The film opens with black and white pictures of a plantation and then segues into a drama in 3 acts, using a crisscrossing narrative that delves into the day to day lives of various people who live and work on same street. And through their interactions and involvements we are given a very clear picture of class system as microcosm.

This film is more than a simple slice of life. For those of you familiar with the films of Lucrecia Martel (Argentina), what seems to be disconnected and inconsequential is put together like a jigsaw puzzle that leads brilliantly to the films final scene, at which point the entire story crystallizes before our very eyes, and we realize how well it has been supported and enriched by all we have been shown.

I thought the script was particularly brilliant in that ""natural,"" daily life scenes end up speaking volumes in the end, although perhaps they were more resonant for me since I just spent time in Brazil. It's one of those films where you know something is about to happen, but you're not sure what or with whom until it does. Just pay attention to everything you see and hear, and everything that seems unimportant will take on much more meaning afterwards.

Throughout the film, there are narrative constructs for use to take hold of: the chapter headings, certain scenes that foreshadow, and a soundtrack that underscores where we are headed, without ever being exactly clear what we should prepare for. And this is, to a large part, the filmmaker's genius.",1369180800,4,2118,4.885793871866295

8570218,5,B00BL7TQ0G,"If you are an American (and by that term I mean everyone from Tierra del Fuego to Point Barrow and all points in between) you really need to see this riveting portrait of our collective Post-Columbian selves, shown in all our glorious and intractable contradictions, with an ever present, almost palpable sense of menace lurking behind every whitewashed wall and curtain.

Our collective legacies are literally all here:

The past and the present.

The rich and the poor.

The black and the white.

And there is a revelation here as well: Where it counts, Brazil and the United States are not all that different from each other.

You just gotta see this one!",1458172800,,658,4.778761061946903
8570219,4,B00BL7TQ0G,"Neighboring Sounds (2012 release from Brazil; 131 min.) brings the story of a neighborhood in Rafice, Brazil. The movie opens with somber music and photo stills from Brazil at yesteryear. The montage then changes over to the neighborhood where we get to know various people and families. There is Joao, grandson of the patriarch who owns much of the area, and his new squeeze Sofia. There is Maria, the housemaid, and her kid. There is Dinho, Joaos alleged no good cousin. There is Bia, the bored housewife who buys pot from the water-delivery guy. And on and on. When Sofias car is broken into (to steal her CD player), Joao suspect Dinho. Eventually, the neighborhood agrees to hire a private security firm. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, youll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first, this is the latest movie from Brazilian writer-director Kleber Mendona Filho. This time, the director focuses on the apparently banal day-to-day life of what looks to be a well-off segment. Of course, those well-off hire lots of support, including cleaning and housekeeping help, errand boys, etc. Much of the movie hence exposes not only the class differences, but the correlating wealth differences. In one of the key scenes of the movie, the owners of the apartment building are discussing the possible firing of the doorman/receptionist. Just watch! Second, the issue of security is a close underlying theme as well. It must be a huge concern for people in Brazil, and apparently not just in the favelas. The scene in the movie where the security guys are trying to convince Joao that he should hire them is another pivotal moment in the movie, as they use every trick in the book (from soft threats to reverse psychology) to get hired. Third, the movie is set in Recife, in northern Brazil right on the ocean. It looks to be a beautiful city (Ive visited Brazil but not yet Recife). Last but no least, if you think this is some sort of action movie, by all means, to no get this movie, as the pace of the movie is deliberately slow, consisting mostly of observing people and their environment.

Bottom line: this is a top-quality movie. No wonder that it was Brazils nomination for the Best Foreign Language Movie Oscar in 2013. If you are in the mood for a great class and community study that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. Please note that the DVD comes with a booklet containing a nice essay that provides further context as to the movie. Neighboring Sounds is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1408924800,,2586,4.757238307349666
8570220,4,B00BL7TQ0G,"This film made me aware I know very little about life in Brazil. I had to read about the movie in other sources before I began to appreciate the the story.

The Amazon description omitted that the Bluray has features that the DVD does not. I purchased the DVD thinking it had the 3 extra short films were included. Only one was.",1397865600,,328,4.290322580645161
8570221,5,B00BL7TQ0G,Modern day Recife is filled with contradictions that are well documented in this well acted story of  middle class life coming up against cultural conflicts.,1384992000,,157,5.28
8570222,4,B00BL7TQ0G,"This is the debut feature length film from Brazilian film maker  Kleber Mendona Filho, who has made a film that is so subtle in approach to the issues it deals with, that you are going to love it or hate it. Original title was ""O Som ao Redor""  and it opens  in black and white with scenes of poor field workers sweating for a pittance in the fields in the countryside, this then morphs to a girl on roller blades enjoying herself in an upper class urbanisation, and in colour. Then we are confronted with a `nice' residence in Recife, Eastern Brazil, where the affluent residents are suffering from a mini crime wave.

The `action' is predominantly shown by the noises emanating from parts of the street. We have a dog that never shuts up, vacuum cleaners car screeches and all the urban rumble with intense happenings closer to home. So a security firm is hired and the neighbours soon all chip in to hire their services. Brazil is a have and have not society where the poor are very poor indeed and the rich don't want them near them except to do the jobs they don't like - much like here actually. A lot of Brazilian films take place in those crime infested areas like the favellas but this is how the other half live. We have a water delivery guy who supplies a bit more than H2O, a couple who are happy to copulate in front of `the help' and a local don type who doesn't mind swimming with sharks, to name but a few.

It is layered but all comes together in the central themes of inequity, insecurity and crime in a very split society. The need to protect what is yours also leads people to being more isolated and at times it has the feeling of claustrophobia. The security guards are also not what they seem and all is set up for a very intriguing ending.

This is one of those films that is a journey and not merely a series of twists at the end to get the audience gasping. There is a message and I actually thought it has ""worthy"" written all over its sleeve. That for me was the real problem here, and the 131 minute run time, it could have been a lot shorter, once you have made your point you are allowed to move on and not keep on making it. The humorous parts are needed but are few and far between; however this does stand up relatively well but as I said earlier will provoke strong emotions and not very much fence sitting. I actually liked it but I am a keen World cinema fan, even so I felt the pacing and length acted as a barrier to my absolutely loving it, I will though happily watch Kleber Mendona Filho's next one due in 2014 called `Bacarau' and wish him all the best.",1375056000,4,2596,4.255578093306288
8570223,5,B00BL7TQ0G,"Set in a middle class high-rise in the Brazilian city of Recife, this extraordinary debut feature by former film critic Kleber Mendona Filho is a voyeuristic tour-de-force; rich in humor, domestic life, class and character drama, private and public pleasure, ambiguity (though the narrative is significantly less ambiguous than many claim), and a unique, driving undercurrent of anxiety. The connection between this Polanski-esque dread and the favendas (plantations) and engenhos (sugar mills) of Brazil's past is established in a black and white montage that opens the film, accompanied by a heart-like, low register beat that continues throughout, pressing against the high-rise's mundane action, tenuous security, and bourgeois delights. The percussive, spare scoring (provided by DJ Dolores, following Filho's request for something ""more than noise but less than music"" ) punctuates and anticipates several extremely effective smash-cuts, and generates an uneasy yet engaging atmosphere, culminating in a child's nightmare that is among the best dream sequences I've seen, ranking with the rape/rescue dream in The Bitter Tea of General Yen (d. Frank Capra, 1933), Dr. Borg's nightmare of an empty street in Wild Strawberries (d. Ingmar Bergman, 1957), and Rosemary's dream eliding the memory of a nun with sounds of her neighbor through her bedroom's thin wall in Rosemary's Baby (d. Roman Polanski, 1968). The finale is duly satisfying as its Marxist dimension, though never didactic, has been in evidence for nearly two hours without taking so direct and horrific a form. Wherever the viewer falls in their sympathies/identifications, the groundwork - what might be considered visual evidence if not argument - has been laid for the scene in question, and it carries a delicious combination of surprise and inevitability.
  Owing largely to the use of off-screen, predominantly ambient sound - as well as deep focus compositions that often favor negative space - there is an uncommon sense of air, tropical heat, the open street/intersection, and nearby rooms and interior space. The sound design is densely, expertly layered and occasionally surreal, suggesting unseen neighbor and invader, desires unspoken and unknown. Benefiting from a gestation of nearly two decades, `Sounds combines elements from various shorter pieces Filho completed in the interim between 1994 (when he wrote the screenplay) and the film's release early last year.  His choice to shoot in widescreen, Super 35 `Scope appears itself to be an act of defiance, for a film that might just as easily have been shot on high-definition video, providing a pictorial consonance with the spirit/presence of surveillance video in the urban setting, and lower dynamic range with darker - though not deeper - blacks. However, it should be noted the choice to shoot in video (with the possible exception of Arriflex's recent Alexa line of cameras) would have been less effective than film, and perhaps disingenuous, as Filho laments the death of the public cinema in one brief scene (apparently his favorite ) that is all the more piquant for its lightness. On a weekend break from the city, the scion of the high rise's paterfamilias cavorts through the overgrown ruins of a cinema with his girlfriend, mimicking gunplay in some genre staple as an extra-diegetic film score plays in the background, the roofless lobby and auditorium, weathered screen, decorative elements, and faade exposed and decaying like a carcass in broad daylight. The scene is one of a handful that break from the urban street and high-rise environment pitting upper and lower classes in literal opposition to one another.

The blu-ray version and a superior sound system are strongly recommended.",1374969600,3,3743,5.382252559726963
