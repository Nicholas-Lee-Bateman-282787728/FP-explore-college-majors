8191153,5,B000PGCHZ0,"DR. CHEN'S 001 DVD
I am having a wonderful MIND, BODY, SOLE, AND HART RELEASE BY WORKING ALL DAY LONG AND ALL NIGHT LONG DOING DR. CHEN'S DVDs WORK. Years ago I saved my life and my mother's and sister's life  too since mom was driving and I was 15 and my sister was 8 years old. the awful C curve on the entire right side of my body is only now gone from my nonstop working on DR. CHEN'S FANTASTIC STARTING 001 DVD. I WAS AMAZED THAT HE HAD ME SITTING IN A FLAT CHAIR AND ONLY MOVED AND TURNED MY TORSO. I KEPT MY PELVIS AND LEGS STILL AND COMPLETELY BALANCE ON THE FLOOR. I PLAYED IT ON  MY BACK PORCH WHERE I FOUND THAT MY 35 ACRES LOOKED JUST LIKE WHERE DR. CHEN IS DOING HIS TAI CHI CONGFA. I LOVE DOING THIS SINCE I LEARNED THE SAME THING TYPE OF MOVING MY BODY IN A FLAT CHAIR BACK WHEN I WAS 3 YEARS OLD LEARNING WHO TO RIDE A HORSE WELL. This is a great way to start working EVERY THING IN YOUR BODY to become ""Relaxed and Released"" by DR.Chen.",1401840000,,953,3.882051282051282
