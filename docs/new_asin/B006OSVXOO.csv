""Great art"", as Robert McKee teaches, ""is experiencing the artist's creation in such a way that the encounter forever changes you as a human being."" I fully believe this.

In film as the greatest art form the human race has yet achieved the artist's arrow is the power of story. A tale unfolds so intimately, intensely, unexpectedly, and profoundly that it leads to some new insight, some new understanding of the individual and collective human condition and you are changed forever from the experience of the transcendent encounter.

There are 50,000 scripts registered with the WGA West and East each year.

Out of this pool there are 10,000 circulating scripts in any given collection of years that achieve representation in the film business with a professional marketing organization of some kind behind them.

Out of those 10,000 there are 350 films made that achieve distribution. That's just 3.5% that achieve the success of being brought into the world from the page. Out of those 350 the goal is to be one of the top 5 films a year that are truly profound works of transcendent artistic craft that can change the consciousness of the entire World.

In 2013 I would certainly put the film ""Gravity"" in one of the 5 this year. A simple story line beautifully told using every power of film craft. Just wonderfully executed in every category across the board including the understated dialogue and acting skills that beautifully serve what happens. So to set out on this road is truly one of the greatest quests in life. It appears 50,000 Souls from many walks of life in every imaginable day job profession (myself as a professional software engineer/programmer) are on this path every single day somewhere on Earth trying to write one of those 5 movies that starts on the blank page.

Like everyone on this road I have studied many teachers to name JUST A FEW (in alphabetical order) Pilar Alessandra, Lajos Egri, Syd Field, Mitchell German, Marilyn Horowitz, Kim Hudson, Lew Hunter, William C. Martell, Robert McKee, David McKenna, Jeffrey Alan Schechter, Linda Seger, Blake Snyder, Alexandra Sokoloff, John Truby, and Christopher Vogler. And like everyone I have found something very useful and very valuable in ALL of their systems and insights.

I think everyone should start with Robert McKee and the late Syd Field who passed away just this past week (God rest his Soul.)  I especially love Pilar Alessandra's working system, Blake Snyder and Marilyn Horowitz's structure systems and Mitchell German's terrific software plotting tool. I have taken many Wednesday 90 minute Internet classes at the Writer's Store and loved every single minute of it. Just wonderful stuff! But I had somehow never heard of Irv Bauer!

Through a very mystical series of fortuitous coincidences, my writing partner learned of him when he gave his business card to a friend of hers and that person immediately thought to give it to her. I took this series of mystical occurrences as some kind of Cosmic sign! I immediately ordered his $229 4-DVD course and started in. Wow! How had I ever missed this guy?

It was just what we were looking for! A complete step-by-step creative, flexible, but highly focused working process that would get us out of compositional writing to purely left brain structural theories and back to the Divination fundamentals of COMBINED left brain AND right brain writing for film. It has been worth every penny as someone else has written on here! For me this was because I found out I really did not know in my ""chops"" what the ""fundamentals"" of writing for film really were. I certainly do now and I am improving with precision every single day. Even just sitting and thinking on my story line in traffic is much more clarified and focused in direct highly efficient cinematic creativity and not mere word centric compositional creativity. I can see the story in direct film format flow.

The DVD course was so useful that I signed up for the $500 10-Exercises personally supervised lessons under the special DVD Course combined purchase. Every thing that I have ever learned on my previous path has been extremely useful. I thank all the current teachers of writing for film that I have been fortunate enough to discover. But I was not there yet.

Back in the 70's it was said that the road to the Super Bowl went through Pittsburgh. Even though they are having a tough year this year, I will still use the analogy. No matter what path you are on in developing your own personal unique screenwriting system (and everyone MUST develop their own personal unique system) I suggest that your road to being the author of one of those 5 films goes through Irv Bauer.

Why? Because from experiencing your own mind and your own chops under fire writing in Irv's system of step-by-step film writing fundamentals exercises you are going to learn to get your Muse to come to you in terse direct film format. The more you can get the mysteries of that process into your own unique personal creativity, the faster you can move toward a professional level.

And there was another unique once-in-a-lifetime treat that I highly valued! Because Irv is a still a very vital 80 years old, he is teaching something no one else is teaching today. He is teaching you how to write a film like they did in 1935 because that is how they still did it in the 1950's. He will teach you how to write for film in the classic craft of black and white television in the days of ""Playhouse-90"", ""Gun Smoke"", and the ""Twilight Zone"". I may disagree with him on marketing the FINAL form of the script in the Modern Era. But writing your FIRST DISCOVERY DRAFT for the Modern Era in ""Master Scenes"" will NOT get your Muse to come to you in terse essential film format. No matter what your level, put aside any arrogance and go with Irv's system in dedicated student humility and you are going to be VERY surprised at what happens.

Somewhere in the process my Muse very unexpectedly started to come to me in direct pure FILM FORMAT where I started to become a much more efficient inspired Medium for the conjured story. His exercises changed me. If you can get your Muse to start to come to you in direct film format and not merely compositional format you can get a COMPLETE discovery first draft in a highly unique and fresh voice much faster. The Muse will tell you in FILM not Junior year ""English Comp""!

And as every conventional film guru out there will tell you, the key to success as a writer in film is to get a COMPLETE DISCOVERY FIRST DRAFT even if it is terrible. Once you have a complete first draft on the page, you are then in a whole new World to shape your unique story to a professional level. But until you have a COMPLETE film story FIRST DRAFT expression of your idea you have nothing.

You do that often enough and you will perhaps eventually get to a ""Joe Eszterhas"" end of the creativity spectrum where you can write ""Basic Instinct"" in 13 days and sell it without much editing. But despite the lore, remember Joe Eszterhas studied with an OLD TIMER in Hollywood for two or three years to learn how to write in film. He then wrote several successful film scripts that got made. Despite what he says, he only hit the next level where your characters write the movie when he wrote ""Basic Instinct"". To write as a MEDIUM, you need as many disciplined working voyages into the film zone as possible over and over. Irv's exercise system will teach you how to accelerate the mystical Cosmic process through a step-by-step craft working method to being a very efficient switching left brain-right brain MEDIUM in film. This is the missing element that no one else is teaching!

How fortunate I have been to find Irv! Do not miss this chance to get to a much more advanced step-by-step complete working process that you have to then develop further to fit your own unique inspirational chops! Mine is now rapidly developing by integrating C.G. Jung's depth psychology into what the Muse shows me in Irv's fundamental craft processes.

I have been on this path for a long time. I thought I could ""swim"" in film. But it turns out I could only ""swim"" in my conventional film Gurus ""Master Scenes"" Olympic size swimming pool in the back yard of my mind. Irv made me grease up and get thrown into the English Channel in his restricted and tightly focused specific exercises! Writing out there is a lot different in the waves and the wind and the currents of the deep water! He was right there in the power boat with a megaphone along side me coaching me on my basic ""swimming"" form. The grace in his system is that you do not have to swim the full 23 miles of the English Channel and write 110-120 pages of a full film. You only have to swim five miles in a 20-25 page short film. Because in those 20-25 pages you are going to make ALL the fundamental mistakes you will make repeated over and over in 110-120 pages. I almost drowned. But at the end I made it back to the shore exhausted but happy with new aerobic power and muscle strength.

Irv then threw me a a big towel and handed me a cup of hot chocolate to revive me! I survived the swim and I am much, much stronger as a writer trying to develop the skills to be the author of one of those 5 films some day. I am now retaining Irv to be our Mentor on our current feature film screenwriting project. He also has that level of professional consultation available for your own material.

Having completed the full 10-Exercises over three months with Irv's private review phone consultations, I am developing much faster now and much more efficiently every time I go into the encounter with the Muse. It is the best money I have ever spent on this journey!

Do NOT miss this magnificent opportunity to rapidly and efficiently progress your craft skills! Run, do not walk, to get the $229 DVD Course and also sign up for the $500 personal e-Mail and phone session coaching on the full 10 Workbook Exercises. I just cannot say enough about how truly worthwhile Irv's Course is if you are serious about greatly improving your film writing ability to a much more developed, focused, and efficient level!",1385251200,,10840,4.637643378519291
8502311,5,B006OSVXOO,"I have attended at-least 6 different Screenwriting workshops and read tens of books before coming across Irv Bauer's 'Step-by-Step Screenwriting'.
A Screenwriter who just got optioned for a historical recommended it to me. I received the DVD with a hand written note by Irv Bauer wherein he
encouraged me to contact him for any further queries that I might have after going through his DVD. I am highly impressed with this endeavor of his.
Irv has a very personal way of teaching and it is unique to his own. I found it to be very contrary to the conventional workshops where they harp upon the
cliched and obvious suggestions about Plot Points, Inciting Incidents. Irv breaks the art of Screenwriting into a precise science and gives
a holistic view on Characters, Motives, Sub-Text, Dialogue and delves into the dimensions that differentiate a Screenwriting Project from other literary assignments. There is a also an integrated workbook that is very handy and it came along free in the package. Bottomline, I like my purchase and
highly recommend it.",1350950400,,1053,4.988636363636363
8502312,5,B006OSVXOO,"I was given this DVD by a friend of mine who knew I was interested in writing a movie script.  I have written a couple of plays, but have always more interested in film.  I knew I was going to have to look at the DVD as it had been a gift and a fairly costly one at that.  My friend had taken Bauer's Course so I was hoping this wasn't just a gimmick and a waste of my time.

I needn't have worried.  THIS IS THE REAL DEAL.  This is a full course in the craft of screen writing from soup to nuts.  It is aimed at the college and above level.  It is not for the lazy or the just curious.  The DVD was filmed during an actual course taken by five writers.  You progress through the course right along with them and actually feel part of the group.  They ask the questions right before you do.  Bauer's standards are high and he doesn't waste your time.  He gives you what you need right from the start.  He is a gifted communicator and has the intellect of a true writer not an academic.  His insights and arguments for the logic of each step are persuasive and right on.

Being so engrossed in each session, I was tempted to jump ahead but I made myself follow the proscribed progression of the ten sessions doing all ten exercises.  I ended up as Bauer promised with ""a full understanding of the process and a way to work"" on my own material.  My great bonus is that I now have my own personal trainer in the DVD that I can call on anytime.  If you are willing to work and are seriously interested in learning screen writing and can't come to New York to work with Irv Bauer in person, get his DVD.

Go for it!",1334880000,,1610,4.06687898089172
8502313,5,B006OSVXOO,"I took Irv's class last year and after a few months of writing on my own, I found that writing was not as easy as when I was taking the class with him.  So when this DVD came out, I immediately purchased it with the hope that it would help to reinforce what I had already learned.  Well, I was not disappointed one bit because to my surprise, this DVD set did far more than reinforce what I had learned, it was practically like taking the class once again!  The integrated workbook is a major plus and I can't put into words just how grateful I am as a writer to have this DVD set in my library.

If you're looking for a complete tutorial in screenwriting, then this DVD is the way to go, you will NOT be disappointed. It is very in-depth and covers everything you need to know to develop a screenplay, from character to final draft.",1329177600,,833,4.1875
8502314,5,B006OSVXOO,"I teach writing at a major university and am always looking for teaching and reference resources. I found a clip of Bauer on YouTube and bought this DVD set because I thought I might use bits of it in class to reinforce my own teaching. From what I've watched already (there are 5 1/2 hours of footage) the DVD is even more useful than I expected, and certainly much better than other similarly marketed instructional DVD's. It's absolutely not of the ""inspirational"" style (read: bland and useless writing platitudes) I've seen from some big name screenwriters. Rather than being simply a series of lectures about his own personal process, this is a masterclass in screenwriting. Together with its practical workbook of exercises, it apparently replicates Bauer's intensive multi-week courses. Whatever your level of experience or ability as a writer, I imagine you would get something valuable out of watching this.

Here are a couple of things I particularly liked. (1) Bauer's style: he's a charismatic speaker, but he's forceful when he needs to be. Watching him speak about writing, I felt that old familiar energy and will to write that one gets in the presence of a really astute, challenging teacher. (2) The DVD's are a comprehensive approach to screenwriting, and there's a real sense of the reasoning that binds the lessons together. This is more important than you might think: the integration of all the different elements is key to developing work that is cohesive and makes sense to a reader/viewer. (3) Bauer's approach is very practical and focused on the actual, everyday work of writing and creating. The lessons have been well organized too, so someone working by themselves could easily follow along step-by-step, but if you're struggling over something in particular, you can cut straight to the section you need. If I had a criticism, it would be that there is so much material here, it could be a lot to deal with for someone who just wants to dabble. That said, I'm really happy I bought it and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone serious about learning the craft of screenwriting.",1328140800,3,2107,4.9352112676056334
