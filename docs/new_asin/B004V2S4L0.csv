4481291,5,B004V2S4L0,"I have enjoyed my Medium Set greatly, I had missed several seasons and really enjoyed catching up. I think selling sets is a great idea. I would be interested if and when you decide to have a special on the series Bones",1314403200,3,219,4.238095238095238
4481292,2,B004V2S4L0,"There is no ENGLISH subtitle in season 1-5. The amazon sold an old dvd, of this series.
English subtitle only season 6-7. I need the subtitle, because my hearing not good.",1311552000,21,171,4.548387096774194
4481293,4,B004V2S4L0,"In 2005 a new series premiered on NBC that caught viewers fancy and tied into that desire to know what would happen in our futures if we could. Our fascination with psychics had been a long one going back to people like Edgar Cayce and Jeanne Dixon and moving forward at the time with John Edwards. This series renewed that interest and took as its basis the real life story of psychic Allison DuBois, a psychic who has aided the police on several occasions.

Patricia Arquette stars as DuBois in the series. Having grown up with these abilities but never applying them she tries to lead a normal life living in Phoenix with her husband Joe (Jake Weber) and their three daughters (Sofia Vassilieva, Maria Lark and Madison and Miranda Carabello). Allison becomes an intern working for Phoenix District Attorney Manuel Devalos (Miguel Sandoval) and while working for him has a dream about a murder case taking place in Texas. Now the problem is how does she convince the law enforcement people she works with that her visions are legitimate not to mention convincing her husband as well? Of course she does eventually get them to follow up on the clues she can provide and bad guys are caught. In the course of these events her abilities are accepted and she helps with more cases than ever.

The thing is if they never accepted her abilities there wouldnt have been a series worth of stories to tell and especially a series that lasted 7 seasons. And as a viewer you have to believe that the crime in Phoenix would become non-existent with the way the DA and his team rely on her abilities more and more often as it progresses. Plus they have to convince anyone in other police departments in other cities of her abilities when she dreams about those locations.

But this is television. We want to believe, we want to be entertained and we want to hope that someone out there like this can help put bad guys away behind bars. With the crime statistics in this country it would seem a never ending battle. But again that doesnt matter as long as the show can be entertaining and this one was.

Arquette comes off as an everyday mom who has had these visions all her life but who has finally found a way to apply them to help others. At the same time its not just helping solve crimes that goes on here. Shes making lunches for her kids, dropping them off at school and dealing with their day to day issues as well. She has to comfort her husband when the need arises and the pair here on screen present a loving couple that deals with the same issues we all do on a daily basis be it bills or bullies or gossip mongers. Arquettes performance here brings the character to life in all of these circumstances.

Weber does a great job as well as the beleaguered husband who at first doesnt believe and yet learns that what she claims is true. And with the dreams and visions she has being those involving murder and mayhem hes the solid base she needs to stay grounded. Webers portrayal of that supportive spouse is well done here. Even more so when it turns out that their three daughters also are in the midst of developing the same psychic connections.

While the series did well enough when it was on it was often up against some of the stiffest competition there was. It battled against the CBS juggernaut that was the CSI franchise in one form or another, the hottest shows on at the time. It later found itself up against LOST and the phenomena that that was and then LAW & ORDER: SVU but it carried on. The series lasted 5 seasons on NBC and then shifted over to CBS for 2 more seasons before finally calling it quits.

This box set contains all 7 seasons for fans to go back and enjoy all over again. And if you never got around to watching any more than occasional episode you can now join in from the start and follow through to the last episode. Fans of Arquette will love having them all in one spot on the shelf and those who have been picking them up in individual seasons can now sell those off and take up less space there with this comprehensive collection.",1517270400,,4069,4.43908969210174

There is a family to fall in love with and watch the children grow.  And, per the title, there is the supernatural to explore.  Closed minds would not enjoy that aspect, but for most people, this is an excellent series to watch with at least at least as old as teenaged family members.

4481303,5,B004V2S4L0,"This show has all my favorite things: crime drama with a mix of supernatural, but with heartwarming interactions between a great cast of characters. I would recommend it to anyone who likes shows such as Forensic Files, Unsolved Mysteries, The X-Files, and CSI.

The show follows the same formula in each episode: Allison Dubois, the main character, wakes from a disturbing dream detailing a violent crime. (9.9 times out of 10 someone has been murdered, but there are rare occasions in which she rescues a victim of a kidnapping.) She works for the District Attorney of Phoenix, relaying the contents of her dreams to him as he and Detective Scanlon help her solve the crimes.

If that's all the show were about, it might get too repetitive and bore you after a while. But the characters are all fleshed out and have their own issues and relationships that really keep your interest. The District Attorney thinks Allison is remarkable, but she often gets mixed messages from the dead, so he doesn't always trust her immediately. Detective Scanlon is a recovering drug addict, and he begins a relationship with the Deputy Mayor, who is often a thorn in the protagonists' sides. Allison and her husband, Joe, are my favorite characters; they have amazing chemistry, to the point where even their arguments are sexy. (lol!) And their three daughters each begin to display signs of psychic ability from young ages.

The acting is fantastic (I believe Patricia Arquette racked up multiple Emmys for Medium, but everyone is great), the plots always keep you guessing and despite all being about murder, there's a lot of variety to the crimes. Allison's husband, Joe, is a scientist and often the voice of reason, and his career takes many different directions that always make you feel invested in this family. Is he going to get laid off, or promoted? How will he handle becoming his boss's new favorite? Will he quit his job to start up his own company? How will he handle sexual harassment when women come onto him at work? Allison's involvement in grisly murders is very troubling to him; will he stray from their marriage?

This is definitely one of my all-time favorite shows. I can pop in any disc of the DVD collection at any time and enjoy it. My only complaint is the case for the Complete Series DVDs. It's really cheap (better for the environment, likely, though) so a ton of discs go into one flimsy holder. Just FYI.",1494806400,,2425,4.780429594272077

what I am gonna have to do now is probably rip the DVDs to MP4 or AVI files and then download the srt files from www.tvsubtitles.net and just watch these off of my computer so my family, whose first language is Japanese, can understand this better.

She always more concerned about her self interests and never seems to deign to see her husband's pov. I spent most of the time wanting to smack this woman in the face.

4481356,5,B004V2S4L0,"One of the great imaginative series that marked the beauty of 1990s television moving us beyond car chases, corporate greed, pettiness, and reality TV. The female lead character is often harsh and always narcissistic, but her heart's in the right place. It certainly adds flavor to the story--just as the family that loves her is always her salvation--in that living from day to day sense.  And dead people are always so interesting--at least in spirit form (certainly more believable according to dynamic theory and more appealing than walking rotting corpses).  The actors were more than adept in creating a reality out of a difficult subject--and making it very real to us through the mystery/crime solving genre.

Perhaps the most appealing thing to me about this series is how involved the family was in all of it, not just the husband and wife, but the children. The usual white lies and secret keeping were dispensed with as early as the children demonstrated they could handle the full truth, making truth among the family members (and beyond) the very best the series had to offer.  Truth never improved anything in the outer world--that seemed to be set as it is--but truth gave great strength to every member of the family--enough for a whole lifetime.",1408233600,13,1263,4.943396226415095

Liked it so much, I felt it was more cost effective to get the whole pack instead of buying these one at or two at a time. Good premise and creative stories and keeping it real. It is as much a story about a family as a crime show. Keeps it diverse. The second season had the stories com from different angles in the way it was written and shot. One episode was done twice. The second they did the first HD 3D on television. I have never seen a 3D movie in my whole life. It definitely added to the show.",1385942400,3,577,3.9741379310344827

4481374,5,B004V2S4L0,"Hello...!!
Rod Serling and Alfred Hitchcock would have been proud to have their names on this most strange, scary and imaginative show. The writing is absolutely brilliant and keeps viewers off-balance until the very last, chair-clinging moment. Full blown characterizations, thanks to the great actors AND great writing! I loved each and every episode, EXCEPT the final....which was, by Medium standards,even more odd and convoluted than ever. But, I have to reluctantly admit,  it was in keeping with the series as a whole.
 Many of us faithful viewers wrote(emailed) to protest Medium's cancellation and low-and-behold it was brought back to life on another network! Brilliant! The viewers spoke and(finally) someone listened. Thanks for a truly memorable series.

4481381,4,B004V2S4L0,"If you like medium you will probably get this no matter what the reviews say.

I only have a couple issues

1. there are no subtitles, which I like to use when listening at low volumes (it is close captioned, but you have to turn that on through the TV and of course it has the usual poor quality mis spellings, typos and sometimes ""too fast to read flashing"" that is becoming more and more rampant in CC these days, unlike true subtitles which are usually accurate)

2. the first couple seasons do not have the ""play all"" option, it doesnt show up until a couple seasons in, a minor nuisance but worth noting

3. was not impressed with the menus, selecting an episode sometimes starts the episode or sometimes asks if you want commentary, its a multi level multi button process to navigate through after each episode when all you wanted to do was hit ""play"" and let a disc run for a few hours

4. many of the disc holders were broken, have to be very careful opening disc cases so the discs don't fall out. so far they have all been playable as they don't have anywhere to fall to inside the case (they don't seem to shift around even if the spindle is broken), but they are at risk of hitting the floor as soon as the case is open. i'll probably track down some replacement slim cases at some point, but they seem to be hard to find that can hold 2 discs, most i see are 1 disc replacement slim cases

anyway, packaging issues and menu quality aside the actual series is decent (obviously or i wouldnt have bought it). sound and picture quality are about what you would expect and as far as i can tell are as good or better than the original broadcast quality.

if you are only a passing fan you might want to just pick this up season by season and stop when you get bored. personally id only seen this off and on when it was on tv, so getting the series was an attempt to catch up and see it all in order. after 3 seasons im finding it a bit repetitive, ill probably take a break and come back to it in a couple of weeks. im still happy with it though as the price i paid was only around $70 (amazon gold box deal). im not sure id bother to pay full price for it (but im that way about a lot of things, so take that with a grain of salt)",1316390400,34,2240,4.112128146453089

This review is low because the packaging is AWFUL. I received this as a gift from my sister and only the first 4 seasons came and they were scratched to crap. The last disc of season 4 has a thing to pop into, but because of its placement, you can't close the container without it popping out. My sister exchanged it for a new one and the new one doesn't even have a thing for the last disc of season 4 to pop into. It and several other discs are scratched to crap like the previous set.

I highly recommend purchasing the seasons individually instead.",1517875200,,637,4.3
