7223181,5,B00YOJIB0E,"Great idea, some great moments acting wise and I'm sold on anything with Danny Glover as ""God""! Could have done with a little less swearing... but a fun little film with supernatural elements.",1441584000,,192,4.848484848484849
7223182,2,B00YOJIB0E,"""The battle line between good and evil runs through the heart of every man."" Six people are involved in a bank heist where one wrong move could be deadly. The criminals and the police all make strategic moves in hopes of ending the standoff and coming out on top. The longer the standoff goes on the greater the chance of disaster. This is a movie that had such a neat element to it that I thought this could be really neat. Essentially Glover and Jones play God and the Devil. Every move they make on the board affects how the events unfold. Unfortunately the idea was much much better than the movie. The movie really ran out of steam pretty quickly and became something that was way to slow and generic to stay focused on. Overall, a movie with a great idea that ultimately did nothing with it. Very disappointing and hard to stay focused on. The type of movie you forget as you are watching. I give this a C-.",1441584000,,913,4.345029239766082

7223188,1,B00YOJIB0E,"Really? Why all the unnecessary cursing (as if cursing is necessary). Lack of script, bad acting, lost story and uninteresting. I wish I would have read the rating first. Absolutely horrible movie.",1442620800,,197,5.1875
7223189,1,B00YOJIB0E,"OMG had to be one of the worst movies ever. If I can save even one person from spending any money on this it will be worth it.
Bad story line and worse acting. It was comical at the amount of cussing in the dialogue.",1442534400,6,216,3.8222222222222224
7223190,1,B00YOJIB0E,"This is a thoroughly bad movie.  The acting (despite having talent like Danny Glover, Vinnie Jones, and Sean Astin) is horrific:  the dialogue is mostly profanity, the big names don't seem to know what they're supposed to be doing in any given scene, and the characters are extremely thin caricatures.  The action is laughably bad, like a high school film club tried to make a Rambo movie but didn't have any budget or know-how (at one point, Astin is looking through a sniper rifle scope and trying to act cool...but has forgotten to take the lens caps off the scope.  Not making this up.)  The central metaphor of a chess match between good and evil is mangled and then discarded at the end.  At every level, this film is amateurish and childish.  Unlike Sharknado or The Room, there isn't even any fun to be had about how awful this flick is.

Final Verdict:  Even for $3, skip this, unless you happen to work for Mystery Science Theater, at which point skip it anyway, since the profanity alone is going to make it un-riffable.",1442188800,12,1193,4.8088235294117645
7223191,2,B00YOJIB0E,"The film opens with a bank robbery gone bad and two guys playing chess. It then goes back to ""one day earlier.""  We now get to meet the characters, unfortunately they seemed stiff and unrealistic. Sean Astin plays a priest who is also a paid hitman for God and cites biblical verse, but alas, after seeing Samuel L. Jackson do it, nobody does it better. During the bank robbery, where we now are introduced to a few of the characters, there is a chess game going on between Elohim (Danny Glover) and Lu (Vinnie Jones) for dominion over everything for all time. As the game goes back and forth, so does the robbery, sort of, but it wasn't overly apparent.

If you are going to make an Ingmar Bergman film, on a modern JOB, do it right. The plot and dialogue wasn't that good. Sean Astin reciting biblical verse while aiming a gun wasn't convincing with a dry delivery. (I blame the director for that. I respect Sean too much.) The chess match going back and forth with each man smiling with every move grew old. Lu had trouble with the Queen's pawn power opening and knew better to even wager at that point. I did like the bar/men's room scene and would have liked to have seen more scenes like that, but unfortunately they had dry characters they needed to introduce. And you would think the lord God himself would come up with a more clever name for a girl with a Katana (Katrina Law)  other than Katana. Great concept. Bad execution.

8718619,1,B00YOJIB0E,Way too much swearing.  Really bad acting.  No point.  The only reason we finished it was because my husband said it was so bad he really needed to see the ending (thinking the ending would somehow make the movie all of a sudden make sense).

B-level movies in the 80s have higher level in acting, sound, plot, and everything.  The trailer is ok and you really think that between Vinnie Jones and Danny Clover could get some ""holy"" magic going on.
