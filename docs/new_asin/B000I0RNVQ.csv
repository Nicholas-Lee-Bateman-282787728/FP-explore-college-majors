2649453,5,B000I0RNVQ,"After travelling 3500 miles to see this film for the first time I've now booked tickets for the UK premiere in Edinburgh (a mere 350 miles).

If you're lucky enough to be in the US when this opens you HAVE to go see it.

It is that funny...",1153094400,3,240,3.9791666666666665
2649454,4,B000I0RNVQ,"First,  despite not having seen the movie, I think there is a reasonable chance that it will be at least entertaining.  However, despite how good it may turn out to be, it will pale in comparision to the reviews of John Q. Public (scroll down).  Click on all his reviews and notice the bitter ramblings of a painfully lonely man.  It's like Andy Rooney on crack. You will not be disappointed.",1152230400,2,392,4.47887323943662
2649455,5,B000I0RNVQ,"I have to agree with ""Boss Fan"" in his desire to counteract the ridiculous and pointless bashing of a movie that isn't even out yet. If ""John Q. Public"" doesn't like the earlier films of Kevin Smith, fine. He's entitled to his opinion. If he would like to write reviews of each of those movies on their respective pages, also fine, although I hope he would explain what specifically he did not like and back up his opinions with thoughful, logical arguments.

That being said, I really like all of Kevin's past movies. I understand why some people don't like them and why none of them have been enormously successful. It's a mighty difficult tightrope to walk trying to balance poop and [...] jokes with intelligent, thoughful commentary on the world around us, but Kevin does a pretty impressive job of managing the feat. He's tackled the nature of male/female relationships, the profundity of God, religion and the Catholic Church, and the stuggle between single parenthood and career. All the while, he's managed to make me laugh like hell.

Is ""Clerks II"" any good? I don't know yet, but you can bet I'll be seeing it opening weekend. And if Kevin Smith's track record means anything at all, it will be riotously funny with maybe a little something to think about after it's over (even if it's only whether contract employees building the second Death Star were supporting a tyranical ruler and deserved to die or they were innocent victims of a war they had nothing to do with).

While waiting to decide for yourself if ""Clerks II"" is a good movie or not, check out Kevin Smith's other movies: ""Clerks,"" ""Mallrats,"" ""Chasing Amy,"" ""Dogma,"" ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,"" and ""Jersey Girl."" I highly recommend all of them.",1152144000,6,1729,4.756666666666667
2649456,5,B000I0RNVQ,I've seen it twice and I laughed just as much the second time as I did the first time.  Kevin Smith is a comic genius.  A must see.,1152144000,3,131,3.642857142857143
2649457,5,B000I0RNVQ,"There are a lot of reasons to like ""Clerks II,"" but I found a lot of personal reasons to love it.  I don't want to read too much into a movie that is essentially a fiesta of explicit language and graphic descriptions of sexual acts, as well as the usual bodily function and pop culture jokes.  But as usual with Kevin Smith's films, the movie also has a heart beneath its fanboy/fratboy-humored surface.  The movie is hilarious on the same level as all of Smith's films that cover this territory, but I also left the theatre and went home and immediately e-mailed a friend who I had seen the original with some 12 years ago when we were just a couple of 15 or 16 year-old punks hanging out at the small local theatre, and later staying up late on the weekends watching and re-watching this and quoting every line.  I even worked both as a clerk in a convenience store and a video store, respectively, in high school.  Like Smith I was a movie buff stuck in a crappy job dealing with crappy customers.  I grew up faster than the clerks in these movies did, but the message at the end of this sequel about friendship and still needing to find one's place in life should resonate with everyone no matter what kind of success you have achieved in life.  Are you doing what you love, surrounded by those you love?  That is truly finding one's place in life.

To my friend I wrote:  ""it got me thinking about watching the first film and all the s**t we were into and up to back then.  Like the first movie, the sequel has a heart and a message of friendship and uncertain futures beneath its raunchy exterior which makes it work on several levels - and also get idiots like me looking back, pining for younger days. In the beginning, the movie may have been conceived simply as a cash in on a popular title from a director whose career has been idling as of late, but it's a can't miss with these characters, whatever the intentions, and as such the film is surprisingly moving in the way it catches up with them a decade-plus later.  Because, of course, it is a decade-plus later for us as well.  I don't want to make it sound too heavy or special (it is probably neither), it is first and foremost a raunchy comedy (and raunchier than most at that), but for two guys who sortta worshiped at its feet for a time, it kinda is special, and makes for a great life metaphor.""

That is the great unexpected part of ""Clerks II,"" but if you are going into this blind, without any need to be taken aback, or any fanfare for Smith or the first film, but just want to laugh, the other great part of ""Clerks II"" is you will laugh.  My, how you will laugh!

The first great thing you will notice in this film is, like the original, ""Clerks II"" has a talky, authentic feel to it, much more so than most Hollywood movies - and even more so than most movies in which critics praise them for sounding as though they are real people talking.  I don't know about any of you, but I'd be more likely to get into a conversation about my sex life, or an argument over movies, with my close friends and sound like these guys doing it before talking about any of the stuff that was discussed in, say, ""The Hours.""  These characters sound like real, everyday people and talk about a lot of the - often stupid, but often very serious - stuff that real people, at least in this day and age and in this age group and situation, talk about.  Every scene is not always as brilliantly written as others, but you can at least relate to whatever they are talking about.

The movie does often go a little far - and I don't mean in terms of language - or 'how dare they say that' stuff (I loved Randall's quest to ""take back"" the phrase `porch monkeys'""), but there is, for example, a bachelor party scene that involves a donkey (you can fill in the blanks).  This too would be fine, but Smith overplays his hand here.  It goes on way too long, and it's not really as funny, no matter what the length, as Smith thinks it is.  It's not that it's too gross (though it does make even the most non-conservative of Smith's fans as uncomfortable as he would probably like it to); it's just that it is one joke stretched beyond its means.  Especially when you sortta see the joke coming way back when Randall has his first face to face with the guy who brings the donkey in.

But that is a minor quibble and there are few other examples like it to really complain about.  It is simply a matter of ""Clerks II"" being better when it pushes boundary's with its dialogue rather than its visuals (Jay's classic ""Silence of the Lambs"" scene notwithstanding), as are all Smith's films.  The visual stuff tends to relay on lazy gross-out gags, where the smart dialogue mines real laughs from real situations.

I would like to have seen more fun/conflict with the customers that come into Mooby's.  The two or three scenes that do take advantage of this are among the best and funniest in the film (""LOTR"" VS ""Star Wars,"" the porch monkey thing, Jason Lee as a fellow high school grad turned millionaire).  But to make up for that we get great interplay between the two clerks and a third addition to the gang named Elias, who has so many great moments - almost all of his screen time - that listing them here is simply perfunctory.  You just have to see it.

Ditto this movie.",1151971200,,5320,4.337033299697276

2649459,2,B000I0RNVQ,"huge fan of the original 'clerks'. it's my 2nd or 3rd fave film, all-time. i consider it the quintessential gen x movie. that said, i really wanted to like, if not, love, this movie but i found it painfully forced and just lazy. i dig kevin smith- i think he's a straight up dude and i like how he's budget conscious in regards to making movies. that said, i can't say i'm much of a fan of most of his work since clerks. it feels like he blew his load, so to speak, with his first film, right out of the gate.

smith puts dante and randal back as clerks (this time for fast food) a good 10 yrs later, which seemed lazy. i would've had them in middle management or salesman jobs. would've had randal as a 2 or maybe 3 time divorcee with a couple of kids and drowning in child support. maybe he and dante have to move in together, a la 'the odd couple'. i just didn't like that they were completely stuck in time for the past dozen years. it didn't seem realistic. and most of the jokes were painful and forced. the whole donkey show thing was cringe-worthy and just not very funny.

i also hate that smith has ruined what was originally a great character in silent bob. he's always mugging for the camera now and completely ruined his own character. who does that?? it seems like smith has lost his mojo and i don't feel good saying that because i loved his first film so much and i do think he's a good guy, personally speaking. the ONE redeeming thing about this film, imo, was smith casting rosario dawson, who just absolutely lights up the screen. rosario pretty much makes everything better. i also don't get how clerks II averages 4.5 stars and the original averages 4 stars. that's completely baffling to me.",1499040000,,1714,4.336448598130841

2649497,4,B000I0RNVQ,"Kevin Smith has lost some of his appeal lately, as I think this was the last really good film he did.  It shows a maturity and an actual progression to the story that put him on the map.  Is it perfect?  No, but it is pretty damn close.

As usual, the extras are worth viewing and are highly entertaining, but the film itself is why you should buy this.  You need to see the first one, however, to get the full impact of the sequel.  (I know some people hate that the first Clerks was black and white, but you'll be fine if you watch it.  Nothing bad will happen to you, trust me.)

2649712,5,B000I0RNVQ,"Clerks 2 starts and ends with the message of ignore what everybody says and do what you want. Dante and Randall are two sides of the same coin and are different points on the message. Randall doesn't care what anybody says to a point of comic ridiculousness which leads him to try and bring an old racial slur out of the past and give it new meaning and buying Dante a donkey show as a farewell gift whereas Dante is finally getting what he always wanted (or thought he wanted) just to find out on the eve of his big move and last day at Mooby's that the woman he works with is pregnant from a one night stand they had weeks previously. Through the course of the movie we find out that Randall does care about something (his friendship with Dante) and Dante learns to buck what he believes everyone is expecting him to do. It's a fantastic movie told in the classic Kevin Smith style and if you haven't seen it, buy it. If you've seen it, buy it. No matter what, you should buy this movie (and clerks) as its a required part of any movie collection.",1435968000,,1049,4.25

2649897,5,B000I0RNVQ,"In Clerks II the cast of Jay and Silent Bob, Dante and Randal are reunited by Kevin Smith's (Silent Bob) writing and directing.  After the fire at the convenience store, we find Dante and Randal now in a McJob.  Enter new characters Becky, the manager, and Elias, the other crewmember who Randal loves goading owing to his religious upbringing and his love of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy.

This episode, at least shot in color, has more going for it than the original.  The actual writing is a little more edgy and the characters are far more fleshed out.  It feels as though Kevin just might have had one of those McJobs in his past the way it feels all so familiar.

Clerks II is definitely more involved and less haphazard than the original.  That's not to say the original is no good because, quite frankly, it too is a scream.  They are just different.  Clerks II is more ""grown up"".",1417132800,,890,4.444444444444445

The new characters are perfect,  and the cameos are hysterical. Obviously, the humor is sophomoric at times, but still funny nonetheless. Definitely not a movie for the easily offended.

2649904,4,B000I0RNVQ,"In the years since Clerks he has become a husband (he married Ms. Schwalbach in 1999) and father, as well as something of a Hollywood player, and a glimmer of tolerant adult wisdom shines through the scatology and willful immaturity. Clerks II has a dirty mind, but its heart is pure Randals jokes at Eliass expense are cruel (and very funny), but they also point toward the buried spring of pathos that bubbles ever closer to the surface as the movie wanders toward its end. Randal and Dante, after all, are no longer feckless 20-somethings. They are a few years into their 30s, at an age where a lack of ambition can start to look cowardly and pathetic, less a form of resistance to social norms than a sign of psychic defeat. Clerks II is rated R (Under 17 requires accompany parent or adult guardian). It has abundant obscenity and crude sexual humor.

2649966,5,B000I0RNVQ,"This is my tv.com review.

Hands down the best reason this movie is so funny is Randall. He is the best character in this movie, saying everything on his mind.

My favorite part of the movie is when Randal rips apart Lord of the Rings so hard, he made a fanboy literally puke.

Jay and Silent Bob also make their triumphant return and are still up to their crazy antics.

Dante is still the straight man of the group but is now engaged and moving to Florida. His fianc, Emma, however does not get him at all and thinks it's cute when he tries to think. Meanwhile, Dante and Randall's manager, Becky is shown to be in love with Dante and likes him for who he is.

Despite having his twisted sense of humor, deep down, Randall is actually devastated that Dante is leaving and at the end of the movie, tells Dante he's his best friend. The movie ends with and Randall buying Quickstop and RST video as their own bosses with Becky married to Dante.",1412467200,,944,4.3107344632768365

2650023,1,B000I0RNVQ,"A wimpy and sentimental color detour from the first movie.  The porn references and donkey jokes hide whipped male characters with low self esteem and a dependance on women to validate them. The core theme surrounds under achieving and staying in one's small pond with a fantasy that the hot Rosario Dawson's of the world are attracted to this shallow life.  Overall, the movie celebrates ""settling"" and promotes a romantic myth that quirky loser guys are actually cool with emotional depth when in reality they are simply quirky and losers.

Sorry Kevin, you might have married a hot chick in real life, but first you had to leave New Jersey, push your boundaries and make some money.  You reached a little higher than simply getting a girl knocked up and re-opening a hole in the wall convenience store.",1407888000,3,805,4.811594202898551

2650033,1,B000I0RNVQ,"Clerks was a groundbreaking tale of a young person reaching the first crossroads of picking a direction in life. The protagonist was buttresseded by an interesting cast of supporting characters and supplemented, to no small extent, by a stream of amusing eccentrics eddying in and out of the convenience store where he worked. This amalgam produces dialogue that borders on philosophical and a skein of entertaining incidents.

Fast forward to the approach of midlife and the only thing that carries forward is the central cast of characters. The dialogue and gags appear to be targeted to a low range adolescent mentality and the stream of droll bit players has dried up, narrowing the focus to the core characters who have all inexplicably remained frozen in time since the prior opus. One? Quite possible. Two? Maybe. All? Give us a break.

The only bright spot is the addition of a bona fide performer, Rosario Dawson. Like an EMT, she breathes a scintilla of life into this DOA.

The plot, dialogue and gags are vapid copies of the original, as are the characters. In failing to progress, they have fallen behind, which appears to be the allegory of their creator.",1407196800,4,1169,4.893939393939394

2650074,4,B000I0RNVQ,"This decade later follow-up to the original Clerks movie may not carry the same indie cred that its predecessor, but it holds its own on a comedic film level. Unlike the original, this movie is more traditional in its ability to take the story to various locations thematically and literally - Clerks l was filmed in one location only. It is full of raunchy jokes and the signature Kevin Smith brand of humor we've come to know from his previous works with Jay and Silent Bob characters. The soundtrack is great too!",1403654400,,516,4.619565217391305

My favorite is ""Jay's"" takeoff on Buffalo Bill - you'll know it when you see it. In typical lighthearted fashion, a financial deus ex machina saves the day, and everybody lives happily ever after. Even though we all know how these movies end, it's a romp and a fun way to kill some time.",1402358400,,410,4.337662337662338
2650086,5,B000I0RNVQ,"The first Clerks has a special place in my heart. I grew up with it. It was the first movie I saw where everyone swore like sailors. It was the ultimate symbol of disobedience against authority to me at a young age.

Obviously, as I'm older, more relaxed, and have made my peace with authority, I was in the right mindset to revisit this universe with these great characters. I thought the journey of discovery these two idiots go through was great, especially me being a guy in his early 30s in LA wondering if I'm on the right path as well.

Kevin has certainly grown as a film maker and I liked all the fanboy stuff in here, the running into people from high school, and even the musical number to Jackson 5. It's fun; plain and simple.

2650109,5,B000I0RNVQ,"I really do feel ashamed.  Shame on me!

I've never seen the first Clerks so I have no idea what that one's like, but Clerks II is without a doubt one of the more offensive comedies out there.  For about 80% of it, you will hear nothing but strong sexually related jokes one after another.  It's about a group of immature 30-something year old clerks that work at a fast food restaurant that unquestionably refuse to grow up, haha!  Well I guess I'm a little guilty in that respect too.  I may listen to and review mature music but the reality is that I'm almost as immature as the characters in this movie.

Anyway, there are a few moments of sensible comedy such as when the one clerk wants to tie the knot with his perky girlfriend and needs dancing advice for the wedding from his boss at the restaurant (who's a hottie herself).  Expect a bunch of guest stars such as Wanda Sykes in a hilarious scene/racial discussion while ordering her meal at the front desk, and the guy from My Name Is Earl who has a picklish nickname, lol.  All the robot or Hobbit talk is too nerdy for me to understand but I'm sure some people out there get it.

Please remember- this is NOT AT ALL recommended for children.  Only people 18 or older should be watching this.  The sexual humor is about as strong as it gets, trust me.  And these clerks actually discuss the sexual stuff in very lengthy detail.  You've been warned.  As for me, well, I guess I'll have to get over the fact that sometimes I like some of the most tasteless immature humor and blush as I have to live with myself.  Clerks II reaches such an absurd level of ridiculousness that it's no wonder the world is just so crazy.  I hope that donkey doesn't have a hiney troll. :)",1400198400,,1728,4.333333333333333

You can easily see that there was a much bigger budget for this movie, but it didn't quite capture the magic of the first film.  It had some funny moments and the dialogue was pretty good, but overall it was an average movie.  I did enjoy it though, as I do with most Kevin Smith movies.

2650221,1,B000I0RNVQ,"Didn't bother looking at the movie after the first five minutes. Not sure what put us off. Language maybe. They say the title of a book is the most important, because more people will read it than anything else. Then the first sentence is very important, if someone is captured there then they will likely continue to read. Well movies aren't that different, and the five minutes did not give us the feeling it was worthwhile going through the rest.",1396396800,,449,4.625
2650222,4,B000I0RNVQ,"Clerks II is a nice look back at Dante & Randall, who in turn look forward to the future. It's about growing up and moving on, but not quite in the ways we expect. And of course, it's about friendship.

Give it a shot if you're a fan of the first film, or of Kevin Smith in general. I know he's wanted to ""expand"" his directorial output, but I think he does his best work with the characters and surroundings he, and all of us, are most familiar with.",1396310400,,451,4.067415730337078

2650295,2,B000I0RNVQ,"After being treated to the hilariously funny original ""Clerks,"" I found Clerks II to be a big disappointment. The opening scene was great, but after that it all seemed to go downhill. For starters, there was no clear plot or purpose to the story line. I felt no empathy for the characters; even in a mindless comedy, it helps when you can relate in some small way to the plight or purpose of the film's stars. Just didn't happen for me this time around.",1393977600,,453,4.404761904761905

2650300,4,B000I0RNVQ,I loved the first Clerks 37 was one of the funniest parts in that movie.  If you don't know what I mean just get clerks and wait to they talk about 37 and if you don't laugh then you don't need to watch this.  Kevin Smith pushes it again to see how far he can.  The movie was great this time all taken place in a restaurant made it even funnier.,1393891200,,345,3.8309859154929575

2650309,5,B000I0RNVQ,Gotta love Kevin Smith. This is a cult classic that just plain made me happy when I watched it. I was worried that a sequel would be stupid but then I remembered that its supposed to be.,1392249600,,186,4.054054054054054

2650314,5,B000I0RNVQ,Kevin Smith brought back all of the laughs and awkward moments that we saw in the first Clerks. Think of Clerks mixed with Chasing Amy and Mallrats. Great movie for those that want to laugh.,1389139200,,190,4.457142857142857
2650315,5,B000I0RNVQ,I know this movie got a lot of hate but I thought it was hysterical.  It may not be as witty funny as other Kevin Smith movies and there is probably more immature humor in this movie but to me funny is funny and this was funny.,1389139200,,227,3.8297872340425534

2650318,5,B000I0RNVQ,"great price for this DVD.  There are a lot of debates about Clerks I vs Clerks II - they're 2 different movies, both hilarious.  The first was more groundbreaking funny.  The second is just side splitting funny.  It's a little more crude than the first, but I will watch both and laugh my behind off!",1385942400,,300,4.4
2650319,4,B000I0RNVQ,Nice 2 disc set if you can get it at a good price. Sequel to the cult classic Kevin Smith movie.,1385942400,,96,3.619047619047619

2650321,4,B000I0RNVQ,"Not as good as the original, but it still has its extremely funny moments. They do kind of go for a few more serious moments and try to make a more coherent plot, but it seems slightly forced. They should have focused more time focusing on the monologues and conversations that made the first movie so great.

If you liked the first or other Kevin Smith movies, you'll probably like this one. It's the same vulgar humor that he's known for and he delivers well once more. It's a little more surprising and offensive than the first one, so prepare for some moments that will really surprise you.

Still a very funny movie, but don't expect something that lives quite up to the first one.",1383091200,,686,4.48

2650345,4,B000I0RNVQ,"OK, if you know Kevin Smith's work, you know that it can be perverse.  He revels in crude jokes.  Clerks was full of them -- but Clerks also had a quirky, indie film sensibility about it, as well as interesting characters.  Clerks II loses the quirky, indie film sensibility; it feels more polished -- which, for some, will make it less special.  However, if you liked Dante and Randal and want to see what happened to them, this is worth seeing.  Besides the perverse, Smith is not afraid of weaving in situations and dialog that can touch your heart.  Kevin Smith writes/directs the sweetest perverted movies you'll ever see.",1372032000,,627,4.706422018348624

2650347,5,B000I0RNVQ,"As a rabid Kevin Smith fan, I've seen all of his movies and seen him and Jason Mewes in person twice.  Kevin Smith is one of the most intelligent, insightful screenwriter/directors of our time.  My son introduced his work to me and I'm a 52 year old mom and therefore appreciate the subtle innuendos and messages laced throughout his films.  Vulgarity works in his films plus keeps my sons entertained but I explain the true meaning behind each film after we see them.  This movie is not for the easily offended or narrow minded and I must say that, in my opinion, it would be wise to use your judgment based on your child's maturity level before you let them see it. Watch it first, then decide.  But, for our family anyway, it's priceless!",1370908800,,741,4.5

2650359,4,B000I0RNVQ,I bought Clerks II to see the sequel to the movie Clerks and I enjoyed it.

I recommend it to anyone who's a fan of Kevin Smith's movies.,1364774400,,306,4.258620689655173
2650360,4,B000I0RNVQ,"Yeah... now with color and as insightful as Clerks, this sequel tells the story of the same bunch of losers going thru life serving people. Sometimes you like them, sometimes you don't, but they always hate you.

The movie is definitely worth the $10 I paid for this gift set and it comes with quite a bit more.  I paid $4 for the name tag, and $4 for the cup, straw and lid. The reason for my purchase was to own the visor.  I ordered one once for $15 but they were out of stock.

I loved the first Clerks movie and was excited to watch this on, but the entire movie was immensity disappointing. They completely changed and ruined all of the characters from the first ie Randall and Donnie. Randall is no longer the care free youth who understands the significance of his station and life and acts accordingly now. They turned him into no more than a jerk and a bully. Rather than being crude in a funny way, he is simply nasty now. And Donnie, he became a low life in this one. Their first was great, but this is exactly what it seams like an attempt of two middle aged men to reclaim their past fame. If you liked the first one at all, you will not like this one save for Jay and Silent Bob's bits. They are the only reason this sequel did not receive a 1 star review.",1319587200,,936,4.176795580110498

2650404,3,B000I0RNVQ,"Do we really need a 2 disc collection with Clerks II? I remember watching the making of Clerks II and other special features about the movie. Kevin Smith sure likes to talk about how he wrote his script in Las Vegas on his laptop within a week. Granted, Kevin Smith is not known for making big budget disasters. He seems content on making low budget, goofball offensive comedies like Clerks.

His first Clerks was an awakening about reality with a largely unknown cast of characters. Some of whom were friends and relatives of Smith's like his mother who played the milk maid. In this sequel, Dante and Randal's relationship (a platonic friendship and nothing more) is tested when Dante announces that he's moving to Florida with his hot fiance, Emma. In the day of a life at Mooby's, Randal has a final going away party with interesting results.

Now I don't mind a two disc collection if the film had been considered a classic or revolutionary. Sometimes, I think the two disc collection here is over-rated. Kevin Smith does love his fans and appreciates them but I think he talks and smokes too much. He's not daring enough as a film-maker in order to grow.

This film showed an ending and resolution to Clerks but Kevin Smith needs to grow as a director and writer in his own way. He likes complete control which is something that keeps him away from the studios. He likes his creativity but he needs to grow and search for the next project. He has made good movies like Chasing Amy, Jersey Girl, and even Dogma (one of my favorites).

This two disc collection would be great for all Kevin Smith fans but I would have liked to have seen some of the original players like Marilyn Ghigliotti and those who appeared in the first film again.",1312243200,,1741,4.57051282051282

2650418,5,B000I0RNVQ,"Blue humor abounds in this Kevin Smith classic, but it's all in the talk.  There are no obscene sight gags (except a pantsless Jason Mews dance which had me in stitches) and the crude humor is almost entirely verbal.  By most people's standards, this is not considered a gross-out comedy.  If you can't stomach dirty talk, then your sensitivity might be too great to sit through this movie.

Despite the off-color hijinks, this movie has a poignant message about the life one choses to live, the reasons for those choices, and the value and importance of friendship.  This movie has more heart in it than most other genres of film, making it an unlikely place to find insight and to learn anything of value, but that's exactly what happens.",1298937600,2,740,4.705426356589148
2650419,4,B000I0RNVQ,"In Clerks II, Kevin Smith proves that lightning doesn't strike twice. Clerks was a movie that didn't rely on anything but intelligence and a skewed sense of the world to succeed and I thought it succeeded so brilliantly that I felt it was one of the funniest, shrewdest movies I'd ever seen. I don't mean to say that Clerks II is dumb, but it relies more on the American Pie type of gross-out dumb humor and mocking humor than I was expecting. I can't say that I thought Clerks II was tremendously funny because I'm not a huge fan of fart-joke humor, and stuff like putting flies on a hamburger, or urine in a soft drink is not what I consider well developed humor or clever, well-written jokes, but more along the lines of what I'd expect from Beavis and Butthead.

The overall charm of Clerks was, for me, just watching two guys talking about life, while trying to live it, and who happened to bear an uncanny resemblance to me. That charm wasn't lost in Clerks II, it was just unfortunately mixed in with a little too much cheap humor. I did have a little bit of a difficult time with Dante and Randal still being in the same exact place they were ten years ago, but it wasn't difficult for me to overlook that, since, well, I pretty much am, too.

All in all, while there are some failings to Clerks II, and while the movie had a lot of things I could pick on, it put a smile on my face, it made me feel good and I did enjoy it and really, what more is a movie supposed to do? Randal is still the same character he was in Clerks and it's with him that the charm of the movies lies. Long Live Randal!

Minor complaint though. It's just that the ideas are stale and the dialogue does not have the wit and bite of the original or Mallrats or even Chasing Amy (overrated too). It's all just too contrived and forced, and the soundtrack is immensely boring. Only saving grace in this is Jay's role and a Smashing Pumpkins song in the soundtrack. The fact that this has an average of a 4 star review is an incredibly telling indicator of the mentality of the morons and losers that lap up this drivel.

2650426,5,B000I0RNVQ,"When ""Clerks II"" premiered in June 2006, I was living in Wausau, central Wisconsin.  A big city, but with very few movie theatres nearby.  The screening room was about half-full.  Throughout the movie, the audience very rarely erupted into a full laugh.  There were chuckles here, some laughs there, some gasps there... but aside from a sexual sequence that defies description, the audience was never once in sync.

Only two people laughed and smiled from start to finish.  I was one of them.
It was clear to me that the other guy in the room --- a stranger to me --- was the only other one who'd done his homework before going the movies.  He'd clearly seen Kevin Smith's previous work.  He'd clearly loved these characters, old & new.  He'd clearly been in on the in-jokes.  After the end credits, we were the only two guys still sitting there.  We wanted to read those long ""Thank You""'s that Kevin Smith places in the end of his features.

Afterwards, we both briefly chatted, and agreed that we were the only two in that screening room that might've gotten every last in-joke from ""Clerks II"".  And you know what?...it didn't matter to us.

I share this long story because Kevin Smith's movies are a niche.  They may be enjoyable on their basic comedy values, because after all, they are pretty funny.  But watching a Kevin Smith movie is so much more entertaining if you've seen them all beforehand.  The in-jokes to the ""View Askew-niverse"" are in the foreground as much as the broad comedy & plot meant for all moviegoers.

This reflection of the past is essential to ""Clerks II"".  The daily insanity of fast-food labor isn't what buddies Dante & Randall care about.  The underappreciated work is just the fuel for their middle-age frustrations.  Nope, they're happiest when arguing about pop culture and --- even if they don't know it --- thinking about their miserable time together.  After all, has their friendship and work together really been all that bad?  Is progress really the answer?

It's hard for me to separate that Kevin Smith's personality and self-image permeate throughout the entire picture.  But ""Clerks II"" may just be his most successful picture because it speaks to everyone, and this time, everyone will be in on it.  Some people didn't just kill time in the food court of ""Mallrats"".  Not everyone had to deal with relationship issues like the bi-sexual curiosities of ""Chasing Amy"".  Not everyone understands taking Catholicism and twisting it on its head like ""Dogma"".

But ""Clerks"" and ""Clerks II"" are relatable to everyone, because even the unemployed must understand what it's like to dedicate something that seems all for naught because of circumstances beyond your control.  ""Clerks"" is maligned in some circles simply because it's a low-budget black-and-white feature.  Like it or not, indy filmmaking isn't everyone's brand.

But ""Clerks II"" is the rare movie that succeeds even better because of its bigger budget.  Kevin Smith can take his smart script, his beloved characters, and throw in even broader comedy with even more unbelievable results.  There are several sequences that rely heavily on music, some as small as driving around to Smashing Pumpkins' '1979', and one as large as a sexual sequence I'd feel dirty even describing here.

Even if you've read none of Kevin Smith's blogs, listened to his interviews, attended his Q&As, etc... It's obvious that the QuickStop store meant something profound to him that he couldn't understand in the 1990s.  But like a fine wine, his memories have nurtured and aged into something special.  ""Clerks II"" works because it's matured.  The mouth isn't any cleaner, and the comedy is just as offensive, and the characters are just as normal... but only a true artist can mix those elements into something special.  ""Clerks II"" is a special movie.

If for nothing else, it's pretty f__king hilarious!",1276819200,,3889,4.932203389830509

2650433,2,B000I0RNVQ,"Watching this movie was a very frustrating experience for me. Everyone changes over time, and filmmakers are no exception; just look at George Lucas. It's clear that Kevin Smith is no longer the same man who made the first Clerks. This movie has the same actors, but it's completely lost the style and, more importantly, the spirit of the first movie.

 The most important thing about Clerks is that the main characters didn't DO anything. They sat around and talked, while things happened to them. That's what made it such a revolutionary movie; instead of heroes who forge their own path through life, it was about people who go with the flow and wish life would just leave them alone. And this sequel gives up that amazing feeling for the sake of comedy. A donkey show and a white man ""taking back"" black racial slurs may be funny, but funny just doesn't cut it. This movie is just as good as any other dumb comedy made in the last decade. And that's a far cry from what I expected of it.

 Aside from a couple heartwarming scenes, mainly the rooftop dance scene, this movie is nothing but cheap laughs and tired shtick Kevin Smith's been using for years now. Please, go ahead and skip it, you aren't missing much.",1257033600,2,1217,4.54337899543379

It's absolutely hilarious and disgusting and brilliant.  In the extras, Smith and his producer Mosier call it their favorite production by far.  I can't say I disagree with them.  I even showed it to my dad who had never seen the original and he loved it.  This movie is a pretty big jump over the original Clerks when it comes to picture and I found the bright purples and yellows to really stand out in high definition.  I can't compare it to the DVD as far as the transfer goes, but it was generally a good looking movie (especially the parts with Rosario Dawson).  It's easily one of the better purchases I've made and on top of that, the extras are in HD, too.  If you already own the DVD, I can't say an upgrade is really necessary, but if you don't already have this and you know you like the movie, buy this version.",1255392000,8,1011,4.306878306878307
2650436,4,B000I0RNVQ,"Clerks II takes place ten years in the future, picking up where cynical Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and his quick-quipped hetero life-mate, Randall (Jeff Anderson), left off, minus a burned down Quick Stop.

The two are now flipping burgers at the fictional fast food joint, ""Mooby's"", which Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (director Kevin Smith) have transformed into their new hang-out. Well, the front entrance anyway.  Have weed, will travel.

Becky (Rosario Dawson), the manager of Mooby's, once had a fling with Dante, and now, of course, Dante is falling hopelessly in love with her. The problem?  It's Dante's last day of work because he is moving out of state and marrying his girlfriend, Emma, (played by Smith's real-life wife, Jennifer Schwalbach). Randall isn't exactly thrilled with the idea of his best friend moving away, and he tries to express that to him in the most hetero of terms without ruining his buddy's big moment.

Elias (Trevor Fehrman) is Dante and Randall's annoying co-worker. He is so virginal it's palatable, with a boyish passion for the Transformers. He even whistles on his way in to work, making him super-easy fodder for the always obscene Randall. One of the funniest moments in the film is when Elias is debating with a customer which trilogy is more epic, Lord of the Rings or Star Wars. Randall is appalled by this conversation and, of course, must interject in the only insulting ways he knows how.

Another great moment in the film is when Dante admits to Becky that he is nervous about his upcoming wedding because he doesn't know how to dance. Becky then takes him up to the roof and asks Jay and Silent Bob to pick out a tune for them. After rejecting some death metal, a choreographed dance sequence emerges on the street level to the tune of the Jackson 5 hit, ""ABC"". This scene pays somewhat of an homage to the hockey-on-the-roof scene from the first Clerks.

Like all of Smith's movies, dialogue is present here in great abundance. And as per usual, the film can prove to be too much for the easily offended (a bachelor party involving a donkey and an under-the-influence Elias comes to mind), but at the core of Smith's films is always heart. The heart of Clerks II is the power of friendship, which is buried deep deep down underneath several layers of potty humor.  Randall and Dante's friendship is more developed this time around, and it pretty much had to be, back when it was believed that Clerks II was going to be the final hurrah for the View Askewniverse.

Dante represents the cynic in all of us, pissed off about his life and the situations that come at him, but he deals with them in short order because he feels doomed. Becky is quite the opposite, all bubbly with a zest for life.  Opposites attract for sure.  Randall is rude and crude with an obnoxious sense of humor, but he means well, and Emma is sweet enough and the typical ""great catch,"" but you can't help but hope that she and Dante will ultimately break up.  Elias is, well, Elias, and Jay and Silent Bob return once more for comic relief during those thankfully rare moments when things take a turn for the serious.",1253577600,,3144,4.675724637681159

2650443,3,B000I0RNVQ,"Clerks II finds Dante and Randal still working at Quick Stop, lo these many years later--until Randal burns it down by forgetting to turn off the coffee pot. Kevin Smith is a more polished film maker now, but of course it lacks the raw energy of his earlier stuff. Like the original Clerks. It seems like he peaked about 5 years earlier, with 2001's Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. This film tries to come to terms with more adult themes, growing up, getting married settling down. But ultimately, it rejects that premise and fosters the view that adolescence can be maintained permanently, and that is all I can say without totally giving away the ending.

Brian O'Halloran as Dante Hicks is a slightly better actor years later, but it is harder to care about his character. It is no longer cute for him to be a slacker, and if he is going to just give up, get married, and settle into a boring life, as he no doubt should, well, who cares?

Jeff Anderson returns as Randal Graves, as annoying as ever, but that was his peculiar charm. It was rumored that there was a falling out between him and autuer Kevin Smith, and in the ""thanks you's"" and aknowledgements, that seemed confirmed. He was back, and he ""hit it out of the park"" but again, who cares? He couldn't save this movie.

Nor could Jay, or Silent Bob, who for once, was literally speechless. There was a new character, a repressed nerd from a strict religious family, Elias, but though he offered a good characterization, his character was poorly written, and I didn't buy it. Pillow pants?

Randal Graves: You can't get a chick, ya mook. You're too weird and sad.
Elias: [gets angry] I turn down chicks left and right.
Randal Graves: Your chicks *are* your left and right.

The best acting of all, though once again, I didn't buy it, was Rosario Dawson acting like she was in love with Hicks. I really enjoyed her performance, but still could not suspend my disbelief. Why did Hicks, a clerk in a Quick Stop for 10 years, and then a fast food employee, attract a beautiful woman like Dawson? And, he had Jennifer Schwalbach Smith, not too shabby herself, wanting to marry him. She is Kevin Smith's wife in real life, so it would be within the realm of possibillity that she could love Dante. A step up, even. But Rosario Dawson? Why did she even agree to do this movie? Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith) seem like they are alter egos for Dante and Randal, don't you think? Duh.

Anyway, though I have trashed Clerks II, I enjoyed watching it, especially the scenes with Rosario Dawson, but mildly entertaining though it was, I still have to say that it wasn't a very good movie. It was a good effort. It gives closure to the View Askew story arc.

Jay: Nong, nong, ning-a ning-a nong nong!

2650446,5,B000I0RNVQ,"While I never thought Kevin Smith movies were horrible, I always thought the dialog was too scripted (like Star Wars) and pretentious. Clerks was interesting, but overrated in my opinion.

Then I took a chance on this movie and thought it was great. There are the usual elements of a Kevin Smith movie, including taboo subjects that get to the line and then obliterate it. But there is also sentimentality. Smith does an excellent job of not only making the characters more interesting, mature, authentic, and likable in this sequel, but also ending the movie on a positive note.",1228003200,,579,4.848484848484849

2650448,5,B000I0RNVQ,"I saw the trailer to this movie and a brief television review prior to renting it and its predecessor, ""Clerks I"". I found the term ""interspecial erotica"" disgusting, yet intriguing. Yeah, the rating is ""R"" due to alleged ""aberrant sexuality"" but the movie is so funny that somehow the possibility of crude sexuality didn't scare me away. The movie is hilarious. Now the rest of those clowns in the movie built up an immunity from the first film but I don't see how Rosario Dawson made it through the movie without being admitted to a Level 1 Trauma Center for ""Severe Comic Relief, secondary to Uncontrollable Giggling, NOS"". I know that I hurt myself just watching it. Was Ben Affleck in the movie?  I must have missed him. But that ain't hard to do with a ""donkey show"" as a co-star and Ben's recent acting credits.

Kevin Smith has a fan in me. I have to close this review with two words"" ""Donkey Show"".....and it is not as graphic as the rating. Be adventurous, use your own judgment, and you will have a great time with this flick!",1217721600,,1037,4.51063829787234

2650450,4,B000I0RNVQ,"A long time in the making/waiting, Clerks II finally makes it here.
If you enjoy the New Jersey Kevin Smith series, you'll enjoy the conclusion(?) of the Clerks' story.

Taking place in a Mooby's restaurant (brought to fame in ""Dogma"") it continues the story of the two clerks from the convenience store, and of course Jay and Silent Bob, this time ""new and improved.""

Nothing is sacred in this installment as the continued stresses of working in the food industry and daily life is brought to a crude/vulgar light. Several debates rise over the Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, racial slurs, and inter-species erotica.
Without revealing too much, just rely on the story to have your reoccurring themes, interlacing stories, and ground-breaking confrontations that are the norm for the series.

And this movie has it's share of cameos. Whether it's Ben Affleck or Wanda Sykes with Earthquake, be sure to be surprised.

Of course the original clerks is a masterpiece that is difficult to match.  and this movie falls short of matching the brilliance of the original, but it's a decent, respectable sequel.  in this film, dante and randal are working in a fast food burger place because the quick-stop burned down.  dante is about to move to florida with his fiance, but he seems to have a thing for his burger restaurant boss.  jay and the silent one play a prominent role in the action.  and of course, they have a lot to contribute to the humor and vulgarity.  randal decides to give dante a going-away present that only randal would think of.  this movie is raw, very funny, vulgar and just a blast!  and the donkey deserves an oscar for his pertinent contributions.  this is a very good kevin smith movie.  it's better than mallrats and j and sb strike back, but it goes nowhere near the original clerks or chasing amy.  it's a funny, raucous sequel to smith's original first film, and i highly recommend you give it a watch.  it'll grow on you, i promise.",1209081600,,1152,4.428571428571429

There's some great insight into Lord of the Rings and Randle's reenactment of the trilogy might be the best summary of the series ever performed. The story has some good insights about life and the characters are all pretty well developed. The acting is much better than the original Clerks (Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson aren't reading their lines off of a prop newspaper in this one).

Im not much into Comedy, usually i enjoy thrillers,dramas, action and some horror.

so i was not really excited to watch Clerks 2, however i gave it a try without high expectations, but i was surprised, this was a very well done comedy, very funny and waaaaay better than the first movie.
In this one, we find Dante and Randal as clerks again, but this time in a fastfood resturant, again, a very simple plot, but the dialogue was very funny and engaging, the characters were also very funy in this one.
Jay was funnier here than the first, and there were alot of over the limit scenes !!

The funny things from the past are still funny, but only in a nostalgic way.. somehow everything's shifted, and you need to change who you are. I related so well to this movie, the realization that we aren't who we once were, that the future is ours to make crappy or great, that we should follow who we are.

This time around with a bigger budget and a cast of great new additions, this movie is a classic in the Kevin Smith Catalouge and is a must do DVD if you are a fan.",1200700800,,501,4.2631578947368425
2650463,3,B000I0RNVQ,"There was a point in time when it looked as though Kevin Smith had finally decided to grow up. After making ""Clerks"" and ""Mallrats"", Smith then went on to make the arguably more sophistocated but still funny ""Chasing Amy"" and ""Dogma"". He even made a film without regulars, Jay and Silent Bob. Unfortunately, the commercial and critical failure of ""Jersey Girl"" must have scared Smith because with ""Clerks 2"", Smith returns to his sophomoric roots.

""Clerks 2"" is another day in the lives of shop clerks, Dante and Randall. They're now 10 years older and working at Mooby's (Smith's equivalent to McDonald's), instead of the Quickstop, but other than that, nothing much has changed, and the jokes are still as crude as ever.

In the time since I saw my first Kevin Smith film, I thought I had grown out of this sort of humour, and yet, as the film progressed, I did find myself laughing, in spite of myself. Some of the jokes are very funny and it was nice to pay another visit to some ""old friends"" (as an aside, this film also features cameos by Smith regulars Ben Afleck, Jason Lee and Ethan Suplee). It's not as good as Smith's earlier films and I probably won't watch it again for a long time, but it's better than ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" and I'm not intending on selling my copy either.

Overall, if you are new to Kevin Smith films, start with something else (I'd recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mallrats-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00000IQW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mallrats (Collector's Edition)</a>), but if you're a long time Smith fan, like myself, you won't be wasting your time by watching this.",1200009600,,1669,5.083941605839416

2650465,5,B000I0RNVQ,"""Clerks II"" is all about growing up, assuming adult responsibilities (or not) and the various problems thus endemic to those around those who are doing so.  As a result, this movie is not the laugh riot that previous Kevin Smith movies (such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dogma-Special-Edition/dp/B000053VAF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dogma (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jay-and-Silent-Bob-Strike-Back-Dimension-Collector-s-Series/dp/B00003CY67/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (Dimension Collector's Series)</a>) have been.  Dante and Randall have to get new jobs at Moobie after the QuickStop grocery and video burns.  A year later, Dante is engaged to Emma and ready to move with her to Florida and start a new life, leaving behind Randall and all the problems he has faced in New Jersey.  The movie focuses on his last day in New Jersey and last day working at Moobie (he has the car packed ready to leave the next morning).

This movie is at times pretty slow moving, since it is fairly introspective - those who have not yet seen it, do not go into it expecting it to be like the last few in the series.  It is more like the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clerks-Collector-s-Series/dp/B00000IQC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clerks (Collector's Series)</a>&nbsp;in many ways because of this.  However, it is a very good addition to the series, I felt, and made a good coda to the series, giving us a view into where the characters have been and an idea of where they are going now that they are ""grown up.""  Definitely a must-have for fans of the Kevin Smith ""Jay & Silent Bob"" series (although Jay and Bob are mostly background in this movie, as in the original, they do have a few key moments and - like always - provide mostly comic relief).

All in all, a most definite recommend from me.",1197244800,,1998,5.885813148788928
2650466,4,B000I0RNVQ,"Not since The Wizard of Oz has the transition from black and white to color been so thrilling! At least that's what Kevin Smith's die-hard fans will say about Clerks II, the sequel to the writer-director's breakthrough 1994 debut. You needn't have seen Clerks to enjoy Clerks II, though the movie is infused with clever references to wide-ranging elements of writer-director Smith's View Askewniverse.

Lifelong friends Dante and Randal (played by Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson) are no longer video store clerks. In a move that's lateral at best, they resort to working at the fast-food joint Mooby's while waiting out Dante's pending move, with his fianc Emma (Jennifer Schwalbach), from New Jersey to Florida. The life change is complicated by the prospect of the friends separating, as well as by Dante's feelings for Mooby's manager Becky (Rosario Dawson at her most fetching).

It's par for the course that Clerks II is an excuse for Smith's oddball character comedy, inventive profanity, irreverent pop culture arguments, and cameos by celebrity buddies. Smith verbally meanders through ""pussy trolls"" and ""donkey shows,"" an epic smackdown between Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, the confusion between Anne Frank and Helen Keller, and why the Transformers aren't blasphemous, among other topics. References to X-Men 2, Batman, C.H.U.D., and Silence of the Lambs flow like water, and Smith gets great mileage not only from the signature characters of Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Smith himself), but from a new character, loser and ""Funployee of the Month"" Elias (Trevor Fehrman).

Ben Affleck, Jason Lee, and Kevin Weisman (Alias) pass through, and Wanda Sykes and Earthquake spark an uproarious argument over racial slurs. Smith's direction is generally smooth, though he somehow manages to draw attention to his camera whenever he moves it, most notably during a 360 shot during an intense conversation and a crane shot. The latter camera move becomes part of the joke when Dawson's sexy rooftop dance breaks into a humorously random chorus number.

Clerks II makes a surprisingly convincing case for Dante and Randal as characters worthy of a revisit once a decade; perhaps unwittingly, Smith has followed Richard Linklater's example of Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, using highly verbal characters as generational mouthpieces. Though the leads' acting hasn't evolved much, the characters remain somehow likeable--perhaps because they're so clearly the two halves of Smith's own personality. The fusty, indecisive Dante feels old and concerned with steps in pursuit of a conventional life, while randy Randal is desperate to keep his arrested development moving as slowly as possible.

Given that one of the film's themes is taking control of one's destiny, it's ironic that Smith not long ago swore off doing any more ""Jay and Silent Bob""-world movies. After Jersey Girl, Smith ate his words to put Clerks II into motion, but at least for the moment, he gets the last laugh. Where Jersey Girl failed--at integrating sentiment into the ViewAskewniverse--Clerks II succeeds, without sacrificing Smith's crowd-pleasing raunch. And, after all, who can begrudge a little emotion of a film that includes ""interspecies erotica""?",1195257600,,3247,5.321637426900585

2650468,5,B000I0RNVQ,"The pop culture references and the donkey sex jokes cause a lot of viewers to overlook the subtle depths of this movie. The real story of this movie is people's ongoing struggle to figure out where their lives should be going. On the surface Dante and Randal are doing the same things and are the same people they were ten years ago. But Kevin Smith did an amazing job of showing the desperation that a decade of not changing has caused.

Dante has become more determined to get out of the life he's leading and is worried about losing what may be his last chance to do so. Randal, on the other hand, has accepting that he'll never go anyplace else in his life and he's worried about losing what little he already has - mainly his friendship with Dante that makes the rest of his life bearable. Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson give great performances that shows them balanced between their fear of change and their fear of stagnation.

The movie's biggest flaw is Smith's ongoing inability to handle female characters with the same insight his male characters get. Rosario Dawson is a wonderful actress but the character of Becky gives her very little to work with. She, like most of Smith's female characters, exists only as a foil to serve the male characters.

And finally, I think the ending of this movie has been misunderstood. Dante has struggled for years to try to make something of his life. In the climax of this movie he essentially decides to quit struggling and accept the life that he's had all along. The irony is that Smith himself didn't make the same choice - he actually did marry Jennifer Schwalback and leave New Jersey. So Smith might be making the subtle point that Dante gave up too easily. Or the alternative might be that Smith thinks Dante made the right choice and Clerks II might be about Smith's regrets for the life he left behind.",1192838400,3,1866,4.580838323353293
2650469,1,B000I0RNVQ,Not funny and this stuff is just gotten old.  Time to move on stoners!,1192233600,5,70,4.0
2650470,4,B000I0RNVQ,"Rosario Dawson's starring role in this movie has been pretty heavily hyped, including the lengthy ""I can't believe she agreed to do the movie"" reminiscences in DVD 2's ""Back To The Wall: Clerks II"" documentary. The question then becomes ""She can't really be that good in this movie, can she?""

The answer, of course, is yes. It's Rosario's movie. I don't say that to detract from the film's overall impact. You just have to watch the scene on the roof of Mooby's in which she teaches Dante to dance to the sound of The Jackson Five's ""ABC"" blasting out of Jay & Silent Bob's boom box below. You watch Dante's facial expression go from amused to stone in love and it's believable. It was also a smart career move for Dawson. Go to IMDB and take a look at the films she's made during her 12-year career...she's got screen presence AND range. She's gorgeous and gifted but she's not a diva...she's a STAR. BIG difference.

It's hard to get into the nitty-gritty of the film without offering up major spoilers, so I won't. I felt that the film ended on a thoroughly reasonable note. The road you take from beginning to end will require you to suspend disbelief on more than one occasion, and Kevin Smith's editing skills still allow for one or two scenes that would have been more at home on the cutting room floor. There's a bit of new age self-help rhetoric in the lines about doing what you want to do with your life versus living up to other people's expectations, but it's handled pretty well in the overall sense.

The key to the entire movie can be found in the documentary, in which Kevin Smith expresses a desire to eventually put Jay & Silent Bob and the rest of the ""View Askew Universe"" to rest in favor of romantic drama-slash-comedies. That's not the kind of movie that put him on the map, and I'm not sure of the audience that's waiting for more films like ""Jersey Girl"" or ""Gigli,"" which he refers to as ""universally loathed, the modern-day Ishtar."" But it's his career, you know? And you'll see the seeds of his desire to make that kind of film in ""Clerks II,"" because it's a relationship movie. Dante and Randall. Dante and the woman he's planning to marry. Dante and Rosario. And yes, Jay and Silent Bob.

The gross-out content of the film comes across a little heavy handed, almost as if Smith felt the need to add it as a counterbalance to the rotating love stories. In the original ""Clerks,"" things like the ""Berserker"" riff and Dante's ""how many"" inquisition of his girlfriend flowed effortlessly into the overall fabric of the film. In ""Clerks II,"" Smith fails to shift gears quite as smoothly.

""Should he"" have made the movie or ""shouldn't he?"" Well, they're his characters and it's his creative journey. I can't imagine anyone saying ""better than the original,"" but I think the core of Smith's audience accept it as a pretty decent film. A good movie's a good movie, and a bad movie's a bad movie. Smith has made both kinds, and he'll probably continue to do so. This was a pretty good one.",1191283200,2,3013,4.551660516605166

2650472,5,B000I0RNVQ,"The final chapter of the ""New Jersey Chronicles"" is am almost satisfying ending to a series of films extending about 15 years.

its more than 10 years after the events of clerks. Dante and Randall's situation hasn't improved much. they're still working basically the same jobs. in the opening scene the quick stop pretty much burns down. the rest of the movie after that takes place at Mooby's fast food place, Dante and Randall's other job.

ive always found Dante to be a kind of bland character, just like TC in Mallrats, but they both have that outrageous sidekick (randall) so it balances out well.

Clerks 2 carries the torch of the original perfectly, with classic characters and always entertaining strings of dialogue. the movie has a satisfying ending which properly brings closure to the chronicles. i wish Kevin would keep it up though. even after all these years, these characters haven't played themselves out at all, even if their own creator thinks thats the case. Kevin Smith is arguably my favorite writer/director, so im kind of biased, but all of his work that ive seen couldn't be any better in my opinion.

like most DVD's Kevin Smith puts out, this has the special features to keep anybody busy for a while, including an hour and a half long documentary on the making of Clerks 2.",1189641600,17,1303,4.752212389380531
2650473,3,B000I0RNVQ,"Kevin Smith hit paydirt with his ultra-low-budget Clerks back in the day and has been trying to catch up ever since.  Clerks, the ultimate satirical look at slackers working in a conveinence store (Dante) and a video shop (Randal)was so fresh and alive back in the day, that anything new would obviously suffer. Years later the slackers no longer have a cush job at the Quickstop when it burns down.  They move on to Moobys burger shack to continue their menial existence.  Of course, Jay & Silent Bob follow, hanging out in front of Moobys, selling dope and putting on a pretty entertaining show.  Nostalgia makes this movie watchable.  If I was a person that had never seen the first Clerks, or appreciated its twisted humor, then I would have hated this movie entirely, without question.  Where Randal and Dante were funny and kinda sad in the first movie, now they are just plain losers and you want to smash their skulls in with a hammer.  Dante is engaged and getting ready to move away to Florida to begin a legitimate life working for his soon-to-be-inlaws.  The only flaw to that logic is that Dante is secretly in love with Becky (Rosario Dawson), his boss at Moobys.  Where his current girlfriend is a manipulating, clingy, over-zealous make-out queen,  Becky is cool and fun and beautiful and she really cares about Dante, God knows why.  Overall, the jokes are okay.  Jay and Silent Bob are pretty funny.  The whole Star Wars vs. Lord Of The Rings is middle of the road.  In reality, it's extremely hard to go and make a sequel to a classic that is going to be anywhere near the quality and freshness of the first movie.  Escpecially 10 years later.  Clerks was excellent film-making by a then starving director.  It was fresh and dirty and completely hilarious.  Kevin Smith is a talented writer and director, but moving back is not helping.  In the original ending to Clerks, Dante gets shot and killed by a robber at the Quickstop.  Maybe Smith should have left it that way.

All in all, I loved this movie and I plan on renting part one this week.",1188172800,2,362,3.9726027397260273
2650476,2,B000I0RNVQ,"I have not been swept into cult fetishes since I was a kid into Legos, Transformers, and He-Man.  Videogames are my addiction, for sure, but again, I am not a cult person.  So Kevin Smith's movies are taken for what they are when I watch them, and most of the time I appreciate the value that they bring.

When I watched Clerks II in the theater, it was awkward to see Jason Mewes after years of drug use, all worn and such.  Then there was Kevin Smith who looked the same as his 1990s film debut.  Eh.

The story that is told in Clerks II is rather simplistic, though certainly humorous.  I think it relies heavily on its cult following such that a couple jokes or scenes are made funnier if you are a Kevin Smith fan.  That is not so bad, but such a reliance really keeps this movie at the cult level and keeps it from propelling to blockbuster status.

That said, I thought Clerks was a fantastic movie.  But trying to bridge to Clerks II was weird for me.  I love raunchy humor, and of course both Clerks movies deliver.  But Dante in a romantic drama role?  I couldn't stand looking at a 30-something Dante trying to court an honestly cute woman, let alone his climactic line when they are in the office, alone at towards the end of the film.

Reviewing this flick, I was disappointed that raunchy humor took a turn for the worst in the beastiality scene.  I am not a prude, and I've laughed at wicked humor before, but the humor of the movie drained as soon as that donkey got out of the van.  It was just too wicked and disgusting.  Scene quality-wise, and thanks to censorship (never thought I'd say that), we were left with four or five low-star actors and their facial expressions.  It was just a horrid scene and made me want to stop the movie all together.  I never actually thought I'd find value in my mother's fast-forwarding technique during the make-out scenes of certain movies when we were kids.  Now, as a 30 year-old adult, I find myself wanting to block this kind of crap and fast-forward to the cleaner scenes.

Anyway, the humor in Clerks II is far more low-brow than its predecessor.  I loved Mall Rats completely, and that humor was pretty small time.  Clerks II, however, seems to put you in a position where you are simply supposed to laugh - not because anything is funny, but so you can let others know that you get the references.  It was just a bad movie overall.

I will say that there are some redeeming qualities to the bad humor and the easy references.  First off, I appreciate Kevin Smith's integration of social commentary into his characters.  Irreverent humor is played out best, in my opinion, when you have conflicting characters.  Such was the case of the racial suggestiveness in one scene, as well as the pre-marriage intercourse and pregnancy undertones.  Also, the back-and-forth friendship of the two main characters.  In this light, the characters played very well off each other, and this gave a meaningful body to an otherwise headless chicken.

Anyway, don't expect this movie to be a favorite of yours unless you are one of those cult types.  I would also keep this away from children at all costs, even if you are the type to let your kids view R-rated movies.  It requires a very mature audience to appreciate the minor value that it can have.  But overall, this is no blockbuster classic, and you will find yourself better off with other Kevin Smith movies, especially those that cost $10 or less.",1187568000,5,3454,4.517741935483871

Smith has serious talent, that few directors and or writers can even come close to, when it comes to dialog. The ""lotr"" battle was tear producing & drinks out your nose good,  taking porch monkeys back blew it out of the park and i cant even get into the kinky kelly without thinking: ""you know someone out there is doing unspeakable acts to their donkey right this second"". This is packed with back to back goodies including a dance number to a choice song we all have broken loose to, maybe not in a fast food joint, but don't even try to deny it. jay and silent bob were just enough and yet not too much, I'm still amazed when i see guys tuck it back. There was a definate change in jay, and i don't think it had to do with jesus. Clerks 2 was dead on in its length of time, it just slips by. The ending: as much as I prefer non sappy endings, this does capture a pair of friends facing an end (not really, more of a change in the structure of their dr phil friend dynamic)to their juvenile hanging out days. WE HAVE ALL BEEN THERE and smith does it justice. Unlike the original clerks, this ends on a happy ""finished"" note, (although the dead old guy in the bathroom was technically finished too) both are equally good. Like all smith movies with jay and silent bob, this is NOT for kids. oh and I almost forgot, this film does NOT STAR ben affleck, kevin weisman or wanda sykes, they're just extras, this stars jeff anderson, brian o'halloran, rosario dawson, jason mewes, kevin himself, and trevor fehrman who did an excellent job as the poor lotr/transformer/jesus loving geek.

2650479,4,B000I0RNVQ,"The original ""Clerks"" was one of the Nineties movies that fell into the category of Slacker Cinema, which also included pretty much anything by Richard Linklater.  Social critics who were baffled by why Gen Xers were using their expensive educations to fold hoodies at the Gap tended to look to these movies for explanation. Well, the protagonists (heroes?) of ""Clerks,"" Dante and Randal are just your garden-variety working class slackers.  They both ""work,"" (the term is used loosely) at a convenience store with wacky customers who chat about Star Wars and examine every container of milk for the one with the latest spoil date.  This movie also introduced Jay and Silent Bob, the Shakespearean-like fools slash stoners who hung out outside the store.  Jay and Silent Bob eventually got their own movie, but they work much better as supporting characters.

 All four return to the ""Clerks"" sequel, as well Rosario Dawson, as the spunky co-worker at the fast food joint where Dante and Randal now work.  Dante is engaged but having second thoughts about marrying and moving away from his friends.  There's a high school nemesis to spar with, certain epithets to classify as offensive or non-offensive, and go-carts to take refuge in when being an adult just gets to be too much.  They have a new co-worker, the geeky Elias, (Trevor Fehman) to torment and debate the merits of ""Lord of the Rings"" with.  There's a subplot about a donkey which made me wonder why the rating wasn't bumped up to NC-17. This is not your ""typical"" R-rated movie with lots of violence, a steamy kiss and a few f-words here and there.

 It's almost impossible to improve on the original recipe, but ""Clerks II"" is nearly as good.  Dante eventually takes responsibility for his life, which doesn't sound very entertaining but manages to be anyway.  Personally, I laughed more watching this than I did at ""Borat.""",1185667200,,1889,4.89937106918239

2650482,2,B000I0RNVQ,"The film opens with Dante and Randall pulling up to the Quick Stop and finding it burning down because Randall left the coffee pot on. Their lives as they know them are over... or are they? A year later they are now working at Mooby's a fast food chain, with their boss, the incredibly out-of-place Rosario Dawson. Dawson does her best to pull it off, but she's just too beautiful to belong in this movie, especially as a love interest for Dante Hicks. Fanboys and Mooby's employees can dream, but it's just too much of a stretch.

What's interesting is that it seems like the $5 million budget for Clerks 2 vs. the $28,000 budget for the original actually ends up negatively affecting the film. With more set pieces and more action, Smith doesn't seem to know what to do with his set. And bringing back Dante and Randall (Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson) for another feature is just too much. He's already squeezed these characters dry of most interesting conversation after the first film, and their deadpan lack of delivery might have worked in a low budget black and white film, but here it's almost painful to listen to. There are still a few funny monologues and moments, but for the most part, Dante and Randall's complaining and bickering just comes off a bit screeching, especially considering that they're now in their thirties.

It seems like Kevin Smith hit a wall with Dogma. After a string of successful, low budget films, maybe Smith ran out of solid ideas, or maybe he just needs to refuel his creative juices. Going back to the well with his original characters the first time for Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back didn't prove very fruitful, so he set out to make some kind of romantic comedy-ish film with Jersey Girl, which flopped terribly, and now we're digging deeper into the well with Clerks 2, Smith's first sequel.

There are two discs, which makes for too much viewing really. There's a documentary about the making of Clerks 2 that's just as long as the movie itself, as well as a thirty minute blooper reel, with a few minutes of Jason Lee flubbing his lines, and showing that he just showed up to film for a few hours as a favor and is ready to get out of there.

Overall, Clerks 2 is an unneeded addition to the View Askew world and the rest of us could have done without it too. It needlessly adds to a story that concluded, and in fact detracts from the original. if you haven't already seen it, I'd recommend staying away, or asking someone that's seen it to tell you which few scenes are watchable and check those out.",1180396800,10,2554,4.5456521739130435

Clerks II is about their new jobs at Mooby's, a fast food restaurant.  Jay and Silent Bob follow them, and are now hanging out at Mooby's too.

Dante is getting ready to leave for Florida with his new fianc, a shallow girl with a personal problem Randal is quick to point out.  Her father is going to pay for their new house and give Dante a carwash to run, so things are looking pretty cozy for Dante.  Randal decides to celebrate Dante's departure with a ""cross-species erotica show"".

Will Dante actually leave New Jersey for Florida?  Will he leave best friend Randal behind?  Or is there actually something left in New Jersey to hold him there?

The charm in this movie is in the dialogue alone, plus the fact that they managed to get hottie Rosario Dawson to play Becky, Mooby's manager and Dante's good friend.  The first 'Clerks' had the charm of black-and-white photography, and although made on a lower budget managed to keep a tighter rein on the storyline while appearing as if the entire movie was shot through a surveillance camera.  'Clerks II' is filmed in color, and lacks the charm of the first movie.

Interesting notes of the movie is the dialogue during the argument over Lord Of The Rings vs. Star Wars, plus the crazy scene with Randal's ""going away gift"".  There are foul words and $exual references and a lot of cynical pottie mouths, but that's what 'Clerks' is all about.  Unfortunately, other than Jay and Silent Bob, the cast didn't hold up well to the passing of time and lost a great deal of their charm.  However, this movie is still funny, earning three and a half stars, but can't hold a candle to the first 'Clerks'.  Enjoy!",1177459200,5,1807,4.544891640866873
2650487,5,B000I0RNVQ,"I became a fan of the original ""Clerks"" back in the 90s.  After watching a ""Clerks"" and ""Mallrats"" double feature on satellite TV last month, I decided I needed to catch up with the characters.  So I bought this DVD, checked out the movie, and went through most of the extras.  If you liked the first flick, then you need to add this one to your collection.

""Clerks II"" picks up a decade or so after ""Clerks.""  After accidentally torching the Quick Stop and RST Video building, Dante (Brian O""Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson) wind up with jobs at Mooby's, a typical fast-food joint.  A year later, Dante is engaged to an attractive but controlling blond and prepping for a move to Florida.  To ""celebrate"" Dante's impending departure, Randal decides to throw a raucous surprise going-away party.  The rest of the movie plays out over the course of Dante's last day, as buried passions rise to the surface and all sorts of crazy stuff happens.

The ""Clerks"" characters are easy to identify with.  In the first movie, Dante and Randal struggled with young adulthood and finding purpose in life.  Here, their rage against the machine continues with the thirtysomething angst of ""growing up"" and leaving youth behind for stability and responsibility - in other words abandoning options in order to take a certain path (see the movie ""High Fidelity"" for another great example of that theme).  They're also poster boys for what happens to close male friendships when a woman enters the picture (especially when she doesn't like the other guy).  Finally, the geek in me loves it when they rant about pop culture, like arguments with customers over which movie trilogy is best: ""Star Wars,"" or ""Lord of the Rings.""  As a Christian, sometimes I struggle with Kevin Smith's raunchiness (the donkey stuff was a bit much, to say the least - you have been warned), especially when I'm laughing at it.  But the man professes a relationship with God, and he touches on some deep stuff with a sense of humor, so I have to give him props for that.

Despite the considerable gap between the two movies and some additional paunch, the actors nail their characters (doing the ""Clerks"" animated show must've helped).  The two leads have a natural chemistry, so I easily bought them as lifelong friends.  The female leads from the first movie don't return, but the women in our heroes' lives this time around are good to go, especially Rosario Dawson as Dante's manager and confidant.  She conveys just the right mix of ebullience, seriousness, and vulnerability with her character.  And it's always fun to see Jay and Silent Bob in action, both in and out of jail.

The DVD extras are cool - Kevin Smith certainly uses the format to its fullest potential.  I was amazed by the amount of planning and detail involved in the filmmaking process.  Even a small budget film like this one entails a ton of planning, development, and logistics.  Aspects of the creative process, like a critique of the rough cut by directors Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, were fascinating.  And after all that blood, sweat, and tears, how will the public receive one's pride and joy?  Mr. Smith was somewhat cynical about how ""Clerks II"" would be received at Cannes, but the 8-minute standing ovation at the movie's end was a solid affirmation.  Particularly touching was Jason Mewes' struggle for sobriety (apparently this is the first time he's played Jay w/out chemical assistance).  It was a nice touch to see the cast and crew rally around him and encourage his recovery.  Of course, the deleted scenes and bloopers are fun as well.

A special nod should go to the two main commentary tracks.  The cast commentary focuses more on the actors and their perspectives.  As with ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" commentary, I was disappointed by the absence of the female lead (Rosario Dawson) - her insights were missed.  However, the rest of the cast made it fun, especially with Mr. Smith holding the reins and keeping things on track.  It's obvious that they got along well during the shoot.  The technical commentary with director Kevin Smith, producer Scott Mosier, and director of photography David Klein is a bit drier because it's, well, technical.  It centers on the filmmaking process (film stock, lighting, set design, special effects, etc.).  Although I found the tech stuff less captivating at times, it was interesting to get the scoop on how they used color and film type to help tell the story.  Overall, it's amazing to see how the film came together, and how far they've advanced as filmmakers since the first movie.

If you're a Kevin Smith fan, then I'm sure you've already seen ""Clerks II"" (if not, then what are you waiting for?).  However, if you're new to the View Askewniverse, then check out the original before watching this one.  That way you'll get the full meal deal, and hopefully come to enjoy these characters and their struggles as much as I have.",1177113600,3,4944,4.824228028503563

2650489,5,B000I0RNVQ,"I remember when I first heard Kevin Smith was making a ""Clerks 2"" I doubted he would be able to pull it off. Then I saw the movie poster...""So, it's in color,"" I thought. Still, it had the same two original actors in it, and I liked those characters, so because I enjoyed the first movie, I wanted to see what Smith had in store for them in second. My expectations grew slightly after I found out Joel Siegel had walked out of the movie. My friend and I wondered, ""Did he see the first one.""

From what little knowledge I have of the movie industry, it's rare that a sequel is made to a production 10 years after the fact. So, my friend and I (who had went to see the first one together in a dingy $1 theater that stunk and had sticky, soda floors) decided to cough up the dough to see it opening weekend. We do both have full-time jobs now, after all. However, the slacker element remains very much alive in that we went to the matinee. The venue was important. The old $1 theater we had seen the first one at closed about 6 years ago, so we decided to venture to the city where we went to college and see it at a the same theater where we saw The Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction. But, again as slackers, we were about 5 minutes late and didn't want to miss the beginning. So we checked the newspaper and found a showtime at a newly construction cinemas across town. There was an hour or so to kill, so we swung by the convenience store, grabbed a couple of cans of the black, and downed them in the parking lot of an apartment complex talking about old times. Also smoked a cigar before the movie in celebration, choosing to smoke it before rather than afterward because of our fear we wouldn't be as cheerful when we left. We'd watched the first film the night before to refresh our memory, so Kevin Smith was sure to have a hard time pleasing us we were sure. After all, when the first one was made, Smith hadn't gained his notoriety, at least not nationally. Now, he was at least moderately wealthy if not rich, how could he relate to the slackers of the universe?

As it turned out, we needn't have worried. The movie was just as uncouth, if not more so, than the first. What it did show me is how much Smith has matured ... maybe not so much as a writer, but as a director. For those of you who notice that type of thing, the direction of this film is far, far better than the first. Unexpectedly, it also had a touching moment from Randal toward the end that I think is the film's best moment. Smith handled the black-and-white/color dilemma masterfully, but I'm not going to reveal how in case you haven't seen it yet.

In short, if you like Smith's stuff, check this out. If you don't, don't.",1176422400,,2702,4.232558139534884
2650490,5,B000I0RNVQ,"Watching `Clerks II', written and directed by Kevin Smith and (with apologies to `Mad' Magazine) `the usual gang of idiots' is like visiting an old friend after a three year separation (roughly the time since the release of 'Jersey Girl'). `Clerks II' is Kevin Smith's seventh movie and the sixth to take place in the `View Askew' universe, in spite of the veiled threat to leave this venue at the end of `Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'. And, obviously, it is a sequel to his first movie, `Clerks', released 12 years ago, putting Smith on the map as a talented independent filmmaker, validated by being distributed by Bob and Harvey Weinsteins company, Mirimax. Smith and the Weinsteins have been collaborators ever since.

Like `Dogma', the movie with which I first became familiar with Smith's work, `Clerks II' is a tangle of contradictions, as you may expect from devout Catholic Smith who happens to make `potty mouth' movies. It has some of the raunchiest language and suggestions of perverse sexuality; however, these almost always remain at the `suggestion' stage, the subject of teenager wet dreams. Except, the principal characters here, Dante and Randal, played by Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson (I suspect Anderson gets top billing to help convince him to reprise his role. More on this later) are in their mid-thirties. In `movie time', they've been clerks at the Quick Stop for the last 10 years and have moved their act to clerking at a local New Jersey (filmed in LA, of course) Mooby's (a fast food chain invented in `Dogma'). The 35-year-old `teenager' lifestyle is the fuel for most of the movie plot and humor.

The cast and crew make the production seem like the job of creating a fraternity float in `Animal House'. Even famous Smith friends Ben Affleck and Jason Lee show up in cameos (with Lee being on screen long enough to almost qualify as a minor character). I kept waiting for Matt Damon to show up, but he never made it. He must be off doing another A-List thriller. The most widely anticipated appearance is Jason Mewes and Smith as Jay and Silent Bob, in the first movie where, according to his own confession, Mewes is not high on something. I don't know if it's my imagination, but it almost seems that Mewes' performance has just a tad less energy than in his appearances in `Dogma' and `Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'. I do know that silent Bob's routine is getting just a bit old. They do, however, add their spice to the dish and would have been missed if they were not there.

The one A-list star in the cast is Rosario Dawson, taking over the Liv Tyler part (in Jersey Girl) in our merry band. There is evidence that her appearance was part of the conditions under which Harvey Weinstein agreed to fund the production. I'm not familiar with her other roles. She appeared in `Alexander' and some other major flicks. I suspect `Clerks II' will actually look better on her resume than that ancient Greek bomb.

The last two major characters are played by Trevor Fehrman who earlier collaborated as an actor in a Jeff Anderson movie and Jennifer Schwalbach, who in `real life' is Mrs. Kevin Smith. Of the two, Fehrman gives the stronger performance as the true teenager on the Mooby crew. Schwalbach does a good performance, but shouldn't loose her day job.

It's been quite some time since I saw the original `Clerks', but I do see some obvious parallels in the plots of the two movies, which are much more cleverly done than resorting to flashbacks. There is a scene on the roof of Moobys, similar to the hockey game in the original, and the road trip, similar to the visit to the funeral parlor in `Clerks'. We even see Smith's mom playing the compulsive searcher for the freshest bottle of milk.

While I find Smith's movies entertaining (except for his second, `Mallrats') and immensely funny, he and his team really come into their own when they put out their DVDs. His cover blurb `Loaded with over 6 Hours of Bonus Features' is even conservative, as I suspect you will find enough material for at least four or five weeknight viewings (in addition to that great Friday night date on the living room couch, where you don't get past the third reel before being distracted). There are the usual two voice-over commentaries, blooper reel, and outtakes. But, the best addition is the feature length `Making of Clerks II' documentary which tells the story of the movie from conception to release at both Cannes and Hollywood.

Smith's movies are not for everyone. But, if I hold them up to my gold standard for comedies, the better films of Woody Allen, they really come off quite well, at the very least in the laughs per minute measure. Smith even manages to fit in a few Allenesque psychological insights and pathos here and there. While this movie doesn't have the durability of `Annie Hall' or `Hannah and Her Sisters', it has more substance to it than the average Will Ferrell (not counting `Stranger than Fiction') or Ben Stiller opus. One can gain considerable hope for a robust Christianity when we see it coexist with scatology used just for the fun of it.

To recap, this is certainly not for everyone, but for those who share Smith's sense of humor, this is a long drink of cool water (taken from bottled water, to be sure).",1176076800,2,5280,4.7005405405405405
2650491,3,B000I0RNVQ,"So ""Clerks II"" isn't an indie film.  Who cares?  So it's slicker, brassier, brighter, and altogether smugger than its predecessor.  Who cares?  So it's a bit cruder, raunchier, and evokes a startling brand of sentimentality in the midst of all that vulgarity.  I'll say it again: who cares?

Well, okay, fans of the first film will definitely care.  And Smith-philes will have some invested in those questions, too.  As far as that goes, all that really matters here is forgivability.  If you are a purist, this sequel is bound to leave you unsatisfied and grumbling.  ""Clerks II"" abounds with the same rambling, tongue-in-cheek social commentary that made the first film such a success, but this time around the dialogue unspools like it was bought wholesale.  Smith's reprisal here thinks it should work simply because it worked once before.  Add in a few rib-poking-in-jokes, trot out a couple of guest stars, and slap on a preservative-heavy message about the Meaning of Success, and you've got a film that plays like a tribute to itself.  (Again, for old fans, this should be a treat, especially since the movie is packed -- literally overflowing -- with Smith-isms that a casual viewer will likely miss, including the director's obsession with the number 37, a cameo by Smith's own daughter, nods to ""Spiderman,"" hockey, and Smith's childhood home, and a rant against the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy lifted almost directly off of ""Evening with Kevin Smith 2."")

There's little need to go over the plot.  Dante and Randal are back, but they are no longer employed at Quick Stop.  Now they work the day shift at a fast food joint called Mooby's, and although their jobs are different, their attitudes are pretty much the same.  Dante is the frustrated straight man, Randal spends most of his time tormenting the up-tight Employee of the Month, Elias (who has one of the best scenes in the film -- listen for the words ""pillow pants""), both of them working under the beautiful eyes of Becky (Rosario Dawson).  Most of the movie takes place on Dante's last day of employment, as he is getting married and moving to Florida.

That's pretty much it.  By itself, the movie is little more than a schmaltzy look at True Love, the conflict between Settling For Okay and Following Your Heart, and the Undying Nature of True Friendship.  There are dramatic confrontations, a pointless and self-congratulatory dance scene, long moments of painful self-rumination, and heartfelt confessions (one of them, taking place in a prison, is actually pretty good).  This, interspersed with diatribes about beastiality, racism, the handicapped, and -- of course -- why you should never tick off the guy who handles your food.

All in all, while it is entertaining, it's also not that great as far as movies go.  The first movie floated along on its own ingenuity, its whip-crack dialogue, its (if you can believe this) brains.  Something about ""Clerks II"" seems half-hearted and watered-down, as if Kevin Smith imagined he'd already done all of the heavy-lifting with the first film.  Smith-supporters and ""Clerks""-cultists will probably relish this installment and find a safe place for it on their DVD shelves.  Anyone else should expect something mildly amusing, but ultimately unintelligent, uninspired, and barely even there.",1175731200,2,3313,5.02014652014652

2650494,4,B000I0RNVQ,"Sometimes its difficult to judge a sequel without directly comparing it to its predecessor.  Most film makers take this into account, and strive to either make a better film or at least one comparable to the original.  Sometimes they succeed and sometimes the results are mixed.  With that said, I think ""ClerksII"" is a very good movie, and a decent sequel.

Kevin Smith is always a capable director.  His greatest skills are working with his actors and getting comic timing to work in the best way.  His visual style is solid and not very flashy.  He always includes some great visual gags, hilarious dialogue and lots of humor going on in the background of shots.  This movie provides all those.  The sets at Mooby's fast food joint are perfect.  I also enjoyed Dante's farewell party, and his dancing lesson with Becky.  Also worth noting is the soundtrack that grabs some great music and places it precisely where it's needed.  Its interesting to note that most of the music has a very 90's feel to it.

The acting is also pretty solid across the board.  The main cast is all comfortable in their roles, with O'Halloran and Anderson being the main focus of the film.  However the inclusion of Rosario Dawson and Trevor Fehrman (as Elias) are welcome and add a great deal to the film.  Fehrman in particular captures the painfully  nerdy character that you feel bad for and want to slap all at the same time.

The script is typical Kevin Smith antics.  That means some people are going to love it and others are going to hate it.  Since the original ""Clerks"" was one of my favorite movies, I knew what to expect and wasn't disappointed.  If I have one complaint its just that the tone of this movie felt a little less irreverent to the original.  I know this was intentional, but at the same time, it felt like it was very hard to take these characters seriously.  I really enjoyed the film, but when compared to the original, it just wasn't as funny or fresh.  Fans of Kevin Smith's previous films should be entertained by the film.  If you disliked Kevin's other movies, or were expecting something more like ""Chasing Amy"", well this isn't going to float your boat.",1174780800,,2170,4.603133159268929
2650495,5,B000I0RNVQ,"I like Kevin Smith movies..I love an evening with Kevin Smith one (see my review) and two (evening harder). So this film is a NO-Brainer

Smith's sequel to his classic film Clerks is more of a contining story ten years hence. Dante & Randal have now become employees of Mooby's  (Smith's version of McDonalds) after their former clerk job burned  up in a fire, because Randal left the coffee pot on.

Smith has made this a coming of age story for the Dante character, making this the few days in New Jersey and moving with his girlfriend (played by Smith's wife Jennifer Schwalbach). Rosario Dawson is under used as the Mooby's sexy but sweet manager.

There are cameos by Ben Affleck and Jason Lee (who took moments from their busy film and TV careers)...but  there is NO GEORGE CARLIN (Boo-Hiss) in this movie. The Jay and Silent Bob characters make  too short appearances in this film, but when they are on screen-it is worth it!

 If you like Clerks, Mallrats, or Chasing Amy, this bittersweet comedy is great. If you are seeking another Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back, it one has more heart. However, as good as this is-IT aint no DOGMA!

That said, there is still plenty of Smith's trademark verbal exchanges dealing with everything from Lord of the Rings to interspecies erotica.

2650503,5,B000I0RNVQ,"Well, I know Clerks II doesn't come to mind when wanting to show off HiDef Picture and Sound quality, Clerks II still looks damn fine in HD, and will impress any fan.

Video Quality:

Clerks II is presented in the MPEG-4 AVC codec, and holds up nicely against VC-1. Many reviewers have complained about the hot overblown contrast of the cinematography, but to tell you the truth, it never bothers me as I think it feels more real. Considering most of the film is set inside a fast food resturant in the middle of the day, you'd expect that.

Film Grain is evident but never really distracts, as it just adds to the low-budget nature of the film. Clarity and sharpness are top-notch and is never an issue, and detail always manages to hit it's mark. There is some slight digital grain on BG walls and floors, but overall not a bad transfer.

Score: 3.5/5

Audio Quality:

Sound wise, Clerks II HD-DVD fairs up as you could imagine for a dialogue driven film. Dialogue is always clear from the front speakers, yet the surrounds and LFE are rarely used. It does it's job, and the HD-DVD comes with a bonus Dolby Digital TrueHD track (which is not displayed on the back cover).

Score: 3/5

Extras:

Like it's DVD cousin, this HD-DVD gets all the bells and whistles of special features, but THIS TIME round, they're displayed in 1080i HD glory. Ok, it's not everything, but it's nice to see the behind the scenes in all their glory. The docos are very funny and entertaining (as you'd expect from Kevin Smith), and the 3 audio commentaries will not dissapoint any fan.

Score: 5/5

Overall:

I am a HUGE fan of Kevin Smith, and in my opinion Clerks II is his strongest film to date. It's hilarious, laugh-out-loud gross yet heart felt at times.

Call me insane, but Clerks II was one of the main reasons I chose HD-DVD over Blu-ray. It's a gem of a movie that any fan should be without in there HD-DVD collection.

It starts out like any ordinary day for Dante (Brian O'Hallaran) at the Quick-Stop until he discovers the fire inside the Quick-Stop which Randal (Jeff Anderson) forgot to turn off the coffee pot (again).

 So a year later Dante and Randal are working at Mooby's; a McDonald's type restaurant and Dante is engaged to Emma (who in reality is Kevin Smith's wife) and today is Dante's last day at Mooby's till he and Emma head to Florida and kiss Jersey good-bye, but Dante has one more day to go through with his co-workers but Randal is not going to make Dante forget his last day in Jersey.

 For Dante's going away gift Randal tell's Dante they are going to do something they have been talking about ever since they saw Bachelor Party on BETA at Dante's parent's house when they were 12; Randal hired Kinky Kelly and The Sexy Stud for some Interspecies Erotica, but during the mean-time Dante is having second thougths about Florida because Dante's boss Becky and Dante have more than a professional relationship going on inside the restaurant.

 Is this one of Kevin Smith's best films? Well it's good and funny in a lot of parts (especially the donkey show, and debating Lord Of The Rings and Star Wars), the love story between Becky and Dante is all right, though there is HUGE chemistry there between Dante and Becky it was all right, but in my opinion Randal steals the show with his crazy and wild antics about the handicap guy who Randal is flaming on his blog (who he call's Crippy Boy), and on how he would of ended the Lord of The Rings on a rather interesting ending; I'll put it like this; if Peter Jackson ended the LOTR movies like the way Randal would of ended it...The Return Of The King would of been rated X.

Lots of dialogue, extremely dirty jokes, and fan boy references.  Dante and Randal are now 10 years older and still working as clerks, this time at the fast food chain Mooby's.  Jay and Silent Bob return as well as a few of Smith's other regulars making brief appearances.

As far as sequels go, this one was good.  It could have stood on it's own and doesn't really make a difference if you saw the original or not.  My biggest problem with this movie is they wasted a lot of time adding unnecessary filler because they had money this time around.  The go carts, and the big dance sequence are the best examples of this.  Usually when the character's aren't saying something funny, they're given long monologues which usually turn out to be pretty sappy.  But I suppose those are minor complaints.

The extras are decent.  In addition to 3 commentary tracks, the best feature is the hour and a half behind the scenes of the movie.  I enjoy watching these kind of featurettes but I didn't really think the making of Clerks 2 could be interesting for that amount of time.  Fortunately it's actually very funny and infomative, and I thought it was fitting that the first thing Smith addressed was the question of going back and making another one of these movies he was supposedly done with.  In addition to that is a half hour of gag reel (too long) and some web blog videos.

The story is nothing more than a basic structure to handle Smith's diatribes and nerdalogues.

Not one of the best comedies, or one of the best sequels (of which there were plenty).  One of the best movies overall.  I loved it.

It's clear that Smith has given a lot of thought to where these characters should be, ten years or so removed from their original (very bad) day at the store.  Randal is still wandering aimlessly through life, with a little more wisdom than he lets on but not much more ambition.  Dante opens the film poised to run off to Florida (like T.S. Quint in Mallrats--apparently Florida is where the desperate go to escape Jersey) with a girl he doesn't really like that much because she's willing to marry him after shunning him in high school.

While Dante and Randal are still the centerpieces of the film, performances by the supporting cast are much more important to the movement of the picture than they were to the first ""Clerks"" picture: Rosario Dawson and Trevor Fuhrman both fit their roles perfectly, and while I could have done with just a little less Elias, Fuhrman made him so funny that he's someone you can put up with, even if you don't necessarily like him.

By the close of the film, the characters have found themselves just where they have to be.  The ending Smith crafts for the picture (and potentially--or not-- the ending for these characters) is pitch-perfect, and rings so true you have to wonder how come it's never occurred to Smith before (it could as easily have been slipped in as one of the backdrop ""resolution"" scenes at the end of ""Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back"" and nobody would have questioned it).",1168300800,2,1618,4.5326460481099655
2650528,2,B000I0RNVQ,"I was really psyched when I heard about Clerks 2, because the original had a mix of clever, crude and cute humor, not to mention tons of interesting dialogue content(from crude to intellectual humor).The second clerks misses the mark set by the first installment. There is total lack of intellectual or cute humor and unique and diverse dialogue. The humor this time around is all based upon crudeness. The same crude phrases and jokes are annoyingly repeated over and over again, like beating a dead horse. Even the customers this time around are quite lackluster. The movie actually has a plot, but its rather bland and cliche. I miss the randomness of the first movie(which had a setup similar to most Seinfield episodes) and how it was split into different days and different scenes, almost as if it were comprised of little skits. Kevin Smith took away all the amazing things that made the original Clerks great when he made Clerks 2, and came up short trying to create a decent plot with interesting dialogue.",1168214400,2,1015,4.805714285714286
2650529,5,B000I0RNVQ,"Kevin Smith knows his fans. Let's face it, you either love his movies or ou hate them (Jersey Girl doesn't count). And Clerks 2 is a fantasic way to spend an hour and a half. Once you watch this movie you can see why it was given a record length standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival. This movie is essentialy the cumination of all the techniques that Smith and Mossier have learned since gracing the world with Clerks more than a decade ago. This is the best kind of comedy, a comedy with heart. You'll laugh, but you actaully care about what happens to Dante and Randolf.

The real reason this is a great buy however, is the amazing amount of bonus features. There  are three separate audio commentaies, the fist being an amazing commentary talking about how the movie was actually made, which is fantastic for anyone interested in learning about what goes on behind the camera. The second disk is filled with mini-documentaries, blooper reels and deleted scenes, all with introductions.

Kevn Smith and the good people at View Askew care about their fans, and this DVD set is a testament to that fact. If you're a fan of his movies, buy this movie. If you've never scene any of his movies, this is a pretty good one to start with as well. You won't be dissapointed!",1168128000,,1275,4.534782608695652

After watching Dogma, a friend suggested Clerks, and I was like...""I don't know, its a nice day out...etc. etc.""  But we decided to check it out.  (No pun intended) I was not a huge fan of Silent Bob and Dave, but the movie had some good parts...rockin out in the shop, lettin loose, jammin with friends...all stuff I can get behind.  The story wasn't bad either.  I gave it 3 stars, and will probably end up ""checking out"" ; ) the sequel!",1168041600,,485,4.228260869565218
2650531,4,B000I0RNVQ,"The first Smith film I ever saw was Dogma, and I've been a faithful viewer ever since. I was never all that crazy about Clerks, possibly because I was at a better point in my life than Dante and Randal were. Ten years later, I've made life-changing decisions very similar to what Dante had to at the end of this film.

There are many laugh-out-loud moments in this film. The re-introduction of the new and improved Jay and Silent Bob. Randal vs Eliar in a hilarious LOTR & Transformers vs SW debate. If you want a microcosm of what fandom is truly like - this 5-10 minute sequence epitomises it perfectly. Tribal in nature, and subject to generational change like any other community. And then there's the romance between Becky and Dante. There's great romantic chemistry between Rosario Dawson and Brian O'Halloran. You know these two are meant for each other. And Smith utilises that expectation perfectly in a great musical montage that propels the plotline as well.

What could've sunk this movie for me was a bad ending. Fortunately, Smith handles the ending just right. It doesn't teeter over the edge into sentimental mawkishness. From the moment Dante and Randal enter the bank, we can see them maturing into grown adults. It's a great moment and is a perfect capper to the film.

As always, the DVD extras are just terrific. The highlights are the Cast Commentary and the almost 2-hour documentary. In previous commentaries we don't hear often from Jason Mewes. Since going sober, the difference is clear. Mewes is a very entertaining and outgoing livewire. Great stuff all round.",1167782400,2,1589,4.834558823529412

If you don't like his movies, you won't even make it to the donkey scene, which will repulse you beyond belief.  I'm in the former camp, and couldn't stop laughing throughout the movie.

The DVD is filled with extras - multiple commentaries, an intro by Kevin Smith, details on inter-species erotica, deleted scenes, and more.  Again, this is good stuff, but only if you like the movie...",1167609600,2,583,4.742574257425742
2650533,3,B000I0RNVQ,"I'm probably not the best guy to be reviewing a movie like this coz I'm not what you'd call a Kevin Smith fan.  I don't hate him by any means, I tend to find some genuinely good stuff in some of his films, but sometimes he downright pisses me off.  Alot of the positive reviews here seem to come from those folks who hang on Smith's every word as though it were the bible.  On the other hand, the damning reviews seem to be way too hard on the movie.  I'm not saying I'm the voice of reason or anything, I'm just gonna try to be a tad more balanced.  I'll admit that when I first caught wind of this movie I just brushed it off as Smith's attempt to regain the spotlight(which he's been out of for awhile) by retreading on what made him a name in the first place.  I did actually enjoy Clerks 2(3 and 1/2 stars is more accurate).  It actually managed to eliminate some of the stuff I hated about the first one.  One of those things being Smith flexing his vocabulary.  That always annoyed the hell out of me and made him seem like some pretentious John Hughes.  When Smith wasn't jotting down words out of the dictionary for his characters' dialogue, he actually had a knack for some witty and interesting conversation now and again.  In Clerks 2 he makes more use of good dialogue without the fancy shmancy words and phrases.  This time around Dante is less of a whiney schmuck.  He still is to a certain degree, but not too much, and he seems a bit more human.  Randal is still Randal, and to me, that's rather annoying coz I never liked the character of Randal.  This time around Smith actually delves a bit more into Dante and Randal's friendship and even manages to get a little emotion out of it(for some folks this was a major complaint though I thought it actually helped quite a bit).  Jay and Silent Bob are back to being supporting characters which is were they belong and where they work best.  Another complaint folks have is the love story involving Dante's pencil-thin, unattractive fiancee and his attractive and likeable boss.  I guess with the love story you can take it or leave it, but if you're watching a Smith film, you should have at least expected it.  The humor's all the same so that should please fans.  For me, Smith's humor is very hit and miss.  When he's on, he's really on.  When he's off, he's friggin way off.  You get all the sex talk(from Randal of course), the juvenile clowning around(from Jay and Silent Bob of course) and Dante usually being the victim or right in the middle of it.  You get another Randal movie rant which in this case is Star Wars vs. Lord Of The Rings(I've never cared for either fan camp, but Randal's reasons for not liking LOTR is lame, like something you'd overhear in a video store by debating teenagers.  AND YOU JUST WANNA SMACK THEM!).  There's no reason to give a play by play of everything that happens, but it more or less boils down to this:  Clerks 2 is like the first one only it's a bit more heartfelt, in color, and ten years later.  It does have one up on the first one though by having a reoccurring King Diamond song(""Welcome Home"" if you really care) and it's used to a pretty good comic effect(place King Diamond in any situation and he'll liven things up).  That may be a first for a mainstream movie.  Hell, at least we know Smith's a King Diamond fan and that makes him okay in my book.",1167523200,,3371,4.3472
2650534,3,B000I0RNVQ,"Clerks II takes place 10 years after the events from the first movie. After the Quickstop is burned to the ground, Dante and Randal now work at the fast food restaurant Mooby's. Aside from that not much has changed, Randal is as insensitive as ever and offends people on a regular basis. Even his best friend Dante is speechless sometimes hearing Randals statements. Dante himself is in the lucky position to have a new girlfriend with whom he wants to move to florida. He sees his big chance to finally make something out of his life, allthoug he can't shake a somewhat bad feeling about it.

Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson both act quite well, however Anderson's part is the cooler one, so he manages to stand out a little higher. At the same time, it is Anderson who is responsible for the moral speech towards the end of the movie. So Anderson finds himself in the difficult position where on the one hand he has to deliver this somewhat insensitive, offensive guy who on the other hand finds the right choice of words at the right time. This is close to contradictory, but Anderson manages to make the best of it. It's also nice to see, that unlike Dante Randal has come to terms with what he is, much like in the first movie.

The movie gives the fans at least partially what they could expect. Randal and Dante discuss movies, mostly Star Wars and Lord of The Rings. Randal gives a great sum-up about the Ring-trilogy. They discuss sex, mock customers and complain about their lives.

Unlike the first movie Clerks II is coulored and you can clearly see the bigger budget. More Locations, more spectacularly camera movements, gueststars. That somehow, however, leads to a movie lacking the charme of the original.

The mainplot is a lovestory which is far more dull and predictable than we know from Kevin Smith. As soon as you met both girls in Dantes life you immediately know where the story is going. What about Dante's inner conflict from the first movie? Here the story is clear right from the beginning, even Dante knows it, he only needs the courage to admit it. Therefore the plot is incapable of keeping the audience entertained. This must done through other ideas, sadly this is where Kevin Smith failed.

There is a scene that almost lasts the entire finale where a semi-attractive middle aged man first strips to reveal some kind of SM-Outfit, then sucks off a horse before he finally starts penetrating the animal from behind, meanwhile the entire clique is watching with popcorn and coke and a 19-year old is even masturbating. Sorry, Smith, what's your problem? Since when did ""Jackass"" become you direct competition? It might have worked as a short gag, but this way, where the only thing missing on the way to fully grown animal porn is a close-up of the animals penis, it's a questinonable idea at best.
Not quite as questionable, but also misplaced is the muscial show in the middle of the movie. The car-scooter sequenze doesn't seem to serve the plot either.

Also, Mr. Smith should really stop getting his wife into his movies. She seems misplaced. You could already see that in ""Jay and Silent Bob strike back"". If Smith loves her, that's fine. but he can't just force her into movies. It clearly wasn't Shannon Elizabeth as Justice who didn't fit in the girls combo. In Clerks II she seems equally misplaced.

The obligatorily appearances of Ben Affleck and Jason Lee however are fun, though the question why they both had to have those mustaches might remain unanswered.

We also get to see Jay and Silent Bob though their on screen time is significantly shorter than in Dogma or Mallrats. It's also them who keep even the cheesiest scenes funny, which ultimately might be the only reason they were put in the movie in the first place.

Clerks II is hard to rate. The movie offers some cool onliners, the weakest mainplot from all the Kevin Smith movies so far (including Jay and Silent Bo strike back!) and some ideas that really put the makers sanity into question. Anyway, I missed the charme and simpleness of the first movie. Cool guys with cool statements. Clerks II is too hollywood, all that Kevin Smith managed to avoid until then and those parts that aren't hollywood are edgy or outright repulsive. Those who liked the previous movies should definitley check this one out, too, but I'd say wait til it's a little cheaper. I surely wouldn't spent [...] Euros on the DVD again.",1167436800,,4423,4.689432989690721

2650538,5,B000I0RNVQ,"SPOILERS alert here. Also, I have to say this upfront: I actually liked JERSEY GIRL, so take this review for whatever you think it's worth.

No worries, fans of CLERKS. Kevin Smith didn't eff it up. With CLERKS 2, our trousers-challenged maverick writer/director crafts an admirable and wickedly funny sequel to his 1994 indie, black and white cult hit. Once again, Smith creates a rallying film for the disenfranchised and the disinclined. And he brings his usual bag of tricks: the bawdy humor, the character-driven interplays, the pop culture indulgences, and the beloved characters.

Here's the plot: It's been a decade since we last met up with Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson), who had been whiling their dead end lives away in a convenience store and a video shop. Well, CLERKS 2 finds the Quick Stop burnt down due to a coffee machine mishap and the hapless duo now toiling at the haphazardly frequented fast food joint Mooby's. At first glance, not much has really changed. With the lack of steady customers, the duo still finds plenty of time to goof around and mouth off. Now in their thirties, Randal is still as abrasive as ever, but Dante seems to have finally decided to get his life into gear. This is his last day working at Moody's. Tomorrow, he's driving out of Jersey with his cute fiancee Emma (Jennifer Schwalbach Smith, the director's wife) and moving to Florida, where he's promised a job by her pops and even a house by her moms. He's pretty much made up his mind, though certain doubts linger. His best buddy Randal thinks he's taking the easy way out, a sentiment echoed by Becky (the easy-on-the-eyes Rosario Dawson), their sexy and cool supervisor at Moody's, who herself doesn't buy into romantic love. But Dante is determined to go. What he doesn't know is that this day has some life altering surprises in store for him. There, so much for the plot.

First of all, Kevin Smith's great strength is his ear for dialogue. Folks have already made mention of Smith's directing skills, or, rather, how little they've progressed ever since the first CLERKS. I happen to think he's a pretty decent filmmaker, but, I really believe the field in which he truly excels is writing. And I'm not talking about flowery diction and high-faluting prose. I'm talking about words from the gut, the real-life crap that people say or want to say as they go thru their day to day existence. CLERKS 2 revels in its playful but obscene riffs as much as it does in its theme of slackerhood and its tendencies for pop culture references. Whether the topic is sexual etiquette, the superiority of one cinematic trilogy over another, or the sensitive issue of standing still as life passes one by, Smith's words, as spoken by the film characters, are honest, sometimes vulgarly honest.

The humor in this film made me howl. It's not drawing board wit, no. The comedy is vintage CLERKS, ranging from scatological, to sexual, to racial, to just plain juvenile. Off the top of my head, the scenes where I laughed the longest and loudest are the LORD OF THE RINGS versus the STAR WARS trilogy debate, the ""porch monkey"" bit, and the donkey scene (or to quote the Sexy Stud: ""interspecies erotica"").

I have to say that Rosario Dawson helps greatly to elevate this movie from being merely an exercise in incessant hanging out and talking trash. She is sunny, winning, beautiful, and is a natural actress. You might wonder initially what draws her to a frumpy looking guy like Dante, but it's her attraction to such a normal guy - and even kind of a loser - that makes the movie work even better for me. Her Becky exudes such a level-headed yet whimsical personality that I thought, yes, she could actually fall for this numbnut, bless her heart. Their relationship nicely depicts how a good friendship could, in time, transform into something more. From the special features, I found out that Bryce Howard, Sarah Silverman, and Liv Tyler were wooed for the part of Becky. Frankly, I now find it hard to picture anyone but Dawson in that role, though I'm sure Liv wouldn't have been too shabby.

Brian O'Halloran as the quietly harried Dante is again effective here, but it is Jeff Anderson who shines brighter as the rude, crude, and irresponsible Randal. His moments with Dante while they were incarcerated near the movie's end are searingly real, raw, and heartfelt. And to think that Anderson, at first, had to be talked into doing this sequel. Jennifer Schwalbach Smith, in the thankless role of Emma, Dante's fiancee, manages to pull off a nice performance in her few scenes. Trevor Fehrman as the 19 year old, Lord of the Rings and Transformers fanatic, Elias, is a bit over the top, but funny enough (his Pillowpants bit is giggly funny). Meanwhile, Jason Mewes as Jay and the director himself as Silent Bob are back after spending six months in rehab (the characters, not the actors, though Mewes did have his drug problems) and remain amusing, as ever. It's nice to know that, though they continue to ply their drug dealing trade, they've at least found Our Savior, Jesus Christ. Cameos are also made by Smith regulars Ben Affleck and Jason Lee, and even Wanda Sykes pops in for a while, but not long enough to hurt the film.

The bonus features (of over six hours, as boasted on the dvd cover): disc one includes three film commentaries (the best one is the second commentary selection, which offers Smith and most of the cast), plenty of deleted scenes, and ""A Closer Look at Interspecies Erotica""; disc two has the engrossing hour and a half long behind-the scenes-look ""Back to the Well: Clerks 2,"" an extended blooper reel (which is mostly bland, excepting those takes with Rosario - yep, she got to me), and ""Trains Wrecks: Video Production Diaries"" (including Jason Lee's ""The Tongue Song""). Most of the special features come with the option of an intro by Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier.

This flick is low brow, vulgar to the extreme and, certainly, gasp inducing. But CLERKS 2 also has plenty of heart and, surprisingly, several sweet moments, which surface when you least expect it. Kevin Smith made this film as a fond salute to the slacker generation who adored the first CLERKS and also as an homage to his younger, more unsure self who was just starting out and who believed back then that more things seemed possible to achieve. CLERKS 2 is a movie about a day in the life of several ordinary folks, whose copious downtime, on the surface, is filled with nonsensical junk. But, when you get right down to it, these seemingly throwaway moments depict and define their lives, and, as such, they prove to be very real. I'm personally giving this one 5 stars, but, remember, I also liked JERSEY GIRL.",1167091200,10,6750,4.743611584327087
2650539,4,B000I0RNVQ,"Pretty easy review...

While ""Clerks II"" lacks the freshness, innovation, surprises and indie feel of ""Clerks"", there is still enough funny stuff to make it worthwhile.

The ""Star Wars vs. LOTR Geeks"" exchange is a riot, I still find Randal to be hysterical, Jay and Silent Bob rule, and the ""porch-monkey"" exchange had me rolling on the floor laughing.

Slow paced, same uninteresting characters, and most of all...NOT funny.",1166659200,6,180,5.0
2650541,4,B000I0RNVQ,"Just finished watching ""Clerks II"", and I am in a very good mood. The jokes are funny, the actors all did well, and the writer/director pulls out a win over moviemaking's toughest challenge: How To Make a Sequel.

Most sequels copy the original, and produce a faint and pointless experience (the ""Halloween""s, etc.) Some sequels compete with the original, going a ""whole new way"" and create a jarring and unsatisfying experience (""Exorcist II"" scarred me forever).

""Clerks II"" gets it right. It brings you back into the sphere of the first film and keeps the same smart/crude, bantering tone, but then responds to the questions and reactions raised by the original.

Example: the film tips its hat to the original's widely-respected triumph over an ultra-low-budget by opening in the same grainy black-and-white, same flat camera style, as Dante looks to once more live that same day we went through in ""Clerks I""... and throws open a door into an expensive color CGI shot of the destruction of the original's locale. It's a witty way both to acknowledge and to get us away from a technique that was smart in the first film but would have been tedious if repeated.

Bigger budgets can lead a sequel to ""feel"" so different that they totally lose connection with the original (""Blair Witch II""). Kevin Smith's excellent script keeps us anchored with familiar characters, situations and detail moments (life on the roof of the jobsite, painting toenails, etc.) but keeps us awake with surprising jolts(the Jackson 5 ""ABC"" dancing is a big one, Dawson coming through the fast-food window into Dante's car is a small one).

But the best thing about this story is the way it directly addresses all the reactions viewers might have had about ""Clerks"". It is affectionate to its characters and allows them to defend their points-of-view, but forces them to face their BS. Anderson does an especially good job of getting into the heart of what Randal is all about.

Don't get me wrong: this ain't ""Godfather II"" or even ""Aliens"", though it succeeds for many of the same reasons that made those sequels work. Get over the deliberate crudity and this is a funny and suprisingly warm and human flick.",1166313600,3,2189,4.870967741935484
2650542,5,B000I0RNVQ,"So, now I have received and devoured Clerks II. The region 1 version is, as one would expect from Kevin Smith, a treasurethrow of extra material, good deleted scenes, bloopers, little hidden gems and a long documentary.

The film as such was a real nice surprise. I was a little apprehensive, I worried he would go overboard on this, make a lot of fart and sticky jokes, as a reaction to Jersey Girl. As it turns ot, this is a return to the provocative humour, understated emotions and modern friendships of Chasimg Amy and not the forced 'gross out' factor of Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back.

That's no to say I didn't enjoy the latter, but everything has its time and place, and the title 'Clerks' does set the bar to a higher standard.
Something Kevin Smith seems to be fully aware of, and delivers.

This was a really fine film, I really enjoyed it, yes I had a COZY time!
Clerks II comes in as the best Kevin Smith film since Chasing Amy, and is a worthy bookend to the first Clerks. Our characters are brought to a harbour of sorts, and it just feels right, natural, un-forced.

If Smith chooses never to return to this universe, then this was a worthy conclution.",1166140800,,1171,4.432558139534883
2650543,5,B000I0RNVQ,"When I first heard that Kevin Smith was going to do a sequel to his 1994 black and white cult hit Clerks, I was not jumping for joy. Despite the fact that the 10th anniversary Clerks DVD sits proudly in my collection; Smiths slacker comedy following Dante and Randals usual yet unusual hours working at the Quick Stop convenience and RST Video stores was a movie that seemed of a time and a place. The early 90s after all was a funky time in pop culture containing Seinfeld, grunge rock and Pulp Fiction. There seemed to be the usual desire for something different from teenagers and young adults, but with the Internet still years away, all that existed was new takes on established forms of entertainment. Smiths low budget, blue language comedy fit perfectly into this world.

The timing of the announcement of Clerk II also seemed a little dubious after the failure of Jersey Girl. Having gone out on a limb with a movie removed from his usual assortment of potty-mouthed Jersey characters, Smith seemed to be retreating with Clerks II after seeing his last film swallowed up by the Bennifer fiasco. Any fans of Smith probably knows of is comment in his Evening With Kevin Smith DVD, filmed prior to Jersey Girls release, that important characters Jay and Silent Bob would never appear in another of his movies, they're in Clerks II.

I gradually accepted the movie was going to happen and knew as the release date for Clerks II approached I would see it in theatres at least once. I have since seen the film twice, a rare event in my life, as I was pleasantly surprised by Smith's choices of script and character development. Better than the original? No, Smith will always be tied to his first film, Clerks II is good enough however to be seen as its own accomplishment.

The story sees central characters Dante and Randal coming to work for another day at the stores only to be met by a fire burning down the only place of work the characters have seemingly known. Flash forward a year later and the two have simply slid over to fast food restaurant Moobys for their next job. Like the original, Clerks II centers around one day in the life of both characters, this day sees Dante one day away from leaving Jersey with is fiance Emma for Florida.

As in the original, Dante's issues with the women in his life and the choices he is not handling well are central to the story of Clerks II. We realize Emma likes Dante not because of his qualities but because of his inability to do anything exceptional, therefore he is the perfect teddy bear to be pushed into a life of her choosing. But instead of finding this sad, Dante seems to realize that giving a life in Florida a try is clearly a step up from his current station. Even as the story shows Dante may doubt the depth of his feelings for Emma, there is something commendable now about Dante's longings. In the original Dante was a whiner who couldn't take responsibility for his life. In the sequel he still can't make great decisions but he is willing to step up and give something a try. It may have taken 12 years, but it appears Dante is willing to take the dump he and Randal discussed in the first movie.

Equally as important as the elevating of Dante in Clerks II is the tearing down of Randal, a daring rebuke of the original. The wiseass who Dante once looked up to is now a cranky old man even though he has yet to turn 40. Randal is still full of rage unable to deal with people and therefore has to over rely on his friendship with Dante as it is his only real relationship. A scene where the two take a look at the burnt down remains of Quick Stop is revealing as while Dante is glad to have moved on, Randal looks at the charred remains with a longing that one day the store will return, as if he knows there is nowhere else he is going to succeed with his crusty demeanor. Randal is still funny in Clerks II, but there is an underlying sadness to him now. His picking on of a 19-year-old co-worker Elias feels tragic. Check out a scene where a successful old classmate of Dante and Randals walks into Moobys. Elias gets his business card after a quick offer of a potential venture, while Randal can do no better than engage in petty ridicule and lowbrow behaviour.

It is this flipping of Dante and Randal that makes Clerks II work as its own film. Dante is no longer envying Randals screw everybody mentality. As the story unfolds it is in fact Randal who has to elevate himself to keep him and Dante's friendship alive. This reinterpretation of the characters is what made the sequel as interesting as it challenges your original view of the two. Now for those who have yet to see the film let's just say that within the day of Clerks II, Dante decides not to go to Florida, the Quick Stop gets reopened and a donkey gets corn holed. But the film ends with a key point that is very much of its time; eventually everyone has to decide on a life or you may wind-up with no friends wearing a purple shirt serving something called a cow tipper.",1165881600,,5020,4.427489177489178
2650544,5,B000I0RNVQ,"Clerks was a severely low-budget movie that was big at Sundance as well as the movie market in general, creating somewhat of a cult status filmography with director Kevin Smith. After the disappointment(some of it unwarranted as it wasn't that bad) of Jersey Girl, Smith returned to the 2 characters that brought him the success but unlike most sequels where it seems like an obvious cash-in, and let's face it, this one at times felt like it going in, but it manages to be hilarious and even slightly better than the first one, if many on a laugh scale. The first one was great but at times unfunny but it had a certain novelty nostalgia, this one though is quite funny period.

Almost 10 years after we left Dante and Randal, the Quickstop has burned down prompting them to get jobs at Mooby's, a fast food chain with a cow theme modeled after McDonalds or Burger King. Jay and Silent Bob are back, however they're sober, but they're still dealing. Dante is getting married and moving to Florida which doesn't sit well with Randal. Adding complication is that Dante is falling in love more with his boss Becky. So Dante again finds himself between 2 girls and we get little vignettes of customers that Randal always tends to have a beef with.

Awhile ago I watched Kevin Smith's ""An Evening With ...2"" and while he's quite a talkative speaker and a very intelligent one, he was especially vulgar and profane. Now I have no issue of course with vulgarity or profanity, but it would be like seeing respected people swear up a storm and talking about sex acts. So of course we have the sequel to a film that brought us the knowledge of a ""snowball"" or having sex with a dead guy. Here it's actually worse. We get trolls that live in...women parts, the disdain for *** to mouth as well as a live adult show involving a human and...a donkey. The one thing though is that it does tread familiar ground: Randal and his new protege Elias get into a big riff about Lord of the Rings which recalls the discussion about Empire Strikes Back's ending or the Death Star II's construction.

What sets it apart from the first film however is an emotional core that's quite surprising. Dante's problem in the first one was that he didn't want to disrupt things if it was an inconvenience to him or others. In this film, he just goes along with things because that's what people expect of him or because it's easier. Randal however goes through the biggest change since not only is he losing his best friend but he does feel like there's nothing for him to achieve. Jeff Anderson probably has the best scene, acting-wise at the end where he goes into a big monologue about his life.

Is it better than the first one? At times. There's moments here that are way funnier than most of Clerks but other times things just don't really fit(such as a big dance number to an Abba song) but it's still a worthy sequel. Ugly box art though.",1165881600,,2914,4.513257575757576
2650545,5,B000I0RNVQ,"Finally! I have been saying for years that Kevin should just go ahead and make another Dante/ Randall movie as their characters from the first Clerks were two of the most fantastic people to ever share a distaste for serving the public. Dante's love problems of the first movie are dwarfed in comparo with the zany mess he's got himself in this time. This movie is absolutely mind blowing in it's delivery and although not as raw and gritty feeling as the first with it's style of delivery, Clerks 2 definitely delivers the goods on the Dante/ Randall friendship fiascos. Jay and Silent Bob are back where they belong, in the background and providing the occasional laugh jolts that were prevalent in the first movie. I absolutely love those guys but honestly, Kevin gave them overexposure in the rest of the movies in the askewniverse. I am not even going to discuss the plot which is so maniacally crazy at times and yet so real. This is one movie you cannot miss if you are a Kevin Smith fan (or even if you're not) Oh, and special features? this one's got an hour and a half making of featurette! Amazing!

Whereas the first film was mostly gross-out humor and pop culture references, Smith is older and wiser and his clerks are both feeling the passage of time, which deepens a movie that, at its heart, is still mostly gross-out humor and pop culture references.

2650550,5,B000I0RNVQ,"When Clerks was released in 1994, it was a new window into the world of Generation X. Its portrayal of two disillusioned, sarcastic, twenty-something counter jockeys in New Jersey soon became a cult classic, as audiences related to the angst of Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran), or just got a kick out of the irresponsible, smart-alecky Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson).

Now, it is 2006. Generation X has grown up and are beginning to approach middle age. Included are, of course, Dante and Randal, twelve years older. At the beginning of Clerks 2, they are still employed at the Quick Stop. However, when it burns down, the pair find work at a Mooby's - a fictional fast food restaurant - where they find new complaints about life, customers, and of course, some things I can't mention here (okay, one word - donkey).

Much of the movie is classic Kevin Smith. Star Wars references and language that is sure to offend your mother are here, and Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith, respectively) are also present, both characters now clean to reflect Mewes` real life sobriety, although the duo are still dealing. In addition to the comedy, however, this movie also deals with the theme of growing up, maturing, and figuring out what you want to do in life.

In the film, we learned that Dante is now engaged to Emma (Jennifer Schwalbach Smith, real-life spouse of Kevin Smith), a perky, domineering woman, who is taking him to Florida against his will to work at a car wash. However, when a past affair comes back to bite him, he must learn to face responsibility and make a decision.

New characters are included in this slice of Kevin Smith's Jersey Wasteland: Elias (Trevor Fehrman), the socially-awkward, dorky, religious boy that is the new butt of Randal's verbal abuse, and Becky (Rosario Dawson), the smart, sexy boss of Mooby's. Both characters fit in perfectly with the movie, with Elias being a springboard for mockery, and Becky playing as the voice of reason (or perhaps, sanity) between Randal's acid tongue and Dante's insecurity.

Annoying customers are, as in the original, present and ready to badger, including a cameo from Ben Affleck, Kevin Weisman as a Lord Of The Rings aficionado, and Wanda Sykes, in all her in-your-face glory.

Fans of the original Clerks will find plenty to love here, as Kevin Smith's unapologetic wit and rapid-fire sarcasm are present, but beneath it is also a tale of growing up, facing a mid-life crisis, and taking responsibility and deciding what it is you want to do in life, not what someone else wants you to do. This is a great movie, and is highly recommended for a great time on movie night, if you are not too easily offended. If you liked Clerks, then you will not be disappointed, for Clerks 2 serves up the goods.

It was just a series of disjointed scenes that aren't funny on their own, let alone put together into a whole movie.  And why start a love story 50 minutes into it?  No one cares.  Either stick to the no-plot theme or give the plot respect.  Don't hurry it along in the last half hour because you've spent the bulk of your time on female anatomy, animal abuse, and gay jokes.

2650552,5,B000I0RNVQ,"While a sequel really wasn't necessary, it was definitely a good move this time around, and very worth it.

I never really had my doubts, but I wasn't expecting this to essentially be the same style as the first one, minus the shoddy black and white camera (don't care about ""indie"" feels), though the title card saying ""The New Jay and Silent Bob"" was the only one in the entire movie, rather than the several from the first.

Nothing has softened with regards to language in this one, with lots of reference to sex, and an especially candid sequence of bestiality (no nudity shown, however) and dialogue reminiscent of the first one.

Leaving aside all the rest of that, the big difference between this one and the first one is heart.  This one has lots.

Dante is in love in this one, as he was in the first, and his predicament is actually much more tense in this one, but you're glad at least that his girlfriend doesn't have sex with a dead guy and go into a psychotic shock.

You get to see a new side of Jay and Silent Bob, with a new drug-free Jay (inspired by real-life Mewes' drug battle) still dealing drugs, and touting the bible (""Isn't that the f***ing bible?""  Jay: ""No!  It's the HOLY f***ing bible!"") with a new routine for Jay much funnier than singing about smoking weed---ever seen ""Silence of the Lambs""?

Randal finally shows some humanity, as one of his old rivals from high school really hurts him, and sends him to his theraputic retreat of driving gokarts in a sentimental scene which had me laughing not disparagingly, but in a sort of friendly way as though Randal were your own friend, or something.

The scene in the jail cell where Randal and Dante make up, like true friends, is also nice and lovey dovey etc.

Today I must be lightheaded or feeling stupid, because I haven't got much else to say that hasn't already been said.  Pay no attention to the people jabbering about the ""non indie feel"" and Smith ""selling out"" and such.  It's the same old Clerks.  With heart.",1165190400,3,2003,4.512465373961219

2650556,5,B000I0RNVQ,"Over a decade since Kevin Smith made his beloved indie debut with Clerks, the man has wisely gone back to his roots with the long awaited and eagerly anticipated sequel.  Clerks 2 finds Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randle (Jeff Anderson) in their thirties and working at local fast food joint Mooby's after the Quick-Stop gets burned down, and the slackers also find themselves at a crossroads.  Dante is about to embark on a trip to Florida to marry his longtime girlfriend (Smith's real life wife Jennifer Schwalbach) and leave New Jersey behind forever, much to the dismay of Randle and their boss Becky (Roasrio Dawson) who has a surprise of her own for Dante.  Yes it's in color and is a far departure from Smith's last film Jersey Girl (which was a departure from anything else Smith had done prior) and that is a good thing.  Clerks 2 both expands and pays homage to what Smith showed us in Clerks, with our slacker duo being as deadpan as ever.  The triumphant return of Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith) is also a main highlight here, even though Dante and Randle end up being more foul mouthed than either one is here.  The rest of the cast is great, particularly Anderson and Trevor Fehrman as the pious Lord of the Rings nerd who becomes the new object of Randle's taunting, and Smith regulars Ethan Suplee, Jason Lee, and even Ben Affleck make cameos.  By the time the film gets to the much talked about Donkey Show scene, you get the feeling that maybe Smith went a little overboard, but you'll be laughing in disgust too much to notice.  Like all of the other View Askew DVD's, Clerks 2 features a bevy of features, including a lengthy documentary on the history and making of the film, as well as multiple commentaries from Smith and co, and a hilarious and lengthy blooper reel to boot.  All in all, Smith may have gone back on his word of never bringing back Jay, Bob, and the rest of his ""New Jersey Trilogy"" universe, but when it's this funny, be glad that he did.",1165104000,,1991,4.523676880222841

2650560,5,B000I0RNVQ,"Clerks 2 should've never worked for a number of reasons.  After Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, it really seemed like Smith had milked the characters for all they were worth.  He then did the underated Jersey Girl, which was a good flick, though it had a glossy hollywood feel to it and some of Smith's charms just weren't there.  So I, like many other people, wasn't too thrilled when he announced Clerks 2.  But this one is good.  It has everything good about Kevin Smith and then some.

This film is right up there with Clerks and Chasing Amy as  my fave Smith films.  All three films capture  something I'd love to see more of from Smith - A great balance of witty dialogue laced with pop culture references and an emotional character driven story.  The three leads pull out all the punches to make this happen. Rosario Dawson, the newcomer to the foray, makes a relationship with Dante seem very believable, while Jeff Anderson is stealing the show, as usual.  His emotional final act is worth the price alone.  I seriously think no one can deliver Smith's dialogue like he can.

This is also Smith's best looking movie.  Bringing back David Klein as DP must've been the plus here.  He's now a more a seasoned DP, and he does a fantastic job.  Clerks II is a lot more colorful than his previous efforts.  There's a fine polished look to this film that should be respected from the 5 million dollar feature. There are some great shots in this film that really bring out the best of Smith - including a show stopping musical number and what I believe is one of the finest final shots in the film that beatifully recalls the first Clerks.

The DVD is chock full of extras.  Aside from three commentaries, there is a 90 minute documentary on the making of the film, some of the train wrecks that were online, and a heaping portion of outakes and deleted scenes.  The best of these is some improv done by Wanda Sykes and Earthquake.  They have some great lines in the film as is, but the amount of stuff taken out is just as hilarious.  Seeing it made me want to see more of them.

There isn't really anything detracting from the film or the DVD.  My only possible complaint is that Jennifer Schwalbach is never believable as a love interest for Dante.  I know part of that is the point, but she should still be able to convince us a bit better that she's in love with Mr. Hicks.  But it's a minor thing.

2650564,4,B000I0RNVQ,"It's difficult to match the classic genius known as ""Clerks"", a film in which writer/director Kevin Smith made his first big splash. However, ""Clerks 2"" has a few memorable moments of it's own, and continues the tradition of cleverly poking fun at everything and anything.

While ""Clerks"" was filmed as a low-budget black and white independent film, ""Clerks 2"" obviously has a much larger budget (i.e. Rosario Dawson), but bigger is not necessarily better. The writing and dialogue definitely smacks of classic Kevin Smith wit and satire, but it just can't seem to transcend to the level of the original.

QUICK SYNOPSIS: The film continues the story of Dante and Randall as they both find themselves thirty-somethings and working at a Mooby's fast-food restaurant after an unfortunate accident causes the Quick Stop to burn down. Dante is about to get married and move to Florida with his fiance, but he's having second thoughts when he discovers he also has feelings for his Mooby's manager. Meanwhile...Jay and Silent Bob continue to hang out outside the establishment of Dante and Randall's employment.

Most people know Kevin Smith as ""Silent Bob"", the quiet but expressive side-kick to Jay. Many of the actors/friends of Smith's from the Clerks/Mallrats/Chasing Amy/Jay & Silent Bob franchise make a brief cameo appearance, including Ben Affleck, Jason Lee, Kevin Weissman, and even Kevin Smith's wife (whom most would know as the hot red-headed diamond thief from ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"").

Thankfully, Kevin Smith is one of the few directors who put just as much effort into making great DVD features as he does making the actual film. Kevin Smith fans will not be disappointed with the 6 hours of special features found on this double-disc DVD! There are 3 different audio-commentaries, 2 very extensive behind-the-scenes/making of featurettes, and an enormous slew of deleted and extended scenes (each of which is preceded by Kevin and Jason, who explain why the scene was altered or cut, before finally showing the deleted scene. It does take longer to view it that way, but I think it's a cool feature because there have been countless times I've watched a DVD's deleted scenes, and seen one or two that I thought were really good, and I couldn't figure out why they would cut it!).

While I still feel the original ""Clerks"" was priceless, ""Clerks 2"" manages to find wings and fly on it's own. It's definitely worth the purchase for die-hard Kevin Smith fans!",1164412800,,2480,5.009708737864078

It was amazing to watch something that was able to actually take me to another time. Dante and Randall looed older, of course, but other than that it was as if the first movie just kept going and evolved into another story. It was deeper than the first movie, but that's the way life is, anyways. It's more complicated at 30 than it was at 20.

I could have done without some of the gross parts (like the donkey) but I loved the movie! I also thought the soundtrack was great! I have always been a Kevin Smith fan (with a couple exceptions like Jersey Girl and Dogma), and this one is right up there with the best! I have always thought he was talented and his movies were fun, but with Clerks 2 I actually left the theater with a huge appreciation of his talents and his ability to recreate a place and time.

2650567,3,B000I0RNVQ,"Clerks 2 certainly has its moments.  Fans have waited a long time to see a follow-up to Kevin Smith's smash indie hit and its arrival was definitely worth waiting for.  Ten years later, the Quick Stop burns down and Dante and Randal find another slacker job at the Mooby's fast food franchise.  New characters include responsible and sexy manager Becky, awkward supergeek co-worker Elias, and Dante's questionable fiance Emma.  Jay and Silent Bob are back of course, having just finished a stint in rehab and turned their lives over to Jesus.  This promising premise however, is not without a few flaws.

The banter between the co-workers is the highlight of the film, conservative Dante still the perfectly opposite companion for outspoken jerk Randal.  Memorable dialogues are borne, including those on a particular sexual taboo, messing with the handicapped, the transformers, and a debate of Star Wars vs. Lord of the Rings (and that's just the first half).  There's also a short dance number and an improved use of camera angles that heighten the intensity of some scenes.  Clerks 2 has a similar feel to its predecessor, and obviously if you already like Smith's movies, you'll have little problem with the vulgar content which often make the scenes that much more hilarious.  Toward the end, Smith finds a subtle balance between the most tasteless and most touching moments of the film and the conclusion is quite logical.  Overall, it's well cast with a few cameos of familiar faces from previous View Askew ventures, and fortunately, none of them steal unwanted screen time like Will Ferrell's character did in Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back.  But even with all this, how well does Clerks 2 compare to Smith's entire body of work?

Smith's efforts have each had their own identity while still keeping his trademark goofiness intact.  All of them epitomized the use smart dialogue, had great characterization, and also employed a dramatic element that gave them deeper meaning.  One major complaint I have for Clerks 2 is the slapstick aspect that also marred Mallrats.  Smith should know by now that his fans have come to expect cleverness instead of forced sight gags that remind us we're watching a movie.  Elias trying to run away with his headset on is one example.  (On the other hand, Jay's Buffalo Bill moment is very funny.)  Secondly, some of the jokes just don't work because they feel incomplete, like Smith indended to add more to the end of a scene and then didn't do it.

Despite these problems, Clerks 2 is good and I'm sure audiences will be quoting and referrencing it for a long time.  This being the sixth Jay & Silent Bob movie, I wonder if it might be the last now that the series has come full circle.  If so, Clerks 2 is still a fittingly fabulous final installment I highly recommend.",1159142400,4,2815,4.820833333333334

The movie picks up ten years after ""Clerks"" (1994) where Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson) are still working at the Quick Stop convenience / video rental store in New Jersey.  Dante arrives at work one morning and finds the place ablaze (presumably because Randal left the coffee pot on).  With the Quick Stop indefinitely closed, the pair ventures into the corporate world by working at the fast food restaurant Mooby's.

There are plenty of things happening at Mooby's.  Dante, who's come to the conclusion that he doesn't want to be a thirty-something year-old man working at a fast food joint, is engaged to the overzealous Emma (Jennifer Schwalbach; real life wife of director, writer and Silent Bob, Kevin Smith).  We're also introduced to Becky (Rosario Dawson), the manager of Mooby's and the woman who has a special friendship with Dante.  Could it be love?  There's also the somewhat naive Elias (Trevor Fehrman), the co-worker that Randal likes to torture, who's heavily into The Transformers, Lord of the Rings and religion.  And we can't forget about Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob who are now hanging around outside of Mooby's.  The duo has just gone through rehab, found religion and are still selling pot!

In ""Clerks II"", it's Dante's last day working at Mooby's.  He's set to move to Florida with Emma where they'll live with her parents and he'll have a job at the family's Car Wash.  (She's also set a wedding date without telling Dante first.)  While to get through the day relatively unscathed, (a hard task to do when there are customers and Randal), Dante learns that Becky is pregnant, the result of an after-work encounter the two had a few weeks earlier.  Will this be the one thing that ruins Dante's plans?

Meanwhile, Randal, has been on a tear.  Not only has he been harassing Elias but there are plenty of customers to contend with as well.  Fortunately, he's completely dedicated to one thing:  sending Dante off with a ""BANG"" by throwing him a party with an extra special surprise guest!

While some sequels are hit or miss when compared to the original movie, ""Clerks II"" is a definite hit!  There are plenty of reasons to like this movie.

""Clerks II"", like the first movie, is dialogue driven.  The characters are all relatable, funny and likeable and each one (whether in a major role or cameo appearance) steals the scene in his or her own way.  Randal, was particularly funny in several scenes including:  Elias' discussion about ""Pillow Pants"" and the argument with Elias and a customer (played by Kevin Weisman) over which was better, Star Wars or Lord of the Rings.  Randal's argument?  In addition to a funny interpretation of the Rings movies, he quips ""...there is only one ""return"" and it's not of the king, it's of the Jedi.""  Jay and Silent Bob aren't to be outdone either.  Besides appearing with bows in their hair during a dance sequence, there's also on homage to Silence of the Lambs when Jay imitates the ""Buffalo Bill"" dance to ""Goodbye, Horses"" (one can hope that the dance, in its entirety will make it to DVD).

The cameos with Ben Affleck and Wanda Sykes were funny as well as Jason Lee who played an old school ""chum"" of Randal's and Dante's who was renowned for one infamous event.  Lee's ""My Name is Earl"" co-star Ethan Suplee also made an appearance with one of Jay and Silent Bob's clients!

While the movie has an ample supply of comedy, there is still a human element to the story.  Despite things that he might say or do, we realize that Randal values the friendship he has with Dante and would be lost without him.  Dante also realizes that it's time to make decisions for himself.

The only thing I would have liked to have seen differently in the movie is maybe a shorter dance sequence.  I also thought the ""inter species"" routine could have been shorter.  While funny in some parts, it seemed to drag on a little long.  But these are only very minor things!

""Clerks II"" is one of the funniest films from Kevin Smith.  Is it for everyone?  No.  A few moviegoers will definitely be turned off by some of the crude humor.  But to see the continuing adventures of Dante, Randal, Jay and Silent Bob, it's a definite must-see.  I also recommend staying through the credits.  There's some funny stuff written in there as well as a Jay and Silent Bob cartoon at the end!",1158537600,2,4496,4.662849872773537

2650571,2,B000I0RNVQ,"I am really astounded at the ooey-gooey reviews of this movie that run down the page.  I don't need a repeat viewing to know that ""Clerks 2"" lacks the power, magic, and acidic/slacker/punk feel of the original.  It has nothing to do with being an indie film or not, either: it's just a bad movie.  Even my favorite character, the misanthropic, no BS Randall Graves couldn't save it.

A disjointed mess of sugary sentimentality (what the hell is that doing in a ""Clerks"" movie?), plot holes big enough to drive a truck through, and Smith's abandonment of the tight-knit, dark sarcasm of the first film in favor of pure potty mouth ""Larry the Cable Guy"" type humor make this one an almost unbearable failure.

He rips the anonymous magic away from Randall and Dante and leaves them in meandering, pointless scenes that have potential and then descend into boring vulgarity (for example, when their high school foe dubiously associated with pickles comes in: THAT should have been a great scene and it just sucked).  It's as though he's always approaching the part where things getting drop dead sick funny and he just never manages it.  Seeing Jay and Silent Bob dance to ""ABC"" by Michael Jackson was the final nail in the coffin.

This does have a few redeeming factors and scenes (the cementing of Randall and Dante's friendship), but it's meant to be a preview more than a full length movie.  I'd just like to forget they ever made this and re-watch the first one.",1155254400,6,1465,4.69140625

2650573,5,B000I0RNVQ,"It has a been a decade since Dante Hicks and Randle Graves pulled one of those heartless 12 plus hour shifts at the Quick Stop convenient store and RST Video Rental, a day where they played hokey on the store roof, crashed a funeral, having a man die in the store restroom, Dante lost two possible girlfriends, and finally ending on an up lifting fight.

Now it's 2006 and where are our lazy, smack talking clerks? The exact same place they where twelveish years ago, still standing behind the counter, still talking back to the customers...or would be if Randle hadn't left the coffee pot on that accidentally burnt the store down.

So what do skill less, unmotivated, star war nerds do? Do they buck up go to collage and get real jobs, do they settle dawn and start families...?

It won't be a Kevin Smith film if they did. Dante and Randle go to another soulless job,  working at the Askew universe's  Mooby's fast food chain.

However things for Dante are actually looking up in his life. He's engaged, his future father-in-law offers him a management job. HOWEVER, Randle is not happy to see his best friend skipping out on him, and he's not the only reason that could keep him in Jersey, his boss has surprising to lay on him.

Good sequels are a hard thing to make, and Kevin Smith succeeded where so many have failed, What makes this sequels stand up is that Kevin did the same thing with his first movie only he expanded on it, Dante and Randle still have long and pointless conversations about pop culture and sex, at the same time dealing with annoying customers, but looming over them is that both our main characters are no longer young. They're in their 30s, a time when we are suppose to have found our place in the world, but Dante and Randal haven't (or have they).

Dante spent more then ten years trying to escape who he is, trying to fall into the rest of normal society, get an education, get married, get a ""real job"" and settling down. He blames him failing on Randle, it took Dante a night in a jail cell to realize that his future and who he loves is right at his feet, that Randal is not the result of his failings but may actually be his salvation.",1154736000,,2175,4.42
2650574,4,B000I0RNVQ,"This movie goes way beyond the first movie which seemed to be a melange of separate skits in the Quick Mart.  This movie focuses on Dante's upcoming marriage to his girlfriend.  As he ponders leaving his job at a fast food restaurant and moving to Florida with his dominaneering fiancee, his friends decide to make his last day extremely memorable.

With his work girlfriend (Rosario Dawson) throwing out hints to him throughout that she may be more suited to him and his best friend telling him to stop blaming everybody for his problems.

Jay and Silent Bob are more outrageous than ever in some of their stunts and Dante's friend says things that would make the most hardened criminal blush.  All in all, the movie is loaded with quite a few deep belly laughs.  The movie will have you saying to your self several times, ""I can't believe he just said that!""",1154563200,,860,4.625
2650575,4,B000I0RNVQ,"Clerks II is stupendously profane, dangerously sacrilegious, cheerfully racist, aggressively puerile, and peopled wall to wall with morons. There truly is, in the words of one cast member, something here to offend every taste. And that's before the donkey scene.

I can't wait to buy it on DVD.

How can a film with such unrelenting bad taste be, well, endearing? Ask writer/director Kevin Smith, who has made a career out of elevating cretinism to critically-appreciated cinematic art. Beginning with his $27,000 breakout feature, the original Clerks, Smith has used his films to immortalize a succession of suburban New Jersey losers, in all their defiant (and deviant) glory.

In Clerks, he chronicled a day in the life of Dante Hicks and Randal Graves, twenty-something slacker buddies who work in two different sections of a cheesy convenience store called the Quick Stop. Ten years later, in the prologue of Clerks II, Randall and Dante are still showing up to work at the Quick Stop - but this morning they find that it's burned down overnight. ""Terrorists?"" Randal asks, and Dante doesn't answer. Then, realization dawns. ""I left the coffee pot on again, didn't I?"" Dante nods.

A year later, the guys are employed at a fast food restaurant called Mooby's, where Randal delights in tormenting Elias, a young born-again Christian and Lord of the Rings fanatic. But Dante, after ten years of drifting, has set his sights higher. Soon he will marry Emma, a kind, attractive, and success-oriented woman. In just one more day, they will be moving to Florida, where Dante will manage a car wash owned by Emma's father. Finally he has someone who really loves him, finally he's moving forward like he has always wanted to do. He should be happy, right?

But as the movie meanders along between abusive (and abuse of) customers, rooftop dance lessons, movie trilogy comparisons and other distractions, Dante comes to realize that there are things about his crappy strip-mall existence that he doesn't want to lose. As the day moves toward it's rollicking climax, it becomes more and more apparent that, for a guy who has always hated making decisions, Dante has a very big one to make.

I liked this movie a lot. I think Kevin Smith has a great ear for the way real people interact - with boasts, circumventions, half-admissions, casual cruelties, and random whimsical weirdness. Brian O'Halloran, as the fastidious Dante, and Jeff Anderson as his feckless sidekick, are brilliant in a totally nimrod kind of way. They are ably backed up by supporting players Rosario Dawson and Jennifer Schwalbach, as well as the dynamic duo of Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and director Smith), who appear as the knucklehead chorus in most of Smith's films. Trevor Fehrman is especially savory as the earnest and oft-victimzed Elias.

That being said, I think this movie is probably not as good as its prequel. Clerks was such an oddball sensation that it jump started the indie film movement of the 90s almost by itself. It's not fair to expect the follow-up to have the same kind of fresh impact, and it doesn't. Moreover, the familiar advisory ""this is not a movie for everyone"" goes double (maybe triple) for Clerks II. If you're uncomfortable with profanity, easily offended when fundamentalism is mocked, or more-than-usually queasy on the subject of what one of the characters terms ""inter-species erotica"" - well, you probably shouldn't even be in the same zip code as this movie.

But having a fairly strong stomach for such things, I guess, I found the movie to be all in all a worthy sequel to Clerks. While the characters and the banter aren't new, they have a bit more heft and a pleasant familiarity; and this time the story arcs to a resolution more satisfying than that of the original.

In another decade, I wouldn't mind checking in on Randal and Dante again.",1154304000,3,3865,4.906584992343032
2650576,5,B000I0RNVQ,"I'm sure many were worried when Kevin Smith had announced plans to make a sequel to his classic 1994 debut, ""Clerks."" After the failure of ""Jersey Girl,"" a movie that stepped out of the realm of the self-created ""View Askewniverse,"" it seemed almost as if Kevin was desperate, out of ideas, and was simply going back to the well with a safe movie. Hell, it's been 12 years since the original movie, why wait so long to do a sequel? Well, all worries are cast aside, because in typical Kevin Smith fashion, ""Clerks II"" is a unique and multi-layered film. Think of all that has happened since 1994, and you can sort of imagine what the tone of this movie, ""Clerks II,"" is like.

Here we have two loveable slackers in Dante and Randal, who are now in their mid-thirties, still doing dead end, meaningless work for as little pay as possible. They say high school never ends, and for these two, that could never be more true. Not much, if anything, has changed for these guys. Until one morning Dante opens up shop at the Quick Stop, only to find the ""Hell-Hole"" appropriately engulfed in flames. So, a location change is in order, and the duo set off the find work at the local Mooby's, a fast-food chain. Dante finds pleasure in working with his boss, Becky (played by Rosario Dawson), and Randal finds equal pleasure in tormenting his awkward teenage co-worker (Dante's understudy) Elias (Trevor Fehrman), who just so happens to hold good Christian morals. Hilarity ensues. ""Clerks II"" packs a lot into an hour and thirty minutes. From huge laughs, to surprisingly sentimental moments, how could any fan not love this movie? So many classic lines and moments (Pillow-pants) combined with loads of nostalgia and in-jokes, it's enough to make the average Kevin Smith fan well-up with pride.

""Clerks II"" is, in so many words, a big present to the fans. Those who have watched the original countless times will be rewarded by this movie (I know I felt pretty connected with this movie and even got a bit emotional at parts), which happens to carry what is, in my estimation, the most satisfying ending in the history of cinema. Kevin Smith has truly outdone himself. ""Clerks II"" is equal parts hilarious, poetic and cathartic. Just as it should be. When someone around you happens to say ""sequels suck"" or ""sequels are never as good as the original,"" you have this to throw in their face.",1153958400,6,2383,4.684964200477327
2650577,4,B000I0RNVQ,"About 10 minutes in, I was worried.

The original Clerks has a unique feel to it--a different feel than any Kevin Smith movie to come after it--and it seemed like Clerks II was desperate to recapture that feel, at any cost. I was worried that Smith would simply stick Dante and Randal into the same kinds of situations, spouting the same dialogue, but that it would all ultimately feel forced. Fake. In the same sort of way that Ghostbusters II tried and tried to find the magic of the original, but failed.

I needn't have worried.

Kevin Smith actually managed to recapture the feel of the original Clerks, and a fair amount of its magic (though some of that magic came from 1) its utter originality and 2) its independent, fringe nature, neither or which are currently available). Also, this isn't just a retread; it has new things to say about the characters, and advances the saga in a logical way to a satisfying conclusion.

As with all things Kevin Smith, there is a little bit of over-the-top gratuity (did we *really* need to see Jay strike the Silence of the Lambs/Buffalo Bill pose?), but also a fair amount of the wit that makes his writing so special. Perhaps the big surprise is how well O'Halloran and Anderson can act. Or maybe it's just Smith's directing?, but it remains that their performances are very strong.

Fans of the original Clerks (of which I'm one) will not be disappointed by this follow-up. It's not an indie classic this time, perhaps, but still a good movie reflecting some of the skill that Smith has picked up in the decade since the first film. Worth watching and fun.",1153872000,,1605,4.617543859649123
2650578,3,B000I0RNVQ,"The other night my wife and I drove two and a half hours to meet some old  friends for dinner.  We hadn't spoken in some time so it was great reminiscing about old times, waxing poetic about the memories and experiences that profoundly changed our lives, and laughing at jokes that only we as old friends would have remembered.  It was probably the most fun I've had in a long time. I bring this up only because it was going through my head as I sat and watched Kevin Smith's CLERKS II.  A film that's more of a reunion, a chance to return to a simpler time, and unfortunately  a swan song to a bygone era.

I can't believe it's been over a decade since we've checked in on Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson).  They've continued working at the Quick Stop and the crappy video store, but alas as the film opens we watch as it is all destroyed by fire.  With few prospects, and little motivation for anything better the guys get jobs at Mooby's, the local fast food restaurant,  slinging burgers, fart jokes, and pop-culture references with reckless abandon.  Above all,  things haven't changed that much.

That is until Dante decides to get engaged and move to Florida to run one of his father-in-law's car washes.  On this eve of extreme change, Dante must come to grips with leaving his friends, giving up on unrequited love, and convincing Randal that the term ""porch monkey"" is a racial slur.  Of course he has help, Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) are around for the fun, as well as his new boss Becky (Rosario Dawson), and Elias (Trevor Fehrman) a LORD OF THE RINGS fanboy that will forever be the butt of Randal's cruel jokes.  By the end of Dante's last day of work jokes will be told, various people will be offended, and a donkey will be..... oh never mind.

How does one sum up CLERKS II?  Yes it's funny, of course it's offensive, but at its heart it is syrupy sweet.  That is how Kevin Smith gets away with it.  Every single movie he has made (well except for Jersey Girl)  could easily be called perverse, offensive, and disgusting.  But because Smith wraps it all up with a gooey sentimental center he gets away with it.  Like a monkey that s throws its feces at passerby's, all it has to do is smile, do a little trick, and we instantly forgive him.

But what is missing from this film is a sense of freshness.  CLERKS II's  weakness is in that it's only geared at us kids who watched CLERKS in our basements and laughed along.  Most newcomers will probably not give into the sense of nostalgia that the film brings along with it.  There is nothing in this film for a mass audience.  As much as I loved the adventures of Dante and Randal, Jay and Silent Bob, and Kevin Smith as director it's almost as if we have presented us with a great family reunion but not an original film.

Kevin Smith is a talented writer and a genuine guy, but isn't it time he move on and try something more challenging?  Isn't it time to put Jay and Silent Bob away and create a new batch of characters.  I can't believe that in twelve years the only thing he has to show for it is two slackers in the Quick Stop.

Okay, I'll stop bashing now and mention that there are some great things in this movie for sure.  Smith still has knack for comedy and timing.  Trevor Fehrman's turn as Elias, the innocent Christian boy forced to take Randal's constant torture steals the movie.  He has this innocent and plucky resiliency the keeps you rooting for him.  His conversation about Pillow Pants, a troll who lives in his girlfriends nether regions, will having you rolling because his commits every inch of his being into making you sympathize with him .  I also appreciated his mid film team up with Kevin Weisman.  Hell hath no fury s two Lord of the Rings fans scorned.  I also like that Smith kept everything interesting.  He keeps it loaded to the brim with enough  silly cameos, funny laughs, and even a song and dance sequence that will keep a smile on your face.

For fans of the ""View Askew Universe"" CLERKS II is a nice trip down memory lane.  But it also feels more like a swan song grasping for a time not so long ago when a groups of guys armed with a camera and a little money changed the face of independent film forever. As you plop down your hard earned money in a vane attempt to channel the day twelve years ago you first discovered CLERKS remember you can try to relive the past,  but its just not the same.",1153872000,2,4448,4.378510378510379
2650579,5,B000I0RNVQ,"This was actually a great sequel to the original clerks.  It kinda starts out in black in white just like the original, then like in wizard of oz, continues mostly in colour.  The colour comes in when the quick stop is burning down....so yeah with disaster comes colour like in wizard of oz.  Randal and Dante are as hysterical as ever.  I myself can relate to these guys as I've been in similar job scenarios myself.  A couple of new characters, Elias and Dantes female boss whom he's having a fling with (same unmonogamous Dante), were really good and well thought additions to the list of characters already hailed and loved by fans.  Jay and Silent Bob are cleaning up so this has potential for some really funny situations.  I really thought this would be a sellout like jay and silent bob strikes back but I was really impressed by how the whole movie kept the emotion and feelings of its original counterpart.  The only difference was the colour presentation instead of black and white.  The end of the movie was hysterical and ends with a most appropriate song ""Misery"" by Soul Asylum.

This was a worthy follow up the original and all the characters are back.  ""Clerks"" fans will not be disappointed, this has all the witty and in your face dialogue along with the lovable Randall (my favorite character) along with Dante, and Jay and Silent Bob. New to the movie is Rosario Dawson  They could have killed this flick ""Clerks II Randall's Revenge"" as Jeff Anderson is in this movie in the most and his character really dominates the movie.  The sarcastic, and unapologetic Randall is at his best here when he's let loose and he does so in the movie.

The Quick stop is burned to the ground so Randall , Dante and their friend have to work at a fast food joint called the Mooby's (complete with a Moo sound as customers walk in).

One of my favorite scenes had to be Randall confronting the internet millionaire egotist named as Lance Dowds (played by Smith regular Jason Lee now experiencing network success with funny ""My Name is Earl""). This scene is wonderful and is full of the crude humor , slacker attitude and irony that makes the ""Clerk' franchise so memorable.  Smith manages to integrate even a little drama in the film taking into the fact that the characters are trying to grow up or least wake up to the reality that time is passing them by and perhaps it's time for them to be responsible.

This is great funny follow-up to the original. Smith never has lost his audience and he still knows how to bring great comedy to the masses when the time comes.",1153785600,5,1710,4.455128205128205

2650582,4,B000I0RNVQ,"This movie was one of the best that I have seen in a long time.  First I would like to think that Kevin Smith was pressing to make this movie 90 minutes long.  THANK YOU!  Who told directors and other movie makers that longer means better?  Pirates II was a good movie but I did fall asleep.  Spiderman II?  Don't get me started on The Lord of the Rings (notice I didn't use the trilo... word).  So much stuff could have been cut out of these movies and made them less of a chore to sit through.

Clerks II seems to be a lot more accessable than the first.  The movie is not in black and white as the first.  Great choice for the first but b&w seems to put off a lot of people right from the start.  The jokes in Clerks II are more straight up and not quirky like in the first.  What's funnier than a 40 year old virgin?  A nineteen year old one that believes in Pillow Pants.  This is the first movie that I laughed hard at in a long time.  The writing was great.  What else are a couple of 30+ year olds who work in a fast food restaurant going to talk about?  Heck, I run into dead enders in my job that are just like Randal and Dante.  The discussion are simplistic, unimportant and crude.  Just like their lives.

The acting has much improved from the first movie.  I watched the first one a couple of days ago and it still sounds like all the actors are reading from scripts.  O'Halloran wasn't brilliant but he was better.  Anderson was great.  I have to wonder what order they filmed the movie in because it seemed that Anderson's acting got better as the movie went on.  It got to the point where it didn't seem like he was delivering lines and he was actually speaking from the heart about his only friend Dante.

Jay and Silent Bob were great.  Back to being side characters passing by for quick moments of comic relief.  It appeared like Smith was setting Bob up for another speech a la Chasing Amy (which was appropriate in that movie) and, well, I got nothing. ;)

This movie like his others is about dialog.  Listening to the inane things that the chracters are talking about actually rings true when you look at what people talk about you in your own work place.  Randal's take on the best friend's girlfriend is dead on.

If you aren't a Kevin Smith fan or you don't even know who he is wait until this one comes out on DVD and rent it.  Take a chance you will probably like this one.  Then take a shot at Clerks, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy.  They may surprise you.  I don't see how movies like Dumb and Dumber, Napoleon Dynamite, 40 Year Old Virgin, Old School, and the Wedding Crashers can have a large fan base but Clerks II can't.  It is more accessable than you think.  BTW this movie is in no way for kids but there is nothing wrong with an adult comedy.",1153699200,5,2776,4.197343453510436

First thought is, Man, this movie will ruin the first one as a horribe sequel watering down characters and draging out stale storyline, WRONG.  This movie was as true evolution and natural course to the first, unbelieveable. The story managed to stay fresh, the jokes were over the top funny, and the characters never got tiresome.

2650585,5,B000I0RNVQ,"After waiting all of these years since Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back for another View Askew movie, my prayers are finally answered with Clerks 2. This film was worth the wait because it wasn't just hysterically funny, but much like Chasing Amy, this movie just has heart as well. The story is very compelling and relevant to those who are around the same age as Dante and Randal, who are the main characters of the film. That is why these films are so great, they relate so much to the way I and others feel.

There is plenty of emotion in this movie. You will laugh like you haven't done in years, but the movie also does a great job at pulling the heart strings and brings a new level to the story with emotion that is truly heart felt and sincere. Jay and Silent Bob return yet again and are in the movie about as long as they were in the original Clerks, and every minute spent with those two is never wasted and is really funny. The new characters Becky and Elias fit really well into the already established universe of Kevin Smith's and feel as if they are real and have been around in the other films, it is a comfortable fit. You don't spend the movie wondering where these new people came from, but it works really well into the story.

Overall, this is a must see movie. It will bring you back all the way to the original movie at the end and nostalgia begins to really sink in. As it ended, I couldn't help but almost shed a tear because this truly has been a great experience and these movies have related to me so well. It is a good closure to the world of Kevin Smith's, but if one day Kevin decides to make another film, I don't think fans will try and stop him.

There are many great special features, but I decided to talk just about one instead giving long speeches about all of them.

Clerks 2: Back to the Well

This 90 minute documentary is a very personal ""making of"" that starts from the beginnings of Clerks 2 in 2001 after Kevin said he was finished with the View Askewniverse and the documentary ends after the premiere weekend. Like the movie itself, this documentary will suck you in and listen to every word that is said. And when it is over, it will leave you wanting to see and hear more.

There are interviews with the actors and behind the scenes people who all worked on this film. Out of all of documentaries I have seen on movies that deal with filming, this is definitely probably the best I have seen. What makes this documentary so good and apart from others is that it doesn't just have jokes and how scenes were filmed, but it goes into the mind and thoughts of Kevin Smith. You hear of his wanting to do this movie for years and see it get accomplished. Then you see how nervous he really was before his film debuted at Cannes and it goes on to being a big hit. This is just a very detailed documentary that fans will love to watch and is so good, it could be sold separate and I would have bought it. It is really well made. Be sure to stay tuned to the end of the credits on the documentary to see a cute small bit with Kevin talking to his daughter. Like I said, this is a very personal story and a very fun documentary I know I will be watching again.",1153699200,,3200,4.203583061889251
2650586,5,B000I0RNVQ,"there's not much to say about this movie.  it's just ridiculously entertaining and much better than anything else kevin smith has put out since the turn of the century.  a surprisingly well-made followup to the original.  of course, it still has some of the bad acting (although i thought rosario dawson did great), but it's sort of nice to know that the original cast hasn't really aged in the past 12 years.  any problems you had with the first one probably lingered over into this, but long-time fans of ""the clerks"" definately won't be disappointed.",1153526400,2,553,4.7894736842105265
2650587,4,B000I0RNVQ,"taken as a movie in and of itself it is funnier than most stuff i see in the theaters nowadays. that's probably a good summary for how i felt about this movie.

that said... i think this overcapitalizes on the elements that made clerks such a success. same basic plot, same basic dialogue, same characters. there wasn't enough about this movie that made it stand on its own. as expected, plenty of cameos from the usual cast of characters to give the old fans reasons to cheer (much akin to chewbacca making a completely meaningless appearance in the star wars prequel). the thing i wish smith kept that he didn't was starting each section with a title (i.e. jay and silent bob- new & improved).

here's my list of his movies i've seen from best to worst in my opinion:

chasing amy

clerks

mallrats

clerks ii

dogma

jay & silent bob strike back

2650588,5,B000I0RNVQ,"""Clerks 2"" won't solve the world's problems, in fact it may create a few more, which is better Star Wars or Lord Of The Rings? Is ATM really wrong? How bad is Transformers? These topics are discussed at length in the film. The plot is pretty simple, it's ten years after the first Clerks movie and things haven't really changed, except the Quick Stop has burned down and Dante & Randall now work at Mooby's. Jay & Silent Bob are back standing outside, Jay does his ""Silence Of The Lambs"" impression, which will have you wincing, but followed by a laugh. The guys stand around talking about cartoons, movies and sex. It's a fun movie. It reminds me of the conversations my buddies and I get into. If you're going into the movie expecting some life changing experience, forget it. It's not about that, it's just 24 hours in the life of some thirty-somethings. If you've ever been able to relate to Kevin Smith's characters, as I have, you'll like this movie. But if Jay & Silent Bob annoy you, so will this.",1153526400,4,1005,4.497267759562842
2650589,5,B000I0RNVQ,"Clerks II was one of the awesomest movies ever and it appealed to me on may different levels.

1) The soundtrack rocked. All of the music fit with the scenes (the ""ABC"" scene rocked!) and it was great to hear music I remember in a movie.

2)It was hilarious....There are too many times to count when I laughed out loud in the theater (and those around me did too) and I don't usually burst out in movies.

3)The story itself touched me in that I've had a personal experience with getting a woman pregnant, not meaning too, and Kevin Smith really brought that kind of situation into light the way it happens in real life. Kudos!

4)The acting was spectacular! Brian O'Halloran (Dante) and Jeff Anderson (Randall) did an awesome job as well as Rosario Dawson (Becky)!!

What an all around good movie (for those of age)!",1153526400,,817,4.530612244897959
2650590,5,B000I0RNVQ,"It's hard to believe that it's been 12 years since Clerks first made its way onto movie screens with its Black-and-white Laden, Foul Mouthed view of life. As with most sequels I myself had many reservations before seeing Clerks II. There's always the initial questions. Is it going to capture the magic of the first? Will it ruin the whole series? Will I even like it? And I can answer all three of those very easily for you, especially if you love Clerks. YES. It's amazing how Smith was still able to portray life much of the same way as he did in the original film, and still make it interesting and true for all involved.

(*The movie begins 10 years after the initial film took place.) Much in the vein of the last film, Clerks II begins with Dante heading to the Quickstop in the morning to open up for business for the day (this time there's no gum in the locks). What he discovers is that the Quickstop is on fire, and is eventually destroyed leaving both himself and Randal without Jobs. Fast-forward a year to where Dante and Randal are now working at the fictional ""Mooby's"" (Dogma anyone?), a fast food chain similar to McDonald's but with all its menu items named after Cow puns. Despite the change of scenery, much of the movie still has Dante and Randal dealing with the same things they dealt with at the Quickstop and RST video : annoying customers, jerks they went to highschool with, girlfriends, personal problems, and downright weird situations. Jay and Silent Bob, fresh out of Rehab, now occupy the space in front of Mooby's (since the Quickstop is no more) and still sell drugs, although they themselves claim to have quit. It is Dante's last day at Mooby's before moving to Florida with his Fiancee Emma, and of course just like his hellish day at the Quickstop ten years ago, Dante's life will never be same.

Like it's been said, there's many parallels between this and the first film. Dante is caught between two women he's in love with (his fiancee Emma, the girl in high school who would never give him the time of day, and his boss Becky, who is a perfect match for him, but claims to not believe in romantic love.) There is a scene on the roof involving Dante, although this time he's not playing Hockey. After a fight with a customer, Randal and Dante both leave to go somewhere (although this time we see the scene). There is a long movie debate, although this time it involves Lord of The Rings Vs. Star Wars (in a quite hilarious scene I might add). A big fight near the end of the movie between Dante and Randal, before becoming friends again for the resolution. And of many other little things like previous customers of the Quickstop coming to Mooby's, etc...

Even though the main characters of the movie, Dante and Randal, are now in their 30's, it seems Clerks II deal with much of the same situation both were in in the first film : How long will they waste their lives away working a job they hate? With the addition of fellow employee Elias we also get to see a clash between the pop-culture that Smith's generation grew up with (those who would have been in their 20's for the first film) and the culture that the generation now grew up with (those who are in their 20's now). And it's very easy to see which one Smith prefers.

There's very little to complain about as far as plot goes. I couldn't have imagined this movie going any other way. Like some have said though, the love story is the only weak point of the movie. In the first film when Dante was caught between Veronica and Caitlin, you didn't know who he would choose, and seemingly it appeared like each girl had something which they could offer Dante (Caitlin was now ready for a loving relationship with Dante despite having cheated on him 8 and 1/2 times, and Veronica was fully devoted and in love with Dante, despite being pretty promiscuous before their relationship), making it extremely hard for him to make his decision. In Clerks II while there is a conflict between which woman Dante should choose, it seems as soon as Becky hints that she might have ""romantic"" feelings for Dante, it becomes a one sided battle in her favor. We also don't see much of Emma, besides a couple of scenes in the beginning of the movie. The other letdown I had, was in a scene near the end where Dante and Randal are having their fight and it appears Silent Bob will offer them his unfathomable wisdom (much as he does in every film), like in the previous Clerks when he tells Dante ""There's a lot of beautiful out there, but not a lot of them bring you lasagna at work. Most of them just cheat on you."" Instead in Clerks II he just says ""Ah I've got nothing."" Maybe that was the way Smith intended it for joking purposes, but it would have been great to hear a little of silent Bob's wisdom on the subject.

For all concerned though, Clerks II is no disappointment. It offers a logical conclusion to what the first film started. Without giving too much away I'll just say that Dante and Randal end up doing what they should have done in the first place. I find a lot of what this and the first film are about is doing what makes you happy, even if it is unconventional or not the lifestyle that everyone else says is correct. In the end you only answer to yourself, and if you're not happy with the life you have (even if that's what everyone else wants), what do you have? Of course there is plenty of dirty jokes and hilarious scenarios to go along with this message. Clerks II is essential viewing to all Kevin Smith fans, and especially anyone who liked the first film. While it's lacking the indie feel of the first, and really you can't compare the two, Clerks II is a great installment in the Askewniverse. It indeed lived up to the hype.",1153526400,2,5746,4.442654028436019
2650591,5,B000I0RNVQ,"The original Clerks is a landmark movie; made on a budget of $28,000, it became a huge cult hit and began the ""Askewniverse"", the film and comic book world populated by characters like Jay (Jason Mewes), Silent Bob (Kevin Smith), and the Hicks family (all played by Brian O'Halloran).  While Clerks II is the first direct sequel to any Askewniverse film, it, like all the others, has certain elements that have writer/director Kevin Smith's fingerprints all over it.

The story starts 10 years after the end of Clerks.  Dante Hicks (O'Halloran) and Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson) still work at the Quick Stop and RST Video stores, respectively, despite the fact that they are now in their 30's.  As the movie opens, Dante opens the shutters to see that the building is on fire due to Randal's negligence.  For the next year, the two of them work at Mooby's, a fast food restaurant.  Though their setting has changed, they are still clerks.  They still have to put up with annoying customers, but now they have to make food as well.  They also have coworkers to put up with, notably Elias (Trevor Fehrman) a 19-year-old who still kisses his mother goodbye everyday when she drops him off.  He and Randal are usally arguing about who grew up with better pop culture, with Randal backing Star Wars and Elias championing Lord of the Rings and Transformers.  We also meet their boss in this movie (in the original Clerks, we never met their superior and only knew him as ""The Boss"").  Becky (Rosario Dawson) is a cool and very tolerant (in Randal's case) manager who likes hanging out with Dante while Randal and Elias work.  Jay and Silent Bob are also still in the lives of Dante and Randal.  Since the Quick Stop burned down, they had to find a new place to hang out in front of, and they chose Mooby's.  They are still drug dealers, but now they themselves are clean.

The majority of the film takes place on Dante's last day of work.  He is leaving New Jersey forever with his fiancee Emma (Jennifer Schwalbach Smith, Kevin Smith's real-life wife) the following day, much to Randal's disappointment.  Randal doesn't like Emma very much, and the feeling is mutual, and Dante himself seems to prefer Becky.  He seems  a lot more relaxed and happy around her than with Emma, who was a jerk to him in high school (though more on this subject later).

Clerks II has many callbacks to the first and has all of Smith's trademarks, but it is definitely its own movie.  In both this and the original, we see Dante's morning routine for opening the store, he paints a girl's toenails in each film, Dante does something on the roof, Dante is caught between two girls, and there are some others that I don't want to spoil.  Jason Lee and Ben Affleck both make appearances, who have appeared in every Smith film since Mallrats (the movie after Clerks).  This film, according to Kevin Smith, is the last film of the Askewniverse (though that's what he said about Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back), and it serves to tie up most of the loose ends (as Smith calls it, it is an epilogue of the Askewniverse).

This is definitely a film that merits repeat viewings.  On top of being laugh-out-loud hilarious, it is so good that you will most likely miss parts of the dialogue due to the audience laughing so hard.  I would see it now, then wait a few weeks when the crowds have thinned out, then go see it again.

This film was made for only $5,000,000, which is small by Hollywood standards, but is 185 times greater than the budget for the first film.  It is my opinion that Smith tried to do a lot of things that he could not have done in the first movie.  Dante and Randal leave the restaurant to go somewhere, but this time, we actually see where they go (in Clerks, they went to a funeral, but we didn't see what went on because it would have been too expensive to hire extras and rent another location).  There is also a hilarious dance sequence where Dante and Becky are dancing on the roof while other people in the film start dancing in their various places (and Randal ""wrangles"" across the counter), and the shots of Dante and Randal in their car are not shot from the back seat.

The one problem I had with this film is the love story.  I don't think it was terrible, but it seemed a little trite for a Kevin Smith movie.  It was very straightforward; the minute that Becky even hinted at her feelings for Dante, we knew that these two were meant for each other.  In the first Clerks, thing were more ambigous about which girl Dante should go for.  Still, when it wasn't being cheesy, it provided for some laughs.

This part isn't so much a problem as an observation.  Clerks II definitely does not feel like an indie film.  I guess that's natural, because if you have $5,000,000 to make a film that will be inexpensive, you might as well go the whole nine yards.  Also, and this is a very convoluted analysis (and is probably over-analysis), but one of the things Kevin Smith said is that this is a film about being in your 30's while the first was about being in one's 20's.  Maybe the indie film has a closer connection with one's 20's (you are young, just starting off in your life as an adult, can't afford much), but once  you get to your 30's, things are more mainstream and you can achieve just a little more if you try.

In summation, Clerks II is a great movie, definitely one of the funniest I've seen since The 40-Year-Old Virgin.  Be warned that it is extremely vulgar (Smith was afraid of getting an NC-17 rating despite no violence or nudity), so don't bring the kids or easily upset friends.  But with Kevin Smith, you really can't expect anything else.",1153526400,58,5660,4.5014691478942215
2650592,1,B000I0RNVQ,"Even the best reviews for a Kevin Smith movie always point out the primitive dialogue, the absence of any real plot, the complete lack of any technical skill or knowledge whatsoever.

That to me is the real comedy of these films: that a group of juvenile stoners who would laugh at a monkey relieving itself on a tree branch would blow enough of their parents' cash to the point that the Hollywood machine has to take this guy seriously.  He admits how terrible he is at directing!  He openly tells everyone that the sum of his wit and knowledge still dwells in the bathroom stalls with sixth-graders!

I've always thought it was hilarious that Smith said in an interview that he wanted to track down the Internet nerds who didn't like his movies and punch them out at their front doors.

The funniest part of his latest effort to cash in has to be the Joel Seigel episode.  For the first time in 30 years (according to Seigel), he was so outraged and disgusted by a movie that he publicly stormed out.  After this news hit the NY Post, Smith sat in on a radio show and called Seigel at home to chew him out for his unprofessionalism.  Think about that.

Kevin Smith bawled a critic out for not sitting through his movie where characters arrange for a bestiality-for-money scheme.  Now that's funny!

Seigel apologized and said that when he walks out of the second movie in his film criticism career, he'll be more quiet.

Funny, funny stuff.  And it's not even in the movie.",1153526400,7,1475,4.520754716981132
2650593,4,B000I0RNVQ,"The craftmanship here is in the jokes.  The plot is in the jokes.  It sneaks up behind you and grabs you.  The story begins simply, as a direct follow-up to the original, littered with scatalogical references, LOTR jokes, and endless obscenity.  I missed these guys more than I realized.  Clerks, the original film, and especially the underrated animated series aren't so much underappreciated as cross-appreciated.  Potheads, bizzare cultists, and junior high students have flooded the market for Kevin Smith films, much as they flooded the theatre in which I saw 'Clerks II.'  And there are tons of weed and poop and kinky sex jokes.  They dominate the entire first hour, hilariously and knowingly.  Everything builds up to a serviceable, workmanlike comedy.  Until....

SPOILER ALERT (KINDA)

the bottom drops out.  Smith, in the middle of a scene filled with music and flights of fantasy, and yes, dozens of choreographed dancers lampooning the comic excess of the movie itself, creates a kind of critical mass with a sudden, heart-dropping descent back into reality.  The movie takes a left-turn into dramatic tension and conflict in a way Smith has never attempted, even in his 'serious adult' movie ""Jersey Girl.""  I realized all the jokes and familial banter were really leading to a kind of dramatic epiphany, not just for the movie, but for the entire series.  The movie isn't immature.  It's ABOUT the ways we dodge and deny maturity.  There's a truth in the heart of this movie which lies bare for the final thirty minutes.  And there are laughs in the final act, too, but they come out of desperation, painful truths, and fear.  The movie becomes a reimagining of the Askewniverse, one where Jay and Silent Bob are in Narcanon, and the irresponsibilities of Dante and Randall actually affect the outside world and those who care about them.  This makes the movie sound incredibly dour.  It's not.  It's optimistic where the first Clerk was kind of cynical.  And it's a vast improvement.  People who are just looking for a few laughs might feel blindsided, but those people who understand why ""40 Year Old Virgin"" was a better movie than ""Wedding Crashers"" will surely get the meaning of this movie. It's Smith revelling in his glory days, and also saying goodbye to all that.",1153440000,3,2288,4.9267015706806285

I do not want to elaborate on story, but to say the least there are plenty of things to get offended by(not me, I love this stuff). all of the characters weave in and out of each other but this movie is actually more about DANTE and his pal RANDALL. after all is said and done this movie has heart. its about love, friendship and one's own destiny. crude humor, male nudity, extreme language and a MULE, I kid you not. if you loved CLERKS for any reason, this is worthy sequel. don't say I didn't warn you.

I suggest going in green but if you've seen any of the specials / commercials then you've already spoiled some of it.

I'm all about writers taking risks with creative decisions, but some of the attempts to be funny fell way flat, and at times just felt racist and homophobic. (I'm not saying that in an SJW sense. I think you should be able to joke about anything, I just don't think it was done well here.) I still love Kevin Smith even though I think he makes some shitty movies.
