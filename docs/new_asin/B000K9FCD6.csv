8155193,2,B000K9FCD6,"Good God!  I'm 54 years old and it's the absolute worst print/copy of a film I've ever seen!  The poor quality ruins it and I cannot watch it after putting up with it for 9 minutes.  The tint is way off and everyone has purple skin tones.  Some scenes look out of focus.  I can hear a squeaking sound every 2 seconds.  I don't mind the dust and scratches and tape splices, but c'mon!  Didn't anyone take quality into consideration when transferring this great film?  Obviously not.  What a waste of my money and time.  This should be retransferred by someone who knows what they are doing.",1501459200,,589,4.420560747663552
8155194,5,B000K9FCD6,"Most people probably never heard of this movie.  What a shame because Burt Reynolds gives one of his best  performances. Even Burt said it was the best thing he ever did (Wikipedia).  It was originally called ""Fade In"" and because of the name change, I had a hard time finding.  It co-stars Barbara Loden, an excellent, little-known actress whose life was cut so short.

This is truly an exceptional movie, never around on tv and deserves a larger audience and greater acclaim.  I'd say ""get it"" and ""keep it"" cause you'll want to watch it over and over.",1470355200,,554,4.6020408163265305
8155195,3,B000K9FCD6,"I watched Iron Cowboy on Foxtel here in Australia a while ago now probably about 1999/2000 and i enjoyed it.i had been keen to see it again for a
long time after that and could never find it in a video store or even have anyone who knew the title.after giving up on ever seeing it again i searched
an on line DVD store called EZY down under and sure enough they had a double feature Iron Cowboy / Ramblin' Man by some group called Payless.so excited i immediately purchased it and to my horror the picture quality was not very good.not having a good understanding of the transfer process i would compare it to a very old VHS tape copied to another bad tape.
I decided to go for broke and buy this DVD from Amazon and thought they would have done a much better job with this DVD having no reviews to
go by.it was exactly the same copy I'd bought here in Aust. there are audio and video glitches the picture is very hard to watch and i now have two
copies of a nice little movie starring Burt Reynolds which i will never watch again.",1445212800,2,1031,4.185929648241206
8155196,3,B000K9FCD6,"Nice little romance story about a man (Reynolds) hired as an 'extra' who falls in love with a film editor (Loden). The film is interesting because it stars Burt Reynolds in one of his first lead roles also because it was made as a 'time filler'. Shot during a break in the production of a western film called 'Blue' starring Terrence Stamp who was seen at the time as the next major star and Joanna Pettit and Ricardo Montalban. The film might not have happened at all except that production of 'Blue' had to be halted while Stamp took care of some legal business and then because of the length of time that took Montalban had an obligation to fulfill so, to keep the crew busy they shot this. I believe Reynolds worked on Blue as a stunt double and Loden was a minor character. Interestingly, this film is better received than the one they intended to make but the quality of the print is poor.",1444608000,,895,4.397590361445783
8155197,5,B000K9FCD6,"The five stars are for the movie, not the DVD.  One of my favorite movies of all time.  Unfortunately, this print is pretty bad but there is no other source for it, so it will have to do.",1437091200,,187,3.8947368421052633
8155198,3,B000K9FCD6,"I got this because it was filmed in Moab, Utah. It is hard to watch because of the poor quality of the film and the acting is really amateurish, but I am glad to see what Moab was like in those days, so I don't regret buying it.",1377734400,,228,3.7708333333333335

8155200,3,B000K9FCD6,"Here's a real curio for all Burt Reynolds fans: his second starring movie role (after 1966's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NAVAJO-JOE/dp/B0014BQR2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NAVAJO JOE</a>), in a 1968 TVer called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FADE-IN-aka-Iron-Cowboy/dp/B000K9FCD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FADE-IN (aka ""Iron Cowboy"")</a>.

It's a Hollywood looks at Hollywood story that occurs on the set of a real production entitled BLUE. The stars of that project, Terence Stamp, Sally Kirkland, Joanna Pettet and Ricardo Montalban, appear occasionally here, but mainly this picture is a dalliance between Reynolds, a local cowboy hired as an ""extra,"" and Barbara Loden as an attractive film editor. When they're not romancing, Barbara shows Burt aspects of the editing art.

Speaking of film splicing, it's said this movie was so savagely cut up by the studio that its director, Jud Taylor refused to allow his name on the credits. Thus was born the now-famous pseudonym of Alan Smithee.

After FADE-IN, Taylor, who worked solely in the television medium, directed five classic Star Trek episodes: The Paradise Syndrome (1968), Wink of an Eye (1968), Let That Be Your Last Battlefield (1969), The Mark of Gideon (1969) and The Cloud Minders (1969).",1267920000,5,1345,6.3791208791208796
