7902850,5,B000003K5Z,"This episode starts out in an interesting way, where everyone is wondering what is going on, and the story soon gives all the answers as it builds up in a very unique way, at the same time showing a deep affection of Worf and Troi, like Picard and Beverly in ""Attached"".
As the romance winds on, it appears to cause some trouble which is too shocking to talk about, and then that leads to the evidence of who started it all. So, don't miss this exciting mystery episode if you are a Star Trek: TNG lover!",1034294400,,504,4.260416666666667
7902851,4,B000003K5Z,"Lt. Dan Kwan commits suicide on the Enterprise by jumping through a force field into the plasma stream of one of the engines.  As Troi and Worf are investigating, the Counselor experiences an emphatic jolt of fear, panic and rage.  Shaken, Troi tries a second visit to the site and suddenly finds himself back at Utopia Planitia where the Enterprise was constructed, where she sees a couple kissing and a third person who turns out to be Lt. Walter Pierce, now serving about the Enterprise.  But when they question the officer, he has nothing to say.  That evening, Troi and Worf become a couple.  But the next day when Deanna sees him paying attention to young Ensign Calloway (Kwan's girlfriend), she grabs a phaser and kills Worf.  Then she goes back to the narcelle tube to throw herself in; just like Lt. Kwan.
The blossoming romance between Troi and Worf follows up on what was started in ""Parallels"" (Episode 163), where the Klingon saw an alternative reality where he was married to the Counselor.  The idea that part of the Enterprise is haunted is a bit much, although like Dr. Crusher's encounter with a ""spirit"" in ""Inheritance"" (Episode 162) there is a rational (i.e., scientific) explanation.  This is an average STNG episode, memorable mainly because Worf finally makes a move on Deanna.",987897600,2,1302,4.833333333333333
