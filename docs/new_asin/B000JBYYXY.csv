8149701,5,B000JBYYXY,I purchased this movie because it is a very wonderful story about friends. I have been watching this movie for many many years as an adult and it truly takes me away to a wonderful state of mind!,1411948800,,195,4.157894736842105
8149702,4,B000JBYYXY,"I had ordered several Wind in the Willow DVDs. This was not a British production or the Disney production. It was a good representation of the classic. I did give this to some children to introduce them to the story. It is a good DVD, just not up to the others I have seen.",1187827200,,273,4.074074074074074
8149703,1,B000JBYYXY,"I don't know if our DVD is a dud or what, but for at least 50% of the movie, the dialogue is inaudible because of a poor sound mix.
