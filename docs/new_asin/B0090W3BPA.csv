5228790,2,B0090W3BPA,"Sorry but I really didn't like this season. Season 6 starts making the characters really annoying, stupid and there are way too many gross-out jokes. To be fair a few of the episodes are good but very few of them are great. Despite having more episodes than any other season before it this is a clear case of quantity over quality as most of them are forgettable or bad. In this season they start rehashing a ton of plots, there are far less jokes, and there are a ton of filler moments that do nothing but bore. There are some diamonds in the rough like Not Normal and No Hat for Pat but there are too many bad episodes to recommend this set, some of which rank among the worst episodes ever made for the series. Well at least it's still better than most of the junk on Nickelodeon nowadays. I'm still a SpongeBob fan but this set didn't do it for me.

5228818,4,B0090W3BPA,"In my opinion, proceed with caution. Buy this only at $20 or lower. As the majority of Spongebob fans like myself believe, the overall quality of humor dropped relatively significantly after the Spongebob movie, starting with Season 4. For newcomers to Spongebob, PLEASE do not start here. I highly recommend that everyone reading this consider buying the Spongebob First 100 Episodes DVD box set, as it contains everything from Seasons 1-5.

Seasons 1-3 are the best of the show. They have the best humor, best overall pacing, and have great potential for multiple viewings. Practically every popular quotation from the series comes from these 3 seasons.

Season 4 is okay, but once Hillenburg left, the show lost a little creativity and humor. But overall, most of the episodes have at least something to offer, with only 2 or 3 episodes being notably bad.

Season 5 gets more iffy. High quality episodes are few and far between, with a lot of OK episodes. However, this season has more terrible episodes than Season 4, and is overall a step in the wrong direction. This is part of the reason I recommend the First 100 Episodes box set, as it has all of Season 5, and if you don't like Season 5, there is NO WAY you will like Season 6.

As for Season 6 itself, for those of you who read this far, Season 6 has, by far, the highest number of BORING episodes: not episodes that do anything heinous, but just plain boring. This comprises about half of the season. One third of the episodes in this season are VERY BAD, as in ""You will regret your life decisions"" bad. The remaining sixth are the highlights, the best of the season, and they are about as good as a decent Season 4 episode. Take that for what you will.

I bought this because I want to have all the Spongebob episodes, excluding Season 9 (Amazon has Seasons 7 and 8 on Prime Instant Video). I got it mainly to compare Spongebob from earlier seasons to later seasons. I would not buy it for any other reasons, and again, not any higher than $20.",1428451200,23,2008,4.535911602209945

5228899,5,B0090W3BPA,"The 6th season of SpongeBob debuted in 2008 and concluded in 2010, and starting here, each season of SpongeBob would have 26 shows instead of only 20. If you'll notice by the time this season started, big words started to abound on SpongeBob, to make both kids and grownups alike have a bigger vocabulary. An easy way to learn such words is to turn on your TV's closed-captioning, to see how they're spelt, and then look them up in the Dictionary. This season contains Squilliam's first time in the show since season 3, the first time a ""My leg!"" gag is heard in the show since season 2, the Chum Coliseum gorefest-gone-bust, SpongeBob's vast knowledge of boating history, Mr. Krabs getting all worked up over a not-so-simple ""penny"" (Penny Foolish gives a nod to the first SpongeBob Movie during the movie theatre scene, and inadvertently the second movie as well!), a tribute to one of the greatest inventions in toon history (the slide whistle), SpongeBob VS The Big One, SpongeBob ditching Boating School (even though he had its bathroom key the whole time), Squidward in Boating School to make his driving record unsoiled again, SpongeBob's indirect revenge on Mr. Krabs & his get-rich-quick schemes (via The Krabby Kronicle), Squidward visiting SpongeBob, SpongeBob's RoundPants predicament, Plankton using a trio of robots to replace Karen in his latest formula scheme, SpongeBob & Patrick in an all-out sandcastle war, King Neptune's 5000th birthday, and the very first episode filmed in HD-Widescreen (and the first episode to take up 2 whole shows in production order), Truth Or Square. In this set, and in one of the half-season sets, Truth Or Square is completely unedited with lots of guest stars & other scenes not seen in the TV print! But unfortunately, this landmark episode is in letterbox-widescreen on this set; the black bars remain in the picture no matter what kind of TV you watch it on. It's the same way with It's A SpongeBob Christmas in season 8's set. Just like with seasons 4 and 5, season 6 is also a 2-in-1 reissue of its half-season sets, right down to the bonus features. It contains 9 shorts in all, a special short on how to make your own SpongeBob toy, the unedited Bollywood Bob music video, and the SpongeBob History Song (a bonus short that seemed to be meant for the First 100 Episodes set, but didn't make that set's final cut, and ended up here)! If you're a longtime fan of the show, don't hesitate to add this set to your SpongeBob season sets collection, unless you've already done it. Luckily, seasons 7 and 8 were whole season sets to begin with, making so many fans happy with such a decision to this day!",1393372800,,2654,4.759219088937093
