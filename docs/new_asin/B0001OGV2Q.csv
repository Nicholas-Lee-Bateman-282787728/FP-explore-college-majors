8015484,5,B0001OGV2Q,I wondered if it would be worth purchasing because of some reviewers comments but my 8 and 6 year old love it and watched it twice today after it came in the mail.  Neither know how to play basketball or are super interested in sports so I was hoping the animation would hold their interest while they maybe started to grasp a bit of the concepts of basketball.  I'm just happy they liked it enough to watch twice.  I didn't watch it besides wandering in and out but my 8 year old was excited to go to his bb practice tonight for the first time so i would say it was worth the money for me!,1482105600,,590,4.068965517241379
