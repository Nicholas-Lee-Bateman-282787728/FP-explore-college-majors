8080121,4,B000AXQ1SW,"We're horror movie lovers, almost to the exclusion of anything else.  We watch it all: old, new, indie, big budget, predictable, zany. We especially love horror produced between 1985-1995. Because of its year, Dead Mate made our view list. What can be written of Dead Mate? It's low budget, with peculiar acting and poor cinematography. For this movie you really, honestly have to love 80s horror and like the low-end stuff. We found parts of the movie funny, or more enjoyable than others. For people like us, Dead Mate will make your 'See It' list. Most Americans, especially the younger demographic, will shut this down before it gets started.",1426032000,,646,4.926605504587156
