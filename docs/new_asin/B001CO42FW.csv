8288415,5,B001CO42FW,Great tin DVD set.  I really enjoyed learning about these Endangered and Unknown civilizations on our planet. This series looks at tribes and tiny tribes of people through out the world.,1461024000,,186,5.0
8288416,2,B001CO42FW,This DVD set focuses too much on the religious aspects of the endangered civilizations.  Not what I expected.,1448582400,,109,5.055555555555555
8288417,5,B001CO42FW,"I purchased this DVD set without knowing what to expect.  When they arrived and I began watching them I understood what the film maker was trying to do.  He takes you to a remote area of the globe to a small village or community of people and you actually spend the day with them.  You see what they do to feed themselves, clothe themselves, how they get water to drink, earn money if possible.  While all this is going on the narriator is telling you what they are talking about, the problems they encounter daily and how they are striving to overcome them in order to remain a viable living culture.  I learned a lot about peoples I had never heard of and now I feel as if I have friends in the far distant reaches of this world.",1341360000,8,731,4.23021582733813
