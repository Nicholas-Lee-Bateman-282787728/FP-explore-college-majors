3531136,5,B001DILYIK,"If you have ever dreamed of stumbling onto an undiscovered gem of romantic comedy, Day-Time Wife is your film. As the neglected young wife turned secretary, Linda Darnell (then only 15 years old) delivers one of the most memorable film performances of the 1930s. Tyrone Power (the wayward husband) and Warren William (the lecherous boss) provide sparkling performances as well. This movie is as intoxicating as vintage champagne! In 1939 the director of Day Time Wife also directed Intermezzo (Ingrid Bergman's first Hollywood film).

Johnny Apollo is an interesting film but one that is not quite so unexpected.",1284422400,8,612,5.244897959183674
8293511,5,B001DILYIK,Another great movie by Tyrone Power. I love it.,1517875200,,47,4.333333333333333
8293512,4,B001DILYIK,"Johnny Apollo - 3.5 stars - Lloyd Nolan has a great persona on the screen, whether playing a good guy or a bad guy.  In this case, a bad guy.  Tyrone Power was good, too, but perhaps a little too ""pretty"" for the part.  Supporting cast very good.  The movie takes place in NYC circa 1940.  It's set against the strained relationship between a father and son and how this affects the son (Tyrone Power), who gets involved with the wrong people (Lloyd Nolan).  Entertaining movie if not a little unrealistic.  Or maybe back then it was really like that.  Anyhow, it wasn't time wasted.  I liked it.

Day-Time Wife - 4 stars - Wife thinks husband is cheating on her.  She sets out to get him back.  Enjoyable.  This movie is from a time when a woman's place was in the home, well, at least as far as the men in the movie are concerned.  Would watch again.",1505347200,,852,4.276729559748428

But couldn't understand until he had no money and had to work. His faather went to prison And started over in the boiler droom.  His son got mixed up with the wrong crowd.
