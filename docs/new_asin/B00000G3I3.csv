Of *course* it's different from the books--if the show was the same, a lot of people  wouldn't bother to read the books! :( This way, both book and show are  worth experiencing! =)",918950400,,314,4.216666666666667
1215014,1,B00000G3I3,"I don't mean to insult those who think the movie is okay--well that's your choice. Sure movies don't always NEED to fit the book exactly, but come on, at least they should still MAKE SENSE. In the part after the Animorphs have found Ax, as they run away from Visser Three and the controllers, they run into a room with an open ceiling and lock the door. Visser Three uses his tail blade to break the door open (and in the meantime, the Animorphs are aquiring butterflies, to get away) After Visser Three managed to get the door open all the way, he morphs to human before going in and saying ""Nooo!"" as he sees the butterflies fly away. Now WHY WHY WHY would Visser Three morph to human??? He only uses his human morph when he's among real humans, to hide his real form. There were no real humans here, only controllers. And after all, he thought that he was dealing with Andalite warriors here, right? SO why would he morph into a human that has no natural weapons at all???
There's a lot more pointless stuff than that. Like when Rachel morphs to cat to go spying on Chapman's house. Why doesn't she stay in the dining room to spy on Melissa and Chapman??? Why does she go down into the basement? In the book, the reason why she went there was cause she was following Chapman there, but here it makes no sense at all. And then, get this, once she reaches the basement, she DEMORPHs, which is really dangerous. And then she starts searching through a desk that's there, muttering ""come on, come on"". ERM, what exactly is she looking for? In the movie she went into this house to check wether or not Melissa is a controller. So what exactly does she expect to find on a DESK? Maybe a document, some piece of paper, that says ""Melissa Chapman is a controller"" ?? It just seems really stupid, how she's hastily searching through this desk, muttering ""Come on, come on.."" when she's really searching for NOTHING if you think about it, lol. Like someone else said: If you wanna save money, don't buy this junk. On the other hand, I would also recomend you to buy it, if you feel like it :D , just so that you can laugh your butt off at all the cheapness. (Jake always grins so stupidly when he's supposed to be serious, the furr on Ax's head looks like a punk, and in the part where Elfangor tells the Animorphs to run away from the aproaching yeerks, he's like ""Go! Goooo! Gooo!"" ugh. He might as well say ""Gooo, my little Animorphs, gooo! Mwhahahaha!"" ;) )",1034812800,12,2454,4.37199124726477
1215015,3,B00000G3I3,"Having been a fan of the books by K. A. Applegate, I was most eager to see this. Nevertheless, I was let down somewhat, on how they put twentysomething actors and make them play high-school characters and at how thin the plot and the script really are.
I wasn't terribly disappointed, you have to give the show credit for what it has; a creepy atmosphere, fitting soundtrack, good special effects and somewhat effective acting by all six. I watched nearly all of the episodes, with the exception of the first TV ""movie"" (in actuality, a movie composed of three episodes edited to seem like a movie).
But the script uneffectively blends about two to three books into one storyline and make up completely different ones also. The flaws of this show is the running time of the shows, which is about thirty minutes or an hour at least, the actors don't bring all of their respective fictional personas out like in the books and the quickness of the ""morphing.""
After reading the last Animorphs book (which I hated), I feel like watching the shows that I have on videotape again, which are Parts I and II. They seem (and some of them are), better than the last...[book].
The show brings about 65% of the series out from the pages, which is pretty good, but really the first book should have been made into a movie, instead of a series. The series is fine, but I'd rather settle with a more accurate movie than a comparable TV series.",1014854400,6,1428,4.560311284046692
1215016,5,B00000G3I3,"Anyway, I really like the tv series. The only problem I have with it was the writing I think that they should have got some of the quotes and stuff from the books. But I really don't like the fans dissing the tv series. I thought that it was awesome! Even though that Brooke(which don't get me wrong I like her)she wasn't a very convincing rachel she wasn't ruthless enough or reckless enough,but everyone else I think did great. Yes! the show could had  been better a whole lot better but still it will never be as good as the books. If it wasn't for the series I would had never started to reading the books. And people who don't like are just being petty and stupid. The show was great give it up there was some stuff here and there but please it was great and it was really good. Everyone just needs to leave the show alone. And if you do like it,thaks you have very good taste. And you know that there is a difference between real-life and books.",1009152000,2,951,4.225274725274725
1215017,5,B00000G3I3,"This movie is pretty good.  At the mall 4 teens Rachel, Marco, Jake, and Cassie hook up with each other on a night they'll remember for the rest of their lives.  Jake's dog Homer runs away and then is caught by a kid named Tobias who Rachel seems to take a liking to.  Then a ship crashes.  They meet Elfangor an Andalite warrior who warns them about the Yeerks a parasitic race who takes over the minds of speices. He gives them the ability to morph or cahnge into animals. He tries to give Tobias a disk and fails.  Visser Three leader of the Earth invasion appears.  He is a yeerk with an Andalite host body.  He eats Elfangor.  The kids all run.  Jake gets caught in a pipe.  He morphs his dog homer and discovers his principal is a controller.  In Part 2 The Anmorphs experiment morphing.  Rachel turns into a cat, Marco into a rat, and Cassie into a horse.  Tobias aquires a hawk.  THey decide to get the disk back.  IN Underground the try the disk out and it doesn't work.  MArco and Jake aquire a lizard morph to spy on Chapman.  Jake discovers that his brother is a controller.  Later they go to the Gardens to aquire a lion (Rachel) and a tiger (Jake).  They sneak into the Yeerk pool and barely escape. All execpt Jake who uses his lizard morph to get away.  The can't find tobias though.  So they leave searching for him.  All in all this video is great.",1006905600,,1366,4.25390625
1215018,5,B00000G3I3,This was an exellent movie. The 3-D graphics were amazing. The actors were wonderful and did a great job. I enjoyed this movie very much and am looking forward to seeing the rest. I am a big fan of the books and am now a big fan of the movies. I give this movie 5 stars up and think that everyone who enjoys science fiction should she this movie,1002758400,,345,4.0144927536231885
1215019,1,B00000G3I3,"This show is pure sacrilege to the book series, even more so than book 54. It might be interesting for those reviewers that say people must hate everything Animorphs if they hate the show to learn that K.A. Applegate hates the show, and even made fun of it in the books once! I can't remember which book it is, but she says in the introduction, ""Controllers don't pull their ears or anything.""
I only got through the first three episodes before swearing off the show forevermore, but what I can tell you is that it stinks. I'm not against original plotlines, but every time an episode is not based on one of the books it ends up a horrible mess. Even the episodes based on the books are terrible, from what I've gathered from episode guides.
Did the people at Scholastic actually go out of their way to find 20 year olds that looked nothing like the teenage book characters? Also, the Animorphs' personalities themselves are pretty separate, so it wouldn't seem very difficult to get the characters mixed up. For no apparent reason, Rachel's and Cassie's personalities are completely switched. Cassie's the belligerent mall girl, while Rachel's the messy pacifist. This isn't helped by the fact that a lot of the characters' trademark morphs are changed. Jake has a white tiger, Rachel has a lion, and Marco has a rat. Apparently, this is also just for the hell of it. Plus, they can now morph any kind of clothing, which takes away one of the biggest problems the Animorphs of the books had.
Also, although the first book was spread over three episodes, Scholastic then decided there would be one episode per book. This means that a 150+ page book is being constantly crushed into 22 minutes of air time. This would be a tight fit even without showing every other shot from three different angles in slow motion.
In short, read the books (possibly making up your own ending and skipping 54) and forget the show ever existed. You'll be glad you did.",999388800,8,1949,4.6521739130434785
1215054,3,B00000G3I3,"I'll start with the bad then go to the good...
BAD:the andalites are really cheap-looking. The producers shoulden't have tried to stick a whole book in 30min. They also should have stayed in order following the books(1,2,3so-on not 1,2,3,16) GOOD:the morphing was really cool and the suspence was awsome. The plot sort-of followed the books and the computer animation was great IN A NUT SHELL:the books where definatly better but the movie/series was okay and the grapics/com. animation was great.",971740800,2,497,5.225
1215055,4,B00000G3I3,"I really liked all the episodes that were on this video and as the first book is one of my favourites,I thought getting to see the Animorphs from the very beginning was one of the best things about it. The first two episodes are actually mostly taken from the books, unlike many episodes in the Animorphs T.V series. A good video if you like Animorphs.",970272000,,352,4.430769230769231

1215057,1,B00000G3I3,This is the worst movie ever. I have only seen the first 2 minutes of it and it is already the stupidist thing ever made by man.  Do not watch this dirt.,937353600,,153,3.78125
1215058,1,B00000G3I3,"Well ppl, i've seen a lot of reviews, and i agree with the disliking of it. Animorphs, based mainly on morphing, and what do you get??? A few seconds of morphing which totally isn't what KA's definition of ""my  fingers stretched out,elongating completely"" kinda thing. Hardcore  anifans will agree with me i guess , the characters are a little switched  up. And well I would give K.A's books a hundred stars but this doesn't have  the qualifications to do so. So pls, rent this movie if u want but don't buy  it.",936489600,,512,4.521739130434782

7908849,4,B00000G3I3,Just did not like the writing about copying etc coming on the screen during the movie. This should be done only at the beginning before the movie starts and\or after the movie is over.,1484784000,,184,4.4411764705882355

7908855,1,B00000G3I3,"...and in this TV series, I have been reduced to a jock with a really gay looking haircut. Remember my cool friend Marco? Remember how in the books he always had the coolest sounding lines, a la Cancer Man from The X Files? Well here, his one liners put Mr. Freeze to shame. All of my friends have been messed around with in the worst sense too- Remember that uber villain Visser Three? He's a bald idiot who also looks really gay, putting Rob Halford to shame. Remember Rachel and my beautiful girlfriend Cassie? Remember how both of them were smart, stand-up girls in the books? Well now they've been converted to bimbos by the idiot writers. Oh, and Ax, the very odd but cool alien dude? Well now he's been reduced to a bumbling idiot whom between him and I, has a homoerotic banter going on.

Nevermind what the books tell you, this show is the real truth about us! Just beware of Scholastic, who has the ability to take your book series and turn it into a bad show. You've been warned.",1266710400,,990,4.380434782608695
