2457120,5,B000CCIRY2,"My daughter is 2 years 3 months.  I have been signing with her since she was 9 months old and we have looked at many signing DVDs.  I can tell you that Sign-a-Lot is her favorite!  She requests the DVD everyday.  She picked up the signs right away and now corrects me if I make a mistake.

Sign a Lot combines different ways of learning and reviewing sign which keeps the child interested.  My daughter truly truly has fun learning and reviewing her signs.  It is a wonderful CD - I am just waiting for more sign-A-Lot DVDs to come...I can't wait!!",1134950400,13,548,4.313725490196078
2457121,5,B000CCIRY2,"My 5 year old daughter loves Sign-A-Lot.  She likes to watch it first thing in the morning, after she wakes up and then she signs all day to me and my husband.  She is constantly teaching us what she learned from Sign-A-Lot and we enjoy it as much as she does!  It is so nice to see her learn so many signs and to see her teach them to her cousins and friends...is truly a joy!  I highly recommend this DVD.",1133049600,2,407,3.9876543209876543
2457122,5,B000CCIRY2,"This is a fabulous dvd.  I am a former teacher and mother of three (5,7,9 years old) and this is the only dvd that all three will watch together happily.  I can't believe how many signs they know. When we evacuted for Hurricane Rita, it was a must to take with us for our long car ride!",1132617600,2,286,4.0
2457123,5,B000CCIRY2,"I am always looking for enriching and fun DVDs for my four and six year old girls - and this is it!  I am amazed at how quickly they've learned the signs presented in the DVD and have incorporated them into our daily routines at home and school.  Even their friends love to watch it when they come over on playdates.  The feel of the DVD is whimsical and fun - kind of like a ""Blue's Clues"" feel and the kids are really charismatic and sweet - my girls have already picked their favorite See Me Sign Kids.  The sign language vocabulary is presented in a really easy to understand/learn way and it's very engaging overall.  Our family recommends Sign-A-Lot.",1132531200,3,656,4.433333333333334
2457124,5,B000CCIRY2,"The Sign-A-Lot DVDs are wonderful (both Volumes)!
The DVDs are very interactive,
they get kids to sign along,
they teach tons of signs,
they have sign repetitions which won't get boring.

I am a Sign2me presenter, teaching ASL to pre-K to 2nd grade.
The DVDs are a great addition to a signing program for this age group.

I am also a mom with 3 signing kids (6,3,1 years old).
My kids are asking over and over to watch the Sign-A-Lot DVDs.
They love the magic door, the interactive games. And we are all humming and signing the Sign-A-Lot song all day long!

I can only recommend these 2 DVDs - educational as well as entertaining.
Happy Signing!",1212451200,3,646,4.504273504273504
2457125,4,B000CCIRY2,"My two year old has been going to speech therapy, so we bought her this DVD to help her learn ASL (and thus reinforce her speech therapy).  Because my daughter loves this DVD, she wants to watch it at least every other day, and because she watches it all the time, the signs are really sticking.  Our entire family has learned a good bit of ASL, and that has made a huge impact on our daughter's ability to communicate.  Her total vocabulary has quadrupled in two months, and her spoken vocabulary has more than doubled.

The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because the audio can get a little shrill (and annoying, but that is the fault I have with it.",1209945600,4,672,4.309523809523809
2457126,5,B000CCIRY2,"Thank you for letting me know the ABC dvd shipped! I'm so pleased it shipped immediately! Can't wait to receive it! I'm sure you've heard over & over how wonderful these signing videos are... but it has to be said again. My daughter is 19 months old and while I purchased one (not yours) when she was around 8 months, I played it a few times & then got away from it. A couple months ago, my daughter finally became very interested in it & begin picking up signs immediately... even though I thought it was rather tedious for an adult to see over & over. Hoping to improve upon and add to her learning experience I began searching for another signing video, and hoped to find one that covered more than 7 signs at a time in half an hour. As luck would have it, I stumbled on your 'Big Surprise' DVD and another child and family began to really learn some signs. The way you throw in little extras along with the ones you're deliberately teaching is not only innovative but also helps make it so much more entertaining for adults as well as children! We watch your DVD at least 5 times a day on average. Actually until she suddenly developed a love for Shrek last week, we watched the Big Surprise about 20 times a day... which lol, of course led to me praying you had more than one! Besides that, we've taken it on every visit from grandma's, to aunties, to friends & everyone delights in learning how to sign and communicate with her. She is my 5th child after a fourteen year break, so it's not my first trip around the block by any means! lol.... I am in awe of how much less frustrating it is to communicate with a toddler... especially a more high strung one, like mine who's also taking her time getting verbal... by utilizing signs... I sincerely hope you will continue to develop new ones in the future & thank you, thank you, thank you so very much for the ones you've done already! Ozarkldy.com ... Stephanie :)",1205366400,,1920,4.350974930362117
2457127,5,B000CCIRY2,"My preschool special education class is crazy over this DVD! Probably the best video I've ever shown them, they want to watch it over and over again. The songs teach them food signs, feelings, and actions. The kids start randomly singing and signing the songs during circle time, snack time, and even recess, and want to see the DVD again and again.  I hope this company will make many more DVDs like this because I plan to buy every one of them!",1192924800,2,446,4.439024390243903
2457128,2,B000CCIRY2,"I bought this based on the 5 star reviews.  My children (ages 4 and 2) have been learning sign language for 2 years now, and they were very un-impressed with this DVD.  The characters sign too fast for educational purpose, and to be very honest, from a parents perspective, it's a super cheesy movie for a big price of $20 per video. The themes don't make sense, I was so disappointed!",1192752000,4,385,4.408450704225352
2457129,5,B000CCIRY2,"This video is adorable! My three year old is very interested in learning different languages and this video is a wonderful introduction to signing. It is a little corny for adults, but very educational. We love it. My daughter remembers the signs (and so do I!)because they are presented in such a cute way. I would definitely recommend this video!",1184803200,2,348,4.816666666666666
2457130,5,B000CCIRY2,"I was given this DVD as a gift, and my children love it.  I have twin 7 year old daughters, one of whom has Down syndrome and Autism, and we are always looking for fun ways to learn new signs together.  Our family watches it together and then we have fun trying out what we've learned.  I'm excited about getting some of the other titles!",1183766400,,338,4.1692307692307695
2457131,5,B000CCIRY2,My girls started sign language in preschool. I was looking for a way to continue because they are really good at it and seem to enjoy signing a lot.  I can't say enough for this DVD.  It is fantastic.  My girls have watched it so many times...well worth the $20!,1183420800,,262,4.2
2457132,5,B000CCIRY2,We really love the DVD.  My son had speech delays and baby signs was the best way for him to communicate his needs to us.  He loves any sign language tapes and DVD's and will play them until he masters the signs.  The Big Surprise grabbed his attention right away and is his favorite of many choices.  I even hear him humming the songs.,1182124800,,336,4.203125
2457133,5,B000CCIRY2,I had purchased this kids video because the adult sign videos were a little too fast.  This video was great.  The best part about it is you have a choice to just do all the words you learned during the video rather than watch the whole video,1179100800,,241,4.1063829787234045
2457134,5,B000CCIRY2,"After viewing this video, (several times), I have concluded that this video is not only creative, but manages to capture both the little and not-so-little audiences. Its mixture of music and sign activities proves entertaining, rather than insulting to more mature audiences, while it is a perfect springboard for the infant and toddler learning sign for the first time.  I have recommended this, and its companion, to many of my friends.",1177027200,,438,5.169014084507042
2457135,5,B000CCIRY2,"I teach sign language and one of my classes is geared specifically towards ages 6 to 9.  My students in this class unanimously chose Sign-a-lot as their favorite movie over all of the other signing videos that they watch during class.  This video amazingly kept the entire class entranced, quiet and still until the very end.  Sign-a-lot is a wonderful tool as it shows childrens' peers learning and having fun with sign language, this is a very positive influence on this age group.  I enjoyed the video as well, it is a MUST HAVE for your classroom.  A major thumbs up from me and my students!

2457136,5,B000CCIRY2,"As a mother and a librarian I recommend that both Sign-a-Lot dvds be placed in school and public libraries as they are fun and accessible learning tools. The lively children, catchy music and great graphics make a significant learning experience a lot of fun!

Here is what my son Thomas says about Sign-a-lot:

I am 9 years old. And this is the best movie I ever have seen! I really like learning to sign, alot. Its fantastic to learn to speak with your hands. I know that there are some other signing movies, because I have seen them - but this one is the very very very best.",1171065600,,578,4.342592592592593
2457137,5,B000CCIRY2,"As a mother of four kids ages 9,6,4 and 2, this is one of the only DVD's that captivates all of my children's attention. My grandmother who has Alzheimer's and lives with us also is entertained by the whimsical nature of this INTERACTIVE DVD. The kids in the DVD are not ""Hollywood"". They are real kids that could live down the street from us. We do use the signs that we've learned and my kid's teachers have borrowed ""The Big Surprise"" for their classroom. This DVD is fun, educational, and a MUST for every household. Also makes a great gift.",1170720000,2,545,4.46
2457138,5,B000CCIRY2,"I got this DVD for my 1 year old son during the holidays and we both love it! So do his 1 year old and 8 year old cousin. In fact, his older cousin begs to watch the video over and over again. I love that it uses an interactive approach to learning sign language (kind of like the Sesame Street of baby signing videos), and the pacing isn't too fast that young kids will have a hard time catching up.

The bonus section of the DVD is also a great help -- all the signs used in the video are reviewed, plus you will learn how to sign the ""Sign-A-Lot"" song!

This video will teach you and your kids ASL and at the same time you are guaranteed to have a good time. It is definitely one of our favorite videos and I can't wait to get the other Sign-A-Lot DVD.",1168387200,,755,3.960526315789474
2457139,5,B000CCIRY2,"I bought this DVD for my 8 nieces and nephews who are between the ages of 4-9 for Christmas.  My siblings reported that their kids loved the DVD.  My brother told me that it was a huge hit for all the neighborhood kids.  Later I visited my sister and her children got out of the car and started signing to each other (ages 9 and 6).  Then the 9 year old began to sing and sign the theme song!  It is hard to find unique, fun and educational gifts.  This DVD is a hit!",1153094400,7,467,3.9148936170212765
2457140,5,B000CCIRY2,"My grandsons love this DVD!  I couldn't believe how much fun it was to watch it with them.  I felt we were learning something new together that really stayed with us.  I ordered several more for gifts for my friends with grandchildren and whether the children have been 2 or 10, they have all loved it.  Signalot has made this grandmother look very cool!",1140393600,2,354,4.484375
2457141,5,B000CCIRY2,"My children love watching Sign A Lot over and over again.  I can't beleive all the signs they have learned so easily. They love to play the Opposites Challenge Game with each other when on long car rides! Sign A Lot is a ""must have""!",1140307200,,233,4.177777777777778
8097306,5,B000CCIRY2,My hearing grandsons (2/ 1/2 & just 4) love this video and are already using new signs. We love th Rachel Coleman DVDs too but this is great for a change.,1392336000,,154,4.0

8097308,5,B000CCIRY2,"bought it for my 2 year old who has speech problems. She absolutely loves it, we watch it over and over again. My other grandkids who are bigger also like it and have learned all the signs. I recommend this to any one who wants there kids to learn sign..",1278288000,,254,4.1
8097309,5,B000CCIRY2,"We run a preschool/daycare and I have to tell you these are the absolute best signing DVD's for kids out there.  Even the older kids when they come home from school like to watch them.  We have tried other series, but hands down this is the best one out there.  The kids keep asking for it over and over!  It keeps them entertained and learning at the same time.  My five year old was three the first time she saw the Sign-A-Lot dvd's and she still wants to watch them now.  She remembers her signs and will correct us when we mess up.  She remembers so well that when I lost my voice for a week two months ago we just signed and she interpreted for everyone!  My kids can't wait until they make a third DVD!!  Definitely a must-have!",1265673600,,734,4.185714285714286
8097310,3,B000CCIRY2,"this dvd is good because it has a lot of music in it and my daughter loves to hear music. i like it because it keeps my daughters attention and the words they teach are easy and easy to remember. however, i was wanting to get her a dvd that taught her more words that a baby would use, they go over some words that i don't expect her to ever use such as ""salad"", but i would buy it again as just a fun dvd if you just want your kid to watch something that keeps their attention.",1264032000,4,478,3.8383838383838382
8097311,5,B000CCIRY2,"I teach a severely handicapped class for students who are in kindergarten through second grade.  My students absolutely LOVE this video.  They have learned so many signs, without even realizing they were learning! This video has become more of a reward than a supplement to my lesson plans! I just ordered the ""ABC Games"" video and I am so excited to have another ""Sign-a-Lot"" video to show my students.  A must have for anyone who is or knows a child who has communication problems or disorders!",1248048000,,496,4.744186046511628
8097312,3,B000CCIRY2,I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old mildly autistic nephew for Christmas.  He is learning how to sign as he has been slow to speak.  He seems to like the DVD pretty well but there wasn't an overwhelming interest in it.,1232409600,3,218,4.046511627906977
8097313,5,B000CCIRY2,I first taught my daughter to sign when she was 6 months old. This was one of the DVDs we used to teach her (and us) and she is now almost 4 years old and still loves to watch it over and over again. Her little brother (19 months) loves it too. The movie has children teach the signs along with an adult teacher which I think holds my children's interest. The songs are catchy too. A must for those teaching sign language to their children.,1228262400,,440,4.127906976744186
8097314,5,B000CCIRY2,"My children 2 1/2 and 5 1/2 love the video.  They enjoy watching the videos and interacting with them.  My 2 1/2year old has been going to speech therapy, so we bought him this DVD to help him learn ASL. Not to mentition helping us-his mother and father learn ASL.  Because my son loves this DVD, he wants to watch it at least every other day, and because he watches it all the time, the signs are really sticking. Our entire family has learned a good bit of ASL, and that has made a huge impact on our son's ability to communicate. His total vocabulary is improving and his spoken vocabulary has more than doubled. Within 2 weeks of starting him with sign language he was able to sign over 100 words.  We looked at several DVD's to help us with learning ASL and found Sign-A-Lot to have the most words in one video.",1226102400,3,816,4.279220779220779
