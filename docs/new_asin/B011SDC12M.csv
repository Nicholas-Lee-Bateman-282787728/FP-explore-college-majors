7340973,4,B011SDC12M,I began watching this film 2016 as one of many italiaphile indulgences....finishing watching it in February 2017 I'm astonished at the relevance this portrait of fascism has in our lives now...,1488240000,,193,5.258064516129032
7340974,5,B011SDC12M,This is a terrific flic. Acting is superb and the skillful juxtaposition of the Hitler Mussolini Rally with the interaction of the two kindred spirits and the political interaction with their normal lives makes this a movie you will not easily forget,1485043200,,250,4.976190476190476
7340975,5,B011SDC12M,"Emotionally alive, evocative performances by these superb actors. This beautifully directed film depicts the folly, the stupidity, and of course the evil of fascism, not with sensational footage, but rather by depicting the regime's penetration into the family, onto the work -a -day world,  into the life of one innocent man, which, finally, shows us Fascism's impact, in an even more immediate and horrendous way. A classic must see film directed and acted by giants.",1484006400,3,469,5.253333333333333
7340976,5,B011SDC12M,"Much was cut from the version of a very fine film.  Rather shocking to see such an editing job on a film much stronger than what is provided in this cut of the film.  The question is why crucial scenes were cut...  Enough to make one worry, given the fascist storyline.",1482624000,,269,4.235294117647059

7340981,5,B011SDC12M,"A beautiful, moving film that deals with difficult subjects.  Too little known in the US.  Wonderful acting by Loren and Mastroianni, who are cast against type in this artistically photographed movie.",1477958400,,200,5.419354838709677

7340985,5,B011SDC12M,"A very touching movie about a housewife with very narrow experience in life whose views on life and the world were completely shattered within several hours, and her eyes opened. All this on the background of fascist Italy in 1938 that darkly reminds what is happening in the World now, specially in Russia and Turkey.",1471564800,3,318,4.8
7340986,5,B011SDC12M,"With beautiful cinematography, and raw performances, A Special Day is a masterpiece of Italian cinema. Sophia Loren gives one of her best performances, and Marcello Mastroianni plays against type in a truly revelatory performance. The movie is a portrait of life in Fascist Italy during Mussolini's welcoming of Hitler to Italy. Throughout the film, the presence of the political culture is always there, seeping in through the walls as the two leads form a friendship. Truly a must-see for anyone who likes foreign cinema.",1471132800,,523,5.238095238095238
7340987,5,B011SDC12M,Beautiful and sensitive performances from two astounding actors.,1469232000,,64,7.125
7340988,5,B011SDC12M,"I saw it in Italian; not sure about the translation quality... It is a masterpiece, especially compared to the special-effect junk produced by Hollywood during the last 20 years. To me this film is also the best definition of fascism (which is not killing jews and communists as many people think). No shooting, no ""adventures"", just superb theatrical performance. Comparable to masterpieces by Mark Zakharov.",1466553600,,409,5.3076923076923075

7340990,5,B011SDC12M,"Superb film...excellent performances by  Sofia and Marcello. A little gem...it says so much with so little. Amazing how the ""media"" of that era had so much influence... just as they do now... how the average people were sheep...just as now...and how hidden people are..then...now.

7340999,5,B011SDC12M,"A very special film with two of my very favorite actors -- Sophia and Marcello. The love between them is apparent.
It touched on the subject of a  man who is fired for just being gay and the injustices of that time. They  confide
their own shortcomings to each other and form a loving bond .The acting of Sophia at age 27 as a lonely housewife
with six kids and an indifferent husband was supreme on her part.....",1462665600,,413,4.282051282051282
7341000,5,B011SDC12M,"What makes this 1977 movie more than a sentimental story -- though it is that too -- is the degree to which the main characters, who could so easily have become flat and stereotyped, are capable of surprising us (and one another, and perhaps themselves).  The setting is Rome on the day in 1938 when Hitler arrives to meet Mussolini, who was enormously popular, and be greeted by adoring crowds.  Throughout the movie, we hear in the background, but audible, the radio commentary celebrating the details of the visit almost minute by minute, while in an apartment building in Rome two people who have, for different reasons, not gone out to join the celebratory crowds make one another's acquaintance -- and perhaps make acquaintance with themselves too.  The undereducated housewife Antonietta (Sophia Loren) is a fan of Mussolini's.  She has a scrapbook with pictures of him accompanied by quotations from his speeches, but with a husband and six children to organize, she is too tired and busy to join her family in the streets.  She meets her near neighbor Gabriele (Marcello Mastroianni) when her pet mynah escapes and flies across the courtyard to his balcony.  He is a former radio commentator/announcer and he is homosexual -- and therefore deemed too ""subversive"" to keep his job.  The audience is clued to his sexuality before he reveals it to Antonietta, and it's clear that he feels that his freedom is under threat too.  A pistol on his desk suggests that the possibility of suicide has crossed his mind.  The main scenes take place in three settings -- the apartments of the two main characters and the rooftop where Antonietta's washing is hung out to dry.  It's in Antonietta's apartment that Gabriele sees the scrapbook and gently probes Antonietta's feelings about the regime.  When, later, she learns about his sexual preferences, she is forced to rethink her own ideas not just about masculinity -- because she is clearly drawn to Gabriele -- but about a woman's place in Mussolini's Rome.  She comes to see that both she and he are in some ways both victims of certain attitudes, and also to see that her attraction to him isn't simply sexual, though it certainly is that.  All of this could have been dispatched in the form of life-lessons easily learned, but the writing is so good and Loren's and Mastroianni's acting so persuasive that we feel and sympathize with the difficulties that come with the realization that the world and the human heart are stranger than we think.  The burden of new knowledge falls most on the less well-educated Antonietta, and the movie doesn't shirk from revealing that her shock drives her to think more about herself -- at least in the moment -- than about Gabriele.  And it's then that we realize something that made us, the audience, uncomfortable earlier, in the scenes where Antonietta is getting her family out of bed -- the feeling that, my God! she has SIX children, and that she seems to be the one who has to get them up, fed, going, and cleaned up after.  The early scenes with her family follow quite extended newsreel footage of Hitler's arrival, with the celebratory radio announcing and the packed crowds -- which is disturbing in a different way, and which with the domestic scenes that follow sets up the narrative perfectly.

So Antonietta is drawn to a man who turns out not to be a ""man"" by Fascist Italian standards, and we could say that her consciousness is raised accordingly.  But Gabriele is drawn to Antonietta in turn, and it's harder to say what motivates him.  Does he know himself what it is? Loneliness? a sense of superiority? playfulness? Teasing, maybe even a bit cruel at first?  Or some combination of all that?  Given their confusions, their coming to terms is convincing and moving, with nothing predictable or easy about it.  Ettore Scola's pacing of the main scenes and the developing awareness is masterful.

I need to pay tribute to the cinematography of Pasqualino De Santis.  The film has a sepia look and doesn't drain the movie of all color but hints at an earlier time, just as the audio quality of the background radio commentary does.  Both stars look great, without being made to seem glamorous or younger than they really are (Mastroianni was in his early 50's and Loren about a decade younger), though Loren's facial structure is a thing of beauty anyway.  Both are very sympathetic without being sentimentalized.  The personaland the political are delicately brought together, and there's pain to be reckoned with.  It's a different pain from that of Bertolucci's ""The Conformist,"" which also brings personal and political together in Fascist Italy, but the difference is a matter of character, not of quality of film-making.  Highly recommended.",1462406400,6,4757,4.8818407960199
7341001,5,B011SDC12M,"Every American caught up in the Utopian visions of the Presidential candidates (Trump, Sanders) should see this flick.",1461974400,,118,5.611111111111111
7341002,5,B011SDC12M,A masterpiece in every way. Uncompromising view of life during Italy's fascist reign. Great restoration of original. This is one of those must see films from Italy's golden period. The color of the film alone is astounding. It is sepia in color.,1461024000,3,245,4.857142857142857
7341003,5,B011SDC12M,"it's a short story, not a movie. A very, very good short story that makes clear how wildly underused both these actors were throughout their careers, all this distraction about sex symbols.",1460160000,2,189,4.9375
7341004,5,B011SDC12M,"This film has previously only been available in an absolutely terrible DVD issue--clearly made from an old VHS tape, pan-and-scan not letterboxed, and atrociously dubbed rather than subtitled.  This Criterion edition corrects all of that and gives us a pristine print of the film, properly subbed and letterboxed, with the original subtle color scheme restored.  A SPECIAL DAY now takes its proper place as one of the crowning glories of Italian cinema.  A subtle, perceptive, almost heartbreaking script is matched by Loren and Mastroianni in the finest performances of their careers and razor-sharp direction by Scola.  Absolutely not to be missed by any lover of fine film.",1457568000,8,676,5.289719626168225

7341008,5,B011SDC12M,"If you were in any doubt that Loren could act, then this is the film that may change your view of a much-maligned icon of 20th Century cinema. At times gritty, playing on the tradition of Italian Neo-Realism, the footage of Hitler's visit to Mussolini on the special day makes this film unique in the historical perspective it takes. Well crafted all round.",1455753600,6,357,4.682539682539683

7341010,5,B011SDC12M,"One of the great films ever.  The best pro-gay, pro-feminist, anti-fascist love story ever made. Then again how many are there.  And finally, after years of a very bad dubbed VHS transfer DVD being the only game in the US, Criterion does it right.  A serious masterpiece, way ahead of its time, at least for the depiction of a homosexual man as a 3-dimensional human being (and not a caricature in the Cage Aux Folles way).  Loren, Mastroianni are both dazzling.  A must see.",1455321600,5,475,4.607142857142857

7341012,5,B011SDC12M,"This movie was surprisingly good. It is shot in a terrific way and interleaves the rise of Facism in 1938 Italy with the impact it had on families and on persons who did not fit into the model of proper sexual attitudes. Both Mastroianni and Loren do a magnificent of portraying an intense, passing encounter.",1453507200,2,309,4.636363636363637

8724987,5,B011SDC12M,"A classic for good reason.  A timeless story of relationships when community is breaking down.  Although taking place in 1938, this story Is a cautionary tale with heartbreaking resonance with today's challenges.",1530576000,,212,5.59375
8724988,5,B011SDC12M,"A Special Day takes place in Fascist Italy on the day that Hitler entered the country and gave a speech. He was welcomed by a cheering crowd of giant proportions. Just about everybody came out to see him, waving flags.  it was hard not to attend because any dissenter was afraid of being known. They used actual footage which was fascinating to see. Amidst this significant point in history a downtrodden housewife chases her escaped minah bird across the courtyard and knocks on the door of the nearest apartment for access. She meets Marcello Mastroianni, impeccably dressed and charming.
It's really hard to imagine Sophia Loren in such a role but amazingly she carries it off. I was blown away.  The relationship that ensues, first timidly and then Well it's not what you're going to think it is",1519862400,,799,4.782608695652174
