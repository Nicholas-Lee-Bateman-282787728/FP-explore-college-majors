2268138,5,B00096S3SQ,"Anime is full of cliches.  In fact, a genre slowly establishing itself within anime is the anime-parody genre; the cliches are so obvious that a number of series are cashing in on them for a few laughs.  Originality is a rare trait today in anime.

Enter Gilgamesh.  This is a love or hate series...I don't think there's much middle ground.

Animation: The animation quality in some of the initial episodes can be a bit sub-par, but it gets better.  In addition, the character designs and settings are truly inspired.  They don't have the characteristics of typical anime characters...when was the last time where anime characters actually had lips?

Music: The OST isn't something you would listen to in your spare time.  However, it complements the atmosphere of the anime well, and for that it gets top marks.  In addition, I really enjoyed the ending music.

Plot & Characters: This is where the series shines and earns every bit of 5 stars.  The plot is very mysterious- THE LESS YOU READ ABOUT IT THE BETTER.  Suffice it to say that this is an anime where most episodes raise more questions than they answer.  The plot continues strong throughout the course of the anime and has an ending that is bound to provoke discussion (and already has).  The characters are very likeable; you'll care when they are in peril...even while you're completely confused as to what is going on.  If you don't like to be confused at times...this anime isn't for you.  Also, rarely has an anime so tastefully handled matures themes as this series does.  Many animes are about middle school students, have a very kiddy feel to them, and don't begin to touch any dark or mature themes.  It's not that there is nudity or anything- that would be a big turn off.  However, this isn't a series for kids...it goes down some of the darker alleys of the human condition.

This is a series that has thus far been greatly overlooked.  It doesn't have flashy, cutting edge animation.  In addition, the first episode is particularly confusing.  That's too bad...it's easily one of the best sci-fi/mystery animes to come out in a long time.  It looks like ADV is spending a good bit of expense to make the packaging and discs for this series look nice.  Hopefully, that will entice more people to pick this title up.  Gilgamesh is a rare mix of suspense, mystery, great characters, and originality...don't miss it!",1121040000,19,2387,4.744525547445256
2268139,5,B00096S3SQ,"I've seen the entire series, and I have to say... Why didn't this get more attention?!

The Amazon review is very misleading - the animation, while muted and certainly not of the caliber more popular anime may get, is very unique and fits the dark story well.

The story of Kiyoko and Tatsuya is full of many twists and turns, bringing you through a full range of emotion as you go. It also uses many conventions (not cliches) in interesting and inventive ways, as well as giving you a small history lesson or two along the way.

I highly suggest Gilgamesh to anyone who enjoys original, dark stories and is willing to sacrifice a bit in the animation department in order to get a great story.",1120867200,8,693,4.484126984126984
2268140,4,B00096S3SQ,"One of ADV Film's newest releases ""Gilgamesh"" is a bizarre mixture of sci-fi, mystery, and a dash of ancient history all served up with a gothic twist. When I read the original synopsis from a press release it seemed like a rehash of The Animatrix's ""The second Renaissance (parts 1 & 2) with the similar commection to Mesopotamia and the blocking out of the sky. However,having viewed the disc it now seems that this show is something comepletely different.

The show quickly introduces the setting. The discovery of an ancient tomb belonging to the ancient Mesopotamian King Gilgamesh is discovered to have supernatural qualities. Hoping to capitalise on these qualities an international scientific hub, Heaven's Gate, is built over the tomb to exploit whatever potential lies within. A terrorist attack on Heaven's Gate causes a world-wide catastrophe known as the twin X phenomenon (the catastrophe happens on Oct 10) which interupts the electromagnetic fields on the planet rendering computers useless and changing the sky into a psychedelic mirror.

The new world is a ashy, dark world where civilization is in decay. We are introduced to siblings Tatsuya and Kiyoko- brother and sister on the run from debt collectors. Their deceased mother left themw ith huge debts and their father has disappeared. Left to their own devices they are constantly on the run until they meet 3 mysterious people (the gilgamesh) who take out the debt collectors. Tatsuya and Kiyoko are grateful for their help but still have reservations about these 3 men.

Another three people arrive working for a mysterious lady known as the countess. These being are after kiyoko and Tatsuya also but their motive sren't known. A psychic battle between them and the the 3 men known as ""gilgamesh"" ensues as the siblings are caught up in a battle which will determine their fate.

These first disc really did a good job of establishing mood and introducing to the cast of characters. There are many questions that crop up while watching these first episodes which will have you wondering how everyone is connected and what their motives are for seeking Tatsuya and Kiyoko. Fans who like anime which really build up suspense and mystery will definetly enjoy. I was reminded of RahXEphon while watching the disc as I attempted to try and guess what was going to happen next.

The animation was overall very good. The character designs are very different from your typical anime styles which has been applauded by some fans and criticised by others. The characters have a more ""western"" art style in the sense that they have full lips on most characters and the eyes are slightly more western comic book styled. Personally, I think the design work and really gives the show a different look while still maintaining its anime flavor.

I am a little disappointed that there aren't any extras included in the collectors box. Given the current state of anime I guess we should be happy a artbox exists with so many companies trying to save money. Still, for $10+ over the DVD only version it seems a rather high asking price for just a box.

Overall a great show - Recommended!",1117756800,9,3145,4.911487758945386

8057569,4,B00096S3SQ,"After a terrorist attack transforms the sky into a psychedelic mirror, society struggles to rebuilt itself and two powerful forces wage a secret, terrifying war.

  Welcome to a devastated planet earth where no computers are functioning and society is no longer the way we know it.

  Trying to restore order is Orga, a tiny group of mutants with amazing powers led by a wealthy  and mysterious widow known as ""The Countess"".
  Their enemy is ""Gilgamesh"".  A team clad in black leather and bow only to their leader Enkidu, a dangerous scientist who seeks to finish the attack on Earth that he began many years before.

  Caught between these two warring groups are two runaways, a brother and sister who have the key to destroying the world or saving it.

  After watching the first five episodes of ""Gilgamesh"", all I can say right now is... ""Wow"".

  It's a story that reminds me of the ""X-MEN"" in terms of mutants fighting each other for their own cause but at the same time, very unique and very dark.  And also reminiscent of ""The Matrix"" with all the leather being used and the use of interesting characters that you are not yet allowed to get too comfortable with so early in the series.

  The first episode was a bit cerebral to understand but necessary in introducing the viewer to why there are two warring groups and what led to the terrorist attacks.

  Fortunately, ADV included a glossary of terms to help the confused viewer.

  The story pretty much focuses on our unsuspecting brother and sister as they are running away from some type of authority and they run into a house where laboratory experiments were being done with salamanders.
  There they meet the leather-clad group who befriends them by protecting them from another group.

  During the battles, the runaways start to see a gruesome transformation that these black leather clad group are turning into.  Monsters.

  The runaways then end up staying with another group who seem to want to help them but both are confused by the kind of special abilities both groups are exhibiting.

  This is pretty much the first five stories which introduces the characters and a question is put out to the viewer of ""which side are you on?""
  Which side can the brother and sister trust?

  ""Gilgamesh"" is actually a different kind of anime with character designs that tends to blend in a visual kei rocker style to the style exhibited in many Atlus ""Shin Megami Tensei"" video games and  I tend to dig different styles for anime.

  I like the dark appeal of this anime and the fact that even the good guys seem a bit well... not so good.  Both sides fighting for their own cause and assuming that you know which side is the good side.

  The DVD features very good voice acting on both the Japanese and English dubbed tracks.

  Special features include a clean opening and closing animation, character art gallery and production art gallery.

  I really enjoyed ""Gilgamesh"" for being different and also for putting that ""doubt"" of whether the good guys, really are the good guys or not.

  The behavior of the Orga team (like The Countess"") makes me question the team because for good guys, they seem to be a bit overly spooky.

  All-in-all, a very enjoyable anime series and I can't wait to see more episodes.",1218585600,,3281,4.692035398230089
8057570,4,B00096S3SQ,"Gritty, bleak and beautiful. These are just a few of the words one can use to describe Gilgamesh - Whose Side Are You On?"". There are a painful number of post apocalyptic anime out on the market and it is within that genre that ""Gligamesh"" falls into. However, Gilgamesh separates itself from others in this category due to its harsh, gripping tale of sibling love and the realization that an azure sky is something we take for granted.

  What strikes one first about this anime is it's unusual art direction. The characters in Gilgamesh are a fusion of both Eastern and Western styles, mixed in with a hint of 19th century European character. We are presented with people who are most definitely human but at the same time exhibit seemingly alien like qualities. Eyes that are almost bug like and bodies that move in unnatural ways are just some examples of this. Interestingly enough however this anime is strikingly peaceful to look at. While we are given a rather drab background to our setting, the dark pallets are a welcome change to the bright, blinding pastels of most anime.

  The music in Gilgamesh is a mixed bag. While the subtle, atmospheric sounds that fluctuate in the foreground do the job, there are some outstanding pieces scattered around as well. In counter to this, a majority of the score is nothing new or exciting and it can be difficult at times to hear the actors speak their parts above the thunder of violins that charge with a fairly unoriginal flare.

  What I found to be the most impressive aspect of Gilgamesh however is the voice acting. Ignoring the Japanese voice actors (English acting, be it great or poor, is part of the review, not its native tounge) the actors voice our characters are a wonderful fit. Not because they necessarily have outstanding voices or soothing tones, but because they truly seem to act. You'll find no over the top antics here, in it's stead however is enunciation, proper dialogue pauses as well as genuine pacing in the writing. Anyone who has ever acted before will instantly recognize the talent of the voice talent here.

  Fans of Boogiepop Phantom will no doubt enjoy Gilgamesh and as such this volume is extremely difficult to follow at times. While watching the first few episodes, the viewer must come to terms with the fact that they aren't going to understand a great deal of what is going on. Things are eventually explained however and the path to these revelations is definitely worth the journey.

  This is Intellectual Anime at it's very finest and although the means in which conclusions are drawn within the show may not be conventional, they are most assuredly captivating.",1172188800,,2662,4.781659388646288
8057571,5,B00096S3SQ,"I've gotten a strange vibe from what I've seen so far, but I like it quite a bit!  It's definitely gothic -- but not ""bad gothic"".  Kind of Dr. Who gothic -- the four telekin-whatevers are all a little bohemian, and seem to be sharing a memorable chapter of friendship and commaradere(?) together, which is a vibe I like in anime.  The series had me when the leader of the team apologizes to a group of punks for their rude behavior to him and his friends, gets knocked around a little and thrown to the sidewalk without then deciding to telekin-whateveredly set the punks and any bystanders in the place on fire.  He just dusts himself off and kind of sheepishly laughs at his friends who were worried he'd been hurt.  It's a sweet, kind-hearted moment.  Not enough of those in the world, and I guess I knew I could learn to like the characters at that point.  The animation is not really cutting edge, but more than makes up for that in originality and coolness.  It's at least a little bit perverted, and in my opinion why else would anyone buy anime?!  Only up to volume 3 but I have a good feeling about this one...",1156032000,,1120,4.371980676328502
8057572,2,B00096S3SQ,"Kiyoko (17 years old) and her little brother Tatsuya (14 years old) are on the run because of a debt left behind by their late mother.  Taking shelter in an abandoned mansion on a rainy night, they are rescued from their pursuers by a mysterious group of teenagers in black uniforms.  Shortly afterwards, they are rescued from their rescuers by a new group of teenagers who bring them to a the home of the Countess.  The woman is unnaturally interested in Tatsuya and pays off their mother's debt, essentially buying the two of them.

The two siblings are the children of Enkidu, the famous terrorist who caused the sky to take on a reflective, mirror-like appearance, a phenomenon known of as the ""Sheltering Sky.""  He was a prominent, highly respected scientist before the incident and the Countess, one of his former colleagues, is obsessed with what happened to him and what his motives were for what he did.

It eventually becomes apparent that several different factions involved in a mysterious war want to use the siblings' abilities for their own personal gain.  Although the siblings just want to be left alone and maintain their independence, they end up getting sucked into the conflict.

Maybe my biggest complaint is the music.  Gilgamesh is supposed to be a creepy show, but the soundtrack is like something from a really cheesy, black and white 50's horror flick.  The music absolutely RUINS the fight scenes, which aren't anything spectacular to begin with (lots of lightning and threatening looks, but little movement).  I'm not too fond of the way the monsters were designed either; the design is campy, unoriginal, and unappealing.  They almost look as though they were modeled after the standard robots in mecha-anime.

I'm also not very fond of the art, although I got used to it after a while.  The expectations that the first episode left me with were all let down; the siblings' powers are unremarkable and rarely exhibited.  Kiyoko does close to nothing, while her brother lets himself be manipulated until almost the very end.  The mood of the show is heavy and dull, and it's frustrating to watch; you keep on waiting for something to happen, but it just drones on.  The end will probably make you cry (it sure made me cry, even though I wasn't into the show at all), but don't let yourself be fooled--it's not the show, it's the Beethoven.",1147737600,3,2368,4.807407407407408
8057573,1,B00096S3SQ,"I bought this disk with high hopes to start a new series, Unfortunatly, the only thing that kept me awake to see the entire first disk was heckling this tripe with my friends.  It is really disapointing to hear so much about a series and to then realize that both the English Dubbing and the Japanese subtitling was atrocious, the animation was sub standard and the plot was mind-numbingly boring.  Poke-mon has more depth than this.  The episodes were repetive replaying just the same animation from past episodes and in some it seemed as if there was about 5 minutes of new animation.  All together one of the worst anime I have ever seen.",1138579200,2,641,4.5964912280701755
8057574,3,B00096S3SQ,"Tatsuya and Kiyoko Madoka are on the run from a vicious gang after their mother dies leaving them with some pretty big debts. If they are caught, they could face slavery and a life of prostitution...or death. Oh, did I forget to tell you that they are the children of a mad terrorist that sent the Earth back to the technological level of the Dark Ages? In an event called ""Twin-X"", a magnetic dissonance has covered the Earth, most evidenced by the ""Sheltering Sky"" that has turned the atmosphere into a shimmering mirror. No more blue skies and clouds. On the run, Kiyoko and Tatsuya take shelter in what they believe to be an abandoned mansion. Little do they know that inside are a trio of young adults with psychic powers who will try to enlist them on the side of Gilgamesh in a battle to shape the world anew.

The mood and feel of Gilgamesh is obviously very apocalyptic and dark and the very drab colors and use of shadow in the show is applicable. But the animation is so BAD that it distracts from the storytelling. Even Gatchaman from the 1970's and the 1960's Speed Racer had more fluid movement than the chracters in Gilgamesh. I remember seeing an animation spoof a long time ago called ""The Adventures of Badly Animated Man"" where the hero stayed in the same pose no matter what he was doing. This is pretty reminescent of that. It's almost like you're watching badly articulated porcelain dolls. And it's a real shame. If this anime had been done right, it might even have been scary! You get used to the badness after a while but more money should have been used.",1130630400,3,1581,4.508710801393728
8057575,3,B00096S3SQ,"When I rented this DVD, I didn't have any expectations for the show except it was going to be gothic. It definitely has that feel since most of the time, the animation is gray and very dull. It is definitely one of the anime's big pitfalls, the animation. The show is not flashy in any aspect of all. The first episode is very bad at not having enough animation. For example, people are speaking and gasping in the crowd but I didn't see any one actually doing it, just these silohettes of people gathered together. The fighting isn't any better- no cool moves are shown and the monsters are as stiff as today's robots.

Another problem with the show is the voice dubbing. It is unrealistic and boring. When the terrorist attack was happening, the people sounded more annoyed that frantic about the event. Also, all of the voices sounded the same- monotone and soft. The show needs a lot better voice actors. Maybe the Japanese dubbing is better, but I didn't have time to rewatch it.

The only thing that keeps the anime afloat is the story. I enjoy how it keeps you in the dark about who is good and who is bad. There is also plenty other of mystery dealing with the myth of Gilgamesh too. Another plus with the story is it has good flow and balance with action even if though it isn't spectacular.

If you are a person who can stand mediocre presentation for a show with a good plot, then you should give Gilgamesh a try. I prefer something a little more exciting, but I got used to the lack of life after the first couple of episodes. The show sort of grew on me.",1127433600,2,1567,4.359589041095891
8057576,3,B00096S3SQ,"I love anime and have watched countless anime & fansubs but I wouldn't consider myself an anime fanatic (or otaku), but when I read all the reviews and heard the hype about GILGAMESH I rushed out for a copy.

It wasn't a huge disappointment, but it certainly isn't worth seeing over, say, ELFEN LIED, SAMURAI CHAMPLOO, or PARANOIA AGENT.  First of all, I like the character designs. If GILGAMESH was a painting, it'd look really cool. Unfortunately the animation is SO low quality, it reminded me of the early 80s animation of HE-MAN AND THE MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE or the crappy Season 3 TRANSFORMERS (the season that was broadcast after the movie was released where the animation was done by a U.S. studio).

In fact I could hardly believe this was a 100% Japanese anime because the animation was bad (the only anime worse was SIN - but that was produced by a U.S. studio specifically for a U.S. market).

The story was okay. Not great and definitely not original but it was okay, although I did find it boring once in awhile.

I've only watched the first DVD (which, I'm reviewing) so I'm not sure if it picks up later, but the first 5 episodes was highly unoriginal, poor quality, and a little boring (not slow, just boring). But I doubt I'm going to see the 2nd DVD.

I would recommend seeing GHOST IN THE SHELL TV:S.A.C., ELFEN LIED, SAMURAI CHAMPLOO, or PARANOIA COMPLEX. If you've seen all of those already, then GILGAMESH might be worth a rental, but not a buy.

I would give it a 2 1/2 stars, but since you can't give half-stars, I give it a 3 for the benefit of the doubt.",1123286400,8,1583,4.4567474048442905
