280990,4,630025884X,I love watching Robin Williams-his quick mind and endless engery is great fun.  One question....when will Live at the Met be released in DVD?,1106956800,5,141,4.875
280991,5,630025884X,"Can't believe this is 18 years old already! Boy, do I feel old!!

Williams can be very vulgar...and intermittently the funniest human being on earth.  You never know what he is going to say.

He hasn't really grown up and never will, but he exudes an uncommon aura that is worth seeing.  There are not many people like him on stage.  He is also a very good actor.",1093996800,5,363,4.279411764705882
280992,5,630025884X,"This is Robin Williams at his Best.
The Visuals are extremely funny.
Along with his humorous interpretations
of daily life, and how a child sees their world.
I would love to see Robin Williams-Live at the Met on DVD.
This DVD would make a great addition to any Library.",1054598400,11,269,4.510204081632653
280993,4,630025884X,"This is on one of the Funniest Robin Williams stand up performances ever to be made his witty and outlandish perfomance on stage is captivateing, in this video he uses and combines the topics of drugs, sex, and even his young son to place you in stitches I was on the floor withen the first five minutes and you will be too. A barrel of laughes like no one else can produce.",983491200,13,374,4.208333333333333

281035,5,630025884X,"Do you really need a review?  I mean, it's Robin Williams, for God's sake! He was one of the funniest people to have lived in our time! Buy it, you won't regret it!",1487289600,2,164,3.9696969696969697

281037,5,630025884X,"Got some Tracking Issues a bit but perfect once adjusted. No idea when/if this will be on DVD/Blu-Ray, but this will have to do.",1457049600,,128,4.375
281038,4,630025884X,"Very funny!! We ordered the movie & just before we got it, we herd of his passing! So sad. But we received a Great product from you. Thank you!",1410307200,,143,3.9655172413793105
281039,5,630025884X,"THE funniest hour of standup comedy you will ever see. It just keeps on coming at you in rapid fire succession, each line funnier than the last. You can't catch your breath! When this aired I was floored, stunned. With this performance Williams took live performance to a dizzying new height. And now with his passing it is very unlikely that it will ever be surpassed. Buy this, at any cost, while you still can. This is the absolute standup master at the height of his powers. Brilliant.",1409011200,,489,4.568181818181818

281041,5,630025884X,"Everyone knows how funny Robin Williams is, so no point in me repeating how great this special was- just take my word for it. An hour straight of nothing but listening this intelligent wildman will leave you with a stomach & cheeks that hurt from laughing so much. I've been looking for this to come on DVD for YEARS. My mother desperately wants a copy, so does my aunt, and I would love it for myself, too. Yeah, you might be able to view it someewhere on the Internet ""bootleg"", but that isn't the same as having a legit DVD copy. There were so many outstanding comedy specials done back in the 80's on HBO that took time to get to DVD (Sam Kinison's, Rodney's Place & many more)- I can only hope HBO will wake up & realize fans don't just want 21st century Robin Williams work on DVD- we want it all! Even if only available in a boxset w/ his other specials, at a higher cost, I would still pay it just to get this. It's THAT funny. I'll keep begging & bugging HBO to see this put on disc- hoepfully, though, some smart workers at the company will see enough good reviews out there & realize how much fans want this today for their collection. Here's hoping!",1323820800,2,1161,4.257918552036199
281042,4,630025884X,"I first acquired this on cassette almost a decade ago. Hearing him live and nervously explosive with humor, was a side I never imagined from a man of his background. Being analytical by nature, it opened my mind up toward those people who entertain us throughout the years and the view in which they really hold on the world around us and in life as a whole. Didn't care for how often he used his language at times with ""God"" and vulgarity but otherwise he seems to really nail it in each subject he carries on about. Absolutely hilarious and a must have for anyone understanding that decade of our lives.",1311379200,,605,4.45945945945946
281043,5,630025884X,"This was an HBO special recorded at the Met in New York, and the always manic Robin Williams is in absolute top form on everything from gay football coaches to drug abuse.  This tape is an absolute must for expectant parents as Williams in his unique and inimicable fashion relates going trhough pregnancy, childbirth, and early parenthood as only he can.",1126310400,8,355,4.819672131147541

7807563,5,630025884X,Robin Williams is one of the best stand up comics ever! He gets into the crowd and finds some very famous people and even brings one up on stage!  It is well worth your time if you like to laugh!,1509580800,,195,3.875

7807565,5,630025884X,"Robin Williams is my HERO! Since the first time I seen him ""Live at the Met, in San Francisco"", he taught me how to improve, flip ANYTHING into a joke, or silly stuff - just to get a smile from people around me. I am slowing building up my collection of everything Robin did.",1501113600,,275,4.111111111111111
7807566,5,630025884X,"I've been waiting years for Live at the Roxy to be on DVD and finally it happened!  This is early Robin Williams and has been my favorite of his standup routines.  To me, even though I know others would disagree, Robin was the BEST standup comic of all time!!  This is the DVD where he says ""You're only given a touch of madness......you must'n lose it""  He was and is the greatest entertainer of all time!!  RIP, RW",1497916800,,416,4.282051282051282
