8324577,4,6303154441,"Mr. Carlos Fuentes has indeed a lot of talents. Besides being one of the most prolific and published authors in the Spanish language, he is an excellent and I must say surprisingly entertaining program host. As far as I know this is the first of a series of 5 programs he made for the television and this is the VHS version. DVDs unfortunately haven't been produced yet. And that is one of the main problems with this release: the picture quality is not so good. The main theme and scope of the program though is very interesting because it describes in a very illuminating and entertaining fashion the relationship and history of the Spanish and Portuguese speaking peoples. This is no easy task, but Mr. Fuentes embraces it with an ease and charm that makes you feel engaged and interested. He travels with us to Europe and America and describes situations and events related to custom and history while they are actually happening. One wonders why Mr. Fuentes hasn't become an knowledge program leader in culture programs? The program was done for some time ago so it is a little bet outdated, specially when he shows us the impact of bullfighting in history. In my opinion he draws to much attention to an activity that in our times is dwindling badly. We have to admit that at least in Mexico and Spain this activity is becoming obsolete and is being irrefutably replaced by other activities like football.
I think this release is outstanding and I have tried to get hold on the other VHS in the series to no avail, For reasons out of my understanding, Amazon will not let us buy these for residents in Norway. So I must allow myself to have 2 wishes: 1. That the programs will be made in BlueRay versions and 2. That it will be possible to buy them in Europe. Then I would gladly keep buying and enjoying them.",1274832000,,1816,4.556574923547401
