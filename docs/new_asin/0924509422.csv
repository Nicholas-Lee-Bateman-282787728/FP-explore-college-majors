7793393,2,0924509422,"the title (Drawing: learning Professional Technique)is very much contradecting the content, i suppose it is for beginners only, and only for beginners.
the reviews tricked me so i bought it and was watshing it hopping i see professional techniques. but there was just simple perspective for beginners, does not worth the price.",1336176000,,327,5.3076923076923075
7793394,3,0924509422,"There are some very good pointers here by a very good sketch artist.
Tony Couch uses on demand camera drawing to explain different drawing techniques, for example shapes, perspective and shading.
I sure wish I had seen this 40, years ago.",1242432000,,238,4.829268292682927
7793395,3,0924509422,Tony Couch is an excellent artist.  Although in this video he explains way too fast and fails to show us how he gets all the  details into the drawing.  The video is one hour long.  It seemed to me the explanations Tony gave were rushed for the sake of getting all of the material shown in one hour.  I think this video is better suited for intermediate artists who want to learn other techniques of drawing and painting in water colour.,1058745600,12,437,4.345679012345679
7793396,4,0924509422,"Well, I just finished watching it, and had to write a review! What a great video! Wonderful for someone just starting out, or a longtime professional, Drawing: Learning Professional Techniques, teaches you just that; professional techniques. And although it shows you how to master many, many tricks and interesting styles, it allows and encourages you to develop you own way of drawing. The only thing preventing me from giving it a perfect five, is that it is awfully short, and could go into some subjects in some more depth, but overall, Drawing: Learning Professional Techniques, is a great video. If your just getting into art, or have been producing it for some time, but would like to try out some new techniques, this is a good buy.",992217600,24,741,4.84251968503937
