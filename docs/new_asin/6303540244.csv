8338381,4,6303540244,"Catherine is introduced to a new hire at the District Attorney's Office.  One evening she sees him go to the tunnel entrance in Central Park.  It turns out that the man (named Devin) was Vincent's closest boyhood friend.  He has returned after a decades-long absence from the tunnels.  Making  extensive use of flashbacks, this well-crafted episode gradually reveals to  us details of Vincent's relationship with Devin, and details behind  friction between Devin and Father.  We learn of childhood dreams, never  realized.  The final shot, a flashback moment involving Vincent and Devin,  is quite moving.
In 1998 I conducted a poll among Beauty and the Beast  fans asking them to rate the 44 episodes of the first two seasons on a  1-to-10 scale.  31 fans participated.  ""Promises of Someday""  finished 11th out of the 44 episodes.
I placed ""Promises of  Someday"" 20th in my own personal 1-through-44 rank-ordering of the  episodes.",960422400,7,933,5.1066666666666665
