I enjoyed how they didn't just have everything turn out perfect.

Like how it made the characters think.",1369440000,,138,4.48

us unstead of choosing our own.",1369267200,,141,4.68

5184375,4,B008VBSQLA,"I saw this movie and decided to purchase it.
I enjoyed it very much but I did think that the acting wasn't great in it,not sure if it was a low budget movie,it seemed looking at the cast members,quite a few were from the same family! It was a little amateurish.
I also thought that it was quite slow,but none the less I did really enjoy it.",1368316800,2,340,4.08955223880597

5184378,4,B008VBSQLA,"Although we enjoyed this movie, the acting is marginal and the dialogue sometimes borders cheesy. Our family struggles to have uplifting movies for our children so we were happy with the themes and message.

5184401,5,B008VBSQLA,"Excellent movie for our teen granddaughters.  Deals with real life experiences and I love the ending that is different than I anticipated,  Not the biggest production, but story line is solid.  Granddaughters are into both dance and horses, including equine therapy, so that holds their interest.  For people of faith there are some wonderful principles applied to issues of fairness and emotions.  And for people of little faith there are still good lessons to be learned.",1484524800,,473,5.171052631578948

5184457,1,B008VBSQLA,"I was held under water until I agreed to watch this train wreck. The acting was sub daytime soaps and the plot was so unoriginal we all knew what was going to happen before it even happened. I wanted to pry my eyes out with a rusty spoon after realizing the director was using different types of cameras and you could see the change in quality and lighting when the view would switch during a scene. At first I thought ""maybe this was done on purpose as a flashback or something"". Nope, not even my feeble mind could accept that reasoning after we got further into the movie. Please send this crew back to film school for another try.",1477526400,,634,4.336134453781512

It shows a young woman who has to deal with the loss of a dream and shows how this can still work out for good. it was clean, wholesome and a good one for family viewing.

5184511,3,B008VBSQLA,"I generally liked the movie. A couple of times I felt like the music resembled a Disney sound track. ""Going On A Date."" Sounded like something from the ""Little Mermaid."" That was a beautiful Friesian horse! I loved how Riley showed the love of Christ to a teammate who treated her poorly and the fruit that began to come out of that. I was disappointed when Riley asked her dad why God was doing this to her and her dad responded with something like.. . "" I don't know but whatever it is we know it is good."" When difficulty and tragedy gets blamed on God I get sad and angry. I don't believe that this represents the God that I know and love. It is true that difficulties and tragedies do happen. The God that I believe in always,always, always, desires to bring good from whatever we face in this life or "" restore what the locusts have eaten."" I don't believe that he ever intentionally causes us pain to make us grow though we may grow from the hard things we face.  I do believe though that whatever we face, whether it is from something we have done, something others have done to us, or even if a tree falls on a tent and we are in the tent, he wants us to know that he is right there in the middle of it with us. He is not aloof and we are not alone.",1470960000,3,1258,4.093117408906883

5184542,4,B008VBSQLA,"Nice story, but the movie could have done so much more.  I wanted more, so I watched it a second time with the commentary, and was even more disappointed than the 1st time.  Seems the crew was pretty pleased with their production, which makes me worry that they don't see how much further potential there is to be Really Good.  If they'd consider developing a bit more storyline into dance, or how dancing is judged, or perhaps Friesians, or hippotherapy....  One actor did clearly do some research into the part he was playing, and a couple others did call on their own experiences to enhance their roles a bit, but even more consultation with the wife/mother/horse trainer would have added depth and quality to the film.  I guess that's mainly what the film lacked, was depth.",1466553600,2,778,4.6911764705882355

5184563,1,B008VBSQLA,"While I would like to be generous with movies not made by the Hollywood production companies, this movie felt very much like a high school play one minute into the story. Once in awhile a high school play can be quite good. But anyone whose ever been to one knows that the actors are very unlikely to pursue a stage career because they have no gift for such a venture. Not one of the actors in Healed by Grace has a gift for acting--or if one of them did, he or she buried it way too deep for anyone to detect it. I really don't mind a movie with a story that requires little or no special effects to make it interesting. But it is hard to endure a movie with a fairly good story to be ruined by the acting. I feel certain that the director of this movie could have drawn out far better performances from the acting crew. This is presumably a Christian film and Christians should put forward a great deal more effort toward quality of workmanship than was on display in this movie. Perhaps it wasn't so much the lack of gift for dramatic performances as the lack of effort to maximize whatever level of giftedness this group of actors might have possessed.",1464220800,,1156,4.307339449541284

God has a plan for everyone; some folks do fall harder than others, but don't be discouraged if you are one of those who fall hardest because you will be lifted higher later so you can be a rock to someone else who needs your wisdom.

I felt that the movie was slow to pick up.  Only maybe half of the movie deals with the female lead and her horse.  And even then, it's not the focus of the story.  The focus is more about the female lead, her determination to go back to what she knows (no spoilers) and her friction with another female character.

5184657,3,B008VBSQLA,The movie had a good story line but the acting wasn't as good.  The actress portraying Reilly attempts to show the after effects of the brain injury were not well researched or consistent.  The producers also should have done quite a bit more research on basic barn etiquette.  I do not know a single barn that would have put a new rider let alone a rider who had had a recent brain injury up on a horse without a helemt that is riding 101!!  All in all a cute movie but just couldn't live up to its potential,1453075200,,509,4.163265306122449

5184717,5,B008VBSQLA,"Blessings to the filmmakers and actors that made this film. I thank you also for your prayers and premise that put this idea into action. Over the past few years, I have experienced several rear end vehicle collisions and then going for a fit-for-full duty appointment- the vehicle I was a passenger in spun around 3 time and going into the 4th hit the walls - front end and then to the rear end... then just over 48 hours later I drove my own vehicle and don't remember much of the ride- the next thing I know - I'm screaming that I don't have any legs... well, God's amazing and Jesus certainly answered my cries out to Him during the first collision. Remarkably, I'm physically/structurally okay however- I'm experiencing random cognition difficulties and looks like my profession like Riley's dance- all she knew and did forever changed. This movie's heart brought insight and healing to my question... why God... and I pray the last thing I remember thinking before the 2nd collision- Lord how much more do I have to suffer to have the desires of my heart... to get married and have children... may just be going on behind the scenes. Thank you again to the filmmakers and actors- also to those who watch the film with an open heart filled with the Fruit of the Spirit - and pray for others like myself that look on the outside put together and okay- but have experienced head trauma for our lives may be forever changed... and thankfully God's plan of healing and wholeness takes many forms.

5184771,5,B008VBSQLA,"I am rating this movie based on what it is, an independent Christian film.

I read the negative reviews regarding acting and production quality.  As I person who likes to support independent film makers, I can definitely say I have seen a lot worse than this movie.  It may not be quite up to the standard we expect from a big Hollywood blockbuster, but the quality did not take away from my enjoyment of the movie in any way.

I am also a Christian, so I am interested in Christian-themed stories.  Again, I can say that I have seen a lot worse.  This movie was not cheesy, not overly preachy, and it was not advocating the prosperity gospel that states that if you just get right with God everything in your life will just fall into place.  Riley's life most certainly did not magically fall into place.  Her challenge was learning where her new place was in the world.  And it was a hard lesson for her.  The message of this movie is that God was with her, even in those troubling times.",1434931200,18,990,4.360655737704918

The storyline was cheesy and simplistic but not in a good sense. It was really awful to sit through. I realized it was a ""Christian"" film 15 minutes into it because of the constant references to God and godly ways. Really? Can we say overkill?

5184893,3,B008VBSQLA,"Pros:
-This story had a good plot  and a good message with a predictably satisfying ending.
-Loved the antagonist and her moderate yet realistic growth.
-I liked the character development.
-I liked that the crisis incident was not long and drawn out, that this was truly a story about relationships and growth.
Cons:
-Pacing was off.  Too much time spent on scenes that did not lend themselves to the development of the story.
-I almost shut it off at the beginning because of the long drawn out drive that was not moving the story forward, nor did it really foreshadow what was to come.  A blip of driving and texting would have been better.
-None of the dancers were very good and too much time was spent on their dance sequences.",1412553600,3,732,4.572519083969466

I've spent enough time both places to recognize them anywhere. As such, I really wanted to like this movie and be proud of the way it represented the city, but I just wasn't. The script was horribly dry and almost insulting the way it spelled everything out for the audience. The acting was mediocre at best, and there should have been more research done into proper barn etiquette and safety around horses. The idea behind this movie was good, but the execution was less than stellar.",1412035200,6,631,4.642857142857143

The movie is realistic in a few funny ways: I liked the depiction of the community college and the presentation on Noah's flood--community colleges are really like that!  Also, I was impressed by the unfamiliar resolution and the subtle depiction of life's difficulties.  The main character has to balance work at a diner with school and living with a single, caring-yet-occasionally-disinterested dad.  There is a beautiful mother figure in the relationship between the young woman and her dance instructor.  This is the opposite of the heavy-handed Hollywood trope of father figures, but reminded me of a dance teacher I know and seemed more true to life.

The premise for the movie looks good, but the actual delivery was bad. I agree with many that most faith-based films lack quality actors and this film is no exception. When the main character supposedly sustained a brain injury following a traumatic car accident the attempts by the actress to show physical disability and impaired speech was awful. I agree with another poster who mentioned the horrible dancing. I know there have to be actors that can be found who are truly exceptional dancers even for a low-budget film.

The movie was simply painful to watch. While the moral of the story was good, I believe you will enjoy the story better by reading it vs seeing it. The video quality, lighting, and editing feels like a movie made for a high school assignment on the family video camera. I'm sure the ""actors"" are all great human beings, but actors they are not and struggle in their roles (though the physical therapist is probably the best of the bunch).

I also thought it was odd for the Doctor to be dishonest with her about her chances of recovery.  I would've preferred to see her modify her dance or make some other attempt to succeed at what she actually loved the most.

Horseback riding is a lot of fun, and horses are wonderful creatures, but accidents happen, and not wearing a helmet while on horseback is a bad idea. Just saying.",1391299200,,476,4.482758620689655

I really enjoyed the acting performed by the cast. I could tell they were doing their best to pull it off and it has to be hard when Hollywood seems to have so much more to offer but......what Hollywood doesn't have is hope for the future. The Blessed Hope is for every believer and these people have that message to share. I was impressed by their drive to put this together and that speaks volumes. No, it won't be a block buster nor will it win any top awards but it will win HEARTS and in an eternal prospective, that is far more important than all the raw glitz and appeal coming out of today's bad-message movies. I gave it five stars for their effort and for the Biblical truth that this great group of people put forth.

Her trainer becomes her future husband. She questions God about why he allowed the accident to happen. She was talking on her cell phone and not paying attention to traffic when the accident took place. It wasn't God's best plan for her, but he used it for good.
