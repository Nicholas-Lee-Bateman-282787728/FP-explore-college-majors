.
ASSIGNMENT: OUTER SPACE (aka ""Space Men"") (1960)  is a stinkfest of the first order! It has all the earmarks of a bad sci-fier:
1.) A ""name"" actor trapped in a bad movie, in this case:

2.) Made in Italy
3.) Crappiest special effects that include toy rocket ships
4.) Sleep-inducing story
5.) Lousy voice-over actors for the American version
6.) Cheapest of sets

Get this plot:
When a ship called Alpha 2 enters our solar system, there's concern that its overheated photon engines will destroy Planet Earth. :?o

That must be one hu-monstrous motor!",1343433600,,872,5.78125

8351529,2,B0025ZIG7M,"To be a reporter in space must be an exciting job, especially when you are on a mission in space in 2116.  Ray Peterson, aka IZ41 in this future where High Command numbers everything, aka Rik Van Nutter in the real world, who played Felix Leiter in the James Bond movie ""Thunderball,"" is our reporter.  Somehow Ray has managed to get himself on board a spaceship headed to galaxy M13.  One of the first things I found interesting is the trip to another galaxy.  Galaxies are generally light-years away, so a trip to galaxy M13 would either take thousands of years, which then makes you wonder why a reporter would want to go along (a little late on that story aren't you, bub?), or there is some faster-than-light drive that the movie neglected to describe.  No matter, because the mission to M13 is suddenly redirected to Venus to try and stop the Alpha-2 space ship that is emitting a ""photonic"" field that will burn up the earth.

A brief aside:  ""Photonic"" has to do with light and the manipulation of light.  Theoretically that could include an infrared field of great intensity.  However, such a field that would burn the earth would also emit intense amounts of light (kind of like a sun), and our would-be rescuers would not have had to worry about stopping it.  Of course, then this movie could not be made.

Before our space men and at least one woman, head off to Venus they have a close encounter of the collision kind with Phobos, a moon of Mars, and Mars itself.  The first encounter turns out to be survivable, the second encounter not.  Interestingly, the first special effect was also slightly better than the second.

After rescuing the guy who fell to Phobos (that almost sounds like a movie title), the space men (and one hot babe, Lucy, aka Y13, played by actor Gabriella Farinon, aka Gaby Farinon - there is a tendency for each actor in this movie to have a lot of names) all head off to Venus to rendezvous with Alpha-2.

The movie gets really exciting now!  The space people fire nuclear missiles at the Alpha-2 without success.  Then they chase the Alpha-2 around the solar system, generally doing macho guy things in the process (I guess the female crewmembers were doing macho girl things).  The ending of this movie is tense.  Will the space people save earth, or will the earth fry from the effects of the photonic field around the Alpha-2?  Watch this movie to see the exciting end!

This movie is pretty cheesy.  The special effects range from good to atrocious.  The dialogue is frequently weak to bad.  In general, this movie is unable to rise to the level of three stars.  I think the poor quality is unfortunate, because the movie does have promise.  There are some interesting conflicts between the concern and caring of Ray Peterson and the cold behavior of the High Command and the space men.  Unfortunately, the movie is so infused with bad science that the story gets lost, at least for me.

There are classic science fiction movies that are enjoyable to watch for historical perspective, or to contrast with current technology.  In the case of this movie, there is insufficient value in this movie to even have in a collection, unless you just have to have every Rik Van Nutter movie, or every movie that mentions Venus, Mars or galaxy M13.  Everyone else should go watch something better.

Good luck!",1340323200,,3342,4.642248722316865
8351530,3,B0025ZIG7M,"With the advent of the great WARNER ARCHIVE versions of the Margheriti GAMMA I films, people have been looking for better prints of his first two space films, ASSIGNMENT: OUTER SPACE and BATTLE OF THE WORLDS.  This ""remastered"" version is not it.  Imagine taking the ALPHA VIDEO version of this film (color so washed out that it looks like sepia Black and White, occasional solarized spots, no black colors -- only shades of medium grey) and running it through a computer program that automatically darkens and boosts the apparent colors.  What do you get?  Essentially a ""colorized"" movie where the colors are either pink (formerly sepia) or light blue (formerly the solarized spots) but now has black colors.  This is what this film looks like.

So, while this is certainly the ""best"" version of this film available, it is still no where close to what a real color film looks like.  Another comparison would be that it is like the difference between the MOSFILM PLANETA BUR DVD that was released a few years ago and the footage seen in the ALPHA VIDEO VOYAGE TO THE PREHISTORIC PLANET DVD.",1322870400,4,1091,4.7712765957446805
8351531,5,B0025ZIG7M,"Antonio Margheriti directorial debut with a science fiction film written with Ennio De Concini:""Spacemen aka Assignment Outer Space"".
This is an unusual genre for the Italian production of the time, in fact, with some parody, it had been only one other before this: ""The Day The Sky Exploded "" by Paolo Heusch (1957).It was a genre in which I was (Margheriti is now speaking) always very close, and I wanted to prove that we could make films of fantasy value than those that were made in Italy in those years.
In fact, Anthony had to give bottom of all his imagination to make the film, which had a small budget, less than 50 million lire, and complete it in less than twenty days including special effects. Margheriti also makes his first contamination of genres, a feature that recurs in many of his works that become famous, stirring the atmosphere to that of Western science fiction, film adventurous and pioneering. Reading the plot remains puzzled by the similarities with other films, many years later, marked the history of science fiction cinema: The relationship between man and space, and between man and machine, with the crazy computer that takes control of a ' ship, as in ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" by Stanley Kubrick, or the whole story, like ""Marooned"" by John Sturges, and finally the little passage space to reach the heart of the spaceship and destroy it, which reminds the attack on the ""Death Star"" ""Star Wars"" by George Lucas; All films will be made many years later.The film was produced by Turi Vasile and Goffredo Lombardo for Titanus who, seeing the good result, made a big national launch. It worked especially the following advertising slogan: ""No scene of this film takes place on that planet in the solar system known as Earth."" The film was successful, receiving good reviews and reviews. Were also excellent sales abroad, especially in the American market, where finding favor with the public. This happened consecrated as a director Antonio Margheriti specialist and special effects, opening the way for others, and immediate production of the same type.",1282780800,2,2087,4.898305084745763
8351532,5,B0025ZIG7M,"Back when space movies were dead serious, but totally corny. This movie emerges as both. The setting is in space, on a station by earth. A space reporter has been visiting and monitering the captian and the crew. Suddenly disaster happens when a generator on a ship, creates too much power and threatens the earth. Total extinction or a brilliant reporter saving the day? we shall see!

Great movie, Excellent quality!",1273190400,,418,4.887323943661972
8351533,2,B0025ZIG7M,"A reporter on a routine mission in the 21st century. Finds he is wrapped up in a mystery that will take him from nervous intruder to a heroic mission. On the way reporter Ray Peterson (IZ41) and botanist, co-pilot and all around cutie Lucy (Y13) find time to fall in love.

In the process George the Commander (David Montresor) learns to be human and give a few rousing speeches about how man carries his nature to space with himself. Al (X15) (Archie Savage) find an opportunity to sacrifice for man kind and be remembered ""Alas poor Al""

Turns out that humanity itself is being threatened. Will this crew be able to get along and deter the threat or is destiny too strong?

The mechanics to tell the story are the use of models, old pilot helpmates and Italian 1961 concept of space fatuous. The analog interments add that space feel.
