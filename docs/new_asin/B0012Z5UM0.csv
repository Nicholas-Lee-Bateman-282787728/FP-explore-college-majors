It's the BEST animation i've ever seen, easily eclipsing anything done by Pixar here i the states. I'll likely pick up the US dvd version just to have the English language track and easily reccommend the US dvd VERSION TO any ANIME/Animation fan.",1204329600,2,328,4.771929824561403
3101021,5,B0012Z5UM0,"After reading a short synopsis and the Japanese version trailer of this movie (when looking for something to go see one evening), I figured I'd check it out.  I'm not a huge fan of a lot of Japanese anime, though some of it is cool, and I'm not normally a big fan of animated drama/action in general, but WOW was Vexille a pleasant surprise!  If I had to compare it to something, I would say it's Final Fantasy meets Titan A.E. and maybe a little bit of the Matrix.

The animation style was just beautiful!  The mix of cartoon with computer-generated animation was a brilliant sight to behold.  The scenes in this movie had fantastic dimension, color, style, and a totally mesmerizing quality.  It definitely made it very easy to find myself drawn into this futuristic world.

The story is great too!  Good character development and a sci-fi element that is at least partially believable (and certainly, if nothing else, entertaining).  Set in the year 2077, the technology is slick, clever, and cool - yet not so far fetched that you can't imagine the possibilities suggested.  Unplug and buy into the fantasy and you'll have a great time.  The movie has a bit of a Matrix quality in that (aside from its obvious political elements) there is the strong sense of an underlying (almost spiritual) theme driving the story but it's just far enough removed from the surface story that you can dig for messages if you want to or just enjoy the ride without getting into the philosophy of the film.  I like movies that have multi-faceted elements like this.  It made me want to see it again to try and draw more out of it.

In short, the movie is great!  It's more of a drama than out and out action (so it might strike some viewers as a little slow-paced in places), but the action is fun and the story is good.  The characters are such that you care about them and that draws you even further into the story.  There is also some cool music in the film, well placed with the various scenes and unique enough so that it doesn't strike as typical.  My favorite songs are ""Target Practice"" by Asian Dub Foundation, ""Bird Flu"" by M.I.A. and ""The Virus"" by Paul Oakenfold.  Again, the artwork and C.G. effects are beautiful and really fun to watch.

I loved the movie and would see it again (and will) because I'm ordering it today!  Parents who are curious about the content will be happy to know that there are no sexual themes in this film.  There is a light sub context of a love story present, but it's not the main focus of the film.  There is sci-fi action and violence but nothing bloody or grotesque.  There is a little bit of language, thus earning it its PG-13 rating.

If you like anime or just good sci-fi, both elements should please.  I recommend it.",1203638400,30,2755,4.492957746478873
3101022,3,B0012Z5UM0,"The idea is that we're losing our humanity to the Epcot world of techno dependence in which we find ourselves ensconced.  A lot of sound and fury, fueled by a high-powered techno-ambient soundtrack, with a ton of computer graphics wrapped into the slick animation package.  The scale of the theme is grand, with the life like animation (many the oriental characters, however, have blue eyes such as Vexille - the heroine) - occassionally drifting into the profiles of live actors (such as in 300), providing the perfect nexus for comtemplating the ever thinning demarcation between natural and artificial intelligence.  The film also ruminates on the current state of corporate anarchy and the ends to which that might lead. The script, however, is derivative to such a degree (almost as if the filmakers took the entire catalog of the films they saw in film school and dumped bits and pieces of them into this one) as to be laughable.  In fact, members of the audience at The Santa Barbara Film Festival were laughing. Anime meets the Teminator films, meets the Batman films, meets Apollo 13, meets films of The Fast and the Furious genre, meets Dune, meets The Man Who Would Be King, meets 12 Monkies, meets Bowfinger???, and so forth.  Animators seem to feel they have license to lift scenes from any non-aminated film with impunity, and therein lies the rub. Thus, the intended philosophical seriousness does not quite come across.  But, as the audience to which this onslaught of techno-glitzy violence is directed is for the most part too young to have seen the films from which at lest 80% of the script and set concepts are derived, the point is moot.  For this audience: you ought to be thinking about your robotic tendencies, especially on the freeway.",1201824000,4,1762,4.872909698996655
3101023,5,B0012Z5UM0,"I have seen the Japanese R2 release of this DVD. The same production team worked on Appleseed 2004, the version animated with the cel-shading technique. Cel-shading is used on this one as well but it looks a lot better, more like Final Fantasy: Advent Children. Gone is that shiny plastic look that was typical of the Appleseed 2004 characters. The producers went for a slick comic book feel, instead of the muted realism of Final Fantasy: Spirits Within. There is no pretense of recreating human movement and facial expressions absolutely perfectly. In that sense, it is more ""cartoony"" and ""comic-booky"", avoiding the creep factor of zombie-like characters with dead eyes imitating humans.

While Appleseed 2004 seemed like a drawn out, loud music video, Vexville is much better paced, with some character development, and an intricate storyline that has varying levels of interpretation. The theme is not revolutionary but it is a good showcase for the CGI. At least someone figured out that you need a plot in addition to fight scenes. Use Wikipedia to compare Vexille's plot outline to Appleseed 2004's plot outline to see that the storyline was key. The level of detail in the backgrounds is ridiculous, breathtaking in some cases. I have not enjoyed the look and feel of a movie like this since the 1st Matrix flick.

Until I see Appleseed, Ex Machina, I have to rank this one and Advent Children as the best all-CGI movies to come out of Japan so far. The producers balanced all of the factors needed to make a satisfying flick, so you are not sitting there watching a bunch of video game cut-scenes.

The soundtrack is excellent, mixing techno, ambient, reggae and soul. Paul Oakenfold provided the musical direction.

I would definitely recommend adding this to your collection of you were a fan of Spirits Within, Advent Children and Appleseed 2004. Vexville improves on the best of all those movies.",1201392000,8,1911,4.94392523364486

of the good ones. It takes place in the not too distant future when the world outlaws androids.

3101045,3,B0012Z5UM0,"This film is a completely stand alone film put together by the creators of ""Appleseed"".  It had many good points...but it still felt like it missed the mark...

FOR PARENTS AND OTHER INTERESTED FOLKS:
There really isn't anything to be too worried about on this film.  No nudity or other situations warranting that.  There are some profanities that happen occasionally.  And the violence is surprisingly tame (compared to what has been done with the ""Appleseed"" saga).  The themes and plot are intricate, though.  Still, if your kids are action aficionados, this is not the film for them...not even the right film to help expand their tastes beyond action.

MOVING ON:
Vexille is one of those niche films that will have a following...but it's still very niche.  I can say, that the visuals are very good, but not as powerful or profound as ""Appleseed Ex Machina"" (a prior CGI film from the same creators).  What do I mean from not as powerful and profound?  Well, what I mean is that the CG was A GOOD RENDERING (and definitely still well within 2008 CG capability) but seemed to lack some life in it.  I will say the cityscape was actually kinda cool, but...still the film was lacking the detailed vibrancy that we know the creators can put together.  The music was pretty cool though.  But that aside, the plot was actually pretty interesting and cool.  Very intriguing dissertations on various different social issues.  Also the story was not half bad at all.  It had fun moments and was generally cohesive.  What ultimately killed the film was weak acting and lack of strong dramatic pull.  There were very few action sequences, but of what action there was, most of them weren't special...and this is coming from someone who doesn't care as much for action as some others do (in fact many of my favorite films lack it all together haha).  But to be fair, 2 of them were kinda fun.  Still, it had a genuinely inspiring ending even though the other parts of the film seemed to lack the potency that these creators have been known for.

SPECIAL FEATURES:
there are 115 minutes worth of extra features & a little booklet showcasing some of the screenshots as well as a ""creator's interview"".  As far as the dvd extras themselves, there's too much to mention, but some highlights are ""Sori's Work as an Animation Creator"", ""Voice Acting Footage - the Voice of VEXILLE"", ""Creating the Cities in VEXILLE"",  ""Creating the Music in VEXILLE Parts 1 & 2"", ""Sori's Guest Lecture at Digital Hollywood Tokyo"", and ""Sori's Closing Comments"".  The film in general may not have impressed me much, but the special features are very intriguing and educational and worth a look.

ALL IN ALL:
This film was not as powerful as it was made out to be.  It had such a great set-up, but didn't quite capitalize on it.  Perhaps bad mis-advertising or something like that set it up for a fall.  Still, it does address good social questions and I have no regrets for purchasing it.  It's definitely not terrible, just a tad bit dry.",1332547200,,3007,4.704980842911877
3101046,3,B0012Z5UM0,"Hi,
I loved Vexille the first time I saw it, even if it got flaws, i still enjoyed it!
I have the DVD version, but as I got a new TV and blu ray player, I thought of buying this version.
The image quality is great, and sounds is amazing... but... the subtitles don't match at all...
They are totally different from the DVD version, and if u play the english dub with english subtitles, you will understand. It doesn't match the Japanese voice either... I dunno why they had to redo the sub, because on the DVD version it was perfect.
But it's kind of confusing, it's out of synchro, and it's just wrong 25% of the time.

I guess if you watch the japanese version with english dub, the wrong translation won't affect you (in case you actually don't understand japanese). But will still be kind of out of synchro.

A little disappointed...",1326931200,2,837,4.393548387096774
3101047,2,B0012Z5UM0,"It seems as if this movie was animated in a cel-shaded/ rotoscoped style that while nice looking, renders its characters lifeless. Weird to admit but I couldn't get past the fact that whenever these characters turned their heads, not one strand of hair would move, let alone blow in the breeze. It felt like watching an anime version of ""Jersey Shore"".

Watching it, I honestly didn't care who was who, why the things happening were happening and why the big deal was made over Paul Oakenfold's score. I've seen hand drawn animation that was more realistic and human than this. Even the action scenes were nothing to write home about. As for the DVD itself, it looks and sounds okay with both English and Japanese 5.1 tracks (with english subs) supplying serviceable surround sound. There are no extras to speak of but you probably wouldn't care to look at them anyway even if there were. It reminded me a bit of the sequel to Ghost in the Shell, ""Innocence"" and the problems I had with that film were pretty much the same I had with this one. An overly complex and dull plot mired by lifeless CGI.

Seriously, I'd make sure I've watched all the essential anime releases available before wasting my time with this. If only I had known that before I watched it but at least, now you know yourself.",1315785600,2,1296,4.581896551724138

3101049,4,B0012Z5UM0,"In my opinion, VEXILLE: Isolation, was a VERY entertaining film with excellent story elements and good, but not great, execution.

The brass tacks are that this film was so heavy on activity and flash that a very deserving concept and story seemed to come off too lightly.  I agree with an earlier review which stated that, sadly, some very strong dramatic opportunities were missed.

Vexille is gorgeous to look at. It's visually sumptuous, but the story is buried so deep beneath all the activity that, at the end, I was happy that the plot had reached resolution but WAS NOT TRULY SATISFIED.

I recommend it, but more to action junkies than to true cinema lovers.",1302566400,,666,4.765217391304348
3101050,4,B0012Z5UM0,"There are some spoilers in this review.

Aron and I just finished watching Vexille, an anime movie from the creators of Appleseed, which was released in Japan two years ago. The artistic styling is atypical of most anime, somewhere between traditional animation and CG animation. At first, I found it a little jarring, but quickly acclimated and found it highly enjoyable.

Vexille is aesthetically pleasing, very beautiful. While it suffers from the typical unmovable hair that plagues any anime (everyone in anime must invest in vats of hair gel), the robots have weight, the humans are expressive and the landscapes are breathtaking.

The basics of the story are these: Japan led the advancement of technology and began experimenting with cybertech. Terrified by the humanitarian ramifications of human androids, the UN forbade further research. Japan opposed the restriction and isolated themselves from the rest of the world. For ten years, no one has seen or heard from Japan, except for robotic exports from their largest technology company, Daiwa. When a Japanese diplomat calls a meeting and kills many of the remaining world leaders, the American militant group SWORD is dispatched to infiltrate Japan and find out what's happened in the last decade.

Some highlights: A limping gimp chase, huge metal sandworms, a tasteful love triangle and a pretty epic sacrifice.

Especially in contrast with our last anime purchase, Le Chevalier D'Eon, Vexille was a pleasant surprise. The story was strong, the voice-acting was solid and the dramatic execution was very good. There were a few cheesy lines, but just as many witty ones. I didn't cry, but I was choked up a few times. The romantic subplot was well-played, but didn't detract from the primary storyline. Usually, anime romances leave me cold. Best of all, it ended well. Endings are the hardest part and, most often, where anime looses me. I always end up wondering if something got lost in translation.

A vague review? A little. Vexille's plot twists a couple of times. The twists are good, but not surprising enough to let me say much about them without tipping over from review to spoiler. But if you like Anvil of Tears at all, then I expect you share at least some of my tastes. If you have the chance to see Vexille, I suggest you do so. It's a good trade: two hours of your time for a very good story.

Oh, yeah. The action is good, too. I almost forgot to mention it. I'm not much of an action buff and I rely on Aron to give our novels a little spice in that arena. When Aron says the Vexille action was good, I believe him absolutely.",1302480000,2,2608,4.808035714285714
3101051,4,B0012Z5UM0,"Well I suppose it's only right to open this review with a disclaimer.  Given my recent tear through the genre of (domestic) computer animated feature films, I suppose it's pretty much natural that curiosity and the desire to draw comparisons would lead me back to my anime roots.  After all, I reasoned, it's downright amazing how different the approach between American and Asian methodology is when concerning the art of computer-generated film:  Here in the States kid friendliness takes the foreground with just enough layered humor/ cleverness to offer entertainment to viewers of all ages.

Anime features like Vexille take a very different development path right from the onset in that this is essentially an animated version of an adult oriented motion picture.  No need to take my word for it, the synopsis verifies this reality:

In the near future, Japan has achieved a global monopoly on robotics development. In response to an international ban on android development in 2067, Japan goes as far as to withdraw from the U.N. then adapts its advanced technology to isolate itself from the rest of the world. A decade later, a secret meeting with politicians organized by Japan's leading Daiwa Heavy Industries gets raided by S.W.O.R.D., an elite U.S. Navy task force of which female lead Vexille (and her lover Leon) are members. The circumstances encountered during that raid convince S.W.O.R.D. to undertake a daring infiltration of Japan itself, and what Vexille discovers happening there could pose a threat to the future of all of humanity.

If all of this sounds slightly familiar, that's because Vexille plays upon almost all of the popular anime touchstones in near point for point accuracy.  However, what is interesting is that this piece clearly positions the nation that spawned it as the international villain with an American force called upon to come in and clean up the Japanese jumble.

On the surface this may all sound like the perfect formula for an action-packed, science fiction based thrill ride (and it is); it's also the catalyst for some pretty powerful political statements.  The danger of nationalistic tendencies, the definition of sentience, and the line separating man and machine are just some of the underlying themes presented here.  Some of it is a bit heavier handed in its delivery than others but overall the message comes through loud and clear.

And even if the underlying message translation isn't your bag, Vexille is nothing short of a feast for the optics. The production team behind the hugely successful Appleseed CG film reunites here and delivers on a blend of cell shading coupled with rotoscoping to create a visual stunner.  Truly some of the scenes more powerful segments require a second look just ensure that it isn't in fact actual footage.

Pacing is perfect with a film that progresses smoothly across it's under two-hour runtime without ever coming across as rushed or bogged down within its prose.

Critics are quick to point out a lack of plausibility with the some of the story's plot points and indeed, nitpicking certainly results in a few plot holes but I'm of the opinion that the core of the entertainment value here is found in the suspension of disbelief rather than by attempting to find faults in some of the fictional reasoning.

Now comes the trickiest part of the review, the language debate.  Like all sub & dub anime titles, Vexille is perhaps strongest emotionally when viewed in its native Japanese (with English subtitles for those of us who cannot understand the language).  However, the English dub is very strong here as well.  This one in particular seems to deviate from the original dialog more than is customary in a dub, due surely to the fact that some of the native script could well be considered offensive by many cultures.  However, what results is quite a solid English dub from Funimation's upper echelon of vocal talent (led here by Colleen Clinkenbeard).

In all Vexille is a film that does an awful lot of things really well. On the surface it is an action spectacle with cool armor, awesome technology, futuristic politics and intense action scenes.  Below the surface it's the catalyst for some intelligent concepts and serious concerns about the world around us.  I thoroughly enjoyed this one from beginning to end and feel the experience was certainly a reminder as to what it is that makes anime sensibilities so attractive to me in the first place.",1296604800,2,4462,4.9838274932614555
3101052,4,B0012Z5UM0,"Recently caught this one one Netflix streaming and it was a great way to spend two hours.  In the near future Japan has cut itself off from the rest of the world.  And tucked away in their veil of darkness something evil is brewing.  It takes a crack team of American commandos to breach the high tech defenses and get to the bottom of the mystery of what exactly is happening in the orient.

The animation is quite good and reminded me of a highly polished, extended cutscene from a good video game.  In fact, I'm surprised that they haven't turned this one into an outing for the Xbox 360 or PS3.  The storyline is quite intriguing as the lead character finds herself behind enemy lines with unlikely allies.  I especially liked the metallic monsters who were one-offs of the Dune sand worms.

Let me start by saying that I bought this based on reviews that said it was very similar to the Appleseed series. I enjoyed Appleseed Ex Machina immensely, and this ....... is nothing like it.  Not sure why reviewers even draw a similarity with Appleseed. The story is a little weak and ultimately forgettable, and it seems like a lot less time was spent designing the CGI when compared to Ex Machina.

In all I wasn't too thrilled about the storyline and the CGI and animation were just ""ok"".  If I had the choice I would not buy this again. I'll give it another watch and see if my attitude changes, but for now it's a pass.",1294444800,,705,4.2781954887218046

With the UN worried about what is going on, the US Navy Special Forces SWORD team is going in.  What they find inside the shield is astonishing, and could destroy the human race.  In this anime we get a soft, blurry ""Appleseed"" look and personal sized armored suits instead of the larger mechs.  Autonomous combat robots too.  Heroine Vexille (pronounced vex-eel) has a slim love triangle going with other warriors, but this storyline is really only hinted at.  No real character development occurs.  In total, it's a bit of ""Appleseed"" with ""Road Warrior"" and the monster/sandworm from ""Mission to Mars"" and ""Dune"" in a big action movie that was strangely hollow and just felt like stale popcorn.  Disappointing.",1291852800,,966,5.10828025477707
3101056,4,B0012Z5UM0,"It seems the big buzzword when this first came out was that is was 3D anime. While these days that term would make people wonder if you need special glasses when watching what it really boils down to is the animation is made to look like traditional anime and use traditional anime sensibilities while being made completely as a CG animated film. I think in that regard the movie accomplishes its claim. As a feature film it also accomplishes a lot of what it set out to do. However this isn't the hallmark in film making or animation the ""3-D Animated"" buzzword makes it out to be. Leave that moniker behind and you still have a good film.

A lot of the plot and visual elements are pretty derivative of other films like Ghost in the Shell and Dune if you look for them. They aren't really blatant ripoffs, but you can see some ideas ended up being similar to previous films. That's not to say the story of Vexille is derivative. It's an interesting combination of military style action, social commentary, and a somewhat nihilistic view of the future. The big reveal of this movie is pretty disturbing if you think about it, and must of caused a stir in Japan when it was first released in theaters.

The character development in Vexille is kind of stilted and depends a lot upon subtle observations to really figure out what is going on inside the heads of the major players. Because of this what I think was one of the stronger points of the film ends up being muted. Part of also stems from the ""acting"" on the screen being just as muted. While visually it adheres better to the 3D Anime concept there is a trade off. Is it enough to kill that development? Not really, but better execution on this front would have enhanced the experience greatly.

The story is interesting and there is enough character development to satisfy me. What about the fun stuff? Well there is action aplenty on Vexille. The movie actually starts off on a high note with a dynamic infiltration scene complete with explosions fast moving mech suits and lots of robots getting blown up. A little later in the film you get a nice little chase scene with a cool looking motorcycle, more robots and explosions. After a few more little action scenes in between exposition you get a pretty exciting high speed tunnel race-against-time scene. So yeah there is some good, fun action that pulls at the chords of you adrenaline junkies.

Animated films sometimes live or die by the quality of their animation. While a really good story can make up for sub-par animation the ones people remember most at least look pretty. Vexille does a great job with the animated feat they were attempting. Essentially what you are getting is cell shaded CG animation, which is why I don't call this movie ground breaking. What makes this particular cell shaded CG animation stand out is the level of depth in the art they put into it. They really do take the best elements of traditional cell drawn anime and incorporate them into this new environment. Subtle details and movements are added for realism. Shading and lighting are put to very effective use. It really is a marriage of both worlds.

Visually the movie is striking, but I never saw it on DVD and have a hard time trying to pick out what may be resolution enhancements from the Blu-Ray that aren't as clear on upscaled standard definition. Don't get me wrong. There is likely a very, very big difference. But I'm not the one to tell you that for sure. What I can tell you is the audio is kind of a mixed bag for me. Dialog scenes are at a noticeably lower volume than scenes where the music kicks in. It was annoying enough for me to have to adjust the volume to hear the talking and lower it enough to not be drowned out by the soundtrack. The soundtrack? Eh... it's okay with some good points and some areas where the music misses the fit with the movie.

The Blu-Ray has essentially the same special features as the Special Edition DVD and packs it all into a single disk. The special features list a whole bunch of things, but essentially what you are getting are two documentaries. The first one has about 95% of that stuff you are reading on the back of the BD case, and are little chapters of the pre-release documentary. Each ""chapter"" runs anywhere between less than two minutes to a little over six minutes, and cover various parts of production up to the premiere at the Locarno Film Festival. The second documentary, THE SECRETS OF VEXILLE, cover post release comments from director Fumihiko Sori along with various film footage. All in all the two documentaries cover a lot of details, and easily make up for the lack of any audio commentary on the disk.

Anime fans will definitely want to see Vexille as it hits all the marks that generally make good anime. Sci-Fi fans should be able to appreciate how the story unfolds and the implications that you end up with by the end. If you like good stories and can afford to forgive a little dry character development in a movie that hangs on said development then you're going to find something to like in Vexille as well.",1288828800,,5101,4.550108932461874

This 2-disc version has alot of interviews, footage of film festival premieres, and featurettes on music, characters, etc. so it's a must for any anime collector.",1266710400,,507,5.0476190476190474
3101062,3,B0012Z5UM0,"A Japanese scientist has found a way to replace human cells with bio-metal cells, effectively replacing the human body with an easy to control automaton that looks human but is fully under the control of another. The scientist is not satisfied with the complete conquest of Japan and has his sights set on the rest of the world. Vexille is a member of SWORD, an elite special forces team, that is tasked with infiltrating Japan after getting drawn in to a battle against the scientist and his henchmen. SWORD isn't just fighting for their lives but for all of humanity.

I watched this movie on Hulu. Being a fan of animation and of Science Fiction I was excited by the prospect of a mature but not vulgar CGI anime film. I found a story that was adequate but with several other aspects of the film severely lacking. Characters, as is seemingly always the case with anime, have dark secrets and a past that haunts them. In Vexille, though, the relationships are not ever fully explored leaving the viewer with the end results but not any resolution. We are never given enough time with any of the characters to care if they live or not. This is probably a fair complaint about most action movies, but in a SciFi film where thinking is a requirement this is a huge oversight. Finally, the CGI looks great when the characters aren't moving (look at the stills on the main product page), but the animation looks on par with last generation video game consoles, like the PS2. If this movie were the collected outtakes of a Final Fantasy game from five years ago we wouldn't think much of it. But this film came out after several other CGI films that look much better so there is no excuse for sub par animation.

Overall, an action flick that was fine to watch for free on Hulu, but I wouldn't pay for it or recommend that others do. Simply an average film at best.",1266192000,,1861,4.502958579881657
3101063,2,B0012Z5UM0,"This movie had an awesome opening and maintains energy for the first 60 minutes.

3101064,3,B0012Z5UM0,"I was expecting Vexille to be something interesting, a codename for some kind of robot or android, it turned out all it was, is the main character's name. This movie is from the same team that brought Appleseed and Ex Machina to the world and they're up to their usual visual brilliance here. Despite the excellent graphical designs and cinematography though, the story is a little flat footed and by the half-way point I found myself caring less about the protagonist and more about those around her who we see very little of aside from their brief appearances in relation to her. The audience is never given any reason to like or relate to Vexille and in fact she comes off as little more than an annoyance frequently enough during her interactions with the other characters who seem far more central to the plot than she ever does. Another issue with the story, is how rushed everything seems, the audience is literally whisked from location to location with little or no regard for pacing and by the end you're left wondering what exactly has happened as you've been given no downtime during the film itself to consider what the story is trying to get at. Despite these shortcomings, the Appleseed team is able to create an impressive world view when the movie slows down enough for you to appreciate it and there are moments which are just as powerful as either of the Appleseed movies. So if you're a fan of those two films, or just of the Appleseed team, take a look at Vexille you might find it to your liking, or you might feel like you've just suffered storyboard whiplash. I suffered the latter effect, and plan to watch the movie a few more times.",1257206400,,1659,4.589225589225589

3101066,3,B0012Z5UM0,"It doesn't come as a huge surprise that ""Vexille"" is from the people who brought the world ""Appleseed"" and its even better sequel ""Appleseed Ex Machina."" The cyberpunk flavor, the big mecha, and the futuristic world of politico-techno conflict are all firmly in place, along with some pretty slam-bang action sequences and a darker, grittier feeling. It's a pretty entertaining story -- now if only it had fleshed out the main cast a little more.

About seventy years in the future, the world is worried about the advancement of robotics technology. So the UN orders them restricted, and Japan decides to cut itself off from the rest of the world.

But ten years later, a biomechanical leg shows the UN just what has been going on in Japan. So the American tech police known as SWORD are sent into Japan to find out if the isolated country has been doing illegal robotics research, which no other country allows. They aren't, and the movie ends there. Seriously, the Daiwa Corporation has decided to guide mankind's evolution through machinery, and the the SWORD agents are met with a very warm, nasty welcome.

After being rescued by the rebel Maria, Vexille finds that the biorobotics Daiwa Corporation has reduced the once-proud Japan to a vast, barren slum devoid of truly human life. Even worse, a nanotech ""vaccine"" transforms the Japanese into mindless machines. Vexille's only hope of saving herself -- and her lover Leon -- is to join forces with a small band of rebels before Japan is completely destroyed by Daiwa.

""Vexille"" is a very different animal from the ""Appleseed"" movies. While it has the nimble shiny mecha and exploding buildings, the focus is on political machinations and evil corporations whose morality makes your hair stand on end. There's no utopia here for our tough heroine -- it's more like one of the outer circles of Dante's Hell.

The scenes in Vexille's home are colourful and streamlined, set in a futuristic city. But things get darker soon, taking us to the sickly yellow light and shabby shanty town of Japan, and things don't lighten up. And that devastated Japan is a pretty brilliant creation, both in its decayed misery and in the bleak future that its few remaining ""fragments of humanity"" have. The big flaw: the characters spend loooooong stretches of the movie just grimly talking to each other, with too little action.

Fortunately when there IS action, the fight scenes are top-notch in quality -- it has exploding buildings, missiles, battling mecha and chases through a marketplace. The fight scenes grow in intensity as Vexille and Maria reach the climactic confrontation with the Big Bad Guy. And the semi-apocalyptic finale is both shocking and inevitable -- as well as a helluva way to end a movie.

And then there's the jags, which are also quite cool -- giant wormlike masses of technology and metal that devour anything they come across. Not only are they wonderfully freaky, but they come across as a sort of cyber-sandworm from ""Dune."" Lovely.

And the animation is pretty astounding, though it has an oddly rotoscoped look in some action scenes. It's detailed and gloriously vivid, despite its grimy, shadowy look. And that includes exquisite details like snowflakes being individually swept from a windshield, or a reflection in a transparent helmet -- or even a smooth-skinned, nimble mecha exploding into a building with almost stunning speed. This glorious look almost makes up for the stretches of relatively action-free plot.

Perhaps its biggest weakness is in the characterization. It feels like they put a lot of effort into creating lifelike-looking characters. But despite the spunky Vexille and some touching moments from the Japanese cyborgs, the characters never quite come alive. Call it the ""Final Fantasy: Spirits Within"" effect. The best-rounded character is probably Maria, the tragic rebel leader who also provides a little romantic tension for our elf-faced heroine.

""Vexille"" is a flawed little semiprecious gem -- brilliant animation, a tough heroine and mildly horrific Japan. Flawed, but has plenty of chills and explosions.",1251676800,,4112,5.069526627218935

*Spoilers*

For anime fans, this will be an easy decision: Did you enjoy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Appleseed/dp/B0007OY31G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Appleseed</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Appleseed-Ex-Machina/dp/B0010358D0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Appleseed Ex Machina</a>? If so, you will enjoy 'Vexille'. The look and feel of 'Vexille' is almost identical to 'Appleseed', but that's not necessarily a bad thing. There's the same short-haired tough-as-nails military chick who's been poured into a suit of power armor; there's the same underlying (and ironic) suspicion against technology and that it might one day control us. And, of course, we have humans who aren't really humans. What more could you possibly ask for?

If you haven't seen the 'Appleseed' movies or are new to anime in general, 'Vexille' is not a bad place to start. The budget for this movie must have been *huge* by anime standards because everything looks incredibly beautiful and the voice acting is professional and smooth. I'd even say that 'Vexille' is a BETTER introduction into this style of movie than 'Appleseed', because the introductory scene setting is much simpler, and with a lot fewer dead or presumed-dead people to keep track of. That's always a plus.

Not that 'Vexille' is without faults. The plot is extremely predictable at several points, and sometimes this is problematic, because I can't tell whether the movie means to be predictable or not. For instance, the 'evil replacement humans' at the beginning is announced so obviously that they might as well have run a scroll text at the bottom of the screen to that effect, so that seems like an intentional reveal rather than a sloppy set-up, and it kind of works - since the 'twist reveal' doesn't occur until much later, the viewer is left wondering why, exactly, the switcheroo (assuming it isn't forgotten in all the explosions between the beginning and the ending). And the old ""girlfriend left behind"" chestnut is so overused that even the *main character* sees it coming a mile away, and while it IS nice to have sensible characters for once, the lack of surprise or suspense does kind of prevent complete immersion in the movie. The few golden moments of shock and surprise, for instance the internal state of Japan, tend to get lost in the really idiotic 'twists' that the writers didn't think through - like the completely ridiculous premise that a person could live completely surrounded by androids without them catching on that their companion was human. *eyeroll*

I'm being overly critical, though, as usual. 'Vexille' is a good, solid movie and a good addition to any anime collection and I recommend it. I will note, though, that 'Vexille' falls into the same trap as so many anime movies and doesn't bother to match the English subtitles for the hearing impaired to the actual spoken English dubs, which is very vexing for people like me who use the subtitles to follow the action. Oddly, we actually preferred the spoken dialogue to the written subtitles, which is strange because it usually goes the other way around with anime movies, in my experience.

3101068,1,B0012Z5UM0,"Vexille starts out promising with its interesting premise: Japan essentially removes itself from the rest of the world to pursue unchecked robotic research on its citizens. Everything else is terrible. There are a few cool moments of action, but they completely ape other, better films (most notably the recent Appleseed movies--despite what it says on the box, none of the major creative talent on those films worked on Vexille).

Willing suspension of disbelief is required for all sci-fi films, but Vexille asks far too much from its audience. It presents one ridiculous scenario after another (the most common of which are the desert sand worms made out of rapidly spinning chunks of metal). Technical designs are strange as well. The suits the film's heroes wear have a helmet design that, if created in real life, would only serve to impair the wearer's vision (and be very heavy at the same time). Things like that just don't make sense.

Vexille isn't even good as mindless fluff. I, personally, cannot stand to have my intelligence insulted by a film (especially one I watch voluntarily). Vexille starts doing it in the first few minutes and doesn't stop until the credits roll.",1242691200,2,1187,4.98989898989899
3101069,3,B0012Z5UM0,"I love futuristic Japanese Anime. They always come up with this far fetched view of the future. This movie is a great example of that genre, but...

Yes, a big ""but"". I think the idea, that the plot based on, is intriguing, yet execution of the story turns out to be not so interesting after the first half. Makers could have done a million different and more interesting things with it but they chose the safest way, I think. As a result the movie became ""Just Another Sci-Fi Anime"" instead of ""Oh My God This Is Awesome"".

The movie also has a distinct style at animation. CGI is fluid and as I've said, stylish.  My only problem with CGI anime is the human motion, or lack of it. It just doesn't feel right. For example, characters hands move around but fingers look like frozen fish sticks, no movement at all, just not natural. Exception to my comment is handshots with gun in a characters hand.

Normally I only half watch things, turning on my faithful Laptop Toshi and sign onto aim. For Vexille, I didn't. I dimmed the lights and watched it in my room alone.

It started good. It could have been a very good movie.

Unfortunately, that was about as far as it went for me with this film. All of the other details were trite and cliche, and too often the characters and the Type-A, military dialog are ripped right out of the typical action movie playbook. The umpteenth attempt at hardened, take-charge personalities that offer a glimmer of sensitivity is, at this point, dull characterization.

The anime was not terribly innovative, and the quality was only OK.  The story started off pretty well, with a dramatic opening and some interesting relationships developing, but loses its way among existential angst and the dread of losing ones identity in a post-industrial age.

I watched it in English.  I may have lost something that was communicated by the original.

I couldn't give the film five stars though and here's why. **Warning** this assessment is mostly for people who prefer plot over explosions and anime fantasy women in tight suits.  As is my experience with all anime, even Appleseed, the plot development and dialogue was a little odd and sometimes non-existant in many scenes which were a little jumbled, but the overall affect was not diminished. The titular character's background is lacking while a supporting character Maria seemed more important and more complex.  Another thing I disliked was a reminiscent Vexille throwing existentialist cheese at the very end to make a point about humanity and machinery.  Not that existentialism isn't important, it's just the point had been made already and the ending scene made me roll my eyes as it gave me an unnecessary and awkward synopsis on Maria and reiterated to me that machinery is bad and humanity is good.  Got it! Thanks for the info.  Moving on...the bad guy too was way too contrived, as usual, but after seeing him for the first time in the middle of the film we only get a snippet into his story in the memories of Maria near the end with little explanation.  I guess my need for a backstory on the guy ruins the effect his character is suppose to have on me.  Unfortunately, he is reduced to the typical mad scientist bent on world domination.  Sad, he could have been great.  My overall assessment is excellent, however.

3101080,4,B0012Z5UM0,"Vexille was one of those movies that captured my imagination from the moment I saw a Japanese trailer with English subtitles that showed up on YouTube. I'm not a huge Anime film but I love good science fiction, and especially stories that have to do with synthetic life (Blade Runner is my favorite movie of all time).

I watched this movie as a lower quality download, and was pretty impressed. Now on Blue Ray, I am even more impressed. The quality of the animation is probably the best I've ever seem and looks truly amazing on Blue Ray. The visuals are the real reason to buy this film. They are eye candy well worth watching even if the storyline itself could have been more engaging.

The score is also significantly good. With a diversity of tracks from unheard of bands, greats like Dead Can Dance, Asian pop bands, and even Paul Oakenfold (who apparently is doing a lot of film scores these days as his DJ career has dried up). ""Future Love Theme"" is simply awesome, and so is ""Host Of Seraphim."" The music is integrated with the visuals in a way that is only possible with an animated film where the director has control over every single visual element. There is a brilliant montage in the first third of the movie set to ""Close Your Eyes,"" that is one of the best I've ever seen since Donnie Darko's school montage set to ""Head Over Heals"" by Tears for Fears.

The plot line is a bit convoluted and ultimately doesn't deliver the same sort of pay off that the build up suggested it might. Sadly, there was a lot more potential to the story than what was delivered, and I found myself wishing that they had polished up the story a bit. However, the visuals and sound put make this a really solid movie.

3.5/5 Stars. Well worth buying if you are an Anime or science fiction fan.",1234310400,,1789,4.445121951219512

3101084,3,B0012Z5UM0,"There are some very nice CGI backgrounds and non-human visuals in this movie, but the human character designs seem to use lazy man's version of animating modern anime human faces, ie: use motion capture, then paint with pastel like colors over the actor.  Sure, it's lazy, but it also looks too fake, and really doesn't use any artistic imagination.  The story is run of the mill action, not overly interesting.",1225756800,,411,4.857142857142857

I'd put it in the same category as Appleseed or Ghost in the Shell (the latter having even more complicated plot lines).  i thought the animation was good but not great.  It was a little over the top, in my view, looking too animated.  I thought it lacked sublety, if that makes any sense.

Otherwise, I enjoyed the movie.  Probably should have waited for the special edition because I usually enjoy the features and this version didn't have any.",1225497600,,498,4.6022727272727275

I can't say I'm a fan of the motion capture or ""so real it's creepy"" animation. (Give me the good old stuff - I far prefer Harlock and Area 88, but that's a matter of taste). That said - recommended to fans of Ghost in the Shell and Appleseed.",1224720000,,624,4.426086956521739

In the end it's the rebels versus big business/government/evil guys with a mad dash to smash everything before civilization falls, etc. Even though that's a trite premise, it's still so well done that one doesn't mind. That action isn't meaningless and baffling is one clear reason why Vexille stands above so many other animes. Maybe the word is maturity. It's a see and re-see movie.

It's 2067 and Japan has become a nation completely cut off from the rest of the world because it refuses to adhere to a U.N. mandate banning the development and manufacturing of human-like androids.  The nation has also set up a sophisticated magnetic force field that effectively bars all outsiders from entering its borders.  S.W.O.R.D. is a secret U.S. special forces team sent in to find out  what diabolical activities are occurring on the inside.  The main character, Vexille, is a feisty female member of this special ops force.

""Vexille"" is a stylish and energetic dystopian fantasy, marked by imaginative storytelling, exciting action sequences, and animation that is a canny mixture of art deco, Soviet-era agitprop - with its heavy emphasis on facial shadowing - and technology-based futurism.  Nicely done.",1219449600,,827,5.267175572519084
3101090,3,B0012Z5UM0,"It doesn't come as a huge surprise that ""Vexille"" is from the people who brought the world ""Appleseed"" and its even better sequel ""Appleseed Ex Machina.""

And in ""Vexille,"" the cyberpunk flavor, the big mecha, and the futuristic world full of political and technological conflict are all firmly in place, along with some pretty slam-bang action sequences and a darker, grittier feeling. While it lacks some character development and feels rather bleak at times, it's still a pretty entertaining story -- now if only it had fleshed out the main cast a little more.

About seventy years in the future, the world is worried about the advancement of robotics technology. So the UN orders them restricted, and Japan decides to cut itself off from the rest of the world.

But ten years later, a biomechanical leg shows the UN just what has been going on in Japan. So the American tech police known as SWORD are sent into Japan to find out if the isolated country has been doing illegal robotics research, which no other country allows. They aren't, and the movie ends there. Seriously, the Daiwa Corporation has decided to guide mankind's evolution through machinery, and the the SWORD agents are met with a very warm, nasty welcome.

After being rescued by the rebel Maria, Vexille finds that the biorobotics Daiwa Corporation has reduced the once-proud Japan to a vast, barren slum devoid of truly human life. Even worse, a nanotech ""vaccine"" transforms the Japanese into mindless machines. Vexille's only hope of saving herself -- and her lover Leon -- is to join forces with a small band of rebels before Japan is completely destroyed by Daiwa.

""Vexille"" is a very different animal from the ""Appleseed"" movies. While it has the nimble shiny mecha and exploding buildings, the focus is on political machinations and evil corporations whose morality makes your hair stand on end. There's no utopia here for our tough heroine -- it's more like one of the outer circles of Dante's Hell.

The scenes in Vexille's home are colourful and streamlined, set in a futuristic city. But things get darker soon, taking us to the sickly yellow light and shabby shanty town of Japan, and things don't lighten up. And that devastated Japan is a pretty brilliant creation, both in its decayed misery and in the bleak future that its few remaining ""fragments of humanity"" have. The big flaw: the characters spend loooooong stretches of the movie just grimly talking to each other, with too little action.

Fortunately when there IS action, the fight scenes are top-notch in quality -- it has exploding buildings, missiles, battling mecha and chases through a marketplace. The fight scenes grow in intensity as Vexille and Maria reach the climactic confrontation with the Big Bad Guy. And the semi-apocalyptic finale is both shocking and inevitable -- as well as a helluva way to end a movie.

And then there's the jags, which are also quite cool -- giant wormlike masses of technology and metal that devour anything they come across. Not only are they wonderfully freaky, but they come across as a sort of cyber-sandworm from ""Dune."" Lovely.

And the animation is pretty astounding, though it has an oddly rotoscoped look in some action scenes. It's detailed and gloriously vivid, despite its grimy, shadowy look. And that includes exquisite details like snowflakes being individually swept from a windshield, or a reflection in a transparent helmet -- or even a smooth-skinned, nimble mecha exploding into a building with almost stunning speed. This glorious look almost makes up for the stretches of relatively action-free plot.

Perhaps its biggest weakness is in the characterization. It feels like they put a lot of effort into creating lifelike-looking characters. But despite the spunky Vexille and some touching moments from the Japanese cyborgs, the characters never quite come alive. Call it the ""Final Fantasy: Spirits Within"" effect. The best-rounded character is probably Maria, the tragic rebel leader who also provides a little romantic tension for our elf-faced heroine.

""Vexille"" is a flawed little semiprecious gem -- brilliant animation, a tough heroine and mildly horrific Japan. Flawed, but has plenty of chills and explosions.",1219449600,,4229,5.070503597122302
3101091,4,B0012Z5UM0,"Having watched ""Appleseed"", it was pretty much a no brainer that I would be giving ""VEXILLE"" a try.

The latest theatrical effort from SORI combining 3D and animation together that have made films such as the two ""Appleseed"" films has been quite exciting to watch and see develop overtime and just pretty much to see where animators are able to take things to a new level is always exciting.

As a viewer, I'm open to new technologies and to see technology and well-told storylines come together.

Of course, what makes things even more interesting is that SORI (Sori Fumuhiko) has evolved from his directorial debut with the live action theatrical hit ""Ping Pong"" back in 2001, produced the 2004 ""Appleseed"" film and here he is now as the director and screenwriter for the animated film ""VEXILLE"".

With ""VEXILLE"", the creators of the ""Appleseed"" film are back with a storyline that I have to say is quite thought provoking and animation that is quite mesmerizing to watch but this is a storyline that I wish was fleshed out in several movies than just one.

I have to admit that I really enjoyed the film.

I really enjoyed the awesome animation, I really enjoyed the storyline but I would love to find out from SORI if there were scenes cut or if he would loved to have made this film a two-parter or maybe a trilogy.

You get hooked on these characters such as Vexille, Leon, Maria and you just want more character development. Heck, even the main enemy scientist of Daiwa or even the corporation itself, you want to ask why did they do what they did. You are left with questions but of course, there is only so much you can cover in a film that is already at 105 minutes long.

So, for me, I wish the storyline would lead to another film but pretty much the way everything was written, everything is contained to one story, one movie and focusing on the overall situation in Japan ala 2077 than the characters.

With this exciting movie, you are just left wanting more and its a shame that the DVD doesn't have any special features. It's one thing for Hollywood companies to hold back and release so many multiple versions of a DVD but if there is one nitpicky thing I have about this DVD is that the Asian release gets the goodies, while those of us in the US will probably have to wait for a better release on Blu-ray.

But all in all, the DVD is definitely solid. I really love how animation and technology have come to play with the ""Appleseed"" films and even ""SOS: TOKYO METRO EXPLORERS: THE NEXT"" to ""FINAL FANTASY: ADVENT CHILDREN"".

It's good to see Japan taking chances on these type of films that utilize 3D and animation together and I know that it may not be the greatest thing for anime purists but for those who are able to accept technology and for creators to release something that is not just eye candy but having an engaging storyline is important.

""VEXILLE"" by no means is a perfect film but it's a very good film that features mind-blowing animation utilizing new technology.

As for the DVD, it's barebones but for now, it's what is currently out and definitely recommend people giving it a try!",1218153600,2,3123,4.545454545454546
3101092,5,B0012Z5UM0,"There is a lot of goodness to say about this movie and very little drawback. Let's start with the one thing that I didn't fully like then move on to the good stuff.

The soundtrack, done by Paul Oakenfold was really good - but a little to hardcore in some of the action/fight scenes. We had to keep turning the volume down during those parts then turn it back up for dialogue. This is just a personal preference - many of you will likely love the heavy feel to it.

Ok that's it for what I didn't completely like!

Animation - superb. There was however, a very interesting aspect to the animation. The details on the characters (the people) were scaled back when compared to the details on the environment/effects/buildings/etc. You could see rich wood grain on the walls of buildings, but the character's hair barely moved in a harsh wind. Skin features were missing, yet mechanical aspects to body armor were complete with detail. It was an interesting perspective that the environment was more detailed than the actual people. Even things such as lighting effects from a vehicle were amazing to watch.

Plot - also superb, and very impressive offering from Japan. Vexille is the main character of the movie - but you don't find out that it's actually the character's name until half-way into the movie. It starts out with a bang - Japan has cut off all uncontrolled contact with the outside world and has erected a very impressive barrier/shield around the entire island to prevent signals coming in or out - basically a total blackout of the island. A team of elite soldiers operating outside the auspices of the US and United Nations is tasked to infiltrate the island - the first ""visitors"" in 10 years - to determine if they are building a prohibited bio-mechanical technology. What's been going on in Japan for the last 10 years since the blackout? You'll have to watch the movie and see.

This is a full length feature with exciting action sequences, violence, a bit of romance, and an effective storyline that has made me want to watch more animated movies like this. Sci-fi is thick in the plot, so expect a lot of ""tech"".

We watched it with the English audio track and no subtitles, but you can watch it in native language with English subtitles if desired. There are a few special previews on the DVD, but they are mostly advertisements of other Japanese animations that are now available for purchase. Highly recommended for fans of action/adventure, sci-fi, and animation - even for those who don't necessarily choose animated movies, you'll forget that you're watching animation!",1217289600,2,2749,5.044052863436123

3101094,3,B0012Z5UM0,"VEXILLE is an odd film.  There's much to like, but there's a lot that's puzzling.  The film has several strong scenes, sequences and set pieces, yet never seems to string them together into a total coherent work.  It ends up as an enjoyable enough experience, although not one that will go down as a classic of the genre.

The movie is set in 2077 A.D.  Humanity is becoming more technologically dependent, but the United Nations has decided to outlaw the most advanced applications in the field of robotics.  Ten years before the film's opening, Japan has cut itself off from the rest of the world.  While some trading vessels still sail into Japanese waters, physical and electronic barriers prevent all outsiders from knowing what has taken place over the past ten years.

Enter Vexille and the rest of her team.  Vexille works for the United States Air Force and their mission is to infiltrate and disable the forced communications blackout.  Naturally, the changes within Japan have been dramatic, and the mission is far more dangerous and important than any of the planners have realized.

There is a lot to like about VEXILLE and I would like to be able to say that it's a great piece of work.  However, the whole never manages to completely hold together.  There are long stretches where the pacing slows to a crawl.  The genuinely impressive sequences tend to be followed by uninspired scenes which really hurt the flow of the movie.

For a perfect example of this feeling of frustration I felt, let me go over the entire fifteen minute pre-credit sequence.  During these scenes we see an action-packed fight sequence, showcasing the computer generated animated effects at their finest.  The pacing is great, the direction is exciting.  But there's one problem: we have no context in which to place this action.  We have no idea who the good guys are, who the bad guys are.  We don't know their motivations.  We don't know why they are fighting.  We don't know what the benefit would be to the winner or the peril that would be faced by the loser.  Everything looks great; it's just hard to care.

There are many plainly interesting science-fiction ideas in the film.  Looking back over the movie, there are a lot of great moments and concepts which -- unfortunately -- aren't given a fantastic movie in which to grow.  That is probably the most frustrating thing about VEXILLE.  One suspects that even something as simple as stronger and more aggressive editing could have resulted in a much more impressive and powerful movie.",1215993600,2,2537,4.799076212471132
3101105,3,B0012Z5UM0,"This is a decent ""japanimation"" type flick if you are into that sort of thing.  The story is entertaining and the voice acting is acceptable.  Graphically it is well done as most films of this type tend to be.  I find it a bit difficult to review as I personally don't often watch this type of movie.",1215820800,,300,4.228070175438597
3101106,3,B0012Z5UM0,"Yeah, the story's good (if confusing), and the sets are amazing.  But the animation has that sort of 'topo map' appearance like 'A Scanner Darkly' had - which to me is very off-putting and we spend more time discussing the animation techniques than paying attention to the movie.  There were too many obvious plot devices.

Although the latter half of the movie contained some amazing action sequences, I feel the overall time spent watching was pretty much a waste of time for me.  I felt no emotional involvement with any of the characters or with the mission behind SWORD - although the head of Daiwa was sufficiently insane to make me want to see him suffer.  Both my husband and I felt this was very derivative of The Matrix (man vs. machines, hopeless situation, etc.).  The 'jags' reminded us of the swarms of 'squiddies' and the people of Tokyo were just like the citizens of Zion.

A word about the DVD.  The soundtrack (also very Matrix-y) played continuously through the movie, even during dialogue.  But there was no adjustment made to the volume levels of the music, while the dialogue was going on.  We had the TV up to volume 40 (normally we hover around 25-30) and still had a hard time making out a lot of the dialogue because the voices were soft-spoken (at times) and the music was intrusive.",1215648000,,1311,4.636363636363637
3101107,4,B0012Z5UM0,"Vexille is an interesting showcase for CGI anime. The animation in parts was very impressive, however the storyline was disjointed and implausible.

3101108,3,B0012Z5UM0,"It's from the creators of Appleseed, and though Appleseed wasn't phenomenal, it was more entertaining than this effort. That's not to say that Vexille is a bad movie, but gosh are there quite a few things wrong with it.

For starters, the animation, while good in part, just isn't quite there yet. Some scenes looked fantastic, and others look plain unfinished in their presentation. Since Appleseed was a while ago now, I expected this style to be near perfected as it were, and this wasn't the case. Many times things took an all-too cel-shaded look, which clearly the movie wasn't try to present. That said, other parts looked wonderful, with snowflakes being brushed off a windshield near the beginning with no obvious repeating snowflake pattern as other animators are won't to do to save animation time. I mostly just wished the characters were a little more organic... ( for example the animators really weren't even trying during the one kiss in the movie...)

But there are worse problems than the animation: Even if you follow things very carefully from the get-go, confusion is bound to ensue for a good part of the start of the movie. The problem here stems in great part from a language barrier. If you watch this movie in the original Japanese track with subtitles (as you should!), the issue is that the Americans (our protagonists for this movie) for no apparent reason speak wonderful Japanese in a decidedly Japanese accent, because... well... the movie features an entirely Japanese voice cast. Now, if the antagonists of this movie are also Japanese..., well, you see the problem here. You're not entirely sure who's whom until things really get rolling.

The other issue is that the movie starts off at a decent pace, and then slows down to quite a crawl. A little more action would have really helped, especially since what action we do get is very-well done, Matrix-ish, over-the-top, slow-moed etc. Toward the end, though, things picked up nicely, though the ending narrative (I knew it was coming, too) is an utter cliche.

And lastly, the movie proudly displays Paul Okenfold as providing the original score for this movie. While in theory this is a great thing, it sounded like (pun intended) Paul wasn't sure what to do with this movie, as the soundtrack for the first 80% of the movie is absolutely awful. Some scenes that could have been wonderfully dramatic are shattered by techno poop. Yes, techno poop. It's a new genre, where you merge techno and poop and call it music. It's a real shame, too. But with that said, the climactic scene has some great, great beats that really serve to increase the mood. I was VERY into that final scene, let me tell you, and the music played a huge part in that.

So, overall, not a bad effort for a movie. Still feels a little same-old in terms of anime, but worth a view.

3101109,4,B0012Z5UM0,"During the opening 20 minutes, I had fears Vexille was a soulless action flick.  The graphics (it is computer generated, after all) look like what we might see at the end of the Playstation 3's lifecycle, or in the next generation of consoles, not as impressive as, say, Advent Children, yet they are extremely expressive, bringing us elements from hand-drawn animation.  The characterization is, at times, shallow, and the storyline trite and at firstly nonsensical, but by the end of the film, viewers will find themselves impressed by how everything has come together, given something moving to hold onto that was more memorable and interesting (at least to me) than the lauded action sequences, sort of an allegorical analysis of what it is to be human, in the standard Japanese mold of never giving up, and isn't that why we like a good story anyway, to learn more about ourselves?

Lovers of Japan might be especially affected.  I was.

3101110,4,B0012Z5UM0,"Not everyone is an anime fan, if they're basing their opinion on the first of this genre. But Vexville comes as a riveting surprise, first, for the amazing light-years progress of anime and CGI, and second, for the storyline that is quite incredible for this artform.

Set in the future, Japan has isolated itself against a world that seeks to stop the integration of robotics with human beings. Japan (in the story) is a world leader in the development of these robot applications, but everyone else on the planet fears it and makes it illegal. An American military elite group secretly invades to investigate their doings, and the action-packed story takes off from there.

The plot is surprisingly sophisticated for this genre - easily as good as a lot of ""real people"" sci-fi you can find in the movies. You'll pinch yourself with some of the breathtaking scenes in this; it's almost unbelievable that these are animations and not human beings! (Think ""The Matrix"" for stop of the slow-motion ""up in the air"" sequences.)

There are several scenes that unfortunately are reminiscent of the early days of anime, and for that (and a few minor plot holes), this movie is a four-star (and a half) effort.

As a sci-fi lover who long ago passed on anime, this is one movie I highly recommend. It literally adds an entirely new dimension to the viewing experience!",1213833600,3,1361,4.803418803418803

The program they used looked a lot like a souped up version of roto-scope.  The story was interesting, Japan being a leader of robotic engineering sealing it's self from the rest of the world for a decade.  A crack squad of commandos enter the country to see how advanced their science in robotics and  mecha has become over that span of time.  Their answers are quite surprising and very shocking.  The animation looked real good but it's not the same old anime to me.  All that CGI was too much for my tastes.

The movie is presented in 16.9 widescreen and it has two soundtracks (English and Japanese) and two sets of sub-titles (Japanese and English).  As usual, the Japanese dialog is much better and tells a complete story with out being dumbed down and filled with hackneyed and cliched dialog.  The DVD has so extras except for some previews of other Funimation shows.

Fair, for die hard anime fans only.",1213747200,,1026,4.582417582417582
3101112,5,B0012Z5UM0,"I must admit that initial reason for picking this movie was the soundtrack by Paul Oakenfold but I ended up loving the movie. Overall visually it was stunning, nothing less than you would expect from the high tech Japanese animation and the story was very interesting. I won't dissect what the main story was; in a nutshell America gets involved with Japan after ten years of seclusion and secret bio engineering projects are starting to threaten man kind. Humans and robots start to mix forming an eerie combination that has no good ending in sight for anyone. It's up to SWORD members to break into the tightly secured country but even the best plans have meager chances of success as robots try to keep everyone out. The secret that is brewing was chilling and I found the story to be fascinating, I was totally absorbed even thought the movie was long and thrilled that I can add it to my collection.

Look wise everything was seamless and smooth, the fights, the action and some nice surprises looked like little gems crafted on a computer screen by some genius. The music was awesome too, I just wish there was more of it. I loved everything about Vexille and can't wait to watch it again.",1213747200,,1195,4.610328638497653
3101113,4,B0012Z5UM0,"If you're interested in Vexille, there's a pretty good chance you've seen the Appleseed movies.  Unsurprisingly, Vexille share most of their strengths and weakenesses:

Visuals: During action scenes, Vexille looks amazing.  Also, the animation studio's quest to create believable motion capture progresses further than before.  Unfortunately, there are scenes where characters seemed disconnected from seemingly static backgrounds.  Both Appleseed movies looked better in this regard.  And like the Appleseed movies, Vexille begins with the most impressive action scene and culminates in a scene that never quite recaptures the first scene's promise.

Music: Much improved over Appleseed: Ex Machina.  Oakenfold and his house/techno brethren are back in full force here- I could see listening to this soundtrack just like I listen to the soundtrack of the first Appleseed.

Story: Again, an improvement over Ex Machina- Though Vexille doesn't have any previous backstory to build upon, it serves up an interesting and often surprising self-contained story.  Most of the characters don't receive any development, but the sci-fi story on offer here will please those that enjoyed what the first Appleseed had to offer.

Though hampered by some unimpressive/nonexistant action towards the second half, Vexille is an otherwise impressive popcorn ride. Recommended.",1213747200,2,1360,5.78391959798995

A special ops force goes to infiltrate Japan and find the androids they've been reported to be making.

Vexille is a woman, who is a member of SWORD, the US special ops team who will be going in, along with her lover Leon and others...

3101125,3,B0012Z5UM0,"This is actually a pretty good movie (as recent Anime movies go) and I certainly enjoyed it more than Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within, on which there are several comparative parallels.
The animation and CGI are quite simply amazing, and whereas this may be enough to hold the attention of the intended target audience demographic, the plot was thin at best and meandered more than I would like.
The synopsis is fairly straight forward (and not disimilar from other movies of the genre) where a female agent ""Vexville"" of the title is an sent to Tokyo to investigate illegal robot development banned by the UN of the day, needless to say this is set in a futuristic world.
There are some good action moments and the slant is more toward the horror style of Anime flicks in a ""World going bad"" scenario not unlike the recent live action Resident Evil series of movies.
Another annoyance was the soundtrack. Despite the pedigree of Paul Oakenfold, it seems to have been added as an afterthought to the editing, and throughout most of the picture (as good as it is) doesn't seem to fit well with what's on screen.
I rated it at 3 stars which me seem unduly harsh as it is entertaining in itself and certainly a polished production. It was also nice to see an Anime movie where one doesn't require a ton of information and backstory (or the need to see three prequels) to understand what's going on. I just wanted more depth to the characters and story, something that seems to be missing in most movies like this.",1213747200,,1512,4.583025830258302
3101126,5,B0012Z5UM0,"This movie grabs your attention from the start. You can read the other reviews to get an idea of the plot line, which I thought was a pretty interesting and not-too-far fetched premise for the future. I'll focus on the production aspects.

The animation was impressive. Very detailed, very lifelike, although it is pretty much impossible to make people look exactly right but they did a good job. Only one minor quibble, the characters seem to move their limbs and facial features rather slowly, like when they blink or walk, etc. But overall I thought the animation was first-rate.  Another reviewer mentioned the closing of an enormous black gate and that same scene impressed me also, just because of the gorgeous attention to detail.

The sound is excellent.  I watched it on my computer, in stereo through M-Audio speakers (also purchased via Amazon) and was pleasantly surprised at how detailed and clear the soundtrack was, as well as what excellent stereo separation it had.

Some have commented on the dialog being cheesy but I didn't think so. I watched it in the original Japanese language with subtitles.  If you watch any Japanese, or any foreign movie for that matter, that has been dubbed in English, it will sound cheesy no matter what.  You have to watch in the original language to do a film justice.

Plot-wise: read the other reviews and see if it is for you.  Personally, I liked it.  I thought this was a very well done movie and I have no qualms recommending it.  It's put together very well - a first class effort.",1213660800,,1538,4.722846441947565
3101127,5,B0012Z5UM0,"I put on Vexille intending just to check out the video quality and then watch it at a later time. That didn't work out. I was immediately hooked and ended up watching the entire thing! I loved it. I don't think there is any need to compare it to a list of other anime or to anime at all for that matter. It's a great movie. It has a great science fiction plot that held my attention completely. I found myself being impressed with the ""stunts"" in the movie even though I knew it was computer generated.

- Really cool animation
- Awesome Sound
- A good plot with twists and turns
- Cool technology - Robots and Soldiers in Mechanical Fighting Suits
- Likable characters with depth

I will be recommending this movie and loaning out my copy to friends. Hopefully Vexille and I can break down some of the anime fears that are out there.",1213660800,2,834,4.305732484076433
3101128,5,B0012Z5UM0,"Where did this movie come from? I rented it with reserved anticipation because it looked like another generic anime action movie. I had no idea I was about to witness the greatest animated cinematic experience of my entire life.

Over the past few years I've grown fond of Japanese anime action films. My favorites are ""Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children"", ""Appleseed"", ""Karas: The Prophecy and Revelation"", and ""Ghost In the Shell."" Yeah, I also like a lot of the artsy stuff like ""5 Centimeters Per Second"", ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"", and the most of the Studio Ghibli portfolio, but nothing wets my palette like a great anime action movie. And my goodness did ""Vexille"" wet my palette!

In the year 2077, an elite commando unit infiltrates Japan to expose their technological secrets to the world. Character development is weak, but the storyline is excellent, with plenty of engaging scenarios, unexpected surprises, and formidable antagonists. The visuals are outstanding and the score is unorthodox and refreshing. The action scenes are also stunning. Whether it's a mansion infiltration, a high speed motorcycle pursuit, or an escape from enigmatic machina, the choreography, editing, and placement of the virtual camera are all top notch. One 11-minute scene is unquestionably the most nerve-racking and utterly spectacular action/suspense sequence in the history of animated cinema. Nothing comes close to this in the world of anime action. Nothing.

Now, anyone who reads my other comments knows that there are two things that I really hate: Hollywood movies and art-house snobs. Of course, I'm sure that those stuck-up snobs will [...] all over this movie due to the relative lack of character development, but ""Vexille"" thrives so much on the action and storyline that the characters earn our concern because of how they are absorbed within this exceptionally crafted conflict. This is NOT a brainless action movie. The aforementioned 11-minute extravaganza does not exist for eye candy and superficial beauty alone (like most of the scenes in ""FFVII: Advent Children""). It has a significant emotional weight behind it which makes the viewer clench their seat in apprehension for every single second of the entire sequence. I know, I know; the snobs would rather watch a couple kids walk around in a war zone collecting rice for two hours instead of an entertaining action movie. So maybe they should just spare us the ""high and mighty"" routine and not even bother watching this movie to begin with. (God knows they should've skipped ""The Machine Girl."")

One enigmatic complaint I've heard on the web is with regards to the dialogue. Some have claimed it to be ""cheesy"", but I honestly cannot recall more than one or two sentences that apply. (Believe me, I know cheese when I see it.) Most of the dialogue is rather intelligent and there is a noticeable lack of melodrama. Seriously, there are virtually NO eye-rolling moments in this movie, which is a huge positive.

I honestly cannot express in words how awesome ""Vexille"" is. It's almost like I'm in a state of shock or something, because I just can't get this movie out of my head for a split second. Things might change over the course of weeks and subsequent viewings (of which there will be many, I promise you that), but as of this very moment, this film may have just cracked my Top 20 All Time list (live action included).

Just watch it and judge for yourself. And why on earth are theaters showing some stupid kung fu panda tripe instead of this spectacular action film?",1213574400,2,3555,4.966386554621849
3101129,5,B0012Z5UM0,"Went into Vexille on the heels of the disappointing Appleseed Ex Machina and was BLOWN AWAY. Everything about this is top notch; the storyline, while involved, is still easy to follow and very engaging. You care about characters when they die, even the ones with limited screen time. For a standard (read: non HD) disc, the image is fantastic, though I watched it on a PS3 so the upconverting may have helped. The surround sound mix is totally immersive and goes a long way to bring you into the story. The action sequences, while somewhat derivative, are brilliant and very well staged and executed. All of this is served spectacularly well by the music, which is a combination of Oakenfold's signature breakbeat techno and selected songs by other artists, and is never off putting or out of place. Also, the anime style, a blend of cell shaded 2D and CGI, is reminiscent of Appleseed, only a bit more fluid and stylized. The Japanese audio track is solid as to be expected, and to my surprise the English dub is actually very well done. Bonus points for that.

All told, Vexille is a must buy for cyberpunk, sci fi and anime afficionados, and is definitely reference material for your home theatre system.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1213574400,2,1228,4.76056338028169
3101130,4,B0012Z5UM0,"I enjoyed watching Appleseed so I was excited for this sendup and I was not disappointed.  The movie opens up in the future where cars sound electric and people get their work done on hovering keyboards (that looked cool).  Robots are huge in the future, but biometrics is one area that has been outlawed internationally by everybody except Japan.  Japan instead sets up a cloud of secrecy but still keeps a high volume of robotic trade with the world.  Except that one of Japan's most valuable resources are running out and they need a fresh supply -- starting in America.

I was actually quite glued to the screen the entire time.  The storyline was easy to follow and, tho borrowed from many other story lines, still had a lot of originality and good character development.  You can tell when the characters are good when you actually care for their outcome.  And in this movie, despite the high death toll throughout, you are moved when any of the major characters die (don't worry, they don't all die, but quite a few don't make it through).

There was one loose end that doesn't seem to get resolved in the end.  I don't know if it was a dropped plot line or if they had a sequel in mind.  It was pretty big so I suspect that a Vexille II will be following this movie soon enough.

If you are into Sci-Fi I recommend picking this up.  It isn't the best thing out there, but it was worth checking out.",1213574400,2,1406,4.424124513618677
3101131,5,B0012Z5UM0,"Both APPLESEED and APPLESEED EX MACHINA are my favorite anime films in recent months. When I found out that the creators of APPLESEED is behind the film VEXILLE, I knew I had to check out VEXILLE. Needless to say the creators of APPLESEED really outdid themselves with VEXILLE.

VEXILLE is named after the heroine of the story. She is a member of a special ops force called S.W.O.R.D. The story takes place in 2077. It has been ten years since Japan had isolated itself from the rest of the world based on an international treaty that limits the use of robotic technology. During a mission, it is revealed that Japan had been developing androids thus leads to a new mission to if this really is the case. Vexille's lover Leon volunteers to lead a team to infiltrate Japan. When Vexille finds out, she manages to get involved in the mission. Of course, the plan quickly goes awry. Leon and his team goes missing, and Vexille ends up in the company of a mysterious woman named Maria and her group of ragtag rebels who wants to put a stop to the corporation responsible for the creation of androids and abuse of bio-technology.

The animation was nothing short of amazing. The animation was quite similiar to the APPLESEED films which is a mix of hand drawn art (or what it looks like)and computer generated images. I found the film to be fast paced and never boring. Paul Oakenfold's techno film score was quite good and really fit the theme of the film. I can hardly wait to see what the folks behind APPLESEED and VEXILLE does next. They made me a huge fan out of me.",1213401600,,1567,4.514084507042254

I think this is a tie or a close second with my other favorite recent anime,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paprika/dp/B000VWYJ68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paprika</a>.  While Paprika could also be considered science fiction, it is perhaps a less traditional anime story than Vexille.  Vexille deals with the concepts of technology and how robotics and biological evolution may collide in the future.  The story is told simply and the feature is amazingly animated and imaginative.

All I had to hear in order to want this were the two phrases from the box:
1) ""From the Creators of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Appleseed/dp/B00005AX6N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Appleseed</a>""(which is an amazing anime, and one of my favorite series, particularly the later ones)
2) Original Score by Paul Oakenfold

Now in terms of the animation, this looks very similar to newer Appleseed, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Appleseed-Ex-Machina-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0010358D0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Appleseed Ex Machina (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>.  There is the familiar layering of characters, scenery, images and dynamic elements such as weather and debris.  The CG is also masterfully done.  The result is a very surreal looking anime that is amazing to watch in regular definition.  I can only imagine what a high definition cut would look like.

In terms of the score, I don't think I got a good feel for the music after watching this once.  If the score is sold as a separate disk I will probably buy it since I'm an Oakenfold fan.  Still, what I did hear of the music was good.  I'm just not sure all of the tracks made it to the final cut in their intirety.

The story is based upon a variation of a familiar theme, namely that robotics and android technology poses risks for the future.  But there was also some surprising elements, such as a hefty dose of distrust of the Japanese government and a future where Japan is isolated from the world.

I will avoid spoilers (though be warned most others probably won't) because discovering the details of the story is a lot of the pleasure.  Suffice it to say this is kind of an anime blend of Blade Runner, The Matrix, I-Robot and The Andromeda Strain. It's not only eye-catching science fiction, because there is a strong mix of philosophical themes beneath the surface.

Conclusion

If you like science fiction, anime and imaginative cinema, you must see this movie.  You will love it!

3101134,4,B0012Z5UM0,"I used to think anime was just another word for cartoon. With films such as Vexille I have now come to realize, anime is an art form in its own right.
Vexille is a female agent with S.W.O.R.D., a unit of U.S. Navy specialists.
Set in the not-too-distant future, Japan has completely isolated itself from the rest of the world. The U.N. had banned Japan's newest technology advances in human enhancement, in fear of the creation of cyborgs, who would no longer be ""human"". When a body part of an executive of the Daiwa corporation is captured, it becomes apparent that the U.N.'s fear of cybernetic human enhancement is now a reality. S.W.O.R.D. sends a small, covert group of operatives into Japan in order to transmit a signal their computers can decode in order to break down the ""barrier"" Japan has set up around itself. The S.W.O.R.D. team is ambushed before they can complete sending the signal and Vexille is rendered unconscious. When she awakens a couple of days later, she finds herself a ""guest"" of the leader of Japan's resistance movement. Vexille vows to help the resistance take down Daiwa before Daiwa can take over the world.
Vexille is a beautiful film. The graphics are simply stunning. The attention to detail is astounding. Water effects, fire & explosion effects, detailed backgrounds and machinery are all amazing. This is one high quality animation. If there were no ""people"" shown in the film, you might not realize these are actually drawings.
The film features plenty of action and high-tech gadgetry to keep your interest. The story-line is a bit weak and predictable. Still, overall, Vexille is one film that anime enthusiasts will want to watch. It can also make an enthusiast out of a casual anime viewer.",1213228800,2,1735,4.864864864864865
3101145,4,B0012Z5UM0,"I am not one who typically watches Anime movies, but I thought that Vexille sounded like it had a very interesting story.  I also don't typically like the drawing style used in Anime, but the stills on the product page hinted that Vexille would not be garden variety in this regard either.  When the DVD arrived, I found that I had made a good decision in trying something new.  Here's what I thought.

PLOT:  The story is set in 2077 where Japan has adopted a policy of technology enabled complete isolation.  Ten years prior Japan left the UN due to sanctions related to their research and development with androids conducted by the electronics giant, Daiwa.  After Daiwa's enforcer, Saito, leads an assassination of world leaders on US soil, the elite military unit S.W.O.R.D  makes an attempt to capture Saito before he and his team escape.  When that fails, S.W.O.R.D. is sent on an unofficial mission to invade Japan in order to shed some light on the state of Japan's android development.  The mission doesn't go as planned, and the majority of the movie is spent resolving the conflict that ensues.

After the failed mission Vexille, one member of the S.W.O.R.D. Team, encounters a group that is resistant to Daiwa and the Japanese government.  Maria is the leader of this group of rebels who do not support the direction that Daiwa and the government are taking the country.  The question of bioethics drives the plot to its climax and ultimate resolution.

The story moves rather quickly, and I found that I picked up on more details and saw how things fit together better with a second viewing.  The good news was that I found it compelling enough that a second viewing was even more enjoyable than the first.

INFLUENCES:  While I can't make an intelligent comparison to other Anime movies, it did seem to me that there are elements drawn from American Sci-Fi, Fantasy, and Adventure.  The climactic sequence lifts heavily from closing battle at the Death Star in Star Wars Episode IV.  While it is not an exact replica, the similarities are striking.

There is also a scene prior to this where Maria, the leader of the Japanese resistance group, gives a speech that hearkens to that of William Wallace in Brave Heart.

Finally there is a scene involving the closing of a massive gate that took me back to the scene at the Black Gate of Mordor in Return of the King.

CHARACTERS:  There were three compelling characters to me in the movie:  Vexille, Maria, and Saito.  Vexille begins the story with a very strong anti-robot sentiment; however, we see her perspective change based on how the story develops.  She is a strong, fiery character that is easy to root for.  Maria is the calm, cool leader with a slight Han Solo personality.  However she is rational to an extreme and willing to make and take action based on difficult decisions.  Saito is the Darth Vader figure for Daiwa.  Ruthless and self confident, he makes a formidable focal point for the antagonist of the story, Daiwa.

RATING:  Vexille has a PG-13 label, and I think this is a fair rating.  The explicit language is about on par with this year's theatrical release of Speed Racer.  The plot is one that is probably too deep and serious for younger children as well.  However the story provides fairly rich ground for ethical discussions with kids in the middle and high school age range.

CONCLUSION:  There is a lot to like about Vexille.  It has a good story and characters that are strong enough to make multiple viewings enjoyable.  If you like Sci-Fi/Fantasy animation, your odds are good on enjoying Vexille.",1213228800,2,3596,4.747980613893376
3101146,2,B0012Z5UM0,"The first thing to note about this film is that the graphics are (for the most part) pretty incredible and lifelike -- so much so that occasionally I forgot I was watching an animated film.  That does credit to the animators, but can detract a bit from the experience because judged as a live action film Vexille is pretty hokey and melodramatic.  In my experience I can be a lot more forgiving about odd or stilted characters in an animated film because they feel more like a dream that should be considered on its own merits and not compared to other things.  When this film started to feel closer to but not quite like a live action film I couldn't help but compare it to the artificiality and stilted acting that comes up in a lot of ambitious but unsuccessful CGI films.  To their credit, the filmmakers chose to render the characters in a way that wasn't totally lifelike (and avoided the strangeness of a film like Final Fantasy, or, worse, The Polar Express), and that took a little of the edge off, reminding me that the film should be assessed as an anime.

As far as the story goes, there are some intriguing new elements mixed in with ideas from Ghost in the Machine and Appleseed.  According to the story Japan closed its borders due to increasing pressure from other countries to stop developing its android program.  Ten years later they've reached a point where their androids are indistinguishable from humans and are beginning to replace world leaders with their own creations.  A covert US group called SWORD works their way into Japan's borders in order to discover what they are up to -- and it turns out that things have proceeded much further than anyone expected.  One of my favorite elements of the film were the metallic wormlike giants that inhabited the wastelands -- their structure was obviously an homage to the worms in Dune but they were distinctive enough and impressive enough on screen that they felt original.  It is not entirely clear why the filmmakers chose to make this story ultimately one about Vexille, the main character.  I guess you have to have a main character, and it may as well be a tough woman with a soft spot for the lover she fears she is going to lose, but the fact that the film is named after her suggests it is about some profound life discovery that is personal to her.  It really isn't.  The film is mostly about a couple of US military types and some rebellious Japanese trying to stop an insane robotics expert from taking over the world.  The subplot, about Vexille's confused emotions and concern about her lover, who seems to harbor dark secrets or regrets from the past, doesn't really come across very clearly and tends to detract from the primary story when it surfaces.  This film won't be an enduring classic like Akira or Ghost in the Shell or Paprika, but overall I found this to be an enjoyable flick, and one to watch if you are interested in computer animation or like robot or cyberpunk style stories and fun science fiction.",1213142400,3,3003,4.607879924953096
3101147,3,B0012Z5UM0,"""Vexille"" is both the name of the movie and the title character, a woman in SWORD, an elite American naval taskforce who spend most of their time in robotic combat suits on land.  This is the second movie for director Femihiko Sori and he tries to bring in character development primarily via flashbacks which are also used to fill in plot information for the audience.  Vexille's commanding officer, and perhaps her lover as well, is Leon, whose ex, Maria, now leads a resistance force in Japan.  What is there to resist in Japan?  In 2067 the nature, controlled by business giant Daiwa, supposedly isolates itself from the rest of the world over android development.  However, Japan is not really isolated so much as hyper secretive because it is trading it's robots world wide.  By 2077 Japan decides to make a move on the rest of the world and only a secret mission from SWORD can figure it all out.  As I watched this I was impressed with the computer animation though the perfection of the human figures still creeps me out a bit.  However the emotional ties between the characters, especially Vexille and almost anyone else felt forced.  Just because she's female doesn't mean she'll latch on so strongly to anyone; she should have military training to be more professional after all.  The nightmarish world of Japan was well done though it seemed odd that resistance would survive for a decade given what was happening to everyone.  ""Vexille"" isn't a bad movie but it certainly isn't the best movie out of Japan I've seen.",1213142400,,1530,4.757575757575758
3101148,4,B0012Z5UM0,"Before the movie begins you can click on audio setup and choose 5.1 surround in Japanese, or English. Fearing technological superiority and even dangerous entry into robotics, outside forces try to suppress Japan's progress. Japan responds by withdrawing into its own inner shell, where it can develop advanced technologies including android level robotics.
The movie itself is presented using advanced Star Wars like cinematic technologies. I'm not usually into anime, but this is of such a good quality, that movements of the ""actors"" are life like. The sound track and ""cinematography"" are excellent. The anime trade off is that you are losing the real visual actors, but that gives the writers and production designers a license to create scenes that would either be cost prohibitive, or nearly impossible at times, using conventional acting.
Daiwa robotics, the largest corporation in Japan, the creator of the antennae shield, blocking all communications, and radar signals, in and out of Japan, must be penetrated. That is the mission the US envoy is commissioned to achieve. Utilizing the shipping channel, the only port of access in and out of the country is closely monitored and scanned using laser detection. To say they successfully made it through would be an overstatement. The rest of the movie I would have to categorize, suspense, intertwined as an action movie.
All in all I would have to rate this as a good movie. An anime flick packed full of real emotions that is how well this movie is made. I still prefer real  actors, though this is about as close as I can imagine to the real thing.",1213056000,,1610,4.985130111524164

From the creators of Appleseed with an original score by Paul Oakenfold.

2067: Isolation
Japan seals herself off from the eyes of the world in the face of unilateral international policy setting strict limits on the use of robotic technology. The island nation exists only behind the veil of seclusion. No sour shall enter. No soul shall leave.

2077: Revelation
The veil is breached. Japan is infiltrated by agents of the organization S.W.O.R.D., a fighting force operating outside of the protection of the United States and her allies. Their mission: Determine if the Japanese are developing banned robotic bio-technology, forbidden due to its threat to humankind.

MY TAKE ON IT:
- beautiful graphics
- high action
- not overly violent, such as brain pieces splattering in slow-mo, like some anime. I'd rate it PG for the level of violence it did have
- some parts, like the ""Dune"" worms, definitely required a suspension of disbelief
-  when the protagonist find out what Japan's big secret is, I didn't see it coming and found it a nice plot twist
- a bit frustrating that some characters with ""high-tech gear"" sacrifice themselves for nothing against ""low-tech"" bad guys, when all they had to do was use their weapons and armor more effectively. Guess the director wanted them to die for whatever plot device it brought even if it made little sense

OVERALL:
I haven't watched anime in a while but was thoroughly impressed with this new addition to the scene. It was a fun watch and had nice eye-candy in the process. Everyone I've shared it with at work -- from the hardcore anime fan to the casual fan -- have loved it.

It's worth checking out!",1213056000,2,1667,4.811188811188811

Compared to Appleseed, this movie is Slooooooow!

Good concept, but a snails pace delivery. The payoff at the end wasn't worth the $20 I spent. Even the Final Fantasy movies are much better than this.

What a shame they put such money and talented time in these endeavors, but don't come out with a sci-fi blockbuster.

After purchasing and watching tons of these japanese animae movies,with all their obvious love of robotics and action, I just can't understand how no one has created a Warhammer fully CGI movie. The games and books are obviously huge and popular, but no film feature...?

========
I liked where they were trying to go with this one. It is an entertaining experience, but man the plot and the dune worm ripoffs were just awful.

Graphics
========
Graphically this is one of the most impressive things I have seen in computer animation. I can definitely see the Appleseed influence in many of the characters and within the technologies. Everything animates very well with very few instances of ""uncanny valley"".

Sound/Music
===========
Its there. None of it is really memorable, but its servicable. There have definitely been worse soundtracks.

Story
===========
The story keeps moving and never really slows down but the writers choose to steal from some movies in such a way as to be completely cheap and diminishing of their own experience and its unfortunate because they had built an interesting 'universe' full of curiosities that you actually want to examine.",1211414400,,902,5.122448979591836
3101154,4,B0012Z5UM0,"As a fan of Asian cinema, I've often wondered why I haven't reviewed more Japanese anime. Traditional anime has very complex storylines that can put most movies to shame. ""VEXILLE"" (a.k.a. Vexille 2077 Nihon Sakaku, Isolation) is from the same folks responsible for Appleseed and Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C.. Director Fumihiko Sori and writer Haruka Handa's latest is a blend of traditional 2 dimensional animation and 3-D effects that gives us a vision of a futuristic world. People who saw Appleseed may notice the similarities to Masamune Shirow's futuristic designs since they both worked on the 2004 hit animated film.

The story in ""Vexille"" begins as Daiwa Industries leads Japan in technological advancements as an attempt for Imperial Aspirations (recalls Japan in WWII). Daiwa began experimenting in extreme cloning, bio-engineering human tissue to combine with machine parts. Enraged with these experiments, the U.N. orders Japan to cease all activities. In retaliation, Japan sanctions a rule of total isolation from the rest of the world, and the country even goes as far as generating a magnetic force field around its borders.
After 10 years, American intelligence intercepts information that Japan has developed a procedure that can turn humans into cyborgs. A black ops group called ""S.W.O.R.D."" is sent to infiltrate isolated Japan to find the truth of this matter and stop it if necessary. Vexille, one of the commando units sent to Japan soon finds herself the lone survivor who may be able to stop Daiwa with its sinister plans. She hooks up with Maria and her gang of renegades to infiltrate Daiwa. But is Maria more than what she seems? The shocking secret may be more than they bargained for....

I've read that ""Vexille"" wasn't such a huge hit when it came out in Japan. Perhaps, anime fans experienced some ""cyberpunk"" overload because there are quite a lot of features that show a futuristic world with ""mechas"" involved; or maybe because the plot in ""Vexille"" portrays the country as a ""rogue"" government in the world's eyes. I wouldn't know the true reason. But this original work by Sori and Handa seemed too similar to Shirow's past works. It incorporates familiar themes of the usual corporate entity that wants to play God, a strong-willed, gutsy but beautiful heroine, futuristic military weaponry and the premise of man vs. machine or the morality of man and machine. The film may actually be homage to Masamune Shirow.

The animation in ""Vexille"" is kind of a mixed bag. I loved the fact that the characters don't have the usual over-expressive ""bulging"" eyes, odd colored hair and perfect complexion. Vexille and Maria (as well the entire supporting cast) looked almost realistic in their features, it sidestepped the usual anime conventions that we're used to in the past. Their movements are also very fluid and smooth that outshines the motion capture in ""Beowulf"" but comes a lot short of the quality of the fantastic animation in ""Final Fantasy: Advent Children"".  I also found it a bit amusing that Americans looked like they're mixed and still looked a tad Asian. (Not complaining, just stating an observation) Also, I saw this film in its original Japanese language; voice actors Yasuko Matsuyuri as sexy rebel, Maria (This character makes me want to become a cartoon) and Meisa Kuroki as Vexille do a very decent job in expressing emotions.

The film totally looks enchanting with the execution of CGI and traditional cell animation. The effects work by Oxybot is perfect for this type of movie.  ""Vexille"" seems to borrow elements from Ghost in the Shell, Blade Runner and even Dune. (You'll be impressed once you see the ""Jags"") The one fault that the film has, that somewhat lost its effectiveness is the lack of dramatic impact. The story is deep enough to keep experienced viewers interested but the execution seemed a bit lackluster. It opted to settle for the usual histrionics and missed a fantastic opportunity for emotional content by exploring the dramatic repercussions of the film's main premise. Graphics can only carry an animated feature so far.

Overall, I did enjoy ""Vexille"" more than I did ""Appleseed Ex Machina"". I guess I'm so used to Anime with all the dramatic elements explored that I was somewhat disappointed. The film had all the dynamic potential with its deep premise that wasn't fully realized.

3335518,5,B0012Z5UM0,"After reading a short synopsis and the Japanese version trailer of this movie (when looking for something to go see one evening), I figured I'd check it out.  I'm not a huge fan of a lot of Japanese anime, though some of it is cool, and I'm not normally a big fan of animated drama/action in general, but WOW was Vexille a pleasant surprise!  If I had to compare it to something, I would say it's Final Fantasy meets Titan A.E. and maybe a little bit of the Matrix.

The animation style was just beautiful!  The mix of cartoon with computer-generated animation was a brilliant sight to behold.  The scenes in this movie had fantastic dimension, color, style, and a totally mesmerizing quality.  It definitely made it very easy to find myself drawn into this futuristic world.

The story is great too!  Good character development and a sci-fi element that is at least partially believable (and certainly, if nothing else, entertaining).  Set in the year 2077, the technology is slick, clever, and cool - yet not so far fetched that you can't imagine the possibilities suggested.  Unplug and buy into the fantasy and you'll have a great time.  The movie has a bit of a Matrix quality in that (aside from its obvious political elements) there is the strong sense of an underlying (almost spiritual) theme driving the story but it's just far enough removed from the surface story that you can dig for messages if you want to or just enjoy the ride without getting into the philosophy of the film.  I like movies that have multi-faceted elements like this.  It made me want to see it again to try and draw more out of it.

In short, the movie is great!  It's more of a drama than out and out action (so it might strike some viewers as a little slow-paced in places), but the action is fun and the story is good.  The characters are such that you care about them and that draws you even further into the story.  There is also some cool music in the film, well placed with the various scenes and unique enough so that it doesn't strike as typical.  My favorite songs are ""Target Practice"" by Asian Dub Foundation, ""Bird Flu"" by M.I.A. and ""The Virus"" by Paul Oakenfold.  Again, the artwork and C.G. effects are beautiful and really fun to watch.

I loved the movie and would see it again (and will) because I'm ordering it today!  Parents who are curious about the content will be happy to know that there are no sexual themes in this film.  There is a light sub context of a love story present, but it's not the main focus of the film.  There is sci-fi action and violence but nothing bloody or grotesque.  There is a little bit of language, thus earning it its PG-13 rating.

If you like anime or just good sci-fi, both elements should please.  I recommend it.",1203638400,30,2755,4.492957746478873
3335519,3,B0012Z5UM0,"The idea is that we're losing our humanity to the Epcot world of techno dependence in which we find ourselves ensconced.  A lot of sound and fury, fueled by a high-powered techno-ambient soundtrack, with a ton of computer graphics wrapped into the slick animation package.  The scale of the theme is grand, with the life like animation (many the oriental characters, however, have blue eyes such as Vexille - the heroine) - occassionally drifting into the profiles of live actors (such as in 300), providing the perfect nexus for comtemplating the ever thinning demarcation between natural and artificial intelligence.  The film also ruminates on the current state of corporate anarchy and the ends to which that might lead. The script, however, is derivative to such a degree (almost as if the filmakers took the entire catalog of the films they saw in film school and dumped bits and pieces of them into this one) as to be laughable.  In fact, members of the audience at The Santa Barbara Film Festival were laughing. Anime meets the Teminator films, meets the Batman films, meets Apollo 13, meets films of The Fast and the Furious genre, meets Dune, meets The Man Who Would Be King, meets 12 Monkies, meets Bowfinger???, and so forth.  Animators seem to feel they have license to lift scenes from any non-aminated film with impunity, and therein lies the rub. Thus, the intended philosophical seriousness does not quite come across.  But, as the audience to which this onslaught of techno-glitzy violence is directed is for the most part too young to have seen the films from which at lest 80% of the script and set concepts are derived, the point is moot.  For this audience: you ought to be thinking about your robotic tendencies, especially on the freeway.",1201824000,4,1762,4.872909698996655
3335520,5,B0012Z5UM0,"I have seen the Japanese R2 release of this DVD. The same production team worked on Appleseed 2004, the version animated with the cel-shading technique. Cel-shading is used on this one as well but it looks a lot better, more like Final Fantasy: Advent Children. Gone is that shiny plastic look that was typical of the Appleseed 2004 characters. The producers went for a slick comic book feel, instead of the muted realism of Final Fantasy: Spirits Within. There is no pretense of recreating human movement and facial expressions absolutely perfectly. In that sense, it is more ""cartoony"" and ""comic-booky"", avoiding the creep factor of zombie-like characters with dead eyes imitating humans.

While Appleseed 2004 seemed like a drawn out, loud music video, Vexville is much better paced, with some character development, and an intricate storyline that has varying levels of interpretation. The theme is not revolutionary but it is a good showcase for the CGI. At least someone figured out that you need a plot in addition to fight scenes. Use Wikipedia to compare Vexille's plot outline to Appleseed 2004's plot outline to see that the storyline was key. The level of detail in the backgrounds is ridiculous, breathtaking in some cases. I have not enjoyed the look and feel of a movie like this since the 1st Matrix flick.

Until I see Appleseed, Ex Machina, I have to rank this one and Advent Children as the best all-CGI movies to come out of Japan so far. The producers balanced all of the factors needed to make a satisfying flick, so you are not sitting there watching a bunch of video game cut-scenes.

The soundtrack is excellent, mixing techno, ambient, reggae and soul. Paul Oakenfold provided the musical direction.

I would definitely recommend adding this to your collection of you were a fan of Spirits Within, Advent Children and Appleseed 2004. Vexville improves on the best of all those movies.",1201392000,8,1911,4.94392523364486

3335542,3,B0012Z5UM0,"This film is a completely stand alone film put together by the creators of ""Appleseed"".  It had many good points...but it still felt like it missed the mark...

FOR PARENTS AND OTHER INTERESTED FOLKS:
There really isn't anything to be too worried about on this film.  No nudity or other situations warranting that.  There are some profanities that happen occasionally.  And the violence is surprisingly tame (compared to what has been done with the ""Appleseed"" saga).  The themes and plot are intricate, though.  Still, if your kids are action aficionados, this is not the film for them...not even the right film to help expand their tastes beyond action.

MOVING ON:
Vexille is one of those niche films that will have a following...but it's still very niche.  I can say, that the visuals are very good, but not as powerful or profound as ""Appleseed Ex Machina"" (a prior CGI film from the same creators).  What do I mean from not as powerful and profound?  Well, what I mean is that the CG was A GOOD RENDERING (and definitely still well within 2008 CG capability) but seemed to lack some life in it.  I will say the cityscape was actually kinda cool, but...still the film was lacking the detailed vibrancy that we know the creators can put together.  The music was pretty cool though.  But that aside, the plot was actually pretty interesting and cool.  Very intriguing dissertations on various different social issues.  Also the story was not half bad at all.  It had fun moments and was generally cohesive.  What ultimately killed the film was weak acting and lack of strong dramatic pull.  There were very few action sequences, but of what action there was, most of them weren't special...and this is coming from someone who doesn't care as much for action as some others do (in fact many of my favorite films lack it all together haha).  But to be fair, 2 of them were kinda fun.  Still, it had a genuinely inspiring ending even though the other parts of the film seemed to lack the potency that these creators have been known for.

SPECIAL FEATURES:
there are 115 minutes worth of extra features & a little booklet showcasing some of the screenshots as well as a ""creator's interview"".  As far as the dvd extras themselves, there's too much to mention, but some highlights are ""Sori's Work as an Animation Creator"", ""Voice Acting Footage - the Voice of VEXILLE"", ""Creating the Cities in VEXILLE"",  ""Creating the Music in VEXILLE Parts 1 & 2"", ""Sori's Guest Lecture at Digital Hollywood Tokyo"", and ""Sori's Closing Comments"".  The film in general may not have impressed me much, but the special features are very intriguing and educational and worth a look.

ALL IN ALL:
This film was not as powerful as it was made out to be.  It had such a great set-up, but didn't quite capitalize on it.  Perhaps bad mis-advertising or something like that set it up for a fall.  Still, it does address good social questions and I have no regrets for purchasing it.  It's definitely not terrible, just a tad bit dry.",1332547200,,3007,4.704980842911877

I loved Vexille the first time I saw it, even if it got flaws, i still enjoyed it!
I have the DVD version, but as I got a new TV and blu ray player, I thought of buying this version.
The image quality is great, and sounds is amazing... but... the subtitles don't match at all...
They are totally different from the DVD version, and if u play the english dub with english subtitles, you will understand. It doesn't match the Japanese voice either... I dunno why they had to redo the sub, because on the DVD version it was perfect.
But it's kind of confusing, it's out of synchro, and it's just wrong 25% of the time.

I guess if you watch the japanese version with english dub, the wrong translation won't affect you (in case you actually don't understand japanese). But will still be kind of out of synchro.

Weird to admit but I couldn't get past the fact that whenever these characters turned their heads, not one strand of hair would move, let alone blow in the breeze. It felt like watching an anime version of ""Jersey Shore"".

Watching it, I honestly didn't care who was who, why the things happening were happening and why the big deal was made over Paul Oakenfold's score. I've seen hand drawn animation that was more realistic and human than this. Even the action scenes were nothing to write home about. As for the DVD itself, it looks and sounds okay with both English and Japanese 5.1 tracks (with english subs) supplying serviceable surround sound. There are no extras to speak of but you probably wouldn't care to look at them anyway even if there were. It reminded me a bit of the sequel to Ghost in the Shell, ""Innocence"" and the problems I had with that film were pretty much the same I had with this one.

3335547,4,B0012Z5UM0,"There are some spoilers in this review.

Aron and I just finished watching Vexille, an anime movie from the creators of Appleseed, which was released in Japan two years ago. The artistic styling is atypical of most anime, somewhere between traditional animation and CG animation. At first, I found it a little jarring, but quickly acclimated and found it highly enjoyable.

Vexille is aesthetically pleasing, very beautiful. While it suffers from the typical unmovable hair that plagues any anime (everyone in anime must invest in vats of hair gel), the robots have weight, the humans are expressive and the landscapes are breathtaking.

The basics of the story are these: Japan led the advancement of technology and began experimenting with cybertech. Terrified by the humanitarian ramifications of human androids, the UN forbade further research. Japan opposed the restriction and isolated themselves from the rest of the world. For ten years, no one has seen or heard from Japan, except for robotic exports from their largest technology company, Daiwa. When a Japanese diplomat calls a meeting and kills many of the remaining world leaders, the American militant group SWORD is dispatched to infiltrate Japan and find out what's happened in the last decade.

Some highlights: A limping gimp chase, huge metal sandworms, a tasteful love triangle and a pretty epic sacrifice.

Especially in contrast with our last anime purchase, Le Chevalier D'Eon, Vexille was a pleasant surprise. The story was strong, the voice-acting was solid and the dramatic execution was very good. There were a few cheesy lines, but just as many witty ones. I didn't cry, but I was choked up a few times. The romantic subplot was well-played, but didn't detract from the primary storyline. Usually, anime romances leave me cold. Best of all, it ended well. Endings are the hardest part and, most often, where anime looses me. I always end up wondering if something got lost in translation.

A vague review? A little. Vexille's plot twists a couple of times. The twists are good, but not surprising enough to let me say much about them without tipping over from review to spoiler. But if you like Anvil of Tears at all, then I expect you share at least some of my tastes. If you have the chance to see Vexille, I suggest you do so. It's a good trade: two hours of your time for a very good story.

Oh, yeah. The action is good, too. I almost forgot to mention it. I'm not much of an action buff and I rely on Aron to give our novels a little spice in that arena. When Aron says the Vexille action was good, I believe him absolutely.",1302480000,2,2608,4.808035714285714
3335548,4,B0012Z5UM0,"Well I suppose it's only right to open this review with a disclaimer.  Given my recent tear through the genre of (domestic) computer animated feature films, I suppose it's pretty much natural that curiosity and the desire to draw comparisons would lead me back to my anime roots.  After all, I reasoned, it's downright amazing how different the approach between American and Asian methodology is when concerning the art of computer-generated film:  Here in the States kid friendliness takes the foreground with just enough layered humor/ cleverness to offer entertainment to viewers of all ages.

Anime features like Vexille take a very different development path right from the onset in that this is essentially an animated version of an adult oriented motion picture.  No need to take my word for it, the synopsis verifies this reality:

In the near future, Japan has achieved a global monopoly on robotics development. In response to an international ban on android development in 2067, Japan goes as far as to withdraw from the U.N. then adapts its advanced technology to isolate itself from the rest of the world. A decade later, a secret meeting with politicians organized by Japan's leading Daiwa Heavy Industries gets raided by S.W.O.R.D., an elite U.S. Navy task force of which female lead Vexille (and her lover Leon) are members. The circumstances encountered during that raid convince S.W.O.R.D. to undertake a daring infiltration of Japan itself, and what Vexille discovers happening there could pose a threat to the future of all of humanity.

If all of this sounds slightly familiar, that's because Vexille plays upon almost all of the popular anime touchstones in near point for point accuracy.  However, what is interesting is that this piece clearly positions the nation that spawned it as the international villain with an American force called upon to come in and clean up the Japanese jumble.

On the surface this may all sound like the perfect formula for an action-packed, science fiction based thrill ride (and it is); it's also the catalyst for some pretty powerful political statements.  The danger of nationalistic tendencies, the definition of sentience, and the line separating man and machine are just some of the underlying themes presented here.  Some of it is a bit heavier handed in its delivery than others but overall the message comes through loud and clear.

And even if the underlying message translation isn't your bag, Vexille is nothing short of a feast for the optics. The production team behind the hugely successful Appleseed CG film reunites here and delivers on a blend of cell shading coupled with rotoscoping to create a visual stunner.  Truly some of the scenes more powerful segments require a second look just ensure that it isn't in fact actual footage.

Pacing is perfect with a film that progresses smoothly across it's under two-hour runtime without ever coming across as rushed or bogged down within its prose.

Critics are quick to point out a lack of plausibility with the some of the story's plot points and indeed, nitpicking certainly results in a few plot holes but I'm of the opinion that the core of the entertainment value here is found in the suspension of disbelief rather than by attempting to find faults in some of the fictional reasoning.

Now comes the trickiest part of the review, the language debate.  Like all sub & dub anime titles, Vexille is perhaps strongest emotionally when viewed in its native Japanese (with English subtitles for those of us who cannot understand the language).  However, the English dub is very strong here as well.  This one in particular seems to deviate from the original dialog more than is customary in a dub, due surely to the fact that some of the native script could well be considered offensive by many cultures.  However, what results is quite a solid English dub from Funimation's upper echelon of vocal talent (led here by Colleen Clinkenbeard).

In all Vexille is a film that does an awful lot of things really well. On the surface it is an action spectacle with cool armor, awesome technology, futuristic politics and intense action scenes.  Below the surface it's the catalyst for some intelligent concepts and serious concerns about the world around us.  I thoroughly enjoyed this one from beginning to end and feel the experience was certainly a reminder as to what it is that makes anime sensibilities so attractive to me in the first place.",1296604800,2,4462,4.9838274932614555
3335549,4,B0012Z5UM0,"Recently caught this one one Netflix streaming and it was a great way to spend two hours.  In the near future Japan has cut itself off from the rest of the world.  And tucked away in their veil of darkness something evil is brewing.  It takes a crack team of American commandos to breach the high tech defenses and get to the bottom of the mystery of what exactly is happening in the orient.

The animation is quite good and reminded me of a highly polished, extended cutscene from a good video game.  In fact, I'm surprised that they haven't turned this one into an outing for the Xbox 360 or PS3.  The storyline is quite intriguing as the lead character finds herself behind enemy lines with unlikely allies.  I especially liked the metallic monsters who were one-offs of the Dune sand worms.

So, in summary...  good animation, great action, and a fun way to spend an evening immersed in the not too distant future.  Vexille is worth a look.",1295654400,2,944,4.5
3335550,2,B0012Z5UM0,"It's all in the eye of the beholder really, but my eye rates this as sub-par.  Let me start by saying that I bought this based on reviews that said it was very similar to the Appleseed series. I enjoyed Appleseed Ex Machina immensely, and this ....... is nothing like it.  Not sure why reviewers even draw a similarity with Appleseed. The story is a little weak and ultimately forgettable, and it seems like a lot less time was spent designing the CGI when compared to Ex Machina.

In all I wasn't too thrilled about the storyline and the CGI and animation were just ""ok"".  If I had the choice I would not buy this again. I'll give it another watch and see if my attitude changes, but for now it's a pass.",1294444800,,705,4.2781954887218046
3335551,5,B0012Z5UM0,This had a really good story which to me is the top priority in anything I watch. I'm also a fan of Appleseed. I didn't like the story of Appleseed: Ex Machina to give you idea of my tastes. The animation on this was great.

3335552,3,B0012Z5UM0,"A Japanese corporation, Daiwa, has captured all the robotics market on Earth and by 2077 taken complete control of Japan, withdrawn from the UN and continues work on banned android research, after sealing themselves off behind an impenetrable barrier.  With the UN worried about what is going on, the US Navy Special Forces SWORD team is going in.  What they find inside the shield is astonishing, and could destroy the human race.  In this anime we get a soft, blurry ""Appleseed"" look and personal sized armored suits instead of the larger mechs.  Autonomous combat robots too.  Heroine Vexille (pronounced vex-eel) has a slim love triangle going with other warriors, but this storyline is really only hinted at.  No real character development occurs.  In total, it's a bit of ""Appleseed"" with ""Road Warrior"" and the monster/sandworm from ""Mission to Mars"" and ""Dune"" in a big action movie that was strangely hollow and just felt like stale popcorn.  Disappointing.",1291852800,,966,5.10828025477707
3335553,4,B0012Z5UM0,"It seems the big buzzword when this first came out was that is was 3D anime. While these days that term would make people wonder if you need special glasses when watching what it really boils down to is the animation is made to look like traditional anime and use traditional anime sensibilities while being made completely as a CG animated film. I think in that regard the movie accomplishes its claim. As a feature film it also accomplishes a lot of what it set out to do. However this isn't the hallmark in film making or animation the ""3-D Animated"" buzzword makes it out to be. Leave that moniker behind and you still have a good film.

A lot of the plot and visual elements are pretty derivative of other films like Ghost in the Shell and Dune if you look for them. They aren't really blatant ripoffs, but you can see some ideas ended up being similar to previous films. That's not to say the story of Vexille is derivative. It's an interesting combination of military style action, social commentary, and a somewhat nihilistic view of the future. The big reveal of this movie is pretty disturbing if you think about it, and must of caused a stir in Japan when it was first released in theaters.

The character development in Vexille is kind of stilted and depends a lot upon subtle observations to really figure out what is going on inside the heads of the major players. Because of this what I think was one of the stronger points of the film ends up being muted. Part of also stems from the ""acting"" on the screen being just as muted. While visually it adheres better to the 3D Anime concept there is a trade off. Is it enough to kill that development? Not really, but better execution on this front would have enhanced the experience greatly.

The story is interesting and there is enough character development to satisfy me. What about the fun stuff? Well there is action aplenty on Vexille. The movie actually starts off on a high note with a dynamic infiltration scene complete with explosions fast moving mech suits and lots of robots getting blown up. A little later in the film you get a nice little chase scene with a cool looking motorcycle, more robots and explosions. After a few more little action scenes in between exposition you get a pretty exciting high speed tunnel race-against-time scene. So yeah there is some good, fun action that pulls at the chords of you adrenaline junkies.

Animated films sometimes live or die by the quality of their animation. While a really good story can make up for sub-par animation the ones people remember most at least look pretty. Vexille does a great job with the animated feat they were attempting. Essentially what you are getting is cell shaded CG animation, which is why I don't call this movie ground breaking. What makes this particular cell shaded CG animation stand out is the level of depth in the art they put into it. They really do take the best elements of traditional cell drawn anime and incorporate them into this new environment. Subtle details and movements are added for realism. Shading and lighting are put to very effective use. It really is a marriage of both worlds.

Visually the movie is striking, but I never saw it on DVD and have a hard time trying to pick out what may be resolution enhancements from the Blu-Ray that aren't as clear on upscaled standard definition. Don't get me wrong. There is likely a very, very big difference. But I'm not the one to tell you that for sure. What I can tell you is the audio is kind of a mixed bag for me. Dialog scenes are at a noticeably lower volume than scenes where the music kicks in. It was annoying enough for me to have to adjust the volume to hear the talking and lower it enough to not be drowned out by the soundtrack. The soundtrack? Eh... it's okay with some good points and some areas where the music misses the fit with the movie.

The Blu-Ray has essentially the same special features as the Special Edition DVD and packs it all into a single disk. The special features list a whole bunch of things, but essentially what you are getting are two documentaries. The first one has about 95% of that stuff you are reading on the back of the BD case, and are little chapters of the pre-release documentary. Each ""chapter"" runs anywhere between less than two minutes to a little over six minutes, and cover various parts of production up to the premiere at the Locarno Film Festival. The second documentary, THE SECRETS OF VEXILLE, cover post release comments from director Fumihiko Sori along with various film footage. All in all the two documentaries cover a lot of details, and easily make up for the lack of any audio commentary on the disk.

Anime fans will definitely want to see Vexille as it hits all the marks that generally make good anime. Sci-Fi fans should be able to appreciate how the story unfolds and the implications that you end up with by the end. If you like good stories and can afford to forgive a little dry character development in a movie that hangs on said development then you're going to find something to like in Vexille as well.",1288828800,,5101,4.550108932461874

SWORD isn't just fighting for their lives but for all of humanity.

I watched this movie on Hulu. Being a fan of animation and of Science Fiction I was excited by the prospect of a mature but not vulgar CGI anime film. I found a story that was adequate but with several other aspects of the film severely lacking. Characters, as is seemingly always the case with anime, have dark secrets and a past that haunts them. In Vexille, though, the relationships are not ever fully explored leaving the viewer with the end results but not any resolution. We are never given enough time with any of the characters to care if they live or not. This is probably a fair complaint about most action movies, but in a SciFi film where thinking is a requirement this is a huge oversight. Finally, the CGI looks great when the characters aren't moving (look at the stills on the main product page), but the animation looks on par with last generation video game consoles, like the PS2. If this movie were the collected outtakes of a Final Fantasy game from five years ago we wouldn't think much of it. But this film came out after several other CGI films that look much better so there is no excuse for sub par animation.

Overall, an action flick that was fine to watch for free on Hulu, but I wouldn't pay for it or recommend that others do. Simply an average film at best.",1266192000,,1861,4.502958579881657

3335561,3,B0012Z5UM0,"I was expecting Vexille to be something interesting, a codename for some kind of robot or android, it turned out all it was, is the main character's name. This movie is from the same team that brought Appleseed and Ex Machina to the world and they're up to their usual visual brilliance here. Despite the excellent graphical designs and cinematography though, the story is a little flat footed and by the half-way point I found myself caring less about the protagonist and more about those around her who we see very little of aside from their brief appearances in relation to her. The audience is never given any reason to like or relate to Vexille and in fact she comes off as little more than an annoyance frequently enough during her interactions with the other characters who seem far more central to the plot than she ever does. Another issue with the story, is how rushed everything seems, the audience is literally whisked from location to location with little or no regard for pacing and by the end you're left wondering what exactly has happened as you've been given no downtime during the film itself to consider what the story is trying to get at. Despite these shortcomings, the Appleseed team is able to create an impressive world view when the movie slows down enough for you to appreciate it and there are moments which are just as powerful as either of the Appleseed movies. So if you're a fan of those two films, or just of the Appleseed team, take a look at Vexille you might find it to your liking, or you might feel like you've just suffered storyboard whiplash.

3335563,3,B0012Z5UM0,"It doesn't come as a huge surprise that ""Vexille"" is from the people who brought the world ""Appleseed"" and its even better sequel ""Appleseed Ex Machina."" The cyberpunk flavor, the big mecha, and the futuristic world of politico-techno conflict are all firmly in place, along with some pretty slam-bang action sequences and a darker, grittier feeling. It's a pretty entertaining story -- now if only it had fleshed out the main cast a little more.

About seventy years in the future, the world is worried about the advancement of robotics technology. So the UN orders them restricted, and Japan decides to cut itself off from the rest of the world.

But ten years later, a biomechanical leg shows the UN just what has been going on in Japan. So the American tech police known as SWORD are sent into Japan to find out if the isolated country has been doing illegal robotics research, which no other country allows. They aren't, and the movie ends there. Seriously, the Daiwa Corporation has decided to guide mankind's evolution through machinery, and the the SWORD agents are met with a very warm, nasty welcome.

After being rescued by the rebel Maria, Vexille finds that the biorobotics Daiwa Corporation has reduced the once-proud Japan to a vast, barren slum devoid of truly human life. Even worse, a nanotech ""vaccine"" transforms the Japanese into mindless machines. Vexille's only hope of saving herself -- and her lover Leon -- is to join forces with a small band of rebels before Japan is completely destroyed by Daiwa.

""Vexille"" is a very different animal from the ""Appleseed"" movies. While it has the nimble shiny mecha and exploding buildings, the focus is on political machinations and evil corporations whose morality makes your hair stand on end. There's no utopia here for our tough heroine -- it's more like one of the outer circles of Dante's Hell.

The scenes in Vexille's home are colourful and streamlined, set in a futuristic city. But things get darker soon, taking us to the sickly yellow light and shabby shanty town of Japan, and things don't lighten up. And that devastated Japan is a pretty brilliant creation, both in its decayed misery and in the bleak future that its few remaining ""fragments of humanity"" have. The big flaw: the characters spend loooooong stretches of the movie just grimly talking to each other, with too little action.

Fortunately when there IS action, the fight scenes are top-notch in quality -- it has exploding buildings, missiles, battling mecha and chases through a marketplace. The fight scenes grow in intensity as Vexille and Maria reach the climactic confrontation with the Big Bad Guy. And the semi-apocalyptic finale is both shocking and inevitable -- as well as a helluva way to end a movie.

And then there's the jags, which are also quite cool -- giant wormlike masses of technology and metal that devour anything they come across. Not only are they wonderfully freaky, but they come across as a sort of cyber-sandworm from ""Dune."" Lovely.

And the animation is pretty astounding, though it has an oddly rotoscoped look in some action scenes. It's detailed and gloriously vivid, despite its grimy, shadowy look. And that includes exquisite details like snowflakes being individually swept from a windshield, or a reflection in a transparent helmet -- or even a smooth-skinned, nimble mecha exploding into a building with almost stunning speed. This glorious look almost makes up for the stretches of relatively action-free plot.

Perhaps its biggest weakness is in the characterization. It feels like they put a lot of effort into creating lifelike-looking characters. But despite the spunky Vexille and some touching moments from the Japanese cyborgs, the characters never quite come alive. Call it the ""Final Fantasy: Spirits Within"" effect. The best-rounded character is probably Maria, the tragic rebel leader who also provides a little romantic tension for our elf-faced heroine.

""Vexille"" is a flawed little semiprecious gem -- brilliant animation, a tough heroine and mildly horrific Japan. Flawed, but has plenty of chills and explosions.",1251676800,,4112,5.069526627218935

*Spoilers*

For anime fans, this will be an easy decision: Did you enjoy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Appleseed/dp/B0007OY31G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Appleseed</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Appleseed-Ex-Machina/dp/B0010358D0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Appleseed Ex Machina</a>? If so, you will enjoy 'Vexille'. The look and feel of 'Vexille' is almost identical to 'Appleseed', but that's not necessarily a bad thing. There's the same short-haired tough-as-nails military chick who's been poured into a suit of power armor; there's the same underlying (and ironic) suspicion against technology and that it might one day control us. And, of course, we have humans who aren't really humans. What more could you possibly ask for?

If you haven't seen the 'Appleseed' movies or are new to anime in general, 'Vexille' is not a bad place to start. The budget for this movie must have been *huge* by anime standards because everything looks incredibly beautiful and the voice acting is professional and smooth. I'd even say that 'Vexille' is a BETTER introduction into this style of movie than 'Appleseed', because the introductory scene setting is much simpler, and with a lot fewer dead or presumed-dead people to keep track of. That's always a plus.

Not that 'Vexille' is without faults. The plot is extremely predictable at several points, and sometimes this is problematic, because I can't tell whether the movie means to be predictable or not. For instance, the 'evil replacement humans' at the beginning is announced so obviously that they might as well have run a scroll text at the bottom of the screen to that effect, so that seems like an intentional reveal rather than a sloppy set-up, and it kind of works - since the 'twist reveal' doesn't occur until much later, the viewer is left wondering why, exactly, the switcheroo (assuming it isn't forgotten in all the explosions between the beginning and the ending). And the old ""girlfriend left behind"" chestnut is so overused that even the *main character* sees it coming a mile away, and while it IS nice to have sensible characters for once, the lack of surprise or suspense does kind of prevent complete immersion in the movie. The few golden moments of shock and surprise, for instance the internal state of Japan, tend to get lost in the really idiotic 'twists' that the writers didn't think through - like the completely ridiculous premise that a person could live completely surrounded by androids without them catching on that their companion was human. *eyeroll*

I'm being overly critical, though, as usual. 'Vexille' is a good, solid movie and a good addition to any anime collection and I recommend it. I will note, though, that 'Vexille' falls into the same trap as so many anime movies and doesn't bother to match the English subtitles for the hearing impaired to the actual spoken English dubs, which is very vexing for people like me who use the subtitles to follow the action. Oddly, we actually preferred the spoken dialogue to the written subtitles, which is strange because it usually goes the other way around with anime movies, in my experience.

3335565,1,B0012Z5UM0,"Vexille starts out promising with its interesting premise: Japan essentially removes itself from the rest of the world to pursue unchecked robotic research on its citizens. Everything else is terrible. There are a few cool moments of action, but they completely ape other, better films (most notably the recent Appleseed movies--despite what it says on the box, none of the major creative talent on those films worked on Vexille).

Willing suspension of disbelief is required for all sci-fi films, but Vexille asks far too much from its audience. It presents one ridiculous scenario after another (the most common of which are the desert sand worms made out of rapidly spinning chunks of metal). Technical designs are strange as well. The suits the film's heroes wear have a helmet design that, if created in real life, would only serve to impair the wearer's vision (and be very heavy at the same time). Things like that just don't make sense.

Vexille isn't even good as mindless fluff. I, personally, cannot stand to have my intelligence insulted by a film (especially one I watch voluntarily). Vexille starts doing it in the first few minutes and doesn't stop until the credits roll.",1242691200,2,1187,4.98989898989899

Yes, a big ""but"". I think the idea, that the plot based on, is intriguing, yet execution of the story turns out to be not so interesting after the first half. Makers could have done a million different and more interesting things with it but they chose the safest way, I think. As a result the movie became ""Just Another Sci-Fi Anime"" instead of ""Oh My God This Is Awesome"".

The movie also has a distinct style at animation. CGI is fluid and as I've said, stylish.  My only problem with CGI anime is the human motion, or lack of it. It just doesn't feel right. For example, characters hands move around but fingers look like frozen fish sticks, no movement at all, just not natural. Exception to my comment is handshots with gun in a characters hand.

Normally I only half watch things, turning on my faithful Laptop Toshi and sign onto aim. For Vexille, I didn't. I dimmed the lights and watched it in my room alone.

The idea of an isolated Japan is a nice modernization of history, and has the level of political complexity that I usually appreciate in a movie. Unfortunately, that was about as far as it went for me with this film. All of the other details were trite and cliche, and too often the characters and the Type-A, military dialog are ripped right out of the typical action movie playbook. The umpteenth attempt at hardened, take-charge personalities that offer a glimmer of sensitivity is, at this point, dull characterization. With such a promising plot-line, there may have been a better angle at the story so that the characters were as original as the plot.",1237593600,,719,4.76

The anime was not terribly innovative, and the quality was only OK.  The story started off pretty well, with a dramatic opening and some interesting relationships developing, but loses its way among existential angst and the dread of losing ones identity in a post-industrial age.

I watched it in English.  I may have lost something that was communicated by the original.

Overall, it just not that engaging, and didn't inspire me enough to watch it again and try to understand it better.

All the rest of the movie is just a bunch of bullcrap of the americans trying to figure out what the japanese are up to, then find out they've essentially been ""wiped out.""  I saw on the cover of the movie it said ""Balls-to-the-wall action - Geek magazine.""  If they think this is balls to the wall action, i think Geek magazine just lost all credibility.  I guess being ""geeks"" they thought it was an awesome, action packed movie simply because it was in CG.  The movie sucked.  Do not buy it, if I could get my money back, I would.

I couldn't give the film five stars though and here's why. **Warning** this assessment is mostly for people who prefer plot over explosions and anime fantasy women in tight suits.  As is my experience with all anime, even Appleseed, the plot development and dialogue was a little odd and sometimes non-existant in many scenes which were a little jumbled, but the overall affect was not diminished. The titular character's background is lacking while a supporting character Maria seemed more important and more complex.  Another thing I disliked was a reminiscent Vexille throwing existentialist cheese at the very end to make a point about humanity and machinery.  Not that existentialism isn't important, it's just the point had been made already and the ending scene made me roll my eyes as it gave me an unnecessary and awkward synopsis on Maria and reiterated to me that machinery is bad and humanity is good.  Got it! Thanks for the info.  Moving on...the bad guy too was way too contrived, as usual, but after seeing him for the first time in the middle of the film we only get a snippet into his story in the memories of Maria near the end with little explanation.  I guess my need for a backstory on the guy ruins the effect his character is suppose to have on me.  Unfortunately, he is reduced to the typical mad scientist bent on world domination.  Sad, he could have been great.  My overall assessment is excellent, however.  It is way better than some of the crap Hollywood puts out even the so called ""Oscar worthy.""",1235260800,,1677,4.748275862068965

3335577,4,B0012Z5UM0,"Vexille was one of those movies that captured my imagination from the moment I saw a Japanese trailer with English subtitles that showed up on YouTube. I'm not a huge Anime film but I love good science fiction, and especially stories that have to do with synthetic life (Blade Runner is my favorite movie of all time).

I watched this movie as a lower quality download, and was pretty impressed. Now on Blue Ray, I am even more impressed. The quality of the animation is probably the best I've ever seem and looks truly amazing on Blue Ray. The visuals are the real reason to buy this film. They are eye candy well worth watching even if the storyline itself could have been more engaging.

The score is also significantly good. With a diversity of tracks from unheard of bands, greats like Dead Can Dance, Asian pop bands, and even Paul Oakenfold (who apparently is doing a lot of film scores these days as his DJ career has dried up). ""Future Love Theme"" is simply awesome, and so is ""Host Of Seraphim."" The music is integrated with the visuals in a way that is only possible with an animated film where the director has control over every single visual element. There is a brilliant montage in the first third of the movie set to ""Close Your Eyes,"" that is one of the best I've ever seen since Donnie Darko's school montage set to ""Head Over Heals"" by Tears for Fears.

The plot line is a bit convoluted and ultimately doesn't deliver the same sort of pay off that the build up suggested it might. Sadly, there was a lot more potential to the story than what was delivered, and I found myself wishing that they had polished up the story a bit. However, the visuals and sound put make this a really solid movie.

S.W.O.R.D. is a secret U.S. special forces team sent in to find out  what diabolical activities are occurring on the inside.

3335587,3,B0012Z5UM0,"It doesn't come as a huge surprise that ""Vexille"" is from the people who brought the world ""Appleseed"" and its even better sequel ""Appleseed Ex Machina.""

And in ""Vexille,"" the cyberpunk flavor, the big mecha, and the futuristic world full of political and technological conflict are all firmly in place, along with some pretty slam-bang action sequences and a darker, grittier feeling. While it lacks some character development and feels rather bleak at times, it's still a pretty entertaining story -- now if only it had fleshed out the main cast a little more.

About seventy years in the future, the world is worried about the advancement of robotics technology. So the UN orders them restricted, and Japan decides to cut itself off from the rest of the world.

But ten years later, a biomechanical leg shows the UN just what has been going on in Japan. So the American tech police known as SWORD are sent into Japan to find out if the isolated country has been doing illegal robotics research, which no other country allows. They aren't, and the movie ends there. Seriously, the Daiwa Corporation has decided to guide mankind's evolution through machinery, and the the SWORD agents are met with a very warm, nasty welcome.

After being rescued by the rebel Maria, Vexille finds that the biorobotics Daiwa Corporation has reduced the once-proud Japan to a vast, barren slum devoid of truly human life. Even worse, a nanotech ""vaccine"" transforms the Japanese into mindless machines. Vexille's only hope of saving herself -- and her lover Leon -- is to join forces with a small band of rebels before Japan is completely destroyed by Daiwa.

""Vexille"" is a very different animal from the ""Appleseed"" movies. While it has the nimble shiny mecha and exploding buildings, the focus is on political machinations and evil corporations whose morality makes your hair stand on end. There's no utopia here for our tough heroine -- it's more like one of the outer circles of Dante's Hell.

The scenes in Vexille's home are colourful and streamlined, set in a futuristic city. But things get darker soon, taking us to the sickly yellow light and shabby shanty town of Japan, and things don't lighten up. And that devastated Japan is a pretty brilliant creation, both in its decayed misery and in the bleak future that its few remaining ""fragments of humanity"" have. The big flaw: the characters spend loooooong stretches of the movie just grimly talking to each other, with too little action.

Fortunately when there IS action, the fight scenes are top-notch in quality -- it has exploding buildings, missiles, battling mecha and chases through a marketplace. The fight scenes grow in intensity as Vexille and Maria reach the climactic confrontation with the Big Bad Guy. And the semi-apocalyptic finale is both shocking and inevitable -- as well as a helluva way to end a movie.

And then there's the jags, which are also quite cool -- giant wormlike masses of technology and metal that devour anything they come across. Not only are they wonderfully freaky, but they come across as a sort of cyber-sandworm from ""Dune."" Lovely.

And the animation is pretty astounding, though it has an oddly rotoscoped look in some action scenes. It's detailed and gloriously vivid, despite its grimy, shadowy look. And that includes exquisite details like snowflakes being individually swept from a windshield, or a reflection in a transparent helmet -- or even a smooth-skinned, nimble mecha exploding into a building with almost stunning speed. This glorious look almost makes up for the stretches of relatively action-free plot.

Perhaps its biggest weakness is in the characterization. It feels like they put a lot of effort into creating lifelike-looking characters. But despite the spunky Vexille and some touching moments from the Japanese cyborgs, the characters never quite come alive. Call it the ""Final Fantasy: Spirits Within"" effect. The best-rounded character is probably Maria, the tragic rebel leader who also provides a little romantic tension for our elf-faced heroine.

""Vexille"" is a flawed little semiprecious gem -- brilliant animation, a tough heroine and mildly horrific Japan. Flawed, but has plenty of chills and explosions.",1219449600,,4229,5.070503597122302
3335588,4,B0012Z5UM0,"Having watched ""Appleseed"", it was pretty much a no brainer that I would be giving ""VEXILLE"" a try.

The latest theatrical effort from SORI combining 3D and animation together that have made films such as the two ""Appleseed"" films has been quite exciting to watch and see develop overtime and just pretty much to see where animators are able to take things to a new level is always exciting.

As a viewer, I'm open to new technologies and to see technology and well-told storylines come together.

Of course, what makes things even more interesting is that SORI (Sori Fumuhiko) has evolved from his directorial debut with the live action theatrical hit ""Ping Pong"" back in 2001, produced the 2004 ""Appleseed"" film and here he is now as the director and screenwriter for the animated film ""VEXILLE"".

With ""VEXILLE"", the creators of the ""Appleseed"" film are back with a storyline that I have to say is quite thought provoking and animation that is quite mesmerizing to watch but this is a storyline that I wish was fleshed out in several movies than just one.

I have to admit that I really enjoyed the film.

I really enjoyed the awesome animation, I really enjoyed the storyline but I would love to find out from SORI if there were scenes cut or if he would loved to have made this film a two-parter or maybe a trilogy.

You get hooked on these characters such as Vexille, Leon, Maria and you just want more character development. Heck, even the main enemy scientist of Daiwa or even the corporation itself, you want to ask why did they do what they did. You are left with questions but of course, there is only so much you can cover in a film that is already at 105 minutes long.

So, for me, I wish the storyline would lead to another film but pretty much the way everything was written, everything is contained to one story, one movie and focusing on the overall situation in Japan ala 2077 than the characters.

With this exciting movie, you are just left wanting more and its a shame that the DVD doesn't have any special features. It's one thing for Hollywood companies to hold back and release so many multiple versions of a DVD but if there is one nitpicky thing I have about this DVD is that the Asian release gets the goodies, while those of us in the US will probably have to wait for a better release on Blu-ray.

But all in all, the DVD is definitely solid. I really love how animation and technology have come to play with the ""Appleseed"" films and even ""SOS: TOKYO METRO EXPLORERS: THE NEXT"" to ""FINAL FANTASY: ADVENT CHILDREN"".

It's good to see Japan taking chances on these type of films that utilize 3D and animation together and I know that it may not be the greatest thing for anime purists but for those who are able to accept technology and for creators to release something that is not just eye candy but having an engaging storyline is important.

""VEXILLE"" by no means is a perfect film but it's a very good film that features mind-blowing animation utilizing new technology.

As for the DVD, it's barebones but for now, it's what is currently out and definitely recommend people giving it a try!",1218153600,2,3123,4.545454545454546

The soundtrack, done by Paul Oakenfold was really good - but a little to hardcore in some of the action/fight scenes. We had to keep turning the volume down during those parts then turn it back up for dialogue. This is just a personal preference - many of you will likely love the heavy feel to it.

Ok that's it for what I didn't completely like!

Animation - superb. There was however, a very interesting aspect to the animation. The details on the characters (the people) were scaled back when compared to the details on the environment/effects/buildings/etc. You could see rich wood grain on the walls of buildings, but the character's hair barely moved in a harsh wind. Skin features were missing, yet mechanical aspects to body armor were complete with detail. It was an interesting perspective that the environment was more detailed than the actual people. Even things such as lighting effects from a vehicle were amazing to watch.

Plot - also superb, and very impressive offering from Japan. Vexille is the main character of the movie - but you don't find out that it's actually the character's name until half-way into the movie. It starts out with a bang - Japan has cut off all uncontrolled contact with the outside world and has erected a very impressive barrier/shield around the entire island to prevent signals coming in or out - basically a total blackout of the island. A team of elite soldiers operating outside the auspices of the US and United Nations is tasked to infiltrate the island - the first ""visitors"" in 10 years - to determine if they are building a prohibited bio-mechanical technology. What's been going on in Japan for the last 10 years since the blackout? You'll have to watch the movie and see.

This is a full length feature with exciting action sequences, violence, a bit of romance, and an effective storyline that has made me want to watch more animated movies like this. Sci-fi is thick in the plot, so expect a lot of ""tech"".

We watched it with the English audio track and no subtitles, but you can watch it in native language with English subtitles if desired. There are a few special previews on the DVD, but they are mostly advertisements of other Japanese animations that are now available for purchase.

3335591,3,B0012Z5UM0,"VEXILLE is an odd film.  There's much to like, but there's a lot that's puzzling.  The film has several strong scenes, sequences and set pieces, yet never seems to string them together into a total coherent work.  It ends up as an enjoyable enough experience, although not one that will go down as a classic of the genre.

The movie is set in 2077 A.D.  Humanity is becoming more technologically dependent, but the United Nations has decided to outlaw the most advanced applications in the field of robotics.  Ten years before the film's opening, Japan has cut itself off from the rest of the world.  While some trading vessels still sail into Japanese waters, physical and electronic barriers prevent all outsiders from knowing what has taken place over the past ten years.

Enter Vexille and the rest of her team.  Vexille works for the United States Air Force and their mission is to infiltrate and disable the forced communications blackout.  Naturally, the changes within Japan have been dramatic, and the mission is far more dangerous and important than any of the planners have realized.

There is a lot to like about VEXILLE and I would like to be able to say that it's a great piece of work.  However, the whole never manages to completely hold together.  There are long stretches where the pacing slows to a crawl.  The genuinely impressive sequences tend to be followed by uninspired scenes which really hurt the flow of the movie.

For a perfect example of this feeling of frustration I felt, let me go over the entire fifteen minute pre-credit sequence.  During these scenes we see an action-packed fight sequence, showcasing the computer generated animated effects at their finest.  The pacing is great, the direction is exciting.  But there's one problem: we have no context in which to place this action.  We have no idea who the good guys are, who the bad guys are.  We don't know their motivations.  We don't know why they are fighting.  We don't know what the benefit would be to the winner or the peril that would be faced by the loser.  Everything looks great; it's just hard to care.

There are many plainly interesting science-fiction ideas in the film.  Looking back over the movie, there are a lot of great moments and concepts which -- unfortunately -- aren't given a fantastic movie in which to grow.  That is probably the most frustrating thing about VEXILLE.

3335603,3,B0012Z5UM0,"Yeah, the story's good (if confusing), and the sets are amazing.  But the animation has that sort of 'topo map' appearance like 'A Scanner Darkly' had - which to me is very off-putting and we spend more time discussing the animation techniques than paying attention to the movie.  There were too many obvious plot devices.

Although the latter half of the movie contained some amazing action sequences, I feel the overall time spent watching was pretty much a waste of time for me.  I felt no emotional involvement with any of the characters or with the mission behind SWORD - although the head of Daiwa was sufficiently insane to make me want to see him suffer.  Both my husband and I felt this was very derivative of The Matrix (man vs. machines, hopeless situation, etc.).  The 'jags' reminded us of the swarms of 'squiddies' and the people of Tokyo were just like the citizens of Zion.

A word about the DVD.  The soundtrack (also very Matrix-y) played continuously through the movie, even during dialogue.  But there was no adjustment made to the volume levels of the music, while the dialogue was going on.  We had the TV up to volume 40 (normally we hover around 25-30) and still had a hard time making out a lot of the dialogue because the voices were soft-spoken (at times) and the music was intrusive.",1215648000,,1311,4.636363636363637
3335604,4,B0012Z5UM0,"Vexille is an interesting showcase for CGI anime. The animation in parts was very impressive, however the storyline was disjointed and implausible. The action sequences were well done but lots of the dialogue didn't really go anywhere.  Overall, its light entertainment but not completely satisfying.",1214265600,,300,5.666666666666667
3335605,3,B0012Z5UM0,"It's from the creators of Appleseed, and though Appleseed wasn't phenomenal, it was more entertaining than this effort. That's not to say that Vexille is a bad movie, but gosh are there quite a few things wrong with it.

For starters, the animation, while good in part, just isn't quite there yet. Some scenes looked fantastic, and others look plain unfinished in their presentation. Since Appleseed was a while ago now, I expected this style to be near perfected as it were, and this wasn't the case. Many times things took an all-too cel-shaded look, which clearly the movie wasn't try to present. That said, other parts looked wonderful, with snowflakes being brushed off a windshield near the beginning with no obvious repeating snowflake pattern as other animators are won't to do to save animation time. I mostly just wished the characters were a little more organic... ( for example the animators really weren't even trying during the one kiss in the movie...)

But there are worse problems than the animation: Even if you follow things very carefully from the get-go, confusion is bound to ensue for a good part of the start of the movie. The problem here stems in great part from a language barrier. If you watch this movie in the original Japanese track with subtitles (as you should!), the issue is that the Americans (our protagonists for this movie) for no apparent reason speak wonderful Japanese in a decidedly Japanese accent, because... well... the movie features an entirely Japanese voice cast. Now, if the antagonists of this movie are also Japanese..., well, you see the problem here. You're not entirely sure who's whom until things really get rolling.

The other issue is that the movie starts off at a decent pace, and then slows down to quite a crawl. A little more action would have really helped, especially since what action we do get is very-well done, Matrix-ish, over-the-top, slow-moed etc. Toward the end, though, things picked up nicely, though the ending narrative (I knew it was coming, too) is an utter cliche.

And lastly, the movie proudly displays Paul Okenfold as providing the original score for this movie. While in theory this is a great thing, it sounded like (pun intended) Paul wasn't sure what to do with this movie, as the soundtrack for the first 80% of the movie is absolutely awful. Some scenes that could have been wonderfully dramatic are shattered by techno poop. Yes, techno poop. It's a new genre, where you merge techno and poop and call it music. It's a real shame, too. But with that said, the climactic scene has some great, great beats that really serve to increase the mood. I was VERY into that final scene, let me tell you, and the music played a huge part in that.

So, overall, not a bad effort for a movie. Still feels a little same-old in terms of anime, but worth a view.

3335606,4,B0012Z5UM0,"During the opening 20 minutes, I had fears Vexille was a soulless action flick.  The graphics (it is computer generated, after all) look like what we might see at the end of the Playstation 3's lifecycle, or in the next generation of consoles, not as impressive as, say, Advent Children, yet they are extremely expressive, bringing us elements from hand-drawn animation.  The characterization is, at times, shallow, and the storyline trite and at firstly nonsensical, but by the end of the film, viewers will find themselves impressed by how everything has come together, given something moving to hold onto that was more memorable and interesting (at least to me) than the lauded action sequences, sort of an allegorical analysis of what it is to be human, in the standard Japanese mold of never giving up, and isn't that why we like a good story anyway, to learn more about ourselves?

Lovers of Japan might be especially affected.  I was.

As far as the voice acting, I can't comment on the English, as I viewed it with the Japanese dialog on.",1213833600,2,1046,4.788888888888889

Set in the future, Japan has isolated itself against a world that seeks to stop the integration of robotics with human beings. Japan (in the story) is a world leader in the development of these robot applications, but everyone else on the planet fears it and makes it illegal. An American military elite group secretly invades to investigate their doings, and the action-packed story takes off from there.

The plot is surprisingly sophisticated for this genre - easily as good as a lot of ""real people"" sci-fi you can find in the movies. You'll pinch yourself with some of the breathtaking scenes in this; it's almost unbelievable that these are animations and not human beings! (Think ""The Matrix"" for stop of the slow-motion ""up in the air"" sequences.)

There are several scenes that unfortunately are reminiscent of the early days of anime, and for that (and a few minor plot holes), this movie is a four-star (and a half) effort.

As a sci-fi lover who long ago passed on anime, this is one movie I highly recommend. It literally adds an entirely new dimension to the viewing experience!",1213833600,3,1361,4.803418803418803

The program they used looked a lot like a souped up version of roto-scope.  The story was interesting, Japan being a leader of robotic engineering sealing it's self from the rest of the world for a decade.  A crack squad of commandos enter the country to see how advanced their science in robotics and  mecha has become over that span of time.  Their answers are quite surprising and very shocking.  The animation looked real good but it's not the same old anime to me.  All that CGI was too much for my tastes.

The movie is presented in 16.9 widescreen and it has two soundtracks (English and Japanese) and two sets of sub-titles (Japanese and English).  As usual, the Japanese dialog is much better and tells a complete story with out being dumbed down and filled with hackneyed and cliched dialog.  The DVD has so extras except for some previews of other Funimation shows.

Overall visually it was stunning, nothing less than you would expect from the high tech Japanese animation and the story was very interesting. I won't dissect what the main story was; in a nutshell America gets involved with Japan after ten years of seclusion and secret bio engineering projects are starting to threaten man kind. Humans and robots start to mix forming an eerie combination that has no good ending in sight for anyone. It's up to SWORD members to break into the tightly secured country but even the best plans have meager chances of success as robots try to keep everyone out. The secret that is brewing was chilling and I found the story to be fascinating, I was totally absorbed even thought the movie was long and thrilled that I can add it to my collection.

Look wise everything was seamless and smooth, the fights, the action and some nice surprises looked like little gems crafted on a computer screen by some genius. The music was awesome too, I just wish there was more of it. I loved everything about Vexille and can't wait to watch it again.",1213747200,,1195,4.610328638497653
3335610,4,B0012Z5UM0,"If you're interested in Vexille, there's a pretty good chance you've seen the Appleseed movies.  Unsurprisingly, Vexille share most of their strengths and weakenesses:

Visuals: During action scenes, Vexille looks amazing.  Also, the animation studio's quest to create believable motion capture progresses further than before.  Unfortunately, there are scenes where characters seemed disconnected from seemingly static backgrounds.  Both Appleseed movies looked better in this regard.  And like the Appleseed movies, Vexille begins with the most impressive action scene and culminates in a scene that never quite recaptures the first scene's promise.

Music: Much improved over Appleseed: Ex Machina.  Oakenfold and his house/techno brethren are back in full force here- I could see listening to this soundtrack just like I listen to the soundtrack of the first Appleseed.

Story: Again, an improvement over Ex Machina- Though Vexille doesn't have any previous backstory to build upon, it serves up an interesting and often surprising self-contained story.  Most of the characters don't receive any development, but the sci-fi story on offer here will please those that enjoyed what the first Appleseed had to offer.

3335622,3,B0012Z5UM0,"This is actually a pretty good movie (as recent Anime movies go) and I certainly enjoyed it more than Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within, on which there are several comparative parallels.
The animation and CGI are quite simply amazing, and whereas this may be enough to hold the attention of the intended target audience demographic, the plot was thin at best and meandered more than I would like.
The synopsis is fairly straight forward (and not disimilar from other movies of the genre) where a female agent ""Vexville"" of the title is an sent to Tokyo to investigate illegal robot development banned by the UN of the day, needless to say this is set in a futuristic world.
There are some good action moments and the slant is more toward the horror style of Anime flicks in a ""World going bad"" scenario not unlike the recent live action Resident Evil series of movies.
Another annoyance was the soundtrack. Despite the pedigree of Paul Oakenfold, it seems to have been added as an afterthought to the editing, and throughout most of the picture (as good as it is) doesn't seem to fit well with what's on screen.
I rated it at 3 stars which me seem unduly harsh as it is entertaining in itself and certainly a polished production. It was also nice to see an Anime movie where one doesn't require a ton of information and backstory (or the need to see three prequels) to understand what's going on.

The animation was impressive. Very detailed, very lifelike, although it is pretty much impossible to make people look exactly right but they did a good job. Only one minor quibble, the characters seem to move their limbs and facial features rather slowly, like when they blink or walk, etc. But overall I thought the animation was first-rate.  Another reviewer mentioned the closing of an enormous black gate and that same scene impressed me also, just because of the gorgeous attention to detail.

The sound is excellent.  I watched it on my computer, in stereo through M-Audio speakers (also purchased via Amazon) and was pleasantly surprised at how detailed and clear the soundtrack was, as well as what excellent stereo separation it had.

Some have commented on the dialog being cheesy but I didn't think so. I watched it in the original Japanese language with subtitles.  If you watch any Japanese, or any foreign movie for that matter, that has been dubbed in English, it will sound cheesy no matter what.  You have to watch in the original language to do a film justice.

Plot-wise: read the other reviews and see if it is for you.  Personally, I liked it.  I thought this was a very well done movie and I have no qualms recommending it.  It's put together very well - a first class effort.",1213660800,,1538,4.722846441947565

It's a great movie. It has a great science fiction plot that held my attention completely. I found myself being impressed with the ""stunts"" in the movie even though I knew it was computer generated.

3335625,5,B0012Z5UM0,"Where did this movie come from? I rented it with reserved anticipation because it looked like another generic anime action movie. I had no idea I was about to witness the greatest animated cinematic experience of my entire life.

Over the past few years I've grown fond of Japanese anime action films. My favorites are ""Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children"", ""Appleseed"", ""Karas: The Prophecy and Revelation"", and ""Ghost In the Shell."" Yeah, I also like a lot of the artsy stuff like ""5 Centimeters Per Second"", ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"", and the most of the Studio Ghibli portfolio, but nothing wets my palette like a great anime action movie. And my goodness did ""Vexille"" wet my palette!

In the year 2077, an elite commando unit infiltrates Japan to expose their technological secrets to the world. Character development is weak, but the storyline is excellent, with plenty of engaging scenarios, unexpected surprises, and formidable antagonists. The visuals are outstanding and the score is unorthodox and refreshing. The action scenes are also stunning. Whether it's a mansion infiltration, a high speed motorcycle pursuit, or an escape from enigmatic machina, the choreography, editing, and placement of the virtual camera are all top notch. One 11-minute scene is unquestionably the most nerve-racking and utterly spectacular action/suspense sequence in the history of animated cinema. Nothing comes close to this in the world of anime action. Nothing.

Now, anyone who reads my other comments knows that there are two things that I really hate: Hollywood movies and art-house snobs. Of course, I'm sure that those stuck-up snobs will [...] all over this movie due to the relative lack of character development, but ""Vexille"" thrives so much on the action and storyline that the characters earn our concern because of how they are absorbed within this exceptionally crafted conflict. This is NOT a brainless action movie. The aforementioned 11-minute extravaganza does not exist for eye candy and superficial beauty alone (like most of the scenes in ""FFVII: Advent Children""). It has a significant emotional weight behind it which makes the viewer clench their seat in apprehension for every single second of the entire sequence. I know, I know; the snobs would rather watch a couple kids walk around in a war zone collecting rice for two hours instead of an entertaining action movie. So maybe they should just spare us the ""high and mighty"" routine and not even bother watching this movie to begin with. (God knows they should've skipped ""The Machine Girl."")

One enigmatic complaint I've heard on the web is with regards to the dialogue. Some have claimed it to be ""cheesy"", but I honestly cannot recall more than one or two sentences that apply. (Believe me, I know cheese when I see it.) Most of the dialogue is rather intelligent and there is a noticeable lack of melodrama. Seriously, there are virtually NO eye-rolling moments in this movie, which is a huge positive.

I honestly cannot express in words how awesome ""Vexille"" is. It's almost like I'm in a state of shock or something, because I just can't get this movie out of my head for a split second. Things might change over the course of weeks and subsequent viewings (of which there will be many, I promise you that), but as of this very moment, this film may have just cracked my Top 20 All Time list (live action included).

Just watch it and judge for yourself. And why on earth are theaters showing some stupid kung fu panda tripe instead of this spectacular action film?",1213574400,2,3555,4.966386554621849
3335626,5,B0012Z5UM0,"Went into Vexille on the heels of the disappointing Appleseed Ex Machina and was BLOWN AWAY. Everything about this is top notch; the storyline, while involved, is still easy to follow and very engaging. You care about characters when they die, even the ones with limited screen time. For a standard (read: non HD) disc, the image is fantastic, though I watched it on a PS3 so the upconverting may have helped. The surround sound mix is totally immersive and goes a long way to bring you into the story. The action sequences, while somewhat derivative, are brilliant and very well staged and executed. All of this is served spectacularly well by the music, which is a combination of Oakenfold's signature breakbeat techno and selected songs by other artists, and is never off putting or out of place. Also, the anime style, a blend of cell shaded 2D and CGI, is reminiscent of Appleseed, only a bit more fluid and stylized. The Japanese audio track is solid as to be expected, and to my surprise the English dub is actually very well done. Bonus points for that.

All told, Vexille is a must buy for cyberpunk, sci fi and anime afficionados, and is definitely reference material for your home theatre system.

3335627,4,B0012Z5UM0,"I enjoyed watching Appleseed so I was excited for this sendup and I was not disappointed.  The movie opens up in the future where cars sound electric and people get their work done on hovering keyboards (that looked cool).  Robots are huge in the future, but biometrics is one area that has been outlawed internationally by everybody except Japan.  Japan instead sets up a cloud of secrecy but still keeps a high volume of robotic trade with the world.  Except that one of Japan's most valuable resources are running out and they need a fresh supply -- starting in America.

I was actually quite glued to the screen the entire time.  The storyline was easy to follow and, tho borrowed from many other story lines, still had a lot of originality and good character development.  You can tell when the characters are good when you actually care for their outcome.  And in this movie, despite the high death toll throughout, you are moved when any of the major characters die (don't worry, they don't all die, but quite a few don't make it through).

There was one loose end that doesn't seem to get resolved in the end.  I don't know if it was a dropped plot line or if they had a sequel in mind.  It was pretty big so I suspect that a Vexille II will be following this movie soon enough.

If you are into Sci-Fi I recommend picking this up.  It isn't the best thing out there, but it was worth checking out.",1213574400,2,1406,4.424124513618677

When I found out that the creators of APPLESEED is behind the film VEXILLE, I knew I had to check out VEXILLE. Needless to say the creators of APPLESEED really outdid themselves with VEXILLE.

VEXILLE is named after the heroine of the story. She is a member of a special ops force called S.W.O.R.D. The story takes place in 2077. It has been ten years since Japan had isolated itself from the rest of the world based on an international treaty that limits the use of robotic technology. During a mission, it is revealed that Japan had been developing androids thus leads to a new mission to if this really is the case. Vexille's lover Leon volunteers to lead a team to infiltrate Japan. When Vexille finds out, she manages to get involved in the mission. Of course, the plan quickly goes awry. Leon and his team goes missing, and Vexille ends up in the company of a mysterious woman named Maria and her group of ragtag rebels who wants to put a stop to the corporation responsible for the creation of androids and abuse of bio-technology.

The animation was nothing short of amazing. The animation was quite similiar to the APPLESEED films which is a mix of hand drawn art (or what it looks like)and computer generated images. I found the film to be fast paced and never boring. Paul Oakenfold's techno film score was quite good and really fit the theme of the film.

While Paprika could also be considered science fiction, it is perhaps a less traditional anime story than Vexille.  Vexille deals with the concepts of technology and how robotics and biological evolution may collide in the future.  The story is told simply and the feature is amazingly animated and imaginative.

All I had to hear in order to want this were the two phrases from the box:
1) ""From the Creators of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Appleseed/dp/B00005AX6N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Appleseed</a>""(which is an amazing anime, and one of my favorite series, particularly the later ones)
2) Original Score by Paul Oakenfold

Now in terms of the animation, this looks very similar to newer Appleseed, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Appleseed-Ex-Machina-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0010358D0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Appleseed Ex Machina (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>.  There is the familiar layering of characters, scenery, images and dynamic elements such as weather and debris.  The CG is also masterfully done.  The result is a very surreal looking anime that is amazing to watch in regular definition.  I can only imagine what a high definition cut would look like.

In terms of the score, I don't think I got a good feel for the music after watching this once.  If the score is sold as a separate disk I will probably buy it since I'm an Oakenfold fan.  Still, what I did hear of the music was good.  I'm just not sure all of the tracks made it to the final cut in their intirety.

The story is based upon a variation of a familiar theme, namely that robotics and android technology poses risks for the future.  But there was also some surprising elements, such as a hefty dose of distrust of the Japanese government and a future where Japan is isolated from the world.

I will avoid spoilers (though be warned most others probably won't) because discovering the details of the story is a lot of the pleasure.  Suffice it to say this is kind of an anime blend of Blade Runner, The Matrix, I-Robot and The Andromeda Strain. It's not only eye-catching science fiction, because there is a strong mix of philosophical themes beneath the surface.

If you like science fiction, anime and imaginative cinema, you must see this movie.  You will love it!

3335631,4,B0012Z5UM0,"I used to think anime was just another word for cartoon. With films such as Vexille I have now come to realize, anime is an art form in its own right.
Vexille is a female agent with S.W.O.R.D., a unit of U.S. Navy specialists.
Set in the not-too-distant future, Japan has completely isolated itself from the rest of the world. The U.N. had banned Japan's newest technology advances in human enhancement, in fear of the creation of cyborgs, who would no longer be ""human"". When a body part of an executive of the Daiwa corporation is captured, it becomes apparent that the U.N.'s fear of cybernetic human enhancement is now a reality. S.W.O.R.D. sends a small, covert group of operatives into Japan in order to transmit a signal their computers can decode in order to break down the ""barrier"" Japan has set up around itself. The S.W.O.R.D. team is ambushed before they can complete sending the signal and Vexille is rendered unconscious. When she awakens a couple of days later, she finds herself a ""guest"" of the leader of Japan's resistance movement. Vexille vows to help the resistance take down Daiwa before Daiwa can take over the world.
Vexille is a beautiful film. The graphics are simply stunning. The attention to detail is astounding. Water effects, fire & explosion effects, detailed backgrounds and machinery are all amazing. This is one high quality animation. If there were no ""people"" shown in the film, you might not realize these are actually drawings.
The film features plenty of action and high-tech gadgetry to keep your interest. The story-line is a bit weak and predictable. Still, overall, Vexille is one film that anime enthusiasts will want to watch. It can also make an enthusiast out of a casual anime viewer.",1213228800,2,1735,4.864864864864865
3335642,4,B0012Z5UM0,"I am not one who typically watches Anime movies, but I thought that Vexille sounded like it had a very interesting story.  I also don't typically like the drawing style used in Anime, but the stills on the product page hinted that Vexille would not be garden variety in this regard either.  When the DVD arrived, I found that I had made a good decision in trying something new.  Here's what I thought.

PLOT:  The story is set in 2077 where Japan has adopted a policy of technology enabled complete isolation.  Ten years prior Japan left the UN due to sanctions related to their research and development with androids conducted by the electronics giant, Daiwa.  After Daiwa's enforcer, Saito, leads an assassination of world leaders on US soil, the elite military unit S.W.O.R.D  makes an attempt to capture Saito before he and his team escape.  When that fails, S.W.O.R.D. is sent on an unofficial mission to invade Japan in order to shed some light on the state of Japan's android development.  The mission doesn't go as planned, and the majority of the movie is spent resolving the conflict that ensues.

After the failed mission Vexille, one member of the S.W.O.R.D. Team, encounters a group that is resistant to Daiwa and the Japanese government.  Maria is the leader of this group of rebels who do not support the direction that Daiwa and the government are taking the country.  The question of bioethics drives the plot to its climax and ultimate resolution.

The story moves rather quickly, and I found that I picked up on more details and saw how things fit together better with a second viewing.  The good news was that I found it compelling enough that a second viewing was even more enjoyable than the first.

INFLUENCES:  While I can't make an intelligent comparison to other Anime movies, it did seem to me that there are elements drawn from American Sci-Fi, Fantasy, and Adventure.  The climactic sequence lifts heavily from closing battle at the Death Star in Star Wars Episode IV.  While it is not an exact replica, the similarities are striking.

There is also a scene prior to this where Maria, the leader of the Japanese resistance group, gives a speech that hearkens to that of William Wallace in Brave Heart.

Finally there is a scene involving the closing of a massive gate that took me back to the scene at the Black Gate of Mordor in Return of the King.

CHARACTERS:  There were three compelling characters to me in the movie:  Vexille, Maria, and Saito.  Vexille begins the story with a very strong anti-robot sentiment; however, we see her perspective change based on how the story develops.  She is a strong, fiery character that is easy to root for.  Maria is the calm, cool leader with a slight Han Solo personality.  However she is rational to an extreme and willing to make and take action based on difficult decisions.  Saito is the Darth Vader figure for Daiwa.  Ruthless and self confident, he makes a formidable focal point for the antagonist of the story, Daiwa.

RATING:  Vexille has a PG-13 label, and I think this is a fair rating.  The explicit language is about on par with this year's theatrical release of Speed Racer.  The plot is one that is probably too deep and serious for younger children as well.  However the story provides fairly rich ground for ethical discussions with kids in the middle and high school age range.

CONCLUSION:  There is a lot to like about Vexille.  It has a good story and characters that are strong enough to make multiple viewings enjoyable.  If you like Sci-Fi/Fantasy animation, your odds are good on enjoying Vexille.",1213228800,2,3596,4.747980613893376
3335643,2,B0012Z5UM0,"The first thing to note about this film is that the graphics are (for the most part) pretty incredible and lifelike -- so much so that occasionally I forgot I was watching an animated film.  That does credit to the animators, but can detract a bit from the experience because judged as a live action film Vexille is pretty hokey and melodramatic.  In my experience I can be a lot more forgiving about odd or stilted characters in an animated film because they feel more like a dream that should be considered on its own merits and not compared to other things.  When this film started to feel closer to but not quite like a live action film I couldn't help but compare it to the artificiality and stilted acting that comes up in a lot of ambitious but unsuccessful CGI films.  To their credit, the filmmakers chose to render the characters in a way that wasn't totally lifelike (and avoided the strangeness of a film like Final Fantasy, or, worse, The Polar Express), and that took a little of the edge off, reminding me that the film should be assessed as an anime.

As far as the story goes, there are some intriguing new elements mixed in with ideas from Ghost in the Machine and Appleseed.  According to the story Japan closed its borders due to increasing pressure from other countries to stop developing its android program.  Ten years later they've reached a point where their androids are indistinguishable from humans and are beginning to replace world leaders with their own creations.  A covert US group called SWORD works their way into Japan's borders in order to discover what they are up to -- and it turns out that things have proceeded much further than anyone expected.  One of my favorite elements of the film were the metallic wormlike giants that inhabited the wastelands -- their structure was obviously an homage to the worms in Dune but they were distinctive enough and impressive enough on screen that they felt original.  It is not entirely clear why the filmmakers chose to make this story ultimately one about Vexille, the main character.  I guess you have to have a main character, and it may as well be a tough woman with a soft spot for the lover she fears she is going to lose, but the fact that the film is named after her suggests it is about some profound life discovery that is personal to her.  It really isn't.  The film is mostly about a couple of US military types and some rebellious Japanese trying to stop an insane robotics expert from taking over the world.  The subplot, about Vexille's confused emotions and concern about her lover, who seems to harbor dark secrets or regrets from the past, doesn't really come across very clearly and tends to detract from the primary story when it surfaces.  This film won't be an enduring classic like Akira or Ghost in the Shell or Paprika, but overall I found this to be an enjoyable flick, and one to watch if you are interested in computer animation or like robot or cyberpunk style stories and fun science fiction.",1213142400,3,3003,4.607879924953096
3335644,3,B0012Z5UM0,"""Vexille"" is both the name of the movie and the title character, a woman in SWORD, an elite American naval taskforce who spend most of their time in robotic combat suits on land.  This is the second movie for director Femihiko Sori and he tries to bring in character development primarily via flashbacks which are also used to fill in plot information for the audience.  Vexille's commanding officer, and perhaps her lover as well, is Leon, whose ex, Maria, now leads a resistance force in Japan.  What is there to resist in Japan?  In 2067 the nature, controlled by business giant Daiwa, supposedly isolates itself from the rest of the world over android development.  However, Japan is not really isolated so much as hyper secretive because it is trading it's robots world wide.  By 2077 Japan decides to make a move on the rest of the world and only a secret mission from SWORD can figure it all out.  As I watched this I was impressed with the computer animation though the perfection of the human figures still creeps me out a bit.  However the emotional ties between the characters, especially Vexille and almost anyone else felt forced.  Just because she's female doesn't mean she'll latch on so strongly to anyone; she should have military training to be more professional after all.  The nightmarish world of Japan was well done though it seemed odd that resistance would survive for a decade given what was happening to everyone.  ""Vexille"" isn't a bad movie but it certainly isn't the best movie out of Japan I've seen.",1213142400,,1530,4.757575757575758
3335645,4,B0012Z5UM0,"Before the movie begins you can click on audio setup and choose 5.1 surround in Japanese, or English. Fearing technological superiority and even dangerous entry into robotics, outside forces try to suppress Japan's progress. Japan responds by withdrawing into its own inner shell, where it can develop advanced technologies including android level robotics.
The movie itself is presented using advanced Star Wars like cinematic technologies. I'm not usually into anime, but this is of such a good quality, that movements of the ""actors"" are life like. The sound track and ""cinematography"" are excellent. The anime trade off is that you are losing the real visual actors, but that gives the writers and production designers a license to create scenes that would either be cost prohibitive, or nearly impossible at times, using conventional acting.
Daiwa robotics, the largest corporation in Japan, the creator of the antennae shield, blocking all communications, and radar signals, in and out of Japan, must be penetrated. That is the mission the US envoy is commissioned to achieve. Utilizing the shipping channel, the only port of access in and out of the country is closely monitored and scanned using laser detection. To say they successfully made it through would be an overstatement. The rest of the movie I would have to categorize, suspense, intertwined as an action movie.
All in all I would have to rate this as a good movie. An anime flick packed full of real emotions that is how well this movie is made. I still prefer real  actors, though this is about as close as I can imagine to the real thing.",1213056000,,1610,4.985130111524164

From the creators of Appleseed with an original score by Paul Oakenfold.

2067: Isolation
Japan seals herself off from the eyes of the world in the face of unilateral international policy setting strict limits on the use of robotic technology. The island nation exists only behind the veil of seclusion. No sour shall enter. No soul shall leave.

2077: Revelation
The veil is breached. Japan is infiltrated by agents of the organization S.W.O.R.D., a fighting force operating outside of the protection of the United States and her allies. Their mission: Determine if the Japanese are developing banned robotic bio-technology, forbidden due to its threat to humankind.

MY TAKE ON IT:
- beautiful graphics
- high action
- not overly violent, such as brain pieces splattering in slow-mo, like some anime. I'd rate it PG for the level of violence it did have
- some parts, like the ""Dune"" worms, definitely required a suspension of disbelief
-  when the protagonist find out what Japan's big secret is, I didn't see it coming and found it a nice plot twist
- a bit frustrating that some characters with ""high-tech gear"" sacrifice themselves for nothing against ""low-tech"" bad guys, when all they had to do was use their weapons and armor more effectively. Guess the director wanted them to die for whatever plot device it brought even if it made little sense

OVERALL:
I haven't watched anime in a while but was thoroughly impressed with this new addition to the scene. It was a fun watch and had nice eye-candy in the process. Everyone I've shared it with at work -- from the hardcore anime fan to the casual fan -- have loved it.

It's worth checking out!",1213056000,2,1667,4.811188811188811

We were just about to give up on anime when we got this one.",1212883200,,268,4.702127659574468
3335649,3,B0012Z5UM0,"Although this is a good looking animated movie, it just wasn't up to par as such greats like the most recent blockbusters like the Appleseed movies. As was the storyline as well.

Compared to Appleseed, this movie is Slooooooow!

Good concept, but a snails pace delivery. The payoff at the end wasn't worth the $20 I spent. Even the Final Fantasy movies are much better than this.

What a shame they put such money and talented time in these endeavors, but don't come out with a sci-fi blockbuster.

After purchasing and watching tons of these japanese animae movies,with all their obvious love of robotics and action, I just can't understand how no one has created a Warhammer fully CGI movie. The games and books are obviously huge and popular, but no film feature...?

I'd much rather pay to see that, than this what passed for an OK movie.",1212105600,,843,4.668918918918919
3335650,3,B0012Z5UM0,"Summary
========
I liked where they were trying to go with this one. It is an entertaining experience, but man the plot and the dune worm ripoffs were just awful.

Graphics
========
Graphically this is one of the most impressive things I have seen in computer animation. I can definitely see the Appleseed influence in many of the characters and within the technologies. Everything animates very well with very few instances of ""uncanny valley"".

Sound/Music
===========
Its there. None of it is really memorable, but its servicable. There have definitely been worse soundtracks.

Story
===========
The story keeps moving and never really slows down but the writers choose to steal from some movies in such a way as to be completely cheap and diminishing of their own experience and its unfortunate because they had built an interesting 'universe' full of curiosities that you actually want to examine.",1211414400,,902,5.122448979591836
3335651,4,B0012Z5UM0,"As a fan of Asian cinema, I've often wondered why I haven't reviewed more Japanese anime. Traditional anime has very complex storylines that can put most movies to shame. ""VEXILLE"" (a.k.a. Vexille 2077 Nihon Sakaku, Isolation) is from the same folks responsible for Appleseed and Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C.. Director Fumihiko Sori and writer Haruka Handa's latest is a blend of traditional 2 dimensional animation and 3-D effects that gives us a vision of a futuristic world. People who saw Appleseed may notice the similarities to Masamune Shirow's futuristic designs since they both worked on the 2004 hit animated film.

The story in ""Vexille"" begins as Daiwa Industries leads Japan in technological advancements as an attempt for Imperial Aspirations (recalls Japan in WWII). Daiwa began experimenting in extreme cloning, bio-engineering human tissue to combine with machine parts. Enraged with these experiments, the U.N. orders Japan to cease all activities. In retaliation, Japan sanctions a rule of total isolation from the rest of the world, and the country even goes as far as generating a magnetic force field around its borders.
After 10 years, American intelligence intercepts information that Japan has developed a procedure that can turn humans into cyborgs. A black ops group called ""S.W.O.R.D."" is sent to infiltrate isolated Japan to find the truth of this matter and stop it if necessary. Vexille, one of the commando units sent to Japan soon finds herself the lone survivor who may be able to stop Daiwa with its sinister plans. She hooks up with Maria and her gang of renegades to infiltrate Daiwa. But is Maria more than what she seems? The shocking secret may be more than they bargained for....

I've read that ""Vexille"" wasn't such a huge hit when it came out in Japan. Perhaps, anime fans experienced some ""cyberpunk"" overload because there are quite a lot of features that show a futuristic world with ""mechas"" involved; or maybe because the plot in ""Vexille"" portrays the country as a ""rogue"" government in the world's eyes. I wouldn't know the true reason. But this original work by Sori and Handa seemed too similar to Shirow's past works. It incorporates familiar themes of the usual corporate entity that wants to play God, a strong-willed, gutsy but beautiful heroine, futuristic military weaponry and the premise of man vs. machine or the morality of man and machine. The film may actually be homage to Masamune Shirow.

The animation in ""Vexille"" is kind of a mixed bag. I loved the fact that the characters don't have the usual over-expressive ""bulging"" eyes, odd colored hair and perfect complexion. Vexille and Maria (as well the entire supporting cast) looked almost realistic in their features, it sidestepped the usual anime conventions that we're used to in the past. Their movements are also very fluid and smooth that outshines the motion capture in ""Beowulf"" but comes a lot short of the quality of the fantastic animation in ""Final Fantasy: Advent Children"".  I also found it a bit amusing that Americans looked like they're mixed and still looked a tad Asian. (Not complaining, just stating an observation) Also, I saw this film in its original Japanese language; voice actors Yasuko Matsuyuri as sexy rebel, Maria (This character makes me want to become a cartoon) and Meisa Kuroki as Vexille do a very decent job in expressing emotions.

The film totally looks enchanting with the execution of CGI and traditional cell animation. The effects work by Oxybot is perfect for this type of movie.  ""Vexille"" seems to borrow elements from Ghost in the Shell, Blade Runner and even Dune. (You'll be impressed once you see the ""Jags"") The one fault that the film has, that somewhat lost its effectiveness is the lack of dramatic impact. The story is deep enough to keep experienced viewers interested but the execution seemed a bit lackluster. It opted to settle for the usual histrionics and missed a fantastic opportunity for emotional content by exploring the dramatic repercussions of the film's main premise. Graphics can only carry an animated feature so far.

Overall, I did enjoy ""Vexille"" more than I did ""Appleseed Ex Machina"". I guess I'm so used to Anime with all the dramatic elements explored that I was somewhat disappointed. The film had all the dynamic potential with its deep premise that wasn't fully realized.

8248570,3,B0012Z5UM0,The movie is okay but it's in no way a great movie. The animation is good feels like a nice blend of appleseed and appleseed ex machina. But the story I'm sad to say it had great potential to be great but it by the middle of the film the plot just dragged itself to the finish line. The characters were to heavy on there personal philosophies but they came off very one dimensional. And the voice acting in the film were at many times over the top melodramatic  and at times just bad. Especially in the end when SPOILERS  AHEAD!!!!.... maria and Vexille have only known each other for a very short time and there was not enough screen time for a bond to form with these two. so when Maria dies Vexille screams out her name in such agony that I just didn't buy her pain. It sucks that Maria died but it shouldn't have to been Vexille to try to get sympathy from the audience. That should've been Leon since he was someone who was once in love with Maria and was there to witness her death. It's definitely one of those films that you watch once because the story is so weak there is no desire for repeat viewing. There will be some that will disagree but that's okay you saw something about it that resonates with you and you loved it.,1465084800,,1234,4.22457627118644
