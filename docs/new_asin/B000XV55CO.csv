8229956,4,B000XV55CO,"This video presents material that is applicable and very valuable to the practice of any style of grappling that involves a ground element.  The fluidity of motion and economic transitions will increase the viability of any competitor.  Even the most advanced practitioner will be able to hone their technique by assimilating the movements presented.  Sonnon also does a fine job of explaining the theory behind each skill set as well as it's execution. That being said, the actual demonstrations go by very quickly, so the novice practitioner will have to review each movement many times to become proficient.  Over all, it is an excellent supplement to your grappling regimen if you are willing to put in the time to master the movements.",1360886400,,740,5.040983606557377
8229957,1,B000XV55CO,"I have both the ""Original Grappler""s Toolbox"" in VHS & when i got this ""NEW"" series called ""GRAPPLER'S TOOLBOX REBORN"" I just hoped it was NEVER BORN! The Original was WAY BETTER with it's ""ABC"" Approach. This new one is not as smooth nor is it as comprehensive. I just hoped that he would bring out the ""Original"" in dvd, he believes that he has improved but he did not bring US with him. Better to get the ""Brazilian Body Shape Pack"" or better yet, the Harder To Find ""SOLO GRAPPLING DRILLS"" by JASON SCULLY. Scott Sonnon would blow away the competition ""IF"" he would just bring out the ""Original Grappler's Toolbox"" on DVD, BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO. HE JUST LOST ME.",1340668800,6,667,4.430894308943089
8229958,5,B000XV55CO,"sure, most Aussies will find sonnon a bit of a try-hard....but see past the yank personality uber-hype and listen thru the voice and recognise one of the few legitimate contributors to physical culture in the last 20 years.......if your a grappler this is dinkum 'must-have'....if not, prasara and yang/forward pressure are r-evolutionary....many seem to reduce the dialogue to EITHER ginnastica natural OR sonnon.....false dichotomy....they are a great complementary pair....",1302739200,,476,5.913043478260869
8229959,2,B000XV55CO,I think there is some pretty good material here but for the price there is definitely better videos. Ginastica Natural is the best. You will see  movements on both videos but Ginastica natural has been around much longer and has developed a better routine in my opinion.,1215820800,6,270,4.74468085106383
