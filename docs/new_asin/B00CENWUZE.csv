5719075,5,B00CENWUZE,"The 2012 Doctor Who Christmas Special is finally making its way onto DVD and Blu-Ray on Tuesday, May 28th, 2013, which introduces Jenna-Louise Coleman as the Doctor's new companion, Clara Oswin Oswald, or otherwise known as the Impossible Girl.

After losing his previous companions, Amy Pond and Rory Williams, the Doctor has parked the TARDIS above London in the year 1892. He's still grieving and would prefer to be alone, in which his allies, Vastra, Jenny, and Strax, keep others from seeking his help. That is until a barmaid, Clara Oswin Oswald, accuses him of building a snowman in front of her workplace. He ignores her and instructs Strax to erase her memory with a memory worm, but the snowmen appear out of nowhere.

Clara flees to her other job as a governess to Captain Latimer's children, but she will once again cross paths with the Doctor, who can't quite figure out where he has seen her before. The ghastly snowmen return along with an icy ex-governess, all leading to return of one of the Doctor's oldest enemies, the Great Intelligence.

 Bonus features on the DVD are:

  Clara's White Christmas - Behind-the-scenes of The Snowmen. (3.5 minutes)

  Vastra Investigates - A three-minute prequel to The Snowmen.

  Children in Need Special: The Great Detective - A three-minute prequel to The Snowmen.

Doctor Who is celebrating its 50th anniversary this November, though I have only been aware of the program since 2006 when I watched Series One of the new incarnation on the Sci-Fi Channel (now known as SyFy). I became a fan by the end of the first episode. Since the end of Series Four, the series has aired on BBC America, which isn't offered through my local cable company. Therefore, I have patiently awaited each new DVD release, which I prefer as I can watch the episodes back-to-back.

The Snowmen runs about sixty-minutes and it feels more like a feature film than a television episode. The snowmen special effects look great and at times are a little frightening. Introducing the old enemy, the Great Intelligence, is pure genius, especially with Sir Ian McKellen as the voice. Jenna-Louise Coleman is a perfect as the new companion Clara Oswin Oswald and adds a bit of mystery for the Doctor to unravel. The new TARDIS design looks great as well as the new opening credits. The Snowmen is now my favorite Doctor Who Christmas special. I highly recommend it to others.

Note - I received a free copy in exchange for my honest review.",1369267200,19,2465,4.819477434679335
5719076,5,B00CENWUZE,"In Matt Smith's oeuvre of Doctor Who holiday programming, ""The Snowmen"" challenges ""A Christmas Carol"" for top honors, it's that brilliant. As we near the Doctor's 50th anniversary, expect even more nods to classic Doctor Who, and why not start with this Christmas special? ""The Snowmen"" finds a gutted Doctor wandering the streets of Victorian London in the winter of 1892. Much time has elapsed since he lost the Ponds, but the Doctor's still in mourning, to the extent that he's disengaged from the world, retired from saving it. But then in steps a clever, cheeky tavern wench (Jenna-Louise Coleman) who moonlights occasionally as a prim and proper governess (or is it the other way around?). She may be the only person to wrench the Doctor from his mopey doldrums, just in time to save the planet from a horde of ravenous alien snowmen, and this on Christmas Eve.

The Doctor nowadays prefers his solitude and his wallowing in self-pity, never mind that he's got staunch friends and allies. Awesomely, Steven Moffat dips into the ""A Good Man Goes to War"" arc and reintroduces part of the Doctor's army: the Great Detective herself, Madame Vastra (famous in this period for inspiring the creation of Sherlock Holmes), her faithful human assistant/wife Jenny Flint, and the perplexingly alive (and wonderfully comic) Sontaran Strax. In Victorian England, this concerned trio keep tabs on the morose Doctor, and can I say I wouldn't at all mind a spin-off about them? They're a kickasss ensemble. Check out the two mini-episodes - ""The Great Detective"" and the hilarious ""Vastra Investigates"" - which prequel ""The Snowmen.""

Excerpt from ""Vastra Investigates"" as Jenny and Vastra ride away in a carriage after having solved a case and thoroughly befuddled the Scotland Yard Inspector:

- Jenny Flint: ""He can't sulk in his box forever.""
- Vastra: ""Heartbreak is a burden to us all. Pity a man with two.""

Richard E. Grant plays the icy Dr. Simeon, him what as a child became lackey to the story's Big Bad, a classic adversary (voiced by Ian McKellen) whom the Doctor hadn't faced since his second incarnation back in the 1960s. Speaking of, maybe you'll notice that Matt Smith early on seems to be channeling Patrick Troughton, the second Doctor, even up to his wardrobe. Recall that Troughton first foiled this same enemy back in 1967 in ""The Abominable Snowmen"" (in a remote Himalayan monastery) and the year after that in ""The Web of Fear"" (in the London Underground). I love the callbacks.

Matt Smith is marvelous again. In the episode's first half, he exudes devastating grief and stares that thousand yard stare. It's so satisfying when he finally shakes off his apathy, discards the Troughton duds, and puts on the signature bow tie (bow ties are cool). Jenna-Louise Coleman delights from jump. She generates instant chemistry with Matt Smith, even threatens to outtalk him. I like that her Clara isn't even a little intimidated by the Doctor and has the smarts and the audacity to keep up. Clara is tested several times, once by Madame Vastra and later by the Doctor, and her responses make up some of this special's best moments. Much like Series 5 explored the conundrum of Amelia Pond and that crack in the wall, Series 7 looks to examine the mystery of Clara and her centuries-spanning multiplicity.

""The Snowmen"" is an instant classic. It ranks high for its entertainment value and for the sheer fun of trying to catch the cryptic signposts Moffat had snuck in. There's sorrow in this narrative, but also wonderful humor and the steadfastness of friends. And Coleman's instant spark and show of promise. And those callbacks to musty old episodes. And, of course, the continuing excellence of Matt Smith. Line by line, this may be the most quotable episode ever.

But, oh please, can we put a moratorium on people saying ""Doctor Who?"" all the time? It's not cute anymore.

The DVD's bonus stuff consist of two prequels and a featurette:

- ""Clara's White Christmas"" - Behind-the-scenes footage of the shooting of ""The Snowmen"" (00:03:23)
- ""Vastra Investigates"" - Madame Vestra and Jenny Flint leave a Scotland Yard Inspector extremely flummoxed (00:02:43 minutes)
- ""The Great Detective"" - Vestra, Flint, and Strax attempt to rouse the Doctor's interest with rumors of inclement weather, an alien invasion, and an invisible wife (00:03:23 minutes)",1368835200,17,4364,4.9753086419753085
5719077,5,B00CENWUZE,"[Added later:  The Complete Series 7 will include ""The Snowmen"" PLUS a new commentary track with commentators Michael Pickwoad (production designer) and Paul Spriggs (art director).]

It's 1842 London and a lonely boy builds a snowman. To his surprise, the snowman talks to him. Fifty years later, the boy is now the wealthy Doctor Simeon. He has hired several men to scoop snow into jars in return for food. They deliver the jars to him and ask for their food. Simeon snarls, ""I said I'd feed you. I didn't say who to."" Suddenly, snowmen baring mouths of fangs spring up around the men ... and we only hear the rest.

Meanwhile, Clara Oswald leaves the Rose & Crown where she works as a barmaid. The disinterested Doctor strolls by but refuses to connect. So Clara does the sensible thing, runs after him and jumps into his carriage. Then follows a funny sequence where the Doctor orders Strax to use the memory worm on Clara, to make her forget having met him. Hah!

The next day is Christmas Eve, and Clara leaves for her other job, a total change of scenery, being a governess to Captain Latimer's 2 children. In front of his mansion is a pond where the previous governess drowned a year before. Is that pond making noises?

These plot strings come together and the Doctor is finally shaken out of his lethargy, musing, ""Memory snow. Snow that learns. I hope it is listening to the right people."" Naturally not! What about hungry snow? Snow that snarls?

This 60-minute Matt Smith Christmas Special originally aired December 2012. This is a review of the May 2013 release of the special, by itself, on DVD and Blu-Ray. ""The Snowmen"" is not going to be part of the May release of Series 7 -Part 2. ""The Snowmen"" MAY be part of the Complete Season 7 DVD/Blu-Ray release, but BBC has not said so yet. [Added later, ""The Snowman IS part of the Complete Season 7.]

This is a nicely devious story, very gothic, as it should be when it takes place in Victorian England! Maybe it's just me, but I don't like how the Doctor verbally abuses Strax, though Strax is a good comic touch.

These extras included on ""The Snowmen"" DVD and Blu-Ray releases:

1. ""Clara's White Christmas"" (3.5 minutes) This is a short behind-the-scenes look at the making of ""The Snowmen"". Commentators are Jenna-Louise Coleman (plays Clara), Saul Metzstein (director), Iwan Roberts (location manager), Matt Smith (the Doctor) and Caroline Skinner (executive producer).
This is mostly about the outside location shots, with Bristol used for Victorian London. Jenna-Louise: ""This is another one of my favorite days. You know you have to pinch yourself sometimes, because, like, 'I'm standing on a cloud!' ""
2. ""The Great Detective"" (3 minutes) This is the first of two prequels to ""The Snowmen"".
It's Victorian London and Madam Vastra (a Silurian under a heavy veil), Jenny Flint, and Strax (a Sontaran butler) make up the Paternoster Gang - they investigate mysteries and solve puzzles. Vestra and Jenny keep trying to get the 4th member of the gang interested in investigating, but he (the Doctor in a top hat) just says, ""I've retired.""
3. ""Vastra Investigates"" (3 minutes) This is the second of the two prequels to ""The Snowmen"".
The Paternoster Gang once again helps Scotland Yard catch a miscreant. Then Jenny notices, ""It's starting to snow!""
Vastra: ""But it can't be.""
Jenny: ""Well, it is nearly Christmas.""
Vastra: ""But the clouds?!""
Jenny: ""What about them?""
Vastra: ""There aren't any.""

Everything about this episode is spectacular, from the superb storyline to the zappy comments, it's a very well done episode. The reason this is getting 4 stars is because of the Vastra/Jenny relationship, which is a pity because I really like those characters.

5719180,4,B00CENWUZE,"The franchise has been using the Christmas special to build to the replacement of the actor playing the lead character.  It's paid off in terms of British ratings, notably this past Christmas Day, when the show's latest episode even garnered a respectable audience both in Britain and even on BBC America.

""The Snowmen"" is one of those Christmas specials in-between changes of lead actors, so it lacks the intensity that is inherent in a program that has learned how to build-in changes in the lead role, even to capitalize on them, as a major TV event in its native culture.

Keep in mind that the British like to point out that this is the program that makes small children cower behind the sofa, helpless not to peek out as a parade of outer-space bad guys, from evil, ""Nazi"" pepper pots, to potato-headed ""Nazi"" aliens, to cyber ""Nazi"" storm troopers seek to guarantee the purity of the population of yet another planet, typically by wiping it out, but sometimes via conversion.  (One is never surprised that the pedigree of the program dates back to the 1950s.)  The lead character (calling himself only ""The Doctor"" - hence the title), steps in to save the day, or at least to talk quite a bit and claim credit (in the latest series, typically with a charming female companion).

There are some elements of the program that will likely displease certain segments of the population of the U.S.  Conservative Christians probably won't appreciate those aspects of the show, so be warned if you monitor your children's viewing (no overtly sexual interactions, simply statements.  Looking back, I wonder how much my own parents knew of the content of the books by Asimov and others that I was reading at the time.)  The accent and mannerisms are very British, which some in the U.S. may find to be a little trite, but that may only speak to the power and popularity of British programming in the American media.

All in all, with the cult following this program enjoys, I suspect that these comments are substantially pointless.  Those who are fans of the show will watch it regardless of what a reviewer says.  Those who find the concept of an alien who periodically changes his face and form (thus overcoming otherwise deadly effects) and battles bad guys originally built around World War II archetypes to be too strongly linked to the post-WW II British subconscious will not.",1394668800,,2382,4.797066014669927

This is coming from a guy that grew up in the Tom Baker era of Doctor Who.  I am a fan.  A whovian, if you will.  I've watched most of all the ""classic who"" serials, and have loved all the incarnations of the lovable yet stern Doctor.  Matt brought out the goofy side of the Doctor.  He had extremely large shoes to fill.  Not only following David Tennant, but following a host of the greatest actors to ever step inside the T.A.R.D.I.S.

I'm still not sold 100% on Clara.  Again, another person filling shoes of a long list of great companions.

Now the episode in question.

Great Christmas episode.  I won't spoil it for you.  A lot happens and starts the crazy second half of the seventh and final season of Matt's tenure as the Doctor.  Both Matt and Clara are great.

I can't help that BBC deliberately downsampled this disk to make it look poor in comparison compared to the more expensive BlueRay edition.  I was also dissapointed that this episode, while included in the Series 7 set in the in proper chronological order was not included in the 2 part DVD sets for Series 7.  BBC can be so greedy at times.  The degraded quality may be due to excessive compression from putting to many extras on the disk, but regardless--if you're a real Doctor Who fan and have a high def TV or computer--dont' get this edition--spring for either an HD download or BlueRay copy.  I will eventually have to replace this disk because the quality is so abysmal

This is an important part of the Series 7 story arc and I reccomend watching it in the right chronological order.  It features new characters that will be seen again after Clara comes onboard as the official new Who companion.  It is not an independent story as previous Christmas specials have been.

So to sum it up, poor quality DVD, but excellent story and effects.",1388102400,,1270,4.526315789473684

Still grieving the loss of Amy & Rory he has parked his Tardis, refusing to enter into the earth's affairs until his old buddies,
""Vastra, Jenny, and Strax"" track him down and Clara joins the fray with snowmen that now only come alive, but who consume human flesh. Strax so completely makes this episode with his humorous repartee with the doctor and his desire to blow everything up or shoot it down as his answer to every situation.

The episode is engaging and exciting, the Doctor and Clara have great on-screen chemistry, and Strax is a riot. This episode also sets up Series 7 Part 2 perfectly as it introduces both the primary companion and villain (the Great Intelligence) for the remainder of the series.

The character of Clara begins to be defined in terms of her relationship to The Doctor.  This episode has some loose ends, which are eventually more or less explained in Season Seven, Part Two.  I felt that the function of the snowmen and their connection to the frozen governess could have been better explained, along with how these entities fit into the Great Intelligence's evil scheme,  but on the other hand, the snowmen and the governess were incidental to the development of Clara's and the Doctor's relationship and probably were intended as a plot device to generate the conflict needed to bring her and the Doctor closer together in the face of his initial lack of interest in her.

Not the best Doctor Who episode, but a good one to carry the story line forward to Season Seven, Part Two.  I, for one, am looking forward to the fiftieth anniversary episode in November.",1375056000,,975,4.739644970414201

The new companion is a spunky geek that happens to be a very beautiful girl?! She is what Amy was before she got married, she is Martha and Donna and Rose combined! absolutely love her!
This is one great episode, it has the lighter feel of Christmas' past episodes ( Mary Poppins references) but not enough to become camp ( The Christmas invasion?!)
It has some really cool touches in the story, I don't want to spoil too much of the plot but It was awesome seeing Sherlock Holmes ( even though it wasn't Cumberbatch playing him!) and I totally loved the idea of the ladder to the clouds!

Having said that, and having just finished re-watching Series 7 B, I found this to be a particularly strong episode.  Clara is reintroduced, having no memory of her experiences in Dalek Asylum.  But is it the same Clara?  If so, how can this person keep turning up in the Doctor's life/lives?  It's a question that really bugs the Doctor and isn't answered until the last episode of Series 7 B.  Perhaps they should have titled an episode, ""Clara Who"".

Making a very much welcome appearance is the wonderful trio of Stax, Madam Vesta and Jenny.  Their other appearance in 7B was equally good and I would just love to see a spinoff (similar to Torchwood) regarding their exploits.
