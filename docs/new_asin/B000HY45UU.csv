8142530,4,B000HY45UU,"This is a 29 minute long all-cardio workout from Kathy Smith. It requires no equipment and minimal space (2-3 big steps to each side at the most). There are 4 other people doing the moves along with Kathy.
There is a small warm up and no stretching. The video then moves right along into the cardio section. The workout is broken down into a series of ""low"" moves which morph into ""high"" (jumping) moves and repeat for a set period of time. This is done with things like step knees, regular alternating knees, kickbacks, step heels, step behinds, running in place, skiing, etc. There's also a kickboxing section in the middle of the workout that doesn't really follow the ""low/high"" theme. One of Kathy's friends shows a low impact, beginner modification that doesn't include jumping. After it's all said and done there's about a 2 minute ""cool down."" There's not a lot of stretching, so you may want to stretch afterward.
The moves get slightly tedious upon repeating; however, in Kathy's defense they really aren't done for a long period of time before switching to a new move which saves this video. At the bottom of the screen there's a ""count down"" clock which tells you how much time is left in the (sometimes tedious) series, and what series is coming up next to look forward to. Kathy gets a bit overzealous in some spots with laughing or whooping it up, but that's easily ignorable. The biggest problem I have with the workout is between series there is an occasional loud beep (which sounds exactly like the low battery warning on my smoke detector) that took me forever to figure out where it was coming from. Now that I know it's not a rogue smoke alarm I can easily ignore it...
Overall this is a very solid cardio workout, especially if you're short on time. I give it only 4 stars because of the smoke detector sound, the slight tedium and the lack of proper stretching (which you can obviously do on your own). It's a workout that I keep coming back to when I need cardio in a short period of time and it was a good addition to my (overflowing) workout video collection.",1263859200,7,2086,4.565333333333333
