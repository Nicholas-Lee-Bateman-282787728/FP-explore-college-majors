8654779,5,B00K0242IE,"The instructional choreography for the Praise, Worship, Flags DVD was demonstrated to Lynn Haydens Having Done All CD.  The choreography also works well with other 4:4 time beat music.  The Praise, Patterns/Steps are foundational and can be changed or rearranged in other ways to your unique. I loved the prophetic message of the song, Spread Your Wings and the wonderful formations (militaristic, alignment, drill team and/or marching band style) for Flag Dance II. Get started on your choreography!",1472515200,,500,5.397435897435898

8654785,5,B00K0242IE,"My favorite part of dance class is the second half when you learn and practice choreography to a song. Praise, Worship, & Flag Dances is basically an hour and 15 minutes of my favorite part of dance class! Pastor Lynn takes you step by step through four dances, which you can use in your own dance ministry or you can mix and vary the patterns and moves she gives to create new choreography. This DVD is great for giving you inspiration and new ideas for your dances. I found the two flag dances especially helpful and fun. I did not know how to choreograph a dance with just flags and now I feel better prepared to create something that will bring glory to God with flags.",1407369600,2,673,4.349206349206349
