8235757,5,B000ZKNCAU,"I am new to smoking cigars. So this video was very educational and enlightening as to just how much dedication and art/experience goes into developing and making a cigar - which I find comparable to wine making (though I am not a ""oenophile"" - I can't believe thats a word).  The video quality is excellent as is the content.

If you are an experienced cigar aficionado and you haven't already seen this video I believe you will enjoy this opportunity to share in the experience of growing and creating cigars.",1314316800,,510,4.655555555555556
