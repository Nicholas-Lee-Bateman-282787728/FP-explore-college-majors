Nothing exciting and nothing terrific. Is it scarry ? I guess the trailer is actually scarrier than the movie itself. Is it worth your curiosity ?

1830889,4,B000089ATH,"I found by chance this movie at a video rental store and found out that for me its one of the best made horror movies ever, the story is a bizarre version of a big brother or survivor, where 5 ppl enter on a house in the middle of nowhere being object of an internet live feed 24/7, but theyd never expect the real purposes of the ppl behind the contest, the performances are quite good, the only ""known"" actor is Sean CW Johnson, from Power Rangers series, the rest of the cast does a good work as well, plz do not miss this excelent flick.",1078704000,,541,4.113207547169812
1830890,4,B000089ATH,"My Little Eye is yet another take on the horror of reality television.  The webcast show has simple rules: Five contestants must live in a house for six months to win one million dollars.  If anyone leaves, the group collectively loses. The five contestants are all stereotypes: Good girl Emma (Laura Regan), awkward Dannny (Stephen O'Reilly), sarcastic loner Rex (Kris Lemche), strong and silent Matt (Sean CW Johnson), and hot chick Charlie (Jennifer Sky).  Horror movie fans will be able to pick out the villain right away. This review contains spoilers!

As time progresses the stakes get higher.  The heating system dies in the middle of winter. Strange noises wake the contestants up in the middle of the night. Packages that would normally contain food instead contain bricks, alcohol, and weapons. The Company running the show begins doing its level best to lure the contestants away from the house, all under the watchful eye of cameras that are everywhere - in the bedroom, in the bathroom, inside phones, flashlights, and even pens.

What makes My Little Eye so interesting is that the viewer is part of the experience.  Every scene is shot from one of the video cameras monitoring the show within the movie, so if you see a contestant in the film, that's actually a camera. The intrusive all-seeing shots we take for granted in movies become a creepy means of menacing the protagonists.  By watching the death spiral on the show, the audience becomes a passive participant in what amounts to a snuff film.

My Little Eye makes a feint at being a traditional horror movie, complete with a tale of revenge reaching far back into one contestant's history.  Jaded horror fans will be pleased by My Little Eye's take on such campfire tales: the old ""someone from my past wants to kill me"" is as more about the teller's ego.  Real evil, the film reinforces, is from an uncaring world.

My Little Eye has plenty of flaws. It is as much soft core porn as it is horror, filled with lame jump cuts, random shrieks, and wooden characters. Fortunately, it's saved by the nihilistic conclusion when our self-absorbed heroes discover they're not nearly as popular they hoped. There's no happy ending here the contestants, but then My Little Eye is more about the audience than its subjects.",1292198400,2,2288,4.838461538461538
1830891,4,B000089ATH,"""My Little Eye"" is one of those rare Grade C horror films that managed to transcend an obviously low budget and become something.  One might compare such an unusual event to Troma's ""Combat Shock"", but I think this is a lot better.  A timely commentary on the ludicrous, often bloodthirsty nature of this country's ever more insatiable diet for vicious reality TV shows (""The Biggest Fattest Loser"" immediately comes to mind--why don't people get angry when they see the title of that show, let alone watch it? Or ""The Real World"", which in the 90's was supposed to give the viewer an insight into the lives of ""mature young adults"" and thoroughly embarassed everyone of that generation).  Five young people sign up to spend six months in a creepy house with every aspect of their lives recorded on camera for $1 million dollars.

This is not unrealistic in the slightest, as some reviewers have claimed.  People will do anything for money, particularly college students who get denied degrees because of student loans and are left dangling in the air financially.  If you're in the situation these five are, with the exception of one young man who has a more ""complex"" story and reason for being there, you'd probably do it too.

They are slowly subject to psychological terrorism from the outside, and they don't even know (echoes of Orwell with ""The Company"") who it is they're working for.  The infrared/yellow nightvision is used to terrifying effect, everyone's eyes looking like silver coins.  The revelation of just what is going on and why is enough to make you jump, literally.  This is one of the best horror movies I've seen in years and serves as an excellent commentary on a society that has become increasingly mean spirited and voyeuristic.",1274054400,,1756,4.8624161073825505
1830892,3,B000089ATH,"I have watched innumerable B- and C-horror (no-budget, straight to video, ""backyard"" productions) movies over the last few years. While most are, simply, terrible, there are diamonds in the rough. This one is just that sort. It goes to show what a talented filmmaking team and cast can do with almost no budget. Good camera use, great dialog (especially when compared to others in the genre) and an excellent sense of isolation. Plus, this film benefits greatly from the talented group of actors. While this isn't a slasher or gore flick, it does deliver on being a decent psychological thriller with a touch of the film noir camera work. I'd definitely recommend this one for anyone looking for a good C-movie thriller with a splash of horror thrown in.",1273363200,,754,4.852713178294573

1830894,3,B000089ATH,"My Little Eye (Marc Evans, 2002)

Derivative, and yet somehow gripping, movie. At least, it is until the last ten minutes, when everything goes to hell in a handbasket. I've read Jodi Picoult novels with subtler, more surprising ending plot twists. And it does take a bit of time to really get going. So we'll say the middle seventy-five minutes are well worth watching.

Plot: five twentysomethings are part of a reality webcast: Matt (Forgetting Sarah Marshall's Sean CW Johnson), Rex (Ginger Snaps' Kris Lemche), Danny (Penny Dreadful's Stephen O'Reilly), Emma (Dead Silence's Laura Regan), and Charlie (Shallow Hal's Jennifer Sky). They have to live in a secluded house in the woods in the dead of winter for six months, at which point each of them who hasn't left will get a million bucks. We open a couple of days before the end of the period. Tensions are high, but the end is in sight. Everything is jeopardized by the arrival of a stranger in their midst, Travis Patterson (Bradley Cooper, recently of The Hangover and The Midnight Meat Train). Patterson unwittingly plays on the existing tensions, as well as answering questions from the cast that lead them to believe that things may not be as they seem, including Travis himself.

The original cut of the movie, according to IMDB, was over four hours long, and I'm actually kind of interested to see it; the middle seventy-five minutes are handled well enough that I wonder if they could pull it off. There's a good chance, though, that at least part of the two and a half hours cut are of the interminable setup; the first ten minutes of this movie seem longer than the rest of it.

Oh, and then there is the ending. Every possible bad decision that the scriptwriter could have made is showcased in the final ten minutes of this movie. Imagine the silliest ending you possibly could for this movie. You'll either get it, or you'll get something even scarier. (Or, better, you could just imagine the ending to Ring Around the Rosie grafted onto this ending. It's actually better, which is the most disturbing thing I can think of to say about this.)

I'm still not exactly sure how to rate this. I hated the first ten minutes. I hated the last ten minutes. But the seventy-five in between worked in every way. What can you do with something like that? I give it the gentleman's C, and will let the viewer decide. ***",1248739200,2,2378,4.665871121718377

1830896,3,B000089ATH,"Blair Witch meets Lord of the Flies meets Videodrome meets Big Brother. Phew! quite a hootenanny. The first hour of this movie is more psychosocial study than horror movie. The group of damaged young people living in the isolated house in the hope of sharing a million dollar prize get on each others' nerves, bicker incessantly, and lust unrequitedly. This part of the film is less successful than the final half hour in which the mayhem finally kicks off. It's during the last week of their six-month incarceration that the true reason for their being there is revealed, and during which the nastiness rapidly escalates. The audience's viewpoint alternates between the numerous webcams inside the house, including night vision cameras, and the conventional camera of the film maker. This technique is effective at producing an intimacy and urgency to the drama. Unfortunately the final resolution is something of a letdown. But this is still quite entertaining and should at least moderately satisfy most fans of the genre.",1240272000,,1025,5.1437125748503

1830898,3,B000089ATH,"The idea is ok and the film builds very nicely. Unfortunately, I was expecting some dramatic twists at the end, but there is little of this, with a huge anti climax as the ending. Very very dull and with voyeuristic, pointless sex scenes and a poor budget, by the look of things. You can also see one of the character's eyes move (once their head is cut off), poor editing there. It kept my attention throughout, but I felt disapponted at the end.",1189814400,,447,4.397590361445783
1830899,1,B000089ATH,"The creators of this movie need to just go ahead and stop right now. Just stop it. I haven't seen pacing this bad in a movie since the last Spike Lee directed movie I endured.

This was slow, it was stupid, it had horrible dialogue, and it didn't do what a movie of this genre was supposed to do. The fact that these actors in this movie (especially the two girls) couldn't act their way out of the first day of drama class sure doesn't help any. Kris Lemche who plays his usual weasel-like, unlikeable character is the only person who's remotely believable.

Even when I know a movie will be bad I try to choose ones that at least look like they could have some sort of entertainment factor on some level, whether it's a movie with a very interesting plot (even if it has bad acting), or a nice action movie (even if the dialogue is atrocious), or a nice scary movie (even if the story makes no sense). Take everything in this paragraph that was in parenthesis, and you have this movie.

Absolutely NOTHING even happens in this movie for at least the first 45 minutes. Even then, nothing happens, but *especially not before then. The events that start to unfold later on in the movie don't even matter since no development of the story or characters took place. It's like they totally just wasted 45 minutes of screen time, and then finally said ""let's start wrapping this up now, afterall, we've blown the 'rising action' portion of the film, aren't we at what's called the 'climax,' crap we're gonna have to start getting ready for the 'falling action,' isn't that what you call it?

1830900,3,B000089ATH,"Considering how woefully misconceived his follow-up Trauma was, it's a surprise to find that Marc Evans' debut, My Little Eye, is actually a pretty good and considerable less self-indulgent little horror that puts a relatively new spin on the Old Dark House/Ten Little Indians genre without doing too much new with it. A slasher movie with a Big Brother spin, the first half-hour is almost as tediously underwhelming as any 'reality' show: while it doesn't entirely convince us that these characters have spent nearly six months living on each other's nerves, it does threaten to try our patience. Yet it gradually becomes more interesting as a series of incidents make the ill-matched housemates wonder whether the internet show's producers are trying to scare them out of a million dollar prize or if there's something much more sinister behind the almost impossible to find and curiously unadvertised website... Around the 70-minute mark there are no real surprises, merely efficient execution, and there is one truly insulting moment of oh-there-may-be-a-killer-in-the-house but-I-think-I'll-sit-down-and-play-this-video-game that's-been-conveniently-left-on with-my-back-turned-to-the-whole-room stupidity that lets it down, but even if the ending is predictable it's just a little bit nastier than expected.",1182211200,2,1313,5.87958115183246

1830903,3,B000089ATH,"There is something entrancing about Marc Evans' film ""My Little Eye"".  However, it's not the story.  While I do enjoy its predictable plot twists to the same degree I enjoy watching the same film over and over again (though I know what's about to happen -I'd like to watch them go through it), I find myself caring more about the way it looks than what's going on.

The concept of having the entire film seen through these tiny web-cams was executed beautifully.  No big steadicam shots, no traditional coverage; we can only see what their cameras see at their pace.  So, the reaction shot will be off-time, but that's the fun of seeing it.  The video quality is entrancing and you're watching these people as you would watch an actual webcast -and you don't get to know them... you simply just want to see them interact and there is the reality TV aspect of it: where you want to see them get mad,  have sex, freak out and know you're so completely detached from what's going on that you don't feel threatened.  Hence, my non-affiliation with any of the principal players.  Though Kris Lemche's performance is great to watch and once the hacking scene comes in, he begins to steal the film, acting-wise.

It's a slow starting film and it doesn't get really hands-to-the-armrest-engaging until the last (very eerie) twenty minutes.  Sure, it's re-exploring the stomping ground of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and the ending's blueprint ripped straight from the school of ""Blair Witch"", but in the sake of way their concept is being frighteningly carried out through these security cameras -it is still engaging.  By no means in the way that it provides a pseudo-realism because it's on video -more the fact, that it's hyper-stylized and we are so separated from what's going on that we're perversely wanting to see them get killed off one by one.

I don't applaud it as a completed work; I applaud as a bold experiment that got half of its hypothesis right and the other half wrong.  With the right performances and right structure inside of said visual concept -it could've been a fantastic horror film.  But it's simply eye-candy, and that isn't wrong -it's just what it is.",1118966400,3,2173,4.757333333333333
1830904,4,B000089ATH,"Even though (as many people have mentioned) the beginning of the film was long and uneventful, it seemed like a low/no budget version of big brother. The noise of the zoom on the camera was a distraction from the supposedly frightening scenes leading up to the last night the flatties where in the house and gave me the inclination to cross this one of my good movies list.

However, by the end i had quite a different view, the concept of 'snuff' movies was definetely one that unsettled me, i have been to a lot of sites on this movie that have debated the existance of them...and i stand strongly by their activeness over the internet, especially as a result of the uprising of war in the past few years. Just search 'Ken Bigley' on any P2P program, if you want proof, this sick 'cult' is very much alive and running.

The low budget camera quality seemed to make this concept more real, as i imagine it would be the same home movie equipment used for such 'snuff' movies to be made, im going on examples from plea videos on CNN from overseas here...

The overall effect of the concept i think is one that we cannot catergorise one too far away from us, we are all subjects of the internet in some fashion, and no doubt it is easy to be won over by scams promising money that could seem equal to programs like Big Brother. This movie isn't a far fethced horror that we can watch, have a scream and laugh about later. Snuff is a very real and worrying issue, who knows how complex it is getting.

Conclusion: a very good concept...poorly fell through.",1118620800,3,1553,4.400696864111498
1830905,2,B000089ATH,"The most amazing thing about ""My Little Eye"" is that 23 viewers have already commented on it. Not bad for a weak little movie that received minimal distribution. Even more amazing when you realize anyone with a vacant house and a few aspiring actor buddies could have shot this thing over a long weekend. If you are thinking about watching this movie you could do worse and you could do better. It is just slightly below average.

The concept of a thriller based on a six-month season of ""The Real World"" sounds promising and it actually starts out fairly well. It is a relief to find that none of the five housemates are anywhere near as irritating as Trashelle, Puck, or Mulie.

Unfortunately as things progress the plot holes begin to overshadow the whole concept. Just the idea of waiting almost six months to begin killing off the characters strains all credibility. Apparently the rich clients who are paying for this exercise in torture get some enjoyment from watching six months of mundane ""Real World"" stupidity, then they really get off on witnessing the long-anticipated demise of the cast. A more promising idea would be if the rich clients were people with a past grudge against each cast member who pay contract killers to wipe out their specific enemy as part of a group kill. The screenwriter vaguely hints at this possibility but it is never confirmed so such a scenario was probably not part of the story.

Like ""Blair Witch"" the videography is intentionally horrible because it is supposed to be from ""eye in the sky"" surveillance cameras. Unfortunately they decided that limiting the POV to wide surveillance-type shots would be uninteresting so they quickly destroy the illusion with hand-held tight shots and nervous editing.

If you saw Jennifer Sky in the ""Three Blondes"" episode of Charmed or on Xena you would be hard pressed to identify her in ""My Little Eye"". They actually manage to make her look ""dowdy"" in this movie which was quite an achievement, certainly more difficult than anything else they attempted.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1116892800,,2087,4.834733893557423
1830906,2,B000089ATH,"Dark and twisted, are the best adjectives to describe this horror movie.  It is definitely scary and has a strong creepiness about it. However, it isn't on the same level as 'Scream', 'Halloween', or 'Shallow Grave', although it starts with the promise of being as well done as these horror classics.

There is a 'reality show' nature to it, as it begins with a company putting out an advertisement for a contest in which five people live in an isolated house for six months while being monitored by a plethora of secret cameras and microphones.  All five must stay in the vicinity of the house, and none may call for help, or they lose the million dollars they've been promised at the end of it all.

The director did a great job in creating the right mood and atmosphere for some good thrills and chills, and the idea of the movie is intruiging.  Unfortunately, about 2/3 of the way through, the movie begins to falter and it never recovers in terms of plot of level of suspense or character development and it insteads spirals into a very weird tale that borders into Twilight Zone territory.  The rushed and odd ending makes me think they must have ran out of money at the half-way point of this film.

I'd pass on this one, as it is very disappointing and just plain weird.  It's a shame that what attempts to be a unique experiment eventually fails and goes for shock and sensationalis and tries for an ending that doesn't work.  My Little Eye seems to suffer because someone's couldn't finish the movie creatively and instead cheapens the movie with its attempts to shock and be scary.",1115596800,,1592,4.577464788732394
1830907,3,B000089ATH,"My Little Eye can be sometimes a scary DV movie. Most of the time it is not very scary but some stuff is good. It is a cross between the green night vision ending of The Silence of the Lambs and Big Brother with some dot com thrown in for good measure.

The film is not as good as CABIN FEVER but does have an interesting premise in that it is filmed through video link ups around an old house where Five young people have been chosen to live in for six months, together, for the chance to win 1 million. The catch - no one must leave.

The voyeurism is quite extreme in this film to the point where we see some nasty stuff and some sexy stuff. It takes its time coming but there is a lot of murder towards the end and some twists, but nothing to write home about.

The characters are quite functional, although restricted by the budget (DV film) kinda suites the production well. Some of their backstory comes back to haunt them in little, well very small, surprises.

You could probably make a better film with your friends if you had the right idea but at the same time at least it has some originality to mask most of its ""been there, seen that, bought the t-shirt"" flaws.

It is sort of made like that terrible ""Wendigo"" movie but is heaps better in terms of pace.",1107648000,,1269,4.205761316872428
1830908,1,B000089ATH,"Hi there

 I hired the film 'My Little Eye', by Marc Evans, recently, as I enjoy watching horror films, rented cheaply from the local video store.

 I read a little of the internet reviews of it after watching the film, and agreed with a lot of them.

 I found the film deeply disturbing. The film is quite offensive in its content - less in what actually happens, as in how it is portrayed - it is, perhaps, all the more so with the advent of reality TV.

 I wonder if you could please provide any feedback as to whether other people have found it offensive.

 This is a strong criticism, I'm sure it provided entertainment to some people also - but my assessment of it was pretty sickening.

 I'll keep looking online for any further information I can get on it, it was unacceptable bad taste. It's censorship material, in my view.

 I only hope that the director and producer can sleep at night, because to imagine such things is one thing, but to make a movie of them is something different altogether. I hope they live in safe neighbourhoods - seriously, not in a vindictive sense.

 Thank you for the opportunity to share - I'll keep looking for the official film site - or is that the point, after the snuff movie was so hard to find for the house-mates?

 Regards

1830909,5,B000089ATH,"I began groaning within minutes of starting director Marc Evans's low budget horror film ""My Little Eye."" Why, you ask? Well, it looked, sounded, and generally felt like one of those shot on video disasters routinely released by companies like Sub Rosa. If you have spent even a small amount of time plumbing the depths of zero budget horror films, you know what I am talking about. Sub Rosa distributes the absolute worst movies imaginable, films so terribly awful that any sane viewer of such dreck immediately feels like lobbying Washington for some sort of legalized ban on this sort of stuff. The only saving grace in this situation, and I mean the only one, is occasionally stumbling over something of quality. Such a diamond in the rough might still need some polishing, might not shine as brightly as the viewer would hope, but said diamond is still worth watching. ""My Little Eye"" constitutes such a bright spot. It is hopelessly low budget, painfully so, but all the elements come together in the end to deliver a truly frightening experience that studio films operating with better actors, bigger budgets, and better special effects cannot seem to muster. This one is a winner.

""My Little Eye"" is a story about a group of young adults who sign up to take part in an Internet reality type show requiring them to live in a remote cabin for several months. If even one of them leaves before the year is up, no one wins the one million dollar prize. Lots of web cams adorn the walls and ceilings of the house so people can watch the contestants every move. The cameras can even capture images in the dark, which will come in handy when the scares start to flow. See why I started groaning? The idea of a horror movie based on the Internet evokes memories of ""Feardotcom"" and other bad films. It gets worse, at least initially. All of the characters are cliches: the promiscuous Charlie (Jennifer Sky), the overbearing jerk Rex (Kris Lemche), the sensitive girl Emma (Laura Regan), a guy named Danny (Stephen O'Reilly) whose crush on Emma knows no bounds, and the enigmatic Matt (Sean CW Johnson). If you aren't groaning just reading this, you haven't watched enough horror movies. But something wonderful is about to happen; it just takes awhile to get there. You have to wait patiently through all of the little quarrels, all of the little political games that go on between the various characters, before the horrors begin to emerge with frightening regularity. For example, how interesting is it to watch Rex hoarding cigarettes and other supplies underneath the floorboards in his room? Not very.

Don't worry, though, as things heat up in a hurry. Odd noises in the house start scaring the contestants, and objects left in beds and other places soon turn these individuals against one another. Most frightening of all, the person scaring everyone seems to know exactly how best to deliver the frights; he or she knows dark secrets about the contestants' pasts. By the time a clueless hiker named Travis (Bradley Cooper) shows up at the house, events take on a decidedly sinister tone. Travis claims to know all about computers yet has never heard anything about this particular reality show, a revelation that comes as a huge surprise to our contestants because they learned upon signing on that the game would receive a lot of publicity. Hmmm. One of the contestants soon figures out how to rig up a link to the Internet, and the news isn't good. Extensive searches reveal nothing about their particular game, except for one restricted site that gives a few ominous clues as to what is really going on. No spoilers here, but from this point forward ""My Little Eye"" turns into a bloodbath steeped in nihilism. Nothing is as it seems and no hope for salvation exists.

I can't remember the last time I saw a film this bleak, this utterly downbeat. Most horror films will always give the audience an ""out"" at some point, usually manifesting itself in some good triumphing over a horrible evil that lets us all go home happy campers. Don't expect to feel good when ""My Little Eye"" wraps up--unless you hate the film. I don't think most horror fans will dislike this one, though. It's downright creepy, due in large part to the numerous web cam shots spliced into the film. The nighttime views are especially eerie, with people's eyes looking like silver coins in the unnatural green lighting. As for the actors, they do a good job considering all of them are unrecognizable names. Most of the movie focuses on these people and how they interact with one another, so we come to know them and their quirks quite well--always a good thing in a horror movie. If you can't care about the characters, the viewer is unlikely to feel much of anything when they inevitably perish in horrible ways. There is certainly a time and a place for mindless slaughter in a gorefest, but it's nice to watch a horror movie from time to time that tries to elevate the characters above mere cannon fodder. ""My Little Eye"" accomplishes that.

Extras on the disc include a commentary with director Marc Evans, a commentary track that allows us to ""eavesdrop"" on the people running the game (called ""The Company""), a making of featurette, lengthy (and wisely) deleted scenes, and cast auditions. It's low budget obviousness aside, ""My Little Eye"" is a scary film that hits all the right notes on the way to its horrible denouement. Even better, its effectiveness elevates it far above anything you are likely to see from the likes of Sub Rosa or the other schlock horror outlets.

The director seems to believe that it works better without music (it doesn't) and then tries to spice up the boring deaths and sex with truly dreadful noise. Worst of all is the script, which is cliched and laboured. The only reason I reviewed this is so that no-one else will be , like I was, misled by the glowing reviews and tempted to rent or even but it. Don't.",1101600000,,627,4.367521367521367
1830918,2,B000089ATH,"Decent atmosphere can't mask the improbabilities of MY LITTLE EYE.  This flick starts out decent enough, with some decently creepy visual flair and a commited young cast, but methodically transcends into the usual schlock that produces neither scares nor deep thought.  Some good ideas are put to bad use due to the filmmakers decision to try and twist the plot a few times near the ending which just makes the viewer wonder, ""okay, what's the point?""  One of said twists really stretches the boundaries of the parameters of the plot itself, making the film kind of implode on itself in the end.  There is some talent at work here, for MY LITTLE EYE is not a bad horror movie, nor is it really that good, but with some tweaking of the key elements it could've been a great little independent film.",1099094400,,797,4.631205673758865
1830919,4,B000089ATH,"Word of Caution: Do not read the 1 star review listed lower in the listing called ""My Big Disappointment"" because the reviewer spoils the entire movie in the first 3 sentences without first warning you of this.

OK, now as for this movie goes, I did not find it scary, but I did find that it was a great thriller movie.

5 people signed up online to live in a remote farmhouse for 6 months to win 6 million dollars from an unknown company that is doing a Big Brother spy camera type deal.

The movie takes place within the last week of their stay when things suddenly take a turn for the worse. The contestants believe they are on an Internet competition to stay in this farmhouse for the six months. However, what appears to be a straightforward competition might not be what it seems.

Subtle clues are left throughout this movie for you to figure out what the real point of this competition is.

What makes this movie so thrilling is that these 5 contestants have absolutely no clue where they are which gives a sense of total isolation. Based on the dialog, they were brought into this remote farmhouse by helicopter (probably blind folded). There is absolutely nothing around as far as the eye can see except for a freezing cold snow covered forest.

The gore (and yes there is some) is not too graphic which is fine as I view this movie as an intense thriller rather than a horror movie.

In spite of my 4 star rating, I do have some problems with this film though.

1) If the contestants decide they no longer wish to participate on the show, the first thing I would do is to destroy all the cameras throughout the home. Without the cameras, there is no show. No one does this.

2) Why do these 5 kids accept that this unknown company has the ability to pay them a million dollars? They never actually see any advertisements prior to leaving for the show because they were told the advertisements would begin once they are in the house. The kids accept that this company is loaded because of the money spent of the farmhouse, the food brought in, and the helicopter used to deliver the kids to the farmhouse. But these are sort of after the fact. I think I would expect anyone to do more due diligence prior to embarking on such an adventure.

3) If they suspect something is wrong, then why not apply the principle of safety in numbers. Common sense would imply that all kids would keep close together at all times in one room but this doesn't happen.

4) Once one person realized what he might be involved in while gaining temporary Internet access, why not summon for assistance while he had the opportunity rather than waste valuable time showing the other people what this may or may not be about.

5) Where are the family and friends of these kids? Surely, they would be concerned about what is happening if they see their children or loved ones frightened while watching the web broadcast or worse, afraid if they did not see them on the web broadcast at all.

Despite these 5 short comings, the film is extremely enjoyable.",1095552000,8,3038,4.471971066907776

1830921,1,B000089ATH,"This may very well be the worse movie I've seen in a while. The plot, typical horror movie style, kinda interesting. The acting, not oscar worthy but not completely awful... What was missing was a good script... The character development was non existant. In the in I didn't care if anyone died, I just wanted the movie to be over. The only character that had any substance was a jerk and therefore you didn't like him. I actually found myself rooting for the guy because he was the only one real. Now I won't go into the unusal film shots, cutting back in forth, the night shots. I found those annoying but I understand the 'art' behind them. But the screen writer for this needs to go back to Scriptwriting 101 and reread the section on character development.... I love horror movies, this one is not horrifying in anyway shape or form. Except maybe the writing.",1087257600,,864,4.544871794871795
1830922,2,B000089ATH,"The concept of this very low budget film may not be original, but it's interesting all the same. Five young adults are recruited online to spend six months in a house; if they all remain there the whole time, they each get a million dollars. We know, of course, that it isn't going to be as easy as it sounds.
 The film starts off weakly by leaping straight from the initial premise to the last few days of the six months; presumably nothing much happened during all that time. While we are given enough information that we know why these five people are in a house in an undisclosed remote location, more of an introduction would have made it easier to get into the story --and enabled us to care more about the characters. By starting the movie at the end of their stay,we are watching people who have formed relationships and a group dynamic without having a chance to get to know any of these people. It's like walking in at the middle of a movie --or  watching the last few episodes of a reality show.
The film does manage to create a creepy and claustrophobic atmosphere. It is reminiscent of the The Blair Witch Project (especially some of the camera work, much of it shot in the dark), The Cube (group of people become increasingly paranoid in a mysterious environment), as well as the multitude of ""surviving the night in a haunted house"" type movies. Where My Little Eye is strongest is in the way it creates suspense and a sense of dread in each of the characters. One of the women receives threatening messages that may be from a stalker from her distant past --or it could be the anonymous creators of the web show...or one of the other players.
By the end, the film reverts to standard `B' horror movie gore with only a vague explanation of what it was all about. My Little Eye is not notable for its script or performances, but it definitely  has some scary moments, more than the average horror film with a much larger budget, so fans of that genre probably won't be disappointed.",1085011200,,1996,4.478021978021978
1830923,5,B000089ATH,"Although this little straight to video ditty doesn't look like much based upon its plot and cover design (which is actually a little silly), its quite a bit better than you'd expect...
  The plot (5 young people living in a house for an online ""Big Brother"" type reality show) seems all too familiar, and almost like a rip-off of films like ""The Blair Witch Project,"" but it's actually very enjoyable when it gets going. So, these 5 kids are house bound in this ultra-creepy house in the middle of nowhere and are promised large sums of money if they can live in the house for a set amount of time (5 months maybe?) and no one leaves. The film begins during their last week in the house when things start to go ""bump"" in the night and get a little creepy. Are the creators trying to scare them out of the house so they can keep their money? Or is something truly sinister going on?
  The film's first 2/3s are genuinely chilling...but a little slow pased. If you are expecting a quick moving slasher pick, then this is not the film for you. Patient viewers will be rewarded in full in the films last 1/3. The mysteries that arise throughout the film are revealed and the payoff is quite grand and scary. It's ""Blair Witch"" with better video quality and a much more literal (and on-screen) climax.
  My main complaint with the film is its big ""twist"" ending. Its a little far-fetched and unrealistic. It COULD happen, but its kind of unlikely. Still, a true (and patient) horror fan will surely appreciate this sly little film. In the end, it delivers...and it'll knock your socks off.",1084579200,5,1584,4.520979020979021
1830924,4,B000089ATH,"Several years from now, once we look back on this generation (years 2000-2005) many of us will cringe at the phenomenon of reality TV.  Shows that inexplicably draw top ratings on the basis of absurd concepts and gullible viewership; shows about boring dysfunctional families,manufactured pop stars and plastic surgery makeovers.  Has network television, in all its history, ever stooped so low?  Many people are finally becoming hip to this and are spoofing the whole reality TV phenomenon and its impact on today's culture.  Even better, horror movies like ""My little eye"" are now being made about the potentially devastating effects of taking the reality phenomenon a step too far.
""My Little Eye"" opens with an advertisement posted on a website:
<WANTED: 5 Contestants for reality webcast.  Spend 6 months in a house for $1 million.  If anyone leaves everyone loses!>
The setting is then fast forwarded to 5 months and 3 weeks later.  The contestants now have only one week left to go before hitting their jackpot.  The last 5 and a half months seemed to have gone pretty smoothly however in this last week all hell breaks loose.  The contents of the bi-weekly package deliveries are now becoming increasingly gruesome in nature.  Worse, some of the contents in the packages are exposing flaws to each character that were previously unknown to anyone else.  Someone outside the house is playing sick pranks; or is it one of the 5 contestants?  Some of the contestants want to leave but the others won't allow it.  After all there's a million bucks on the line...
The plot sounds like one of so many straight-to-vid teenie slashers but this movie is not like that.  It's an indie film shot in Canada that relies on clever dialogue and plot development to make up for its limited budget.  If I had to compare it to another film, I would point to ""Cube"", another fantastic Canadian horror film.  It has a similar mood and atmosphere.  The frights begin right away; from the very first moment one of the contestants screams her head off you know you're in for an intense ride.  The house feels warm, serene and has all the amenities of a regular home such as TV, Nintendo, etc. but the weather and the setting lends a certain amount of claustrophobia to the film.  The last week of the contest takes place in the middle of a winter storm.  It's so cold outside that nobody wants to step outside, not even onto the back porch.
One of the more effective scenes takes place around the dinner table when one of the contestants utters a chilling line; ""Statistically you're a lot less likely to be killed by a stranger than by someone you know"".  From then on the viewer is put on alert to not trust any of the central characters.  The only thing that bothered me about this film was the gullibility of the 5 contestants in entering this game.  Shouldn't they have done more research on the legitimacy of this web company?  Had it not ever crossed their mind that this game could have been set up by one of literally thousands of web creeps out there?  I was not bothered however by the sometimes pedestrian nature of the film.  Sure it's sometimes slow and overly talkative but that's the point; it's about a reality show with people sitting around a house, waiting for time to pass and with not much more to do with their time than to discuss what they'll do once they have a million dollars.  This is not meant to be a roller-coaster paced film; it's slowed down so that when the chills come, they're that much more effective.  Although this is not a film that I see standing well to repeat viewings, it is certainly worth a rental for those looking for a refreshing horror experience.",1083628800,2,3683,4.659442724458204

They are seriously the most stereotypical and stupidest characters ever to be seen in a 'horror' film.  I think you can achieve many limitless effects and fear tactics from a voyeur/pseudo-reality related scenario.  However, the director's desperate attempt to evoke the overwhelming sense claustrophia/paranoia fails due a weak, longwinded plot and unintelligent characters.  It film is too formulated and dull.  The ending is rushed compared to the slow pace of the rest of the film.  It is also unbelievable and predictable.  I guess they assumed that if you chuck some boring hollywood teens in it and make them run around clueless and panicky it becomes a big seller.  It'd be scary if you were a 16 year old Big Brother fan.  See 'The Blair Witch Project' or 'Series 7' instead if you're in this whole 'reality/horror' rubbish.",1079481600,,951,4.930817610062893

7980486,3,B000089ATH,"My Little Eye (2002) is an under-the-radar independent flick that is worth watching despite appearing a little dated twelve years after its initial release. The cinematography is good despite some grainy cameras; the acting is adequate overall, and little known actor Kris Lemche is impressive as Rex, the token jerk who drives a lot of the conflict in the film.

The plot is simple: five strangers must live together in a house for six months to win a million dollars. If any contestant leaves, none of them get paid. We don't get to see much of the first 5 months, 28 days. The last three days are the focus of the movie. Things start going wrong; the heat in the house stops working, one character gets a mysterious letter claiming a relative has died, and the group's supplies are not dropped off as scheduled. Events escalate rather quickly, and nothing is as it seems.

Characters in My Little Eye are typical. We have the awkward guy, the easy girl, the goody-two-shoes, the guy who chooses not to reveal any personal details, and, as mentioned previously, the jerk (who also serves as the cynic and the ""smart"" character). As far as the plot is concerned, some of the cliches in My Little Eye likely were not cliches when it came out- while not totally original even in 2002, My Little Eye still preceded Saw and other like-minded films. For that reason, it is difficult for me to be too hard on it for using devices I now considered pretty tired. Still, understanding that does nothing to improve the viewing experience. Fans of the genre aren't going to be surprised by anything here.

Nonetheless, My Little Eye is executed fairly well. The buildup is well done, and it has a twenty minute stretch that gets really intense. The climax, however, leaves something to be desired. In the end, My Little Eye is not ground-breaking in any way, nor is it exceptionally enjoyable, but you could do a lot worse for horror.

7980491,2,B000089ATH,"I spy with my little eye a ""woulda coulda shoulda"" horror movie that established a good foundation and then proceeded to build a shoddy structure on top of it.  The idea of the story is a good one - not particularly original but good - and all of that wasted potential makes My Little Eye quite a disappointment in the end.  The final twenty minutes should have pulsated with suspense and tension - but they didn't, and for a number of reasons.  I don't think I'm alone in saying that I could hardly have cared less about any of the characters.  Some actual character development would no doubt have helped, but I'm not sure anything could make these people at all interesting. By the time something actually happens on the screen (leading up to the inevitably predictable plot twists), it's difficult to care because the mind numbingly boring first hour is one big cinematic anesthetic that prevents you from caring about anything that might or might not happen.

So here's the setup.  Five strangers have landed themselves a spot on a new Internet-based reality show.  All they have to do is spend six months together in a house in order to win a million bucks apiece - but if any one of them should leave, they all lose.  Webcams will monitor their every move the entire time.  Obviously, it's a lot like Big Brother - but even more boring.  They have no clue where they are, but it's a pretty big house for five people; they're in the middle of nowhere, but they can spend as much time outside as they want during the day.  It's really not that demanding of a gig.  After the briefest of introductions, the movie basically starts a week or two before the end of the game.  The three guys and two girls are all getting along okay, wondering how big of celebrities they'll be when they get out even as they question why anyone would pay money to watch them for all this time.  (As far as I'm concerned, no one in their right mind would pay money to watch these people do anything, let alone sit around doing nothing for months.)  With the end now in sight, though, some unusual and increasingly unnerving things begin happening, leaving our characters to question whether or not ""the company"" is trying to make things more interesting or possibly trying to scare or trick them into losing the game - or if they might really be in danger.

It's a good try by director Marc Evans, but this movie lacks any of the excitement and atmosphere (not to mention actual suspense) it needs in order to succeed.  As it is, it's just a cinematic exercise in futility that I will probably have forgotten completely by tomorrow.  This isn't some kind of surprise sleeper hit - it's just a plain old sleeper, period.",1335225600,,2702,4.536082474226804
7980492,3,B000089ATH,"Take a little of ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""The Last Exorcism"", throw in any number of 'prolonged stay in a haunted house' movies, a scene from ""Silence of the Lambs"" and probably scenes from other movies I can't bring to mind and you get ""My Little Eye.""

Here's the scoop. Five people answer an ad to be part of a reality pod cast where they need to spend 6 months in a remote house in the northeast (Delaware?) and they collect one million bucks. But it's all or nothing. If one person walks, they all forfeit the dough. Of course, near the end of their stay, things start going south and all are in peril.

The writing is decent though some of the key scenes could have been more heated. The actors all have a serious number of TV credits under their belts. I've seen Kris Lemche in other projects and Brad Cooper is becoming a household name, but they all do a decent job. The cinematography is interesting. Some shots are from the pod caster's cameras (some of those are in night vision mode) while others are straight up like a regular movie. Some scenes have a genuinely creepy look/feel to them. The scenes unfold at an accelerating pace. Clues are divulged and tension builds. Then more and more and faster and faster until things are ready to pop. Not too much attention is paid to the house itself which is a shame as it looks really cool from the outside. All the other production values are competent.

The point of its nature being highly derivative certainly detracts some from its credibility. One can see the producers trying to derive a formula from the various sources to come up with this amalgam, but the results are, at the very least watchable. I did find myself trying to figure out where things were going and how they would be played. It held my interest and, at the end of the day, that counts for something. With a running time of 1 hour and 39 minutes it stays just long enough to not wear out its welcome.

If you're into this sort of mystery thriller, you could do a lot worse. Order up a pizza, crack open a beer and have at it.",1305504000,,2065,4.383812010443864
