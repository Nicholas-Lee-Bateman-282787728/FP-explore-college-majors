Older 1996 restoration from original nitrate print, still pretty good quality. It would be wonderful to see a modern restoration with an upgraded score, the current music is choppy with segments interlaced with old phonograph recordings.
DVD comes in a 207 page booklet discussing the history of the Red Lantern story, Nazimova, the disc extras and the boxer rebellion with some rare photographs. The extras clock in at 86 minutes and are mostly novelties or scenes of historical interest.
At the end of the day this is worth every penny.",1470182400,,687,4.931034482758621
