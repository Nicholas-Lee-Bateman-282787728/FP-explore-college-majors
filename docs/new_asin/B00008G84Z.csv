7983366,5,B00008G84Z,"Is Gary Busey the greatest actor of his generation? Watch ""Bulletproof"" and judge for yourself. This slice of 1980s cheese deserves to be more widely known, and one could only hope that the new reincarnation of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" knows of its magisterial grandeur. I was frankly blown away with everything about this movie: the script, the direction, the acting, and the special effects will surely keep you on the edge of your seat...where you will be doubled over laughing.

The premise is straightforward: Busey is a retired special operator that has tried to quit government service, but since he's the best (obviously), he gets tapped for one last super-secret adventure, and what a thrill ride it is. The film opens with a bit of light stunt work in which Frank McBain (Busey) jumps into a mob of international arms smugglers and introduces us to his oft-repeated favorite insulting adjective, ""butthorn"". He calls lots of people butthorns and you know what, I think it's a great addition to the English language. There are multiple subplots: he's a lady's man (one conquest says ""You may be bulletproof, but you're not loveproof"" which made me throw up in my mouth a little), there is some military malarkey involving terrorists and special operations in Mexico, and my personal favorite, he surgically removes bullets from his person with forceps and keeps them as mementoes in a glass jar. Before it's over he's up to his 39th bullet extraction.

Because these extremely stereotyped terrorists are in Mexico, the army decides to send in a token special ops team led by a female, Captain Devon Shepard (Darlanne Fluegel) and the most insanely ridiculous tank, the ""Thunderblast"", in screen history. For those of you who think I'm spoiling the plot, I find it difficult to believe you cannot predict exactly where this film is headed. To illustrate my point, I will ask two questions. First, what do you think the chances are that this special ops unit with the hot female commander will be captured within five miles of the Mexican border? Second, what do you think the chances are of said female Captain and McBain formerly being romantically involved are? Of course you know the answers. The government blackmails McBain into going on a rescue mission to Mexico to retrieve Thunderblast and friendly (in one case extremely friendly) personnel from the ""People's Liberation Army"".

Much of the film is told in McBain's flashbacks, of which my favorite occurs as he contemplates the luscious Captain Shepard with a soulful saxophone soundtrack punctuating the scene for mood...only to pan over and reveal McBain is the one playing the saxophone! Bet you didn't see that coming! Of course there are nuns and a priest being held captive, a subplot about selling Thunderblast to the Soviets, and a whole load of scenery chewing by every single character. Please note the tremendous number of utterly preposterous accents here: I really cannot decide whose accent is worst. (Maybe one of the Russians, but it's a tough call.) Obviously McBain has to take on the 80 terrorists by himself and his first task is, you guessed it, to get captured. This is actually pretty hilarious, but nothing can prepare you for his escape. Let's just say it involves a kiss, some of the most awkward romantic banter ever filmed, a hand grenade, and a giant cable spool that serves multiple purposes, one of which is guaranteed to make you laugh out loud. There's a lot of limitless ammo, explosions galore, and some really entertaining special effects.

McBain and Shepard manage to get in the Thunderblast together (where her first order of business is letting her hair down) and hilarity ensues as they try to figure out how to operate it (they do find the coffee maker in short order). There's a plotpoint about setting the church containing the prisoners on fire, but the military comes to the rescue and there is an epic finale concluding with a border crossing like no other.

Clearly ""Bulletproof"" is an ill-advised product of the Cold War '80s, but it is a glorious relic. The acting is unbelievably over-the-top, the script is ponderous, the leads have no chemistry on camera, and the special effects trigger involuntary eye rolling. It is absolutely mandatory viewing for fans of bad movies, laughable '80s cinema, and Gary Busey. Now go get yourself a copy and watch it right now, Butthorn!",1468368000,2,4399,4.94722598105548

7983369,5,B00008G84Z,"Fantastic piece of art. This movie should be preserved by the library of congress for historical sake.
Ninety years from now, our grand-children's grand-children will watch this art and realize that the scene in which Gary Busey, while tied to an enormous wooden spool, rolls to his escape as legions of banditos fire their sub-machine guns in smooth circadian rhythm.
Hollywood insiders have verified that Gary Busey was in contention for best lead actor for this role, but he turned down the nomination.",1417737600,2,505,5.096385542168675
7983370,5,B00008G84Z,"I, for one, really like this movie. The part (SPOILER) where McBain says ""Your worst nightmare butthorn!"" then jumps down from the rafters cracks me up every time. I went and called my dog a butthorn earlier because he wouldn't quit pestering me. It's become a permanent part of my vocab now *gasp* The music at the end (The Butthorn Suite...I kid you not!) has become my theme song. I watched this on Youtube a few days ago and have been obsessing over it since, so I'll be buying a copy now :D Great corny action flick. I'd say it's on par with the old James Bond when it comes to cheesy-ness which makes me all the more fond of it. I am also shocked that I didn't hear of this movie before! Grr mainstream Hollywood!

P.S. Gary Busey is pretty damn hot.",1371772800,4,756,4.286713286713287

7983372,4,B00008G84Z,"It's not the best bad movie I've ever seen, but it's not the worst. It certainly has a ridiculous plot, ridiculous characters, and ridiculous dialogue (e.g. ""butthorn,"" of course). But I was a little thrown off by what I think was an almost-rape scene which was a bit too serious, and that every once in a while, the actors seemed to behave pretty normally. I'd instead suggest ""Sasquatch Hunters"" or ""Death Race 2000"".",1275609600,3,419,4.7534246575342465
7983373,5,B00008G84Z,"This digital video disc will do two things:

1. Completely blow away any other movie you have ever seen in your entire life
2. Introduce the word 'butthorn' into your everyday lexicon

Also, Danny ""Machete"" Trejo makes a guest appearance.",1266969600,12,238,4.925

SPOILER!!

The best part is when Busey is driving the tank!
