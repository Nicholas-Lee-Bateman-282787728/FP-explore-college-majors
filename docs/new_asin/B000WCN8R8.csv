8222623,5,B000WCN8R8,"This was a good show overrall with very good pre-lim fights and awesome main card fights. Definately worth adding to your UFC collection!

Matt Grice Vs. Jason Black
Matt Grice vs Jason Black(21-3) was a very good fight to start off the event and DVD. One of the most exciting fights of the year. This match goes to show how good a fight comes out when a ref doesnt jump in right when a guy falls down. So many times it was close to being stopped but both fighters managed to maintain their composure and bring everything they had. Non stop action and fight of the night!

Jason MacDonald Vs. Yushin Okami
Yushin Okam(22-4) takes on Jason MacDonald(19-9) in a middleweight matchup. Both coming off losses to Rich Franklin wanted to get back on track to the middleweight title. A medium paced fight, neither fighter seemed to reach the pace they wanted and it was a average Okami fight. Okami isn't a very comfortable striker so he likes to take things to the ground, which takes three quarters of a round at times. A average but boring fight.

Ryan Jensen vs. Damian Maia
Jensen(11-3) takes on Brazilian Damian Maia(6-0). This was a good fight while it lasted and ends in the first round!

Josh Burkman Vs. Forrest Petz
Josh Burkman(9-4) never seems to impress me. He faces Forrest Petz in this fight and seemed to gas by the end of the first round. Was a good fight but could have been way better. Burkman has went to the decision with his last 5 fights and he really needs to finish one. Too bad this isn't the one.

Alan Belcher Vs. Kalib Starnes
This was a great fight to start off the main card of the event. Alan Belcher(11-3) and Kalib Starnes(8-2) battle it out for over a round until a stoppage ends the fight due to skull sighting. Watch it to see what i mean. This was a great fight while it lasted.

Eric Schafer Vs. Stephan Bonnar
Stephan Bonnar(11-4) has always been a great fighter but has had some setbacks. Taking on Eric Schafer(7-3) in a Light Heavyweight fight was something to look forward too. It was a great fight and both guys were well matched. Doesnt make it to the judges and ends in awesome fashion.

Jorge Gurgel vs Alvin Robinson
Gurgel(12-3) finally showed us his brilliant BBJ skills....for one round. Alvin Robinson(9-2) put on a good fight with very good skills on the ground against someone like Gurgel. It was a good fight and goes to the judges in a rather disappointing performance by Gurgel.

Tim Sylvia Vs. Brandon Vera
I've always been a big Tim Sylvia fan. He deserves more respect then people give him. Sylvia(24-4) faces the undefeated Brandon Vera(8-1) in a pivotol heavyweight match up with the winner getting the chance to take on Antonio Nogueira for interim title. I actually thought this fight was good. Sylvia followed his game plan perfect and Vera showed his great striking skills during the rounds. Didn't have the ending i expected but I still thought it was a good fight.

Rich Franklin Vs. Anderson Silva
Wow, was i looking forward to this fight! Anderson ""The Spider"" Silva(21-4) takes on Rich Franklin(22-3) in a highly anticipated rematch in what would be one of the biggest fights of Franklin's career. Both fighters showed improvement in all areas during this fight but it ended the way i thought it would. A very exciting fight overrall like all of Silva's and Franklin's fights but I feel bad for the man who lost that night.",1208390400,9,3389,4.606965174129353
8222624,5,B000WCN8R8,I was shocked how easily the ex-champ was beaten.  Silva is a force to be reckoned with.  Video arrived timely and in great shape.,1204416000,,130,4.375
