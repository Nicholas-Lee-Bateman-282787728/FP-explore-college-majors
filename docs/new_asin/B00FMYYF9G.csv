8617045,3,B00FMYYF9G,"As a guy this video and its first part called Diary of A Cheating Woman  are great idea videos that were poorly done.  First mistake....Don't waste film interviewing guys about cheating or why they think women cheat because guys already ask other guys this stuff and why would a guy buy a video labeled Diary of a Cheating Woman to find a bunch of guys talking about their own theory of why women cheat.  Second mistake....the women should've been totally anonymous.  We don't need to know who that woman is but what we need to know and rarely hear is the truth of what motivates a woman to cheat.  Third mistake was the interview approach.  It shouldn't have been a woman asking interview questions but rather a woman police detective who is the cheating woman's best friend who can't wait to hear all about the cheating because that's what the male viewers and buyers want to hear the friend to friend this is how I truly feel girl talk about cheating.  Now do a third video in that fashion and you will have a good research video material.  Speaking of women infidelity research, I'm doing my own personal research on the subject and I've found personal confession books to be the best.  Books where the female author lets the cheating woman tell her story with ease and comfort.  From their stories I read between the lines and look for clues and patterns.  I've listed a few of these very helpful book and sources in another amazon review I wrote for the book called  Womens Infidelity 2 by Michelle Langley.  I don't want to include the other helpful resources in this review because then it would make the review super long. In the Diary of a Cheating Woman I felt like the women were holding back.  There was some casual mention of selfishness and I heard the word narcissism one time in the first video by a therapist.  In the second video one woman hints at the possibility of women cheating with other women because they gave them emotional support and were vulnerable at the time.  Then in the second video there was talk about men not going around cheating so women won't cheat on them and also talk about how marriage would make a woman less likely to cheat.  There was also talk in the second video about women being better cheaters than men because they are more careful and detailed.  Then many women in the videos said that women cheat because they don't have the emotional bond that they use to have.  If I hadn't done research before these videos I might have agreed to those answers but not no more.  In short women today are selfish and narcissistic.  Taboo sex and narcissism go together.  This is why female teachers are sleeping with their students, this is why many women have had bisexual experiences already, this is why cheating gives them a thrill and marriage only increases that thrill for a narcissist.  They might try to have their cake and eat it too by having a great father aka spoils the kids like they expect the kids to be spoiled but the wife will have LOVERS on the side.  That's also another universally truth.  Every cheating woman calls the person they're cheating with their LOVER and not their FWB of F buddy but Lover.  Why?  I feel that Lover protects the woman from feeling guilty or foolish, which sounds better I risked my marriage and relationship for a F buddy or FWB or my Lover.  In reality a FWB would have better morals than a man cheating with another mans woman.  A FWB or F buddy would have more trust ability compared to a Lover who is often in a relationship too and cheating themselves.  Avoiding guilt and protecting their ego is very important to a narcissist. In the video a man said she caught the woman cheating on him red handed and she attacked him so to protect her ego from feeling guilt.  Is this why women are never wrong in arguments because their pride and ego will not allow them to be wrong?  Is this why good guys are dumped because they make the female narcissist feel guilty where the bad boy narcissist that takes and takes attacks their egos and thus the women cant let go?  Also its a woman's world regardless of what the matrix tells you.  A Lover doesn't want the husband or boyfriend drama so he is not going to put pressure on the woman to confess the affair versus when a man cheats with another woman, after time in the relationship she wants to be the wife and have it all.  Remember women cheat up for financial reasons so she starts to trip and leave tell tale signs around for the girlfriend or wife to find.  So this could be a major factor of why women cheat better or get away with it more often.  And a narcissist only love themselves and no one else so it would be foolish to think they get attached emotionally in relationships, they just settle until they can cheat up.  They will ride a new relationship as long as it make them feel good inside and once that feeling fades away and it will after some time has passed then they will sabotage the relationship with hostile attitude and lame excuses to protect their ego from guilt and cheat and find another man first before ending their current relationship.",1497139200,,5110,4.496208017334778
