8738940,4,B017EOYW9Y,"All good things must come to an end, and that applies to geeky Britcoms about IT nerds dwelling in the basement of a corporation that makes that product that they make. And so it is for ""The IT Crowd Version 5.0: The Internet Is Coming,"" the series finale to the wildly underrated nerd comedy -- and while it's basically a somewhat long episode, it does wrap up the series in a clever and fairly satisfying manner, while also giving the fans some fun farewell material.

In this particular episode:
*After Jen (Katherine Parkinson) and Roy (Chris O'Dowd) pan his Internet review show, Moss (Richard Ayoade) has a crisis of confidence. But then Douglas (Matt Berry) reveals his shocking secret for being more confident, and Moss suddenly has the cojones to do whatever he wants.
*Roy's new girlfriend -- who thinks he's on the autism spectrum -- wants him to come to her grandfather's funeral, so he feels pressure to cry.
*Douglas goes on ""Secret Millionaire,"" but ends up getting in trouble wth the police.
*A viral video catches Jen accidentally throwing coffee on a homeless woman, and Roy berating a tiny barista who is then hit by a truck with breasts on it. To make matters worse, Jen tries to defend herself on social media, but only attracts the attention of Anonymous.

For the most part, ""The Internet is Coming"" is basically just a double-length episode of the series, with the sort of wild social awkwardness and  problematic situations that you'd expect. But after the halfway mark, this finale does get that ""final episode"" flavor, with Douglas stating his intention to fire the IT staff when he returns from his outing, and Roy even noting that the last four seasons have contained some rather bizarre occurrences. Hello, fourth wall. I must break you.

But along the way, we have the kind of delightful social awkwardness and self-complicating disasters that the show is known for (Roy's attempts to woo back his girlfriend coincides with a disastrous project meeting), as well as some fun stuff that fans will want to see one more time before the end (the newly-regothed Richmond, the ""Internet"" box that Jen still thinks is a real thing). In fact, it's initially written as if it were one of the usual episodes, but slightly fleshed-out and given a proper wrap-up rather than just leaving the characters sunk in the quicksand of their own bad luck.

Downside? Well, the whole subplot about Jen being attracted to the Spanish barista... kind of goes nowhere. It's treated as if it will be significant at first, but he simply fades out after the viral video comes up, which is a little odd since Jen's romantic relationships usually provide plenty of comic fodder.

And the well-oiled machine of the cast works, each revolving around a different kind of cluelessness. O'Dowd and Ayoade are typically delightful as the perpetually awkward nerds, one of whom discovers he's a wee bit insensitive to others (no, really?!) and the other of whom suddenly gains great confidence. Parkinson (who looks a bit odd here) is also quite good as a woman who doesn't realize that in a way, she's just as bizarre and out-of-touch as her nerd compatriots, while Berry revels in his role as the debauched millionaire who doesn't even try to censor himself (""Ah, so it's women you hate! Well, that I can understand"").

""The It Crowd Version 5.0: The Internet Is Coming"" has a few things that are left in the ether, but overall it's a satisfying finale to a thoroughly entertaining TV show. Just remember: The Internet is coming, and it's not a little black box.",1478995200,,3559,4.81505728314239
