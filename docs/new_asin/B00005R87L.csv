1655226,5,B00005R87L,A comedy whodunit with a ghost tossed in. This genre mix was a specialty of the 40's and this is an excellent one with a star or two and great character actors like Billie Burke and Donald McBride. Don't miss it.,1496102400,,212,4.195121951219512

1655251,5,B00005R87L,"This is one of the most enjoyable films I've seen. Sometimes you just like to sit back for about 90 minutes, laugh a little or a lot, and put your mind in neutral. I had one of those days yesterday. Some of the things mentioned are dated. I still don't know what the ""Pot of Gold"" program is that Joan Blondell mentions. But there are enough laughs in this film to make it enjoyable. I must have watched this movie at least a dozen times. It's still good to me. I wish Amazon Instant Video would put the first ""Topper"" movie up with Cary Grant. Never saw it but after seeing this one I would like to.

Again, if you would simply like to enjoy about 90 minutes and have some laughs then please have a watch. I think you would like it.",1483574400,,733,4.125874125874126

Ann and Gail are set up in guest rooms upstairs but end up trading rooms. The killer ends up killing the wrong girl. Now a ghost, Gail appears to Topper for help in solving her own murder.  Of course confusion ensues when Topper's wife (Billie Burke) suspects him of cheating. Topper is caught sneaking into the Carrington mansion. Nobody believes his claims of murder as there is no body. The police are called in and more confusion and hilarity ensue until the true murderer is revealed. Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson puts in a great comic performance as the chauffer.

1655329,4,B00005R87L,"This is a fun film to watch. I saw the original Topper years ago that featured Cary Grant and Constance Bennett.  While that was a delightful film this was also entertaining.  My friend who watched it with me, is unfamiliar with classic films and thought for it's era had good technology and was less of a theatrical film.  He saw the two main female leads - Carol Landis as the perfect daughter and her friend Joan Blondel who more of a voice of reason or asking questions that the audience might answer.

Being a fan of classic movies, there is definitely ""inside"" jokes that the casual viewer might not understand. For example, Topper's black chauffeur named Eddie quipped about being Benny.  This actor was very well known as being Jack Benny's side kick on his Radio show that was super popular at that time and the actor was well known  in his characters as Rochester.

Pleasant film to watch with a few twists and turns...",1468108800,,929,4.593939393939394

It is a comedy and it will make you laugh out loud. All the actors do a good job, but it is Roland Young, Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson, and Joan Blondell that truly make this a great move. The car chase at the end of the move is the same as in the movie, ""The Body Disappears"". If you don't have that one it is funnier than this one. One of the stars that steals the show in The Body Disappears is the funniest of them all, Willie Best. In ""Topper Returns"" Rochester plays the same part  Best plays in The Body Disappears.

The reason I gave it four stars is sometimes it seemed to get a little fuzzy is the best word I can find to describe it. The sound is good and the closed captions are great but the picture definitely needs to be remastered I guess is what they call it.
This is just my opinion. Someone else may say my review isn't a good one but that will just be their opinion.
If you are afraid of wasting money on this oldie but goodie, then rent it first off of Amazon before buying it so you can judge the quality of the movie for yourself.

1655363,5,B00005R87L,"One of my favorite television shows as a child in the 1950s was ""Topper"". I enjoyed the comedy in that series, specifically the ultra hip attitudes of the young American ghosts as contrasted with the ultra polite and proper mannerism of the middle-aged English homeowner, who was Topper himself. But the present movie very different. It is a comedy in that everything ends well, but it is filled with spite and murder and all the gothic aspects that you you expect from any ghost story. The film brought me back to an era before my own birth -- to the pre-World-War-II years. The brash and fun-loving middle-class is seen in contrast with the stogy moneyed class, the pursuit of truth against the keeping up of appearances and somehow Topper himself, with different ghosts and in difficult circumstances, comes out as that unassuming, honest, just man. This goes beyond being proper, and it is what endears the character to the audience.",1443139200,,937,4.8625

So, unsurprisingly, this movie is cinematic heaven for me! If you're looking for a serious, thought-provoking film, this probably won't satisfy you. But if you're looking for more sheer fun and entertainment than the vast majority of today's films offer, witty and quotable dialogue, top notch acting and a surprisingly creative and comforting take on death and ghosts, then I really cannot recommend this one highly enough!",1438819200,,607,5.268041237113402

1655389,5,B00005R87L,"Joan Blondell, Roland Young, and Billie Burke shine in this serious and yet funny murder movie.  Patsy Kelly adds her talent too.  The understated portrayal of Topper by Roland Young makes him my favorite Topper.  He has such funny trouble keeping the ghost (Blondell)  from his wife (Burke).  He has a lot of explaining to do when the body disappears. The scene between wife and Topper is fascinating for the offset dialogue.  Topper is talking out loud and wife takes his words as answers to her questions..  Perfect example of apples and oranges that block communications.  She goes off in a huff, misunderstanding all.  Too funny.  Joan Blondell is perfect as the ghost. Her energy and quick wit bring out the funny in the movie.  Stern, even threatening, demeanor of the actors who run the house  contrasts with the flighty Billie Burke  character, the patient Topper, the bumbling inspector,  the energetic Blondell performance.  Tis a charming movie from yesteryear. Wonder how they did the ghostly fade in and out. No digital then.  They don't make movies like this anymore.

Blondell is mistakenly murdered after she and Landis (who was the intended target of the murderer) switch bedrooms in a spooky old mansion complete with secret passages, a strange maid and butler and a masked cloak and dagger murderer. As Blondell's dead body lies on the floor, her spirit exits her body as a ghost and she proceeds to the home of Mr. & Mrs. Cosmo Topper (Roland Young and Billie Burke) where she enlists the help of Topper to try and solve her murder. This film has a great supporting cast including Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson who is absolutely hilarious as Topper's chauffer; Billie Burke is wonderful as Mrs. Cosmo Topper and Donald MacBride is very funny playing the part of Sgt.

As in most other series, the later entries, like TOPPER RETURNS, lack the charm of the original. And today it is amusing to think that the film was nominated for the Academy Award for Special Effects.

The original TOPPER story (and the television series) featured Marion and George Kirby as the ghosts. They are not part of TOPPER RETURNS, but the cast led by Roland Young, Billie Burke, Joan Blondell, and Carol Landis make the movie great fun.

1655467,5,B00005R87L,"Topper Returns has always been one of my absolute favorite film comedies.  I can recall this film being part of the Saturday Matinee movies that always seem to pop up at  the local theater, The Elgin, located in the Chelsea section of Manhattan.  most  memories come  from summer showings in the playground at 17th Street also in Chelsea.  the films were shown on the  handball court as a NYC summer treat.  I could see the handball court from my bedroom window, so Topper Returns became a part of my childhood memories.

the film was a comedy mystery that saw poor Cosmo Topper (Roland Young)  bedeviled by a  female spirit (Joan Blondell) intent on finding out  who killed her and at the same time protect her friend (Carol Landis) the real target of the  caped and masked killer.

the cast includes Billy Burke as Mrs Topper. who changed from the  first Topper  film  from a fairly intelligent woman to a complete ditz in this one.  Dennis O'Keefe as a heroic cab driver. George Zucco as a fairly sinister doctor, HB Warner as the invalid father of  Carol Landis.  the rest of the cast is comedic with Patsy Kelly as  the Topper's maid, Eddie (Rochester) Anderson as the Topper's driver who keeps wishing he could go back to MR (Jack) Benny and the master of the slow burn, Donald McBride as the policeman, who seems unable to find his  shoes, unless he's given a hot foot.  there's also a playful seal who keeps Eddie Anderson in the drink.

while  there are references to films and radio shows of the 1930s, the film is still very funny and quite enjoyable with many scenes that may be  considered foolish, but  you have to  laugh a lot,  because you're not digging  the scene apart.  just  enjoy it.",1375142400,,1705,4.543046357615894

1655484,3,B00005R87L,"Topper Returns, 1941 film

The movie begins with the mysterious shadow of a man against a background. Next this man shoots at the tire of a taxi cab on the road, causing it to crash. The two women passengers climb out. ""As easy as falling off a log."" A passing car takes them to Carrington Hall, a spooky house that is quite large inside. The Doctor talks to Miss Carrington. Ann Carrington will inherit the entire estate tomorrow. A falling chandelier just misses Ann! An accident? ""Rest in peace""? Ann and Gail switch bedrooms. Later the mysterious stranger sneaks in to Gail's room. We hear her scream. Is that a ghost? There are comic scenes at Cosmo Topper's house. The ghost appears to Cosmo; why did she die? Topper will go to Carrington Hall with Gail's ghost. [The special effects echo ""The Invisible Man"".]

Cosmo is discovered trying to use the phone to call the police. What happened to the body? Or the car? The taxi cab driver shows up to claim his fare. That mystery man shows up to threaten Ann. The household is awakened. More comic scenes follow. Where is Topper now? A walk-in icebox? The conversation is funny. A seal in the basement? Who are those three men with a stiff body? The fight among the seamen is like a Three Stooges movie. Nobody went out that door! The housekeeper is ready to name the killer. The lights go out with a scream! Will the mystery man show up to kidnap Ann? Will the taxi driver find the secret passage in the house? Topper figures out a way to reveal the murderer. Everyone gathers in the big room to listen to Topper's explanation. One witness tells who was standing near the fireplace, and the murderer is revealed. Can he escape? Not if his car cracks up. ""It serves you right!"" We finally learn the truth. ""Enough is enough.""

Can combining a murder mystery with a comedy create a better product than either a murder mystery (""The Maltese Falcon"") or a comedy alone? Not with this movie, although it is entertaining (as long as you don't question its premises). It does not mention the smuggling operation going on in this isolated house. Stories about ""ghosts"" should keep nosy people away, and explain any mysterious events in the night. [Does this film echo the ""Rocky Mountain Mystery""?]",1296172800,,2243,4.630653266331659
1655485,5,B00005R87L,"I love the case , it is in better shape then I expected and the dvd plays great.",1264636800,,80,3.5
1655486,4,B00005R87L,"This is the third movie in the Topper series but without the charm of Cary Grant. Sexy, wise-cracking Gail Richards (Joan Blondell) accompanies her best friend Ann Carrington (Carole Landis) to see Ann's ailing father at his mansion. During her stay at the creepy mansion, she is found murdered after trading her bedroom with Ann, who was the intended target of the killer. In the tradition of Topper movies, Gail's ghost comes back and she persuades the sweet and caring Cosmo Topper (Roland Young) who had given the ladies a lift earlier, to help identify the masked killer. The madcap adventure begins with one after another, following up leads to her murderer. The real hoot is that Eddie the chauffeur (Eddie Anderson) see's ""strange things"" for which there are no clear explanations; doors opening and closing by themselves, people talking to nothing and getting answers, extra sets of footprints in freshly fallen snow he can't figure out. The house is crowded with other members of the household. Besides Ann, her father Henry Carrington (H.B. Warner), Clara Topper (Billie Burke), Emily, the Topper maid (Patsy Kelly), Dr. Jeris (George Zucco), a dumb cop (flustered Donald MacBride), and housekeeper Lillian (Rafaela Ottiano) provide a good deal of ""creepy"" feeling to lighten of your Halloween experience. It is all in good fun and no serious scary moment of course. Finally the identity of the killer is revealed. It is worth watching the movie to find out the identity of the masked killer!

My favorite scenes are: When Topper gives the two ladies (and their suitcases) ride in his small car, while Gail sits comfortably on his lap, and Clara Topper watching from her window who gets real furious. Another moment is when Eddie, the chauffeur keeps falling repeatedly through a hole in the ground to the riverbed beneath the house, and then being persistently kept from re-emerging by a playful seal!

This is one of Joan Blondell's best movies, but she did not get many opportunities to make ""big successful"" movies like Billie Burke and other famous actresses, but she had the opportunity to be immortalized at the Grumman Chinese theater in Hollywood with her feet and handprints (1937).

If it ever get slow Billie Burke ( good witch of the north in Wizzard of oz) livens it up even better then Mrs. Howell did in Gilligans Island. Her comic often comes up as genius, and occasionaly brightens the movie just when it needs it. She wasn't used enough in comedies if you ask me.

  A few hidden doors and passage ways make for curious and bordering on scary moments. It has Rochester and an inside joke to his ""former boss"". some excess in the Seal scene. The boat offshore makes no sence and is never explained.
  Still it's a pretty fair comic mystery movie too and who can guess the real villian?
  But it's a fun yarn with a few cuties and reluctant heroes to enjoy.
  Though some similarities to the ""Thin Man"" exist, it's far more light.

One review I read for this movie said it was the perfect rainy day movie.  To that I agree.  I remember the first time I saw this movie, it was pouring down rain and I remember Tom Hatten giving the introduction to it on the ""Family Film Festival"", a Los Angeles TV show every weekend back in the 1980's.

Cosmo Topper (Young) picks up two women (Blondell and Landis) whose taxi has broken down and takes them to their destination, an old mansion on a hill.  Later that night one of the women is murdered and her ghost finds Topper once again, drags him and his chauffer (Rochester) back to the mansion to find the murderer.  This intimate gathering becomes large as Topper's wife (Burke) and maid follow shortly thereafter.  Also joining the party is the taxi cab driver that had broken down, along with the household of the rich old man, his doctor (Zucco), maid and butler.  Oh, did I forget the police chief and officers?  Even with this somewhat large staff the movie is easy to follow, they all interact well, and everyone gets in some jokes.

The only disappointing thing about this DVD is that there are no, and I mean NO extras or special features.

1655496,5,B00005R87L,"A great cast and the perfect blend of humor and mystery make this entry in the series based on Thorne Smith's characters one of the very best. Roy Del Ruth's direction and a better than average screenplay by Jonathan Latimer and Gordon Douglas, and an added bit of dialog from Paul Gerard Smith make this one a lot of fun.

Lovely Carole Landis is Ann Carrington, traveling to see her very ill father with her good pal Gail Richards (Joan Blondell). A sniper shoots out the tire on their cab and the girls are stranded until Topper and his driver Eddie (Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson) happen by and before you know it, and with reservations by Eddie, they are dropping off the two at the old haunted Carrington Castle. Cosmo (Roland Young) may think the only trouble he is in is from his wife (Billie Burke) but events will soon occur which will make that problem pale by comparison.

It is obvious right away that someone wants Ann out of the way when a chandelier mysteriously falls from the ceiling and just misses its target. Landis is terrific as the soon-to-be wealthy Ann and Blondell shines as her wise-cracking friend fond of nice things. Gail's penchant for luxury will be her undoing when Ann switches rooms with her friend so she can have the swanky one.

Gail is murdered in the night and her ghost wants to know why. She walks on moonlit clouds to Topper's house and, once again, Cosmo is having trouble with the netherworld. He's also having trouble with Eddie, who sleeps in a full-length fur coat and wants nothing to do with spooks!

Rochester nearly steals the film from Blondell and Young at this point. His reactions to Topper's interaction with someone he can't see, followed by the discovery of the body, which soon disappears, has Eddie running back home to pack. His line about going back to Mr. Benny is an endearing reference for fans of old radio.

Bille Burke has some hilarious moments when she comes to help Topper. Her conversation with the detective is priceless. Landis' Ann has some nice moments also as a love interest develops with the cab driver. Blondell is great, of course, and Young does a nice job of being frustrated as usual.

When Eddie has a confrontation with a seal and sees the missing body being taken to sea in an underground cavern just beneath the house, he and Cosmo and Gail aren't too far from solving the mystery.

There is a fine ending to this fun and atmospheric mystery with a lot of humor. Landis and Blondell look great in gowns by Royer but get to show off their talent as well here. This is a topflight production with the easy likability of a good ""B"" film but the classy surroundings of an ""A"" film. An excellent time at the movies.",1147996800,,2697,4.571428571428571
1655497,5,B00005R87L,"Your whole family should enjoy this hysterically funny suspense/comedy that stars Topper and a blonde ghost. Hal Roach lavished this l941 production with opulent sets--especially that enormous mansion where all the action takes place--and a dazzling cast of comedians and supporting actors. Joan Blondell plays the curaveous ghost who wants Roland Young (Topper) to help find the villain who killed her. Billie Burke is in top form as the ditzy, screaming Mrs. Topper. But its Rochester who steals all of his scenes with his double-takes and priceless one-liners. Patsy Kelly is terrific as Mrs. Topper's long-suffering maid. ""Topper Returns"" is that rare example where the third episode of a series is ten times better than the original ""Topper"" (1937. You can't go wrong with this comedy to watch with your family or laugh like a hyena alone in your own home.",1120521600,,861,5.113475177304965
1655498,5,B00005R87L,"One of the greatest screen personalities of the 1930s, Joan Blondell found herself being edged out of films by the decade's end.  Soon she would be reduced to playing the Shelley Winters parts before Shelley Winters found her niche, and then actually competing with Shelley Winters for the same roles, which must have been terribly frustrating for a talented actress like Blondell.  Here she is and you can just see a hint of desperation as she ""jumps the shark"" into a sort of limbo of ""being a star"" and ""no longer a star.""  I can picture her face when handed the script, ""And you get killed on page 15.""  What?  And this is long before Janet Leigh's brave decision to let her character get killed off in Hitchcock's PSYCHO!  But leave it to Joan, she took the part and really ran with it.  All the way up to the end she was a classy actress and the definition of ""star.""

TOPPER RETURNS has a lot of fun with the idea of Joan Blondell as a ""ghost of her former self.""  Roland Young, Billie Burke, and winsome Carole Landis offer suitable support.  Eddie Anderson tries varying his Rochester persona here--he's great, but the script doesn't give him enough to do--or when it does (like playing with the trained seal) it's the wrong kind of thing.  However, like Joan Blondell, he rises above it with style.",1105574400,,1308,4.547008547008547
1655499,5,B00005R87L,"I love this movie!  I hadn't seen it in years, but remembered loving it, so today I watched it.  I love it.  It's funny, mysterious, and dramatic.  Plus it's always nice to watch an oldie and realize how different they are from today's.  I would definately reccomend this!!",1075248000,,273,4.604166666666667
1655500,4,B00005R87L,"The story is wafer thin and it matters little. There is more crammed in this little unsung film than most comedies. Despite the racist undertones, Rochester shows why he was regarded as such a great comic actor. It is a pity he did not make more films as he seems the equal of Bob Hope as the scared driver of Topper.
Indeed the whole film is a battle between which lunatic can hold the camera for more than a few seconds. There is just too much going on. I particularly liked Topper's wife who was so dizzy and stole scene after scene. It is a who dunnit, but that really does not matter as it is all great fun.
Sit back and enjoy a piece of nonsense.",1046304000,,652,4.141732283464567

The house happens to be full of all sorts of secret passages, and WEIRD personalities. And of course, Mrs. Topper suspects that the young lady who got Cosmo over here is 'the other woman'. This movie is truly funny, and it's backed up by Eddie, or Rochester, Jack Benny's Valet. A Must-See!",1044403200,,463,4.333333333333333
1655502,5,B00005R87L,"When bombshell Joan Blondell accompanies friend Carole Landis to her spooky family home and is murdered for her pains, she returns as a ghost bent upon the solution of her own murder--and enlists Roland Young (as Cosmo Topper) as an unlikely aide.  The result is a wildly funny film that offers great performances from some of the finest screwball character actors of the period.

Based on characters originally seen in the earlier TOPPER starring Cary Grant and Roland Young, TOPPER RETURNS is a broad take-off on the stereotypes of ""old dark house"" mysteries popular in the 1930s and 1940s--most particularly the classic CAT AND THE CANARY and THE BAT, which were noted for their black-costumed criminals and creepy mansions complete with secret passages, but also referencing Hitchcock's REBECCA.  Blondell gives a typically lively performance as a ghost with attitude, and Young is perfectly cast as the mild-mannered banker she blackmails into assisting her.  Carole Landis is also attractively cast as the heiress targeted for murder.

But the real stars of TOPPER RETURNS are the supporting cast, most particularly Billie Burke, Patsy Kelly, and Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson.  Burke gives her sublime flair for the ridiculously absurd full reign in the role of Cosmo Topper's ditsy wife, and few could match Patsy Kelly's combination of drop-dead humor and double-take.  But the real scene-stealer is Eddie Anderson, best known as Jack Benny's radio and television sidekick ""Rochester.""  Although the actual script plays to racial stereotypes of the day, Anderson completely transcends its less savory aspects with a performance that is nothing short of comic genius, and it makes one wish the era in which he worked had afforded him broader opportunity.

The entire family should enjoy TOPPER RETURNS, which plays at director Hal Roach's typically fast pace with nary a lag, and the special effects are fun to watch.  The film is an overlooked comic gem and deserves a place in any collection.

1655503,4,B00005R87L,"This is the first Topper I've seen minus Cary Grant.  But Joan Blondell holds her own and carries the day.  There are constant laughs to be had here and frequent giggles, the biggest instigator of them being the briskly clever dialogue and the performance of Eddie (Rochester) Anderson, who for many years performed with Jack Benny.  His terror at the ""ghostly"" goings on is replete with humor.
It is a pleasure to see a young Dennis O'Keefe acting opposite Carole Landis, sweet, beautiful and a fine actress (what a tragedy she committed suicide over an ill-fated love affair with the then married Rex Harrison - or should I say what a waste, since in this film she displayed such potential as an actress).  And there is a wonderful, laugh till your sides split, performance by Billie Burke, who lets all the stops out in this one.  She seems to relish her role and uses her up and down tremolo voice, sometimes raising it to a hilarious screech.  This is definitely one of her best films.
Watch it and have fun!  Because it's a fun movie at heart.",1005177600,,1049,4.577540106951871
