8612392,4,B00F57ROHA,"I enjoyed the film Mind Game very much for it's animation style. I wanted to see more. I found this. It is a 16 minute short. It is very much in the same style as Mind Game, which was nice. I would have liked to rent it, however, it is not available where I live. The story is ok, nothing I recommend to others. I do wish there was more. That being said, I knew what I was getting in to. Should you know the style and not mind the price or time, this is worth a watch.",1428624000,,468,3.7857142857142856
