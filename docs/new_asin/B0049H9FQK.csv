4290128,5,B0049H9FQK,"I became a baseball fan in 1979, so was able to catch the very beginning of Fernando's career at the end of 1980.  And I do remember it!

I was very excited when I heard that ""Fernando Nation"" was going to be on ESPN and was there when it began also!  I especially appreciated seeing and hearing Fernando speak.  A couple of his statements showed his strength and wisdom.  Regarding all the extraneous matters that can distract especially beginning players he said that he ""set that aside to focus on my pitching.""  That sounds easy but plays hard and takes enormous discipline.  Another telling comment was that he wanted to have 'un otra forma de vida.""  I can't remember the context exactly but the point was that he wanted to be in control of his 'form of living', what we call 'lifestyle'.  Kudos to Fernando and I'm so happy knowing he's up in that sound booth at Dodger Stadium.  We are fortunate to have him as part of the Dodger family!",1288310400,11,945,4.473684210526316

8419079,4,B0049H9FQK,"Great 30 for 30. Easily my 2nd favorite episode.

The only issues were the Spanish wasn't always in Spanish. My dad got a tad upset about that. If you watch it in Spanish, you'll know why. They also gave a very one sided version of the Chavez Ravine issue. I understand why but still.",1469318400,,284,4.2592592592592595
8419080,5,B0049H9FQK,Excellent story. Great case study for the marginalization of minorities!,1461024000,,72,6.3
8419081,2,B0049H9FQK,"Fernando Nation is mostly about the Mexican community in Los Angeles and the politics but very little about Fernando Valenzuela. It's pretty weak stuff and is among 30 for 30's worst programs. After the first year, they've leveled off quite a lot in looking at the rest of his career. Meanwhile, I've laughed at the notion that baseball saved Los Angeles and made race relations better. Don't be silly. All in all, never lose sight of what the title of the program is; otherwise, change the title.",1429574400,,497,4.724137931034483
