3935053,5,B002HWRZTI,"I love the Spooks series and wish I lived in the UK so I did not have to wait for season 8! In this season we see the introduction of Lucas North (Richard Armitage) - who has been in a Russian jail for 8 years (I would spend those 8 years with him myself!).

The suspense throught out all the episodes is very good and what I like about this series compared to any in the US is that they are quite realistic - the acting is not over the top or situations that are just not believable as they do in 24. Everybody who has has role in Spooks 7 plays it to perfection.

Where can I sign up for Season 8?",1262995200,8,599,3.861788617886179
3935054,5,B002HWRZTI,"After a bit of research, compare MI5 with UK Spooks=Same identical product. Cast, content,production, and available many months ago. This series deserves more than Kudos. Consider  this: If you have all the information that is available to  the public regarding that which we are experiencing internationally then this series will demand your attention. How can the subject matter be entertaining?? Well after you watch this epic a few times I would hope you will understand the respect I give to all those who portray the reality of our times. I have watched this series from inception. Now I understand this series will never end, the need to maintain those with skill and talent to let us feel safer on this planet is necessary  as the idiots who believe terror brings rewards will not end.

3935055,5,B002HWRZTI,"If you are not familiar with the series ""MI 5"" as shown on Public Television in the USA but known as ""Spooks"" in Britain, then do yourself a favor and buy at least one of the series. As at writing, I believe that there have been 7 series and each of them has been simply outstanding. Granted I am an exiled Scot living in the USA so I am partial to BBC productions but ""MI 5"" is a rare treat and makes American TV crime series pale by comparison. Be warned that the good guys do not always win, there are gut wrenching tragedies in almost every series - perhaps this is why it is so much more believable. Stellar acting and outstanding scripts are par for the course. The BBC is to be commended for such productions!",1262390400,4,716,4.195652173913044
3935056,5,B002HWRZTI,"*** Updated 22 Jan 2011 ***
Recently I had a chance to watch for the first time the TV miniseries ""Tinker, Taylor, Soldier, Spy"" (1979) and ""Smiley's People"" (1982), both with Sir Alec Guiness, based on John le Carre's books with the same title, and I must say I would qualify these as the best Spy TV Series of All Time, however, I still consider ""Spooks"" is the best spy TV show of modern times, especially the first 5 series.
***

Excellent series, will please those who want to see, fictionalized, of course, one the best intelligence service in the world at work.
Better than the highly acclaimed ""24"", because it is not just an action show.  Well written stories, with more emphasis on characterization and team work.  Dealing with the full spectrum of these days complicated and global political issues, and bringing in other intelligence services:  MI6(SIS), CIA, FSB/SVR, Mossad, ISI, etc.

For those who have never seen it, try, for instance, Season 5 Episodes 6 and 7 ""Hostage Takers"".

Most unfortunate it is not available on American TV anymore.  Viewers prefer ""24"", I suppose.  I also like ""24"", but i feel ""Spooks"" is more diverse, and offers better scenarios.

Many past and current episodes (including Season 8) can be found online with some patience.  They are available on iTunes UK (a UK based credit card is necessary).  I recommend buying the DVDs from Amazon UK, because they are released sooner, and may be cheaper (a PAL/NTSC multi-region player is necessary).",1261526400,2,1486,4.857142857142857
3935057,5,B002HWRZTI,"This show is probably one of the best shows I have seen on television. Unfortunately it does not air in the United States until a couple years after it's UK air date so I am forced to wait for the DVD. Every episode has you at the edge of your seat with it's action packed storyline. The writers of this show continue to do a great job year after year and I hope that this show doesn't end anytime soon. Hopefully they can start airing the show on BBC US at the same time as the UK air date. If you haven't seen this show, do yourself a favor and pick up the first season, it's great! Or if you prefer to watch a couple episodes first before you buy it, you can watch it on BBC channel in the US - it usually comes on around midnight on Sundays or something.. just search your cable box.",1259971200,5,787,4.019108280254777
3935058,5,B002HWRZTI,"Just finished watching Season 7 (purchased from Amazon UK) and it was so good, every minute was packed with so much tension you really cannot turn away.

If you cannot wait for the US release purchase a region free player (search on Amazon for one, I use the Philips that cost ~50.00 and it great) and get this dvd, yu will not regret it.",1257120000,7,338,4.28125

This special set contains seasons 1-7 and I only paid $105.00 with free shipping and the quality of the dvd's are excellent with full menu's and crystal clear sound and widescreen picture as in the regular dvd's sold stateside. I would highly recommend buying this full season 1-7 set than shelling out 40.00 or more for each season separately.  I originally bought the set as a gift and to see if the dvd's were the quality as advertised, they are.",1256428800,3,587,4.485981308411215
3935060,4,B002HWRZTI,"MI-5 (or Spooks, its original title) is a long running, award winning British spy series that has enjoyed continued success in Britain and abroad. In the US however, A&E, PBS and BBCA have tried broadcasting the series (seasons 1-4) to universally disappointing ratings. It is no wander though: in order to accommodate commercials, each original episode was mercilessly cut down by a quarter of its running time (from 59 min to 45 min !!!), making it virtually incomprehensible. Thankfully, we have DVD's and can enjoy the series as it was intended! ;o)

Another good news is that Season 7 is the best yet and can be easily followed even without the benefit of the prior six seasons. In episode one we are introduced to a new character, Lucas North, a senior case officer released in a Russian-British spy exchange after eight years in a Russian prison. His story arcs thru entire season 7, though most episodes are self enclosed and deal with subplots relevant to today's viewer. We have nuclear attacks, bank collapse, and the thread of internal espionage (after eight years in Russia, to whom is Lucas really loyal?).

In addition to excellent writing, the series offers inspired casting in lead, supporting and visiting star roles. Mathew Macfayden (Pride and Prejudice), Rupert Penry Jones (Persuasion), Gemma Jones (Bridget Jones Diary), Hugh Laurie (House), Anthony Head (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) are only a few examples. In season 7, the handsome Richard Armitage (Robin Hood, North and South) is Lucas North. It is this actor's charisma as well as the return to Russians as the true and tried ""bad guys"" that brings new interest to the series.

Interestingly, even though the release date in the US is still uncertain, the set has been available in Australia (Region 4) since April, and will be released in the UK (Region 2) in October. If you want instant gratification (don't we all?), all you need is a region free DVD player.

Enjoy!

3935136,5,B002HWRZTI,"By the start of Season Six, the BBC's ""MI-5"" has thoroughly established itself as one of the world's premier drama shows. The previous five seasons have woven drama, intrigue, excitement, and intelligent storytelling together in a manner rarely seen in television, and each Season has seen us wonder how the enterprise could possible maintain such an accomplishment, yet is only to out-do itself again the following year. Season Six follows that same trajectory accomplishment, and without giving any spoilers, we can say that the series takes a darker and more sinister tone at various points that are perhaps some of the most intense in the series six year track. It can be argued that Season Six is one of the strongest of an already incredibly strong series of Seasons.

MI-5, in case you are unfamiliar with the show, is a section of the security service in the UK that addresses domestic threats. The threats can be of any nature--terrorist, economic, public disturbance, and many others--but these categories of threats are those that are deemed a threat to national security and safety, and MI-5 is called upon to monitor, track, and intervene to address them. The ""MI-5"" television show attempts to tell a dramatized version of this branch of the security services by allowing us to see the individuals who choose to join ""5"" and are often unexpectedly impacted by the requirements of the job as they seek to keep the public safety. The episodes usually deal with one specific threat and 5's response to it, yet many episodes are woven together into a larger, more long running story that encompasses many episodes, sometimes, an entire season. That's why ""MI-5"" is best watched in episode-by-episode order, starting with Season One.

In Season Seven, we see the story pushed forward into ever more dramatic situations than before. It's a Season where a number of major changes in the show takes place, and there are some truly unexpected and dramatic events that take place. Yet the show maintains its relentless move forward, and story lines, acting, and directing are still at a pinnacle of performance, and the show continues to build on its previous six seasons of history, resulting in episodes that tackle a whole new level of security threats. The interaction of Section D of MI-5 with the government is more highlighted in this Season than in others, as well.

MI-5 is intense, dramatic, powerful, intelligent, and gorgeously filmed and acted. It is certainly one of the best shows the BBC has ever put together, a premier offering among an admittedly excellent grouping of shows already made by them. The series helps us to think upon the issues surrounding intelligence and security in a country, and the intersections between liberty and safety with which any free country must deal. It's a superb exercise in filmmaking.",1325635200,4,2842,5.004228329809725

3935138,5,B002HWRZTI,"MI-5 is constanting evolving and the cast rotates faster than one can imagine. Thinking back to Series One, I realize that Series Seven is almost an entirely new cast. Harry Pearce is the still the show's anchor as the man in charge of MI-5.
There were a fewer episodes in Series Seven when compared to the other seasons but the action was more intense and the treachery more volatile.

We lose one agent in a spectacular manner early in the season and more are to follow. Hermionie Norris is back as Ros. Richard Armitage joins the cast as Lucas North--a spy who has just been released after 8 years in a Russian prison. He has his demons to deal with and the odd thing is he goes back to work apparently on the same day he returns to London.

This season it is the Russians who are up to no good trying to become an energy super power at the expense of the UK and the rest of the world. It is refreshing to see the Brits saving the world rather than the Americans. In fact, The British and American spies never work together in harmony and there is a constant mistrust of each side's intentions.

As in prior seasons, the loyalty of certain members of the MI-5 come into question. Is Lucas now a double agent? Can he be trusted? Who in the department is leaking information to the Russians. We go down one path that leads nowhere and then another direction and then back to the original direction. It's a wild world of plot twists and conflicting loyalties.

Some of this season appears to have been filmed in Moscow and that just adds to the excitement of the show. The extras in this season are sparse but I did enjoy hearing a producer saying the writers are stretching the limits of reality in the show. The situations are more intense and they have the confidence that the audience will accept that shift in reality.

London is constantly about to be destroyed in a specactular attack but the MI-5 is there just in time to prevent any destruction. There always seems to be a mole in the MI-5 or MI-6 or high up in the government giving information to the ""bad"" guys. That is the beauty of MI-5, the show.

I enjoy all the high tech gadgets that Malcolm and company use. They have facial recognition software and voice recognition capabilities to track down a suspect. Locations are easily pinpointed. This time The Russians could find the indentity of masked intruders with just a picture of an eye. Modern technology saves the worlds.

One answer is clear - TV drama of this quality.

Not quite the bang, crash, wallop of ""24"" (which I also enjoy...), but much more involved plot lines and character interplay.

An accurate representation of 5? Does one small team do all the high profile work?  Are the security services really that intense, most of the time?  Either way, a fascinating combination of the kind of new world/recruit that we have moved to and anyone who has ever been part of the British civil service will immediately feel most at home with the political backdrop which Harry manages so expertly.

this british version is much, much more interesting because, as far as I'm concerned, britain is a buffer for us americans --- and it's interesting to see what happens vis-a-vis terrorism --- much more believeable and much, much more engrossing.

3935155,1,B002HWRZTI,"As far as the unrealistic, MI-5 is restricted to discovering British traitors and detecting foreign espionage agents.  It does not send agents into other countries or perform police functions.

As far as being terrible, the characters are played as if they had (to quote a line from Jeeves and Wooster) the IQ and cultural development of a backward clam. I once read an article by a British journalists who had interviewed several secret agents. He said that they impressed him as a cross between a professor and an army officer. None of the characters have the smarts to be a professor or the leadership ability to be an officer. This program is an insult to the talent levels of serving MI-5 agents who cannot complain because they would have to violate the official secrets act when they reveal that they are in MI-5.

Several decades ago the British public started complaining of the dumbing down of television programs.  This one and the recent fourth season of Miss Marple illustrate just how down dumb can go.

If this is amongst the most popular television programs in Britain, I predict that in 25-50 years Britain will be one of the has-been nations in Europe.

I suggest John le Carre novel dramatizations for more realistic plots and characters with smarts and culture. Also Sandbaggers and Secret Agent Man - Danger Man.",1268352000,7,1333,4.824561403508772

It is maddening when they do this but then they introduce a new lead person and they turn out to be even better.  This is how the show has evolved and they have done a terrific job of integrating the new lead person (s) each time.

3935159,5,B002HWRZTI,"As a long-time time fan of spy flicks and Le Carr&eacute; novels, I've awaited each new season of MI-5 (Spooks) with mixed anticipation and low dread.  Surely, I think, it can't keep up the standard of excellence, both in plotting and production values; surely this season won't be as compelling as last; thus I surely I inoculate myself against disappointment.

And once again I need not have bothered.  This season of MI-5 is a nail-bitting as the first, maybe even better.  As other reviewers remark, it's not at all necessary to have seen the first 6 seasons to enjoy these episodes.  That's one of the many benefits of the ever-changing cast.  The other, of course, is realism.  In that business, the players don't survive indefinitely.  Whether it's casting by choice or by default - several actors have used this as a springboard - the turn-over of the team keeps the plots fresh and keeps silly stuff to a minimum.

In the last several seasons it's been interesting to watch the BBC give us a new global villain:  us.  The US.  In this season, the gloves are really off in several episodes.  While the immediate threat is Russia in most of these plots (practically nostalgic for Smiley fans) the driving force of several surprising characters is hatred of America.

Seeing ourselves through British/European eyes is spooky - salutary perhaps, but unsettling.  Still, it's carefully done in a series that is amazingly good.",1264723200,23,1430,4.875518672199171
