8210718,5,B000TSTEPU,I keep watching this DVD over and over and over again. I learn something every time that I watch it.  Great investment!  Buy it!,1425081600,,128,4.291666666666667
8210719,5,B000TSTEPU,"Purchased this for my classes unit on Ancient Egypt.  It had a lot of great stuff in it, and I used a few clips, to give the students insights into Egyptian technology.",1422057600,2,168,4.25
8210720,5,B000TSTEPU,"I have a good size collection of Egyptian films and this one I am happy to say added additional information on Egyptian culture. The film went into greater detail on the lives and accomplishments of two Egyptian pharaohs Khufu and Ramses II. It also, gives more detail as to how the great pyramid at Giza was built as well as to the purpose of the giant temple at Abu Sinbel. With today's state of affairs in Egypt you will probably have to settle viewing these great monuments on film instead of visiting the country. Recommend you purchase this one.",1371772800,4,551,4.575757575757576
8210721,5,B000TSTEPU,We watched 3 documentaries on the Pyramids and found this one encompassed much of all three and put it in logical thoughts.  Found it most interesting.,1364860800,2,151,4.8076923076923075
8210722,5,B000TSTEPU,"This 90 DVD goes into considerable detail about the lives and accomplishments of two of Egypt's great pharaohs: Khufu, who built the great pyramid at Giza, and Ramses II, who created an amazing temple carved out of the cliff face at Abu Simbel in southern Egypt. In addition, there is a lot of information about how the ancient pyramids were built and about the ancient Egyptian belief systems regarding immortality. Dramatizations, historical information and pictures of these two remarkable engineering feats keep the video interesting. Very educational and very well done.",1232928000,12,575,5.329670329670329
8210723,4,B000TSTEPU,"I'm not the big Egyptologist in the family (that's my hubby's place), but this show not only held my interest (never a given) but it also caused me to learn a few new things (always good at any age, even mine).  It's not something I give frequent thought to, but when the subject comes up, as it did in this well-presented video, I'm extremely amazed at the extraordinary accomplishments of the ancient Egyptians.  These folks engineered extremely complicated works thousands of years before my forebears in Europe had any clue on how to build long-lasting works (unless you count Stonehenge, which doesn't fare well in a comparison with the Great Pyramid, or most of the smaller pyramids, or other many Egyptian feats of engineering).  As a novice-approaching-intermediate Egyptologist, I would recommend this video to same.  (Experts may be underwhelmed -- I can't really speak from that perspective.)",1232409600,6,903,5.122448979591836
