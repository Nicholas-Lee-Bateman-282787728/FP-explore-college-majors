7822375,4,6302156874,"Tears For Fears' ""In My Mind's Eye"" is probably the earliest concert/video effort released by the band.  This goes back to 1984, which technically is before the release of their legendary second album ""Songs From the Big Chair"".  As a result, this performance has a big focus on their first album, ""The Hurting"".  In fact, 9 of the 10 songs from ""The Hurting"" are on this video (the lone exception is ""Watch Me Bleed"").  During 1984, ""Songs From the Big Chair"" was still being put together - but several of the songs were released and/or performed before the album release.  On ""In My Mind's Eye"" - you will also hear tracks such as ""Broken"" (from where the title of this video comes - 'In My Mind's Eye'), ""Head Over Heels"", ""Mothers Talk"", and ""The Working Hour"".

Tears For Fears is my favorite group, so it is very hard for me to be critical of any effort that they release.  In this case, there are some issues I do have with the ""In My Mind's Eye"" concert video that has been released.  From a musical and audio standpoint, there are no issues I have with this release.  Tears For Fears has always brought their ""A"" game to their concerts and this is no exception.  In fact, if I were watching this concert at the Hammersmith Odeon I would be thrilled to see such a performance.  The problem comes with the production and editing of this effort.  The production and editing puts a damper on what should easily have been a 5 star performance.  I think back in 1984, much of the things that were done to this video were looked upon as ""cool special effects"" - after all this was still in the glory days of video.  But, looking back at these types of things today - they come across as cheesy.

For starters, much of the performance has a bunch of special effects, computer animation, and graphics integrated with the songs.  This becomes very distracting.  You will see this most prevelent in songs such as ""Start of the Breakdown"", ""The Working Hour"", ""Mothers Talk"", ""The Prisoner"", ""Pale Shelter"", and ""The Hurting"".  You will see things such as the computer animation distort Curt and Roland's face on ""Mothers Talk"" and a ""computer grid"" provide a complete distraction on the opening song ""Start of the Breakdown"".  Part of watching a concert is to watch the performance.  I often look to see the artist interact with their instrument.  The ""so-called"" special effects take away from this interaction and leave a negative mark.  Despite these shortcomings, the music on here is still top-notch.

There are some other problems that come with the production.  I just don't care for a lot of the camera work.  The cameras do a nice job at capturing Curt and Roland, but they are inconsistent when it comes to viewing the other members of the band.  Tears For Fears' fans are familiar with most of the supporting band members.  Back during the ""Songs From the Big Chair"" era, keyboardist Ian Stanley and drummer Manny Elias were nearly considered full-time members of Tears For Fears.  On ""In My Mind's Eye"", you hardly get a good view of Ian Stanley and Manny Elias is shown inconsistently (lots during ""Start of the Breakdown"" and less during many of the other songs"".  You also seem to get a lot of shots of guitarist Neil Taylor but few shots of pianist Andy Davis.  Camera work is also poor on ""Memories Fade"".  One of my favorite parts of that song is after Roland Orzabal sings ""scars still linger"",there is a terrific sax bit by Jerry Marotta.  However, during most of the song - the cameras fail to bring the sax bit into good view until the end of the song.  Finally, the final song performed is a classic song - ""Change"".  This is a favorite among Tears For Fears' fans, yet the producers of this video choose to use this song to put the closing credits.

There are some positives as well.  One band member that is probably new to Tears For Fears fans is Jerry Marotta.  Marotta provides sax work as well as miscellaneous percussion and even some xylophone (on ""Mothers Talk"" and ""Change"").  Tears For Fears' fans are probably more familiar with William Gregory's saxophone work.  Marotta did provide many of the sax arrangements on ""The Working Hour"" on ""Songs From the Big Chair"", although Gregory performed them.  I still think Marotta does an admirable job on this performance despite the fact he probably falls short of Gregory's work.

As mentioned the music still is the best feature of this video.  Songs such as ""Suffer the Children"" and ""Memories Fade"" seem to have the fewest distractions.  If the whole video were filmed in the style of these songs - this would have easily been a 5 star effort.  I also think one of the surprises of this performance is Roland's performance on ""Ideas as Opiates"".  This is often a forgotten Tears For Fears song, but it is one of the special songs of this performance.  ""In My Mind's Eye"" contains segue performance of ""Broken"" and ""Head Over Heels"" - I don't think any other  Tears For Fears video has this.  On a side note, ""Broken"" is credited as ""We are Broken"".  I think Tears For Fears must have shortened the name for the ""Songs From the Big Chair"" album.  There is good interaction between the band and the crowd - you even see when the main set ends and encore begins.

This video doesn't contain anything in the way of liner notes. I think this a solid live performance.  If it weren't for the editing and production - it would be terrific.  Tears For Fears fans will still like the music.  This is also an outstanding video to get familiar with many of the older songs of Tears For Fears.  I'd still recommend it.",1096761600,22,5586,4.587878787878788
7822376,3,6302156874,"I saw this concert on TV in 1986. I was twelve and I actually sat in front of the TV with a cassette recorder and taped all the songs. For many years I've been hoping to see this concert again. I was ecstatic to finally be able to order it, but my excitement was ruined when I watched it. The concert footage was overlayed with cheesy special effects that looked like a 1983 video game. All I wanted to do was enjoy the live versions of my favorite TFF songs and drool over Curt Smith, but I couldn't see him! Maybe this will come out on DVD one day and they'll do it right.",1089590400,6,574,4.043859649122807
7822377,4,6302156874,"Tears For Fears--Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith--was one of the most underrated but highly imaginative and candid bands of the 80s. Their lyrics were honest and sometimes heartwrenching; their music was catchy; and their vocals were soulful.
Due to artistic differences (really) the two men parted ways in the early 90s. Rumors have it that they may be recording again together soon. Only time will tell.
IN MY MIND'S EYE is concert footage and video footage mostly taken from the band's first album, THE HURTING. 'Tis a good video if you are a fan and can find a copy.",997833600,10,568,4.747474747474747
