8233515,5,B000YN4UD6,"very cool classic double feature dvd with the beautiful and scary Barbara Steele, a must have if you love old classic black and whites, the movie The Long Hair Of Death is exceptionally scary and atmosphereic, with one hell of a nasty ending.",1355184000,,242,4.651162790697675
8233516,2,B000YN4UD6,"i'd like to warn folks to avoid this ""deal"". if i had known i was going to basically end up watching what looks like an ancient VHS recording (in EP) on a DVD, i would never have ordered this. my bad. i have only watched Long Hair of Death thus far, and it was extremely poor quality picture (soft, blurry image) and the sound was about as bad as it could get. the hiss was so loud i had to crank my volume in order to make out the dialogue. i did a quick scan through Terror Creatures, and while it looks and sounds only slightly better, the picture shakes a lot. i'm not crazy about having to sit through another painful viewing....

having said that, Long Hair of Death is a neat movie, not great, but interesting. i'm sure i would have liked it even more if the transfer was better. looks a lot like a dub from a poor quality VHS tape.

spend a little more and get higher quality elsewhere. oh, and Long Hair is full-screen here, though i've since located widescreen versions. some cost considerably more, but it would be worth it if you like the movie.",1336089600,5,1057,4.253731343283582
