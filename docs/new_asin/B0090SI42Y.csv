5212404,4,B0090SI42Y,"Rza bit off more than he could chew.  This movie shouldn't have been written AND directed AND scored AND starring Rza.  However, the movie was still loads of fun and Rza has definitely proven that he has great cinematic vision.  Expect many filmmaking imperfections, but enjoy the fun ride.

Thaddeus (director Rza) is a gifted blacksmith whose talents are contracted by local warring clans.  He is pure of heart and wants nothing more than to purchase the freedom of his courtesan wife Lady Silk (Jamie Chung) from the brothel madame Blossom (Lucy Liu basically reprising her Kill Bill role).

Thaddeus becomes mixed up in a plot to steal a large shipment of gold.  The main villain is Silver Lion (Byron Mann), who betrays the Lion clan leader with the help of Bronze Lion (Cung Le; Dragon Eyes).  Zen Yi (Rick Yune; Ninja Assassin), the son of the murdered clan leader, sets out to stop Silver Lion with his armor of retractable blades.  Also in the mix is Jack Knife (Russel Crowe), the most interesting and charismatice character (outside of combat) with an interesting taste for bachelor party shenanigans (i.e., Asian call girls, liquor and opium).

The fighting in the movie was a mixed bag that will largely disappoint martial arts movie fans.  As the oddly bewigged lion clansman, Cung Le was sadly under-utilized.  He never gets to looks good or show off.  Not even in his finale fight against Lucy Liu.  The choreography presents a mix of very cool and very silly kung fu combat maneuvers.  Sadly, by and large the action is filmed way too close-up.  For me, the combat highlights should all be credited to Bautista's Brass Body.  He seemed to have the coolest scenes, obviously the coolest F/X because of his ability, and some of the most fun choreography that was filmed so that we could actually see it.

Despite my complaints about much of the action, the kung fu theater feel was maintained undeniably well.  Rza captured that tone perfectly.  There was also a festive display of spewy-fun gore.

The dialogue is dreadfully dry (except for Crowe's delivery).  Rza, God bless him for trying, can't act or effectively narrate.  His character was not only understated, but lacked the lines to justify his purpose.  It seems that Rza was going for a mood-driven film with stylized combat like Bunraku or The Warrior's Way.  I could see his goal, but his meant-to-be-poetic blacksmith character was clearly the weak link in synthesizing this quasi-arthouse-ful conceptual grace.  Rza tries to use a Shaolin Temple training flashback to corroborate Thaddeus' focus and combat ability.  Still, I found him to have zero combat credibility when facing Iron Body--a character who actually earned my respect on screen.

The score (also by Rza) was cool during the first scene (a fight scene).  But I noticed less effective use of music later in the movie.  I'm not hating, it was a neat score.  But this was disappointing as I expected to have some awesomely rap-scored fight scenes, but some of them had combat volume drowning out the music, rendering it ineffective even at times that louder music would be appropriate.

Director Rza--of the Wu Tang Clan--was always a devout fan of Hong Kong cinema's kung fu theater.  While his direction is clearly fledgling and his scoring ability nothing to his own rapping talent, his passion for classic kung fu movies manifested the greatest strength of this film: the kung fu theater ""feel"" of it all.  His excellent theatrical homage includes some classic kung fu movie components such as the iron body (brass body in the movie) focus style, techniques that are named after characters (e.g., the Gemini stance), the betrayal of one's master and the revenge that follows, the house of mirrors fight (which was unfortunately brief), traps and poison darts, fighters exploding from the ground in ambush and semi-flying combat maneuvers.  Perhaps the most fun was when all of the brothel whores turn out to be ninja-savvy combat-chic assassins.  Rza also covered the bases of kung fu weaponry, including bladed fans, bladed sleeve extensions, chain-fighting, various blades and good-old kung fu.

This movie shouldn't have been written AND directed AND scored AND starring Rza.  However, the movie was still loads of fun and Rza has definitely proven that he has great cinematic vision.  I'd like to see him collaborate with more experienced film makers before attempting another solo venture like this.  But I am so glad that I got to see it anyway, imperfections and all.  This was a good debut considering his complete lack of experience since yet more experienced hands have failed to produce such entertainment time and time again.",1352505600,12,4683,4.967866323907455
5212405,4,B0090SI42Y,"RZA waited a long time to tell this story, this brainchild of his, inspired by untold hours of viewing kung-fu flicks during his formative years. The Shaw Brothers as baby sitters? Sure, why not. RZA grew up sort of a historian on kung fu pictures, this guy from Brooklyn who can go toe to toe, trivia for trivia, with Hong Kong action cinema experts like Bey Logan. And how does RZA's THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS stack up against classics like THE 36TH CHAMBER OF SHAOLIN, MAD MONKEY KUNG FU, and THE FIVE DEADLY VENOMS?

Okay, THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS isn't the best martial arts film released stateside this year (That would be Iko Uwais's THE RAID: REDEMPTION). Whereas THE RAID: REDEMPTION grounded itself in vicious but realistic combat sequences, RZA's pet project is more steeped in the bizarre and the fanciful. A mythical element creeps in. In RZA's personal vision of wuxia, a fighter's flesh can transmutate into metal. A laborer, by dint of will power, can animate his prostheses. It's a fun show.

In the 19th century, the freed slave Thaddeus Henry Smith (RZA) made his way to feudal China, and in the tiny Jungle Village has made a home. Thaddeus is a gifted blacksmith, a peaceful, quiet man. Except that the rough characters in Jungle Village frequently contract his metal-shaping services. And so the blacksmith reluctantly perverts the lessons he'd learned, and he forges jagged weapons of mayhem. Thaddeus's only haven lies in the arms of Lady Silk (Jamie Chung), a courtesan in the local brothel. He dreams of earning enough gold to buy out Lady Silk's contract from the brothel's madame (Lucy Liu). Then they'd go away together. So he keeps on making killing weapons. He turns a blind eye to his conscience.

RZA's blacksmith is only one character in a plot that revolves around the Governor's gold shipment, and how all manner of hooligans go all out to obtain it. The central villain is the duplicitous Silver Lion (Byron Mann) of the Lion clan, him what just ruthlessly betrayed his leader, Gold Lion. Fast approaching is Zen Yi (Rick Yune), revenge-inclined son of Gold Lion and wearer of a suit of nasty blades. Today Silver Lion and his minions ride roughshod over Jungle Village. And is it a coincidence that Jungle Village is one of the stops in the gold shipment's itinerary? Does a bear crap in the woods? Is RZA fond of letters in caps?

I admire RZA's efforts. Dude's a quadruple threat: he wrote, scored, directed, and acted in this movie. Those into martial arts movies may be aware of RZA's rep as a hardcore addict of kung fu cinema. RZA's been known to drop an audio commentary or two for past DVD releases (like THE 36TH CHAMBER OF SHAOLIN). Don't be surprised when RZA manages to rep the Shaolin Temple in a flashback sequence. Me, I enjoyed THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS. I wish that RZA hadn't been so understated in his performance. As the prohibitive protagonist, the sleepy-eyed RZA needed to generate more energy, more life. Thankfully, Russell Crowe picks up the slack, provides the swagger and the big personality as the enigmatic (and amusingly lecherous) Englishman, Jack (or ""Mr. Knife""). Jack Knife is shady, his motivations murky. All we know is that he loves women and that he always brings a gun to a knife fight. You're kept guessing until the third act just which side he'll fall on. THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS is packed with amped-up wire-fu theatrics. The violence is brutal but so exaggerated it achieves an almost cartoonish vibe. Set your eyeballs on alert for cameos by Pam Grier and Hong Kong legend Gordon Liu. MMA fighter Cung Le has a supporting bit as Bronze Lion. As a bonus for the theater goer, THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS is presented by an onscreen Quentin Tarantino, after which he introduces a trailer for his upcoming DJANGO UNCHAINED.",1352505600,,3815,4.723723723723723
5212406,5,B0090SI42Y,"This is a flick that Joe Bob Briggs would love. While deficient in motor vehicle chases (no motor vehicles), no beasts (but some pretty beastly Chinese gangsters) and only two (ceramic) breasts, The Man with the Iron Fists is an excellent chop socky movie. We have spinning assassin bimbo fu, truly overwhelming Chinese Whore-Lady fu with a cast of dozens of flying Beautiful Chinese Ninja Whore-Ladies, a ex-slave Hero (RZA) who trades in his `fro for `fu training at the same Shaolin temple that trained John Carradine, a baddy (Dave Bautista)that turns into a brass table lamp every time someone tries to stick him (which happens a lot) and lots and _lots_ of straight and fancy kung fu. In a movie first, Russell Crowe performs Ben Wa Ball fu on one of the Chinese Whore-Ladies.
We have heads rolling, eyes rolling, hands rolling and stomachs rolling. We have a baddie dragged into the gears for a really messy exit, Squirt! At the other end of the ceramic breasts, is the lock to the Secret Tunnel (tm) and the Head Whore-Lady (Lucy Lui) thrusts a foot-long key straight in there to unlock the Hidden Door.
The scenery-chewing was awesome, especially Russell Crowe's Chinese ""disguise"" (coolie hat, slanty-eyed mascara). The score is excellent and subtle, bringing in references to other Manly Movies. Several times, I expected Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood to stride in from stage right and left respectively.
Five Stars: Check it out.",1352246400,2,1444,4.922131147540983
5212407,5,B0090SI42Y,"I have always been a huge fan of the Kiwi actor, Russell Crowe, ever since he, back in 2005, confronted the American singer called Moby in a bathroom and a/s/sailed him with a bunch of anti-American slurs. I think that alone qualifies Crowe as the greatest actor the world has ever seen...if you do not count Carrot Top, Pauly Shore and Tom Green, of course! I'm glad to see him back in this martial arts movie conceived of by none other than RZA, who is a rapper from the Wu-Tang Clan and a 110 percent, hardcore Obama voter, to be sure.

This highly poetic movie that is best enjoyed like you would a fine glass of wine centers around RZA, a blacksmith, who fashions highly complex weapons of destruction for a small village located inside of Chinatown. After a person who is planning to commit treason (also known as a traitor) menaces the village, the blacksmith teams up with both good guys and bad guys to defend the community of wonton soup-enjoyers. As you can see from this plot description alone, this movie will likely be the movie nominated for the most Oscars, on account of its extreme, arthouse quality and attention to method acting.

Since this is a martial arts movie, I was not at all surprised to see Carl Douglas make several cameos while singing Kung F/u Fighting, which was easily...easily the sole highlight of this entire train-wreck of a film. I am, nonetheless, a little bit worried about the implied racism with his cameos because they are essentially a black man singing about Asian people in Kung F/u Fighting, which means two minority groups are mercilessly referenced...true racism if I ever saw it! However, a small upside was the brilliant and inspired casting of Dave ""The Manimal"" Bautista as one of the rice-eating villagers in this funky tale. I was especially impressed with him powerbombing, bodyslamming and spinebusting Russell Crowe and the rapper from Wu-Tang Clan several times over. That is surely powerful filmmaking at its most awesomest.

I am going to go out on a small limb here and make a prediction: The Man with the Iron Fists will easily sashay away with the Best Picture Oscar in 2013. You heard it here from me first, people. Just remember that when all those a-h/o/l/e/s at Entertainment Tonight are taking credit for making this prediction when Oscar season rolls around, okay? Sup.",1351814400,6,2341,4.775308641975308

5212469,4,B0090SI42Y,"the only thing i knew about rza before i saw this movie was that he appeared in the movie ""the protector 2,"" which was unbelievably awful, although to be fair, he wasn't the worst part of it.  when i saw that he not only starred but also directed this one, i thought ""man, this movie is going to be a trainwreck.""  but imagine my surprise when it was actually pretty dang entertaining.  it's fast-paced and outrageous, with great set design, interesting characters, and crazy fight scenes that suffer only a little bit from obvious wire-work.  the plot is reasonably complex with lots of characters sneaking around, and you aren't really sure where their loyalties lie.

in ""the man with the iron fists,"" however, rza is the weakest point as far as acting is concerned.  he's not bad, exactly, but he plays the role so laid-back and calm that he's kind of boring.  in some scenes it looks like he's about to fall asleep.  thankfully, he's surrounded by lots of other actors so he doesn't have to carry the entire film.  to contrast rza's sleepy performance, we have russell crowe going all-out as a british special agent in one of his silliest and most entertaining performances, and byron long as a flamboyant gang leader with hair straight out of a 1980s hard rock video.

in general, i liked it a lot, but the pacing was little bit off, rza's acting leaves much to be desired, and the flashback scenes about his character seem totally out of place.  but the direction, the set design, and the fight scenes are all great.",1451260800,,1523,4.62453531598513

Heads, limbs and plausibility go bye-bye as a soundtrack of phat beatz bludgeons away in this homage to classic kung-fu cinema, written and directed by rapper, producer and Wu-Tang Clan merchandise seamstress RZA.

In a jungle village, the confusingly named Jungle Village, where the hip-hopper strains  unconvincingly  to play a humble blacksmith, named Blacksmith, an old chap, Gold, is offed by his crooked henchmen, Silver and Bronze. A knife-brandishing English soldier, named (groan) Knife, turns up, oh, and theres a big guy who can turn his body into brass, and hes named Brass Body, and...no, sorry, this is pointless.

What did I think?

For years RZA has been crossbreeding elements of classic kung fu movies and urban culture to create music - from his productions for the Wu Tang Clan to numerous movie soundtracks and even anime (Afrosamurai).  Naturally his film - making debut does the same!
It's campy at times, but quite intentionally.  It's fantasy, but it's supposed to be - and results in some new ideas and unique designs.  Solid cast who know action and kung fu.  It has an excellent mold of hip hop and eastern orchestra soundtrack - sone reviewers seem to hate it but for me that was absolutely the best part!
To be honest, as a fan of his music, it was pretty much everything i was hoping it would be.  Is it a movie only RZA fans will enjoy? Maybe? I don't know, but if you aren't a fan of the RZA but DO enjoy this movie then you should probably look into his other work!",1424563200,,1103,4.283653846153846

Terrible Acting  (Had to employ subtitles just to make out the mumbled dialogue.)

 Did Russell Crowe loose a bet or something? What's he doing in a corker like this.  Same for Lucy Liu. One from column A and no dessert !!.

5212700,2,B0090SI42Y,"Okay.  I can see Cung Le, Rick Yune, Byron Mann, and Dave Bautista in an over-the-top throwback to 1970s grindhouse martial arts movie like this, aided and (woefully) abetted by the ridiculous blood and gore quotient that torture porn director Eli Roth brings to the screen.  I can especially see Wu Tang Clan's RZA (such a truly horrible actor who talks like he's got rocks in his mouth) in a movie like this (he's the director) given that musical group's well-documented love of the martial arts genre (among other things).  I can eve see Lucy Liu putting her tongue-in-cheek two cents into this as well given her pedigree of movies like ""Charlie's Angels"" and ""Kill Bill"".  But Russell Crowe?  How'd they get him in here?!?  This movie's bad enough to make you think that he can't act!  He certainly phones it in as Jack Knife, bringing a (significantly altered) spaghetti western feel to this piece of crass Americanized oriental cinema.

This swing-and-a-miss bit of kung fu fantasy shows a lot of flare and pizzazz with bright colors and well thought and constructed/ structured set pieces but misses its target by a lot in its over-reliance on gore and special effects to make up for lackluster and obviously derivative fight sequences (and derivative isn't nearly a bad thing often if it's done well and tweaks or juices the formula just a bit) like Zen Yi and Silver Lion's mirrored maze showdown.  [This is all the more surprising and dismaying seeing that famed martial arts fight choreographer choreographed these fights!]  And that's too bad because it shows promise at times and who's making movies like this nowadays for fans of this genre?

I applaud RZA for making this movie but hopefully some of his friends will be in his ear the next time advising him to let more competent actors do the acting (and fighting), rely less on the spfx budget, and tighten up the action (the script, while no great thing, was fine for this film).  Sure, make it fantastical, but reference classics like ""Duel to the Death"" to see what this could have really been like.  And there's an idea: remake ""Duel to the Death"" (but for viewers' sake stick close to the original)!

5212768,5,B0090SI42Y,"Even though there are hundreds of reviews of this movie I decided to also write one. I just picked up this DVD (The Man with the Iron Fists-Unrated extended edition) a week ago and viewed it a few days ago.  This is a Quentin Tarantino presents movie so I knew there would be plenty of action.  I was not disappointed.  This classic martial arts film has some fantastic fight scenes and stars Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu, as well as some other well-known martial arts stars.

Like many movies of this genre it is sometimes confusing as to who the good guys are and who the bad guys are; nevertheless, by the time it ends it is clear who the bad guys are because they are all dead.  There are also quite a few sex scenes which make this an R rated DVD.  This extended version also has scenes that were not in the theater movie.

One of the ways I judge whether a movie deserves a high rating or a low one, is if I would enjoy seeing the movie more than once.  Without a doubt, I will watch this DVD again and again in the future.

If you are into fast paced martial arts action films you should check out this one. You can pick it up for a bargain on Amazon as well as some bargain stores.

This movie is definitely a tribute to those early karate films. I was hesitant to watch it. Once I saw it, I really did enjoy the movie. I liked it well enough to purchase it. I hope this is only the beginning for karate films made the old (school) way. The only thing missing was the voice dubbing. If ever a kung fu movie is made with that feature, it can truly be said: that which was once old is new! I would love to find some of those 70s Fu movies on DVD. Amazon keep that in mind.

5212890,5,B0090SI42Y,"Anyone remember watching Black Belt Theatre on Saturday afternoons?

This movie gives off that same old school kung fu vibe as those classic 70's Shaw Brothers classics. The colorful costumed larger than life characters and crazy weapons and over the top fighting remind me of something you would see in a Venoms movie. It's really no surprise considering RZA's love of those movies. This is a wonderful homage to those classics.

The movie is presented in 2:40 anamorphic widescreen and is an excellent colorful transfer. The audio options include English 5.1, Spanish 5.1, and French 5.1. There are English, Spanish and French subtitles. It would have been cool if there was Cantonese and/or Mandarin audio to really give it that old school kung fu feel.

The dvd gives us the theatrical 96 minute version of the film and an unrated extended version that runs 108 minutes. I'm glad Universal presented these on one dvd and didn't first release the theatrical and 6 months later release the unrated like so many studios do.

Extras include 5 deleted scenes that total 24 minutes. There are also 3 fluff featurettes: 'on set with RZA' (5 minutes), look inside mwtif (2 minutes), and path to the east (2 minutes). I would like to have seen a commentary track with RZA and Eli Roth. Better yet a 3-way commentary featuring RZA, Eli Roth, and Tarantino.

5212891,2,B0090SI42Y,"I normally don't list the storyline as it seems everyone else does.  In this case I am not even sure what it was.  I bought this movie because of the actors Lucy Liu, Batista and Russell Crow.  The casting was excellent and the acting, score, and direction were actually much better than I expected. Sets & costumes were well done, too. Really, everything was well done but the action, which is kind of a big deal for this genre.  The Action sequences in this movie were just not that good.

The Universal DVD contains both R-rated and Unrated versions, coming in at 96 & 108 minutes, respectively. The image is colorful and splendid with a nice 2.40:1 widescreen picture. Spoken languages are available in English, Spanish, and French, with subtitles in English or French.

5212892,2,B0090SI42Y,"Having watched several of the Shaw Brothers classics during my day, I can definitely see where Rza got his inspiration for this movie. The only problem is, he created a bad Kung Fu fantasy instead of putting out a memorable film. As many people have already described this film in detail, I'm not going to go into the plot. But suffice to say, Rap music doesn't belong in a 19th century period piece. It just doesn't. Rza would have been better off getting the film properly scored instead of creating a Rap soundtrack for the background music. It was very distracting.

Second, Rza choosing to have an African American character in the film, working as a blacksmith, might have worked. The only problem is, he chose to play the role himself. I have to agree with what others have already stated. Rza is not a very good actor in general. Add to that his street flare as he delivers his lines, and you have a mismatch character who doesn't really belong in the story. As a result, It was difficult to buy into his role. Had he picked a seasoned actor instead, it might have worked out. But as is, this film was likely a life long dream of his, so I guess he had to fit himself in somewhere. In retrospect, it was a mistake.

I commend him, however, for tapping into the Asian American acting pool for his lead roles. Lucy Lui did well enough, as did Ricky Yune. Jamie Chung also appears in the film as Rza's love interest, but she doesn't really get enough screen time to leave her mark. It seemed like she was mainly there to give Rza's character a connection to the film. Russell Crowe also  appears  and his acting is always good. But in this case,  he seemed out of place. His character was odd and seemed to be written in just to have an excuse for more star power on the screen. At least, that's the way it seemed to me.

The martial arts were OK, but they don't hold a flame to the HK classics from the 70's and 80's. My advice is, if you want a good Kung Fu flick, just go to the source. Either check out some Shaw Brother's films or look for some filmed  by Golden Harvest Pictures. They have real Kung Fu stories that work while showcasing excellent Kung Fu. Rza's  version is more of a Kung Fu parody that pays homage to the genre, but doesn't really hit the mark.

In the end I gave the film 2 stars. Rza did manage to insert some of the  ideas you expect in a Kung Fu flick. He also enlisted the aide of  Asian American actors, so he gets another star for that. But overall, this is not a great film. It's just too far out of the norm to be a good Kung Fu flick. All you're left with while watching this film is a lingering hope that it might improve. But unfortunately, it never does. Definitely a one time rental at best.",1396915200,14,2735,4.260617760617761

5212957,2,B0090SI42Y,"The main draw for this movie would be the kung fu fight scenes but they are not that many and they also seem to lack in any length. Most fights are either against goons and there is very little in the way of the major players fighting with one another. A few examples are the way the the Gemini Twins fight go, how X blade and Silver Tiger don't even really fight.

The main story about the blacksmith is very stereotypical and seems really drawn out at times. Overall the dialogue for most of characters is very poorly delivered/campy (Except for Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu (somewhat)). I couldn't recommend this movie unless it was like $5. I have a very high tolerance for poor quality movies but this is so bad I couldn't even watch the whole thing and skipped a lot of parts to just watch the fight scenes.",1394928000,,811,4.370860927152318

The fight scenes are generally good but there's too many cliche's and stereotypical characters in the film. RZA should have hired a veteran actor to portray the lead blacksmith character rather than trying to carry the film on his own merits (or lack there of) Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu two established quality actors are under used in their roles Crowe seems to enjoy himself as an OTT character but the role could have been done by anyone of lesser stature . One notable is the menacing presence of pro wrestler Dave Batista as one of the main bad guys a behemoth who can change body mass and form. His role as the heavy is well played and he looks and acts the part well. Overall if I were RZA I'd leave the acting to others, concentrate on writing a better screenplay and get a veteran co-director and 2nd unit director to assist you if you want to do another film.",1393027200,,1047,4.486910994764398

5212963,1,B0090SI42Y,"I love kung fu flicks, and grew up on those great Shaw Brothers films of the 1970's. I had heard that ""The Man with the Iron Fists"" was RZA's homage to those classic films, so I was pretty excited to give this view. Toss in ""Hostel""'s Eli Roth and Quentin Tarantino...and this seems like a can't miss film.

If you dig deep enough into through the rubbish, there is actually a decent story buried in here. A rogue clan wants to steal a shipment of the emperor's gold, and a small town gets caught in the middle. The town's blacksmith just wants to save enough money so that he, and the prostitute he's in love with can leave and start a new life together. From that basic story this huge mess comes spilling out, and nothing is coherant or enjoyable.

You have a wonderful supporting cast with Ricky Yune, Lucy Liu and Russell Crowe all chewing scenery when given half a chance, but ultimately wasted in one pointless scene after another. Even if their characters were jammed into a brainless action film, it would be forgivable if the action were any good. It's not. There is plenty of bloody kicks and punches thrown, some wire fighting, some weapons tossed in, some cgi with WWE wrestler Dave Bautista occasionally turning into brass....all poorly, poorly filmed.

This whole mess can be blamed on one guy,...RZA. Apparently he is a rapper, and occasional actor? I remember seeing his name on the ""Kill Bill"" soundtrack, but I can't say I'm familiar with him. He's all over this movie; he stars as the blacksmith, he's listed as the writer and is also the director. He's obviously very well connected, and was able to secure financing to put this thing into motion, but you really wish someone...anyone...would have stepped in here and put a stop to this mess before it got too far.

Unenjoyable in an even ""so-bad-it's-good"" way, just a boring, kinetic mess, that you will kick yourself for wasting 90 minutes on.",1391990400,4,1917,4.662721893491124

I love jazz percussion and bass, I listen to the greats almost obsessively but that doesn't mean I'm now qualified to play in a Jam Session with Herbie Hancock. I give RZA credit for one thing, he had an incredible cast, Russel Crowe, Lucy Liu, wow...but the story line was just too weak. Also RZA acting ability falls somewhere between my 4th grade Christmas play and a local furniture store commercial by a third stringer, he's that bad.

I would have to agree with the other reviewer and say it was some self righteous promotion of RZA and an idea he had that went bad once he got all these great actors together. None of which who know a thing about real martial arts besides maybe Lucy Lui. The movie probably would have been okay without RZA. His acting was so bad that it weighed the movie down in my opinion. He wasn't believable at all. And his chemistry with the other actors was nonexistent. You can tell he was only there because he is somewhat successful as a music producer and has a little pull in Hollywood right now. Even his fight scenes during the end are weak and provide no adrenaline for the movies climax. He wasn't even convincing as a blacksmith! Stick to the street hood cop roles like he played in American Gangster. Leave the emotional acting to the professionals. I'm not hating on RZA. I'm just telling it like it is. His talent lays behind his music! Not in front of the camera. The fight scenes are the only thing that kind of save the movie. That's why it got two stars instead of one!

5213161,3,B0090SI42Y,"RZA loves Hong-Kong martial arts movies. Even if you don't know the origin of his group's name Wu-Tang Clan, you know that for sure after watching ""The Man with the Iron Fists"" RZA stars and directs. Together with such famous actors like Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu, RZA's feature debut includes such veteran Chinese actors as Kuan Tai Chen, Ka-Yan Leung and Chia Hui Liu (credited as Gordon Liu), the star of, yes, ""The 36th Chamber of Shaolin.""

Unfortunately, loving something is one thing; making it actually is another. ""The Man with the Iron Fists"" just doesn't have a good story to tell, and a central character that hold our attention throughout the film's running time. Here RZA plays the titular reluctant hero, a skilled weapon-making blacksmith in the 19th century Chinese ""Jungle Village,"" where warring clans fight over power, money and honor.

But I'd rather not summarize the plot which is slow and pretty dull. To be fair, the martial arts sequences are interesting, being choreographed by Cory Yuen (choreographer of ""The Transporter"" and many others). The gorgeous production design, with the set made in China, is also impressive.

This is RZA's homage to the 70s exploitation movies including Shaw Brothers kung-fu films. Like Tarantino's ""Kill Bill,"" the film is made with love for the genre, but that is not enough to make a compelling action movie that stands on its own.",1375488000,2,1394,4.9742489270386265

The action is fast and complicated, but no one cares.  Why?  Because the camera shots are way too close!  Sometimes it's like watching a fight scene from one of the fighter's pockets.

There is a lot of killing and bloody spurts, but it looks fake and is often for no good reason.  Storytelling is this movie's weakness.

The narrator is ponderous, boring, and ghetto--which makes no sense.  He is the worst part of the movie.  The blacksmith who loves a lady of the night.  Sounds interesting, right?  It's not.  The story is narrated as if from a fifth-grader's perspective.  In fact, I bet some kid wrote this film.

5213209,3,B0090SI42Y,"Man, where to begin?  Firstly, I am a life-long fan of martial arts films.  Everything from Kurosawa's 1943 (Judo vs Jujitsu) classic ""Sanshiro Sugata"", to the modern gore & brutality of 2011's ""The Raid"", and just about everything in between.  I fell in love with film fighting during the '80s, when I was allowed to stay up late to watch ""Kung Fu Theater"", featuring traditional Chinese fighting styles and costumes.  My discovery was probably not too long after the film's 1st time writer/director, RZA, began his own obsession with this particular brand of escapism.  When I first heard that RZA was writing and directing a kung fu movie, I could barely contain my excitement.  A while later, when I finally saw the first trailer for it, I could hardly contain my contempt.  It looked awful.  After unfavorable reviews started pouring in, I thought it best to cut my losses and avoid seeing it at all.  Many months passed until just last week, when it was available for checkout from my local library.  A trusted source's recent reserved recommendation sealed the deal.  I lowered my expectations and had a go.  I gotta say, there was some pretty cool stuff going on here.  Was it still disappointing?  Yes, but if I came away with anything, it's a sincere hope that RZA continues in this profession.  My man leapt right into the 35th Chamber of filmmaking, and while not graduating, I think he showed the monks he means business.

In Jungle Village (kind of a late-1800s, Chinese version of Mos Eisley from ""Star Wars""), powerful clans converge to steal a large portion of gold that will be escorted through town via the governor's order.  Knowing of the cutthroats that reside there, the governor has requested the extra security of the Lion clan.  The clan's leader, Gold Lion (Chen Kwan Tai, ""Dragon Tiger Gate"") agrees until his lieutenants, Silver (Byron Mann, ""Belly of the Beast"") & Bronze (Cung Le, ""Dragon Eyes"") betray and murder him.  Seems they want the gold for themselves.  Not taking the other clans too seriously, it seems the only real threat to their plan is Gold's son, Zen Yi, aka the X-Blade (Rick Yune, ""Ninja Assassin""), and eventually Thaddeus (RZA, ""Coffee & Cigarettes""), the town's blacksmith, whose business is booming with weapon requests for the impending rumble.  There are many other characters, including Russell Crowe  (""L.A. Confidential"") as the Englishman, Jack Knife, and Lucy Liu (""Kill Bill"") as the owner of the local brothel that EVERYONE frequents.

I refuse to call out RZA for plagiarism because these types of films borrowed from one another quite liberally and I recognized most of his source material.  The majority of this picture was borrowed from ""The Kid With The Golden Arm"" (1979), ""Flag of Iron"" (aka ""Spearman"", 1980), and ""Crippled Avengers"" (1978): movies starring the group of 6 actors known as the Venom mob (from their most popular film together, ""5 Deadly Venoms""), who worked for the Shaw Brothers studio in the mid-to-late '70s, specifically for the late director Chang Cheh (""One Armed Swordsman"").  Elements are also borrowed from other Shaw flicks, like ""Cave of the Silken Web"" (1967) and ""The 36th Chamber of Shaolin"" (1978).

The fight scenes?  It saddens me to report that, well, frankly, they suck.  The bullseye (or at least its periphery) of RZA's target audience is more-or-less me and had the kung fu been good I would've been absolutely enamored with this film.  Dreadful use of wires, editing, CGI gore, and slow motion totally sink the action.  RZA and co-writer Eli Roth (""Hostel"") developed original weapons for the film and they're pretty sweet.  If only they had figured out a way to shoot the scenes where these items were utilized.  Rick Yune, Cung Le, and WWE/MMA fighter Dave Bautista (as Brass Body) are really the only ones that get to show off any good moves but they're still disappointing due to poor handling.

The Universal DVD contains both R-rated and Unrated versions, coming in at 96 & 108 minutes, respectively.  The image is colorful and splendid with a nice 2.40:1 widescreen picture.  Spoken languages are available in English, Spanish, and French, with subtitles in English or French.  Special features include: deleted scenes, ""A Look Inside..."", ""Path To The East"", and ""On The Set With RZA"".  I really can't recommend this as a martial arts film but I can as a slice of kung fu nostalgia for old-school fans.  The casting was excellent and the acting, story, score, and direction were actually much better than I expected.  Sets & costumes were well done, too.  Really, everything but the action, which is kind of a big deal for this genre.

5213214,3,B0090SI42Y,"RZA (born Robert Fitzgerald Diggs,  aka Prince Rakeem, Bobby Digital, Bobby Steels , The Abbott, Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah, The Rzarector) is a Hip hop MC and influential producer best known for his work with Wu-Tang Clan.  Here he expands his influence by conceiving, writing, composing the musical score, directing and starring in this very strange movierama ,THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS.

Madame Blossom summarizes the plot by saying `Power belongs to no one, until it is seized through sex or violence.'  One critic was able to give the pan for the story as follows: `In Jungle Village, the leader of the Lion's clan Gold Lion is summoned by the Governor (Terence Yin) and assigned to protect his gold that will be transported through the village. However he is betrayed and murdered by the greedy Silver Lion (lawyer/actor Byron Mann) and Bronze Lion (Cung Le). Gold Lion's favorite son Zen Yi, a.k.a. The X-Blade (Korean American famous fashion model Rick Yune), seeks revenge and heads to Jungle Village, but he is defeated by Brass Body (Dave Bautista) and rescued by the local Blacksmith Thaddeus (RZA). Meanwhile the Gemini Female (Grace Huang) and the Gemini Male (Andrew Lin) protect the Governor's gold, but they are vanquished by the army of Silver and Bronze Lion. The Blacksmith is abducted by the Lions and has his arms severed by Brass Body. However he is saved by the British Jack Knife (Russell Crowe), who is the emissary of the Emperor, and he manufactures iron arms for Thaddeus. Meanwhile the Governor sends the Jackal army to fight against the Lions and they hide the gold in the brothel of Madam Blossom (Lucy Liu). However, Madam Blossom and his girls form an army of black widows and together with Jack, Zen Yi and The Blacksmith, they fight against the Lions.

Great costumes, extraordinary hair styles for men, pretty sets, flying action and blood blood blood are the main attractions here.  The story is supposedly set in feudal China but much of the dialogue and situations are very much of this decade. Filmed in Hong Kong and the US the characters are basically an Asian mix of what appears to be a cluster of American actors. One is left wondering how such people as Russell Crowe, Pam Grier (she plays RZA's mother) and Lucy Liu (and what did the publicized Quentin Tarantino do in this picture?) connected to this extended Oriental rap session. But in the end, if silly dialogue and absurd fights and lack of plot make for a colorful evening's escapist entertainment, then here it is.

5213264,1,B0090SI42Y,"One man's opinion - Let me start by saying I watch movies... a LOT of movies.  On a given week I can easily view 15-20 movies - being permanently disabled has given me a lot of time on my hands.  Secondly, I LOVE BAD MOVIES... not all bad movies, but generally speaking the cheesier the better.  I love it when a bad movie crosses that invisible line between simply terrible to a new paradigm - what I like to call ""So bad, it's good"".  Need an example, ""Battle Beyond the Stars"" or as I like to call it John Boy in Space!!!  It's terrible, it's wonderfully, joyfully, nay, tearfully terrible.  Watch virtually ANY Christopher Lee horror film from the 60s or 70s.  You probably get the picture so I'll move on.  I bought this supposedly ""Tarantino"" film expecting bad - I wasn't disappointed (in that).

It really didn't take very long to realize the only thing Quentin Tarantino had to do with this film was to make money off his name.  The filming of this movie had nothing of his quirkiness or well thought out scenes, none of his witty script-craft, and none of his skill in bringing a film to the silver screen.  What does appear on screen is a movie, poorly shot, poorly acted, poorly scripted, poorly organized, poorly scored.  The ""short of it"" in Texas parlance can be summed up thus - a hot mess, bless their hearts.

How could this huge mistake have happened you might ask yourself (I sure did).  When a film goes this far off the ranch you have to start with the basics - who wrote the film - they are ultimately responsible for what's presented.  The film was written by Robert Diggs (East Coast Rapper and Wu-Tang Clan leader) and Eli Roth (of 'Hostel' and 'Hostel:Part 2' fame (ya, I missed those two too)).  The film was directed by Diggs... and stars Diggs as well (or as he self-styled RZA - a moniker which in this movie's case should stand for Razzle (Dazzle) since the film has so little substance and so much flash).  Mr. Razzle Dazzle also was responsible for the soundtrack (I know, big surprise there too).  RZA was clearly over his head in every way imaginable, the writing is sluggish and uninspired, the directing is amateurish, the soundtrack commits the ultimate sin - its so poorly married to what's happening on screen it pulls you out of the movie, and the acting was flat.  I can almost forgive RZA for his performance and ever-present hip-hop / hood-inspired language (what direction is 'Norf' anyway?  That's right, I'm 'axing' you), but the deplorable job done by both once A-List stars Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu leaves much to the imagination (and what you fill in for their apparent lack of enthusiasm wasn't good).  Crowe would seem to be going the way of Marlon Brando (all the girth and half the talent) and Liu's performance is a text book example of how she has gone from Lucy Liu to Lucy Who?  If I could give the film no stars I would.  It's not worth the cardboard it came wrapped in.  I hope Tarantino enjoyed the cash given to borrow his name and I sincerely hope he actually reads the next script before cashing the check - in this business we call show, reputation is everything and this was most certainly NOT a Tarantino film.  One or two of these and his fan base will take a walk (I hope your listening Mr. Tarantino, I'm still a fan... for now).  In summary - Hot Mess, RZA=Razzle Dazzle, Lucy Who? and DON'T BUY THIS FILM, DON'T EVEN RENT IT - just walk away... run if you're able.

Bad movie, BAD movie - BAD MOVIE.  PS - Hollywood - DON'T GIVE RZA MONEY (unless you are looking for a tax write off, then it makes sense.)",1372204800,10,3580,4.449386503067485

5213290,3,B0090SI42Y,"As the first mainstream American kung fu movie to be produced in about ten years, I promised myself to see it. I wasn't sure what to make of its first-time director, but by and large I was excited for it. However, I ended up not getting to see the picture until recently, and by then, some trepidation had built up for me, based on the lukewarm reviews I had come across. I'm glad for them, because this would have been a pretty big letdown otherwise. ""The Man with the Iron Fists"" is an entertaining action flick and certainly not bad, but stylistic choices by the filmmakers hinder what could have been a very good adventure and dilute it to mere little more than a visually interesting time-killer.

The story: an assortment of warriors, assassins, and various deadly individuals - all in pursuit of treasure - descend on a small town overseen by a unique blacksmith (director and rap star Robert ""RZA"" Diggs)...

Director and leading man RZA is a hardcore fan of traditional kung fu flicks, and producer-in-spirit Quentin Tarantino is big on retro repackages. They have fine ideologies, but I'm fairly certain that the movie could have been made without being so ridiculously hokey. The cheesy opening titles, the recycled Shaw Bros. sound effects, the cartoon gore, and a good deal of the dialogue are constant reminders that the filmmakers didn't take their product very seriously, and I'm a bit resentful for it. Not only does this seem to act as a waiver for any technical shortcomings (see the unrated version, mainly), but all of this had already been done better a decade ago with Tarantino's own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill/dp/B007D5E7C2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill</a>. Guys, it's *okay* to fill a movie full of cool things; you don't have to account or apologize for it with comedy.

And there certainly is a good deal of cool things to be found here. Artistically, the movie is a success, with great sets and unique costumes. Many of the special weapons I had never seen before. The storyline is juicy, and it moves at a swift comic book pace that I find appealing. And the casting is, for the most part, full of winners. Rick Yune (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ninja-Assassin/dp/B0035V35P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ninja Assassin</a>) as a main hero, Lucy Liu as the deadly madam of a brothel, and ex-WWE star Dave Bautista as a monstrous enforcer - good. Byron Mann (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Street-Fighter/dp/B001L2ZSJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Street Fighter</a>) as the lead villain, Kwan Tai-Chen (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-5-Deadly-Venoms/dp/B00284G2BC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 5 Deadly Venoms</a>) as his ill-fated father, and MMA champ Cung Le as the former's main henchman - very good. David Wu (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Legend-of-the-Black-Scorpion/dp/B00104AYGK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Legend of the Black Scorpion</a>) as a creepy assassin and the singular Gordon Liu as the teacher of RZA's character - fantastic. RZA himself gives a much better performance than expected. I have no idea what Kurt Russell is doing in this movie, but in the end, his performance as the horny gunslinger is endearing.

Of course, the best action cast in the world is only as good as its action scenes, and disappointingly, I think these fights could have been better. They could have been a lot worse, of course, but considering the amount of talent involved and that they're wrangled by Corey Yuen - one of my favorite action coordinators - they definitely fall short of their potential. There isn't a single fight scene that I can point to as an example of a great cinematic brawl. Part of this is due to the style in which they're choreographed; I'm not a huge fan of wire-fu. Nevertheless, the wirework shows some ingenuity (e.g. the Gemini fight), and in the end, the biggest drawbacks of the brawls are that too few of them feature any amount of satisfying back & forth action and that too many of them feature an overabundance of slow motion and CGI enhancements. These are clearly supposed to be Hong Kong-styled fights, but come off more as Americanized Hong Kong knockoffs.

With that said, there are several good (not great) fights, among them the showdown between RZA and Bautista's characters, which is better than it has any right to be in my opinion. I think that's the best way to approach this movie - with low expectations, so that you're pleasantly surprised at the highlights and not too disappointed by the shortcomings. For his junior outing as both an actor and a director, RZA does a good job, but I think he was held back by both the ambitiousness of this project and the influence of the folks who were supporting him (read: writer-producer Eli Roth). I'd be interested in watching the sequel that's set up during the credits, but that one will have a lot it needs to build on if it's going to be better than this.",1371859200,,5109,5.341614906832298

In my opinion The Man With The Iron Fists is kind of a mixed bag. It's easy to fall in love with because it's obviously supposed to be over-the-top and cheesy, but at the same time nothing really feels memorable. To be honest I don't think I've actually seen a kung-fu movie so this is probably my first, but upon doing some research apparently what we see in The Man With The Iron Fists is pretty standard as far as martial arts films go.

The story is a little difficult to explain due to the fact that it lacks any sense of direction. Basically we start off with the leader of the Lion clan, Gold Lion, getting assassinated. This leaves his two subordinates, Silver Lion (Byron Mann) and Bronze Lion (Cung Le), to take his place as leaders of the clan. Gold Lion was a leader who believed in peace while Silver Lion has a lust for war. In an effort to eliminate all traces of Gold Lion, he sends assassins to eliminate Gold Lion's only son, Zen-Yi aka The X-Blade (Rick Yune).

After word got out that Gold Lion was assassinated, a mysterious man by the name of Jack Knife (Russell Crowe) arrives at Jungle Village. The viewer doesn't learn who he is or why he's there until the final 30 minutes or so. Until then he's staying at The Pink Blossom, a brothel run by Madam Blossom (Lucy Liu). Jack is probably one of my favorite characters because of his personality. He gives off this very calm, cool, collective vibe that Crowe does a wonderful job of pulling off. He's here for business and he doesn't have time to waste.

My main reason for seeing this was RZA. Up until now he's appeared in some small roles here and there, but The Man With The Iron Fist is the first time he's getting the chance to play a major character. RZA plays an unnamed blacksmith who makes weapons for the rival clans. He's not on any specific side, he's just trying to save up enough money so he can leave Jungle Village with Lady Silk (Jamie Chung), his girlfriend and a prostitute at the Pink Blossom. I think the goal was to make this blacksmith the main character, but any effort to pull that off was eliminated when he's absent for majority of the first half.

I think that's where I kind of got turned off. I enjoy films that follow a specific character/set of characters throughout the entire film. The Man With The Iron Fists is one of those films that jumps back and forth between multiple people. You have Silver Lion, Jack Knife, Madam Blossom, Brass Body (Dave Batista), and the blacksmith. Because there's so many key characters it's hard to form any sort of connection with any of them. That's not to say that they're all empty shells. On the contrary, I already mentioned my love for Jack, but Madam Blossom proves to be a pretty badass character and Brass Body (cheesy name aside) is interesting as well. The thing is that they only get brief spurts of screen time here and there which makes it hard to really care.

My biggest issues, however, were the special effects and the predictability of the story. There's a scene within the first five minutes where a man is being attacked by a pack of wolves against what appears to be a barn door. It's obvious that these ""wolves"" are as fake as they come. In fact, these effects are so bad that when it cuts to this scene the color scheme changes from dark and solid to light and washed out. Then the fake blood used throughout the movie is just awful. There's been movies where the fake blood looks like fake blood, but this didn't even resemble blood at all. Whenever there was a spurt of blood erupting from a mouth, stab wound, etc. it looked like cherry soda. Part of me feels that this was intentional just to add to the cheesiness, but either way it just didn't do it for me.

Then there was the story. Don't get me wrong, there were some things that I wasn't expecting, but majority of the time I said ""This is probably going to happen."" and sure enough it did. For example, there was a scene where the Lions stayed at The Pink Blossom and the women were ordered to ""entertain"" them. Right away I said ""Lady Silk is going to get Brass Body"". You wanna know what happened? Brass Body came into her room and wound up beating her to a pulp. I mean I understand that this is normal to include things like this because we've seen it done so many times in the past, but don't you think it's time that someone breaks the cycle?

What really drives this film though is the performances from the cast members. It's clear that RZA is still a developing actor so don't expect some breathtaking performance, but considering that this is his first major role he did a solid job. Russell Crowe gave a great performance as Jack which more than makes up for his lackluster effort in Broken City. Rick Yune and Lucy Lui gave great performances as well, as did David Bautista, Byron Mann, and Jamie Chung. A lot of great performances from a pretty well-rounded cast.

Overall Score: 6/10 - To be totally honest I expected more from The Man With The Iron Fists. From start to finish it felt really cluttered and directionless and the ending felt sudden and underwhelming. If you're a fan of kung-fu movies and you know what to expect then it would be very easy for me to recommend this to you. For everyone else I would advise you to go in with an open mind. While I personally can't say that I'll ever watch this again, I don't regret taking the time to experience it because when it's all said and done it was a nice ride.",1369699200,,5509,4.419704433497537

5213680,2,B0090SI42Y,"Rapper and wannabe actor RZA also directs and contributed to the screenplay (with Eli Roth) in this Tarantino endorsed throwback to `70's kung fooey movies.  RZA plays an under-the-radar metal smith in a Chinese province circa 1870.  He had escaped slavery with the help of his mother (Pam Grier) and hopped on a boat for China.  It sunk with everyone on board drowned but for Blacksmith as he is known.

His main job is to fabricate the unusual armament for the local thugs.  In a thin plot, a shipment of gold is being transported to the governor over land, protected by a top notch group of guardians.  Also interested in the gold is a mysterious caucasian named Jack Knife (a portly Russell Crowe) and the owner of the high end brothel, Madam Blossom (Lucy Liu).  Rick Yune plays one of the good guys known as The X-Blade because of his ability to fling various sharp instruments at his adversaries.  He's headed to the village as well to avenge his father's death at the hand of the aforementioned thugs.

Numerous battles take place always involving magical feats of jumping and suspension in midair.  Some of the weapons are admittedly pretty cool, but much of the action sequences are nothing special in this day and age of photo trickery.  Perhaps the most memorable sequences are the massive amounts of blood spurting during the fight scenes.

So here is an ""R"" rated, violent film that takes place largely in a whore house.  There are plenty of comely employees, who bathe together and have vigorous sex with their clients...all fully clothed!  RZA needs to take in a few episodes of TV's ""Gladiator"" or ""Game of Thrones"" to see how to mix decapitations with nudity and not miss a beat.",1368576000,,1697,4.708474576271186

The (C)rap music is a abomination and I had to mute it, which takes away from the overall film. The narrator cannot speak english very well and this deficit also hurts the movie. The rapper takes credit for directing and writing this movie, but I highly doubt it. Maybe he wrote a few words here or there, or perhaps he had a basic idea that he told to real writers, who made the script. The wire work during the fights is especially bad, to the point they seem to float through the air semiconscious. Drink about 6 beers or so (raise or lower the amount based on your tolerance) before you watch it and you will probably enjoy it.

I was kind of into it for a bit but in the middle it drags down, waaaaay down, when it inserts a ""poor me"" cliche slavery bit. After that bit it started some other exposition that was totally boring. This movie should have been all action and mystery. The Blacksmith, unexplained, was far more compelling when he was a mystery. They need to leave some of the backstory unexplained, so that your imagination fills in the details, and overwhelm us with groovy action and bloodshed! When they do that the viewer spends allot more time thinking about the movie (ie-the Clone Wars, mentioned in the first 3 Star Wars movies (chronologically, not the stupid episode numbers, the ones from the 70's and 80's); my imagination was supplying a far more interesting scenario than the one Lucas came up with)).

Streaming consistancy and Audio/Video quality was good in HD version.

My suggestion for a better movie somewhat similar to this would be an action/comedy called ""The Good, the Bad and the Weird"", currently on monthly streaming service, and a kung fu drama/parody called ""Kung Fu Hustle"", on dvd/rental. IMO, this movie sucked compared with those. Even a repeat viewing of ""Kill Bill"" or ""Smokin Aces"" would be better than this I think.",1368230400,2,686,4.652892561983471

I suppose the only reason I did was because I didn't want to come back to it. This wasn't just bad...it was shockingly bad. As in awful. Truly awful.

It was like this movie was trying to be a kung-fu movie, but was also trying to be modern, hip-hop, action, gory, fast paced, and just plain weird.  I think a 6th grader could have written a better story (from what I saw).  I have liked some of Tarantino's movies, but this one is a stinker.

I have to admit I'm surprised by the number of positive reviews, but that is probably because you also get the sense that this movie could have been a great movie if more time had been spent on fight planning and choreography. It does have the feel of a 70's movie but it would have been a bad one.

He actually did the score to the movie Ghost Dog years back, and that was a very cool movie with a tantalizing, thought stimulating sound.

The problem is I'm not really a big Kung Fu fan, but I had to see this because of Rza.  The fight scenes were certainly overkill, with blood squirting out like fire hydrants.  The sexual content was also overdone and distracting, unless your the type of person that enjoys porn.

I did like the Rza's character though.  Kind of a subdued, outsider with a good heart.  I thought it fit him well.  The back story was slightly corny, but it was very ill seeing him ultimately get taken in and trained by Buddhist monks.

5214494,3,B0090SI42Y,"First off, let me begin by saying that Rza did an ok job with what he had.  For a guy who had not directed a decent budget film, this was alright.  Now to break it down.

The basis of the story was there.  We had the feud between clans, the emperors gold that they were after, and your quiet hero (the blacksmith).  He developed the relationship between the blacksmith and the prostitute fairly well but there was nothing about how they met.  How could a blacksmith win the heart of the prostitute with a heart of gold when she is kept in the brothel all the time?  ALso, what is the origin of the bronze man?  We have no idea why he had Marvel hero like powers where his body can change to bronze when attacked.  In addition, Rza's narration was, most of the time, too low to hear and when we could hear, it was difficult to understand him at times.  Even during the film, his lines were muffled almost beyond recognition.  I had to rewind it to try to understand what he was saying.  Next time, get someone who has a background in narration that can portray your sentiment as the central character.

One small gripe I had is that it seemed like the times were not consistent.  At some points it looked as if this movie was set in the 1800s in the midst of slavery and some times it seemed like it could have been in the early 1900s (wardrobe, weapons, etc.)  I was confused at some points.

Continuing on, there was too much filler in this movie.  At some points there were just meaningless scenes that felt like music videos.  For example, there was about a 1-2 minute scene of the women in the brothel bathing themselves with no dialogue or anything.  It wasn't a segway, it was just a meaningless waste of film that had no bearing on the rest of the film.

In addition, the gore was way overdone.  You should not hear the sounds of the blood packs squirting out as the character removes the knife from your neck.  It seemed cheesy and just overly dramatic.  A continuation of this, make your effects consistent.  If you use CGI for your gore and blood spatter, use that throughout the film. Don't use blood packs for some fight scenes and CGI blood splatter for another, it makes for choppy non-uniform production.  At least Tarantino uses blood like substances throughout and keeps his films consistent.

So while my review is all over the place, I will sum up quickly.  While this film is not bad, it is not great either.  It sits quietly in the middle with its perks and its shortcomings.  I would like to see Rza refine his craft and give it another go, but the film just needs to be more comfortable with itself and not trying to live up to the name of its producer.  Rza has a nice vision of film and his story was there, but it just didn't develop completely for me.",1364169600,,2778,4.348249027237354

5214499,1,B0090SI42Y,"SPOILERS...  Well, the movie starts off rotten, so not much to spoil.

There was a point during the movie where I paused it to go the bathroom.  When I returned I simply could not bring myself to continue sitting through this excrement.  I'd gotten all the way through the part where the man with the iron fists becomes the man with the iron fists.

This movie is an insult to Kung Fu films, and to audiences everywhere.  It was made as the personal fantasy of Rza.  Russell Crow appears in it because he and Rza are buddies, from what I understand.

The dialog is awkward and flat.  The actions of the characters make little sense as they never come from any clear motives.  None of the characters reactions were natural for human beings.  Even the main character was a ridiculous contradiction.  Rather than achieving the ""flawed hero"" with the blacksmith character, you end up watching the confused idiot: I was a slave on a slave ship, but the ship wrecked and I was discovered by Shaolin monks (what?).  They made me sweep their monastery until I decided I wanted to learn Kung Fu (what?).  When I was ready, I went out to a small Chinese town to become a blacksmith and sell extremely well-made weapons to any who would pay for them (what?)  Then I fell for the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold (right) and decided later she was the reason I was making all those weapons (right).

The action is bad, jumpy, overly brutal, and apparently no matter how you cut a person, they're filled with cranberry preserves.

Lucy Liu was always smiling inappropriately, in every scene, and I know she has better instincts than that.  One can only assume she was directed to show that ""Oh, you"" grin when the bad guys were, between belches, boasting of how they were going to kill and torture people.

Surprisingly, even the music was awful and jarring during the fight scenes.  The assault on the ears and the sensibilities of anyone who likes Kung Fu films forced me to mute the movie after the first two or three fights.  This from the same guy who did such a fantastic job with the musical queues and clips for Kill Bill.

This wasn't even ironically or campy-bad.  It was just bad.  The Man With the Iron Fists is what you get when someone who shouldn't be allowed to make a movie gets to make a movie.",1364083200,4,2293,4.550122249388753

The movie has some promise but ultimately falls flat with its excessive fake blood and violent scenes.  It does have some beautiful scenery but ultimately the tribute seems to trend toward b movie territory instead of giving you something that you want to get deeply involved in.  For those fans of those old style movies, then you may enjoy more.  I was a Bruce Lee fan back in the day, but this version just doesn't translate into a classic.",1363910400,,559,4.450980392156863
5214571,2,B0090SI42Y,"Iron Fists' bloody and hyper real opening title sequence is perhaps the best evidence of what RZA had in mind when he started developing his love letter to East Asian cinema, and there's no denying the film's clever use of wirework and sublime imagery to sell that notion. The production's use of authentic Chinese locations also offers a sense of visual grandeur.

Where Iron Fists falls apart is in its contrived mythology. While it's obvious that RZA and co-writer Eli Roth spent a lot of time developing this complex universe filled with
warring clans, mystic ideologies and thorough backstories, none of those ever become fully realized over the course of the movie, even with the Unrated Edition's extended runtime. Instead of a restrained, balanced narrative, the director spends more time cramming in as many tributes to past works as he can, without establishing his own unique style. As a result, Iron Fists becomes less of a modern spin on a classic genre and more of a muddy, bombastic tribute video.
That's not to say the film isn't without SOME  entertainment value. Iron Fists' over-the-top fight sequences are among some of its strongest moments, and the choreography is, on the whole, impressive. Admittedly, RZA is probably the weakest link in terms of both fighting and acting. However, martial artists Rick Yune, Byron Mann and Cung Le add some credibility to the choreo, and Russell Crowe turns out a fun performance as the gunblade-slinger Jack Knife.

5214603,2,B0090SI42Y,"I must preface by saying that I like Kung Fu movies -- and I've seen my share of them. The Man with the Iron Fists has the body of a new style Chinese Martial Arts film like House of the Flying Daggers, the brains of Enter the Dragon, and the soul of Machete -- although it's not nearly as much fun as Robert Rodriquez's similar riff on the Mexican Gangster film. Fists isn't really a Chinese film at all, although plenty of the talent is from the Middle Kingdom, but instead is a re-envisioned fantasy of the Kung Fu genre through the eyes of Wu-Tang mastermind and rapper RZA. He wrote, directed, and starred.

There's a lot to like in this film (as a Kung Fu fan). The characters are pretty memorable in a comic book, kung fu, video game kind of way. They each have their own weapons, powers, and gimmicks. A few of them are even well acted (or over acted) like Russell Crowe's entertaining performance as Jack Knife or Lucy Liu as Black Widow. Many have bad hair.

RZA and his titular character forms the weakest link. He's just flat. His voice over is hard to understand and the rapper voice narrating Kung Fu feels totally out of place. But his music's good. And despite some nearly incoherent editing and minimal storytelling, the overall style is pretty decent.

The villains are pretty darn cheesy, particularly the heavy metal fright wig hair styles of the Lion Clan, but whatever, it's a campy almost spoof of the Kung Fu genre. It's gory as hell too, but despite numerous brothel scenes, strangely chaste (no nudity at all). Hmmm, there's that weird violence is better than sex thing. What gives? A big chunk of backstory on RZA's character shoved into the middle of the film is a total snooze-a-rama, but other than  that, the action scenes are exciting and the brothel scenes funny, so if you like the genre, go for it. Just remember, it's just no Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and not even up to the standards of Kung Fu Hustle.

In this movie, he is ferociously intense and powerful, but also funny.

5214642,3,B0090SI42Y,"This is a movie that will have a niche following and will have everyone else sitting there wondering what they just saw. The Man With The Iron Fists is entertaining. That's about the best that I can say about it.

Plot: Seriously disjointed. At an attempt to make the plot surprising and intriguing RZA overextended himself and created a ton of scenes that do not flow together at all. You can leave this film and come back 15 minutes later only to have the same ""what happened"" experience that everyone that sat through the entire movie will have.

Acting: This is probably one of the strong points in the film. Lucy Liu and Russell Crowe are both entertaining, even if Crowe is larger than life and his character is one of the awkward points in the story. RZA isn't terrible at acting in this film, but he seems like he doesn't fit well into his character's skin and it was very evident. He seems to have a half asleep expression throughout the film that's distracting and actually takes a lot away from his character.

Style and Visual Effects: You'll know 5 minutes into this film if this is something that you are interested in. The ""kung fu"" is exaggerated and about as far as you can get from what it would look like/be possible in real life - many punches never connect and many enemies go flying due to said punches. It is similar to kung fu hustle/warrior's way style, but taken another step in the direction of unbelievable.

Music: This was actually a strong point in this film. If nothing else if you know RZA's style and you enjoy the music then you'll like this soundtrack.

Overall: Entertaining, but I wouldn't watch it again. I feel like there was a lot of potential and talent in this film that wasn't tapped. RZA needs a more simple (it could have been very simple) story line to direct. He attempted to create a film that would surprise and awe the audience. Instead, he created a film that baffled and confused most viewers. Without making a lot of your own judgements on things (not always bad if the plot is explained well) the plot will make no sense at all.

With the expection of perhaps two or three of the main actors giving their all to roles they certainly knew were bad, there is really nothing I can say nice about this movie.

1. The story is aweful, that's putting it nicely because I could rant for an hour on how bad the story is alone.
2. The acting is just as bad.  The only saving grace is watching Byron Mann (Ryu from the first Street Fighter movie) play a ridiculous character.  To be fair, Russell Crowe and Rick Yune seemed to do their best at trying to save bad roles.
3. The music selection is distracting.  Choosing to play nearly incoherent rap over unexplained scenes that supposedly impact the story line does nothing but distract from whats going on.  In fact, there are entire sections of the film I can barely remember simply due to how disconnected the music was.
4. RZA, and everything about him.  I may be unfairly bashing RZA (the actor for the main role and director responsible for this travesty), but every part of his involvement in the movie is most notably horrible.  He can't act, period. When he is attempting to deliver dialouge he can barely be understood.  The costume wardrobe he has for most of the film would be laughable if it actually felt like it was intended to be a joke (he spends about half the film walking around a beat up Chinese village dressed like Ezio from the Assassin's Creed games). His atempts at fighting are pathetic, like watching kids with a camera play power rangers. All the decisions for the film were his responsibility as the director and therefore I can aim all my disappointment squarely at him.
5. All the combat scenes are bad.  I can appreciate the Tarantino style gore, but to actually do ""wire-fu"" this bad in a kung fu 'parody' goes beyond deliberate and into the realm of incompetent. The film could have been justified if all else were bad so long as it actually had engaging fight scenes (the movies it's based on were like that), but this movie fails on that most important ingrediant.
6. Lastly, it feels too long.  At only 95-107 minutes (depending on which version you watch), the movie itself is not long, but it is so filled with extranious backstories, worthless side stories and explanations, and forgettable if not unhearable dialouge that the movie just grinds on forever.

It's sad to see so many good names drug through the mud in this film.  Do not be fooled by the ""Tarantino Presents"", RZA was the director and main screenplay and story writer for this movie.  Knowing that films like this can be done right (see Kung Pow: Enter the Fist and Tarantino's own Kill Bill) and that expectations for this kind of movie really shouldn't be that high, it is a total shame to see a movie like this take money that could have been used for much more worthy projects.

5214771,4,B0090SI42Y,"""While some critics might disagree with me on this, The Man with the Iron Fists, in all its cheesy, ultra-violent glory makes a more conventional and surprisingly interesting effort than Kill Bill. Kill Bill, its sister film from the presenter of this film Quentin Tarantino, has its intriguing parts with anime and action but lacks a sense of direction and consistency.

Iron Fists' is Wu Tang Clan's the RZA's first effort and deals with a trio of three fighting spirits, one a blacksmith, one a neglected warrior, and one a sleazy traveler/assassin who tries to secure gold from a brigade of bandits. The film, in my opinion, is better than what the critics say which have often tend to lean negative or mixed on it. What it does strongly is provide a very wicked, superfluous sense of style and direction in its narrative and something compact and grand about its plot devices and action too. Yet, amid its pluses, lies a rather formulaic, occasionally ill-paced, uneven use of Mandarin and Cantonese with English, and sometimes forgettable film that can mostly go away out of your critical mind if watching it in the background and drinking beer with a few mates.

Thankfully, the never-seen-in-theaters DVD version expands more of its dense yet simple environment allows the audience more into the world of what the RZA pays homage to in terms of classic Asian martial arts cinema like Bruce Lee. Another nod to the RZA for trying to bring something wild and silly enough that it counteracts with the kind of same-old action movies these days that are full of white noise, like Taken 2, and lack a sense of uniqueness.

A word of advisory goes is those reading, please by all means do not take this film very seriously unless you are one who believes in the philosophies of the Wu Tang Clan or promote Buddhism, only at certain parts.""",1363305600,,1841,4.764890282131661

I love this girl, but her acting skills have plummeted over the years and she, quite frankly, gets lost in the clutter of this film.  I was hoping for her to pull out a total `Kill Bill' kind of crazy awesomeness and yet she's just there.  The stars of the film, Rick Yune and Byron Mann are just horrid.  I understand that this was RZA's attempt to pay homage to the Kung-Fu movies he loves, but he needed to modernize this, and not just in a trashy way.  He failed to pull this one off.

The effects are surprisingly good, especially the use of makeup, and Crowe is hilarious, channeling Jules Verne and frolicking with prostitutes (the scene where he's face down in a bathtub only to `poke' his finger at another girl and then get felt up by Liu was worth the price of admission here).

At the end of the day, this is kind of a mess.  Not kind of; it is a complete mess with very little to redeem it.  The storyline is clich and the production is tacky.  I hate saying this about a fill starring God himself, but I have to be honest.",1363305600,,1480,4.176678445229682

I hastily went to see this movie at the cinema because I saw director Quentin Tarantino's name on the promotional poster. Turns out, he didn't direct this movie, musician Rza did. The cast of this movie probably saved it from being downgraded into a ""rotten tomato"". I'm giving this movie a pass grade because the storyline is somewhat funny.

Take heed of the many 1/2-star reviews. If I had read them before going to the cinema, I could have saved over $8.50 (movie ticket) + $3.10 (medium-sized Pepsi).

However most importantly, we find the use of Quentin Tarantino's name immensely misleading as he had nothing to do with this film at all in terms of direction, writing, producing, etc. It is painfully obvious that RZA had nothing to show for his own skills and that if he hadn't attached Tarantino's name to his movie's intro, no one would have wanted to watch it.

5215033,1,B0090SI42Y,"When a movie is ""presented by"" Quentin Tarantino, written by the RZA and Eli Roth and stars Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu you have a right to at least expect it to resemble a professionally made film. The new would-be Wuxia epic the Man With the Iron Fists is like an amateur production ,a bastardized cross between a Shaw Brothers martial arts adventure and a feature length movie trailer. Full of hype and missed potential, this is no better than any random cheaply made direct-to-DVD movie without big names. In this case so much talent, equals so much waste.
 First time director RZA is a well known fan of classic martial arts films, his rap group the Wu Tang Clan used a great deal of wuxia imagery in their music, starting with their name. If RZA does in fact love the genre, this is a bad representation of that, treating the wuxia genre as little more than a joke, one that`s not funny either. In a post Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon-era, the desire to apologize for martial arts movies would seem to no longer be a needed defense.
 Wuxia, the current cool in thing for westerners to call the martial arts genre, in Chinese it means heroic or chivalrias martial arts stories.  Wuxia pictures have been around nearly as long as movies themselves, but only recently have they ascended to there rightful place in Western film culture. The genre is now excepted, with critically studies that have allowed the once ghettoized genre a well deserved appreciated,
 These movies share much in common with the American western, easterns if you will, and like the western many of the best folk tales told in their culture have unfold on film within this noble genre. It is also worth noting that a lot of these movies are nearly as good as the classic American westerns, especially the HK Shaw Brothers titles of the 60's and 70's and directors  such as Cheng Cheh, King Hu and Li Chuai Ling are comparable to the likes of Sam Peckinpah, John Sturges or Anthony Mann, Now we add this movie to the association, one that is not only an embarrassment, but an insult, the Man With the Iron Fists takes the accomplished merits back several decades.
 The script is ludicrous, jumbled, disoriented and rambling. Eli Roth came on board to help RZA form and finish his screenplay, I can't imagine he did a lot of  the finished work, while not a tremendous writer. Roth's work usually is far more creditable than this.
 The dialogue in the Man With the Iron Fist is excruciating, spoken with corny sincerity. This no doubt is meant to be ""homage"" to the old English dubbed kung fu epics of the past, now does that not sound like a mistake. It just doesn't work when the lips match up with these unspeakable lines of discourse.
 Russell Crowe adds class and credibility, which are otherwise sorely lacking. Crowe has top billing, but plays a rather thankless supporting role, but offers an occasional distraction from the rest of the frivolities. Crowe also has never looked so out of shape, with his full beard and middle age spreading he's starting to resemble Orson Welles. Just why did Crowe do this film, it's mind-boggling to think of such a talented actor and huge movie star wasting his offerings on this.
 Lucy Liu is likeably enthusiastic, but the role is under developed and she's left floundering. Part of the reason for this is that the whole movie is terribly misogynistic, the woman are all whores and are either treacherous or just merrily in the way, one character is both. Liu's presence will also no doubt make viewers recall the far superior Kill Bill.
 The rest of the cast is a liability, ""WWE superstar"" Dave Bautista once again shows he has no acting skills what so ever. UFC champ Cung Le is still failing at his attempts to be a movie star. Rick Yune and Jamie Chung have to little screen time to make much impact as token Asian heroes. Pam Grier, Gordon Liu and Chen Kuan-tai show up in pointless cameos that just remind you of better movies you could be watching. As an actor RZA is better than he is a director, but not noticeably so. Playing the film's title character and narrator, like his direction, RZA speaks a lot, but says little.
 Is it too much to ask for the Man With the Iron Fists  to at the very least be a fun guilty pleasure, but no such luck. The movie lacks any sort of post Tarantino-style of self aware humor, or any intentional humor at all. The film is too brutally gory for it's own good , it is also unnecessarily profane, which does not keep with the genre's traditions, but seems designed to appeal to the hip-hop crowd. It is all so predicable, terribly derivative and worst of all boring. It is a long ninety-six minutes when a martial arts movie lacks even the credibility of a Kung Fu Panda flick.
 Cheaply made and very much looking it, I have to seriously wonder if RZA's intentions were not to make a bad movie. If so, he has succeeded beyond his wildest dreams. This is not like Tarantino and Rodriguez's Grindhouse, which had a lot of fun making bad movies better. The Man With the Iron Fists manages to make good movies appear bad.
  In theory this movie should have rocked, but it does anything but. RZA proves to be a lousy writer, a half assed actor and worst no filmmaker. RZA allegedly spent some seven years trying to get this made and the original run time is said to have been four hours long, I do have to ponder if it was any more coherent, but glad I don`t have to find out.  .
 RZA does fill the movie with an effective audible soundtrack, from hip-hop numbers to Cantonese pop tunes, not to mention a nicely rousing score. The movie looks good, it's visually striking with clever editing and good photography, but lousy action sequences in a dull and unpleasant turkey. The tagline is that this puts the f.u. in kung fu, that's not clever, that's just being honest.

5215174,3,B0090SI42Y,"Being a Kung Fu flick fan that I am, I was excited when seeing previews on TV.  Wasn't able to see it in theaters, but was excited when it was available on video.  When I saw who handled it I thought ""Aww S***!  Here we go."".  It's the RZA's Homage to the classic Kung Fu flicks He loves.  This could be just be me, but I saw elements of Ninja Scroll in this flick.

I'll try to break this review down to the best of my abilities.

THE GOOD:

The characters were very creative. RZA is the skilled village black smith with story narration.  Russel Crowe as Mr. Knife was quite amusing.  His weapons were neat.  Lucy Lui owns/owns a brothel, but her true identity & intentions is reveiled towards the end.  Former wrestling star David Bautista as Brass Body.  Need I say more?  Rick Yune as X-Blade, a walking swiss army knife, so to speak.  Plus a few more.

The action was incredible.  At times, over the top with its numerous graphic scenes.  If all you care about is action, this movie would be up your alley.

THE BAD:

The plot.  Though there was one, it was scattered.  Highly unorganized.

Though this movie was capturing the spirit of the kung fu genre, it really isn't a Kung Fu movie.  The fight scenes didn't really display much kung fu in my opinion. The fight scenes were over the top, but not really kung fu.  I can see where kung fu fans had a hard time with this.

The editing, how can I put this, was SLOPPY.  What little kung fu that was displayed, was stunted due to the editing.
Fast editing cuts work, if done right.  At times, it made the movie look like a complete mess.

Then there's the RZA.  If he plans to star in a movie he directs, I would hope he'd spend extra time on his choreography in the future.  His fighting, or lack there of, was a kiddy pool filled with misery.  To make it worse, they tried to hide his handicap with special effects.

I don't how well it would've done without Tarantino's name slapped on it, but all and all I did enjoy the movie.  It's worth a watch.  RZA pays his respects to Kung Fu flicks in his own vision.  I have no issues adding it to my collection.  That being said I would strongly advise you rent it before you purchase it.",1362182400,,2190,4.240875912408759

I am a huge fan of the genre and have been for a long long time and this is just a god-aweful mess of a movie.  The martial arts are preformed and with the quick cut edits - you don't see anything.  The fights are terrible.  The characters and dialogue are terrible.  The costuming was nice and the backdrops looked great, but other than that - wow, this is a stinker of a film and I waited and watched everything about it since I first heard news of this getting made - thirsty for this flick and all I got was disappointment.

The cating is beter than most action flicks and Russell Crowe is big in this..I mean big in more ways than one.

Things that are better then this movie. An ice storm, the Dallas Cowboys winning the Super Bowl, Hitler being found alive, ""Batman & Robin,""  a dog licking itself.

Clearly Rza (is that short for something?) used this film as a vehicle to showcase his talents as both a director and actor. He may want to find a new career, I hear there's good money being a mime. I've seen better acting at a 3rd grade recital. Rza, it's called emotion and everytime you're on screen you seem to lack that. He does however convey a great sense of being stoned, which is what you might need to be in order to enjoy this film. I'll give him credit, he did get the most out out Batista a former WWE wrestler who's acting lit up the screen like a light bright from 1988. The greatest achiement would be that the makers of this film somehow managed to get Russel Crowe to agreee to do this film. A very FAT Russel Crowe, but the man non-the-less. Hopefully he was paid a heroes ransom to do this piece of steamy, stinky, dirty, and down right aweful piece of cinema waste. The studio who made this should give us our money back. If you want to watch this film may I suggest other ways to pass the time: playing in traffic, doing laundry, wrestling a cobra, sticking your hand down the garbage disposal, or even painting a house are all better ways to pass the time then watching this film. The sad part is that someone green lit this film to be made. Why?",1361836800,3,1450,4.3076923076923075
5215348,5,B0090SI42Y,The ratings I assign to a movie are based on environment.  Another person might have a different opinion.  Thats why there is freedom of choice.,1361836800,,144,4.72
5215349,4,B0090SI42Y,"With Quentin Tarantino's name attached to the film, The Man With the Iron Fists quickly became a must see for me. Tarantino isn't the producer or director but his name is attached to the film as a presenter. Anything with Tarantino's name attached in any capacity deserves a watch in my book.

The Man With the Iron Fists (2012, Universal Pictures)is a spoof of classic kung fu movies. The plot centers around a blacksmith (RZA) whose is working so he can earn enough money to leave his dangerous village. He gets wrapped up in a feud over gold between clans in the village. That's about all there is for the plot. It's pretty thin but does just enough to provide a vehicle for some great action.

And that action is what really shines in this movie. The pacing is swift, leaving very little time between action sequences. The action sequences themselves are some of the most satisfying I have seen in some time. RZA takes us back to the classic Kung Fu days with over the top, very stylized, floaty fight scenes. These scenes are enhanced by the unique weapons that various characters posses. It almost reminded me of Mortal Kombat with each character truly having different skill sets and weapons. Add in the wonderfully score also done by RZA and you get some very entertaining action scenes.

With that said, the time between action set pieces is where this movie suffered. We were left to sit through uninspiring dialogue which really took away from the experience. That is the one place I think RZA really needs to put in the work and where his friend Tarantino shines through. We also had to deal with sub par acting (particularly from RZA). I think he may have been better off just sticking to writing, directing, and scoring the movie.

Over all, the plusses far outweigh the negatives. I didn't go in expecting Oscar performances from RZA or Crowe, I came for the action and action we got. With practically non stop over the top gory action, set to hip hop music, there was definitely a lot to enjoy in this one. I highly recommend this to fans of classic kung fu as well as fans of Tarantino's.",1361836800,,2105,4.590425531914893

He was so NOT meant for that part.  But I watched it with my husband anyway and had to remind him that when someone dies from having there head cut off, the blood doesn't shoot out like a power hose all over a room cause the heart stops beating.

I will say one good thing about this movie, it had the feel of the old 80's black belt movies with the crane style against the drunken fist art... and i do realize that is what the movie aimed to do... however... it just fails.

RZA, lead rapper of Wu-Tang Clan, decided to be actor, narrator, director, screen writer and composer for this movie. It might not have been so bad if he had stayed off the screen. RZA, the man with the iron fist, is not leading man material. He can't act, the Asian actors spoke english better than him, and I spent the whole movie saying, ""Huh?, what did he say?"" The martial arts was mediocre and it's a shame talent such as Russell Crowe and Lucy Lu was wasted.

Lastly, the editing was poorly done.  The best thing about kung fu movies is the fight scene.  The fight scenes in this movie were too close and too quickly edited.  RZA attempted to go Old School in style but utilized new techniques in action sequences (which I find more distracting than entertaining.)  The music was well done.

The acting is expected from those involved at the level you would expect from each.  RZA's direction was better than his acting.  Overall, I enjoyed it for what it was, an action movie, but the plot was about as flaky as most old 1970's kung fu movies... The only thing missing to make this like one of those old school kung fu movies was a fight scene with people who weren't in the rest of the movie and didn't tie into the plot in anyway and an abrupt ending.",1361491200,,670,4.25984251968504

The RZA was just awful as the man with the iron fists, he was a craftsmen who had a pair of iron arms stuck onto his body and he fights like one.  Nothing about him says, it makes sense why I can keep up with these other bad mother's just by lugging a couple of arms that for all their ""part of him and alive"" theme, are just chunks of metal.  Coupled with the fact that other than enjoying girls and opium, Russel Crowe did almost nothing whatsoever.  Same with Lucy Liu and who the hell cares what the Lion boys were doing.

Russel Crowe, to me, was one of the very few people in the film that actually added some substance (Liu is always colorful).

The RZA decided to not only direct, which was hit and miss, I could see him improving, but he decided to star in the film.  Why exactly I would want to watch The RZA, who does not even sort of appear to know any form/s of martial arts have a decent amount of screen time fighting is beyond me.  Let's also just put out there that he may have written himself one of the most laugh out loudable all time back stories I have seen.  The music was very good during 90% of the movie so I won't comment on that really, I overall rather liked it.  Wish I could get my money back on this purchase though.  If I could give The RZA an idea of what would have fixed this movie it would be...don't cast yourself as the star and just stick to the action which was definitely this movies strong point.  I have mostly no complaints about that aspect.  Just was hoping for an average film from a technical standpoint with Kung Fu in it and did not get that.",1361404800,,1104,4.126168224299065

The names, plot devices, and even acting in every scene but the fighting scenes seemed like a high quality remake of something an 8 year old wrote and told his friends would be the greatest movie ever.

This brings me to the fight scenes though. They are the single redeemable feature of this film because they are well choreographed and in a very Tarantino style. Its everything I used to love from the bad kung-fu movies I watched as a kid, there are improbable weapons, unlikely magic/spirit based fighting powers, fighting stances of one can only assume great power that seem like they would only injure the fighter, and more. There is even the rampant, badly written, and only mildly terrifying sexual perversion of the character played by Russel Crow.

In summary, rent this if you need something to put on in the background of a party or while you work (at home, mind you. Incredibly NSFW.) Or consider renting it if you haven't seen a man have his arms ripped off in a while, but this movie is not worth owning, if only because that might encourage someone to make another movie like this in the future, and I cannot condone that for writing this poor.",1361145600,,1285,4.5344827586206895

I think if the movie had fewer characters, RZA could have focused on developing more of a story. Not to mention, there seems to be a lack of details plaguing the entire film. Like bad guys who could act, for instance. Bautista was the only bad guy who could act worth a damn and he barely spoke. This is sad, because that's not saying much as he's a goddamn WWE wrestler. attention to detail in all of the scenes tying the movie and story together was needed tbh. This movie could have and should have been better. This was supposedly the product of what the RZA learned after ""studying"" under Tarrantino. I mean WTF were you guys doing?

The CGI effects were mostly halfassed and mostly not needed. Bautista's brass body effect , for instance, could have been done much better or at least more sparingly with some imagination to greater effect.(I would have warned spoilers, but this turkey is already rotten)

The greatest crime to the cinema here was the sound track. At times the music just did not match what was happening on film. Instead of helping you immerse into a scene, it only further disconnects you and that's just bad. And I don't mean the hiphop; that stuff was actually good. I mean some of the other music was just wrong for the scenes they were placed in. I expected more than this from RZA.

All said and done. I hope RZA works on more movies and learns from this. I saw a movie I could have loved if it had been done right and I hope to see more that come closer in the future. This is a genre that needs help.",1361059200,9,1808,4.356083086053412

5216026,1,B0090SI42Y,"With a set up like this, why did I buy this film?
I purchased it because I am a fan of Russell's.

My only previous viewing of a film like this was Crouching Tiger which was a hit & I liked it
1. IF you hate rap music you will NOT like having to hit the mute button during THE LOAD rap music parts.  Terrible
2. Ok, Russell an Oscar winning actor.  What was he doing in this mess?  A favor to someone?  This is beneath him now-needs much better material.  It was his first film release in two years & it had to be this mess.
3.  Asian actors speaking English to themselves
4.  A small spoiler alert-a bad guy wearing SUNGLASSES?  Think there were cool in this time frame or something?

The story kept jumping around, hard to follow.

Let's get to the the blu ray.  Has an extra ""A Look Inside"" which since the film bombed with critics & at the box office So, the blu ray has this extra, but.......  IF you watch it do NOT unless you are a fan of this THREE LETTERS director.  It is NOT a making of or anything, it is 3 letters talking about him with BARELY any information on film.

Picture quality fine.

Unless you like kung fu films you will NOT like this film even if you are a fan of Russell's or Lucy Liu's.  Otherwise, the only names in the cast.",1361059200,,1253,4.069672131147541
5216027,5,B0090SI42Y,"I read so many negative reviews about the movie, so much so, that I almost didn't get this movie. Boy I'm glad I did.

First off, I don't know what the theatrical version is like, but the extended uncut version is awesome! Honestly it starts off okay. The acting is not so great. The fighting seemed bit rough on the edges. But I still felt the need to see it through. As the story progresses and other more important characters in the story come into play, the movie begins to come to life. I then realized what this movie is suppose to be, FUN & ENTERTAINING!

The plot is great. It's fun and very imaginative. I don't know what movie people watched when they gave this movie bad reviews. This nowhere near of being a bad movie at all. It has cult classic written all over. Maybe most critics were expecting a polished generic Hollywood action movie. This is not it folks. It is not comedy either. It is just simply imaginative, fun, and entertaining. But it does take time to mature.

I read somewhere that the blacksmith back story ruined the movie, because it was so far fetched. What? This is an awesome back story, it's so original. I mean who would have ever come up with something like that. It's brilliant.

I read a lot of criticism about Rza being a horrible actor, not having a face to play a lead role, rappers shouldn't be making movies, he overextends himself... Come on. Instead of focus on the fact that a rapper wrote, directed, composed, and starred in the movie focus on the movie. His acting fits perfectly with his character. The musical score was awesome. The directing wasn't that bad. The plot as I said was fun and imaginative.

This movie started out as a 3 but slowly became a solid 4.5. I appreciate the creativity of the movie and its characters. There are little details here and there that I'm sure on my second viewing it will become a solid 5. I think it's fresh and much needed in Hollywood today. This is not a Quentin Tarantino, it's not Kill Bill, so stop trying to find comparison.

I believe credit should be given where it is due, that's what compelled me to write this review.",1361059200,3,2119,4.448453608247423

5216092,2,B0090SI42Y,"The plot is their is an assignation of a king by one of his son's, the king has a huge treasure and everybody wants a piece.  There's way too many characters in this movie, and it tires to but backstories in for a lot of these, and they're okay but they take away from the main story.  and if you spend five to ten minutes telling backstories on these characters it just doesn't add up.

If you want a movie with a good story don't see this movie, but if want to see a movie with great fight choreography and lots of CGI blood then this is the movie for you.

There are good performance by Russell Crowe, Lucy Liu, and Byron Mann.  RZA is okay, but he's know leading man, I really care nothing for his character. I liked his backstory but it came way too late in the film, after I stopped caring for him.  The art direction is really good it does a lot with the color red.

I really wanted to like this movie I was so excited to see it, but I was just let down with the story and the way it was told, maybe with a different edit it would be tolerable, but for now it just ""meh"".

I would recommend certain fight scenes in the movie, and scenes with Russell Crowe, Lucy Liu, and Byron Mann, but not the whole movie.",1360972800,,1214,4.050209205020921
5216093,2,B0090SI42Y,"There were a few clever moments in this, but the picture overall was a bit of a disjointed mess.

I was not aware that it was going to be a hip-hop fighting show, which could have been interestingly stylized (Last Dragon, Samurai Champloo, Black Dynamite, etc.), but such was not the case. I love kung fu films, so was disappointed there were only a couple scenes that really had notable choreography (the yin-yang fight and Lucy Liu were cool). It felt like they kept picking facets of the project to focus on that ultimately did nothing to contribute to the film as a whole, such as story points that didn't matter, character development for someone that didn't motivate the story, etc. I could have forgiven even that if there had been more kung fu in the movie!",1360972800,,765,4.583941605839416
5216094,4,B0090SI42Y,"First in order to get 5 stars from me a movie has to walk on water.  If you like GungFu movies this is a must for you.  Blood spurting in the Tarantino style, Hip Hop Rhythm from RZA.  The show has the gritty feel of a Western, sprinkled with some Ang Lee comic book panels so it may appeal more to GungFu lovers from the West than from Asia famed more for their peaceful and flowing movements.  Although the movie attempts to balance the Yin and Yang it has more Yang and more Tiger than Dragon which is great and perfectly acceptable coming from the Chi of a male director. Great fight scenes with nice special effects make it a modern treat. I have to say it is much better than average and shows some symbolic tribute to the late Bruce Lee as well, so I felt a lot of thought definitely went into the screen play from a Western perspective as a tribute to the martial arts theater genre.  3 Stars for the non-GungFu fan, a solid 4-4.5 stars for a GungFu theater lover.  Thanks Quentin and RZA for an enjoyable show from a GungFu fan.  (Not for Kids)",1360886400,,1053,4.235
5216095,1,B0090SI42Y,"I was very surprised how choppy and inconsistent this movie was. Editing was choppy and the story really missed the mark in terms of presenting martial arts as the centerpiece. Action sequences were just all over the place and you could clearly see the wire works were sloppy. Why not just get bunch of people and make them run into each without doing anything physical? I didn't understand why Lucy Liu was speaking Chinese and then English while all other Chinese characters were speaking English such as the Lion Clan. Why is Russell Crowe in this movie? He rarely appears in the movie and all he does is whore around. In the end, I had to really think about the point of this film and I realized, oh yea, that dude wearing the spiky black suit was trying avenge his father's death. That basically drove the story, right? I think - still a bit confused. Definitely not worth the money. I'm just glad I didn't watch this at the theater.",1360886400,4,938,4.523529411764706

Other's are correct about it coming off looking and sounding like a 70s Kung Fu movie. The acting was horrible. Crow looked like he weighed in at a fat 250-260 pounds. All the bungy-cord jumping was just way over the top, and became just plain stupid after the first 10 minutes of the movie. Blah, I could go on and on about this movie, but what's the point?!

You have to take this movie as it is. A homage to 1960-70's Kung fu movies. This one was about various clans after gold and was quite enjoyable with the various types of characters in this one. If you like martial arts movies you will like it. I thought it had action,humor,and a few sad parts in it too. It was also nice to see actress Pam Grier(who was in Quentin tarentinos ""Jackie Brown "" movie making a cameo appearance as Rza mother. All in all an enjoyable movie.

5216192,1,B0090SI42Y,"I am not going to get into the story or plot because it really is not important...at all. The intended audience is for people who want to watch a kick ass movie with awesome kung fu fight scenes and they fail miserably at that. None of the characters have any charm or ""coolness"" about them that all classic kung fu movies have. Russell Crowe, is the only one with any grit or screen presence but even his notable acting chops and charisma can't elevate this sorry excuse of an action movie.

You know why people love old school kung fu movies? Because of the action, the stars that perform amazing kung fu moves, the wacky but charming stories/characters are always secondary to the action. We love action movies and if you give us this in spades, we will endure any plot holes, annoying characters, cheesy comedy bits, terrible dialogue and non-existent or plausible character development or twists.

There is too much wire fu and flashy, close up editing that robs the viewer of any appreciation of the physical skills or fight choreographed intricacies. We see lots of blood and gore (decapitations, mutilations, blood squirts, skull and knee smashing) but we hardly ever see any actual fighting! We see people fly (via obvious use of wires) on top of a table, yell, and then we see a semblance of limbs flailing around but mostly a close up an ugly face. That killed any leniency I had already built up before seeing this boring dreck of an action movie.

Would Jackie Chan be so loved if we never actually saw his death-defying stunts and brilliant fight scenes due to MTV ADD like editing? Would Bruce Lee be a movie star icon if we never saw his inhuman speed and power in its entirety? Or better yet would Van Damme be better regarded in his early days if they didn't constantly do a close up of his ass every time he threw his otherwise awesome kicks?

Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon had 10x the fight choreography and talent than this dreadful homage to the old school chop socky flicks. Kill Bill has 10x the charm and wit than this garbage.

The Raid: Redemption is the current king of modern martial arts movie for me and bonafide classic and a benchmark that all modern kung fu movies must aspire to...

this movie is like a generic mid-90's direct-to-video kung fu movie but a needlessly HUGE budget. This movie is not mindless fun...it is just mindless nothing less and definitely nothing more.",1360800000,4,2411,4.647887323943662

It's not one I'd run out and buy brand new right away.  It's not a great movie, but it's pretty good.  It does pull some influence from old 70s Kung Fu films, and there's definitely Tarrantino influence in this as well.  All in all it's good, but I wouldn't hurry out and buy it up right away.

5216200,5,B0090SI42Y,"I've never written a review, but it's high time for me to come out from the anonymous shadows of the internet and put my money where my mouth is. First and foremost, as if the star rating didn't give it away, I found this movie very enjoyable. However, I'm writing this review today not as praise for all its rights, but as a defense for all its wrongs. Many of the reviews I've read find the movie bland, flat, and without flare. However, given the genre it's heavily persuaded by, the American 70's kung-fu theater, this is an out and out homage to that time period and culture. The dialogue has been cited as ""terrible"", but honestly, who watched kung-fu movies for the dialogue? Yes, it sets the story and yes, it advances the plot, but generally most people are there to watch people beat the snot out of each other. Personally, I found the writing fine, but that's not what this review is about.

Another personal favorite of the less than positive reviews is pointing out the unimaginative scenery and characters. Jungle Village. Brass Body. However, again, this is a tribute to the kung-fu theater of yesteryear. Most of the poorly dubbed movies of that era suffered from extremely simple translations and thus had direct, to the point naming conventions. This is also why, as stated in the previous paragraph, the dialogue comes off as flat, or even overly acted with no substance. Again, a call back to the cinematic era it's referencing. To be honest, though, most Asian languages are very direct in their naming. For instance, Japan in Japanese is ""Nihon"", with ""Ni"" meaning sun and ""hon"" meaning source, so Japan, land of the rising sun. Get it?

Now, I've only seen a few references to this next particular issue, but I feel it must be addressed, and that is the soundtrack. Some have said the hip hop seems out of place and my only retort would be, ""Have any of you seen Samurai Champloo?"" That is a quintessential example of the perfect harmony between hip hop and the ancient Asian culture and I believe it works here as well.

I could go on and on, but I'm sure many of you have stopped reading or simply made up your own mind long ago and I wouldn't be able to sway you otherwise. However, for those that have trudged along this far, I implore you to watch this film with an open mind and a laid back attitude, appreciating for what it is: a homage to a simpler time in theater. This isn't a 13 Assassins or a Hero or a Zatoichi, this is a man professing his love to a cinema that he is so fond of. I tip my hat to thee, RZA.",1360713600,4,2544,4.431623931623932

This film is a throwback to the 60s and 70s Hong Kong films that have inspired many producers,directors and actors over the years. Those films were originally for the most part fantasies,some serious others not. Some could even be considered Chinese westerns. They made big stars out of many of the actors in their home countries. What we in North America saw was oft times poor,faded prints with horrible dubbings into English. They became a joke and the plots,to us,were mostly forgettable. They have been lampooned consistently over the years since. This film plays it all very straight but uses the same style as those old Hong Kong pictures. Unfortunately the story is as lame as any of the poorest Hong Kong films and drags interminably to the end.
The story finds the setting in China,in a time of feuding clans. The emperor has a shipment of gold traveling across the country and the head of the lion clan intends to protect it for him. However two of his underlings kill him and take over,and they scheme to steal the gold. Thrown into this mix is the son of the slain leader,X Blade,Jack Knife a mercenary British soldier who,with X Blade,converge on Jungle Town and meet up with a black,blacksmith,whose specialty is forging weapons of the finest calibre.
Since the lion clan is no longer in the picture the governor sends the Gemini squad to protect the gold. They arrive in the town with it and hunker down in the hotel/brothel run by Madam Blossom. The lion clan kill the Gemini`s and commandeer the gold. They also sever the blacksmiths arms,who ends up forging iron fists onto his stumps. He teams with Jack Knife and X Blade to try and take down the lion clan. The clan makes a deal with the madam,who has the gold in storage beneath the brothel. She knows its a promise they will never keep so she strikes back first by killing almost all of its members the night before they are to leave.
Arriving outside the city a platoon of well armed soldiers sent by the Emperor enters the town and are paused outside the brothel and ready to level it if the gold is not forthcoming. The three fight and defeat their enemies and Jack Knife,in the nick of time,appears to stop the soldiers from firing. The film ends as all three go their separate ways. In an epilogue X Blade`s wife is kidnapped by members of a bird clan and he must rescue her. He returns to the blacksmith for help.
As in the old Hong Kong films the fights usually don`t take much time to break out and this film is no different. It also uses those,now,cheesy stunts and close ups of faces distorted in rage to propel things along,like the old Hong Kong-ers(the memories just come flooding back!).When the fights resume in earnest near the end of the film at the climax,they now use a more modern style to stage them,with quick camera movement,action freezing and the like. In between we have this long and drawn out plot as each character and group are introduced. We even get back stories on some of the characters. One such borefest is the backdrop to the blacksmith`s story. As if things weren`t going slowly enough,they had to insert that story to slow things almost to a halt. If this film had been sending the entire Hong Kong genre up,or was doing it in a visually stylistic interpretation ala Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon,this film may have stood some chance of being half decent. As it is,to actually have the nerve to play this thing ``straight``,is to commit filmic suicide. Sorry Mr. Diggs,this is bad.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include deleted scenes and some featurettes. This disc also contains the theatrical AND the extended versions.
All in all a film that falls totally flat and into its Hong Kong rice bowl. If you,like I,were expecting a bit of imaginative tricks and style ala Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon,then think again. Just because it has Tarantino`s name attached,doesn`t mean it is on Tarantino`s level.",1360627200,,4256,4.783967391304348

Nothing like giving the up and coming Jeffery Dahmers of the world a little encouragement and a few more warped ideas.

This is violence for violence sake, and I found no entertainment value in it. In light of the rash of recent mass murder sprees peppering our psyches, you might think Tarantino or Universal would hold back this heap of violence vomit.

The movie is way over the top and unbelievable, but it fit in this movie. If you are looking for an Oscar worthy type martial arts movie then I recommend 13 Assassins or War Of Arrows. This movie is really just visually fun and the fighting is entertaining, which is good sometimes. I liked it more then I expected. Overall, better then anticipated, martial arts fans may really like this. I say B.",1360281600,,1057,4.343434343434343

As it is, we own every movie, television show, interview and album he is has ever done. [As a complete aside, his singing in Les Mis is much better than that on any of his albums, though the movie itself seems to have been shot by a monkey in the throws of seizures with one hand on the zoom controls.] This is not what one might consider a traditional later career Crowe movie. This is a fun movie that harkens back to 70's Kung Fu movies, reimagined, with digital effects, for a contemporary but cinematically-aware, audience. The point of this movie is not acting, dialogue or the finer points of continuity and razor keen narrative revelation: this is for people with metal skin, knife-guns and a porcupine-like amount of blades (not that porcupines carry blades, unless they grew up in a deeply troubled home, which one might also be able to tell by their white t-shirts rolled up at the shoulders, over a pack of cigarettes) to molest, murder and mutilate each other.
Over the top theatrics, operatic bouts of violence and slow motion--this is someone who watch many Shaw Brothers movie as well as John Woo's oeuvre and thought ""violence is cool.""
I must ding this two stars though for not being the best filmed action scenes ever. It does a disservice to those scenes as a matter of fact, with poor understanding of capturing the ballet of cinematic violence. I give it back one star because my wife would do terrible things with Ben-gay, Nair and Superglue to me in my sleep for awarding anything Russell has done with less than 4 stars.",1358294400,2,1655,4.613559322033899
5216520,4,B0090SI42Y,"I'm going to be straight with any and everyone who will read this. The movie is exactly what a fan of 70s Kung Fu should expect. When you watched Dance of The Drunken Mantis, did you expect a story of epic proportions or did you come for Sam Seed and great kung Fu?

When you saw Chinese Super Ninjas, did you know the story would be awesome or did you buy it because ""ninjas"" was in the title?

When you saw Kill Bill, did you go because you know Tarantino was involved even though Uma Thurman was never an action star?

The ideas of a kung fu movie are always similar. Revenge, saving someone or a group or village, or facing a rival clan or school.

I won't tell the story any more than anyone else, but if you can understand anything i've said so far, believe me that The Man with the Iron Fist is made in this same train of thought. It has a touch of revenge, mixed with the rise of a hero. I think it was well done, though RZA as a lead could've been performed by anyone with the basic abilities. Most surprising was David Batista as Brass Body. He is a very convincing and charasmatic villain, better than all the rest, in my opinion.

He played the villain very well.

If you don't want to own the movie, fine, but at least watch it once before making a final decision based on an opinion of any other person. Only you can know what you like for certain. I liked this movie, and will buy the movie either on dvd or on digital download. That's what matters to me.",1358208000,3,1470,4.158450704225352
5216521,1,B0090SI42Y,"I'm a huge fan of the old time kung fu movies. When I saw the trailer for Man With The Iron Fists it looked like a movie tailor made for me. Boy was I wrong.

I watched the first half of the movie before growing bored and wandering out of theater. During the many hours I spent watching the first half - or at least it seemed that long - I saw absolutely nothing to indicate that any actor or stunt-man appearing in the movie had ever had a martial arts lesson. Seriously, the fight choreography looked like what a bunch of school boys, with absolutely no martial arts background, might put together trying to copy what they saw in Kung fu Theater. Maybe there was some martial arts in the 2nd half of the movie, I didn't make it that far. I later learned that there were a couple real martial artists in this movie. Based on what I saw on the screen, I never would have figured that out.

What Iron Fist did have, in abundance, was lots and lots of bright red fluid. I couldn't begin to tell you how many limbs were severed in the first 15 minutes. There was one scene where one ""martial artist"" rips the arms off another ""martial artist"" using something that was possibly some kind of tiger style. There was a guy in a suit full of switchblades that does a lot of jumping and spinning and severing of arteries. There's also Russell Crowe who seems to know even less about fighting than the uncoordinated ""martial artists."" But he has a pair of scissors with a pistol grip that he uses to disembowel his clumsy opponents.

The sets and cinematography were first rate, impressive but not impressive enough to make up for the terrible writing, directing and fight choreography. The costumes looked like a lot of thought and a lot of money had gone into them. Iron Fist had a $20 million budget, and was shot in China where that kind of money will go pretty far. It's a shame that RZA didn't spring for a first rate choreographer. But it's also a shame that the movie wasn't better written and directed. The real shame of it is that all the ingredient to make a good kung fu movie were in place, the only thing missing was a recipe and someone who knew how to mix them.

If you're a fan of simulated blood, simulated amputations and simulated disembowelments - and couldn't care less if anyone on the screen could actually kick their way out of a paper bag - this is the movie for you. If you want to see some actual martial artists with real skill and real choreography, get yourself some Shaw Brothers kung fu DVDs and skip watching this steaming pile.",1357689600,20,2552,4.377637130801688

A good amount of gore, but it's not raining blood. Those movies put me off. No nudity, but a good deal of sexual situations. A little more character development would've been appreciated, as in I'm not really sure who the main character was. A really good performance from Russel Crowe, wasn't expecting it due to the type of film. Rick Yune did great as his character. Thought he was the main character until Crowe's showed up. But I think RZA was supposed to be the main character, which is really bad casting on his part. Just because you wrote and directed the film doesn't mean you have to star in it. He's not very built at all for the blacksmith character he's supposed to portray. He should've got someone else or hit the gym. Other than that, decent action flick.

5216583,2,B0090SI42Y,"Sometimes I just want to let myself go and watch mindless violence, blood, and gore.  Not the type in horror movies, but the action flicks of the Far East or the Italian western genre, like The Raid.  However I do like some story with this, not much of a story, but something.  Oh yes, I need to be able to hear and understand what the characters are saying, no matter how stupid it maybe.  You know the basics.

The Man with the Iron Fists has the mindless violence and yes the blood and the gore, but after that I don't know what the hell is going on.

We have a fat Russel Crowe who has a knife/gun thing and some very interesting moves in the bedroom.  He also has some very interesting ""tools"" he uses there too.  There is Lu who runs a cat house and is something of a woman's libber in China.  She does a lot with the ""wave"" of her hand.  There is this black man who is a blacksmith[huh?] who looses his ""touch with reality"" and then puts on metal hands.  Then there are the Asian gentlemen, one has deadly clothes[ I kid you not], another runs around with a very bad hair day, and some goofy guy with a blow gun. Oh yes the metal guy he was cool.

Mix in a lot of gold, crazy prositutes, a strange ""brother and sister"" act, and throw it up on the screen with current music and pray you have a movie.  Forget about a story that makes sense, or explains anything, forget about being able to hear the crappy dialogue, just sit back and watch the pretty people fly through the air, heads explode, throats ripped out, a flying eye ball or two.

5216584,3,B0090SI42Y,"Addison Smith (RZA) is a blacksmith in an anachronistic 19th century medieval Oriental village. His plan is to leave the area with his prostitute girlfriend Lady Silk (Jamie Chung) to whom he gives his money to put away for when they escape. There are two villages/ clans that are in battle with each other, the Lions and the Wolves who come complete with their own puns. The emperor asks the head of the Lions, Gold Lion (Kuan Tai Chen) to take a shipment of gold to a northern village as some sort of peace offering (plot isn't important in this film). He is betrayed and killed by his two deputies, Silver and Bronze Lion. I think you see where this naming thing is going...move over James Bond.

Zen Yi, The X-Blade (Rick Yune) decides to avenge his father's death while Silver Lion has declared war on the Wolf Clan and the Geminis escort the gold. To add to the confusion, Silver Lion has hired the impenetrable Brass Body (Dave Bautista) to hunt Zen Yi while Jack Knife (Russell Crowe) a British killer fortune seeker hangs out at the very colorful brothel called the Pink Blossom run by Madam Blossom (Lucy Liu).

This film includes a modern hip-hop sound track complete with MF and N words. The martial arts fighting ignores the laws of gravity. The blood squirts are over the top bright red. Zen Yi has spring loaded 8 inch spikes that pop out of 2 inches of armor. The fighting is extremely choreographed. Of course there is the signature Tarantino restaurant scene and split screen. No weird flashbacks. RZA didn't copy that. Worth a view for ""Kill Bill"" fans.

5216586,2,B0090SI42Y,"""The Man with the Iron Fists"" UGH O Lord, where should I begin? Let's start at the beginning, shall we? Two minutes in I was getting annoyed by the uncommitted execution of the opening scene. I won't bother with exposition, because if you've ever seen any of those old Kung-fu films, you've seen this one, only those were better-done. I actually thought I would have enjoyed this, because of Tarentino's affiliation, but, alas, no.

I wish RZA would not have narrated or acted in this. His English pronunciation is poor and his acting skills are non-existent. I prefer to hear ""news"" be pronounced ""nyoos"" not ""noos"". The character names are are a study in cliche: Lady Silk; Silver; Bronze. The action scenes are a less-inspired, poorly-choreographed and executed vision of those from ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", and the script in its entirety is mutably banal. What are fine actors like Crowe and Liu doing in a thing like this? I don't know.

I believe this is The RZA's first attempt at directing on this scale, and I bow to him for taking on such a painstaking job and bearing his soul to daggers more of which undoubtedly this movie will recieve. He's certainly done a greater job than I could have, but it was difficult to sit through this thing without groaning, sighing, falling asleep, turning it off. -Amuse4god",1355097600,2,1328,4.794759825327511
5216587,1,B0090SI42Y,"I REALLY wanted to like this movie, but I was groaning 5 minutes into it. Hats off to RZA for trying, but his obvious  love for the source material blind sided him into making  a uninspired, cliche ridden, badly choreographed , waste of  a opportunity.  Worst movie I saw all year. Tai Chi Zero was mush more fun and a better hommage to films  RZA referenced. Too bad.[[ASIN:B009VL2A5M Tai Chi Zero.)",1354665600,6,400,4.577464788732394
5216588,3,B0090SI42Y,"The Man With the Iron Fists is a movie that was 'presented' (not produced) by Quentin Tarantino and directed by RZA. It centers on the story of a black blacksmith in China, who is trying to leave his hostile home village that's entrenched in between good ol' clan wars.

If you are seeking to be entertained, look no further. RZA blends the 'hip-hop samurai' type of music and feel -- prevalent in a lot of anime in recent years -- with the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon-floating-around-style of fighting to create a high-flying (no pun intended) and adventurous parody of the genres with a Spaguetti Western flare. Needless to say, visually this movie is great in many respects.

However, beyond that, the movie suffers from more than a few noticeable stumbling points. The first being dialogue. Not only is the writing over-simplified, but the fact that some of the Chinese characters have Oriental-English accents while others speak perfectly clear English is something that will distract some viewers from the already simple plot. In addition, the main antagonist Silver Lion is portrayed as the funny one-liner villain, but there are times when his role feels overdone and out of place during the more serious scenes. Perhaps this harkens back to the older Kung-fu movie time other reviewers mentioned, but for me it was distracting.

Another caveat is the characters. They didn't feel very memorable, which is again probably due to the dialogue. The exception here is Russel Crowe's character, who exhibits wit, style, and the fact he sticks out like a sore thumb in a charming way. While I feel he did an extraordinary job in executing this role, I'm not exactly sure how his career will be affected in the long-run from this... You'll know what I mean.

Lastly, there were gaps in terms of the suspension of belief. While these types of movies are going to exhibit combat and visuals that are uncanny, a few of the developments toward the end, including one bad guy in particular, just felt like huge leaps of faith without any sort of explanation at all. I don't want to spoil anything, but again I think you'll know what I mean as you watch.

Now before I sound overly critical, let me tip my hat off to RZA. Not only did he direct the movie. He wrote it, helped compose the soundtrack, and starred as the blacksmith. This truly is RZA's movie in every sense of the phrase.

With so many responsibilities on one person, I can't help but critique this movie with admiration for it. It may not be on the Tarantino level, but if this is a beginning path for RZA I am excited to see what he comes up with next. Watch TMWTIF with the right expectations. If you're expecting Kill Bill or Pulp Fiction, take it down a good notch. If you're expecting a parody of exaggerated, oriental combat and hip-hop anime with Spaghuetti Western tropes, you're in for an entertaining ride. It's worth a watch, even if it doesn't etch itself into your soul.",1354492800,80,2947,4.723735408560311
5216589,2,B0090SI42Y,"The premise is thin, the action hits hard and fast, and it's completely popcornworthy. That said, I found it odd that accomplished actors like Lucy Liu and Russell Crowe appeared in this flick, but I guess everyone has bills to pay or a few days that you just don't want to take seriously.

So, here's the story. It's classical China. A shipment of gold is being sent to the hinterlands (cue the spaghetti western music). The Lion Clan, who mostly seem to have haircuts like Jareth from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Labyrinth/dp/B00000K3D4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Labyrinth</a>, have an internal power shift and decide the gold is theirs. A brave few stand against the bullies and (no suprise here) win the day. Throw in some wildly improbable weapons, remarkable gymnastics, and a pocketful of anachronisms, and you've pretty much got it. (Were those cuties of negotiable affection really wearing fishnets and hotpants in classical China?)

Given the general inanity, it shouldn't have annoyed me the three non-Asians in the flick had three of the four leading roles - of course, Liu filled that out. As in so many movies from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shangri-La/dp/B001ELDYOI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shangri-La</a>&nbsp;on, and even before that, the Asian majority consisted largely of spear-carriers (figuratively or not), and even Liu wasn't really one of the good guys. Well, at least there was one black among non-Asians: RZA who (incidentally) not only starred but wrote and directed as well.

Don't get your hopes up, and it's sure to exceed them.

5216590,5,B0090SI42Y,"fantastic movie! i saw a lot of very unique and fun kung fu ideas that could only come from a true movie fan such as the rza! there is a brass statue of a man that is in many movies as a training dummy for qi (chi) blocking attacks. in this movie there is the statue and a man with skin that can become brass at will, it links up toward the end in such a cool way i was blown away. i imagine the rza back in the 70's thinking ""what if someone had to fight the qi training statue? then they would be really f*&%ed!""

i could see where he deliberately paid homage to old kung fu films with some of the camera work, hair and acting styles, this kind of thing might look odd too someone who hasn't seen older kung fu movies as some of it seems corny or stilted (which is how those old movies are, something fans love!). but even so, they would get over it every time one of the AMAZING battles started.

at first the rap music came off as out of place. this is coming from a wu tang clan fan since the 36 chambers, and digital bullet is one of my favorite albums, but they're in ancient china and it's all hip hop style which doesn't really match up, but it grew on me very fast and by the end i was bobbing my head to the beats and enjoying them with the fight scenes. i grew up listening to wu tang, and rza always puts cuts from classic kung fu movies in his music. it's really cool hearing them and then, years later, stumbling over the same lines or music while watching the movie they're from without knowing it ahead of time. it's like: ""why do i recognize this? i've never seen this movie... oh yeah! wu tang!"" this was the exact opposite of that and it worked pretty well! i'm watching a kung fu movie and thinking ""wait a minute, i know that song!""

and the story? phenomenal! really fun stuff going on and lots of surprises. russel crow is a riot in this movie. i was thoroughly entertained. i love buddhism, kung fu, and i dig the rza's music so the scene at the buddhist temple had me smiling from ear to ear.
