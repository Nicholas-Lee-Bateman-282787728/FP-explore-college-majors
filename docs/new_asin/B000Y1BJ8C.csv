8230716,5,B000Y1BJ8C,The DVD is practical and the book helps follow the lesson. I'm enjoying his teaching style. Great help in expanding your knowledge of playing lead guitar.,1368057600,2,154,4.961538461538462
8230717,4,B000Y1BJ8C,"Fred does a decent job of going through how to build solos around chords.  You can also just jam along with him if you get to a spot that you are comfortable with the theory that he is showing.
It's not a complete guide to soloing around chord structures, but it's definitely a good primer on getting started.  Fred also shows some licks that can be used with the chords and used just as fills here and there.
Freds teaching style is laid back than  some teachers, and I liked that approach.",1368057600,2,491,4.315217391304348
8230718,5,B000Y1BJ8C,"This is an excellent advanced intermediate instruction DVD.  If you have not learned the concept of playing lead around chords, then this is for you.  I have to say that Fred's style and song choices are not in alignment with mine, but that is not the point here.  The songs are simply a vehicle for getting information across.  And Fred gets many great concepts across very quickly.  I have watched this DVD many times, and it has helped me improve a lot.",1363996800,,456,4.512195121951219
8230719,4,B000Y1BJ8C,I've watched a few of Fred's videos.  I like the videos and the printed booklets that come with them.  His laid back teaching style is nice and helps learn at a good pace.,1280707200,,171,4.151515151515151
8230720,1,B000Y1BJ8C,"The short, to the point review of this product is this: If you don't have fat fingers don't buy it. The first thing this guy says is that his fingers are fat so he can push down two strings at a time with the tip of one finger. He then teaches assuming everyone else can do that. Well, it seems me and my skinny fingers are out of luck on this one.  We can't all play like Fat Fingers Fred. If you HAVE fat fingers and can play these chords the way Fred teaches.... well, in my opinion, the song choices are so old and outdated that its still not worth the money. Order the book and CD entitled Chord Tone Soloing by Barrett Tagliarino. You will be much happier, and you'll save a few bucks as well.",1268006400,3,699,4.065217391304348
8230721,5,B000Y1BJ8C,The best introduction to lead guitar I've ever seen! Fred breaks everything down and makes it simple for anyone to follow. If you are a rhythm guitarist who wants to learn how to play lead guitar... this is the guitar video for you!,1209427200,2,232,4.4186046511627906
8230722,5,B000Y1BJ8C,"I've tried quite a few guitar instruction DVDs, and this one is among the best.  Too often teachers rush through licks and chords, leaving me breathless and reaching for the pause button.  Not Fred! I won't say I never paused the video, but I was never forced to do so.  Fred moves the lesson along, but he always takes the time to show you how to play the chord and the lick.  Also, there is a lot of really useful stuff here.  I learned A LOT from this DVD!",1204329600,4,459,4.112359550561798
8230723,5,B000Y1BJ8C,"I've always played rhythm guitar, but recently I've tried to learn how lead guitarists get a full, melodic sound for backups and solos, not just in blues, but in pop, R&B, and country. I had no luck until this DVD. Fred Sokolow shows you how to play lead guitar all over the fretboard using the basic chord shapes: D, A and F. Instead of playing scales in one position, you move with the chord changes, and the notes you want are all right there. The video moves at a leisurely pace with Fred teaching a small, manageable lesson. Then he and his son Zach play a tune illlustrating the lesson, while you try to play along. I think this video is great for rhythm players who want to expand their abilities.",1202428800,3,704,4.3816793893129775
