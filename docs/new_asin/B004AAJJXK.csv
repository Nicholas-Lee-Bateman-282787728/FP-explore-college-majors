8419887,4,B004AAJJXK,The comedic situations are hilarious (while the dramatic ones are overtly melodramatic) and the actors mostly do a great job. Juhi Chawla and Ketki Dave steal the show with their natural comedic abilities. Asrani is great as the sympathetic film buff boss. Govinda too is likable. He and Juhi are great as the ideal neighbour. I would have liked to see Tabu do more comedy but she's stuck with a serious role of which she does nothing short of a decent job. Even Johnny Lever (whom I find intolerable in almost every other movie) is enjoyable (though his character is hateful). A relative newcomer Isha Koppikar has a refreshing screen presence and holds her own while Chandrachur Singh and Vinay Anand are quite annoying.,1302480000,,722,4.830645161290323
