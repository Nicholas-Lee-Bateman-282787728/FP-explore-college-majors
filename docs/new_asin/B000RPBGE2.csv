2873309,5,B000RPBGE2,"I've wondered about this dvd for so long, knowing that everything is being put on dvd now ... I was sooo excited when i saw this ""I Love It"". I don't really care about the bad acting or whatever, it's the story and the thought of the entire plot that's exciting, especialy knowing the results toward the end of the show.

I think it's awesome and i can't wait to get it.",1184198400,11,370,4.138888888888889
2873310,5,B000RPBGE2,"I've been waiting for a few years for this show to be put on DVD. I was staring to lose hope but boy was I surprised to find that they're finally doing it. I certainly hope they come out with all of the seasons eventually especially since the first season is the shortest of the four. Either way, I'll sure be happy to own at least one season.",1183852800,12,343,4.0588235294117645

2873312,2,B000RPBGE2,"I was expecting something that exiting, not boring. I watched after taking a nap, and fall back to sleep within 15 mins.",1383091200,,120,4.5
2873313,5,B000RPBGE2,"I only got to see about 2-3 episodes on tv about 15 years ago when it was on and really liked it, so was very happy when I was able to buy the season 1 online from Amazon.",1377302400,,171,3.526315789473684
2873314,3,B000RPBGE2,"Not a bad show here where you are presented with 4 stories in each episode, stories presented in a ""Unsolved Mysteries"" fashion, however the twist is, at the end of the show they reveal which stories where true, and which ones they made up. Presented by James Brolin, you just sit back, watch some short stories in a Tale From the Crypt or Freddy's Nightmares sort of venture and wait for the end results. Need that be repeated again than what I already have?

The first few episodes of season 1 where OK, they where believable, but then I suspect the show ran out of factual stories to tell, because they start to claim some stories that did not happen, actually happened. A few episodes towards the end of the season, like a dog coming back from the grave, a kid who comes back to life hours after he is pronounced dead because his sister brought his corpse his favorite teddy bear, or a deceased man emailing a firm to tell them that the woman who is claiming his inheritance is not his niece... those things did NOT happen. Yet, the show is trying to make believers out of people. Sorry, but stories like these would make headlines, Guinness world record entries, have fans devoted to it, or simply have proof and evidence that they had occurred. A few other ghostly stories that they tell about in this show they claim happened too, yet, still, after hundreds of years, there is still no solid proof of any form of life after death. Every video you claim you have watched and beleive it's a ghost, it can be explained factually how someone very much alive and breathing pulled it off, and those who claim they have seen ghosts, get checked out for a mental illness, or accept that you probably worked yourself up so much being afraid, you created it in your mind... or confused reality with dream. Because no matter what you say, no life after death incidence has ever occurred, and why would ghosts be seen wearing clothing? Why would material have an afterlife?

This is why I lost interest in the show, because it was claiming stories really had happened and there is no possible way they did, even mysteriously. A mother and daughter where buries together in the same tomb, and the girl goes nuts every night till the mother is removed? OK, so, who was actually around to whiteness the doors shaking? No one was around on the footage, so why would there be any witness? Not to mention, it's pretty obvious which stories they will tell you are true and which are not... most of the true ones are boring and end suddenly with no finale or interesting twist, it's just... oh, this girl speaks to a ghost, or is she clairvoyant and can predict the future? She claims it's her imaginary friend, and her mom tells her to stop talking to them, but she doesn't, she puts it to sleep in her drawer... the end.... WTF? Must be true, because they cut it off so abruptly. Then there is the story of a woman who falls off a tractor, her grandfather in a wheel chair suddenly finds the strength to stand up and run to her aid before the tractor squashes her while she is unconscious. In his last moments his legs work, he stops the tractor and dies on the other side of her where he must have walked to, not fell like shown, and when she wakes up, having not witnessed the incident... she knows he must have gained control of his legs with will power to save her.... of coarse, this story was fiction, and the writers didn't do a great job of hiding it.... In other words, their results are obvious, but no doubt, they are lying about which ones are true. Or REALLY stretching the truth about a simmilar incident that didn't happen quite like the way they have told it. Which is why I lost interest by the end of the 1st season. It was interesting for a while, but when you start making up your own truths to try and deceive an audience for ratings, well, shame on you Dick Clark.",1361577600,,3875,4.42577030812325

2873318,5,B000RPBGE2,I was not aware they had this on dvd as i've looked for it before and could not locate it. I loved this show was very disappointed when they canceled it. I got my family hooked on watching it as well we used to make dollar bets and keep score of which tales where fact or fiction and the one with the most accurate guess would win the dollar pot(i never won)we all loved this show and would look forward to it coming on even my greatnephew got into it and he was only 4 at the time. Very pleased that it is out on dvd really hope the complete seasons are offered soon.,1336694400,,568,3.991228070175439
2873319,5,B000RPBGE2,"Years ago the Sci-Fi channel was carrying this show and I made a point to watch this program. The host would introduce five stories. Some of the stories were true
(Fact), some of the stories were made up (Fiction). It was on the viewer to try
and determine which stories were true or false. I would do that and it was surprising which stories were true. I was happy to see it on DVD. The DVD was good and the quality was excellent. I have one request: Please put all seasons of this show on DVD. That would make me happy.",1321315200,,521,4.1683168316831685
2873320,4,B000RPBGE2,My only complaint about this set is that it's shipped with two DVD's and each DVD has a regular sized jewel case. It's only six episodes so they could have easily fit those two DVD's into one case. They probably wanted to give unsuspecting buyers the impression that the complete first season was not six episodes by making the set look bigger than it should be. It's nothing but a waste of plastic.,1312588800,,399,4.47945205479452

2873325,3,B000RPBGE2,"I don't get the point of releasing this on DVD.  The whole point is to watch the different short stories and guess which of them are fact and which are fiction, but if you watch it once you will know the answers.  This makes owning the series pointless because you will always know which kills the suspense factor.",1280534400,,314,4.396551724137931

Who ever cancelled this show was clearly insane, because any normal person would have NEVER cancelled such a good show.

Anyways the main purpose of this show is show you stories and you have to decide whether they are based on true events or are made up. They show you 5 stories per episode. The only thing I don't like is that sometimes im like ""wow that was probably real"" and then they say it is ""fiction"".Other than that im happy with my purchase. 12 dvd's for $26.99 and free shipping. WOW You cannot go wrong with that. I should of bought some more as christmas presents!",1224460800,2,618,4.201680672268908

This is SO AWESOME!!!!!!!!!",1220140800,,359,4.217391304347826
2873334,4,B000RPBGE2,"This was my favorite show in the world--when I was in fifth grade. It's fun, even if most of the stories are kind of predictable, and the guessing aspect makes it great to watch in groups. However, even in fifth grade some of the stories they claimed to be ""fact"" were kind of sketchy. For example, there was at least one where all the supernatural stuff happened to one guy when he was alone, and it killed him, so how could anybody know what happened to him right before he died? There's no source whatsoever they could have gotten that story from. The ""fact"" stories are about as ""fact"" as any other urban legend that technically has some basis in fact. Still, both 'fact' and 'fiction' stories were very engaging, sometimes the twist was actually clever, and you'll have a large store of scary stories for camping trips.",1217376000,,824,4.574324324324325
2873335,5,B000RPBGE2,FOR THOSE WHO LOVE TO PLAY THE GUESSING GAME I LOVE THIS SERIES TO BAD THEY DIDN'T HAVE SEASON 2 THE STORIES KEEP YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT SEEING THEY ARE MYSTERIOUS AND IT'S UP TO YOU TO GUESS WHICH ONE'S ARE FACT OR FICTION.,1213228800,,230,3.9148936170212765
2873336,5,B000RPBGE2,"I remember watching this with my family years ago after dinner. We would all be riveted to the screen and debate which episodes were fake and which were true. It was truly fun speculating and then finding out that some of the episodes we thought really happened turned out to be fake!

The first season is good, though i must say i didn't care for James Brolin as the host. Jonathan Frakes did a much better job in the following seasons. I hope they will release the remaining seasons on DVD soon. Also, this is a value buy for the price offered here.

If you're a fan of the paranormal/supernatural and love a good mystery, then this show is for you. The acting is not great, but not that bad either [compared to some contemporary paranormal series]. The sets and locales are well done on the whole. Good, spooky fun!",1210809600,4,818,4.446666666666666

2873338,5,B000RPBGE2,Beyond Belief is a show that really knows how to play with people's minds. Some of the stories that turn out to be true really mess with your head. The show has eerie music and nice of lot plot twists so if you've neevr seen the show check it out. I almost postive it'll run a chill down your spine.,1207008000,,299,4.0
2873339,5,B000RPBGE2,"This was a terrific show!! I wish it were still on the air! Why did it get taken off?! Seems they don't want good shows on TV nowadays!
This was a very creepy, unique show.
For anyone interested in the paranormal and the unexplained, you will love this!

Now bring on the rest of the seasons on dvd! I can't wait!",1203897600,2,313,4.131147540983607
2873340,3,B000RPBGE2,"I see that quite a few people gave this series five stars so why did I rate this with three? Quite frankly, the premise of the show is kind of cool - you're presented with several stories and you have to guess which ones are fact, and which are fiction. Some of the stories are quite good, but there are also quite a few that are pretty lame.

The first season features James Brolin as the host - maybe it's just my personal preference, but his acting is pretty stiff and he seems like he's just doing this show until something better comes along - hence, his presence for only a single season.

The quality of the filming is lacking as is the acting in most of the stories. It could've been done much, much better - but wasn't - they did this on the cheap, making it almost feel like some sort of 'reality' show to fill a time slot during a writer's strike (perhaps the same people that do American Gladiators did this series).

For the filming, acting, and the James Brolin cardboard standup character, I can only give this series (first season) three stars. I've had to struggle to watch this thing and half the time, I get bored and move on to better stuff. Ho hum",1202860800,6,1168,4.3
2873341,5,B000RPBGE2,"(The other being I Love Lucy, so they're hardly comparable!) ;)

I prayed for years for this show to be released on DVD; at last, it has happened. I do hope the other three seasons (the longer, Frakes-hosted ones) come out soon as well. I disagree with those who say that the acting or writing in this show is poor. Everything about it, in my opinion, is just perfect. If you are interested in the paranormal and/or enjoy other shows about amazing stories, you should fall in love with Beyond Belief as I did years ago. Each episode contains five stories. Each one, whether it turns out to have been inspired by fact or pure fiction, is memorable-its setting, its actors/characters, and its events. Since the days when I wrote down every episode and story after it aired and whether or not my fact/fiction guesses were correct, I have treasured this show...and I now consider myself an expert on it! I give the show (including its first season of six Brolin-hosted episodes, which is what this DVD set consists of) ten stars out of five! The remaining seasons have thirteen eps apiece.
