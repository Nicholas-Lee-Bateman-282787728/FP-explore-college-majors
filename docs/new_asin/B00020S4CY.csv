8019666,5,B00020S4CY,"The reviewer ""couch tomato"" evidently had not a clue what he/she/it was buying. This is nothing more, and nothing less, than NASA video in DVD resolution from multiple launch views, multiple landing views, and several EVAs for the Hubble repair activities.

This is cinema verite. You are there watching. There is no narration, apart from any conversation transpiring between the orbiter crew and mission control.

This is exactly what I expected it to be. And it was very interesting to watch, especially the launch sequence on a very large screen (digital projection, 168"") with the sound system turned up. Raised the roof. Many visitors were more than a little impressed watching this.

Also, this is apparently somewhat rare, in that there are no other DVDs available of extended footage from any shuttle missions. Just this DVD.",1141516800,4,833,5.110294117647059
8019667,1,B00020S4CY,Main feature + extra's are bad: scenes end abruptly; the story line is poor; background music is annoying; explanation to scenes insufficient ... DO NOT BUY!!,1088467200,,158,5.115384615384615
8019668,5,B00020S4CY,"This 2-hour-plus disc from Spacecraft Films chronicles the ""Columbia"" Space Shuttle mission of March 2002.
At 6:22 A.M. (EST) on March 1, 2002, the Shuttle ""Columbia"" lifted off from Pad 39-A at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on a mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope.  This beautiful dawn launch can be viewed from multiple angles on this DVD. This disc also has several views of the Shuttle's nighttime landing (on March 12, 2002).
Sadly, this mission (designated ""STS-109"") was Columbia's final COMPLETED space flight.  This very same Shuttle Orbiter was lost on February 1, 2003 (as ""STS-107""), in the tragic accident that claimed the lives of its seven crew members.
This DVD includes a thorough 44-minute narrated ""Main Program"", highlighting the STS-109 mission.  Plus: the disc contains Sub-Menus for the various ""EVA"" spacewalks that were made by Columbia's crew during the flight in orbit.  Video quality is very clear, as is the audio.  Aspect ratio for all video on the disc is Full Frame (Standard 1.33:1).
My favorite portion of this DVD is the ""Main Launch"" chapter, which runs for 16+ minutes.  This Launch Chapter begins approximately 7 minutes prior to the Shuttle's stunning crack-of-dawn lift-off.
The ""Main Landing"" Chapter runs for exactly 5 minutes.  There's also an 18-minute ""Post-Landing Press Conference"" included, which has Columbia's crew members talking about the mission they had just completed, and taking questions from the press.
Another very nice bonus on this DVD is a vast Photo Gallery (""Slideshow""), which contains well over 100 still photos from all phases of the STS-109 mission, including some gorgeous pics of the launch.
This disc, from Spacecraft Film's ""Shuttle Mission Log"" series of DVDs, is a very unique type of program, allowing the viewer to practically ride right along with the Columbia astronauts, as we take an up-close, first-hand look at this Shuttle flight from beginning to end -- from the launch, to the many spacewalks, to the perfect landing, and even to the crew's comments after the mission.
If you like stuff about the American space program, then this Spacecraft Films' DVD should satisfy very nicely.",1085616000,12,2182,5.181818181818182
