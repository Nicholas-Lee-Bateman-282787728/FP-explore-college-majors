8243808,3,B00124SNNE,"I am a huge fan but suggest you pick another volume unless you are obsessive-compulsive and just have to have them all. The back drop was different from the familiar WSM venue, so it was likely taped with less advanced equipment and it shows in the picture quality.
The real fly in the ointment though is the repetition of 2 numbers ""On the Rock Where Moses Stood"" with the usual ensemble plus Hi-Lo Brown and ""I've Waited As Long As I Can"" featuring Hi-Lo Brown.
There were two pieces featuring Paul Warren with good camera angles of his fingers on the neck of his fiddle. And, Uncle Josh played Bass in the back-ground on one of the versions of ""On the Rock Where Moses Stood"". Earl Scruggs does two guitar numbers that stand out. But over-all unless you have money burning through your pockets, pick some other sessions.",1268697600,,823,4.5675675675675675

You also can see a great model of how a bluegrass band can perform, if you happen to be polishing your own band and want some tips on stage presentation.",1225152000,,314,4.338983050847458
8243810,5,B00124SNNE,"I have all six of the Flatt and Scruggs TV series.  These shows are priceless.  Lester Flatt set the stage for all bluegrassers and the way they conduct their stage performances.  He was an excellent MC.  Earl Scruggs is the perfect complement to Lester.  An excellent musician and baratone singer, Mr Scruggs is still recording even to this day.  I have met Mr Scruggs recently and he is a real gentleman.  Both of these guys are icons in the world of bluegrass and acoustic music. I look foward to additional dvd's in this series. I remember seeing many of these tv shows when they aired the first time!!",1212019200,,606,4.555555555555555
