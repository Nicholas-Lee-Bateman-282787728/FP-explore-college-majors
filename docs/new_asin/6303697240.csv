7853218,1,6303697240,"I recently saw this film on one of the Cinemax channels a while ago,and I must say,that this film is very,very bad. It's so bad in fact,I don't think it should get any stars. First off,what the hell is up with the acting? It's  some of the worst I've EVER seen! It's so bad,it makes Madonna's acting  look like it should win an academy award. The acting is absolutely  terrible. Second,the photography SUCKS.I don't know what kind of camera the  film makers used. The lighting is awful too. And third,the script is  seriously padded,along with the storyline and plot,which did not make ANY  sense whatsoever. Flat and extremely unimaginative. Now, the film DOES have  it's good points,the special FX and gore galore being the best features,but  all in all,there really isn't much to recommend here. I never saw  Project-Shadowchaser 1-2,but they can't be any worse than  this. Avoid,avoid,avoid. Rated R-contains gory sci-fi violence and strong  language.",955411200,4,955,5.0576923076923075
