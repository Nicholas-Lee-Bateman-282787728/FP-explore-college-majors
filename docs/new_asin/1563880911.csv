8294816,5,1563880911,"Bought for my college level Women in U.S. History course - a little cheesy (specifically the music which comes off a bit dated, yet appropriate), but my students liked to see the visuals of those we were studying in class. Decent quality. Worth what I paid because then I didn't have to put yet another slide show together on the comp. Accurate & covers most of the women one would need for lower-division undergrad classes.",1322265600,,424,4.666666666666667
