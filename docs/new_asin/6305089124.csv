963498,3,6305089124,"I have recently bought a new entertainment system, and I must say that I was disappointed with the sound of this disc.  The visuals are spectacular, but compared to other music dvds I have, the sound on this one is sub par.  Upon first viewing the disc, I was worried I had blown a speaker, but I have tested out the other dvds in my collection and they still sound fine.  My recommendation would be to buy B2B instead...I am planning on buying that one next.",989020800,3,459,4.313953488372093
963499,5,6305089124,"I just bought the DVD, and I have to say that it is definitely one of the better Stones videos out there, and easily the best of the three concert videos sold on Amazon (not counting ""Gimme Shelter"").  The camera work and direction of the Imax crew just adds so much to another spectacular Stones performance, giving the audience a real sense of being right there on stage.
My only complaint is that a few of the guitar solos seem to be mixed up a bit too high.",984700800,,461,4.238636363636363
963500,5,6305089124,THIS VIDEO SIMPLY ADDS TO THE OBVIOUS THAT THEY HAVE EVOLVED FROM A ROCK & ROLL (BLUES) BAND TO DEFINE WHAT ROCK & ROLL (WRAPPED WITH A RIPPING BLUES UNDERCURRENT)IS.  THEY HAVE PASSED THE POINT OF BEING A BAND  TO BECOMING THE TRUE ESSENCE OF ROCK & ROLL BY CREATING A SOUND SO  PROFOUND AND UNIQUE THAT IT LEAVES ONE SPEECHLESS AND TOTALLY AWE STRUCK.  AFTER ALMOST 40 YEARS I STILL CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT THEIR MUSIC-EVEN AFTER  GROWING UP IN THE 60'S WITH THAT GREAT WATERSHED OF TALENT. THIS IS A MUST  BUY DVD; ENJOY!,961545600,6,519,4.410526315789474
963501,2,6305089124,"Forget this video, check out the Voodoo Lounge or Bridges to Babylon videos. They're excellent, this one's only fair. But Stones fanatics will buy it anyway because it's the last one with Bill Wyman playing bass.",947980800,6,212,4.916666666666667
7882683,5,6305089124,"If you love the Stones, you really shouldn't be without this video in your collection.  As much as I liked Shine a Light, I think this performance is better.",1265846400,,157,4.413793103448276
7882684,5,6305089124,"Saw the show at the I MAX in Portland Or. The large screen does magic.....HOWEVER, better on my own home system. Personal reasons...???...!!!!!!!",1251676800,,145,5.3478260869565215
7882685,1,6305089124,"What the hell happened to these guys? I have not bothered to see the Stones since about 81, and watched this out of curiosity. Everyone says they're ""better than ever"", but... What's with all that junk all over the stage? Why do they need 3 keyboard players and a 5-piece horn section? Why do they need huge inflatable things, 10,000 spinning lights, and flashy pyrotechnics? It all makes the Stones themselves seem utterly ridiculous and unimportant, as if their music alone is not enough entertainment. No wonder their tickets are so expensive.

KR and CW are a great rhythm section, and they should not need ANY of that unimaginitive, hi-tech slick show-biz crap to pull off their tunes live. Why Stones ""fans"" eat this BS up is beyond me.

Watch Gimmie Shelter or C***s****r Blues or the TAMI Show for the Stones live without - not this silly Hollywood crap.",1116374400,18,862,4.74
7882686,4,6305089124,"THX audio is very good - in contrary to other reviews.  Noise from audiences is at reasonable level and helps create the proper concert ambient.  You must have good center speaker as it will be heavily drived at times.  The song performances are strong and combined with good camera work.  I'm not real familiar with The Rolling Stones but this dvd gives me a very positive impression.

This video transfer from IMAX format is not as good as I expected.  I can see some grainy artifacts especially in the low light scenes.  Overall it's still pretty good.",1096070400,14,555,4.65979381443299
7882687,2,6305089124,"Like everyone else with any musical taste I love the Stones, and have been following them since I was fifteen and was hooked by ""Satisfaction"".  That said, there seems to always be a propensity by whoever does the mixing for Stones' movies/DVDs to screw up the sound (maybe the Glimmer Twins themselves?).  For instance, I have a number of bootlegs from the 1972 tour (Mick Taylor, decadence, hooray!), most of which are brilliant, full-bodied and powerful, then you get ""Ladies and Gentlemen, The Rolling Stones"", and it is comparatively anemic (actually awful) - guitars too tinny, the bottom rumble eliminated, Jagger too loud, and instead of sounding powerful, it sounds fragmented not like a real band at all.  ""At the Max"" continues this tradition (?).  I have videotape of that tour and, again, it is great, but I can't even watch this DVD, they manage to make the Stones sound boring!!  The good news is that on Four Flicks, at last, a really decent job of mixing has been done that actually does sound like a Stones' concert - major regret that they didn't learn to do this before Bill Wyman left the band. At least we have ""Gimme Shelter"", which in its newest incarnation comes pretty close (ever hear it in a theatre with a good sound system turned up loud?  Magic!) But unless you must have everything, I would avoid this one.",1086307200,17,1338,4.696581196581197
7882688,4,6305089124,Very good but audio does not even come close to DTS Quality,1049500800,7,59,4.0
7882689,2,6305089124,I saw this in an IMax theater last year and was horrified to see that almost all of the guitar work is overdubbed. Keith's fingerwork doesn't match what is coming out of the speakers at all. You'd think they could actually play the tunes live by now. Quite the embarrassment. I'd rather hear a few bum notes than this dishonest mess.,1045785600,9,333,4.475409836065574
7882690,5,6305089124,"This is another great live dvd from a Rolling Stones concert tour. This tour was by far the band's most heavily-designed concert tour. The band fills the show with some new songs, but mostly features oldies.
From the thunderous opening chords of 'Start Me Up' to the crashing final electric strums of 'Satisfaction', this is another fine concert dvd from the greatest rock 'n' roll band in the world. The band has an elaborately designed stage, featuring large blowups of bimbos named Angie and Ruby ('Honky Tonk Women'), and large wild dogs ('Street Fighting Man'). During the latter track, Mick jams the mike stand into the dogs, causing barking barking sounds, before inevitably climbing into one of their mouths. The band also does a bonechilling 'Paint It Black', and a trippy version of '2,000 Light Years Home'. Keith Richards resurrects 'Happy' with a rousing performance. This concert is a must-have.",1039737600,6,909,5.066666666666666
7882691,2,6305089124,"While the visuals on this DVD make me feel like I was there, and I wanted to be excited about this DVD, the sound of each and every song gradually killed my excitement.  The sound is terrible, it is biased so much to the music, when the sound from the crowd comes in, its like somebody in the editing studio simply turned up the volume on the crowd track.  Very low rent.  Worse, the Stones were never known for their live music skills, so the 95% bias to their music leaves all the warts out in the open, with no Stones Live (from the crowd) atmosphere.
I went to this concert, and it was so so so much better in person, I must give the sound crew an F on the DVD, it does not capture the audio side of the experience, while the video side is covered excellent.",1012089600,8,762,4.100671140939597
7882692,3,6305089124,"What happened to the sound quality? I originally saw the Stones' Live at the Max at an IMAX theater in Vancouver, Canada, and it sounded incredible. The sound literally blew my away. But the sound quality in this DVD is simply mute in comparison. I consider the Stones' Gimme Shelter DVD the greatest rock film ever made (followed closely by Pink Floyd's Live at Pompei and The Wall). Unfortunately, Floyd's Live at Pompei isn't on DVD, and the Stones' Live at the Imax is (it should have been left on VHS, or at least digitally remastered for DVD).",998697600,8,549,4.612244897959184
