8455166,5,B0053DAN3S,"Danny Smith's masterwork as an actor. This film is an incredible example of  cashing in on the dubious ""star power"" of Brandon Quinn & Danny Smith star power immediately post-Big Wolf on Campus in 2002. Initially titled ""The Bail"", this film follows two 'teenage' friends (both actors were in their late twenties at the time of filming) as they work to achieve their dream of creating a type of soda. The film's crowning moment may be when the friends, dressed like 'pimps' attend a hip hop club and find themselves on stage to improvise a 'rap'.

After years of being unavailable anywhere on DVD or VHS, this film is finally available to the masses now retitled as 'Fizzy Business'. Although it's clear to see why this film struggled to find a distributor, it is a priceless slice of life in 2002 and is a desirable collectors' item for fans of either Danny Smith or Brandon Quinn.

This film played for me in the US on an XBox 360 without any problems, so I'm not sure whether it is actually something that will only play in Australia.",1483228800,,1037,4.564516129032258
8455167,3,B0053DAN3S,"I saw this video in the dollar bin many times and passed it over... it looked like a video for a high-school science class or something.

Anyway, one day I looked at the back cover, and it looked like a movie, so I bought it (remember, dollar bin, not much to lose!) and found it to be a funny movie.

It's about a couple of friends in the mid-2000's - nothin' smart or rude, friendly and silly - who work at a retirement home and are working on a new soft-drink sensation hoping to become rich. It has many funny scenes, such as their awkward adventures in 'hood-speak' at a nightclub, or the nearly fatal meeting with gangsters, and strong characters. I'd give it a 7. It doesn't push boundaries, but it's smart and funny.",1345680000,,724,4.355555555555555
