7961064,5,B000065FSY,"Terrific movie, better than I expected, funny and clever, and approaches the quality of the first 2 movies of this series. The train footage at
the end of the film was A-1, and very accurately portrayed. I am a railroad junkie and this astounded me.",1496016000,,249,4.555555555555555

Trains.
Oh yes , the girls from St. Trinian's..
Great cast.",1468886400,,83,4.6
7961066,4,B000065FSY,"No, this is not the best of the St. Trinian's movies, but it is a completion of my collection and if you love the little demons you should just get this movie - it is a fun session. And it is always good to see Flash Harry!",1439856000,,223,3.765957446808511
7961067,4,B000065FSY,"As a railfan I will consider any train-themed movie. In this film, the mail train robbery takes place before the opening credits, and the loot is hidden in an empty grange hall that soon becomes the new home of St. Trinian's girls' school. The next hour is spent setting the stage for the final 20 minutes of slapstick chase as the robbers, school girls and school administrators each try to claim the loot (or the reward) in a high speed chase with steam locomotives along the rails. American viewers may not understand all of the British dialogue on the first viewing, but the closing chase is all visual. I feel it is the film's finish that elevates it from three to four stars. Although I agree that adult activities dominate the plot, the students do determine the outcome more than another reviewer gives them credit for.",1260144000,4,827,4.671232876712328
7961068,3,B000065FSY,The movie is mostly about adults.  The school children get under 10% of the screen time and have very few speaking parts.  They are mostly in a mob looking out of train windows for example.,1250726400,3,189,4.371428571428571
7961069,5,B000065FSY,"Those who know the St Trinians films should need no urging to buy this.  It is great - the usual bimodal students, those younger than about 15 being scruffy to say the least, and the older ones being luscious.  There are laughs all the way through, but the final chase sequence is really hilarious, and different from the usual car chases, too.",1237939200,6,344,4.532258064516129
