8181023,3,B000NQQ4RE,"This is an okay Dutch film inspired by a true event.  Overall, I thought the movie was well done, but a few parts disturbed me. The first is near the middle of the movie: there is an advanced tv screen that can cause you to have various sensations and I thought the scene was disturbing. The other thing is what happens to the bus driver at the end of the movie. The actual incident that inspired the film happened on March 11, 2002, six months after the September 11th attacks.",1301011200,,478,4.311111111111111
8181024,1,B000NQQ4RE,"I had high hopes for this film, both from sole review here and from the fact that it has won some film festival awards. It's not good, though. The first fifteen minutes are kind of fun, and then the film goes bad. If you liked A Beautiful Mind and Fight Club ...you'll still hate Offscreen. Unless you feel like brushing up on your Dutch listening comprehension, skip this one. You'll be glad you did.",1210809600,2,401,4.4324324324324325
8181025,4,B000NQQ4RE,"Much more similar to the American indie film Revolution #9 and the Canadian film Cypher than to Memento and Fight Club, the Dutch film Off Screen--ostensibly based on a true story--concerns an about-to-retire bus driver, now in his 34th year of bus driving, who sees startlingly negative subliminal messages conveyed to him via his new widescreen TV.

By sheer accident, he runs into a high level Philips executive (bearing in mind that Philips is the number one Dutch manufacturer of home audio and video entertainment technologies) as a bus passenger and the two men become friends--of a sort.

The convergence of the bus driver's psychology--he's separated and his wife does not want him back, and he subsequently loses his job--and the executive's own fragile mental state, based on the development of new video technologies (code name: Pandora's Box) deliver an immensely intriguing story that makes the viewer wonder if the strange video technologies described really do exist.

Even if they are fictional, this is a gripping story, superbly enhanced by the two male leads, Jan Declier (from the great Dutch film ""Character"") and Jeroen Krabbe (from many Dutch and American films). These two actors are in fine form and significantly add to the drama that results in a truly startling ending, which will not be revealed here.

The question of how much responsibility companies like Philips have in influencing TV viewers is, for the most part, implicit, but it is there all the same. Conversely, the question of how much impact individual consumers can have on large corporations is more dramatically presented, as the viewer will see as the film develops.

The bottom line theme of the film is sociopolitical responsibility. Does the corporation have it, or doesn't it?

A strong film, well worth seeing and highly recommended.",1192924800,3,1834,5.1375838926174495
