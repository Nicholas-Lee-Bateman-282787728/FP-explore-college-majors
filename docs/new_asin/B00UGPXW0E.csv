7039074,5,B00UGPXW0E,"This series is a favorite of my husband's.  Recently retired CW4, he spent 6 1/2 years in Viet Nam as a Green Beret.  He constantly picks movies on that era apart with critique about dates, uniforms, insignia, equipment, place names etc.  Well you get the idea.  He has been delighted with the accuracy of the series.

Several of the episodes on the earlier editions had reference to actions he was actually involved in!  He paid special attention to those.  We both love the series and can't wait for the last one to come out.  If you can't believe the opinion of a man who was actually there and saw it, who can you believe?",1119830400,59,626,4.4298245614035086

7039093,5,B00UGPXW0E,loved it except for cloying female reporter who took up too much time as an unnecessary romantic ploy. Otherwise sympathetic (or not) enjoyable characters & plots.  Everyone else in the entire series could act.  My guess is that she was the wife or girlfriend of one of the producers. Other women with smaller roles were mostly likable.  My boyfriend who was in Viet Nam found it cathartic.  Her appearances had me ranting & gnashing my teeth.otherwise terrific series!,1426982400,,469,4.9743589743589745

7039122,5,B00UGPXW0E,"Having spent a tour in Vietnam, I enjoyed watching this three year series.  The only thing I didn't like, which was pretty important to me, was that they edited out the opening song of Paint it Black by the Rolling Stones, and put in something else.  But in time that grew on me, too.",1374364800,,284,4.2407407407407405
7039123,5,B00UGPXW0E,This show was the most realistic Viet Nam T.V. Shows ever made. It picks up where season 2 ended and even shows how some of the characters had trouble reintegrating into civillian life after coming home from Viet Nam. Tour of Duty is great entertainment and gives the viewers a very realistic impression of what the Viet Nam experience was like.,1373846400,,345,4.672131147540983

7039126,5,B00UGPXW0E,"I purchased this about a year ago and am glad I got it when I did.  It looks like it's hard to find now.  I don't really care that the original music is missing even though it would have been nice.  This is the best Vietnam war TV series ever made.  If you have the first two seasons, you must get this to see what happened to all of the characters.

Don't overlook this just because of the music because it doesn't look like it's ever going to be released with the original music intact.",1357776000,,488,4.094736842105263
7039127,3,B00UGPXW0E,"""I WISH I had read the reviews on Amazon about the removal of the original music score, before I bought all three seasons of this great TV series. I struggled through the pilot episode of Season One last night. Without the original music score, Tour Of Duty has no ambiance, and it's going to be very difficult to watch all three seasons listening to that really atrocious generic music score that Sony substituted in place of the original music.""

It's been some time since I've written the above review, and I've had a chance to watch many of the episodes. Despite the missing music, the stories are great. I'm still not pleased about the music, but I'm enjoying the episodes. I've upgraded my rating from 1 star to 3 stars. If the original music score was used, this series would surely rate 5 stars.",1352937600,10,803,4.576388888888889
7039128,5,B00UGPXW0E,"""Tour of Duty"" was a tremendous television show.  It's a shame that it only lasted three seasons.  It is one of my all time favorite television shows.  Along with ""Magnum:P.I."" it stands as a shining example of showing Vietnam veterans in a positive light instead of the stereotypical brooding, psyhologically damaged loner that has become so prevalent in film since the end of the conflict in 1975.  As a Nam Vet I greatly appreciate that positive message and the television show is superbly produced and highly entertaining as well as historically enlightening.  All in all a great show and a great value.",1341705600,3,607,4.911764705882353
7039129,4,B00UGPXW0E,"I went to Amazon U.K. and found this great series WITH ORIGINAL SOUND TRACK MUSIC! The down side was it is only available to play in zone 2. I contacted both Amazon U.K. and Amazon U.S. but they are not much help. I think many Nam vets who own this series would be very happy to repurchase this series as most of us feel ripped off as we bought the series not knowing the music was gone. That was a great disapointment. Amazon, we want you to sell us this series WITH the original sound track! Are you listening?

This is a great series otherwise. I used to watch it all the time as a kid and it was very entertaining. But this is not the place to rate the show on how acurate they were or how the picture quality is or isn't. It is for the product, and in this case the product sucks.",1319155200,,451,3.5656565656565657

But if your going to buy just the 1st season, YOUR MAKING A BAD CHOICE!!! you need to buy all 3 of them! In each episode they always have action and they always have drama (but its good drama) But each episode is about 45 minutes long, its still worth it!

7039145,5,B00UGPXW0E,"We now have the complete series.  Although the program had a relatively short run, it was an often powerful, often heartbreaking series.  My husband, a veteran of combat in Vietnam, said that they ""got most things right"".  For those who were not there, it's an eye opener, told from the perspective of the soldiers who were.  Good acting with characters you soon care about.  Whether you were for the war or against it, this series tells the truth about what went on and should be seen by all.",1295222400,,493,4.556818181818182
7039146,4,B00UGPXW0E,"I've read all the reviews, I've seem all the movies and Documentaries,nothing comes close to what Viet Nam was like for the Combat Vet. I served 3 tours in Viet Nam and what this does not show like all the others, was the smells and oders of the dead and dying ,that is something you can never forget or never describe. The true sounds of the war. What it felt like to see your best friend in pieces on the ground. I to was a Volenteer, and came back 3 times total, not because I loved it but I was young dumb and single. I really thought I could save a Dad with kids from going over. War is War I won't go into the details this missed or was right about it. When I came back from my last tour I was in the Hospital For over a Year. During the last few month I was able to leave the hospital for afew hours, that I loved , what I hated we were not allowed to wear our uniforms off base. Seems they were offencive to many of the locals. The things that went on in that country cost me alot , my first heart attack at 29, 3 bouts with cancer, at 61 I can bearly walk, but that is ok I am better off then many. For many many year I hate what the war did to me and others , I hated the way We were treated when we came home, I hate the fact that many more died after coming home from everything for cancer to taking their own lives. For year I could not stand watching how good the troops were treated when they were coming home from other wars, I felt cheat again, I was jealous. Two weeks ago that all changed. I was in a Fry's store (a supermarket ) It was Vetern's week so Had on a Viet Nam vet hat and shirt. I was standing looking at something and felt a light tapping on my back. I turn to find what looked to be a brother and sister maybe 7 to 8 years old, they looked up at me ( i could see just alittle fear in their eyes ). The little girl said to me ""Welcome Home and the Little boy put out his hand for me to shake and said to me "" Thank you for Serving "". I know it was the parents that told the kids what to do and say. I thanked them both with a salute and a thank you and spent the rest of my time in the store with tears in my eyes. That meant more to me then all the metals, everything. If you want to change a Vets life especially a Viet Nam Vet next time you see one please just take a second and say ""Welcome Home "" thank you for your time and to All Vets From All Wars, THANK YOU AND WELCOME HOME ,,,,,,,,,,",1290384000,8,2426,3.78698224852071
7039147,5,B00UGPXW0E,"I have been a (continuous) fan of Tour of Duty since it was first released in 1988.

Having said that, there is not much more that can be said that other reviewers have not already written, except to say that the show was/has been unfairly criticized during it's second and third seasons. A show like Tour of Duty was always going to be a 'limited engagement' and so, the producers had to cram alot of themes and issues into the show, including themes like the formation and breakdown of relationships and marriages, alcoholism, drugs, authority, trust, poor leadership, the tragedy of war and etc. For these reasons, some reviewers have criticized the show as getting too 'Mills and Boonish' in places (Goldman's relationships with Nikki and eventually Alex, for example) but this IS what does happen in war. As the show seeks to emphasise, WAR IS ABOUT PEOPLE, it is not just about orders and objectives.

The show is highly authentic. I have not been able to fault it yet. There are the correct references to the 'White Mice' and the correct reference to ICEX Program (the forerunner of Phoenix) has been made.

And just to put in my 2 cents....the soundtrack IS important. It is all about IMMERSION into the era. It serves to remind the viewer that these events occured during our own life time. The music REMINDS PEOPLE OF THAT. This did not occur in some far away galaxy in another pont in time that is removed far away. These thing actually did happen, all while other peope were sitting elsewhere in the world, listening to these very same songs. That is the point that the producers were trying to make. Once again, the shiny suits were looking at the projected sales figures when they considered the re-release on DVD.

Anyone who has the whole series on the original Video release could make themselves A LOT of money from a serious fan.

Five stars for the show - but only for the show.",1290124800,3,1898,4.636904761904762

We wished Anderson and Goldman had finally gotten out of that hell hole.  They really did a great job protraying the problems during the Vietnam War. I liked how before each show a true statement was made and then the show wrapped itself around it.  I was absolutly shocked when I saw the knives the guys had. See my Marine son was home for xmas when I got this dvd set and he showed us a knife given to him from a Marine that had been in Vietnam. Its the very same knife used in this show! Despite the fact they didn't use the orginal soundtracks it was still a good Vietnam story and you find yourself rooting for the guys! I wish they had done a movie of them having a reunion at the age the actors are now with flashbacks and how they were living today. Kyle Chandler was as handsome and a good a actor then as he is now in Friday Night Lights. As this season ends you really understand the feelings they had when some of them went back to the USA to a ""normal"" life.",1199577600,,1104,4.013636363636364

There was lots of complaining from some viewers about introducing the women into the show--I for one liked that aspect.  It made the characters more interesting.  There's only so many t.v. episodes you can do just on soldiers patrolling through the jungle.  I thought Tour of Duty had a nice balance of real-life action and emotional drama (unlike China Beach which was just about nurses crying every five minutes).

But above all else, who can resist the irony of ""Touched By An Angel""'s Angel of Death cast in Vietnam as a tree-hugging hippy doctor who will not touch a gun.",1122336000,4,385,4.4714285714285715

Soundtrack ? who cares about the cheap muzac, I am just glad they ever came out with this series on DVD at all. I have all the episodes in VHS and the music does help the show feel like it happened during the Viet Nam era, but is not the music that makes the show but the story, characters, actors and the sweet HUEYS flying all over the place. I recomend this DVD and the complete 3 seasons.",1120521600,13,475,4.010526315789473

Two words...

DOC HOCK

John Dye (Pvt. Francis Thurman Hockenbury) in an OUTSTANDING character performance that I have long wanted on DVD. If you've only seen him as the often bland ""Angel of Death"" in Touched By an Angel OH MAN are you in for a REAL surprise here. His wisecracking CO medic will leave you in stitches and maybe even in tears. He's just terrific in this role, a fine addition to an already great cast. Just can't beat this season, it is my personal favorite all round. I've got mine ordered and I am counting down the days....

7039173,5,B00UGPXW0E,"I'm so glad they are going to release this as my tapes of the third season are mostly worn out. We also get more episodes (20) as compared to just 16 in season 2. The boys in Tour Of Duty also steer away from most of the soap opera style episodes and the focus is now more on combat and the soldiers realizations of the futility of the Vietnam war. Some of my favorite episodes of the series were in this season especially when Carl Weathers-from the Rocky movies joins the cast and as a special forces Col. His character and acting are superb and add so much to the series. Lee Majors also joins for a few episodes as an old soldier in his third war.

 Whether Tour Of Duty has real music from the 60's or the same old tired tracks we have heard throughout the series is irrelevant.  Sure it WOULD be nice to hear those songs, but it seriously doesn't ruin the whole experience. If I want to hear 60's music I can always pop a cd in my stereo and listen. I bought the other two DVD sets to experience the best war series ever, not music.

 To me the content of these episodes makes this the second best season. Each soldier's tour comes full circle and for better or worse they all have to deal with the problems of overstress from war, recovery the horrors they have seen, and come to grips with their part in it all whether good or bad. The series could not be complete without the closure that is given to topics that have been nagging the soldiers throughout their tours.

 I doubt after watching all 20 of these episodes anyone who has complained about the music will still be complaining because of the gripping content of each episode.",1119830400,41,1643,4.297734627831715

Come on, why can't you use the original music????????",1531353600,,158,4.448275862068965
8706291,5,B00UGPXW0E,What a genuinely spot on depiction of the feelings and events surrounding the Vietnam War.  We've been pulled into the drama and feel ourselves a part of each soldier's life.

Great characters and plots with many topical issues regarding the times and locale.  If you have any doubts regarding this series, put them aside.  Its ""Platoon"" made into a series, but IMHO better.",1494201600,,351,4.8
