8198350,4,B000R1IEKK,"I really liked this movie. Van Vicker was in top form as the so called American Army boy that in reality is a local boy working as a manual labourer. nadia is so in awe of her American boy she is willing to risk everything. Even when she is reduced to living in a shack she still beleievs that she is goign to go to America and be lunching with George Bush! One to watch most definitely!
