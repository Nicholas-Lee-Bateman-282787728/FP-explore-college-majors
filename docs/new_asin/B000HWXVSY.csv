2643788,5,B000HWXVSY,"This is just excellent. It gives a good, but short introduction to the history of the Amish Christian community, plus a view of their communal religious life. Espcially good was the discussion of the distinct issues with which the Amish must contend. It is both realistic and sympathetic. Highly recommend.",1244332800,3,306,5.14
2643789,5,B000HWXVSY,This video gives great insight into the lifesyle of the Amish people and why they believe in this way of life. A very well done video.,1207699200,7,134,4.1923076923076925
2643790,5,B000HWXVSY,I live amongst the Amish and Mennonites of Holmes County and I travel with my work.  This DVD always travels with me and brings me back to the home I cherish when I am homesick.  A very good look into the Plain life of our community and how they devoutly they keep their faith and  lifestyle in an everchanging world.,1190073600,11,317,4.25
2643791,2,B000HWXVSY,"I don't think this was a very good documentary about the Amish people or their way of life.  It was a very poorly made documentary.  I was expecting something along the line of production like History Channel, National Geographic, or even PBS documentaries - this was neither of those.  I would instead recommend the History Channel's series on the Amish people, or the PBS documentary about America (which had an episode devoted solely to the Amish).

I bought this on Amazon instant video.  As with all instant videos, the pro is that you don't ever have to replace it (unless Amazon goes out of business or something), but the con is that you don't have any bonus features (which I'm not sure this even had any to begin with) that you would normally get on a disc - and there's no audio or subtitle option on instant video either, which you would get on a disc.  So the preference is up to you; which something like this I don't mind, but if you're buying a classic like Gone With the Wind, then you would probably want the disc instead, as you won't get anything on the instant video other than the movie itself.",1359072000,,1116,4.472906403940887
2643792,3,B000HWXVSY,An interesting look at modern day Amish life and how they have evolved to survive in today's economy. I found it somewhat intriguing as to the ways they adapted to continue in this day and age. Just like most denominations they have come up with loopholes to allow them to do some of the things that would have been considered ungodly by their predecessors.,1354320000,,357,4.59375
2643793,5,B000HWXVSY,I loved it and learned a lot about how the Amish live.  I was interested in that part of society,1354147200,,96,3.8
2643794,4,B000HWXVSY,Its nice movie on how the Amish live. It gives the viewer a heads up of what our forefathers went through w/out the modern conivences we have today.,1349913600,,148,4.321428571428571
2643795,5,B000HWXVSY,We loved this video. We visited this Amish area today and were eager to watch this video so we could learn more about the Amish community. It's a nice documentary about a very fascinating culture in America.,1337126400,3,207,4.621621621621622
2643796,4,B000HWXVSY,I found the video very interesting. It gives a good overview of how the Amish culture adapts to survive in a rapidly changing world. I was impressed with the amount of detail presented. Highly recommend.,1330732800,4,203,4.828571428571428
2643797,3,B000HWXVSY,"I really enjoyed this look into the various aspects of Amish life and culture in the US.  Obviously they couldn't explore all the little details of each sect in a 50 minute program, but the overall scope was quite interesting.  My only criticism is that there were many MANY shots of farms and people from afar, as well as some voice-overs, but no sit-down interviews with actual Amish people.  It would have been nice to place a face with a voice and really relate to the story on a personal level.  (Though that could be some Amish taboo I don't know about - and if so, mentioning that would have been nice.)

Overall, a satisfactory introduction to the lifestyle of Amish in America.  It made me want to know more, which I think should be the goal of any good documentary.",1325980800,4,775,4.460992907801418
2643798,3,B000HWXVSY,. . . presentation is dull as dishwater.  The gentlemen who made this film also narrates it--sluggishly.  What a shame so fascinating a subject is described in so pedestrian a manner.,1325376000,,183,4.870967741935484
2643799,1,B000HWXVSY,This DVD was interresting but the original DVD description was very deceiving. Not what I was looking for at all. This DVD is all about the men and boys. Not much at all about the women in the communities other than just in passing. Its ok for learning the overall lifestyle or history of the amish but if your looking for anything at all about the women in the community...look elsewhere!!!!! I felt I had just thrown $20 in the toilet.,1270512000,20,437,4.407407407407407
2643800,5,B000HWXVSY,I really like this film. It was true to life and it contained a lot of valuable information for those interested in the Amish and how they live today. This film is well worth the cost. I buy all of my DVD's from Amazon and their service is better then any of the other on line stores I have dealt with.,1263254400,2,302,3.9672131147540983

8141633,2,B000HWXVSY,"I grew up near the Amish and had many dealings with them.  This film is ok, but contains some very misleading and untrue statements.",1380499200,,132,4.5
