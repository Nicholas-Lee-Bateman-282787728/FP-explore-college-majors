8079873,5,B000AV1AJE,"My friend and I are going through this course together.  My friend is Catholic and I am Agnostic.  We are both finding the content extremely interesting, informative, startling in many ways, and enjoy very much discussing the lectures and material as we go through it.
The lecturer is extremely interesting, well prepared, active in presenting the material.
Extremely stimulating and enjoyable.  The professor presents the material in a thorough, fairly balanced manner.  He provides background to each new work of set of documents that provide the context for people who are not well versed in this area of research and history.
We both give this series 5 stars without any reservations!",1266105600,11,688,5.171171171171171
