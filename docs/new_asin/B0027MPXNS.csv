through half the movie. when they demonstrated the survival suits shown on the front cover
I had to look away to stop the tears from laughing so hard. It's amazing when the people at
the conferences actually take their words and ideas seriously. It's definitely mind-blowing.",1292371200,4,374,4.769230769230769

3867858,5,B0027MPXNS,"An admirer of activist-pranksters the Yes Men, I took high hopes to their 2003 eponymous documentary and despite several amusing scenes, the film's erratic pace left me let down.  However, with their 2010 follow-up film THE YES MEN FIX THE WORLD, the Yes Men - Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonnano - seem to have learned as much about making movies as they know about fooling corporations and the media.  THE YES MEN FIX THE WORLD shows the Yes Men are still going strong with raising awareness in their unique, funny style, but we also see Bichlbaum and Bonnano are now well up to speed when it comes to presenting their work to the movie viewing public.

THE YES MEN FIX THE WORLD follows Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonnano through five stunts and at times we feel as nervous as they must as a gag commences.  All the tricks they pull amuse and educate, the biggest Bichlbaum posing as a Dow Chemical spokesperson who announces, via a worldwide B.B.C. NEWS telecast, that the company would spend $12 billion to compensate victims of the 1984 Bhopal pesticide plant catastrophe, which was caused by the company Dow had later purchased, Union Carbide.

The gag I like best wraps up THE YES MEN FIX THE WORLD, where they publish a fake NEW YORK TIMES with news so fit to print, it isn't true.  Stories include immediate, complete United States withdrawal from Iraq; a maximum wage for corporate executives; and the indictment of George W. Bush for high treason.  The print edition is a collector's item but you can find the on-line Yes Men NEW YORK TIMES via exact phrase search ""The Yes Men"" and all the words ""New York Times.""

See THE YES MEN FIX THE WORLD.",1275436800,10,1651,4.610921501706485
3867859,5,B0027MPXNS,"These Yes Men are courageous, perhaps the most important ingredient, for any budding, if not seasoned social activist.  If a person wants to be ""serious"" activist and is seriously committed to saving the world so to speak, he or she must also know how to laugh, play an honest prank every now and then, or plain language know how to have a good time.  A highlight of the film is when the Yes Men go on television as I recall, as a CEO for Union Carbide, promising to adequately pay up to the victims of the terrible , Bhopal incident in the 1980's where thousands died and Union Carbide insisted on blaming the incident on an inept worker.  Immediately, thereafter, the stock plummeted, one of many illustrations that a profit oriented society obviously puts greed before human need.  They get the facts right out there and hopefully people will see that greed is not good.",1273449600,14,873,4.612903225806452

theyre nervy and poised and quick on their feet and my idols.
but the amazingness is in peoples' reactions to them. a freakin' case study in human psychology.
both really uplifting and quite sad too, but (like the daily show) at least the sad is sugarcoated with hilarity.",1267315200,14,285,4.607843137254902
3867862,5,B0027MPXNS,I watched this movie on the plane to Toronto from Seattle and was absolutely enthralled by the actors and the plot.  So simple yet so very deep.  Within the first few minutes I was lost in the art of the film and the lack of pretense in the actors. Everything is so real- you can feel the heat and the dust of the streets and the warmth and the chill of the people in the city. I reccommmend this film to anyone and everyone.,1262044800,7,425,4.0476190476190474

3867864,5,B0027MPXNS,"I saw this movie at the 2008 Indianapolis Heartland Film Festival and was immediately taken by it.  At one level it is the story of an Indian autorickshaw driver who finds independence and love.  At another it is a mystery (who is killing these people and will the real heir be found?).  It is also about human misunderstandings (why give an illiterate man a letter to read?), but finally it is about fate.  A beautiful film with real Bollywood stars.  I bought a copy for a friend.",1260576000,6,482,4.494252873563219

8354953,3,B0027MPXNS,"When it comes to the films being screened at the 2009 Cape May Film Festival, weve always said you
cant see them at the theater or on television (or on DVD!)but several of the films at this years Festival
you couldn't have even seen in New Jersey before this November 20-22, 2009. There are world premiere
films being showcased this year and NJ firsts as well.
Among the New Jersey premieres are the fantastic short films, And One for the Organizer and Plane
Face, as well as the feature Strongman (which we featured in an earlier Movie Spin). In this edition,
we will focus on the documentary The Yes Men Fix the World, a true story about two political activists
(Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonanno) who pose as top executives of giant corporations. They lie their
way into big business conferences, major network news to pull off the world's most outrageous pranks. It
opened to a packed house at Sundance, and has just been nationally distributedbut it has never played
in New Jersey until now.
Andy poses as a Dow Chemical spokesperson on the BBC News and announces that Dow will clean up
the site of the largest industrial accident in history, the 20-year old chemical catastrophe at Bhopal, India.
The result: as people worldwide celebrate, Dow's stock value loses two billion dollars. People want Dow
to do the right thing, but the corporation denounces the hoax. Subsequently, at multiple conferences, the
two try to wake up their corporate audiences to the truth, and in the process taking on some of the world's
biggest and baddest corporations. For example, posing as Exxon executives Andy and Mike demonstrate
a new biofuel made from climate-change victims.
According to the filmmakers: On their journey, the Yes Men act as gonzo journalists, delving deep into
the question of why we have given the market more power than any other institution to determine our
direction as a society. They visit the twisted (and accidentally hilarious) underworld of the free-market
think tanks, where they figure out a way to defeat the logic that's destroying our planet. And as they
appear on the BBC before 300 million viewers, or before 1000 New Orleans contractors alongside Mayor
Ray Nagin, the layers of lies are peeled back to reveal the raw heart of truth - a truth that brings with it
hope.",1408406400,,2294,4.8396946564885495

8354955,5,B0027MPXNS,"The Yes Men are back, pulling pranks not for the sake or pranking someone, but with some very real import!  They pose in the media as representatives of Dow Chemical, who bought out Union Carbide, and pledge to pay reparations to the victims and an extreme loss to the company, and then it is on!  When they are recognized in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina, they try to do some fast talking to maintain their cover.  The whole time I watch the Yes Men, I am berating myself for not having that kind of courage, but I am sure glad that they do!  I use this and their first video in my class on Culture Jamming and have used it in the past in media classes and they always goes over very well.  They provide an excellent example of how to use the mainstream media to get your point across.",1357603200,,790,4.275167785234899
8354956,4,B0027MPXNS,"Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonanno are the Yes Men. They pose as corporate big shots and do outrageous things in the name of corporate entities. Dow Chemical agrees to compensate the victims of the Bhopal disaster, Exxon introduces a new miracle fuel with a poetic relationship to Soylent Green, Halliburton launches a protective suit that turns people into beach balls, and HUD agrees to open all the housing in New Orleans they closed without justification. Finally, a special issue of the New York Times, dated six months in the future, is full of good news.

Some would say they are cruel, but those directly involved (in Bhopal, in New Orleans) say that their hoaxes brought needed attention to their problems, and they are grateful.

In the meantime, both the Yes Men and their audience are having a lot of creative fun.",1336694400,3,823,4.829787234042553
