7314220,5,B010MZ4D00,"When I first saw a trailer for izombie on imdb I ignored it. I actually ignored it several times. I love all things zombies/viruses but I'm so sick of the crap that keeps getting made. Well, one day I finally broke down and watched the trailer, for which I thought was going to be for a movie, and I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it was a ""behind the scenes"" type interview with some of the cast talking about their characters. I was intrigued right away and very excited to check it out. Needless to say from the 5 star rating, I fell in love with the show in the first episode. Izombie is now one of my favorite shows and I'm so excited that it will get a second season (as so many of my other favorite new shows were cancelled). The storyline never got boring and I love the new take on zombies. My favorite aspect of the show is how the zombies take on the personality traits of the person whose brain they eat. It makes the show so fun to watch because you never know how Liv is going to act next. And speaking of Liv, Rose McIver was the PERFECT choice for Olivia Moore. I don't think the show would be as successful as it is without her. The rest of the cast are amazing as well, but she really sells the whole zombie thing. I'm not really a comic book person so I came to the show just being a fan of zombies, but I love the comic book shots before the scenes and the comic book opening (not to mention the awesome opening song that you can't help but rock out to). If the premise of the show peaks your interest in the slightest, then I urge you to check it out. If you don't like the first episode then the show's not for you. If you're anything like me, however, you'll be addicted from the start. I can't wait to see what season two has in store.",1436572800,12,1770,4.1037463976945245
7314221,5,B010MZ4D00,"I obviously have not seen the DVD set yet but I absolutely LOVE this very entertaining TV show.  Rose McIver is a real treat as Liv Moore (get it?  ""Live More?""), our zombie protagonist, and she is VERY easy on the eyes in any event.  Her solution to her brain eating dilemma was to use her medical training to get a job at the morgue so as not to inconvenience the population at large.  And the side effect she suffers -- taking on flashes of the memory and large swaths of the personality and talents of the deceased whose brains she consumes, is innovative and intriguing and HUGELY entertaining, employing a range of acting aplomb rarely seen in one as young and relatively new to the scene as Ms. McIver.

And when somebody picks on her, you start to think, ""This guy's making a BIG mistake!""  Her eyes go all red and glowing, and she opens up an extra-large can of whup-ass on 'em.  It's almost as funny as the recipes she concocts to make brains more palatable to her.

It is weirdly refreshing to see the world from a zombie's point of view.  They keep the comic relief at a very high and most welcome level in this show, and their having turned it into a crime drama was very clever indeed.

I recommend it highly.",1436572800,5,1223,4.348017621145375
7314222,4,B010MZ4D00,"The television show iZombie is based on a rather whimsical and imaginative comic book that came out several years ago. In the comic, a young woman named Gwen comes back as a zombie. She keeps her regular personality as long as she eats brains often enough. One of the side effects of brain eating is that she has the deceased's memories. Some of them died violent deaths or had some other unresolved issues in their lives which the girl tries to resolve. She has a ghost and a were-terrier helping her out, kind of a Scooby Gang. Gwen works as a grave digger in an Oregon ""green"" cemetery where they don't embalm bodies, so the brains are still edible.

The television version changes some things. The young woman is named Liv Moore (obvious pun) and she has memories from eating brains which she uses to solve crimes. She was a medical student but takes a new job in the Seattle coroner's office (so she has access to brains which happen to be from homicide victims). She also has a mother and brother and an ex-fiance (she broke it off when she became a zombie). She was infected at a boat party where a new recreational drug was in use and at the beginning of the show it seems like the drug is what has caused her and others to become zombies.

The series starts with some ""murder of the week"" episodes that have bits of an overarching narrative included.

The show's early tone is fairly comedic with some drama thrown in. By the end of the season, this balance is flipped where it is mostly drama with snappy dialogue. The tone is also set by Liv's inner monologue about what's happening--mostly a jokey commentary on what's happening though she shows more of her character (and often the character of the person whose brains she's eaten). The voiceovers are a bit too much in the earlier episodes (especially at the end of episodes where the point of the episode is clear without Liv having to explain it). Thankfully the voiceovers are fewer by the end of the season. The last episode is very dramatic and the creators are confident enough to let the story tell itself, leaving a great ending wanting me to see more. The show doesn't come back till early October, so it will be a long wait.

SPOILERIFIC COMMENTS AND SUMMARY: The tonal shift happens over time in an organic way. The coroner knows about Liv's problem and starts working on a cure. Another zombie, Blaine (played delightfully by David Anders), starts a company providing brains to the more well-to-do zombies in Seattle. He makes his own employees by turn street kids into zombies (in addition to infecting some rich people so he has clients). The conflict with Blaine becomes the main narrative by the end of the season. All the later episodes and their murders tie into either Blaine's business or the company that makes the energy drink Max Rager (a well-chosen name) which is the true zombie-creating culprit.",1436313600,19,2886,4.630859375
7314223,5,B010MZ4D00,"I haven't read the iZombie comic (yet) but the show looked interesting and since it followed my favorite new show of the 2014-2015 season,The Fash, I figured I would give it a chance. The show is no Walking Dead but I found the short debut season of iZombie quite enjoyable.

7314224,5,B010MZ4D00,"I'm not a big zombie fan.
I've never, for example, seen an episode of ""The Walking Dead"" and, while I do own the ""Resident Evil"" series, I don't watch zombie movies very often. I've read a few good zombie novels over the years, but generally I avoid them because too many of them follow a template. Rare authors like Ann Christy and Ian D. Moore write zombie fiction from a different perspective that's refreshing but writers like them are few and far between.
That said, I took a chance and bought the first season of ""IZombie"" because it looked intriguing and I was not disappointed. A unique heroine, strong female characters, drama (even a little melodrama) and humor make this series a delight to watch.
Part of what makes it fun to watch is the fact that it combines some of the best elements of ""Veronica Mars"" and ""Pushing Daisies"" with fresh storytelling. The sets are simple - a good thing because they do not distract from either the dialogue or the action - and the cinematography is professional. The make-up is not over the top and while there are some very violent scenes they are not gratuitous.
The verdict: Really good television.",1514332800,,1148,4.6600985221674875

7314240,5,B010MZ4D00,"I picked up season one in the bargain bin at Walmart to have something to listen to on a long road trip.  My expectations were low as my last series was Sabrina the teenage witch (ick.)  As I was driving, I didn't get to see any of the actors, just the audio.  I got home and watched it properly and was blown away.  It was Tinkerbell!  Rose Mciver is a talented actress that can sing too.  She's not Adelle, but I replayed her country songs on one episode a few times.  Very pretty voice.  Every week she eats a new brain and she seems to adapt to each role effortlessly.

I don't know where they are heading with season three, but the first episode was good.  Clive (the detective) rubbed me the wrong way at first, but I've warmed up to him.  If you can suspend your belief or lack there-of about zombies, it's a decent show.",1491436800,,828,4.210191082802548

Liv Moore was a hard working medical student until she gets turned into a zombie and since zombies need to eat brains she transfers to the coroner's office giving her easy access.
Her coworker Ravi is working on a cure but Liv has to break her engagement to her fianc and love of her life fianc Major.

7314270,5,B010MZ4D00,"I'm shocked WB is doing the right thing and putting both seasons of iZombie on blu ray
The asking price is a bit high (But, it is what it is)
I'm in mostly cause this getting a blu ray set has been in limbo for almost 2 years

As someone who started becoming a massive fan of zombie films in 1999....
I'm burned out on everything zombie way to much saturation overall
When you have zombies selling smart phones, eye drops and KFC something is wrong!
It's no longer cool and underground it's mainstream and rotting away

As much as I'm sick of zombies and comic book adaptions
iZombie is a new animal that is fresh and new there is nothing else like it on tv
Based of a Vertigo Comic (which i never heard of been out of the comic loop for a long time)
The guys who wrote this are smart they crafted a unique vision of the old tried and true ""Who Done it Mystery"" and added neat little tweaks

It's like Psych with a real psychic that only gets visions by eating human brains
by eating the brains Liv takes the persons memories and characteristics and all that's new and fresh!

Once you watch the Pilot you either understand it and be in on the joke or you're just straight up dislike everything about this
The pilot throws out George R. Romero's name and Night of the Living Dead
Liv is watching NOTLD on tv in the morgue
It also throws in the iconic eating of brains made famous by Dan O'Bannon's Return of the Living Dead

The Cast is really good:
Rose McIver as Olivia 'Liv' Moore (a little wacky for a name but, it grows on you and works for the overall series) Never seen anything else she's been in but, this role impresses me more every week!
also the make-up and her overall look is very good!
Malcolm Goodwin as homicide detective Clive Babineaux (Malcolm gets to play the hero cops which is cool mostly know him from A&E Breakout Kings) he's also very impressive in this role!
Rahul Kohli as Dr. Ravi Chakrabarti (plays Liv's Boss at the morgue like him to he fits with everyone else)
Robert Buckley as Major Lilywhite (i think the actor is enjoyable to watch I hate the name though it's so terrible)
David Anders as Blaine DeBeers (great character actor who gets to shine in this series)
Aly Michalka as Peyton Charles
Molly Hagan as Liv's mother Eva Moore
Steven Weber has this guest starring role as Vaughn Du Clark the head of the Energy Drink Max Rager (The Max Rager Company is set up like Umbrella Corporation in the Resident Evil Games) It sounds silly but, it makes a lot of sense once you get into this series

This series needs a lot more attention on it (This is one of Network tv best kept secrets)
Season One is a massive epilogue to set up everything else
Even if you are burned out by the whole zombie fad give this series a chance it's different and doesn't try to copy everyone else
9.5/10
This gives me some hope that maybe we'll see a Major Crimes Blu Ray box set
or maybe even WGN's Salem will get the blu ray treatment it deserves

7314282,5,B010MZ4D00,"iZombie is a refreshing different sort of show into the saturated zombie genre, in the fact that zombies in this one more realistically look like they would when they have just died, or have been able to keep themselves nourished with brain since they died. They look like alive people just without pigmentation in skin and hair (although I would think if you can't regrow new hair shouldn't zombies go bald as their hair falls out over time and isn't replaced).  Zombies as well can still talk and well pretty much act like humans.  This one does give them superhuman strength and the ability to regenerate and heal quickly like Hayden Pannettiere's character in Heroes. The strength increases when outraged or facing danger and their adrenaline kicks in. They also like in the movie/book Warm Bodies experience memories of the human whose brain they are eating.  This means for our central character who was a former top medical hospital intern, that in order for her to satisfy her needs and not kill anyone, she has changed to be morgue student in the police morgue.  Of course when she eats some brain (with added chili and spices as tastebuds don't work real well when you're a zombie), she learns stuff about the deceased that she can't morally not pass onto the police.  So she pretends she's having psychic visions and eventually a reluctant homicide detective learns that her insights seem to be true.

So that's what we have here with iZombie, basically a homicide solving zombie.  Throw in of course the fact there are other zombies out there and not all of them see a problem with killing humans for their brain, and even running an organised crime outfit cashing in on other zombies who just don't want to ask where their brain is coming from.  Of course you've also got the ex boyfriend who had to be dumped since if you obviously exchange body fluids, even from just kissing you'd be infecting and converting that person into a zombie.  But you still have feelings for him, not helped by an I want to organise your life type mother who doesn't let it go that you should get back together with this great guy and also get back on track to your old medical career rather than waste your life in a morgue and you've got a fun TV show.  An evil Red Bull parody company also makes the show even more interesting too.

iZombie does have a bit of Veronica Mars feel to it since it's made by the same team, but it isn't the same show with Veronica as a zombie as some people who haven't watched either show claim.  The characters in this aren't teens so don't have teen issues for one.  They are completely different personalities to the ones in Veronica Mars too.  Although the show is obviously aimed at a teen/early twenties audience.  It also has a bit of a Buffy the Vampire feel to it too.

The show only has zombies in it in this first season anyway, someone asks the producers about that in the ComicCon panel interview in the extras if you want to know if there will be other creatures. There's also a few short deleted scenes on the DVDs.  The show is based on a graphic novel series.  You could imagine if the flavour of the time so to speak wasn't zombies they could easily have made this show as iVampire or something substituting eating brain to drinking blood of the corpses in the morgue or something and had the same show.",1460505600,,3347,4.5407653910149754

7314285,4,B010MZ4D00,"iResisted. But finally, iSurrendered. Since it was recently announced that iZombie has been renewed for a 3rd season, can one be blamed for tuning in to find out what all the fuss is about? While I never miss an episode of The Walking Dead, I'm nonetheless far from a zombie connoisseur (I love vampires, and zombies are to vampires what canned tuna is to freshly caught Alaska salmon). No matter. iZombie is arguably pleasurable for non-aficionados. Caveat: I'm biased since Rose McIver (who portrays the protagonist, Liv) is my new crush. But if you have eyes for men instead, then you get at least FIVE for the price of one: Malcolm Goodwin, Robert Buckley, Rahul Kohli, King Arthur... and of course David Anders, who always does well in playing the villain. Wait, King Arthur? Yes, because I can't see actor Bradley James as anything else after 5 seasons of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Merlin/dp/B00MBQYKG6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Merlin</a>.

As is standard in 21st century television, there's a developing story arc beyond the murder of the week (oh, forgot to mention: iZombie is basically a police procedural). When did supernatural cop shows become a thing, anyway? I think it may have been with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forever-Knight/dp/B001RV1TXI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forever Knight</a>, which is today tiresome but was well ahead of its time in 1992. Rather than flashbacks to various centuries  la Forever Knight, the gimmick of iZombie (which apparently is carried over from the comic book) is that Liv inherits memories of the dead whose brains she eats. As you can imagine, this will lead to almost limitless possibilities, but what I find most appealing is that Liv also temporarily inherits personality traits. Talk about walking a mile in someone's shoes...

Yeah, I'm not so sure we really needed another police procedural, but there's loads of humor in iZombie, and who doesn't need more laughs in life? Reminds me a little of Buffy, but the hero of iZombie is using her brains [no pun intended] rather than her slaying abilities to fight evil. The humor plus Rose McIver will keep me coming back: if that makes me shallow, then so be it.",1458432000,7,2266,5.45014245014245

It's funny, very different with a great array of actors. I really like that 'most' of these actors havn't been in any thing big, the only actor I know that has been in a lot of things and always plays the evil/bad guy is David Anders. He is amazing in everything he is in. I first saw him make his big debut in Alias as Sark, he then went on to play one of the main villains in season 2 of Heroes and has popped up in Vampire Diaries and other shows. He plays the Zombie who turns our main character Rose McIver. Rose is great in this show, she's weird, awkward, funny, but it also trying really hard to do good (and not kill people for a living for their brains, unlike David Anders character). Season 1 starts off slowish, but picks off towards the end. Another stand out is Bradley James, now rocking black hair and great abs :P - you'll know him from the British show Merlin, he played Arthur. I must be honest I did enjoy this show. but it in no way compares to Veronica Mars. This show is more light-hearted and unfortunately is as funny.

I had not been interested, as I'm rather ""over"" zombies, but I caught a few episodes on Netflix, and I was HOOKED. I had to get it on DVD, and I'm glad I did. The hero, Liv Moore, really hits my underserved button- the hero who is not proud of what she has to do, but she does it because it's the right thing, and she's making the best of her terrible situation. She sacrifices so that others don't have to suffer, and she reminds me a bit of Sam Winchester from Supernatural in that regard.
While it has the heroism I mentioned, and it can be (infrequently) violent and dark, it also has a lot of humor and light-heartedness, especially with the ""changes"" brought about when Liv eats a brain that causes a ""mercurial"" shift in personality. She's still Liv, but with an outside influence- makes for some funny gags, especially with her boss and best friend, Ravi. He's a hoot.

7314306,5,B010MZ4D00,"As most know this is a series that was a mid-season pickup last year, and as such did not get a ton of hype like many of the shows that start out right away in the fall (that was pretty much reserved for The Flash on the CW last season).  It is another series based on a comic book. created by the show-runners of Veronica Mars.

The premise of the show is that a medical student, Olivia Moore, played by Rose McIver is turned into a Zombie during a boat party.  She ends up distancing herself from everyone in her life (to keep them safe) and starts working in the police morgue where she starts to help a new detective played by Malcolm Goodwin solve murders.  He thinks she is psychic, but she really gets visions of the murder victims by eating their brains.  The only person who knows she is really a zombie is her boss at the morgue, played by Rahul Kohli, who is trying to help Liv find a cure for zombieism.

The show is one that has a case of the week format, with a larger story arcs playing out in the background that eventually come together by the end of the season.  It does take a couple episodes to find its groove, but it does so relatively quickly.  It sets up a larger story with multiple ""bad guys""  one of which is played by the great David Anders (of Alias and Heroes) and another which reveals itself later in the season and carries into season 2.  Liv's ex-fiance Major played by Robert Buckley has an increasing role in the story as the season goes on, and Aly Michalka who plays Liv's roommate Payton is the main recurring character of season 1.

For those who get the DVDs the set is fairly light on extras.  Just a few deleted scenes and a portion of the comic-con panel.  The comic-con thing is about a half hour and provides insight into what the show runners were going for, like not adhering strictly to the comic, and how the actors approached their roles.  Good for what is there, but there definitely could be more.  Although it is probably lucky that the show got a regular DVD release and was not relegated to MOD DVD-R discs like a lot of series have been.

While some who were familiar with the comic book may hate that the show really just uses the comic as the guide and does not follow it to a t may not like the show, but I think anyone who is into the more supernatural/superhero genre of shows and movies who do not fall into that category should give it a chance.  It is well written, has a talented ensemble cast with actors who were recognizable but not necessarily household names (and others for whom this is really their first big break).  Rose McIver does a great job as Liv, and has the range as an actress to play a range of characters, because she essentially takes on a new personality each week.  She owns the role so much that it is hard to imagine anyone else doing as good a job with that role.  Whether you stream the show or buy the DVD set it is definitely worth checking out.

++++++Update++++++
As most are aware now, there is a blu-ray available for both seasons 1 and 2.  Frankly I am amazed since this is the first time I can remember a series released only on DVD (since the advent of blu-ray) has actually switched over to the other format (not counting shows that were already on DVD, like the Sopranos).  It seems to be the trend now that only very popular shows even get a regular DVD release, and only the most popular of those gets blu-ray releases.  If anything a show will get a blu-ray release and then switch to DVD (like The Americans), or go from DVD to DVD-R (Hart of Dixie, American Dad etc) or DVD-R to nothing (like You're the Worst).  The blu ray A/V quality is very good.  The extras are the same as the regular DVD release.  Nothing new there unfortunately.  It is a bit pricey for the short season and for some may be a double dip, but I think it is worth it to see a show with great visuals in the true HD format.",1447632000,5,3903,4.259158751696065

I'm burned out on everything zombie way to much  saturation overall
When you have zombies selling smart phones, eye drops and KFC something is wrong!
It's no longer cool and underground it's mainstream and rotting away

As much as I'm sick of zombies and comic book adaptions
iZombie is a new animal  that is fresh and new there is nothing else like it on tv
Based of a Vertigo Comic (which i never heard of been out of the comic loop for a long time)
The guys who wrote this are smart they crafted a unique vision of the old tried and true ""Who Done it Mystery"" and added neat little tweaks

It's like Psych with a real  psychic that only gets visions by eating human brains
by eating the brains Liv takes the persons memories and characteristics and all that's new and fresh!

Once you watch the Pilot you either understand it and be in on the joke or you're just straight up dislike everything about this
The pilot throws out George R. Romero's name and Night of the Living Dead
Liv  is watching NOTLD on tv in the morgue
It also throws in the iconic  eating of brains made famous by Dan O'Bannon's Return of the Living Dead

The Cast is really good:
Rose McIver  as  Olivia 'Liv' Moore  (a little wacky for a name but, it grows on you and works for the overall series)  Never seen anything else she's been in but, this role impresses me more every week!
also the make-up and her overall look is very good!
 Malcolm Goodwin  as homicide detective Clive Babineaux  (Malcolm gets to play the hero cops which is cool mostly know him from A&E Breakout Kings) he's also very impressive in this role!
Rahul Kohli  as  Dr. Ravi Chakrabarti (plays Liv's Boss at the morgue like him to he fits with everyone else)
Robert Buckley  as  Major Lilywhite  (i think the actor is enjoyable to watch I hate the name though it's so terrible)
David Anders  as Blaine DeBeers  (great character actor who gets to shine in this series)
Aly Michalka  as Peyton Charles
Molly Hagan  as Liv's mother  Eva Moore
Steven Weber has this guest starring role as  Vaughn Du Clark the head of the Energy Drink Max Rager (The Max Rager Company is set up like Umbrella Corporation in the Resident Evil Games) It sounds silly but, it makes a lot of sense once you get into this series

This series needs a lot more attention on it (This is one of Network tv best kept secrets)
Season One is a massive epilogue to set up everything else
Even if you are burned out by the whole zombie fad give this series a chance it's different and doesn't try to copy everyone else

7314315,4,B010MZ4D00,"I like the irony of main character being a zombie named ""Liv Moore.""  Liv is fun, funny, sexy, dedicated and self-sacrificing.

As long the zombies in this series eat brains, they maintain there minds.  However when they're threatened, or stressed, they temporarily turn into mindless killing machines.  Also if starved long enough, they become classic zombies - slow moving, rotting flesh, completely mindless. Also they temporarily take on some parts of the personalities of whoever's brain they eat, often with vary humorous results.

The zombies are only part of the show.  This is also a crime series.  Individual episodes involve various murders.  Telling the motives for such crimes, and showing unusual means of committing murder.  Liv uses the skills and memories she gains from the victim's brain to help catch their killers.

The main Zombie Bad Guy is Blaine DeBeers.  Before turning, he'd just been a low member of organized crime.  Afterwards he slowly made the city his. The season as a whole shows him taking over a city.

He turned people, to gain control of them.  First he turned several members of the wealthy and influential.  Then turned those in positions of power, including the Chief of Police.  He had each completely blackmailed.  None had any choice, short of dying or turning fully.  He built a criminal organization to supply brains for them.  Gaining a quad of Zombie servants in the process.

I didn't expect to like this, but it's surprisingly good.",1445731200,,1482,5.020576131687243
7314316,4,B010MZ4D00,"Whodda thunk that George Romero's low budget zombie flick, ""Night of the Living Dead"" would have sprouted it's very own genre in filmdom. Yes, there were zombie flicks prior to his, but those zombies had nothing on his flesh eating, stumble walking nasties. It has now gotten to the point where the genre can lampoon itself and ""iZombie"" does it up great.

Here's the scoop. Med student Olivia Moore (Rose McIver) attends a party where a new designer drug is happening and it causes the party to erupt into a flesh eating brawl. She gets scratched by one of the stricken then killed. She wakes up in a body bag and, in little time, deduces that she's become a zombie. With her medical background, she also figures she can stave off the worst of it if she ingests human brains. She goes from med student to medical examiner for the police where her co-worker, Dr. Ravi Chakrabarti (Rahul Kohli) figures things out and wants to find a cure for her. And since she sees what the victims in the morgue see after she eats their brains, she's able to help detective Babineaux (Clive Goodwin) solve murders. There's more but this paragraph is already too long.

This is some really fun viewing. Though I have some reservations about the Babineaux character/acting, the rest of the cast is outstanding. McIver does a sweet job at trying to adjust to her new life without letting her family and now, ex-fiance, know what has happened. Then you throw other zombies in the mix that are killing homeless young folk to get their brains for other zombie clients. David Anders, as chief bad zombie Blaine DeBeers, also does an outstanding job. McIvers' co-worker is a cool Brit/Indian mix and her ex-fiance Major Lilywhite (Robert Buckley) does well as the confused ex who is also a social worker trying to get to the bottom of why the homeless kids have gone missing.

This is filled with a lot of in-jokes from a plethora of zombie flicks. There is a lot of snappy dialogue and nifty mysteries to solve. But much of what makes this work are the characters. They are written and cast well.

It's set in Seattle so the 'hip' factor is really high. If you like comedy/mystery/thrillers that are far left of center, this should do you well.",1445472000,,2222,4.631979695431472

2. Episode stories are contemporary with issues, at times, still under popular media scrutiny.
3. Seattle setting (although filmed in B.C.), props, science (except for memory-by-eating, which is flat out stupidly wrong) & detective work are all fairly accurate.
Negatives:
1. Acting is robotic, predictable.
2. Too many, demographic under age 35, eye-candy actors with corresponding stereotypic behaviors, e.g. models with tight clothing and a few skin shots to highlight personal trainers at work. Simply, just not real, but appealing to the wishful  thinking, fantasy living viewers.
3. A poor ""borrowing"" of Orphan Black blended with past shows fed to zombism loving tele geeks.
4. Crime stories tend to play out as superficial and predictable. Each like the other, and like most crime series made the past dozen years, are produced like mass marketing packaging. Just change a few ingredients and repackage as a new episode.",1444608000,,1022,5.468354430379747
7314319,4,B010MZ4D00,"In the world of television writing, theres a collection of names which, besides being known as creators of various series, are renowned for having pretty awful luck when it comes to how their shows get treated by the networks they end up on. For some, like Aaron Sorkin its somewhat self-imposed (he walked away after three seasons of West Wing, got shut down on Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, and gave up on The Newsroom), while for others like Bryan Fuller (Dead Like Me, Pushing Daisies, Hannibal,Mockingbird Lane), Joss Whedon (Firefly, Dollhouse), and Rob Thomas (Veronica Mars, Party Down, iZombie), its more of a case of studios not knowing quite how to handle the shows as they tend to fall between easily definable genres. If iZombie is any indication, however, for at least Rob Thomas the curse of studio mismanagement might finally be over.

With Veronica Mars, Rob Thomas brought the concept of crime-of-the-week television woven together with longer form storytelling to the teenage high school drama, and he did it without pandering to the younger demographic or using his platform as a full-time marketing tool to target them for 42-minutes every week. Instead, he told the story of a father and daughter detective agency where work starts to creep into their personal lives.

iZombie effectively inverts that concept with promising medical student Liv Moores (Rose McIver) personal life seeping into and overriding her professional career, after a boat party turns into chaos amidst a zombie breakout that leaves her infected but self-aware as long as she snacks on brains regularly to keep her zombie impulses at bay. With her newfound affliction, Liv has to significantly change the way she lives her life and so she goes from would-be doctor to a medical examiner in the morgue, engaged to single, and tanned brunette to white-haired, albino. Its a change that understandably alarms her family, ex-fiance Major (Robert Buckley), and roommate (Aly Michalka), and its only further complicated by Livs inability to explain to them why due to the phenomenon of zombies still being considered a fiction by the rest of the world.

The only people aware of Livs zombie condition are her supervisor at work, Dr. Ravi Chakrabarti (Rahul Kohli), who bubbles over with excitement at the prospect of having a disease to try to cure as a hobby (which is a subplot that bears fruit further on in the season), and Blaine (David Anders), the zombie who infected her the night of the boat party and who also happens to be the kingpin behind a brain catering service that preys on runaway and overlooked teens and provides their brains to the surprisingly large community of zombies living among normal humanity.

Luckily for Liv, she doesnt need Blaines service to supply her with brains, as being a medical examiner (and having a supervisor whos thrilled by her condition) means she gets all the brains she can eat from the poor souls wheeled into their office every week. This practice also leads to Livs discovery that she gets snippets of memory (and personality) from the brains of the deceased that she eats, pushing her to become more involved in homicide investigations with Detective Babineaux (Malcolm Goodwin) who believes her to be a psychic and a personal crusade against a corporation that might knowingly be selling a beverage that induces zombie rage upon consumption.

The seasons arc ends in a pretty spectacular fashion that defies expectations while also opening up the larger hidden world of zombies.

Keeping that in mind, iZombie definitely has a few of the fits and starts youd expect from a series figuring out where it wants to take things and how its wants to use the rules it establishes for itself. For one, the zombie-strength concept is leaned on pretty heavily in the first half of the season but then is rarely if ever touched on again in the final episodes. Its unclear as to whether or not the writers decided it was an element of being a zombie they wanted to drop entirely or if they just couldn't find ways to tie it to the final episodes. A second bump is the shift of arc of Major who goes through some pretty serious ups and downs and finishes out the season as something of a badass. Its something of an extreme transition from where he starts, and you could chalk it up to desperation and frustration, but all in all it just feels like too much change for one character in a 13-episode season (even if it does produce one of the best sequences in the seasons finale).

iZombie finds a rare sweet spot in comic-to-TV adaptation by being a perfect fit in writer Rob Thomass wheelhouse (its essentially Veronica Mars but with Zombies) and cashing in on the zombie craze. Which means, at its foundation, it has everything it needs to succeed: a showrunner who knows exactly what to do with a crime-of-the-week format layered over a larger story and a popular trend to exploit. When you couple that with placement on a second-tier, teen-oriented network that doesnt have to worry as much about ratings and thus can let shows develop and spread their wings, iZombie should be running for years to come.

7314322,4,B010MZ4D00,"iZombie: The Complete First Season stars Rose McIver as Olivia Liv Moore, a medical resident on the fast track to a perfect life until shes turned into a zombie. Now stuck between half-alive and undead, Liv transfers to the city morgue to access reluctantly the only thing that allows her to maintain her humanity  human brains (frequently seasoned with hot sauce and garnished with lettuce). But there are side effects to Livs new diet. With each brain she consumes, she experiences flashes of the corpses memories including clues as to how they were killed. Her boss, a brilliant but eccentric conspiracy theorist, encourages her to embrace this gift and to work with unproven homicide detective Clive Babineaux (Malcolm Goodwin) to help solve these murders and quiet the voices in her head.

The show differs from other portrayals of zombies in that Liv isn't a smelly, shuffling, blood-soaked, slow moving monster. She speaks, thinks, and fixates on the pointlessness of her endless non-life, and actually holds down a job. Its intriguing to see what its like to be a zombie from the point-of-view of a zombie. The show is a blend of horror thriller and police procedural. The tone of the early episodes is fairly comic with some dramatic moments thrown in. By the end of Season 1, this balance is switched where the episodes are mostly drama with clever dialogue.

The program offers a fresh take on the zombie character, which has been extremely popular the last several years. Tapping into this popularity,  producers look for ways to create novel spins on zombie tales just as Hollywood kept reinventing the image of the vampire for more than 80 years. Liv is probably the most human-like zombie depicted in numerous movies and TV shows. Shes portrayed as an outsider, a troubled soul longing for her former life, but determined to do some good for society  the Robin Hood of Zombiedom. Ms. McIver has a sweet face that suggests frailty and innocence, yet when threatened, her eyes glow red and she shifts into action mode to lash out.

Bonus features on the 3-disc DVD set include the iZombie 2014 Comic-Con Panel and deleted scenes.",1443312000,2,2142,4.903314917127072

7314325,5,B010MZ4D00,"Olivia ""Liv"" Moore is a dedicated medical intern that always achieves the highest she can. One day, she decides to let loose a little and go on a boat party, but it turns out to be a zombie filled death trap. She is scratched by a zombie and becomes one herself. To keep her condition a secret, she quits school, breaks up with her fiance Major Lilywhite, and gets a job in a morgue for guilt-free brain access. When she eats brains, she discovers she intermittently gets the memories of the deceased and inherits some of their personality traits for a short time. She uses her newfound power to solve crimes along with her morgue coworker Ravi, who knows about her zombie state, and Detective Clive Babineaux, who she's fooled into thinking she's a psychic.

iZombie is the only zombie show on TV that isn't totally serious and post-apocalyptic. Despite the obvious darkness of the subject matter (murder, zombies, brain eating, etc.), the tone of the show is light and it brings a lot of humor. It's also the only show on TV with a zombie as a main character instead of as a mindless shambler. Zombies in this world are the product of some sort of drug. They need brains to live and becomes super pale with colorless hair when turned. With a steady diet of brains, they look pretty normal if you ignore their new coloring. With those brains comes memories of whoever the brain belonged to, usually triggered by a similar event in their life to a memory, and some aspects of their personality. Without brains or when afraid, they turn feral: super strong, red eyes, and very little cognition. Zombies also have a strong constitution. Flesh wounds don't even hurt, but more brains need to go towards healing. Destroying the brain is really the only way to kill them.

Liv Moore is our intrepid protagonist. She changes every episode because of her zombie ability, so sometimes Liv is a martial artist or an artist or an alcoholic or a paranoid schizophrenic. Rose McIver does a wonderful job of making these ever changing aspects just part of Liv. It's easy to make it a different character every episode, but it just brings out different parts of Liv's personality and allows her to work out her emotions and problems as well as solve murder mysteries. Throughout the series, she gets to know who she really is through other people. She is challenged, pushed to her limits, and experiences tragedy. However, she also finds where her boundaries lie and defines who she is and what she's willing to do in extreme circumstances. For example, Liv won't kill someone is cold blood, but she will kill someone in self defense. I didn't always agree with her and she made mistakes along the way, but she grew in the end. She also reassesses what's important in her life and reconnects with the estranged people in her life.

After the attack, Liv is a zombie in every way. Sure, she is physically a zombie, but she's withdrawn from every aspect of her life. Her friends and family don't see her anymore and lost their previous close relationship. She broke up with her fiance Major, much to his confusion, even though she still has feelings for him. She had a successful medical residency, but also threw it away to become a coroner's assistant for nonviolent brain access. When I explained the premise of the show out loud, I noticed that it can be read as an allegory for sexual assault or rape. Liv, a fresh faced successful woman, goes to a party. She's offered drugs and refuses, then the drug dealer slaps her ass, clearly not respecting her refusal and feeling like he's allowed to touch her body. Later, this same drug dealer forces the drug upon her anyway in the form of a scratch and she becomes a zombie. She doesn't really tell anyone about her condition or her attack and she would rather withdraw from her whole life rather than put her loved ones at risk. I've heard of and known many women who hid their sexual assaults from people because they wouldn't be believed or they didn't want to subject themselves to the disbelief, ridicule, and vilification that often comes from going public with a situation like this. Liv uses her zombie powers for good, eventually reconnects with her friends and family, and takes control of her life back. She refuses to let this attack define her even though it has changed her.

Rose McIver drives the show as the main character, but the supporting cast is amazing. My favorite supporting character is Ravi, portrayed by Rahul Kohli. He takes Liv's revelation and issues in stride plus works to create a cure. He accepts her absolutely and is her main support throughout the series. Major Lilywhite, Liv's ex-fiance. started off as too squeaky clean and annoying, but came into his own about halfway through the series. By the last episode, he was pretty badass and impressive. David Anders plays the series' main villain. Right from the get go, he has a weirdly charismatic presence while still succeeding being sinister and menacing. He is cheerfully evil and nonchalantly commits murder or any other number of horrific crimes. I love to hate him and he's a formidable villain. The whole cast performs well and there are really no weak links.

iZombie is a wonderful show that's fun, sometimes disturbing, and full of real emotion. It's based on a comic book, but shares very little with it. It pays homage to the comic book in the stylized animated opening theme song and in the freeze frame comic book scenes at the beginning of some scenes. The familiar police procedural mixed with zombies is what it starts with, but becomes so much more by the end of the season. I'm very pleased with it and I can't wait for it to return in October.",1441843200,6,5687,4.683

7314329,5,B010MZ4D00,"This show was such a pleasant surprise to discover; the only reason I was able to find this show was through watching The Flash and Arrow. In between commercials for these two shows, they occasionally show commercials for iZombie, but I've always ignored them. Eventually over time I start noticing them more and more and I was getting really intrigued. After my friend, who's also big comic book/manga nerd like I am, recommended me to watch iZombie, I decided to finally give it a chance.

I was hooked on the first show. The atmosphere is dark and playful at the same time, the dialog is quick and witty, and the plot is crazy! Girl scratched by a zombie becomes a zombie herself and can only feed her hunger with brains. She gains the memories and experiences of the eaten brain for a certain amount of time and uses this skill to help her detective friend solve their deaths. OMG who thinks of this stuff?!?!

It's not just the stereotypical crime at the beginning of the show, everything comes together at the end, almost everyone looks like a model kind of show. I mean it is, but they do it soooo much better than most shows I've seen. The show continues along at a great pace, the characters are so well developed and intriguing that I wish I knew them in real life, and they keep surprising me with each show. The brain eating aspect really brings some incredibly situations and first person views of the victims and I think that it really adds to the originality of the show.",1440115200,,1486,4.520446096654275
7314330,5,B010MZ4D00,"I have only one complaint about this show and that's they seem to be sticking with just Zombies hopefully that will change in Season 2. Still great cast great story each episode feels like it's a journey. I mean you get to see different types of people in one person and thus you get amazing insight into various characters all for the price of one. This makes Liv a very layered and complex character but also the show is nothing without it's villain Blaine played by the phenomenal David Anders.

All in all you must see this show just don't watch while eating.",1439251200,,563,4.466019417475728
7314331,5,B010MZ4D00,"I taped these on my DVR when CW first aired them and I've got to say that I'm rather addicted to watching them. I kind of like how every week the zombie brain Liv eats helps her gain a bit of perspective in her life as well as solve the case. Although, I like how the core parts of her don't change like in the episode when she par takes of sniper brain, she may have the ptsd and the mad paintball skills but she can't put her new military sniper skills to use because she had taken the Hippocratic oath as a doctor and that personality trait of hers counteracts the digested brains. All in all, I can't wait to see what happens next in this really great new show. I really loved Rob Thomas' Veronica Mars and this show is just as good so any fans of Veronica Mars should most definitely watch this show.",1438128000,,805,4.13375796178344
7314332,1,B010MZ4D00,"Absolutely superb show! 5/5
It deserves your ratings and your money. Watch it!
Great show!!!!

All that said, I'm to the point where I am tired of cheaped out releases from studios. Yeah, I'd like to support the show and it's good enough to almost want to support regardless of the release type. But I've kind of had it at this point and won't get suckered into buying some sub-standard release just to show support for a show, no matter how much I love it. It's time they stopped trying to sucker people that way.

So please watch the show but don't fall for this kind of sad DVD only release. This set offers picture quality that is FAR worse than what was broadcast over the air. This is 2015 and people have 1080p sets at worst, if not 4k, and they are offering only 480i on this set!

Yes this set has 6x worse picture quality than what was broadcast!

It's an insult in 2015 to peddle such a shockingly poor set of discs as the only disc option.

Another terrible low-def only release for a show that deserves so much more.

Would you stand for a VHS release? Because that is basically what this is in 2015.

Do you want season 2 to be Betamax only?

Then ask WB to release this in a proper hi-def format and not only in DVD with abysmal picture and tepid audio quality and to deliver the consumer a decent product! They go on about lost sales and this and that, but deliver a reasonable product and maybe people will pay. Don't and maybe they won't.",1437177600,23,1456,4.288321167883212
