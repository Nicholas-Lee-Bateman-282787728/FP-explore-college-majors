Some people get their just rewards, although I wouldn't wish it on the worst of them. Acting wasn't bad at all.",1430611200,,259,4.098039215686274
6797689,5,B00PCKG1QU,"Axe To Grind provided what very 'B' movie fan loves!  A plot that is fun, yet somewhat predictable at times. (I love anticipation that something is gonna be happening, just not sure when) Good acting, a mix of humor & horror, fair amount of gore and just the right amount of sexiness to keep it from being about, well.....T&A!  It is a star above any big budget Hollywood movie that relies solely on celebrity status, over the top budgets and of course......computer generated graphics!  This is a real movie, and I will 'B' waiting a sequel!  Hope one comes out!",1429920000,3,563,4.6
6797690,4,B00PCKG1QU,"If you rate this movie based on what it is - a b-movie about b-movies, then I think you'll have some fun with this one. I honestly think this is one of Debbie Rochon's best acting performances, period. The film, itself, is fairly dark, actually - more serious than I expected from this type of movie. For T&A and blood/gore fans, there is only a moderate amount of each. This one is really about her character and the unfolding story. Citizen Kane? No. But, I have to say it was much more than your typical walkthrough b-horror movie - it was actually an interesting film to watch, a step above what I'd expected. It's actually not ""gratuitous sex and violence with very little plot"" ; )",1428537600,3,687,4.4603174603174605

6797694,3,B00PCKG1QU,"Axe To Grind is a new movie I had high hopes for, because I am a fan of Debbie Rochon and I'm also a slasher fan (although not near as much as I used to be). Unfortunately, Axe To Grind is nothing special. It's an indie horror film that's low on everything that a good indie horror needs. It isn't scary, it isn't funny, and it wastes what little sex appeal it has early on. After seeing this and some of Rochon's other recent movies, I can say that her career peaked back in the early to mid 2000's when she was in movies like Terror Firmer, American Nightmare, and Bikini Bloodbath.",1424995200,5,584,4.223214285714286

Oh well, I won't be bothering to see it.

6797705,3,B00PCKG1QU,"Technically it's a 2.5 stars. The only reason is Debbie.
Yes, it's a mock of B horror movies, done in a Z movie way, the script is basically a steaming pile, speckled with homages to various other B movies. The thing is it can't quite decide what it wanted to be, a parody, a movie , something else parading as a movie. The plot, the core plot, that doesn't really get fully realized til the last twenty or so minutes. There are so many ways it could have been better, it could have focused more on making a parody, while still having a decent plot, instead of being a jumble of movie.
Debbie's acting and character really make the movie, while the others seem to be just moving plot devices (yes, b horror movies do this, but at least there's more than whining, usually) . Norman's character could have been more interesting, but getting past the voice he did was pretty hard.

6797710,5,B00PCKG1QU,"I've been a fan of Debbie Rochon since I saw ""American Nightmare"". In my opinion she has a knack for being a convincing psychopathic killer. I'm altogether happy with this little gem of B-horror!",1433721600,,195,4.764705882352941

6797713,3,B00PCKG1QU,"The story offers up some cheeky humor with dialog that is delivered with zest. Sometimes the acting falls flat and feels contrived, but for the most part ""Axe To Grind"" runs smoothly. Debbie Rochon is all about her character from the word go! I imagine playing this character was a bit cathartic. On the down side, the story is weak and clich, with all the expected moments set up in touchstone formula. Some of the dramatic scenes step into the ""over acted"" stage, but the cast is committed to their characters and it shows on screen. This makes for an entertaining b-movie spectacle.

The special effects are on the cheaper side but acceptable, and they work their necessary magic to sell the screens. I did see some CGI blood spray, something I detest, but there was enough respect for the genre that organic blood splatter and practical effects are plenty in ""Axe To Grind"". The sound track and sound effects are the standard streams of instrumental affair. The music and effects work, they get you into the attitude and fun headspace of "" Axe To Grind "".

Overall, "" Axe To Grind"" falls short of the desired energy that the story and acting demands. The film keeps an even upward momentum, it just doesn't completely carry the thrills and chills with it. It has a staged feel haunts the sequences. A set 'em up, knock 'em down"" type deal. But their is a female slasher, the carnage is present, and Rochon is entertaining on screen. Check it out, just know that it barely gets above mediocre overall.",1431216000,,1504,4.629213483146067
6797714,4,B00PCKG1QU,Axe To Grind fits right where you'd expect for B movie horror. A fun mix of crazy evil people and good old fashioned killings. I'm glad I added this to my collection along with The Cellar Door and Brain Dead. Good times. Grab some munchies and you'll have a good time.,1430870400,,268,4.2745098039215685
6797715,3,B00PCKG1QU,"* I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I have to state right up front that this film is one you will either love or hate, and I will wager many people will hate it.  I will explain why later.  For me, though, I liked it for the most part.  I never get tired of seeing Debbie Rochon onscreen, even in low-budget indies like this one.  And although the storyline is simplistic, its still a lot of fun (if you look past the flaws).  Granted, there are many things about the film that could have been betterbut everything about it overall works for me on a base level.

I should probably also state this is one of those films that is so bad, its good.  This statement alone will explain a lot about why I like it so much.

AXE TO GRIND looks like it was shot on home video cameras for the most part, and therefore does not have a lot of cinematic value.  The lighting is decent for the most part, although there are a couple of darkened shots that could have been lit better.  The sound, thankfully, is good, so we don't have any problems hearing the dialogue.

The acting is about what you would expect from a B-movie.  I love Debbie Rochon, so she always entertains me, regardless of her role.  Another noteworthy performance is given by Michelle Tomlinson, who plays fellow scream-queen Cheryl.  I first saw Tomlinson back in 2011, in a lesser-known film I reviewed for Hayes Hudsons House of Horror titled BRAIN DEAD.  She impressed me then, and continues to impress me now.  The rest of the cast, however, is a take-them-or-leave-them group.  Nobody really gives a horrible performanceyet, I don't think anyone in the cast will win any awards for their acting anytime soon, either.

The special effects are ok, however I absolutely hate CG blood-splatters.  The several we see in AXE TO GRIND are poorly done, and therefore come across as cartoonish.  I understand CG is a cost-saving tool, however gore cannot be a secondary aspect in a horror film and should always be given its due.

Yet, even with all of its flaws, theres something satisfactory about seeing Rochon dole out her vengeance on a group of clueless scream-queens who have slept with her husband.  She even takes out the director and his cohorts (although I never quite caught on as to whymaybe her character is just that demented!).  My sole (major) complaint about the film is that I didn't understand the ending.  I don't really know what her big performance was or even who the creepy caretaker was supposed to be.

I cant honestly recommend AXE TO GRIND, unless you're a big fan of B-movies or Debbie Rochon.  And even then, you have to give this one a lot of leeway.  If you can do that, however, youll be in for a minor treat.",1430784000,,2735,4.504065040650406
