8615088,5,B00FF1BJ18,"One of my favorite movies of all time.  A wonderful send-up of vampire movies with a somber Dracula (played by Christopher Lee) who only wants to pass on his legacy to his last surviving heir, who happens to be a short, dispossessed nobleman who's fallen on hard times, and whose castle has been turned into a hotel, with him as a bell boy.  Swooning, adoring female victims stalk the newly-initiated, transitioning vampire through the castle, followed by a group of angry husbands.

In the realm of horror film spoofs, this one is a gem.",1513296000,,538,4.702127659574468

8615092,3,B00FF1BJ18,"I'm glad this was done from an fine quality print, however, the whole first reel of the original film, UNCLE WAS A VAMPIRE/ HARD TIMES FOR VAMPIRE is missing, and replaced by the new titles with the 'Dracula Cha-Cha-Cha' instead of the oirginal opening music. And little bits are missing, maybe a few seconds, but stll...the end title has been replaced by the new type of titles...in other words until somebody decides to put this out in a proper video in its original widescreen version, we will have to be content with this version, tampered with as it is.

I give it a 7.5 out of 10.",1408320000,3,586,4.4766355140186915
8615093,4,B00FF1BJ18,"Uncle was a Vampire, presented on this dvd in letterbox widescreen format and color, is rare indeed. It's an Italian comedy that thankfully, has been dubbed into English here. A lot of movies came from Italy in those days, like the Hercules movies or the spagetti westerns. It's t's a fun flick about a count who's down on his luck so he has to sell his castle. To make matters worse, his uncle pays him a visit. Uncle of course is the titular vampire. When uncle goes out is search of blood, things get a bit wacky.",1381017600,5,516,4.329896907216495
