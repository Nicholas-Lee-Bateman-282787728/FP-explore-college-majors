8471536,5,B000EOTW7O,"This is a great deal! You get two big boxing documentaries. The first one is a 90 minute film where Reggie Jackson interacts with Larry Holmes, Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Ken Norton, and George Foreman. They discuss their careers, their fights with each other, and the film is augmented by classic fight footage.

Plus, there is a bonus feature called Dinner with the Champs, where Reggie interviews the all time heavyweight greats while they are eating at a banquet. This half hour bonus footage was the best part of the whole package! Ali and Frazier almost go out at it again a few times (I think that Frazier had too much to drink)!

There is also a wonderful second dvd featuring the great Latin fighters Roberto Duran, Alexis Arguello, Carlos Ortiz, Kid Gavilan, and Salvador Sanchez. None of these boxers ever faced each other in the ring, so this dvd lacked the dynamic interaction of the heavyweight dvd, but it would have cost me $[...] to get these both in separate purchases, and so I have nothing to complain about now!

For $[...], this is a must buy for boxing fans!",1169251200,2,1081,4.649214659685864
