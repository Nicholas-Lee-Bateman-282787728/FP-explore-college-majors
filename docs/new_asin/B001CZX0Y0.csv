8290550,5,B001CZX0Y0,I got this set for my scuba diving husband as a gift.  He loves it!  It has been interesting to see how views have changed over the years.  There is an episode on Killer Whales.  They are portrayed as evil beasts and must be eradicated.  Glad we now have a far more educated and benevolent view of creatures that share our earth.,1302825600,,329,4.241935483870968
8290551,3,B001CZX0Y0,"Basic labels could be better.  No extras.  I was missing 2 episodes on the last disc and the other 2 episodes where repeats, from within this collection.
Great Show.",1285718400,,165,4.655172413793103
8290552,3,B001CZX0Y0,"As I suspected, I had this already.  An old computer bud of mine gave me some old .avi files on cd years ago, of the series he recorded off Canadian TV.  These are the same files, they even have the CFCF, Channel 12 logos and G rating marks on the videos.

The box says ""Digitally Remastered"", ""Sound Enhanced"", ""With Intereactive Menus"".  Well one out of three ain't too good.  These are recorded from TV to tape and transferred to computer for digital media, no remastering or sound enhancement apparent, in any of the copies.  Whoever put these together did go to the time and trouble to put in interactive menus, but thats about it, no remastering, the edge static lines are still present on the tops and bottoms of the picture, indicating the use of tape somewhere in the process.  If you are a fan of the show they are great to have ust be aware of what youare getting.",1234828800,5,875,4.43125
