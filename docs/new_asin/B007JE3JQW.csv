5090895,1,B007JE3JQW,"I was hoping for something more closely faithful to the book.  Antonio Sabato, could probably have pulled off John Carter, but Traci Lords as the Princess of Mars?  Please?  The princess of mars was young, deeply tanned and petite, but voluptuous.  The creatures of mars were larger and six legged.  The non-human species were green, much taller and had four arms.

If you like B-Class sci/fi fantasies with bad special effects, which normally I do find amusing, you might like it.  Me, I am an Edgar Rice Burroughs fan and would love to see movies that followed the books in their truest form.

We have the technology.  James Cameron?",1264550400,72,635,4.752293577981652
5090896,1,B007JE3JQW,"Avoid this turkey. I love dumb B-movies, but this one isn't even 'funny' bad. It's just bad. The Martians look like brussel sprouts with tusks, and Tracy Lords looks like a greasy corpse. The climax appears to have been filmed in a high school's furnace room. Save your money and 90 minutes of your life.",1264291200,21,304,4.545454545454546
5090897,1,B007JE3JQW,"I agree with these other reviews listed here. There is a reason this ""thing"" went straight to DVD! Unfortunatley the images that kept occurring to me throughout this movie was all early movies that Traci Lord made.",1263686400,4,214,4.8108108108108105
5090898,3,B007JE3JQW,"If you are looking for a great adaptation of ""Princess of Mars,"" you're going to have to wait a while longer because it is NOT here. That doesn't mean this DVD should be immediately discounted, though.

This film is pretty incompetently made. The shots are weak, the editing is poor, and the acting is very stiff. It does, however, provide an interesting adaptation of ""Princess of Mars,"" considering that a 200+ page novel with a lighting quick pace was slimmed down to 90 minutes with a shoestring budget. They did a good job picking a choosing which story elements to focus on and which to cut out. The also did a decent job stringing all of these together in the plot (I hesitate to call it a ""story""). It does not feel as if scenes are missing from the flim, like in some of the ""Harry Potter"" films where scenes from the novels are kept to appease the fans, but crucial setup FOR that scene is omitted. The addition of spiders is somewhat confounding, though...

What works particularly well is the integration of the air pumping station, which I feel is weak and disjointed in the novel. In the book, John Carter stumbles upon it when he escapes from the Green Martians, and later it also serves as a strange, second climax at the end of the book. The scene is totally disjointed and literally takes place 10 years after the rest of the central conflict. In this adaptation, the station serves a more central role in the plot and the central conflict is resolved here. I think the best touch in this adaptation is the distrust the Tharks have of the station. The Tharks think it is a lie when the Red Martians say all life Barsoom depends on this air pumping station; a lie told only to hold power over the Tharks. I like that spin on the source material.

The reason to own this DVD is the great ""Making of"" featurette that runs about 10 minutes. It shows the shortcuts they used to get this film completed with twelve, yes, TWELVE days of shooting. ""Little Miss Sunshine"" shot for a month and that was considered an insanely short shooting schedule. Watching the film with the context given in the featurette serves as a very interesting learning tool for aspiring filmmakers such as myself, showing what can be done with a shoestring budget and how to do it.

So overall, the film gets a nice 2/5, saved only by its good story-editing choices.
The DVD features get a 4/5 for the featurette.

Average, 3/5.",1262304000,92,2415,4.529816513761468

"" First moments reminded me of how I felt when watching `Star Wars' for first time !""
We liked this movie takes you away from everyday issues and into a wild ride with Creatures,Monsters, Traci Lords(For the male geeks) and Antonio Sabato Jr.(For female fans of reality shows).
Great costumes and make-ups thanks to Tom Devlin and Gregory Paul Smith.

5090900,1,B007JE3JQW,I cannot accept the fact that I waited over 50 years to see a film adaptation of my favorite childhood book and this came out first. Save yourself the agony and ignore this ridiculous piece of drek. It bears so little resemblance to the written story that it could be called by another title and no one would suspect that it had its origins in an ERB novel. I shouldn't even mention the acting. I'm sure they were doing their best and it would be cruel to discuss in any more detail. If this thing wasn't so pitiful I would be angry.

This is on par with another classic reinterpretation of John Norman's God. It's the  exploitation of great titles to make big bucks on sewage. Worst possible choices in casting. Sloppy prosthetic makeup. Terrible acting. And even though it's starring a porn star in a role that would have depicted her character authentically as adorned nude, she wasn't... This show has all the quality of a cheap porno without the porn. Therefore, no redeeming qualities, whether you approach it from either a morally upright mind or dirty mind. And action sequences?

5090959,3,B007JE3JQW,"The movie of the Edgar rice Burroughs book is totally unlike and not as interesting as the novel. It lacks the many adventures of the book and changes the story altogether. I suggest that readers look at my review of the novel to see what the book is about.

 Some of the differences are: Jack Carter is not a Civil War veteran, but a sniper in the twenty-first century US Army. He is sent to Mars as part of a science experiment. He is not sent to the nearby Mars but to a planet far away. The people he meets are not green and fifteen feet tall or human-like but red, as in the book. The princess in the film is the head of her people, but she is the granddaughter in the book. The very interesting episodes of the leader of the green men and the secret held by a green woman is not in the movie, nor is the charming stories about the beast that follows him like a dog. The movie focuses on an evil human-like man who wants to control the planet, a story that is not in the book.

 The film was ok to watch, but I thought it wasn't clever and wondered how Burroughs could have written it. This prompted me to read the book, and I was glad I did.",1405555200,3,1147,4.039647577092511

Disney can nearly be depended on to put out something that you don't have to hide from the kids and put under cover in case you have friends over.

It is pure Disney in that it is just fun and lighthearted...you aren't going to be using this as a reference on one of you college papers.

I really get tired of swearing and voyeurism and when you realize that it is one of the brain-children of E.R. Burroughs and if you liked Tarzan...I mean the ""REAL"" story, Lord Greystoke, another great movie that is full of thrilling adventure and imagination. It also doesn't insult the intelligence. It is a lot like H.G. Wells, The Time Machine or a Jules Verne tale.

I, of course, have it now in my collection. It is another classic. It is to be read, but like I tell my students. Shakespeare was never meant to be read...they are Plays and should be introduced as plays or movies (no wonder so many people hate Shakespeare...they had to READ it in high school) The above mentioned stories and authors should be READ first and then seen as movies. Why? Because in reading you develop your own mental vision as the author wanted you to. In movies you are seeing some else's imagination. Both have their place.

That said, this D grade flick borders on the ridiculous.  Nothing about this film makes any sense.  Why is John Carter, fatally wounded in a gun battle suddenly healed when teleported to Mars?  Why can he jump great distances like the Hulk and is as strong as the Submariner?  With his incredible new powers, why did John Carter allow himself to be captured by the reptile-like aliens with tusks?  He could easily have broken his chains and hopped away or smashed every one of captors.  The Traci Lords character spent some time locked in a bamboo cage which had gaps large enough for Rosie O'Donnell to squeeze through, so the still fairly slim former porn star could have easily climbed out and escaped.  Fans of Ms. Lords who watched her unintended child porn flicks in the 1980's may still worship her, but she looks pretty rough now, so didn't make a very credible Princess of Mars.  Maybe the dumb Martians like their princesses more mature and less attractive.  I never watched any of Ms. Lords XXX flicks as I much preferred Annette Haven, Seka, and Ginger Lynn of that same time period.  But I digress.

This flick borders on the terrible, although I enjoyed it more than the WATCHMAN which was absolutely horrible and insanely boring.  I made the mistake of confusing this John Carter with the latest version of this movie and thought I got a good deal.

In the big budget movie, John Carter is a reluctant fighter, while in this movie and in the book, he is not. It wasn't the minimal budget and short shooting schedule that wrecked this movie, it was bizarre decisions they producer and director made. The attempt to modernize the beginning of the story where ridiculous, I'm sure many people turned it off right there. I admit to leaning toward the purist side, but that's not what this is about. Their modernization was just awful. If that were simply cut out, the move would be a lot better. The other bizarre thing is that they decided to disgust the audience with the food and drink John Carter is given. It is not disgusting at all in the book, they consume a plant which is something like a cactus. Why they made this choice is beyond me.

These are the millstones which sunk this movie. The acting could have been better, they could have cast a more convincing Dejah Thoris, but these are minor. Without the terrible choices at the beginning, this would have been a decent movie.",1341187200,,1128,4.5024390243902435

The makeups are incredibly bad with no attempt to make the masks fit around the eye or let the actors speak without sounding gagged. Deja Thoris looks nothing like the ""vision of beauty"" described by Burroughs. And the CGI effects are extraordinarly cheap and poorly done in every scene that needs them.

5090992,2,B007JE3JQW,"Okay, just a bit of history(which you can skip if you've read the book) for you here.  Many moons ago(1912 to be exact), Edgar Rice Burroughs unleashed his book, Princess of Mars.  It's about a civil war soldier named John Carter who get whisked away to Mars, where he meets different martian races, goes on numerous adventures, and basically goes from being a mysterious stranger to the savior of the planet.  He also wins the hand of the beautiful princess, Dejah Thoris.
The book is a kind of mix between sword and sandal fantasy and science fiction.  In fact, the He-Man cartoon comes close to the kind of Mars that Burroughs created.  The influence of the book can be seen in alot of Sci-Fi since.  Hell, I'm sure George Lucas read these books, as I can see some of it in Star Wars.
It's a short book, but very epic.  Lots happens.  So making a film is a very ambitious task.  As of this review we have about a month before Disney unleashes their big budgeted adaptation called John Carter(from what I've seen I'm not impressed, but that's for another review).
But here we have a microbudgeted adaptation from Asylum.  Only the skeleton plot of Burroughs story remains(and even that is altered) with John Carter, Dejah Thoris, and warrior Tars Tarkas on a quest to protect the planet's air purifying plant from sabotage(Total Recall, anyone?).  That's where all similarities end.
John Carter is now some Rambo-esque military guy fighting opium lords in an Arab country.  He's shot and left for dead when he's taken before military doctors who try out an experimental procedure on him.  ""Experimental"" means you don't really have to explain it in too much detail, because it doesn't seem to make much sense.  A small cartridge is able to rebuild Carter atom for atom, and......oh, by the way, you're going to Mars to see if any life exists there.  Not the actual Mars either, but a kind of Mars 2 in another solar system.  Okay, I guess I'll play along.
Once upon Mars That Isn't Really Mars, Carter teams up with a race called the Tharks.  Burroughs' Tharks are ten foot, green lizard-like beings with four arms.  Here they are actors in masks that look like a clumsy hybrid of the Dracs from Enemy Mine and the Predator.  Carter earns their respect by engaging in a Starship Troopers(on a budget of course) type battle with big bugs.  The Tharks capture Dejah Thoris, but Carter is smitten with her(understandable because it's Traci Lords), and he manages to form an alliance between the two enemy races.  So, the Tharks' greatest warrior, Tars Tarkas, Carter and Dejah Thoris embark to save the planet's air supply(not the band, but the actual air supply).
This film is an abomination of the novel on which it's based.  Taking ""artistic license"" is putting it lightly.  Taking on a story this epic on a tiny budget is doomed anyway, it makes you wonder why it would even be attempted.  The opium dealing Arab even shows up to become the central villain hellbent on taking over the planet!!
Antonio Sabato has the look of a John Carter and would probably do a decent job in a decent version.  Here he is very much a 21st century guy, cracking jokes and more or less just being a typical action movie lug.  Traci Lords may be too old for this part, but I'm a bit biased here as I think she looks awesome for her age.  She can be my Dejah Thoris any day.  Plus, her look is totally wrong from the Dejah Thoris described in the books.
This movie plays out like one of those made for Syfy films, maybe even a step below.  If you take it as that and not as a true John Carter film, it is kinda fun if you like this kind of hokeyness.  Hardcore Burroughs devotees, stay the hell away!",1328400000,4,3684,4.546282245827011

It was a laughable prosthetic application  You don't need to be a doctor to know that if this guy were ever hit in the face, his tusks would fall off or be useless, broken and hanging off his face.  Just bumping into something would break them the way they were bouncing around.  Teeth and tusks are anchored in the jaw.  check your own mouth!

Some of the character names are the same, but there is only a passing notion of the story from the Edgar Rice Burroughs classic. The green martians don't have four arms, and their mounts are some sort of really slow dinosaur camels. John Carter actually looks more red than the red martians. LOL It would have been a saving grace if Traci Lords had shown more skin, but alas, no. Unfortunately, she brings none of the charm to the role that you would hope to see in Dejah Thoris.

Matt Lasky, who played Tars Tarkas, is one of my favorite new actors! I have seen him in other things and can tell you that he is a first class actor who can handle drama and comedy with noteworthy authority. I got such a kick out of the character when I first saw the film that i google-stalked him!

The Tars Tarkas character was a joke. The Dejah Thoris character is a blonde. John Carter is some sort of special opps soldier. Give me a break here. Antonio Sabato and Traci Lords seem to try hard, but it just didn't work.

The script had Sabato acting nothing like John Carter. In the books, he didn't put up with too much of any kind of crap.

As for Lords: I think she is still a good looking woman after all these years, but she is NOT Dajah Thoris. I do wish she had smiled at least a couple times in this film. She has the body for a princess, but she is too old and BLONDE! Jeez.

There are way too many inconsistencies in this movie to put in a review. It would take all night. Some of the main characters are portrayed so wrong that I had to back the movie up several times because I missed part of it from cussing.

5091006,4,B007JE3JQW,"This Sci-fi film entertained me. It is not great, but I watched it once on a late night with insomnia, and it looked ""otherworldly"" beautiful from start to finish. (Perhaps the late night and the insomnia may have added something to the viewing experience.) Even when it looked hokey and cheap, it worked. There was something about the light, the atmosphere and the mood of it that worked for me. All of it just ""looked"" right.

On the plus side, Sabato is a believable hero as John Carter. I liked him as Carter. This is not high acting, but he portrayed an athletic guy with a hero-mindset. He worked in the context of the film, as did most of the rest of the cast. Don't expect acting like in ""The Departed"" or something like that. This is a science fiction B-movie on a low budget. Again, I have to emphasize that the whole thing looked good, even when it looked cheap.

Here's where it was fun but could have been improved: Carter going to Mars, and not even our next door neighbor Mars, but to a different Mars in a different solar system, left him with super strength in the very light gravity. Apparently this ""other Mars"" is even smaller than the one we know, with incredibly light gravity, given the strength he had. The 200 foot jumps he made could have been played up more. They looked good. The couple times when Carter took an adversary as large or larger than him and threw him 50 feet at high velocity into the side of a rock wall was very impressive, and should have been done many more times. They needed to play that up more. The sword fight at the end was rather weak, but the lack of skill of the actors was hidden by camera flash cuts and changing camera angles. It did not ruin the story, but it could have been done better.

Here's where the movie kind of failed: I hate to criticize a beautiful woman (I adore them!), but Traci Lords was miscast. She did not seem to be an exotic alien princess. What is worse, she still has a great body, and didn't take off her clothes. (That's probably my biggest gripe. Go with your strengths, Traci.) In casting, I think they could have had a more convincing princess just getting some hot girl off the street in Brazil or Colombia and giving her a couple hundred bucks a week to look gorgeous and say a few lines. Traci had a bunch of close-ups that should have shown a princess's horror and dismay, and instead gave us the look of a soccer mom having a really bad day. (Don't get me wrong, she's a soccer mom with a great body, but she just didn't nail this.)

Liberties were taken in regard to the script to update the book. Most of the update was OK, but when they went to the trouble to say the wounded soldier Carter, on Earth, at the beginning of the movie, would have ""all his atoms"" downloaded to a 16 gig memory stick to transport him to Mars, they lost me for a while. They tried to explain something beyond our tech that they should have left alone. If they said they would just download his consciousness and project that through a man-made, microscopic Einstein-Rosen bridge that opened for a fraction of a second in a supercollider as an anti-matter conversion byproduct, and sent just the consciousness to another dimension, I'd have bought that. The whole ""every atom"" thing with the 16 gig stick just made me shake my head. If you are going to stretch credibility and jump the shark, make it Jaws. Don't hold up a 16 gig stick.

My favorite part is early in the movie when John Carter first encounters the Tharks.  The director tries to use camera angles to suggest the Tharks are much taller than John Carter but within a few shots just says ""the hell with it"" and makes them the same size.  Traci Lords as Dejah Thoris is more like the ""Spinster of Mars"" as she seems too old for the role.  Plus, she always has this look on her face like she's really cheesed about something (maybe the fact that she has to do Asylum movies to earn a living).  The Thark masks are horrible and not even in a good way.  Tars Tarkas (Matt Lasky) is also way over-dramatic in his line delivery.

That being said the similarities between this awful movie and the original story lie in a handful of names and that John Carter was from Virginia. The writing of this screen play either has no idea what the story is about, having been told about it by a not too good reader of the story, or he intentionally wanted to dicredit ERB for some reason. I have gone out and gotten books and read the original after seeing a movie I enjoyed, but based on watching this; if not knowing better, I would never have bought an Edgar Rice Burroughs book.

5091018,2,B007JE3JQW,"A filmed version of a novel should at least bring a smile to those who are familiar with the book.  In A PRINCESS OF MARS, director Mark Atkins takes far too many liberties with the novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs and turns a delightful adventure story into a cheesy tale replete with abysmal acting, scripting, and special effects.  Now there is nothing inherently wrong when a director may decide to alter the minor details and plotting of the book, but in this case, all that remains of the original are the names of the characters.  Antonio Sabato is John Carter, who in the novel was a cowboy murdered by Indians and in an inexplicable metaphysical manner was transported to Mars.  Here he is a soldier in Afghanistan who is ambushed by a traitor and has a computer chip inserted into his brain that teleports him to Mars. The problems with audience acceptance begin with his arrival.  Sabato comes across less as the adventurer that ERB saw than as a wisecracking musclehead who should not survive even one day on the Red Planet let alone become a Jeddack (chief) within a few short days. Very little makes sense from a logical point of view. The traitor from Afghanistan somehow is teleported to Mars as well where he decides that he can become the Earth Dictator of Barsoom (Mars).  Battles with Star War types beasties are ubiquitous with Carter using Earth type rifles to dispatch them by the dozen.  And then there is the appearance of ex porn star Traci Lords as Carter's romantic interest.  Lords was 42 when she took the role and it shows.  Her character Dejah Thoris in the book was young and hot. Here, Lords may still be hot but her wrinkles mark the onset of middle age. Pam Anderson as Barb Wire would have been a better choice.  What A PRINCESS OF MARS emerges as is a watered down version of a book that one will never read if one sees the film first.",1274572800,4,1870,4.5222551928783385

This smells like a movie length pilot for a TV show and a pretty colourless one at that.

I don't blame some film makers for shaky effects and doing it generally on the cheap. Some of the best Sci Fi movies have been done on a shoestring budget (eg the original Halloween, the original Thing from Another World, Quatermass 2 - Enemy from Space, or even the early TV episodes of the original Dr Who). I suspect this film had much more cash than any of those classics so what went wrong.

For one thing they bit off way too much more than they could chew in taking on Burrough's Barsoom classics. This should have been left to a Spielberg, Cameron, Lucas or Jackson who have the cash, CGI and savvy to bring such imagination to the screen. But then with a little more imagination they could have got away with at least a reasonable effort. But as indicated this is colourless entertainment, no better than an average TV episode of an average TV series.

Effectively its main problem is its lack in engendering any interest in the characters or any emotion about what is happening. Though the creature masks were quite good, and the creatures were probably the best actors, they were introduced in a HO HUM manner like its something that happens every day. The lead actor seemed bored and with all due respects to the princess's looks, she cant act and was quite irritating. If you have a theme like the book surely we should be getting a sense of mystery, fear, trepidation, expectation of an unexpected unknown, romance and just a general sense of foreboding. What we got was a pinch from 'Eight Legged Freaks', a pinch from Dark Crystal for transport, a bad guy who was as frightening as a cold soup, a couple of decent special effects ( the flying machines, Carter's leaping and the rather innocuous looking air maker). What astonished me was Carter's ability to leap 50 metres, to swing a creature at the end of his chain into a wall 50 metres away, and yet the creatures seemed able to push him around and keep him easily contained. Characters came and went and you weren't entirely sure what they were about.

I'm sorry but this one was boring and a wasted $20",1272672000,3,2314,4.818639798488665

5091021,1,B007JE3JQW,"...this movie would have killed him.

I rented this 'film' from Netflix, and didn't bother to check out who produced it beforehand.  When the DVD arrived and I took it out of the sleeve and saw ""The Asylum"" on the disc, I knew I was in for a crapfest.  I would wager every penny I own and ever will own that those guys just are simply not capable of making a real movie.  You know, with a coherent plot, decent acting, and at least semi-convincing special effects.  Nope, instead, The Asylum specializes in rip-offs of better-known box-office hits, such schlock-fests as 'I Am Omega' and 'Transmorphers'.  So yeah, as soon as I saw who made the film, my expectations were already non-existent.

After actually watching the movie (against my better judgement, but hey, I'm a glutton for punishment), my opinion hasn't changed one bit.  In the 'making of' featurette, the director makes a big deal of how they did this film in only TWELVE DAYS!!!!1!!  Uh, hate to break it to you dude, but maybe that's not something you should be proud of.  Just because something is possible doesn't mean it's the best thing to do.  I mean, I could run out into traffic instead of taking a couple of minutes more to cross at a crosswalk and maybe save myself a minute or two, but I could also get hit by a car.

And this movie IS a car-wreck.  The story is a barely-coherent 'adaption' of the source material.  It was a nice idea to update John Carter's back-story to the present day and make it more relevant to today's viewers, but the way it was done was laughably stupid.  Without giving away anything (for those masochistic enough to subject themselves to watching it), the method by which Carter was sent to 'Mars' was never explained with any degree of sense.  Once on 'Mars', many of the 'Martians' called their planet Mars, while some stuck with Barsoom.  In the original book, it made a certain amount of sense that maybe, just maybe, some of the natives would call their planet by the Earth-name, since Earth and Mars are neighbors after all, but here?  This 'Mars' isn't even in the same freaking solar system!  Why would the inhabitants even know what that word means?  I just can't go on pointing out plot holes, but that should give you some idea.

As for the casting and acting... bleh.  Antonio Sabato made a passable John Carter, but with that type of character one expects a bit of stoic woodenness, so it made sense to cast him or someone like him.  But Traci Lords as Deja Thoris?  Come on now - what's that all about?  She's a pretty lady, but she's not the Princess of Mars.  Not to mention she can't act her way out of a paper bag.

The special effects are the usual Asylum hurry-up-and-get-it-done garbage.  The fight with the spiders early in the film was fairly well-done as long as you don't look too closely, but as for the rest of it... bleh again.

I just don't understand production companies like The Asylum.  Did they all actually come from an asylum?  Don't they have any pride in their work, any interest in making a halfway decent movie?  I don't get it.  At any rate, it reinforced my decision never to watch another one of their movies, and taught me to do some research on IMDB before adding something to my Netflix queue.  :D",1269129600,31,3249,4.516295025728988

Having seen more of their productions than I would care to admit, I am giving Princess of Mars a healthy three star rating as it felt like an actual story was being told. It may be only loosely based on Burroughs' classic pulp series, but I felt that the movie was moving ahead and had an actual script and plot. The special effects are of course on the cheap side, but not as bad as they could be. The masks the Barsoomians wear aren't really any worse than you would see on any Star Trek TV episode. The acting? Well, it's not great but serviceable. With their efforts on Sherlock Holmes, the Asylum has put together a couple features in a row that rival the SyFy channel's home-brew movies of the week. That may not sound like much of a compliment but if you have ever seen their efforts on Universal Soldiers or Alien Vs Hunter you know what I am talking about.

However if you over look the hokey background music  (that sounds like a Hallmark movie), the missing Woola, the stilted dialog, the phony flying scenes (shades of Hidden Tiger) and the logic that you could drive a tank through, this is a watchable film.

Fort the reader or the non-reader alike, the story has changed a tad. John Carter (Antonio Sabato Jr.) of Virginia is now an U.S. sniper in Afghanistan.  He is betrayed by a dastardly trick from an insidious drug dealer. The only way to save his life is to use a physics trick to create a John copy on a distant planet that just happens to also have the name ""Mars"" (no Barsoom here).  He meets Tharks that are not green, a prince, Dejah Thoris (a 41-year-old Traci Lords) is not red, and an enemy that is not of that world. We still get swordplay and leaps of faith.
