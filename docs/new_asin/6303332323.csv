7843775,5,6303332323,"This episode has to be my absolute favorite episode in the series. It starts out with Zealot and Warblade training in a combat room similar to the X-Men's Danger Room. During the fight Zealot is trying to explain what Warblade needs to concentrate on while battling, but to Warblade it just comes across as arrogant taunting. Soon after Jacob Marlow calls the Wildcats together to find out why there have been a series of unnatural earthquakes in the war-torn country of Yugovia. Void teleports the team to Yugovia, but upon arrival the Wildcats are caught in the middle of a battle between two armies. During the battle a Coda warrior (a form of Amazon warrior who can live for centuries) named Artemis attacks Spartan but soon gets lost among the barrage of bombs. Later, while regrouping, Zealot tells Grifter that she must track down the rogue Coda. So while the Wildcats discover the reason behind the earthquakes, Zealot finds herself in the middle of a Coda conspiracy to aid the evil Daemonites.

This episode is based off of the ""Wildcats Trilogy"" storyline in the Wildcats comic book. I love this episode because it highlights my favorite character, Zealot, and shows her history as a former leader of the Coda and their origin. Not only is there a lot of action, but there is lots of character development also. Though Zealot is typically the more hard-edged personality in the series, by the end of this episode you discover that she really does have a heart and that relying on your friends is a very good lesson to learn. This video is good for all ages and reminds you of just how fun comic book based cartoons can really be.",1096416000,,1640,4.694444444444445
