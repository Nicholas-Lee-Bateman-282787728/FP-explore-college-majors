7951797,5,B00005R267,"Battles of the Civil War - is the DVD version of all of the Classic Images films Jack Foley made during the 125th Anniversary years of the American Civil War. They have been re-released in three volumes covering the whole war.
During a five year period in the 1980's large reenactments of the Civil War were taking place on or near all of the major battlefields. At the time Jack Foley was there with his film crews.  He put together excellent documentaries at the time using the thousands of reenactors that showed up from all over the world. The films for the most part were well paced and well written with Mr. Foley as the narrator. Needless to say reenactors past and present will find total enjoyment in these and teachers should find them and very useful as a teaching tool.
Nice to see that they have been released in DVD.",1219190400,3,830,4.496688741721854
