8558760,2,B00AX77FTE,"In ordering this DVD, I had hoped for more prolonged views of the iconic landmarks.  From a distance (no telephoto lens), you do get a several second view of the lighted Eiffel Tower, but there was only a fleeting view of the facade of Notre Dame.
I had hoped for a prolonged glide past ND, flying buttresses and all.  Technically, the DVD delivers everything promised in the description, but, to me, it was just like watching someone's amateurish home movies.",1399248000,,460,4.7375
8558761,5,B00AX77FTE,"This is a great DVD.  Viewing it felt like a recreation of the same cruise that I took in Paris.  The photography is excellent and shows memorable views of Paris from the Seine, both day and night views.  The night views are particularly memorable.",1398556800,,248,4.590909090909091
