5990603,5,B00FFLFISS,"Has got to be one of the funniest shows I have ever seen, if not THE FUNNIEST.  I believe he outdid Robin Williams, which I thought was impossible!!!!!!!!!!",1309824000,3,156,4.571428571428571
8615344,1,B00FFLFISS,This is a complaint about the company and the quality they are selling. Not about the content of the dvd. But the cheap quality.  Its as if someone recorded with their phone while playing the actual dvd on their tv. Its worse than a bootleg.,1513900800,,241,4.355555555555555
8615345,4,B00FFLFISS,"It was written on with metallic marker, but it was used so you don't really know what to expect. Anyways it still works fine.",1485820800,,125,4.25
8615346,3,B00FFLFISS,"As another person noted, the picture quality is terrible. Especially at the beginning of the show the images blur or jump to a point where you wonder if it could cause seizures. It didn't seem as bad later but I'd rather show friends an old edited, shortened tv version of the show than the annoying, hard on the eyes video that I'd bought.",1474588800,2,340,4.412698412698413
8615347,5,B00FFLFISS,"Probably one of Christopher Titus' BEST routines EVER.
In response to others reviews as to the quality of the video, let me just say, y'all need to lay off the crack. The freeze frame pixelates a bit, but I watched it on a 1081 resolution TV, and it looks GREAT. Sound and video quality are good, and the comedy is BEYOND amazing. Laughed myself stupid multiple times!",1471651200,,368,4.507462686567164
8615348,5,B00FFLFISS,Hysterical!  This man is a comedic genius.,1437350400,,42,5.0
8615349,5,B00FFLFISS,"Such restraint not killing the kid at the post office!!!  If you don't know what I'm talking about, you need to get this!!",1436400000,,122,4.304347826086956
8615350,5,B00FFLFISS,"The man is whack.  Love his humor, take on society.",1434931200,,51,4.1
8615351,5,B00FFLFISS,"Always have, always will love Mr. Titus' humor.",1433548800,,47,5.0
8615352,5,B00FFLFISS,Absolutely love this - I put it on for friends and our stomachs hurt from laughing so hard because it's the truth - he just has such a bluntly funny way of putting it!,1404604800,,167,3.9411764705882355
8615353,2,B00FFLFISS,"I'm a long-time fan of Christopher Titus. I already have all three seasons of his TV show and the first two specials, so I decided to get the other two. This show is bitingly hilarious, but it looks like it was filmed on a cell phone. From 2002. My equipment tried to upscale it and it leaves gaping lines of resolution. So I set the equipment to play at the original resolution, which is only 480i. And it's compressed so badly, every time Titus moves- and he does at great length- a motion blur just smears him across the screen. This show takes up less than half of the space on the disc and it really shows. If you do get this DVD, do yourself a favor and rip the audio to an mp3 and save yourself that 105 minute migraine.",1389744000,,727,4.163120567375887
