6402953,5,B00K5KO8YE,"Ask anybody about urban legends or myths that were circulated when they were in high school, and Ill bet you get an interesting variety of answers.  I can think of at least three that went around when I was in junior high.  I even remember going to parties where one or two people always wanted to turn out the lights, shine a flashlight into a mirror, and try to summon the ghost of a girl who died years ago.  Stories like these abound, but thats all they are:  just stories.  Right?

Wrong.  This is the premise behind Anchor Bays latest horror release, THE MIDNIGHT GAME.  In this film, an urban legend comes to life with horrifying consequences, and the result is a wildly entertaining flick that will have you begging for daylight.

A few months ago, I reviewed another film from director A. D. Calvo titled HOUSE OF DUST.  It was very good, and I enjoyed ithowever, Calvo topped it and then some with THE MIDNIGHT GAME.  This film is genuinely scary and does not rely on cheap gimmicks or shock value.  If you watch this film (and I highly recommend that you do), be ready to jump and bite your fingernails; it is that good!

This film is shot well and looks great onscreen.  The opening credits sequence is haunting and very effective for setting the dark tone of the film.  Likewise, the musical score is superb and creates a chilling atmosphere for the horror to unfold.

The acting in THE MIDNIGHT GAME is very good as well.  The whole cast does a great job in their roles, however I have to point out Renee Olstead specifically; she gives the most believable performance for me, and I look forward to seeing more of her work in the future.

There are not many special effects to speak of in this film, however there are some great makeup effects used.  I won't go into detail because I don't want to give anything away, but they are certainly original and look great.  You definitely need to watch the film to appreciate the talent.

THE MIDNIGHT GAME is a definite win for me, and I highly recommend it to horror fans everywhere.  The plot may be a simplistic concept, but this film will scare the hell out of you.  It hits store shelves next week, so make a note to give it a look for sure.",1407369600,,2204,4.41439205955335
6402954,4,B00K5KO8YE,"I was hesitant since you can only buy it and I've been disappointed more often than not lately with what's available. Since there was nothing else that appealed to me and it had 1 positive review by an independent person (not attached to the film in any way), I gave it a shot.

Surprise, surprise! I haven't seen a horror film like this in a long time. I can't remember when, actually. I'm not sure who made the film (I will be googling that next) but it had a real retro vibe and retro quality.  Its shot well, good camera work, the acting is competent, and the story is complete, not just an idea stretched out to fill a movie's running time. Now for one of the most impressive parts: while the characters are young people (unsure if they were supposed to be high school seniors or college students- though they looked more like the latter), the story, the dialogue, and how they acted was NOT juvenile and/or annoyiing. The tone of the film was also not jokey, tongue in cheeky, or meta-anything. It was a straight up horror flick of a supernatural bent. Given the midnight game itself is stuff of an urban legend (as presented in the movie, never heard of it before in the real world), you know how silly those types of flicks can be. Looking at where the urban legend subgenre has gone, its hard to believe that they are the offspring of something like ""Candyman"", the godfather of the genre. (Some things don't get better with age.) Now ""The Midnight Game"" is a worthy descendant of ""Candyman""- though the actual story and the pace is totally different. I'm talking about the quality only.

The protagonists are believable, they seem genuine, and they generate chemistry. They feel like actual friends, which builds the atmosphere and allows for suspension of disbelief for the supernatural plot line. Quite different than most films, the antagonist is mostly suggested, implied, shadows vs. form (though there is a form a couple of times and I totally dug it!). A very brave choice and that it worked so well is really a testament to the talent of all involved in this movie. Kudos! I would much rather have this scenario than a CGI or cheaply constructed antagonist that renders the entire movie unbelievable and a farce. The horror visuals, aka ""effects"" are also handled quite well. The soundtrack complements the film very well.

The setting was effective: a beautiful house in a woodsy area, somewhat isolated. The shots of the woods were very nicely done. I really appreciated the camerawork, which was totally competent and had actual artistic aesthetic (an organic aesthetic that fit the story and tone; nothing that takes you out of the movie, but if you pay attention to how scenes are shot, you will notice what I mean).

The story is simple: play this game, some spooky stuff will happen, but its easy to protect yourself, and nothing that bad will happen, so no biggie, right? Right?  The movie then unfolds and the timeline has a surprising effect (literally). It caught me off guard a few times when my expectations of what would come next were wrong. That's awesome! The pace is not hectic or action filled but that's fine, as it suits the atmospheric tone of growing creep and dread. Honestly, I much prefer that, especially in current times, when movies seem to have lost the art of the atmospheric horror flick in favor of the easy shocks scenarios. That being said, its not a slow paced, full on slow burn, type of flick either. Events occur consistently enough to maintain interest, attention but at a pace that actually builds anticipation for what is going to come next. I'd say this film was heavier in the anticipation department, therefore on the suspense side of things, than in tension, though there was definitely enough of the latter to justify its ""horrorific"" self. Tension, suspense, and fear are totally subjective anyway, so it may affect you differently. Toward the climax, the events become quite nasty (in tone; not talking gore here) and I was surprised by how unsympathetic it was, as compared to the average film of this type you see nowadays. That is a huge compliment. I love unsympathetic films.

The only criticism I have is that 1 of the characters, Emma- Shane's girlfriend- kinda could've been portrayed more interestingly, more atmospherically, than she was. At least, I thought so. The other characters were spot on, with Shane being my favorite.

Anyway, I hate to inflate expectations but these are my honest thoughts. Take them for what you will. I consider this more of a good horror movie than an 'entertaining' one. Not that they are mutually exclusive. Its just that the former includes the latter but not vc. vs. You are always best off keeping your expectations in check- none or low are always best. After all, taste is subjective so you may well feel differently about it. Even if you agree its good, your reasons for why that is may be different than mine. Enjoy the ride!",1407196800,13,4942,4.725058004640371
6402955,5,B00K5KO8YE,"I really enjoyed this film. It's quiet impressive and teased your own imagination of fearful thoughts, which is what makes it intriguingly frightful to the viewer. I thought there should have been one more character whose fear was to be alone because it's most peoples fear and would have been so easily horrifying. I must also applaud the cast for portraying the characters in such a way that made them relatable and natural. Their reactions throughout the movie were intense and real. This film may start out slow for some, but shortly will grasp your attention.",1407196800,5,564,4.885416666666667

I have seen every horror movie you can name, and this one I have to say left me a little scared afterwards, and that normally doesn't happen when I watch a horror movie. I wouldn't watch it if your religious though, front page says it all. A bunch of teenagers decide to play a scary satanic game, and it doesn't turn out the way they planned it.

6402967,2,B00K5KO8YE,"This film centers around some teenagers who decide to get together while mom's away.  Once everyone is there, ""fearless leader"" convinces them all to play the ""Midnight Game,"" which basically involves candles, a drop of blood, LOTS of knocking, and dire consequences.  The rules to the game are laughable.  It seems they all survive the FIRST round of the game, although one of the teens swears ""everything is off.""  So, as we do at Montessori School, we have a do-over, and that goes worse than the first time.  I will never understand why, if you feel something is wrong, you don't just leave from wherever it is you are.  Instead, you want to tempt fate as many times as you can all the while knowing your outcome won't be a desireable one.

This movie had good intentions; most of this type of genre do.  However, it is plainly clear to anyone with one functioning brain cell, the writer, director, producer--whomever--ran out of ideas.  The movie sorta' ends (and it would have been much better had it ended when you thought it was going to), but then the viewer is thrown a curveball (really, more of a sinker) and then it ends.  Nothing is explained, although if you pay real good attention at the beginning of the movie, you'll be waaaay ahead of its participants.

Unrated for violence (I guess), and obviously an unfinished product.  Not recommended.",1415318400,,1360,4.716101694915254

6402980,3,B00K5KO8YE,"Things have certainly changed for the horror genre. Where once it horror films were few and far between it now seems like there are several being released each week. Fortunately most of those are straight to DVD because they honestly aren't that great, but at least their trying. When I saw the cover for THE MIDNIGHT GAME I felt for sure that I was in store for another low budget devil worshipping/cult film that would deliver no chills and little horror. I can tell you now that while it had a number of stereotypical items in the plot, it was actually a decent movie.

The film centers around a group of teenagers (don't they all) who get together at one girls house when her mother goes away for the weekend. Apparently one parent households create a revolving door for parties. At least according to horror films. Strangely enough it's an odd combo with one couple, another pair trying to possibly start dating and the girl whose home the party takes place at.

As the beer runs down and the night runs long the group decides to play a game, one that the jock boyfriend saw online earlier that day in the library. I'm not sure if it was a good or bad thing but the amount of things involved with this game seemed lengthy to me. Suffice to say that you must take the game seriously or bad things will happen. Predictably the group doesn't take it as seriously as they should and danger then lurks all around.

The game involved each one talking about the things they feared most and as the night progresses each of those playing finds themselves confronted by that very fear. A fear of heights, a fear of madness and more brings the teens to the edge of terror. Perhaps it was because I'd just finished watching another horror film that had some of the worst acting possible but those involved here did a great job of being convincing in their roles.

What made the movie work well on top of the performances though was the evil creature that's rarely seen in the film and the story that takes you where you least expect it to by the end. The use of the creature here works well because it is indeed visible from time to time but it's never overused as some horror films have done in the past. As for the direction of the story before the end credits I don't intend to spoil that here. You'll have to rent or buy the movie to find that out.

In the end I can tell you that the movie is indeed worth renting. If you're a horror fan then chances are you'll enjoy this one. Keep in mind the budget they had to work with here and don't expect the money found in the EVIL DEAD remake. You'll be pleasantly surprised. As a matter of fact horror fans might even want to add this one to their collection. It delivers the goods.",1410393600,,2724,4.3648915187376724
6402981,4,B00K5KO8YE,"Spooky little movie rarely seen nowadays. I rented this on a whim. The setting is a nice old style wooden house. That's it, the whole movies takes place in the house, minus a small scene in the woods. I felt all the actors were decent. Especially loved the goth girl! A slight variation of a Ouija board type movie. There are only 6 characters in the movie, and one of those is seen briefly. The game the kids play is actually kind of neat and I felt the suspense was cool because it's never explained who is haunting them or why. And honestly, we didn't need an explanation. It's kind of cool to not know who  is doing the mysterious stuff. I highly recommend this one.",1410393600,4,670,4.317460317460317

In any case, no regrets consuming this one on Halloween.",1446336000,,389,4.571428571428571
