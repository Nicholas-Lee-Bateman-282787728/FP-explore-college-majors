5562396,5,B00B81NQ88,This was a great show. It started off a little slow but picked up quickly. I was glad to see how well orchestra music and the stooges music worked together it just shows theirs still room to grow in music.,1377734400,4,205,4.15
5562397,5,B00B81NQ88,A truly amazing concert experience. Great music all around. Outstanding performances and much Intensity and emotion on this disc. Plus the proceeds I believe go to a good cause. All in all well done.,1375747200,4,199,4.882352941176471
5562398,5,B00B81NQ88,"Stooges rock the sold-out Michigan Theater in their home town Ann Arbor in a killer tribute to the late Ron Asheton. There are moving testimonials by Rons brother Scott and Henry Rollins. Iggy and the band rip through their Raw Power based set, with some surprises from Kill City and others. Deniz Tek from Radio Birdman takes over on guitar for a short set from the first two albums. There is backing and interludes by a small orchestra. For Stooge fans everywhere, this is an unusual and unique one-off event, not to be missed. James Williamson returns and Steve Mackay joins in a rave-up for the last tune, No Fun.

Sound quality and visuals are excellent, and the performances are great.",1374537600,6,691,4.710743801652892
5562399,5,B00B81NQ88,"Ron was an idol of mine since I heard his bass when Raw Power then I went back and listened to the first two stooges albums and all the other Stooges music music Ron played on and then the stuff after they broke up, Ron is dead, long live Ron.",1374364800,4,243,3.88
8563777,5,B00B81NQ88,What can I say Iggy and the Stooges especially around Ashton the greatest band in the world,1505088000,,91,4.411764705882353

8563780,5,B00B81NQ88,So thankful for the music over the decades and that I was able to see the Weirdness tour. A very sad day when Ron Asheton left us - this concert is a beautiful tribute to his genius great lineup (from both a historical and talent perspective).,1420934400,2,243,4.304347826086956

8563783,5,B00B81NQ88,"FANTASTIC SHOW!!!!! I tried to buy ""fan club"" tickets the day before they went on sale to the public but got none.  I tried again the next day and they all sold out within an hour and I got none.  I finally went on line to buy from a scalper and had a choice of two tix in the back row of the balcony for $750 or two in the front row for $1265 dollars.  I decided to go all-in and spent the $1265 dollars.  The seats were front row dead center.  Today, I have NO REGRETS for spending that much.  The show was one of the best Stooges concerts I've ever seen following behind New Year's Eve 1969 show at the Grande Ballroom, The Cincinnati Pop concert in 1970 and the Reunion concert at DTE Music Theater in 2003.  To be honest I saw them so many times from 1968 through the early 70's that I can't be sure if there were others equal to New Year's Eve 1969 but the ""Owsley"" made that one stand out, never to be forgotten.  The Ron Asheton Tribute show was one I had to go to in order to say goodbye to Ron.  You will not be sorry if you get this DVD. I've purchased four of them so far; three to pass out to friends including my daughter. As an aside, watch when Iggy first hits the stage; he prances around and then grabs the mic and spits.  I warned my daughter that we and a few others with the best seats would get spat on as soon as he grabbed the mic.  A part of the act, I told her and when i happened my daughter looked at me like I was a wise old sage.  At least she new what was coming.  BTW, the only group I ever saw that was even close to being as good as the Stooges was the MC5.  Their best show(s) occurred when they recorded their first album at the Grande Ballroom,",1414540800,3,1681,3.93491124260355

8563785,5,B00B81NQ88,"I admit I eagerly awaited this release because I was at this show, and it didn't disappoint.  How the Stooges could end up with a symphony orchestra behind them (for a few tracks) and make it work, I'll never know, but they did it without losing or compromising one iota.  A masterpiece as well as a memorial.",1389052800,5,309,4.4035087719298245
8563786,5,B00B81NQ88,"I no longer live in Ann Arbor, and so I couldn't attend this show. This DVD is incredible. It makes me feel the pain of missing this show in person even more than I already do! It's that good! Jim Jarmusch did a great job of capturing the passion and the energy that every person in that building felt that night.

This is a must-own for Stooges fans. It's a fitting tribute for Ron. Crank up the volume!",1381536000,3,404,4.17948717948718
