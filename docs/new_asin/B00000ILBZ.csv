8119891,4,B00000ILBZ,"As if this series didn't take itself seriously before now, it only gets  worse in this volume. For example, during the first episode on this tape,  they make comments about 'being in fantasy anime' and cliches that are  expected in such (which, of course, show up in the episode). Also, at the  beginning of the second episode on this tape, Junpei makes a comment along  the lines of 'it's only 30 seconds since the episode title, and we've  already found an elf'.
So, basically, goofball anime just gets even  goofier. It's an absolute riot - if you like that kind of show. If you're  expecting Grave of the Fireflies or serious plot and character development,  stay far away from this series.
My only problem is that ADV is releasing  only two episodes per tape! Considering that the subtitled release tapes  cost $25-$30, it's almost not worth the money.",961372800,,857,4.722972972972973
