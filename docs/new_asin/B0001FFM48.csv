8011653,5,B0001FFM48,"After working together on the ARMS tour Bad Company's Paul Rogers and Led Zep's Jimmy Page decided to form a ""1/2 supergroup"" with 2 relatively unknown musicians - drummer Chris Slade (who would go on to David Gilmour's solo band and AC/DC) and fretless bass wonder Tony Franklin (too many to name).

They started out pretty strong, releasing 2 CDs, some videos with lots of MTV airplay, touring the world.....and then breaking up! Too bad too, because the 2nd CD, Mean Musiness was better than the debut; which made me look forward to a 3rd release.

So, in addition to the 2 CDs we are left with these 5 videos:

Satifaction Guaranteed and Radioactive (the biggest ""hit"") from the debut, and

Tear Down the Walls, All the King's Horses and Live in Peace from Mean Business.

If you are a fan of either Bad company or Led Zep (or really any good 70s/early 80s rock) you've probably already heard these. All the King's Horses in particular is good and, in my opinion, Live in Peace is a masterpiece that ranks up there in the top tier of these 2 legends combined bodies of work.

The videos look good and the stereo hi-fi sounds good, at least as good as the CD tracks, but this is what it is....a 25-year old VHS tape. And probably won't live up to the expectations of younger listeners spoiled by DTS HD BluRay sound.

But I love it any way, so much so that I captured and burned it to a DVD+R myself. And even then, I'd still pay for a good, professionally released, DVD mixed into surround sound!

Who knows, I have seen several other 80s era VHS ""EPs"" released as DVDs, maybe we'll see this eventually.",1362614400,,1607,4.460750853242321
