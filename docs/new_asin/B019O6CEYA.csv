7578518,3,B019O6CEYA,"What's to say about ""Cannonball Run II""? Anyone who saw the original will have a good handle on every single thing that's going to happen onscreen, but that's OK: the movie is cheesy fun and has loads of stars doing ridiculous things. Even when the movie falls flat (which is not infrequently), the film is fun to laugh at. From the opening the film has all the obvious hallmarks of a Hal Needham film (he even gets a cameo as a driver) with insane casting, predictable lowbrow comedy, and lots of fast cars and stunt driving. If this is what you're looking for, the movie delivers all that in droves; if you want a sophisticated or intellectual comedy, perhaps looking elsewhere would be a good call. I will highlight only the truly outstanding moments here, and must mention that this DVD, while bargain priced, is a bare-bones presentation of middling quality.

The film opens with King Ricardo Montalban chiding his son, Jamie Farr for not winning the Cannonball Run. To right this wrong they use their money to put on another Cannonball Run, and the characters come out of the woodwork to get the $1,000,000 prize. Burt Reynolds is the ostensible star of stars here as a man who will not only drive in the race and impersonate an Army General, but will also willingly get into a bomb being released from a plane (flown by daredevil pilot Arte Johnson) at an exhibition. There's also a mob subplot and lots of pinched dialogue (""I could have been a contender."")

The mob piece is my favorite part of the film, with stalwarts like Frank Sinatra (as ""Frank""), Abe Vigoda (as ""Caesar""), and Telly Savalas in an unreal sport coat as the ultimately tough with a hilarious name up against the owner of ""The Pinto Ranch"", Don Don Cannelloni. In the ultimate masterstroke of casting, Don Don is played by none other than Charles Nelson Reilly. Absolutely stunning. Telly's tough guy antics are pricelessly hilarious, while on the other end of the amusement spectrum, Dom DeLuise's ""Captain Chaos"" superhero alter ego is supremely tiresome and annoying. I love that Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr. (as Morris Fenderbaum) and Frank Sinatra all appeared here, and there are other pseudo-reunions too, like Don Knotts as a Deputy and George Lindsay reuniting with Jim Nabors as Private Homer Lyle.

Low points include Dean, Sammy, and Dom dancing in veils and performing to ""Stop in the Name of Love"" and possibly the dumbest showdown and rescue in history near the close of the film. The closing credits contain outtakes, which are occasionally funnier than the actual movie, though are often tedious. It's noteworthy that the theme song ""Cannonball"" was written and performed by Ray Stevens, adding an element of appropriate class to the proceedings. Normally I wouldn't list cast members, but there are so many stars on display here I think it's relevant to know what major talents you're in for. Though this list is not exhaustive (I lost track somewhere in the third act), in addition to the stars I have already mentioned the cast includes Marilu Henner, Shirley MacLaine, Susan Anton (in a very appealing jumpsuit), Catherine Bach (ditto on the jumpsuit), Foster Brooks, Sid Caesar, Louis Nye, a very young Jackie Chan, Tim Conway, Tony Danza, Jack Elam (in a very disturbing role as Doctor Nikolas Van Helsing), Richard Kiel (wedged into a tiny Mitsubishi), Henry Silva, Joe Theismann (really), Mel Tillis, Chris Lemmon, Doug McClure, Dub Taylor (he's good in anything), Manis the Orangutan, Cheech Marin, Avery Schreiber, and Bud Stout. There are more, but I only mentioned the more prominent ones or my fingers would be sore from all the typing.

If you want an over-the-top mid '80s star-studded slapstick comedy, this might be exactly what Dr. Van Helsing ordered.",1464393600,4,3766,4.888888888888889

7578522,1,B019O6CEYA,"This classic sequel to the original cannonball run film
has never had a proper release in widescreen format ever
Warner bros who owns the film obviously does not care about the film otherwise they would've released the film in
Widescreen format and would've Digitally remastered the picture quality at least
but wb have not bothered with it, that's why this film's one & only U.S. DVD version is in 1:33:1 full screen only
plus the picture quality is Grainy & Dirty which looks to me like a VHS transfer with Mono sound
Until now this year,
there's 3 versions of this film on dvd & blu-ray
1st is Swedish blu-ray Distributor Studio S entertainment
has released the film on blu-ray in new HD transfer in screen ratio 1:85:1 widescreen with 5.1 Dolby digital English
no extras of course except for the Theatrical trailer, this Swedish blu-ray is ALL REGIONS
just select English language on the main menu
2nd is DVD Distributor Umbrella have somewhere got the rights to the film
and reissued the film on DVD the DVD is ALL REGIONS NTSC in 1:71:1 ratio with Dolby digital 2.0 stereo mix
they're no extras ofcourse, but at least the picture quality is more sharper & clearer in a new 1:71:1 ratio
another Distributor from the U.K. has also released cannonball run II on blu-ray & dvd, mediumrare ent'
the listing is on amazon uk go check it out
the U.K. blu-ray is region B locked, the dvd Disc is region 2 locked so will you need all regions player
the picture quality is pretty Good but not excellent but the screen ratio has been widen to 1:85:1 widescreen & the sound mix is 2.0 stereo
no new extras tragically
 so either buy the Swedish blu-ray or the U.K. blu-ray which are both in 1:85:1 ratios
much wider ratios are the best, the Umbrella dvd is only 1:71:1 which i think is poor effort
the Swedish blu-ray has the 1:85:1 plus a 5.1 surround sound mix, so the Swedish blu-ray is probably the best option
the only problem is the Swedish blu-ray is very expensive at $31U.S., but worth the money for sure
1 star for this new Umbrella dvd version, 5 stars for the swedish blu-ray based on wider screen ratio & 5.1 sound quality",1454976000,4,2127,4.524675324675325

I will say that if you are sensitive to the current times, you might not want to watch this as the jokes are far from politically correct.",1524787200,,291,4.12280701754386
7578524,3,B019O6CEYA,I guess funnier when I was 10years old. Plus side  is that you can see old actors young... specially a young Barbara Bach and Mary Lou Henner and Susan Anton. Most of you guys probably don't even know one of those 3! Lol!!!,1520726400,,223,4.186046511627907

Sure it's hokey and stupid at times, but it is also full of stars from a generation past, fast paced, and, well the orangutan is downright awesome. It also has some great music. If you want oscar-worthy, just ignore it. But if you want to laugh at a constant rate and see an incredible pack of famous people, give this movie a chance.

7578535,5,B019O6CEYA,"Let me start by saying this is for the rental-I did not buy this. I love this movie!!. For a lot of reasons-the stars in it are unbelievable! Burt Reynolds, Frank Sinatra,Sammy Davis Junior, Dean Martin Shirley McClaine, Dom Deloise,Jackie Chan, Telly Savalas and my personal favorites Susan Anton and Catherine Bach( Daisy Duke )and it goes on and On!! This movie would never be made today-pretty sexist and definitely not politically correct. But if you look at it for a just a fun throwback movie it's really not a big deal. Just put that aside and watch it for what it is. Entertainment!!  And PS-Amazon prime! Get the original cannonball run! You can't rent it anywhere!",1504310400,,675,4.769230769230769

8745591,3,B019O6CEYA,"RELEASED IN 1983 and directed by Hal Needham, ""Cannonball Run II"" is a car chase comedy about a second Cannonball Run race from the West Coast to the East Coast. The teams include JJ & Victor (Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise), Blake and Fenderbaum (Dean Martin & Sammy Davis Jr.) with other teams involving Jackie Chan & Richard Kiel in a submersible Mitsubishi Starion and Mel Tillis & Tony Danza accompanied by an orangutan. There are at least a dozen other notable co-stars in various roles: Jamie Farr, Telly Savalas, Sid Caesar, Tim Conway, Foster Brooks, Ricardo Montalban , Charles Nelson Reilly, Don Knotts, etc.

This is a fun turn-off-your-brain flick with an incredible all-star cast thats worth the price of admission. Unfortunately, the script needed a rewrite with better jokes but the producers obviously didn't want to blow the money. As it is, too much of the humor falls flat, but Cannonball Run II is still leagues better than comparable junk like Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 (1983). And theres a worthwhile sequence where Dom does an amusing Brando impersonation.

Moreover, the movie scores good marks on the female front with Catherine Bach jaw-dropping in form-fitting blue spandex during the first half, teamed with her Amazonian-ish partner Susan Anton (whos no slouch in the beauty department). Bach's buttocks looks like it was sculptured by God Himself. In addition, theres Marilu Henner and Shirley MacLaine, who catch a ride with JJ & Victor, masquerading as nuns before revealing their real identities. Maclaine was 48 during shooting but still had a great figure.

THE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 48 minutes and was shot in Nevada (Las Vegas, Henderson), Arizona (Tucson, Bisbee) and California (Redondo Beach).
