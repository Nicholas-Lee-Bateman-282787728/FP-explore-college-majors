8046636,1,B0007CEX1S,"This DVD is much worse than her Labor Prep Volume 1. There was only one position in this that was good. She can't seem to focus while she talks and says things like "" the bulging thing"" instead of the ""baby crowning"". Besides being an obviously low budget dvd she has no good information and uses extrememely innappropriate and unintelligent word choices. She has no idea what she is talking about. Also the fact that she also said, ""when the doctor tells you to push"". A doctor should not tell you to push a woman will know when it is time. Besides I assume that the women using this plans to have a natural unmedicated birth and possibly even one at home. The only time the doctor tells you to push is if you are medicated and don't feel your own body.  Don't waste your money!",1319760000,,779,4.335616438356165
8046637,2,B0007CEX1S,"This video has some good labor information, and the instructor seems to know what she is talking about.  However, the scenery and filming are so unflattering and unattractive, this video did not keep my interest.  If you want real prenatal yoga get Gurmukh's or Anna Getty's DVDs- much more yoga-like and much more aesthetically pleasing.",1254355200,,338,5.127272727272727
8046638,5,B0007CEX1S,"Great for any expectant mother and her labor coach (whether husband, relative, doula, or other close friend) . Not an ""exercise"" DVD in the sense of physical workouts, but instead is poses and practice techniques to use in labor and birth, especially if you have a goal for a natural birth. My hubby and I will be using this weekly during my final trimester as we gear up for the birth of our second son. I like Rocki's straight forward manner, clear demonstrations, and her explanation of the purpose for each one.",1214524800,,515,4.608695652173913

8046640,4,B0007CEX1S,"I think my review of this video is the same as Volume 2.  I think the material in this video is good, as it does a really good job as an ""instructional"" video, but it is not a ""workout"" video.  Additionally, seeing as it does not go through the paces of doing the typical workout, but only goes through the instructional parts of it, then it makes this video extremely short.  I find this odd because volume 1 is really fast paced, and does not give you much time to be instructed, but of course on volume 1, once you pick it up, it becomes a good paced workout video.  However, volume 2 and 3 should really be on the same disk due to the short running times.  Again, the material is really good, but it needs more material on the media",1143244800,4,736,4.154929577464789
8046641,5,B0007CEX1S,My husband and I are very pleased with this volume as well as Labor Prep Vol 2 and Rocki's Prenatal Yoga Vol 1.  We wanted a non-medicated birth with our first child and this video helped both of us prepare for that as confidentally as we could.  My husband especially liked how involved and hands on he could be.  I loved the relaxation technigues and poses.,1126051200,3,359,4.409090909090909
8046642,5,B0007CEX1S,"We'd taken a Bradley class with my first baby and it didn't do much for me. I got Labor Prep 2 and this one for my second and what a huge difference! I used so many things she teaches on the DVD-breathing, different poses, movement, acupressure. The last hour before I started pushing was me moving my hips with my husband massaging my back-and I'm convinced that's why it only took 2 pushes for my son to be born. Rocki really seems to know alot about childbirth and her techniques helped me immeasurably. Great DVD. (I feel the same way about the previous one in the series-Labor Prep 2.)",1123545600,4,590,4.422018348623853
