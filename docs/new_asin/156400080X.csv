186559,1,156400080X,"I am familiar with the concepts that Sequential Spelling incorporate in teaching spelling, hence the one star.  However, the new 2.0 version advertises this program's  ability  to type responses, which is not possible.  I contacted online support which instructs the user to follow their step by step guide prior to emailing the company.  This did not remedy the problem and my follow up email request for technical help never received a response. This purchase was a waste of money.",1367971200,,483,5.063291139240507
186560,5,156400080X,"Finally, I've found something that my spelling-challanged daughter doesn't complain about.  We tried the workbooks.  However, those are very time consuming for me and I have 3 other children that I'm homeschooling.  We tried the iPad app and that was a disaster.  The digital voice made it nearly impossible at times to know which word was said.  Not only that, the creator specifies using colored markers to make distinctions within words, so the student can pick up the pattern presented.  The iPad app made no such effort.  Everything was strictly black.  This was also another reason the workbooks were unsuccessful.  I wasn't always sure which sounds required highlighting when drawing on the board.  The video takes all the guesswork out for me.  Plus, she can do it all on the computer, without my help.  I only need to check her work when she's finished.  They also now allow the student to type the words within the program.  I get the impression that the previous version required the student to write down the words on paper or the workbook.",1346112000,7,1052,4.837078651685394
186561,5,156400080X,"I love having the DVD available, because we can still do spelling... even if I am busy or otherwise occupied at that moment. I just make sure he does it in the room with me so that I am certain he pauses after each word to write it on his own before watching them write it.",1321056000,5,273,3.892857142857143
186562,5,156400080X,My son had difficulty in spelling words. This DVD has greatly helped to improve his spelling. The sequential method makes spelling complex words easy and fun to learn. I highly recommend this DVD to any parents. It is really worth it.,1261958400,7,234,4.7317073170731705
186563,5,156400080X,"I love Sequential Spelling, but spelling is one subject that always seemed to get dropped from my homeschool day.  With this DVD my daughter does spelling first while I work with her brothers, and it is just as good as if I did it with her.  I did not also buy the book and so far haven't felt any need to do so.  I just check her list against the screen at the end of each lesson.

My one difficulty with this DVD is that the speaker has a light southern accent which causes some confusion for my child.  Sometimes the only way we know whether she is saying, for example, ""pin"" or ""pen"" is to listen to the sentence.  It's not really a problem, but it is a slight difficulty for her.  I guess there's no way around the fact that every speaker will have an accent for someone!

Anyway, I highly recommend this DVD for busy homeschooling families who want to use Sequential Spelling!",1255910400,17,882,4.271084337349397

7796417,4,156400080X,"It works for my kids, but the accent is not what we are used to hearing. We are from Michigan and the accent is from the south.  I have to ""interpret"" what she is saying. Especially with the ""en"" words that she pronounces ""in"". I would prefer that the lesson would go over the spelling rules. There is no explanation of the rules, so I usually go over the rule that is being focused on.",1444780800,,386,4.1466666666666665

7796419,2,156400080X,"I bought this edition, because it allowed my child to type the answers on the computer. However, when I downloaded the DVD onto the computer, I found that there is no place to type the answers. It seems that this is the older version, which only gives you the words verbally and then shows you the answer afterward. I'm disappointed.",1391472000,,333,4.566666666666666
7796420,5,156400080X,"This product so far is working well for our daughter.  She is a VERY phonetic speller- sometimes we get the best laughs out of how she spells things!  I like how this has immediate reinforcement instead of allowing them to ""learn the wrong way.""",1383609600,3,245,4.545454545454546
7796421,3,156400080X,"We are currently trying this program for our 3rd grader.  We have frequently had a hard time understanding the announcer's speaking voice.  There are times where ending consonants are dropped in the pronunciation of words (which makes it hard to spell words correctly).  Also, some of the words are words that we would hardly ever use in regular conversations, like, ""Aye.""  The quality of the video is not the best for the price paid.  Next time, I may end up using the workbook only.",1379030400,,485,4.726190476190476
7796422,4,156400080X,"My 8-year-old daughter was not fluently reading or spelling a year ago, but Sequential Spelling really helped her to see the patterns in spelling. I truly think this is a brilliant system.

We were only using the teacher's guide and student's workbook, but recently added this DVD. I have a newborn, so it's great that my daughter can work on this spelling on her own. I like that the words in the lessons are color-coded.

With that being said, I still have to give this DVD 4 stars. Now the new interface lets her type her answers, but I would have been really excited if it had a spelling check and paused the lesson until she got it right. As for now, the typed answers are pretty small, thus hard to see and know if she got it right. I could print the answers at the end and grade them, but then it won't follow this system that she is supposed to get them graded after each word.

If she chooses a full-screen, there is nowhere to type. Our keyboard has DVD command buttons such as play, pause, stop, rewind, and fast forward, but they get disabled with this interface. If your student is already a good speller on a keyboard, this interface is wonderful. But if one has to pause at every word, think for a while, and click back on the right box to type in, using a mouse and a keyboard will be a mundane task.

But I found a solution to make this DVD usable. Instead of double-clicking on PC_Start_Vol_1, I open, say, Day 70 file with Windows Media Player or Real Player. After I make the lesson full-screen, my daughter can pause it, using the keyboard button and write her answers in her workbook. This way, her answers are in big fonts and she doesn't have to fumble with a mouse. Now I can spend 10-15 minutes each day working on something else!

I'm thinking of buying a portable DVD player again. We used to have one, but it broke a few years back. A portable DVD player will be probably the easiest to work with for younger children.",1378252800,,1947,4.337912087912088

I think you would really like this new way of learning spelling.",1371945600,,183,4.111111111111111
7796424,5,156400080X,This version of sequential spelling is user friendly.  My children ran it the first time without me!  I love anything that helps them work independently.  I give Seq. spelling 2.0 five stars!!!,1369267200,,193,4.96875
