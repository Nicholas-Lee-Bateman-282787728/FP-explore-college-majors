7793933,5,0966965132,"Haunting. Why would these guys make this stuff up?  THAT is the obvious problem. They wouldn't. Real X Files stuff. The low production values do not detract from the content to me. Because the highlights of the program are the testimonies. Real believe it or not, impossible to explain stuff.",1505433600,,292,4.84
7793934,4,0966965132,I've been awaiting this DVD's release.  Good stuff!  Very informative.,1470960000,,70,5.9
7793935,5,0966965132,An interesting documentary indeed as I defiantly was fascinated by this documentary as it was one of the best I've seen,1358208000,,119,4.714285714285714
7793936,3,0966965132,"This video is poorly put together , jumping all over the place
but contains many informative unexplained sightings. The UFO's
do exist and there are many sighting that are not reported because
 of the peer pressure. This video is food for thought!",1297555200,,247,4.880952380952381
7793937,4,0966965132,"It talks a lot about pilot sightings of strange flying objects near their planes. Very interesting. Contains just facts and no speculations. It just describes what these things looked like to the pilots who had seen them. It does not speculate that they are alien space crafts, just what these strang flying objects looked like and what they were doing at the time of being seen. It has some very good descriptions of what they looked like and some very good interviews with the pilots and even a few audio tapes of some of these encounters.

However the DVD cover does misslead you. It tells you that it's 90 minutes when it's actually a lot shorter, and it also tells you that they have photographs and videos of some of these encounters when all it really has is sketches of the objects by the people who seen them and some computer generated images illustrating what they might have looked like. There are no real photographs or videos what so ever. But it is still worth a look at by both believers and non-believers. It even talks about a private pilot who contacted airtraffic control reporting that a very strange looking, large, and very fast object was following him. He tried to outrun and maneuver it, but it just didn't work. They maintained contact with him for about 14 minutes until they lost complete contact. He and his plane has still never been found and there was no sign of wreckage. It's very interesting the watch.",1234224000,,1438,4.63921568627451
7793938,5,0966965132,"I will admit the production is not the best in the world. However, it's not the production but the actual content that makes this a must have for anyone interested in possessing real information on UFOs without the fluff.

Shipping was fast and the DVD ran flawlessly for me.

The air traffic control recordings from actual airline pilots spotting and then reporting the UFOs is well worth the price of admission!

Bottom line...A must for anyone interested in some of the best evidence on the UFO matter, bar none.",1181433600,2,515,4.764044943820225
7793939,1,0966965132,"I recieved this DVD with no box just the DVD in a plastic slip cover and taped to a piece of cardboard inside the shipping box.

Then when I tried to play it...it repeatedly froze up.

What idiot shipped this DVD to me in this manner?

Amazon is refunding my money. But save yours and stay away from this DVD!",1101859200,7,309,4.116666666666666
7793940,3,0966965132,"My copy of Pilot UFO Sightings took six weeks to arrive, and it came without a standard DVD plastic case. Instead, it came in a paper sleeve. Upon playing the DVD for the first time, I was kind  of disappointed with the low fi quality of the whole production. The visual graphics seem to have been created at some out of the way cable start up in Helena, Montana circa 1984! They're almost laughable. The DVD sound quality also suffers at times.

  I only began to enjoy Pilot UFO Sightings when the NASA Propellerhead Dr. Richard F. Haines was given ample time to go into an in-depth explanation of some of the more well documented pilot encounters(for example, the Japan Airlines cargo plane incident over Alaska in 1986.) Haines is an entertaining lecturer, and he will no doubt keep you interested as he explains precisely why experienced pilots are some of the most qualified observers of aerial phenomena. Haines isn't long winded if you begin to follow his line of reasoning,and the documentary allows him to exposulate without unnecessary obtrusive cut aways to flashy visuals.

  In all, this low budget production stands in stark contrast to the latest generation of fast paced, low on content, Discovery Channel type productions.  And in a way, it's refreshing for that very characteristic. As an extra added bonus, the producer has included cockpit transmissions of pilots in the very process of observing UFO's. Some of the audio is hard to discern, so subtitles are provided at the bottom of the screen. I especially enjoyed the pilot to control tower conversations, and I will be passing them on to a friend who is eager to sample them and to incorporate them into some experimental dub house music. In short, if you're a UFO enthusiast, this DVD will be a fine addition to your collection.",1093564800,10,1805,4.818770226537217
7793941,5,0966965132,"This is one of the freshest topics I have seen in many years on hte whole UFO topic. It takes a fresh approach to the UFO matter by exploring commercial pilots that have seen UFOs! It is narrated and presented by Dr. Richard F. Haines-NASA Research Scientist and features pilots Captain Neil Daniels-United Airlines,& Capt. Phil Shultz-Trans World Airlines.
This is some of the most convincing UFO evidence I have yet seen that UFOs are REAL and need to be taken way more seriously!",1051056000,14,482,4.75
7793942,3,0966965132,"Richard Haines expert in UFO Pilot Sighting talks about a few airline incidents from the past years involving ufos. Very cool graphics demonstrate the encounters. There are also three live audio scripts at the end of the disc that are very interesting to listen too.
The disc mentions a running time of 90 minutes, it actually goes for around 40 minutes, I felt very cheated. The dvd has no running time info when playing which is very annoying. There is only a chapter screen menu, and no extras. Transfer is okay but can be too bright at times. Transcripts are sometimes a bit hard to read. Audio is PCM stereo.
Disc 3/5
Transfer 3/5
Audio 3/5
Extras 0/5",1046304000,10,656,4.567796610169491
