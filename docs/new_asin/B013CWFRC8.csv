7363211,5,B013CWFRC8,A must watch documentary about Puerto Rico's current status. In my opinion there are only two valid options for the island: Statehood or Independence. It is time for the people of Puerto Rico to wake up & end this undemocratic status called (Commonwealth). I personally support statehood for PR but it is up to them to decide.,1451692800,,326,4.7368421052631575

7363215,5,B013CWFRC8,"Everyone on the mainland should watch this film to understand their current relationship with Puerto Rico. This film presented three options. I believe that there are only two options. They are to either keep your US Passport and support statehood or to be willing to throw your US Passport along with all that it affords you, into the garbage and support independence. Otherwise you as a people will continue to be in purgatory. As for President Obama's urgency to return Guantanamo Bay to the Cuban people, where is this insistence for the people of Puerto Rico as the last colony.",1445817600,3,583,4.84

8727324,5,B013CWFRC8,This is an honest and balanced documentary that tries to explain in simple terms the unusual political relationship between USA and Puerto Rico. The documentarian gives equal time to opposing viewpoints and tries not to take sides leaving that responsibility to the viewer.,1492473600,,273,5.372093023255814

8727331,5,B013CWFRC8,This is an important film about Puerto Rico and its relationship with the United States. Living in limbo seems to be an unjust fate for Puerto Ricans. Independence versus statehood versus status quo...each angle is well discussed and thoroughly explored.,1454630400,,254,5.375

8727333,5,B013CWFRC8,"A must see. Loved everything about it. From the accurate historical facts to how every political party in Puerto Rico sees this situation. Loved the fact that they all had the chance to present their ideas, and that you as an individual can think by yourself, there's no ""This is the right choice"". It's just amazing, don't regret buying it. It was worth every penny.",1453334400,,367,4.661538461538462
