6979982,3,B00SCK3O44,I love Beatles music having grown up in the 50s and 60s and I particularly love all the songs Paul McCartney has written and performed over the years. I have all the MusiCares DVDs and this one for me is one of the weakest ones in terms of performers that sang Paul's songs as part of the tribute. I like Neil Young but his cover of I Saw Her Standing There was not good! Nora Jones doing Oh! Darling was ok but nothing special. Alicia Keys doing Blackbird was good. Duane Eddy doing an instrumental version of And I Love Her was good if you like an instrumental bersion of a song with such beautiful words. If you want what I consider to be the best MusiCares DVD then get MusiCares tribute to Brian Wilson. Absolutely amazing in every way but the Paul McCartney tribute was weak and probably something that will just sit on my shelf and never be watched again except if I need my Sergio Mendes fix! His version of The Fool on the Hill was wonderful and reminiscent of one of my favorite albums in high schoo...Sergio Mendes and Brazil 66!,1427587200,2,1040,4.338461538461538
6979983,5,B00SCK3O44,"In 2012, Sir Paul McCartney was honored at MusiCares ""Person Of The Year"" during Grammy Awards weekend. This benefit concert has now been issued on DVD and Blu-ray by Shout Factory.  While much too short - only 60 minutes - the performances are mostly superb, beginning with a medley of ""Get Back,"" ""Hello Goodbye,"" and ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"" with Cirque du Soleil and the cast of The Beatles' Las Vegas show&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-CD-Audio-DVD/dp/B000JJS8TM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love (CD + Audio DVD)</a>. Memo to Apple and Cirque: why can't we have a DVD of the entire show? Not everyone can afford to go to Las Vegas, and a DVD/Blu-ray release won't hurt ticket sales that much.

Macca then takes the stage to perform ""Magical Mystery Tour"" and Wings' ""Junior's Farm"" (the DJ edit version, without the verse ""At the Houses of Parliament...""). Next is Alicia Keys, who does a good version of ""Blackbird,"" but she overdoes the vocal acrobatics toward the end. Allison Krause and Union Station perform an excellent arrangement of ""No More Lonely Nights,"" from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Give-My-Regards-To-Broad-Street/dp/B0001FR552/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Give My Regards To Broad Street</a>, a McCartney song that is rarely covered. Guitar legend Duane Eddy does a beautiful acoustic version of ""And I Love Her,"" followed by Norah Jones' lovely version of ""Oh! Darling,"" from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Abbey-Road/dp/B0025KVLUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Abbey Road</a>. The weakest performance of the night was Neil Young and Crazy Horse's draggy version of ""I Saw Her Standing There"" - too slow. Sergio Mendes does an excellent Latin version of ""The Fool on The Hill,"" which was a big hit for him and Brasil '66 in the late '60s (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Celebration-A-Musical-Journey/dp/B004JIQRQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Celebration: A Musical Journey</a>, which I just purchased and highly recommend [see my review]); I enjoyed the ""Day Tripper"" bit at the end. Coldplay's version of ""We Can Work It Out"" didn't do much for me, but former Apple Records artist James Taylor and the gorgeous Diana Krall more than make up for it with their two numbers - James singing ""Yesterday,"" with Diana on piano, and then Diana with a vocal turn on ""For No One"" from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revolver/dp/B0025KVLTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revolver</a>, with James on guitar.

After receiving his award, Paul then wraps up the show, teaming with Diana Krall for ""My Valentine"" from his then-new album of standards,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kisses-on-the-Bottom-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B0076OW9DE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kisses on the Bottom (Deluxe Edition)</a>, and then rocks out on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Band-On-The-Run/dp/B003XX2O8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Band On The Run</a>&nbsp;closing track, ""Nineteen Hundred And Eighty-Five,"" before joining Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl and Ringo's brother-in-law Joe Walsh for the ""Golden Slumbers""/""Carry That Weight""/""The End"" medley from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Abbey-Road/dp/B0025KVLUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Abbey Road</a>. No, Paul did not do ""Her Majesty"" after that.

Probably due to legal reasons, some numbers were left out: Tony Bennett's version of ""Here, There, And Everywhere""; Foo Fighters' performance of ""Jet""; Paul's performance of ""I'm Gonna Sit Right Down And Write Myself A Letter""; and (thankfully) Katy (""I Kissed A Girl And I Like It"") Perry's dreadful (according to critics) version of ""Hey Jude.""

Despite the short length of the DVD, this is an excellent tribute, where the good moments far outshine the bad. Five stars.",1427500800,14,4033,6.808139534883721

6979986,4,B00SCK3O44,"If Paul McCartney is in it, It's good. I haven't seen too many MusiCares tributes I didn't like. This one sure didn't disappoint. This is from 2012. One of the best highlights was watching Neil Young's interpretation of ""I Saw Her Standing There"" . That in Itself was worth the purchase price. That and a newer song Paul did with Joe Walsh on the acoustic guitar. Which was like hearing an early Beatles tune. An hour of fun. But, rent this, don't purchase.. Watching it is fun.. It's well worth the rental price. Not worth the purchase price.",1449619200,,543,4.551020408163265

6980003,4,B00SCK3O44,"After reading some reviews I had to give a counter opinion about Neil Young and Crazy horse. Several reviewers singled them out as the weakest performance. I liked them the best. Many of the acts gave note perfect, pretty performances but leaned toward soft, easy listening. Neil & the Horse added some needed grit to the proceedings. It was mentioned that they played too slow, in fact they aren't that far off The Beatles original  tempo. But Neil Young and Crazy Horse aren't known for speed metal. The boys rocked it up. The crowd reaction certainly was enthusiastic. It's always down to personal preference.",1433548800,5,612,4.884615384615385

I gave it 4 Stars because MusiCares gives some artists 90 minute tributes and Sir Paul McCartney, one of the most prolific and celebrated songwriters and performers of our time, only rates a 60 minute tribute?

6980013,5,B00SCK3O44,"Shout Factory just released A MusiCares Tribute To Paul McCartney. It is without a doubt the most exciting 60 minutes of music video I have watched in ages.  The show builds on fans love for McCartney with enough variety and top performances to hold my interest and build to a strong climax.

The Blu-ray is stunningly clear, the sound is dynamic and the performances build rock excitement one after another until the hair-raising finale of Paul McCartney, Dave Grohl, Joe Walsh, tour band guitarists Rusty Anderson, and Brian Ray in a guitar duel on The End, the climactic medley from Abbey Road. After watching it once, I jumped up and said to my wife Youve got to see this totally awesome video!

McCartneys tour band backs most of the performers on the disc which gives them the edge and keeps the show from bogging down into weak covers. Rusty Anderson (guitar), Abe Laboriel Jr. (drums), Brian Ray (guitar) and Wix Wickens (keyboards) have backed McCartney for more than 10 years and have the songs down cold. Anderson and Ray more than hold their own against Joe Walsh and Dave Grohl in the guitar duel which is fun to watch.

Two years ago at the Grammys, the artists put on a grand show including Paul McCartneys guitar duel with Dave Grohl and Joe Walsh on the The End (See  NJN Network Grammys 2012 Paul McCartney Golden Slumbers The End).

After watching the 2012 show, I wondered why the deuce the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) does not release videos of the best performances.  The bootlegs on YouTube are OK but they fail to capture the excitement of the real performances. Compressing rock music on YouTube does exactly that  it compresses the excitement.

Impulsively I sent Neil Portnoy,  the President of NARAS and the man who leads the Grammys, a message the next day.  You are missing a source of revenue by not releasing the Grammy shows on DVD and Blu-ray, I said.

While I doubt Portnoy reads my emails I was pleased to see the announcement of A MusiCares Tribute To Paul McCartney and the pre-release news about the Bob Dylan MusiCares February 2013 tribute. See NJN Dylan MusiCares Shall Be Released.

The Blu-ray starts with Cirque du Soleil performing a medley of Get Back/Hello Goodbye and Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band. Im not a big fan of Cirque but had to admit it might have entertained in the theatre. Then McCartney and his band segue into Magical Mystery Tour and wind up the excitement with Juniors Farm. The fun begins.

Alicia Keys followed with Blackbird in a performance that shines on the disk while paling on YouTube. McCartney wrote Blackbird in 1968 about racial disruptions in the US. Alicia says that the song was written for her and suddenly her soulful performance makes sense.

Alison Krauss sang No More Lonely Nights beautifully. I wonder if she is wasting her time limiting herself to bluegrass country.

Duane Eddy is a surprise with his tasteful guitar solo on the ballad And I Love Her backed by Joe Walsh.  He was a blast from the past with his twangy Gretsch guitar sound.

Norah Jones sings Oh! Darling as a dreamy rock ballad. The show was almost grinding to a halt when Neil Young stepped up to grunge rock I Saw Her Standing There. It was a most unlikely pairing of artist and song but Neil blew everyone away with his energy.

Sergio Mendes, the 1966 bossa nova, jazz and funk artist, followed with a Latin flavored version of The Fool on the Hill which was surprisingly fun.  I thought Coldplay was going to die on We Can Work it Out but they caught their groove after the first verse and brought the song home.

James Taylor and Diana Krall traded vocals on Yesterday and For No One. If there was a flat spot it was James Taylor but only by a tad. Diana Krall is exquisitely jazzy as always. She is a class act.

Paul had just released the CD Kisses on the Bottom when this show was put together so no surprise that he performs My Valentine here with Joe Walsh doing his surprising classical guitar lead.

McCartney winds the band up for Nineteen Hundred and Eighty Five and goes directly into the climax medley of Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight / The End. Like I said, the excitement was  building until the hair was standing up on the back of my neck for The End. It was a totally awesome 60 minutes.

Tony LiPuma, who produced My Valentine and the CD Kisses on the Bottom, was the musical producer for the show. While some might argue for more rock songs than ballads, the show holds together as a whole and delivers a big emotional hit. Its hard to argue with that.

The sound on the Blu-ray is DTS-HD and PCM Stereo. I preferred the PCM sound which is less compressed but only by a small margin.

Proceeds from the Blu-ray will go to the MusiCares foundation that provides help to performers with medical, personal or other financial needs. Its a great idea since its more likely musicians will end their lives in need than be comfortably wealthy.",1429056000,4,4953,4.60523321956769

This concert did not met my expectations. The renditions seemed very uninspired. I love new interpretations that don't try to copy the original but in this case they did not bring anything new and in most cases were soulless for me. Paul's appearance is Ok, but we have many other concerts available. For this concert the appeal was the other artists and personally I didn't like them.
