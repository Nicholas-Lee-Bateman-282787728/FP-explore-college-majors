8457582,5,B00556DYYI,"The hero, Lieutenant Gerard, isn't the brightest turnip on the truck; but that's okay, because he has the Countess de Launay to do all the thinking in their partnership.  But he is brave and charming (and a bit of a braggart) and wonderfully played by Rod LaRocque.  This is a fast-paced, wonderful adventure movie with two charismatic lead actors.",1460160000,,348,4.88135593220339
8457583,5,B00556DYYI,"Rod La Rocque and Phyllis Haver star in a wonderful period drama in which egos and mayhem make for interesting plot developments. Done in the same vein as THE EAGLE, BARDELYS THE MAGNIFICENT, and most of Douglas Fairbanks' pictures, THE FIGHTING EAGLE is a great addition to the library of any silent film collector.",1459296000,,316,4.87037037037037
8457584,4,B00556DYYI,It is amazing to watch a film that was made in 1927. A silent movie with humour and intrigue. I am a Napoleon fan and the actor who plays the character does an amazing job.,1351555200,,172,3.942857142857143
