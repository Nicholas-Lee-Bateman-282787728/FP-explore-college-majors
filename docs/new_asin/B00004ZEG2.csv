7928427,4,B00004ZEG2,"A Tabaluga DVD? My eyes lit up when I saw the product title across the screen. Until I bought this item, I hadn't seen this lovely heartwarming television program since I was a kid. It is a welcome experience seeing that adorable but courageous green and yellow dragon outwitting that dumb tyrannical snowman Arktos again. Hearing the opening and closing theme songs also brought back special memories.

However, if you are looking for a complete series box set of Tabaluga, I'm sorry to say that only the first two episodes are on this DVD. Another problem, albeit a small one in my opinion, is if you need to change the language to one that suits you, you are going to have to wait until the main menu and decipher where the language selection is. Fortunately, the choices have symbols next to them that are easy to understand. Language has the image of a mouth.

So if you find that you cannot wait for a complete series DVD to become commercially available then this and its subsequent volumes should tide you over. But if you believe you can wait, then ask yourselves this question. How long WILL you have to wait?",1315699200,,1119,4.59
