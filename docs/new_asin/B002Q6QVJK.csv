8377525,3,B002Q6QVJK,"The original full length film shot in 1947 was an ""official"" Southern Pacific promotional film by a noted director. This is a 1950-52 're-edit, that cuts out all the beautiful ""steam locomotive"" shots and half of the narrator's story. BUT, it is still a good DVD of the 1950 railroads.",1412899200,,285,4.72

8377527,1,B002Q6QVJK,This is NOT made 1940. This was made around 1947. Even the dvd states this was AFTER WWII.I wish I could get the correct one. I already have 1947 version and the 1952 version.,1329868800,,175,4.176470588235294
