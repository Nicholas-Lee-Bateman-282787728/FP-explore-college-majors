7842526,5,6303274471,"so wish we could find this workout in dvd format
it's a natural workout rather than all the fancy and can be taken anywhere cause you don't need equipment to complete workout",1384300800,,174,4.46875
7842527,5,6303274471,"I have had this tape for roughly 16 years and just wore it out, so I had to order a new one. Very good, simple exercise routine, nothing jarring, highly recommend it",1364515200,,165,4.1875
7842528,5,6303274471,This is my second Workout America VHS tape. I bought the first one in 1995 and it finally bit the dust. I was so happy to be able to order a new one and work out with Joan Lunden and her friends again.,1298505600,,201,3.697674418604651
7842529,5,6303274471,"This is crazy but my wife has used this vhs since it came out in the 90s. Over and over again, so obviously she must like it. Finally, the thing broke, the tape got so worn it just shreded. So no, she won't get any other exercise program, she had to have this on new in the box. Fortunately for me, it was on Amazon. At first it was slow and fuzzy, although it was wrapped as new, it still got dust in the works. I just fast forwarded it a couple of time and now it works perfectly. My wife is happy now. I'm totaly amazed, I have never seen her so dedicated to anything like this. She just uses it and uses it and at 59, she has the body to prove it. Amazing. Thanks Joan.",1286841600,,673,3.8840579710144927
7842530,5,6303274471,"Even after 16 years, I love this routine.  It has helped me lose 30 pounds without sore muscles.  I wish it would be released on DVD.  I am 64 years old, and still going strong.  Many other workouts leave my back aching, but this one makes me feel energetic and limber.  We need more like this one for young at heart seniors.",1278892800,3,325,4.17741935483871
7842531,5,6303274471,"This is a fun way to feel healthier!  As a fan of Joan Lunden on GMA, it was like inviting an old friend to my house.  The first part is energizing and even when I don't have time for the full workout, I cue up the floor  exercises and they definitely do the job!  I'm ordering another copy to  give as a gift.",916876800,5,310,3.857142857142857
