4105238,3,B003B3V0O8,"The reason I purchased this DVD set was ""Valley of the Dolls"" which is an excellent movie. ""All About Eve"" turned out to be
a good movie.  I have not watched ""The Inn of the Sixth Happiness"" but I attempted to watch ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"".
How bad could it be? It was written by a movie critic. ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"" is one of the worst movies I have
ever tried to see in my life.  I've seen amateur films that were of better quality than this one.  Divide the cost of this set
by 3 because you are only getting 3 good movies (assuming that ""The Inn of the Sixth Happiness"" is good).

I was really thinking about investing in the other movie sets.  But after this experience IF I buy another set of movies from
this label I will do extensive research first.",1332806400,3,778,4.16
4105239,5,B003B3V0O8,"If you enjoy the classic movies, this is an excellent family film.  There is
actually a story, little violance, and beautiful scenery.  I know that everyone will enjoy this film.  I enjoyed The Valley of the Dolls but not quite as much.
It had some stars from the past like Patty Duke and Sharon Tate.  I think that
this is not really for kids.  It deals with drugs and alcohol.  I did not like
The Return to the Valley of the Dolls.  This movie has nothing to do with the
original film.  It is full of sex. violance, loud music and alcohol.  Not my type
of movie.  I haven't watched All About Eve with Betty Davis.  I prefer colored
films and this is in black and white but it did take best picture for 1950 so at
some point I will watch it.  The Inn of the Sixth Happiness is actually the
reason that I purchased this set.",1311984000,,824,4.1455696202531644
4105240,5,B003B3V0O8,"I had never bought a set of old movies in the ""Classic Quad Set"" syle and was wonderfully surprised at how really nice they were. Each movie is on its' own disc, and I had assumed that the four movies would be on two discs.  And THAT would have been a problem as of right now for me.  The reason it would have been a problem is a rather typical story as follows.

MY DVD player died after a number of years, and I was shocked.  I was shocked, because I am sixty years old and am not used to built-in break-down; that my son, who is a senior software designer for special projects at Intel( I always get that speck of info in, because it so impresses me!) has assured me that most electronics on the consumer level are made that way- as they are not telescopes to Mars, or atom bombs that require great precision. So, I borrowed my daughter's DVD player, which works wonderfully, but is very simple, to the point that there are no hand controls, hardly-just on-off, and play-pause, and in-out (for the disc).  And for some reason the remote did not come along with the DVD player-  and THAT is another story in itself!  The remote has now been located, but I don't have it.  And the chances of getting it are seemingly dwindling...

So, for the quick and savvy readers of reviews, you can see where this is headed, it is not possible to watch more than the first movie (on a two-movie disc) unless I watched them both at once- one right after another, which I cannot do.  The DVD does not have a timer, if I remove the disc, it restarts from the beginning.

The point of all this wordiness is to say that the fact that each movie was on its own disc was an absolute shock and awe experience.  Plus, the quality and reproduction was really so excellent to what I had assumed (my expectations seem to be low!) AND they were delevered really fast in real time.

So I want to give my small opinion of one regular person that I was NOT in the least
disappointed, but really thrilled with the whole thing , and I had recklessly bought three sets of four movies each- without even checking as to reviews or how they were packaged or anything.  It had been a truly impulse buy and one I am so glad that I did!  Five Stars for the Classic Quad Sets of movies!  Jennifer Jameson, Portland Oregon",1301961600,5,2284,4.276744186046511
4105241,5,B003B3V0O8,"Fox Classics has released many titles from their back-catalogue in four-movie ""quad"" box collections. It's a cheaper option than buying each title individually, and does help save valuable shelf space as well.

ALL ABOUT EVE:
The bitchiest, back-bitingest backstage drama of them all!  Bette Davis and Anne Baxter are in peak form in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's most delicious of movies.  Stage legend Margo Channing (Davis) is the idol of Eve (Baxter), a devoted fan who soon worms her way into Margo's life - but aims to eclipse her as the greatest star on Broadway.

BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS:
Film critic Roger Ebert penned the script for this tawdry Russ Meyer sex romp, which pertains to be a sequel to the Jacqueline Susann story, but only really shares it's title.  The movie ""unzips"" the crazed, debauched lifestyles of the California music set, with John La Zar in a fruity performance as 'Z-Man'.

THE INN OF THE SIXTH HAPPINESS:
Following up her acclaimed turn as ""Anastasia"", Ingrid Bergman again charms as real-life missionary Gladys Aylward (""The Little Woman"").  The movie somewhat embellishes Aylward's own life story, creating a fictional romance with a Eurasian army captain (Curt Jurgens); but it's a fascinating story.

VALLEY OF THE DOLLS:
Jacqueline Susann's bestselling pulp fiction masterpiece lost a lot of it's bite in the eventual movie version, but the performances are super.  Patty Duke is Neely O'Hara, the ""born in a trunk"" showbiz whiz who soon dissolves into pills and booze, Barbara Parkins plays Anne Welles, the good girl from Lawrenceville who gets mixed up with the wrong kind of guy; and Sharon Tate is ""untalented"" Jennifer North, in perhaps the most eerie performance of her short career.",1291248000,28,1731,5.066901408450704

4105294,5,B003B3V0O8,"I read with some bemusement the reviewer here who thought ONE of these 4 films was ""one of the worst movies I ever saw"" and was ""EXTREMELY disappointed"" and used all caps to prove it! Can you guess the one she was referring too? I can, because that's the ONLY reason I bought this collection! That, my friends, is what happens when the average white-bread stay-at-home viewer is confronted with Russ Meyer for the first time in the camouflage of a seemingly conventional 4 film collection! (Word to the wise, stay away from anything with the name Todd Solondz in the credits, he of fame also garnered through a film with Doll in the title as well)

All About Eve is an old-school classic, true. Inn of Sixth Happiness--well, never heard of that one. Valley of the Dolls is a true soap-operatic potboiler that was outdated when it came out! In its own unintentional campy way it IS a classic of its kind--it is after all based on a Jacqueline Susann novel--not exactly JD Salinger material here.

But Beyond The Valley of the Dolls was built from the ground up as a satire of the then-current hippie/hipster So. California lifestyle with the Valley of the Dolls-women seeking fame and fortune-formula as a foundation, and it accomplishes this brilliantly. Even today this movie is still relevant--as witnessed in the recent popular Austin Powers films, for which this provided much of the blueprint and is even quoted verbatim: ""This is my happening and it freaks me out!"". Usually there is a span of years before a satirical eye can be effectively turned on a specific era like this--i.e. Dazed and Confused was not made in 1976, but some 20 years later. But BVD was covering it as is was happening--a rarity to say the least.

Add to this, the fact that you have some pretty decent music on the soundtrack that could stand by itself, as well as other interesting themes for a film released in 1970, such as a Manson-like rampage, a porn actress, homosexuality, transgender issues, drug use, a Mohammed Ali type figure, a Phil Spector type character who spouts Shakespearean dialog, an actor who was Tim Curry before there was a Tim Curry etc., etc.. Here is one film that definitely bears repeated viewing. While its no masterpiece of the times ala Midnight Cowboy or Five Easy Pieces, it is nonetheless a standout cult film of the late 60s/early 70s. And it's damn entertaining as well.

BTW, the ""official"" solo release of this film is a whopping $50 here on Amazon. The version presented here is top quality visual-wise, and while it may not be loaded with extra goodies galore, you can't beat the $13 price tag. A definite best buy purchase for pervs on a budget!

Note: Meyer even manages to sneak in some of his long running stock characters into this mainstream release, i.e. Martin Borman, Erica Gavin and Charles Napier (the only RM company actor to have a ""real"" mainstream acting career post-Meyer).

Additional note and spoiler alert:
In this film, the Phil Spector character actually kills a girl by putting a gun into her mouth and firing it.
The real-life Phil Spector was accused of this exact same crime in 2003 in the shooting death of actress Lana Clarkson and was found guilty and sentenced to 19 to life in prison--some 13 years AFTER the events portrayed in this film! (There is an excellent HBO movie starring Al Pacino as Spector which covers this case that is definitely worth watching)

Then there's Bet Davis' line ""Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy evening."" And The Dolls flicks ? Pure camp, starring Dolly Parton-like Barbie dolls. What's not to like ? But who ever thought of this combination of films ?",1356566400,6,330,4.516666666666667
4105301,5,B003B3V0O8,"The Valley of the Dolls along with Beyond the Valley of the Dolls? And its historical bitchfest predecessor, All About Eve? I had to get this and boy am I glad I did. I hadn't seen either of those two films in decades and I laughed my ass off at both. Both are also visually fantastic- especially the Mod Fashion sequences of ""The Valley of The Dolls"". Perfect timepiece. And there are so many quotable lines in both -- ""They say I'm self-destructive --- SO WHAT?"" and the classic ""It's my scene and it freaks me out!"" (from ""Beyond"".)

Roger Ebert's commentary on ""Beyond"" explains a lot about this bizarre movie- hard to believe that he wrote such a weird film as he seems rather staid. He talks about how he and Russ Meyer wrote it on the fly, satirizing the first film's over-the-top melodrama. It makes sense too, since this non-sequel's twists and turns are almost random and pointless. It also explains the peculiar script style; how all the characters openly declare their motivations and act in a somewhat old-fashioned acting style for the 60s.

And the all-female band is actually, in its hokey Hollywood way, pretty great. There are a few really catchy songs and you can tell they had some kind of Grace Slick-type of vocalist as a model for their sound. And of course, the musical numbers are played against the most awesome montages ever. When Ebert explains Meyer's montage style, you really notice how perfect the overly-stylized tactic works. Probably not workable in any other kind of genre, also, so this film's a rare treat.

I have no idea what the Ingrid Bergman movie is doing in this set; other than maybe this was intended to be marketed as a collection of 'women's films' or proto-chick-flicks. Or perhaps they felt the need to balance out all the decadent bitchery with some wholesomeness.

And of course the original ""Valley"" is a top-notch Mod Showbiz Melodrama. Patty Duke really gets all the best lines in it and gets to really let it hit the fan. And the Rehab musical sequence is truly unbelievable. You will die laughing; they don't make movies like this anymore- in fact, this might be the only one of its kind they ever made! Ridiculous, yet so tightly directed and edited- the opening 'leaving home' sequence sets the tone for the stylized production of the rest of the film. You are watching True ShowBiz, honey. Now it's common for Hollywood to cover its own darkside, but this was supposedly ground-breaking and it really pulls out all the stops. Sure, stars go to rehab all the time now, but do they sing in their wheelchairs --waking from dementia? I think not.

Anyway, this set was a real find!",1351209600,34,2638,4.676724137931035
