5570270,5,B00BBI7DU0,"After waiting almost an eternity for Warner to release this series, in any format, I am very happy to have the complete two seasons of the best detective show ever. Harry O was a thinking mans detective at a time when TV was transitioning from shows with quality scripts by great writers and good acting into the low intellectual fare staring the latest personality that make up most of TV programming today. I had the original pilot, Such Dust as Dreams Are Made On, on VHS so I liked the idea of getting the quality DVD copy included with the set.",1365206400,10,549,4.445544554455446
5570271,5,B00BBI7DU0,"Having purchased season one I was very much looking forward to this one, and I was not disapointed. I had waited years for Harry O to be released on DVD having watched in originally in the 70s. I believe it was very much ahead of its time, in that it didn't go for spectacular action secenes; instead it relied on some great acting from the superb David Janssen and the equally good Anthony Zerbe. It was really underplayed for the time, Orwell was the classic down at heel dective in the mould of Philip Marlowe. If in a rare fist fight, Orwell quite often came off second best, he was anti-authority who enjoyed his own company. He did however care about the weak and vulnerable, and would quite often work for nothing. It was above all believable, and thats what makes this such a great tv show, I would highly recommend it.",1364860800,15,827,4.447368421052632
5570272,5,B00BBI7DU0,This is one of the best shows. I loved it.  need to see!!!!!  It was new and scenery and lots of stars,1363996800,8,102,3.590909090909091
5570273,5,B00BBI7DU0,"After viewing this exceptional DVD set you'll be convinced that ABC-TV was **INSANE** to cancel HARRY O in 1976--despite critical acclaim and (perhaps more important) high ratings after only two seasons.  Television networks rarely know when they have a good thing and such was the case for HARRY O.  Regardless, THANK YOU Warner Archive for releasing HARRY O on DVD!  Hopefully--before this decade is out--there will be a DVD release of David Janssen's RICHARD DIAMOND, PRIVATE DETECTIVE (a.k.a. CALL MR. D) TV series as well.  That would be a dream come true!",1360540800,33,561,5.065217391304348
5570274,5,B00BBI7DU0,"I've been waiting a long time for this release.  I always felt the show improved with age once the chemistry between Orwell and Trench was firmly established.  The light humorous moments were wonderful and added a special touch to the series.  Who knows what direction this show would have taken if some network executive hadn't decided to cancel this show in favour of another; wrong choice in my opinion.  There was a lot of potential left in this show to continue and explore other aspects of Harry's life, both personal and professional.  I often ponder a proper ending to this series would see Harry completing the repair of his boat and sailing off into the sunset (as the saying goes).  One of Janssens' best series.",1360540800,27,723,4.744

5570276,5,B00BBI7DU0,Finally we get Harry O on DVD. Finally the second and final season comes to DVD. Harry O play a retired police officer turned private investigator. Classic show and it David Janssen at his best. The show rivals the fugitive for  quality. The shows are real treat to watch again. The picture and sound quality are excellent. They are made on demand so they come in a simple case with just standard packaging. But seriously who needs more. After all it is the show we want to watch and it is great to have these in my collection.,1449619200,,527,4.377551020408164

5570289,5,B00BBI7DU0,Looked for DVDs of this series for years. Finally got my wish and was not disappointed.,1420848000,,87,4.5
5570290,4,B00BBI7DU0,"Great series that should have lasted much longer.  It got cancelled and was replaced by an inferior series, Charlie's Angels.  I admit the Angels are easier to look at than rumpled Harry O, but, Harry O's stories are in a whole different league.  Anyway, we love this series but knocked a star off because Season Two continues the changes that took place mid-way through the previous season, changing the location and the tone of the show slightly.  Still, David Janssen plays Harry consistently, showing why Janssen was one of the busiest actors on TV during the 1970's..  Harry O was a one-of-a-kind private cop and this is a one of a kind TV show.",1420761600,3,650,4.666666666666667
5570291,5,B00BBI7DU0,I cant say I loved it but my husband sat 10 hrs and watched straight.  Needless to say he was thrilled,1419120000,3,102,3.857142857142857
5570292,5,B00BBI7DU0,Loved to see Farrah Fawcett!,1410393600,,28,4.8
5570293,5,B00BBI7DU0,I purchased both seasons. Just wish the show had lasted longer. Grew up in the 70's and in San Diego but never watched the show. Got the Fugitives four season set and was so impressed by David Janssen that I bought the Harry O series and glad I did. Some of the episodes were a little boring but Harry made up for it. They didn't spend much on wardrobe though since he wore the same clothes in just about every episode.,1403654400,,419,4.185185185185185
5570294,5,B00BBI7DU0,This was a gem of a private detective series that debuted in the mid-seventies with David Janssen.  The cast also included Anthony Zerbe playing against type in a good guy roll. The pairing of the two was perfect as was the rest of the supporting cast. The series only had two seasons because of network politics and came to an untimely end.  If you are into 70's nostalgia this is series not to miss.,1401408000,3,401,4.405405405405405
5570295,5,B00BBI7DU0,Excellent series!!! Janssen in top form playing very likeable title character. Bought both seasons and the feature length pilot direct from Warner Bros when they first came out. Recalled seeing many of them when they initially aired back in the 70's. The only thing about them that doesn't carry forward well is the early/mid 70's mod clothing that some of the more hip characters in the series wore. Otherwise just as enjoyable as the first time around. Always a mystery to me why it had such a short run - only two seasons. Surely deserved a far longer run.,1388966400,2,559,4.656565656565657
5570296,5,B00BBI7DU0,What a shame that this show had only two seasons. Harry Orwell is a great character and David Jansen plays him to a tee. His low key performance is perfect.,1388448000,2,156,4.233333333333333
5570297,4,B00BBI7DU0,"Harry O concluded with its 1975-6 season highlighted by the superb interplay between David Janssen's private detective Harry Orwell and his LAPD nemesis Lt. K.C. Trench, interplay that helped Anthony Zerbe win an Emmy.  Orwell solves cases involving a varierty of clinets, but the series' charm lay in Orwell, a burned out former San Diego cop injured in a liquor store robbery.  Orwell's inability to find happiness is illustrated in the episode ""Reflections"" when a candidate for high state court is being blackmailed by a former mental hospital intern and the candidate's wife is Harry's former wife, and having to help her brings out in Harry that he still loves her and can't love another woman as a result.

Harry also has to deal with wannabe-detective Lester Hodges.  This leads to the series' funniest episode ""Mister Five and Dime"" where Lester gets Harry and Trench mixed up with varied federal investigators searching for a gang of armored car thieves who also kidnap a maker of funny money.

Harry periodically gets rescued by Trench and always gets the upper hand on the lieutenant, and the relationship between the two is always crackerjack.",1385596800,6,1156,5.031413612565445
5570298,5,B00BBI7DU0,"What a treat it has been to FINALLY see the Harry O series, on DVD. I watched this show as a teenager the first time. Now, it's even better, being able to view it as an adult.

I have both Harry O Season 1 and Season 2 and love them both, but I think the show got even better in the second season. The stories are so engaging, with great guest stars.

David Janssen is one of my favorite actors of all time. Loved watching him in The Fugitive and many movies. And Anthony Zerbe is great in this series too as Lt. Trench. Their on/off again friendship and rivalry adds so much to each episode.

I stopped watching TV shows of all kinds, a few years ago because this kind of quality entertainment seems to be a thing of the past on the tube. Sad that there was only 2 seasons for Harry O but at least now fans can enjoy it again, with these DVDs.

Buy both DVDs, you won't be sorry. Really memorable and highly recommended!",1384560000,6,921,4.128491620111732
5570299,5,B00BBI7DU0,"If you liked the first season, you won't want to miss the second season. I still cannot believe this show was ever cancelled. I wish there was more, but oh well.",1384300800,3,161,4.225806451612903
5570300,5,B00BBI7DU0,"David Janssen was the best!  Harry O is entertaining and it's fun to see his character change as the season progresses. Good chemistry between Harry and Lt. Trench.  Check out You Tube, Harry O Bloopers for some fun stuff.",1383091200,4,222,4.666666666666667
5570301,5,B00BBI7DU0,"Wished there were more to watch, but not.  Harry O and Lt. Trench are a great pair.  Good plots, story line (s), and acting.",1379721600,3,124,4.125
5570302,5,B00BBI7DU0,I think David Janssen plays the beach bum detective very well--many of the episodes are filled with a driving plot with him putting himself on the line in his job.,1378080000,3,163,4.466666666666667
5570303,4,B00BBI7DU0,"Harry o the second season, i enjoyed both seasons immensely. david janssen was such a great actor and
the guest stars on the show sent me back on a trip down memory lane. Anthony Zerbe is also one of
favorite character actors  and the rapport between him and Janssen was priceless in season 2
The scenery in California was to die for and everything about the ist and 2nd seasons was top notch.
 It was a travesty when they cancelled this series after 2 seasons, it was truly an entertaining series.
Also sad was the passing of David Janssen in 1981 at the early age of 49. At least we have this
series ,The Fugitive, Richard Diamond  and his excellent role in movies especially in Warning Shot
to appreciate this actor's superb talent.

5570304,5,B00BBI7DU0,"Spending an evening with David Janssen as private investigator Harry O with his beached boat The Answer, his beautiful but quirky neighbors, and his temperamental car is one of a hot summer's greatest pleasures. There's only one problem with this great series. It ended much too soon.",1375142400,4,284,5.0638297872340425
5570305,5,B00BBI7DU0,"This is a great television series but it is not ""The Fugitive"", perhaps the greatest of all classic TV shows. To this viewer, ""Harry O"" shows what a great actor the late David Janssen was by virtue of the fact that while not denigrating his acting ability whatsoever, ""Harry O"" seems more like the real David Janssen while Dr. Richard Kimble is a completely different character altogether. Janssen's acting in ""The Fugitive"" is at times so subtle it is very easy to suspend disbelief and think Janssen really is Kimble.

If you have viewed and then viewed once again the entire DVD series of ""The Fugitive"", be sure not to overlook ""Harry O"". Unfortunately, there are some glaring flaws with this production most likely caused by the numbskull executives at ABC. The first half of Season 1 takes place in San Diego, with a back-story to match and a refreshing change from every other crime series that are invariably filmed in L.A. San Diego has some lovely locations and the Coronado Bridge is featured quite frequently. The beachy San Diego flavor is nicely worked into the various episodes coupled with a laid-back musical theme that fits Harry to a T. Then, with no explanation whatsoever, Harry takes up residence in L.A. He moves in to an apartment close to three young, ditzy stewardesses. Neither the apartment or the stewardesses last long. Harry quickly moves into a ""house"" similar in nature to his pad in San Diego but this time on the beach in Santa Monica where he has a place to dry-dock his boat. It is a clumsy and totally unnecessary relocation although there are two added benefits which are huge additions to the series with the appearance of Anthony Zerbe and a very young and gorgeous pre ""Angel"" Farrah Fawcett Majors as his next door neighbor.

Once the viewer suffers through the totally commercialized credits and completely forgettable new theme song, settle back for 51 minutes of witty and humorous drama with plots that are nicely complex considering the brief time span allotted for the teleplay to unfold. Undoubtedly the best parts of the scripts are the interactions between Orwell and Lt. Trench (Anthony Zerbe)with Farrah thrown in for some excellent eye candy in a few episodes. Even with the network doing there best to screw up the show and then absurdly cancelling a series with a large audience, ""Harry O"" is a very entertaining TV show and most will find David Janssen's performances and the character he plays to be extremely likable",1374192000,13,2476,4.837264150943396
5570306,5,B00BBI7DU0,The lineup of enjoyable guest stars continues! Just like the first season the product was of high quality and arrived on time.,1373673600,2,126,4.7727272727272725

5570308,5,B00BBI7DU0,I remember watching repeats of this show in the 1980's . It was just as good as I remember it - scripts and casting was well done. Can't understand why this show only lasted two seasons. It was immensely better than many other shows of the era. David Janssen gave another classic performance with just the right mix of drama and a light touch of humor.,1372204800,3,352,4.348484848484849
5570309,5,B00BBI7DU0,"It was a perfect show!  Too short lived.  Last year you could only get season 1.  As soon as I saw this was available, I snapped it up.

5570310,5,B00BBI7DU0,"Harry O is one of the best all time detective shows. Harry is unique in many ways. Excellent at his job, sort of unkempt in appearance and eccentric in personality. Every aspect of this show was A+: writing, music, acting, etc.",1370304000,3,227,4.560975609756097

5570312,5,B00BBI7DU0,"I can still remember the shock I felt upon reading that Harry O had been cancelled.  The series was doing well in the ratings and beating its competition, the mediocre Barnaby Jones on CBS.  Yet the series was cancelled with no explanation other than that a new regime had taken over at ABC and didn't like it. (We learned this later.)  Anyway, I always felt that the second season of Harry O was superior to the first.  The series had worked out its kinks and the great David Janssen worked well with Anthony Zerbe as Lt. Trench.  Zerbe won a supporting actor Emmy for this role.  (Isn't it amazing that David Janssen, tv's greatest actor as far as I'm concerned, never won an Emmy for either this series or The Fugitive?)
In conclusion, I'm happy that this series has been released so that others can discover tv's greatest Private Detective  as well as most prematurely cancelled series.",1367366400,9,890,4.630573248407643
