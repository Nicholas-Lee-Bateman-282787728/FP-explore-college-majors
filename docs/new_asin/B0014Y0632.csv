8256565,5,B0014Y0632,Morgan and Joe Wooten give plenty of pointers and a great breakdown for building a team defense. I would like this to be a little longer and give a few more pointers but this is still a great dvd for any coach learning the game.,1300060800,,228,4.088888888888889
8256566,5,B0014Y0632,"This was  a great dvd for coaches everywhere looking to build a strong team defense.  The dvd shows the philosophy Coach Wooten used to build his high school dynasty and specific drills used to build his man to man defense.  It goes into great detail from running a shell drill to how to force an offense to the baseline.  Any coach looking for ways their team can improve on defense needs to own this dvd.  The only negative is that Morgan Wooten does not do most of the teaching throughout the dvd.  It is done by his brother, who is a great teacher of the game, but does not have as big of a name as Morgan Wooten.",1231113600,,617,4.186440677966102
