2890057,4,B000SSNH7W,"It was 1975 and Richard ""Apollo"" Hatch was still three years away from the role of a lifetime in ""Battlestar Galactica"" when he took the role of Jesse in Noel Nosseck's BEST FRIENDS.  Things weren't too bad, he had Doug Chapin along as Jesse's best friend Pat, fresh out of the military and in need of a ride home, he had Susanne Benton playing Jesse's fiance Kathy, the only woman he's ever loved, and there was petite Ann Noland as Jo Ella, Pat's girlfriend.  The three show up to pick up Pat and take him home, but they decide, instead of flying, it would be boss idea to rent an RV and have a little road trip on the way home.  After all, once they get home, Jesse and Kathy plan to get married, and after that, there'll be no more opportunities for road trips or anything else fun, as everyone knows.

Things are going ok for the gang.  They have a blast picking out an RV during what had to be the precursor to the modern-day music montage, Jo Ella dances topless on a bar at an Indian reservation, they almost get attacked and/or arrested, and Jesse and Pat take a little time out for target practice one hot summer afternoon.  But not everyone is having ye grande olde tyme.  Pat isn't ready for this grown-up business, and he tries to get Jesse to buy a motorcycle with him and just take off.

Can't do that, Jesse says.  He loves Kathy and he's going to marry her.

It'll be just like old times, Pat says.  We'll party, we'll throw up, we'll scam chicks.  I'll even let you take the pretty one, he says.  Just don't grow up on me too quick, man, I'm just not ready for all that jazz yet.

But growing up is exactly what Jesse intends.

Well, Pat can't take that pressure.  He buys a motorcycle anyway, and rides it alongside the RV, WAY more cooler than the squares inside.  And just in case Jesse didn't get Pat's point clearly enough, he tells Jo Ella he doesn't want to get married.

I can live with that, Jo Ella says.  After all, it's not like you're Jesse or anything.  You know he's the dreamy one.

Light bulb!  Pat has an idea.  See, the real deal is this: Pay wants Kathy.  Now whether he wants Kathy because he's smitten with her or he wants her because he's so dead inside and emotional undeveloped that he knows he could maintain some kind of relationship with her while still being true to his best friend who is the REAL love of his life, it's never clearly understood.  But he DOES want her, or more importantly, he wants Jesse to not have her.

Through a series of subtle--and some not-so-subtle--manipulations, Pat puts his plan into place driving Jesse and Kathy away from each  and bringing his best friend back to him where he belongs.

BEST FRIENDS is one of those classic 1970s movies that feels for a very long time like it's about nothing at all and only, somewhere in the third act, reveals its true plot machinations in subtle fashion.  It's not a GREAT movie, not particularly well-made or directed, and certainly not necessarily well-acted, but it is a lot of fun, and the deeper issues at the heart of the story, the themes at play here with Jesse and Pat, are managed very well.

Decades later, a story like this is old hat, but in 1975 I can see the material still being fresh enough to male it interesting.  Then again, even now I can see a movie like this being remade, almost shot for shot with practically the same script, and it being one of those serious, talked about movies.  Bradley Cooper and Casey Affleck could remake the hell out of this movie.

I wasn't expecting much from this movie, as I do--or don't--with most of these drive-in ""cult classics"", but I came really appreciating this movie.  Doug Chapin as Pat was completely unlikable, and he seemed to be having a blast in the role.  Ann Noland's Jo Elle seemed to start off as a player, but vanished to the background during the third act, while Benton's Kathy was solid throughout, a somehow well-rounded character despite the fact we know almost nothing about her.  And there's Richard Hatch as Jesse.  Jesse's got a bit of a past, as Pat will tell anyone who listens, especially if her name is Kathy, and some of that comes through in Hatch's performance as Jesse seems like a guy with a spotted history who has found the missing piece to help him find his center.

The soundtrack is full of 70s non-hits, but in this case it's not the popularity of the music, but how it's used, and in this case I found the music worked not only to set each scene but to keep them moving as well.

My only real criticism is that I think the last ten minutes got pretty muddled and the ending, while effective to bring home certain aspects of the characters' personalities--Pat's especially--felt rushed and weak.  But other than a less-than-impressive ending, I really liked this movie.",1380240000,,4785,4.448909299655568
2890058,4,B000SSNH7W,"Okay, the movie is typical 70's drive-in fare in every respect, bad suits, bad dialog, awful soundtrack, etc. This was John Savage early in his career, so we can forgive him. After all, he would go on to appear in plenty  more really bad movies despite his success in ""The Deer Hunter"". What elevates this flick above the usual exploitation/soft-core flick, though, is the fact that two of the most beautiful actresses ever to appear on screen, Anne Saxon and Meredith Baer, have starring roles in this low-budget movie. This was, regrettably, Anne Saxon's only film. What a crime! This woman is absolutely perfect: beautiful face, perfect body, with flawless legs, you name it - beautiful everything. It's hard to believe this woman was never offered more roles. In this one she plays a tramp married to a screenwriter who augments his income by smuggling drugs part time. This out-of-control housewife  amuses herself by endlessly teasing her brother-in-law (John Savage), coming on to him right in front of her husband. Anne steals every scene she is in. In the acting department she looks like a seasoned veteran next to the rank amateur John Savage. As if feasting on Anne's flesh is not enough, her husband's girlfriend, played by the equally drop-dead gorgeous Meredith Baer, appears on the scene and contributes to the festivities. At least Meridith would go on to appear in a couple of more flicks. She's another actress that deserves more recognition. After watching this movie the viewer is left aching for more Anne Saxon and more Meredeth Baer. They are so visually appealing that you cannot take your eyes off of them. Both of them can act, too. To sum up, this is admittedly a cheap movie that seeks to provide the viewer with cheap thrills, but what visually stimulating thrills they are!",1365465600,,1804,4.892156862745098
2890059,2,B000SSNH7W,"Just watched Best Friends and I do see why it was free . I think the concept was a good one, and if the writing and acting was put in better hands I could see it being a good movie. The characters' personalities and relationships were not well defined until well into the movie . It was almost the end when I realized who was who ,and which character was in a relationship with which. I didn't quite understand exactly what was going on with the troubled one , or why Jessie ( yes he is the only male character that I remember his name. Which is really sad since there are only two important ones . ) There were fights I didn't understand ,and seductions that occurred I just feel it wasn't delivered very well . The description on the video is also not very good. It can be summed up kind of like this: Two best friends both at different places in their lives go on a road trip with their significant others. Pat (finally remembered) is looking for adventure and would like his best friend Jessie to go with him. Pat realizing that Jessie wants the simple life , will stop at nothing to get what he wants to separate Jessie and his fiance Kathy. Yeah but that makes it sound more interesting than it actually was , when that ""Tragedy"" happens its like the movie has taken so much time hemming and hawing that the viewer cares ,but also doesn't care what happens to the characters . I found personally that I just wanted to punch Pat in the face ,so he would stop being an aggressive idiot and back the heck off .  The most sympathetic character is Kathy and well she is so blah I really couldn't describe her if I wanted to, it was just so blandly done . I think with a different script writer possibly the same actors(I would change Pat to a less annoying guy) it could be a decent movie . Today's Hollywood would want to make it into a big budget thriller , I don't believe that is necessary just a better script . No explosives , no big names , just  a better script and director .",1356307200,,1985,4.221052631578948
2890060,2,B000SSNH7W,"Two young ladies standing in a field by a road get picked up by Chuck (Alan Long) who is driving a converted bus. The girls consist of Maureen (Gini Eastwood) who is into astrology, Rider Back Tarot cards, getting naked and becoming the High Priestess of Apollo fighting Pazuzu. Never mind that they mix mythologies. Carol (Jill Senter) enjoys smoking pot, flashing, getting naked, and having sex.

AS fate would have it, the bus must take a detour and gets lost and stuck in the Everglades where our threesome can frolic, flashback, and hallucinate clowns with balloons. This is a low budget 70's drive-in movie with very little plot. It is a movie designed for young teens to watch while smoking pot, get aroused and slip into the back seat for some action. I mean seriously, why else would anyone watch it?

He is quickly seduced by the bikini clad wife of Edward, Joanna (Anne Saxon) who showers and skinny dips (nudity). Edward, who is a drug dealer also has a mistress. When Edward is with her, his brother is with his wife. The mob wants Edward to deliver a package, but he has to be in LA to advance his ""movie"" career. Edward has Robert do the delivery cross country and as a bonus tosses in his mistress for the ride ( Meridith Baer, more nudity).",1307923200,2,539,4.4
2890062,1,B000SSNH7W,"""The Sister In Law"" dares you to suffer through it. Transparent and caricatured characters do and say predictable things in this tedious would-be potboiler. The entire production is laced with leaden dialogue like ""Every beast ought to lick his own wounds"", this intimate exchange between two brothers: ""What's the matter?""...""I itch.""...""You gotta' disease?"", and, of course, this turgid chestnut: ""I've had your wife and your mistress, and I threw your heroin into a mountain stream!"" In other words, this was supposed a cool, swinging flick, but like so many other movies from the 70's, is merely painful and trying.

All the characters here are absolutely repulsive, so it's difficult to sympathize with any of them, though we're supposed to be aligned with Bobby, the younger brother (John Savage). Older brother Edward is a mobbed-up irresponsible lout with a hussy for a wife. Here's a tip to the wise: don't mess with your insane cold-blooded mobster brother's wife. Or girlfriend. No good can come of it. In an unintentionally humorous subplot we learn that Edward is really just a confused writer who needs understanding and one good deal to get out of his heroin smuggling ways. You will not be convinced of this, or really anything else, for that matter for two primary reasons: first, the acting is generally awful (especially from Will MacMillan as Edward, who needs to take subtlety lessons from William Shatner); and second, the soundtrack makes watching a challenge as dialogue, music, and effects go from nearly inaudible even with the volume cranked to maximum, to ear-splittingly loud, all within seconds.

The movie has little to recommend it: insipid plot, terrible acting, bad audio, and one of the worst musical scores in film history. The theme song over the lengthy opening credits was so bad I finally had to break down and mute it, and the incidental music is even worse, especially the lengthy ""smuggling in Canada, with subsequent inappropriate aquatic disposal of heroin"" montage set to banjo music. For a film set in very exclusive parts of New York, the banjo montage was jarring at best, grating at worst. On the positive side, the clothes are hilarious, especially the denim leisure suit worn by mob boss ""Benjo"", who, it turns out, has the stupidest goons in organized crime.

Despite press materials (and the title itself) blaming the whole tawdry mess on a brazen woman, everything that goes wrong is really entirely Edward's fault; unfortunately no good deed goes unpunished, which you will discover (without any surprise) at the end of the film. I recommend that you don't watch this piece of garbage if you want to avoid punishment yourself. Ugh.

As an aside, this film is not available in a single DVD edition, but it is available very cheaply on at least two multiple movie DVD sets. If you really want to test your endurance, the DVD sets are a better and more cost effective way to inflict pain on yourself.",1256860800,2,2953,4.959595959595959

2890074,4,B000SSNH7W,"In the past year, I have become fascinated with exploitation films that were popular in the late 60's and throughout the entire 1970's. I was not a teenager until the early 1980's but did manage to catch a few of these classics before drive in theaters disappeared overnight. Back then, the only thing our generation knew was that these films were pretty outdated yet contained just enough nudity to get things rolling in the back seat of the car with a member of the opposite sex. Now that I'm older, I thought it would be fun to revisit these campy films to see if they had any real substance or were just made for the older kids in my neighborhood to use while ""making it"" in the back seat of their cars 5 to 10 years before we did.

Unlike hundreds of exploitation films that were being produced at the time, ""Best Friends"" actually has an interesting plot.  The movie revolves around Jesse and Pat...two men who served in the military together for quite some time and decide to take one last big adventure before heading home to Stockton, California to settle down.  They each have their perspective wive's, Kathy and Jo Ella, with them and rent a top of the line recreational vehicle to make an exiting trip across America before getting married.  Very soon, however, it becomes apparent that Pat has no intentions of settling down while Jessie is quite content with his decision to stick with Kathy.  Pat does not want to lose Jessie as his best friend and tries desperately to talk him out of marrying Kathy so they can travel the country together as free men.  When Pat finally realizes that talking isn't going to work, he begins a series of sinister acts to sabotage the trip and ultimately force the loving couple to break up.  (This is where the fun begins!)

I'm certain that the producers of this film intended to portray Pat as a complete lunatic because his actions quickly go from simple hazing to heinous acts of sheer debauchery.  Rather than seeing Pat as the villain, however, I found myself cheering him on only to see how insanely far he will go in order to get what he wants.  Just when you think he can't sink any lower, he proves you wrong.  While the climactic ending of this picture is not obvious, it does become predicable once the scene begins.  Does Pat ultimately get what he wants?  That depends on how you interpret the last few moments before the credits roll.

The acting in this film is terrible and the only cast member who has any theatrical skills at all is Richard Hatch.  If you expect nudity you will get it, but it doesn't really do anything for a low budget exploitation movie like this one.  As well, the ""military buddy"" aspect of the story line is so incredibly unbelievable that it's a complete joke.  Lastly, ""Best Friends"" contains an awful soundtrack that attempts to tell the story of what you are seeing on the screen in many of the individual scenes.  Having said that, it should not leave you feeling as if you lost 90 minutes of your life.  On the other hand, it might leave you scratching your head.",1479340800,,3059,4.539162112932605

2890115,3,B000SSNH7W,"Amazon Prime Videos has linked my reviews for at least three radically different movies.  What I had to say about each is shown below (apparently being presented for both)

about the movie ""Cindy and Donna"" I indicated ""Hot and Humid"" as the title for my review which said:  Hot and humid porn throughout, entirely of a consensual nature.  Had no idea Amazon was into such things.  Never mind characterization nor plot nor ""learning"".  Just stick with show and tell.  ROTFL.  Other reviews suggested the reviewers were watching ""something else"" and I noticed when this review of ""Cindy and Donna"" appeared under the totally NONconsensual pornographic film ""Pick Up"" that there appear to be linkages being made between reviews and the films about which they were written which were not shown to the reviewers.

about the movie ""Pick Up"" I indicated ""Crocodiles and Mosquitoes"" as the title for my review which said:  The movie presented primarily brutally NONconsesual relationshiups including murder and was thereby an offensive antihetero *political* effort by the producers.  Along with comparatively low quality photography, the ""lost in the everglades"" motif only meant that it ignored the crocodiles mosquitoes and other insect infestations of that environment.  ""Pick Up"" was at best a two star movie.

about the movie ""Best Friends"" I' added ""Prepubescent Retardation"" as the title for my review which said:  The film was written to promote supremacy of prepubescent retardation over hetero relationships.  It demonstrated the kinds of same gender relationship demands from Pat which underlay national homosexual gangs infliction of object rape con dumbs into places of worship of hetero religion to ""protect"" against
hetero relations.  Pat's nonsense ""I don't want to cause any trouble"" contradicted his continuous manipulations to sabotage not only his own with the sexy looking Jo Ellen but Jess' relationship with Kathy including beginnings of an attempted rape.  Turned out Jess himself was corrupted into the same gender orientation, refusing to go home with Kathy so as to pursue Pat who compounds the ownership claim on Jesse by slashing the tires, stealing the ignition key, and smashing a window on the mobile home.  In the darkness, Jesse kills his fiance instead of the attacking Pat.  At best a one star rating.",1467936000,5,2331,5.251351351351351

I suppose this movie belongs to an era of cinematography that is difficult for me to appreciate. If you are into the 70's bell bottomed stiff acting and screechy sounding style this is your movie.

2890136,1,B000SSNH7W,"For some unknown reason, Amazon included my review of Cindy and Donna under this film title.  Pick Up has earned the distinction of actually being worse than that other turkey.  Basic story line is about a guy delivering a bus to a city in Florida who picks up a couple of hitchhikers and they become lost and stuck in a swamp.  Rather than use the phone in the bus to call for help, they actually hang up on the owner whenever he calls trying to find out where they are and offering to send help.  From here on think Deliverance meets The Blue Lagoon but on a much lower budget.  One of the girls has a continual problem with hallucinations, while the other one divides her time between playing with a stuffed animal and running naked through the swamp.  The guy tries to be macho, but never carries it off.  It's too bad Amazon doesn't allow for ""negative stars"" because this movie definitely deserves some. In my opinion, Pick Up is a waste of money to buy, and a waste of time to watch.

Cindy and Donna

Return with us to the days of bell bottom pants and micro-mini  skirts for a coming of age story about a naive high school girl who lives with her alcoholic mother, woman chasing father, step-sister who routinely trades sex for drugs, and a best friend who feels that any girl who isn't bed hopping is completely out of it.  Extremely low budget production with more gratuitous nudity than the story line really calls for---and most of the actresses are really not that special.  This was included in a package of drive-in style movies from Crown International.  Some of the movies in the package are actually entertaining by low-budget, B-movie standards.  At an average price of 25c to 30c per picture, I think I overpaid for this turkey.",1465430400,2,1749,4.528662420382165

2890159,4,B000SSNH7W,I am a huge John Savage fan and this is one of my all time favorites movies of his -- primarily because the soundtrack was penned and performed by John Savage and I think the songs are great.  While the movie is about John's character's sister-in-law there is more going on to the story.  It has a surprising ending I must say.  All in all I liked this movie and have watched it a few times.,1437609600,,391,4.118421052631579
2890160,4,B000SSNH7W,"I liked this 70's thriller. I thought the actors did a good job in portraying their parts - the main ones anyway. Some of the writing was a little nave, but that's how it was back then, wasn't it for B film?**SPOILER ALERT  I mean, the mother letting her son go over to her girlfriend's house and then knowingly admit to her husband that the experience would be good for him to become an independent man.  (lol) Ok, I know , kinda stupid, I know. But the storyline was about (LIke someone else had put it) Norman Bates (Psycho)  stalking Mrs. Robinson (The Graduate), who has her eyes on her neighbor's son who was also his high school teacher. He had just graduated , so that made him fair game in her mind. This young teacher was deserted by her husband and she was definitely sexually frustrated. . Meanwhile the kid's best friend older brother, who is a bit whacko, is totally obsessed with this same woman (the teacher) and stalks her and peeps on her 24/7.  He , of course, gets jealous when she starts spending all her time with her 18 yr. old neighbor.  I would watch it again.",1432425600,2,1085,4.378109452736318

I forgot to watch the movie....it's so bad, on every level, there is no point in beating a dead horse trying to articulate its awfulness.
