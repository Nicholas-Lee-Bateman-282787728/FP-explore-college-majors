1800828,5,B000072007,"Unlike The Patriot which was purely made for propaganda purposes, Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor, follows a much more pragmatic, realistic, and in effect a more truthful account of events during the American War of Independence (1775-1783).  The film brings to the screen two main stories, which are unfolding simultaneously: On the one hand, Continental General Benedict Arnold trying to survive the turmoil of a country at war with itself, and on the other, the War of Independence and its ripple effects on America in the background.  The movie portrays superbly the hardships endured on the battlefield, and the war's effects on society; the corrupt politics, the different attitudes and mentality of English North American colonists during the war i.e. the Loyalists, the Continentals and the Neutrals.

It provides therefore, valuable insight into a very important period of American (and British) History.  Specifically:

We get a taste (though a very light one) of what happened to those caught by the other side...

Moreover, we get to see or hear about, the double-crossing merchants, farmers, and politicians that supported whichever side the wind happened to be blowing in, always in search of profit and personal gain.

The clash between the Loyalist American English and the Continental American English, just like the one between the Continental American English and the British English is fascinating and very well presented throughout the film, but then so is the clash within the Continental side (the undermining, the personality clashes, favoritism, public relations, political connections), between Congress and the Army, as well as the farmers and most importantly the merchants profiteering at the expense of whoever/whichever side etc.

There is also the brave admission (by G. Washington) that the Continentals lack public support, and the important role that Washington played throughout the Revolution in keeping the Continentals ""alive,"" long enough for the French (1778), Spaniards (1779), and Dutch (1780) to enter the war against Great Britain.

In addition, Washington talks about the Indians with contempt and in a patronizing way, underlining the traditional hatred between the lower class North American colonists and the natives (not a surprise considering the content of the Declaration of Independence: ""the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions"").

Moreover, Washington sends Arnold to Philadelphia to protect the Loyalist population from Joseph Reed, the bloodthirsty member of the Continental Congress from Pennsylvania, who wants to exact revenge on all those that do not support the rebellion.  ""One Loyalist shall hang every day for the next 500 days!"" (Execute the owner and then conveniently confiscate their property.)

The film is also excellent in showing that Arnold among others (as Washington also admits) is no ""saint,"" and clearly portrays his corruption through his encounter/business dealings with the merchant to whom he gave a commercial permit in exchange for 50% of his profits/goods.

Therefore, the movie successfully sheds light on aspects of American History that some would rather keep hidden ""under the carpet.""

As a result, Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor, is a daring movie, which shatters more than a few misconceptions, deliberate and not, surrounding attitudes towards the War of Independence, and provides for historical truths, which had been suppressed for long years in the name of ""patriotism.""

The only setback is in relation to Major David Franks; could his religion be more obvious???  What was the point of that?  Why is it that one gets the feeling that this was more the result of ""modern"" influence...

In short, Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor is a movie definitely worth watching, and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection, especially for those interested in History.

Strongly recommended along with Revolution starring Al Pacino.",1113782400,14,4039,5.443910256410256
1800829,4,B000072007,"I have to say that my rating was graded on a curve. I'd say this movie is some where between a high 3 and a low 4. Basically the equivalent of a C+ or B-. My disappointments with the movie was that I felt that it could have been 30 minutes longer and better edited. The story line seemed to jump around a tad. As for Grammer & Quinn? I thought that they both did a great job portraying Washington & Arnold.

I would recommend this DVD for those curious about Arnold. This movie sparked my interest in Arnold when it was first televised and convinced me that Benedict Arnold's treason was more tragic then anything. The DVD also has the A&E Biography of Arnold and is well worth the money.",1080000000,9,688,4.251908396946565
1800830,3,B000072007,"A@E normally produces pretty good stuff.  For some reason they never really got it together on this one.  The subject matter is certainly good, but the chronology of the story seems confused.  For one, this should have been a longer story.  At least another hour could have included and clarified many aspects of Arnold's complex career in the Revolution.  As it stands here many important events are left out, including the battle of Freeman's Farm, as well as his clever deception of the Indians which fouled Berry St. Leger's drive down from Oswego.  These were important aspects of Arnold's career, which should have been included.  The excessive romance scenes with Peggy could have been cut down to make room.  Jeff Daniels would have been better to have as Washington.  He was so good in ""The Crossing"" which was a much better film.  The relationship with Major Andre is grossly over-stated. Aidrian Quinn does an adequate job playing Arnold, but his work is not made easiler by an overall weak support cast, and poor editing.  What is good about the DVD version is that you get the true story of Arnold's life from the A&E Biography thats included.  An overall attractive production with unfortunate short-comings.",1057190400,33,1222,4.936274509803922
1800831,3,B000072007,"""Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor"" is a good film. Even though the editing is a bit messy, and I really wasn't 100% convinced of Kelsey Grammar's portrayal of Washington (Jeff Daniels was better in ""The Crossing""), it had some good battle scenes and decent storytelling. I also wasn't 100% happy with Aidan Quinn as Arnold. But it is worth a look or two! Grade: B-",1042588800,5,368,4.590909090909091
1800832,3,B000072007,"Aidan Quinn is great. Kelsey Grammer makes a loveable General Washington. I think the production does well but needed to be a little grittier. The battle scenes where a little 'lite' but that wasn't the focus of the production. I think an independent body, such as Italy or New Zealand would have handled the story better as the US have already made up their mind. Never the less for what it was and who made it, I think they did a relatively level job handling the issues and the various sides.",1478649600,5,495,4.450549450549451
1800833,4,B000072007,"I was expecting something even cheesier than what I got, especially since I only spent around $6.50 for it. But it was surprisingly good for the story of America's most tragic historical figure and former patriot hero. I didn't really buy Kelsey Grammer as George Washington but Aidan Quinn did a surprisingly good job with some of the melodramatic dialogue (like the language used in scenes of Benedict Arnold courting Peggy Shippen). I mean I actually laughed aloud during some of that, it was so bad (in an unexpectedly entertaining way).

Anyway, I'm fascinated by Benedict Arnold and once you start reading about his life and how things went downhill for him, you can begin to understand how complex his story is.

I think the show TURN on AMC actually does the best job of portraying Arnold accurately and peels away some of the layers of complexity and mystery of why and how Arnold did what he did. I think it boils down to entitlement vs disenfranchisement  maybe that's an oversimplification but at the core of the story, there it is.

I do recommend this for Revolutionary War buffs like me but I don't think that Arnold's story was covered as thoroughly as it could have been but it's not bad.",1475280000,4,1205,4.696682464454977
1800834,5,B000072007,"Interesting study of a brave but deeply troubled man. I feel he was dreadfully mistreated by Congress and other military men of the time. Raised in extreme poverty and abuse, he later craved wealth and position. Understandable, but still no justification for treason. A truly sad story.",1474588800,2,286,5.1063829787234045
1800835,3,B000072007,"A historical dramatization. Factual, for the most part, yet dramatized with creative license. A great military leader promotionally stifled by political intrigue. Add a star if you're not in High School yet.",1467158400,,207,5.5
1800836,3,B000072007,"After watching the (far superior) treatment of Benedict Arnold on the AMC series ""TURN: Washington's Spies"", I went searching for other projects focusing on the relationship between Washington and Arnold. Much like A&E's earlier effort with Jeff Daniels as Washington in ""The Crossing"", all the earnest good intentions in the world cannot overcome a superficial script and low-budget production values.  This movie in particular is oddly edited, interspersing dramatic scenes of dialog with screenshots of pieces of the film set to voiceover narration, like one of those painful high school civics class filmstrip projects of yore.  The editing looks very amateur.  The story does not flow, and low-energy performances from both leads do not inspire.  Kelsey Grammer certainly cuts a fine Washingtonian figure; his height, resonant voice and bearing have gotten him cast as Washington at least twice.  It's all a bit too cardboard St. George, despite the fine costume.  There is a nice scene between Grammer and Quinn where the Supreme Commander cajoles his unhappy protg to stay in uniform, which blends Washington's more human side (appreciation for the ladies) with his heroic self-sacrificial PR--he tells Arnold that he serves the nation without pay by prior arrangement with Congress, and marvels that his men not only stay, but still follow his orders.  Aidan Quinn is, sadly, only adequate as Arnold--this actor is capable of real passion but he's hindered by some lame dialogue that comes across less as acting than recitation.  Compared to his current successor in the role, 6'4"" Owain Yeoman in the AMC project, Quinn lacks the same level of personal charisma or sheer size.  I recommend this more for the Biography feature which accompanies it.  Flora Montgomery (Endeavour) plays Peggy Shippen Arnold, not the actress mentioned in the editorial review.",1466467200,,1865,5.312925170068027

1800838,3,B000072007,"As others have noted, this low-budget movie is far too short and fails to do Arnold justice. (Visit benedictarnold.info for an excellent non-video presentation.) Everything happens in such rapid-fire succession it'll make your head spin; there is no time for the viewer to digest many events or understand their significance. Additionally, while some actual facts are illustrated well, others are unaccountably altered for no apparent reason. Some of the Peggy Shippen scenes are dubious, my favorite being when she's in bed conducting ""urgent business"" with just-turned-turncoat Arnold who states, ""Today, Peggy. Tomorrow, M'lady."" Aidan Quinn is quite good as Arnold, but the one-dimensional Kelsey Grammer as George Washington is very weak. (David Morse in HBO's historical miniseries ""John Adams"" was stellar in the role.) Overall, worth watching, but a disappointment.",1450137600,3,873,5.723076923076923
1800839,4,B000072007,"Succinct, well made historical drama showing the two sides of Benedict Arnold - one of the great heroes of the American Revolution who unfortunately sold out to the British and turned traitor.  Would have liked a little more depth in the story plot and acting, but it is great to see a film highlighting this key period of American history when the Revolution's success was hanging in the balance.  If there had been a bit more battlefield action and story development, it would deserve 5 stars.  A noble attempt nonetheless and an easy film to watch.",1448409600,4,551,4.71875
1800840,3,B000072007,"My class is currently reading, ""The Notorious Benedict Arnold"" by Steve Sheinkin.  I had considered this movie as an additional supplement - and I may still use it, if time permits.  However, it would not be understandable unless the students finish the book first.  Characters are not clearly identified and the plot would be murky if the students hadn't first read the book (I do highly recommend the book I mentioned.)",1442966400,3,421,4.901408450704225

While quickly paced, often to the point of feeling rushed, Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor tells a fascinating story without self-indulgence or period-drama stuffiness. Personally, I would have liked to have seen more details about Arnold's life and past history, but overall the movie was entertaining. Thankfully, A&E's inclusion of the Benedict Arnold episode of Biography makes this package even more appealing: facts and details missing from the movie can be found in this companion piece.

1800851,5,B000072007,Kelsey Grammer was spectacular as Washington.  I am also very glad that the director and producer made many efforts to make this as historically accurate as possible.

1800853,2,B000072007,"It seems to me as though this 2003 A&E drama was an attempt to follow up on the success from their earlier Revolutionary War piece, ""The Crossing.""  Sadly, this one came up short in my opinion.  Don't get me wrong, there are some moments of this film that make it worth sitting through, but they are few and far between, and are easily outweighed by the lackluster and downright campy performances of some of the actors.  For one, Kelsey Grammer's George Washington is a so flat that he more resembles the pale face on Mt. Rushmore than the living, breathing, vibrant commander of the continental army.  One wonders if Mr. Grammer did enough background research on the man he was portraying.  While it is true that Washington's mood could blow hot and cold, for most of this film Grammer portrays him almost deadpan; so much so that when emotions do come through, they at times seem forced (example is the line ""From the highest branch of the tallest tree, we'll hang that son of a b*tch!!!"").  Then there is Flora Montgomery's overly dramatic Peggy Shippen.  At one point she is fawning over the young and foppish John Andre, batting herself with a fan in what can only be described as a near pantomime; at another moment she is prancing around the drawing room, screeching in anger at her tory father while picking up and smashing on the floor conveniently-placed prop flower vases.  And finally there is Aidan Quinn's Benedict Arnold, a man who in life was tortured by his own sense of honor and vanity, but who Quinn manages to twist into a feckless, brazen bully of a man.  When he is not repeating to smaller characters several times over the same phoney challenge to a duel with tomahawks, Quinn's Arnold is sappily exuding sweet nothings to a fawning Peggy and exasperatingly bantering with Grammer's low-key Washington and Stephen Hogan's overly arrogant Joseph Reed. In my opinion, the best part of this film is the short, but nonetheless accurate portrayals of General Horatio Gates and General Sir William Howe, the former of which I felt was given a bad wrap in ""The Crossing.""  Bottom line, if you are on a quest to see as many film adaptations of American historical events, then this is probably worth a view.  But if you are looking for the best films from which to gain an appreciation of our nation's founding era, I would suggest sticking with A&E's ""The Crossing,"" HBO's ""John Adams,"" and--of course--""The Patriot"" with Mel Gibson.",1360886400,2,2452,4.745882352941177
1800854,5,B000072007,"I really enjoyed this depiction of Benedict Arnold's life.  As a history major, I realize the creators of this movie took a few liberties but I do believe this sort of thing always happens when historical figures and events are dramatized.  The best part of it was that it had enough of a secondary story that my wife liked it and we had to pause it often because she would ask me questions about what was going on historically.  Because of this, I think this drama provided a bridge between those who really enjoy history and to those that history isn't something that they would normally watch.",1293148800,,596,4.5514018691588785

They really enjoy it every year.  I explain some of the differences, and they totally understand hollywood anyway, so it's no big deal.  NOW, there is some language and a couple of ""romance"" scenes that would be considered a bit inappropriate for school...so I send a letter out every year to the parents to give permission.  I tell them everything.  Every year every child gets permission.  Let's face it, they are allowed to see worse anyway...but not in the classroom.

1800857,3,B000072007,"'Benedict Arnold - A Question of Honor' is a honest attempt at the very fascinating story of Benedict Arnold but it comes up short. Benedict Arnold's story should be brought to life because it has to be one of the most interesting and tragic stories to come out of the American Revolution. But the A & E version of his story feels too rushed, just not enough detail, and has a lower budget. The battle scenes that depict Arnold's heroic actions for the Americans in the Revolution are rather short and do not have a cast of thousands. There is no real sense of the vastness of the American Revolution. Also valuable time is spent on romantic scenes of Arnold and his wife that would be better used in depicting the machinations of his treason.

The acting is good, but is short of great. Aidan Quinn makes a suitably moody Arnold but does not really bring out what made Arnold such an admired American commander before he became a turncoat. Kelsey Grammer is decent as Washington but falls short of the excellent cinematic performances of Washington done by Barry Bostwick, Jeff Daniels, and David Morse. The key figure besides Arnold in the treason John Andre is portrayed in a less than convincing fashion. I did not really like the actor's performance as Andre and he did not bring the figure alive. Many American officers believed that Andre should not hang and were taken by his unique character but none of this comes through in the film.

I also believe that the film should have been longer and made on a bigger budget because this is such a interesting tale with so many interesting historical characters involved.

The DVD contains a rather good hour-long A & E biography on Arnold that contains nice contributions by many excellent American Revolution historians.

I think viewers would be better served by reading the books 'Benedict Arnold: Patriot and Traitor' by Willard Sterne Randall and 'The Traitor and the Spy: Benedict Arnold and John Andre' by James Thomas Flexner than watching the film. Hopefully one day this story can be done correctly on a larger scale and really show all of the complications of this most fascinating time in American history.",1262131200,6,2171,4.76595744680851

Kelsey Grammar fares best as George Washington but Aidan Quinn is often hopelessly at sea as Benedict Arnold, a bit of a problem when he's the main character. It's an interesting attempt to look at the way the jealousy, snobbery and parsimony of those on his own side led the revolution's most brilliant and successful soldier to become its most notorious traitor, but cinematographer-turned-director Mikael Solomon fails to bring enough life and vitality to the rushed narrative to disguise the bad writing, low budget and poor casting while the accuracy doesn't extend to the production design: Valley Forge looks like a gentleman's summer retreat, Quebec is reduced to a field with a log fence and the American War of Independence something that took place in a few fields and streets in Ireland.
