3818747,5,B001V135U4,Chanda has a very good sense of humor. It is so good to sit back and relax and watch this DVD. She his funny but her humor is 'clean' so your children can watch it too!,1353801600,,168,3.6944444444444446
3818748,1,B001V135U4,Bored out of my mind trying to watch this.  I bought this as a gift.  Should have rented it first because I was embarrassed that I gifted this horrible video.,1343433600,,158,4.233333333333333
3818749,5,B001V135U4,"I recommend this video for anyone who needs to laugh. I think that really would include everyone. I ordered this when our family was going through a trying time and as always, Chonda made us laugh! We take ourselves too seriously...and this is a great way to ""lighten up""! =)

Blessings!",1303344000,2,287,4.627450980392157
3818750,5,B001V135U4,"OK, I'm a man, and I enjoyed some of this too. Good laughs with Chonda Pierce. This DVD was my wife's gift from her girl-friend, and I watched too. Have to admit she had me laughing-out-loud at times, snickering more, also smiling, and catching a few of her man-shots aimed at the gents because most of her live audience was the girls-of all ages.

Chonda is a Christian Phyllis Diller. She makes fun of herself, a fast-paced self-bashing comedienne who often laughs along with her audience, like the late Red Skelton. Leave it to a man to compare Chonda to a male. Sorry girls. She loves to use the line ""In't tha-at pree-cious?"" No topic is sacred, especially women topics, garments, health problems, well...women stuff. But she gets the men in the audience laughing too.

Also look at ""Chonda Pierce Did I Say That Out Loud?""",1292457600,6,828,4.664383561643835
3818751,5,B001V135U4,"Chonda Pierce is stand up comedy aimed for women, clean and wholesome, and never-slow humorous to the end. Is it okay that as a man, I watched WITH my wife? Yes.

Ashland City, Tennessee, takes a lot of ribbing from their hometown star who confesses to one sweat-less armpit and one in menopause. She opens the DVD with the title song ""This ain't Prettyville"" and sets the stage for fast-paced laugh-filled 90-plus minutes of stories and one-liners nonstop till the end.

My wife and I laughed at stories about Pierce's younger years in the small town, things like hitting a chicken on her Moped, followed with the information that in Tennessee, you can eat your road kill.  We laughed aloud and our clap-on/clap-off light changed.

Later Chonda (she says her name comes from parents different love of Chevy's and Honda's) explains that ""inner britches and outer britches in a 'wad', at the same time, can be painful.""  Another clap-on/clap-off lighting change.

""Decaf coffee = communion without the wine,"" and other Christian jokes, make this comedienne a church family friendly favorite.  Pierce does a skit taking the viewers, and live audience, to the office of Pierce Memorial Funeral Home and Taxidermy where confusion has many comic moments. Clap-on/clap-off; clap-on/clap-off; as we belly laugh through the skit.

A highlight is her explanation of a Holy Land trip with a small busload of Tennessee rednecks and finding ""happy meals at St. Peters Fish & Chips beside the Sea of Galilee, which come with Jesus action figures--collect all 12 disciples, and the table...""

Well it's 90 minutes of laughs, and I can't tell 'em like Chonda can, so in Chonda Pierce's own words ""let 'er rip, tator chip.""  Get your copy and in the end you will even get to hear a heartwarming song written and performed by the star, ""You are Beautiful to Me.""

You might get teary from sentiment as well as the comedy.
This DVD is not just for the girls.",1261872000,2,1940,4.848484848484849
3818752,5,B001V135U4,"I've been to several of Chonda's concerts and bought her tapes and books, but this dvd is definitely at the top of my list.  She is extremely honest about her depression and absolutely hysterical with stories from her youth.  She is just about as real as you can get.  This is a wonderful dvd to share with other ladies of a ""certain"" age, although I shared it with my parents who were in stiches laughing.",1255651200,3,406,4.386666666666667

3818792,3,B001V135U4,"Not quite up to par with the usual comedy I am used to with Chonda.  Of course the title is This Ain't Prettyville, and that sort of sums up the dvd.  She pushes the limits a bit on this one.",1396396800,,191,3.75

3818796,5,B001V135U4,"We had a Women's Retreat with a hole in the schedule - this video filled it nicely.  Chonda is personable & timely, and funny besides.  The only complaint is that the audio levels were inconsistent - sometimes too soft & muffled.  But the dvd was hugely popular - I know we'll be using it again with a different group.",1383868800,,318,4.3559322033898304
