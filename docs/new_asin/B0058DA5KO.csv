8461351,3,B0058DA5KO,"I am disappointed not in the content of this disc but the fact that when I bought a DVD I thought I was going to watch ""how"" to can and preserve food. I wanted to see the physical ""how-to"".  This disc contains 30 PDF files that I have to sit in front of the computer to read.  ONLY PLAYS ON YOUR COMPUTER NOT ON TV.  No doubt that it contains very useful information - why didn't they just publish this as a book? My own fault that I didn't read the fine print.",1326067200,6,461,3.935483870967742
8461352,5,B0058DA5KO,"Our great-grandparents certainly knew how to can. Sadly, the art has been lost as technology improves and just-in-time inventory systems make whatever we need available at the store today. But is the economy getting better or worse? Are government restrictions on private gardens getting removed or increased? (How DARE them do that!) Are you CERTAIN your family has enough food to weather some food distribution problems that can easily happen in times of disaster, attacks, or an economic meltdown???

We're not convinced we have enough and we're not convinced the store shelves will always stay stocked. So we are taking some of the responsibility on ourselves and growing a garden and canning our own produce. It turns out that it's not only easy it saves us a ton of money! This video, Home Canning & Food Preservation Secrets, was a GOLDMINE for us because it made everything SIMPLE SIMPLE SIMPLE!

All questions we had were eventually answered and this is must-have for anyone interested in preserving food, especially if you want to preserve the healthy food you and your family can grow in your own garden.",1311638400,,1115,4.989247311827957
