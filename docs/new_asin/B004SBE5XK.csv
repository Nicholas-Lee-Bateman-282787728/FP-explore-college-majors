4462244,4,B004SBE5XK,"Enjoyed this. I love that you can see her passion for watercolour and it puts you in the mood to paint. I would've liked it a bit more in depth (see one painting from start to finish), but for what it was i really enjoyed it! I would recommend",1405814400,,243,3.979591836734694
4462245,5,B004SBE5XK,"Both her book and her DVD are breathtaking.  She will loosen up your watercolors!  It is amazing watching her work and I am learning so much.  As she can see, what she does with roosters is mindboggling!  And it is not too difficult.  She encourages you to not be so constricted.  Try it - your painting won't be the same.",1405036800,2,322,4.283333333333333
4462246,5,B004SBE5XK,"Jean Haines is my new favorite artist ... I have learned so much from watching this DVD.  All the projects I have tried using her techniques have tuned out so well, I have amazed myself.  I have bought her other DVD and two books she has written and I use all of them.  Jean's style will certainly help you to loosen up as an artist.  I highly recommend this DVD.  Fabulous!",1403740800,,374,4.211267605633803
4462247,1,B004SBE5XK,"I was quickly disappointed by the lack of any worthwhile information.  The author is very enamored with watercolor and says how wonderful everything is that watercolor does.  However she provides very little information that has any substantive value.  I don't understand her success.  I guess it takes money to make money.

So don't waste yours on this DVD.",1402531200,2,358,5.103448275862069
4462248,5,B004SBE5XK,"I used to be a very tight, precise, perfectionist type of painter, very detailed.. But I've been trying to loosen up and relax and enjoy what the water can do.. I still have a long way to go but learned alot from this dvd. I have one of her books also and I just love the loose images she paints. Just enough to tell the story. One of the better dvd's I have purchased.",1393286400,35,369,4.0
4462249,5,B004SBE5XK,A fabulous DVD! Jean Haines singular style makes you want to do it the minute you see it. Really inspiring and practical. Worth the buy!!!,1389052800,16,138,4.56
4462250,5,B004SBE5XK,Enjoyed her demonstrations.  Very good instructional video for painting in Jean Haines style.  Would highly recommend it if you are interested in watercolor painting and like her style of painting.  I also have her book and this is a nice addition.,1388707200,21,248,5.0
4462251,5,B004SBE5XK,"This is just lovely. Well done video. Gives you lots to think about. Good camera work. I really love the woman~ she clearly is passionate about watercolor, color and art. Lots of studying in various parts of the world including China. It shows! This is a very generous video with materials and techniques. Personally, I am SO very grateful to find a colorful loose style. What fun!!",1382400000,29,382,4.7164179104477615
4462252,5,B004SBE5XK,"Haines gives a series of demonstrations of her techniques in controlling water color. They teach how to have fun, yet not loose control. The demos build nicely from one to another. Very encouraging towards play that leads to loose structures and visual interest. Clear and well-edited material.",1378598400,28,294,5.276595744680851
4462253,3,B004SBE5XK,"I love the artist's style and she has encouraged me to paint without drawing, which seems so freeing. But, I was very disappointed that none (not one) of the demos show how to complete a painting. She takes the paintings to a certain point, which are very much unfinished, and I am left wondering ""how to you manage to get from that point to the beautiful finished painting?"". A little disappointing, but it probably takes too long to show on the DVD - still, with some editing, I'd imagine that the DVD could be produced in such a manner.",1444089600,7,539,4.454545454545454
4462254,5,B004SBE5XK,This is a beautiful book that introduced me to a new technique with watercolor.  I cannot say enough good things about Jean Haines as both an artist and a teacher. She has taught me a new way of using watercolors that I now use every day.,1441497600,,238,4.173913043478261
4462255,5,B004SBE5XK,Love the book.  Great teaching technique.  More please!,1441411200,,55,5.75

4462257,5,B004SBE5XK,Beautiful textures and wonderful ideas for watercolor painting I will use.,1439942400,,74,5.818181818181818
4462258,2,B004SBE5XK,"The artist do not show how to paint the photo all the way through, she fast forwards it till the end, does not explain colors she is using. I would recommend it.",1439424000,,161,4.0625
4462259,5,B004SBE5XK,"Inspiring!  This is a treasure for artists who want to find sheer joy  in Watercolor.  Whether one is starting to paint  or have studied for years this is an eye opening exciting door to color, freedom discipline and inspiration in watercolor.  I have never enjoyed painting more .  Thank you Jean for your wonderful approach to creativity.  You are a gift!",1434326400,,357,4.754098360655738
4462260,5,B004SBE5XK,Great DVD of a loose style of watercolor painting.  Cannot wait to try it.  Visual learning is great because it is like taking a class.  If you are a visual learner this is the way to go.,1433203200,,187,4.0
4462261,5,B004SBE5XK,Excellent teaching of a new (to me) way of painting.,1429056000,,52,4.3
4462262,5,B004SBE5XK,"Love her painting style...would have liked a little more instruction for each step, but overall, one of the best WC dvd's I've viewed.",1428019200,,134,4.869565217391305
4462263,5,B004SBE5XK,"This DVD is for advanced watercolor artists.  Jean Haines has a different style of painting like she says a loose brush style.
If you like to define everything on your paper, then Jeans style is not for you.  Illusory pictures is what Jean Haines paints.
I take Jean Haines and Lain Zhen and combined the two together and come up with my own style.
Happy painting Verna Baker.",1422316800,15,376,4.514705882352941
4462264,5,B004SBE5XK,This DVD was all I was hoping it would be. Much info and many demos. Just enjoyable to watch!,1420329600,,93,3.9473684210526314
4462265,3,B004SBE5XK,A little disappointed with the DVD. Nine of the demos are ever completed. Too much time spent on the rooster ' s head yet never finished and never saw the rest if the rooster. Also would like to see the travel of the brush from paint to water to paper. Is any excess water ever removed. But... I love the artist. Just need more help.,1419292800,4,333,4.138461538461539
4462266,4,B004SBE5XK,"Excellent.

The DVD is done professionally with close ups to the point you can see the texture in the watercolor paper and the bristles on the brushes as she glides them across the paper

She is obviously completely enamored with watercolor paints.  The way she works is  approachable and gentle. She uses A LOT of water and still controls the paint beautifully. She lets the watercolor blend on its own without interfering or overworking it.

Her demonstrations are gestural, which, for me, widens the possibilities and encourages painting with feeling and intuition. It is a particular way of ""seeing"". I especially loved it when she painted negative space.  That is a technique I find interesting and I wish to explore further.

I appreciated her advice to paint what has meaning to us personally.  She painted dogs that she knows from a photo that she took herself. Doing so put her own spirit into the work because it came from her own experience.

I loved it all. Very relaxing and gentle (I fell asleep halfway through :-))

Her painting has movement and interest.  She is an accomplished artist.

The one thing that started to grate on me is that she often compares her style to ""other"" Watercolorists in a way that seemed a bit snobby.  I know her intention is to encourage us to put our own feelings and experience into our work to be unique but there are respectful ways to compare yourself to others that is not offensive.",1418947200,3,1434,4.710843373493976
4462267,4,B004SBE5XK,"Great DVD.  I wish it would go into more depth on how to finish the first paintings in Section 1; however, she is very good at explaining the portions she is painting throughout the demonstrations.  She is a lovely person and encourages painters throughout her DVD.  Encouragement is what all student painters need instead of an instructor coming off as a 'born talent' that nobody could possibly measure up to.  It takes a lot of practice to learn to paint watercolor and Jean Haines doesn't make you feel that you could never ""get it.""  She explains things step by step and doesn't purposely leave out portions to set you up for failure.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone that would like to learn to paint loose watercolor.",1417996800,19,729,4.65625
4462268,5,B004SBE5XK,Jean Haines is a wonderful artist and is very clear in her instructions.,1415145600,,72,4.615384615384615
4462269,5,B004SBE5XK,Best to watch with painting area ready because This makes one itch to paint!,1411862400,,76,4.5
4462270,5,B004SBE5XK,Real help to get exciting relaxed approach to fun watercolor painting.,1409961600,,70,5.454545454545454
4462271,5,B004SBE5XK,"This book is beautiful. Jean discusses how she does her watercolors and soft edges. She will walk you through multiple exercises for beautiful paintings including the rooster on the cover.

I have been a painter for quite a while now but have always struggled with the loose style. This has really helped, but I also purchased her DVD of the same title. After watching the DVD it is nice to refer to her lessons in the book. I also travel and this book goes with me.

This is not a fluff review. This is by far one of my favorite watercolor books and I have over 70 painting books in my library. So if you are hesitant, don't be!

A fellow artist friend of mine who is new to watercolor also purchased the video and she was able to do the rooster on her first try. You don't need to be experienced to use this book, but for those of you who are artists, I know that you will take away something positive from this book.",1407024000,29,919,4.2102272727272725

8439622,5,B004SBE5XK,Fantastic book. I am an oil painter and I got this for my mom who is a water color painter. I ended up getting one for myself because it gave me ideas on how to differentiate my own work.,1518739200,,187,3.8205128205128207
