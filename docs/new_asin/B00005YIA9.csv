8500339,5,B00005YIA9,"I have sought out music in Spanish for my kids to listen to in stores and libraries over the last few years. This set is my favorite. It's not too cutesy or pedagogical. What you get is two cassettes of the music, one video, and a booklet with the words to the songs written in Spanish and English. All the songs are sung in Spanish. There is no English on these cassettes or on the video. There is no story or narrator. Just songs, and the songs are great. I guess I would call most of them folk songs and traditional children's songs. I don't think that any of them were religious. There is no attempt made to wow your kids with the latest cool sounds--no rap,hip-hop, or rock and roll. No wacky sound-effects (thank goodness). There are songs about airplanes, trains, frogs, when will I see my love again, rice pudding, clouds, a man selling oranges, my noisy next-door neighbor who is learning to play the violin...:-)

 The voices are good, the music is simple, and mostly rather lively. And by listening often, and following with the words once in a while, you really will pick up a lot of vocabulary, not to mention learning how to listen and pick out the words, inflection, rhythms... I use this as a supplement to a more formal homeschooling Spanish program.

 What don't I like about this set? I don't care about the video. I am not into providing babies with ""stimulation"" for their brains. I think real life is stimulating enough and I am not trying to make any of my babies into science projects, baby Mozarts, or what have you. I wish I could just buy this music without the video. I also wish that I could buy it on a CD or two instead of on cassette. Finally, I wish that they gave us some background information on this music since I have enjoyed it. It would be nice to know what country it came from, for example.

 Nevertheless, you can see that I still gave it five stars. This nice collection of songs is worth it.",1091577600,6,1936,4.393854748603352
