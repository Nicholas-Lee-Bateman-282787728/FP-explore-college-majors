8240652,5,B00116AC28,"U.K always seems to have the best releases and this is another fine example of a Region 2 set that may never be available in the U.S due to copyright issues. Each disc has lots of extras. It seems everything is included on each disc so the fans can fully  enjoy each film. They put so many extras on each disc they ran out of room so there is a 5th disc that has even more material on it. If you a  true Phantasm fan this is worth the high price because there is information here that is not available anywhere else, all housed in a very cool looking sphere. The only negatives are the high price because it is out of print and the discs are PAL format so you will need an all region player, which you can order from Amazon.  Until these are all released on Blu Ray this is the best format for Phantasm fans but even then I doubt they will be housed in a sphere.",1432944000,2,862,4.029239766081871
8240653,3,B00116AC28,"I love the phantasm movies, I bought the DVD's as New and It came with scratches on one of the DVD's. The Collectors Edition box that the Sphere came in was torn & looked like it was all taped back up. I was not happy with the shape it came in.",1414972800,,244,3.803921568627451
8240654,5,B00116AC28,i didn't know they made the spere that is neat. here in usa the foremat differs as night and makes dvd's worthless but its so cool as a novelty. phantasm #2 was sold in us years ago. its sold also on a 2 dvd pack with 4 movies title [cult horror collection] 1st..funhouse.  2nd..phantasm. 3rd..Sssssss. 4th..the serpant and the rainbow. that is very cool.,1395014400,,355,4.546875
8240655,4,B00116AC28,"This particular one wasn't the sphere but I was told that before the transaction when through. However, box set I did get was in great condition and the discs had no cosmetic problems at all. Phantasm is always a good classic to throw in, I just wish they would finish the 5th one. Doesn't look like that is going to happen either.",1356998400,2,331,4.354838709677419
8240656,5,B00116AC28,"So, for about EVER, I wanted all the Phantasms on DVD, but not in this country of ours!  So, ages ago, has been over 3.5 years, I bought the silver ball box set from the Anchor Bay UK Website, ([...]), and with a regionless dvd player, I got to enjoy all the films in clean, crisp letterbox!  It's in Region 2...UK.  The ones selling here, used, are like mine.  They're gorgeous and clean.  For years, I only had VHS copies, and they looked horrific.  This release is in original letterbox ratio, enhanced for 16X9 TVs.

I think I paid like 80-90 bucks for the box set and the ball, but apparently, its no longer in print if it's going for 125 now, used.  Still is worth it, though.  I can assume, with almost certainty, that America will never see this type of box set in a silver ball package.  Anchor Bay is good about their releases, and if it didn't enter our market after all this time, I am beginning to wonder if we'll see Phantasm 2 in the US on DVD.  Somebody must be holding everything up with copyright.

Anchor Bay is pretty awesome, I think.  Some don't think as I, but everybody can't be happy at once.",1204848000,32,1117,4.287081339712919
