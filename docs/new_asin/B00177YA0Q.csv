3168747,2,B00177YA0Q,"It turns out Meg Ryan is still acting in movies and for this movie she drags Antonio Banderas down. Banderas is delightful as a charming con artist who falls in love with Ryan, who has recently made a fortune on stocks and lost a ton of weight (a very unimaginative fatsuit). The movie is not only degrading to fat women but it also makes fun of just about anyone else. That wouldn't be problematic if it was done well, but unfortunately it is not. There are moments that are still funny and the actors make the best of the script, but for a movie with a lot of promise, this movie fails miserably. Additionally, it's a shame than Colin Hanks (Tom's son) and Selma Blair are underused.",1210464000,6,685,4.4015748031496065

3168800,2,B00177YA0Q,"Awful.  The first half of the movie was done in short little clips.  It was like something I would have shot on my own on my phone. It got worse from that point on.  Not any part of the movie was realistic at all. I've never seen Meg Ryan act so poorly.  Almost every scene was over acted on her part.  At dinner she was acting drunk the second they handed her a drink and she hadn't even put it to your mouth yet.  And speaking of her mouth... what in the world was that all about?  They had her plastered with bright red lipstick smeared on making her look like the Joker in Batman.  Seriously what was that all about?

If you have nothing at all to do and it's raining outside and  your entire house is clean... I still say you should find something else to do rather than watch this movie.  It was just bad.",1459468800,2,811,4.069620253164557

I love Antonio Banderas and Meg Ryan, but this movie took forever to meet entertainment quality.  We only kept watching because we thought ""It has to get better !""  In the end... Antonio pulls it off and the story does have interest.  Perhaps we should blame the director and the story.  It needed to be reviewed and redone before it hit the screen and then video world.",1450828800,,467,4.435294117647059

3168824,4,B00177YA0Q,"My Moms New Boyfriend centers around how both the life of a woman and her son change in a span of just a few years.  Henry Durand (Colin Hanks) eventually joins the FBI and becomes shocked when he does not recognize his mother Martha Durand (Meg Ryan) who completely changed on both the outside as well as the inside once she lost a significant amount of weight.  With her thinner body and increased self-confidence, Martha Duran decides to now call herself Marty and has an improved outlook on life.  Marty (Meg Ryan) is enjoying considerable good luck in good fortune in her love life via attracting multiple suitors (including an Italian chef and a young college student) since losing weight. Marty is even enjoying an auspicious/affluent lifestyle in her financial life due to shrewd investments she made with her money in the stock market.  Both her son Henry Durand and his fiance Emily Lott (Selma Blair) are fascinated by Martys new outlook. However, Henry Durand becomes concerned for his mother once Tommy Lucero (Antonio Banderas) enters her life.  Both Marty and Tommy Lucero mutually fall in love with each other, but Martys son Henry does have reason to be concerned for his mother.  One scriptwriting element that I enjoy about the film My Moms New Boyfriend is that it captures a characters metamorphosis as she gains a thinner body and a different outlook on life (which is a big deal to me because movies featuring women who have successfully lost weight are rare for understandable reasons around body costumes, makeup, screenwriting elements etc.). I also enjoyed how the scriptwriting in My Moms New Boyfriend captured how the characters in Martys life acted in regards to her weight loss (Martys son Henry, Henrys fiance Emily, and Martys boyfriend Tommy upon seeing some of her photos before she lost the weight and manifested her thin body).  My Moms New Boyfriend is a movie also suitable for those who enjoy comedy films that take a humor type of spin on the FBI/CIA.",1445558400,2,1993,4.8613569321533925

3168853,5,B00177YA0Q,"Really sweet, pure Meg Ryan!  She can pull off sexy wit better than anyone. Antonio Banderas was really funny and turned in a warm and funny performance and the young Hanks is up and coming. Selma I would have liked to see pack more punch but she did have a supporting role and she supported everyone else to turn in great performance. Kuddos to Selma for not stealing the scenes and playing her role.

Funny twist and turn in the light plot but after the last bloody horror show I saw turned out in the Hollywood blood and guts for nickels I thought I would feed my brain some love and wit rather than have my subconscious filled with terror. Somehow that doesn't seem healthy. It's like feeding my body from the trash can. Why would I do that to my mind?

I haven't yet seen Angelina's and Antonio's film but the chemistry here was excellent. I was rather surprised at how much chemistry these two had together on screen. Would be great to see them turn it up off screen.

So sorry to segue so much. This is a lovely little RomCom for a fabulous little ""pick-me-up."" It won't win any awards but that wasn't what it was filmed to accomplish.",1425772800,3,1142,4.372641509433962

3168885,2,B00177YA0Q,"There was a time when Meg Ryan was America's sweetheart on film. After seeing her in this movie with her Botox lips and smile that looks like the Joker, I almost want to cry.  When the movie first started, I thought it was very interesting that the camera didn't focus upon her face for a very long periods of time.  Now I know why.  Even with makeup, I want to grab her by the shoulders and cry ""why?""

Looking beyond the physical changes to her as a woman, I cannot say that this movie had very many redeeming qualities rather than being a mildly entertaining romantic comedy. From a fat woman with low self-esteem, who suddenly comes to life after someones drops a quarter in her cup of coffee while she's sitting on the floor, she turns into a skinny rail with protruding ribs (the new look of beauty).  Her son who hasn't seen his mother in three years comes home to find a changed body and a mother who is gone off the deep end.  Rather than finding herself through traveling the world and studying various religions, I thought she lost herself instead.

Enters Antonio Banderas, who we are led to believe is the ""bad boy"" in the movie.  They meet and fall in love playing itsy-bitsy spider in the bedroom. Well, I'd play anything in bed with Tony myself, but it's not exactly the most romantic scene of the movie.  He falls in love, she falls in love, and everyone has a secret.  Her son ends up investigating him as a thief, and the movie ends that's he's really not that bad boy after all.  Ah, love.  They kiss and live happily ever after.

I almost want to apologize for my lack in liking the movie.  Instead, the only message I came away with was watch out for plastic surgery. It can kill a career.",1342224000,,1711,4.356466876971608

3168887,3,B00177YA0Q,"This flick begins with the promise of more laughs to come (particularly from Meg Ryan), but as soon as Colin Hanks' character becomes the central point, it goes downhill quickly and no one can save it. The evolution of the story is painfully predictable. And good grief! Does Meg Ryan have no honest friends to tell her she's gone too far in the pursuit of false youth? Her face has been distorted by Botox, collagen, and bad face-lifts. The uncomplimentary lighting, poor makeup and too much hair made matters worse. If it weren't for her unique mannerisms and quirkiness, it would have been almost difficult to recognize her. No wonder this film went straight to video! Antonio Banderas may be worth a comedic turn, but this one isn't it (and why he got top billing is beyond me). Selma Blair was woefully underused and could have provided a better balance to the rest of the cast. There is one actor, though, who unintentionally steals the comedy: Enrico Colantoni.

What's wrong with Hollywood not utilizing a great comedic actor like her?  I've heard several female actors say Hollywood loses interest in them when they age but come on, this is ridiculous.  A woman really starts getting interesting and comes into her own beauty after 40 in my opinion.  Okay, I'm off my soapbox.  This comedy made me laugh out loud and I could really identify with Meg's character who went from over two hundred pounds to fit and healthy and really started living her life fully. Antonio Banderas is wonderful as always as her new boyfriend who may or may not be an international art thief.  All of the supporting cast was fabulous too.  Enrico, the Italian chef whom Marti (Meg's character) broke up with was hilarious as the spurned lover who just can't let go.",1317772800,14,925,4.464285714285714

Think of True Lies crossed with .... Cinderella?  Spies, danger, conflicted loyalties, ugly duckings transformed into swans, laughs, and true love coming to those who wait.  Very sweet in the end.  Colin Hanks (Tom's boy, as we would say down here) was excellent.  Meg Ryan's cheek implants needed a little more time to settle, I think, but she is still beautiful.  Banderas is still Banderas.

PLOT - To make this a long story short, BANDERAS meets RYAN by accident and it so happens that MEG'S son is an FBI Agent. MEG'S son finds out that BANDERAS is an ART THIEF so the most of the movie is based on MEG'S son chasing after BANDERAS. In the end BANDERAS ends up working as an undercovered CIA agent catching the real art thiefs.

3168895,2,B00177YA0Q,"Colin Hanks is an FBI agent Henry Durand, whose beautiful mother Martha (Meg Ryan) is dating a handsome and mysterious guy named Tommy (Antonio Banderas). To his greater surprise, Henry discovers that his mom's new boyfriend is in fact an international art thief his FBI office is after. Things get more complicated when Henry has to spy on his own mother, and Henry's fiance Emily (Selma Blair) working for FBI gets involved in his mission.

Though I do not think ""My Mom's New Boyfriend"" is a terrible film as some reviewers say, it is not as funny or entertaining as it should be. The film written and directed by George Gallo has certainly a mildly interesting (though implausible) story, but it never knows how to make the most of it. The comic scenes often look clumsy, poorly executed, and not thought out well, largely relying on Colin Hank's embarrassed face. The two leads lack chemistry and Salma Blair's character has little to do.

But what happened to Meg Ryan's career? Why did she accept doing this? The idea of Meg Ryan in fat suit is already questionable to begin with, but Martha she plays here is not really a likable character. This is especially so when she overacts, playing a slightly selfish person not in an enjoyable way, and the film's wacky humor means pointless car action (with Meg Ryan yelling repeatedly) and a drunk Italian chef serenading on the front lawn.",1260662400,2,1392,4.74793388429752

Yes.  I want to see my favorite stars in roles as they age.  It gives me hope seeing older people shine in the craft they do so well.

Because charm and wit doesn't dull just because you get wrinkles in your face and pains in your body.  The human spirit lives on and on.  And that aging stars can perform so well is an underlying message when you put these time-tested stars in a movie making vehicle.

Actually, the title of this show makes it sound like Meg Ryan is going to be frumpy.  She was not.  She was the shining star and that made the movie ever more surprising.",1254182400,2,795,4.19205298013245

Have you noticed that people who have had a nasty health scare or survived a brush with death on the highway often feel compelled in the immediate aftermath to alert others so they can avert falling into similar danger? That's a little like how I feel this morning. There is nothing positive I can say about Homeland Security. It's painfully slow and stilted, the acting is wooden, the plot line is inane and just about every single joke falls horribly flat. I don't think there's any single area of culpability: it's a combination of weak concept plus failures in the script, direction and editing room. I had always considered Banderas and Ryan to be reasonably talented actors - at the very least endowed with a certain screen presence - so it was something of a surprise to see a movie they star in turn out to be so staggeringly awful. It was actually embarrassing to watch - and who wants to spend 90 minutes cringing through a movie? In supporting roles, Colin Hanks may turn out to be a fine actor one day, but he strikes out looking in his first major appearance. Selma Blair's performance was not bad at all, though I doubt she'll be highlighting this movie on her career resume in the years ahead. My recommendation ... Homeland Security would make a perfect Christmas or birthday gift for someone you particularly dislike.",1223769600,,1573,4.702898550724638

What a shameful waste of talent this was.  I felt so bad, watching a pretty good actor embarrass himself.  As for Meg Ryan, she was just terrible and looked like she had had a few too many Botox treatments or something.  Not only did her face look like plastic, but her character (Marty) was the dictionary definition of obnoxious.  She played every scene like a complete bubble head, being as immature as possible.  I guess this was meant to demonstrate what a 'free spirit' she had become after losing all that weight.  The FBI guys were a joke and the final resolution was so hokey to be just stupid.  Really, would one agency send out one maverick agent into the jurisdiciton of another agency without backup or even letting the other agency know what is going on?  A hint maybe?  Colin Hanks did a good job of looking confused I guess, but had not much of a script to work with.  Selma Blair, as lots of other reviews have pointed out was very much under used.  This looked like a film where some stars needed a quick pay check, did their parts and got out.  Certainly this is one of the worst 'romantic comedies' ever made.  It wasn't funny, the plot was stupid and the actors pretty much mailed it in.  If you have to see this one, rent it.

So there's plenty of conflict in the plot, and it makes for interesting watching.  It's a good movie, light and amusing, and worth watching.  It's also buy-worthy, in the sense that you might see it again when you're looking for some light entertainment.

I agree with other reviewers that the plot was really unbelievable but that is OK if the movie is entertaining.  Unfortunately, this one was not.  It dragged and I actually grabbed my laptop to play some mindless solitaire while watching the second half of the movie.  Even the ""twist"" ending was obvious throughout.

It's kind of scary when Meg Ryan smiles (her face is a disaster, but her lips are freaky) but other than that she looks good and can still pull off her Megness like no one else. There are a couple scenes that are pure Meg. When Antonio is fawning over how hot she looks, she responds ""Yeah! I know!"" Only Meg could do that and not make everybody sick. In another scene she gets mad at him and throws a fit, punching and screaming into the air. Antonio just watches until its over and is speechless (so was I) but for a genuinely soft-spoken ""Wow."" It was nice to see those scenes. Meg's still got it and Antonia doesn't seem like he's going to lose it any time soon.

It was a pleasant surprise to see how good Antonio looks. Maybe I just haven't seen him in a while. I've always liked him in comedies. If you like Antonio, you'll love the scene where he ends up with each hand in a glass of water (or white wine?). Antonio could charm the socks off ... I dunno, somebody who really needed their socks.

That's what these kinds of movies are all about, right? How good do our stars look? How much we enjoy seeing our favorite celebrities prance about ... acting.

There's a light twist at the end so everybody can be happy. Upon reflection it explained a few unanswered hmmmm's from previous scenes but I didn't see it coming because I wasn't expecting it; I didn't need it and I had forgotten about those scenes because this isn't a movie you keep score on.

1. Marty Durand (Meg Ryan) goes from fat to phat while her son Henry (Colin Hanks) is away learning spy stuff with the FBI
2. Henry returns to the nest, to find Mom ruling the roost with an adoring flock
3. He isn't pleased when she's knocked off her feet by charming smoothie Tommy (Antonio Banderas)
4. He's even more unhappy with his next FBI assignment
5. Romantic comedy turns into unbelievably bad caper

Meg Ryan rarely shows the sparkle of her previous starring roles, while Colin Hanks is basically boring. Selma Blair is so underutilized you could say she's unused, and Antonio Banderas is .... well, just Banderas.

This is intended to be a frothy light comedy caper, but instead of being bubbly and entertaining, it sinks like a lead weight. Even if you suspend disbelief and forgive the plot, there's just not enough to make it worth your while.

Seeing that I like both Meg Ryan and Selma Blair, I'll give this one an extra star, and recommend that you go watch some of their other movies instead.

3168915,3,B00177YA0Q,"A romantic, comedy caper, with an outstanding cast, that won't raise any IQ points but will make you giggle a few times.  Ryan (Marty) is a little over the top and, totally unbelievable, with her mid-life makeover and her extreme personality change, but it made for fun.  With a lovelorn Italian Chef and a youngster on a Harley, as her romantic discards, Banderas (Tommy) makes a more suitable catch. Or does he?  Is he about to be the mastermind behind one of the biggest art thefts in history?  Will he wind up doing prison time like her son's (Colin Hanks) father.  Can Marty be THAT unlucky in love?  Is it all just a reflection of her pattern of being attracted to ""bad boys""? Maybe she needs therapy!

Colin Hanks performance stands out as the OCD type of FBI Field Agent, who can't adapt to his mom's metamorphosis.  Banderas and Ryan did not have very good chemistry together.  They both seemed to be too focused on developing their own roles and physical appearances for the sake of the camera. Banderas walked around rather stiff and as though he were from a wax museum, but still painfully attractive.  Meg was a bit of a mess, with stringy, bed-head hair that begged to be tamed and is no longer one of her positive trademarks. However, it was great to see her acting again.  I mean...who doesn't love Meg. It would be good to see her stretch her acting into deeper, more meaningful roles, at this mid-life crossroad.

Banderas is delightful as a charming con artist who falls in love with Ryan, who has recently made a fortune on stocks and lost a ton of weight (a very unimaginative fatsuit). The movie is not only degrading to fat women but it also makes fun of just about anyone else. That wouldn't be problematic if it was done well, but unfortunately it is not. There are moments that are still funny and the actors make the best of the script, but for a movie with a lot of promise, this movie fails miserably.

At dinner she was acting drunk the second they handed her a drink and she hadn't even put it to your mouth yet.  And speaking of her mouth... what in the world was that all about?  They had her plastered with bright red lipstick smeared on making her look like the Joker in Batman.  Seriously what was that all about?

3403321,4,B00177YA0Q,"My Moms New Boyfriend centers around how both the life of a woman and her son change in a span of just a few years.  Henry Durand (Colin Hanks) eventually joins the FBI and becomes shocked when he does not recognize his mother Martha Durand (Meg Ryan) who completely changed on both the outside as well as the inside once she lost a significant amount of weight.  With her thinner body and increased self-confidence, Martha Duran decides to now call herself Marty and has an improved outlook on life.  Marty (Meg Ryan) is enjoying considerable good luck in good fortune in her love life via attracting multiple suitors (including an Italian chef and a young college student) since losing weight. Marty is even enjoying an auspicious/affluent lifestyle in her financial life due to shrewd investments she made with her money in the stock market.  Both her son Henry Durand and his fiance Emily Lott (Selma Blair) are fascinated by Martys new outlook. However, Henry Durand becomes concerned for his mother once Tommy Lucero (Antonio Banderas) enters her life.  Both Marty and Tommy Lucero mutually fall in love with each other, but Martys son Henry does have reason to be concerned for his mother.  One scriptwriting element that I enjoy about the film My Moms New Boyfriend is that it captures a characters metamorphosis as she gains a thinner body and a different outlook on life (which is a big deal to me because movies featuring women who have successfully lost weight are rare for understandable reasons around body costumes, makeup, screenwriting elements etc.). I also enjoyed how the scriptwriting in My Moms New Boyfriend captured how the characters in Martys life acted in regards to her weight loss (Martys son Henry, Henrys fiance Emily, and Martys boyfriend Tommy upon seeing some of her photos before she lost the weight and manifested her thin body).  My Moms New Boyfriend is a movie also suitable for those who enjoy comedy films that take a humor type of spin on the FBI/CIA.",1445558400,2,1993,4.8613569321533925

Antonio Banderas was really funny and turned in a warm and funny performance and the young Hanks is up and coming. Selma I would have liked to see pack more punch but she did have a supporting role and she supported everyone else to turn in great performance. Kuddos to Selma for not stealing the scenes and playing her role.

Funny twist and turn in the light plot but after the last bloody horror show I saw turned out in the Hollywood blood and guts for nickels I thought I would feed my brain some love and wit rather than have my subconscious filled with terror. Somehow that doesn't seem healthy. It's like feeding my body from the trash can. Why would I do that to my mind?

I haven't yet seen Angelina's and Antonio's film but the chemistry here was excellent. I was rather surprised at how much chemistry these two had together on screen. Would be great to see them turn it up off screen.

3403382,2,B00177YA0Q,"There was a time when Meg Ryan was America's sweetheart on film. After seeing her in this movie with her Botox lips and smile that looks like the Joker, I almost want to cry.  When the movie first started, I thought it was very interesting that the camera didn't focus upon her face for a very long periods of time.  Now I know why.  Even with makeup, I want to grab her by the shoulders and cry ""why?""

Looking beyond the physical changes to her as a woman, I cannot say that this movie had very many redeeming qualities rather than being a mildly entertaining romantic comedy. From a fat woman with low self-esteem, who suddenly comes to life after someones drops a quarter in her cup of coffee while she's sitting on the floor, she turns into a skinny rail with protruding ribs (the new look of beauty).  Her son who hasn't seen his mother in three years comes home to find a changed body and a mother who is gone off the deep end.  Rather than finding herself through traveling the world and studying various religions, I thought she lost herself instead.

Enters Antonio Banderas, who we are led to believe is the ""bad boy"" in the movie.  They meet and fall in love playing itsy-bitsy spider in the bedroom. Well, I'd play anything in bed with Tony myself, but it's not exactly the most romantic scene of the movie.  He falls in love, she falls in love, and everyone has a secret.  Her son ends up investigating him as a thief, and the movie ends that's he's really not that bad boy after all.  Ah, love.  They kiss and live happily ever after.

I almost want to apologize for my lack in liking the movie.  Instead, the only message I came away with was watch out for plastic surgery. It can kill a career.",1342224000,,1711,4.356466876971608

3403384,3,B00177YA0Q,"This flick begins with the promise of more laughs to come (particularly from Meg Ryan), but as soon as Colin Hanks' character becomes the central point, it goes downhill quickly and no one can save it. The evolution of the story is painfully predictable. And good grief! Does Meg Ryan have no honest friends to tell her she's gone too far in the pursuit of false youth? Her face has been distorted by Botox, collagen, and bad face-lifts. The uncomplimentary lighting, poor makeup and too much hair made matters worse. If it weren't for her unique mannerisms and quirkiness, it would have been almost difficult to recognize her. No wonder this film went straight to video! Antonio Banderas may be worth a comedic turn, but this one isn't it (and why he got top billing is beyond me). Selma Blair was woefully underused and could have provided a better balance to the rest of the cast. There is one actor, though, who unintentionally steals the comedy: Enrico Colantoni. His madly in love, screaming and wailing, Italian-chef dumped lover is a hoot.",1319068800,4,1047,4.790055248618785

3403386,4,B00177YA0Q,"I saw a preview of this movie when I was watching another DVD and I had to see it.  I like Meg Ryan and I miss seeing her in films nowadays.  What's wrong with Hollywood not utilizing a great comedic actor like her?  I've heard several female actors say Hollywood loses interest in them when they age but come on, this is ridiculous.  A woman really starts getting interesting and comes into her own beauty after 40 in my opinion.  Okay, I'm off my soapbox.  This comedy made me laugh out loud and I could really identify with Meg's character who went from over two hundred pounds to fit and healthy and really started living her life fully. Antonio Banderas is wonderful as always as her new boyfriend who may or may not be an international art thief.  All of the supporting cast was fabulous too.  Enrico, the Italian chef whom Marti (Meg's character) broke up with was hilarious as the spurned lover who just can't let go.",1317772800,14,925,4.464285714285714

Think of True Lies crossed with .... Cinderella?  Spies, danger, conflicted loyalties, ugly duckings transformed into swans, laughs, and true love coming to those who wait.  Very sweet in the end.  Colin Hanks (Tom's boy, as we would say down here) was excellent.  Meg Ryan's cheek implants needed a little more time to settle, I think, but she is still beautiful.  Banderas is still Banderas.  The face, the hair, the accent!  Loved it.",1284163200,3,615,4.798076923076923

PLOT - To make this a long story short, BANDERAS meets RYAN by accident and it so happens that MEG'S son is an FBI Agent. MEG'S son finds out that BANDERAS is an ART THIEF so the most of the movie is based on MEG'S son chasing after BANDERAS. In the end BANDERAS ends up working as an undercovered CIA agent catching the real art thiefs.

3403392,2,B00177YA0Q,"Colin Hanks is an FBI agent Henry Durand, whose beautiful mother Martha (Meg Ryan) is dating a handsome and mysterious guy named Tommy (Antonio Banderas). To his greater surprise, Henry discovers that his mom's new boyfriend is in fact an international art thief his FBI office is after. Things get more complicated when Henry has to spy on his own mother, and Henry's fiance Emily (Selma Blair) working for FBI gets involved in his mission.

Though I do not think ""My Mom's New Boyfriend"" is a terrible film as some reviewers say, it is not as funny or entertaining as it should be. The film written and directed by George Gallo has certainly a mildly interesting (though implausible) story, but it never knows how to make the most of it. The comic scenes often look clumsy, poorly executed, and not thought out well, largely relying on Colin Hank's embarrassed face. The two leads lack chemistry and Salma Blair's character has little to do.

But what happened to Meg Ryan's career? Why did she accept doing this? The idea of Meg Ryan in fat suit is already questionable to begin with, but Martha she plays here is not really a likable character. This is especially so when she overacts, playing a slightly selfish person not in an enjoyable way, and the film's wacky humor means pointless car action (with Meg Ryan yelling repeatedly) and a drunk Italian chef serenading on the front lawn.",1260662400,2,1392,4.74793388429752

Yes.  I want to see my favorite stars in roles as they age.  It gives me hope seeing older people shine in the craft they do so well.

Because charm and wit doesn't dull just because you get wrinkles in your face and pains in your body.  The human spirit lives on and on.  And that aging stars can perform so well is an underlying message when you put these time-tested stars in a movie making vehicle.

Actually, the title of this show makes it sound like Meg Ryan is going to be frumpy.  She was not.  She was the shining star and that made the movie ever more surprising.",1254182400,2,795,4.19205298013245

3403399,1,B00177YA0Q,"I don't usually write reviews, but I suffered through Homeland Security just last night and it was so thoroughly awful I feel honor-bound to take a few moments to warn anyone against buying, renting or accepting an invitation to watch it. Have you noticed that people who have had a nasty health scare or survived a brush with death on the highway often feel compelled in the immediate aftermath to alert others so they can avert falling into similar danger? That's a little like how I feel this morning. There is nothing positive I can say about Homeland Security. It's painfully slow and stilted, the acting is wooden, the plot line is inane and just about every single joke falls horribly flat. I don't think there's any single area of culpability: it's a combination of weak concept plus failures in the script, direction and editing room. I had always considered Banderas and Ryan to be reasonably talented actors - at the very least endowed with a certain screen presence - so it was something of a surprise to see a movie they star in turn out to be so staggeringly awful. It was actually embarrassing to watch - and who wants to spend 90 minutes cringing through a movie? In supporting roles, Colin Hanks may turn out to be a fine actor one day, but he strikes out looking in his first major appearance. Selma Blair's performance was not bad at all, though I doubt she'll be highlighting this movie on her career resume in the years ahead. My recommendation ... Homeland Security would make a perfect Christmas or birthday gift for someone you particularly dislike.",1223769600,,1573,4.702898550724638

Had this been a bunch of unknowns, this one would have rated one star.  I've read other reviews that said Selma Blair was under used.  There's no doubt abut that but what about Antonio Banderas?  What a shameful waste of talent this was.  I felt so bad, watching a pretty good actor embarrass himself.  As for Meg Ryan, she was just terrible and looked like she had had a few too many Botox treatments or something.  Not only did her face look like plastic, but her character (Marty) was the dictionary definition of obnoxious.  She played every scene like a complete bubble head, being as immature as possible.  I guess this was meant to demonstrate what a 'free spirit' she had become after losing all that weight.  The FBI guys were a joke and the final resolution was so hokey to be just stupid.  Really, would one agency send out one maverick agent into the jurisdiciton of another agency without backup or even letting the other agency know what is going on?  A hint maybe?  Colin Hanks did a good job of looking confused I guess, but had not much of a script to work with.  Selma Blair, as lots of other reviews have pointed out was very much under used.  This looked like a film where some stars needed a quick pay check, did their parts and got out.  Certainly this is one of the worst 'romantic comedies' ever made.  It wasn't funny, the plot was stupid and the actors pretty much mailed it in.  If you have to see this one, rent it.

So there's plenty of conflict in the plot, and it makes for interesting watching.  It's a good movie, light and amusing, and worth watching.  It's also buy-worthy, in the sense that you might see it again when you're looking for some light entertainment.

I agree with other reviewers that the plot was really unbelievable but that is OK if the movie is entertaining.  Unfortunately, this one was not.  It dragged and I actually grabbed my laptop to play some mindless solitaire while watching the second half of the movie.  Even the ""twist"" ending was obvious throughout.

It's kind of scary when Meg Ryan smiles (her face is a disaster, but her lips are freaky) but other than that she looks good and can still pull off her Megness like no one else. There are a couple scenes that are pure Meg. When Antonio is fawning over how hot she looks, she responds ""Yeah! I know!"" Only Meg could do that and not make everybody sick. In another scene she gets mad at him and throws a fit, punching and screaming into the air. Antonio just watches until its over and is speechless (so was I) but for a genuinely soft-spoken ""Wow."" It was nice to see those scenes. Meg's still got it and Antonia doesn't seem like he's going to lose it any time soon.

It was a pleasant surprise to see how good Antonio looks. Maybe I just haven't seen him in a while. I've always liked him in comedies. If you like Antonio, you'll love the scene where he ends up with each hand in a glass of water (or white wine?). Antonio could charm the socks off ... I dunno, somebody who really needed their socks.

That's what these kinds of movies are all about, right? How good do our stars look? How much we enjoy seeing our favorite celebrities prance about ... acting.

There's a light twist at the end so everybody can be happy. Upon reflection it explained a few unanswered hmmmm's from previous scenes but I didn't see it coming because I wasn't expecting it; I didn't need it and I had forgotten about those scenes because this isn't a movie you keep score on.

3403409,2,B00177YA0Q,"Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Marty Durand (Meg Ryan) goes from fat to phat while her son Henry (Colin Hanks) is away learning spy stuff with the FBI
2. Henry returns to the nest, to find Mom ruling the roost with an adoring flock
3. He isn't pleased when she's knocked off her feet by charming smoothie Tommy (Antonio Banderas)
4. He's even more unhappy with his next FBI assignment
5. Romantic comedy turns into unbelievably bad caper

Meg Ryan rarely shows the sparkle of her previous starring roles, while Colin Hanks is basically boring. Selma Blair is so underutilized you could say she's unused, and Antonio Banderas is .... well, just Banderas.

This is intended to be a frothy light comedy caper, but instead of being bubbly and entertaining, it sinks like a lead weight. Even if you suspend disbelief and forgive the plot, there's just not enough to make it worth your while.

Seeing that I like both Meg Ryan and Selma Blair, I'll give this one an extra star, and recommend that you go watch some of their other movies instead.

With a lovelorn Italian Chef and a youngster on a Harley, as her romantic discards, Banderas (Tommy) makes a more suitable catch. Or does he?  Is he about to be the mastermind behind one of the biggest art thefts in history?  Will he wind up doing prison time like her son's (Colin Hanks) father.  Can Marty be THAT unlucky in love?  Is it all just a reflection of her pattern of being attracted to ""bad boys""? Maybe she needs therapy!

Colin Hanks performance stands out as the OCD type of FBI Field Agent, who can't adapt to his mom's metamorphosis.  Banderas and Ryan did not have very good chemistry together.  They both seemed to be too focused on developing their own roles and physical appearances for the sake of the camera. Banderas walked around rather stiff and as though he were from a wax museum, but still painfully attractive.  Meg was a bit of a mess, with stringy, bed-head hair that begged to be tamed and is no longer one of her positive trademarks. However, it was great to see her acting again.  I mean...who doesn't love Meg. It would be good to see her stretch her acting into deeper, more meaningful roles, at this mid-life crossroad.  She has the talent, so one would hope she doesn't continue with roles that are clearly beneath her.  They probably had fun shooting this quirky film.  Maybe that's all she was after.  Wouldn't want to own it, but it was cute to watch...once.",1214265600,5,1673,4.585858585858586
3403413,1,B00177YA0Q,"This cast of characters,  both on and off screen,  seem far too into themselves to give good performances.  The writing MAY have been saved by better casting or at LEAST better direction.  This film is a complete flop and,  if you watch it until completion,  you'll lose faith in Hollywood:  DON'T DO IT.  Steer your money and your time away from this film.",1213833600,5,357,4.555555555555555

If, like me, you're looking to watch a light-hearted, fun movie, then this may be your cup of tea.  I've already watched it countless times for the sheer fun and enjoyment I believe it was intended to elicit.",1213747200,23,341,4.483870967741935
8265308,4,B00177YA0Q,"Pretty good movie but Meg Ryan looks the same age as her adult son (which was a little disturbing) but great that one actress has not aged badly or had so much plastic surgery she is unrecognizable but I was distracted by the fact that everyone- son, girlfriend, mom and her boyfriend all appeared to be the same age.  Cute movie and worth watching.",1522886400,,349,4.453125
8265309,1,B00177YA0Q,"This is an awful movie. A light-hearted caper comedy , but absolutely nothing works. I suppose it was intended s a vehicle for Colin Hanks, and the rest of the cast are noted excellent actors, but it's just a bad film. There is one notable scene, Meg Ryan poolside - and still stunning. It drives home the other disaster she's been in - the unfortunate mutilation of her plastic surgery. So I guess she now does movies like this.",1522022400,,429,4.443037974683544
8265310,4,B00177YA0Q,"I watched this one years ago and remember liking it.  The movie packs in a lot of improbable, nonsensical adventure after a more realistic start. The mother undergoes a personal transformation over the course of 3 years and her son has a hard time dealing with his mom's newly found confident outlook on life. This of course is the human element that we can and do relate to.  My favorite scene was when the mom was at the airport and someone mistook her for a bag lady.  The jolt of suddenly and inescapably seeing herself as strangers saw her was so real, so familiar.  She immediately cleaned up her act (which in real life most of us begin to do after a-ha moments but only some of us manage to sustain).

When the plot takes a turn and we are suddenly in a farce, a cops and robbers movie no less, we can forgive the inanity because we've already started to love this woman's gumption.  Antonio Banderas is a surprising pick to be Mom's boyfriend, which of course makes perfect sense given that his unsuitability is exactly the point, as he is an unlikely and unwelcome boyfriend.

My only gripe (and hence 4 stars instead of 5) is with the raunchy FBI bedroom humor.  I couldn't stand it, thought it was in bad taste, and found it unnecessary.  However, looked at another way, I think the point they were trying to make with the distasteful bedroom humor is that the son's stomach churned over hearing his mother and he, just like the viewer, also found FBI techniques unacceptable but needed to keep his job.

Recommended for those who like to escape into light romantic comedies with beautiful people.",1521417600,,1609,4.555555555555555
