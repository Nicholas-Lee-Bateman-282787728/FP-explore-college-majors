6699309,5,B00O1D3CC0,"CBS's innovative and exciting new drama, Hostages, was chosen by critics to be the big hit of the 2013 fall season, but things didn't quite turn out that way. The show was much more than I expected and unlike anything else on network television, but the amazing story is both the reason people did and didn't watch it.

The problem with Hostages was that if people did watch it an it was renewed, where else could you go? Season 2 would have required a whole other cast and story or else it would risk just going around in circles. It's also the kind of show where you have to watch it from the beginning and see every episode to know what's going on, so either way the show was doomed from the beginning. Don't get me wrong, the story was phenomenal, and would have been one of the best mini-series ever, but beyond that there was nowhere to go and I think people realized that.

Dr. Ellen Sanders (Toni Collette) is one of the best surgeons in the country, and her day has come as she has been selected to operate on the President of The United States. The Sanders family are on top of the world, until one night a group of mercenaries break into their home and give her a simple task. Kill the President or we kill your family. From there the family is held hostage until the surgery is upon them.

Toni Collette stars, and while she's been in a ton of things, this was easily her best performance since the Sixth Sense. She was so good that it seemed like the kind of role that was written specifically for her. The doctor had some wild ideas and took some crazy risks to try and find out who the mercenaries were and why they were really doing this.

Collette is paired with veteran TV star, Dylan McDermott, who plays double duty as both her captor and as an FBI agent, who has a ton of other things on his plate. The story itself seems simplistic, but there are so many side elements that effect each character, but none more so than McDermott's charachter, FBI agent Duncan Carlyle.

Hostages is edge of your seat excitement, with a cast that is top notch. There is so much more going on here than a simple hostage situation. Each character has their own story that could really be worthy of a film and the show goes in so many unexpected directions, it just really was outstanding in every sense of the word.

I absolutely loved this show and watched all 15 episodes in a week, still the show was easily doomed to a single season, because of the complexity and inflexibility of the story.",1419379200,10,2497,4.370689655172414
8681337,3,B00O1D3CC0,"This starts out with 5-star episodes and gradually erodes itself to a final 3-star rating.  I have a feeling this should been 2 episodes, maybe 3, because the writers seem intent on muddying the waters with as much soap-opera filler instead of delivering on the initial episode's strong promise of entertainment.",1526083200,,312,5.117647058823529

8681343,1,B00O1D3CC0,"I have a rule never to review a work unless I have seen/read it from start to finish, but in this case I'll make an exception. The series seems to be very interesting. However, I did not watch it because I came to realize it contains no subtitles or closed captioning for the hearing impaired, which in this day and age is inexcusable. Shame on you, Warner, for such an omission.

8681346,5,B00O1D3CC0,"I don't watch most popular TV series or miniseries, as I am a ""sports nut,"" especially about football and basketball.  But after watching the first episode of ""Hostages"" I was hooked -- I just couldn't wait to see the next episode the following week.  And that continued until the entire miniseries was over (all too soon).  Maybe is was the story -- or the chemistry of the actors -- or something else.  My one word for this show is: RIVETING.
If it had been a book, I wouldn't have put it down till I finished the last page. But I had to wait about 10 weeks to see the entire series -- and then I couldn't purchase the complete series on DVDs for many months.  So my anticipation and frustration levels were very high.  I won't betray the plot, only that it is plausible and therefore all the more realistic.  This is a taut show that contains a minimum of ""filler"" to extend it.",1426377600,4,881,4.335365853658536
