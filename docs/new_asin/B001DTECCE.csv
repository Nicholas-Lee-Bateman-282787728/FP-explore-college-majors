3539260,5,B001DTECCE,This DVD is a great help in learning Tommy's style. There is no tab with it but you can buy the tab books on Amazon of the albums for around $15 each. Just watching Tommy perform and explain the songs makes this DVD worth having.  Highly recommended!,1229731200,3,250,4.319148936170213
3539261,5,B001DTECCE,"This guy is amazing. With this DVD and others like it, will do one of two things, you will either practice more or want to put your guitar away.",1378080000,,144,4.0
3539262,1,B001DTECCE,"This DVD consists of Tommy playing each song and then really quickly breaking down each major section of the piece. While it is quite interesting to hear him describe some of his motivations for writing different sections its impossible to consider this a credible instructional video.

The problems:
1) No tabs/sheet music included. Really? Really?!? In what universe is this acceptable? This has been the standard way of learning a song for an accompanying video since Stefan Grossman started distributing sheet music booklets with videotapes. Every instructional DVD/video/CD I have ever bought includes the tabs. If you don't have that, you might as well learn this by watching Youtube. And thats exactly what you'll feel like if you actually try to learn a song from this DVD.

2) No split screen/both hands, half tempo playthrough of each song. This has also become standard. It makes the techniques being used a lot more obvious and easier to parse. Tommy just blows through the songs and sort of expects you to keep up.

3) Only the most minimal attempt at explaining the techniques used. Here's an example: In Lewis and Clark, there's a whole vamp on using an upstroke with the thumb on an offbeat to create a cool rhythmic sound. Its not impossible to sort of mimic this sound but its hard to nail precisely what he's doing. In the DVD, he just says : Oh yeah, use your thumb on an upstroke here, and then moves on. No attempt at an explanation. No breakdown of the mechanics involved. Oh I figured it out... eventually. But I don't buy an instructional DVD to have to spend 20 minutes to work out every little trick being used in. Super aggravating.

The positives.
1) Tommy's fun to watch. But if thats what you want to do, just buy a concert video.

Wildly, wildly disappointed with this DVD. As a player, Tommy should know better than to put something out like this. I feel vaguely insulted. If I hadn't bought it at one of his live shows, I would return it.

Just a note of background about me and qualifications to review this: I have been playing guitar for over 25 years and am quite advanced as a fingerstyle player.",1360972800,4,2135,4.664893617021277
3539263,3,B001DTECCE,"The DVD itself has within complete songs and rough break down of the methodology and techique. Camera shots could be better. BUT the major problem is the lack of written tabs and/or standard music.

I know Tommy doesn't read much and certainly doesn't 'write' music, but someone could come up with tabs which would be a tremendous help and bring my rating to a 4 or better.

Thanks anyway Tommy. Still a very good effort, but not for the guitarist that wants to learn from an intermediate standpoint. He does show you some tricks and some technique which anyone can incorporate into their playing.

3539264,5,B001DTECCE,"I've really been enjoying this DVD. I'm a big Tommy Emmanuel fan. Be advised this DVD contains no charts, or TAB of any kind and I'd definitely say that most of the lessons on this DVD are in fairly advanced territory, though some are intermediate. The material is presented as if you're having a one on one sit down with the man himself. From there he takes you through all the particulars of selected tunes at full tempo and re-visits different different sections of the tune to show more detail, usually slowing things down for clarity. If you're wondering, ""So just how advanced is it?"" - well I've been a guitar instructor at the university level and taught privately for 3 decades. Specializing mostly in electric playing styles, jazz, rock, fusion etc. and some of this stuff kicks my butt. LOL. If you're a fairly advanced player who's looking for a fresh challenge from the acoustic side - this is THE ticket right here. Tommy ROCKS!! Just know going in he's NOT going to spoon feed you the material. So if you have some transcription chops and need a chart, you'll be rolling your own - that's what I did and it's something i didn't mind at all.",1301443200,6,1155,4.5576923076923075
3539265,5,B001DTECCE,"I have all the DVDs Tommy has produced over the years, and finally we get one that doesn't have a wandering camera-man or creative director who does creative fades just when the passage I want to learn goes by. I like the simple - straight forward - no nonsense production of this work.",1294099200,2,286,4.415094339622642
3539266,5,B001DTECCE,"The way to use this video is to learn the song yourself using tab, utube, MP3 etc. Then watch the master play. You have to have some idea of the struture of the song. Then when you watch this video you will see the masters fingerings and other nuances. I could not ask for more. Keep it up Tommy!",1253145600,4,296,4.033898305084746
3539267,5,B001DTECCE,"Tommy teaches by example.  The close-ups and angles of both hands tells the story of how the songs are done.  As Tommy would say, the key to success ""is lots of hard work, Practice! Practice! Practice!"".  The high definition is outstanding.",1248652800,2,240,4.804878048780488
3539268,4,B001DTECCE,"I have seen Tommy live a couple of times and I have just about everything he has put out. He always comes across as being very passionate about the guitar. He has a great sence of humour and is fun to watch. I'd say this DVD is for those at a fairly advanced playing level but one that anyone who is appreciates watching one of the worlds best guitarists at work would enjoy. If you're looking for more basic instruction check out his ""up close"" and ""guitar talk"" DVD's.

3539269,4,B001DTECCE,"This is an absolutely fantastic look at how Tommy Emmanuel makes those great guitar sounds. It is not for beginners. On the other hand, if you appreciate guitar music played by the best, it's fun just to watch what he does. I am a guitar player, and doubt I will be playing any of those tunes like Tommy, but I will be watching and coming up with my own somewhat simpler versions with the help of this video. I will look forward to getting the next one.",1231286400,2,453,4.218390804597701

For learning the songs, you're better off downloading a pdf or watching some youtube videos with someone else playing. There's no difference between watching this DVD or watching one of his live concerts in youtube, he's just sitting closer to the camera. I got this from a friend so it's OK, but if I had buy it, I would be really disappointed.",1388361600,3,478,4.505747126436781
8294815,5,B001DTECCE,If you're looking for tabs this is sure to disappoint. But if you want to watch how a master guitar player operates you will get a ton of insight. This isn't for the faint of heart as it is an advanced demonstration of how to make a guitar really sing. What almost anyone can take away initially is a few methods for both right and left hands. I find it best to take it in small chunks.,1382313600,,386,4.025974025974026
