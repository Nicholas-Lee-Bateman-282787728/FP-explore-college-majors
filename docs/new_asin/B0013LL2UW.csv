3117707,4,B0013LL2UW,I would love this movie if it wasn't due to some small details. The first is the acting needs a little work I cannot give an in depth description of what needs to be corrected. I do not have much knowledge on acting all I know is something is missing. The other problem is I feel the story was lacking in something as well. All in all I did enjoy the movie I even thought the graphics where well done especially for a movie not consider the A list.,1446163200,,448,4.044943820224719

3117709,4,B0013LL2UW,"This is a B-Movie at its best, Good verses Evil. light magic Vs Dark magic, The reluctant hero wallowing in self pity, returns to save the day.  So here's the long and short of it, An evil Magic user has taken the goodness of Chi magic and channeled it to harm even kill.  The forces joined up to stop him.  After years of imprisonment, he is released and wants to destroy all of those who locked him away.  Meet LIZZY STRAIN, Julie's kid sister. she plays the girl who wants to help her grandfather (our reluctant hero) When the evil magus and his sexy but lethal side kick find out about her they want to kill her and absorb her powers. Lizzy does an excellent job in her first attempt at carrying a movie.  This movie is great for those who love B-Movies and for those who want to experience something other than the same old hollywood dribble.  I would have given this movie a 5 but they give you the impression that Julie is one of the main characters and she in fact has only a small part in the movie.  This is truely Lizzy's vehicle.",1319587200,2,1041,4.253807106598985
3117710,1,B0013LL2UW,"Bad writing, cheap effects, bad acting, gratuitous sexuality, fight scenes that rival the 1960's ""Batman"" TV show for campiness: all the ingredients for a disaster. Ron Fitzgerald was especially cartoonish as the Bad Guy. He was supposed to scare and intimidate me with his evil and his power, and all I wanted to do was punch his silly face in front of his scantily clad amazon girlfriend (whose sole function was to desperately try to distract the audience from the incompetent job everyone did on this movie).

I paid $2 for this movie. Having seen it; I wouldn't accept it as a gift.

Thinking of buying this movie? Be bored! Be VERY bored!",1242345600,,644,4.6902654867256635
3117711,1,B0013LL2UW,"I ordered this movie because I mistakenly thought it was the one based on John Fowles novel about an ESL teacher who runs into some weird adventures on a small Greek island.

No such luck.

It's a B-movie about a modern-day wizard, a renegade from his order called ""the Magus.""

Lordy Lord!  Terrible acting, inept directing, cack-handed editing, laughable special effects, and a script that seems like it was written by a 12-year-old.
