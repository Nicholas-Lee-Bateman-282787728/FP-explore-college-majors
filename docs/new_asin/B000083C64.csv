7978682,2,B000083C64,"The production has 9 short features and only when you add up the other special features do you come close to three hour of DVD.

Foet, the lead film is about making purses from aborted fetal flesh. Once you get over the shock and whatever message the film maker is attempting to make, it gets boring. Mondo Ford was without a doubt my favorite of the group. A comedy that links Gerald Ford, space aliens, and the Kennedy assassination making fun of conspiracy theories.

If you skip over the rest, you might thank me later. In fact one production, ""Cheese Theater"" I stopped watching half way through.

Much of the film extras is Lloyd Kaufman blowing his own horn about art and condemning Mickey Mouse.

Guide: F-bomb, sex, no nudity.",1419811200,,735,4.630769230769231
7978683,2,B000083C64,"This DVD has a total of 9 shorts. Tasty and Radiation March clock in at a total of 2 1/2 minutes total. These are just brief clips of junk. The movie Foet was decent and set the tone for a possible good DVD. It basically goes downhill from there. The lost Arrowhead Beer commercials are pretty good for 5 minutes of entertainment. The movies run a total of less than an hour and a half total.

Tromatic goodies include Tromatic classroom Lesson 3:The Matte Explosion, tromadancing with mark Borchardt (a decent 12 min segment), and some commercials for troma and tromadance. It also features trailers for Citizen Toxie, Chopper Chicks from Zombietown, Angel Negro, The Hall Monitor, and The Battle of Love's Return.

Overall, I think I went in not expecting much and got even less with this DVD. I know volumes 1 & 4 are really good. If I got this one before the others, I probably would never get another tromadance DVD. This is likely the worst of the bunch. I would skip it, there is not much to see here.",1147305600,2,1008,4.502732240437158
7978684,3,B000083C64,"While still an interesting and bizarre collection of ultra-independent shorts, this crop is not as strong as Vol. 1's. The three standouts are the extra-brief but hilarious Arrowhead Beer, the stylish and unsettling Undisciplined, and the hilariously smutty and gross Tasty.
I went to Tromadance this year, and I have been told Vol. 3 is going to be made from many of those films. If that is true, Vol. 3 may easily be the best so far. Stay tuned.",1080259200,5,447,4.670886075949367
