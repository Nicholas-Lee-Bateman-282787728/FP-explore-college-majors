5524759,5,B00AWS1X5G,"Miranda Hart is a treasure ! Kind of o mix between a female Basil Fawlty and  Lucille Ball . Love, love ,love her ! If you enjoy contemporary Brit Wit this series is a winner !",1398643200,4,176,3.888888888888889
5524760,5,B00AWS1X5G,"I can't get enough of Miranda. I can watch the episodes over and over again. I first saw Miranda Hart as a guest on The Graham Norton chat show (also highly recommended) and did a Google search to find out more about her. It's difficult to find this show in America, I guess episodes were once shown on PBS but no longer. This DVD set contains all three of the current seasons (there is apparently a 4th season coming soon!). But be WARNED -- these are a Region 2 DVD. They will not play on most DVD players sold in the USA, you will need a Region/Code Free DVD player to watch these. It seems there are many folks unaware that DVDs from other countries have different region codes and will only play on the corresponding players.",1392854400,21,730,4.335766423357664
5524761,5,B00AWS1X5G,Such Fun!!!!,1473292800,,12,5.5
5524762,5,B00AWS1X5G,Love this type of humor. We quote it all the time. The only thing I wish is that they made DVDs that worked in US or digital copies so we could play them on the regular player without having to find a region 2 player.,1472342400,,217,3.8444444444444446
5524763,5,B00AWS1X5G,"OMG! I freaking love Miranda! I was so excited when they started showing her again here in the US on PBS. But, I really wish they would make this complete series available to buy here :-( Either way, I'm watching her over and over on the add on subscription of Acorn on Amazon Prime! I'm soooo happy and I have my mom watching Miranda and we laugh and laugh!

Miranda is one who can make you pee your pants laughing so hard. And I'm not telling you how I know this! =) The cast of characters on the show are awesome too! Why can't all of the good shows go on and on! I want more than three!

I would love to have a best friend like Miranda without her pushing me over like she does to her little friend! For those who haven't seen Miranda she is 6 foot ish and she looks like a giant next to smaller people.

But, trust me, if you haven't seen Miranda and have the opportunity to then give it a go because she is hilarious!",1468281600,,923,4.032786885245901

5524767,4,B00AWS1X5G,This series is so funny!  Miranda hart snd the wonderful supporting cast make these shows a lsugh a minute.  However i was very disappointed to find that the final two epusodes which wrapped up the plot lines were not included in this set.  Buy the bix set with the finale episodes!!

5524771,5,B00AWS1X5G,"One of the funniest British comedies ever made, right up there with Fawlty Towers, just a shame that the BBC would never release it as a Region-1 (USA), DVD, but well worth the added effort of watching it on a laptop or region independent player.",1447718400,2,246,4.488888888888889

5524785,5,B00AWS1X5G,"This is the funniest series ever, I don't LOL but with Miranda I had tears rolling down my face with some of her antics. The shows characters are great and enhance the comic genius of Miranda Hart.  My whole family enjoys watching this series and are sad that it was so short lived.",1424217600,2,282,4.320754716981132
5524786,5,B00AWS1X5G,"Am a little upset that I cannot watch these.  Was not aware of the fact that they cannot be played on a regular Vcr/DVDs player that is hooked to my TV.  UK import did not mean a thing to me.  This info should be specified to the buyer as ""this cannot be played on a regular vcar/dvd player ....then specify what you need to play it on.....especially for unsavy computer people like myself.",1423785600,,390,4.315068493150685
5524787,5,B00AWS1X5G,"I started watching Miranda on Hulu.  I am so excited to have it now on DVD!  The DVD came exactly as scheduled; so fast!  I'm only on the first episode and it is so great to watch it without commercials!!!!  When I first wanted to buy it, it was out of stock, and when I got it there were only 15 left.  I'm not surprised.  It is hilarious.  I'm not one to laugh out loud but this show does it for me.  Miranda is a genius.  This is one of the few characters on TV I can really relate to.  I also love the rest of the characters especially Stevie & Penny. I think my favorite episodes are the Holiday (when she goes on holiday) episode and the Christmas episode. I can't wait to get the final season when it comes out.

There was a notice on the page on Amazon and on the package itself that said the DVD is region 2.  This doesn't matter to me because I have an All region DVD player, but I think it's sad people are so in the dark ages about DVDs and region codes that the seller has to go though all this trouble.  I'm super happy with this DVD set.  Totally worth it!",1421193600,3,1071,3.967136150234742

5524792,5,B00AWS1X5G,"Discovered this 5-star raucous, hilariously funny show on ACORN TV!  Minimal cost but sooooo worth it if you are dedicated to British TV.  I had never heard of Miranda, but I was hooked in the first 3 minutes!  What is wrong with these producers that they can't figure out what a gem they have!  GET THE LEAD OUT AND PRODUCE THESE FOR U.S. FOLK!

My daughter who makes fun of my BBC addiction is now working on her own Miranda addiction.  Such fun!  :)",1415059200,2,452,4.309523809523809
5524793,5,B00AWS1X5G,"Note most people can watch DVDs from a different region on a PC or laptop.  My Dell (and the other laptops I have owned) allow me to change the format 5 times and then it will be locked in.  I have always used my computers to watch my British DVDs and I watch my American DVDs on the DVD player.
I also lived in Britain and was able to watch American DVDs on my British PC.
Sellers of foreign DVDs always say things like ""you'll need a multiregion DVD player"" which I would think would dissuade most people from buying.....",1414281600,4,523,4.22
5524794,4,B00AWS1X5G,When are we going to get this gem playable in America? The bits and pieces you can watch on Youtube made me do all kinds of searching for this show. BBC: you are missing out on the American audience. It looks to be absolutely hysterical!!,1414195200,,238,4.311111111111111

5524797,5,B00AWS1X5G,"Some of the funniest comedy EVER. I subscribe to the Acorn channel for about $5.00 per month on my Roku player to get many British shows, and for me it's well worth it. Lots of slap stick on this show and truly outrageous episodes. Miranda Hart writes the episodes herself and all of the characters are funny. Who knows, perhaps Amazon prime will someday carry this clever show.",1410739200,6,378,4.573529411764706
5524798,5,B00AWS1X5G,I didn't get to view it.  I had to return it as it was not playable in the US.  It was my mistake.  I look forward to a release that will be compatable with US players. But I do love what I have seen of Miranda.,1410480000,,211,3.5434782608695654
5524799,5,B00AWS1X5G,"A friend of mine kept telling me that this was a great show but for some reason I never got around to watching it.  Last weekend, however, I managed to catch it on PBS and I cannot remember when I have laughed so much at a show.  I caught the first episode of Season 3 and I was laughing so hard there were tears streaming down my face.  My roommate even asked me (she was in the living room watching another show), ""what had you laughing so much last night?""  She could hear me all the way in the front of the house!  I've watched the episode several times since then and always makes me laugh!

Since then I've watched a few of the episodes online and they are all funny.  Miranda Hart (and the actress who plays her mother) are brilliant in the series.  Actually, I enjoy all the characters.  Miranda is so funny and charming, you can't help but like her.  I also found out that she is on Call the Midwife so I've started watching it as well.

I would love to own this series on dvd/Blu-ray so I'm hoping at some point that we can get the US format here.  Or, I'd even be happy to see it in Amazon's Instant Video!  Bring Miranda to the States---we love her too!

If you want a show that will really lift your spirits and make you laugh until your crying, check out this series.  You will not be disappointed!",1409961600,19,1312,4.171314741035856
5524800,5,B00AWS1X5G,"I had never heard of Miranda Hart until about a week ago. I was looking for some British Comedy on You Tube, and found clips of her TV show - Miranda - by accident. I just loved what I saw, and realized I hadn't laughed so much in a long time. Luckily, we have a multi region DVD player,so I asked my husband to get the Series 1-3 box set for my birthday, with the understanding that I wouldn't watch it until my birthday. Well, to be honest, I don't think I can wait. This show is just to good and too funny. I am counting the days until it arrives, and then it will be non stop - Miranda.",1402272000,7,590,3.925
