7152183,4,B00WS68FCY,"This is one of Christopher Mihm's best films but I still have to deduct a star because... SPOILER ALERT! the title gives away the whole movie!  Danny Johnson does indeed save the world in this film, so give them points for truth in advertising. Still, going into this knowing that Danny Johnson would save the world did take away some of the tension that made Mihm's earlier films so enjoyable.

 I suppose this may have been done to comfort the young audiences this film seems to be aimed at. Any terrified children could be assured by their parents, youth pastors or guardians that as terrifying as the aliens are, Danny Johnson would win out in the end because it says so in the title.  I appreciate the necessity but still think they could have found a better way to ease troubled minds while still allowing some sense of suspense.",1487462400,,835,4.583892617449664
7152184,4,B00WS68FCY,"This is a tough film to review because it has something for everyone.  Young kids will love it because the heroes are kids, there are spaceships, robots, aliens and puppets. Parents will love it because it's totally kid-friendly and there are hilarious bits that the kids might not understand, but will have you in stitches (e.g. the younger sister trying to find just the right stick to use to whack the attacking alien).  There's even a little bit of ""The Princess Bride"" in the grandfather relating the story to the kids.  Although he does lose track of which story he's telling sometimes and does a little creative re-writing of the story as he tells it.  Great fun.",1480550400,,670,4.700854700854701
7152185,5,B00WS68FCY,"Danny Johnson is unique in that there were no ""Muppets"" in the 1950's but it's created in that retro 50's drive-in style. And yet all that matters is how much fun it is to watch. I picked up this flick along with a few other of Christopher R. Mihm' movies at a film festival and have to say this is one of his best. A fun romp to delight all ages complete with puppets, robots, stop-motion monsters and the fate of the world in the hands of one plucky kid.",1477958400,,456,4.0777777777777775

7152191,2,B00WS68FCY,"People who have read my reviews know I am normally a huge fan of the oddball tribute films lovingly made by Christopher R. Mihm. That's why it's so uncomfortable for me to give ""Danny Johnson Saves The World"" two stars, but I must. In this film Mihm takes on holiday sci-fi films of yesteryear in a flashback format. Imagine Mihm directing a cross between ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" and ""The Princess Bride"" with no budget: that's a gross approximation of what you'll find here. On the plus side, the film is suitable for (and in fact stars) children, and all violence is of an extremely cartoonish variety. Along the way there are nefarious plots, a menacing robot, heroic children, and aggressive puppets, all of which are tangled up in a typical Mihm concept of a retro picture using '50s and '60s B-movies as the touchstone. Even at 68 minutes long, the film feels padded as there isn't a lot of subject matter here; on the other hand, most of the films this uses for inspiration were equally short on plot, so in that regard I suppose he nailed it.

Like I mentioned at the outset, I really like Mihm and hope he will continue to make these films for a long time. If you want a better representation of Mihm's work, my personal favorite is ""Attack of the Moon Zombies"", but if you are specifically after a sci-fi holiday tribute for kids, ""Danny Johnson Saves the World"" may work for you, it just didn't work for me.",1436659200,2,1430,4.542635658914729
8714059,5,B00WS68FCY,"Mihm  delivers again!. Excellent cast, actors are right on it, story line delivers from beginning to end. Once again an amazing job done on little to no budget. I want to thank you all for thoroughly entertaining me! I am now a huge fan.",1533081600,,237,4.386363636363637
8714060,5,B00WS68FCY,"All the kids are cute and adorable, with Elliott MIhm doing a fine job as the lead actor.  James Norgard is good as Grandpa, with his signature line ""Dear God, no!""  I like the Christmas background.  Not scary for young children.",1531094400,,229,4.536585365853658
8714061,1,B00WS68FCY,I believe I must hate puppets after this,1525651200,,40,4.125
8714062,4,B00WS68FCY,"DANNY JOHNSON SAVES THE WORLD (2015) opens w/ a Canoe Cops cartoon. Then, the tale begins, w/ elder Dan Johnson (James Norgard) telling his grandchildren of how he saved our precious planet. Let the 1950's sci-fi flashbacks unfold! Young Danny Johnson (Elliott Mihm) and his friends encounter alien beings and their killer robot, while playing in the woods. Danny must stop the invaders, before they enslave humanity! Utilizing his usual flair for all things cheeeze-tacular, Director, Christopher R. Mihm has created another labor of love, complete w/ puppet aliens, stop-motion monsters, and a splendiferous, trashcan robot! Starring Elliott and the other Mihm children, this one is 100% family-friendly. Definitely a movie to watch w/ the kids! Suitably goofy...",1514678400,2,765,5.491525423728813
8714063,5,B00WS68FCY,"Looks like one of those old, weird classic monster-scifi-robot kiddie movies from yesteryear, and is so much fun, action-packed, and funny--all at the same time.  Kids would enjoy this movie, but it's also made with an adult audience in mind.  (Works on more than one level.)  Lots of fun, just like all of Christopher Mihm's movies are!",1514592000,,337,4.87719298245614
8714064,3,B00WS68FCY,Wasn't up to Mihm's usual standards.  I like the cheese but this was clearly an excuse to use family and as such was kind of boring.,1514505600,2,132,4.076923076923077
8714065,4,B00WS68FCY,Retro all ages Sci-Fi for kids and adults. Great homage to the B-movies of yesteryear.,1513987200,,86,4.8

8714067,5,B00WS68FCY,"Is the acting a little sketchy? Yep. Does the budget show? Yep. Is it fun? Triple yep. If you don't get a kick out of retro films with threadbare budgets and kooky plotlines then you will probably want to avoid this film. But for me, it was a blast. Heck, I'd like to buy one of those alien puppets!",1494288000,,299,4.084745762711864
