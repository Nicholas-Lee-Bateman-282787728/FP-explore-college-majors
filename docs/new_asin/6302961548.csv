7832510,5,6302961548,"I can't believe I have never watched this film and am so glad someone put it up on Youtube. FRIENDSHIP IN VIENNA is a 1988 TV movie that is one of the few child-friendly Holocaust films and thus classroom-friendly. Based on the story, DEVIL IN VIENNA, it traces the friendship between two thirteen-year-old girls, one a Catholic, and the other a Jew in Vienna at the advent of WW II.

Lise Mueller (Kamie Harper) and Inge Dornenwald (Jenny Lewis) are both best friends and despite their different faiths, and the disapproval of their families, continue to be friends, even after the Anschluss (the annexation of Austria by Germany in 1938). Initially, Inge's parents are against emigrating despite Inge's grandfather's (played by Ed Asner) insistence that things are only going to get worse for the Jews. It is only after the Anschluss and after witnessing first-hand the cruelty perpetrated by fellow Austrians against the Jews, Austrians who are Nazi sympathizers, that Inge's parents decide emigration might be the best escape.

There are plenty of tense moments in this film, but nothing that depicts the brutality of the Nazis in a graphic manner, so it makes for an appropriate film to show to children and discuss the Holocaust with them. The two child actors portraying Lise and Inge do an amazing job in their roles and are very credible in their portrayal of best friends willing to do anything to remain friends and be together. The ending is bittersweet but all in all, I would recommend this for those looking for a kid-friendly film to open up a discussion about the Holocaust.",1457740800,4,1591,4.888888888888889
7832511,5,6302961548,This movie should be a required movie in history classes where the Holocaust is being discussed.  It is a fictional story that introduces the struggles of the Jewish people in occupied countries during World War II.  Every school library should have this film in its circulation.,1322352000,2,279,5.043478260869565
7832512,5,6302961548,"Service was excellent.  I requested having the film sent quickly for a showing to students and it was sent without delay.  I also received a response from the person letting me know that my request was being honored.
The story shows how a friendship of 2 girls, one Jewish and one Christian saved the lives of the family, with the help of the priest.  Good comparisons of each family and some historical perspective of changes in the 1930's and 1940's in Vienna.  Excellent for school viewing.",1278201600,3,493,4.6976744186046515
7832513,5,6302961548,This is a beautiful and moving story about friendship and the high price that so many innocent people paid.  This story like others gives in-sight into just the type of things that had to be done in order to survive and it gives the viewer the rare ability to see a story of survival.  What one friend does for another is truly amazing.  Because as Lisa tells her priest.... not saving three people from harm.... must surely dis-obey the laws of GOD.  I truly wish that this movie were available on DVD.,1215907200,3,503,4.434782608695652
7832514,5,6302961548,"This movie is such a touching story.  It's a very personal tale of a world event.  The cast has some heav-hitters.  The young girls are great as well.  I taped this off TV when I was a kid.  Now, at age 30, I still watch it!  It's good for all ages.  A real tear-jerker.  I can't believe it hasn't been offered on DVD!",1170028800,4,318,3.9365079365079363

7832516,5,6302961548,"Vienna 1938 - The innocent friendship between schoolmates Inge and  Lise creates tension between their families because Inge is Jewish, and Lise is the daughter of a  high-ranking Nazi. With Hitler in power and World War II about to erupt in Europe, it's a time for fear and uncertainty for all. But as the persecution of the Austrian Jews increases, the girl's courage grows and their special friendship triumphs over discriminimation.

  Emmy Award winner Ed Asner (Roots, Lou Grant) stars as Inge's grandfather with Oscar nominee Jane Alexander (Kramer vs. Kramer) and  Stephen Macht (Cagney & Lacey) as her parents. This award winning film is a compelling tale of unselfish loyalty and courage - it's sure to become a family favorite!",1102032000,8,738,5.0578512396694215
7832517,5,6302961548,"It's been about 5 years since I've seen this film but I STILL remember it very well.  I first saw it when I was 8 years old and had it on VHS.  I had it until I was about 13 & watched it often, until someone taped over it. >:(  Anyway, the thing about this movie, is the way it draws you in and forces you to feel the emotional trauma of the war.  The fact that I could be interested in this type of film at 8, shows how it reaches out & grabs your attention and presents the tumult of the times in an uncomplicated way.  Very touching, intriguing, interesting, & educational...  this is about all I can say since I haven't seen it in a long time.  It's good enough that I came to Amazon looking to buy it because I remembered how much I liked... but it's out of print :(  Soooo I'm really hoping the powers that be decide to reissue it sometime soon.",960595200,6,851,3.9940828402366866
7832518,5,6302961548,"This movie has captivated me ever since I first saw it when I was in the seventh grade.  Now a college student, I appreciate it even more for its truthfulness about the era and the story it can tell to new generations.  I  definitely recommend it to anyone who can get their hands on it... I'm only  disappointed that it is currently not being produced, because I need  another copy - I wore mine out!",954720000,6,401,4.293333333333333
