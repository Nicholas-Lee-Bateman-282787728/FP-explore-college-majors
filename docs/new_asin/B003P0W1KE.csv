4162574,5,B003P0W1KE,"This movie touched me and I have told so many people about it.  As a librarian, I really believe in the power of reading.  As the daughter of very elderly parents, I could so appreciate the story.  I saw it on Christmas Eve and it was just the right sort of uplifting thing to experience at that time, when all the old ways of celebrating the holidays have ended in our lives.",1339891200,4,376,4.194444444444445
4162575,4,B003P0W1KE,"( This is a review of the Standard DVD version of this release.)

Remember - in the 1970s and 1980s - when French actor Gerard Depardieu was a French ""matinee idol""? Okay he wasn't ""small"" in stature but you would never consider him large. Well time passes and the actor (with almost 275 films to his credit ) is older and much larger now. But he still has that innocent face, and, in his early 60s, is still making fine films.

This low-keyed film matches Depardieu with 97-year old French actress Gisele Casadesus as an unlikely pair who meet one day in a park (literally) counting the pigeons. Depardieus's character, Germain, is a hard worker (he cultivates fruits and vegetables to sell at outdoor markets) but was a slow learner in school and can hardly read. His newly found bench mate is articulate and an avid reader and - through reading aloud to Germain - she brings a whole new world to him. Director Jean Becker uses an interesting technique to show us how the words (such as those in Camus' ""The Stranger"") come to life in Germain's mind.

The 83 minutes of this film go by quickly as we are drawn into the story and the actors (both veterans) make us feel for their relationship, knowing that, at age 97, Margueritte has only so much time to read. The ending is sweet and will put a tear in your eye.

My only fault in this DVD (which has no supplemental material except the theatrical trailer) is that the subtitles are in white text and are often difficult to read when the background is also white or in pale colors. (Subtitles work best when they are in green or a contrasting color or shown below the image.)

I can certainly recommend this to Depardieu fans, those who like French films or avid readers who love the printed word.

4162576,4,B003P0W1KE,"A sweet trifle of a film, taken to a deeper and richer level by two outstanding performances.

Gerard Depardieu, in what must be his 6,000th film still feels fresh and alive as the overweight,
under educated and well meaning laborer who can hardly read, and who strikes up a chance
friendship with the 94 year old Margueritte, played with amazing delicacy and life force by the
wonderful Gisele Casadesus, who was an astounding 95 herself when this was made.  Oh that
we all should live so long with such grace.

Marguritte begins reading to the quasi-literate Germain, who finds his interest in reading sparked,
and with it an expanded sense of self.  He even finds himself falling in love (in a chaste almost
childlike way) with the still beautiful Margueritte.

Simplistic, sure, sentimental, undoubtedly.  But much like Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman in
`Driving Miss Daisy' these two actors give performances that make you want to forgive anything
that might otherwise feel trite or too on the nose (e.g. the very literal flashbacks to Germain's childhood).

Not quite a great film, but a charming, sweet, life-affirming and very human one.",1330732800,,1147,5.005263157894737

4162578,5,B003P0W1KE,"Gerard Depardieu is back...and this time in a sensitive, enchanting film about the beauty of a friendship between a nearly illiterate man and an elderly woman with a deep affection for books.  Sitting on a park bench watching the pigeons play and interact, the woman - elegant, wise, but going blind - senses the honest heart of the man beside her, the character played by Depardieu. She warms up to him and vice versa.  They end up loving each other, but not in the conventional way.  She reads books aloud to him and finds out that he is an especially good listener.

It's not just about the love of books, it's about the love of loves. In an age where too many movies celebrate violence and sex, this is a gentle change of pace. And let me add that Giselle Casadesus - who plays the lead character - is a sensation.",1318550400,99,818,4.397350993377484

This is not saccharine in the least- subtle, utterly natural.  The lady in question, Margueritte, is reserved and formal, but they click, and form a friendship that will transform both their lives.  The glimpses of French village life and the countryside, the interactions of the townfolk, and most of all Depardieu, along with those close to him, are a delight.

I normally don't enjoy movies from start to finish, finding a lot of the modern cinema to be unacceptably vulgar and downright boring. The last movie I was able to tolerate in its entirety starred K. Hepburn. But even the sexual references in this film are so well done and uncommonly meek that it's difficult to be offended at all.

Candid, raw and tender rolled into one - it's a splendid ""feel good"" movie demonstrating multi-faceted aspects of true selfless love triumphing over abuse, scorn, ridicule and rejection.

As to its ""NR"", in 2017 USA it warrants a PG-13 for vulgar and fowl language, violence (very brief and not superfluous to the plot) and 2 adult intercourse situations devoid of nudity.  Don't let this dissuade one from watching the film.  The positive influences far outweigh the negative, which can mostly be attributed to the cultural differences between France and my conservative Christian beliefs.  By what I prefer not to see or hear in movies, I'd give it an R.

Because it is in French, some of the benefit of viewing the actors is taken away if one is busy trying to follow the dialogue, and the actors speak very fast!!  Depardeux's face, tone, and gestures are what make him such a fine actor, so at least two viewings of the film might increase one's pleasure of it.",1484438400,,519,4.548387096774194

4162692,5,B003P0W1KE,"This is a lovely movie.  The ending brought tears to my eyes.  And as nuts as Depardieu behaves in real life, he performs in this movie with such amazing tenderness and sensibility mixed with confusion as his life changes in subtle and profound ways.  This is a movie well worth seeing.  The movie is subtitled.

in summary, Depardieu plays the part of the village idiot who never finished school and has no use for books.  he also suffered a childhood of abuse, ignorance and humiliation.  He is a big man, clumsy, simple minded yet kind and generous.  He meets a little, frail old lady in the park who glows with gentility and kindness and she introduces him to her world of books, literature and education.  He takes to it like a fish to water, displaying a natural instinct for comprehending ideas and poetry that he never dreamt existed, far less that he could think of grasping.  With her gentle encouragement, a different world opens for him and he finds he thirsts for learning and sits up at night reading books. In the end, the old lady finds herself homeless and Depardieu happily welcomes her, and her books, into his home.",1483488000,,1135,4.63

Both did an excellent job. Watching the verbal abuse he put up with from his friends, you had to wonder why he considered them friends. The surprise was his mother and how her awful behavior towards him for his entire life contrasted with the love she had for him that was revealed at her death. This film has subtitles, but I didn't find that distracting because the actors' expressions and delivery of lines kept you engrossed in what was happening.

Two things distracted:  Depardieu was 62 at filming and his girlfriend 30 years younger!  And in a country that finds older women attractive. The other was his weight -- I was very sad to see him struggle for breath and mobility, so it was hard to believe he was making babies with the the young woman.  Other than those distractions from the main story of his mother issues and growing friendship with Margueritte, it was a good film.  Come to think of it, the character of his young girlfriend wasn't really necessary.",1482537600,,628,4.603603603603603

Yes, there is conflict but without the sadistic overtones that make American characterizations warped.  Depardieu is quite comfortable in the role of the plus sized village oaf and its satisfying to see his grace emerge as his intellectual confidence is encouraged.

4162736,4,B003P0W1KE,"When I saw the title, I thought this might be a sort of French facsimile of Tuesdays with Morrie. It does have some of those ingredients-- an unsuspecting subject gleans much wisdom from a philosophizing senior nearing the end of life. But here the philosopher with the wisdom is the unbeauteous, mocked, shamed, and abused Germain (Gerard Depardieu), a sweet, skilled, very insecure handyman.  He meets the lovely 90+ wisp of a woman with an expansive heart and mind, Margueritte( Gisele Casadesus), on a park bench, where he generally hangs out with his pigeons, all named by him.  Margueritte, sharing her love of reading (even Camus), and he, being brave enough to listen and learn, become devoted friends. Germain is already a lyrical soul with an obvious aptitude for turning a phrase.  Even in lovemaking, with his sweet Annette (Sophie Guillemin), he hatches a sensual line or 2 that will live in the annals. But I'll let you happen upon that moment. The rest is to be seen. The photography is well done; the story is winning, the acting solid, as is the directing by Jean Becker.  The film is uplifting and a smart lesson about bullying and the bullied.

4162744,4,B003P0W1KE,"This French film with English subtitles has much to offer viewers. It is at times sad but is ultimately uplifting. Gerard Depardieu plays the lead character and is excellent in the role of Germain, who, as an adult, still endures the emotional abuse and disparagement of his mother, his teachers, and those around him.  His afternoon encounters with Margarite on a park bench enlarge both their worlds; he learns the power of words written by great writers like Camus, she gains a new friend, and viewers learn the harms of stereotypes and discrimination. The surprise ending shows us what a true friendship is.",1478563200,,611,4.932038834951456
4162745,5,B003P0W1KE,"A story of redemption and renewal that was terrifically powerful. An unbelievable performance by Depardieu in the hero's transformation from abused child/adult to father to be, worthy partner to Annette, son to Margueritte, and into the man that he could have been but was prevented from being by Margueritte. I particularly admired the way that the story was brought to a climax by the juxtaposition of various story threads in a truly believable fashion.

The French was very clear and easy to understand. The subtitles were very helpful to my unfacile knowledge of French.

Based on the book which just was translated from French to English: SOFT IN THE HEAD by Marie-Sabine Roger.  Well worth a read.  And then viewing the film again.

Typically French film style of focusing on why we have our valued relationships and/or friendships.

4162843,5,B003P0W1KE,"Grard Depardieu and Gisle Casadesus portray their roles as Germain and Margueritte flawlessly.  This lovely French movie is based on the book ""La Tte en friche"" by Marie-Sabine Roger and first published in 2008, then released to English-reading audiences with the 2016 title ""Soft in the Head.""  The movie does not stray from the book.

The story is about Germain, an unwanted and unloved child borne from a one-night stand. He never learned to read and write properly, and his image as the village idiot wore on him so strongly that he never dared venture away from that.  He never knew his own potential until by chance he meets Margueritte in the town park, as she's reading a book while watching pigeons.  Pigeons are also a passion for Germain, who counts them and names them and can tell Margueritte each bird's personality.

Margueritte awakens in Germain a passion for learning.  Margueritte reads passages from Camus and encourages Germain to think about what he had read.  She treats him as her equal.  Both, afterall, are outcasts:  she for being too old, he for being a simpleton. A strong friendship develops.

The only difference between the book and this film is the younger portrayal of Germain's girlfriend Annette, portrayed by Sophie Guillemin.  She looks easily 30 years Germain's junior in this movie.

The movie, like the book, is shown in alternating flashbacks.  Germain's mother is not a very likeable women, but we don't understand why until the very end.  There's a nice twist here that is the real lesson of this movie, which I won't give away.  There is some cussing but no graphic sex scenes.

The entire movie is set in the French village of Pons in the Poitou-Charents regions of central-coastal France.",1464307200,15,1735,4.886986301369863

4162912,5,B003P0W1KE,"Review of content only.

Germain Chazes (Grard Depardieu) is good with plants but not so good with words. A gauche handyman, unloved by his mother, he has never been able to read with ease. One day in the park feeding the pigeons he meets an old lady, Margueritte, immersed in a book. And so begins a beautiful relationship.

This enchanting French film charms the viewer as only European film-makers know how. Depardieu is really too old for the part but he carries the whole thing off magnificently and Gisle Casadesus - even at 90-something - shows a well-turned ankle as well as considerable empathy. If, like me, it's the happy moments in movies that make you cry rather than the sad ones, I would suggest keeping a box of tissues close by.",1457049600,,745,4.636363636363637

4163040,5,B003P0W1KE,"Others have provided a good plot outline. I am going to provide some personal observations about the film and how it touched me personally. What touches me may or may not have the same effect on you.

The story is a gentle unfolding or personal growth and unlocking the person within. It is also about how one can live their life guided by assumptions that turn out to be wrong. Finally, it emphasizes how chance encounters of events - or even an innocuous conversation with a stranger can set your one life (or theirs) on an entirely new course.

On a personal level, all of the above have been part of my life. That is why I found the story to be touching. But this is also entertainment, and in that respect there are multiple back stories happening. There are flashbacks to Depardieu's character, Germain's, youth and dysfunctional upbringing, which explains his current interactions with his mother. As the story unfolds the reality of the son-mother relationship comes into sharp focus. That, to me is a lesson if the perils of making assumptions.

Another back story is Germain's relationship with his girlfriend, and how he matures through his interactions with Margueritte whose patience and nature inspire Germain to be the person he was capable of being (despite being thought of as not too bright - the village idiot of sorts).

All of the above and even more minor back stories - vignettes actually - weave into a surprisingly complex tapestry of emotions and relationships. That is one of the reasons why I have watched this movie at least five times. Each time I catch something new. Each time I come away with new feelings and thoughts.

This is not an action film, and what comedy it contains is subtle at best.  In fact, the entire film is subtle and exceptionally well acted. I found every character and plot device to be believable, and experienced the full spectrum of emotions throughout the film. If you love feel-good movies this is one I highly recommend.",1445644800,25,1980,4.75801749271137

4163086,4,B003P0W1KE,"Very well done, charming, ending delightful, not clean sexually.

First, applaud the 2 main actors, Gerard Depardieu and, I believe the older woman was Gisele Casadesus, who was so very delightful.

In French, with Subtitles. A relationship, friendship film about a man who is considered by some something like the village idiot and an elderly, educated lady he meets in a park and who begins to read books to him. Both of them, especially Depardieus character, has a complicated backstory involving neglect and emotional abuse by his still living mother. Depardieu' s character and Casadesus' s character each give to the other something they need and their deepening friendship is both cute and touching.

Won't spoil the ending but it is worth the slower parts of the film to get to the end, very, very heartwarming. Please don't give up on this film. Some parts seemed a little slow but I, for one, enjoy slower relational films.

I am a Christian and was not pleased with the sexual relationship portrayed in the film but it was realistic and non-graphic. Nothing was openly shown clearly on-screen but two very, very short scenes were obvious in what Depardieu and his unmarried partner were doing and they certainly talked about having sex. Therefore, certainly not a film for youngsters. It is, unfortunately, not possible to fast forward these scenes and still have a relevant understanding of the characters lives and struggles. None of it was gratuitous however. I know many of my peers would not be ok with this film for this reason. Just don't watch it.

I rated it R for sexual content, I did not look at the actual rating, but it's probably R. As for stars, I say 4 out of 5. The ending made me both laugh and cry.",1440547200,4,1729,4.75

4163115,3,B003P0W1KE,"A french man who grew up without support at school or home, not even knowing his father, makes his way in the world doing menial jobs where he can and continuing to be taken advantage of by most around him--they definitely make fun of him. Even though most would grow up to be mean and bitter he is a kind soul. He happens upon an elderly woman who gets him hooked on reading. He starts to learn as she is a kind soul as well. Anyway you get to see how his life was growing up through flash backs.

Over all a cute story. But there are some weird parts to it. I mean how does a guy that comes across mentally retarded almost get a beautiful young woman to sleep with him and want to have his baby? I think the perversion and clout of the lead actor had something to do with that. Just doesn't fit. Also what doesn't fit his is vulgar talk about he has sex with the young woman. She sets it right when she says,"" . . . I don't like to talk about it."" Again it really doesn't fit. Yes it is shows his naivete. Yes it shows his ""innocence"" and lack of social graces which fits into the overall character but something like that just cheapens the movie actually. Doesn't belong. The ending was just thrown together. Of course we know what will happen but it would be nice to see all of them together . . . the old and new  . . . a family. The last scene just doesn't do it. Also I find the one spot of violence just too much. Again it ruins the movie, for me. We can piece together what happens without seeing blood and stabbings, ""hearing"" them. But I do like the way European films still take the time to show people living life without dancing on the table tops with their skirts over their heads. If people in the US were shown movies like this often they would say they were ""boring"". It is life. It is art.",1438905600,,1808,4.090140845070422

What an example on both sides, he appreciating her company.
It reminded of the movie MRS PELFREY GOES TO THE CLAIREMONT.
Movies such as these give us a reason to grow old.

4163136,5,B003P0W1KE,"A sweet and and heart tugging movie about two lonely people connecting with one another, taking time to talk and to listen, and learning to trust one another.  It is a beautiful old fashioned story revealing how ones age is not what matters, it is our gifts and how we use them that

I loved this movie for it's honesty and non frilly depiction of real people and how they make real connections, no matter their age or their position in life.  It shows that the human connection transgresses age and gender and that we all need to feel useful and important
no matter where we are in our life's journey. This may be a strange parallel, but just as in ""The Book Thief"" it points out the power of books, how they enrich our lives in a myriad of ways.  It is funny, honest, smart and shows life at its best. The acting was superb and the script was witty and thoughtful.  I found this movie by accident as I was looking for something ""different"" (non-violent, no profanity, and not filled with meaningless sex )(I know, a tall order!:(  I'm so glad I watched it to the end.  The lessons I took away:  We can find friends in the strangest of places,  and if we would chance opening up to a stranger we might find someone who truly cares about us. Maybe we should stop walking through life like little turtles (afraid to stick our necks out lest we are mocked or hurt).

4163158,5,B003P0W1KE,"Gerard Depardieu is completely believable as Germain, an aging handyman whose pleasant veneer hides inner sadness and regret. A chance conversation with Marguerite on a park bench leads to a friendship and a redemption of sorts. Marguerite teaches Germain to read. More accurately, she builds his self-confidence so that he eventually remembers that he knows how and becomes brave enough to give it another go. We discover that Germain was raised by a single mother who made his childhood a torture. As Germain's self-confidence grows his relationships change - his friends say he is ""smarter"" and the love which sparks between Germain and Marguerite also benefits his relationship with his longtime girlfriend. There is a sweet innocence to the characters, genuine affection in Germain's friendships, and a sad but believable tragedy in the form of Germain's anguished and abusive mother. The movie may appear a bit syrupy at the end, but I found it satisfying and felt a renewed sense of hope in the power of love to transform and restore damaged people.",1436832000,,1056,5.109826589595376

4163232,4,B003P0W1KE,"This movie can be viewed as the light-hearted story of an uneducated man, whose possibly slightly autistic, who meets a gentle elderly lady on a park bench. But there are depths to all the characters that make this movie quite a humanistic joy to explore. The main character is uneducated and declares his thoughts with brutal honesty but palatable kindness (""The distant between you and your mother is only in your mind"" - quite an insightful pronouncement). His girlfriend understands him with unwavering devotion. His friends, aware of his limitations, are more dependent on his kindness and honesty than they realize. The elderly woman he meets at the park is as quick witted as he is uneducated and they immediately form a deep bond - two people living with their limitations in a world that doesn't understand their worth.
At one point, he's describing the relationship he has with his mother (the basic crux of the entire movie and consequently his life) and she states, without the love of a mother the rest of the world is open to you. A point that is driven home by the rest of the cast.
This movie and cast were amazing, but left me wishing they had developed the characters a little more. It would have been totally worthwhile to sit for another hour because the writers touched upon so many elements but all too briefly giving a sweeping impression. My point exemplified by the relationship with his mother, there is one point where she defends him indicating what her true character was. Then to the end, where information is given that is gone over too quickly.

Mr. Depardieu is an actor of extraordinary talent and range. I adore him in most things but he seemed to be sleepwalking through this performance. The France pictured in this movie has all the charm of an afternoon in Scranton, PA, no offense intended. It just has nothing special that would warrant spending time indoors watching a screen. The pathetic movie extra that shows the making of the film says all that is needed. The director cries at his own comments, he is so filled with emotion.

In fact, in his 50s he's still living on her property, and the mom is still as means and sadistic as always, however, the man meets an elderly woman who becomes somewhat a surrogate mother figure for the man..and well, you'll have to see the rest of the movie to see what happens...",1430006400,,715,4.343283582089552

More complex but not overplayed is the fact that Depardieu's character struggled with self esteem issues stemming from the learning difficulties he had as a child; completely avoidable if the people in his life (the bullying teacher) and his mother would have shown an ounce of understanding and patience. In fact he was significantly intelligent and good with words, which he expressed beautifully in one scene after making love w/his very sweet girlfriend. But he himself is flustered when certain processes of learning are put in front of him. (I could really relate to this!)  You get why his muh younger and very pretty girlfriend is in love with him and you get why he falters as his buddies at the local tavern poke fun at his expense. When he begins taking an interest in reading, it's through hearing Margueritte as they share a park bench and go through various literature over time. He still lives at home (on the property in a trailer out back) with his beastly Mom, whose health is now failing but flash backs of their lives and his childhood provide a glimpse into their stormy relationship, and this: for a brief moment after a man she was dating slaps her son, she went after him with a pitchfork. Momentarily, even if Depardieu (the child) didn't understand it, the viewer gets to see it and as she is not a lovable character, feel just a little bit more for her than before. See the movie if you like films that aren't too heavy but with the right amount of substance and heart and of course if you enjoy foreign films like I do (assuming you don't speak French) this one is very good.",1427673600,,1737,4.621359223300971

This relationship grows, Germain discovers reading on his own, and finds he has potential to learn and expand his world.

4163333,4,B003P0W1KE,"We chose this movie to review for my son's high school French class. The relationship between the main characters is anticipated, but very touching. It hits on several levels of how relationships (especially that of parent/child) influence many aspects of a person's life and how an encouraging stranger-come friend can impact one's life greatly as well. There is definitely coarse language in this movie and some explicit sexual references, but since it is in French, you have to read them to catch what's being said if you don't know French. Of course, some scenes in any language tell the story. There are multiple bad relationships between men and women in this movie, so beware of that before you watch it if viewing with students.",1418256000,2,736,4.943548387096774

They form a deep friendship,  spending afternoons together reading aloud on a bench in the park. From there a journey ensues changing both of their lives forever.

Depardieu's relationship with his
mother was not the best in that movie. -It was somewhat
like mother and I, in the beginning- An absent
father, lasted only 5 minutes. :-) Yes, but, it made him
stronger. Strong enough for him to muster enough
courage to rescue Margueritte from that Nursing Home and
take her home. I watched it twice already. The movie
painted the last five years of mother's life. Mother
passed away on February 24, last year.

It's a bit biased, because Depardieu is one my favorite
French actors. Highly recommend to any Alzheimer's
caregivers out there.

If you have watched a lot of movies with Gerard Depardieu you will be tickled and amused by his performance here.

Margueritte (Gisele Casadesus) goes to the park each day to read, think and watch the pigeons.  There are 19 of them.  Another pigeon-admirer  (Gerard Depardieu) visits so often, he has named the pigeons.  Depardieu is the village joke.  His mother calls him an oaf.  He never learned to read and does odd jobs around the village.  The villagers like him but don't respect him.

Margueritte meets him, and both likes and respects him.  They talk about pigeons, their lives and Margueritte introduces Depardiue to Albert Camus and other novels.  She awakens in him, through her love for literature and books, an appreciation for learning, too.  Suddenly, at the cafe with his friends, Depardieu's character is using bigger words, and saying smarter things.  He is no longer a joke, he's an enigma.

Watching the relationship of these two characters unfold and deepen is a delight.  I love buoyant tales like this when magic occurs in ordinary ways which enrich lives.  Performances by both actors are strong - it doesn't seem like acting.  The other characters and situations are fun.

4163422,5,B003P0W1KE,"La tte en friche is a beautiful little French film based on the book by Marie-Sabine Roger and adapted for the screen by Jean-Loup Dabadie and director Jean Becker. A tale of an unexpected life change that occurs when an incidental meeting on a park bench brings together an illiterate lonely man with an elderly woman whose best friends are her books in the isolation of old age, this is truly a story of transformation and a definition of pure love.

Germain Chazes (G&eacute;rard Depardieu) grew up in an unwanted home, the brunt of teachers and classmates because they considered him illiterate, and now he is forced to lead a hand to mouth existence in a house trailer close to his now elderly, crass, alcoholic mother who still loathes him. He supports himself with odd jobs and by selling the vegetables he grows in his small garden. One day he visits his lunch spot - a park bench where he has named the 19 pigeons as his only real friends - and there he meets a very properly dressed elderly woman named Margueritte (two t `s because her father didn't know how to spell!) played by Gis&egrave;le Casadesus, who spends her days reading Camus, Proust, and other French classics aloud. They bond - Germain shares his pigeons' names and Margueritte introduces him in the most gentle manner to the joy of reading. Every day thereafter the two meet and Margueritte reads to Germain to the extent that Germain decides to learn to read despite his advanced years. Margueritte's influence changes Germain's outlook and response to the world and the ending, while sad on one level, is uplifting.

Both Depardieu and Casadesus are remarkable in their roles, never becoming caricatures but blossoming into completely warm and memorable people.

The story is very simple. Germain (Gerard Depardieu) lives in the country side with his mom who is old and start showing symptoms of dementia. He is a sort of handyman for the entire village. He is almost illiterate and has problems reading. One day while going to the park he meets an old lady (Margueritte ""avec deux t"", Gisle Casadesus). Margueritte is really old and lives in a hospice just outside the village. She is losing her sight slowly. A friendship grows between the two of them while Margueritte reads to Germain every day. And Germain is slowly transformed and wants to become a reader too. Is he going to succeed? What is going to happen to the fragile Margueritte? What is going to happen to Germain's mother? You need to watch the movie to the very end to see what will happen. And don't go away, wait for the poem...

They meet on a city park bench and begin to talk. Germain has been treated cruelty his whole life by a selfish mother who still survives. Germain believes he cannot read; actually, he can read but lacks the needed self-confidence. Margueritte begins to read to him -- The Plague by Camus -- and he is enthralled.

4163447,4,B003P0W1KE,"A sweet trifle of a film, taken to a deeper and richer level by two outstanding performances.

Gerard Depardieu, in what must be his 6,000th film still feels fresh and alive as the overweight,
under educated and well meaning laborer who can hardly read, and who strikes up a chance
friendship with the 94 year old Margueritte, played with amazing delicacy and life force by the
wonderful Gisele Casadesus, who was an astounding 95 herself when this was made. Oh that
we all should live so long with such grace.

Marguritte begins reading to the quasi-literate Germain, who finds his interest in reading sparked,
and with it an expanded sense of self. He even finds himself falling in love (in a chaste almost
childlike way) with the still beautiful Margueritte.

Simplistic, sure, sentimental, undoubtedly. But much like Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman in
`Driving Miss Daisy' these two actors give performances that make you want to forgive anything
that might otherwise feel trite or too on the nose (e.g. the very literal flashbacks to Germain's childhood).
