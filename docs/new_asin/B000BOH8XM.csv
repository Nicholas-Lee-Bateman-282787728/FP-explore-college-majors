2433009,5,B000BOH8XM,"Everyone wrote great reviews already.
Karen's teaching is more of an aerobics style... she only talks about muscles, how it's stretched or being strengthened & uses only anatomy terms. If you're looking for mind/body, you won't find it here.
The Yoga Stretch 20 min  - it's just her & another woman on a simple stage. What I LOVE is the Engima style music (Shanay Mystic Trance"" by Shastro) that's got a good beat too keep you going & interested, but light enough to not distract from her teaching. It has yoga poses, great shoulder & leg openers I don't normally see, but it's not a flowing style. It still stretches you out well & does flow in terms of what muscles should be stretched next. Starts with simple shoulder stretch behind the back, hip opener stretches, sitting wide angle single leg side bends, sitting wide angle bend, sitting fwd bend both & single legs, twisted sage pose, bound sitting pose & ends w/reclined simple spinal twist.
Yoga Strength 30 min - same set, no carpet, has a lot of sun salutations mostly a lot of downward dog & upward dog at first, then emphasis on repeated chair pose, then side plank, 1 leg downward dog & warrior 1 repeated, triangle, half moon, standing wide leg fwd bend, pyramid (hamstring stretch), revolved triangle, dancer's, boat w/added pilates leg lifts, bridge & ends with knee to chest stretch.
The yoga
That it has a powerful 30 min with a diff kind of sun salutations, etc. with great hip openers & poses I don't normally see on my other 30 power or vinyasa yoga dvds.
Her teaching is perfect, not hurried, not too slow, not too detailed, nor not too quiet. Her pace is slow, but you always know because it's harder to go in & out of poses slower & the challenge is to do it as graceful & as much body awareness as possible.
This will really challenge many people, even I had to hit the pause button a few times, but that's what a DVD is for.

2433010,5,B000BOH8XM,"Karen Voight does NOT PLAY AROUND. If you're looking for an easy breezy feel-good yoga experience, look elsewhere. This workout will kick your everlovin' behind. If you're not already pretty flexible and in pretty good shape, you might want to save this video until you are. If you think you're up for the challenge, prepare to get a great workout that will have you sweating even as you're being perfectly still. If you can do all of these poses half as fluidly as she can, you'll get seriously toned up and improve your flexibility. Oh, and Karen Voight's amazingly long and lovely body is great inspiration for those of us who need a little inspiration through all the huffing and puffing. Let's just say that ""Yoga Power"" is a workout that I'm working toward.",1156636800,12,763,4.701492537313433
2433011,4,B000BOH8XM,"Karen Voight's YOGA POWER is really two yoga workouts in one: Yoga Strength, which utilizes a number of challenging yoga poses to build strength and stamina; and Yoga Stretch, which consists of a series of gentle stretches to increase flexibility.

The Yoga Strength segment is 30 minutes long, but you'll be so focused on the poses that the time will fly by.  This workout definitely isn't for beginners!  I've been doing yoga - on my own - for a few years now, and consider myself an intermediate, but some of the poses are much too challenging for me.  Even following Karen's workout partner, who is the modifier, I have trouble balancing during unfamiliar poses.  However, none of the exercises is impossible; I'm confident that, with practice, I'll be able to master them.  The poses that Karen guides you through in Yoga Strength include Sun Salutation, Warrior 1 and 2, Upward Dog, Downward Dog, Down Dog Split, the Triangle Series, Plank, Side Plank, Awkward Chair, Dancer's Pose, and Boat Pose.

In contrast, at 20 minutes, the Yoga Stretch segment is slightly shorter.  Unlike Yoga Strength, it's also suitable for all fitness/skill levels.  The poses, performed primarily while sitting on the floor, are very gentle and forgiving.  With Karen's help, you'll slowly stretch and relax all the body parts you worked in the first segment: your neck, shoulders, arms, back, hips, thighs, and legs.  It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that the neck stretches are simply divine!  My only complaint with this portion of the workout is that some of Karen's instructions are a little sloppy and confusing.  Overall, though, this is an anomaly: for the most part, Karen is an excellent instructor.

As far as necessary equipment, you'll need either a carpeted floor or a yoga mat, as well as two yoga blocks (but you can make do with one block, if that's all you have on hand).  A yoga strap is optional for the Yoga Stretch segment.

Enjoy your workout!",1155686400,6,1957,4.867069486404834
2433012,5,B000BOH8XM,I just recieved this yoga dvd and I love it.  There are many poses that just aren't in other yoga dvd's.  The flow of this workout is smooth and offers a strong routine.  I would highly recomend this to anyone who already has a background in yoga and is looking for a great workout.,1143763200,6,282,4.185185185185185
2433013,5,B000BOH8XM,"This is one of my favorite yoga workouts ever.  The DVD is split into two sections - Yoga Strength and Yoga Stretch.  The first section is a 30 minute power yoga routine that completely revamps traditional vinyasas creating an incredibly creative, fun, and challenging workout that flows like mad.  Karen warms you up with downward dog and plank postures before transitioning into a modified forward bend, back extension, and chair pose series.  This mini sun salutation segment flows into standing splits, lunges, and side plank work.  Karen then moves into an inventive warrior and triangle pose series that gracefully incorporates back bends and shoulder stretches all while actively demonstrating the use of yoga blocks to ensure proper form.  The segment ends with one balancing pose (dancers), some ab work in boat pose, and a relaxing bridge.

My complaints about the power yoga segment are few but worth noting.  While I appreciate Karen's incorporation of yoga blocks (she and her yoga partner both use them throughout the workout rather than relegating them to their accustomed role as modifiers) anyone with yoga experience (and this is NOT a workout for beginners) will find them a bit excessive.  I love the assistance of a yoga block when doing reverse triangle but I can go a lot deeper and get more out of regular triangle without one.  I also wish Karen did more balancing and back bend work.  Because of their lack I alternate this workout with more traditional/spiritual practices to balance my body.  Nonetheless, I reach for this yoga workout more than any other I have because it remains motivating and entertaining even after doing it for 4 or 5 years.

The yoga stretch segment is 25 minutes (the DVD menu claims its 20 minutes long) of intense stretching done on the floor.  I love this calming workout.  While many of the stretches are yoga based or inspired this is really more of a pure stretch routine than a yoga practice.  Karen does some stretches I've never seen before like an incredibly intense and effective quadriceps stretch and a shoulder stretch that targets right below the shoulder blade, exactly where I seem to store all my tension.  When you complete this workout your entire body feels soothed and relaxed, a bit like jello.  It's hard to convince yourself to stand back up and not go right to sleep.

I often do the stretch routine independently when I feel I need an extended cool down after an intensive workout or I'm just a bit tight or stressed.  However, my favorite use of this DVD is to begin a workout with the Yoga Strength segment, then do my cardio/strength training for the day, and wrap up with Yoga Stretch.  I feel quite accomplished when done.

I highly recommend this DVD for those interested in a new twist on yoga or for those who find themselves impatient with the meditative and spiritual aspects of traditional yoga.  IF YOU ARE NEW TO YOGA DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS WORKOUT!!  You'll probably hurt yourself (particularly your wrists in the many plank poses) if you do not yet have the strength and flexibility yoga develops and power yoga requires.  Karen's Yoga Sculpt is a less vigorous power yoga workout and is probably a better bet for beginners though I would still not recommend attempting it if you are not physically fit.",1142035200,66,3295,4.83065953654189
2433014,5,B000BOH8XM,"The stretching segment on this DVD makes an awesome cooldown after a cardio or strength training workout and is also great on its own at the end of a stressful day.

The yoga segment is quick and challenging and a good workout, even if you are in pretty good shape. I appreciate that about all of Karen's yoga videos. You can start them as a beginner but still feel challenged by it after using it for years. (I use beginner to mean someone who is athletic, but has not done yoga practice before or has not worked out much recently - I don't know what she would be like for someone who was starting to exercise for the first time.) I have used this video and Yogasculpt in addition to others to get back in shape after three pregnancies and I love them both. Also if you are one of those people who feels hesitant to try yoga because you do not want to incorporate the meditation/Eastern religious aspect, than Karen is a great instructor for you because the practice is really just exercise.",1246492800,,992,4.391304347826087
2433015,3,B000BOH8XM,"These are quite good yoga routines, but they are the same two that appear on the ""Slim Physique"" (aka ""Sleek Physique"") DVD. That title also has a series of aerobic and strength workouts and has been one of my favorites for over five years.

2433016,5,B000BOH8XM,"Karen Voight always creates amazing workouts and this DVD is no exception. This DVD has two intermediate workouts. The set is simple with wood floors and copper colored mats.

In the first ""Yoga Strength"" routine, she masterfully leads you through a series of flowing poses designed to test your strength and balance. You may need a yoga block but I found you could do all the exercises without one.

The exercises in the first section include: Child's Pose, Downward Facing Dog, Plank (you lower to this from downward facing dog and then go straight down to the floor - tests your upper body strength), Half Cobra, Sun Salutations, Chair Pose, Warrior I, Upward Facing Dog, Triangle Pose, Warrior II and Boat Pose. You hold the poses for just enough time to break out into a sweat without hardly moving.

In the second ""Yoga Stretch"" routine, Karen Voight brings a sense of calm and clarity to your day. In this section you lengthen your muscles and stretch out the spine. This workout is done on a Persian carpet and the music is especially calming. Karen takes your body through a full range of stretches that feel nurturing and healing.

I enjoyed doing both the workouts in one day but you can do them on alternating days if you wish.

2433017,5,B000BOH8XM,"I love the Karen Voight YOGA POWER DVD. I use some of her other yoga DVD's, and it is difficult to find anything else that gives you that kind of work out. It is a great workout. For anyone that thinks yoga is easy, this will truly challenge them. I highly recommend it.",1201392000,,270,4.113207547169812
2433018,3,B000BOH8XM,"suitable for a beginner to explore their abilities, but lacking in technical instruction.

Both routines are pleasant and refreshing to do.  Each has, for its length, a nice selection of poses that gently activate every part of you. KV takes you from an introduction to the most basic  movements of simple salutations, through a short standing sequence, which surprisingly culminates in an intermediate level Revolved Triangle and Cosmic Dancer (the latter very unusual for a beginner's DVD) on each side.  You then finish with an interesting boat sequence to remind you of your abs!

For a curious beginner, each session will allow you to identify your level of ability and build up some feel for the poses before progressing to longer and more challenging practices.  However, if your goal is to learn yoga techniques (as opposed to just wanting to work out), be aware that KV doesn't always name the asanas and, in one case, actually misnames one of the standing poses.  Additionally, although the strength, stamina and flexibility rating is low and therefore seems geared for beginners, there's very little instruction regarding placement, alignment and breathing.

For a practiced yogi/exerciser the thirty five minute `Strength' routine doesn't really require very much strength at all and the twenty five minute `Stretch' doesn't really go too deep but does loosen you up. Even doing one after the other doesn't really require much stamina, but does provide a relaxing and refreshing `wake up' or `take it down' routine for those slightly off days.

Slightly dated feel to the styling but high quality picture and sound.  The instructor is pleasant and the instruction is clear.  Personally I prefer when instructors talk about `left' and `right' rather than the 'leg nearest to us' that KV uses, which doesn't work if you do your practice face-on to the screen (as opposed to side-on).",1196985600,2,1893,5.113636363636363
2433019,4,B000BOH8XM,"This yoga practice is a good workout. I find that having it split into two sections, one for the workout, and one for stretching is a great way to keep things fresh. Some mornings I do the workout, and then will do the stretch portion at the end of the day. The neck stretch in this DVD is good when you are stressed out. I don't get tired of the instructor and her style.",1194652800,,372,4.04054054054054
2433020,2,B000BOH8XM,"Although a good basic yoga video for beginners, the title is misleading.  There is no power associated with this video.",1181174400,,119,4.95
2433021,1,B000BOH8XM,"To Karen Voight: the music in Yoga Power was 1)inappropriate and 2) mixed way too high. I had trouble hearing the instructions because the music competes with your voice.  Also, you should NEVER use vocal music (wordless or not) when a video depends so heavily on constant coaching. And why does every yoga progam have to use Eastern music? (or any music at all?)

Note to prospective buyers: I prefer to practice yoga in as quiet a setting as possible. If others feel the same way, then DO NOT purchase this DVD.  Not only is the music too loud, it is incongruent with the poses. I greatly prefer yoga without music, with an instructor who has excellent vocabulary and has a very pleasant voice (Karen's voice is one of the best).

My other beef is the camera person having way too much fun moving the camera all over the place. Many times when I was trying to see particular poses or movements going in and out of poses, the camera was focused elsewhere.

I don't think it was too helpful having another person in the video, just another distraction.

Karen, after the stellar Yoga Sculpt program, you didn't need to change a thing. I am so sorry that you did.  In the future, I'm keeping my money.",1175731200,10,1200,4.502304147465438
2433022,3,B000BOH8XM,I was disappointed in the length of this practice.  The poses are pretty ordinary.  I use this one on days that I am feeling like I want to get a practice in but don't want to work too hard.,1171929600,,190,3.8461538461538463
2433023,5,B000BOH8XM,"This video is divided into two workouts: 1) Yoga Strength, a 30 minute routine and 2) Yoga Stretch, a 20 minute routine.  At first I was relunctant to purchase this DVD because I already own Yoga Sculpt.  But the poses are different enough that I find it to be extremely rewarding and challenging.  It quickly became one of my favorites.

The Yoga Strength segment is faster paced than other routines, but I like the flow and find that I can easily keep up.

Although the Yoga Stretch segment is shorter that doesn't mean it's easier.  Karen gently coaches your body into deep poses that are very effective.  When you're finished, you can feel it for the rest of the day.

You will definitely see an improvement in your posture and energy level if you do these routines on a regular basis.

8090225,4,B000BOH8XM,I never realized how difficult yoga was.  Since I enjoy jogging and swimming I thought I was in good shape.

8090227,1,B000BOH8XM,"I have done yoga at home with videos and in a studio for 12 years.  This video is a shoddy example of yoga instruction.  I am very glad that I borrowed it from the library instead of wasting my money.

1.  The videography is poor, and camera angles are sometimes very odd.  Karen is leading the instruction, and her assistant (who is doing the modified version of poses) is positioned with her back to the camera and behind Karen.  This makes it impossible to see what the modified version of any pose is, and is not at all helpful.
The sound is also insufficient, with the music being too loud to hear the instruction clearly.

2.  If you have any type of wrist problems, this is not a good video for you.  I have carpal tunnel, which causes some pain in my wrist and right hand.  I can usually do an Ashtanga Primary Series yoga practice without much trouble.  The first 5 minutes of the video were all poses that required bearing weight on the hands, with no breaks.  For example:  Plank to Upward Dog to Downward Dog and back to Plank.  I had to stop the first program because I couldn't handle the constant pressure and weight on my wrists.

Having read so many positive reviews, I was disappointed in this video.  I would strongly urge you to borrow it from the library before buying.",1305072000,2,1290,4.4025423728813555
8090228,4,B000BOH8XM,"I haven't done Yoga for a couple of years, but was in pretty good shape physically when I got this DVD.  I have to tell you, it kicked my butt!  I didn't have time for the full 50 minute workout, so I only did the first portion to build strength thru Yoga.  The next day, I thought I was going to die! My back and other muscles were all yelping!

The next time I worked out to the video, I made sure I had time for BOTH sections -- the strength training AND the Yoga Stretch routine.  It made all the difference.  I felt strong, stretched, toned, fit, and taller! I decided that for me, it was essential to perform both practices as one. If you don't have time to do both together -- at least take time after the strength Yoga to stretch your muscles -- particularly your back.

As for those who say they just do the stretching portion -- a word of caution.  These stretches should only be done with warmed up muscles. It would be good to use after a shorter cardio session or if you've done something a little strenuous first. To perform these stretches without warm-up may cause problems.

I've had this program for about a month and try to use this DVD at least twice aweek along with some of her other DVD's and I can see a REAL change in my body, my flexibility, my strength, my posture and my peace of mind. Ah Exercise!!",1289692800,,1327,4.213438735177865
