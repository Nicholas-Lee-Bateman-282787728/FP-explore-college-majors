2299424,4,B0009LDI22,"I saw this reviewed on the Nostalgia Critic and seriously couldn't stop laughing at how bad it was. I decided to buy it and experience the whole thing myself. It's horrible all the way around. Bad animation, HORRIBLE voice acting, ridiculously stupid story... you name it. It's bad. However, I found myself laughing at all the awkward moments and stupid things that the characters did. Honestly, I was entertained for reasons other than what were originally intended for this film. Pick it up if you want a good laugh. I couldn't give it 5 stars because it really is poorly made despite being strangely entertaining.",1388620800,,616,4.876190476190477
2299425,1,B0009LDI22,"On the 11th day of Christmas 2013 I'm going to review...The Christmas Tree. The animation is AWFUL this side of Foodfight. Infact,the facial expressions of the cast are creepy and lazy too. The voice-acting is poor and lazy. The story is crazy this side of Foodfight too. The message is baloney at best because it was just slapped in and they put no effort into it what so ever. I give this stinkburger a 0 out of 10.",1387843200,5,417,4.358974358974359
2299426,2,B0009LDI22,"A nice story but a very amateurish, cheap production..Even the voiceovers are weak.  The story is nice but the narration is so annoying and the voice of the ""bad woman"" is so annoying and she is so evil that I don't think it is a ""feel good"" Christmas show at all. Would not recommend it.",1355702400,,288,4.236363636363636
2299427,1,B0009LDI22,"I very rarely give reviews, but I thought I'd give a heads up to anyone considering this video/DVD. This ""cartoon"" is so terrible! Terrible animation, terrible voice ""talent"", and terrible characters that are unsuited for any kind of entertainment... especially for children. Just plain left us feeling YUCKY!!!",1354838400,2,311,5.5
2299428,5,B0009LDI22,"I loved this movie growing up! We had a recording of it on an old VHS that had gotten ruined in storage, and now I'm glad that I found it on DVD! I would watch this movie every December along with other Christmas classics. I'm excited to have this as part of my Christmas collection!",1291939200,6,283,4.163636363636364
2299429,2,B0009LDI22,"This video, which has very poor animation, is at times better than others, but is always very odd.  My children loved it for the crazy moments, but in my opinion it is a bit scary for 4 year olds but too stupid for 10-12 year olds, who can handle the villian with the chainsaw, etc.  For the laughs, my 10 and 12 year old want to keep it!!!",1290470400,2,340,3.985294117647059

8062949,4,B0009LDI22,"Honestly its a terrible movie, but my god is it hiliarously bad. I highly recommand it for fans of MST3K or as a gift to people who like so bad its good movies. Trust me its a special where you can laugh at Orphans on Christmas and not go to hell.",1511740800,,247,3.8627450980392157
8062950,3,B0009LDI22,"The Christmas Tree has recently become an infamous entry in the so bad its good genre. Thanks to personalities like the Nostalgia Critic , RedletterMedia, and Phelous, this unknown Christmas tale has started to gain a following in the fandom of good-bad movies. For you today I shall give a basic overview of this bizarre mishmash of insanity and yuletide offerings.

The Christmas Tree takes place somewhere not identified (for the purpose of this review lets say somewhere near..Pittsburgh), as a family is forced to live in an orphanage run by Ms Mavilda, the bizarre offspring of Cruella Da Vil and some degenerate gambler from Reno, NV. Mavilda is a terrible person who treats her orphans like garbage and only treats them well to get donations from the clueless mayor of the town of somewhere near Pittsburgh. The children decide to send two of their own to the North Pole to find Santa to make things right.

The animation of this film is a poor mesh of Disney-ish and cheap. The characters (especially the children) look creepy and soulless like dolls. The settings contradict themselves at points (for example in one scene theres snow on the ground, then theres none, then there snow again) and the editing is just ludicrous such as characters changing emotions and characteristics almost at will in the span of a single sentence.

The Voice Acting of this picture is catastrophic, and the biggest disaster of this train wreck.  Its clear whatever budget this had was spent on the animation as the voice acting is unspeakably bad. The adults sound either drugged or generic, except for Mavilda who sounds like an insane cat lady with helium force fed down her mouth cavity. The children are horrifyingly bad, they are below the level of Tommy Wiseau, the legendary director of The Room in terms of voice ability. However, Wiseau was at least understandable with his voice, these children are even worse. Half the time, you can barely understand what they are saying, and the voices of some of the children change in the span of seconds from kiddie to teenagers reading a script. The little blond girl is the worst, she sounds like a preschooler that was given Vicodin and Scotch by mistake. The poor dear (whose VA couldn't have been more than 6) slurs and sleepwalks through her lines and was probably one of the creators children brought in to save a dollar.

Finally, the film has little to do with Christmas. Theres a bit with Santa on his slay (shooting lightning bolts at a crazy person wielding a chainsaw) and the children are trying to save their giant Christmas Tree named Mrs. Hopewell(seriously). Other than that, there is little about Christmas, no yuletide, caroling, morality, etc. As a Christmas Movie, its so empty when it comes to discussing the meaning of Christmas except Santa will fix everything. I have seen more blatant Hollywood Christmas cash ins with more respect for the holiday. As a Christmas movie, it's  a complete failure.

The Christmas Tree is hilarious for all the wrong reasons. The voices will have you laughing in disgust and the animation is appallingly amusing. Is it worth watching if you love ""so bad its good"" movies? Absolutely, you will have a ball watching it with your friends. Is worth watching otherwise? No way, even if you need a cheap Christmas gift to put in your kids stocking, its not worth it. Instead just buy it for yourself and marvel at the complete lack of intelligence this film offers.

Pros: Its only 45 minutes long.
Its a very cheap DVD to find.
The film is perversely hilarious.

Cons: See above paragraphs.

Conclusion: Its terrible but a jolly good time if you are a purveyor of cinematic garbage. All others stay away, you have been warned. As a holiday film its a 1, as a bad film its a solid 10. Enjoy if you dare.",1490918400,,3796,4.75531914893617
8062951,1,B0009LDI22,"DO NOT BUY, I REPEAT SO NOT BUT, this was a horrible movie, just awful, the story was clearly written by a toddler, the Animation was just slapped on there with zero effort, the voice acting was boring and without any energy, the editing of it was probably the worst, 0 out of 10, you will be bored and want to refund it",1483315200,,320,4.095238095238095
