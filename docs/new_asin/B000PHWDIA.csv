Mustang Ironheart is a wonderful film that you can watch over and over and still laugh with and at.  If you ever watched an action movie from the 80's you'll instantly connect with the tongue in cheek refrences.  In the vein of 'Hot Fuzz' it not only parodies the genre but does so with a style that still allows the movie to have a plot of its own.  Much like those who were able to see 'Puddle Cruiser' before the boys from Broken Lizard got huge, you should grab this movie so that you can brag to your friends about seeing the boys from Shift's first film as well.",1187395200,,729,4.299270072992701
8191624,4,B000PHWDIA,"This is a low-budget comedy that will please if you have the patience to endure a slow opening. It grows on the audience as the movie goes on and parodies action movies, hollywood sterotypes, and even itself. The movie clocks in under an hour but has more than enough special features to make up for it. For $10 bucks this is work a look.",1180656000,,338,4.296875
