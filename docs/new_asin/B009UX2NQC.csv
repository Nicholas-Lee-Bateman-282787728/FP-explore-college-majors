8544445,1,B009UX2NQC,"Not what I expected from this comedian. While there were a few funny points, he went on a rant about Wal-Mart: its merchandise, its greeters, its customers. It was when he went off about how the customers are beer-bellied, redneck, trailer trash that I had enough. I got rid of the dvd the next day; don't even want it in my house. There was very little funny here and certainly nothing Christian about this comedy routine.",1483315200,,423,4.578947368421052
