5695738,5,B00C7E3E7S,"Me & my family loved watching Angry Beavers back in the 90s.  It was our favorite Nicktoon.  So naturally I collected all the DVDs released, at good prices.  I was looking for new of the 4th season when I noticed the announcement of the complete series.  I was upset at first, but I calmed down & just pre-ordered this.  It was at a good price, & when it comes in I know a place where I can get a good trade-in for seasons 1-3.  So overall, I'm a very happy Angry Beavers fan.  EDIT: I got the DVD & have been very happy watching the last season (while lesser shows might have jumped the shark, I think this season has some of the funniest ones & is definitely as good as the others), but the one flaw of this set is that there is no episode guide!

Would love to review the actual product after I rebuy it. Hope it arrives in one piece.

All the episodes are here (except for the original pilot and the unmade finale) and for the price it's way worth it. The only downsides are that 1) there's no pamphlet or episode numbering in the DVD case so you bascially have to guess what episodes are on what disc and which season. 2) There are no bonus features or language options and the menu screen can seem a little generic. But if you want to relive your childhood and have a few laughs then you should look into buying the complet series of Angry Beavers.",1510012800,,629,4.25

5695789,1,B00C7E3E7S,"I absolutely love this show. We originally bought it from our local walmart last year. After watching it with our niece, she decided that she'd like it for her upcoming 7th birthday and since our local walmart stopped carrying it, I took to Amazon for a copy. I have purchased MANY dvds, blue rays, etc from Amazon and I have never had an issue with damage to the cases until now. There is so much damage I cannot give this to my niece because of all the sharp pieces that she may cut herself on and because of the disc retention hub being broken to the point that the discs fall out of the case when you open it.

To say I am highly disappointed is an understatement...",1507075200,,670,4.234375

5695793,3,B00C7E3E7S,"The series itself is 5 stars, the quality of this set is not.  10 discs in a single double-stacked plastic case, low quality plastics, and some of the episodes look as if they were transferred over from a VHS.  It would seem Nickelodeon is just out to make a quick buck on all of us nostalgia goers without putting in any real effort.

While the DVD's are still safe, the plastic piece that connects the DVD holder to the case is very fragile and has already broken, However, the case still closes and the DVD's are still safe. So I can overlook this little annoyance.",1491782400,,503,4.185567010309279

The show's humor holds up pretty well. It's all whacky voices, slapstick shticks, and zany sound effects. Oh, the zany sound effects! I never realized how many this show uses.

Realistically, some episodes are kind of lackluster. The animation isn't the best, it does improve as the series goes on. However, that theme song is still is still as catchy as it ever was.

In the end, this is too cheap to pass up. Twenty bucks for the complete series (currently Jan, 2016) is well worth it. Though, I'd personally recommend Hey Arnold over Angry Beavers. Same price and it aged incredibly well.",1453334400,,778,4.791044776119403

Very much like the old Looney Tunes & Bugs Bunny cartoons of the 40's & 50's, Angry Beavers sometimes throws in a subliminal joke for adults like myself who ""get it."" Though this cartoon is marketed to a young audience, it is by no means dedicated to it and many times touches on subjects or makes jokes that appeal to adults. Very funny, clean, PG13-type of animated comedy. Highly recommended for cartoon loving adults.",1450224000,,596,4.632075471698113

We were talking about it one day and remembered how entertaining it was - so I decided to look it up on Amazon and there were Dag and Norb on the front of the dvd which are the the two beavers that are brothers in the cartoon. They are hilarious. I ordered one for my family and another for a good friend who wanted it for her 3 yr. old grandson after seeing a portion of an episode that I showed her on my phone.

5695899,5,B00C7E3E7S,"Daggett as The Silent Wind of Doom...what could be funnier? ""The Angry Beavers"" is finally available from Shout Factory on 10 DVDs, and the set includes all 62 episodes in order. Unusual in the cartoon universe, the adventures of Norb and Dag didn't decline in quality as the show went on, although I do admit to some of the earliest shows being among my favorites. This is a fabulous set!

The packaging quality is very high, and the shows are more or less evenly spaced on the DVDs. My only quibble would be the lack of a printed index or list of episodes in some form. There are no extras, which is too bad as I would have loved to have seen some storyboards or interviews with principals from the production; I would have especially have liked to have heard a discussion on the controversy surrounding the uncompleted and unaired episode ""Bye Bye Beavers"" which was allegedly involved in the cancellation of the series.

The set is beautiful to the eye and the show itself is as wonderful as ever. So control your poo spot, and order this, the most spoot-tastic show ever made about pointy weasels, without delay. It's a bargain that will repay the purchase price many times over in the laughs it gives from repeated viewing.",1423872000,5,1229,4.607305936073059

5695905,5,B00C7E3E7S,"All 62 episodes of The Angry Beavers on a 10-disc DVD set, what a wacky & spooty marvel from Mitch Schauer, and not Craig Bartlett, the creator of Hey Arnold! But it sadly doesn't contain the pilot episode from 1994, nor one featuring Dag and Norb's little sisters Stacy and Chelsea, named after AND played by Mitch Schauer's own daughters, nor the unfinished series finale! You never know what kind of wacky situations Daggett and Norbert Beaver will get into next with the whole series set! Daggett was played the actor behind Alpha 5 (and 6) of the Power Rangers shebang, and Billy the really stupid kid (and his dad Harold) in The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, as Norbert was played by the fella behind Salem Saberhagen from Sabrina's live-action AND animated series that started from the 1990's! What puzzles me about my set, even though it came from eBay, is that mine is even thicker than the ones in online-video reviews, and that every disc is single-layered and in LP mode, as they're normally at normal speed and dual-layered, but all 10 discs in my set play just fine! My cousin's copy of The Princess and the Frog is the same way from the same place. But I digress, ""aw, spoot"", whether the case is thick or fat, or the discs are single-layered or dual-layered, and if you remember this classic ""Spooty"" Nicktoon, you'll get a big bang out of this collection either way! From the 2nd season onward, every episode's end credits contain silly nicknames for the crew members who worked on the show. If you're looking to build a complete series collection of classic Nicktoons of sets from Shout Factory of this magnitude, this should be among them; alongside Rocko, Hey Arnold, AAAHH!!! Real Monsters, CatDog, and the Wild Thornberrys! Sadly, there's no bonus features of any kind on this set or each season set on their own, as with most of the other Nicktoons from Shout Factory I just mentioned. THIS IS NUTS!, as Daggett might say! Let's give a ""BIG HUG!"" to the folks at Shout Factory for giving us classic Nicktoons on DVDs, in stores everywhere, including The Angry Beavers!",1419897600,,2097,4.701086956521739

5695975,5,B00C7E3E7S,"Wow. I honestly CAN'T believe, that the Angry Beavers was released on DVD. After all the hell that Nickelodeon put the cast of the Angry Beavers through. I thought it would never happen, but I guess it's true, never say never. Shout Factory is amazing, and I am so grateful that they put the Beavers out on DVD :) So many memories of this show and it was a big part of my teen years. I can't thank the staff enough for making an amazing show! I like to think the Angry Beavers is a huge influence on my drawing and writing muse. I was 13 as a teen, ya know trying to figure out what you want to be as you grow up. Plus, I love how the episode has many funny moments-as I love comedy, especially of the knee slapping humor. The first episodes I saw was actually in August 1997, Salmon Sez and H2 Whoa, then one day I was watching the beavers a couple months later, and it was the episode ""Food of the Clods"" that got me into the show. It is a wacky funny episode, so got hooked :). I had the great opportunity to talk to some of the cast behind the beavers which are great funny people.

I love how all the episodes are on the DVDs, especially ""Kid Friendly"" and ""Silent but Deadly"", which was banned because, oh no, we're not allowed to have guns on TV shows, which obviously didn't stop people using guns for the wrong reasons but I digress. It is also great that the episodes that I didn't see in the US are on the DVDs-I had to go through a Canadian TAB fan to get to the episodes.

The Angry Beavers will always remain a classic to me, my influence into wanting to draw, write, and being creative,imaginative.

The animation is really nice too which I love, how they make the beavers real as possible to real beavers which is awesome :)

The ONLY thing I don't like how I have noticed with seasons/episodes, they are out of order, and some of the 4th season is actually the 5th season. Maybe I am being too much of a perfectionist or OCD if you will, it would just be nicer if it was made that way more organized, but a definite must buy if you love a good 90s show that is not only a classic but nostalgic! :)",1375660800,3,2114,4.12378640776699
5695976,4,B00C7E3E7S,"All 62 regular series episodes in one handy set for under $25, you can't ask for much more than that and this is a definite must buy for those who enjoyed the show during the original run. It holds up surprisingly well and still has that unique 90s charm. The set itself is rather basic though, containing what appears to be the same discs which shipped with the individual season 1-3 releases and presumably the same ones which will ship with the stand alone release of season 4. The clear plastic of the box I received was a little wonky and warped but it still serves the function of protecting the discs so no big deal.

There doesn't appear to have been any restoration work done on the episodes but they still look good in their presentation here considering when they were made. There are no audio or video set-up options but the episodes are closed captioned. While some audio commentaries would have been nice, I really have to take off a star from this set because it doesn't include subtitles or the pilot episodes. Though I assume there are good reasons the pilots were not included (Shout! Factory is a great company and they usually make the most they can out of a release.) it makes the ""complete series"" feel less complete. The audio from the never-animated series finale was also not included, but since that episode can be seen as kind of an F-U to the management at Nickelodeon for canceling the show that's not very surprising.

Those annoyances aside, fans can't go wrong with this set. I still remember watching the premiere so I'm obviously influenced by nostalgia, but this is genuinely a terrific, cleverly written and well executed series that should not be missed by any cartoon fan, young or old.",1375574400,4,1724,4.649180327868852

However, the current price for that is 19.93 and this set is currently 19.96, so you might as well just buy this. Now a review for people who have never seen this show. I haven't seen all the episodes, but I have seen a good chunk of them. Most of them being episodes from the Season 3 Part 1 dvd. To quote Dag,""That was nuts!"" This show is very creative, often uses weird plots, and is unpredictable. Even episodes that use more conventional plots may not play out the way you might expect. I think the fact that the end credits have jokes in them shows that the crew had fun working on this show. There are no subtitles or special features. So if you're a fan of shows like Ren and Stimpy, Adventure Time, and Regular Show, I think you'll enjoy this. I'd recommend seeing a few episodes before deciding whether or not to get this, but more than likely, I think you'll enjoy this show.",1375401600,3,1005,4.379679144385027

From,what I can see its uncut,there wasn't much in the show that nuts complained about besides the silly cartoon violence and the fact the beavers said damn. Which isn't a curse word when speaking of beavers,both are still there. Now you can enjoy the whole series in a well made case with 10 DISCS! Only thing missing is the pilot,which is on YouTube. Sadly no special features,but the fact its the whole series for so cheap gives it a 10. Maybe if nickelodeon didn't treat the creators badly they'd help with the DVD,but owe well. Its a must buy!",1375228800,,666,4.512396694214876
5695979,5,B00C7E3E7S,"The Angry Beavers The Complete Series
Shout Factory continues it's releases of classic Nickelodeon programming in  complete series sets with ""The Angry Beavers."" The show follows two ""pointy weasels"" living the bachelor life in their dam located in Wayouttatown, Oregon and their interactions with friendly forest critters, lumberjacks, hippies, and crazy government scientists.

Episodes:
All 62 episodes that have aired are presented in order and are evenly spread across 10 discs.

Packaging:
-Firm, solid and clear plastic packaging featuring unique artwork inside and out and on each disc, providing an added touch of flair.
-The only packaging flaw is no physical episode listing is included. (but the episodes are in order!)

Bonus Features:
There are no bonus features included on this set.  The only added bonus is a 12""x18"" lithograph/poster which is included only when purchased directly from the ""Shout Factory!"" website.  The lithograph is beautifully printed on thick, collector worthy paper.

Censorship:
There is one miniscule instance of censorship, so miniscule I questioned if it's worth mentioning, but here it is, in the episode ""Alley Oops"" (S2E13) the phrase ""Shut up"" was altered to ""Shush up.""  This was changed during the shows original run.

What's NOT included:
The following episodes would have made for some nice extras if they were included in some way, but it is completely understandable why they are not.  This list is merely to confirm that they are not present.

-The original unaired 1994 pilot ""Snowbound"" is NOT included.
(The episode can be found on youtube.)

-The un-aired ""Simply Sisters"" pilot is NOT included.  This was a failed pilot
for a spinoff show featuring Norb and Daggit's sisters.

-and finally ""A Tale of Two Rangers/Bye Bye Beavers"" is NOT included in any form.  This was the controversial episode that was never completed, consisting of Norb explaining to Dagg that they are only cartoons and are being cancelled.  Supposedly this was intended as an April fools joke, but ultimately became the reason for the shows early cancellation.
(The episodes voice cast recordings of the script for ""Bye Bye Beavers"" can be found on youtube as well.)

For the more than reasonable list price and the overall quality of the product this makes for a ""splendiferous"" set!",1374883200,22,2316,5.216216216216216
