8547880,5,B00A7IDDP4,Michel Duran serves up a beautiful movie for an evening's light entertainment that still gives the viewer pause for thought.  The dialog moves along without any need for vulgarity and the love scenes are tastefully staged.  It is easy to understand why the movie garnered the awards it did.  The non-French speaker can follow the English subtitles without losing the sense of the plot or missing any of the gorgeous Canadian scenery.  I recommend the movie for those with a well-developed sense of sophistication and an open mind.,1413417600,2,530,4.988636363636363
