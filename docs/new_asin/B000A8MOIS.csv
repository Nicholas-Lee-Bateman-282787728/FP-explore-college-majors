I'm not an expert!. I just wanted the movie for a gift. I won't ever purchase another dvd from this company. I thought all dvd players were the same, except for blue-ray. I don't blame Amazon,but I feel I threw away money",1253577600,,388,4.1866666666666665
8076662,2,B000A8MOIS,"woeful storyline, bad writing, character building and acting. Nothing against the seller but the movie below par.",1152748800,,113,5.705882352941177
8076663,4,B000A8MOIS,"Bruce Dern is downright creepy in this.  Maud Adams is sexy, beautiful and makes a great victim.  Tattoo artistry forms the backdrop for this otherwise garden-variety tale of obsession.  Something very Psycho about this film.  Will take you someplace you've probably never been.",1149033600,2,278,5.395348837209302
