2131933,2,B0002X7GSO,"The Tesseract (Oxide Pang, 2003)

I hereby forgive Danny Boyle for taking Alex Garland's amazing novel The Beach and turning it into the piece of celluloid excrement that it became. The problem seems to be that Alex Garland's novels have a pathological fear of being turned into movies, because unlike The Beach, The Tesseract comes with a director (The Eye's Oxide Pang) and male lead (b. Monkey's Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) who are absolutely above reproach and can simply do no wrong, and the movie's still... eh.

(I hereby thank all things holy that Garland's excellent screenplay for 28 Days Later... was not, in fact, based on one of his novels.)

The Tesseract is an interesting premise; the lives of four people (a drug runner, a psychologist, a bellboy, and an injured assassin) intersect in various ways in a disreputable Bangkok hotel. You know that Pang (who also directed the above-average action flick Bangkok Dangerous) is going to be able to do wonderful things with his home turf, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers could make reading Harlot's Ghost worth watching. Add in Saskia Reeves (Dune) and you've got a recipe for a blockbuster. Problem is, it never quite gels.

Pang, as expected, does in fact do wonderful things. (His use of repeated scenes from different angels to track the deeply confusing time element in the story is wonderful.) Rhys-Meyers, though he gets surprisingly little screen time for a male lead, acts as well as he always does. Saskia Reeves, who actually gets the most screen time (along with bellboy Wit, played by newcomer Alexander Rendell), also does a good job, although her part's not as well-written as is Rhys-Meyers' or Rendell's. The action is relatively fast, the camerawork is superb. So what's wrong with it?

I can't really tell you. It's the same indefinable thing (I refuse to blame Leo DiCaprio, who does have a good actor hiding in there somewhere, viz. The Basketball Diaries and What's Eating Gilbert Grape?) that made The Beach into such a crapfest. I cannot urge you strongly enough to read Alex Garland's novels; I urge you with equal fervor to avoid the movies based on them. **",1126137600,4,2132,4.927576601671309
2131934,5,B0002X7GSO,"The Tesseract From  the mind  of  Oxide Pang, co-director of the international horror sensation The Eye, comes this stylish and high-tension adaptation of the book by The Beach author Alex Garland. As drug dealer Sean (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and documentary filmmaker Rosa (Saskia Reeves) sit anxiously in a rundown Bangkok hotel,things get interesting,depression drug deal with lead to a kidnapping of a child ,and the devils other work blackmail car chases and mayham like a good 70,s flick run on a saturday night.",1117238400,6,516,5.2682926829268295
2131935,3,B0002X7GSO,"The Tesseract, the book, written by Alex Garland is the best fiction book that I have ever read. This film adapation, directed by Oxide Pang Chun, is LOOSELY based on the book. It has a similar setting, a run down hotel in Thailand. Similar characters, a drug-runner, psychologist, and street kids. But, not the same heart, not the same connections between the characters, and definitely not the same language. What makes Garland's books so wonderful is his masterful prose to describe a scene. Oxide Pang Chun's film does not do the same thing.

As far as those who have no knowledge of Garland's book, perhaps you might be intrigued by the non-sequential scene structure and the intermingling of the characters. For those of you were wowed by the book, do yourself a favor, and use the 96 minutes to read it again.",1101081600,3,816,4.746478873239437
2131936,2,B0002X7GSO,"The title of this film according to Websters, means; The four-dimensional equivalent of a cube and according to the press junket sent from the Sundance Channel to go along with the film; this movie is described as The Matrix meets Memento. I sat in front of my TV for about 90 minutes and at no point did I ever see a 4 dimensional cube, Neo or a guy with tattoos all over his body looking for a guy named Teddy, and believe me I was looking. I puzzled and puzzled til my puzzler was sore trying to understand what the director was shooting for with this ""creation"" and for the briefest of moments I thought the unthinkable had occurred. I thought this guy had actually outwitted me. Then I quickly came to my senses and realized that Oxide Pang Chun had not outwitted me, he just made a [...] movie that no one understands but him.

Based very LOOSLY on a novel by the same name from author Alex Garland, the film version is about a seedy hotel in Bangkok Thailand and 3 characters that are currently staying there and their bellboy, Wit. We have an English drug courier named Sean (John Rhys-Meyers), a documentarian, Rosa (Saskia Reeves) and an assassin with no name (Hot Asian Chick). The only link these 3 have is the sticky fingered bellboy and his thieving ways.

This movie jumped around more than Resident Evil Apocalypse so I got very little out of it but the abridged version goes a little like this. Sean is cooped up in his room almost the entire movie waiting to drop off a package to a local drug czar. Rosa is in Thailand to do a film on homeless children and their dreams. The assassin gets shot in a hit gone wrong and goes back to the hotel to wait for extraction. Wit interacts with each at different times and then steals the package Sean is holding. The little weasel tries to sell it on the street, word gets back to the drug czar and everyone ends up on the local drug dealers [...] list. You can figure the rest out for yourself or wait until October 26 and buy it because I doubt your local video rental establishment will have anything to do with this prune.

Guys like movies where stuff blows up, [...], the good guy kills the bad guy in some high-noonesque flashy never before seen method just before the credits roll and the crowd goes Whooo. In short, they like GOOD movies. Tesseract really doesn't meet any of that criteria, so it is far from a good movie, which means as far as I am concerned, it [was not good].",1095120000,7,2447,4.373626373626373
2131937,4,B0002X7GSO,"The Tesseract starts at first glance like a low budget, Hong Kong cinema, slick matrix-esque rip-off, but then a truly amazing thing happens. It evolves into an old-school, 70's type exploitation picture, where everyone is stressed out, every pore is sweat soaked, every shot revealing more in its graininess, and everyone is chasing the drugs. The Tesseract, based on a book by Alex Garland, revolves around strangers in a flea-bag hotel, whose lives slowly start to intertwine as fate and circumstance send them colliding into climaxing contact. Jonathan Rhys Meyers, from such films as Velvet Goldmine and Vanity Fair, is the closest thing to a lead this ensemble piece has, and he shines, delivering a performance full of stress induced angst and infused with subtle humor. The Tesseract was a success in the indie-movie house world and film festivals, and was picked up by Sundance in the U.S. for distribution. I highly recommend giving this movie a chance, it will surprise you. It would be a shame for a gem like this to slip through the cracks.",1093392000,26,1053,4.954802259887006

8034044,4,B0002X7GSO,"In an interview the Wachowski brothers gave, they mentioned how ""The Tesseract"" gave them much inspiration for the movie ""The Matrix"". I believe the interview was included on the Matrix DVD.
Since I really liked the special effects in the Matrix, I saw the movie solely  on this recommendation. I a budding movie maker and always interested in how special effects are created in the blockbuster movies.  I was blown away by the effects and the cinematography and greatly surprised by the storyline. I enjoyed immensely the movie. If you watch the movie based on its own merit, I'd say its excellent. Suspense filled, spooky and creepy at times. It was really well done. Great ending also.
  Its a shame that some earlier reviewers were tainted by reading the book. An author can whip up out of nothing a highly stylized construct or framework of a world where by the reader fills in all the nitty gritty details based on each person's experience. Making a movie is where the rubber hits the road. Limited by money, time, manpower, talent of set designers, etc.
  Jumping down from the soapbox now.",1328918400,3,1097,4.777777777777778
