The film begins at ""Scotland Yard"". The CID is on an important case. The Police Commissioner complains about a series of unsolved murders. No clues found! They call on Sherlock Holmes. Who cut off the right forefinger on those young women? What was the motive? Gregson and Holmes see somebody in the bar. Who is that lady? Holmes wonders what the four victims had in common? Gregson tells of another victim. Sir George Fenwick returns to Miss Morrow, he has forgotten things from last night! A man shows up, he claims to be a witness to Sir George's activities. Holmes observes a young woman arrive outside; she is the daughter of Sir George. She tells Holmes what she found in the garden. When they return Sir George will not answer any questions. He has a match book in his hand. Sir George withdrew 10,000 before he died. Holmes suspects a clever criminal is behind these deaths.

Dr. Watson gets a call for his services. Was this a trick? Holmes has figures out the scheme, he just needs evidence. Watson goes out to close the window on the house across the street. They catch a sniper! Holmes figures out what caused his: hypnotism. ""Anything is possible."" Holmes and Watson visit the Mesmer House. Hypnotism is used in place of a local or general anesthetic. Dr. Watson doesn't believe in hypnotism. [A comic interlude.] Holmes meets that young woman [as he planned]. Lydia offers him a sedative at her home, and tries to hypnotize him. Will Moriarity trick Holmes into a suicide? Will Watson and Gregson arrive in time? Will there be a sequel? Is Holmes a ""difficult subject""? Yes, of course.

Those who read the short stories about Sherlock Holmes will recognize parts of this story. What was the name of that sedative? This story is like a stage-play in its static locations. Yes, it had a low budget.",1453161600,,1841,4.675925925925926
