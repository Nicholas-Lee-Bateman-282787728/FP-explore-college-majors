7905624,3,B000009PR7,"THE SILENT SWORDSMAN (1967) is a Shaw Bros. swordplay film that predates the martial arts and kung fu films that the Hong Kong studio specialized in after the success of the Jimmy Wang Yu vehicle ONE-ARMED SWORDSMAN (1967). It's the kind of HK film that is less concerned with spectacular action than with the interplay of moral codes and obligations that governed the behavior of the knight-like warrior class of old China. It offers lavish sets, picturesque outdoor Taiwanese locations, and a lyrical Chinese music score, sprinkled with flavorful songs, often sung onscreen by the main characters. As such, the film represents something of a link between the Chinese Opera conventions of older HK films (e.g. THE GRAND SUBSTITUTION) and the newer, martial arts-oriented swordplay films of the later 1960s (which were eventually absorbed into the kung fu genre).
Chang Yi, who would later gain fame as a prominent kung fu villain in the 1970s (EAGLE'S CLAW, CHALLENGE OF DEATH), stars as the heroic young Shen, who is appointed head of the Sun Moon Sect, a fraternity of swordsmen (and women), after the chief is unceremoniously assassinated during an attempt to get the corrupt General Liu to send troops to the border to aid the besieged General Yuan. Shen's job is to get firm proof of Liu's treachery and force him to send the troops. He also has to avenge the death of his chief by bringing to justice the actual assassin, the Captain of Liu's guards. Shen is aided by other members of Sun Moon, including a mother-daughter team who are handy with daggers, as well as a pair of beautiful sisters from a northern tribe (never identified, but probably Mongol or Tartar), after he foils their abduction by Liu's lusty guardsmen. The incident-packed screenplay culminates in a massive swordfight between the Sun Moon faction and Liu's guards.
It's a fascinating movie which may not boast enough action to satisfy kung fu fans, but will reward the more curious HK aficionados with its wealth of cultural details and formal style from an earlier era of HK filmmaking. The film is in Mandarin with English subtitles, but is full-frame rather than letter-boxed, which means that the subtitles are sometimes cut off on the sides. This is less of a problem than it could have been because the dialogue is short and straightforward. Interested fans will also want to seek out such other Shaw Bros. swordplay films of the 1960s as TWIN SWORDS, THE MAGNIFICENT TRIO, THE THUNDERING SWORD and TRAIL OF THE BROKEN BLADE, all reviewed on this site.",1003017600,,2538,4.918414918414919
