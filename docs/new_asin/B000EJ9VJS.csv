8110592,4,B000EJ9VJS,"This film is fun. If you're a Mahjong fanatic like myself add one more star. Slapstick funny with great Mahjong scenes, silly villains and locker room humor combine for a 90 minute break from life. Cherrie Ying is great as Fanny, cute as well. Not to be taken seriously. Enjoy",1216771200,,276,4.54
8110593,3,B000EJ9VJS,"Somehow, they've taken all the idioms of the kung fu genre: the struggling students, the secret masters, the hidden rivalries, gang lords, and good triumphant in the end. Then, all that is grafted onto some kind of parlor game, as complex as bridge but played with elaborate dominoes.

The result is the perfect kung fu movie, minus the fights, choreography, scenery, sets, action, and plot, but with overacting to compensate.

But I mean that in a nice way - I think.

8110594,5,B000EJ9VJS,"I watched the first one and it was hilarious.  So of course I had to see the sequel.  I must say the second one is a bit more down to earth and believable. Unlike the first one which took more after Kung Fu Hustle.  If you play MJ or are related to someone who plays, you will love this movie.  If you don't play or ever plan on playing, you might not think much of this movie.  Most likely if you're reading this review, you are a fan.  So go see this movie.",1145923200,4,459,3.881720430107527
