1831684,5,B000089QAQ,"I am really happy with this workout.  As a beginner on the ball, I felt pretty challenged, but there were only a couple of moves I actually fell off the ball doing.  I like the well-rounded nature of the workouts, and I was pleased that my heart rate was up there a smidge much of the time.  I found the moves to be interesting to learn to do, so I didn't think the routine was boring at all.  I enjoyed the instructor more than I do most workout instructors.",1111536000,10,459,4.123595505617978
1831685,2,B000089QAQ,"This workout was very hard for me to get into; I became very bored by it.  The moves were challenging but the routine was blah.  If you are a beginner, this is not for you.  You are better off purchasing ""Quick Fix Stability Ball Workout"" no matter what your level of fitness.",1094515200,10,276,4.269230769230769
1831686,4,B000089QAQ,"I really enjoy this workout.  The instructor is pleasant, not at all fussy and pretty good with her instruction.  I agree that the 'frog' is tricky to master, however, I have found if I position myself higher on the ball it is easier to do.
The instructor also takes time for a few cat stretches and down dogs which are great, I have never had back pain after doing this routine.
I have to say, the results from this workout have been good, with all over toning achieved.",1088985600,9,471,4.340909090909091
1831687,2,B000089QAQ,"This is not a good routine. Boring and doesn't really flow. You would definetly do better with with Quick Fix Stability Ball Workout or Karen Voights Ball workout.
Check my other review on Amazon for the best choices in exercise and yoga DVDs. Thanks!",1074124800,25,251,4.7272727272727275
1831688,1,B000089QAQ,"the instructor in this video did not seem real confident in the moves, and was not very assertive. This ab routine is lacking inmany ways, and the ball routine was very plain. I'd recomment ON THE BALL ABS with LEISA HART, it is much better and more informative.",1069286400,8,262,4.479166666666667
1831689,4,B000089QAQ,"When I first started using this video, I could really feel it working.  Now that I've used it a few times, it doesn't seem to be targeting the same muscles.  So that means that those muscles have been tweeked!
It's a great workout.  The instructions are good (given right before actually doing it.)  If you are new to the ball, you might want to watch it a few times.  Or get some practice balancing on the ball before you begin this video.
I would've given it 5 stars, but for some reason the dvd doesn't always like to start up right away in my dvd player.  I have to stop it and then press play again to get it going.",1067385600,7,620,4.125
1831690,5,B000089QAQ,"There wasn't any aspect of this dvd I didn't enjoy. The instruction is well cued, easy to follow and the instructor is friendly and easy to listen to,great scenerey too!  I think the workout is challenging enough and very muscle specific if you concentrate on proper form. I enjoyed it so much that I bought it as a VHS b4 it came on amazon then when I saw it here I bought the DVD.",1050105600,36,382,4.162162162162162
7980710,1,B000089QAQ,"This might have been a good work out but I never knew. I did not try it right away and when I finally did the DVD was damaged. Brand new in the wrapper and the first time I put this on it did not work. I emailed to let the person I purchased it from know. I got no response. I think I would have like to buy another but because of the service, and the fact that the product was in bad condition, I decided not to do so.",1414540800,,419,3.6666666666666665
7980711,5,B000089QAQ,"THIS IS A GREAT DVD. U CAN REALLY FEEL IT WORKING YOUR WHOLE BODY!!

I SWEATED BUT NOT A GREAT DEAL, BUT I REALLY REALLY REALLY FELT IT IN THE MORNING!!!

IT SHOWS EASY TO DO EXERCISES AND HOW IF THEY GET  TO EASY HOW U CAN MODIFY TO ADVANCE EXERCISES. ALSO HAVE GOOD STRETCHES.

THEY EXPLAIN HOW TO DO THE EXERCISES AND DEMOSTRAIGHTED THEM WELL.",1268265600,2,346,4.196969696969697
7980712,3,B000089QAQ,"I did not like it, maybe the ball thing isn't for me. Too hard on my shoulders and elbow",1238889600,2,88,3.6842105263157894
7980713,2,B000089QAQ,"I've owned this dvd for about a year and use it periodically for a switch from the ones I really like.  The instructor is very wordy - there are big gaps so she can instruct before an exercise actually starts.  I find her voice and her repeated ""wunnerful"" annoying.  The exercises range from too easy to really hard. Music is fine, set is supposed to be a stage set of Great Salt Lake shore or something.  I'm giving this dvd away now, after having given it a fair shot.  Its boring and now, off even on my ""alternative dvds"" shelf.",1223769600,2,533,4.29
7980714,3,B000089QAQ,"Like other reviewers commented, this is intermediate in intensity and gets boring quickly, although far from the worst I've seen. I like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quick-Fix-Stability-Ball-Workout/dp/B000089QAP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quick Fix - Stability Ball Workout</a>&nbsp;much better, bought both at the same time and never use this one anymore.",1180915200,,407,8.272727272727273
7980715,4,B000089QAQ,"I have tried other stability ball workout videos/dvds and found this one pretty comprehensive for a beginner.  The instructor gives you the basics on how to use the stability ball including proper breathing techniques and posture (vital information for not hurting oneself). The instructor always gives you a preview of what the move is suppose to look like and how it is supposed to feel before you try out the move yourself. I have used the program on a regular, weekly basis and have always found it challenging so far.  This program does offer some alternate moves for a more challenging or easier workout. However,I feel that it does not offer enough of a challenge option when I progress further. The chapter selections are by target body regions and very easy to navigate. You may choose to skip the introduction and go straight to the workouts when you feel more confident about your skills.",1150070400,10,899,4.8311688311688314
7980716,3,B000089QAQ,"This is an OK workout.  I use parts of it as an add on to the workouts I really love. As a whole it's kind of slow, kind of boring, and the background is just weird. The moves do seem effective. The Quick Fix Stability Ball is a much, much better workout.",1140652800,6,255,3.9038461538461537
7980717,5,B000089QAQ,"This is a great work-out DVD, I absolutely love it.  I would not recommend this DVD for a beginner - but definitely make it your second purchase once you become comfortable using a stability ball!  This is a challenging workout with a lot of variety.  It is easy to navigate between the different segments (hips, abs, butt, etc.), allowing you to do the program in its entirety or pick-and-choose areas you wish to concentrate on.  This is definitely the best stability ball DVD I have purchased (and I have several.)",1125964800,21,517,4.711111111111111
7980718,2,B000089QAQ,"This stability ball workout is definitely a more advanced routine and is not for beginners.  This was the first stability ball DVD that I purchased and became quickly frustrated with the routine due to the level.  If you are a beginner, I would recommend Leslie Sansone's You can do Stability Ball training.  If you are a beginner or more advanced, I would recommend Denise Austin's Shrink the Female Fat Zone or the QuickFix Stability Ball training.  My all time favorite DVD for the stability ball is Denise Austin.  This is by far my least favorite.",1123545600,13,552,4.768421052631579
7980719,4,B000089QAQ,I borrowed this tape from my local gym just to see what it was all about.  After doing (most of) the workout I was sore in places I didn't know I had muscles.  It is a bit slow but I enjoy it and plan to buy a copy.  The ab exercises were different and I really felt them.  She also helps you along with proper breathing throughout the entire workout.  I would recommend this as a beginner with the ball.,1118102400,8,404,4.0
