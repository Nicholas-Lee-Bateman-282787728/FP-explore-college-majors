8562843,4,B0083CV8EE,"I had so much fun watching this movie  it's hard to find a B-movie that also has a complex storyline mixed in with the expected creepiness a movie like this promises. I feel like so many depend on gore or shock attempts without as much substance. Some of the plot lines were totally ridiculous but I think that's what I really enjoyed about it. I laughed when I probably wasn't supposed to... especially given that I could totally relate to the romantic relationships in the film (How do you answer ""I want want want WANT to get married""? Choices explored: ""Well I, um, well, uh, eeeeee, errrr okay?"" or ""You just want to get married and I happen to be the one standing here. I am NOT getting married to you."")
Yeah. Only one of the fun twists in this movie.

And the wigs. I just love wigs.",1439337600,,791,4.337837837837838
8562844,4,B0083CV8EE,"Extremely fun movie. I had no idea what I was in for before I got it, but I was pleasantly surprised. Surprises at every turn. I don't think I'd classify this with horror, unless we're talking about a sort of comedic homage to horror. The acting certainly wasn't bad, although I don't recognize any of these people. I think I came across a future cult classic, though. Totally great for the price.",1361836800,,397,4.527777777777778
