8194553,4,B000Q6GWYG,"This DVD is one of the best of kayaking DVDs. One star minus is because of the screen quality of the DVD. I imported this DVD to Germany (~30 + 5,50 toll payments). Maybe the Quality is a lower one because of the NTSC format? I never imported a DVD before.
The shipment arrived after 4 weeks and thats ok for overseas delivery.
However, i am really lucky about this purchase.
regards from Germany

The video is interesting and fun to watch and the sound track is the best I have ever heard in a kayaking video! Thanks Fisher for the great video!",1330560000,,278,4.072727272727272
8194556,5,B000Q6GWYG,The scenery is breathtaking and the skill of Steve Fisher and friends is amazing. You immediately find yourself drawn into the thrill of the run and find your heart racing as the kayakers approach every drop. The film is well organized and flows as well as the rivers they run. Also it gives a fascinating look into the life of an extreme kayaker. We enjoyed every minute of it.,1252886400,,378,4.492753623188406
