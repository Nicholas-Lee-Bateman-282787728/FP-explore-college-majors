 Presented in story continuity order

This 2016 Complete Series set has been released via Mill Creek Entertainment. The DVD box features the classic Sliders font, a series synopsis on the back, and main character Quinn Mallory on the cover, with a total of 15 DVD discs. The FOX Network ran the tagline A new dimension of adventure. Moments away worlds apart. in a print advertisement which is seen on the front cover.

In early 2016 we learned the budget home video company, Mill Creek Entertainment was releasing the Sliders the Complete Series set again and I implored them to place the episodes in continuity order. Thankfully they did. Theres no more need for a DVD guide for this particular release. Nevertheless theres still numerous flaws with this set.

On the bright side, this is a compact DVD only about an inch wide. It utilizes a slip cover with 8 cardboard sleeves. The DVDs are packaged in each sleeve with one disc on each side. Now to be honest, I think Id rather go back to the foam casing the 2004 Dual Dimension set sported, rather than placing them in these sleeves. They seem to be more prone in scratching the discs.

The video quality is clearly a downside on this Mill Creek Entertainment set. They compressed 87 episodes on 15 discs whereas the previous release in 2014 used 22 discs. Theres an obvious loss of detail and saturation. This set does has something going for it and thats the artwork, naming the title of each DVD disc, and the continuity order the episodes are placed in. What holds the set back, is the poor video compression, the cardboard sleeves, and the incessant advertising all over the discs and inside holder. Did I mention there are zero bonus features and no subtitles?

Overall if you're new to Sliders or a casual fan who doesnt have the Complete Series go ahead and pick it up. Simply for the incredible price and the episode continuity order. However if you're a diehard Sliders fan and videophile, stick to the previous releases. Youll have greater detail and a more vibrant color in the video. This Mill Creek Entertainment Sliders set offers a great opportunity to introduce this cult scifi series to family and friends at an affordable price.

2014 Release:

I own all the Sliders DVD sets and this one is packaged well in slim cases with single sided discs. However, episodes particularly in season one are again placed on the DVD by airdate not production order. Only wish there were extras and this was a Blu Ray. Here's the details and the intended episode production order:

6680100,3,B00NTWTWDW,"I remember really liking this series when it first aired on Fox because I've always liked parallel dimension stories.  I also liked the characters and the actors who portrayed them.  I do recall the series getting weaker in its third and final season on Fox, which was part of why John Rhys-Davies left.  I never followed the show to the then-called SciFi Network.  Just as well--the fourth season was terrible.

There are no extras with this set, not even subtitles.  I picked up a used earlier version of the first three seasons but kept this one because there were more episodes per disc and less space taken up; I recall Cleavant Derricks remarking the series was less fun to work on after Rhys-Davies left in the interviews from the other set.  Given how awful the fourth season was, I now wish I'd kept the earlier version.",1505692800,,829,4.636986301369863

6680105,4,B00NTWTWDW,"A fairly decent scifi series using relatively early CGI.  It's got a different angle and bent than other science fiction shows, and uses San Francisco as a backdrop.  Decent acting, a little frustrating in that the characters never really achieve their ultimate goal (no season finale, from what I recall), but a respectable watch.

6680111,4,B00NTWTWDW,I used Windows 7 to play the DVD's. Go to Start-->Windows Media Center for the best results. Due to using Windows 10 I most likely damaged one of the DVDs. This is not the first time that Window's 10 damaged one of my CDs or DVDs. I contacted the seller and the seller was very helpful. The sound is great. I did add on CyberLink PowerDVD16 to increase the chances of the DVD's playing normally-this program did not help anything on Windows 10. Honestly speaking I wouldn't even take a chance with the Windows Media Center on Windows 7 but from past experience it did work the best out of all of the free programs available.,1497830400,,624,4.387931034482759
6680112,5,B00NTWTWDW,"Have you ever tried to imagine what your life would be like if you had done something different?

This series does this on a societal scale. What would our country be like if we had lost WW2? Every episode gave us a chance to look at new examples of differences.

The idea is that every choice in life created a new set of universes, so there are universes where Hitler was never born and there are universes where he won that war. I leave it to your imagination what kinds of changes could be compared.

However, I will say that I didn't like the series near as much after they introduced a whole set of universes where the dinosaurs never died out, and were the dominant life form on their Earth, but other people loved that change.",1497484800,,734,4.343065693430657

6680131,3,B00NTWTWDW,"""Sliders"" was a very good series that Fox kept bumping around on their schedule until they cancelled it and the SyFy channel picked it up with a change in lead (because of budget cuts I.e., they couldn't afford star O'Connell and his gradual disinterest in the series as the cast kept shifting) and the loss of story editor from creator Tracey Torme.

I tonally the series started with

The less expensive set from Mill Creek has only one advantage--the series is presented in its intended airing order rather than the original broadcast order where the series would, at least during seasons one and two, occasionally be aired out of shooting order. The discs for the Mill Creek version, while inexpensive, don't look as good as the Universal set (that one has the entire series on 22 discs vs. 15). How does this translate to the picture? Sharpness, depth and the Mill a Creek uses the same transfers but with considerably more compression impacting how good the episodes look and without ANY special features. If you want and can spent the money in this set, it's worthwhile to go with the Universal DVDs for quality. If you are viewing on a smaller tv (under 40 inches), you're likely not to notice it as much as on a larger TV or a 4K (where it will look truly awful). Audio sounds fine for both.

The Universal set includes the special features from the individual releases-- a commentary on the pilot by writer-producer-creator Tracey Torme on season one,  a ""making"" of  featurette on season two and a gag reel for season three. It's unfortunate that Mill a Creek chose to eliminate these special features and eliminate subtitle. Both still existed so why not import them over? If it added $5.00 to the set, I think most fans would want to enjoy these special features. The bonus episodes from other shows that were on the original release aren't on the Mill Creek either.

As mentioned the Universal has actual holders vs. the Mill Creek where they are in cardboard and more likely to be scratched (Mill Creek often does a pretty bad job of packaging their product--the Quantum Leap Blu-rays for example are housed in a two disc holder  season-by-season with the various discs stacked on top of each other).

I'm all for saving money but not when it affects the quality of the product you end up buying particularly if it's a show you really enjoy.",1491264000,5,2356,4.687651331719128
6680132,4,B00NTWTWDW,"This is a comparison between the 2014 release by Universal, and the 2016 release by Mill Creek, both of which I own.

There is a very distinct reason why the Mill Creek release is only on 15 discs, while the Universal release is on 22 discs. Bitrate. Without getting into a video encoding lesson, generally speaking, the higher the bitrate of the encoding, the higher the quality of the video. The Mill Creek release averages between 2-4 Mbps while the Universal release averages between 4-8 Mbps. The difference in the video quality is astounding. The lower bitrate versions by Mill Creek have artifacts around all the text (credits, etc) and over-all is just plain poor. Add to that the fact that the packaging from Mill Creek consists of flimsy, cardboard inserts that have a tendency to scratch the discs when sliding them in and out, and the choice becomes clear.

The Universal release might also not be around all that much longer. I expect the Universal release is no longer being made since Mill Creek now owns the rights.

I hope this review helps some of you choose between which set to buy; if you care about the quality of the videos you purchase.",1490400000,90,1160,4.676470588235294

I read somewhere that the network made the decision not to do season six before season five was finished, so I really did expect that they would CONCLUDE the open plots. Didn't happen. Loved the series at first. Refreshing in the lack of nudity, curse words, and sex, but some of the shows seemed like they were just there to fill up an episode without the same quality of writing seen in the beginning.

Quality is a little lower than most dvd's I'd had, was hoping there would be more organization in both chapters (basically only 2 useful chapters per episode; very long time between them) as well as including the common foreign language Spanish and/or subtitles. Absolutely no subtitles are available even in the english language",1487808000,2,688,4.733333333333333

I particularly liked the double-sided cardboard sleeves for 2 discs storage (classier than Mill Creek Entertainment's paper sleeves for the 80's series Stingray) A welcome addition to my library! :-),1486598400,,484,4.6395348837209305

I have never had trouble with any other dvd's  ""lucky"" maybe.  But both the Sliders and Bewitched Mill Creek set had problems.  Several episodes froze up on Sliders and during one episode ( the one where Remi is with child) the picture froze,  and then the dvd was stuck.  Couldn't eject, or close, or even turn off the dvd player.  It took a half hour to get the disk out.  I've never had that happen with any other disk ever.  Not sure what caused that.  Disk would  not play in any other dvd player.  There were several other episodes that didn't play well,  but most did.  So I'm not going to lose sleep over it.  Just thought I would put in my 2 cents here,  since that's what ""here"" is for.  As for the show.  It was a good show and I enjoyed what I was able to see of it..........lol...  The last couple of seasons lacked something.  And I didn't like the way it ended.  It was a nice trip tho,  since I did not get to see this show when it was on tv......",1486166400,2,1085,4.125603864734299

 Here is what I did- - -when I saw the way the discs were stored I removed all the discs and put them in separate paper envelopes.  Then I took 2 of the cardboard holders, measured the difference between the two and cut off the top of the cardboard holder. I folded 2 pieces into an ""X"" and slid them into the bottom of the case. This acts like a spacer and holds all the discs at the top of the case. Now all the discs are separately sleeved and not likely to be damaged by the original package.",1486166400,5,619,4.057377049180328

6680167,1,B00NTWTWDW,"I sold my individual Sliders DVD sets in order to get this in one package. I wish I hadn't.

This set is awful. On the previous complete series set, there were 22 discs. On this set, Mill Creek has stripped the few special features the old set had, and compressed the video to fit them all on 15 discs. The result is the video is borderline unwatchable. I popped in several episodes from different discs and I had to turn them all off. I would pick up the other set quickly before it goes OOP, but it's over $100. This set I will be returning for sure.",1476662400,12,552,4.158878504672897
6680168,5,B00NTWTWDW,"You get what you pay for, no frills, just bare bones...

Once again, a good show like Sliders has been released in cheap packaging. All 15 discs are packaged in thin, double sided cardboard sleeves. Brand new out of the box, some of the discs have very light scratches and the last disc in my set had a finger print on the playing surface. There are zero special features, no informational inserts of any kind, and nothing written about the series except for the feeble description on the back of the case. Even though the Cro-Mags would have treated the release of this series with more respect, I'm giving this set 5 stars because you get ALL 5 seasons for under $25, ALL the discs are single sided, the transfer of picture and sound of EVERY episode is clean, the very slim case saves shelf space, and the episodes are ALL finally in the correct order.

As far as how I would rate the series itself, the first 2 seasons are the best and I'd give the entire series 3.5 stars because understandably, some of the CGI is not very good and some of the acting is bad. Overall: Buy this set because it's a good deal!",1476489600,28,1112,4.367149758454106
6680169,4,B00NTWTWDW,"Sliders! Grew up watching this series and bought the season's over the years but they fell apart, so I decided to just purchase the entire series.  It did arrive without damage. What's really nice is the season 3 discs are now one sided which helps avoid scratching and added ar on the back. The price changes on here, and is a little high. Unless your a collector or a huge fan and want the box art. ( love Quinn on the cover ).  This show has its flaws,but what show doesnt? This show is  a classic sci-fi adventure series, and that's what I love about it. It's a dramatic adventure for four people barely surviving/ Sliding for their lives until they one day can get home. Despite others I rather loved season 4, I enjoy Colin and Maggie and the kromaggs story up until season 5.

The story lines are interesting, and can change drastically from episode to episode.  If you're a science fiction fan, I recommend giving this show a try, though you can skip season four and five, they're pretty bad compared to the first three.",1461974400,3,577,4.673267326732673

However, for me the show took a huge nosedive when they killed off the professor in order to bring in a female character to appeal to a younger demographic. Based on the results, it was quite a dubious choice. Some of the episodes of the show were very good, but others had a ""it's so bad that it's good"" quality. I liked it best early on when it was a ""universe of the week"" type show. It became more of a serial show when they introduced the alien plot line, and the quality declined.
