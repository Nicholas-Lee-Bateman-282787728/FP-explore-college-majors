8317971,5,B001LF363G,"Ten Commandments of the Mafia (2008) is a must-see, 4 hour long DISCOVERY
CHANNEL production, divided into 3 documentaries with crisp, clear
and impeccable editing of actual surveillance footage of legendary
individuals in the scene, coupled with an intelligent narrative,
and assisted by a number of veterans of the scene of the 1960's,
70's and 1980's now part of the witness protection program, who are
interviewed, and offer their recollections. The amount of realism
in this series is almost unmatched anywhere else.

The individuals participating in this release, are F. Aldrich, R.
Previte, E. Milano, G. Anastasia, F Martens, F Panessa, P. Colgan,
M. Franzese and H. Hill.

In the first episode, Sopranos actor S. Schirripa introduces
Brooklyn, Manhattan, Staten Island, explaining generally the
incidence of rubouts, the disposal of the victims as well as the
stigma of rolling over to the FBI, breaching omerta. The entire Joe
Pistone / Donne Brasco story is told.

Secondly, the story of Sammy the Bull Gravano and John Gotti is
told, lasting over 90 mins. The researcher Jerry Capeci joins in.

Some time is spent going over how Gotti jeopardized the rules, by
taking out Castellano, the motives, the arguments of why it
happened, and how it turned out for the best.

Reminiscent of Boss of Bosses, with Chaz Palmintieri, it tells of
Castellano's affair with his maid.

Despite owning up to over 30 rubouts, Gravano rolls to the FBI,
based mainly on audio recordings of gripes from Gotti about his
""green eyes"" (greediness), made secretly as seen elsewhere in the
movie ""Gotti"" with Armand Assante.

Next, as covered already in Joe Valachi's papers, the secret
induction ceremony is described in being a made man.

Tradition requires that the 1 or 2 people responsible for vouching
a new individual into the gang as worthy, being rubbed out, if it
turns out that the member is a snitch, or proves unworthy of joining.",1268006400,6,1929,5.025078369905956
