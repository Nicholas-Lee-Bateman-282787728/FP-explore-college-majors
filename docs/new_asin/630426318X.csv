From it's lively Afro-Caribbean flavor to the darkest caverns of France, and the music is exquisite, and stirs the soul. This movie is not for everyone, many will not get it...but it is one of the finest movies I've seen in many years, with excellent acting and directing by Clair Denis.",1513123200,,397,5.03030303030303

7866300,1,630426318X,"Yawn!!!!  This moved incredibly slowly.  It had little music to add some zing to it.  Blink and you'll miss the murders and the solving of the crimes.  On the 1 hand, it's nice that marginalized ppl in French society (Blacks, gays, Eastern European immigrants) get primary roles here.  Still, this dull slop was not compelling in the slightest.  I'll have to donate my copy to an LGBT library or something, 'cuz there's no way this stinker is staying chez moi!",1468195200,,460,4.6875
7866301,4,630426318X,"""I Can't Sleep""(1994) is directed by Claire Denis (Beau Travail, White Material). The movie is about the true life murders in Paris of over 20 elderly woman. The film slowly develops giving us some insight into the world of Paris as seen initially through the eyes of a young Lithuanian woman (Golubeva) who comes to visit her elderly relative. Moving through a series unconnected people in Paris we get a portrait of the dislocation and arbitrariness of the murders.

The dvd is fine, though there are no special features except a list of some of the cast and their movies up to 2006. The cast includes Beatrice Dalle (Betty Blue), Yekaterina Golubeva and Richard Courcet.",1399507200,,673,4.852173913043479

After I saw it I always told people about it and cant get it out of my mind. Everyone had the same reaction I did when I said the title. I CANT SLEEP  wow!",1049155200,4,285,3.982456140350877
7866303,5,630426318X,"I believe that people who search for the director's point or meaning to the overlapping stories in ""I Can't Sleep"" only do themselves a disfavor.  This film, with its dreamy music, pensive acting and odd flavor seems more about the lack of a point.  All the plots in this film have connection, yet nobody in it really connects, and there seems to be very little meaning for any.  This can be a frustrating film experience; but overall, leaving it so empty, the beauty is that the viewer is forced to fill in his or her own details and use his or her own brain.  Definitely not a film for all, but those who like challenging, slow-moving and very pensive material... you can fo much worse.  Also check out Nenette et Boni, an even better film by the same director, and Beau Travail, a beautiful tone poem of an adaption of Billy Budd, still by Claire Denis.",985564800,7,856,4.461538461538462
