8754588,4,B01D0ORXKW,"This was available for a time here at Amazon, but then it seemed to disappear from this site when I was looking for it. I bought the DVD somewhere else, but now it's available again. According to Severin on their site, it's now OOP. If you've watched many of Fulci's films, you may not be aware of what you're getting when you watch this. There's no gore or graphic violence in this at all. In fact, there's only a brief bit of cursing and a scene of sexual content without nudity that's in a car; certainly, many would expect a much more explicit film from Fulci. That being said, I really enjoyed it. The story on this is simple. It begins with a man in a cemetery as a funeral is taking place. He then gets in his car and leaves. He's trying to reach a certain place, but assorted detours prohibit this. Along with the detours, there's also a hearse that's following him on his journey. He keeps driving and you see the nice locations with the hearse and detours popping up. He'll stop in some parts, but then he'll go back to the road again.  Well scored and directed, it's a film that manages to be an excellent midnight movie; it's those desolate locations that make this a good watch for a rainy day or late at night. As of this time, it's on YOUTUBE. It might be one of those films that you might want to check out for free first before you buy because the overall subdued nature of the film might be a problem with some, but I think it plays a lot better in the best quality possible on a big screen. Fulci just got this easy to follow story and picked these effective locations. He directs it really well, picks competent actors, throws in some good soundtracks to go along with those nice locations and you've got a good one.

The full screen transfer is very nice. The main menu screen has a good soundtrack that plays that I like.",1465862400,,1843,4.30835734870317
8754589,4,B01D0ORXKW,"I finally got around to seeing this excellently grim take on death by maestro Lucio Fulci 'DOOR INTO SILENCE' aka 'LA PORTA DEL SILENZIO'-1991 which resembles many an episode of past Television and Horror film forays by utilizing actor John Savage as an accident victim caught between the world of reality and afterlife.  Almost a partial remake of Director Herk Harvey's classic 'CARNIVAL OF SOULS'-1962 which uses the Salt Lake City terrain for its canvas, here Fulci places Savage into pre-Katrina New Orleans as the cinematography by Giancarlo Ferrando weaves an unsettlingly eerie feel in each frame of the films 88 minute running time.  It is the length which is its only flaw and yet Fulci never lets you take your eyes off the screen where the increasing nightmare of Savage's dilemma unfolds in a painfully poignant ballet of terror.  Fulci turns off the gore and goes for good old fashioned atmospherics for his prophetic message on death 5 years before the grim reaper would take him after complications from diabetes.  Almost collaborating with Director Dario Argento on 'WAX MASK' aka 'MASCHERA DI WAX' which would be completed by Makeup effects master Sergio Stivaletti in 1997, this film remains a beautiful swan song to an incredible career of haunting photoplays which incompassed every facet of Horror.  Kudos to Severin films for releasing it in a beautiful full screen transfer in English , alas, there are no extras but its worth it for all Fulci completists and fans of subtle terror.",1312502400,2,1506,5.008
8754590,5,B01D0ORXKW,first off door into silence is not a gore film. if you are hoping for another bloody/gore film by the great lucio fulci then don't get this movie. instead door into silence is like a long twilight zone episode. it has mystery to it and at times is suspenseful. it doesnt drag too much and if you appreciate good horror and thrillers you'll be left feeling satisfied. underrated,1255824000,4,377,4.5588235294117645
8754591,2,B01D0ORXKW,"Door into Silence has the notoriety of being cult Italian director Lucio Fulci's final film. Like many other directors their final films very rarely have notoriety for being their best. This is no different

Being an avid Fulci fan I got excited to hear that cult DVD company Severin Entertainment was going to put out Fulci's final effort onto DVD.  When starting the film I knew I was in trouble when I saw it was produced by Filmirage, director Joe D'Amato's production company. This is the same production company that brought us such ""classics"" as Witchery, Anthropophagus, Killing Birds and the notorious Troll 2. Right away I knew I was in for a bad film. Don't get me wrong as I wasn't expecting much to begin with. Most of Fulci's later films are rather weak and are mostly trashy entertainment. That ""filmirage"" logo at the beginning however made me cringe. Sadly the film isn't even trashy entertainment but also fails on almost all accounts of what we expect from Fulci

The story is a twilight zone type tale very reminiscent of Jacob's Ladder. Fulci would get into these ""twilight zone"" tales a few times in his career with the likes of House of Clocks, Sweet House of Horrors, and Voices from Beyond. However the ultra low production values and bad acting keep this from getting engrossing. Speaking of ""gross"" this film contains absolutely NO gore so gore hounds are going to be sorely disappointed.

Overall I found the film dull, full of bad acting, bad music (some music is even recycled from Troll 2!) and lacking Fulci style  (no doubt due  to no budget). I only recommend this film to the most hardcore Fulci fanatics. Casual fans may pass. Even though I didn't like the film I thank Severin for releasing it on DVD for allowing us Fulci fans to finally see the maestro's final film without resorting to bootlegs.",1250553600,3,1835,4.71875
8754592,3,B01D0ORXKW,"There is no blood and gore in it, so it is not for zombie-fans at all. But for me there is a true feeling of identification with the main character.

Savage plays his role brilliantly. He is pitiful and sometimes I feel like I was trapped in this horrible situation instead of him. The masterfully shot sinister landscapes also made me real nervous. Maybe it seems strange, but in my opinion the atmosphere in the movie is the same as in Weir's ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"".

Sadly it is the last movie made by Fulci. Maybe he had a presentiment about his death and he somehow put it into his last work. Anyway ""Door to silence"" is another example of his versatile talent. Must see (not only for Fulci's fans)",1244851200,6,705,4.415384615384616
