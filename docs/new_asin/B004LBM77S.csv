8434218,5,B004LBM77S,"This an excellent documentary series. One of the best, I've seen. (And I've seen many.)
As an American Civil War buff, as well as a Living Historian (Reenactor) I find this series to show more accurately the trials of the CW Soldier, on the battlefield. My only disappointment is the fact that there are more episodes to this series than what has been released, here. This DVD is only Season 1. There were a total of three seasons. Why Seasons 2 & 3 were never transfered to DVD, is a tradgedy.",1483142400,,494,4.43956043956044
