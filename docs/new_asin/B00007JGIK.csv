7976791,5,B00007JGIK,"I could go on-and-on about how incredible & indispensable this DVD is for fans of TRUE old-time music, but I'll be brief and mention only the DEFINITE highlight to be found here: Tommy Jarrell's near-7-minute solo fiddle performance of ""Drunken Hiccups"" (also known as ""Jack O' Diamonds"").....it is one of the most mesmerizing & haunting performances I've ever seen in ANY musical genre and it's well worth the price of admission just for this devastating footage.  Devotees of Tommy Jarrell CANNOT be without this film!!",1224979200,10,521,5.129411764705883
