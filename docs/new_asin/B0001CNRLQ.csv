1988871,5,B0001CNRLQ,"I am very glad Universal has decided to re-release its classic horror films of the 30s and 40s. I am also glad that they are making them so much more affordable. Their previous releases, including the double-features, were very pricey and they are even pricier in the secondary market on eBay. Those DVDs will probably get cheaper with the release of these legacy collections. Have to admit though that I do like the packaging of the original DVDs over these new ones (I like the fact that they used the original poster artwork) but since I am buying these DVDs for the movies and not the boxes I will survive. And to think that I paid the same for two of the older DVDs on eBay that I will pay for the entire Legacy Collection of 13 films. 13 what a perfect number for this set!
Note to Universal: How about a Legacy Collection featuring the Universal team-ups of Karloff and Lugosi (""The Black Cat,"" ""The Raven,"" ""The Invisible Ray,"" ""Black Friday,"" etc.) and some of the other Universal horror films that never make it into collections such as ""Man Made Monster""?",1082592000,5,1066,4.557291666666667
1988872,5,B0001CNRLQ,"Some may look at this 5 movie collection for such a cheap price and assume it must be crap quality, but you'd be badly mistaken.  Universal is developing a great reputation for making tremendous amounts of material into a very low costing fantastic quality product.  If you've seen their 8 movie Abbott & Costello collection, you know what I'm talking about, if not I recommend that too.  These will truly be the best versions of any of the five films you could ever get, and for only $4.50 per film!  Also check out the Dracula and Wolf Man collections as well.",1082246400,6,562,4.534653465346534

1988936,1,B0001CNRLQ,"This Legacy collection deserves to be scrapped now, they're old Digital remaster transfers
FRANKENSTIEN & BRIDE OF FRANKENSTIEN have now reissued on Blu-ray in new HD transfers, the same 1:33:1 fullscreen ratio
and the sound quality has been boosted up to new master stereo mixes
incredible picture quality on these new HD transfers, 100 times more sharper & clearer than the old Digital remaster dvd transfers
plus the sound quality sounds even better in new Stereo mixes, the old dvd versions only had Mono sound
plus all the special features, i mean all the extras from the old dvd versions
this includes the Audio commentaries & the making of retrospect featurettes
plus a Documentary on Boris Karloff's life, plus a Doco on make up artist Jack pierce
all this on 1 Blu-ray Disc, incredible!
tragically thou the sequels, Son, Ghost & House of Frankenstien are still waiting new blu-ray releases
if universal ever make a effort to release the sequels on blu-ray, the picture quality would be incredible in new HD transfers
i already own both Frankenstien blu-ray's & i have no regrets believe me
the picture quality is that much clearer & sharper it makes me more interested to keep watching them
5 stars for both blu-ray versions
1 star for this very old dvd set, over 10 years old now time to upgrade to blu-ray",1455580800,,1316,4.8017621145374445

Five of the greatest horror films and all classics, if I might add. Frankenstein, The Bride of Frankenstein, The Son of Frankenstein, The Ghost of Frankenstein all topped off with The House of Frankenstein. Unlike the other monster sets where the main star is only in one or two films, Boris Karloff stars in 4 of the 5. The only film he is not a part of is The Ghost of Frankenstein which is another great Universal flick. The only two he does not play the monster is House of Frankenstein where he plays Dr. Neimann and the other film the monster is played by none other than Lon Chaney,Jr. These films are the BOMB!

All of the movies but one will play - the ""Son of Frankenstein"" movie, on Disc 2, side one, will not play.  It starts with the opening credits, then starting at the first scene, it skips, then stops.  This happened the first time I played the disc, and at first I thought it was the DVD player, so I took it out and tried again with the same results.  I then tried to play the disc in a different player with the same results.  When I went to the scene select screen to skip over the beginning, it will not play at all.

1989139,1,B0001CNRLQ,"Frankenstein is a lackluster, tedious and infantile film filled with ham actors who smoke, curse and fight each other in each scene, attempting to portray some sort of sophisticated 'drama'. Most of the characters are so inept they can't even shoot straight. The 'scenes' of the countryside were repeated over and over on some man made studio back lot. I was rooting for the monster all the way.

I could go on, but basically, these films are an insult to intelligence and have been hyped up by teen pranksters who saw them at the theater in the 50's/60's and have been following every Frankenstein feature convention for the last 45 years.

They try to drown out any sort of criticism. Avoid the Frankenstein - (The Legacy Collection (Frankenstein / Bride of / Son of / Ghost of / House of) (1931)).",1387756800,,800,4.666666666666667

1989178,5,B0001CNRLQ,"Frankenstein's Monster--made famous by the legendary Boris Karloff--stalks through the Universal landscape in 5 excellent films from the studio's classic horror library.

""Frankenstein,"" the first film in the series is an excellent way to kick off things as Colin Clive & Boris Karloff bring the legend of the ""mad"" doctor and his fiendish creation to life & Edward Van Sloan brings great supporting acting chops to the proceedings.

But--as good as Frankenstein is--the sequel ""Bride of Frankenstein"" is even better. The third film in the series, ""Son of Frankenstein"" is very good too--although the monster seems to lose some of his empathy in this one, being mostly a pawn of the malevolent Ygor, played by horror legend Bela Lugosi--who does a great job of stealing the film from Karloff & Basil Rathbone.

The fourth film, ""Ghost of Frankenstein"" may be one of the more underrated films of the entire Universal monster series. I really liked Lon Chaney's portrayal of the monster & Bela is back as Ygor & is just as great as he was in ""SON"".

""House of Frankenstein"" ends the collection on another high note as Universal gives us another ""Monster Mash"" movie--featuring not only the Monster, but the Wolf Man, Dracula, a mad doctor (played by Karloff) and a murderous hunchback. I really enjoyed this movie.

The 75th is far superior, having commentary with historian Sir Christopher Frayling, who is leagues above Rudy Behlmer, who appears to have been commenting for some sixth grade class. What many who watch these films today do not understand it that they represent the foundations of the horror genre. When Frankenstein was first released, it was the most horrific movie most moviegoers had ever seen. Alien would not be released for another four decades. One can only wonder why a scientist would want to sew a bunch of bodies together to reanimate, rather than finding one in somewhat good condition. Or why he would have a total moron for an assistant. Or why he would use metal bolts in the neck, when clearly, they weren't there for electrical purposes. But then I recently went to see Prometheus and was horrified out of my skin when I witnessed one of the stupidest ""horror"" films that had virtually reached into my wallet and stolen my money (thanks a lot, Ridley Scott). Beyond Elsa Lanchester's wonderful hissy fit in the Bride of Frankenstein, in my opinion, the Bride, with Jennifer Beals, is the best of the Frankenstein films. Personally, though, I would love to see them use a modern, hardcore script with Boris Karloff once again as the monster, recreated with CGI the way Ahnold was in Terminator Salvation.",1353542400,,1388,4.860759493670886

1989260,5,B0001CNRLQ,"This was the first of the Legacy Collections I purchased (when they first came out they were about $18 bucks, now they're highway robbery).

All of these played on Thriller Theater the year I graduated high school and the likes of Boris Karloff, Colin Clive, Lionel Atwill, Bela Lugosi, Lon Chaney Jr and Basil Rathbone haunted this run. As the 40's arrived Franky, Drac and the Wolf Man appeared in various team-ups between the three franchises and it gets a bit confusing; in fact, to really see them as they first appeared you have to keep bouncing back and forth from all three collections.

Frankenstein is the creepiest, most gothic of this run; Karloff should have received an Oscar but horror has never been appreciated by the uptights that hand the stupid statues out. ""It's alive!"" is one of the most famous and over-used quotes in movie history and Colin Clive, Doc Frankenstein, utters it.

Bride of Frankenstein is one of the best sequels of all time, and some say it is better than the original; I consider it to be a continuation of the original much like Halloween 1 and 2 (Carpenter's classics, natch), and shades of it are reflected in Halloween 5.

Son of Frankenstein is the longest of the franchise and has the most sympathetic Doc Frankenstein, and it is Karloff's swan song as the Monster.

Ghost of Frankenstein has an ashy-white Monster back from the dead, becoming a regular occurance with monsters in general, you know.

House of Frankenstein is part of that crossover bananza with Drac and Wolf Man.

Some sound issues are present, but as a Gen Xer I sort of expect that from creepy old movies from the first thirty years of the 20th Century.

It's all good.",1351987200,,1686,4.691525423728813
1989261,5,B0001CNRLQ,"Frankenstein - Legacy Collection DVD

This product has two DVDs with five Frankenstein movies from the 1930s and early 1940s. The first DVD has ""Frankenstein"" and the ""Bride of Frankenstein"". The second double-sided DVD has ""Son of Frankenstein"" and ""Ghost of Frankenstein"" on side one and the ""House of Frankenstein"" on side two. The story for Frankenstein's Monster came from a novel by Mary Shelley in the early 19th century. Stories about vampires and werewolves goes back centuries in folk legends that have no authors. These movies are digitally enhanced for clarity and contrast, they are much better than anything you saw on videotapes. One book said Frankenstein symbolized the Great Depression that plagues the nation and the world. Only by uniting could the people destroy the monster and the castle that produced it. The Ford Recession of 1974-75 was followed by ""Jaws"", the best-selling horror movie of all time. It was disguised as a pseudo-documentary. It too had its sequels until its audience dwindled. The horror movies of the 1930s to 1940s ended by 1945 when victory in war led to new interests.

""Frankenstein"" (1931) was the first adaption of the novel. The Monster is eliminated after the people attack the baron's castle. Baron Frankenstein's marriage promises happiness for the village (and another sequel).

""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935) tells how the Monster survived and how the village people tried to capture him. The body of a young woman is reanimated to provide a mate to the Monster. Can they propagate a new race of manufactured beings? Things don't go as planned. Will they survive the destruction of the tower?

""Son of Frankenstein"" (1939) tells about the new history of the Frankenstein family. The Monster is dormant and hidden away. Can he be revived? Ygor commands the Monster to kill his enemies. Where is the Monster now? Baron Frankenstein seemingly eliminates the Monster.

""Ghost of Frankenstein"" (1942) continues with Ygor and the monster fleeing the destroyed castle to travel to another village. The other son decides to transplant another brain into the creature. The people attack the mansion and set it afire. Will this be the end? [No.]

`House of Frankenstein' (1944) tells what happened to Dracula's skeleton. When freed, Dracula goes on to attack people until he suffers from a fatal case of sunburn. Later they find the Wolfman and the Monster in an ice cavern. Warmth frees them. They travel to Visaria, Ilonka knows how to shoot a pistol with a silver bullet. Can the people put an end to the Monster?",1350604800,,2562,5.03066037735849

All are very good, however my favorite is and always will be ""The Bride Of Frankenstein"" This film had it all, humor, pathos and a great musical score. Usually a sequal isn't as good as the original, however, this film is the exception. Frankenstei was enjoyable and for it's time Boris Karloff was quite scary as Frankenstein's creation. I really liked Jack Pierce's makeup on Boris Karloff. ""Son Of Frankenstein"" was a bit ofa a let down, only because Boris Karloff seemed to have phoned in his performance, however, Bella Lugosi's portryal of Ygor made up for it. ""Ghost Of Frankenstein"" was also enjoyable. House Of FRankenstein was and still is a great movie. John Carradine as Count Dracula was excellent. Of all the actors who have played Count Dracula, over the years, John Carradine best fit the author Bram Stoker's description of Count Dracula. This is a must have DVD for all horror film fans.

1989266,4,B0001CNRLQ,"I got this collection a while back and finally watched all five films.  They are great and they provide both the summit of Universal horror films and what happened to the brand as the years went on.

The first three films all feature Boris Karloff in his iconic role of the monster.  Karloff truly made this character his own - as much an awkward new born child as he is a murderous monster after meeting nothing but rejection in society.  Karloff does most of this with gestures and facial expressions under a ton of makeup, and no dialog except for a few grunts (his monster does get to speak some memorable lines in ""Bride"").  It is truly a bravura performance and no actor since has captured both the rampaging anger and fragile innocence of this creature.

James Whale directed the first two films.  The first is a fairly grim classic, but Whale's offbeat humor really shines in ""Bride.""  ""Bride"" is one of my favorite films, featuring Ernest Thesinger as a loony Dr Praetorious with his miniature people and Elsa Lancaster only in the film for about five minutes but making the titular Bride another iconic role.

While Whale did not direct the third film - Son of Frankenstein - it is high Gothic mode with huge castle rooms, Bela Lugosi as a leering Igor and Basil Rathbone slowly going bonkers as the young Dr Frankenstein.  I must admit it is hard to watch these three films without recalling Mel Brooks' expert satire in Young Frankenstein - the scene with the hermit in the woods remains a spot on parody.

By the time we get to Ghost of Frankenstein, Karloff had left and the series was starting to run out of ideas.  Not as bad a film as I thought, and it does wrap up the Igor plotline, but Lon Chaney Jr is no Karloff and the shift to creature as pure murder machine is well under way.  By House of Frankenstein, the series was just ""throw as many monsters together as we can and figure out a plot later.""  The next step was for Abbott and Costello to do a hilarious send up of the whole Universal horror craze.

The Legacy collection has some great bonus features and commentary.  However, the second disk has movies on both sides, making it difficult to keep fingerprints off the disk.  No doubt a cost saving device but three separate disks would have been much better.  Hence the four stars instead of five.  These early Universal films started the horror craze that continues in Hollywood to this day.  The better movies remain some of the best loved and best remembered films of the whole genre.  While not overly faithful to Mary Shelley's novel, you hear someone say ""Frankenstein,"" and you think Karloff and these films.",1334448000,2,2645,4.573248407643312
1989267,5,B0001CNRLQ,"i hesitated to purchase this dvd collection because of a few of the reviews here that said that dvd's were received loose and damaged. i just want to give my two cents here, because my experience was different. maybe the company who produces the dvd's were made aware of the negative feedback and changed the packaging... i'm not sure? but i received my cd's in excellent condition... the packaging was tight and secure... the two halves of the sleeve interlocked and there was even a layer of foam between the discs... i like to think that maybe this means that these reviews actually affect how the retailers make their product, because there is no way the dvd's could have become loose in the packaging i received. again i'm just going by my own experience.

of course the movies themselves are classics... i think anybody who is ordering these movies knows what to expect as far as content. i will say that i watched the original movie many years ago when i was younger, and this is my first time watching the other movies. i re-watched the first movie and loved it, and then i have to say, 'bride of frankenstein' was almost better than the first movie! there was a lot of screen-time for the monster... and the scene with the blind guy is really touching. again, to be honest, the third and fourth movies left a little to be desired for me... they seemed to be just trying to cash in on the theme, and didn't have much of the 'horror' (the monster in action), and by the fourth movie i was used to seeing boris karloff and having lon chaney play the monster didn't do it for me. it just kind of took me out of the fantasy. i have't watched the last movie yet... i just wanted to give some of the impressions that i had this weekend while enjoying the collection! even though i preferred the first two movies so much... the collection as a whole was a joy to watch and i'm so glad i spent the time enjoying them!",1330128000,2,1917,4.4

1989292,5,B0001CNRLQ,"In 1931, following the unbelievable success of Dracula, Universal embarked on another horror journey, this time delving into the great mysteries of life and death. Released on November 21 1931, Frankenstein was preceded by a warning given by Edward Van Sloan which was partly for showmanship and partly as a disclaimer because studio executives actually felt the movie might frighten some people to death. Now today, this sounds absurd with the amount of gore and violence in this generations alleged ""horror movies"", but in 1931 this was new ground. The graphic violence we see in today's movies had to get a start somewhere. There's a first time for everything and for a lot of the on-screen violence of today, this was that first time.

James Whale's offering of Frankenstein differed from Tod Browning's Dracula in that Frankenstein had a much more elaborate set and what was then very innovative camera angles and lighting which followed the German expressionist films of the 1920's. The film had a very Gothic and gloomy look, opening in a graveyard where Henry Frankenstein, played by Colin Clive, and his hunchbacked assistant Fritz, played by the ever versatile Dwight Frye, are hiding, waiting for the undertaker to finish burying a man following his funeral, only so they can immediately dig him back up and cart him off to Frankenstein's laboratory. Along the way they stop to cut down a hanged man only to find that his brain is useless for Frankenstein's experiments.

Next, we are taken to the local university where Dr. Waldman, played by Edward Van Sloan, is giving a lecture on the differences between a normal brain and a criminal brain. After class, Dr Waldman is visited by Henry's fiance Elizabeth, played by Mae Clarke in a far better performance than Helen Chandler's Mina from Dracula, and his best friend Victor Moritz, played by John Boles in a strong but not over bearing performance, who ask him to go with them to Henry's watchtower laboratory to convince him to end his experiments, as they are worried he's being driven mad by his obsessions even though, at this point, they haven't the vaguest idea what Henry's experiments truly involve. Henry reluctantly lets them in out of the rain and they witness the birth of the greatest, most enduring movie character of all time.

We jump ahead a few days and see the Creature's face for the first time in the film. A series of quick zoom in cuts provides shock value to the 1931 audience and from there begins the most masterful portrayal of this classic character ever delivered. Boris Karloff endowed this poor creature with more humanity than most of the ""normal people"" around him. To see the look on his face through all the make-up after Henry shows him sunlight for the first time and then closes the skylight almost makes you want to cry. This was not a monster here. He was a child first discovering his new world full of wonder and curiosity who desperately needed affection from someone and it didn't matter who. Sadly, that would not be. Waldman was convinced that the creature was evil and before Henry could finish with his newborn ""son"", Fritz came in waving a torch about wildly and scared the poor creature half to death. Look closely at his Karloff's face when the creature pulls away from the flame. He's horrified of fire. The creature does what anyone would do when cornered and scared and he fights back only to be subdued by the three men and locked in the dungeon, chained to a wall. His sad, pathetic wails as he tries to break free are reminiscent of a two year old crying because no one will play with him. Of course Fritz has to show up and make things worse by tormenting him with fire and we see even closer now the creatures irrational terror of fire through Karloff's magnificent acting through the make up. I always thought the true villain of this movie was Fritz. He was nothing more than a bully to the poor creature and I was glad to see him get his. Unfortunately for the creature, Henry and Dr. Waldman finally decided to destroy him. After they subdue the creature, Victor arrives and warns them that Elizabeth and Henry's father, Baron Frankenstein, played by a hilarious Frederick Kerr, are on their way up the path. Soon after they arrive Henry collapses.

During Henry's recovery at home, he and Elizabeth speed forward their wedding plans while, back at the lab the monster escapes into the wilderness. As the village enjoys the festivities, out in the woods a local trapper and his daughter prepare to head into town after the father checks his traps. While he is away, the little girl, Maria, played in the films second most remembered role by 7 year old Marilyn Harris, goes to the lake to play. She meets the creature there and invites him to play. Strange how everyone who sees the creature is immediately horrified except this tiny 7 year old girl absolutely dwarfed by the creature's near 7 foot frame. She takes his hand as innocently as you please and leads him down to shore where they throw daisies into the water. When the creature runs out of flowers he thinks Maria will float just as easily and he playfully tosses her in. But poor Maria can't swim. Neither can the creature to save her. Look close as he runs away. This so called ""monster"" is scared and overcome with guilt at hurting the only person who was ever nice to him. I think his childlike innocence died in that lake with Maria. The townspeople called him a monster just because he was different. The creature came to realize that he would never be accepted, and he sought revenge against his creator for bringing him into a world that would always hate and fear him. Simply because he was different.

It was obvious that all of the gloomy, cloud covered outdoor shots were really just painted walls because the clouds and mist never moved. However this films set design blew Dracula's away in that no corners of the walls were seen and it looked real. The camera work was masterful with innovative shots from above the characters looking down on them really make this film something to see.

Just as before, the acting is what carried this picture. Colin Clive's performance of Henry Frankenstein teetered on the brink of madness without jumping in. He wasn't a bad guy, he never wanted to hurt anyone. He just had a dream, and like anyone he followed it. But he did so without first weighing the consequences of creating a new life with a child's mind in a 7 foot, 300 pound body with the strength of ten men. The films greatest performance came from it's fourth billed unknown actor, Boris Karloff. In the opening credits ""the monster"" was said to be played by '?' in an attempt at mystery for the viewer. It was also genuinely thought that whoever played the Creature would have his career ruined. Fortunately, in the end credits Karloff is revealed to have played the creature, and his career skyrocketed, based on this performance. The supporting cast all gave strong performances without taking up too much room in any scene except for Frederick Kerr who absolutely stole every scene the Baron was in, but in a good way.

The overwhelming success of Frankenstein demanded a sequel and in 1935, Bride of Frankenstein delivered in spades. James Whale returned to direct, this time with the studio giving him almost complete control over picture development. The film opened in a Victorian era mansion with the characters of Lord Byron, Percy and Mary Shelly, played by a rather beautiful Elsa Lanchester who, uncredited, also played the Bride. Colin Clive reprised his role as now Baron Henry Frankenstein and a picturesque Valerie Hobson stepped in as Elizabeth. A new and rather quirky character was added in Dr. Septimus Pretorious in a scene stealing performance by James Whale's mentor Ernest Thesiger. Dwight Frye reappeared in a much smaller role then the last film as Karl, an assistant to the two scientists. Another strong supporting role was that of Henry's busybody, gossiping housekeeper Minnie, played by Una O'Connor in a manner similar to Frederick Kerr's portrayal of the Baron in the previous film. The films most memorable supporting role was that of the blind hermit who befriended the creature, done masterfully by O.P. Heggie. The real star was, of course, ""Karloff"" as he was now known, having become famous enough to only have one name. His performance in Bride topped that of the following Son of Frankenstein and even that of the original horror masterpiece.

Henry is visited by his old professor Dr. Pretorius who tries to convince him to continue his experiments with life and death. Henry wants no part of it after what just happened, but at the same time he does want to try again and get it right.

Later on in the woods, we catch up with the creature, wandering about until he finds a lake by a waterfall and drinks from it. Seeing his reflection in the pond, he lashes out angrily at his own appearance, knowing that it is the reason he is hated by everyone he meets. This point is further made by the appearance of a young shepherdess who screams and faints at the sight of him and falls into the lake. The creature runs in to pull her to safety and is rewarded for his heroism with the girl screaming in his face. Two hunters come along, and as the creature tries to find a way to explain that he was only trying to help, they shoot him. He is soon after captured, escapes,and finds an old hermit living in a hut in the woods.

For me to try to put the scene where the creature meets the hermit into words would be a futile attempt. It simply has to be seen. The old man is blind and therefore cannot see that the creature looks the way he does. He simply accepts this poor soul into his home and feeds him, offers him a place to rest and then thanks God for sending the creature to him, as he too has longed for a friend. If watching this part doesn't get you even a little misty eyed, shut the movie off and run to your nearest Church because you clearly have no soul. Even the creature cried. If he can, so can you. Later the old man teaches the creature to speak and they live together as friends for some time, the creature having finally found someone who will accept him. But fate will not allow the creature to have a friend and two woodsmen find them as the old man plays his violin while the creature smiles and claps along like a happy child listening to his grandfather play a tune. The woodsmen attack the creature, meaning to help the old man, and during the fight the hermit's cabin is burned down. The creature stumbles from the burning building looking for his only friend, and a great sadness befalls him when he doesn't find him. Once again alone, angry, and filled with a great hatred towards humanity, he wanders to a graveyard where he meets Dr. Pretorius who is there for his own sinister purpose and tells the creature that he and Henry will make a woman friend for the creature.

Dr. Pretorius visits the newly wed Frankenstein couple to convince Henry to help him one last time and Valerie Hobson, in a riveting performance of a strong female character, tells him, as Elizabeth, in no uncertain terms to hit the bricks. After she leaves, Dr. Pretorius reveals his newest assistant to Henry; the creature. When Henry still refuses to be a part creating another unwanted life the creature kidnaps Elizabeth to force Henry to participate.

When the Bride is finally completed and the creature sees her for the first time, he is visibly smitten with her immediately. Sadly she does not feel the same and this is more than the poor creature can handle. No one, not even a woman created in the same way he was will love him. He rampages and destroys the lab, allowing Henry and Elizabeth escape.

After Bride of Frankenstein established itself as the crown jewel of Universal's horror films of the 1930's, Universal produced Dracula's Daughter in 1936, before the Laemmle family lost it, and the new management was not interested in horror films. That is, until the re-releases of Dracula and Frankenstein proved to be box office draws, nearly a decade after premiering. Universal wanted a second Frankenstein sequel and, in 1939 released Son of Frankenstein featuring Boris Karloff's final performance as the creature, Bela Lugosi as the broken necked Ygor and Basil Rathbone in an over-the-top rendition of Baron Wolf von Frankenstein, son of the now deceased Henry Frankenstein.

Set many years after the events of the first two films, Son follows Wolf's return to the town named after his family, only to find hatred and distrust there, as the townsfolk remember all too well his father's creation. At first Wolf wishes only to live in peace with his new neighbors and show them that neither he nor his late father were evil men. He moves his wife and son into the old family home and is shortly thereafter paid a visit by the closest thing he has to a friend in the village, Chief Inspector Krogh played marvelously by Lionel Atwill. We soon learn that the inspector lost his arm as a boy to the creature, and Atwill does an excellent job of never forgetting that his character can't move his right arm on its own. A rather amusing scene toward the end of the movie shows the inspector and Wolf playing darts and as the inspector must throw with his left hand and can't hold the other two darts with his right, he simply stabs the darts into his right forearm as one might stab a fork into steak.

At first Wolf will have no part in anything to do with the legend of his father's creation, but while looking over the destroyed laboratory one day he meets Ygor who shows him not only his father and grandfather's resting places below the lab, but also the creature himself, not dead as presumed but dormant due to a severe injury. He begs Wolf to restore his friend to health and Wolf refuses fearing only death will come of it, but he reconsiders when he thinks he can control the creature and prove, once and for all that his father was not evil. No sooner has the creature been revived do people start dying. The village is convinced that Wolf is behind it and want blood, but the inspector will have none of it. He investigates Wolf to the point of intruding in his home, but never oversteps his legal boundaries and never lets the townsfolk take the law into their own hands.

Basil Rathbone's performance was far more intense than Colin Clive's rendition in the first two films, but it wasn't too much. Wolf wasn't a bad guy either, he just wanted to improve on his father and get people to stop hating him and his family. Had it not been for Ygor's evil plans he may have succeeded. In the end, Wolf realized that his obligations as a father far outweighed his obligations as a son. Bela Lugosi's portrayal of Ygor was excellent in showing the broke-necked grave robber's true evil nature, though not as strong as his star making performance of Dracula. Boris Karloff saw where the direction of his creature's character was going and refused to play him again after this film. Wise choice considering the assembly line style the new management was cranking out horror movies with. This time around the creature wasn't such a sympathetic character as before, but more a mindless murdering brute and Karloff would have none of it. Son wasn't a bad film by any means, but the writing was on the wall for Universal's downward spiral.

The Ghost of Frankenstein, released in 1942, saw Bela Lugosi return as Ygor, but no other cast members reprised their roles. Set years after the previous installment, Ghost opened with the villagers of the town of Frankenstein angry that their city was avoided by outsiders, thus crippling their trade and costing shop owners their businesses. They propose to blow up the castle and after threatening the mayor with losing the next election, they do just that. Unforeseen to them is the fact that the explosion freed the creature, played this time by Lon Chaney Jr. He and Ygor leave town and seek out Henry's other son and Wolf's brother Ludwig Frankenstein, played very stiffly by Sir Cedric Hardwicke, to make the creature even stronger.

When they arrive at the town of Vasseria, Ygor asks directions to Ludwig's mental hospital while the creature wanders off and sees an absolutely adorable little girl named Cloestine, played magically by Janet Ann Gallow, playing with her little kick ball. When three bullies twice her size maliciously kick her ball onto a nearby roof and then start laughing at her, the creature steps in on the little child's behalf and scares the bejabers out of the three bullies who run away, having no more small children to pick on. In one of the few moments of tenderness shown by the creature in this film, he stands in front of Cloestine, who barely stands above his knees, and she says ""Hello"" as innocent as you please and asks him to help her get her ball down. I think Chaney was wise enough to know the direction that Karloff wanted the creature to go, and in this scene he took it there. The townspeople were alerted to the creature's presence and came to save Cloestine, not realizing she was in no danger. After her father promised the creature no harm would come to him if he returned the child, the creature obliged, only to have the cops and the rest of the town beat the tar out of him. Simply because he was different.

Ygor visits Ludwig and blackmails him into helping the creature regain his former strength by threatening to tell everyone Ludwig's family history. When the creature breaks out of jail, Ygor takes him to the hospital where he kills Ludwig's assistant Dr. Kettering, played by Barton Yarborough whose character was mentioned more after he died than before. Ludwig decides to destroy the creature by dissection but is visited by the ""ghost"" of his father, also played by Sir Cedric Hardwicke using special effects, as Colin Clive had succumbed to alcoholism in 1935, shortly after finishing Bride of Frankenstein. The ""ghost"" of Henry tells him not to destroy the creature, but give it a new brain to replace the criminal one he was originally given. Ludwig decides to give the creature Dr. Kettering's brain and is assisted by his former superior Dr. Bohmer, played by Lionel Atwill. Dr. Bohmer had committed some kind of error years before that nearly cost him his carrier, but the film never states what it was. Hoping to get his credibility back by destroying that of Ludwig, he and Ygor decide to put Ygor's brain into the monster's body with disastrous results.

In Ghost, I think Chaney tried to portray the creature as Karloff would have wanted, possibly out of respect for the veteran actor or maybe because he knew what I know, that the ""monster"" wasn't that at all. He was a lonely creature starving for acceptance in a world that simply refused him only because he was different. It may have also been part of Chaney's generous nature shining through. During production of the film, he would buy all the children on set ice cream, during filming breaks. Chaney didn't do a ""bad"" job as the Creature, but let's face it, Boris was a tough act to follow. Which is why no one ever could.

Trying for one last shot in 1944, Universal brought it's three heavy hitters together for House of Frankenstein. This film saw the return of Boris Karloff to a Frankenstein movie, but not in the role he made famous. This time Karloff played the insane Dr. Niemann, recently broke out of prison with his friend the murdering hunchback Daniel, played in a very complex performance for a supporting character by J. Carrol Naish. Upon freeing themselves from prison, they meet with Lampini's traveling freak show, who claim to have the skeleton of the one and only Dracula. After killing Lampini and stealing his show, Dr. Niemann pulls the stake from Dracula's skeleton, allowing the undead vampire king to live again in the form of a dismal performance by John Carradine, who would reprise the role the very next year in House of Dracula. Dr. Niemann makes a deal with Dracula to kill one of the men who sent the doctor to prison, in return for the doctor ensuring that Dracula's coffin is always ready for him before sunrise. However, when the police are chasing Dracula for the old man's murder, Dr. Niemann breaks his word, with disastrous results for the Count.

Afterward, Dr. Niemann and Daniel arrive at a gypsy camp where Daniel is so taken by the beauty of Ilonka the gypsy dancer, played by the beautiful Elena Verdugo, that when she is whipped by the gypsy chief Daniel charges to her rescue and viciously attacks the chief. Ilonka accompanies the pair on their quest to find the Frankenstein journals so Dr. Niemann can put the brain of one of the men who sent him to prison in the body of the Frankenstein creature, and give another man the brain of the Wolf Man. When they find the two monsters frozen in a glacier under the ruins of Frankenstein's lab, they thaw the pair out. Larry is none too pleased about being alive again, but it's a good thing he is since he carries the rest of the movie.

Much to Daniel's dismay, Ilonka falls for Larry, but they can never be together seeing as how he's a werewolf. Kind of eliminates moonlit walks on the beach when the guy transforms into a raging, murderous animal. He asks Niemann to put his brain in Larry's perfect body so Ilonka will love him, but Niemann dismisses him.

Eventually, the creature gets a little screen time, played by Glenn Strange in such a bad performance he was on the second page of closing credits at the bottom. The creature tries to save Dr. Niemann and himself from angry villagers by running into quicksand. Guess what? They sink. Imagine that. Bottom line, everything about House of Frankenstein sucked except Lon Chaney Jr.'s performance of his monster, the Wolf Man. The creature was barely on screen and when he was, he wasn't memorable at all. As I said before Dracula's presence was pointless. Boris Karloff played his mad doctor role rather well, but everyone wanted to see him as the creature. J. Carrol Naish played a  character very similar to Karloff's creature of the early films, as a nice guy who would kill if provoked and had physical deformity. Not Universal's best outing.

The absence of James Whale's directorial genius was apparent in the later films and they suffered for it. With the studio under new management, he knew he wouldn't be allowed to do it his way anymore and wisely left before his reputation was destroyed by making poor quality movies in line with the company's new philosophy on horror films. ""Suck every dime you can out of every franchise you can, no matter how stupid the idea as long as one or more of our characters is in it."" With two cinematic masterpieces, one good film, one OK film and one festering pile of poo, this set is well worth the price, mostly for the first three films and the documentaries on the first two. Both go tremendously in-depth on each of their respective titles, Frankenstein and Bride, including the heavy amounts of censorship both films faced at the time of their release (don't worry, they are both fully restored here), though the first one talks a little more about the creatures appearance in the later films while Bride's documentary talks mostly about that movie. I think it's well worth the watch just to see the photo of Boris Karloff in full creature make-up with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth drinking a cup of tea, grinning at the camera like he was king of the world. And in the world of Frankenstein, he still is.",1317600000,,23560,4.671084337349398

Son of Frankenstein began to get a little thin.  Ghost of Frankenstein, Meh! House of Frankenstein, yawn.  The set is worth having.  Boris Karlof is the best.",1309478400,,329,4.684210526315789
1989296,5,B0001CNRLQ,"I have 4 of these Legacy Sets, and of the Mummy, Dracula, the Wolfman, and Frankenstein, this one is surely the best by far. Like all the other sets, none of these movies have been digitally remastered. This is a criminal shame, as these movies deserver it (at least Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, and Son of Frankenstein do.)

These movies are all fairly short running about 60-70 minutes each. The first three are quite good and could almost be seen as a single film in three chapters, with a slightly disappointing third chapter. In all three Karloff portrays the monster to perfection. One minute you are feeling sorry for the poor beast and the next thing you know,  you are trying not to wet your couch. Truly brilliant!

For these three films alone I recommend this set. The following two movies are examples of how a franchise can go wrong, horribly, horribly wrong. Still if you buy the set give them a watch.

My set cam with a sponge page in between the two disks so that the disks would not move in shipping. I had no problem with the quality of the DVD's although I was a little disappointed in the dual sided DVD used for the second disk.

I wish they had used a remastered version of ""Frankenstein"", with the minute or so of re-added footage they found for the criterion version a few years back, but it s not. This is a good copy, but not great. For the price this is still an excellent set.",1306368000,,1413,4.44015444015444

Every one of the five films collected here is worth revisiting. Not only that, but the DVD transfers are crisp, the soundtracks clear, the subtitles well-done, and the extra features entertaining and informative.

Mainly bringing this up cause these have been on sale lately, they've been out since like 2004, and sometimes I notice that for some wierd reason, movies will suddenly stop being put out in a particular format, so I decided I would have the entire legacy collection movies, before it ever gets to be too late, maybe I just have erroneous fears or such, dunno.
Anyway, Frankenstein movies are great in this movie pack of the legacy collection, the original, and so on.  I too can remember spooky saturday nights(1970's and 1980's) when a good ole classic was put on television when I was growing up, and all the older movies were a delight to watch.  The extras with the movies are a must have to watch too, and I can't rightly figure out how they can improve these movie sets except the usual recent treatments of movies into blue ray, but these regular dvds get upconverted anyway to near hd standards in my blue ray player panasonic bd605 refurbished, that I bought through amazon last month as refurbished(basically last years model renamed and new).  Played on my 720P 32 inch lcd screen, and the blue ray, resolution is way way way better than any old saturday night movie I ever seen as a kid, thats for sure.

1989336,5,B0001CNRLQ,"I picked this up at a liquidation sale when our local Hollywood Video store went belly-up. What a great find it is as well. The audio and video clarity throughout is impeccable. I recall seeing at least three of these films (the original, Bride and House) on afternoon Creature Features when I was growing up, but I don't think they ever looked or sounded this good (which could equally be due to the lackluster TV's in my household growing up). The extras are interesting and informative, especially the segment with commentary by Sara Karloff talking about her father's experience with the film and his life in general. I also enjoyed watching the orginal theatrical trailers for all of the films on this collection.

As for the films themselves, it's all pretty much been said already. I do however count myself in the minority of those who consider the original Frankenstein to be superior to Bride.

Frankenstein:  A true classic in every sense of the word. Karloff's portrayal of the monster enables the viewer to sympathize with him without ever speaking a word, although his eyes, hands, mannerisms and expressions speak volumes and a true range of emotions. It's a dark, powerful, spooky, and above all, a sad film that is equally about humanity's aesthetic shallowness and mob mentality as it is about the creation of a ""monster"". It even makes for a great parable of child abuse and neglect, to illustrate how our own human monsters are frequently created after having been born innocent. This is, in my view, the gem of the collection.

Bride of Frankenstein: I know many prefer this to the original. I don't get it. It's got some good scenes, but director James Whale seems as if he can't make up his mind whether he wants to do a parody or a straight up horror film. Karloff disagreed with Whale's decision to give the monster speech in the film, and I think Karloff had it right. Worst of all, the comic book like Dr. Praetorius character and his ridiculous ""little people in bottles"" scene undermines the whole experience. The prologue with Mary Shelley & Lord Byron also seems contrived. Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh -- there's a lot that does work in this film. The scene with the hermit is touching, and the ending scene in which the Bride is revealed is classic, but overall, I think this film gets too much praise, and does not eclipse the original.

Son of Frankenstein: I really like this one! The biggest problem with ""Son"" is that so much of it was parodied by Mel Brooks in Young Frankenstein, that it's hard to view it without thinking of those scenes (darts!!!). Karloff's time on screen is brief, but well done, and here is it Lugosi who steals the show, with his iconic and great portrayal of Ygor. The studio lavished big money on this one and it shows -- great sets, great cast, and whereas I feel ""Bride"" is overrated, I think this one is underrated.

Ghost of Frankenstein: At this point, quality goes south in a big way. This is a ridiculous film, good for a viewing a curiosity, but nowhere near the quality of the prior three. Lugosi returns as Ygor and is adequate (not great this time), however the conclusion, with the monster speaking in Bela Lugosi's voice after his brain has been transplanted into the creature is laughable. This is the worst of the bunch.

House of Frankenstein: Pure camp -- and pure entertainment. Karloff returns, although not as the monster, and he chews up every scene he's in. Some great performances all around, except for John Carradine, who gives the worst portrayal of Dracula (and not just in this film -- anyone ever see ""Billy the Kid Meets Dracula?"") ever to be put on screen. Not creepy or dark, but a heck of a lot of fun, and much better than ""Ghost"".

Overall, the Frankenstein Legacy collection is well worth a spot in the collection of any fan of Universal's horror films from the 30's and 40's.",1281139200,,3878,4.659356725146199

The video/audio transfers were very well done --- certainly the best clarity that I've experienced for these old classics.  Additionally, I wasn't expecting the re-insertion of missing/censored scenes --- so was gratified to see those.
Some titles had alternative AUDIO-tracks --- with behind-the-scenes commentary.  A few of those were well-done and informative, but others were of questionable value.
MINOR PROBLEM:  A shipping problem rendered one of the platters unreadable.  I used Amazon's return-procedure (a first time for me) and obtained a replacement in less that a week.  That was superb service --- and very easy to use.

1, FRANKENSTEIN- The crowning achievement of Boris Karloff's career which cemented his place in the history of horror! What I could say about his performance would be embarassing, as much has been written about it already by those with far more ""film-savvy"" than myself! But what I can say is that it is refreshing to watch this film with its restored sequences which, of course, had been deleted by the fun-police of that era! The film quality has been improved and the digital sound makes one feel like they were in a theater's luxury box back in 1931!

FOUR STARS

2  THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTIEN- One of the greatest films in the history of cinema! Nearly flawless and peppered with director James Whale's bizarre sense of humor.

FIVE STARS

3. SON OF FRANKENSTEIN- The minuses: Basil Rathbone's surprisingly hammy performance. I know his character was supposed to be agitated over having restored ""The Monster"" to life after it had been rendered comatose by an errant bolt of lightning, but who coached Basil into this laughable caricature? Another minus, the great Boris Karloff is virtually sleepwalking through the picture! Spoiler Alert: Only in the sequence where we see ""The Monster's"" reaction to the death of Ygor, does a flash of his previous brilliance surface. Also, I suspect he didn't wear the full equipment in every sequence. When the monster first meets the titular character, he just barely seems to be taller than Rathbone. But during the climactic battle, he seems to tower over his attackers! Those who criticize Bela Lugosi for only wearing a padded suit in FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLF MAN should take another look at this flick. Speaking of Lugosi,  he is one of the Pluses that saves this film from being a waste of time. His Ygor is one of the grand roles in Univeral's horror library, one that in my opinion trumps his 1931 appearance as Dracula! Unlike with Dracula, Bela has a much firmer grasp of English and in this movie, he is able to upstage Karloff! Yet another plus: the wonderful, Expressionistic set design!

THREE AND A HALF STARS

4. THE GHOST OF FRANKESTEIN- Lon Chaney, Jr. in the flattop. His Monster is more massive and imposing than either Kaloff's or Lugosi's but it evokes neither pathos nor terror. Lugosi is back as Ygor and that's the only reason to resist the urge to hit the ""skip"" button!

THREE STARS

5. THE HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN- Yup, this is Universal's first 3-in-1 flick, where you get several monsters for the price of one movie ticket. Karloff is back-- but only as a creepy mad doctor, a waste of his talent and time. John Carradine portrays Dracula and Yes, I have heard that his version of the character is more true to the original novel-- but darn it, his Dracula comes across as weak and about as menacing as Batman's butler Alfred! I mean, c'mon, at nearly 70, Lugosi locked horns with the Wolf Man in ABBOT & COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN, but here, Carradine is fleeing from a posse like a two-bit bank robber! However, this movie's saving grace is the heart wrenching triangle involving a hunchback, Lon Chaney,Jr's Wolf Man and a beautiful gypsy girl named Ilonka, played by actress\dancer Elena Verdugo (that's right, the same Elena Verdugo who played MARCUS WELBY's Nurse assistant!). Lawrence (Wolf-Man) Talbot's saga should have ended here, but unfortunately it didn't. Glenn Strange plays the Frankenstein Monster in a performance that probably inspired the creators of Herman Munster!

THREE AND A HALF STARS (not a great movie but it's a lot of fun!)

One of my arguments is that it should have included Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man. You need that movie so you can follow along the series. Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man goes after Ghost of Frankenstein and before House of Frankenstein. Without that movie then there are a lot of unanswered questions. You cannot go from A to C without B. Also the packaging just focuses on Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein and the rest of the movies get nothing more then a footnote. Son of Frankenstein is the only one with out a theatrical trailer or anything extra to it. Bride of Frankenstein, Son of Frankenstein, Ghost of Frankenstein, and House of Frankenstein all say underneath of them bonus material; so what is the bonus material?

Scenes

Frankenstein is one hour and eleven minutes long and was released on November 21, 1931. It is hard to figure out where the movie takes place. You have actors with both British and English accents and the sets look to be, Germany, Austria or even Prussian. Also they movie never mentions the time period and since there is no sign of a phone anywhere it makes it even harder. The only thing electrical is the lab of Dr. Frankenstein in the old tower.  Boris Karloff does a great job as the Monster. From the first time the Monster makes an entrance to the death scene at the end; where a windmill house is set to fire and a wood beam falls on him. During the opening credits a ? is shown next the Monster. Only at the end of the film when the credits begin to roll is it revealed that Boris Karloff played the Monster. Karloff would play the Monster in two more films. The movie begins with a warning from actor Edward Van Sloan indicating the scariness of the movie and if you are due to fainting spells or have a weak stomach, leave now. After the warning the movie begins and the scene is at a commentary where a funeral is taking place. Dr. Frankenstein and Fritz, his loyal assistant, are hiding nearby waiting patiently for the party to leave so they can rob the grave. With the body in tow the two head back to the tower. Back at the ancestral home of Baron Von Frankenstein, Henry's fiance Elizabeth is upset over a letter she has received from Henry. Henry's best friend, Victor Moritz, tries to help her. They both seek Henry's old mentor Doctor Waldman. Doctor Waldman tells Elizabeth and Victor about Henry's experiments and how his demand for body parts got out of control. Henry left the institute and that was the last he heard of him. Elizabeth and Victor convince Doctor Waldman to with them to visit Henry at the old watch tower. The trio arrives at the old watch tower just moments before Dr. Frankenstein is to make the greatest experiment of his life. Dr. Frankenstein escorts all three to the lab to witness his creation to come to life. When they lower lab table from the electrical storm and the Monster moves his right hand a little Dr. Frankenstein utters his famous words ""It's Alive"". The next day Elizabeth and Victor are back home and Henry's father thinks there is another woman but both tries to tell him that he is finishing up his experiment. The Baron does not believe it and all three head back to the watch tower. Back at the watch tower Dr. Frankenstein shows compassion for the Monster saying it is only is a few days old and have not seen light. It is during this time that movie audience is first introduced to the monster. Henry sort of acts like a father figure at first then Fritz brings in a lighted torch and the monster goes wild. Fritz, Henry, and Doctor Waldman ties up the creature and take him to the dungeon. It is there that the monster makes his first kill. Fritz takes delight in torturing the Monster where Henry just wants him left alone. One day Fritz pushes the Monster too far and the creature kills Fritz. Dr. Frankenstein and Doctor Waldman are able to subdue the Monster and come to conclusion that creature must be destroyed. During the struggle to sedate the Monster Henry is severely hurt and is sent home to recover. Doctor Waldman is about to operate on the Monster when the Monster awakes and kills Doctor Waldman; victim number two. The Monster escapes and is next seen playing with little Maria and both are tossing flowers into the lake. When there are no more flowers, the Monster tosses Maria into the lake to see if she can float. When the Monster realizes what he has done and leaves. The father of Maria carries her lifeless body into town and tells the Burgomaster that she was murdered. The Burgomaster organizes a search party for the murder with Henry leading one of the groups. Henry finds the Monster and the Monster renders Henry unconscious. The Monster takes Henry to the top of an abandon windmill. The villagers trap the Monster and the Monster throws out the windmill. Dr. Henry Frankenstein is taken back to his home to recover. The windmill is set to fire and the Monster is destroyed. If you are a fan of the Universal Horror\Monster movies, then this is for you. Dr. Henry Frankenstein is shown resting in bed in the final scene. Frankenstein gets an AAAAA+++++.

Bride of Frankenstein is one hour and fifteen minutes and released on April 22, 1935. This movie is half horror and half comedy. I will leave it up to the critics as to which Universal's Frankenstein movie is the best, but The Bride of Frankenstein is at least one of the funniest. The scene between the blind hermit and the Monster are laughable. When the hermit befriends the Monster, the hermit is thanking God for his new friend and one can see a tear from the Monster's eye. With The Bride of Frankenstein, the Monster has developed some new skills. He drinks, eat, smoke, even talks in this one. The Monster does not speak again until the final scenes of The Ghost of Frankenstein. After that movie, he becomes a mute in the rest of the Universal monster movies. Returning are Colin Clive as Baron Henry von Frankenstein, Dwight Frye as Karl (he was Fritz in the last movie), and Boris Karloff as The Monster. Mae Clarke plays Elizabeth von Frankenstein; taking over the role from Valerie Babette Louise. Elsa Lanchester plays Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley and The Monster's Mate. In the movie credits she is only given screen as Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. A ? is show next to The Monster's Mate. Just like in the original Frankenstein movie. Boris Karloff is only listed as Karloff. The Bride of Frankenstein begins on a stormy night at the home of Lord Bryon whose guests are Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Shelley. Lord Bryon recounts the making of the Frankenstein monster and bits and pieces of the of the 1931 Frankenstein movie are seen. Then were back and the home again and Mary Shelley tells that there is more to the story and we flash to the present and pick up at the very end of the Frankenstein movie where the old windmill is completely burned and Dr. Frankenstein is taken back to his home. Henry is presumed dead until his hand start moving and wakes up. Back and the windmill the parents of little Maria are grieving of their daughter and the father does not believe the monster has died. He walks over to the windmill and falls in. The Monster comes from the shadow and kills Hans. The Monster escapes from the windmill and throws Hans's wife in the windmill to her death. Next the Monster comes across Minnie and she flees in terror. We do not know if it is later in the evening or later on in the week since the movie does not make that clear, but Dr. Septimus Pretorius comes a calling and asks to speak to Dr. Henry Frankenstein. Dr. Pretorius was Henry's mentor at the university and was kick out of there for knowing to much as Dr. Pretorius claims. Dr. Pretorius convinces Henry to come with him to his lab to show what he has been working on. He shows Henry six little people that are no bigger then four inches. The six people are: queen, king, archbishop, devil, ballerina and mermaid. Dr. Frankenstein claims that it is not science but black magic and says he won't help Dr. Pretorius. In the next scene we see the Monster at a pond healing his wounds and drinking water. There is a Sheppard girl who has fallen in the lake and the Monster rescue hers. When she wakes she begins to scream in fright and there are some hunters there and shoot at the Monster. The creature flees in pain. The hunters warn the Burgomaster and the Burgomaster sends a mob out to hunt the monster down. He is caught, brought to jail, chained down, and when the guard leaves, the Monster frees himself and escapes. He makes his way to the home of a blind hermit and the hermit befriends the Monster. The hermit (his name never given in the movie) gives the Monster soup and bread and finally rest. When the Monster is lying on the bed, the hermit says a prayer and at that point the Monster weeps. We are to assume it is sometime later in the week because the hermit has taught the Monster who to speak. He can say words like bread, drink, smoke, good, and wood. Later on some hunters walk in and recognize the Monster and begin to shoot. During the struggle a broom is knocked into the fire and the cottage sets on fire. The two hunters escort the hermit out and the Monster is left without a friend. Later that evening the Monster is in a cemetery being chases by villagers. The Monster knocks over a figure and takes shelter in the crypt. Dr. Pretorius is in the crypt also but in a different location. He is there with two grave robbers stealing bones of a female corpse. This is the only scene where we can get any indication of what time period the movie is in. Karl is told to read the date on the coffin and it is revealed she died in 1899. In the crypt Dr. Pretorius pay the robbers and those two leave. Dr. Pretorius stays behind to have bread, smoke, and drink. The Monster walks in on Dr. Pretorius and the two have a talk. Dr. Pretorius becomes the Monster new friend. At the home of Henry and Elizabeth Frankenstein, Dr. Pretorius comes a calling and once Elizabeth leaves the room Dr. Pretorius try to convince Henry to join him in his final experiment. Henry at first refuses Dr. Pretorius request. Dr. Pretorius then shows the Monster to Henry says that there has been some improvement on the creature like his speech. The Monster is now the master and Dr. Frankenstein is now the servant. The Monster orders Dr. Frankenstein to make his mate. Dr. Frankenstein will do nothing until the Monster leaves the room. When Dr. Pretorius is about to close the door, he tells the Monster now. That is the signal to kidnap Elizabeth and when Henry cannot find her, he agree to assist Dr. Pretorius to create the Monster's mate. The operation goes on schedule and when the Mate is fully clothed and sees her future husband rejects him. Realizing that he will never have a friend decides to blow up the old watch tower but Dr. Frankenstein and Elizabeth  are allow to live and flee the tower. What ever became of Dr. Pretorius and the Monster's mate remained unclear. It is assumed that they did not survive the explosion. This is a great movie to own and watch. Bride of Frankenstein gets an AAAAA+++++.

Scenes

Son of Frankenstein is the longest Universal monster\horror film. It is one hour and thirty-nine minutes long and was released on January 13, 1939. This would also be the last time Boris Karloff would portray the Monster. Lon Chaney, Jr. would take over the role in the Ghost of Frankenstein. In this movie the suit that the Monster wore in Frankenstein and the Bride of Frankenstein is gone. The Monster is now wearing a fur vest and tall boots. One must assume that the clothes he was wearing in the Bride of Frankenstein were destroyed when the building blew up. Also gone is his ability to speak as well. The viewer has to assume he lost that also when he blew himself up in the last movie. Also on a side note, there is only one clamp on his head. In the Bride of Frankenstein the Monster has several clamps on his head. The Monster does seem to have evolved in this movie. He can walk better and there is more thought in the Monster killing. In the Son of Frankenstein, we are introduced to Ygor for the first time, played by Bla Lugosi. The Son of Frankenstein takes thirty years into the future from the ending of the Bride of Frankenstein; at least we are to assume that. Baron Wolf von Frankenstein looks to be in his thirties. Basil Rathbone was 43 years old when the picture was made. In this picture you have a mixture of English and American actors and one Austria-Hungarian actor. The movie starts off with the arrival of Baron Wolf von Frankenstein and his family to the town of Frankenstein to reclaim his family ancestral home. It is hinted that he has been living in the United States for some years. The townspeople and Burgomaster and his Burghers are there to meet him and not to greet him. They hand over two boxes to Wolf; the big box contains the journal and notes his father's experiments and the smaller box holds the key to unlock the bigger box. Shortly after Wolf, Elsa, and Peter arrive at the castle, Inspector Krogh makes a complimentary greeting. He let them know his services are at there disposal. It is the next day and Wolf goes for a walk in the garden and comes across the old ruins where the monster was made. In the Bride of Frankenstein and Frankenstein the monster was created and died at an abandoned watch tower away from the castle; miles away we are to presume. Ygor meets Dr. Frankenstein and shows him a secret that been hidden for year. He takes him to the crypts of his father and grandfather and show the Monster at the end and between the two crypts lying in a comatose state. Ygor explains that the Monster was out hunting food and lighting struck him and he walks no more. During the conversation between the two of them Wolf says something along the line, ""do you mean to imply that it is my brother."" Dr. Frankenstein agrees to make the Monster well again.  Dr. Frankenstein refurbishes the old ruins and turns it into a lab just like his father before him. Unlike the first time when lightning was used to bring the Monster to life, Wolf uses a generator and electrodes to bring the Monster back to life. When the Monster does not wake up from his coma, Dr. Frankenstein believes he has failed. He heads back to the castle disappointed. Later on we find out the Monster is alive and doing Ygor's bidding. It is not mention in the movie nor is it explained how the two met and how does Ygor have control over him. Later on Wolf finds out the Monster is alive a rushes back to the lab. He discovers the monster is gone and starts gathering some instruments in the lab. While Wolf if doing that, the Monster climbs up from the lave pits and makes presents himself to Wolf. Wolf turns around and is startled. The monster touches Wolf and finds some resemblance between Henry Frankenstein and Wolf. The Monster sees himself in a mirror and realizes that he is alive and to a point is upset to still be living. He grabs Wolf and brings him into the mirror and realizes it is not his creator. Wolf tells Ygor that he must remain in the lab if he wants to keep the Monster well. Later that evening Ygor gets the Monster to kill the final Burgher who hanged him several years ago. The villagers are outraged that there have been two killings since Baron Wolf von Frankenstein and plan to storm the castle. Inspector Krogh puts guards in front of the castle to protect the Baron and Baroness. Baron Frankenstein is upset that he is a prisoner in his own castle. Baron Frankenstein tells Inspector Krogh that he is going to kick Ygor off the property. When Wolf does find Ygor, Ygor comes after him with a hammer and Wolf shoots three times and kills Ygor. When the Monster finds Ygor lifeless body, he first shows sympathy that his friend has died and then decides to kill Peter, Wolf's son. He finds Peter and brings him back to the lab. Back at the castle Elsa von Frankenstein rushes in and says Peter is missing. Both Wolf and Inspector Krogh go in different directions to find Peter. Inspector Krogh finds Peter and the Monster first and Inspector Krogh shoots at the Monster. The Monster rips off Inspector Krogh artificial arm and seems surprise that it is not a real arm. Just then Wolf swing from a chain from the top of the lab and knocks the Monster into the lava pits killing the Monster and Peter is saved. At the end of the movie Wolf turns over the estate to the town of Frankenstein and telling the people to do what they please and Wolf, Elsa, and Peter board the train and leave the town never to come back. Just like the first two movies this is an excellent movie. A must for any Universal monster\horror fans. Son of Frankenstein gets an AAAAA+++++.

Scenes
Theatrical Trailer

The Ghost of Frankenstein is one hour and 7 minutes long and was released on March 13, 1942. This would be Lon Chaney, Jr. only portrayal of the Monster. The film picks up years after the Monster is supposed to have died in the sulfuric pits. Instead his body has been in a coma like tomb. Ygor who we assumed was shot to death in the last picture is alive. The villagers at the town hall say that there is a curse on the town and it s the curse of Frankenstein. The villager's wants to blow up the castle and the Mayor thinks this is all non-sense, but does not want to be ousted in the next election. The Mayor gives and let the villagers blow up the castle. Later that evening the villagers head to the castle to blow it up, but Ygor puts up a losing fight to defend the castle. Ygor escapes through the catacombs and during one of the explosions some of sulfur falls off the Monster. Ygor removes the rest of the sulfur off the Monster and the two makes their escapes before the villages finally do them in. During a thunderstorm the Monster is struck by lightning and becomes strong again. In the last movie it made him and left him in a comatose state. The two head off to Wolf's brother, Dr. Ludwig Frankenstein so he can make the Monster better. The two are in the town of Vasaria and Dr. Ludwig Frankenstein lives in a chateau at the end of town. Before the two can head over there, the Monster wonders off and befriends a little girl named Cloestine. A bunch of bad boys have knocked her ball on a roof. Cloestine asks the Monster if he can retrieve her ball. (In Frankenstein and the Ghost of Frankenstein, little girls are not afraid on the Monster.) The Monster picks up Cloestine and heads up to get her ball. Why on his quest a couple of the town villagers try to take the Monster down and are killed. The Monster retrieves the ball and escorts Cloestine off the roof. He hands the little girl over to her father and the police arrest him. Erik Ernst, the town prosecutor, seeks out Dr. Frankenstein and asks him to come to the police station to examine the Monster. Dr. Frankenstein agrees to do so after he has finished some work. After Erik leaves, Ygor visits Dr. Frankenstein and blackmail the doctor into making him well. Ygor tells Dr. Frankenstein that he would expose the family heritage to the village Dr. Frankenstein reluctantly agrees to do so. At the police station, the Monster is being interrogated by the prosecutor and Ludwig makes his entrance. The Monster seems to recognize the doctor, but when Ludwig denies knowing the Monster, the Monster goes into a fit of rage. It is only through Ygor's music that the Monster calms down and escapes from the station. The two flee the village and later that evening heads to the doctor's chateau. Once there the Monster gets angry and accidently kills Dr. Kettering. Dr. Frankenstein and his daughter Elsa her some noise and hurry to the lab. The Monster captures Elsa and Dr. Frankenstein heads to another room and turns on some form of knock out gas on The Monster, Elsa, and Ygor. When everybody awakes, Elsa is in her bed, Ygor is now a prisoner, and the Monster is strapped to a lab table. The Monster is able to free himself from the straps, but before he can get completely loose Dr. Frankenstein is able to sedate the Monster. It is in the lab that Dr. Frankenstein decides the only way to kill the Monster is through dissection; take him apart piece by piece. Dr. Frankenstein asks for Dr. Theodore Bohmer assistant, but Dr. Bohmer will not do it. Later in the movie just as Dr. Ludwig Frankenstein is about to do the operation, the spirit of Dr. Henry Frankenstein appears. He tells them the Monster has a brain of a criminal but if good brain was but in there then the name of Frankenstein is restored. This convinces Dr. Ludwig Frankenstein to use the brain of Dr. Kettering. This time Dr. Bohmer agrees to help Dr. Frankenstein because it is not murder. Ygor wants nothing to do with it because the Monster will longer be his friend. The tell Ygor it is a new brain or he will dissect the Monster. Ygor reluctantly agrees to the operation. Ygor tells the Monster he is getting a new brain and he will be better. Between then and the operation the Monster leaves the chateau and head to the home of Cloestine Hussman. How the Monster escaped and how he knew with Cloestine lives the movie did not explain. The Monsters hears Ygor music and at first ignores it. The Monster kidnaps Cloestine and grabs her ball. In grabbing the ball he unknowingly knocks over a lantern and a fire begins. The Monster is back at the chateau Ygor tries to convince the Monster to let her go, but the Monster pushes Ygor and nearly crushes Ygor to death. In Ludwig study the Monster brings the girl to Dr. Frankenstein indicating he wants her brain in his head. Dr. Frankenstein is able to free Cloestine and gives the girl to Elsa. Dr. Frankenstein lures the Monster back to the lab. Early on Ygor had convinced Dr. Bohmer to put Ygor's brain into the Monster. When the procedure begins Dr. Bohmer removes Ygor's brain and presents it to Dr. Frankenstein believing it to be Dr. Kettering's brain. At then end of the operation the Monster face is wrapped in bandages. Back at the village and two weeks later the villagers are wondering what ever happen to Ygor and the Monster. They believe that Dr. Frankenstein is hiding the Monster. One of the policemen alerts Erik and he gets on his horse and rides over there. Erik convinces the villagers not to do anything until he has had a chance to talk to Dr. Frankenstein. Once inside the home he tells Dr. Frankenstein that his safety is in jeopardy and at that time Dr. Frankenstein takes him to the dungeon room to show what he has done. Once there Dr. Frankenstein starts talking and asking the Monster do you know who I am. The Monster speaks back in Ygor voice and Dr. Frankenstein is startled and shock by this. Ygor tells Dr. Frankenstein that he convinced Dr. Bohmer to put Ygor's brain into the Monster and now he has the strength of a hundred men. Erik escapes and locks the door as he leaves. Ygor breaks open the door and along with Dr. Bohmer and Dr. Frankenstein heads into the lab to gas the villagers. Dr. Frankenstein tries to stop them but is shoved aside. It is that moment that Ygor realizes that he is blind. Dr. Frankenstein tells Ygor that he has Dr. Kettering' blood in him and that his brain and Dr. Kettering's blood are not compatible and won't feed the senses. Ygor outraged by this kills Dr. Bohmer and start tearing the lab apart. In do this he sets the lab on fire and quickly the chateau catches fire. How Ygor got from the lab to the study the movie does not indicate, but Ygor is in the study when a beam falls on him and meet his end. During the fire scene of the movie, you can see the facial make-up melting off Lon Chaney, Jr. face. In Son of Frankenstein, the Monster and Ygor are portrayed as best buddies. In The Ghost of Frankenstein their relationship seems to come apart as the Monster no longer responds to Ygor control over him. The Monster is back in his old clothes like the original Frankenstein movie. One must assume the sulfur burns his old clothes and the sulfur cost him his eyesight as well. During the whole filming his eyes are not wide open. The movie loses itself after forty minutes and also is gone is the magic as well. The movie would mark the last time the Monster appears as a solo. Starting with Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, he must share movie with his fellow horror monsters. Ghost of Frankenstein movie gets a B- from me.

House of Frankenstein is one hour and eleven minute long and was released on December 1, 1944. The movie begins inside Neustadt prison cell where Dr. Gustav Niemann is serving a sentence for digging up bodies and performing unorthodox experiments. The movie does not indicate how long he is in there for. One evening the is a terrific storm and a clap of thunder or two knocks out a wall and ceialing and Dr. Niemann and Daniel make their escape. The two take refuge in a traveling horror exhibit show and kill Professor Bruno Lampini and his driver. The two head to the town of Reigelberg where Brgermeister Hussman lives. Hussman is one of three men that sent him away fifteen years ago. The two arrive at the town and set up the Horror Show. There they are met by Brgermeister Hussman, Rita Hussman, Karl Hussman, and Inspector Arnz.  Brgermeister Hussman seems to recognize Dr. Niemann but is not sure of himself. During a fit of anger Dr. Niemann pulls the stake out of the dead body of Count Dracula and unintentionly brings him back to life. Dr. Niemann and Dracula strike a deal with one anonther and later that evening Dracula kills Brgermeister Hussman and tries to take Rita Hussman as his bride with him. This is foiled when during the chase Dr. Niemann throws out Count Dracula's coffin and before he has a chance to get back into the coffin dies when the sun. Poor fellow, he should have use a suntan lotion 15 or better. Dr. Niemann and Daniel make there way to the Village of Frankenstein. At the village the encounter a band of gypsies putting on a show. After the show is over they witness Ilonka getting whipped by her boss. Daniel rescues Ilonka rescues and Dr. Niemann allow her to come along. Later that evening they arrive at the ruins of the Frankenstein castle and looks for the records of the late Dr. Frankenstein. While looking Daniel fall through some loose grounds and Dr. Niemann goes to help Daniel. It is there that they discover the ice frozen bodies of the Frankenstein monster and the Wolf Man. The two begin thawing the bodies and when Larry awakens he asks why he did so. Dr. Niemann tells Larry if he can help find the records of Dr. Frankenstein, he would cure him. Larry agrees to do so and finds the records. The five of them make there way to the home of Dr. Niemann in Vasaria. The four of them begin to get the lab working again so Dr. Niemann get to work right away. Later on Dr. Niemann and Daniel head into the village in the evening and capture Ullman and Strauss; the other two men who sent Dr. Niemann to prison. Dr. Nieman tells the two: ""I'm going to repay you for betraying me; I'm going to give that brain of yours a new home in the skull of the Frankenstein monster. As for you Strauss, I'm going to give you the brain of the wolfman so that all your waking hours will be spent in untold agony awaiting the full of the moon.. which will change you into a werewolf."" Copy and pasted from TCM.com website. The surgery is only half successful. Gone is Ygor and inside the Monster is Ullman's brain. When it is Larry's turn to be operated on it is too late. Larry has turn into a werewolf and is on the kill.  Ilonka who found out from Daniel that Larry is a werewolf is out to kill him with silver bullet. It winds up being a double murder. The werewolf has attacked Ilonka and during the struggle Ilonka fires the silver bullet. The way the werewolf is holding his hands over his stomach and not his heart, gives some indication that Ilonka missed the main target and lived again in The House of Dracula movie. Daniel see Ilonka lifeless body and brings to Dr. Niemann and Dr. Niemann tells Daniel it is too late. Daniel is upset and attacks Dr. Niemann. The Monster sees this and attacks Daniel and throws him out of the window and kills him. Just then the villagers who were looking for the werewolf enter the castle. The Monster takes Dr. Niemann and flees to the marsh. The villagers follow and set fire to the marsh. The Monster and Dr. Niemann meet their end when they are trapped in quicksand and drown. The script is poorly written. Since this was a continuation of Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man; a lot of stuff seems out of place. First the town of where the Wolf Man and the Monster is destroyed is Vasaria. Yet in this film the have them shown having been destroyed in the Village of Frankenstein. Second, in Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man the records were destroyed; yet they seemed to have made miraculous recovery. In House of Frankenstein John Carradine plays Dracula a. k. a. Baron Latos. No offense to John Carradine, but the movie could have done with out his part. Even some of the subplots and the gypsy girl stuff seem lame. If you just want this movie to round out your classic Universal Horror\Monster collection, see if you can rent from a friend or buy it on eBay.

1989391,4,B0001CNRLQ,"I was in heaven when I first saw all of these classic macabre movies in a set! What an amazing deal.

Frankenstein - Parts of the movie may be too slow for some people to watch, but certain scenes are worth the wait. The monster has your sympathy, and unnerves you at the same time.

Bride of Frankenstein - Elsa Lanchester as the Bride of Frankenstein is amazing. She 'haunts' the role like a confused wild animal. Again, some scenes may be too dull, but the ending is well worth it.

If you are only interested in the endings (by far the most exciting parts), I would recommend watching those scenes on Youtube.com, and purchasing a movie you enjoy the whole way through.

House of Frankenstein caught my attention because the array of characters; The Monster, Wolf Man, and Count Dracula. Surprisingly, these characters hardly interact with each other, and seem to flitter around then disappear.

I was rooting for the monster all the way.

I could go on, but basically, these films are an insult to intelligence and have been hyped up by teen pranksters who saw them at the theater in the 50's/60's and have been following every Frankenstein feature convention for the last 45 years.

I must say that the nay-sayers who gave such poor reviews to these wonderful collections based upon their own individual playback issues caused more than a little concern for me.  Perhaps they should try their disks in more than one type of DVD player.  Not all DVD players like all disks.

I sincerely recommend these collections for what they are; good quality in both audio and video.  Certainly as good or better than when they were shown on TV in the 50's, 60's and 70's.

Perhaps for those un-pleasable few who complain that their quality isn't up to modern standards; take a look at when they were made.  There was no such thing as high definition or 5.1 surround sound in the 30's, 40's or 50's.  Give it a rest!",1230076800,,977,4.627906976744186

Both films are in fairly pristine condition, although ""Frankenstein"" seems to be less vivid and clean than the 1999 VHS transfer.  Only minimal restoration seems to have been done to the other three films in this collection. Overall, the image and sound qualities are very high.  This 2004 release lacks about half the extras found on the 2006 ""75th Anniversary"" release, and one wonders why Universal did this version. (Obviously, to build off interest on it's 2004 film ""Van Helsing,"" a true stinker of a movie.)

1989446,5,B0001CNRLQ,"This legacy set is the best way to own ""Frankenstein"". There is commentary on both this film and the equally renowned ""Bride of Frankenstein"".  If you get the 75th anniversary edition, you don't have that great sequel. Although Frankenstein was full of the existential doubts that were common in precode horror, Karloff gave the monster a kind of pathos that you can't imagine any other actor giving to that role. ""Bride of Frankenstein"" is a high quality production that is a bit of a miracle. Made after the advent of the production code, director James Whale had to play the censors like a violin to get this movie made. He appeased the censors by adding more and more religious imagery and then got away with portraying the Frankenstein monster as Christ at the crucifixion. ""Son of Frankenstein"" is a great view for reasons the makers never intended - it is the film spoofed in ""Young Frankenstein"" right down to Igor and the one-armed policeman and the game of darts. House of Frankenstein and Ghost of Frankenstein are passable sequels, and at this low price I just consider them to be middling quality extras.

What is not great are the double-sided DVDs which - for some unknown reason - Universal keeps putting its classic collections on. They can last, but you have to be both careful with them and lucky that they work OK to begin with. What is also not great is that this set lacks the wonderful 90 minute documentary ""Universal Horror"" that is in the 75th anniversary edition of Frankenstein.

The extras in this set are as follows:
Van Helsing director Stephen Sommers hosts an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at how these original Frankenstein films inspired his film.

""The Frankenstein Files: How Hollywood Made a Monster,"" an original documentary.

""She's Alive!"": Creating the bride of Frankenstein, an original documentary.

Film historians provide insightful commentary to Frankenstein (Rudy Behlmer) and Bride of Frankenstein (Scott MacQueen) on an alternate audio track.

Original theatrical trailers, plus the 1931, 1938, and 1951 reissue trailers for Frankenstein.

Boo!: A short film made from what is left of 1930's ""The Cat Creeps"", which was a sound version of the classic 1927 silent horror film ""The Cat and the Canary"".

1989447,4,B0001CNRLQ,I really enjoyed all this movies; almost as much as when I was a kid watching them on TV as Saturday afternoon matinees. The stand outs are definitely the original Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein. I found the video and audio quality more than acceptable.  The bonus material is almost worth the price of admission... almost.  It amazing how well this films stand the test of time.  I'm very pleased with this purchase.,1222646400,,425,4.794520547945205

I attempted to play this disc in my player but it did not play. I tried another player and still no luck.  I finally put it in my laptop and it  played the House of Frankenstein.  The movies are excellent but the quality of the discs are extermely poor. It appears to be a manufacturing issue. I hope in the future that the quality of these discs are made better.

1989450,4,B0001CNRLQ,"I must be out of my mind.  First, I've decided to review all 5 films at once.  Second, I didn't give the set 5 stars; sacrilege here at amazon.com.  But I'm not unreasonable, so I will rate each film individually just to make things clear.  Don't forget, we have an obligation to let others know if their beloved films are getting treated properly on DVD; just keep that in mind.  I'll first let you know what I thought of the films, and then, just for fun, we'll check the resumes of the various assistants.

-FRANKENSTIEN; PERSPECTIVE (5.5 STARS)
In the modern perspective, this can be a somewhat boring, unintentionally funny film.  However, when I watched it I made a point of pretending I was in a 1932 theater with a bunch of people who have never seen a monster movie.  This would be a mind blowing experience.  Not only is there murder, the idea of dismemberment and playing God, but the source of everyone's fear is actually a sympathetic, mute character.  I know this is not a new idea to you modern readers.  Yet, in the context of its day, this was groundbreaking.  A hand full of ""Horror"" films had been made before, but nothing quite as well put together as this.  If you have doubts, watch 1931's ""Dracula"".  Though considered a classic, it can be snooze inducing when compared to ""Frankenstein"".  This film is actually pretty fast paced with some really cool visuals to drink in.

-ASSISTANT ONE; FRITZ IS THE PITZ
The first Doctor, on-edge Henry F., has suspect taste in assistants; no, not Ygor (that's how it's spelled BTW) but Fritz.  I wonder how things might have gone had Fritz not dropped the ""normal"" brain.  Of course, when viewed with modern sensibilities, the idea of reviving a brain soaking in formaldehyde is pretty ludicrous regardless of its criminal tendencies.  But Fritz isn't done.  It turns out he's a sadistic jerk and destroys whatever modicum of decency the ""monster"" had working.  Nice going Henry.

-BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN; PERSPECTIVE (5.0 STARS)
""Bride"" is a fan favorite of many.  Improbably, it may have been a more groundbreaking film than its predecessor.  ""Bride"" may have been the first ""Horror"" film with comedic intensions.  The comedy it pulls off is still funny today.  Despite this, the story might be more tragic and heart breaking.  As you might know, the bride only shows up long enough to reject her blind date, but it's so ""real"" you always feel bad for the guy.  As you may also have heard; another mad scientist exchanges notes with Henry.  It turns out this guy can make tiny people, yet thinks reviving a cadaver is more exciting; what a putts!  This knocks down bride just a hair below the original.  The ""Monster"" says little but speaks volumes.

-ASSISTANT TWO; KARL, YOU LOOK A LOT LIKE FRITZ!
Of course, they are the same actor.  Well Henry had nothing to do with this guy.  Karl was the hired hunch of Dr. Pretorius (he of the little people).  Once again, we get an assistant with questionable moral fiber and physical ability.  Karl does not like to dig.  As a result, the new Mad Doctor gets only the freshest of parts.  Karl likes to play with fire; something the ""Monster"" does not quite appreciate.  So why are we surprised when he goes berserk again?  Way to go Pretorius.

-SON OF FRANKENSTEIN; PERSPECTIVE (4.5 STARS)
I give this film a lot of credit for at least moving to another level.  No, not the story; but everything else.  The growing budget is evident.  The actors are less melodramatic and refined (mostly), the sets are more convincing and ambitious, and the camera work more sophisticated (if not so inventive).  However, the ""Monster"" is becoming a monster; a barely human automaton.  He shows signs of humanity but for the most part becomes a tool in a furry vest (don't ask me?).  Wolf is Henry's Son (hence the title) and he's moving into Dad's old place.  Not surprising, the town's folk aren't too happy.  Lionel Atwill's ""Inspector Krogh"" nearly steals the show.  In a very unintentionally funny moment, a very stressed-out Wolf shouts to the inspector in a very snappy way ""WOULD YOU LIKE A DRINK... ...OR PERHAPS YOU'D CARE TO PLAY A GAME OF DARTS?""  I laughed very hard.  Anyway, the story really bogged down at times and they seemed to rush the finish (what, in one of these films?).  Still, this film had enough going on to be included in ""Young Frankenstein"".

-ASSISTANT THREE; GOOD LOOKS ONLY GET YOU SO FAR!
Finally we get YGOR!!  Bella Lugosi does a good job of bringing personality to this role.  The problem is his personality is that of a conniving, self serving murderer.  He actually gets the job because he's buddies with the ""Monster"".  I normally don't go for nepotism, but hey, he has the requisite disfigurements so sign him up!  I'll give Wolf a break; Ygor and the ""Monster"" are a package deal.  Amazingly, it's Wolf who pushes things over the edge in this one.

-THE GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN; PERSPECTIVE (3.5 STARS)
Still good acting, music and sets but the story is getting nonsensical.  While trying to maintain the historical legacy of the prior films, much is dispensed with or forgotten.  You learn all too quickly that budget does not beget quality.  Ygor is clearly the Boss again and wastes little time moving his agenda.  He finds a reluctant but vulnerable Ludwig F., brother to Wolf.  Boris Karloff opts out of the makeup and is replaced by Wolf Man Lon Chaney Jr.  LC Jr. was always an, at best, middling actor.  No surprise then that the guy we all came to see is a dud.  In the end it is Lugosi who gets all the lines while LC gets to go ""UUUUUUUUHH!""  The ending is especially silly when you watch the final film.  Despite its problems, Ghost is still entertaining on a less cerebral level.

-ASSISTANT FOUR; I'M BACK!!! EH HEH HEH!!!
Yea, it's Lugosi's Ygor again.  Money talks and these films kept making it.  So back come Lugosi's Ygor.  He actually does a good job despite the dumb script.  Anyway, he's the same guy as in the last film.  Ironically, it's the assistant that's conscripting the services of the master now.  Ludwig get's a big slap-down for actually believing anything Ygor says.  Ygor continues the fine tradition of mucking up the best of intensions.

-HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN; MAKING ""VANHELSING"" LOOK COHERANT (2.5 STARS)
You'd think a film with the triumvirate of Euro-monsters would be awesome.  What we get here is possibly the most incoherent mess I've seen since ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" (which has obvious entertainment value).  This film is basically divided down the middle.  The first half might be the worst Dracula film ever and the second half might be the most inexplicable waste of film imaginable.  Fortunately the acting and the sets were worth a peak anyway.  We learn again that the budget should be spent on developing a good story first.  Apparently tired of making money; Universal appeared bent on the destruction of the ""Frankenstein"", Wolf Man"" and ""Dracula"" franchises in one fell swoop.  It nearly worked.  We do get to see them again in the fluffy, yet wildly entertaining Abbott and Costello flick; hardly an extension of the franchise.

ASSISTANT FIVE; I AM NOW THE MASTER...
Karloff returns as a guy who assisted Frankenstein (I'm not sure which one) and wants to continue the franchise.  He has an assistant who is physically disfigured (surprise) and very strong but actually a nice guy (sound familiar? ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"").  Not surprisingly, the assistant's assistant starts all the trouble again.  I don't blame him this time; His boss welched on the deal.

-THE DVD (3.5 STARS)
Unlike other reviews here, I had no troubles with the disk getting scratched.  In fact, I have trouble removing it from the case.  Though the pictures are in beautiful shape, I don't think it was packaged in the most honorable way.  Putting 3 films on one disk is just cheap.  Still, this is a worthy collection for those who like taking a leisurely trip back in time.  For those who need gory, non-stop action and violence; I would pass.",1217894400,,8014,4.728654124457308
1989451,5,B0001CNRLQ,"""FRANKENSTEIN"" is, without a doubt, the finest monster film Universal Studios ever produced.  James Whale's unexpected masterpiece gave us art and pathos where one was only expecting a good scream.  The frantic Collin Clive, furiously flailing just beyond the gray borders of sanity, contrasted with the child-like innocence of his spurned creation, moved me beyond reason at the tender age of nine.  Twenty years later, I still feel the same way when viewing this film.  Karloff's characterization, through grunts, hand gestures, and facial expressions, conveys more humanity than virtually any other character that has ever graced the silver screen.  While a severe departure from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mary-Shelley-s-novel/dp/0451527712/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mary Shelley's novel</a>, this film achieves its own status as legendary art, leaving itself etched upon our cultural consciousness for all time to come.

""BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN,"" while an amazing film in its own right, tends to get oversold, in my opinion.  James Whale, frustrated that the movie-going public had taken his first film on such a surface level, attempted to re-emphasize the points he made the first time around, externalizing Dr. Frankenstein's conflict by introducing a second mad scientist to embody his obsession, exaggerating the monster's personality and innocence by giving him speech and allowing him to state these sentiments directly, and by providing blatant verbal ruminations about the issues raised in this film - issues of life and death, gods and monsters, loneliness and friendship, and even rage and thoughts of suicide.  All of this wonderfully potent content was there in the first film, but Whale yells louder in ""Bride,"" hoping someone will actually hear him this time.  Even the highly memorable scene with the blind man in the hut is really just an echo of the dramatic ramifications of the monster's encounter with the young girl by the river in the first film.  Brief moments of pleasure and happiness are inevitably destroyed by cruel fate.  While ""Bride"" is still a superb film, especially with stronger, more brilliantly expressive shots than the first one and richer, more terrifying production value (especially towards the end, when the Bride is finally brought to life), I think it's a mistake to call this film superior to the original.  When you look closely, it does little to actually raise the stakes or take the franchise to a new level.

""SON OF FRANKENSTEIN"" was clearly the recipient of a surprising amount of effort on the part of the studio, but that effort didn't get it very far.  In addition to the legendary Boris Karloff, Universal brought screen legend Basal Rathbone and Universal's own legend, Bela Lugosi (Dracula) to the project.  Additionally, the director seemed to have a clear artistic vision for the film, utilizing a mixture of Modernism and Expressionism in his sets, lighting, and over-all shot composition, apparently attempting to depict the three disconnected worlds of the new Baron Frankenstein (modern, scientific, detached), the villagers (medieval, worn, cramped), and the old Laboratory (chaotic, asymmetrical, unnatural).  Unfortunately, the script fails to deliver, giving us characters with fantastically intriguing potential, but ultimately no internal conflict nor character development.  Nothing is ever truly at stake in this film beyond the lives of a few villagers and the freedom of Dr. Frankenstein.  Whereas the first two Frankenstein films were intense character studies (one could even argue that, like the Incredible Hulk, Dr. Frankenstein and the monster represented conflicting aspects of the same person), there is absolutely no depth of character to be found in this film.  Even Karloff, who gets thrown a bone with two short, emotional scenes that are almost entirely irrelevant to the plot, does not get to act until almost an hour into the film, and spends most of the remaining time as a thoughtless henchman serving another villain.  Karloff, in his final appearance as the Frankenstein monster, is relegated to supporting cast in a franchise that should have been centered entirely upon his character.  This is a decent film for a lazy Sunday viewing, but I would hesitate to call it memorable or even a worthwhile inclusion in this franchise.  Side note: Mel Brooks' ""Young Frankenstein"" is based almost entirely upon this installment in the Frankenstein series.

""GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN"" is, undoubtedly, the weakest installment in the Frankenstein series.  By this point, the premise has completely lost its way, borrowing heavily from the previous film and practically ignoring the heavy themes, astonishing artistic value and, above all else, humanity contained in the first two films.  In this uninspired tale, the Frankenstein monster, still befriended by Ygor (from the last film) has become far more casual about killing and terrorizing than in previous installments.  Whereas the creature once sought understanding and only met violence with violence, he now kills whenever someone puts a hand on his shoulder or happens to be in his way.  Perhaps this is a logical progression after so many disastrous encounters with people over the years, but director Eric Kenton fails to lend any sense of tragedy to this fact, treating the monster as a cold, viscous killer whose only redemptive quality is that he befriends children.  Gone is any sense of the overwhelmingly earthy protagonist from the first two films.  He truly has become little more than a monster.  Perhaps I could have forgiven the film if that had been all the damage it dealt to such a beloved character, but it goes much further.  By the end of the film (no spoilers here), the Frankenstein monster has been utterly ruined beyond salvation, surgically changed into a far more generic, dramatically void antagonist that was never going to earn another sequel.  An otherwise brilliant franchise was stopped dead by one truly tasteless installment.

""HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN,"" the final film in this collection, is a surprisingly excellent installment.  Boris Karloff is brilliant as the mad scientist, J Carrol Naish plays a stunningly sympathetic hunchback, and the writing and directing are both truly memorable.  The problem is that this isn't a Frankenstein film.  It's not even the team-up film it claims to be.  A terribly executed Dracula appears in the first 30 minutes of the film (which are entirely irrelevant to the rest of the story), and the Frankenstein monster is literally animated in the last ninety seconds of the film.  Beyond that, this is clearly a Wolf Man movie, continuing directly from the ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman"" film featured in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wolfman-Legacy-Collection/dp/B0001CNRNE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wolfman Legacy Collection</a>.  It spends most of the film focused on Larry Talbot (The Wolfman) and does a tremendous amount to build upon and enrich his story in amazing ways, but it does not do the same for Dracula or the monster, both of whom seem tacked on without any artistic considerations, included merely for advertising purposes.  It's saddening to consider how Karloff must have felt watching his legacy tarnish before his very eyes.  That consideration aside, this is a very solid Wolfman film, but I absolutely wouldn't even bother with it unless you're a fan of Larry Talbot and have already seen ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman.""

It's hard to deny that this is one heck of a collection, if only because it contains both the original ""Frankenstein"" and ""Bride of Frankenstein"" in one inexpensive volume, but I'd hesitate to view the addition of the other films as much of a bonus.  Granted, there are those of us who recall these films with fond childhood nostalgia, but, if you're not already familiar with the three remaining films, then I wouldn't expect to be too impressed with them.  Buy this collection in order to own two of the greatest horror stories ever shown on the big screen.

Very frustrating and disappointing. Apparently others have had the same problem with this collection. The manufacturer is obviously not reliable.

1989454,5,B0001CNRLQ,"This is my second retro-review in as many days. This time it is the companion set to the Mummy franchise,Universals'Legacy Collection of the original ""Frankenstein"" franchise. I have decided from time to time to go back into my collection and pick out titles that I have never touched and do a retro-review on them like this one.
This set is one of my more prized ones. Five movies are here starting with the absolute horror classic that spawned and inspired countless such films that came after it,the original 1931 ""Frankenstein"" starring the inimitable Boris Karloff. Karloff had been in the business for some years as a minor player in silent and early sound films. But it was this role that was to change his career and life forever and make him a household name almost overnight. I recall my mothers' recollections of this film on seeing it on its' debut run as a young girl. She always remembered the scene with the little girl being thrown into the water and that the entire picture scared the begeesus out of her. It still has the ability to scare and terrify even today.
Everybody is familiar with the plots of at least the first two films,""Frankenstein"" and ""The Bride of Frankenstein""(1935).They involve the doings of one Dr. Frankenstein(the monster had no name and was never called Frankenstein) who becomes obsessed with reanimating dead tissue. This leads him,with his assistant Ygor,to try his theories on human bodies;the fresher the better. When finally the good doctor brings to life his experiment the monster he has created becomes hard to handle. It is basically trying to get a grasp on his unusual situation but is being pulled in many directions at once. He escapes and has a few encounters with outsiders but his actions are totally misconstrued. He ends up being hunted down and eventually ""perishes"" inside Frankensteins' castle.
""The Bride of Frankenstein"" stars Karloff again and this time the doctor wants to right the wrongs he made the first time. The monster has come a long way from his original animation and eventually persuades the doctor that he needs a companion. The doctor reluctantly obliges realizing though that another one is going to double his woes if not handled just right. He re-animates from body parts a woman for the original monsters' desires. The minute she awakes however it is the doctor she clings to and is abhorred at the sight of her expectant mate. Frankenstein again goes crazy which only ends with his ""demise"".
Part of the reason these two films are veritable classics is that they reek with atmosphere. As I stated in my recent Mummy review Universal was without peer when it came to creating the right sets and lighting to generate the proper look that it wanted. And the work they did in these films are benchmarks and without question still stand the test of time.
The next film in the series is ""Son of Frankenstein""(1939).Basil Rathbone stars as the the deceased doctors' son who 25 years later comes back to his fathers' home. There is no warm reception for the young man who also happens to be a doctor. Wandering through the castle ruins one day he finds Ygor,played by Bela Lugosi. Ygor introduces the son to the monster(Karloff) who is still alive. Ygor wants the doctor to help him which he does but both are at cross purposes. The doctor thinks maybe he can somehow regain control of it while Ygor is suspicious of his plans and has other nefarious ideas of his own for the monster. Ygor eventually gets the monster on a killing spree which arouses the local townsfolk again. The hunt is on but not before the doctors' own son is kidnapped by the monster. It's touch and go but the monster is eventually pushed into the sulphur pit below the castle ruins. The doctor in disgrace ups and leaves the town for good. Karloff again plays the monster with some degree of feeling and sensitivity,things that would be lacking in the next two films.
""The Ghost of Frankenstein"" finds Ygor still inhabiting the ruins of the castle. The townsfolk also get wind of this fact and decide to blow the place up once and for all. One explosion goes off and Ygor stumbles across the monster(Lon Chaney).Both escape and look back as the castle is totally blown away. They seek out the other son of the late doctor,Ludwig Frankenstein(Sir Cedric Hardwicke),who with the help of a receptive colleague has also been experimenting in the reanimation of dead tissue,but not to the extent of his late father. The monster and Ygor boldly walk through the village and when the monster helps a little girl retrieve her ball from a rooftop,the townspeople misinterpret the gesture and he is captured by the local constabulary and thrown in jail. Ygor goes to Ludwig and tells him the situation. Ygor retrieves the monster and when both show up Ludwig gases both of them. Ludwig wants to take the monster apart piece by piece but changes his mind when the ghost of his father shows up to persuade him otherwise. Instead Ludwig decides to transplant the brain of a more normal person into the monsters' head. However his assistant double crosses him and switches the good brain for Ygors'.The monster awakes but shortly learns the implant will not take as Ygors' blood type was not compatible with the monsters'.He goes on a suicidal rampage destroying the lab and house with himself in it.
""The House Of Frankenstein""(1944) involves the story of a disgraced and jailed Dr. Nieman(Karloff) who has obviously studied Dr. Frankensteins' lamentable methodology with a friend who bears a remarkable resemblance to Ygor. They escape and run into a wandering showman called Lampini. It seems Lampini has the skeleton of Count Dracula. Nieman kills Lampini and takes his identity. He raises Count Dracula(played by John Carradine)back to the living to do his bidding and take revenge on those that imprisoned him. But Dracula can't be restrained and he goes on a silent killing spree throughout the area. Nieman/Lampini with his friend and Dracula in tow try to outrun the town posse but Dracula is killed in the chase. The two escapees come to the ruins of Frankensteins' castle where they find the Wolfman(Lon Chaney) and the monster(Glenn Strange) encased in ice. Nieman tells the Wolfman that he will operate on him to relieve him of his affliction but in due course The Wolfman finds out that Nieman seems much more interested in the monster than in him. This leads to conflict between them and the Wolfman changes and starts to kill. He ends up being shot and killed and Nieman and the monster are pursued by an angry mob. Nieman is injured and the monster helps him to make their getaway but he takes him in the wrong direction and both disappear into a pit of quicksand.
To supplement this amazing collection(the best of the Legacy series) are some very fine additions. All theatrical trailers are here along with the 1931,1938 and 1951 re-issue trailers.""Boo"" a cute but odd short film is here along with poster galleries for the first two movies,""She's Alive"" a documentary about ""The Bride of Frankenstein"",another documentary called ""The Frankenstein Files:How Hollywood made a monster"" and finally a take on the making of the Frankenstein films by the director of ""Van Helsing"",Stephen Sommers.
By all standards this release gets top marks all the way. The films have been wonderfully remastered and restored and are very clean and crisp. I highly recommend this set to everyone but as an ESSENTIAL to the collection of anyone who has even the slightest interest in the horror genre of motion pictures. The first two films here are absolute essentials and both still quicken the pulse and startle even a jaded fan like myself after all these years. This release has been around for about four years now. May I suggest if you haven't already that you get yours today before it is gone forever.",1204761600,,7847,4.830609212481426
1989464,5,B0001CNRLQ,"I couldn't possibly add to the well thought out and informed material that has already been sent in by prior writers. However, this is the film that started an avalanche of what we now refer to as classic horror. We all owe a debt of thanks to Universal for their pioneering and profitable efforts which many studios copied but almost none were able to duplicate. Universal developed film stories with more substance, haunting music, fantastic sets and the wonderful makeup of Jack Pierce.  We also must never forget the acting magic of Boris Karloff.

Classic horror fans agree that Karloff's superb face, intended emotions and acting skills were visible through the pounds of makeup. The fact that Karloff could clearly convey his expressions like no other under these conditions is a tribute to his skills.  Numerous other actors have tried and fallen short of his performance. My small personal circle of learned classic horror movie fans actually have a saying which is ""Karloff's face was half of the makeup"".

I will just state that the DVD transfer was excellent and note that I loved the film on my large format TV.  Sadly, I don't have the memory of seeing this film on an actual full scale theater screen to compare it to, although I have come close when watching an excellent 16 mm copy in a privately owned theater. It was an amazing experience.

Memories of the grand opening of this film in New York were described by my mother (who most definitely was not a fan) who noted that nothing had ever been seen like Universal's Frankenstein on the screen before. A nurse was on call for each showing because of the numerous patrons who passed out and an ambulance and hearse were located outside the theater to add to the mood and to promote effective publicity.",1202774400,,1772,4.737012987012987

1989466,4,B0001CNRLQ,"To reiterate some of the previous posts: yes, my discs arrived loose in the case as well. But I must agree with the person who stated that it's not the discs being scratched that's causing the glitches on Disc 2, it's the discs themselves. My discs were not visibly scratched, so the manufacturer dropped the ball. Mine glitched during ""Son of Frankenstein"" but given the slow uneven pace of the film itself it was no loss. ""Ghost of Frank"" and ""House of Frank"" played fine. ""House of Frankenstein"" was a pleasant surprise, although the Monster in this one came perilously close to resembling Herman Munster. Apart from that, and the goofy animated bat effect, a good solid film of its kind. The transformation of the skeleton into Dracula was particularly effective. And you can't beat the traveling sideshow motif.
""Ghost of Frankenstein"" was essentially a short. ""Son of ..."" had the aforementioned pacing issues, but contained some interesting special effects and good atmosphere. The first two are, of course, the best, but I had forgotten how goofy the homunculi were in ""Bride"" (except for the ballet dancer). And the tedious and unfunny maid just DOMINATES the film.

I have the Dracula and Wolfman legacy collections in addition to the Frankensein legacy Of all the films in this latter collection, The Bride of Frankenstein is the film that stands out and still sends chills down my spine. Certain scenes, like the monster's first appearance in the dark murky lake under the burning mill, The Brides' creation when her eyes are shown open when the bandages are removed from them and of course, the infamous chilling closeup of Elsa Lanchester as the Bride, hissing at the heartbroken monster before he destroys the lab. And the Franx Waxman score for ""BOF"", like the movie, is chilling as well. Another scene, a lighter, touchier moment were the scenes with the monster and the blind hermit. Very touching. I would recommend any fan of the Universal's golden age of horror these classic collections. I somewhat enjoyed Son Of Frankenstein, but never had seen Ghost of Frankenstein before until I purchased this box set. House of Frankensein was also a great movie as well.

1989468,4,B0001CNRLQ,"I just wanted to say that I think ""House of Frankenstein"" is also very good.  Sure, Karloff is the creater/caretaker this time and not the monster, but I liked the idea of all three monsters together (+Dracula (Carradine) and Wolfman (Chaney)).  ""Son..."" is a little goofy, but I think ""House..."" stands right there with the original and ""Bride..."".  Enjoy!",1191196800,,357,5.016949152542373
1989469,5,B0001CNRLQ,"On the heels of the great success of Todd Browning's Dracula, star Bela Lugosi was offered the role of Frankenstein's Monster in the screen adaptation of Mary Shelley's infamous novel. Lugosi turned the role down, and Boris Karloff took it. The rest is history. Karloff created one of the most memorable screen monsters of all time, and inspired a million nightmares.

Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive in an inspired performance) along with his assistant Fritz (Dwight Frye: Dracula's Renfield) digs up corpses and assembles them into a gangling creature, which is then brought to life in the lab. Everyone remembers the famous line: ""It's alive. It's alive!... IT'S ALIVE!""

The monster, of course, gets free and terrorizes the village. The monster causes mayhem, and the good Dr. is chastened for playing god. Those are the bare bones of the story. But underneath is something much greater.

Karloff manages to bring a human quality to the monster. He imbues it with innocence, a child-like nature that makes the tale nearly heartbreaking. Yes, the monster kills. But it doesn't want to. In the most famous scene Karloff drowns a little girl by throwing her into a lake. It is not his aim to murder the child. She was teaching him to throw pretty flowers into the water, and watch as they float. He tries to emulate her action with another pretty object ( the little girl). It goes horribly wrong, and we can see the Monster's despair at his mistake.

The point of Frankenstein is empathy. Anyone who cannot summon at least a little empathy (and sympathy) for the creature is inhumane.

The film has an eerie texture, and is perfect in nearly every shot. Director James Whale (who would also helm Bride of Frankenstein found the perfect tone for the film. The performances by Karloff, Clive, Frye, and Mae Clark (as Frankenstein's fiance) are superb.

The lack of soundtrack music seems odd to modern ears. Yet, it was standard at the time for movies to only have music over the credits, and not in the main body of the work.

This film is beautiful, and creepy. It will remain a classic forever. It was followed by several sequels. They Are:

Bride of Frankenstein (1935)
Son of Frankenstein (1939)
Ghost of Frankenstein, The (1942)
Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man (1943)
House of Frankenstein (1944)
House of Dracula (1945)
Bud Abbott Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948)

There have also been many re-makes (or re-imaginings) of Frankenstein. Among them:

Flesh for Frankenstein
Frankenstein Unbound
Frankenhooker
Frankenweenie
Young Frankenstein
Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

And many more.

1989473,5,B0001CNRLQ,"Fans of the original Frankenstein monster are in for a real treat here as this low-priced collection of no less than 5 movies featuring the monster that everyone loves has had both the picture and sound quality restored admirably well given the undoubtedly poor condition of the old deteriorated master tapes.

To me, ""Frankenstein"" is the best of the lot for so many reasons including the great direction of James Whale and the excellent acting of Colin Clive and especially of Boris Karloff.  Karloff's work in making an audience feel so much pity for what was supposed to be a monster has only been bettered by Merian C. Cooper making us feel sorry for essentially a mechanical puppet in King Kong.  The movie with its brilliant acting and strong moral theme of the repercussions whenever man decides to play God make this a movie to transcend the years and rightfully stake its claim as one of the best movies ever made.

I know a lot of people like ""Bride of Frankenstein"" better but to me, ""Frankenstein"" is still the better movie overall.  It's interesting to note that James Whale wasn't in favour of doing this sequel but faced with the prospect of someone else doing it anyway, he decided to take a stab and despite his attempts to spoof the original movie with comic relief in the form of the old housekeeper for example, the movie is still a very good one with some very touching scenes.  I personally enjoy the heart wrenching scene with the poor old blind man in the wooden cabin which clearly shows that the truly blind are those that cannot look beyond the grotesque appearance of the monster to see his tender side but instead attack and seek to destroy what they don't understand.  I didn't like the Dr. Praetorius character and overall, Colin Clive and the others don't quite pull off as great an acting job as they had done in the first movie.  Still, ""Bride of Frankenstein"" makes a worthy sequel to the classic movie.  Unfortunately, it all starts to go downhill from here and hence provides fodder for countless parodies over the years culminating in perhaps the best parody in Gene Wilder's ""Young Frankenstein"".  From ""Son of Frankenstein"" down to ""House of Frankenstein"" it was clear that everything that made the first two films classics had been lost and it had become a case of milking the franchise for all that they could get.

What's also good about this Legacy Collection is the special features which includes an extremely humorous short film called ""Boo!"" and the insightful documentaries: ""She's Alive!"" and ""The Frankenstein Files"".  In conclusion, this is indeed a great value for money dvd collection and is a must have for students of early cinema and monster lovers as well.

I include The Wolf Man, House of Dracula and Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein in the Frankenstein series because Frankenstein meets the Wolf Man is a sequel to The Wolf Man and Ghost of Frankenstein. House of Dracula is a sequel to House of Frankenstein and Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein is played straight by the monsters and deserves to be the climax to the series. The other reasons for buying this set over the 75th ann. is that you know down the road there will be a HD version which will greatly improve the picture and sound over any of the past editions. I am not moving to HD until the Blue Ray/HD war is over, but I know years from now when all the bugs are  gone, the price comes down and a winner is declared, I'll be ready and waiting. ;-) About the film, if you are not familar with the original Universal Monsters by now, you are missing some of the greatest movies in horror history! Is it to late to appreciate them? You'll have to decide for yourself! Long live B&W!! The first three films are classics and the others are hard to resist.

I had heard people complain about the quality of these dvd's, but I am a huge fan of Bela Lugosi (Son of/Ghost of Frankenstein) as well as all the old Frankenstein movies & Boris Karloff. I couldn't afford to buy the earlier seperate dvd editions, so I bought this.

One of the dvds, due the the CHEAP cardboard packaging had come loose and was horribly scratched! The same thing happend to me with the Dracula Collection. Also, disk 2 in the set is a cheap double sided thing onto which Universal has crammed 3 movies plus extra features - this can often cause skipping and other problems.

I have taken back all 3 of the Legacy collectins that I bought.

AND I also had to return The Bela Lugosi Collection because it froze and skipped!

MY experiance with the NEW Universal horror releases has been so bad that I won't buy any of them anymore.

If you decide to take a chance on these dvds, be SURE you will be able to return them and get your money back.

Note: I have the original DVD release of Dracula. It is great.

You might consider these editions instead? It might be worth it.

I.  Frankenstein (1931): The film begins in a cemetary during a funeral procession. Two men are secretly watching from behind a gravestone; they are Dr. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) and his hunchbacked assistant Fritz (Dwight Frye). As soon as everyone leaves, the two quickly dig up the coffin. ""He's not dead, he's just resting, waiting for a new life to come,"" proclaims Henry. On the way back to their laboratory, the two see another body hanging from the gallows. Fritz cuts it down, but Henry examines it and proclaims that the neck is broken. This makes the brain useless. Fritz breaks into Henry's old university, the Ingolstadt Medical College, and steals a brain from one of the classrooms. He accidentally drops it, so he just takes the next one off of the shelf (not realizing that it is an abnormal brain.) Back at Henry's home, his fiance Elizabeth (Mae Clark) and friend Victor Moritz (John Boles) are beginning to worry about him. They haven't seen him for weeks, ever since he left to do his experiments. They decide to go to Ingolstadt and meet with his old professor Dr. Waldman (Edward Van Sloan.) Waldman informs them that Henry left the university to conduct research on bringing the dead back to life. The two then ask Waldman to accompany them to Henry's lab and he agrees. That night, a terrible lightning storm breaks out. The three get to Henry's lab, where he reveals that he has made a man by stiching together corpses. With the electricity from he lightning, he will give him life. Once the smoke and light clears from the electricity, the man's hand suddenly begins to move. ""It's alive! IT'S ALIVE!,"" cries Henry with excitement. What he doesn't realize is that he's created a monster.

II. The Bride Of Frankenstein (1935): Following the windmill fire from the previous film, Henry (Colin Clive) is brought back to his mansion. Upon getting there he is examined and it turns out that he has survived the fall. The Monster (Boris Karloff), however, also survived the fire. He didn't burn, he fell into a cave below the windmill. A few days later, Henry (now Baron Frankenstein) is visited by an old professor of his named Dr. Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger.) Pretorius brings Henry back to his lab and shows him that he too has created life. He has been able to ""grow"" miniaturized people. Unfortunately he can't make them life-sized. He suggests that he and Henry should combine their methods to make another being. Henry doesn't want to make another man since his Monster caused so much trouble. Pretorius reveals that he wants to make a woman. ""That would be really interesting, "" he proclaims.

III. Son Of Frankenstein (1939): Decades after the previous film, Henry's son Dr. Wolf von Frankenstein (Basil Rathbone) is returning to he town he grew up in. The old town has been renamed Frankenstein. He arrives with his wife and son, but the local villagers aren't too happy to see them. They are still bitter about his father's experiments and the monster he created. Wolf soon discovers that a hunchbacked shepherd named Ygor (Bela Lugosi) is living in the ruins of his father's old laboratory. Ygor has been taking care of the monster (Boris Karloff), who has been in a coma for years. Wolf decides to make the Monster well again and by doing so he could heal the wounds of the town and make his father be remembered as a maker of men rather than a maker of monsters. What he doesn't realize is that Ygor already has plans of his own.

IV. The Ghost Of Frankenstein (1942):  Not too long after the last film, the villagers (afraid of the Monster ever returning again) decide to blow up the remains of the old Frankenstein laboratory. Ygor (Bela Lugosi) still lives in the old ruins. An explosion caused by the villagers' dynamite frees the Monster (now played by Lon Chaney Jr.) from the sulfur pit and Ygor pulls him out. The Monster is very sick and isn't what he used to be, so Ygor decides to bring him to Henry Frankenstein's other son, Dr. Ludwig von Frankenstein (Sir Cedric Hardwicke). Ludwig is a brilliant brain surgeon. Upon entering the town, the monster causes a bit of trouble and ends up killing two villagers. He also kills Ludwig's assistant Dr. Kettering (Barton Yarborough). At first Ludwig wishes to dissect the Monster and rid the world of him forever. Then he is visited by a vision of his father. His father tells him that the monster is evil because his assistant accidentally put an abnormal brain in his skull. Putting a good brain in his skull would solve the problem and clear up the Frankenstein name. Ludwig decides to put Kettering's brain in the Monster, but what he doesn't realize is that Ygor secretly plans to put his own brain in the Monster.

V. House Of Frankenstein (1944): The film begins at a prison for the criminally insane. Two of the inmates there are Dr. Gustav Niemann (Boris Karloff) and a hunchback named Daniel (J. Carrol Naish). Niemann is a dedicated follower of Frankenstein's research. A bolt of lightning hits the prison wall and the two are able to escape. They hitch a ride on a coach owned by Professor Bruno Lampini (George Zucco). Lampini owns a traveling Chamber of Horrors which includes the real skeleton of Count Dracula. Niemann decides to kill Lampini and pose as him for cover. Niemann and Daniel continue to tour the Chamber of Horrors, just so no one gets suspicious. Niemann frees the stake from the skeleton's heart and it transforms back into a living Count Dracula (John Carradine.) He forces Dracula to be his servant, otherwise he will put the stake back in his heart. Niemann's next plans are to go to the town of Frankenstein and find the Monster (now played by Glenn Strange), who is frozen in ice with the Wolf Man (Lon Chaney Jr.) They have been there ever since their battle in ""Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man."" Afterwards, Niemann plans to revive the Monster and continue where Frankenstein left off.

COMMENTS:  What can I say? This has got to be one of the most influential horror films of all time. James Whale's Frankenstein is a terrible adaptation of Mary Shelley's classic 1818 novel, and yet it is probably the greatest film version ever made. Boris Karloff's makeup and portrayal of the Monster will be burned into your mind forever. Originally Bela Lugosi (Dracula himself) was slated to play the Monster, but after a makeup test, he decided that he was too handsome to play such a horrific creature. He also didn't like the idea of playing a silent character (ironically he later played the Monster in ""Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man""). Thankfully, director James Whale spotted Boris Karloff in a Universal Studios cafeteria and thought that he had the most amazing features. Karloff had no problem with playing a silent part. He had been in over 70 silent films before ""talkies"" came out. Talkies made him nervous because he had a lisp that everyone could now hear on film. The makeup was designed by both James Whale and Universal's chief makeup artist Jack Pierce. Pierce researched cadavers and such for months before he executed the job. The makeup ultimately became the most famous character makeup in cinematic history. Karloff was forever typecast as the Monster, but he didn't care. He felt that being typecast meant that you were successful. He always looked to the Monster as his very best friend. Karloff and James Whale returned for the sequel ""The Bride Of Frankenstein"". Some people feel that the sequel surpasses the original. Karloff played the monster for the last time in ""Son Of Frankenstein."" Afterwards he felt that the studio was making the films too commercial and that they were ruining the character. He donned the makeup only two more times: at a New York Mets game in 1939 and on an episode of the show ""Route 66"" in 1962. Every single Universal Pictures' Frankenstein film is on this set, with the exception of ""Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man"" (1943) (included on the Wolf Man legacy collection), ""House Of Dracula"" (1945) (included on the Dracula legacy collection), and ""Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"" (1948) (included on The Best of Abbott & Costello Volume 3). This collection is a must have for any horror fan, and the first film is a must see for anyone. The collection also contains documentaries on the making of the films, theatrical trailers, commentary by film historians Rudy Behlmer and Scott MacQueen, poster and photo galleries, and a discussion by ""Van Helsing"" (2004) director Stephen Sommers on the influence of the Frankenstein Monster in today's cinema.",1129334400,3,8550,4.80693405846363
1989497,2,B0001CNRLQ,"These pictures sure aren't scary.  They can't be compared to modern horror flicks.  So what does that leave you with?  The original Frankenstein would have to be called a drama, and Bride of Frankenstein would be a comedy.  Neither is that absorbing anymore.  At least not for me.  I know there are many people who love Bride of Frankenstein but it just didn't do much for me.

I found both of these movies to be about as interesting as cold home fries.  Put some ketchup on them and they can be okay, more or less.

Each film ends with an apparent death of the monster, but each one leaves the possibility open that the monster didn't die, because his dead body isn't shown.  Obviously he's just fine at the end.

In Bride of Frankenstein, the bride makes her appearance very late in the film, and for only a brief time.  I think more could have been done with the character.  She would have made an interesting co-star in a 60s sitcom.",1128729600,,937,4.409356725146199
1989498,4,B0001CNRLQ,"***** for BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, **** for the 1931 original, and *** for the other three films.  Think of real Halloween season movie monsters-not Jason or Freddy Kreuger-and you probably think of Dracula and the Frankenstein monster right away.  Something wonderful happened for movie scholars that I don't think was supposed to happen.  On the occasion of Stephen Sommers' VAN HELSING (2001), Universal Home Video brought out no less than four labor of love DVD's, each one devoted to films with a single monster.  So on one DVD disk we get archive prints of FRANKENSTEIN (1931), BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1935), SON OF FRANKENSTEIN (1939), GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN (1942), and  HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1944).  Other boxed sets give us Dracula, The Invisible Man, and The Mummy.  A film scholar can do a whole family tree here!

The irony is that VAN HELSING, which I have not seen, is supposed to be a bomb, or at least a labor of love bomb with great production design.  One of the bonuses on the Frankenstein family DVD, in fact, has Sommers chatting about Mary Shelley writing the novel and how his movie relates to the five here.  His is obviously in color and looks very gory.  Anyway, we have Stephen Sommers to thank for this magnificent four volume horror movie jamboree from Universal.

The best of the FRANKENSTEIN volume film quintet, of course, is James Whale's incomparable BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, which features a glistering new print and audio commentary by film expert Scott MacQueen.  We also get a documentary called ""She's Alive"" about the making of this masterpiece.  Whale also did the first and third movies, in 1931 with Karloff and Colin Clive; and elaborately in 1939 with Basil Rathbone as Baron Frankenstein, Karloff as the Monster, Bela Lugosi as a crippled gypsy named Igor, and Lionel Atwill as the local Constable.  Fans of Mel Brooks' hilarious YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN (1974) will find their film source heavily in SON and BRIDE.  FRANKENSTEIN and BRIDE have original poster and publicity art, as well as theatrical trailers; and the 1931 original has an audio commentary by the renowned Rudy Behlmer.  People may be disappointed by how slow-going it is without a music score.

I am not that familiar with GHOST and HOUSE here.  I am trying to remember them from last year.  Leonard Maltin's must-own CLASSIC MOVIE GUIDE says GHOST has Igor (Lugosi) trying to have Dr. Frankenstein (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) do a brain transplant.  And Maltin says HOUSE is elaborate and episodic-evil scientist Karloff and likeable hunchback J. Carrol Naish form a traveling circus with the original Dracula (John Carradine) in a coffin.  These two films are watchable and enjoyable 70 minute ""B"" programmer sequels to sequels, especially enjoyable at Halloween season.  And it is a two month season for me, stretching all the way to Thanksgiving.

Have a grand time with Karloff, Lugosi, and company in FRANKENSTEIN: THE LEGACY COLLECTION on DVD.  In fact, buy it so that you have it handy each Halloween.  Same with the wonderful DRACULA: THE LEGACY COLLECTION. These are gorgeous, authorized vault prints that sell for about $25 for five full movies.

On the other hand, as others have complained before me, the reality of the packaging is that the disks break from their cheap clear plastic holding tabs, get scratched, and become unplayable.  I've had to return two copies of the FRANKENSTEIN and three of DRACULA before I found acceptable copies.

The films themselves are fine and look great, but when the disk freezes or simply refuses to play a film, we're talking significant problems.

I also cringe at the advertising aspect of these films (does the director of Van Helsing have anything to tell us about FRANKENSTEIN?  Does he even belong on the same disk as horror film historian, David Skal.  Nope on both counts.

To my mind, these films should be repackaged and customers offered a free upgrade.  This is inexcusable hack packaging from a major studio's whose past work has been stellar.",1125100800,7,952,4.869565217391305

1989503,5,B0001CNRLQ,"This two DVD set, part of Universal's ""The Legacy Collection"" is a worthy tribute to the studio's most renowned horror creation. The set includes the first three films in the series-Frankenstein (1931), Bride of Frankenstein (1935), and Son of Frankenstein (1939)-along with two later installments, The Ghost of Frankenstein (1942) and The House of Frankenstein (1944). Intransigent monster fans, however, will have to invest in the Wolfman and Dracula sets in order to fill in the gaps represented by Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman (1943) and The House of Dracula (1945). Sadly, the films also document the monster's decline and fall as a credible screen character, paralleling the studio's own vicissitudes after it passed out of the hands of the Laemmle family in the mid-1930s.

The series commences with two unforgettable pictures. Frankenstein is quite dramatically uneven with some distractingly unconvincing supporting performances that range from insipid (Mae Clarke, John Boles) to overblown (Frederick Kerr). But Boris Karloff's sui generis rendition of the monster is aptly complemented by Colin Clive's overwrought Henry, a mad scientist on the verge of a nervous breakdown, while Dwight Frye's Fritz, who has a more than passing similarity to Lon Chaney's Quasimodo, might have walked straight out of the pages of a gothic novel. The movie establishes a strong atmosphere of horror from the opening somber images of a funeral being spied on by Henry and Fritz, an atmosphere that grows with the creation scene, and reaches an almost unbearable intensity with the killing of Maria and the burning of the monster by a mob.

For many fans, myself included, the cycle reaches its apogee in Bride of Frankenstein. In spite of James Whale's misgivings, he agreed to do this first sequel, based on an episode in the novel in which Victor Frankenstein agrees to create a mate for the monster. Using a largely British cast, augmented by Una O'Connor from the Abbey Theater, Whale put together a diabolical fairy tale that in some respects more resembles Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast than its 1931 predecessor. Although Karloff and Clive are once more memorably on hand, arguably it is Ernest Thesiger as Dr. Pretorius, an improbable amalgam of mad scientist and dandy, who steals the show. Visually the most extraordinary of the series, Bride of Frankenstein owes a great deal of its macabre allure to the collaboration of John Mescall (principal photography), John Fulton (special effects photography), and Charles D. Hall (sets). The first movie was shot by the veteran Arthur Edeson, but Mescall gave a delicate enchantment to the compositions that recalls moments in A Midsummer Night's Dream, photographed in the same year by Hal Mohr. This is a Germany of the imagination straight out of the brothers Grimm that perhaps influenced Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.

The studio still relied on material from the novel in concocting Bride of Frankenstein, but after that point it followed its own inspiration with increasingly disastrous results. Although Son of Frankenstein's titles make an obligatory nod to Mary Shelley, the film owes nothing to her novel and not much to the two previous films-except the hostility of the local populace to anything associated with the cursed name of Frankenstein. Basil Rathbone is less than convincing as the biological offspring of Henry Frankenstein-his mannerisms and pencil moustache furnished Mel Brooks with plenty of material to lampoon in Young Frankenstein-while Karloff, playing his most famous role for the last time, comes across as less than monsterly. However, Bela Lugosi as the monster's soul mate Ygor, and Lionel Atwill as crippled Inspector Krogh sink their teeth all the way into two juicy roles. Crisply directed by Rowland V. Lee and superbly photographed by George Robinson, Son of Frankenstein visually looks back to the days of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and The Golem as well as forward to the low-key lighting and deep focus of Citizen Kane.

The next two titles might be collectively lumped together under the rubric ""The Monster in Extremis."" The only good thing to be said about Lon Chaney Jr.'s performance as the creature in The Ghost of Frankenstein is that he doesn't have any lines to read-only his role as Kharis was an improvement on this one. Atwill and Lugosi once again supply the main interest here, along with some skillful lensing by Milton Krasner and Woody Bredell. House of Frankenstein is an even farther out exercise in desperation. By this point, Universal had arrived at an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink aesthetic, and the movie boasts appearances by Count Dracula (John Carradine), the Wolfman (Lon Chaney Jr.), as well as the monster (a lamentable Glenn Strange). Yet Boris Karloff, playing a deranged savant named Dr. Niemann (""No One""), provides some other than comic relief, and both Lionel Atwill and George Zucco show up in minor roles.

By this point, even Frankenstein's immortal fiend was beginning to change into a comic clich-all that remained was for him to meet Abbot and Costello in 1948. On the other hand, I must admit I enjoyed watching this ineffably silly pair of movies, even if I didn't think much of them-Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man is the exception among the post-Son of Frankenstein sequels. Yet if it takes a stiff dose of Coleridgean ""willing suspension of disbelief"" to put up with the implausible dramatic logic of the later episodes in the Frankenstein saga, all of these films have moments of visual charm. And that charm is quite evident in this indispensable and excellent DVD set. Some slightly erroneous advertising to the contrary, all of these films have been previously available in DVD format; nonetheless, the sound is definitely improved as promised, and even the picture quality seemed better. There is a wealth of supplementary material here, but I particularly recommend the commentaries by Rudy Behlmer and Scott McQueen for Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein, respectively, and the documentaries on the making of those two films.",1110412800,3,6101,5.1898477157360405
1989504,5,B0001CNRLQ,"The first three of the Frankenstein series- ""Frankenstein"", ""The Bride of Frankenstein"" and the ""Son of Frankenstein""- still stand as the most literate and thrilling horror films ever made. Of the first three, I don't think I could single out any one of them for surpassing excellence, as they all are on an incredibly high artistic level. They are all dominated by the touching as well as terrifying performance of Boris Karloff as the Monster. If I have a slight preference for ""Son of Frankenstein,"" it is because of the terrific performances of Bela Lugosi as the demented Ygor (I think his single best role) and the grimly determined, if ultimately conflicted, Dr./Baron Wolf von Frankenstein of Basil Rathbone, whose growing hysteria and sense of guilt even surpasses that of Colin Clive as his father, Henry Frankenstein. The next sequel, ""Ghost of Frankenstein"", shows the Monster deteriorating into a lumbering brute who kills and maims everything and everyone in his path, with Lon Chaney, Jr. failing to win audience sympathy as Karloff could. Still, there is Lugosi's Ygor to redeem the film, along with Sir Cedric Hardwicke as a far more rational Frankenstein than his brother or Father. ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman"" is omitted from this collection; instead, we are treated (?) to ""House of Frankenstein"", a silly, dull film with Karloff as Dr. Niemann, brother to an assistant of Dr. Frankenstein, and Glenn Strange taking over as Monster, a further deterioration into a bumbling henchman. I wish that Universal had restricted this collection to the Karloff series, although ""Ghost"" does have Lugosi's Ygor to bring some interest to the film. Despite the relative and absolute weaknesses of the last 2 films, get this collection for the first three and see why these films have kept their classic status among all movies, not just horror movies.",1109203200,,1863,5.091503267973856
1989505,5,B0001CNRLQ,"James Whale's brilliant 1931 Frankenstein is here given an excellent treatment, with an accompanying documentary and an informative commentary by film historian Rudy Behlmer. Karloff's performance as the Monster, inspiring pathos as well as terror, is unrivalled in the long string of Frankenstein movies throughout the following decades. The film is still genuinely horrifying, even today.

Also in this collection is Bride of Frankenstein, also directed by Whale, but far different in tone. This film is satirical, funny, wildly camp, and yet with a serious undercurrent. This feature also includes a commentary by film historian Scott MacQueen, and a documentary about the film.

Son of Frankenstein is the last of the Universal Frankensteins to have profound artistic merit. Full of fascinating images, influenced largely by German cinematic expressionism, Rowland V Lee's film features Karloff in his third and final appearance as the Monster, Basil Rathbone in the title role and Bela Lugosi as the hunchbacked assistant, Ygor.

Ghost of Frankenstein is probably the weakest of the series, but is entertaining nonetheless. Lon Chaney, Jr, plays the Monster here barely adequately. Still, it's all good fun.

House of Frankenstein brings together all the Universal monsters -- the Frankenstein Monster (now played by Glenn Strange), the Wolf Man (Lon Chaney, Jr), Dracula (John Carradine), a mad scientist (Karloff) and his hunchbacked assistant (J Caroll Naish) -- and it too is good fun, better than its companion piece, House of Dracula (included on the Dracula Legacy DVD).

Nothing here is less than entertaining, and a few in the collection are classics that no film buff should be without.",1108944000,2,1701,5.40377358490566
1989506,5,B0001CNRLQ,"FRANKENSTEIN - Mad scientist creates the Monster, which escapes and wreaks havoc.  Boris Karloff creates an unforgettable creature, and a career, in this classic directed by James Whale.  Still manages a scare or two.

BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN - The Monster demands that his creator make him a mate.  The best Frankenstein story, best horror movie (ever) and a landmark in world cinema.  Everything works in this profound work of gothic horror.

SON OF FRANKENSTEIN - Demented villager cares for the Monster while creator's son moves into father's estate.  Last appearance of Karloff as the monster, SON teams him with Bela Lugosi as the Ygor with the broken neck.  Doesn't have the layered depth Whale brought to the material, but a great gothic horror nonetheless.  Seems to be the movie Mel Brooks borrowed most heavily from for YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN.  After the original and BRIDE OF the Frankenstein franchise take a steep drop in quality.

GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN - Ygor and the Monster find son of Frankenstein and convince him to switch their brains.  Lugosi reprises his role as broken-necked Ygor and Lon Chaney, Jr. takes over as the mute Monster.  Silly plot - transplanting Ygor's brain into the Monster's body indicates that the franchise was running out of gas fast.  A good B-movie, but not much more than that.

HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN - Karloff plays a mad scientist who stumbles across Dracula, the Wolfman and Frankenstein's monster.  Veteran stuntman Glenn Strange plays the Monster in a decidedly minor role.  Another goofy brains-playing-musical-skull plot doesn't get too much in the way of things, and we're given out last opportunity to watch tortured Lawrence Talbot (Lon Chaney, Jr.) gradually transform into the Wolfman.

  I watched these five movies in sequence and was struck at what a great actor Karloff was.  Karloff's Monster was at once more frightening, and more sympathetic, than anyone who preceded or followed him. FRANKENSTEIN and BRIDE OF... both have commentary tracks by two different film historians that are thick with detail and information and a real asset and among the best I've ever heard.

  Beyond the five-movies, the extras make this two disk (three sided) dvd set a great value.  Besides original trailers to most of the movies, The Frankenstein Files and She's Alive!  provide a wealth of information about Universal's Frankenstein - focusing primarily, and rightly, on the first two films directed by James Whale.

  In all, this is a great collection.  Strongly recommended.",1108166400,55,2524,5.145320197044335
1989507,5,B0001CNRLQ,"I really have to give Universal a big thumbs up for their Legacy dvd collections.  Most companies like to rob you blind on dvd gift sets by giving you more dvds in the set while not even filling the disc up to it's capacity.  You know what I mean.  A dvd can hold alot of info and it just pisses me off when you go to buy a tv series and there are only two episodes per disc and 20 discs in the set, thus costing you more.  Universal have finally done it right.  These monster sets each have about 4 or 5 movies on them as well as extras, and on two discs!  And for a very affordable price at that!  Thank you, Universal.  I won't review the Frankenstein films coz I'm sure the folks who will buy them are fans.  It irks me a little that these sets came out as some kind of promotion for that rotten Van Helsing movie.  Why does it always take a rotten film like that to provoke companies to release the good films?  I shouldn't complain, coz at least the sets are out.  The Frankenstein set includes two 35+ minute documentaries-One about the first film and one about Bride.  They're both informative and have interviews with Sarah Karloff, Joe Dante, Clive Barker and a bunch of film historians.  There's a short film called Boo! that acts like an old prototype for Mystery Science Theater 3000.  There are scenes from Nosferatu and Frankenstein with a narrator making funny remarks.  Of course there's the usual trailers and still galleries which are a must for hardcore fans.  The feature I don't like is a 15 + minute featurette with Stephen Sommers and his Van Helsing cast talking about how much the old Universal monster movies influenced them.  That's the first half of the featurette, the second half has Sommers yapping about his stupid Van Helsing movie.  My response is, who cares?  I bought this set to watch these good classic horror films I love, not to watch a hack director promote his overblown crapfest, that quite frankly is more of an insult than an homage.  This is only a small bit however.  You still have five great classic films and two great documentaries.  Well worth the money.",1100390400,9,2107,4.458115183246074

Also, where is Dr. Frankenstein's old cootish baron of a father in BOF? And it is really dumb that the monster in film 2 actually manages to survive the burning windmill climax of the first picture. THat fabulous film one sequence is put into pointlessness in BOF. Other problems abound in the newer film. The actress playing bride Elizabeth in film 2 is different and in no way calls to mind the lady playing her from film one.

1989510,5,B0001CNRLQ,"This review is primarily about Bride of Frankenstein, which is the Best. Movie. Ever.!  For the price of this set, it's worth the money alone just for the original Frankenstein and Bride.  In addition, though, there are some great extras, esp. the making of the bride, which will add to your enjoyment and appreciation of this great movie.

Possible spoilers ahead, but even if you read this review and haven't seen The Bride of Frankenstein, I don't think this could possibly ruin the experience for you!

First of all, I can't believe I lived 42 years without ever having seen Bride or the original Frankenstein.  I watched them both on TMC a couple of months ago, and have watched Bride 4 times since then!  THIS MOVIE HAS IT ALL!  Watch Frankenstein, then Bride, then ""Making of Bride"" on this DVD, then Bride again.  You will be hooked for life!

Bride has humor, camp, scariness, sly social commentary, great music, amazing special effects, and such a heart-wrenching performance by Boris Karloff that he will make you cry.  Finally ... ELSA LANCHESTER!  When I watched this movie the first time, I didn't realize it would end so soon after she appears as the Bride.  I loved the bride, with her twitchy head and hissing!  I wish there was more of her in this movie, but I guess James Whale knew what he was doing when he ended it when he did.  The moment when the monster is holding the bride's hand and he looks so happy then his eyes turn sad as he shakes his head ""no"" while Elsa is rejecting him will just break your heart.  In that split second, Boris conveyed so much in that slight change of the look in his eyes.  Amazing!

Colin Clive is GREAT!  Loved him in the first Frankenstein, love him even more here!  In Bride he is all wigged out and on the edge after creating his monster.  Dr. Praetorius, who basically forces Dr. Frankenstein to make another monster, is just the campiest, maddest scientist you'd ever want to see!  His little people in jars are an amazing special effect, considering this was 1935 when this movie was made!  Some people complain about the little people, but I just enjoy them for the weirdness that they are and the cool special effects for the era!

Another hoot is the opening sequence with Elsa Lanchester playing Mary Shelley.  This ""prologue"" serves as an introduction to the Bride (it's a very brief recap of the original Frankenstein) in case the viewer hasn't seen Frankenstein or, perhaps for 1935's time, because it had been 4 years since viewers last saw Frankenstein.  So for you Elsa fans, you get to see a little bit more of her up front in the movie!  (Elsa rocks in ANYTHING she does!)  And for more campiness, check out the guy playing Lord Byron ... so much makeup and so flamboyant in his speech and mannerisms!  This prologue is another portion of the movie I've read people complain about, but I just love it!

Every second of The Bride of is pure gem.  If you've never seen it, please PLEASE see it!  It really is THAT GREAT!  As is the original Frankenstein.  This collection is AMAZING and at such a great price, I can hardly believe it's for real!",1095379200,5,3118,4.5503597122302155

1989513,5,B0001CNRLQ,"As a tie-in with the theatrical release of Van Helsing, Universal has released sets of its old monster movies.  There is one for Dracula, one for the Wolf Man, and this one, the Frankenstein set.  Included within is Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, Son of Frankenstein, Ghost of Frankenstein and House of Frankenstein, along with various DVD extras like commentaries and documentaries.

Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein are the best in the set (they are actually the only true ""classics"" among all three sets of movies).  The superiority of these movies can be attributed to James Whale's direction and the acting of the principals:  Boris Karloff as a monster who is simultaneously sympathetic and repellent and Colin Clive as his creator, whose manic efforts to create life have driven him to the brink of insanity.  ""Bride"" also features a great screen villain in the delightful Dr. Pretorius.

The other three films begin the descent into B-moviedom.  Son of Frankenstein follows Basil Rathbone as Henry's son and Bela Lugosi as the murderous Ygor.  The Monster (played for the last time by Karloff) starts to be less interesting as he loses his human qualities and just lumbers about.  In subsequent movies, he spends more and more time in a weakened state requiring electricity to regain his strength.  In Ghost of Frankenstein, the Monster and Ygor seek the assistance of Frankenstein's other son; Ygor wants his own evil brain in the monster's immortal body, and the results are predictably disastrous.  The next in the sequence is actually Frankenstein meets the Wolf Man (part of the Wolf Man set), followed by House of Frankenstein, which includes all three of the great monsters, though never together.  By this time, the Monster seems to resemble Herman Munster more than Karloff's original version.

Overall, this collection gets five stars because it contains two great movies.  If the other three are of lesser quality, it does not diminish the set as an entirety.  If you enjoy classic monster movies, this should be a fun set.",1092700800,,2054,5.068452380952381

1989517,5,B0001CNRLQ,"After obtaining this collection for $20 at a local retail store, I knew I was getting more than my money's worth! The films are shown in the best picture form and the sound is very crisp and clear!
Out of all the three Legacy sets, this one has the best selection of films on it.
My only gripe was that mine included a plate of the Van Helsing Frankenstein version and it was GLUED to the collector's box! After wiping the glue off with a damp cloth and quickly drying it, it looks like new. But sadly, the glue with the dampness from the cloth sort of made the front part of my Dracula box bubbly. So be careful when cleaning them if you get a Van Helsing plate with yours! They should have just shrinked wrapped the plates with the film instead of gluing them!",1087344000,,762,4.226027397260274

I was horrified to see that Universal wasted the great cover art for this collection on a nasty cardboard box that's going to look good for about 10 minutes.
It would have looked great in a regular double dvd case.

Otherwise, a great collection.",1086480000,5,321,4.649122807017544
1989519,5,B0001CNRLQ,"This collection has been long overdue! Savor it! Relish it! The ultimate Universal collection in all of its digitally remastered glory will NOT disapppoint the true fans of the genre nor any low key fan either. Frankenstein collection includes the 1931 RESTORED version(""Now I know what it feels like to BE GOD!""), the superior 1935 sequel BRIDE (Elsa Lanchester's bust line has never looked better!), solid sequel SON, 1942's Ghost, and the very good HOUSE OF(1944).
  Bride of Frankenstein will always be my fave from Universal's vault of horror and the commentary is highly engaging. Watch it without and then with. Maybe someday Universal will release the fully restored 90 minute version of Bride that includes the Dwight Frye murder subplot involving Auntie and Uncle Glutz, the Goldstadt Morgue inquest scene, the monster's assault on E.E. Clive's(Was he Colin's brother?) burgomeister, Dr. Pretorious's OTHER little person in jar scene(part of which can still be glimpsed in this version), and the extended prologue with even more of busty Lanchester.
  The films, themselves, look extraordinary on DVD. They are crisp, clear and sound magnificent. One interesting feature with regard to 'Frankenstein' and 'Bride Of' is the special features involving still photos with background music. Noteworthy:Bride of Frankenstein was one of the first films to have a fully orchestrated score just for the film. There is even a gem of commentary in which we learn that a rumour circulated of Franz Waxman suing Rodgers and Hammerstein(Listen to Bali Hi from South Pacific and tell me that it does not evoke the 3-note creation sequence from Bride!). Theatrical trailers are a riot, but why was Valerie Hobson the only actor in which Universal superimposed a title card over her preview scene? My only complaint is that Universal should have included Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein(read my review of this one).",1086048000,2,1914,5.245098039215686
1989520,5,B0001CNRLQ,"Just as Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein are the most complex and impressive of all the classic Universal monster movies, Frankenstein The Legacy Collection is the most impressive of the three Legacy Collection DVD sets.  Not only do you get five classic Frankenstein's monster films, you also are treated to more numerous and significant extra features here than in the Dracula and Wolf Man Legacy Collection releases.
It is difficult to compare and contrast the different Universal monsters; my personal predilection draws me to Dracula, but I daresay Frankenstein's monster is the most successful, memorable, and influential of the Dracula - Frankenstein's monster -Wolf Man triad.  The first two Frankenstein films are nothing short of brilliant (although I still regret that they did not truly recreate the monster of Mary Shelley's imaginative vision), with the sequel, Bride of Frankenstein, actually going one better than the original.  When you think of Universal's Dracula, you think of Bela Lugosi; when you think of The Wolf Man, you think of Lon Chaney, Jr.  When you think of Frankenstein, however, you think of Boris Karloff as the monster, Colin Clive as Dr. Frankenstein, Elsa Lanchester as the Bride of Frankenstein, James Whale as the ingenious director, Jack Pierce as the legendary horror make-up artist, etc.  Virtually every last detail of the first two Frankenstein films is perfect, unforgettable, and remarkably complex - the vision, the style of presentation, the iconic performances, the make-up, the special effects, everything.  Not even Dracula is as memorable in half as many ways as both Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein are.
Little more need be said of the first two Frankenstein films; they are the best of the Universal classics, and their complexity and appeal make them more amazing and impressive with each day that passes.  But what of the other three films included here?  Well, Frankenstein isn't what he used to be under Whale's direction.  A lot of people seem to like Son of Frankenstein, but I see this is as the beginning of the big, dumb Frankenstein's monster stereotype that has stripped the monster of popular culture of the innocence and great human pathos that defined him early on.  The film is most significant for being Karloff's last performance in the role he made his own, as the great horror actor wisely wished to have no part in the now-inevitable dumbing-down of the monster.  Featuring Basil Rathbone as Baron Wolf von Frankenstein, Bela Lugosi as Ygor, the broken-necked madman who befriends and to some degree controls the monster, and Lionel Atwill as the show-stealing Inspector Krogh, Son of Frankenstein robs the creature of his ability to speak and thus denies him the moving vestige of humanity bestowed upon him in the unsurpassed Bride of Frankenstein.
The Ghost of Frankenstein continues the story begun in Son of Frankenstein, this time introducing yet another Frankenstein son in the form of Dr. Ludwig Frankenstein (played most engagingly by Sir Cedric Hardwick).  Incredibly, both Ygor (Lugosi) and the monster (now played by Lon Chaney, Jr.) survived the end of the previous film, and the pair set out to find yet another son of Frankenstein in hopes of restoring the monster's strength (long baths in boiling sulphur followed by radical ice therapy can get a monster down).  Not surprisingly, the monster stirs up a little trouble in town, and Ludwig's attempt to undo his father's crucial mistake by replacing the monster's brain with a solid, non-criminal brain ultimately goes awry, thanks to Ygor and Ludwig's traitorous assistant Dr. Bohmer (Lionel Atwill).  I actually found Ghost of Frankenstein to be a major improvement on the Son of Frankenstein storyline, although most fans seem to prefer Son of Frankenstein over this film.
House of Frankenstein boasts all three of the Universal monster heavyweights: Frankenstein's monster (now played by Glenn Strange), the Wolf Man (Lon Chaney, Jr.), and Count Dracula (played by John Carradine - the world's worst Dracula).  It also features Boris Karloff in the role of the mad scientist who causes all sorts of trouble.  A sequel of sorts to Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, House of Frankenstein is a major disappointment in my eyes; only the Wolf Man character gets a decent treatment in this fun but rather insignificant film.
The extras in this collection are wonderful.  For starters, you get theatrical trailers for all the films except Son of Frankenstein, poster and photo galleries for Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein, and a discussion by Van Helsing director Stephen Sommers of the pervading influence of Universal's Frankenstein's monster in the horror movie industry.  Frankenstein comes with a commentary by film historian Rudy Behlmer, while Bride of Frankenstein features commentary by film historian Scott MacQueen (one of the best commentaries I've heard).  Then there are two significant feature documentaries: The Frankenstein Files: How Hollywood Made a Monster looks back through the history of the Universal Frankenstein movies, while She's Alive! Creating the Bride of Frankenstein examines the making of Bride of Frankenstein.  Both of these features include wonderful interviews with the daughter of Boris Karloff and the son of Dwight Frye.  Finally, there is a short film called Boo!  I was clueless as to what this could be, and I am still unsure of its origins, but it is basically a slightly comical little film featuring footage from Nosferatu, Frankenstein, and at least one other film.
This collection is not perfect (beware in particular a dangerous little bump in the casing beneath each DVD, as each one is just dying for the chance to scratch a disc). Still, considering how much material is included here, the Frankenstein Legacy Collection DVD set is a bargain that all Frankenstein fans would do well to snatch up.  Of course, if you are interested in Dracula and the Wolf Man as well as Frankenstein's monster, look into getting the all-inclusive Monster Legacy Collection.",1085875200,205,6067,5.193647540983607
1989521,5,B0001CNRLQ,"In celebration of VAN HELSING, Universal has pulled out the classic monster movies and given them the royal treatment that has been long overdue to them.  This is the FRANKENSTEIN box set, containing five of the films telling the horrific, tragic tale of the Frankenstein Monster.

1. FRANKENSTEIN (1931)
Under the protection of darkness, Dr. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) and his hunchback assistant Fritz (Dwight Frye) steal bodies and organs to build the doctor's dream; a man-made being.  On a stormy night, with Dr. Frankenstein's mentor, Dr. Waldman (Edward Van Sloan), Victor Moritz (John Boles), and his fiancee Elizabeth (Mae Clarke) watching him, Frankenstein brings his creation to life.  Unknowingly, the brain Frankenstein used was a criminal's brain.  Now, the doctor must do what he can to stop the Monster (Boris Karloff)
  A pure classic, none the less.  The atmosphere is appropriately gothic, the makeup is ingenious, the script is almost flawless, and the direction is very unique (4 closeups in a row, followed by an establishing shot).  Performance wise, Clive defines the accursed doctor, Boles does what he can in his thankless role, Clarke is breathtaking as Elizabeth, Frye sets the standard for crazed assistants, Van Sloan is in strong form, and of course, Boris Karloff is in his star-winning performance as the monster.
JUDGEMENT: 100

2. THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1935)
Though apparently killed by the burning windmill, the monster (Boris Karloff) survives, as does the good doctor (Colin Clive).  Unfortunately, Dr. Pretorious (Ernest Thesiger) coerces Henry back into the realm of gods and monsters, suggesting they give the monster, who has learned how to talk, what he wants; a bride (Elsa Lancaster)
  James Whale has done the unthinkable.  He has created a sequel that has surpassed it's legendary original.  The gothic scenery, the beautiful dialogue, and the narrative is brilliant, retaining the elements of the novel and being original at the same time.  Karloff delivers his greatest performance ever, Clive delivers an intensity that was unrivaled during that time, Thesiger is simply brilliant as the Dr. Hyde version of Dr. Frankenstein, Lancaster is equally beautiful as Mary Shelley as she is terrifying as the bride, and they're supported by a well-rounded supporting cast.
JUDGEMENT: 100

3. SON OF FRANKENSTEIN (1939)
Many many years after the ""destruction"" of the monster, Dr. Frankenstein's son, Wolf Von Frankenstein (Basil Rathbone) and his family have moved in to Castle Frankenstein, despite the hatred the town has for their family.  Their happiness is shattered when Wolf discovers that the monster (Boris Karloff) lives in his father's laboratory.  The monster's friend, Ygor (Bela Lugosi) convinces the doctor to help the monster.  However, Ygor lies behind ulterior motives.
  While it lacks a bit in atmosphere, it certainly lives up to the previous films, with a welcome sense of sarcasm and humor.  Karloff is back for the final time as the monster, once more speechless, and he delivers another fine performance.  Rathbone brings some youthfulness to the franchise and a daringness that Henry Frankenstein didn't have in the first two.  Atwill shines in one of his many roles in the Frankenstein films, and Lugosi nearly steals the movie in the only role that surpasses DRACULA.
JUDGEMENT: 97

4. THE GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN (1942)
A few years have passed now, and the people demand that Dr. Frankenstein's abandoned laboratory be destroyed.  They destroy it, but fail to kill Ygor (Bela Lugosi), who miraculously survived the wounds Wolf Von Frankenstein inflicted upon him.  When the building is blown up, the Monster (Lon Chaney, Jr.) is set free.  However, he is sick and requires the help of Dr. Frankenstein's 2nd son, Ludwig Von Frankenstein (Sir Cedric Hardwicke).  Ludwig reluctantly agrees to help the monster, but then chooses to give this monster a good brain, one that will rid it of evil.  However, Ygor has other plans.
  Though good, it falls behind a bit.  Erle C. Kenton, though a good director, clearly lacks the style and wit of James Whale and Rowland Lee.  The screenplay is good, though, and the film overall is more tense than the previous films.  Hardwicke is a nice contrast from the more energetic Rathbone, Lugosi is good as always, Atwill is back in a different role, and Chaney, Jr. is trying his best to play the monster.  Worth a watch.
JUDGEMENT: 88

5. HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1944)
Dr. Gustav Niemann (Boris Karloff) escapes from prison with his assistant, Daniel (J. Carrol Naish), with the intent to find the records of Dr. Frankenstein and make his own monster.  Along the way, Dr. Niemann seeks revenge against those who sent him to prison, and they also run across a gypsy woman (Belle Mitchell) who Daniel falls in love for.  They also meet Count Dracula (John Carradine), Larry Talbot AKA The Wolf Man (Lon Chaney, Jr.) and Frankenstein's monster himself (Glenn Strange)
  Though overly silly at times and not as effective as the rest of the bunch, HOUSE is a nice addition to the franchise.  Karloff, though sadly missed from his trademark role, does good here, and it's nice to see him without all that makeup for once.  Naish makes his hunchback sympathetic, and Mitchell is wonderfully full of life.  Chaney, Jr. is great as Talbot/Wolfman, and it's nice for him to have a love interest this time out.  Carradine takes the role of Dracula and makes it his own, but he feels like an afterthought and pretty much slows the narrative down.  Strange is one of the better Frankenstein monsters.  Not too bad.
JUDGEMENT: 76

EXTRAS
There are also some really nice and informative documentaries.  THE FRANKENSTEIN FILES tells you all you ever wanted to know about these films, SHE'S ALIVE! is strictly about the creation of THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, and there is a documentary featuring the cast and crew of VAN HELSING discussing these old films.  Both FRANKENSTEIN and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN have commentaries, but they are boring and dull.  A couple of trailers, a short film, and a few extras scattered around as well.
JUDGEMENT: 90

OVERALL
Three flawless films, one really good film, and one good yet flawed film, combined with boring commentaries, interesting documentaries, a fun short film, and Stephen Sommer's VAN HELSING documentary make for a wonderful box set that is everything that these films deserved and then some

1989522,5,B0001CNRLQ,"1. Frankenstein (1931) - Dr. Frankenstein breathes new life into a body made of dead parts. Unfortunatly it gets an abnormal brain and begins to terrorize the countryside. The only one who can stop him is his creator. Even for a 70+ year old movie, this is how to make a classic horror movie.  Contained commentary from a film historian. 10/10
2. Bride of Frankenstein (1935) - The monster survived, and now is looking for companionship. Meanwhile another scientist forces Dr. Frankenstein to continue his reanimation of the dead. The monster gets to speak and suprisingly gives an emotional performance. Also has running commentary. 9.5/10
3. Son of Frankenstein (1939) - The son of Frankenstein returns to discover the monster still lives with his friend Ygor (Lugosi). When the monster begins to kill again he must find a way to stop him.  7/10

Of course the first two are the best--still chilling and mesmerizing; the subsequent sequels, however, are best only for inducing nostalgic memories of Saturday matinees gone by...  Even, so Universal's done a terrific job of collecting and packaging the franchise.
The bonus features are good, too, although the blatant tie-in with the new VAN HELSING movie is borderline obnoxious and can only be forgiven because of Stephen Somers's on eloquent infatuation with the original films.

Also House of Frankenstein is awesome becouse Boris is the mad scientist that succumbs to the monster. As if you need anything else, Bela Lugosi plays Igor in Son and Ghost. These are the classics that we all searched for for years. Now they are all together in an awesome package.

1989525,5,B0001CNRLQ,"Frankenstein's Monster is probably one of the most misunderstood monster in horror film's history. Wasn't his choice, the Monster was made to be alive. He speaked for himself, ""I love dead, I hate living."" The Monster wasn't that bad at all, he's just like the Elephant Man, quite sympathetic.
The DVD contains 2 disc (1 single sided and 1 double sided) with 5 classic horror films: four sequels of Frankenstein, and one another film called House of Frankenstein. It comes with quite lots of special features like original theatrical trailers, documentary feature, commentary audio track, original poster and photo galleries, English closed captioned, and other substitles, etc. Surprisingly, both picture and audio quality are quite good & clear. Obviously, they are newly remastered for better clarity.
It also includes an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at how these original Frankenstein films inspired director Stephen Sommers on his new movie Van Helsing. I don't feel it's an inspiration, I think Stephen Sommers wants to reuse couple classic scenes to show some authenticity of Frankenstein's monster in his new movie. But it seems it's trying to promote his new movie Van Helsing. Besides that, the true & serious fans of Frankenstein should find this DVD as their MUST-HAVE collectible item.",1084579200,3,1302,5.325242718446602
1989526,5,B0001CNRLQ,"I missed buying Frankenstein (1931) when it was out 4 years ago and have been kicking myself ever since.  Its been selling for $30 or more on ebay and then you're sometimes buying a Brazillian edition(!!!).--
I enjoyed finally seeing the original (twice) and then watching it with the commentary turned on.
I then watched Bride the same way.  (okay so I'm a DVD nerd).
This set was a bargain. While I think the first 3 Frankenstein films are REAL Classics I prefer Son of Frankenstein just a tad over the other two for personal reasons.
""Son of Frankenstein"" has glaring continuty flaws if one has just viewed the first two movies.
Why is the village that is home to The Family Frankenstein now known 25 years later as the village of Frankenstein rather than the village of Gestadt as in the first two? [There was a signpost which established this in the first movie]
The lab was in an old watchtower (very much destroyed) not next door to the castle.
and so on and so on....
But Basil Rathbone's ""Wolf"" (Wolfgang von Frankenstein--notice the 'von' has been added) and the character of Inspector Krogh are superb.
Karloff's monster is actually better I think now that he is mute again. [Karloff always belived that the monster having speech in ""Bride"" was a mistake""].
Lugosi's Ygor is a true villain.  He also set the benchmark for Mad Scientist Sidekicks that lives today. [Well you don't see a Mad Scientist's sidekick called Frtiz or Karl!]
All 5 movies are treasures.  Keep in mind that Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman leads into Ghost of Frankenstein.

1989527,3,B0001CNRLQ,"By now everyone should be familiar with Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's macabre tale of the doctor who created life by sewing together parts of dead bodies. That the movie ""Frankenstein"" (1931)has very little to do with the rest of the novel is a mute point. James Whale's masterfully directed film remains one of the high water marks of cinema in general and horror films in particular. Whale followed his original up with ""The Bride Of Frankenstein"", a film that many critics consider equal to, if not better than, the original. Sadly, the last three films in this series are pathetic B-pictures that do not capture either the essence or mood of the first two masterpieces.
TRANSFER: The original 1931 film looks very good for its age. Though age related artifacts exist they are not terribly distracting. There is also a considerable amount of film grain. The grain is more noticeable in ""Bride of Frankenstein"" than the original. The last three films in the series are rendered with a marked improvement in image quality. In all cases, the gray scale is properly balanced with deep, solid blacks and nicely balanced contrast levels. There is a bit of edge enhancement and some pixelization but never anything that terribly distracts. The audio for all the films is mono. The original 1931 film exhibits slightly more hiss.
EXTRAS: Two very concisely produced featurettes that discuss the making of the first two films, an audio commentary for the first two movies and theatrical trailers and production notes for all of the films.
BOTTOM LINE: While the transfer quality is somewhat inconsistently rendered, this is by far the best that these films have ever look. Recommended!",1083456000,2,1679,5.021505376344086
1989528,4,B0001CNRLQ,"A few words of praise about a quality release at a reasonable price.
Such great care was taken in assembling and organizing the extras on this 2-disc set, I must assume the movies themselves are faithfully presented.
Though the 5 movies are split between 2 discs, one of them 2-sided, I've rarely seen such a good job of organizing. Frankenstein and Bride, plus trailers and publicity material are on disc 1. The posters and publicity stills for Bride are lavishly presented. Backed with Franz Waxman's errily beautiful score, the items are arranged to tell the story of Bride in a 9-minute montage like none I've seen or heard. The scores to all the movies are so brilliant and shrill you can picture a studio orchestra recording them. Even the subtitles have an unusual clarity. Their font and placement make them like none I've seen. The DVD box is a hard, snap container. Again, like none I've seen. This is why I say great care was taken with this collection, regardless of your feeling for the lesser sequels, Ghost, Son and House. One thing I must note, the outside box promises four Frankensein trailers, the original and three reissues. I've found only one, though the others might be within the documentaries on disc 2. This in no way mitigrates my admiration for this effort.",1083283200,2,1286,4.771300448430493
