I thought that Vanilla Ice and Dennis Rodman had bad movies, well actually they do have bad movies, but this one, woo! I did like that beautiful sister from the Five Heartbeats but oh is this movie bad! I'm going to use it for when my family comes to visit and we'l have something to laugh at.",1370822400,,378,4.121621621621622
7975527,5,B00007ELF5,"I could not believe my eyes when I saw this film.  I heard it was crazy and kooky it went beyond that!  The acting is bizarre, the characters are strange, the fighting is crazy, but best of all you can show this to your kids, (not very bloody at all,) and kids will like the stupid humor.

This has got to be the best of the worst, if they did this on purpose then they are geniuses.

Get it and than laugh at it! then see it again!",1113177600,2,432,3.875
7975528,4,B00007ELF5,"I truly am the world's worst critic when it comes to martial arts movies. At least half my DVD collection consists of martial arts movies.

I was truly at a loss for words after seeing THE BLACK NINJA. I just could not decide if I loved it or hated it. I bought this movie for about $15, and I'll be the first to say that I probably spent a hell of alot more buying THE BLACK NINJA than the filmmakers spent making it.

Most of the ""budget"" probably went to the Black Ninja costume which look like a cross between the costumes of ZORRO and IRON MONKEY, although I'm stumped as to how he's sees out of that mask.(Don't be fooled by the DVD box art;Clayton Prince never wears anything that look like that.)

That's just as well, too, since the costume, a silly but very comic book like costume, is the only decent special effect in the movie. This film had to have been shot on video, the picture is so incredily crummy by any standard.

However, the martial arts action is a different story. While nothing spectacular, is competantly coreographed, and features a few really nice moves. In particular, a rather short but totally sweet fight between the Black Ninja and a small, yet lethal henchman features some impressive blackflips, somersaults, and spinning kicks.

There's also the use of what I like to call ""punch'n crunch"" sound effects every time a blow lands. This appears often in direct-to-video martial arts flicks. And there are also triple takes on many kicks; you'll see what I mean when you see it.

Clayton Prince is a fine actor, and appears to be a competant martial artist. While I can't excuse the complete lack of budget, and the short (TWO WEEKS!!!!) filming schedule, the martial arts action works fairly well, the BLACK NINJA theme song is catchy (if a bit outdated), and I find it hard to not like a film that is funny both when it is and is not supposed to be.

So, if Clayton Prince is reading review right now, I'd like to tell him: Clayton, you clearly wanted wanted to make a cool kung fu movie, and you sort of accomplished that here. So, next time, take the budget, multiply it by 1,000, extend the shooting schedule by no less than one month, and get together a few competant martial artists, and make BLACK NINJA 2.

That could send you on your way to being the next Wesley Snipes.",1092614400,5,2314,4.479809976247031
7975529,3,B00007ELF5,"Currently, this movie costs $89 to buy and $4 to rent. Combine the two sums and you've probably spent more on it than the producers of this class trash! Two things are immediately remarkable about this movie. First, the fiften seconds, combined, comprising the opening and closing animation sequences have production values which are immensely better than the actual movie. Second, by all accounts, the movie accomplishes its primary task, it's actually entertaining. Someone called this DTV a ""blaxploitation"" movie. I don't think so. While the majority of the cast is Black, this effort exploits all races, Black, White and Asian with equal opportunity.
  Entertain yourself, and do the the writer/director/star a favor by renting it now, and buying it as soon as the purchase price drops below $20. The pre-feature preview promos on the VHS rental copy of ""The Black Ninja"" for ""Pimps Up,Ho's Down"" and ""Welcome to the Terror Dome"" are, in and of themselves, worth the price of popcorn. The former for its sheer audacity, the latter for its hint that things could be exponentially worse in every way that ""art"" might be.
  Don't confuse this effort with the Chris Kelly title of the same name. Clayton Prince is head (but not shoulders. He's taller.) above that star in acting ability and modesty. Where else, have you ever seen a movie whose credits start with ""written and directed by me"" (sic), above the head of the star/writer/director?
  Let's put it this way, if ""Gigli"" and ""The Black Ninja""
were competing for the Best Picture Oscar(TM), ""Gigli"" would win for production values, ""The Black Ninja"" would win for entertainment value!",1073088000,,1643,5.022058823529412
7975530,1,B00007ELF5,"I rented this film (thank god I rented it!!!) thinking that it would be the next Black Mask or the next Revenge of the Ninja, but it turns out that is a stupid poor productions with ""home cameras"", HORRIBLE fight choreogrhapic,FATAL acting and in each fight there is a background music singing ""Black Ninja"" in Rap mode.
This is the worst ninja movie ever because every scenes are copies of Batman and some Sonny Chiba's classic movies, I prefer to watch Batman of the 70's than this garbage.
P.S: THANK GOD I RENTED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1062201600,,538,4.73404255319149
7975531,1,B00007ELF5,"This movie didn't even rate 1/2 of a star. I'm big on ninja flicks and this movie was a joke. The ""black ninja"" was a defense attorney who fights his clients at night. It just doesn't make any sense!",1054944000,,199,4.128205128205129
7975532,2,B00007ELF5,"I borrowed this movie from a friend who rented it, and thought it was as hilarious as he did!  The reason I gave it two stars was because it was so corny that is was funny.  The toilet scene was classic, and definitely gives a new meaning to the word, flatulation.  I was cracking up!  The plot of the movie is supposed to be serious, but the acting was really bad, so bad that you couldn't help but laugh at most of the movie.  And the action sequences, when they have a punch or a kick repeated three times, is a riot as well!  I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a movie that is so bad, that it is funny.  If the movie was rated on making you laugh, I would have given this four or five stars, but since it is supposed to be serious, I would have to give it 2 stars.  Anyway, if you want a good laugh, go to your local Hollywood or Blockbuster and rent this, I guarantee you will be laughing out loud!  :)",1045180800,,924,3.9782608695652173
