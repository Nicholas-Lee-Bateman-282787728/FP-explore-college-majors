2569644,5,B000FJVUXM,The exercises on this DVD are very good for our water aerobics class.  I lead a class in a 55 and over community and have used several exercises from this DVD.  It really helps with balance.  The ladies said they couldn't hardly keep their balance when we first started but have improved so they don't wobble at all now.  We have enjoyed it.,1311984000,5,341,4.365079365079365
2569645,4,B000FJVUXM,"I have purchased both the Yoga and Pilates DVD that Carol has made and they are very good and informative. She also has a Ti chi DVD she did before these and she has created wonderful programs that are also easy to follow. I work out sometimes up to 7 days a week and use her DVD's on the days when there is no instructor an find if you follow her and do as she says to,you will see a difference in how you feel and it does help with posture and balance. So try them out for yourself, I think you will agree with me.",1311206400,7,516,3.8773584905660377

8123806,4,B000FJVUXM,"I am trying to use my pool for something more than floating on my float and reading books on my Kindle .... and I purchased this dvd thinking I could start working out in my back yard.  I reviewed the dvd and it seems like it should be easy to follow as the directions from the instructor are clear, but putting it into action is a little delayed on my part.  Tomorrow, I promise ....",1446940800,,384,4.1066666666666665
8123807,5,B000FJVUXM,Carol Argo dvd's are great.  She is pleasant to watch and easy to follow.  Her dvd's are great learning tools.,1423612800,,110,4.45
8123808,4,B000FJVUXM,Not exactly what I was looking for but good exercise for stretching but in my opinion better to do on land.,1412553600,,107,4.142857142857143
8123809,3,B000FJVUXM,"This video was okay. I didn't get much out of it but if you have a tv near your pool you may try and follow along. No video is quite like being in the pool with an instructor, but this video was done as well as possible.",1411948800,,220,3.702127659574468
8123810,3,B000FJVUXM,I like the DVD but when out in the pool it does me absolutely no good.  I got the water pilates and love it.  It came with a CD too!,1374451200,,132,3.3666666666666667
8123811,4,B000FJVUXM,"I did not follow the instructions and watch the video on dry land before I used, I just plunged in.  Big mistake.  As I had never performed Yoga before it was difficult learning posses while attempting to balance.  The biggest issue I had was maintaining balance.  Thought it was because I had not purchased shoes, so order them.  Still have difficulty with balance, the issue was me and not familarizing myself before using.  Once got the hand of the posses, learned how to steady my balance and enjoyed the video.",1352246400,10,515,4.666666666666667
