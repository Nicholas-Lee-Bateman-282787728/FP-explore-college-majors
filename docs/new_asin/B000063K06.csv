1690229,2,B000063K06,"I was really looking forward to this DVD after reading the other reviews, but in the end I felt really let down.  You only get to see snippets of the live show.  We were really frustrated when the disc cuts away from the Hecubus sketch just when it really gets going. :(  Audio and video quality is often poor.  It DOES give you a glimpse into the group dynamics of the kids, and Scott's robot dog fetish IS hilarious, but I was left wanting much more.",1019952000,,452,4.22093023255814
1690230,4,B000063K06,"I just bought this DVD over the weekend, and I must say it is one hell of a film.  I have only been watching Kids in the Hall for a few years, but in that short time I have become a huge fan of their work (I always make sure the tape is set every day at 2pm on Comedy Central).  Unfortunately it is not easy for me to see their live performances because either I don't have the money for a ticket, or they don't come terribly close to where I live.  That's what is so great about this DVD: you get to experience the aspects of actually seeing one of their live tour shows, AND you get to go backstage to see how the 5 Kids interact with each other, and prepare for their shows.  My only complaint about this DVD is that there wasn't MORE!! (which is the only reason why it isn't ***** instead of ****) I could have watched the live show footage, as well as the backstage footage all day long.
I also enjoyed the extra features, specifically Kevin ""Eating Soup."" Kevin is by far my favorite 'Kid' -- even though I'm in the .0000001% of people who think that (heh heh, just kidding Kevster) -- so it was great to see him, yet again take something as simple as eating soup, and turn it into a comedic masterpiece. I'm not going to go into detail about every little thing that happened in this DVD, but I will say that the entire 80 + minutes (as well as the bonus footage such as ""Kevin Eating Soup,"" ""Dave's Eye Surgery"" and the commentary from Mike Myers and others) will not disappoint any KITH fan. If you've been craving something new from these guys, and haven't been able to get out and see them on tour (like myself), then I strongly suggest you go out and get this DVD.  And yes..Bellini is in this too..and yes..he's wearing a towel..and yes..the whole thing's hilarious so stop wasting your time reading what I think, and go get yourself a copy of ""Same Guys, New Dresses"" NOW ...!!",1019520000,7,1890,4.2534818941504176
1690231,4,B000063K06,"A great ""documentary"" of the KITH gang as they performed across
the country.  Very insightful, and damn hilarious to boot.  I
hope this inspires them to put out another movie.  Please, please
make another movie....
Bonus footage on the DVD as well as commentary by some other well-
know Canadians.",1019433600,,297,4.9
1690252,5,B000063K06,"I discovered the Kids through Comedy Central re-runs a few months ago and was heartbroken when the network replaced their former 2-3pm hour with... more SNL reruns! We need more of those!
Anyway, before I get off on another Comedy Central diatribe, I want to say that this DVD is absolutely hilarious. I hadn't seen that much of the Kids work in comparison with the entire body of it, and was looking forward to getting a look into the guys' personalities and real life personas -- and that's exactly what I got. It's really easy to get a real idea of each of the Kids here. Scott definitely comes off as the most fun and the most like he is onstage. Surprisingly Bruce, who seems so lighthearted and whimsical on stage, is much more business-like and not as easily likable offstage.
There's not that much of the guys' 2001 tour on this DVD; it focuses more on the behind the scenes work. It's put together in a way that you can see the work that went on for the few sketches that are shown almost fully: the Tanya sketch, the opening credits, and perhaps most in-depth, Scott's monologue involving his robo-dog, a hilarious behind the scenes diversion that will keep you laughing.
Of course, the group's stage work is as strong as ever, but this DVD is especially recommmended to those who have seen everything KITH but want to know more about the individual guys, how they work, and what they're really like. As for extras, ""Kevin Eating Soup"" is hysterical to watch for some strange reason, as are the other extra features (one, ""Phoner,"" is actually rather serious and shows Dave, Scott, and Mark's real feelings about the group), and the commentary from the Kids, especially Mark and Scott's, will keep you in stitches. A great KITH purchase!",1040947200,17,1747,4.656957928802589
1690253,4,B000063K06,"This documentary about the 2000 reunion tour of the Canadian sketch comedy troop The Kids in the Hall is unlikely to be of interest to anyone who is not already a fan.  There is not much concert footage.  Instead, it is a low-key documentary, shot on the cheap, with lots of exclusive footage of the Kids at work as they deal with the demands of touring and their own sometimes contentious personalities.  This is NOT the film to watch for an introduction to KITH's brand of comedy, although there are some laughs here.  Rather, it is for the fan who wishes to learn about the personalities and working style of this excellent team of comedians.",1039824000,7,645,4.582608695652174
1690254,5,B000063K06,"If you've never seen the Kids in the Hall TV show, I have a few choice words for you: 2pm Eastern, Comedy Central.  This is what SNL really really wants to be: consistently smart, quirky, insane, and downright hilarious.  All five actors routinely turn in wonderful performances.
And if you end up seeing the entire run of the show (as it ended a little less than a decade ago) and want something else to tide you over until the next Kids film (rent Brain Candy!  inventive, quirky, darkly hilarious), this would be it.  I've noticed some reviewers seem to be wanting skits, or even glorification of the actors: this really isn't it.  This is the Kids, ten years later, still incredibly funny and sardonic.  They talk shop, they perform, they stain expensive hotel couches and plan gags for Conan.  The extras are HILARIOUS, especially Kevin Eating Soup, which is exactly what the title suggests.
This isn't meant to be an extension of the TV show; it's a look behind the camera.  And the commentaries are wonderful; not lifeless at all, as one reviewer claimer, but a funny (and occaisionally slightly touching - Mike Myers) addition to a nice piece of work.  (Dave Foley directed.)  It isn't Oscar material, and probably not for newcomers, but if you're a KITH fan, it's worth your money.",1028937600,7,1290,4.744394618834081
1690255,1,B000063K06,"This DVD was the most dissapointing purchase I've made in a long while.  I saw this show live in Boston in 2000 and it was a blast, funny as hell!  The DVD does NOT capture the show, instead it shows meaningless and humorless behind the scenes footage with some other random footage which adds nothing.  Leave that stuff for the extra features and give us the show uncut.  The tapes of the old shows, which are classic, are a much better choice for a purchase.",1027382400,2,460,4.376470588235295
1690256,1,B000063K06,"Saw the Kids in the Hall in concert, and it was great. You can tell that they live to perform, and there was something magical about the show that isn't captured on a television screen.
But this documentary is beyond sad. Don't waste your money on this thing...its all arguing and legal matters. Go purchase brain candy, or their best of tape, or see them live next time they tour. This movie is only disappointing and quite depressing.",1025308800,2,436,4.602564102564102
1690257,3,B000063K06,"I would like to praise Dr. Georg Grober for his wonderful review. It is the best review I have ever read. Thank you Dr. Grober. The five stars are for you.
Have you purchased the Mr. Show DVD? I highly recommend it.",1024704000,,215,4.142857142857143
1690258,2,B000063K06,"In my opinion, there's In Living Color, The Ben Stiller Show, Mr. Show, and Saturday Night Live, and then there's Groucho Marx, Spike Milligan, Peter Sellers, Monty Python, Woody Allen, and The Kids in the Hall. There's talent, and then there is genius. Yes, genius. Is a comedic genius somehow less than a genius in Physics? Yes. But I don't laugh at kinetic energy (hey, I'm trying to be funny, look at that).
I watch only one hour of TV a day. The one hour of television I watch every day is the one hour of The Kids in the Hall I've recorded while at work. I was SO eager to watch this. I was grinning, looking at the cover as I headed over to a friend's to watch it (""Oh, look, Mark's put on a little weight, ha ha,"" and ""Ooh, I never knew Dave had a tattoo. Hmm.""). How could this movie miss? I thought I could watch the guys put on lipstick for an hour and a half and still somehow enjoy it. But oh my. What a cold, dreadful, bitter movie.
As Dave Foley admits, no one really wanted to shoot this documentary. Not even Jason Priestly for crying out loud (notice how quiet Priestly gets on the commentary when Foley brings up the idea). Foley ended up with hundreds of hours of footage of struggling lawyers and struggling technicians and struggling sketch comedy artists (oh, and some struggling, booing fans).
When I finished watching the movie (and then again with commentary), I really got the feeling that I had indeed just watched footage that ""ended up"" somewhere on some poor editor's desk and a certain reluctant ""director's"" office, that later ""ended up"" for sale, and ultimately ""ended up"" in my house.
What the videographers got was five middle-aged (nearly) men doing their best to somehow usurp one another (to what end at this point in their respective careers is beyond me) using techniques best known by rotten little children. At least Scott Thompson understood that--maybe subconsciously, maybe who cares--and used the robotic puppy to get his precious attention instead of acidic grumblings put into use by Bruce and Dave. It really did work: There is way, way too much in the final cut devoted to Scott and the dog.
The movie itself is absurd. The movie pokes fun at the absurdity of the childishness of the five men in the troupe. Matt Stone and Trey Parker poke fun at how the movie pokes fun at The Kids in the Hall (quite a clever little banter they had there). A lot of poking. The Kids in the Hall must think their fans are crazy or dumb or both for wanting to go the theater and pay to see these tired old guys do Sir Simon, Chicken Lady, and Buddy Cole. Why are they so cynical and jaded? What do they have to lose?
I loved hearing Mike Myers talk about his true love of the troupe and a little on his history with the guys. He talked so earnestly. Dave and Bruce just kind of lazily lobbed unfunny quips about what we see on screen, Kevin seemed like he's just along for the ride, Jason Priestly clipped on his mic and mostly stammered in this pseudo-serious tone, and Andy Richter said some very, very forgettable things. I really liked Mark and Scott's commentary (they recorded in a different locale). I thought their commentary was funny (I like how they argue about children and ""unconditional love"") and interesting (a bit of a straight-laced Dad in McKinney speaking alongside Scott, who wants to be considered just ""funny,"" instead of the ""gay, funny guy""). Their talk was not so snappy and competitive and had a little more meat to it.
Do dumb, online reviews need a summary paragraph?
Hope you like the DVD. I didn't.",1024272000,13,3563,4.5170278637770895
1690259,4,B000063K06,"I always love seeing ""Behind the scenes"" goodies about comedy groups. As Monty Python gave us ""Life of Python"", so Kids in the Hall gives us ""Same Guys New Dresses"". The concert footage is very good, but is used notsomuch to just show you the skits but more to play off of the rehearsals and backstage antics and headaches caused. The ""Kevin trying to appease the crowd after the show is 2 hours late"" bit is hilarious!
You'll definitely want the DVD on this one as it makes the purchase 2 movies in one as the commentary provided by the five kids is just as funny as watching it without.
Definitely worth buying!",1023062400,5,613,4.433628318584071
1690260,5,B000063K06,"This is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen. They even brought back lots of the funniest characters from the show. But sadly they forgot about gavin. Now, who agrees with me that they should come out with season one of kids in the hall on dvd???",1020816000,3,251,4.25
1690261,5,B000063K06,"This is a very fun and entertaining documentary of the Kids in the Hall tour of 2000. Not only are you given some of the hilarious bits from the actual performances they did, but you also get insightful ""behind the scenes"" stuff showing the group dynamics. From Scott Thompson obsessing over the robot dog he wanted for the act, to the sniping when Dave Foley and Kevin McDonald did a Conan bit on the show that Scott had cancelled an appearance on.
The extras are great too. Everything from Dave's Lasik's surgery (I'd love to get the operation, so for an operation freak like me it was interesting to look at) to an in-depth segment on Paul Bellini, this dvd rocks. A perfect present for the diehard KITH fan and a pleasant surprise for those who have never heard of the Kids in the Hall. Buy it now!",1020124800,,802,4.425675675675675
7959190,5,B000063K06,"Was great to be a fly on the wall, and just see how the guys prepare before shows. My wife is a huge KITH fan, she really liked seeing how they dealt with issues when plans go awry. I hope they tour again. We Love you guys!!!!",1476403200,,226,3.8297872340425534

7959192,4,B000063K06,KITH is a great Comedy show from a few years back. it is one of the best sketch comedy shows ever made. i highly recommend any comedy fan buying this show. this video show cases their live show and in good action,1351987200,,212,4.071428571428571
7959193,1,B000063K06,"As the world's biggest Kids in the Hall(KITH) fan, it is with great sadness that I write this review. What a complete and utter bore. Directed by KITH member Dave Foley, the whole project has an disorganized, unedited feel to it. This DVD documents the KITH during their 2000 comedy tour. We do get some choice shots of the kids performing their brilliant  onstage comedy, but unfortunately not enough. What we get instead are long, rambling, backstage scenerios of the kids arguing or discussing the most trite, boring matters. Thrill as Scott Thompson can't figure out the owner's manual for a mechanical dog he purchased ( a prop for a skit) Watch as Mark McKinney gets confused over what type of makeup to wear! The audio is also awful, and I can't even hear what people are saying at times. What a shame that such a talented team produced such a boring dud of a DVD.",1215475200,,871,4.583333333333333
7959194,2,B000063K06,"The Kids in the Hall, Same Guys, New Dresses is something of a disappointment. It follows the Kids on their North American tour in 2000. It was kind of interesting how they showed some behind the scenes stuff and how things were written. But the problem is that the movie only showed clips from the actual tour.

There's new material, or at least newer than the old stuff from the series, but we don't get to see it. It's like a tv clip show. They show them getting dressed and eating dinner and talking about the skits. Then they show maybe 10 seconds of a clip. I kept wating for them to get to the actual show.

So don't get this unless....well, unless you like being teased. If you like your comedy shown and then quickly pulled away at the last second, this might be for you. Otherwise it's not.",1148601600,,800,4.326666666666667
7959195,5,B000063K06,"David Foley directed this into a hilarious piece.  I find this far more funny than watching a ""tour"" dvd. It is sad to see TV comedy re-enacted on stage for rabid geeks who can recite the bits in their sleep. Python at the Hollywood Bowl is a tribute to how far men are willing to denegrate themselves for a paycheck. I like this dvd because it is not at all like that. What Foley did was show us real people instead of trying to venerate or create some myth of ""the kids"". These real, funny, intelligent guys are together for better or for worse. The movie audience gets to peek back stage without it beening assumed we are watching to decide who is the cutest kid in the hall. Finishing it with his eye surgery is Dave's way of letting us know that none of the kids are too big to be small and petty. It is only fair since he made Scott Thompson look a right pratt through the whole thing.",1110153600,3,891,4.180232558139535
7959196,5,B000063K06,"My girlfriend bought me Brain Candy and Tour of Duty for my birthday and I was overwhelmed with joy. I watched Brain Candy about 15 times, and Tour of Duty was outstanding, but I began to get interested in the behind the scenes portion of the tour, so you can imagine how interested i was in the Same Guys New Dresses DVD. I didn't have much money so i waited until Zellars had it on sale for 4.99 (GREAT BARGAIN!) and I rushed home to watch the Kids I love so dearly. I was NOT dissapointed at all. It's a great DVD for the hardcore fans of the series because it captures the side of the kids you just don't see on the show.
Some people have said that the audio is terrible, but i didn't notice one thing wrong with it. It came in crystal clear for me, and besides, it's suppose to be a ROAD MOVIE, not a professionally crafted, fake... thing.
As for the only drawback (which is hardly a drawback), there isn't enough of my favourite kid, Brucio.",1104364800,2,947,4.208791208791209
7959197,2,B000063K06,"I LOVE the Kids, but this dvd is so disappointing! Too much focus on the backstage bickering. Badly filmed, muffled sound. The situations and discussions filmed seemed to make the Kids look like a bunch of whiny babies who don't like each other anymore. I wanted to see more of the stage show, what little was covered of it looked pretty funny.
I guess this is really a look into the reality of the Kids and how they (didn't) get along with each other after working separately for the years after the TV show was over. It just made me sad. I can't wait for the TV shows to all be on DVD--if it isn't in the works then it oughta be.",1071446400,3,631,4.180327868852459
7959198,1,B000063K06,I should have taken heed the other reviews of this dvd. Not only is it boring as all but the dialogue is barely audible. It is basically someone with a handicam following the Kids around - who knew it would be so darn boring. The biggest thing that bugs me is that you can't return dvd's (or software) so you just are stuck with it even though it shouldn't have even been released considering the audio visual. Damn shame.,1060214400,3,422,4.3544303797468356

Far too much time was wasted on Scott's AIBO robotic dog, for example. The Kids rock, but this DVD is comprised primarily of mundane backstage banter instead of their trademark irreverant humor.  Diehard fans will love this, but newcomers should look elsewhere.",1047686400,3,380,5.112903225806452
