When it arrived, watching it confirmed my view that this is one of the most stimulating programs ever. Good to watch again, and again, and with a gap, even again!",1224374400,10,262,4.479166666666667
3145719,5,B0015LPRPG,"This DVD is a ""must have"". The inclusion of historical footage tracing the widespread use of ice, on through to the search for how low can you get, and the subsequent discoveries which went on to commercial ventures for things we take for granted, is both facinating and educational. The patience of the scientific community never ceases to amaze, in the quest for the truth about the world we live in. Congratulations to the production team that put it all together in this DVD.

3145720,5,B0015LPRPG,"This is a wonderfully put together documentary, my 11 year son was captivated with interest. The re-enactments are excellent. There are two distint films here, the first was the best for me as towards the end of the second it seemed to get a little mundane as scientists were spending a fortune to get just one ten millionth lower.
Definately worth adding to any good documentary collection.",1215129600,16,391,4.850746268656716
3145721,5,B0015LPRPG,"This documentary was originally created and broadcast by the BBC and then NOVA purchased it for U.S. Public Television. However, NOVA cut about 14 minutes of footage to include plugs for other NOVA programs.  I am hoping this DVD release will put that time back.

This program traces the scientific evolution of the search for absolute zero, from the 17th century through today.  It is extremely well done.  Like many such programs, it takes high concept science (in this case physics) and brings it to the people.  There are reenactments, interviews with experts in the field, and historical footage.  The rivalries between past scientists, and the repercussions of such, are frankly examined.  The creators did a superb job making the topic approachable without condescending to a non-scientist audience.  For the first time, I was able to grasp such concepts as the Bose-Einstein Condensate, absolute zero and how lasers can ""cool"" atoms.  I work at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, where Eric Cornell did his Nobel Prize-winning work (at Jilla).  He is featured in the documentary and easily expresses in layman's terms the ideas and methods his team used.  There is some humor throughout the piece (including how he forgot to bow to the king while accepting his Nobel Prize!) to lighten the subject matter.  Just recently NIST hosted a lecture with Russell Donnelly, the physicist who helped spearhead this documentary.  He worked in cold temperature physics, and was asked for input to the book ""Absolute Zero and the Conquest of Cold.""  When he looked through the book he was dismayed to see no graphs, or photos or any ""science.""  But once he started reading, he was amazed at how the author told the story of the science through the lives of the scientistis.  He realized it would make a great documentary that could reach out to the public - whose support helps keep funding for such endeavors.  He also spoke about the extensive process of requesting a grant from NSF, working with the BBC and then NOVA to put this together.  He showed footage from the documetary itself and I was amazed at the quality.  Unfortunately, when NOVA broadcast the show in January it went up against the New Hampshire primary and then the American Idol premier.  Yet, it still managed to draw millions of viewers. I am glad they are releasing it on DVD.  I would love to rewatch it, and have the ability to rewind certain points that I may have missed.

Overall, I highly recommend this program to everyone.  It would be a great tool for high school science teachers, for fans of Carl Sagan's ""Cosmos,"" and of The National Geographic Channel and other such venues.",1208908800,44,2674,4.880266075388026

3145740,5,B0015LPRPG,"This DVD explains scientists' research and efforts for the past 150 years to achieve the coldest temperature possible. It is very informative and interesting. Even though there is no limit for hot temperatures, theoretically the coldest temperature possible according to the physics and chemistry laws we know today is negative 273 degrees Celcius, called absolute zero, the title of the documentary. It has not yet been reached. The documentary shows in a historical perspective how scientists gradually came very close to absolute zero in laboratory experiments cooling first hydrogen then helium to liquid states at temperatures a little above absolute zero. In the universe absolute zero ( negative 273 degrees Celcius ) has not yet been discovered occuring naturally. It has to be created in a laboratory environment. Only a few years ago scientists have come one billionth of a degree close to absolute zero using laser technology to slow down the movement of atoms and cool them down to almost absolute zero. For more than a century scientists have been competing or cooperating to reach this ultimate low temperature.

Why ? What is the big deal in achieving the coldest temperature possible ? The documentary explains to us that until 100 years ago we had no technology to keep our foods cool nor to cool down in summer. Refrigerators and air conditioners are a product of the technology of the cold. There are even more exciting inventions to be made when mankind succeeds to create even colder temperatures. The documentary explains that we generally learn that matter has three states : solid, liquid and gas. However, when temperatures only a billionth of a degree above absolute zero are created in a laboratory environment scientists have observed in recent years that matter turns into a 4th state that is neither solid nor liquid nor gas. Because at such low temperatures the atoms come very close to a motionless state. According to the documentary this discovery promises the development of quantum computers based on the technology of the very cold. Such computers will be much more powerful than the most advanced electronic computers of today and will work with a method different than the binary digital system of the current computers.

Also using laser technology to slow down the atoms scientists have been able to slow the speed of light from the 186 thousand miles per second to the speed of a bicycle.",1237593600,20,2430,5.04228855721393

8259030,5,B0015LPRPG,"Another great program by Nova, this one covers a much underrated scientific topic:  the study of cold; how we've learned to harness and use it and how science is probing it all the way down to the bottom -- absolute zero.

It is actually a 2-parter from Nova, the first being the history of cold from the early 17th C. to the end of the 19th Century.  It covers the earliest experiments, the belief that heat (the lack of cold!) was an actual substance, how that was proven wrong over several generations and shown to be the energy of motion.  It also covers the first harnessing of cold -- by chopping ice out of lakes and ponds and shipping it to places and people who needed to keep things cold.

The 2nd program takes up the cause around 1890 when it had been shown that there was a limit to cold, unlike the open-ended lack of a limit to higher temperatures.  The race was between two Victorian scientists, James Dewar a Scotsman working in London and Kammerlingh Onnes, a Dutchman.  It was not easy for them to cool things, and they managed it by cooling gases until they liquefied, then using that to cool something with a lower condensation temperature as they got closer and closer to absolute zero.

It's quite a tale and well worth the watching.  It's not as easy to understand what they cover next -- cooling things to the point that they form a Bose-Einstein condensate -- but Nova does a good job.  The Bose-Einstein condensate makes matter act in very strange ways, taking on the hard to understand behaviors of individual atoms, quantum mechanics

But they explain and show it better than I can tell it.  I highly recommend this Nova double episode.  It's based on a book by Tom Shachtman of the same name and I have found that it makes me want to look up some of the things covered and learn just a little bit more.",1471132800,,1832,4.449101796407185
