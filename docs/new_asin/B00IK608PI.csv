8642940,5,B00IK608PI,I LOVE this show!!!  Excellent TV cop drama that moves at a calmer pace because it takes place in the south and I like that!  Reminds me of better times when I would watch this show first run with my mom.  She's gone now so these shows bring her back to me.,1530748800,,257,3.9038461538461537
8642941,4,B00IK608PI,I love this show very much what I am finding out though is it is not the complete seasons. There episodes missing from the sets so that is a little downing. And the sets also freeze up every once in awhile on some of the shows.,1513382400,2,227,3.9565217391304346

8642944,2,B00IK608PI,"The DVD's freeze up and won't play, new out of the box.  Don't buy!",1425859200,,67,3.7857142857142856
8642945,1,B00IK608PI,"""In the Heat of the Night"" was one of my favorite television shows. I am so disappointed that whoever is producing these DVDs is not giving us the entire, complete television series. I would buy every Season! But I do not want an incomplete set and this is why I am rating this with a *1* star. The show itself I would rate *5* stars!!

Looking at the episodes that are listed in this volume and their corresponding episode numbers are totally WRONG!! The episodes included in this set are Episodes 3 through 13 and 15 of Season Four. Missing episodes from Season 4 are Brotherly Love (Episodes 1 & 2) and Shine on Sparta Moon (Episode 14).",1407456000,3,640,4.423728813559322
8642946,5,B00IK608PI,It was great. We saw episodes we had not been able to find before. Carrol o'Connor is great in his role,1402185600,,103,3.9523809523809526

8642948,2,B00IK608PI,"Did not really care for a lot of the episodes from season four. Also did not include all of season four.
