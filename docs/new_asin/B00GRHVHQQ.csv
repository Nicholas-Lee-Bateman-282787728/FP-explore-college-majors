It makes the video seem more like you are watching something in an icecream parlour or circus. This should be a devotional DVD but unfortunately it is hard to listen to it with that intention. The whole thing is more like a tourist video with bad guitar playing, bagpipes and other badly played instruments throughout. It is also VERY boring with little information. It is just a mess of a video and I wish I could return it for a refund. Such a waste as I was expecting an informational devotional DVD. Do not waste your money on this as I am sure there are much better videos out there.",1444608000,,726,4.385185185185185

8626402,5,B00GRHVHQQ,"In this,the second volume of Religious mysteries, it seems we are made to 'hit the road' in discovering these three documentaries pertaining to Catholic pilgrimage sites; Santiago de Compostela in the documentary entitled 'Road to Compostela', Ephesus , Jerusalem and Loreto in the second documentary 'The Houses of Mary' and finally Fatima, Portugal in the 'Children of the Prophecy'.

All 3 documentaries are very well done, by the same directors, producers and presenters as was in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Religious-Mysteries/dp/B00A9XP2AQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Religious Mysteries</a>, which is an Italian production. However this time the voice-over/dubbing was much better though the narrator at times tended to be a tad monotonous, and pronounced the letter 'J' as an 'H' as is done in Spanish. So Joachim became ""Hoakim' and Jacinta was 'Hacinta'. I guess,in this sense I'm just nitpicking.

Putting that aside, these documentaries are full of very interesting facts and details, as well as being a travelogue of sorts, one is transported to these wonderful, mysterious and blessed places, lands replete with beautiful architecture both of human hands and of Divine (the scenes, and panorama of the countryside is breathtaking!), with the history of these places being an added and necessary bonus, to enrich the knowledge and faith of the viewer. The principal fact that one has to encounter in all these documentaries is this: FAITH; the frail faith of broken humanity seeking to hold the hand of God and of God seeking out mankind to allow it to grow in faith. This is particularly evident in the numerous pilgrims which the viewer will encounter in the course of this DVD.

As mentioned, the 'Road to Compostela' is extremely fascinating. The natural beauty of the Camino, the gorgeous and quaint wayside churches and magnificent cathedrals, and most importantly the interesting local personalities that one would meet along the way, adds a richness to this show, almost transforming it into a luminous tapestry of sorts. From the very devout to the not-so-devout, one sees a transformation, a change that happens in the individual. And yet there is some criticism, when these pilgrims fail to stop and admire the beauty of their surroundings, to contemplate the beauty of God Himself and seem to just want to reach the end. One would feel that, such a pilgrim, would not enjoy the full fruits of his/her pilgrimage. This was by far my most favourite documentary on this DVD.
For another great documentary on the same topic, I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Way-of-Saint-James/dp/B006LSA4OM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Way of Saint James</a>

'The Houses of the Virgin Mary' is great in the sense it exposes us to all 3 sites that is associated with the earthly life of Our Lady. The connections to Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich's visions, the explanations with regard to the sites themselves, their discovery is fascinating and endearing. However my criticism of this documentary is simply one line where credence is taken away from the miraculous transportation of the Holy House of Loreto from Nazareth to Italy (the so called 'Angeli' theory) whereby the transportation was not by angels but by a noble house named 'Angeli' a theory that doesn't hold water when you watch a great documentary entitled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Loreto-The-Mystery-of-The-Holy-House/dp/B005JI0LZ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Loreto: The Mystery of The Holy House</a>.

The final part is ' The Children of Prophecy' on the events of Our Lady's Apparition in Fatima. Do you think you know everything about Fatima? This documentary has a few tidbits that will surprise you as well as showing Sr. Lucia's life in the Carmelite convent in Coimbra, Portugal, where she spent her final years as a cloistered nun, as well as interviews by her fellow sisters and a peek into the convent she called home.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Finding-Fatima/dp/B0041OOW8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Finding Fatima</a>&nbsp;is another great documentary on the same topic.

After having watched this, it would make the viewer want to pack his backpack and hit the pilgrim road!

There is much, much more that one can get from these presentations, than what is recounted here.

All in all a fantastic DVD. Each documentary is 50 minutes long sans subtitles or special features.

Linked here is the first volume to this interesting series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Religious-Mysteries/dp/B00A9XP2AQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Religious Mysteries</a>",1392163200,2,4785,5.923188405797101
