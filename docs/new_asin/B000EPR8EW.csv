2526815,5,B000EPR8EW,"This is an excellent movie if you don't mind watching a foreign film with subtitles.  It's a story about teenage boys in the Soviet Union who are recruited out of a juvenile detention unit and put in the the military during World War II.  The boys are trained to do a secret mission. Not only do they face the dangers of the training, war, and the upcoming mission, they must also struggle amongst themselves. It's a believable story and one that you must see. I thought all the actors did an exceptionally fine job, especially the young actors.",1190592000,7,545,4.551020408163265
2526816,5,B000EPR8EW,"FANTASTIC! I was expecting a sort of foreign kids Dirty Dozen with wooden acting. The kids were great, the adults were sympathetic, and the action was used only when necessary. This movie has SOUL. I highly recommend this to any WWII History class. The movie would appear to be one of those that could not have been made before the breakup of the Soviet Union because of the digs the movie makes at the failure of the socialist system to give aide to the outcasts of society, as well as the treatment of non-conformists within the adult community. At the same time, it maintains the Russian tradition seen in My Name is Ivan, of glorifying the individual soldier rather than well known heroes. The only drawback is at the end, the voice-overs from the kids were not subtititled. The DVD extras were not subtitiled either but it was interesting watching the boys acting like all boys do while in between shooting scenes.

The movie does not hit you over the head with sentimentality but I found myself crying at the end. Please give this movie a look. You can watch it in horror at the depressing conditions and situations or view it with appreciation at the love and commradary soldiers ultimatly share with one another.",1184371200,53,1220,4.674418604651163
2526817,5,B000EPR8EW,A lot of Russian and Baltic films are cold and barren of creative choices. This film is a wonderful story of loss and hope.,1368144000,,123,4.166666666666667
2526818,5,B000EPR8EW,"This DVD is a historical novel about the tragedies of World War II, in particular in Russia.
675 youngsters were orphaned and left to fend for themselves.  Some became criminals, and to
rectify themselves to the Motherland,ca. 14 - 15 years, were sent to training camps to become
commando teams.  Those teams would not return with a very few exceptions.  There were adult subordinates -
both Russian and German Soldiers - who did not approve of this atrocity.  The DVD poignantly
demonstrates this. It was not just a Jewish Holocaust, or the Hitler Jugend but also the loss
of several Russian youth among others which occurred.  The Russian Producer should be highly
recognized for revealed truths in this DVD.",1364256000,7,710,4.932773109243698

2526820,4,B000EPR8EW,"This is a story of orphan kids-convicted criminals, barely reaching their teen age, surviving hardship of the WWII-devastated USSR/Russia, used to mortally-dangerous military projects by cruel Stalinist commanders, these teens affairs both mutual and with world surrounding.

Cynical, rude, explicitly-machos performance produced talentedly for understanding the original dialogues especially.

2526822,5,B000EPR8EW,"War time: WWII. Russians capture young boys for fatal missions. Difficult to understand why today. The boys are natural, untrained actors. Good performances. Well shot. Difficult to watch sometimes; powerful and dramatic. Not for the queasy
among us; but it happened. What were they thinking? Ultimately they won, but the boys: lost, every one. See it, if you dare. Good transfer to disc. Recommended.",1252713600,10,401,5.28125
2526823,3,B000EPR8EW,"The DVD cover is misleading, all the actors are fully clothed in heavy winter wear 97% of time.  I know this sounds superficial and somewhat deranged; sorry I yam what I yam.  Second the script is really lame, perhaps the sub titles lost a LOT in translation.  I do not get the unexplained fondness the training guards developed for the cadets. They were like Santa Claus giving them extra care and affection. I thought it was going to be a rough ordeal.
The cinematography and acting were good. Storyline is nice but there is nothing original to the ending.
The DVD I got played just fine on my 8 year old Mintek DVD player and I live in the United States.  Captioning the  ' DVD extras' at the end of the movie would have been nice as they may have proved more entertaining than the movie.",1236556800,28,791,4.390410958904109
2526824,2,B000EPR8EW,"It seems that this movie is part of the political culture of todays Russia, namely, of fictious romantisicm and adulation of Russian humanism during bad time- II WW.

Actors, who are supposed to play heros of underage thiefs and killers, look too intelligent for that role. Their trainers seem to humanistic, dialogs too soft and situations too banal, to make the viewer believe that this is about a past reality.",1234828800,,413,4.9
2526825,5,B000EPR8EW,"Why did I find this film to be so touching? Probably one needs to be Russian to find the words. There was some kind of tenderness in the very hard old and young hearts that was for me compelling without being over dramatized. There was a tone of sadness and resignation without asking for pity -- just offering understanding without being preachy.

The basic story has been outlined well by others. Under Stalin during the war street boys who robbed and murdered could be punished as adults and were to be executed. There was a plan to take groups of them and train them for special missions against the Germans. Why such kids? From the subtitles and only one watching I could not be sure, but apparently because they were good at sneaking around and breaking into secure places and were not shy about killing and did not frighten easily.

It was very interesting how things were worked out socially in the training camp among young and old.

The gangster that had been put in charge was a very interesting fellow -- practical? cold-hearted? warm-hearted? sentimental? unsentimental? Clearly a very feeling person, but disciplined at partitioning his feelings.

It was worth watching if only for the beautiful photography of the mountain settings -- again not overdone, but very rich.

Of course the story was remarkable in the sense that one wonders if juvenile criminals were really trained as special soldiers in WWII. That would be fascinating news to me and the possibility drew me to and into the film. I will try to do some research on this general issue, whether or not this particular event actually took place. I pulled some comments off another website that were good leads and will next share them here. [...]

""A ""Hitlerjugend"" kind of story, set in the Soviet Union during the Second World War, based on a fictitious story from the eponymous book by Vladimir Kunin. The Red Army has a gang of juveniles for a clandestine operation against the Nazis. The boys are trained by a dangerous crime lord at a top secret boot camp. They are doomed to die in the mission, or after it, just to keep it a secret.  Written by Steve Shelokhonov""

""Based on a true story of teen criminals in the Soviet Union during World War 2. As alternative to prison they are trained in the mountains of Armenia for a mission in Nazi Germany to blow up an important installation. All but one boy dies. Most die during the rigorous training & some die in Germany. It is still unsure what is exactly true or not according to what faction one speaks with, but surely the fact that at the awards ceremony it was a heated moment amongst believers and non believers that the event ever took place.

2526826,5,B000EPR8EW,"Because if you don't you will miss out on great movies like this.

Being of Russian descent I was curious about this movie. I loved it. Even when the sub-titles were lacking, my poor Russian picked up so many nuances that just can't be translated. There are scenes that are upsetting, and the tone is of infinite sadness of the Russian soul. In spite of that, the movie does not sink into hopelessness. Of course, the ending is unexpected and superb.

This film rings true to all that I know of the Soviets and true to all that I've experienced of the Russian people.",1196985600,28,567,4.4423076923076925

8112579,3,B000EPR8EW,This Russian drama set in WWII chronicles a group of violent delinquent teenage boys who are selected precisely for their anti social qualities and transported a gulag of sorts in Siberia. Once there a group of surprisingly benevolent jailers attempt to train them for a secret mission behind enemy German lines. The character of various buys in the group is revealed for better and for worse. There is plenty of  violence both between the boys and in the course of their training and those that emerge face a serious fate. Why a bunch of teenagers would have chosen instead an elite commando unit is never made clear. Easy to follow even for non Russian speakers and the production values are surprisingly good.,1399248000,,712,4.836065573770492
8112580,4,B000EPR8EW,"One might describe the plot of this movie as a cross between The Dirty Dozen and Operation Crossbow. A major difference is that the protagonists are minors. This is a fresh and refreshing take on a similar plot line the will remind one somewhat of The Hornet's Nest.
Pay attention to the caution before buying this dvd as you will need a player capable of playing a dvd from Europe. Having said that--enjoy! Those interested in the craft of movie making will find the extra from the director fascinating. On a small budget, the director has achieved remarkable effects with no CGI. My only compliant is the extra featuring an interview with the two lead actors is not subtitled in English. The one lead boy is quite animated, and it would have been great fun to know what he was saying.",1393459200,,786,4.581560283687943
