141614,3,0792836618,"What a gyp - ""Mr. Saturday Night"" is supposed to be at least either heartwarming or funny, but is neither.  Billy Crystal is Buddy Young, one of the sort of old time Jewish comics who got his start in the postwar ""borscht belt"".  When the flick opens up, Buddy old yet still going strong - perhaps a bit too strong.  Still playing gigs, it's clear that Buddy has missed out on big success despite a lifetime of hard work.  Record deals and primetime haven't elevated Young to the pantheon of American entertainment like Sid Ceaser or Jerry Lewis.  Instead, he plays rest homes and (when he's lucky) cruise ships.  Though married, Buddy's true companion is his long suffering brother, Stan (David Paymer).  In flashbacks, we learn that Buddy and Stan were originally supposed to have been a team, but Stan backed out at the last minute - leaving Buddy to accept the spotlight.  The attention, which gave Buddy fame at first, only produced resentment later on.  At first a primetime draw, Buddy's show eventually sank in the ratings (Davy Crockett killed him).  A shot at comeback on the Sullivan show turned disastrous - he shared the bill with the Beatles.  Various attempts to cash in on the latest craze each ended in failure (when was the last time you dusted off your LP of ""Disco Jew""?).  Though Buddy seems resolute to go on, each failure erodes a veneer within him, exposing Buddy's nastier side, one that drives away all but his closest relatives, and makes life hell even for them.  Though covering years of Buddy's life in flashback, the plot centers around what may be a new break - when a new agent (Helen Hunt) manages to snag for Buddy a promising role in a movie to be directed by a young Buddy fan (played by Ron Silver).
Ofcourse nothing works out - but that's not the movie's problem.  Instead, the flick pulls strings shamelessly, using the same tricks that made ""A League of their Own"" look contrived and very Hollywood.  Whether the swelling music or the tears, nothing looks real in this movie.  What really kills this flick?  The script plays either very funny or very sad, but forgets (or simply never understood) that real Jewish humor is both at the same time - only wearing different faces, but essentially both heartbreaking and hysterically funny at the same time.  Instead, the flick never manages to reconcile how such a nasty guy can be both funny and mean and just makes him too separate characters - unfortunately, the mean and less entertaining one gets most of the screen time.  If the flick had played it lighter on both counts, it may not have been as funny, but it would have been more poignant and believable.",1021161600,9,2649,4.658064516129032
141615,5,0792836618,"Poignant and moving--a transformational performance by Billy Crystal who gives such a finely nuanced performance of such depth that the movie has stayed with me for years.  This isn't about a comdeian per se, its about somebody who realises that they have just missed the boat, felt that they were naturally entitled to be on the boat, and have to deal with that sense of life's betrayal.  Crystal stops being just a funny man, and shows himself to be deeply sensitive and actually -- very deep.  Disappointed viewers were looking for comic fluff, and when they got a sophisticated performance of a difficult man, they expressed their shock by rating the film badly.",973728000,19,666,4.876106194690266

141635,5,0792836618,"In my top five movies of all time. Brilliantly thought out and sensitively directed by Billy Crystal. The interplay between brothers is believable, and moving. The main character, Buddy Young, is like all the great east-coast comedians of his day rolled into one character. Buddy has his own distinct, abrasive personality, which evokes passion, contempt, and love for humanity--and for his family. Many touching scenes abound, i.e. Buddy's eulogy at his mother's funeral. David Paymer is at the top of his game as Buddy's brother and agent, Stan. I realize it's not for everyone, since it does have that east-coast, Jewish appeal. But for many of us who love the movie and watch it repeatedly, it has a certain cult appeal. So many of the lines i use over and over---and too great effect! Let face it...we could all use BUDDY YOUNG THERAPY from time to time, lol!",1431734400,,864,4.844594594594595

141658,3,0792836618,"Billy Crystal directs himself in this sometimes funny, sometimes sad, most times rather dull account of a washed up comedian's life and his struggle to get back into the swing of things after years of arrogant self-pandering.  I was really interested in where this was going to take me, since I'm a fan of Crystal, but only to a certain degree.  I find that his persona onscreen can become rather limited in range, and he's only a few times given me something I felt was fully fleshed out and complete (my favorite performance from his is easily `When Harry Met Sally') and many times he comes off like Tom Hanks-lite, but I was willing to try this since he was so invested in every aspect of it (writing, directing, starring).  If any vehicle was going to give me the best Crystal had to offer, it was going to be this.

Sadly, his co-star David Paymer wipes the floor with him.

The film tells the life story of a Jewish comedian with a poor attitude and a penchant for racy, edgy and offensive comedy.  He is stubborn and determined, which go hand in hand into making him a star, and a somewhat beloved one at that, but times are hard and age catches up with you and before you know it your career doesn't exist anymore.  Still completely set in his ways, and narrow minded in his self-perception, Buddy cares little for anyone else, including his brother, who just so happens to be the only loyal friend Buddy ever had (even though Buddy walks all over him).

This could have been ripe for true impact, but the scenes get lost in the shoddy editing, and the big moments feel too staged to be anything really moving (although the whole sub-plot with the movie pitch and the heartbreak is rather impressive).  Crystal is one note here, which is sad since his character had so many moments where an arc could have been played.  Paymer is great though, and I'm happy he snagged that Oscar nomination for this.  He said so much with a single glance and gave a three-dimensional heart to an otherwise stagnant picture.",1376006400,3,2016,4.526170798898072

141662,5,0792836618,"Years ago, when I saw Mr. Saturday Night in the theater, I went in expecting an hilarious comedy with Billy Crystal doing his ""thing"" as Buddy Young Jr.. It's NOT a comedy! It's a serious film about a self centered, very bitter man who makes others laugh, but who has no humor in his own life. The acting is extraordinary. David Paymer, who plays the role of Stan, Buddy's brother, is simply amazing in his role and should have won an Oscar. It really is a lesson in life. As Stan says to Buddy, at film's end, as he announces that he's leaving as Buddy's manager, ""You could have been nicer.""

If you're looking for a video that really makes you laugh, move on, quickly. To see splendid acting and characterization; Billy Crystal, at his best, buy a copy and watch it a couple of times.",1346457600,,787,4.390410958904109
141663,4,0792836618,"A great story about the relationship between two brothers.  Billy Crystal is Mr. Saturday Night...or at least was.  He can't seem to accept the fact that although still funny, his time in the spotlight has long-passed and although he can still book gigs, they're not at the lavish clubs he had become accustomed to.  He becomes bitter and hostile to those who love him most...his daughter for one, but even more hurtful and cruel to his manager/agent/biggest fan and only brother. A great portrayal of the ""sad clown.""",1330387200,,518,4.863636363636363

I am sorry, but that is my impression of this film.
The acting is good.
The transformation of Billy Crystal as he ages in the film is amazing.
It is interesting to see how this ""model comedian"" develops.
I  truly believe that this film depicts some well known comedians who are really miserable and insulting people at heart.

141679,4,0792836618,"Billy Crystal stars as an aging stand-up comic (Buddy Young, Jr.) with a mean streak in him. The movie starts off slowly and seemingly predictably, with Crystal and his brother (played by David Paymer) doing comedy together in their Jewish living room to all the relatives, getting some early breaks, and heading up the showbiz ladder. But Paymer opts out of the routine and becomes Cyrstal's manager. After many years and now on the decline, they have a falling out, but reconcile at the end. Comedians have enormous egos, and Crystal as Buddy wouldn't think twice about putting someone down for a laugh. (I've heard the same thing said about the real life Groucho Marx, whose insults directed as his family were funny to everyone except his family. But he didn't care as long as he got a laugh.) He's a funny guy, Buddy is, but not a nice one. The second half of the movie is much better than the first. Humor is in the mind of the beholder (sort of like beauty), and I thought the jokes were mildly funny. It certainly is not the worst movie ever made as some reviewers here seem to think.",1146700800,2,1092,4.52020202020202

141682,5,0792836618,"I have always felt Billy Crystal was a self absorbed, ruthless, know it all, Borcht belt brat, ego maniac! So when this movie was conceived (as a vehicle for Crystal) I thought it was merely an attempt to convince us that he himself was a showbiz legend. You know.....so he could show up at the Friars club and get respect from some former comedians who make cameo appearances in this flick. Greats like Slappy White, Carl Ballantine, Will Jordan, Jackie Gayle, and the master himself.....Jerry Lewis. Well.....I hate to say this.....but I now believe that I was wrong. I have since found Billy to indeed be a Showbiz legend! I now put him not only equal to but above many of the greats. I mean he's right up there with Lewis, Jack Benny, and George Burns. He turns in a great effort here as the abrasive, controlling, manipulative and unlovable Buddy Young. But the icing on the cake on why I changed my mind was the solid writing and unselfish way Crystal so generously gives David Payner this movie. It is for that reason and Payner's rock solid performance as the long suffering brother that make this Showbiz yarn a must see for any and all people who ever dreamed of being a standup comedian. This movie peels away and exposes the underlying current as to what makes a man bulldoze anybody who get's in his way from being a star. It's at times crass and vulgar but then that's who Buddy Young is. An underrated masterful little gem from one of the greatest entertainers today.....my ""new"" favorite comedian. Mr. Saturday Night.....the one and only.....Billy Crystal. He deserves all the accolades bestowed upon him. He truly is the greatest that we have today!",1122940800,7,1666,4.689419795221843

Buddy is a brilliant comedian who, like Jerry Lewis, Buddy Hackett, and countless other comics jumps from the Catskills and Vegas to one of television's highest rated shows.
