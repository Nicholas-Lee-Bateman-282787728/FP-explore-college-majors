8219592,4,B000VQQJA8,"I was surprised to learn that the obscure band Goddo had an own DVD with a liveconcert. I have listened to their double-album ""Live Best Seat in the House"" many times and was pleased that this is recently available on CD too (with 4 extra tracks, they are great too, although it takes an other listen tot appreciate them), but that was the only thing I knew about this group. Suddenly I became beware that there is also this DVD. Well, I liked it from the beginning, having listened to the live CD a couple of times and although in other order and not with al the songs from that album, it adds certainly to a bigger appreciation. The band performed very well, being a powe trio, with instrumentchanges, the singer/bassplayer takes over on leadguitar whereas the leadguitarist plays bass (which they do in concert and in the studio). Furthermore some musicians turn up on saxes and in one song Grog Goddovitz plays a ballad behind the piano. All in all this is nice to watch. I can recommend it to anyone who likes an honest and true concert. At least the band had its fun and now the onlooker may share the same expierence. Very nice.",1218067200,,1135,4.48792270531401
