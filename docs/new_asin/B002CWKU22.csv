8364602,5,B002CWKU22,Got it quick and love Pam Grier. Loved the throwback movie and seeing Pam Grier in her beginning roles! Hotness and raw content would be the two words I'd use to cover Coffy.,1364515200,,174,4.303030303030303
8364603,2,B002CWKU22,"Don't let the nice new cover art fool you, these SOUL CINEMA DOUBLE-FEATURES are nothing but the old non-anamorphic 2001 MGM dvds placed in a 2-cd case with the new front-cover art literally GLUED on top of the case. They didn't even bother to slip it under the clear plastic sleeve. I've bought hundreds of dvds over the years, but I've never seen packaging quite this lazy. The movies are still entertaining, but this reissue is very disappointing.",1265846400,13,450,4.782051282051282
