8009698,3,B0001BKALC,I found this Documentary to be a little boring. This information on this DVD has already been talked about in other special features & there was nothing new here.,1488758400,,162,4.620689655172414
8009699,3,B0001BKALC,"Not a bad value for less than 5 bucks, but I agree with some of the other posters here that this doc should have been an extra on a Blu Ray of one of his movies.  Good selection of interviews of actors and behind the scenes technical folks.  And the man himself.  The only annoyance is the preponderance of time given to a talking head interview with some 20-something no-name fanboy/critic.  Also, the structure of this thing is pretty haphazard, starting well with a lot of coverage of his early movies--then racing to the finish line with his late nineties stuff.",1483401600,,566,4.574257425742574
8009700,5,B0001BKALC,John Carpenter is the best. I enjoyed this DVD very much.,1470096000,,57,4.2727272727272725

8009702,5,B0001BKALC,I really enjoyed watching this dvd. I wasn't sure if it was going to have a lot of information since it didn't seem that long. It did contain enough for me to say it was well worth the money. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed his movies and I own everyone of his movies that he directed.,1329436800,3,298,4.067796610169491
8009703,5,B0001BKALC,"Great documentary for true Carpenter fans.  No extras and only an hour long, but you learn a lot about Carpenter's roots and Greg Nicotero's comments on ""The Thing"" are very interesting.  Highly recommended.",1272931200,,207,5.242424242424242
8009704,4,B0001BKALC,"John Carpenter: The man who brought you ""Halloween,"" Escape from New York""
& more! This dvd that has everything you want to know about the famous
director with many cast & crew interviews. I'm a big fan and own just
about all of his films. I recommend this good dvd.",1271894400,,266,4.34
8009705,3,B0001BKALC,"It doesn't tell anything new to a Carpenter fan, but it is nice to see an hour on him. It isn't really worth putting it out on dvd, though. It should be an extra on some Carpenter DVD.",1178668800,,184,3.8684210526315788
8009706,5,B0001BKALC,"PICTURE QUALITY (5/5 STARS)
The interviews and film scenes are excellent quality, some film clips seem to be better on this DVD than on the movie DVDs!
SOUND QUALITY (5/5 STARS)
No surround of course, flawless Stereo sound.
EXTRAS (1/5 STARS)
No extras on this interview DVD - excusable as this whole DVD is some kind of an extra.
SPECIAL/UNIQUE ON THIS DVD RELEASE:
- anamorphic Widescreen
- Dolby Stereo
- up to now singularly contribution DVD to John Carpenter
COMMENT:
I've waited so long for a J.C. DVD (like the ""The Director"" series) and here it is - at least a beginning because it is quiet short. 60 minutes of footage in one big clip with chapters - each for one film. Most of his films are treated well on this DVD. Especially his earlier years as film-/musicmaker and his youth is analyzed.
The mixture of interviews with J.C., actors, Alan Howarth (!) and clips from the films works very well. 50 minutes or so are very detailed but at the end it starts to get hurried and it may be that there will be another DVD like this because some important movies have not been mentioned (see below) and there could have been much more information about his later movies.
This release has a wide opened end - like telling 50 % and then ""cut""... nevertheless highly enjoyable, informative and a must-have for every fan - priceless!!
