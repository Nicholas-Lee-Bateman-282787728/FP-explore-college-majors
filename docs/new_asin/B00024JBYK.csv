8022069,5,B00024JBYK,"My kids (2 and 3 years old) are obsessed with ""the bears."" They have never been interested in watching TV (they like Sesame Street, but barely watch it while it's on), but they LOVE this.",1315526400,,187,4.371428571428571
8022070,5,B00024JBYK,"I bought this DVD two years ago when my oldest was 3 years old and about to start preschool.  She watched it over & over, and I think it helped her get more comfortable with the idea of what happens at school.  The kids in the video paint, play, listen to stories, plant seeds, etc.  It's definitely worth it if you have a cautious kid like mine!

Since that time, we've watched it now & then, and both my now 5-year old and my 3-year old find it really entertaining.  So I recommend it despite the fact that it is a bit cheesy -- the Buddy Bear character is some short person wearing a bear costume.  And not a cutesy bear costume -- a lifelike one!  Funny.  But the kids don't even see that, oddly enough.  Which is ok, because in the end, it does what it's supposed to do - get kids ready for school!",1311811200,2,803,4.096153846153846
8022071,5,B00024JBYK,"This DVD was a great tool to offer our son a way to see that other kids have similar experiences, questions, and fears when starting preschool.  It also seemed to bring out a sense of pride for his own school.  It was remarkable how much he tuned into the similaries and differences between Buddy Bear's school and his own.  We also bought the book ""I love you all day"" about a mommy giving her son the reassurance that she loves him when they are together and also when they are apart (and he is at school).  Each were great! Good luck. The best advice we got was 1) make sure your kid knows you think his school is a great and that you want him to be there and 2) try dropping off and setting short goals: I will come back for snack (30 minutes) then leave again and come back for Yard...etc.",1137196800,4,794,4.169934640522876
8022072,5,B00024JBYK,My kids can't get enough of this DVD.  They always want to watch it before going to daycare in the morning and ask to see it before going to sleep.  A must for all parents.,1092960000,3,172,3.8857142857142857
