7266970,5,B00YT9IT2Y,"Note:  this review is for the Shout Factory! packaging and presentation, which I own and have viewed.  I also own the previous Rhino edition.  The purpose of this review is to highlight the differences between the two, so that prospective purchasers can assess if they wish to purchase this edition if they already own the previous one.

Why Study The Industrial Arts...or rather, why purchase an MST3K set that is almost a decade old?  The very idea would seem bizarre to most people, except dedicated fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000.

While we don't get the unriffed versions this time around, there are some features that are compelling enough for fans to consider purchasing.  There are new features about the filmmakers and distributors, ""The Crown Jewels"" and ""The Creep Behind The Camera.""  I'm more interested in featurettes about the MST3K episodes, but the story behind the making of ""The Creeping Terror"" is interesting enough to warrant a look.  There is also a featurette with Trace and Frank,  and trailers, so in my view there is a reason to purchase a second volume.

The previous edition has better packaging (the new one is basically a clamshell, and as noted previously the unriffed versions of the films, so perhaps both are worth keeping on the shelf.)

It seems like a small thing, but the new version includes the bumpers between commercial breaks.  This is not important to the casual viewer, but is a deal-maker for the fans.  None of the films included in this set have a ""title card,"", these were only included in season 4 and part of season 5.  I have included a screen shot below.

In the future, it might be nice to include the Brains-produced promos introducing the next week's episode.  But, I truly appreciated this re-release and hope that other out-of-print volumes from the previous publisher might find their way into Shout Factory's hands.",1438300800,15,1882,4.886435331230284
7266971,5,B00YT9IT2Y,"What they should really do is start releasing them in order of movies they have rights to. This is especially important when you get to season 8, and there's an actual story line.",1436400000,4,179,4.454545454545454
7266972,5,B00YT9IT2Y,"The extras may determine whether or not MSTies who already own the Rhino set (from 2002) will want to buy the same thing twice, so let's clarify what's new to the Shout! Factory re-release:

-- The bumpers and stingers omitted from the Rhino release.

-- ""The Crown Jewels,"" a featurette on Crown International Pictures.

-- An extended trailer for Pete Schuermann's feature, ""The Creep Behind the Camera"" (2014), the fictionalized story of actor/filmmaker/con man Vic Savage, aka A.J. Nelson, and the making of ""The Creeping Terror.""

-- Frank Coniff and Trace Beaulieu Q&A on ""The Creep Behind the Camera"" at Screamfest 2014

-- Theatrical trailer for ""The Creeping Terror""

-- Improved audio and video transfers over the Rhino set (?).

We don't get the unriffed versions of the features this time around, but does anyone really want to watch them that way? By the way, if you haven't yet seen ""The Creeping Terror,"" it's a terrible micro-budget 1964 movie produced, directed, and edited by its lead actor, Vic Savage, and it reaches depths of incoherence, cheapness, and cinematic incompetence worthy of Ed Wood. It's so unintentionally hilarious that it barely needs the MST3K treatment, but I'm happy to have it; Mike and the 'bots hit this one out of the ballpark with one of the show's funniest barrages of riffs, ever, and that's while barely acknowledging the director's undisguised foot and leg fetishism. This is an episode for the ages.

As for the other episodes, ""The Skydivers"" (1963), the second film in the infamous Coleman Francis trilogy, is a bizarre melodrama about an extramarital affair that leads to murder, without anything actually happening onscreen. Like ""The Creeping Terror,"" it's a Mike-era masterpiece of savage riffing, but ""Skydivers"" reminds me more of a Daniel Clowes fever dream than of anything else in the history of cinema. It's unwatchable, but unmissable.

After that, the Joel-era episode ""Catalina Caper"" (1967) and season six's ""Bloodlust!"" (1959) are disappointing by comparison. ""Catalina Caper"" is a beach party crime comedy with the anodyne Tommy Kirk, a musical number by a high-as-a-kite Little Richard, and the unfunny pratfalls of Robert Donner and Jim Begg.

""Bloodlust!"" (1961) has Shaggy, Fred, Daphne, and Velma in a ridiculous version of ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" which explains everything. It substitutes shock effects (boiled heads, etc.) for suspense, features future Brady Bunch star Robert Reed squeezed into a skintight T-shirt, and has a Vincent Price knockoff as the maniacal hunter. Interesting that Crow's wisecrack ""Scooby-Doo, the Movie"" was both accurate and prescient, 'cause just a few years later...

This disc's short is a considerable improvement. Two city kids enjoy a working vacation on ""Uncle Jim's Dairy Farm,"" which Mike and the 'bots rip to shreds, of course, in one of the funniest shorts in the show's entire run.",1433980800,59,2900,5.201716738197425
7266973,5,B00YT9IT2Y,"This is a great set with a wide variety of film genres getting the MST3K treatment. It features four episodes from the Comedy Central era of the show, one hosted by show creator Joel Hodgson and three hosted by head writer Mike Nelson. This collection was originally published by Rhino back in 2006, but it has been out of print for some time. This nice new reissue from Shout! Factory has all new extra features which I've listed below.

Catalina Caper, episode 204
This color film from 1967 is a lighthearted Tommy Kirk beach romp with quite a lot of intentional humor. Lyle Waggoner (The Carol Burnett Show) also appears. There are a few musical numbers in the film, some from well known acts including Little Richard and The Cascades, though these are clearly recorded separately to the lip-synching in the film. A young man's scheming parents are part of an art heist in one plot while another plot involves Tommy Kirk's character rescuing a pretty girl from her nasty criminal boyfriend (Waggoner). There's lots of campy gags and slapstick interspersed with beach scenes and the musical numbers. Also titled, Never Steal Anything Wet, it's light fare that works extremely well in this early season 2 Mystery Science Theater experiment. This is a real classic with Tom Servo singing ""Creepy Girl"" during one host segment. Don't miss it!

The Creeping Terror, episode 606
This 1964 black-and-white film is possibly the worst and lowest budget monster-on-the-loose picture ever made. I saw it on UHF TV many years before it was on MST3K and that was my immediate reaction to it and all these years later I believe it's still a contender for one of the worst, most incompetent films ever. That of course, is wherein lies its charm. The monster looks like a walking carpet remnant and much of the dialog was never dubbed in and cheap narration was used in its place most likely to save time and money. The acting is amateurish at best. The extreme incompetence makes for a really fun episode.

Bloodlust, episode 607
This 1961 black-and-white film starring Robert Reed (The Brady Bunch TV show) is a gruesome and drab remake of the Most Dangerous Game. Some young people out for some boating fun get stranded on an island owned by a rich man who hunts people for sport. The vacationers try desperately not to end up as stuffed trophies in the rich fellow's collection. There are somewhat gruesome taxidermy preparation scenes in this, perhaps a bit nastier than most of the material usually seen on MST3K. It's certainly quite different than most of the other films used on the show.

The Skydivers, episode 609
This 1963 black-and-white film is a Coleman Francis (doesn't that say it all?) drama involving some skydivers, a love-triangle gone awry and lots of cups of coffee from the same guy who brought us Beast of Yucca Flats, a film often cited as the worst movie ever made. Skydivers has terrible dialogue, acting and direction like all Coleman Francis films. In fact, everything about it is dull and poorly done with one notable exception, the music performed by Jimmy Bryant's trio during a dance scene at an airport. This is another film that's so bad and so odd that it's fun in a weird sort of way.

This is a great selection for both the long-term MST3K fan or someone just wanting to check out the show the first time. Catalina Caper is worth it alone, as this comes from the legendarily hilarious second season of the show; when you hear Tom Servo singing ""Creepy Girl"" you'll know why MST3K is possibly the funniest show ever to be on television. This set of previously released episodes also has a much lower list price than new 4-disc sets usually do so even if  you already own the original Rhino version it might be tempting to buy this to see the new extra features.

The Creeping Terror is a classic.  Any monster that the victim has to crawl in, is a great monster.

Skydivers - a truly dreadful movie.

Bloodlust! - You know, I don't think they make a single Brady Bunch reference....

Catalina Caper feels like a make for TV movie.  The least bad of the bunch.  It's odd that I put Mike movies up over a Joel, but this is one.

7267032,5,B00YT9IT2Y,"Shout Factory's release of ""The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Collection"" volume one is a great set featuring three classic episodes and ""Bloodlust"". Three of the shows are Mike Nelson episodes, while Joel Hodgson is at the helm for the viewer favorite ""Catalina Caper"". This is a strong outing overall, though ""Bloodlust"" is (yet another) ""Most Dangerous Game"" knockoff that despite great riffing never fails to bore (although Robert Reed as the hero gets some laughs).

""Catalina Caper"" is not one of my favorite films, but has great jokes. I tend to like the ridiculous sci-fi films the most, but despite that the hilarious presence of Little Richard and Tommy Kirk in a light comedy-mystery-action picture about a ridiculous theft and parental scamming makes for mirthful mayhem. ""The Skydivers"" is a classic featuring some of the worst acting in the history of MST3K, mostly from Tony Cardoza, the auteur and star of the show. It's essentially a love triangle meets freefalling odyssey type of film (in a genre of one, I believe) that has the same high production values as ""Red Zone Cuba"", also starring Cardoza in another incoherent film featuring small planes. I actually think ""Red Zone Cuba"" is the better of the two movies, but you should check out both in their MST3K guise and compare for yourself.

Finally, this set features one of my favorites, ""The Creeping Terror"", the infamous giant carpet monster from space movie starring, directed, and produced by antisocial misfit Vic Savage (A. J. Nelson) at the Spahn Ranch (you know, where the Manson Family lived....) ""The Creeping Terror"" is an amazing film in any context: wholly narrated with some badly looped dialogue, terrible monsters and sets, and acting that would make Harold P. Warren blanch. It is absolutely perfect MST3K fodder and is worth the price of the set by itself.

These four films constituted the original Rhino volume one box set years ago, so if you own that you have to ask yourself if this release is worth it for the special features alone, and in my case the answer was yes, particularly for ""The Creeping Terror"" DVD. This set includes theatrical trailers and a few other extras (though not as lavishly done as the sets originally released by Shout Factory), most interestingly a question and answer session with Trace and Frank and the filmmakers of ""The Creep Behind the Camera"" at ""Screamfest"", a documentary reenactment detailing the background to and making of ""The Creeping Terror"". It is a very revealing and somewhat disturbing session and definitely made me seek out the documentary for further viewing.

If you already own the Rhino MST3K volume one and don't really care about extras, you can skip this set, but if you like the extras and particularly if you want to see some amazing discussion on one of the most infamous bad movies in history, this set is totally worth the price. I highly recommend it.",1441929600,10,2908,4.928571428571429
7267033,4,B00YT9IT2Y,"As somebody who actually received this DVD set yesterday, I thought I would throw in a review. I'm not going to review the content. It's MST3K. If you're interested in this then you know what it is and you already love it.

The real question is, should you buy it again? I had the original version that was released way back when but it was lost in a move along with some of the other early MST3K Rhino sets. For me, buying the rerelease was a no brainer purchase and I'm glad Shout Factory is making these episodes available. I hope they release the other Rhino sets as well, but not in this format.

The problem I have is the packaging. You may have noticed that this set is a little bit cheaper than the other MST3K sets. There's a reason. This really looks and feels like a 'budget' product. There isn't a slipcase. The movies aren't in individual cases with artwork and mini posters. Everything is in one of those cheap plastic clamshell cases. The DVD menus are new but even they feel cheap compared to their usual releases. They don't have the usual skits crafted out of clips of the movies, they just feature animated backgrounds. Yes, there are actual extras on some of the discs but they aren't the usual extensive documentaries that we've gotten used to with Shout Factory. I haven't watched all of them yet but so far I'm not impressed.

Should you buy MST3K Volume 1 again if you already have the original Rhino set? Nope, not in my opinion.

Shout Factory, I love you people, you put out some fantastic DVDs and blu-rays. But this budget product is unnecessary. You're dealing with lovers of cult movies and TV. I would have gladly paid the regular price for a DVD set with the same quality as your other MST3K releases and I'm sure I'm not alone in that. This feels like it should be in a Wal-Mart bargain bin with seasons of 'Everybody Loves Raymond'.",1441152000,9,1867,4.4662756598240465

CATALINA CAPER is a very silly beach flick that should never have been made except to riff off all the beach-party and international-intrigue movies being made at the time.  CREEPING TERROR:  classic creature feature as the title implies.  BLOODLUST -- my favorite -- features a young Robert Reed as one of a crew of privileged yacht-niks who wash up on a beach terrorized by a depraved professor type.  THE SKYDIVERS  -- hilariously inane.
