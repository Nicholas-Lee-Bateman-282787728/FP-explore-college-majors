3121782,2,B00141VKFI,"First movie ""Apocalypse"" was a wash out.  Story line was weak and special effects were terrible.  Second movie on disc was better, except for the constant jerkyness of the camera which I found very annoying. The story line was much better and had moments of emotional substance which came across in a dramatic way.",1231286400,,314,4.796296296296297

I'm the type of person who likes almost every movie out there. Hence why I still gave it 2 stars. I recognized some of the actors in the film and that helped the movie out a little at least. Even for a made-for-tv movie I'd say it wasn't that good. It started out really slow and we kept debating wether or not we even wanted to continue on watching it. But we did, and it got a little better as the movie progressed. I doubt I'll ever watch it a second time, but I'm not asking for those 3 hours of my life back either. Needless to say I still haven't watched the second movie ""10.5"", but probably will when I have no more new movies left in the bin to watch.",1229040000,,673,4.022388059701493

3121818,4,B00141VKFI,"I have just bought end of december 2009 on Amazon. France a bluray player. I didn't know if it was free zone for the bluray discs. As for the dvds I'm sure it's not zone free. By ordering on Amazon.com this two bluray pairs , I wanted to get a cheap demo for my newly acquired TVHD and bluray player. I was almost sure that these two mini series were not great works of arts, but I didn't care about it. First : my player can read both of them, and I'm very pleased when on the screen I see the FBI advice! I must confess I don't understand all of the talks in the movies  because there are no subtitles, even English for the hearing impaired, which is very useful for foreigners (for instance, the bluray 'The Ten Commandments""  is very easy to understand). But what is very important in this kind of movies are the CGI effects, so what the actors say ! And my wife who doesn't understand English loves to see these two movies we have not seen in France. As for the bluray pictures, my opinion is that Category 7 is better than Apocalypse 10.5. I only regret that this movie begins with the destruction of the Eiffel Tower in Paris : so my wife and I won't be able any longer to go again to the second story restaurant (the Jules Verne), one of the best in the world ! I regret also that in both movies, Mount Rushmore, we have not yet seen on our trips in the US, is destroyed. It's a pity for the tourism industry of South Dakota(people in North Dakota should not regret I think) My conclusion is that for this moderate price, if you like this kind of movies, you don't lose too much by buying this double bluray discs, and even you learn the existence of the FEMA, I never heard before. A day when you have learned something can be considered a good refund for the small amount of money you gave to Hallmark. But people of Hallmark, next time, try to put at least English subtitles ! Amazon.com, thanks for this bluray demo and the good time spent before the TV screen by both of us.",1269648000,,1987,4.21259842519685
3121819,5,B00141VKFI,"If you have watched the 10.5 movie and wondered what happened, then this is the set for you.  You not only are able to continue with the original movie, same characters, but also with the destruction.  Category 7: is also a good one, a little stretch of the imagination, but still a good one to watch if you are in the ""destructive"" mood.  I know there are a lot of casualities in disasters, but neither of these dwell on them.  the fact that there is a possible solution to the problem is fascinating, and both make you sit up and take a look around you to see if there is anything we can do to prevent any of these things happening.",1264809600,8,634,4.214876033057851
3121820,3,B00141VKFI,"These movies are available as individual Blu-Rays.  This package is a single Blu-Ray case with both discs. I read the other reviews on the individual pages and on this page before writing my own.  On the individual page for 10.5 Apocalypse there are several comments about it not being complete.  This was my original impression until I realized what was happening.  The movie 10.5 is the original and 10.5 Apocalyse is the sequel.  The sequel is completely present.  Category 7 The End of the World is also a sequel to Category 6 Day of Destruction.  The two original movies are available on Amazon in double feature DVD format.  Link: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000LC3IOM  But the originals are not yet out on Blu-Ray.  I bought the DVD of the originals and have posted a review of them.

10.5 Apocalypse in my opinion is the stronger of the two.  It was originally a two part mini-series on NBC.  But it takes place just minutes after the original (which was also a two part mini-series)and has many of the same characters.  No attempt is made to re-introduce us to the characters and if you don't recall the first movie it will seem like you're missing something.  This is not a sequel that can stand alone.  But watch them in sequence and you get a seamless 4 part mini-series.  Considering the second movie which is on this Blu-Ray, the strong cast and good CGI special effects make the film.  The story involves goofy science...worse than even its predecessor.  10.5 Apocalyse is in wide screen (the original 10.0 is not).

Category 7 The End of the World was a two part mini-series on CBS. It is a sequel that can stand on its own two feet.  You won't be lost if you missed Category 6 Day of Destruction.  The main plot involves some of the worse science ever.  It makes Attack of the Crab Monsters seem erudite by comparison.  But the focus is on the subplots and there are so many of them that everbody can find something to like.  It is also why it stands up to multiple viewings, each time you follow another subplot.  I have seen it twice and I still don't know whats going on with those poisonous frogs... maybe I will figure it out on viewing number three.  Or maybe not.

Seriously, I have watched both movies several times and I will probably watch them again sometime.  And that is my definition of a 3 star movie.",1262304000,11,2331,4.56280193236715

We laughed at all the wrong places and had a good time with them and a pizza. If you want serious movie, this is not for you.",1278115200,,325,3.7941176470588234
3356315,4,B00141VKFI,"I have just bought end of december 2009 on Amazon. France a bluray player. I didn't know if it was free zone for the bluray discs. As for the dvds I'm sure it's not zone free. By ordering on Amazon.com this two bluray pairs , I wanted to get a cheap demo for my newly acquired TVHD and bluray player. I was almost sure that these two mini series were not great works of arts, but I didn't care about it. First : my player can read both of them, and I'm very pleased when on the screen I see the FBI advice! I must confess I don't understand all of the talks in the movies  because there are no subtitles, even English for the hearing impaired, which is very useful for foreigners (for instance, the bluray 'The Ten Commandments""  is very easy to understand). But what is very important in this kind of movies are the CGI effects, so what the actors say ! And my wife who doesn't understand English loves to see these two movies we have not seen in France. As for the bluray pictures, my opinion is that Category 7 is better than Apocalypse 10.5. I only regret that this movie begins with the destruction of the Eiffel Tower in Paris : so my wife and I won't be able any longer to go again to the second story restaurant (the Jules Verne), one of the best in the world ! I regret also that in both movies, Mount Rushmore, we have not yet seen on our trips in the US, is destroyed. It's a pity for the tourism industry of South Dakota(people in North Dakota should not regret I think) My conclusion is that for this moderate price, if you like this kind of movies, you don't lose too much by buying this double bluray discs, and even you learn the existence of the FEMA, I never heard before. A day when you have learned something can be considered a good refund for the small amount of money you gave to Hallmark. But people of Hallmark, next time, try to put at least English subtitles ! Amazon.com, thanks for this bluray demo and the good time spent before the TV screen by both of us.",1269648000,,1987,4.21259842519685
3356316,5,B00141VKFI,"If you have watched the 10.5 movie and wondered what happened, then this is the set for you.  You not only are able to continue with the original movie, same characters, but also with the destruction.  Category 7: is also a good one, a little stretch of the imagination, but still a good one to watch if you are in the ""destructive"" mood.  I know there are a lot of casualities in disasters, but neither of these dwell on them.  the fact that there is a possible solution to the problem is fascinating, and both make you sit up and take a look around you to see if there is anything we can do to prevent any of these things happening.",1264809600,8,634,4.214876033057851
3356317,3,B00141VKFI,"These movies are available as individual Blu-Rays.  This package is a single Blu-Ray case with both discs. I read the other reviews on the individual pages and on this page before writing my own.  On the individual page for 10.5 Apocalypse there are several comments about it not being complete.  This was my original impression until I realized what was happening.  The movie 10.5 is the original and 10.5 Apocalyse is the sequel.  The sequel is completely present.  Category 7 The End of the World is also a sequel to Category 6 Day of Destruction.  The two original movies are available on Amazon in double feature DVD format.  Link: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000LC3IOM  But the originals are not yet out on Blu-Ray.  I bought the DVD of the originals and have posted a review of them.

10.5 Apocalypse in my opinion is the stronger of the two.  It was originally a two part mini-series on NBC.  But it takes place just minutes after the original (which was also a two part mini-series)and has many of the same characters.  No attempt is made to re-introduce us to the characters and if you don't recall the first movie it will seem like you're missing something.  This is not a sequel that can stand alone.  But watch them in sequence and you get a seamless 4 part mini-series.  Considering the second movie which is on this Blu-Ray, the strong cast and good CGI special effects make the film.  The story involves goofy science...worse than even its predecessor.  10.5 Apocalyse is in wide screen (the original 10.0 is not).

Category 7 The End of the World was a two part mini-series on CBS. It is a sequel that can stand on its own two feet.  You won't be lost if you missed Category 6 Day of Destruction.  The main plot involves some of the worse science ever.  It makes Attack of the Crab Monsters seem erudite by comparison.  But the focus is on the subplots and there are so many of them that everbody can find something to like.  It is also why it stands up to multiple viewings, each time you follow another subplot.  I have seen it twice and I still don't know whats going on with those poisonous frogs... maybe I will figure it out on viewing number three.  Or maybe not.

Seriously, I have watched both movies several times and I will probably watch them again sometime.  And that is my definition of a 3 star movie.",1262304000,11,2331,4.56280193236715

They put out both of these sequels as well as 10.5 Apocalypse by it's self. I hope that they eventually put both of the first movies on a blu-ray like they did with this set.....as long as the first 10.5 has the commentary like the standard dvd did.",1251417600,,384,4.065789473684211

The zooming in and out is ridiculous. Made it completely unwatchable. Don't let the casting of Beau Bridges and Frank Langella fool you into thinking this is worth any of your precious time. Unless you really NEED to puke. Unwatchable. Twelve bucks flushed. And yes, it is VERY poor quality resolution.",1504828800,,465,4.5476190476190474
