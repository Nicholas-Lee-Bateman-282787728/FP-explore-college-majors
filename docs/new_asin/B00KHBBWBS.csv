6429469,3,B00KHBBWBS,"The movie is fantastic.  Don't get me wrong, it's a five-star Jerry Lewis bash!  However I'm rating the actual Blu-ray copy I have.  This is one of the worse Blurays I've bought.  Most seem like upconverted DVDs, this however is terrible.  Very grainy.  A lot of the background is extremely grainy.  My dvd copy is far superior.  Maybe it's my player, but it just doesn't seem to be a remastered classic.  Maybe the 50th anniversary is better....",1413331200,12,446,4.688311688311688
6429470,5,B00KHBBWBS,"The Nutty Professor is one of Jerry Lewis,s great movies. Jerry Lewis plays Julius F. Kelp a shy Bumbling Chemistry teacher. Stella Stevens plays Stella Purdy a student in professor Kelp,s chemistry class. Professor Kelp gets bullied by one of his big students. Then he tries the gym to bulk up that does not work. Then he tries chemistry to fix his problem. Than he makes a formula that turns him into Buddy Love. Buddy gets close to Stella but unfortunately the potion,s formula is unstable and Buddy Keeps slipping back into Professor Kelp at the most embarrassing moments.

6429474,5,B00KHBBWBS,"Before Eddie Murphy played the role, Jerry Lewis perfected it. If you loved Murphy in ""The Nutty Professor,"" you'll love the original.

Is this a guy movie or a chick flick?

Imagine doling out a few dollars to take your best gal to a Saturday picture in 1963, and Jerry Lewis was the star. It is a guy's movie, right? It has slapstick, womanizing, and even good music. Certainly a guy would love this, but could a woman? Since when is Jerry Lewis known for making a chick flick? Yes! The underlying tale may be a complex discussion of genetic manipulation, but the main story is love.

As stereotypical guy movies and chick flicks tend to be more accepted by the other gender than we prefer sometimes to admit, ""The Nutty Professor"" has it all.

Can awkward scientist Professor Julius Kelp woo his student, the charming and beautiful Stella Purdy (played by Donna Reed look-alike and Playboy model Stella Stevens)? What about the man of every hour, Buddy Love, Kelp's chemically discovered alter-ego? Who will Stella love?

Problems ensue when Kelp's bird eats the formula for the Kelp-Love transformation. His parents have a copy, but will there be enough for Kelp to become Love for his big moment performing on stage.

Lewis does a fine job holding down both roles. Stevens never steals the show. Even though someone like her being smitten by Professor Kelp is hard to swallow, she never camps it up to ruin the fantasy.

Trivia bit:

Professor John Frink, the Hank Azaria character on TV's ""The Simpsons"" is based on Lewis' Kelp.

I fully recommend ""The Nutty Professor.""

6429476,5,B00KHBBWBS,"""The Nutty Professor"" is America's favourite clown Jerry Lewis at his best!  This screwball take on ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde"" literally shows a grown-up side hidden within the once boy-mannish Lewis that literally helped him start to shed his juvenile self and really display a more adult persona that despite Lewis' claims to the contrary could have just as easily been ex-comedy partner Dean Martin!  Oh, and this is an all-too rare awesome blend of screwball comedy and science fiction.  So why not enroll yourself on BluRay and take some laugh-filled notes from ""The Nutty Professor""?  There ar smarts in every laugh!",1490745600,,620,4.990291262135922

I love the Eddie Murphy remake of this film, but this original is easily just as good. Murphy's film did not improve upon the original in any way, it just gave a different approach to it. For anyone who enjoys the Eddie Murphy film, you MUST see this too.",1451433600,,518,4.51063829787234

8658981,5,B00KHBBWBS,"16th March 1926 - 20th August 2017.
Professor Julius F Kelp(Jerry Lewis) teaches chemistry at college, he's prone to, lets say, accidents.
He's shy, lacks confidence and is often at the wrong end of ridicule, the more 'butch' students even
bully him from time to time, only 'Stella' (Stella Stevens) appears respectful toward him.
Of course a girl like that wouldn't give this bumbling excuse for a man a second look in romantic terms.
He grows weary of his predicament and has for some time been working on a formula to improve his
persona, he feels the time is right to give his formula a go.
The formula gives him a completely new image, he becomes confident suave and super-cool, somewhat
over the top and irritating in truth, at the local dance hall he takes over the music group performing and
at the piano starts singing, well, he wows the audience.
Getting the dosage level right becomes a problem, he'd singled out 'Stella' as a romantic target, on their
sort of first date the formula begins to wear off, his voice begins to change back, he has to escape.
How is he going to explain that to 'Stella' when he again becomes 'Buddy Love' next time.
The length of effectiveness increasingly means whilst performing or trying to be romantic and he begins
to revert to 'Julius' he has to disappear from his public, however in class 'Stella; is beginning to put 2 and
2 together, does he need to be 'Buddy' for people, more importantly 'Stella' to like and respect him ?
There are many laugh out loud moments throughout the film, Jerry Lewis's comic genius blossoms in
this movie.
Of course a more recent version to this 1963 comedy classic was made starring 'Eddie Murphy' for me
despite the advantage of it's special effects, the 1996 version doesn't come close to 'Jerry Lewis's' effort.
Saw this one many years ago, it had me in stitches, today, it's still incredibly funny.",1503273600,,1881,4.685800604229607
