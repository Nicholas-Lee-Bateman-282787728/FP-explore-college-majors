8363998,3,B002CIM8JY,"Mr. Pizzarelli is, no doubt, an accomplished musician and guitarist.
It was hoped he would delve into the instrument, harmony, and musical ideas
more so. This DVD is a touchstone of concepts only, but done well and
easy to understand. However there are more intricate DVD's done by
his peers. Nevertheless, its a fine DVD to have in one's collection.",1473292800,,350,4.85
8363999,3,B002CIM8JY,A great player.  He does not pass on too much though.,1439078400,,53,3.8181818181818183
8364000,5,B002CIM8JY,Love learning from my guitar hero John Pizzarelli.  This video is great for a student of Jazz Guitar who already has a good understanding of the instrument.  This has given me new ideas and approaches to my instrument and helped me to progress more as a player!,1423526400,,261,4.531914893617022

8364002,5,B002CIM8JY,"John Pizzarelli is one of the most proficient and engaging Jazz performers in the world today. His playing and singing are not some sort of cerebral exercise, but rather an exciting celebration of the great Jazz era. He sues this DVD to provide some useful tips for playing in the Jazz style - stuff you can start using right away, without getting too hung up on theory or technique.",1394668800,,383,4.565217391304348
8364003,3,B002CIM8JY,"I really expected this to be better. Simply put, this video tries to do too many things too fast to be of much use. For example: the section on single note soloing is a joke. He shows two licks and shows that you can move them around, but he does not mention scales, arpeggios etc. It didn't really give any insight into his approach other than the fact that he doesn't over complicate things. And in case you are wondering, I was not expecting a long discussion of modes or anything like that. I don't use that approach myself, but he really didn't give much info. The bulk of the time is spent showing his rhythm guitar style, but you can see that in youtube clips for free. I was also disappointed in the chord soloing section, which was the main reason I bought this.  He just doesn't explain things well.  He taught it the way a friend would show you something if he had a couple minutes to spare. I was hoping for in depth explanations of his approach.  It is not worth the almost 30 dollars.  I'm glad I only paid 16 from importcd's.  On the upside: good production, John seems like a real nice guy. If john would do one long video for each topic he has in this one, I bet they would be great.",1307318400,3,1200,4.222707423580786
8364004,5,B002CIM8JY,"This DVD by John Pizzarelli is an inside look at how he plays.  It also includes some of the tips he attributes to his father, Bucky.  The chapters are laid out nicely focusing on different aspects of his playing.  If you have a 7-string guitar like I do, you'll appreciate seeing how he plays some of the chords he uses regularly, but you would appreciate the lessons on a six-string as well.  Now I can see how John approaches a tune, whether it's chord solos, comping, improvising, backing up a singer or constructing Intros and Outros.

Overall it's very much like you are there with John getting a private lesson.  If you've seen him in concert you know that his delivery is always fun!  That helps when you play each lesson again and again!",1255910400,6,746,4.522388059701493
8364005,5,B002CIM8JY,"A Good  Guitar lesson  . John  gives an overview  of  his approach  to  guitar  playing (always having fun), playing  single lines, playing  chord melodies,  playing his and Bucky's  style  of rhythm guitar, How to voice  and  play while backing up a singer,  simple  but effective intro's and outro's and turnarounds.  The video was clear, concise and  informative.",1252368000,8,366,5.105263157894737
