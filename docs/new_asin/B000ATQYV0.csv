2393078,3,B000ATQYV0,"For those who think this is a complete collection of the Swamp Fox series,there were 8 episodes, not 3. For those who remember watching on ""Walt Disney Presents"" this will not be

a good choice; there is too much missing material. Had hoped for

a complete,unedited release of this Disney classic. This can only be a partial amount of the original.",1132272000,130,348,4.688524590163935
2393079,5,B000ATQYV0,"Swamp Fox was great.  But why release only 3 of the 8 episodes?  Why not a seperate set for each show with all of the episodes?  Please, disney, gives us the whole series!  My fuzzy VHS tapes off of TV are getting old!",1127088000,183,218,4.0
2393080,3,B000ATQYV0,"Elfego Baca was a series of 10 episodes shown as part of the Walt Disney Presents anthology TV series 1958-1960. Elgego Baca was a former gunman who became a sheriff, and later a lawyer. The Disney westerns tended to be out-of-the-ordinary shows, which generally didn't follow the formula of other TV westerns of that time. This is high level entertainment if you are interested in the TV westerns of the late 1950s and early 1960s. I am not a western TV show fan, so I am not specifically interested in this series. I saw this series when it was shown on the Disney Channel, but it just didn't interest me. But I do recognize the quality for western TV show fans.

The three Elfego Baca shows on this DVD set are:

Show #1 of the series - Elfego Baca: Nine Lives of Elfego Baca. Elfego is deputized to catch a rampaging cowboy, but this leads to trouble with other cowboys in the area.

Show #2 of the series - Four Down and Five Lives To Go. Elfego becomes sheriff and is able to convince most of the criminals to turn themselves in. He is badly injured trying to catch a murderer, and decides to study law instead of being a sheriff.

Show #5 of the series - Attorney At Law. Elfego becomes a lawyer, and in his first case, he defends an accused thief, who has been framed.

Swamp Fox was a series of 8 episodes shown on the Walt Disney Presents TV series 1959-1961. It told the story of the American Patriot Francis Marion (actor Leslie Nielsen), who fought the British during the Revolutionary War using unusual methods, such as guerilla attacks. Again, I saw this series when it was shown on the Disney Channel, but the Revolutionary War adventure just didn't appeal to me. It is a quality show and I'm sure anyone interested in such action adventures would enjoy it.

The three shows of Swamp Fox on this DVD set are:

Show #1 of the series - Birth of the Swamp Fox. Marion learns the British are about to attack Charleston, and he helps by leading the governor and his party safely out of the city. Eluding the British in the swamps, he works with a band of loyal colonists to save a group of captured patriots.

Show #2 of the series - Brother Against Brother. Tories (British supporters) stge raids against their patriot neighbors. Marion plans to free a group of American prisoners when he learns the British are about to transfer them to another area.

Show #3 of the series - Tory Vengeance. Marion's nephew, Gabe, joins the army, but he is captured, tortured, and eventually killed. Marion swears vengeance.

Bonus materials on this DVD set are:

An interview with Robert Loggia, the star of ""Elfego Baca"".

A featurette that examines the origins of these historical figures and the story of their lives ""Tales Of Courage And Adventure"".

Still frame galleries from these TV shows and ""more"".

I do believe the shows are a bit dated, so I gave it 3 stars. But the production standards are high quality - 4 to 5 stars. I do not plan to buy this DVD set, but I feel anyone who enjoys such shows would be very happy with the set.",1124582400,61,3040,4.47377938517179

2393096,5,B000ATQYV0,I have tried to get the complete Swamp Fox series starring Leslie Nielsen for the last 10 years.  As a child I grew up watching Disney and the Swamp Fox series was shown on Disney on Sunday Nights.  I wrote Disney site and said I wanted that series ant they said that they only had one season.  I asked them to release the full set because Disney always made history so great to lean about our Country on.  I had told them that they should be ashamed of their selves for not having the complete set and that if Walt Disney was alive he would fire them all for not releasing that series.  I am still trying to get that set and I am trying to make business's put pressure on Disney Corporation to release the whole set.  I thought  that maybe Amazon had it and I just don't see where they do.  That was a great set and such a wonderful way to get kids to learn about the United States's History.,1443312000,,893,4.121387283236994

2393101,1,B000ATQYV0,I recently was watching son's of liberty on the history channel and that sparked my interest of re-watching the Swamp Fox. I went looking all over found 5 compete eps on youtube with the 6th only a partial. I really wanted to watch all 8 episodes and so came here to look at purchasing the complete set as I love this show and wanted to show it to my kids. We are big lovers of American history. I fund this was willing to beg my husband to let me buy it even though it was packaged with another show I don't remember again I was willing to give it a try since my Swamp Fox was included. I wondered at the low rating and so I read the reviews and ws glad I did. Only a small handful of each show's episodes?! What a rip off. If I pay this amount of money for a dvd set I expect to have the full collection of seasons not just 3 episodes. I am glad I didn't waste what little money we have on a dvd collection that is not a true collection. I hope Disney reads the reviews the least they can do since they got rid of the vault on their channel was to give us the full release of all the old shows so we can watch them still as we love them. Now I wonder if even looking for Johnny Tremain is even worth it.,1432598400,,1205,3.882591093117409

I contacted Disney & they were beyond useless in helping or even giving a straight answer to very simple questions.  I would only recommend this as a tease to get people interested in real history.  Then they would need to go find a book to learn the rest of the fascinating story's behind both of the real life historical heroes the men were.",1420070400,,451,4.333333333333333

2393137,4,B000ATQYV0,It was pretty good television and the stories were well done.  There was quite a bit of taking liberties with the actual events that occurred those many years ago.

Swamp Fox I had seen during its airing, but like all else, it's new again.  For those who enjoyed these series in the past, I recommend seeing them again.  Just realize they're not all there.",1401926400,,335,4.253968253968254
2393169,4,B000ATQYV0,"The final release of Wave 5 is another worthy release. Elfego Baca and The Swamp Fox Legendary Heroes are two lesser known series from Walt Disney's TV show, but are just as entertaining as any of the more popular series from the era. Once again the episodes on this set have had a proper restoration done to them or they were stored with extreme care. The first three episodes from each show are included here and I know that is bound to disappoint fans of the two series. While it would have been a better idea to give each series their own complete release, this could still be redeemed by releasing a second set with the remaining episodes for each series on it..... ala volume two. This would probably increase the sales of the first release for sure. The good new is the episodes that are included look remarkably good for their age. Like I mentioned in another Treasures release The Mickey Mouse Club, I was never a big fan of the show growing up during the 60's, but looking back at it now, I find it charming and fun.

The first disc includes the first 3 episodes of Elfego Baca which is a fast paced ""shoot em up"" western series starring Robert Loggia (Frank from Scarface). The Swamp Fox is located on disc 2, While I had never heard of either of these shows, I found them both fun to watch and full of 50's action. Each episode is shown in its entirety with the Walt Disney intro making the episodes clock in at approx. 52 minutes. The extras on the first disc include an interview with Robert Loggia and 3 stills galleries.

The second disc holds 3 (why not 4 ?) episodes from The Swamp Fox which look as good as the episodes from Elfego Baca on disc one. There is a lot of griping about how neither show has its complete run on this set, but I think Disney was skeptical of the popularity of the two series. Like I mentioned earlier in my review, this could be redeemed by releasing a volume two with the remaining 3 Baca and 5 Fox episodes on it. I'm sure this is a big reason why this set hasn't sold out....maybe if enough fans call or write Disney, they will answer the request with the remaining episodes for both shows released. Both series' episodes are in color with the intros in black and white as the original openings in color are lost.

While both shows deserve their own release, there is no reason to rate this Treasures installment with a low rating. If the set had sold out they might have release the rest, but with such an underwhelming response, I doubt they will ever finish either series on DVD. Considering this was a WDT set that I knew little about, I came out of it very happy with this release and can only hope they will release the remaining episodes of both shows to complete the series(wave 10 please!). The discs are houses in their usual tin case with a reproduction of Disney art, a booklet and the COA.

******I CALLED DISNEY AND REQUESTED FOR THE REMAINING EPISODE TO BE RELEASED.

2393214,3,B000ATQYV0,"I just ordered ""Disney's Treasures: Elfego Baca and The Swamp Fox"".  Like everyone else I want the whole series of the Swamp Fox, but after seeing the price of discontinued or rare  ""Disney Treasures"" go through the roof, I thought I better make my move before I was sorry.  Also, though I am a big Swamp Fox fan, I do remember Elfego Baca, and remember that too was a very good show, and I got to thinking I'd like to see him again.

I do have episodes 1-5 of the Swamp Fox recorded on VHS off the air sometime in the '80s.  Comparing them with episodes on You Tube, I noticed that shows I recorded are truncated for commercials. (No big surprise there.)

Having made my move, either Disney's Swamp Fox will disappear after this, or they will release the last 5 episodes
eventually, or maybe they will release the whole series in one can, making me happy and frustrated at the same time.

Well, I got tired of the uncertainty and committed to nice (I assume) and complete episodes of part of 2 old Disney series.  I just hope the rest comes out before I pass on.  By the way, I don't recommend the action that makes up the title of the review- that's only what I decided to do.

2393253,5,B000ATQYV0,"I give this set five stars for its content, not for the set itself.  I used to watch ""Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color"" when I was kid, and these shows were just slightly before that time. I'd never seen them before, so I bought the set to view what was at least available. Then I went online to see how many episodes were originally aired, and came across a review by a critic on another website. He seemed impressed with ""Elfego Baca,"" but this is what he said about ""The Swamp Fox"":

""Whether historically accurate or not, this series places its interest more strongly into the battles and campaigns conducted by patriots like Marion than in any of the individual characters who might have figured into its stories. This focus on strategy, coupled with the physical similarities among the predominantly white male cast, makes it hard (at least for this modern viewer, seeing the show for the first time) to connect emotionally with the individual characters or invest too much into what happens. Next to 'Elfego Baca' and 'Davy Crockett', this series is considerably slower and dryer, in spite of the presence of guns and the inherent drama of galloping horses. It is dated and its historical origins seem to lend to only so much of more than minimal excitement.""

Hmmmm.  Then he goes on to say this about Leslie Nielsen and the Revolutionary War:  ""Nielsen, who has been known for the past 25 years as purely a comedy actor, rarely cracks a smile in the three selected episodes, a fact which contributes to the all-too-serious nature of the dated proceedings. With its attentions held steadfastly to a war now rarely considered for the majority of the year, 'The Swamp Fox' is most entertaining in its subplots, where the slightest bit of humanity is enabled to show forth.""

Give me a break. Experience has taught me that usually if the critics don't like a show, it must be pretty good! The fact that the Revolutionary War is ""a war now rarely considered for the majority of the year"" is the very reason people need to watch ""The Swamp Fox."" I was excited to see Mel Gibson's ""The Patriot"" (2000) which is supposedly based on the same character, but the filmmakers spoiled it by adding unhistorical material simply for the sake of emotional effect (such as the British burning down a church full of civilians, which in reality would have gotten them in extreme trouble with their officers). I have always believed that American history is brimming with stories besides just the Civil War, the Old West, or WWII.  One reviewer I read may have been on to something when he expressed his opinion that Hollywood types today generally don't like the Revolutionary War because ""1)those guys dressed funny, and 2)they were right-wing gun nuts.""

I'm watching ""Elfego Baca"" right now and enjoying every minute of it.  I can't wait to get to ""The Swamp Fox.""  I came on here to see how the average person's review compared to the critic's review I quoted above. Sure enough, most of the reviews on here are from people who want ""The Swamp Fox""! And as for Leslie Nielsen ""rarely cracking a smile"" during this series, what did the critic expect, that it would be like ""Airplane""? I'm all for comedy and parodies, but it seems like people today (at least film and television writers) can't take romantic heroism seriously.

My only disappointment with this set is the same as other reviewers, that they didn't include all the episodes of each series.  I bought the two complete ""Zorro"" sets (which I love), and ""Zorro"" had a lot more episodes each season, so how difficult would it have been to include all of ""Elfego Baca"" and all of the ""The Swamp Fox"" in this one set? It seems like Disney today doesn't care, just throw out a few tidbits to please the old farts who will watch these old shows anyway. Yet I have seen some younger reviewers on here who appreciate the good material Disney used to produce. I think that if you just give them a chance, today's young people are as bright and intelligent as any generation. Many of them can stretch their attention spans beyond what they've been dealt all their lives and will enjoy and appreciate these fine historical programs.",1293235200,3,4181,4.704514363885089

The first disc includes the first 3 episodes of Elfego Baca which is a fast paced ""shoot em up"" western series starring Robert Loggia (Frank from Scarface). The Swamp Fox is located on disc 2, While I had never heard of either of these shows,  I found them both fun to watch and full of 50's action. Each episode is shown in its entirety with the Walt Disney intro making the episodes clock in at approx. 52 minutes. The extras on the first disc include an interview with Robert Loggia and 3 stills galleries.

The second disc holds 3 (why not 4 ?) episodes from The Swamp Fox which look as good as the episodes from Elfego Baca on disc one. There is a lot of griping about how neither show has its complete run on this set, but I think Disney was skeptical of the popularity of the two series. Like I mentioned earlier in my review, this could be redeemed by releasing a volume two with the remaining 3 Baca and 5 Fox episodes on it. I'm sure this is a big reason why this set hasn't sold out....maybe if enough fans call or write Disney, they will answer the request with the remaining episodes for both shows released. Both series' episodes are in color with the intros in black and white as the original openings in color are lost.

While both shows deserve their own release, there is no reason to rate this Treasures installment with a low rating. If the set had sold out they might have release the rest, but with such an underwhelming response, I doubt they will ever finish either series on DVD. Considering this was a WDT set that I knew little about, I came out of it very happy with this release and can only hope they will release the remaining episodes of both shows to complete the series(wave 10 please!). The discs are houses in their usual tin case with a reproduction of Disney art, a booklet and the COA.

******I CALLED DISNEY AND REQUESTED FOR THE REMAINING EPISODE TO BE RELEASED.

2393355,1,B000ATQYV0,"Too bad the designation ""MGM"" is already in use by a legitimate studio.  Otherwise, I'd suggest Disney change its name to Money Grubbing Mongrels.  It is inexcusable that these clowns [with apologies to all hard-working circus and other performers around the world] are attempting to foist upon the public a DVD set containing a mere three episodes of each of these series.  Personally, I was looking for the Elfego Baca stories but would have been willing to pay a premium [within reason] if the Swamp Fox episodes were boxed together with them.

I realize that I am only adding to the already-voiced outrage and disappointment that is posted here.  My hope is that if more will do the same, then perhaps this will become one more method by which we can get corporate Disney's attention and, ultimately, convince it to do the right thing by its long-suffering audience and release its many fine series as they should be... complete.  Do justice to Robert Loggia, Leslie Nielsen, and everyone else who was involved with these projects.

Likewise, DVD releases of wide-screen motion pictures solely in pan-and-scan 4:3 aspect format is ludicrous and offensive.  Disney, what ARE you thinking?  This is a money-losing approach.

BUT, as other reviewers have stressed, the disk contains only the first three of the eight episodes.  Episode three even has the trailer for episode four, but that's where it stops.  For as long as this set has been out, it's clear Disney has no intention of releasing the remaining episodes.  I recommend not purchasing this incomplete issue.",1186704000,9,554,4.913978494623656
2393358,2,B000ATQYV0,"I fondly remembered both Elfego Baca and the Swamp Fox series from the Disney TV shows. I initially watched them in b/w TV so it was a pleasure of see them again in color as Walt Disney had the foresight to filmed in color back then even although most of the TVs in United States were black and white.

Both series proves to be interesting, entertaining and exciting. They were well acted, well scripted and educational. While the Swamp Fox is the weaker of the two, I thought it was pretty enjoyable series. Elfego Baca on the other hand, was one of the most exciting western TV shows I have seen as a kid and got me into Gunsmokes and other westerns. Although some reviewers wrote that these shows were bit dated, I don't believed that to be the case. When I saw them again as grown adult, they proves just as good as I remembered them as a child. The credit I think goes to the Walt Disney and his production people who created these shows.

Like almost every other reviewers here, I am totally angered and appalled by Disney's decision only to released three of ten Elfego Baca episodes and three of eight Swamp Fox episodes. It almost an insult, a slap in a face at such cheapness and pettiness. The two stars I gave reflects nothing on the shows on the DVD but on Disney's decision making process that only shows one-third of the episodes of each series. They probably counted on folks like me who have fond memories of these shows to buy this DVD release despite of its masculated package. They were right much to my personal regret. (If Disney at that time didn't want to release a big DVD, they could have done the Scarcrow series and Johnny Tremain series, I think Scarcrow is three while Tremain was two episodes long.)

This DVD release does not come with my recommendation unless you happened to be a die-hard fan of the original shows. Even then, its pretty questionable if you should get. If so, try to get them as cheap as possible since to be perfectly honest, its not worth the price Amazon or Disney is asking for them.",1177718400,19,2038,4.44385026737968
2393399,2,B000ATQYV0,"I grew up in Charleston, SC and knew all about Francis Marion (The ""Swamp Fox"") when I was a kid.  One of the first books I ever read was about Marion and his band of militia.  I loved seeing the Disney episodes I saw as a kid again on cable several years ago and taped several of them, so when I saw this show had made the cut for the Treasures Series, I was excited...but like most of you, I'm disappointed that they only found fit to put 3 episodes of the series on the DVD.  Now that I think about, I think these 3 are the only ones I ever saw on the Disney Channel.  Disney sure is adept at biting the hands that feed them for sure.  Most of the people buying the Treasures series are hard-core Disney fans who grew up watching this stuff in theaters and on television.  Why would you serve up a half-baked effort to the people that have remained loyal to Disney all these years?  (Rhetorical question I guess, I'm sure you all know the answer to that one.)  How hard would it have been to get the other 5 shows on this?  Geez.

I'm surprised they haven't released ""Scarecrow of Romney Marsh"" in this series yet considering there were only 3 episodes of that one, and there are evidently people so eager to see it on DVD they're writing reviews of a non-existent product LOL...

2393401,5,B000ATQYV0,"After the huge success of Davy Crockett during the first season of the TV show ""Disneyland,"" Walt Disney began searching for other heroes from American history for the show.  Two of the ones he settled on are Elfego Baca and The Swamp Fox.  Three episodes each of their TV run are included in this two-disc set.

Disc one features Elfego Baca (Robert Loggia).  He was a Mexican American who lived in New Mexico during the late 1800's.  He started out as a Sheriff but gave that up to become a lawyer.  He always helped out the poor and downtrodden, as long as they were innocent.  We get episodes 1, 2, and 5.  I think they skipped to 5 since that episode featured Disney vet Annette Funicello.

Disc two takes us even further back in time to the Revolutionary War.  Francis Marion, aka The Swamp Fox (Leslie Nielsen) was a hero of the war who led his troops in many raids against the British in the Carolinas.  This set features the first three episodes.  They end on a downer, and the teaser for the next episode is included.  Man, it makes me wish they had more in the set.

Since the shows were originally filmed in color, that's what we get here, although the intros from the TV show are often in black and white.  The picture has many flaws, betraying the show's age.  Still, they are very watchable and look like the lavish productions they are.  Extras include an interview with Robert Loggia on disc one and a documentary on Disney's history lessons on disc two.

Even though the shows are almost 50 years old, they are still entertaining.  Fans of history or Disney will be glad to add this set to their collection.",1167696000,17,1625,4.465986394557823

I never cared for the Elfego Baca story, I had been known to go to my room and VOLUNTARILY do my homework on Sunday nights when these episodes played, but I would have GLADLY paid the price for this set if it had included ALL of the ""Swamp Fox"" episodes!

Above and beyond the fact that I am proud to have Francis Marion as a distant relative, and that I hail from the same part of our great country as this hero of the Revolutionary War, who, with his compatriots, probably contributed as much as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, or any of the other Founding Fathers to win us our freedom, I really loved this story just for itself!

Not only have I decided NOT to waste my money on this incomplete set, I have even gone as far as removing it from my ""Wish List"" to save the funds of my family and friends, as well!

Cat' series that played at 9:30 on NBC Fridays long ago...I think U.N.C.L.E. was playing afterwards, but I could be wrong about that...it might have been the season Star Trek played at 10), the number of episodes of the two shows was VERY disappointing.

If Disney can give us an entire 17 hours of Spin and Marty, what's with three episodes each of these two? This is not a good value for $35. Most full seasons of 25 episodes of most TV shows are in this same price range.

Don't forget, Disney, you're talking TV shows here...ones that you're rerun on your own channels. (Unfortunately, when I didn't have access to the network.) Asking $35 for six episodes is VERY steep.

Surely Disney could have fit all the available episodes on two disks?  Noone should buy this!  The only thing Disney seems to understand anymore is the bottom line.  If desperate fans buy it, Disney won't provide the quality releases we're all hoping for.  Buying this is like buying half a movie!  I've been hoping Disney will release the original black and white Zorro series on DVD, but not if they're going to do this...",1138579200,65,624,4.526785714285714

I sat down and watched the Swamp Fox DVD with my girlfriend. Imagine my surprise when I finished episode three and went to see the conclusion of the story line on episode 4.

  They only gave us threee episodes of each show!!! In this world of box sets and double sided DVDs this is nothing but a complete RIP OFF.

  Now I won't buy the Spin and Marty set and it's unlikey I'll buy another Disney Treasures! Frankly Leonard Maltin should be ashamed of himself for being associated with this ripoff.",1137283200,77,618,4.2844827586206895
2393447,1,B000ATQYV0,"I was hoping for a COMPLETE set of Swamp Fox, Disney! Now, I know that someone else wrote that the complete series might not be available. However, up until four years ago the Disney channel aired the series at 4:oo in the morning. Right after I had my little girl, I discovered this. Anyway, for about 4 months I was able to see all episodes. Then, Disney channel stopped airing all the ""Classic Disney"" shows during the wee morning hours. Now, all that one sees is the repeat of new shows -- yuk!
I think Walt would roll over in his grave if he knew all the terrible shows that Disney produces now (Lizzie, Raven, etc..). Especially since he loved history, old folk-lore, and learning.
I think like Boomerang, Disney should have a ""Classic Disney Channel"" that only runs tv shows/movies produced before 1985.",1136592000,239,810,4.631944444444445

Iwas quite excited to learn the Swamp Fox was being released on DVD, as this was my favorite Disney series...that is , until I find there are only three episodes in the set. I will not spend my money on a partial offering.

If and when they present us with the entire Swamp Fox series, then I will invest in a copy.",1136592000,44,330,4.061538461538461
2393479,1,B000ATQYV0,"If you are expecting to receive and see all the episodes of THE SWAMP FOX and the ELFEGO BACA series in this release, forget it!  As pointed out by many of the other reviews, and Amazon's product description, there are only three episodes of each in this ""collection.""  I wish I had read these before ordering.  I would have never purchased this item and in so doing would have prevented the frustration of being engrossed in, then cut off and left hanging, from the rest of the series and their conclusions.

Even on the outer DVD packaging that you would see in a store, nowhere does Disney come straight out and tell you the set is not complete -- unless you look at the DVD's running time for the clue (aka ""the fine print"").

This DVD's Disney production team evidently couldn't care less about your entertainment satisfation!

For what you DO get, the picture and sound quality of the product are fantastic, but I don't understand why this was released in such a lousy, partial manner -- especially in these days of complete TV series being release a season at a time on DVD (again, as pointed out by other reviewers).

Please don't feel badly about passing this DVD by.  Don't give it another thought.  Leave it on the rack, save your money, and wait until the Disney studio heads come to their senses and release ELFEGO BACA and THE SWAMP FOX in their entirety.  You will miss nothing but aggrevation.

When the time comes, I truly hope this Disney crew doesn't decide to handle ZORRO in the same ""piecemeal"" manner, and they release that Guy Williams classic ONLY in its full completeness!",1136592000,37,1598,4.6113074204946995
2393480,4,B000ATQYV0,"I received this DVD for Christmas. I wanted it because the Swamp Fox was a fascinating character during the American Revolution who helped the South gain their freedom from Great Britain. It gave a good look at how Francis Marion harrassed the British in a Robin Hood sort of way.

Elfego Baca was an excellent character. I had never heard of him before, but I enjoyed the three episodes that I saw. It was a great triumph of right over wrong. I liked the way he stood up for his people.

I wish the rest of the episodes would be released.",1136419200,10,539,4.326732673267327
2393481,4,B000ATQYV0,"We are all use to whole season box sets. The days when a tape or DVD would only include 2-4 episodes is long gone. And when a series only had about 8 hours then we expect to find the whole series on a single two disc set. That is why we find it peculiar that instead of releasing every ElFego Baca and/or Swamp Fox episode in one box set we get three episodes each. And not even in broadcast order, episodes are skipped.

While this could mean that they are holding out so that they could release more episodes in future volumes, I have a feeling that these are the only existing complete episodes from the series.

If you were to look back at the Davy Crockett set you would notice that some of the episodes had scenes that were in Black & White. There was a simple reason for this. Walt Disney knew that color television was just around the corner and decided to film his shows in color to be reused in future broadcasts. But that would only include the episodes themselves and the host segments, not the opening and closing credits that would never be reused. When the actual ABC episode was put together, the host segments and episode itself was transferred onto black & white film so that the finished packaged episode to be delivered to ABC would be in black & white. There would be no reason to send color episodes since color television did not exist yet, and color film stock was nearly four times more expensive than black & white film stock. The only complete episodes they would have had in their vaults would be black & white while the separate color host segments and Davy Crockett footage would be kept elsewhere. Later on when ""Disney's Wonderful World of Color"" was on the air the color footage would be reused. But since commercial breaks were much longer the complete episodes would have been edited shorter. This leaves the distinct possibility that either the Walt Disney company no longer has the original uncut Davy Crockett footage, or that there is something wrong with the film it is on and can no longer be used as film masters [ although could possibly be restored and transferred onto safety stock ], or for some reason is held in a film library that refuses to release them. And then there is the biggest possibility, that the tins containing the film are lost somewhere within the Disney library and it will take them years to track down every print and catalog every tin in their vault. What it looks like has happened is that some episodes are composites of the complete ABC shows and the shorter color NBC or later shows, possibly even footage from the Davy Crockett movie release.

So perhaps they decided for future episode releases that they would not release episodes unless they could locate the complete color footage. If that is the case then they may have been sitting on the Baca and Fox episodes they have now for months, perhaps years, and finally decided to release what they had now.

One solution would be to recolor the black & white footage, but this sort of restoration is very expensive, and the last thing they want to do is spend millions restoring these episodes to color only for someone else to find the missing original color footage. Another solution would be to do what was done with the Davy Crockett episode, to release them with some segments not in color. But, once again, what happens when someone finds the color footage? This was not much of a problem with the Davy Crockett episodes that could be re-released again once that footage is finally located. But the Baca and Fox episodes have limited appeal and probably will not be re-released again for a long long time, so if they are going to release them then they better get it right the first time.

Should you buy this volume of Disney Treasures? It all depends on how much you want to own these episodes. They are pretty much the same quality and pacing of the Davy Crockett episodes, so if you liked them then you will like these as well.",1136419200,10,3961,4.542016806722689
2393482,5,B000ATQYV0,"I love the  classic Disney shows like Swamp Fox, Elfego Baca, Daniel Boone (with Dewey Martin), Davy Crockett (which is complete on a Disney Treasury edition!), Zorro (with Guy Williams) and Texas John Slaughter  (with Tom Tyron).

I pre booked this box set when I first heard of this release. I would have liked to have the complete ten episodes of Baca and eight episodes of Fox on DVD.This was not to be, for shame!

However In this treasury edition of Baca and Fox. There are only three episodes each of the series. The Disney production  values being the way it and was, I will take the three of each episode and rate them high. These episodes hold up after years

However Disney fans, lets put the Powers that be on notice... WE all want full sets of our classic Disney shows (like they did with the full season of Spin and Marty that was just released) or full series seasons like Zorro (hopefully coming soon-PLEASE!) . So I can hope they try to do the full Baca or Fox in another box set

When I was a kid I was glued to the TV whenever Disney was on. I watched just about everything that was shown. Swamp Fox and all the other adventures were great and still are. I am still waiting for Scarecrow to be releasedon DVD. Just about everyone in their review ask the same question, ""why only three episodes?"" Well it all comes down to one thing...MONEY. They have you sucked in for the first three episodes. Now they'll make you wait a while and release three more later, which we will most likely be glad to pay for. Then the last two will be released for Swamp Fox. Walt Disney must have rolled over in his grave many times by now, after seeing what's going on with the great thing he built. Come on Disney I was just a young kid when this stuff first came out. I'm getting old now. The technology is getting old.

2393485,5,B000ATQYV0,"This is the best of the Treasure sets yet.  The packaging was evrything a fan of the two TV series could want -- they used the wonderful Dell comic book covers as inserts and also as some of the photographic material in the documentaries.  Leonard Maltin's introduction from the Golden Oak Ranch is detailed and also priceless information for Disney TV completists who try to identify settings and shooting locales.  The documentaries are rich with detail, such as location information about filming the series and building the sets.  But the best-of-the-best is Leonard Maltin's interview with Robert Loggia!  Cheers to both!  Cheers for Leonard's warm and concise interviewing and cheers to Loggia for being enthusiastic about something he worked on nearly 50 years ago, instead of ""putting it behind him"".  One of the best things about the set is that Diseny gave us the original opening and closing credits, narration, segues -- you name it! -- even down to the old ""this has been an ABC Television film presentation"" sign-off.  There are coming attraction ads for the 2nd season of 'Zorro' and upcoming film releases like ""Sleeping Beauty"".  For a TV collector and especially for a collector of Disney TV material this is really a treat.  I think Leonard Maltin ought to be carried shoulder-high around Disneyland.  Keep 'em coming!

Just think about this for a minute...that would be the equivalent of say 6 episodes of (your favorite tv series here) per dvd set for the same price you were paying for a full season of the tv show.  Would you buy that?  Would you buy a full price dvd set 3 or 4 times to complete one season?

Please don't order this.  Steer clear and stop encouraging this madness.

Now Disney, if you ever get your act together after no one buys your dvds....please release Elfego Baca, Swamp Fox, Texas John Slaughter, Andy Burnett, The Living Desert and all of the ""true-life adventures"" on dvd.  Each with its own dvd set is fine.

And you can even keep that dumb tin can.  Just do it completely instead of cheap and extortionate.
