8116869,5,B000F3NK9U,"This collection has 7 early Felix the Cat episodes, from Felix creators Pat Sullivan and Otto Messmer. They are in b&w and silent, and show their age, but it doesn't diminish the marvelous creativity of them. In 1936, the Van Beuren Studios took over the Felix character, and there is 1 example from this era, ""The Goose That Laid the Golden Egg."" Felix is a favorite of mine, but one of the best and rarest cartoons in this collection is ""The Enchanted Square,"" the second of the 2 Raggedy Ann Noveltoons made, and the inclusion of this beautiful episode makes this definitely a 5 star DVD for early animation fans. Total running time is 75 minutes. Episode list:

1: ""Felix in Arabiantics"" (1929), Felix finds a flying carpet, which takes him to Arabia, where he exchanges it for jewels. When the jewels get stolen, Felix's expressions of anger are hilarious. 5*

2: ""The Goose That Laid the Golden Egg"" (1936), directed by Burt Gillett and Tom Palmer, music by Winston Sharples for the Van Beuren Studios. Felix and Goldie the Goose are very philanthropic with their golden eggs, until Goldie is goosenapped by Captain Kidd. Felix to the rescue! The color of this print is quite deteriorated. 5*

3: ""Felix in False Vases"" (1929), Felix breaks his wife's vase, and with the help of a dog, digs a hole to China to buy a new one, and has some fine adventures. 5*

4:  ""Felix Woos Whoopee"" (1928), an inebriated Felix stays too long at the dance hall, while his wife waits and paces, rolling pin in hand. 5*

5: ""Felix in 40 Winks"" (1929), Felix tries to sleep, in a very noisy environment. This is a great example of ""noise tracks,"" as the episode starts with a chorus of yowling cats.

6: ""Felix in Futuritzy"" (1928), Felix meets Professor Whoozit! I love the way Felix tips his ears to the fortune teller in the first scene. 5*

7: ""Felix in Sculls and Skulls"" (1930), Very creatively drawn, as Felix sees ghosts and things that go bump in the night, and competes in a boat race. Watch for a mouse that looks a lot like Mickey. 5*

8: ""Felix in Outdoor Indore"" (1928) (title is incorrect on DVD box). Felix takes the stripes off a tiger, in this trip to India. 5*

9: ""Scrappily Married"" (1945), directed by Seymour Kneitel, animated by Orestes Calpini and Otto Feuer, music by Winston Sharples for the Famous Studios. Henry the Rooster is henpecked by his wife ""Chicken Pie,"" and Herman the Mouse decides to help him. Color degraded on this print. 4*

10: ""The Enchanted Square"" (1947), directed by Seymour Knietel, animated by Orestes Calpini and Al Eugster, music by Winston Sharples for the Famous Studios. One of 2 Noveltoons featuring Raggedy Ann, this is my favorite episode of the collection. Officer Flannagan gives a little blind girl, who sees with the ""eyes of her heart,"" a Raggedy Ann he found in the trash, and ""with imagination, anything is possible."" It is a touching episode, one that I have not seen in any other collection, and exquisitely drawn. 5*

11: ""Farm Foolery"" (1949), directed by Seymour Kneitel, animated by Al Eugster and Bill Hudson, music by Winston Sharples for the Famous Studios. A farm animal sing-along as they sing ""Shine on Harvest Moon"" and provide lots of sight gags. 3*

12: ""Freedom River"" (1971), a Stephen Bosustow production, directed by Sam Weiss, animated by Vincent Bassols, narrated by Orson Welles. A drastic, rather confused tale of pollution, and man's destructive power. Political correctness 70's style. Certainly a curiosity piece. 2*

13: ""Barnyard Brat"" (1939), directed by Dave Fleischer, animated by Arnold Waldman and Anthony Pabian, music by Sammy Timberg, for the Fleischer Studios. Spunky is a very naughty burro in this episode! 4*

14: ""Sports Chumpions"" (date unknown), directed by Isadore Freleng, animated by Gerry Chiniquy, music by Carl Stalling. Low lights in the world of sports! 3*

15: ""Big Man From the North"" (1931), directed by Hugh Harmon and Rudolf Ising, animated by Isadore Freleng and Robert Edmunds, music by Frank Marsales for the Schlesinger Studios. In an early silent b&w Bosko series episode, Bosko is sent to capture a wanted criminal ""dead or alive."" Girlfriend Honey is in the saloon, and songs are ""Chinnin' and Chattin' with May,"" and ""Lookin' for the Love Light in the Dark."" Some pre 1934 code violence in this one, in the way Bosko wields his knife! 5*",1152662400,4,4354,4.77762982689747
