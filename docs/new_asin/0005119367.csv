886,5,0005119367,"TNT has put together a surprisingly good account of the Biblical story of  Joseph, betrayed into slavery in Egypt by his jealous brothers.  Martin  Landau as Jacob and Ben Kingsley as Potiphar give their usual first-rate  performances, with the role of Joseph also well-acted.  Leslie-Anne Warren is  the lustful wife of Potiphar, who unsuccessfully tries to seduce Joseph,  and lands him in the Pharoah's prison.  This film offers a very credible  depiction of life in the ancient Near East, from the desert tents of the  Hebrews, to the claustrophobic walled towns like Sichem, to the lushness of  civilized Egypt and the Pharoah's court. The film is faithful to the  Biblical account, and succeeds in making it come alive on the screen.  A  well-acted, well-scripted, and entertaining film.  END",906768000,13,798,5.125

There are a few areas where I would see it differently, but nothing to prevent me from watching this version every couple of years.

What I need to know is who are you and ""what planet did you come from"" to be so UNGODLY for money. Because I would have gladly paid extra  for a better movie case.
And if you have a better case get in touch with me, I would like to send out this movie to family and friends......BUT NOT WITH THIS CASE.

904,4,0005119367,"I actually love this movie and think it is well acted.  However, like another reviewer, I thought there were a couple of scenes about Potiphar's wife's attempts at seduction that were completely gratuitous and stretch what scripture says, hence only 4 stars.  The Bible isn't broken, don't try to fix it.  Every other part is quite wonderful.  I just fast-forward through the unnecessary parts.  Joseph is my favorite character in the Bible, after Jesus of course.",1500854400,2,464,5.052631578947368

908,5,0005119367,"The story of Joseph and his victory over human weakness, enemies and oppression is an inspiring tale beautifully portrayed in the Emmy award winning 1995 miniseries ""Joseph"", with Ben Kingsley as Potiphar and Martin Landau as Jacob.  Excellent performances of jealousy and humanity that leave us rooting for Joseph and his brothers to get what's coming to them!  Life lessons from history that we can still learn from today.  Includes some scenes of violence.  Before showing to teen and younger audiences you might want to preview Scene 3 of Potiphar's wife's attempted seduction and decide if you want to skip it and forward to Scene 4.  Well worth the price with English, Spanish and French subtitles.",1497312000,,704,5.0344827586206895

The reunion with Joseph and his brothers is a tear jerker and you will ball your head off.

957,1,0005119367,"I'm not particularly religious and have nothing against X-rated movies.  This is an okay movie.  I just think that you should never watch this movie with young kids.

I watched it with my two daughters, 11 and 8, and it was an embarrassment.

There are 2 rapes, in which the women yell in pain.

There are about 35 murders with knives.  The scenes are not very bloody, but it is still terrible to see a bunch of lunatics killing dozens of people.  My 11 year old was so sickened that she left the room.

There's is a fairly explicit sex scene with a prostitute, which ends up being an incest.

There's frequent reference to prostitutes and to man going to bed with women.

Potiphar's wife behaves in a few scenes as in an x rated movie, her face shows extreme sexual desire, she touches Joseph in very explicit way, including touching his penis.  The scene does not show sexual parts of course, but her hand goes down pretty deep.  She invites him to sleep with her a few times.

There are several extremely offensive references to women, like ""they talk to much"" or ""they gossip.""

Again, the movie is okay and the sex scenes did not offend me.  My problem is that the movie is not rated and it should be at least PG13.  I wish I had not watched that movie with my two daughters.  I am upset.",1468281600,,1293,4.343096234309623

I will keep and add it to my collection..This movie hit a soft spot with me it's about jealousy something a lot of people have had against me my whole life even family members. This movie was really sad I cried at the end because I couldn't hold myself any longer, and I'm a very strong woman..Joseph brothers sold him into slavery because their father favored him. Joseph had several brothers who sinned in the eyes of GOD, so their father favored Joseph because he was the youngest and most righteous. That enraged his brothers they trapped young Joseph and was going to leave him for dead then Egyptians came along the brothers decided to sell him into slavery instead....I didn't see any nudity in the movie. I decided to write that because I read some reviews that talked about nudity I didn't see no nudity in Joseph.......I purchased 3 movies.......David..........Abraham & Joseph....I rate #1David.....#2 Abraham..#3 Joseph..I liked David the most...",1454976000,4,984,4.933734939759036

1047,5,0005119367,"One of my favorite movies. They did an excellent job of staying true to the story. As you watch this movie you are reminded of the faith AND patience of Joseph. If anyone in history had a reason to throw his hands up and declare that God had forgotten him it was Joseph, yet he remained faithful. The full story is told, even the account of Judah and Tamar which ended up in the birth of the root of the kingly line of Israel. Virtually everything was portrayed and accurately so. To me, the main point they really nailed was how Joseph woke up one day, still a prisoner, and by sunset he was the second most powerful man on the face of the Earth. This led to another fantastic lesson, Joseph all of a sudden had all the power anyone could want and while today we see people desire power so they can lord it over those beneath them and settle old scores, Joseph instead showed compassion. He could have easily destroyed his brothers or a least made them suffer as he had suffered but instead he displayed true character.... a lesson many in positions of power today could learn from. The story of Joseph is one of the most remarkable in Biblical history and rightly so.
You can spend your hard earned dollars with confidence when you buy this movie and you will want to either loan it to others or buy it for them as a gift. It's too bad that more movies of this quality are made, especially when you consider all the technology that is available.",1436572800,,1447,4.343173431734317

1078,5,0005119367,"You'll love every minute of this three hour movie. Filmed in Morocco, this treatment of the rags to riches biblical story explores the political intrigue of Joseph's polygamous family and subsequently the Egyptian court. Joseph has long been regarded as a forerunner of Jesus, and the movie alludes to this similarity several times. In fact, Joseph's story is an Old Testament illustration of Jesus' observation that ""no prophet is accepted in his own country,"" (Luke 4:24). Joseph's talent for interpreting dreams provokes his brothers to sell him into slavery, but the same talent proves enormously profitable for him in Egypt.

Perhaps the most relevant connection between the 1995 movie and the present time is the debate over prosperity theology, which proposes that one can enjoy God's blessings --particularly health and wealth-- on earth. Joseph, as portrayed by the athletic Paul Mercurio, is certainly capable of fighting back against his oppressors, but instead of physical aggression, he chooses to assert himself through faith, talent, honesty, and impressive political courage --attributes which eventually earn him riches in Egypt.

Followers of prosperity theology are seen by some Christians as heretics who love money, but the Joseph movie is an epic struggle for the good life, and it raises larger questions. Don't most Christians work for a better life? Don't they repeat refrains, such as ""God helps those who help themselves"" and ""When opportunity knocks, answer the door""? Is the ascetic life advocated by the Bible practical or even responsible in the postmodern world? Was Joseph as a long suffering slave morally superior to Joseph as a rich governor who saved Egypt and its neighbors from death by famine? Several biblical characters have inspired many an inspirational film, but the Joseph movie strikes at the heart of money's problematic role in Christian life.",1428710400,,1892,5.3244147157190636
1079,5,0005119367,"This is my favorite Paul Mercurio movie.  As Joseph he is a truly unharnessed character whose angst is so deep, visually apparent and so complete that we are free to empathize with him. The multi dimensional emotional conflict from within the character is so palpable that it
develops its own spiritual presence in the hot tub seduction scene.  And, the gentle, sweet, forgiving demeanor of Joseph when he reveals
himself to his brothers at the end just ties the story together and brings it to a close with an all encompassing forceful power that is just so
refreshing.  No violence, no revenge, just powerful forgiveness mixed with a dash of gratitude for the end resulting exalted / elevated status
that resulted from his brothers' betrayal.  I love using this movie to learn languages.  The layered emotion and richness makes it, for me, a movie classic.  I think Paul Mercurio movies in general are great language learning tools.  They are so interesting that I don't mind watching them many times.  And, watching anything more than once is a rare occurrence for me.  I initially saw this movie on a religious channel so
the hot tub scene was edited out due to its sexy content.  It is a very crucial part of the movie, however.",1428624000,,1233,4.746478873239437

It faithfully sticks to the Biblical account of Joseph and his brethren and father. A few scenes were added that are not in the Bible, but these did not detract from the narrative; they added continuity and were plausible scenarios. This film respected both God and the Bible. I have nothing negative to say about it. I highly recommend this film to the believer and the unbeliever. It is both entertaining and factual.",1419379200,,546,4.639175257731959

The scene where the brothers have thrown Joseph into the pit rings very true - surely it really was very similar to that.

1132,5,0005119367,"Great movie and good adaptation of the biblical account of the life of Joseph. There are times when Hollywood takes EXTREME licenses with biblical stories, transforming them into something unrecognizable (i.e. Noah).  However, that is not the case with Joseph.  The movie stays very close to the biblical account with some minor addition added to enhance the story and to drive home a point.  It effectively demonstrated how God can take a circumstance that to us can seem evil and use to bring about good.  As for those people who were offended by the ""bath scene"", I say read story from Genesis again.  Potiphar's  wife pressured Joseph DAY AFTER DAY for sex. In order for the movie to drive this home effectively without being pornographic, it showed her attempting to seduce him while he was bathing.  Now the although this can be inappropriate for younger viewers, the reality is that it does not deviate drastically from the biblical account and it does not warrant the movie a bad review.  I'll tell anyone with very small children not to watch this with them until they are of an age where you are ready to talk to them about sexual issues.  The Bible is fill with stories of suffering, lost, pain, and redemption and sometimes these topics are hard to see on film.  But it would be an injustice to the Word of God if they were completely omitted.",1416441600,,1355,4.679324894514768
1133,5,0005119367,"Joseph is a TV movie that tells the story of Joseph from the Old Testament. It stars Paul Mercurio in the title role.
This is Biblical, well-acted, and the filmmakers are to be praised for the sound Biblical research. Although some of the sexually explicit scenes,it should be screened from the very young. It is an ideal platform from which teens can search out characteristics of moral uprightness in Joseph. The performances were great. Mercurio does an admirable job. The only flaw I could find in it is that it isn't powerful as other Biblical films and TV movies. But nevertheless, it still tells a good story of a man who never lost faith in the Lord amidst all the trials and sufferings that he experienced before achieving success in life.",1415750400,,748,4.717557251908397

1155,5,0005119367,"This epic, motion picture - JOSEPH, starring Actor: Paul Mercurio in the title role, is an engaging, true life, biblical drama straight from the Old Testament/Book of Genesis within the Holy Bible (See Genesis 30:22-24; 37:1-36 & 39:1-50:26). Written for television by: Lionel Chetwynd, this 1995 film which also features... not one, but two Academy Award winning Actors: Sir Ben Kingsley as 'Potiphar' and Martin Landau as 'Jacob', also won the prestigious Emmy Award for: ""Outstanding Miniseries."" And, although it focuses on the life of JOSEPH, it also chronicles the latter life of his father Jacob, together with his wives, his concubines, his only sister - Dinah, and the lives of his brothers, as well. From the popular ""Bible Collection"" Films of which (at this date), there are 13 available, Turner Pictures presents a Lube Production in association with Lux Beta Films and Rai Uno in presenting this disturbing yet deeply moving and climactic film: JOSEPH, in it's entirety. All, 187-minutes of it. This compelling, motion picture/miniseries, vividly depicts the willful, calculated and brutal betrayal of 17-year old JOSEPH, the 11th son of 12 brothers. Who, was maliciously sold into slavery, to appease their jealousy of him. What are older brothers for, eh?! So why..., were they so cruel and viciously envious of JOSEPH? Because he was their father's obvious favorite (Genesis 37:3-4). Sibling rivalry? Oh yeah! And, then some!! In viewing this captivating drama, one cannot help but wonder..., how it helped JOSEPH's brother's to be so jealous of him? And what did they hope to accomplish with their continued envy, scorn and contempt towards their innocent, younger brother? It certainly wasn't going to change their father's love for him. Neither, would it change the fact, that JOSEPH was the long awaited, first-born son of Jacob's favorite wife, Rachel. Nor would it diminish their feelings of paternal rejection, deep seated inadequacies and personal insecurities from which, acute jealousy, stems. But, aside from his younger brother Benjamin, his only sibling by the same mother (Rachel), the 10 older brothers and their level of jealousy towards him escalated too such a fever pitch, that initially they literally plotted to murder JOSEPH. But, due to the sanity and shrewdness of the one brother, they opted to throw him into a cold, dry, well, complete with snakes. The following morning, they literally sold him..., to Ishmaelite Slave Traders for 20 pieces of silver. Talk about betrayal, treachery, deviousness, jealousy and abject hatred! Again, was there any brotherly love, here? No way! And, they all made a profit from literally..., selling out his person. So how, did their acute jealousy help anything? It didn't. From the on-set, jealousy of another breeds resentment and hostility. Unbridled, it only suffices to kill and destroy. In this particular case, blatant deceit combined with needless treachery together with their murderous envy, sheer hatred and concealment of their vile crime, manifested itself in a heinous betrayal against their own brother. And, as if that weren't enough, they further added insult to injury by deliberately lying too their father, Jacob. How? By corporately telling him the tale, that JOSEPH was dead and gone. Because he supposedly, was killed by a wild animal. And, they 'offered' his blood stained coat which Jacob had made for him, as ""proof."" Meanwhile, JOSEPH... who was very much alive, was re-sold in Egypt by the Ishmaelite Slave Traders, to Potiphar - the Captain of the Pharaoh's Guard. So, as far as the envious brother's were concerned, JOSEPH was seemingly out of the picture and doomed to the wretched existence of a slave. And for years, such was the case. And Jacob, having lost his favorite son, along with his pride and joy upon whom all of his hopes of leading the family clan were founded, continued to grieve for his thought to be dead, son. Because when you truly love someone, their absence only makes the heart grow fonder. The years wore on..., and JOSEPH grew to become very handsome. He was a man of excellence and integrity, who knew how to read and write (most slaves didn't), and one who carried himself in a humble manner. As was pleasing to his master, Potiphar. However, for as much as Potiphar trusted JOSEPH... to the point that he elevated him to be his personal assistant and household accountant, so too, did Potiphar's' promiscuous wife (as portrayed by Actress: Lesley Ann Warren) decide, that she would take advantage of the situation and use JOSEPH's strong, attractive, physique for her own sexual pleasure. But, there was only one problem. JOSEPH refused to sleep with her. And she, incensed at having her advances rejected by a mere slave, spitefully and vindictively accused him of a most heinous crime. Rape. (Yup! All of this..., sex and all, is really within the Holy Bible. And, at the beginning of this review, you were provided with: Chapter, scripture and verse(s), so you can read it for yourself). So, what happened to JOSEPH? Well, having heard that his wife was supposedly raped, Potiphar stripped JOSEPH of his position and status, and further placed him into Pharaoh's prison. Where common thieves, cut throat's and all sorts of criminals are kept. Hardly the place, for an innocent and educated man, like JOSEPH. A man of breeding and integrity. However, just as Potiphar was impressed with the way JOSEPH carried himself and handled his assigned duties, so too, was the prison warden into whose prison care, JOSEPH was placed. To the point, that he elevated JOSEPH to the position of prison overseer, who was in charge of all the other prisoners. Years went by, and then came the fateful day when two of Pharaoh's employee's - a wine bearer and a baker, were placed into prison under JOSEPH's care. Utilizing his gift that the Lord had given to him (that of interpreting dreams), JOSEPH correctly foretold the dreams of both, the baker and the wine bearer. Specifically, that the wine bearer would be reinstated into Pharaoh's employ and that the baker would die in prison. It came to pass just as JOSEPH had stated, and having been restored, the wine bearer remembered and told Pharaoh about JOSEPH, when Pharaoh's' court see's could not interpret Pharaoh's dreams. JOSEPH was summoned to Pharaoh's Court and after hearing and accurately predicting the dreams of the Pharaoh, he was rewarded and promoted to the position of Governor of all, Egypt. Second only, to Pharaoh himself. Believe it! And what, became of JOSEPH's brother's? Well, suffice it to say, that the rest of this powerful drama is a story of forgiveness, healing, reconciliation and restoration. And yes, JOSEPH's brother's got a lesson that they wouldn't soon forget! This is a deeply moving, epic, biblical drama that comes to it's audience in color, on a single-disc, DVD in spoken English in 4.0 Dolby Digital Surround Sound and also, in 2.0 Dolby Digital Spanish. With subtitles in English, Spanish and French. And shows in full screen format for approximately 187-minutes. To say the least, it is a very interesting motion picture that does much more, than just entertain. It deals with human drama in relation too the God, that created..., mankind (See Genesis 1:2-28 & 2:21-25). Nina Kish",1409702400,2,7299,5.058091286307054

It it an excellent movie and I would not hesitate to recommend this movie to be seen by anyonr and everyone.  It really shows how God will provide for his people if only they would put him first and worhip no other Gods.  A God can be anything that you put first and foremost before the only One and True Living God who created this earth and everything in it.  If we just follow Him, he will provide and actually go beyond just meeting our needs, but will give us the desires of our hearts.  Our first desire must be to serve, and love our God of Abraham, Jacob and Issac with all our minds, hearts and souls.  No other Gods are allowed to be worshipped as the God I serve is a jealous God.  You cannot serve two masters and expect to spend eternity in Heaven with the Lord our Risen Saviour.  Please get this and watch it and I am sure you will see what I am talking about and agree.

Regarding the title of my review... yes, the bath scene went too far for me to condone (no nudity, but extremely suggestive) and it is admittedly a cringe-worthy few minutes for a bible based movie; I won't try to justify it, but since I've overlooked (and fast-forwarded through) plenty of more explicit scenes in secular movies, I'd be a hypocrite to denounce this film because of it.  If you have a very strict, zero tolerance policy for anything sexually suggestive in a movie, then my recommendation would be that you pass on this one.",1406764800,5,950,4.436781609195402

1179,5,0005119367,This film is one of the better films made about stories of the Bible.  Very little poetic license was taken with it - they stuck to the scripture very closely and Sir Ben Kingsley is brilliant at Potipher.,1401753600,3,205,4.394736842105263
1180,5,0005119367,I have seen this movie several times and bought it because I liked it so much.  This version has good acting and goes into more detail about Joseph's brothers and their thoughts and actions than similar movies I've seen.  My favorite part is when Joseph reveals to his brothers who he really is.  I cry every time.  Movie arrived quickly and as promised.,1400716800,2,354,4.571428571428571
1181,5,0005119367,"I must admit this bibical movie has it all. Passion,Suspense and Temptation. I think this is more for a mature audience.

Movies like this one help me understand the different books of the Bible and when I read each book in the Old Testament or the New Testament and see the movies that pertain to those books, I have a clearer understanding of what I am reading.  I am very careful to buy the movies that give the true meaning of what the Bible says and not some superficial storyline that goes is not accurate with the Bible.  This movie is great and a must have if you enjoy biblical movies, true to the Bible.",1395014400,2,585,4.15929203539823
1193,4,0005119367,"Very well done.  Overall it's faithful to the Book of Genesis, which it portrays.  Only in a few details it contradicts Genesis, such as:  When Joseph first appears before Pharaoh, the book of Genesis says that he ""shaved,"" implying that he had had a beard before this.  The movie, however, has him clean-shaven throughout.  A serious flaw is that the movie has Joseph's brothers threaten to attack him with spears just before he reveals his identity to them.  Also, Joseph's servant cuts the brothers' grain sacks open, spilling the grain on the ground.  Rather, Genesis leads me to believe that he simply opened the sacks and looked inside.  Also, Genesis says that the brothers took chariots laden with provisions to tell Jacob of Joseph's position in Egypt.  The movie has them walking all the way, with no chariots.

The scene where Potiphar's wife tries to seduce Joseph is a little to racy.  He's clearly naked in a bath, and she touches him.  This could have been done better.

In spite of these and certain other flaws, I give the movie four stars, since it's well done and inspirational.",1394668800,3,1097,4.7712765957446805

1197,5,0005119367,I loved this movie and had seen it many times years ago and had to have the dvd. The glorious depiction of Joseph and his devout faith and obedience in God despite his tumultuous family life and the false accusation that led to his imprisonment. We have been studying Joseph in our Sunday school class and the movie in addition to the Bible readings just brought it to life. Beautifully done.....I can watch it over and over and over again....,1393113600,,443,4.55

1199,5,0005119367,"I cannot help but notice that ALL of those who serve God have to suffer for him. Though the churches today teach you don't have to suffer, the Bible says different. I wish I were as strong as Joseph. He sure isn't a ""why me"" type.",1392595200,,230,4.021739130434782
1200,5,0005119367,"Probably the most accurate account of the life of Joseph out there along with excellent acting.  The humility of Joseph is portrayed so well and it does not stray from the true account of Joseph's life at all.  The movie spans many years even including the incident about Dinah, Leah's daughter.  Excellent, excellent movie.  I can't imagine anyone not liking this.  *****THIS IS NOTHING LIKE  PAUL, THE APOSTLE--(I believe also put out as part of the bible collection)*** which I literally threw out in the trash!

If you've never read the story or saw the movie - this is a must.  Its' stellar performances by the actors makes it even more enjoyable.  One word of caution, the scene where Potifar's wife tries to seduce Joseph while bathing is extremely steamy & sexual. That's unfortunate because other than that scene and one other scene that's sexual in nature, this would have been an excellent movie to watch with a church group.  But in my opinion, it's too steamy for mixed company and/or church viewing.  Other than that, it's an A+++++ movie!!!  The ending will bring you to tears!",1388966400,4,750,4.723076923076923

Peter Chattaway tells us that ""disparate elements are woven into Joseph's story without sacrificing the film's dramatic unity; the result is unexpectedly coherent, even poignant....[It]is about as rich a three-hour epic as one could want from television: complex, challenging and convincing, it has enough emotional power to draw you into its world and enough realism to make you want to stay there (Review: The Bible Collection, Patheos(dot)com, 1996)",1387065600,,527,5.426829268292683

1223,5,0005119367,"Great Bible movie, I personally believe after watching quite a few Bible movies like Abraham, David, Samson and Delilah, Jeremiah, the Ten Commandments, and Solomon, that this is the most accurate live-action Bible created. I watched this when I was 5 and I still watch it 15 years later. There is a bit of violence, by that's just how the story is. This isn't bloody, and the Joseph-Potiphar's Wife scenes aren't for kids, but besides that, this is great.",1384300800,,456,4.784810126582278
1224,5,0005119367,"Joseph clearly tells how God can use anyone.  Despite his background of brothers who hated him and sold him into slavery, he held on through prison years in Egypt and became the second highest, most powerful leader in Egypt.  When his brothers finally came to the realization that this leader under Pharoah was indeed their very own brother, it was then that Joseph forgave them for what transpired in his youth.  It's a lesson we can all take to heart.",1384300800,,453,4.6375

1229,5,0005119367,"This movie is a hidden gem- part of the TNT movies ""The Bible Collection.""  Ben Kingsley, Paul Mercurio and Lelsey Ann Warren star in this account of the story of Joseph, a young Hebrew man who is sold into slavery by his jealous brothers and ends up in Egypt. Due to his faith, hard work and God-given talent for interpreting dreams, he goes from being a slave to the second in command of Egypt. His brothers eventually come to Egypt when a great famine hits and they initially don't recognize him; their reunion scenes are pretty moving in this account. While there is some minor artistic license taken, this movie is very accurate to the actual Biblical account of the story in Genesis 37-45.  Even if one has no Biblical or religious knowledge or leanings, it is a very entertaining story by itself and worth watching! Very good price on Amazon, too!",1379548800,,854,4.6118421052631575

The theology in this has nothing objectionable, and I'm a stickler on getting theology right, since that's my job.  Even the extra-Biblical stuff that's in the movie is not Biblically-off.  Great theological themes pervade the movie.  Like someone else said, I could've done without the bath scene.  There's no nudity in it, and something like this might have happened, sure; but it makes me unable to hand the DVD over to my younger daughters.  I always have to watch this with them and flip by that scene when it comes up.  Don't let that deter you from buying this, though.  This is in the series done by Ted Turner.

I believe by watching the DVD over and over and even having different versions you absorb more into your memory and it can be your own individual Bible study.

Before the actual Biblical account of Jospeh running off, leaving his garment behind him, there is a scene in which Potiphar's wife joins him in a bathing room and (while he is in a pool) clearly and very erotically reaches her hands under the water and strokes his private parts.

Parents please be aware that, even though this is a family story, there are a couple of surprisingly sensual scenes where Potaphar's wife is seducing (molesting, really) Joseph.

Ben Kingsley is his usual magnificent self in his role of Potiphar which he plays with panache. Warren Clark played a sterling role as Potiphar's thuggish overseer Domo Ednan, later to be Joseph's aid de camp. A deliciously evil Potiphar's Wife is captured in brilliant detail by Lesley Ann Warren and the actors playing the ten brothers also acquit themselves well staying true to the form of Israelite tribesman

The movie begins with the purchase of Joseph by Potiphar, and his rise from that of a lowly slave to Potiphar's major domo where he captures the attention of Potiphar's evil wife, when he resists her attention and she accuses him of assaulting her, Potiphar soon knows he is innocent, and he embarks on the telling of his story of his boyhood, including the narrative of the rape of his half-sister  Dinah (played with shyness and prettiness by Mexican actress Paloma Baeza), and the destruction of the Canaanite town of Schechem  in revenge by her brothers Simeon (Vincenzo Nicoli) and Levi (Colin Bruce) Then we move to the central story whose tale baring and father's favour lead to his brother's brutal attack of him, where he is thrown into a pit and sold to Ishmaelite traders.

His rise in prison, his interpretation of the dreams of Pharaoh (Stefano Dionisi) at the same time as we are taken back to Canaan and see the story of Tamar( a pert and beautiful Kelly Miller ) and Judah (Michael Attwell). The final sequence where Joseph's brothers go down to Egypt until the moving scene where he reveals himself to his brothers is the finest.
The sex scenes are tasteful and not at all gratuitous in any way , and yes this is an adult movie, but they simply cover what is told in the Bible without going further and it is extremely narrow minded to find them offensive",1347148800,,2226,4.991913746630728

If you plan to use this with children, teens, or those unfamiliar with the Biblical record, you should preview and provide advance instruction.

1293,5,0005119367,"A movie never presents a story exactly as you envisioned it, but nevertheless, every movie version you see gives you new insights into the story.  This is a very Biblically accurate version of the Joseph story, not changing the Biblical story but rather developing it.  (For example, in this version, Potiphar believes Joseph is innocent of immorality with his wife, and Joseph tells him about his past as a flashback, not found in the Bible.)  The massacre at Shechem in Genesis 34 is included and shows what rotten people some of Joseph's brothers were.  The actors for the brothers do very well demonstrating individuality but also a group mentality, and they show powerful character change by the end.  It's interesting that the movie shows the brothers have really changed just by showing their eager attitude in blessing the name of God with their father Jacob (""Blessed be His name"")!  The actor for Jacob does very well, too.  (The actor for Joseph is fine, too, but the character couldn't have too much personality, because every viewer has a preconceived expectation of what he should be like.)  The movie introduced me to an interesting idea, which is that Jacob may have been involved in preserving genealogies and stories from Abraham.  The Book of Genesis does have a much more continuous account of Jacob's life, whereas stories of Abraham's life are like disconnected snapshots.  So what I got most out of this movie was the interesting idea that the Book of Genesis was recorded before Moses' time.",1322870400,,1515,4.929133858267717

1308,5,0005119367,"The movie Joseph from The Bible Collection is an extremely worthwhile movie to watch. As a Bible-believing Christian and follower of Christ, the main criteria for me is always the question--Is it true to the biblical text? This movie, combined with the King James language is extremely close to the biblical text and I can almost follow along in scripture with many scenes. It is very enjoyable and portrays the biblical account in a fresh, relevant way.

I highly recommend Joseph to any family and encourage any parent to watch it with their children, teenagers and even young adults that may be out of the home and on their own. Recently, I watched David from this Collection with my 23-year-old son when he came to visit and am awaiting his return to watch Joseph.

The movie is poignant and lively as it retells the story of the brothers' betrayl and sin against Joseph as they sell him into slavery. During these scenes, my heart was gripped, feeling many emotions as the story unfolded.

I believe this movie does an excellent job portraying the story of faith as Joseph rises to prominence within Pharoah's court, suffers in prison because of false accusations, and especially as he forgives his brothers. Joseph's revelation of his identity to his brothers and his reunion with his family is outstanding and emotionally moving.

The acting of Ben Kingsley as Pharoah and the rest of the cast is superb and it is best to watch it when you have 3 hours to set aside or take an intermission in the middle of it. This movie will enhance your biblical knowledge of Joseph while adding a visual dimension to your Bible knowledge.

The movie also provides a wonderful introduction with moral lessons to any child, teenager or young adult. Another movie that I highly recommended from The Bible Collection is David starring Nathaniel Parker and Leonard Nimoy. It is one of my favorites and like Joseph, is very close to the original King James text. Thanks for listening.",1286755200,,1972,4.788235294117647

It is a good movie, and worth buying and watching. Not likely to allow younger children under 10 to see it though (with out editing that graphic scene).",1285804800,,509,4.257731958762887

Although certain liberties were taken with the account as fleshed out in the Bible, these did not impact the overall telling of the story in keeping with what the Bible reveals.

1313,1,0005119367,"Utterly grievous... My wife and I didn't make it past the stomach sickening, unbiblical, immoral scene where she's grabbing Joseph's jewels in the bath. We were both very disturbed. I thought I was watching a family film, not a porno-promo. Twenty minutes later and I still feel sickened. Judging by the reviews I read by others, the film continues to inaccurately portray many other critically important facts about the life of Joseph. It's not worth watching the truth of God's Holy Word twisted and profaned for the sake of enjoying ourselves with unholy entertainment. Please do not grieve the Holy Spirit by subjecting yourself to this.

1315,2,0005119367,"This film is, without a doubt, a Christian perspective on the Joseph story. Or as one of your reviewers commented, there are messianic threads cleverly interwoven throughout. For example, nowhere in the old testament does Jacob EVER say that he gives his inheritance to Joseph. This is an obvious suggestion that Jesus, descended from the tribe of Joseph (and whose nominal ""father"" is Joseph)is to inherit Gods blessings, with Christians inheriting the covenant of the Israelites. And the scene of Joseph imprisoned in the Pharaoh's prison saying to God ""why have you forsaken me"" is NOWHERE mentioned in the old testament; it is strictly put in to provide a Christian slant. Toward the end of the movie, when Joseph goes to see his father, there is a scene in which a large number of crosses appear (briefly). And incidentally, when Joseph and his father meet, the former is shown bowing down to the latter. However, as is clearly stated in the old testament, when Joseph has his dream in which the sun, moon and the stars bow before him, for this dream to be fulfilled (as are all the others in the Joseph story), Jacob (the sun) must bow down to Joseph, not the reverse. I don't have a problem with Christian Messianic films, and I in fact saw this on the Trinity Broadcasting Network, but before everyone falls all over themselves saying what a saintly film this is, please, recognise that it has been made with a specific point of view in mind, namely Christianity, and that there are other perspectives on the Joseph story that are quite different.  I think that some honesty on this subject would raise this film above the level of Christian propaganda.",1276387200,4,1661,4.767361111111111
1316,5,0005119367,"There are no words accurate enough to praise this enthralling television miniseries.  ""Joseph"" is one of the most fascinating of biblical accounts, and I will not rehash the plot since it is done superbly by other reviewers here.  I will simply say that this timeless true account of a faithful and courageous young man is a wonderful tool to use with teenagers.  Satan has planted so much filth in the movie industry, and I praise God that there are filmmakers who still desire to present the truth.  ""Joseph"" presents a magnificent story of forgiveness and integrity that all teenagers can learn from.

This miniseries is one of the best biblical retellings in film fashion I've ever come across.  The story grabs you from the very beginning and is never dull.  Paul Mercurio is excellent in his portrayal of Joseph, presenting a teenager and young man with exceptional character.  Mercurio brings a vulnerability to this man that endeared him to me at once.  The scene where he cries for mercy after his brothers' betrayal moved me to tears.  Joseph struggles with temptations and is flawed like us all.  Ben Kingsley is excellent as Potipher, portraying a man of integrity and care.  The actors portraying Joseph's brothers are equally excellent.

Several reviewers have complained about the scene with Joseph and Potipher's wife, a femme fatale portrayed with unabashed glee by Leslie Ann Warren.  This scene is sexually charged, but I believe it is accurate with Scripture.  The Bible doesn't sugarcoat things, nor should we think the Bible hereos were not susceptible to temptation.  Although God never reveals if Potipher's wife was a temptation to Joseph, I logically don't see how she could not have ben.  He was, after all, seventeen when the attempted seduction took place.  Wouldn't any of us struggle in this area at this age? Besides, seeing Joseph struggle makes the viewer empathize with his predicament.  Anyway, I say this only to encourage you not to let this one scene put you off.  Please give this wonderful film a chance.  Happy viewing, and God bless you.",1275609600,2,2080,4.953757225433526

1320,2,0005119367,"This film is closer to the Biblical text of this account, than any we've yet seen....it's very emotional and very encouraging as well.  Long film, but not too long!  The only real problem (meaning unacceptable) is the bath-tub scene with Joseph.  He's seen from waist up, in a pool relazing/bathing, and in comes his boss's wife who's been after him sexually.  Potiphar's wife seductively rubs up and down his chest, until (WITH MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS GOING ALONG WITH THE SEDUCTIVITY) she goes down into the water below his waist and connects with his genitals (yes, for real).  Both Joseph and her are shown to react to the moment ever so....""slightly"" and then she leaves him alone until the next time she confronts him.  We had this film for YEARS and thought how awesomely Biblical (compared to any other film) this movie was, but never noticed this part until this year.  Why?  because we had younger children at the time, and so the inferred sexual tension of her rubbing his shoulders over the bath-tub/pool was something we'd simply pass by w/ the fast-fwd button a mere several seconds.  We didn't do that this year, and WHOOOAH!!  We were SHOCKED at what transpired in those few moments.  They don't show below the water, but they PLAY UP the moment big time to let you know what is happening.  For this reason, i say DON'T BUY THE MOVIE unless you can edit it.  If i had this film on VCR, i'd simply tab the ""edit"" tab on the VCR tape and i'd record a whole minute or two over that one moment (which wouldn't hurt a 3-plus hour long film!).

It's truly a shame that the film makers snuck in a scene of this degree, they simply could have ended with the woman rubbing Joseph's shoulders in flirtation (showing her constant pursuit of him) and played up the moment that way, at that time.  However, they stuck a little leaven in to satisfy Hollywood and to ""leaven the whole loaf"" with making it clear that she was touching his genitals for a bit and he was helpless to deal with the tempation for a few moments.  This cheap move by the film makers reminds me of the ""Sampson"" film put out by the Bible Collection film makers....which is TOTALLY TRASHY...taking the sexuality way OVERBOARD for the Sampson screen (don't buy it! My family was apalled!).  Again, i say if you cannot edit the movie, DON'T BUY IT.",1264723200,20,2321,4.554216867469879

1329,4,0005119367,"Overall, I enjoyed this movie, espescially its ending. The casting was great (Okay fine, Josephs former master was a white woman, so what? She played her part well I thought). Sexually explicit scenes? Give me a break. There were no sexually explicit scenes. There was a scene of Joseph in the bath being tempted by Potiphar's wife. This is no different from a man/woman dealing with sexual thoughts/temptations daily, and that powerful scene would give any Christian in the spirit a visual illustration of the pressure Joseph felt. I especially liked his line when he said to her ""please, you push the limits of my body to more than it can bear."" The other added scenes did not take anything away from the movie, but gave it dimension. I will take 1 star away only because I do not think that scene where the brother slept with the ""prostitute"" who turned out to be his other brothers wife or whatever was necessary. Besides one or two minor things, overall I thought it was a great film, and the reunion at the end was well acted.

To the critics harping on sexually explicit, blah blah, gimme a break. There were no sexually explicit scenes in the film. Everything was very ""PG-13"" if not lower. If you call that sexually explicit then you should be censoring Songs of Solomon in the Bible which gives some steamy accounts from Solomon to his ""lover,"" or better yet, you should censor Jesus Christs crucifixion, which was very R-rated (being beaten, flogged, and nailed to a cross seems R-rated to me).

1333,5,0005119367,"I love the story of Joseph.. it always inspires and humbles.. but I had never seen a movie that did it justice.. and even one that still left you (like the bible) asking questions or wondering.. (like.. what happened re Potiphar's wife after Joseph became the Governor of all Egypt.. and how did Joseph's brother's explain to Jacob that he wasn't dead after all but that they were lyings cowards who now had to come clean?) I loved that they included the story of how Tamar got pregnant by Joshua even if they misrepresented the tale of how the first 2 sons had died because of their wickedness before the Lord.
This movie is not perfect.. not totally accurate scripturally.. ie "" the rains never came but the Nile flooded"" when it only required the Nile to flood.. and the miniscule effort shown re the silos to hold 7 years grain etc etc.. but the story telling was marvellous and the starting from the middle of the tale to tell the story and adding the beginning as an insert.. all marvellous telling of an amazing tale.. the tale of the brothers, and the growth of Joseph and his relation to Jacob was excellent and well played. I have seen Martin Landau in many a movie or programme but he moves me to tears by his portrayal of Jacob and his love for Joseph. I love finding nitpicks in movies and this one has many too.. (ie the Tamar who receives the seal & staff is a different woman  than the beauty who plays her in most of the part) but overall it is an amazing truthful retelling of a biblical classic and if fairly accurate.. even the 'explicit' parts only show the realiry of the situation and any man can be moved to realise how easy it would have been to give in to temptation.. yet Joseph overcame.. Lesley Ann Warren was fabulous as the seductress looking amazing and then quickly becoming the horrid scorned woman.. tremendous.. Ben Kingsley as Potiphar opened my eyes to certain realities of scripture that I hadn't realised before.. and Paul Mercurio as Joseph with his real Joseph and emotive performance.. I found (and still find) the watching a wonderfully emotive and enlightening experience everytime I watch it.. and I watch it regularly.. it is the best of the bunch.. and a classic in it's own right. There are few movies I enjoy as much as this despite some of it's failings.. they did good in this one.. I would heartily recommend it.",1239321600,,2365,4.525700934579439

God rewarded Joseph for his faithfulness later on in his life.  We can all learn from this that if we are faithful to God, God will reward us as well.  Joseph learned that in forgiveness there is great joy and peace.  We can also learn this lesson from Joseph.  What I also learn from this story is that even when it looks like it's darkest in our lives, God can turn it around for our good if we only trust God and are faithful to Him.

 Please read God's story of Joseph, thats in the book of Geneis, in the Holy Bible first, so that you can know Gods true account of Joseph firsthand! This is a awesome, and remarkable true story, of so long ago!

 My favorite part of the movie, is when Joseph meets the Pharoah of Egypt face to face! WOW! This movie was very well done, this movie is one of my favorite versions of Joseph! God blessed Joseph greatly, and had big plans for him all along, for living his life as a godly man!

1339,1,0005119367,"The film is probably historically accurate, for the most part, except in some very key points.  I have not done extensive study on history and ancient civilizations, but I can read the Bible.  At first I was quite pleased with their faithfulness to the Biblical account, but then I believe the filmmakers departed from the written account on some of the most crucial details of the story.

At certain key points, Joseph was portrayed as incapable of standing on his own, apparently needing women to help him understand what was going on, to help him forgive his brothers, etc.  That's not the Joseph I read about.  Then Pharaoh needed women to convince him that Joseph knew what he was talking about.  That is not at all the case.  (And I am not against women.)  Pharaoh was the one who immediately recognized what was in Joseph.  Genesis 41:38  ""Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?""  He recognized that on the first encounter.  There was no second conversation with Joseph about the dreams.  Pharaoh did not dismiss him on the first encounter.

What was the point of rushing down to get Joseph when he was brought back to Pharaoh, stripping his clothes off, and having two young ladies wash him from behind?  I don't read that anyone tried to scare Joseph when they told him Pharaoh wanted to see him.  Genesis 41:14 says that ""they brought him hastily out of the dungeon; and he shaved, changed his clothing, and came to Pharaoh.""

Another reviewer writes, ""Although some of the sexually explicit (though historically accurate) scenes should be screened from the very young...""  What about single or married, young or old guys, watching practically R rated scenes?  I don't think people other than children are immune from being provoked.  Does an interest in history and Bible stories have to subject us to sexually explicit material?

And what is the point of showing Joseph's wife in the bath?  I bet they had to shoot that scene repeatedly to keep from showing her breasts in the angles from the front, and it required split second timing in editing to keep from showing her behind as she was getting out of the pool.  Is that required to tell the story of Joseph?

Some of the rest of the material might make sense if it were called the story of Genesis.  But what does the story of Joseph have to do with Judah's escapade with Tamar?  Is that really an integral part of the story of Joseph?  I think the director was glad to have a little more material, having the opportunity to show a situation with someone preparing to make out with a harlot, showing all the way up to the point where she begins to lift her dress and bare her leg, leaving the rest to your imagination.

I will not dispute that two of Joseph's brothers wiped out all the males in a city as revenge for their sister being raped (Genesis 34).  Of course many details are up to the film maker, but it struck me as being unnecessary to show those same men saying, ""Praise be to God"" (or some such similar phrase) in one breath, and then plotting to kill all the males in the next breath.  Again, I'm not sure how critical that whole incident is to the story of Joseph.  Maybe it is--I won't argue too much on that point.

And the Jacob (Joseph's father) we see in the film is not the Jacob I imagine.  He looked pretty weak, lacking in self-confidence, and lacking in confidence in God.  I don't think Jacob was quite so timid.  That's my personal reading of the scriptures.

The story of Joseph is one of my favorite stories in the Bible, but I would like to forget most of what I saw.  For me, the scene where Joseph was reunited with his brothers was weak.  What about Joseph weeping aloud, and ""the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard it.""  (Genesis 45:2)  Couldn't the actor muster up that kind of emotion?

Seeing the film did help me to imagine a little better what it was like when certain things happened.  Joseph crying out from the pit was particularly poignant.  But I would not recommend this film to anyone.  To me, it's not an accurate representation of what happened, and it does not portray Joseph as the strong man of God that he was.

If you are watching this film to get a better understanding of the Bible, I think you should be careful. I don't think this movie was written by a Christian or directed by a Christian.  I think it could possibly just be a ploy to dupe gullible Christians into watching a sexually explicit movie (with historically accurate stuff mixed in), and slightly distorting their understanding of what actually happened.  I think we should be careful about who we rely on to interpret the Bible for us.",1231286400,53,4658,4.516746411483253

1357,5,0005119367,"It's hard to believe Ted Turner had anything to do with this production. Certainly a credit to him. It's the best ""Joseph"" to date. A must see for the many Christians whose portrayal of God's man has not given credit to the true gospel. God's man was not ""full of himself,"" nor did he ever think himself better than his brothers, although his character was much better than theirs.

As far as I can tell it is biblically accurate and really brings to life this great old story.

You will see and understand this story in a whole new light after viewing this masterpiece.

I have seen this film many many times and the ending still gets me wiping away the tears from my eyes.

The sets were a bit sparse feeling, however it did not take away from the fact that this was a well-directed and produced movie.

1360,5,0005119367,"This is another excellent addition to TNT's Bible collection. It tells the story of Joseph, the son who rose from a slave to the Viceroy of Egypt.

Joseph is the favored son of his father, a fact which causes no small amount of jealousy from his other brothers. It eventually causes so much resentment that they sell him as a slave to a passing caravan and tell his father that he was killed. In slavery, he is taken to Egypt. His intelligence and honest are both a curse to him and a blessing. Through God's favor, and Joseph's steadfastness, he rises to a position of immense power. When his brothers come to him, seeking help, they do not recognize him and the stage is set for either reconciliation or terrible retribution.

The story is well done and is in keeping with the scriptures. At first, it can be a bit confusing because it relies on flashbacks that are not always immediately apparent but this is soon gotten over. The result is a good story done well.",1176249600,,967,4.488636363636363

Boy was I wrong.  This is one of my all-time favorite movies and the best part is it faithfully tells the story directly out of the Bible with very few Hollywood additions.  The acting is great.  The actors are well known and correctly cast.  Even the unknown lead of Joseph (Paul Mercurio) does a wonderful job.  Even the scenes and settings are wonderful.  Two thumbs way up!!

For fans of this movie, look for other TNT offerings in this series - Moses, Abraham, David, Jacob, and others.  Most of them are equally good - with I think David being my next favorite followed by Abraham.",1173916800,3,754,4.477941176470588

This movie is dead-on when it comes to accuracy from the Bible, which is pretty rare..almost unheard of in this day in age. It's a refreshing movie that has an honest, uplifting theme that will inspire you and your family. It could have easily been released in the theaters and it probably could have been bigger in popularity with a wider-span of audience around the world.

They included all the information that the Bible has about this period of time that is usually excluded from a traditional telling of the story of Joseph in Egypt.  This information helps explain why Jacob took the birthright away from the older boys and gave it to Joseph.  Ben Kingsley was magnificent as Potiphar and he had a great script to work from.  I felt that the attitudes and relationships between the characters was very real.  Paul Mercurio was very good as Joseph and Joseph's manner was always respectful and submissive to those over him, which always worked to his benefit in the end.  Joseph's family scenes showed a very wonderful relationship with his wife, Asenath.  The movie is three hours long because I believe originally it was a made-for-cable mini-series.

1364,5,0005119367,"This film is a recounting of the Genesis tale of Joseph.  Joseph is the most loved son of his father, and has a gift for prophecy.  His older brothers hate him because of it and sell him into slavery.  Joseph winds up in Egypt where he eventually becomes the second most powerful man in the kingdom after the Pharoah.  During a famine, Joseph's brothers come to Egypt begging for grain, not knowing that the man who will decide their fate is their brother (whom they believe to be dead).  This is one of a series of made for TV movies about important figures in the Old Testament.  I've previously reviewed several other stories in this series, but this is the best of a strong series in my view.  The acting is top notch, and I found the final confrontation between Joseph and his brothers to be particularly moving and well done.  Like many of the films in this series, it is a story about faith and perserverance.  The writer and producer did a particularly good job of fleshing out the story of Joseph from Genesis without adding lots of non-Biblical threads.  One thing that I like about this movie (and about the series as a whole) is that they are not overdone.  These aren't special effects-laden films with casts of thousands, but rely on writing and good acting to convey the tale.  The sets and the costumes are realistic and give the film a Biblical feel without being ostentatious.  The bottom line is that this is, in my opinion, the way that the Bible should be brought to film.",1172620800,12,1493,4.5055762081784385
1365,5,0005119367,"This entire series of Bible stories by this Italian production group is simply splendid.  These are relatively low cost films but they are very skillfully produced to maximize the quality of the story being told.  Of course we Christians and Jews will sit around and pontificate about every little error or short cut the movie script incurs, never the less, it is ultimately left to the actors and directors and their considerable skill to pull off what I consider to be, for the most part, some of the most successfully done Bible story dramatizations that have ever been produced on film, with or without a big budget.  My favorite is the story of Abram, the movie Joseph coming in a close second, and this movie, Moses, coming in a close third or even equalling Joseph.  Bravo bravo - Please make more!  My five stars applies to this complete series of movies - Obviously some are done a little better than others, but the effort is exemplary.",1171670400,,946,4.674698795180723

Joseph, however was done very well. The sets were historically accurate, and the filmmakers made sure to put detail into everything they did. They also left nothing out. Every little detail from the Joseph story is here, in their greusome details. Ben Kingsley does an excellent job as Potiphar and Potiphars wife is equally good and vile.

1374,5,0005119367,"This movie was very well done- one of the best by this company.  Just remember the story and don't watch it with your kids because they were very accurate about what happened with Potiphar's wife and Joseph's garment being left behind as well as the fact that she had been continually tempting him prior to this encounter.  Also, they kept to the historical feautures in that the women wore fine linen that is fairly see-through.  The only scene I remember being unhappy with was the baker beating Joseph in the prison (Not Biblical) and it isn't 3 days till they are brought out, though it may be that long till the events are otherwise fulfilled.  There were a few other minor changes like that but none damaged the historical perspective. Also, I wish they had included Judah's offer of protection to Benjamin and his, therefore, being the one to offer himself in Benjamin's place.  They show one offer but I assumed that was the other brother who made the initial offer and was refused since it was right when they got back to their father, just as the Bible portrays it.",1143417600,7,1075,4.607329842931938
1375,5,0005119367,"""Joseph"" is an epic motion picture; another excellent and inspiring Bible story which was creatively and sensitively produced. It traces the story of Joseph in Genesis and brings it to life in a powerful and compelling way.

This film did a good job of interpretation the Biblical story on the life of Joseph. The production is superb and settings are excellent. Everyone of the cast was perfect for their parts. Paul Mercurio plays Joseph exceptionally well. Equally impressive is Lesley Ann Warren who plays as Potiphar's lewd wife who unsuccessfully attempts to ensnare Joseph. Also marvellous to watch is Martin Landau (Jacob) and Joseph's eleven brothers. The supporting cast was fantastic.

Although I have read the story of Joseph, this film brings it to life and reinforces my understanding of it. I thoroughly enjoyed the film which was very well done.

The only area that one may criticize is the very white actors when in fact the people at the time were much darker in complexion. However, this shortcoming is compensated by the accuracy of the actual biblical account of the story which is rare in many biblical productions.

Overall impression: a pleasant and well acted movie that was a joy to watch that I highly recommend for those who need to reinforce their knowledge of the Bible and appreciate a well-done movie based on it.",1143072000,3,1345,4.938053097345133

I grabbed my bible just to follow along with the movie.  I particularly love the way that the story regarding Judah and his daughter-in-law is placed smack dab in the middle of the entire Joseph story.  Initially from just reading the bible I couldn't quite understand how a portion of the scripture would focus on Joseph, then the focus is taken immediately off him and it's placed upon Judah and Tamar.  Then it goes immediately back to focusing on Joseph.  God's written word is obviously trying to make a point and show a comparison.  The movie grabbed even the smallest details from the scriptures; for example the stranger in the desert that suddenly asks Joseph who he's looking.

I purchased a used movie that was in SUPER, Good, like NEW shape and to boot, the movie was inspiring, educational and so real.

I was expecting those usual blurry versions, but this is entirely different. Its a way to invite friends and know the characters in the bible and how they can relate that man in his nature is sinful and only through the Lord's grace can we only be part of the family.  The story shows the fallen nature of man---jealousy, anger etc and it also shows that God knows the heart of men and gives according to His own glory.

The length of this production (at least on the VHS version) was 185 minutes.  I plan to verify that this was not severely edited before I purchase it.  There is some hope insofar as Warners Home Video has a history of understating (or miscalculating) run times...The miniseries ""North And South"" had a run time misprint that amounted to 183 minutes--over 3 hours!!

1391,5,0005119367,"This WONDERFUL film is a total treat on every level! I admit my reason for the first viewing was strictly as an enthusiast of films set in ancient Egypt. On this level, the film is probably the best I've seen to recreate what that era must have really been like. The sets and costumes have a complete feel of reality, unlike the many  ""Hollywoodized"" Egyptian ventures. But, that's not the reward I got by the end of the film. It's as much a tear-jerker as the old Ross Hunter/Lana Turner films! And, the performances, especially that of Paul Mercurio in the title role, (WHY don't we see more work from him?), Martin Landau as his father Jacob, Ben Kingsly as the Egyptian over-seer Pontiphur, and Lesly Ann Warren as his wife, are exceptional! There is even a most erotically charged scene or two between Pontiphur's adulteress wife and a scantily clad Joseph. Most everyone already knows the story. Joseph is the favored son of his father, inspiring lethal jealousy from his other sons, Joseph's brothers. They conspire to get rid of Joseph, but can't bring themselves to actually kill him, so they sell him into slavery. He ends up in Egpyt and, over the years, thanks to his talent for explaining the meanings of dreams, rises to a position of power second only to Pharaoh. Circumstances reunite Joseph with his brothers, although they don't know who he is. The revelation of his identity to them and his reunion with his father will touch the heart of anyone who has one!

This film, though, is the best filmed biblical interpretation of the life of Joseph.  It is truly astounding with a stellar cast!  Paul Mercurio is incomparable as Joseph and deserved an emmy for his performance.  He tears the heart right out of you!

1394,5,0005119367,"Though this interpretation of Joseph's life has been substantially embellished, the heart and soul of the story remain intact, and is ultimately quite faithful to the Biblical account covered in Genesis Ch. 33:18 through Ch. 46:30.
Much of the acting is marvelous, especially Ben Kingsley as Potiphar, whose part has thankfully been enlarged, because he is riveting in every scene he is in.
Martin Landau is also excellent as the patriarch Jacob, who mourns the apparent loss of his favorite son, Joseph.
Australian actor/dancer Paul Mercurio (""Strictly Ballroom"") is good in the lead, and others in the cast include Leslie Ann Warren as Potiphar's lying wife, the always beautiful Dominique Sanda as Leah, and some fine character actors playing Joseph's brothers, notably Michael Attwell (Judah), and Vincenzo Nicoli (Simeon).
Included in this film, and intrinsic to Joseph's life are the stories of Tamar and Judah, and the horrific tale his sister Dinah, both done effectively. The only parts that are less than first-rate are the scenes in Pharoah's court; almost campy in costuming and acting, they can provide some amusement in the midst of all the drama. Stefano Dionisi is a most unlikely and modern looking Pharoah, and has the ultimate babe for a wife, the pulchritudinous Monica Bellucci. The entire film though, is always mentally and visually entertaining, and has much spiritual content. As with so much of the Old Testament, there are allegories that run through its narrative that point to the New Testament, and the story of Joseph has much of this symbolism.
Filmed in Quarzazate, Morocco, with its exotic ancient structures and landscapes, the cinematography by Rafaele Mertes is wonderful; this is a way above average production for television, and a film about a man who ""does nothing against his conscience even on pain of death"" is worth watching again and again.",1077321600,102,1886,5.166666666666667

Martin Landau (Jacob) gave a fantastic performance, as did Ben Kingsley(Potiphar), Paul Mercurio(Joseph) (which bumps STRICTLY BALLROOM out of #1 on my Paul Mercurio list of favorite performances), Leslie-Anne Down was good as Potiphar's wife, and the 11 brothers of Joseph were fabulous.  The supporting cast was excellent.
The sensitive and well rounded way in which this story was handled was fresh, creative, yet took no liberties in veering from the original story.  Although it is not as spectacular in production as THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and other such movies, this movie was more like it ""really"" would have happened complete with humanity in all of its misery and magnificence.
I can not speak highly enough of this movie.  What a pleasant surprise.  We even got a chuckle out of it now and then!",1052784000,19,1454,5.0375
1398,5,0005119367,"My God, i have never seen the story of Joseph in this light. I had no idea how commited, humble and faithful Joseph was in the bible. What watching this movie did for me is to reevalute my life and it caused me togo higher in intergrity at work, school and everywhere in my life and in addition, it made me realise how much everything i did was mediocre and how much i needed to live a life of excellence in everything that i did. It showed me that God is always faithful and that he is a rewarder of those who deligently seek him. Joseph suffered for like 13 years, but he spent the rest of his 70 something years in complete abundance in God. This movie has really been a blessing and i encourage everyone to get a copy of it. Believe me your life will never be the same.",1035417600,8,773,4.092105263157895
1399,4,0005119367,"This four hour video looks a the familiar ""Joseph"" story from the Bible but with a few wonderful twists.  First, it just jumps into the Egyptian setting.  Second most of the actors do a great job on their roles -- I want to say ""brava"" to Leslie Ann Warren for making Potiphar's wife engaging and even more scary than the original tale suggests.  Finally, the customs and backgrounds are the best yet that I've seen in a film version of the tale.  However, my ""four star"" rating refers to the ""flashback"" section of the film.  Yes, why it happens makes sense internally but did they need to spend so much time on it?  It very sad that Paul Mercurio's careers seems to have turned off onto the ""B"" grade track -- I think he is excellent in this movie and also in Exit to Eden.",1031702400,7,775,4.310344827586207
1400,5,0005119367,"""Joseph"" masterfully brings the pages of Genesis alive with the same grit, power, and passion of the Biblical narrative. The acting is of the highest quality, being highlighted by Ben Kingsley's brilliant portrayal of Potiphar. Despite some Hollywood license, ""Joseph"" remains true to the Biblical narrative, even including the sorted accounts involving Tamar and Dinah (which should mark the movie with a PG rating). It is an epic motion picture, lasting over 3 hours, but there is nothing I would have been left on the editing room floor. ""Joseph"" does have its weaknesses, yet the movie receives my very highest recommendation. In fact, it is so good, I consider it one of my all-time cinematic favorites. It left me inspired, encouraged, and in awe of God's faithfulness. You will not be disappointed!",1023062400,5,805,5.106060606060606
1401,5,0005119367,"A very moving, realistic portrayal of the story of Joseph. With Ben Kingsley as Potiphar, great casting and dialog, it makes a part of Bible History come alive. The scene that discloses the seducing of Joseph is realistic without overdo. We watched this movie with our 16 and 17 year old children and discussed it afterward.",1021680000,4,324,4.803571428571429
1402,5,0005119367,"I have always enjoyed the story of Joseph and it is so good to actually see a excellent movie version that is accurate according to scriptures. The acting was excellent also and each individual played their part very well, even Potiphar's wife.
As for Potiphar himself? the bible never said anything against him and the actor lived up to that. It is a brilliant story with so much purpose and meaning and i'm sorry to say it but, have those tissues ready when Joesph reveals himself to his brothers and when Jacob finally comes to egypt to meet him after twenty years.  PS: Better have that box of tissues nearby",1017446400,4,612,4.5636363636363635
1403,5,0005119367,"One of the most oft recounted stories of betrayal and redemption of all time, that of patriarch Joseph at the hands of his envious and spiteful brothers, is retold once again in this film.  The film's greatest contribution to the story is the deep emotion that it conveys.  Viewers will actually feel the loss, the betrayal, the hopelessness, the anger, the love and the joy that these characters experience and convey.  Less overt but still present are the supernatural interventions by Joseph's God, a pivitol element of the story and certainly not lost in this picture.  The production is simple yet effective; neither flashy nor flaunting, it simply tells the story of how God acted in the life of one family whose descendant would one day change the world forever.  Highly recommended and deeply moving.",1008720000,3,808,4.955555555555556
1404,5,0005119367,"(I am actually Rich's son, Micah) I was first introduced to this video by my Greek/Hebrew professor and have been amazed by its Biblical accuracy. In uncommon fashion, it stays very close to the actual Biblical texts, without adding any sort of propoganda! At the same time, it is filmed very well and is presented in a very appealing fashion. For once, I have found a movie based on Scripture that is accurate! I would recommend it to any viewer, especially a Christian one.",985910400,3,475,4.666666666666667
1405,4,0005119367,"Of all the TNT movies, this one is actually the weakest. But it is still a good movie. The movie covers the period before Esau sold his birthright and blessing to Jacob through his time with Laban and finally his confrontation with Laban and later Esau.
The disappointment with this movie was its over-focus on him and Rachel. The lessons God was teaching him were kind of talked about, but not focused on. The non-Scriptural parts, though, were pretty consistent with early Near Eastern customs and not contrary to Scriptural understanding. In that way, it was very good.
If you choose to watch this movie, you won't find yourself wishing you hadn't. It is a good movie and well produced. Just be sure you don't base much theology on it. ;-)
The movie is a solid PG movie.",978566400,3,773,4.608695652173913
1406,5,0005119367,"This account of the Joseph story is as good as it gets! I teach ancient history and civilizations, and have an earned doctorate in theology. I say this only to lend perspective to this review.
This film is Biblically accurate, well-acted, and the producer and director are to be praised for the sound Biblical reasearch!
Although some of the sexually explicit (though historically accurate) scenes should be screened from the very young, this film is an ideal platform from which teens can search out characteristics of moral uprightness in a character of whom the Bible has not one negative thing to say!
Kingsley (as he did in 'Moses') steals the show, and Mercurio does an admirable job as Joseph. Only Leslie Ann Warren (Potipher's wife) seems to strain as an actor, nevertheless, her performance detracts little from the drama. Especially capable are the actors portraying Joseph's wicked brothers, with Vincenzo Nicoli sterling is his performance as the wicked Simeon.
Having watched the film dozens of times with adults--as well as with my middle-schoolers in the classroom, I can say that the greatest of Bible stories is captured in all its power, pathos, and glory. Although creating a few anachronistic vignettes (such as Joseph's 'foreshadowing' Christ's ""My God, my God..."" speech from the Egyptian prison), the film also captures all of the great ironies of the Joseph story.
When Mercurio tenderly reveals himself as the second most powerful man in the ancient world--to the brothers who hated him as a youth, the words 'I am Joseph' will not fail to bring even the most calloused heart to tears.
As my students synthesized the thirty or so characteristics of moral goodness extant in Joseph into an essay, one asked why no such heroes existed today. The question revealed both the effectiveness of this presentation, and the dearth of role models in our society.
'Joseph' is both gripping in narration, and brilliant its direction. It is faithful to Scripture and well-acted. It is THE finest of the TNT productions to date, of which only one ('Jacob') was a failure.
Everyone will appreciate this wonderful story of forgiveness, but those those who are looking for the 'hidden things of Christ' cannot miss the poignant messianic threads which are so skillfully woven through the life of Joseph. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",974937600,176,2332,5.075520833333333
1407,5,0005119367,"This excellent production is without doubt the  best version of the Joseph story that I've ever seen, treating fully and thoughtfully every aspect of this greatest ever ""rags to riches"" tale. It shows very clearly  why Joseph is a truly great hero figure : Firstly, he distinguished himself  by service and respect, to God, to his human master, and to his people (in  that fixed order), putting himself a poor fourth; this contrasts sharply to  many other so-called great men of history who
distinguished themselves  through conquest. Secondly, he overcame all of the serious setbacks in his  troubled life, as opposed to most of us, who are overcome by our  disasters.
The production is basically very faithful to the Biblical  account, and even tries to explain the more puzzling aspects of the story,  such as Potiphar's ambivalent judgement after the ""rape"", or why  Joseph never sought out his father after he achieved greatness. It also  tries to show the Egyptian/Hebrew language barrier at times. The  final  parts are somewhat paraphrased, to save running time, but are still  faithful to the essence of the story.
The performances of Ben Kingsley  (Potiphar) and Martin Landau (Jacob) are superb, and Paul Mercurio  (Joseph), despite his necessary youth and therefore less experience, does a  good job,  although his ""body language"" often outdoes his spoken  one.
There are however a few negatives, such as the below-par sets and  costumes, indicating perhaps a somewhat spartan budget. Also, Joseph's  meteoric rise to governor not only features a poorly type- cast actor for  Pharoh, but would have been far  more plausible if his achievements in  organizing  Potiphar's house and Pharoh's prison were cited. Also, the  distinction between slave and servant / commoner is blurred throughout; and  the chronology of the story, with all those periods of ""7 years"",  is not always the most probable one.
But overall this is an excellent,  well recommended telling of the story of Joseph the Patriach.",960336000,8,2009,5.130030959752322
1408,4,0005119367,"I thought that this film was really good, i just wish they had made it sutible for children by cutting out a few things and putting some clothes on the egyptian women.  I really liked the  end, it was so good, best part  in the entire movie and worth buying just for that. This movie made the  story so real especialy when Joseph's brothers throught him in the pit, it  makes you realize just how hard it was for him, that his own family would  betray him.  And to the person that said that Joseph's brothers didn't like  him because he was a proud arrogant tattle tale that is so un-true.  His  brother's hated him because he obeyed their father and because Jacob loved  Joseph more than them.  Joseph was ALWAYS faithful and obeyed God. He was  sold into Egypt not because he needed to be straightened out, but because  God had a plan to save all the land from famine including Joseph's family.",957139200,7,896,4.384146341463414
1409,5,0005119367,"Considering that I am not an expert on the Old Testiment, I will spare you any in depth analysis of the accuracy of this film. Suffice it to say, I found nothing contradictory to what I learned in Sunday School.
That out  of the way... This is a wonderfully entertaining film. Although I knew  exactly what was going to happen next, I discovered that I was very anxious  to actually see how the events would be played out in the film. I was  especially impressed with the character development of the brothers. Rather  than as a group being presented as a single antagonist, they were presented  as 10 distinct individuals. It was interesting to me to view their  interaction with each other. The actors who portrayed Simeon and Judah  delivered exceptionally strong performances.
Paul Mercurio was perfect as  Joseph, and I must admit, he's rather easy on the eyes (thankfully since he  spent so much of the film dressed in just that teenie tiny little towel)
Ben Kingsley and Martin Landau are both convincnig in their rolls as  Potiphar and Jacob respectively.
With its compelling story, top notch  performances, and  bits seduction, mayhem, and adventure, Joseph is sure to  entertain, if not inspire, even the most skeptical viewers.",954460800,6,1238,4.889423076923077

Joseph really help me understand God's love and forgiveness. Joseph was rejected  by his own family, as Jesus was rejected by his own people and mankind. As  cruel as Joseph's brother's were, Joseph still forgave them and took them  back, and saved them from dying. This kind of love is the love of Jesus has  for us, and how he still forgives us, even after we may of once rejected  him in our lives.

I was in awe every time I watched it  and I would rewind it and watch it again. I would watch it and just sob and  sob at the faithfulness of this man. It helped me raise a better  understanding in faith in our Heavenly Father at all times. It gripped me  in a way that I became addicted to it. I will never get enough of this  movie.
