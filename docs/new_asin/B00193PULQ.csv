8271733,2,B00193PULQ,"Though the concept is great --and so is the scenery-- in the first part (Northern Style) there is a huge difference in the sound/volume between the voice-over (way too low) and the music (way too loud). This improves in the second part (Southern Style), and it is much better in the third segment (The Great Cities). The narration is minimal, with not enough information. Many of the locations/landscapes are not identified, or completely wrong (Santa Croce in Florence is presented as the Synagogue--a mistake that has been corrected in the third part). And too many nice places have been overlooked altogether, while lingering too long on some others (of scarce significance). Some could question the choice of the musical background. Could have been excellent, but it is just mediocre, apart from the photography--which is superb! And the exclusion of some cities (notably Milan, Turin, Trieste, Assisi...just to name a few) and regions (both in the north and the south, including Sardinia) is unforgivable. Too bad. But it's a decent introduction to what Italy has to offer.",1438300800,,1078,5.130681818181818

8271735,5,B00193PULQ,I bought this as a birthday gift for my father who is of Italian heritage.  The beauty and the music as they flew above the Italian landscapes made this DVD a 'flight' down memory lane for dad.  I would highly recommend it to anyone that has lived or wanted to live in Italy.  It will bring you back to the time when you were walking those streets and eating the foods that delight your palate.  I know I will be ordering one for myself as well.  Bravo!,1324425600,3,453,4.160919540229885
8271736,5,B00193PULQ,"Because I've been to half the places shown in this stunning, BREATHTAKING, footage, obtaining this set was a desire to recall the beautiful experience. This DVD set goes way, way beyond that. It is an unprecedented view of this aesthetic country that inspired Michelangelo, Raphael, Da Vinci, and so many others. The camera shots of the Italian country and cities draw you into the culture and climate faster than a baguette with cheese and wine.

This set offers the 3rd DVD, ""THE GREAT CITIES"", which means Rome, Florence & Naples. What you don't see, you hear about through the narrator. It's aimed for a visual smorgasbord but it also becomes educational. Florence, in this reviewer's travel experience, is the epitome of Europe condensed into a single smaller city. Rome has the Empire's antiquities, but Florence is the heart and soul of Italy. Even Michelangelo's ""David"" lives there.

The other 2 DVD's in this 3-pack set, do an equally fantastic aerial video extravaganza over Northern Italy, Southern Italy, and finally Sicily. The coastline of Italy, from the helicopter viewpoint, is something like a Disney TV Special. But even Disney could take a few pointers from this chopper's camera crew. They are that good.

There is so much to see, it's impossible to list all the detail in this DVD set. Generally the 3 DVDs in the set are the best Italy travel documentary, travelogue, or educational geography films that I have ever seen. Honestly I can say, watching these DVDs gave me a panorama better than when I was visiting in person.

I remember standing on a bridge over the Grand Canal in Venice and stating, ""WOW, THIS IS JUST WHAT DISNEY WOULD HAVE DONE, IF HE MADE VENICE."" Well, now I can say that about this ""Visions of Italy"" set. Venice is so beautiful in the pictures, you'll feel you are there. Pompeii is so captivating it's like walking through Bible times, although living in Pompeii was far from a Biblical lifestyle. See St. Peter's Square from God's vantage point. Quaint fishing villages can be seen from an angle impossible to take-in on foot, by car, or train.

Sound, narration, and music is as fine as a fresh loaf of olive bread from a Naples bakery. There is simply nothing about this look at Italy that cannot be praised with superlatives. As I said, ""It's that good,"" better than being there, in many ways.

Perfect for the traveler who's intending to go. See this first.
Already been there? Enjoy the revisit, from the birds-eye view, like I did.
Can't afford Italy? This set is 'content-affordable'. About 75 filmed locations.

If you like this set, and I can't imagine anyone who enjoys Italy not liking this DVD set, then I'd also recommend ""Brian Sewell's Grand Tour of Italy"" DVD. It is not quite as stunning with the photography, doesn't cover as much of Italy, but is extremely educational, intellectual, interesting, and amusing as Sewell presents the Victorian Grand Tour on modern roads, thus a view from the ground.

I suggest watching Visions of Italy with a baguette dipped in cheese sauce or marinara rather than pizza. After having pizza at the shop just outside the entrance to the Pompeii excavation, any other pizza is just not Italian.

I LOVE ALL THE ""VISIONS OF ..."" DVDs with their eagle's-eye camera takes, masterpieces of film.",1249862400,27,3292,4.843416370106762
