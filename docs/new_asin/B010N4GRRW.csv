8722765,4,B010N4GRRW,"Good Old-Fashion FUN movie with Howard Keel in a duo role.
Fred MacMurray and Dorothy McGuire also do a good  job of acting in their roles.
Pokes fun at the B-Western stars but is never mean-spirited.
Those of who grew watching Roy Rogers, Hopalong Cassidy, and all the others will surely enjoy this movie.",1446508800,2,306,4.666666666666667
