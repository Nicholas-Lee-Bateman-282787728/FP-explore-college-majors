3842006,3,B0023S4A12,Its a good anime for a person with a short atenchen span or someone that gets bored esily. Very good idea but just way to short for me.,1294617600,,135,3.857142857142857
3842007,4,B0023S4A12,"This is a sci-fi action with magic thrown in. It has a bit of romance, some teen-angst soul-searching and plenty of other genres blended in well enough not to hinder the story-line and in most cases help develop it. As it is a S.A.V.E. edition I definitely though it was worth the money. I'd call it average to a little above average. Due mostly to violence, I would not recommend it for children, and some situations may not be acceptable to some parents.",1284249600,,456,4.506024096385542
3842008,5,B0023S4A12,"Perhaps I have poor taste, but I was instantly hooked on this short series. So much so, I actually seeked out the original ADV release, with the three single discs and wonderful artbox (besides Bandai's magnetic artboxes, I think ADV comes in second with the sturdiest and coolest artboxes); instead of the usual black, clear or sometimes white colour case, the older ADV release came in never-before-seen-by-me light blue-like cases, which goes great with the whole dark, gothic look of the packaging; one thing good about boxed sets being released, the original material is cheaper to hunt down in the long run -- however, this double clear case 2-disc holder of this release was a nice change and surprise from the recent slimcase phenomenon that never protects the disc(s).

I also haven't read the manga, so maybe I remain ignorant; but evenso, I tend to enjoy my visual medium different than the written material, it leaves both to be special in their own right.  So I could care less if the anime takes liberty on storytelling or changes up the characters.  Crucify me.  With that being said, even after the first episode, I was attracted to and very much sucked in by the quick character development and the mysteries that shrouded around certain personalities.  I mean, come-on... an antique dealer (Lucia, a one woman Venus Vangaurd) storefront owner who takes on clients that see Virus-es (evil spirits - similar to xxxHolic) and runs a backroom where equipment is developed to fight off these corrupt souls?!?  Sign me up.

And then the sweet character girl Sumire, who at times needs to turn beserk-er (Claymore anyone?) in order to further battle the attacking Virus?  After being enthralled by such side characters as the cute soulless dolls in xxxHolic, and the battle drone soulless dolls of Murder Princess (another great 6 episode series), I was pleasantly surprised to be introduced to Laura/Lola and her twin sister... another great pair of soulless twin dolls.  Bonus.  I also have no problem with the hard-shelled bad-arse protagonist of the show ending up with somewhat of a hidden human-soft-side.  I thought the quality of animation was great, along with the recorded music and great colour palette used.  There was also just the right amount of comedic and serious moments.  The only downside to this short release?, simply wishing it was longer.",1277596800,5,2373,4.99238578680203
3842009,4,B0023S4A12,"I enjoyed this Anime collection very much. You can find other reviews that will tell you all you could want to know about the story and content. So in summation it was enjoyable.
This story did not leave this viewer with a sense of ending. There should be a second season to bring the story to a conclusion. Maybe there will be, until then, the ending of this series is only available in the manga books. I have not seen the manga story so I can not be sure it has a conclusive ending.",1253577600,5,485,4.170212765957447
3842010,3,B0023S4A12,"This anime is, to put it simple, a shonen yuri about two female friends with guns who fight zombies while one of them falls for a boy.

What a more descriptive description?

It involves two teenage girls, Sumire and Lucia. Lucia has a ""gift"", stated loosely, that makes her see ""viruses"". Said viruses are out to get her. Sumire acquires the ability too, but you won't learn how until the fifth episode or so.
Sumire meets a boy near the beginning of the anime and falls for him.

Enter trials, errors, cuteness, sadness, and action here.

I'm a big fan of the manga however the anime has little to do with it other then the basic plot and characters (even then, their personalities and character developments are different). The two end differently, in popular opposite ways, and they even begin differently. Only a few events are based off manga events.

The ending will leave you short and sad. I recommend this but only if you like the manga, or yuri, a lot. If not, check out the manga.",1248998400,7,991,4.544943820224719
3842011,3,B0023S4A12,"Some anime titles are made up of such a bizarre set of traits that all it takes is a passing glance to recognize that there's no way this could have been created domestically.  Venus Versus Virus is exactly one such title.  Here we have a gun-shooting demon-buster teenage girl with teal hair and an eye patch charged with saving all of humanity from an evil virus outbreak.  If this sounds a little strange to you, rest assured, things get even weirder once you're in.  In the mean time, let's check out the specs shall we?

Released across two discs, Venus Versus Virus contains the complete series (12 episodes) and comes packaged in a single regular-sized dvd case.  Total runtime comes in at 290 minutes and the show wears an appropriate if not slightly conservative TV 14 rating due presumably to the gun touting and semi violent themes presented.  Graphic gore, nudity, and sexual themes are nonexistent here.

Extras come in the form of textless songs and a crop of upcoming Funimation title trailers on the second disc.  Language options are typical sub and dub meaning the choice between running the original Japanese dialog or an English dubbed version and the option to show English subtitles over either track.

The story follows the exploits of the Venus Vanguard organization, or more specifically, the eye patch wearing goth-girl Lucia and her teenage recruit Sumire as they bust the bad guys with their pistols.  Bad guys in this case refers to possessed critters and people who are basically carriers of an ""evil"" virus.  Sumire, it turns out, has a unique ability in that the bullets our heroines use to kill these viruses have an effect on her as well.  In addition to being one of few who can actually see the viruses for what they really are, when shot with an anti-virus slug, Sumire enters a berserker rage mode that allows her to whip some major demon buttocks.  Still, despite this, she desires only to lead an ordinary life.

The problem is the stone-cold gothic business-woman Lucia isn't about to allow all of this talent to go wasted and hence recruits young Sumire into the Venus Vanguard sect to rid the world of demons everywhere.

The pacing is consistent if not entirely linear with some adequate flashback sequences peppered in the mix for good measure.  Visuals too are passable but nothing worth getting too excited over.  Of course, shows like this aren't purchased for visual flair but rather for their unique spin on what boils down to a character-driven drama.  In that regard Venus Versus Virus is fair as well.  If you notice a pattern forming here, it is perhaps that the VVV report card is loaded with average grades which, if you'll remember from school, doesn't get you grounded but doesn't exactly get you praised either.

The show relies upon a lot of character clich to get its point across.  Take Lucia for example, with an outwardly cold persona to hide the fact that inside she's warm and marshmallowy just like everyone else.  Sumire is your average school girl who wants nothing more than to worry about boys, zits and going to the prom but happens to be both blessed and burdened by a unique ability that makes her invaluable to the struggle against evil.  The evil in question is at times playful and has a little bit too much in common with the type of ghosts one would expect to find in a Disney-themed haunted house than the whole Buffy the Vampire Slayer theme the show seems to have been aiming for.

Dub work is pretty solid although clearly the ADV Films' English track remains on this Funimation release.  I say this because generally speaking, Funimation's dubs are a cut above the rest.  The soundtrack goes out of its way to use eerie tones and suspenseful melodies to remind viewers that this is supposed to be a little scarier than the bright visuals suggest.

In all, this is an interesting little series that makes the most out of what limited resources it was given.  Since it is limited only to twelve episodes, the type of character development and all-inclusive closure episodes are never fully established.  Instead the trip through is quite light and airy in its prose with just enough ""chicks shooting guns"" action to lighten up the whole gothic motif.",1245110400,18,4232,4.757534246575342
3842023,1,B0023S4A12,"You know, I really tried to like this anime. I love the idea of demon fighting and strong female characters, but it took so long to get to the plot of the anime that I felt like I was pulling my own teeth to get to the end, WHICH ALSO SUCKED!

3842025,2,B0023S4A12,This anime was cheap and only has 12 episodes. The concept was pretty interesting but I think could have been better explored with more episodes. Along with it being very short it didn't have a concluding episode. The ending was unfinished and didn't really answer anything. Feels like it needs at least one more episode. For all this together I am giving this a two. I would not recommend it. It just ended up being very disappointing.,1388448000,,436,4.675324675324675

3842027,3,B0023S4A12,"I came across this anime on accident actually. I got the first four episodes in a grab-bag at an anime convention, and since the whole series was around $20, I decided to buy it. I have never read the manga, but I still liked this anime. It's tempted me to buy the manga actually.
The Good:
The character development was very well-done, and all major characters were likable. Lucia is a badass, and has a dark past, while Sumire is kind-hearted and innocent. The pacing is well done (imo) and the story did not seem rushed, until the end that is. I also liked the art style a lot too. It was simple, yet elegant.
The music is this series is also a plus. The opening theme was done by Aki Hata, and the ending is performed by Yosei Teikoku, one of my all time favorite music groups. The soundtrack, while not very large, is quite good, and thanks to the shortness of the anime, the tracks did not get old. The dub is also decent, and all of the character's voices fit them perfectly.
The Bad:
The villains imo were really lame, but they did not have much back story to begin with, save for Lucith the main baddy who does not even appear until halfway through the anime. Also, the viruses which are the monsters in this anime look cliche and uninspired, but that might be just the anime, not the manga. The ending was rushed halfway to hell, which gave me a very mixed feeling about this anime when I finished. (It was clear that this anime had a low-budget though, which isn't necessarily a bad thing)
Overall: If you are into bad-ass girls that wield guns and kill demons, then this anime is a good watch. The characters are well-written, and the interactions between them are interesting to watch. The biggest downfall this anime has is it's ending but other than that all the other problems are minor. There was not really any yuri though, which I didn't care about in the first place.",1379376000,3,1887,4.425287356321839

3842031,4,B0023S4A12,The only reason this got 4 stars was due to the ending. It left me sort of let down. I found not knowing what happened to the two heroines really hurt the story. I was left wishing that we knew what came next. The plot does lead up to a nice climax but when we get hung out at the end. Other than that this was a really good series.,1332720000,,332,3.757142857142857
3842032,3,B0023S4A12,"This serie is a good example of how to trash a strong beginning with a stupid ending. The story of Lucia and Sumire against the virus had so much potential during the first 10 episode that I was expecting the last 4 with impatience, but all the question I had where never answered. You lost 2 episode on making a cake? and they spend the last 2 to explain everything! It seems like that they where told to pull the plug when there where only 2 episode left. Unless your a fan of the manga and want to see how bad it was translated into a anime, avoid this serie and buy the excellent manga(with the complete story) instead.",1303084800,,623,4.243697478991597

8349933,5,B0023S4A12,"Thankfully there isn't that big green save design on the actual product - at least, it isn't on mine.

This series is pretty paltry on all fronts. It's only a one-cour anime, and it's at the point where it can be considered a little old - so it's safe to say another season is never coming. The plot isn't anything fabulous, and the story leaves much to be desired (it's rushed and doesn't solve anything). The animation is decent, and the character designs are decent as well. Even if the characters and their developments, as well as their surroundings are, well, not that original, it doesn't distract from this anime's minor sense of uniqueness.

All in all, this is a nostalgic series for me, and I wanted a copy of it. Thankfully it was cheap compared to currently releasing animes, especially seeing as this is a DVD and not a BD (since it will also probably never get a BD release). There is nothing special about this DVD release - no commentary, and no specials outside of the usual textless opening and what are probably silly english trailers for the show - I haven't watched them.",1420502400,,1093,4.571428571428571
8349934,3,B0023S4A12,"Some anime production teams shoot for the moon and strive to create the absolute best series they possibly can, but not all kids get to be astronauts... From those who live by the bare minimum standard, we have Venus Versus Virus.
  I am ashamed to admit that I just finished this series a couple of hours ago and honestly only remember about 30% of it. The series is that forgettable. That's not to say it's bad by any means, I would stop lightyears short of calling it ""Anime of the Year"" but it was far from the worst I've ever watched.
  The story revolves around some teenage girl named Dave or something who harnesses the ability to see demonic sexual predators by somehow lacerating her finger on a piece of jewelry she found and is then recruited by some blue haired girl in cosplay that operates some sort of underground vigilante syndicate out of the basement of her antique shop.
  However much to my disappointment the two main heroines are NOT lesbians and it was at about that point I started drinking away my regrets of spending $14 on an anime without gun-toting lesbians.
  Overall I rate this anime a decent 3/5 stars, not bad but if you are seeking a deep philosophical story, strong character development or jaw-dropping, beautifully animated action sequences, you are best off looking elsewhere.",1420416000,,1316,4.716157205240175
