8343591,5,B001UFWAIY,"Absolutely HILARIOUS!  This is the kind of humor we need these days.  Not raunchy, but cutting edge, subtle sometimes over the top but always funny! Glad I bought this DVD. Look forward to the next Mike McDaniel!",1460073600,,212,4.702702702702703

8343593,4,B001UFWAIY,"Every segment of this DVD is pure crap. It's way too short. The whole thing is a terrible work (fake). Hacksaw doesn't beat anyone up. His acting is horrible. There is no real action or hard hitting interviews. I will never buy anything else with Mike involved. If it wasn't for the fact that I am a big fan of Duggan, I'd give this DVD a flat out single star rating. As for the wood chip piece of Hacksaw's 2x4... It's not numbered and the signatures are just printed copies. I kinda doubt that Hacksaw ever touched the board it came from. But as a fan, it's pretty cool to think it's legit and it gives you bragging rights to friends that don't know any better. Hoooooooo!",1426291200,2,674,4.31496062992126
