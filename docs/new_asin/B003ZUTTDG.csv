4235743,5,B003ZUTTDG,"There is much more than the simple message I am going to actually convey.  This DVD is going to move a person that is on a spiritual path or is just beginning one.  It is a brave actual account of how one man in a world he could no longer understand found out his higher meaning behind it!!!  He has the gift (he says curse too) of continually seeing the unseen.  His voyage to understanding himself is simply amazing to watch!  Definitely worth 5 stars!  Another movie that is even better than this one is The Quantum Activist. However the feel of these 2 DVD's are very different in quality.  I recommend both, and I would give 10 stars or better for The Quantum activist if it were possible!!!  Both unique in their own ways!  :)",1291334400,4,732,4.323529411764706
4235744,5,B003ZUTTDG,Finally a documentary showing what a person on this journey may encounter and that you are not alone. What I enjoyed the most was how sincere the story is and the fear that most people have when confronted with this issue. I was happy to see the part about Mara in Santa Fe and how difficult these journeys can be on relationships. Thank you Jonas and Mara for coming out and sharing your story.,1288137600,24,395,4.351351351351352
4235745,5,B003ZUTTDG,"Spiritual journeys can certainly happen to those least expecting it. Here is the perfect example on DVD. I will leave it to other reviewers here to add their insights and accounts, but what is important to me is that Jonas put it on the line, and shared what he was going through, without worrying about image. It's the honesty of his account on film that makes this a special documentary. Through the course of the documentary you will see a tremendous healing, of finally letting go of age old dogmas and attitudes, and joy at the start of a new life. Letting go resistance is at the base of a spiritual journey, and that's so evident in Jonas' honesty.

I also want to share that Jonas' humor adds a special quality that lightens the early journey. After a screening of the documentary he did a Q&A with over 600 in the audience. In reviewing where his journey was currently he mentioned several things, but I think the humor will give you an idea of what to expect in the film. He said he was careful now to avoid limiting or bad attitudes about anything...and in a nutshell, he realizes that all people are actually in the same swimming people, and he doesn't want to be the one peeing in the pool! He was infectiously kind to everyone, and now wise enough to know that everyone asking a question at the Q&A is also himself asking about himself. That showed us his awakening continues after making this film. Isn't that how we make more sense of all the entities that cross our path for a moment or as a family member throughout a lifetime? Indeed.

He said the journey has made him a softer and more loving man. You could sense that especially having seen the first years of his experiences in the documentary. The director showed us his love was there early on, but blocked and distracted by social stigmas, dogmas, family expectations, attitudes etc...well doesn't that sound like the early spiritual journey of everyone? The success of the film is that it makes a spiritual journey approachable to everyone, and most viewers should be able to relate to Jonas' transformation and perhaps set out to free their mind to create an amazing new lives even if that is their least expectation of themselves.",1286064000,61,2208,4.601522842639594
4235746,4,B003ZUTTDG,"This is a film about a young man named Jonas who is just an ordinary struggling filmmaker one day, and the next discovers he can see energies, entities, spirits, geometric patterns of light, auras and so on. Six years later, he is still seeing light energies and spirits, and has learned a lot about what he is experiencing, and what it means for his life and his purpose in life. Wake Up follows highlights (and lowlights) during the first two years of his journey, as he initially rules out brain anomalies or psychiatric disorders, then tells his parents, and continually navigates his relationship with his girlfriend, Mara, amidst this roller coaster ride of new capacities. He visits with diverse wise people: a Sufi mystic, a healer/acupuncturist, researchers, academics, an enlightenment teacher, a Buddhist Roshi, and Native Americans, all in an effort to understand what is happening. And although Jonas acknowledges that he is still learning, one thing that becomes clear to him is that this gift/curse is an ""awakening""--and that he can never ""un-awaken.""

I really liked that this film showed Jonas' process of adjusting to a radical and sudden shift in perception, didn't hype it up with ""big names"" in the spiritual movement, and didn't try to push any spiritual precepts down our throats. I also appreciated that it was low-key; these are not actors acting, this film is a documentary with actual events and ordinary people. I personally had some challenges with the sound, particularly the dialogues between Jonas and his girlfriend, where the volume sometimes dropped off or the conversation wasn't clear. And since the filming took place over a period of time, the transitions on occasion were a bit choppy. But overall this film is definitely worth watching and may appeal in particular to people who are ambivalent about the whole idea of spiritual ""awakening"" and conscious evolution.

Perhaps most significantly, this film is a welcome and worthy addition to the groundswell of spiritual awakening that is undeniably occurring in myriad ways, and shifting the consensual paradigm of ""ordinary"" human consciousness.",1285804800,10,2137,5.191304347826087
4235747,5,B003ZUTTDG,"This film shows that it doesn't matter if you're young, old, spiritual or not at all - you're equally likely to get a wake-up call that can cause you to question all your beliefs and even your sanity.

The ""call"" comes in many forms - visual, auditory, synchronicities, healings, and just plain miracles. This remarkable film  is about Jonas Elrod, a young artist who suddenly started to see and hear angels, demons and ghosts, lights and auras that scare him and the emotional stress of these experiences severely tests his relationship with his girlfriend. This is an extraordinarily down-to-earth documentary that follows him around for a year as he sets out to understand what is happening to him. It records his visits to teachers around the world, and the gradual transformation within him as he comes to terms with the gift he was given.

Depending on your openness, you can believe that there is an epidemic of otherwise sane people suddenly going collectively mad, or you may be ready to consider that a wonderful and magical awakening to other dimensions is happening on a grand scale.",1285718400,3,1095,4.876344086021505
4235748,5,B003ZUTTDG,"First of all,  i want to thank you Jonas and all the people in your world for creating this excellent movie.  It's one of the most real, honest and beautiful explorations I've been blessed with seeing.  There is so much about it to admire and recommend to others, I hardly know where to begin.
 If you're reading this review for a sense of whether it's worth watching, I can say ABSOLUTELY!
Of course, as a work of art, it is a subjective experience and may not be for everyone.  But i loved it.
I'm tempted to go further and say more about it,  but like one of the teachers in the film says to Jonas, ""keep it simple"" and  ""less is more"".
Hopefully the courage of Jonas to document his journey will empower everyone to share their story so more of us will realize that what's happening on a global scale is real.  People are waking up to the multi-dimensional nature of Life and in the end, like Jonas discovers,  THAT's a very good thing.",1285545600,27,940,4.325714285714286
4235749,4,B003ZUTTDG,It's a very interesting video.  Definitely something to think about.,1417392000,,68,5.8
4235750,1,B003ZUTTDG,"I love documentaries, and while I'm not particularly interested in the supernatural, what drew me to this one was it's refreshing perspective; a ""normal"", somewhat sceptic guy who suddenly starts seeing apparitions and wants to know what the hell is going on.

Now. Had the film's description been ""extremely boring yet thrilled-with-himself white guy embarks on a bunch of nothing"" I may have still been somewhat interested, and at least I would have known what I was in for.

To speak of Mr. Elrod's credibility would be giving this entire project too much validity. It doesn't matter (to me anyway) if he is genuine. It didn't even occur to me to question his sincerity because I was too busy wondering why this 37 year old man and his girlfriend never comb their hair. In short, we watch as the embodiment of every touchy-feely, full-of-crap trust fund wanker embarks on a boring, uninspired, lazy (as he even mentions himself at one point) sorry excuse for a search for enlightenment. His girlfriend and he attempt to use the tragic death of a mutual friend to their advantage by trying to somehow weave it into the phenomenon upon them. Their intimate conversations regarding his new found clairvoyance are self-conscious, flimsy and rote. There is almost a sense that the viewer is being laughed at for watching.

As part of his journey, Elrod visits several different experts on the subject of afterlife and the ability to see spirits. When he visits a guy sitting in a small office behind what looked like a plaster head wearing a bra I started to question these so-called experts.

Throughout all of his various experiences, Mr. Elrod has what I perceived to be a sense of ennui, and the expression of a wise-ass kid in class trying to keep a straight face as the teacher makes an example of him. I'm sure artful editing is the reason we don't actually see him putting paper clips up his nose or turning his eyelids inside out.

His girlfriend Mara seems bewildered, a little bit ""freaked out"" but passively supportive of his spiritual journey, and she's more than happy to join him on various trips due to her love of travel. While enlightenment eludes Elrod himself, Mara has some kind of impromptu breakthrough at a Buddhist-type cult retreat. She breaks down crying prompted by very little, during which Elrod seems to be looking at the camera mockingly. Like ""whoa what is this broad doing?""

As the film progressed I found myself wondering more and more about how it was funded and and why. Questions during which a good documentary one does not ask.
I grew increasingly resentful with each stupid hat Jonas wore and after his girlfriend's half-assed breakdown breakthrough I could hardly look at either one of them. It also occurred to me pretty early on that they are both high.

Finally, like all great masterpieces, there is a big finish which ties everything together. While he's driving, because at this point he couldn't be bothered to stop what he was doing in order to show the viewer, or the film itself the respect of his full attention, Elrod explains what he heard a voice say to him during his latest retreat to an Indian reservation. This ""vision"" was God ""or whoever"" telling him ""all pointers point to the same thing"". That ""thing"" was a big empty circus tent which collapses as he looks at it. He then gives a brief analysis of what he interprets this to mean but I won't bother sharing that because it was just as impotent as everything leading up to it. At least he's consistent.",1407110400,4,3515,4.743044189852701
4235751,5,B003ZUTTDG,Excellent!,1406160000,,10,10.0
4235752,3,B003ZUTTDG,"I consider myself a pretty spiritual person, yet half the time I was watching this documentary I had no friggin clue what anyone was talking about. When he communicated with his GF they sounded like an Asian person talking to a Hispanic. Zero common ground and absolutely no inkling as to wtf they were saying to each other. What is funny is that although he is supposed to be the odd one out, he actually comes through as the normal individual if there is such a thing, and if that is the purpose of this piece of work, then genius! He succeeded. Despite the fact that I still don't have a clue what from scene to scene this pack of freaks said to one another or to the world, I have to say I liked it because it's like those films you are so astounded at the useless of it, you are actually mesmerized and locked into watching it through the end. For that purpose alone, Well done amigo! You did a great job. You managed to keep me glued to the screen having no friggin clue what anyone said but unable to take my eyes off it. You are a genius of commercial propaganda and funny enough what you sold was spirituality. WOW -- Bravo.",1404950400,,1133,4.25
4235753,5,B003ZUTTDG,As advertised.,1404777600,,14,6.5
4235754,3,B003ZUTTDG,"I really like the fact that he was wanting to explore his gift/curse as he would say.
But I felt like he was trying too hard convince his girlfriend of his gifts. I wanted to tell him through the t.v., drop her and you'll be more at piece with your gifts and even able to explore them more easily.
Why try so hard of trying to convince someone? If you know what you see and what is real, why should you care what other's think. That's how I truly work myself.

I also kinda got annoyed that they almost made it seem like this was the 1600's and hardly anyone out there could help him, explore what was happening to him, how to harness it and how to work with his gift.
He didn't like the whole New Age way of thinking, but he said there was something to it, b/c smudging his house did work in keeping negative spirits out. Plus, the ending when he went to sweat it out, btw the baby boy was ADORABLE! So he has has epiphany, and they kinda just leave you there, no follow up as to what he's up to and how he's doing. They just drop you.

I don't know, maybe it has to do with his upbringing, but his friend's mom was awesome. She seemed to understand more than he did, and maybe she could help him.
I liked the movie, but then I didn't. I wanted to say, ""Drop Mara, and you'll be fine.""
But I did like when they went to the Monk Sanctuary/Monastery and the Monk, pretty much gave Mara an awakening, too.

I remember as a kid seeing what he saw, and it frightened me, my mom told me everything was demonic so everything I saw I thought it was bad.
Now that I'm an adult I know different and I've found tons of books and resources to help me, and I now help people connect with angels myself so that no one goes through what I went through.  There is a lot of help out there, now. As I mentioned I don't care to convince anyone of what I see. I know what I see and feel. When people are ready to learn, they are ready.
I understand too why he didn't like talking to spirits, I totally get him, I'm the same way. I'm like only angels, please.",1402444800,,2039,4.03960396039604
4235755,1,B003ZUTTDG,"I love spiritual documentaries and thought this one looked interesting.  But almost from the beginning something just felt off about it.  I'm not even sure why exactly, but I kept having the niggling feeling that we weren't getting the full picture.  I've never had that happen to me before.  I didn't trust Jonah.  It almost felt like he might be lying about his experience (my apologies if he isn't).

Perhaps I felt this way because I have a family member with serious mental illness issues and it's taken years (and years of doctors) to get a reasonable (not even exact) diagnosis.  So just one doctor's opinion felt like just that...  One opinion.  And even if the medical community can't help him, I'd have expected further exploration this direction.  Especially, I'd like to know  what happens when he takes meds.

I was also struck by the lack of information on his bio father's issues, which could be related.

His visits to the various gurus could have been interesting, but ended up feeling kind of flat.  Most of them didn't even discuss his specific experience.  The point of the documentary was to find an answer - to explain - but most didn't do that.  I don't even care if they agreed.  I just wanted to know how they explained it and what they suggested he try.  Most talked more about spirituality in general.

And then the end, the last few minutes, took a huge left turn.  I'm not sure where it came from, but rather than any kind of resolution on his visions, his grand 'aha' is that all religions point to the same truth and organized religion fails people.  What?  Where did that even come from?  I want resolution and explanations for his visions.  What do these things even have in common?",1401840000,4,1715,4.621262458471761
4235756,5,B003ZUTTDG,This guy is awesome and he has a great story. I'm glad he shared it. It's about time people do. He takes you on a metaphysical journey that only those who are gifted can experience. You get to see what he experiences first hand in his daily life and the challenges it brings. It's exactly what you or I would do. Then he shows you where he makes peace with his gift. I think this would help others in similar situations.,1395964800,2,420,4.197530864197531
4235757,1,B003ZUTTDG,"Jonas Elrod's movie presents to me only two possibilities. He is either lying about his visions for secondary gain, malingering, or has a hallucination disorder such as schizophrenia or other disorder in which hallucinations may present, such as bipolar disorder. The one medical doctor in the movie is real but is not given an adequate clip to give his true diagnosis and is only heard saying that Jonas' symptoms don't fit easily into any category. I suspect he was not interviewed further because he suspected malingering. His MRI gives no proof of anything, brain anatomy in the setting of schizophrenia is usual normal. Imaging is performed to rule out a mass or other anatomic cause for his symptoms. It is nice to know he is not on drugs, another frequent cause for hallucinations. There is no diagnostic test that can prove or disprove schizophrenia or a hallucinatory disorder. It is a diagnosis made on the symptoms once other physiologic and anatomic causes are excluded. There is an interesting point in the movie when the girlfriend mentions his mood swings, could he possibly be bipolar? Who knows, we aren't given enough information. To me he seems too functional to fit one of these psychiatric diagnosis. This leaves malingering or factitious disorder. This movie gives no proof to his visions you must take it on faith. It is essentially preaching to the choir that already believes seeing angles and demons is possible. It is sure coincidental that he was involved in movies and commercials prior to making this film as it helps to professionally fabricate and distribute his lie. He has financial support from JZ Knight, a well know mystic, in my mind taking all credibility from this being anything other than a financial endeavor with a target audience of well meaning faith endowed religious zealots. They will likely eat this up and proclaim the proof that this move portrays of another dimension or afterlife. And shame on Oprah for believing in and prompting this farce. I believe Jonas and his girlfriend to be nothing better than bad actors, fabricating a lie for profit. Ie malingering! Finally some proof.",1395878400,2,2135,4.983193277310924
4235758,1,B003ZUTTDG,"We see the Cornell psychiatrist state that Jonas does not have schizophrenia, we don't see him stating that the reason Jonas sees angels is because Jonas is lying about it all. Look into Jonas and his girlfriend Marci's background. Oh my! They were in the movie business! Also the pseudoscience portrayed has been refuted. This movie, (sorry I cannot call it a documentary) is irresponsible as well as unethical. There are really sick people who struggle with hallucinations and I condemn the message this movie sends to those. I also believe that giving false hope to people who have never taken a psychology 101 class or are familiar with the DSM-5 is evil. Disgusted.",1395878400,4,670,4.885964912280702
4235759,5,B003ZUTTDG,"If you want to know how it feels when you first start to experience spirit world, you should watch this movie.",1388966400,,110,4.285714285714286
4235760,1,B003ZUTTDG,"Here we have a ""documentary"" in which some guy with the passion and metabolism of a rock claims to have suddenly woken up one day with the ability to see a nonstop parade of spirits, auras and all kinds of floating things. First off, I have no doubt that there is an ""ethereal"" spiritual realm that can't be seen with the naked eye in the everyday world. However, I believe anyone claiming to have 24/7 access to this realm is either lying and/or trying to perpetrate a fraud (especially if there is some financial profit to be gained, like selling a movie) -- but I am willing to give anyone a chance to prove otherwise.

But check out his resume -- he's already been in the film business for eight years before he ""woke up"" and got the idea to cash in on this topic! What a fortuitous coincidence! Unfortunately, he has no spark, no lucidity, no epiphany or evidence that he's in awe of these bizarre ghosts he claims to see constantly or that he's even frightened. No NDE, no hallucinogenic shamanic trance experience, no sudden head trauma -- nothing that would have explained or facilitated this miraculous ""condition.""

Needless to say, as I watched this slack-jawed slacker and his girlfriend have the most mundane conversations about his sudden ability to see angels, orbs and ghosts, my fraud-detection antennae were on high alert. Even though I'm pretty good at reading liars, I'd also say they were both pretty darn bad actors (and yes, I believe she was definitely in on the script).

Fast forward through a bunch of brain tests showing no ""abnormalities,"" talks with shrinks, a trip to Italy to take ridiculous photos with infrared Photoshopped fractal-things(!!!), ""enlightenment workshops"" and woodsy experiences, and at the end he's the same dullard he was at the beginning. Don't waste your time with this fraud. For shame on all involved!",1388793600,4,1856,4.8119122257053295
4235761,5,B003ZUTTDG,"Searching through what to watch either on a service like netflix or through your own rather extensive library (if you have one) can be a time-consuming task. I generally tend to prefer the off-the-beaten-track types of films that usually explore something different that isn't normally covered by the mainstream. I was looking through dvds and found this one. The reviews were both good and bad with more good than bad. The description I read was something to the effect of ""Man suddenly develops the ability to see ghosts, angels, and demons.""... and that was it. I thought Hmmm.. it also seemed to fall into the documentary category so that got me even more interested.

Got to watch it last night. I really enjoyed watching this film and here is why:

(1) Topic that is not really covered anywhere else (that I know of) in a documentary style film. There are some variations but this one is unique.

(2) Characters are not actors but real people having to deal with something outside their world view. The viewer tags along as the main character tries to make sense of his 'new life'. Who is this guy? Well for me, he was just a normal guy - a fact that I connected to right away. I could see genuine feelings in what was going on rather than acting. The guy doesn't claim to be an expert or even know what he is experiencing.

(3) Didn't want to stop watching it. Rarely do I see a film that makes me want to keep watching it that is a documentary. I was really interested in what was going on.

(4) Takes a different turn than expected but resonated with me quite well.

I definitely recommend this film if you are interested in the paranormal subjects + spirituality. This one does something different that may have not sit well with those looking for sensationalism. For me, I could relate to what was happening and what the people were going through, even though I haven't had those experiences.

After all, isn't that why we're all here? It was touching to see Mara's transformation as well.  The movie is a good example of how seemingly tragic events such as the death of a friend and the ""curse"" of psychic abilities can often push you on the path of spiritual seeking.

Anyone who was skeptical, including me after awhile, were labeled evil. She saw demons and angels everywhere. She was ""psychic."" A mutual friend died and she soon began channeling her--and tried to set up her own channeling business.

4235776,1,B003ZUTTDG,"I couldn't agree more with the reviewer that titled his/her review ""Great topic, poor treatment"".

If you are buying a dvd on the topic of ""spiritual journey"", it's safe to assume you've probably done some spiritual journeying yourself, you've probably read many books in the 'spiritual' genre (there's a plethora to choose from) and you've probably seen most of the less-to-choose from spiritual films available. So...just bc this topic of ""spiritual journey"" is clearly NEW to those who made this film, doesnt necessarily mean the rest of us who are NOT new to this topic are up for watching a shallow, poorly edited, directionless film.

I must say I really couldn't help but feel this 'spiritual film' was ... fairly UNSPIRITUAL (in fact, it wasn't really even 'moving' - except where Jonas' girlfriend Mira sees clearly how unsupportive she's been with Jonas (goodness, what a self-righteous, tanty-throwing, left-brain dictatorial little pain in the arse she was until this time!)... In fact, even the head Buddhist Monk hints at the shallow-ness of this journey, during the film, saying something along the lines of ""Well, mystical experiences are one thing, but the REAL FUEL for REAL EXPANSION towards spiritual enlightenment is suffering"".

Sure you feel for Jonas and his girlfriend Mira - they seem so very out of their depth - but ... they don't actually come very far in their journeying do they?  For me the film was sorta like if you made a film about  being given a really slick hotrod (visions, apparitions etc), and then spending a lot of time looking and talking about the finish of paintwork (visions, apparitions)...and then deciding you must have been given the hotrod, with all this great paintwork for the sole purpose of entering a particular race (called ""spiritual journey"") and crossing the finish line (named ""enlightenment"") ...and talking a lot, a lot, a lot about that finish line without really saying anything at all ...and then rolling the credits before you've even sat in the hotrod and turned the engine key!  Kinda frustrating for an audience member to be dragged on such a pointless journey!

Further, this is definitely my ego speaking, but nonetheless I must make comment that my own spiritual journey (4 years in) seems to have more momentum, exploration and expansion (4 to the floor!) in ideology than jonas' ... so given that, how could you possibly find this a fulfilling movie? Point being: I cant help but think other audience members will also be arriving with their own spiritual journey in fully fledged high-definition panoramic scope, and will also find this movie a bit ""Enlightenment-not-really-just-kidding-like-really-sooooo-kidding!""...ah...annoying.

Look, to be fair, they probably just filmed themselves too early. If I know anything about spiritual journeying, it's that you don't wrap it up in a year (ridiculous for them to even try! i mean you don't wrap up spiritual journeying in a lifetime! It's eternal!)... but certainly the longer period of time that passes, the more profound the discoveries - the 'epiphanies"" of yesterday quickly become old-news-and-limited when today's epiphany overlays them. So probably, they just should have waited. But given that they didnt, I guess now it will be interesting and something to look forward to in a few years (like 10!) if Jonas & Mira were to then film 'where are they are on that spiritual journey now""... Meantime, I wouldn't recommend this dvd to anyone who long ago separated gnosis from religion, that's all it's about. Beginners' ephiphanies.",1328918400,17,3564,5.132758620689655
4235777,3,B003ZUTTDG,"I like to support spiritual cinema and I would love to see more. Plus, the subject matter is fascinating. For these reasons I would have loved to have given this a great review. The videography, sound, lighting and production is somewhat lacking - which is ok when there are budgetary constraints - and this isn't what warranted the low rating. All of this can take a back seat to content. And I wasn't particularly bothered by how slowly it moved - except, it never went anywhere leaving a very dry and abrupt ending.

The story is about a guy, a normal bloke one day, who wakes up able to see aberrations. Unfortunately, very little is really said about his experiences, which are the most fascinating part of the movie. Instead, the focus of the movie is on the problems it caused him and how it effected his life, most of which involves his fairly self-centered girlfriend. Seriously, at one point you're wondering when he will realize he could do so much better with a more supporting partner?

This is basically a video taken with a hand-held camera following him around as he seeks some answers that never seem to come. (He sees a doctor to rule out a brain tumor...seeks the advice of several spiritual advisers, that sort of thing.) Even this might have worked for me had they at least edited it in the correct timeline. His and his girlfriend's hairstyles go through some radical changes over what appears to be a long stretch of time - perhaps a year or more -  making it evident that the scenes are constantly reverting back and forth in a random timeline. This results in the viewer having to mentally sort out the timeline which finally gets so confusing you just don't care any longer. Very sloppy editing - like they followed this guy around for a year and then randomly pieced together the footage completely out of order.

It would have been much more interesting to see how he evolved with his new-found phenomenon over the time period covered; and I would liked to have seen more of an explanation about what the aberrations were all about - did he see dead people... did he see angels...what? Not much is said about any of this, only his confusion over it. And in the end the viewer is left feeling more confused than he.

In summary, I think  a good editor could put together something from all the footage they have that might be interesting, but only as a segment to another documentary on the same subject. This film really does not have the meat it needs as a stand-alone documentary. What little was said could have been done in a 20 minute youtube video.",1326067200,32,2582,4.565874730021599
4235778,1,B003ZUTTDG,What a huge disappointment! We thought this was to be more informative. It was just a whining girlfriend ( no point to her being part of this dvd) the experts in this dvd was the only reason to watch it,1324857600,14,202,4.075
4235779,5,B003ZUTTDG,"Clairvoyance (seeing spirits) and clairaudience (hearing spirits) are, of course, not new - however it is unusual (in my reading) for an adult, such as Jonas, to suddenly, overnight have these abilities - typically the individual has these abilities as a child and then progresses from there (such as Mary Ann Winkowski or Lorna Byrne, to name a couple)...

Jonas experience was certainly dramatic - for him, for sure, but for anyone to suddenly experience such...  It took Jonas seven years, or so, to come out of the closet, so to speak - and to have the capability of producing a documentary about it, is to say the least, quite extraordinary - I am now curious to know how many other ""Jonas"" are there out there ...

Also, if Mary Ann, Lorna and Jonas have this capablility - ""why not anyone"" ...

I like to think of it as Radio or TV waves - which are around us all of the time, but it takes a special ""receiver"" (radio or TV) to use these special ""waves"" ...

Again, from my reading, it seems that, unfortunately, ""Western science/materialism"" shuns this whole topic like the plague - however, I also read that scientists in the ""Spirit World"" are continually working to bridge the ""Veil"" - to be able to ""communicate""  more directly and more easily - I, personnlly, will be very disappointed if within the next year or so, there are not dramatic breakthroughs in this area - ""Jonas experience"" may well be one of the ""cutting edges"" of this development ...  FYI:  many of the technological breakthroghs in our materialistic world actually originated in the ""Spirit World"",  i.e., electric motor/Tesla,  Xerox/Carlson, etc. ...

There are many discussions, as you know, around the year ""2012"", so hold on and keep alert (""Listen"", and ""Pay attention"")...

If you are new to this general area, let me toss out a few names (of which there are many) to get you started in your reading and viewing:  Allan Kardec,  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,  Edgar Cayce,  Arthur Findlay, Carl Wickland, Victor Zammit, Leslie Flint, Silver Birch, William Stead,  Mike Tymn,  Stafford Betty, Michael Cocks, Gary Schwartz, Julie Beischel, August Goforth, Edith Fiore, Craig Hogan,  Jeffrey Long, Nanci Danison,  Terri Daniels (these just happen to be a few of my favorites)...

Bottom Line:  The ""Spirit World"" is very real, ""Do not fear death"", and ""The Soul is Eternal"" for everyone ...

4235780,5,B003ZUTTDG,"I first saw this on OWN network,  and then bought it on Amazon. This was such a great film, it was done well and you could really relate to Jonas and his girlfriend. I've watched it twice and had insight to something different both times. Jonas was just a regular guy who had this amazing experience/epiphany and he takes you on his journey of embracing this gift. It was so inspiring .. I wish there were more films like this.",1322438400,,427,4.3375
4235781,5,B003ZUTTDG,"I think whatever you might believe about how we got here or even what happens when we leave you would have to admit that the energy of indviduals with us now and those who have passed on are still around us. It's like going to a familiar place and being greeted with the memories and significance that it has in our lives. That is what I got from Jonas Elrod's journey in WAKE UP. Though he is able to see things that maybe most of us have not experienced, it is the feeling of something more than just us around that gives us that common thread.

There were alot of things about the project that seemed to allow us to explore openly what we really believe about death and those who might still be with us in one form or another. I think one thing that those who watch the film will see, however, is how important it is that we are in tuned with the person that is us and not lose sight of the fact that there are bigger things in the world than just what we see.

Admittedly this is a scare thought as well as a sobering one for all of us. Why? Well, in my opinion no one likes to feel as though they are ""less than"". For me, however, admitting that there are things in the world I don't fully understand is humbling. Whether you believe that everything happens for a reason or not, you will have to admit that things that do happen to us have a way of affecting not just the way we see the world today but at all times.

WAKE UP is that kind of film that will encourage you to think and explore a world that is not too far from us. Definitely something you are going to want to watch, review and reflect on.",1320192000,,1609,4.069400630914826
4235782,5,B003ZUTTDG,"I heard about this movie through a visual effects company I worked for about 4-5 years ago as Jonas's people were trying to find a company that would provide the VFX for the movie (i.e..  create the visuals to relay what Jonas was feeling or seeing).  If his people had never approached our company, I probably would have never seen this movie.  I'm glad they did as they seemed honest, good people when we spoke with them.  And having had similar experiences to Jonah in my life, my Creative Director at the time insisted I meet with them.  I can tell you that this is real.  And that this documentary was done very well.  Kudos for Jonah for having the gumption to approach this subject with intelligence and integrity.  It's a great movie and very well done.  Highly suggested to anyone who is in the process of... or ready to ""wake up.""  I only wish that this movie was marketed a bit more so that the masses could know it's out there and enjoy it.

4235783,5,B003ZUTTDG,"I saw this movie three nights ago, with the director/star in attendance.  I'll preface to say that I found him exceedingly humble, well-intentioned and earnest. Oh yes --- and VERY talented.

This documentary is extremely well made and worth anybody's interest based on style and technique alone.  But it's the substance that makes this film magical.

In a nutshell, Jonas woke up one day with the ability to see spirits, energies and all manner of paranormal phenomena.  Nothing particularly significant preceded this event; the date of his ""awakening"" seems random enough, all things considered.  He also didn't know what to do with this ability, and the film documents closely what happens as he embarks on a journey to find the relevance of these particular signs and wonders, and also to find peace beyond that.

The entire movie is beautifully poignant, astute and illuminating.  I honor very much how Jonah engages us along the continuum of his individual enlightenment: moving from his fixation on his own ""signs and wonders"" to his discovery of what his life truly is about --- which, it seems, involves being connected to that which is ""Higher Than I"" --- and being okay, REALLY OKAY, with just who he is and what he is here to do.

They also do a good job of pointing out how common ghost sightings are. We all know people who have had firsthand experiences with ghosts, if not ourselves.

If I'm wrong, I wish him and his family all the best. And regardless of any powers, working on spirituality is brave and important.
The fact that he was a film maker before anything happened to him also made me put my guard up. Getting J.Z Knight in the film only made things worse, she's so dicey, and finding that out is only a google search away... did he do that?
