1751044,4,B00006FDB1,When I got the dvd I thought It was broken because the dvd fastener was broken and the dvd was rattling around in the case.  No visible scratches but not happy about the way it arrived,1353369600,,184,4.111111111111111
1751045,5,B00006FDB1,"I love the Honeymooners.  I have all the black and white episodes on dvd or vhs tape.  I gave this DVD as a gift but have these episodes on dvd and vhs too.  So, as far as content, if you like the honeymooners or like classic tv, you will love these episodes.  Heart warming, funny and safe for the whole family to watch.  I miss timeless classics like these.  This is when comedy was clean, fun and inventive.  The writers were creative and didn't need sexual innuendo to try and get a laugh.  These episodes are a staple for our household to watch every christmas or just when we want to laugh or have the Christmas feeling.",1297814400,2,626,4.2905982905982905
1751046,4,B00006FDB1,"We only watched it once, and only one episode was Christmas themed. We still enjoyed it. All Honeymooners and Gleason fans will too.",1296777600,,132,4.782608695652174
1751047,2,B00006FDB1,What was funny many years ago is not funny anymore. The Honeymooners had been my favorite TV show for years but I found it silly and boring as did my husband. It mainly centered about Jackie Gleason playing all the characters he was famous for- all in one episode. Even Art Carney wasn't funny. There are several other episodes on the DVD but I doubt if we will watch them and it will probably be donated to the public library. We were all ready for a good laugh but when the laughs came they were almost forced.,1293408000,,512,4.288659793814433
1751048,4,B00006FDB1,"This cool video includes four episodes of the Honeymooners, each dealing with a different holiday: Christmas, New Year's, Thanksgiving and Election Day (!!!). The first one though really highlights Gleason's talents as a comedian, giving him a chance to do several characters from his other program. A really fun show!",1292976000,,318,5.38
1751049,3,B00006FDB1,"This DVD has two Holiday classics and two bonus classics. If you have the The Honeymooners - Classic 39 Episodes (1955)  There is no need to buy this DVD, the episodes are already on the  The Honeymooners - Classic 39 Episodes (1955)",1264032000,37,233,4.523809523809524
1751050,5,B00006FDB1,"This DVD collection is great.  Jackie Gleason stepped into all of his wonderful characters in this wonderful Christmas themed sketch from his weekly variety show.  On hand were the wonderful Art Carney, Audrey Meadows and Joyce Randolph who were the perfect supporting players.  Frances Langford and the Dorsey brothers are terrific guests.  This is a fine collection for any fan.  The bonus episodes are wonderful too...especially the one where Ralph and Alice are on opposite sides during a local election.",1242518400,11,508,5.3
1751051,5,B00006FDB1,"For those collecting the Honeymooners DVDs take note that this is just a re-packaging of individual Volumes 3 & 4 or the second half of the Boxed Set Collection #1.
You will only duplcate what you already have.
I give it 5 stars because the episodes are classic live TV mastered from the original kinescopes.",1047254400,107,308,4.618181818181818

1751113,4,B00006FDB1,"Actually, I was hoping for more material from the Jackie Gleason show itself, along with skits from Joe the Bartender.  Would love to find a complete series of all episodes of the Jackie Gleason show both from New York and Miami Beach.  This DVD is great for anyone who has not seen the Great One in action.",1399420800,,307,4.368421052631579
1751114,5,B00006FDB1,I LOVE The Honeymooners!!  I also love it when I find episodes that I have never seen.  They are so funny!!,1359331200,,107,4.0476190476190474
1751115,5,B00006FDB1,"I owned this on VHS but wanted to have it on DVD.  This is definitely a classic we watch it every Christmas.  Jackie Gleason portrays several of his characters in the Christmas Eve first show.  Reginald VanGleason is the best, we crack up everytime we watch it.  Also, the Poor Soul who has nothing, the Beer Delivery man who goes to the wrong apartment. Too much fun definitely want to see this one.  Plus the DVD had bonus shows we never saw before with Jimmy & Tommy Dorsey performing.",1357084800,,488,4.438202247191011
1751116,2,B00006FDB1,"I haven't watched the whole dvd yet, but after watching the Christmas one I'm not interested. The only thing I did like were the differant parts Jackie Gleason played. This was supose to be a Christmas show, but it certainly didn't seem like a Christmas show to me. This was a gift for someone and after watching it together we were both VERY diasppointed!",1356652800,,356,4.578125
