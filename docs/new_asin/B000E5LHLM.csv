8105982,4,B000E5LHLM,"This is a superb performance, perhaps the best on record, CD and DVD. No other bass rivals Meven in the role of Frier Lawrence. Other soloists and conductor are at their best. The only drawback is the 4:3 format and stereo only sound.",1357257600,,234,4.465116279069767
8105983,3,B000E5LHLM,"The composer's infatuation with Shakespeare is well known, but it did not always translate into great musical creativity. One has only to think of his operas King Lear, Hamlet, and Beatrice and Benedict. What one can say is that he derived a great deal of his inspiration from poetic literature in general, and those works NOT inspired by The Bard were often greater than those that were: Nuits d'Ete (Theophile Gautier), Damnation of Faust (Goethe), Harold in Italy (Byron) and The Trojans (Virgil). His Romeo and Juliette is a much less persuasive presentation of the celebrated tragedy than Gounod's opera or Prokofiev's ballet, and yet from its first performance it seems to have evoked an enthusiastic response from serious critics that to my mind borders on the absurd. Some of these notions have been regurgitated by a number of Amazon reviewers whose opinions I hold in considerable respect. That it can be classified as a Symphony at all is debatable: the form is much closer to that of an Oratorio or secular Cantata. The claim that it is a worthy successor to Beethoven's 9th lacks any justification. The subject matter of the two are chalk and cheese. The choral movement of the latter, despite the disdain in which it is held by some enthusiasts of Brahms' 1st Symphony, is one of the most thrilling, universally compelling, and beautifully crafted scores for voice and orchestra in the entire musical repertoire, where each of the two are alternately dominant to and subservient to the other. Berlioz has skillfully managed in this work to make the chorus an impediment to the dramatic and musical impact he generates in his orchestral writing.

The music does indeed work best as a dramatic symphony. The orchestral music is never less than stunning, and it provides a tour de force for every instrument. Although it is clearly ""program music"", its story is known by every school child, and does not need an explanatory chorus any more than Beethoven's 6th or Strauss's Don Quixote. Its haunting melodies live on in the memory long after the performance. The introduction of the chorus is worse then a distraction; it is an irritation, telling us what we already know well in phrases without poetic beauty (the libretto was originally written by Berlioz), and in music devoid of any melody. I challenge the 5-star reviewers to hum a single tune attributable to the chorus. It is clear that Berlioz himself didn't know what to do with it. Initially, only 13 singers take the stage; later, the chorus or part of it sings off stage; finally, all the empty seats on stage are filled with singers clutching their scores. The role of the soloists is also bizarre. Hanna Schwartz summarizes the plot in the manner of a Greek chorus ( but then we already have a chorus!), delivering the dull music with a distinct lack of conviction. Philip Langridge's task is to spoil the Queen Mab scherzo with his tenor interjections first time round; fortunately we hear it later from the orchestra without interference when the brilliance of its orchestration can then be appreciated. Peter Meven is the only one of the trio fulfilling a dramatic role ---- that of Friar Laurence ---- in the final passages, where he sings very well and does a good imitation (no fault of his) of Kofi Annan pleading with both the Regime and the Syrian rebels to lay down their arms and stop all the slaughter.

So, back to the orchestra that provides all the joy there is in this disc. The music is Berlioz at his best, unsurpassed by any other master of the Romantic movement. It is well played, although I have heard better in the concert hall, notably from Maazel and Dutoit with the Berlin Phil and the Montreal Symphony, respectively. The sound quality is good for its era, and so is the camera work (unattributed). It was good to see Sir Colin from the front; previously I have only seen his back in a live concert and did not realize that his instructions to his players are issued more often by his mouth than his baton. For those who really want this wonderful orchestral score in DVD format, there doesn't seem to be any alternative. As Du Maurier's curate said in the famous Punch cartoon of the bad egg he had been offered: "" Parts of it are very good indeed!""",1334275200,,4252,4.7523680649526385
8105984,4,B000E5LHLM,"I'd have to agree with those who were just a bit critical of this.  Davis' commitment and musicality are beyond reproach, but Hanna Schwarz, while a fine singer, just seems to be a bit dry in places where her sound should be luscious.  Her part needs to feel more Mediterranean, I think.  Berlioz was nothing if not a juicy composer.

Despite this, a satisfying release overall.  The love scene is pretty overwhelming.  Davis seems determined to coax the entire orchestra into the Englischergarten for an afterparty.",1333584000,,516,4.941860465116279
8105985,4,B000E5LHLM,"I almost gave this 3 stars because of inadequate camera work in the Queen Mab Scherzo.  Views were limited and fixed -- the first few stands of violins for the strings that didn't even show them playing the harmonics, and no cellos in the Strophes.  I'd also hoped to see the antique cymbals, but, no, we got lots of conductor instead.  Berlioz's astonishing and very fast-paced orchestral details seemed underrepresented.

But, this great work is an important addition to the DVD catalog.",1296691200,2,489,4.926829268292683
8105986,4,B000E5LHLM,"Dramatic symphony? Ballet without dancers? Hector Berlioz's ""Romeo et Juliette"" is effectively a genre in itself, and a bold experiment in musical structure, especially considered that it was premiered in 1839. At 100 minutes, it's almost twice the length of Beethoven's Choral (9th) Symphony, which was surely the musical 'model' for Berlioz's conception. On the other hand, the French productions of Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"" that Berlioz could have seen were all abridged and simplified, and the earlier opera based on the play - Bellini's 'I Capuletti ed i Montechhi' - was ridiculed by Berlioz as ""vulgar, ridiculous, weak, and empty."" To my ears, however, Berlioz's grandiose symphonic expression has very little to do with Shakespeare's ambiguous tragicomedy. It isn't a depiction of the action of the play, but rather a set of commentaries or observations on the narrative situation, sung by three soloists and a chorus. Only the third soloist, the basso, clearly represents a party to the action in Verona, identifying himself as the priest who married the already dead young lovers. The emotional 'narrative' belongs entirely to the orchestra.

One can make a case that ""Romeo et Juliette"" really does adhere to the four-movement structure of the classical symphony, and then expands that structure with a fifth movement. Most listeners, at home or in a concert hall, will probably scoff at such formalism; there are clearly fourteen segments, with full-stop cadences, some of which include the voices and some of which are purely orchestral. It's a difficult work to unify in interpretation, in other words, and one in which the parts are always clearer and more affective than the whole. I expected to find that hearing/seeing it on this DVD would surmount the difficulty of unity, but I can't declare that such was the case. Conductor Colin Davis has a large reputation as an interpreter of Berlioz, but honestly I didn't enjoy watching him on the podium. He looks much like an electioneering British Member of Parliament. The enormous forces of the  Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra responded to his rather stagey conducting with impressive ensemble discipline, but the total 'sound' of their 20th C instruments was, to my ears, throttled and staid. You might want to watch the DVD of ""Les Troyens"" with John Eliot Gardiner conducted his orchestra of period instruments. Gardiner is visibly more engaged in the music, and the lines of orchestration are much more excitingly transparent.

This DVD is certainly worth hearing and seeing, but it's weakened by the slurry, muffled singing of the Bavarian Radio Chorus and by the awkward singing of alto Hanna Schwarz: unshaped phrases, uncertain tuning, unimpassioned affect, and execrable pronunciation of French. Fortunately, hers is a brief role. The enunciation of the chorus, by the way, is just as execrable; only basso Peter Meven achieves intelligibility in his French declamation.

Is it worthwhile to choose the DVD format over any of the CDs available, including recordings by Colin Davis? That will depend primarily on your home sound system, supposing that you have one set-up for DVDs and another for CDs. This is very BIG music; it can barely be crammed through any digitalization or any speakers. Frankly, if there's any chance of hearing ""Romeo et Juliette"" live in concert, that will be worth ten times what you'll hear electronically.",1279065600,4,3421,5.203266787658802
8105987,5,B000E5LHLM,"This recording captures the climactic moment of Colin Davis' tenure as director of the Bayerischen Rundfunks Symphonieorchester (from 1979 onwards), when the orchestra took residence in their new home. This performance of Berlioz' ROMO ET JULIETTE took place officially to inaugurate the Philharmonie Mnchem am Gasteig on the 22nd of November in 1985. Americans had a chance to see it first as a PBS Great Performances telecast on the 1st of November in 1988, and then it became available as a Pioneer Artists laserdisc in 1992.
There was another laserdisc on the London label with Solti conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in just the orchestral movements of this work (53 minutes) in 1977. Neither sound nor picture could match the Munich recording.",1227916800,7,757,5.213114754098361
8105988,4,B000E5LHLM,"Sir Colin Davis is well-known for his superb recordings of all of Berlioz' orchertral music. He made two excellent,  classic recordings of this ""Dramatic Symphony"" inspired by Shakespeare's play, one with the London Symphony in the 1960s and again in the 80s with the Vienna Philharmonic.  The current live performance with the Bavarian Radio Symphony and Chorus is quite similar to the two older studio audio recordings, and, of course, the DVD sound is superior. The video quality is also very good, crisp and clear. The only quibble I have (and it's certainly minor) is that a DVD should have additional material (either rehearsal material or information about the music provided by the conductor, in this case, an expert in this area). Another possibility is that we could have been presented with extra video material of, say, actors miming some of the action of the play while the music presents the drama in musical but also very suggestive terms.  But, otherwise, as I said, this is an excellent music DVD.",1205366400,2,1014,4.952941176470588
8105989,5,B000E5LHLM,"Berlioz's dramatic symphony Romeo et Juliette is regarded by many as one of his finest and most original works. This piece was admired by many, like Richard Wagner, Who sent a copy of his opera Tristan und Isolde to Berlioz with a dedication: ""respectfully, to the composer of Romeo and Juliet"". It is easy to understand Wagner's admiration for the symphony, especially for the wonderful adagio, the love scene, that has much in common, in the profoundness and broadness of expression with Wagner's music.

Arthaus released a few months ago, a DVD with an outstanding performance of this symphony. This performance was recorded live at the Kulturzentrum Gasteig in Munich (1985). Sir Colin Davis conducts the Bavarian Radio Orchestra and Chorus. Davis is undoubtedly one of the greatest Berlioz conductors of the last fifty years. While watching him conduct, his absolute acquaintance with the score is clearly evident. Nothing escapes him and every little detail of the work is shaped with much care and love. The orchestral and choral execution is beyond reproach.

The highlights of the performance are: the mezzo wonderful strophes `Heureux enfants aux coeurs de flamme' to an accompaniment of a harp and later with a beautiful counter melody in the cellos. It is sung here with much expression and sensitivity by the German mezzo Hanna Schwarz. The very short vocal scherzo `Bientt de Romo la ple rverie' is done idiomatically by tenor Philip Langridge and the chorus.

Then the four orchestral movements that follows: `Romeo alone' - a beautiful reflective adagio that begins with a chromatic melody that reminds us the beginning of the orchestral interlude `Royal Hunt and Storm' from Les Troyens and gives a strong feeling of loneliness and anticipation. Then comes the brilliant and flamboyant Ball at the Capulets. Davis delivers this music with much panache and excitement. Than follows the great adagio, which is the greatest part of the symphonie. This is a poetic and noble performance. Watching Davis conduct at this point reinforce immensely the experience. Davis interpretation of the next orchestral movement - The Queen Mab Scherzo has liveliness and airiness as needed and the orchestral playing is precise and transparent.

The finale is dominated by the bass. The singer is new to me: Peter Meven. French diction is not perfect, but the singing is very good. The symphony is ending with the conciliation between the rival families. The bass soloist begins the oath `Jurez donc par l'auguste symbole'. The chorus joins in and the music grows to a gigantic fortissimo that in this visual performance has an immense effect on the viewer while watching Davis total involvement with the music.

It was a thrilling experience for me, as a devoted Berlioz fan, but I am sure that this DVD will bring much pleasure to any lover of good romantic music. Picture and sound quality are very good. Highly recommended!!",1149465600,18,2927,5.089583333333334
8105990,5,B000E5LHLM,"Sir Colin Davis has recorded the Berlioz 'Romeo et Juliette' several times on CD, most particularly with the London Symphony and with the Vienna Philharmonic. Interestingly, the chorus on the VPO recording is the same one used here, that of the Bavarian Radio Symphony. Those recordings, wonderful as they are, would be in some minds superseded by this DVD of a performance by the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, along with soloists mezzo Hanna Schwarz, tenor Philip Langridge, and bass Peter Meven -- superseded because some have come to prefer seeing as well as hearing a concert. Certainly one's attention is engaged more strongly with the visual element. I suppose that is one reason opera DVDs have become so very popular in the last few years. As far as I know, this is the only 'Romeo et Juliette' available on DVD. And considering that the performance, the sound and the video are all superb, it's hard to imagine another one coming along any time soon. (The last time I made such a prediction, there was a new version of a fairly rare work within a couple of months!)

'Romeo et Juliette,' even though we've had more than 150 years to absorb it, continues to amaze and confound. The first question in some minds is 'what is it?'. Berlioz called it a 'symphonie dramatique,' and indeed it has some elements of the classical symphony. But, modeled as it was on Beethoven's Ninth, it has chorus and solo singers. They are not confined to the final movement as in the Beethoven but are sprinkled throughout the work, even in the first movement. Further, there is a dramatic story involved, so that one could imagine this is really a dramatic oratorio or cantata. Whatever it is, there are some peculiarities. For instance, the singers do not portray the personae in Shakespeare's play, but rather comment on the action, all of which takes place in the orchestra. The heart of the work, the scene of Romeo alone in Juliet's garden followed by their love scene, and then the Queen Mab Scherzo, are purely instrumental and yet highly dramatic -- not to forget gloriously beautiful -- music.

It is not clear when this live performance was recorded; the booklet and DVD case make no mention of copyright or performance date. From internal evidence I would guess that it was made in the early 1990s. Indeed, bass Peter Meven died in 2003 so we know it antedates that (well, duh, I guess!). Sound is spectacular in spite of it being only in the older PCM stereo (no DD5.1 or DTS5.1 here). The picture is stunningly clear. The performance took place in the Kulturzentrum Gasteig in Munich, a beautiful space with rich wooden interior and exposed organ pipes. The audience is very quiet. There are edits between movements; it is a little odd to close one movement with the orchestra alone onstage and then immediately see the chorus onstage seemingly transported there by magic. Soloists could not be better. Hanna Schwarz has a rich, plangent mezzo, Philip Langridge's diction is immaculate, and Peter Meven's bass is full and dramatic. As for the musical direction, is there anyone who has Berlioz's measure better than Sir Colin? I don't think so. He is clearly living every note and he draws exceptional playing from his orchestra.

If you love this work, you really ought to get this DVD. Even if you don't, I'd recommend it if you want to know the work better.

Subtitles of the French text are available in English, German, Spanish and, yes, French. TT=102mins.
