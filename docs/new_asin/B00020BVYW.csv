2050658,1,B00020BVYW,"I saw this movie with the cast and director during the Vancouver Film Festival a couple of years ago. It was a great film. It was filmed in a 2.35 : 1 aspect ratio. Unfortuately the dvd is cropped down to 1.85 : 1, thus cutting of a lot of the picture. Its too bad because the film utilizes the very widescreen extremely well to show off the vast Canadian landscape of the North and the recropping chops off 1/3rd of the picture. The film's true aspect ratio can be seen though only in short segments in a documentary included on the disc.",1111622400,12,539,4.242718446601942
2050659,5,B00020BVYW,"This movie is based on Farley Mowat's ""Snow Walker"" series of books; mainly ""Walk Well my Brother""; and was filmed in Churchill (Manitoba), Inuvik (NWT), and British Colombia.  Simply outstanding scenery and landscapes; don't be deterred by the word ""Snow"" in the title, this is an entertaining movie to watch.

The DVD comes with a terrific documentary (shown on Bravo network originally) and the Director voice over is full of terrific information.  You can tell that they knew they had gotten outstanding casting and adored Annabella Piugattuk.  Barry Pepper commenting in interviews about how her natural ability allowed her to bring so much more to the movie then original intended (the director commented that the crew were very moved with unexpected moments being captured).

Nominated for Nine (9) Genie Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, the story takes place in 1953 with a Bush Pilot (Charlie Halliday) who undergoes a transformation from an uncaring, not so nice person; when he accepts a bribe to transport an ailing Inuit girl (played by 19 year old Annabella) to a hospital in Yellowknife.  His plane crashes en route and he decides to leave her, figuring she would be a burden and would die anyway, to walk to a town (he estimates at 200 miles away).

The films shows how the land is surprisingly harsh and walking difficult to say the least.  A week into his trek he fails terribly (literally brutalised by the environment) and finally collapses.  The girl (named Kanaalaq ... Can-el-ah) has followed him and Charlie learns what is it like to have a relationship with another person (basically a re-birth for him).

The film is wonderful at showing us things about the Inuit (old slang would be ""Eskimo"", or back in the 50s ""Husky""), and you walk away really feeling that, like Charlie, you have grown a bit too.  Annabella is a first time actor (they took a risk on her, and re-arranged the shooting to allow her to learn); and Barry Pepper who appeared in ""Saving Private Ryan"" as the sniper, gives a performance that is outstanding ... those are real (cold) lakes he is running into and so on.  The Director is Charles Martin Smith (actor in The Untouchables, Never Cry Wolf, American Graffitti, Starman).

The chemistry and acting from the two leads is something else, and brings so much to the movie.  For instance the planned subtitles were cancelled because they were not needed with the great communication between them.  Annabella was able to work as a translator (English is her second language), plus she knew how to sew and hunt etc - she was upset about being taken away from a Walrus hunt to fly to Vancouver for auditioning for example.

So definitely see this film; it is guaranteed to please.  It is a picture the whole family can watch.  If you have time, also watch the documentary, ""Make the Movie, Live the Movie"".

I would give it a perfect score!",1106006400,16,2933,4.83
2050660,4,B00020BVYW,"Charles Martin Smith fell in love with the Canadian north when he starred in ""Never Cry Wolf"" 21 years ago.  Now he returns to that beautiful, stark landscape as a director, and his love of the land is shown in the beautiful panoramic vistas that almost become a character unto themselves.
""The Snow Walker"" is a simple story about cocky courier pilot Charlie (Barry Pepper) who reluctantly agrees to fly a young Inuit woman (Annabelle Piugattuk), sick with TB, to the hospital in Yellowknife.  Naturally, things do not go as planned.  The plane goes down and the two characters must fend for themselves in the barren landscape, their divergent personalities and cultural differences making things difficult at times, yet also enlightening.  As days drag into weeks, a respectful bond grows between the pair and Charlie gradually comes to care for his companion, a member of a people Charlie had previously treated with cruel indifference.
Pepper, as always, is great, turning in a real performance as Charlie, a man facing his own survival and prejudices in the northern wilderness.  And newcomer Piugattuk is delightful as the Inuit woman, her impressive performance showing us a culture we rarely have the opportunity to see.  Small supporting roles by James Cromwell and Kiersten Warren are effective as well.
All in all, a very satisfying movie of survival and friendship against all odds.",1093132800,,1394,5.092105263157895
2050661,5,B00020BVYW,"This is a movie for those people who enjoyed reading Jack London's arctic stories when they were kids.

Based on the short story by Farley Mowat ('Walk Well My Brother') it opens by showing simple life of hot-shot former WWII bomber pilot Charlie (Barry Pepper). Charlie works for a small courier company in northern Canada and on one of the trips gets to airlift sick native inuit young woman (Annabella Piugattuk) out of the remote fishing spot to the hospital.

Something very quickly goes wrong and Charlie is land-crashing his plane in the middle of nowhere away from his logged trip route.

Lost in tundra the two very different people learn to coexist and gradually develop strong bonds of friendship that would touch anybody's heart.

An hour and fifty minutes movie is filmed on beautiful landscapes of British Columbia and is pleasure to watch.

Both main actors have great chemistry together and are convincingly carrying this movie alone to it's inevitable outcome.

Highly recommended!",1092268800,5,998,5.054878048780488
2050662,4,B00020BVYW,"Pepper is of course a vetern actor with a history of hits, he can carry a movie by himself. No need to do that in The Snow Walker, Annabelle proves herself to be an able rookie. Scenery is spectacular!",1091836800,,201,4.17948717948718
2050663,5,B00020BVYW,"Wow, I was literally guilted into seeing this in the theatre; and what a good thing it was that I went.
I have this on DVD now and the documentary is excellent.  This CANADIAN made movie (shot in Manitoba, NWT, and BC) has shot to the top of my favorite list.  Everyone I show it too is stunned by the terrific cast, photography, and outstanding story (quality A1).
Berry Pepper (I did not know any of the cast before) is absolutely outstanding.  Annabelle Piugattuk (has so much chemistry with the media...film) it hits the viewer hard; there is something about her that extremely likeable (same for Berry); the the two work together in a wonderful way (so rare).
I know that the storyline looks tough to take (winter, cold) but I guarantee that this one will delight.  The Pilot is essentially reborn, or transformed, by his experience.  Men will like Barry's performance as it is not at all mush ... tough and believable.
After watching it about 3 times, some noteworthy things.  The Owl, I think symbolizes someone watching (the girl?); the pilot's flashbacks to the war; the last flashback hits me so hard; don't know why but I just well up now with the change that occurs in it (what does the Raven mean?).  The message I think is that ""we are not alone"". Feminists will love it of course, Annabella is something like 4'8"" tall and amazes all.  Again, the sight of her makes me well up ... maybe I'm just an emotional wreck these days.
The Director is Charles Martin Smith -- from The Untouchables, or American Graffitti (the one that got so sick from drinking).
Oh, if you have Home Theatre Speakers the talk with the Raven (I think it is a Raven) will sound awesome on your speakers .. it was cool in the theatre).
So buy this DVD; outstanding!!!",1087776000,,1754,4.546031746031746
2050664,5,B00020BVYW,"Murray Walker was and forever will be The Voice, the voice of Formula One. When the BBC's and later ITV's best loved commentator retired at the US grand prix in Indianapolis this year, he left millions of fans around the world sad to see him go. This video is great as a personal selection of his favorite moments in grand prix racing between 1976 and 1997. Unforgotten his many ""Murrayisms"" (""there's nothing wrong with the car, except it's on fire""), his inspired collaboration and friendship in the commentator booth with the late James Hunt, his coverage of Our Man Nige's long and painful climb to the championship crown and of course the many fantastic (or:""aaaaabsolutely aaamaaazing!!"" as Murray would say) rivalries that have made the sport precious: Villeneuve and Arnoux, Senna and Prost, and of course Michael Schumacher and Damon Hill.

2050688,5,B00020BVYW,"Rented this movie from a video store years ago.  Was caught off guard by its dramatic cinematography. So, while nailed with a flu this week, something triggered me to recollect this survival tale, and I looked up its name.  then watched it on Amazon.

Many will react to the character Charlie being an over-the-top caricature for the self-centered playboy; the master of tantrums when things don't go well.  True enough. But having his life saved 10 times over by a completely devoid-of-selfishness Eskimo stranger brings about a transformation  that is convincing and elegantly portrayed.  The Eskimo Kanaalaq is not phased by the desolate wilderness and its monumental challenges.  She is patient, but purposeful at following the indigenous ways and belief systems of her kin. She lets Charlie enter her world at his own pace and as this plays out, we realize who is really rescuing whom in this harsh land.  No denying that Kanaalaq is stunningly cast by a real Inuit with no acting history.  Nifty movie making by the Canadian company.",1481846400,2,1039,4.994186046511628

After reading the other reviews I'm not entirely sure why anyone would think this is some kind of Family-Friendly Disney-esque film, though truthfully I would not have a problem showing it to my children, though the deep subtleties would probably be lost on them (unfortunately no singing squirrels or fairy princesses). I would also not recommend it for those hoping for quick random action, clicking weapons and explosions (thank goodness they made a Die Hard sequel). It is a wonderful, inspiring, yet heartbreaking, story of two individuals who must come to terms with their own internal struggles. He must learn to survive in a world where he is not as strong and in control as he thought; she carries her own incredible burdens but finds the strength and fortitude to help her companion. Shows the difference between barely surviving in the wilderness to living in the a hostile environment.

Right off the bat, there's a bar scene and the men are vulgar, and of course then he leaves with a girl and there are clearly scenes of sex (I fast forwarded this part and didn't see, but there must have been some sexual substance because where I stopped he was just dressing up in the morning). Later in the movie, there is a scene with the Inuit girl, and she is shown in the river with her back showing right down to just above her bottom. There is also a scene with the main character coming out of the water and he is just covering his crotch area. It really doesn't have a great ending, so to me, it wasn't worth it.

2050802,5,B00020BVYW,"This is the only ""wilderness survival"" movie I've seen that gets the story right. I'm tired of movies that portray the wilderness as ""harsh, brutal, and nasty"" because some urbanite gets stranded in the bush. Meanwhile, food, water, and shelter are all around them. Fortunately, this is not one of those movies. Survival is a matter of skill. If your skills are bad you'll suffer. How can we plop a civilized human in the wilderness and expect him to survive? His travails are not caused by the landscape but by his lack of skill. Consider the opposite: if we took a Kalahari bushman and plopped him in the middle of Manhattan would we expect him to know how to operate an ATM, open a bank account, apply for a job, rent an apartment, understand credit, hail a taxi, etc. The Snow Walker pairs a ""civilized"" Canadian bush pilot with an Inuit woman. They both crash land in the Arctic. The Canadian panics and tries to fix his radio, the Inuit begins to fish, hunt, and prepare shelter. The contrast is well constructed and shows that our Earth, even in its seemingly harshest places, provides everything we need to live if only we know how. Well done Farley Mowat.

2050848,5,B00020BVYW,"This movie will appeal to old and young viewers. Best enjoyed if you have been on wilderness trips and maybe/probably have good knowledge on survial skills and how to try to live in tune with nature. You better have a keen interest in trying to stay alive on the tundra when seasons change, because this is it. Plot. First name ""fruitcake"" last name ""flyboy"" crashlands with a bushplane on the arctic tundra, a thousand miles from nowhere. The nearest settlement ""mosquitoville"" with some twenty five million mosquitos and gnats living there is close by. Onboard the plane he carried a few supplies and a corker of a girl. Too bad she has terminal TB. In order to make a movie the bush pilot has to learn everything the hard way on the tundra. The girl/young woman is a ace when it comes to live of the land. She teaches him the skills to survive. Without her the bushpilot probably would have ended up being scavenger diet within a few weeks time. They can't really communicate well either since she speaks Inuit tounge and he speaks english, that makes his struggle even more difficult. She must have kept thinking all the time; first Tuberculosis, then a crashlanding, now I have to be a survival instructor to a pilot that can't even understand what I'm saying, what's next?, being chased by a polarbear across a frozen wasteland with a busted leg?.

2050951,5,B00020BVYW,"Overall I enjoyed this movie. There are a few spoilers below. The ending is sad.

The good:
1. It was interesting to see all of the hunting and survival techniques. Also it was cool to see that they didn't need the stuff from the other plane and how they 'buried' the pilot.
2. There are many positive lessons in this movie and overall it is a bit uplifting despite the death of Kanaalaq. We can probably guess that Charlie appreciates life more after this and settles down.

The Bad:
1. product placement for nestle, spam and coca cola was either intentional or unintentional but especially with the chocolate bar and Charlie singing the commercial jingle, it was a bit annoying.
2. I had a single engine student pilot license long ago and planes can land just fine with the engine off as long as the frame of the airplane is fine. In the movie the engine blew a piston or rod or something and what seems as oil splatters on the window. There is no damage shown on the frame of the plane so it could have easily landed and a skilled pilot like him could have landed with the engine off. It is standard procedure for instructors to lower the engine to idol and then tell the student to pretend to land somewhere (but before landing the instructor would power the engine back up). This is so that the instructor can prove that the student can make an emergency landing. So, the plane should not have had all of those roller coaster type movements and should not have crashed.
3. There is a bit of profanity in this movie.",1405814400,,1520,4.425

I guess that's how desperate I am for a good movie at the end of a long week.  Thankfully, I found some forties classics at a local warehouse that I couldn't rent on Amazon.  In The Snow Walker, the excessive language was insulting and unexpected for a PG rating.  All the cursing of mothers/women/God got old fast.  (Why aren't men or gods from religions other than Christianity cursed?)

It isn't often we are drawn into a movie, but this did.  While not fast, it is steady.

2051046,3,B00020BVYW,"This seemed more like a documentary.  Slow moving but good movie none the less. I would recommend this to people who enjoy outdoor life, they will be able to relate to this.",1403136000,,173,4.40625
2051047,5,B00020BVYW,"A movie which is worth the time to watch.  I watched it and thought it was so good, I watched it again with my family.

The story portrays characters with inner strength and integrity (which is hard to find in a movie).",1402876800,,219,4.190476190476191
2051048,5,B00020BVYW,This movie was well done and very touching. I would see it again. Even though there was a small cast it was very powerful.,1402790400,,122,4.125
2051049,3,B00020BVYW,A great story but it never came off as strong as it should have.  Overacted in a few spots.  Particularly the scene where he is attacked by misquitos.  Still a decent movie and worth your time and money.  Sort  of lie a Tuesday night movie.,1402704000,,240,4.2444444444444445
2051050,3,B00020BVYW,It is a good story but a bit slow.  It was a great way to relax.  I would have liked a bit more explaination at the end.,1402531200,,120,3.4074074074074074
2051051,5,B00020BVYW,I enjoyed this movie and the area it was filmed beautiful. This is a movie made by a Canadian Film company. We enjoyed the story and the country it was filmed in.,1402444800,,162,4.09375

2051065,4,B00020BVYW,"While watching I felt as if I were there sharing the experience.  I was taken in with the chemistry between the two main characters and the scenery.  I could believe that they were actually living this, instead of just acting.",1401840000,,226,4.625
2051066,4,B00020BVYW,Was a little skeptical but ended up being a great movie to watch. Landscape cinema was great and interesting cast of actors.,1401753600,,124,4.681818181818182
2051067,4,B00020BVYW,Excellent movie.  Several unexpected twists. Shows bush life in Alaska in the mid 50's.  Beautiful photography.  Made me modify my survival load out.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.,1401753600,,175,5.37037037037037

2051073,1,B00020BVYW,Not sure why this got better reviews from other people. It certainly wasn't great. The main character was pretty irritating and had tantrums like a 2 year old. The ending wasn't great either.,1401148800,,191,4.818181818181818

2051090,4,B00020BVYW,"To be honest, despite the large number of titles available in the Amazon Prime library, there are very few films in this collection that appeal to me. I was pleasantly surprised to find that The Snow Walker is an emotionally charged film about a greedy, homophobic, self-absorbed daredevil pilot whose plane crashes in the Arctic. Although initially he has little respect for the native Inuit tribes who inhabit the land, he learns the skills that he needs to survive from a young Inuit woman who teaches him how to fish and hunt, how to stitch animal skins into clothing and boots, how to stay alive in a frigid and hostile environment. The photography of the vast landscape is amazingly beautiful. I was moved by the physical and emotional journey portrayed in this film.",1400371200,,773,4.819548872180451
2051091,5,B00020BVYW,Really great story with good acting. Left me inspired and in awe of the power of nature and the ability of people to survive almost any situation that is thrown at them.,1400198400,,169,4.3125
2051092,4,B00020BVYW,Not  a top of the chart movie but it was a good story and acting was good.  It is based on a arrogant pilot who transports people or cargo for a small company.  He is asked to fly a very sick young woman to a hospital and then the story begins.,1400112000,,244,3.7450980392156863
2051093,5,B00020BVYW,"I Thoroughly enjoyed this movie also the ""Making Of"" was excellent. Including the Inuit people added to it's reality. ""Excellent""",1399680000,,129,5.5
2051094,5,B00020BVYW,"This was a very pleasant surprise.  It kind of reminded me of Call of The Wild.  This movie starts off annoying but ends profoundly and simply elegant.  So there is this man who served in the war, who is kind of an jerk and shallow.  He is an aviator and runs a simple mission and where the journey then goes, he could have never guessed.  His life if changed as he keeps leaving bits of his old self behind.  If you want all action and then you will think this film is just ok.  This is more a journey about waking up.  I found it beautiful.",1399593600,,542,4.047169811320755
2051105,4,B00020BVYW,"I particularly like this movie even though its not a very fast paced action movie because of the amazing story of the attempt made by a pilot to save the life of a poor Eskimo woman. To me, it shows how in the face of adversity we realize that we are all humans and despite our unique backgrounds do everything possible to survive and help each other and how the indomitable spirit of all humans, never gives up.",1399593600,,412,4.294871794871795

2051108,5,B00020BVYW,The area where the picture was made is something the average person will never see. How the natives survive in such harsh conditions was demonstrated by the female star. The male star gave an excellent portrait of how it is possible for someone to change for the better. I will likely watch it again in a month or so to enjoy all the levels active in the story.,1399420800,,361,4.323529411764706
2051109,5,B00020BVYW,"The movie provided a glimpse of two cultures on a collision course and the great wisdom of kindness as taught by the native girl to the interloper who is battling demons after WWII. He learns the lesson too late, but is saved by her generosity and inbred understanding that we are all connected.",1399420800,,295,4.584905660377358

2051111,3,B00020BVYW,"In this show a young pilot crashes with his passenger, a young Inuit woman who needs to get to a hospital.  She is smart when it comes to survival in the remote Alaskan wilderness and she helps him by making him some waterproof boots and teaching him to hunt.  There is a search party looking for them but after awhile of not finding anything the searching ends.  When the pilot and the young woman realize they are going to have to walk out by themselves they start their journey.  The woman has some health issues along the way but the two become friends as they struggle to survive.  The ending is not what I expected.",1399161600,3,621,4.3652173913043475

2051125,3,B00020BVYW,"It was difficult to watch Charlie be such a hot head that he not only endangered his own life but that of the Inuit woman in his charge. Towards the end he grew but I didn't like that it was too late and I would have liked closure as to what he did after he found ""civilization"".",1398556800,,279,3.912280701754386

2051127,5,B00020BVYW,How large and remote areas of this world is and the only thing connecting them is a Bush pilot with his plane. Also showing the native people who have the skills to survive from day to day. Great movie and plot showing how quickly a person from one society can once again depend upon the skills from a society native to the region when the situation deems it.,1398124800,,359,4.294117647058823
2051128,5,B00020BVYW,"A really good movie for the family to watch.  Watched the character evolve as he struggled to survive, and struggled right along with him.  A movie you could recommend to anyone.",1398038400,,178,4.709677419354839

2051130,5,B00020BVYW,A great movie where a young man grows wiser and the viewer does too. The film won well deserved awards.,1397952000,,103,4.2
2051131,5,B00020BVYW,"Had never seen anything about this film and that is a shame.  I found it by searching the films on Amazon Instant Videos and as a Barry Pepper fan I read the synopsis.  It sounded like something we would enjoy and it sure was.  The photography alone is worth watching, but it is the story that will hold your interest all the way through.  Barry Pepper's character is that of a cocky self centered pilot for an oil company in Alaska.  The young woman from the Inuit people is the one who makes him realize what is really worth living.  This film has everything, suspense, humor, adventure, drama and a lesson.  It is too bad it didn't receive more publicity as it is truly a film that you shouldn't miss.",1397952000,,704,4.369230769230769
2051132,5,B00020BVYW,It was an unexpected gem! I expected it to be boring but after the airplane crash the interaction between the pilot and the native girl was fascinating. There was no sex but the mutual bonding that occured out of the survival situation was very appealing. I highly recommend this movie if you are interested in human nature rising to its most noble capacity.,1397952000,,358,4.698412698412699

2051150,4,B00020BVYW,This story could have been based on dozens of true Alaska survival stories. Takes place following WW2 and the beginning of Alaska's Bush Pilot era and before the oil boom. Beautiful story of survival in the wilderness and the necessity of working together and relying on each other. The dangers of the  last of the great frontiers is only diminished by the beauty.,1397347200,,364,4.777777777777778

2051168,5,B00020BVYW,"Barry Pepper's character is almost painful to watch at the outset. He does absolutely EVERYTHING wrong and nature punishes him for it.

2051169,5,B00020BVYW,It is based on a book but is a great inspirational film. It show the differences between a war pilot and a Inuit  girl. After the plane crash the movie shows the different aproaches of  each culture and how the things worked out for the pilot to survve in the middle of the crude winter. Photography of nature scenes are great.,1396828800,,327,4.344262295081967

2051192,5,B00020BVYW,"This is a wonderful movie with many messages about life, the human spirit and strength.  Also the acting of the two main characters is Oscar winning in my estimation and perhaps proves that The Oscars are just about Hollywood and the Characters that live and work there. These two actors worked in a very difficult enviroment and under terrible at time conditions and still gave a first rate performance.  If there is a negative some might find it a little to long --""walking in the snow""--but in reality each step tells another story. Like I remind my Grandchildren ""Life is a Journey and not just a Destination"".

I watched it several times over the years on YouTube; I finally decided I had to have it in my library.  It is, you might imagine, one of my all time favorite movies and stories.  Barry and Annabelle are perfect in the roles they are cast; I wish I could see more of Annabelle (Barry, fortunately is in several other films).

I thought this was a love story, boy was i wrong Yes it is about surving and killing animals but that is basically all it is roaming around in the cold and killing animals to eat to survive. Then the women gets sick spitting up blood and dies,and he eventually finds people and lives the end. It is not a romance movie just a survival movie!  If you don't like seeing constant animals killed don't watch!  I only give it 3 stars for their filming of the great outdoors thats it.",1395619200,,482,4.228260869565218

Good story and the landscapes are breathtaking. OK ... a couple of things. the crash-landing sequence is totally ridiculous. Please ... with all of the aviation experts available .... hell, any experienced pilot could tell you it would not happen like THAT!. the only other thing was I got a bit worn with Barry Peppers temper tantrums.  But the Inuit actress is beautiful and with a perfect mystical quality. I don;t want to give anything away ... but the ending came on pretty quickly, almost like they had to cut 20 minutes.

2051289,4,B00020BVYW,"Now going to read the book.  Watching this movie was like sitting through the unfolding of a well told story. The main character is egotistic and with that womanizing.  We don't know if he has always been this way or if it is secondary to his trying to numb the pain and live with his haunting of his actions in WWII.  The other main character does a beautiful job of insidiously imparting on him the gift of respect, humanity and love. Through this life changing experience of being forced to go back to the land, be near death, having to be dependent for survival - we see that he has truly been enriched.  As other comments have mentioned, to have more of the Inuit culture explained would have been contra to the movie which gained a large portion of its gutteralness from the fact that he and she could not communicate in social terms (language) and so thus had to show and feel their connectedness. When he hesitates to allow for the unspoken respect of society in the end, that cements for the audience his transformation. It adds to the preciousness that she, having happened into the circumstance, cared for him in physical and spiritual terms and imparts unto him a spirituality that I believe he will continue to live.  Potential viewers should be advised about cursing - which shows you the depth of his despair and several animal killings - which is how they survived. A note to other reviews to the multi-killings - He was awoken from having completely given up to an aggressive excess (of which they made full use).  To me this showed us his turning a corner from despair, to fighting for his will to live.",1394323200,,1621,4.553264604810996
2051290,4,B00020BVYW,"Yes, it would have been nice to have incorprorated more Inuit aspect; yes, some of his actions weren't consistent with what one would have expected of such a person, but the movie was really a fantasy and thus such things really aren't necessary. The point of the movie was to experience a person's changed mind as he encounters a wilderness and a person indigenous to that place and how he adjusts.",1394323200,,399,4.633802816901408

This is not a big production movie but it is such a terrific story and so well told. I find myself watching it every once in awhile. I found myself lost in the story, it's compelling.  No big names... just a great story that was well made.  Sometimes that works.  Don't be afraid to try it.

2051294,4,B00020BVYW,"This is a very sweet but sad movie that takes place not long after WWII. A rteturning pilot settles in Alaska as a bush pilot. Typical image of a hard drinking, risk taking pilot flying for a flying company in Alaska. On one trip to a remote part of Alaska he picks up a young native woman who is sick and needs to go to the city hospital. He decides to fly directly back, rather than make another stop on his flight plan route and his single engine plane blows a piston.

I don't look to the Hollywood box-office-buster for all the good films, after all we get slammed with all the hype from the press.. Evey so often I click on a movie that makes me go hmmm. I loved this movie for the simple message that says we can't always trust our egotistical emotions.

True, some of the spiritual messages I don't exactly agree with. That said there is no dangerous subliminal messages thrown out. I think a quiet evening and a desire to see and understand another culture will reward you with the chance to see a 5 bagger.",1394064000,,659,4.357723577235772

2051308,4,B00020BVYW,At first we thought that this might by a little hookie but hang on and it becomes quite interesting. The interactions of the main characters is quite powerful. Focus on the abilities of each character to survive and see that the strong and powerful may only survive due to the wisdom of the weak (or does that make them truly the stronger?).,1393977600,,341,4.516129032258065

While there are a couple scenes that seemed to stretch reality (I cannot imagine a military pilot, even from WWII, having so few survival skills and making some very poor decisions), the story ultimately drew us in.

2051371,1,B00020BVYW,Movie portrays unreal situations in Alaska or anywhere else. Airplane shown going down out of control from engine problem that has no bearing on airplane control and pilot has anger management issue with abuse of passenger. People in Alaska do not survive being that stupid.,1393286400,,274,5.111111111111111

2051373,4,B00020BVYW,This movie had the potential to be really good or bad based on the description.  It was really good because of the acting and the reality of survival by a culture almost forgotten these days.  The bush pilots perception of the native people changed throughout the movie.  The appreciation for the inuit culture was shared by me as a viewer.  The only downside is that I would like to seen the ending wrapped up a little better.,1393200000,,427,4.5064935064935066

2051377,3,B00020BVYW,"I would have given this movie a five star - except for a couple of scenes and language.  As a teacher I am constantly looking for movies that will be appropriate to show my middle grade students.  We do a unit on Canada and this would have been an excellent resource to show how the male main character learned to appreciate the indigenous people.  As it was, I had to select another movie primarily due to the language.",1393113600,,420,4.358974358974359

2051397,4,B00020BVYW,the scenery is breathtaking and the story flows well. Though I didn't quite understand the animosity between the owner an the one pilot.  Not an action movie and that's ok. It's a very well acted movie.,1392854400,,202,4.611111111111111
2051398,4,B00020BVYW,I thought the movie covered the issue of pride and arrogance in a subtle way.  Being respectful of nature and other ways of life was enjoyable to watch.  I enjoyed the landscape rarely seen.,1392854400,,190,4.5588235294117645
2051399,4,B00020BVYW,This was a very good movie. Showed how the inuit really live and how much the average jow does not understand squat about other cultures.,1392854400,,137,4.52
2051400,3,B00020BVYW,Very slow moving movie  and difficult to stay tuned into.  Acting was fair but not great.  This could have been a much more interesting movie if it had more action and intrigue.,1392854400,,177,4.46875

2051423,5,B00020BVYW,Very well done and holds your attention through out the movie. Alaska is known for eating  up bush pilots and this is life and death survival of 2 people that crash and live and then need to survive.,1392854400,,199,4.2368421052631575

2051426,3,B00020BVYW,"Another tale of survival in the wilderness. I got into the characters and it was interesting to see two people from very different cultures work togther to survive. Somewhat unrealistic at times given that the girl had tuberculosis but did most of the hunting and acted as the main provider. The story had elements of Dances With Wolves in it, so wasn't the most original of stories. Oh, and the girl being able to muster English at certain moments, then unable to speak a word at others, left me cringing. A simple tale worth watching for easy viewing.",1392768000,,553,4.653061224489796

2051434,5,B00020BVYW,"I incidentally (via Amazon Instant Video) came upon this movie, and was very touched by it.  After watching the movie, I have a new perspective and respect for any people or race that I did not already know.  Every person/race deserves an understanding and a place on earth.

The scene when the actor was left to die after mosquitoes attack and when a womans hand came to touch his neck is like a miracle.  In the face of harsh environment and adversity, the Inuit womans composure, sprit and skills far surpassed the white man.  With the Inuit womans death, there was no happy ending.  But I realized that was actually a better ending than another miracle or even romance.",1392595200,,673,4.61344537815126
2051435,4,B00020BVYW,Liked the survival  part.  I did not like when the girl died.  wish he could have saved her.  I don't like rating and writing so many words,1392595200,,139,4.037037037037037
2051436,5,B00020BVYW,The movie was interesting in that it gave a glimpse if Eskimo life and the redemption of the white newcomers.  Beautiful photography of Alaska.,1392595200,,143,4.958333333333333

Pepper and Piugatluk, especially Annabella largely without words, tell a story of hardship unrequited service to others leading to a deep connection.  The contributions of Piugatluk's character and the evolution of Pepper's draw the audience in.  For my part, well worth my time.",1392422400,,323,5.1923076923076925

Over the course of their journey of survival, she rescues him from himself, restoring the meaning he has lost in his life.

The protagonist pilot in all his bravado and modern day western man ego encounters an intuit failing female and instinctively seeks flight-literary. Only after being offered pecuniary reward in the form of walrus tusks/ivory, does he reconsider. The story dives to unpredictable depths as the plane descends into the totalitarian tundra. Stranded and burdened by this onus of a sickly anchor, he sets off on his own to find refuge, only to discover that he is the vulnerable one- inept in his present surroundings.
The tables turn when he realizes it is he who is the student and symbiotic partner and must relinquish his bravado and macho ego and deign to her wisdom and instincts if they are to survive. The two connect in a heartfelt way that enables them to plow thru language and culture to unearth their common bond- humanity.

It is totally authentic, both in its portrayal of human survival in the harsh wilderness, and a tender relationship based on sheer necessity. The only thing is, its a bit anti-climactic. I would really love to have seen the couple reach a village or the big city and live happily ever after. Then again, that may have ruined the film's authenticity, and my dissatisfaction perhaps arises only from my own Hollywood brainwashing! Anyhow, the story really wants me to turn off my computer, get of my ass, and get into the woods for some hunting, fishing, and down-to-earth living.

There is excellent acting in this movie as well as beautiful scenery.  I felt myself there at times and that always seems to draw my thoughts into considering how I would personally think and behave given similar circumstances.  You should watch it!",1391817600,,372,4.888888888888889

While I enjoyed the movie and each part that made it whole, its message is important for all of us to understand.  There is always more than you can see.  Although the land looked bare and hostile, it provided food and water.

It showed what event the most civilized person does not know or wants to know about the nature and its ability to heal and take care of us.  Western medicine is another big fallacy that it can fix everything.  People actually believe this and will blindly follow their doctor's advice or some TV nonsense on Doctors, etc.  the body can heal itself, you have to give it a  chance.  With all the fast movies and shoot to kill type of videos, it is amazing that a good movie is rarely even advertised.

2051503,3,B00020BVYW,"An interesting tale that showed an inside look at the Alaskan way of life, both for those who are more sophisticated  and the Native Culture. I have been there and although I saw first hand how some of the Indian Natives (Inuites and Athabaskins sp) lived. While there I failed to get a real picture of the culture. The amount of light has a lot to do with the entire culture living there and that was not shown during this story.
This was a life and love story during a very dangerous trip after a small plane crash, between a brash pilot and an Indian girl. He acted responsibly but was not equipped and she while in the process of being very sick showed him how to survive. The actors showed a very suttle relationship which to me could only be described as love (or deep caring) and respect for each other.

2051509,4,B00020BVYW,"This was a very interesting movie set in the 1950's, but you forget that as two people try to survive the wilderness.  I enjoyed this very much despite the idiotic things they had the male lead do in this film.  But then I remembered that men had a different place in society in the 50's, and not much faith in women sometimes.  The growing bond between the two lead characters is touching, and refreshingly non sexual.  This was based on a true story and was more focused on survival rather than romance as might be seen in a work of fiction.  Highly recommend this film as acting by the young Eskimo woman was very good with some glances how once again Eskimos were treated by the government in theYukon territory.",1391299200,,716,4.476923076923077

You see his sense of value change in the movie as time evolves in the film. The plot was amazing, the culture I feel was respected and showed with an amazing amount of accuracy, and it shows a side to the indigenous culture that the majority of Western Culture don't really think about nor know about.

Annabella Piugattuk is convincing in her portrayal of the Eskimo values and culture she represents. I would have given this movie four or five stars if not for one glaring inconsistency in the plot.

The story drags in the beginning but as it develops into a life or death struggle with one of nature's climates the wisdom and knowledge possessed within this young female character truly opens your eyes to how life is to be appreciated and not taken for granted. The two main characters represent the contrasts between the modern world's amenities and the old ancient ways of surviving off the sparse offerings of the land. The hard lessons learned and the harsh choices made in the end that is the final lesson in nature that only the strong may survive. Heart warming and sad but so true.

2051562,4,B00020BVYW,"We had not heard of this movie, but we like Barry Pepper, so we decided to check it out.  It's a survival movie that tells of a young man's tranformation with the help of a young woman.  I wish we saw a bit of what happened to him afterwards,  but maybe we already know.  Good family movie for older kids, there are a few tough scenes; not overly gruesome, but maybe uncomfortable for young kids.",1390867200,,396,4.24
2051563,5,B00020BVYW,This proved to a very compelling and deeply moving movie! It showed the strengths and weaknesses of all the characters that more then a movie but also a lesson in humility as well as humanity.

2051569,5,B00020BVYW,"We all can learn something from this movie. Just remember how he made fun of the Eskimo in the bar selling his merchandise and at the end, an Eskimo saved his life.

2051577,5,B00020BVYW,"I chose this movie thinking it might have great scenery and I was right.  It was breathtaking.  However, the story was equally good with how a stranded pilot in unfamiliar lands is discovered and befriended by a woman who is local and shows him how to survive.

2051588,4,B00020BVYW,"Simple and powerful story wrapped in the perspective of our modern minds trying to see what has been lost in the transition from subsistence to modernity......There is something here that itches at our minds and we hope it means that the mystery lost in our beginnings will not fade.
It is easy to forget that in actual experience we feel and do what we thought we would never do, by always contradicting our selves and each other.
All the training and all the experience does NOT settle neatly into logic or what should have been done in the moment.
What do we know of another person's perspective within an experienced moment?  Some would like to think given the circumstances illustrated in the movie, their reactions will be filled with intent. But, when intent or training is lead astray by something that cannot be  explained at that time nor in a supposed less chaotic time or setting. This brings the question why I do and why you do? It is found somewhere in a place we cannot see....let go and feel the connection....the Great Spirit, the Great Energy.....
Out of our element of artificial routines we can be lead by a voice that has always been in our heads and heart and there the steeled resolve of accepted reality is shaken by a power subtle but connected in ways that enlivens our very being to the eternal presence of what is.",1390348800,,1343,4.591666666666667

2051590,3,B00020BVYW,"The film  was a wonderful reminder of the vastness of Alaska.  Although timeliness was unrealistic, the survival culture was depicted well.  The acting was simple but nicely done. Unfortunately at the first meeting of our heroine one would have thought she was on death's door; amazing how she was the one doing the caring, fishing, hunting, carrying large rocks. But although incongruent, I did enjoy the simple story.",1390262400,,419,5.132352941176471

The story is about a Westerner and an Inuit teenager who create an unlikely bond after their plane crashes. This movie, to sum it up, is about their friendship and survival.

The girl in this film (who by the way is an authentic Inuit outside of the movie) has a pure heart that is captivating, I highly recommend you watch this film.",1390089600,,538,4.536082474226804

I enjoyed it so much that I got the book of short stories the book is based on and am thoroughly enjoying that (if you can be said to enjoy stories of an environment that is so harsh and unforgiving).

2051665,5,B00020BVYW,This was so good and so sad all at the same time. I was so hoping he would be able to make it with the girl to get her help. I so didn't want her to die. She taught him so much and started to change his thinking it seemed. To make him a better person. It was just so sad when she walked off and died all alone. You could tell that really effected him. I would suggest this movie to all my friends as a very good movie to see. A very touching and heart felt movie to watch.,1389398400,,472,3.6831683168316833

2051668,4,B00020BVYW,"A pilot and his passenger struggle for survival after crashing in the Arctic tundra. A kind of Robinson Crusoe in the far north. Beautiful cinematography of northern Canada with straightforward storytelling. Annabella Piugattuk speaks English too well to be believable as an Inuit girl A couple of distractions from a pilot's point of view. Engine failure is separate from flight controls so an aircraft glides without power and there's a reason you stay on your flight plan and near a downed aircraft. Small distractions that will go unnoticed by most viewers. Overall, beautiful, entertaining and a relief from computer-generated imagery, car chases and gun fights.",1389312000,,667,5.3619047619047615

2051676,4,B00020BVYW,"The only problem I had with this movie and the reason for not giving it five stars was the beginning.  A little too raunchy for my taste and certainly didn't make the group of pilots look very good.  Pretty much all of them were foul-mouthed, money-grubbing and drunk womanizers who live in filthy houses or apartments, but, after the movie got off the ground, it really took off (pun intended).

The whole story is beautifully told after that beginning and the photography and directing (Charles Martin Smith) is stunning.  Annabella Piugattuk is wonderful to watch and Barry Pepper did a terrific job too.

I have seen this movie before and would recommend it without hesitation to anyone.",1389225600,,691,4.871794871794871

I have since recommended it to several friends who had not heard of it before. It's message is similar in my opinion to some of my other favorites, 'Whale Rider', 'Dances with Wolves' and 'Pocahontas'. Besides having a great story, acting and scenery, it was educational; giving some insight to what the Inuit culture is like and how they manage to survive where most non-Inuits cannot. Definitely watch it!!",1389225600,,553,4.770833333333333

2051685,5,B00020BVYW,This movie surprised me. It is an amazing survival movie but really about relationships and transformation and greater love. Watch it! Note: one very brief sex scene in the beginning.,1389225600,,183,5.133333333333334

2051692,5,B00020BVYW,"This was a story of survival and the human spirit.  I don't want to give away too much of the story, but the main character was a man who was impatient and somewhat shallow.  When he is confronted with harsh reality, he slowly begins to understand the important things in life.  I thought the acting was good and really enjoyed the story line.  Well done!",1389139200,,355,4.415384615384616

He's a bush pilot for heck sake. You don't become the star pilot for a company specializing in ""BUSH"" pilots and know nothing at all about the bush. I'm a woodsman and I consider most contingencies and plan for them. This guy? Not one. HE KNOWS NOTHING ""AT ALL"" ABOUT SURVIVAL IN THE BUSH ...hehehehe...but he's a bush pilot?
It could have had a good plot. Even a bush pilot, I'm damn sure could, use the help and knowledge of a bonafide Inuit.
Dumb guy aside, it's a really good looking movie. Come on, Norther Canada? What's not to like? The other little detail? Hey, maybe I'm just picky.",1389052800,,763,4.305555555555555

2051710,4,B00020BVYW,"At first I was a little skeptical I would like the movie because the lead actor (Pepper) was not that great in his beginning scenes.  He overacted in the first 30 mins, and into the interesting part of the story.  Eventually he  seemed to settle into his part and then became lots more believeable.

I really liked the female lead (Annabella Piugattuk) who played the Inuit woman. She brought a warmth to the story, and was able to get me to forget about the previously poor acting. Her character was quite interesting and helped really display the toughness that is required to live in such harsh conditions. All the while revealing the sensitive and spiritual nature of Inuit people . Annabella was the bright STAR here.

A small part played by Michael Buble, added a little fun--seeing him in a role.

I watched to the end, and by that time,  I was fully engrossed in the story, which turned out to be great.",1389052800,,911,4.552147239263804

2051712,5,B00020BVYW,"At first, I wasn't sure about watching this movie but i took a risk and i'm glad i did.  This is one of the few movies I could say that really moved me.  There's a lot of lessons in life you can learn just from this story.  You have a man who was an as******.  He was selfish, mean and ignorant about other cultures but also wrestling with the demons inside of him from his experience from the war.  Kanaalaq, the Inuit woman taught him a LOT about life from the short time they've spent together. She saved his life in so many different ways.  She taught him to respect nature and how to survive in the wilds.  She taught him the value of life.  She gave him hope when he didn't think there's any left in him.  She was sick and dying but she ended up taking care of him.  She taught him how to care, kindness, the value of friendship, respects for others, and most of all, LOVE.  I don't believe its a romantic relationship.  Its more like a friendship, a kindred spirit and maybe like love for someone like a sister.  She taught him not take people for granted and there's more to a person than what you see in the surface.  She taught him unconditional love.  Most of all, she taught him that life is hard but we human beings have an indomitable spirit.  I don't usually like to write reviews because it takes too long; however this one of those exceptions.  This movie is truly worth watching.  The actors, the writers and the director did a great job.  Wished there are more movies like thus that have more substance.",1388966400,,1522,4.295774647887324

2051722,5,B00020BVYW,"I have to say, I was just stunned at this movie as I didn't expect it to be so good.
It's somewhat of a predictable story, but in the end you just can't get over the ""message"" of the story and the visual beauty of how they filmed this.
Barry Pepper is just great, with his temper tantrums and ""ugly"" American behavior, it's almost comical.  All the while this Eskimo girl accompanying him is just so patient and at 100% ease being out in the wilderness.  How the movie builds, with her teaching him, is really fantastic.

This movie describes how humans can survive in an extreme condition with a strong will to survive - which almost sounds as if that has been described in many films and it is all the same.  Wrong.  There are several things I learned from this film: 1) the world was full of racism back in post-war; 2) but people can change their views through extreme experience; 3) people can even appreciate others lifestyle to survive in the extreme condition.  Spirituality of Inuits and the will to survive are merged well - and considerably violent (killing animals and eating their flesh raw) is not at all barbaric but essential to the film was quite sensational for me.  This is probably not based on a true story, but it reminds me that we can be surprised with what we can do.",1388793600,,888,4.390243902439025

Side note----if they were really looking for realism in the Inuit woman, why is she wearing so much makeup and have her brows so modernly done?  Excuse me, I think she would have looked better without makeup like the others on the beach she was with....That would have been more ""real"" and ""believable""...but what else is new...I guess her having TB required her to look better????",1388102400,,579,4.6568627450980395
2051777,3,B00020BVYW,"I wasn't expecting to like this movie when I first started to watch it. Survival stories aren't really my genre, but I was open to it and liked it much more than I had thought that I would.

The story is essentially about a pilot in Alaska in the 1950s who picks up a dying Inuit girl and their plane crashes and they must survive in the Alaskan tundra. I thought that the movie portrayed the desolation of Alaska very well and really helps to show the power of nature, and how humans tend to underestimate it. The friendship between Charlie and Kanaalaq is interesting and touching.

However, I was a bit surprised at Charlie's, ahem, stupidity on how to survive in the wilderness. The scene with the mosquitoes is the most shocking for me. Charlie is supposed to have been in the army and is now a pilot in one of the most desolated and dangerous lands in the world. You'd think he'd have had some survival training. I, who am the farthest thing possible from a wilderness expert or survivalist, had better ideas about what he should do about the mosquitoes than he did. Charlie panics and runs about flailing his arms and trying to swat at the insects, rather than zipping himself into his sleeping bag or running to the water, both places where he would have been relatively safe from the stings.

The beginning is also very misleading, because it looks like Charlie is carrying Kanaalaq, while the horizontal shape you see is actually his pack.

However, the story is interesting and different from anything I've watched before. No one really expected Kanaalaq to die, but it really does show the true power of nature and how harsh the wilderness-and life-can be.

The acting was great, as a side note.

All in all, this movie was good, but not great in my opinion. I just watched it because it was free with Amazon Prime; I wouldn't buy the movie.",1388102400,,1853,4.54954954954955

2051798,3,B00020BVYW,"Very slow to develop story line.  My advice is to continually do little skips ahead. But half way through I was committed to finding out what happens although I kinda knew.  Boy starts out as a jerk, boy has life threatening, life affirming experience, boy ends up not a jerk.  And it's Hallmark, so of course it has to have this slow, poignant music always playing in the background. Personally I don't know why it got more than 3 stars from people...it's not like it had academy award winning acting, or was a new story line.  Think of every lost in the wilderness after a plane crash movie you have ever seen and you will see it here.  So if you need to kill some time or watch a movie while you do your chores (ironing, cooking, cleaning, organizing) and don't want to be so riveted by the movie that you stop what you are doing...then...I highly recommend this one.",1387324800,,870,4.4125

Much better than Hollywood Dances with Wolves type cinema.

I have never seen this part of the North.  This film has changed how I visualize this huge area of our planet.  Almost swampy in the summer, one gets to see how this expanse transforms into a sheet of snow in winter.

The attack of millions of mosquitoes is a harrowing scene.

I could write a thousand words and still not totally convey the feeling. Against the harshest elements, two lone souls learn what it is to be different, yet the same. The acting of the two major characters was some of the best I've ever seen. I had never heard of the film, but stumbled upon it while browsing. I believe I am a much better person from having watched and lived through this experience with the characters. Both the male lead and the female lead will break your heart, but you will understand what genuine love is all about in the end. I would give the film A+++.

I wasn't surprised when the end credits revealed it was based on a book by Farley Mowat, whose ""Lost in the Barrens"" I had both read, watched, and enjoyed immensely.  This movie is worth viewing for its landscape alone, featuring awe inspiring aerial scenery shots across the sub-Arctic in the Northwest Territories.  It will be loved by those who enjoy exotic locations and beautiful scenery landscape films.  It will be enjoyed by those who love movies about crossing cultural barriers with a deep respect for the survival skills of native people.  It is also a movie with the ""man against nature"" theme that is done so well here, and always amazes me compared to our soft, fast food and high tech lifestyle.

2051839,1,B00020BVYW,"This film may be well intentioned, but the storyline is utterly ridiculous. Not even the ending could not save this film. I watched the whole thing and tried to like it, but the inconsistencies and ridiculousness were just to much to bear, to consider the scenario (as presented) realistic. Not even an idiot, woman, or child would be so stupid, as to leave the plane -(your only fuel, shelter, and tools, among other resources) in a survival situation; -not to mention, remaining close by it, so as to increase your chances of being spotted from the air. No one would consider walking 200 miles in a harsh unforgiving wilderness. Anyone would know (and as such affirm) that you need to stay together in a survival situation. No one would loose their rifle, ammunition, matches etc. in a survival situation, especially not a (military trained) bush pilot in Alaska who would certainly have this kind of knowledge and experience/common sense. No one would break out the windows or damage their only means of shelter in a fit of uncontrolled rage. These things are common sense. Then with no hunting experience whatsoever, with primitive, supposedly hand fashioned tools, he manages to kill not one, but three caribou/rain deer, by chasing them around. This is laughable. Lastly the girl speaks no English in the beginning of this film, and as time goes on, her English only improves? Give me a break.

I'm not an aviator, but it was pretty obvious the plane was a goner, but instead of trying to safely land the plane, he keeps pulling up and yelling angrily, until the plane just takes a nose-dive into a pond. Then he continues yelling at and cursing the plane and hitting it, and he leaves the silent, confused Inuit woman to fend for herself. After reaching the bank of the pond, he just stands there and watches her wade through the water. That night, while he warms himself by his fire, and she sits by hers, he yells, ""Can you speak any English?"" Sure, she speaks English, she just hasn't said anything since you met her.

Then, in an instant, the universe chooses to give us an opportunity to re-discover ourselves, to return to that place where the soul is. The Snow Walker is a simple and excellent dramatization of such a moment, and a reminder that the air we breathe, the warmth of our beds, the companionship of true friends, the love of families, the divine will to survive are all gifts from that place where the soul is. Im not sure how I chanced upon this film tonight, but I am grateful for the power of the message, the prompt to look at where Ive been and where I amknowing that if at any time the plane of my life crashes in the middle of nowhere, I must cling to and find strength in my soul to find my way home.",1381622400,,995,4.354838709677419

2051852,5,B00020BVYW,"Fewer things are more beautiful in life than true simplicity and selflessness. True humility, like true simplicity has a beauty that moves the human heart. Someone wrote they forgot they were watching a movie and felt they were intimately involved in the lives of the two main characters. Yes, so was I, transported to complete suspension of disbelief. Rare scenes of emptiness and the vast eternally nurturing yet killing wilderness play off of themes of friendship and hope...into a realm of transcendence through purification. Walk the thousands of miles of rocks and snow, endure the plagues of mosquitoes and the tragic illness of best friends, partnered in a kind of love that seldom is seen in film these days--pure friendship--life granting friendship, life nurturing mutual care. Then, walk like a man who died, was buried, and then on a later day arises from the dead...simplicity allows the symbolism to be archetypal, and the acting is perfect. It is absorbing, liberating and the entire piece is lovely, full of the best in human nature.  This movie doesn't weave in cheap sentiment, but sentiment that put me in mind of Willa Cather ""O! Pioneers"" or ""My Antonia""--not the content, but the atmosphere. This movie is filled with signs of continual redemption--wave after wave of resurgence of human hope after silence and challenges one after another--sentiments noble and worthy of humans struggling under the harshest conditions: A tale of two persons lifting each other on step ahead of the other, over and over. I am emotionally stimulated by the ""after-movie"" thoughts also. It is a movie that resonates long after the credits have rolled and the last drum beat and musical note is stopped...life (and the living of the spirit go on...continue in my mind after the movie is gone.)

 Images I can recall easily, music to soothe your soul! I recommended it to my most beloved persons. There are signs and symbols all through the movie that attach to the deep unconscious, and this power of archetypal evocation of depth sentiment will wash over your soul.",1380153600,,2070,5.011627906976744

This is a film about growth and character development, filled with strong acting, beautiful scenery (in a barren sense), and a great storyline.  I was most impressed by the development of the main character, who very easily could have been made into a jerk instead of a sympathetic person.  In fact, that was my main reason for hesitating before watching it--I've seen too many films about jerks who ""change their ways,"" and I wasn't interested in another one.  Pepper, though, does an admirable job of making Charlie a slightly unlikeable, self-centered protagonist who still have very good sides of himself to call upon.  Annabella Piugattuk does a great job with her character, too, and the two of them together are very believable and watchable.

The story does take some time to develop, but that's fine--it's time well spent on character development that makes the rest of the film work.  I think that the main thing that impressed me is that they've kept it simple on the surface, just like the landscape--but deep and complex at the same time.  They've learned the lessons that many Hollywood filmmakers need to learn, that simple and straightforward is often the most effective route to take.

2051893,5,B00020BVYW,"This is a BEAUTIFUL film.  Beautiful!  Based on Farley Mowat's short story ""Walk Well, My Brother"", The Snow Walker is the antithesis to any brash, loud, special effects type of film.  This is a quiet film, but it isn't boring in the least.

The basic story is that an arrogant former WWII pilot turned bush pilot (""Charlie"", played by Barry Pepper) based in the Northwest Territories of Canada circa 1953 agrees to transport a sick young Inuit woman (""Kanaalaq"", played by indigenous newcomer Annabella Piugattuk) to the hospital.  Their plane crashes hundreds of miles from civilization, leaving the two marooned and facing the nothingness of the Canadian tundra and wilderness.  The story of how they manage in this desolate wilderness and develop a relationship is the heart of this story.

Charlie does not respect and sees no value in the land, the Inuit or their way of live, beyond those things which he can sell back home (ivory, for example).  But Kanaalaq has lived there her whole life.  She knows how to survive.  And slowly he begins to see the value of what she has to teach him, because unquestionably, without her, he would be dead.  There are two scenes in which Charlie has a major freak-out (as I would, too, if I had crashed my plane in the middle of nowhere).  It was wonderful to see Kanaalaq observing Charlie during these scenes.  She was so calm.  What was a catastrophe for him was not one for her.  He saw nothing but certain death as all he had to rely on were his Western goods, all of which were lost within a week of the crash; she did not rely on matches, guns, and canned food.  She knew how to hunt, fish, sew, and make basic medicine and fire to survive.

This could so easily have become a ""white man bad, native people good"" type of film, and it isn't that at all.  And bravo! for allowing Charlie's and Kanaalaq's relationship to develop into a brother/sister bond, not a romantic one.  There is minimal dialogue.  Beautiful scenery.  The director lets this story unfold in its own time.  The two lead actors are wonderful.  I have heard of Barry Pepper before, but don't know what he has been in.  Annabella Piugattuk was simply wonderful as Kanaalaq.  James Cromwell is in this movie as well, although he chewed the scenery a bit too much for me.

I was blown away by how much I loved this film.  If you are looking for a good, well-told story, outside of the basic Hollywood shoot `em up genre, please give The Snow Walker a viewing.  I know I keep repeating the word ""beautiful"", but this is a wonderful and--yes beautiful!--film well worth an hour and a half of your time.

To me, the irony of the story is that the civilized man who looks down upon the natives as being backward and stupid, would have died in that barren land if it weren't for the survival skills of the sick native woman. While the pilot has temper trantrums, the woman takes out her little fishing pole and catches a fish.

2051913,5,B00020BVYW,"When I read the review of the military officer stating his opinions I wanted to respond , hopefully without undue
arrogance.
Even though I agree in part with his assertion that serious mistakes were made by the pilot there are atleast 2 factors that come into play that are relevant. First , he was deliberately flying out of his flight-plan
to do some (probably illegal) trading with the Innuit. Secondly , he was arrogant and felt bigger than life , maybe
this is something we could all learn from. As a mountaineer I know how mistakes and arrognce can cause us to lose life and limb. When the pilot did go down he realized that he was on a tundra probably a couple hundered miles out of his flight plan and that as he later said ,"" we were dead when we hit the ground"". Realize this , the tundra on which they crashed , where only scattered Innuit live is larger than the whole midwest of the US by 5 times??

Almost dying , and losing all my toes I have been in situations not nearly as dire. Myself , and the pilot probably would be court martialled in your army and justifiably so . But again 2 things come to mind : we all make mistakes and God hates a coward.

Now if you can get past this and see the film for what it is I think that you'll see the real purpose of the story.

Barry just isn't noticed enough and he's a marvelous actor. He does an incredible job in this film.

I, like another reviewer, was a little let down by the ending. I thought it seemed to be missing an epilogue.

It's a feel good story that has a bittersweet ending and the lovely thing is that many Inuit and Canadian actors were used in the film, including the lead actress, who really could hunt, fish, field dress a caribou (take that Sarah Palin) and sew clothing from animal hides, as portrayed by her character.

2051919,5,B00020BVYW,"The Snow Walker focuses on two characters: a bush pilot named Charles Halliday (played by Barry Pepper) and a young Inuit woman named Kanaalaq (played by Annabella Piugattuk).  It is 1953.  Halliday makes a stop with his float plane in a remote northern area when he comes across some Inuit who convince him to take Kanaalaq on board for the purpose of flying her to a hospital in Yellowknife.  She is apparently suffering from tuberculosis or a similar illness.  The plane crashes en route however and the two find themselves far from human civilization.  Halliday is distraught from the loss of his plane but still tries his best to get help for the two of them.  He soon learns however that he is the student and his companion is the teacher when it comes to the subject of survival.

The dialogue is simple but moving as the two main characters begin to open up with each other.  There is an exchange of cultures that takes place and I dare say that Charlie has the most to gain.  Kanaalaq speaks little English but what she says; what she shares with Charlie resonates with him and warms his soul.  She is quiet but sure.

The images/cinematography throughout the film are gorgeous.

It is ironic that Charles Martin Smith directed this beautiful film about survival in the artic as he was the main character in Never Cry Wolf, another masterpiece set in the north.

2051920,5,B00020BVYW,"This surprising and startling film should not be forgotten. In a way it encapsulates much of what is wrong with the way that modern people view traditional societies, and their wisdom, what they have to offer that the modern world seems to have forgotten. It is also a film about the potential for personal transformation and growth in character, and the lengths that some must go to in order to be shed of their paradigm bound, wrong minded views. Those views are stripped away, one by one, and turned upside down, for the main character, a cocky and callow bush pilot who is a long way from home. After crashing his plane in the wilderness, he seems to little grasp the situation in which he finds himself, preferring to sit around and wait for rescue while the sick Inuit woman he has agreed to transport for medical treatment attempts to prepare for survival in an unforgiving landscape. Her people have made their lives here since the last ice age. She knows something about survival. She has skills. Once he finally realizes that nobody is coming for them, he abandons her, with a little food, assuming he has a better chance without her. Now, his real education begins. He quickly injures himself, becomes lost, eaten by insects, he is on the verge of death from exposure then the young woman, who has tracked him down, nurses him back to health, and with her dying strength, outfits him with the traditional clothing and skills that he will need to make it back to civilization. This is a profoundly poignant and deeply touching film that serves as a reminder for those who are quick to judge others on the basis of their own prejudice.  When he finally makes it back, I would be willing to bet that he would forever regard the episode as life changing, and the woman he initially dismissed as nothing more than a sick Indian, and a worthless burden, to be his savior and teacher. How different would his life have been had he successfully landed the plane in Yellow Knife and dumped her at the hospital. By crashing his plane in the Arctic tundra, he was given a chance for a kind of death and rebirth. He crash landed at the edge of the abyss and walked back to life.

The story of a 'civilized man' becoming enmeshed in traditional tribal societies who is transformed by the encounter is an old, old literary trope--that it keeps eternally springing up is a testament to not only the romantic appeal of the notion, but the instinctive recognition that something is missing from modern realities that was part and parcel of the archaic human predicament, and that dialogue between the new and the primordial worlds is necessary for moderns to realize the extent to which their wholeness has been compromised by imported strawberries in January, by jet planes and wireless communication. In the civilized world everything is dependent on everything else--pull one linchpin, and the systems collapse. But the original situation involved small bands of people working together to scrape the resources out of the local environment on a daily basis, through their own skill and ingenuity. The closest thing to a stock market crash on the great tundra was a herd of caribou running away after an unsuccessful hunt--which meant your survival, and those around you, was in your own hands, on your own merits. If you had to lie motionless in the snow for ten hours along a seal breathing hole for one chance at a strike with the harpoon you made with your own hands--or go home to starving children, so be it. The ease of civilized life, and the interdependency of those systems, obscures some of these basic, original realities, and robs us of the pleasure of the confidence of knowing that we live day to day through the skill and perseverance of our own heart by our own hand. Could YOU make a kayak out of seal skins and whale bones and then push off onto arctic seas to kill a whale with a Walrus tusk spear tip? Could you track a polar bear across the frozen ice for days on end and carry its hide and its meat home to your wife and children, armed only with a coiled sliver of bone? Think about it.

The story, cast, direction and production values are all outstanding. I found the film particularly moving as someone very important to me looks very much like Annabella Piugattuk, and acts to a great extent like Kanaalaq, and I could easily see this woman doing what Kanaalaq does near the end of the trek.

This film deserved wider exposure, and is a credit to Canadian film making (albeit with an excellent American director), high praise from me since I am no booster of the usually mediocre output of ""Canadian Culture"".

For starters, I think Murray starts off too late, when F1 was already on the decline.  ""Decline"", you might ask?  ""F1 is now bigger than ever before"", you might add ... Well, not in the minds of a band of fanatical race minds that lived through the days when F1 was really a sport, when tracks were actual race circuits (think old Nurburgring, Spa, Monza, Reims, Jarama, Montjuic, Silverstone, to mention but a few), when cars had individual characters (iconic Loti, Ferraris, Brabham, etc.), and when drivers were friends.

This video seems rather confusing; a tribute of sorts to Murray's close friend and colleague, James Hunt; but through Walker's biased pro-Brit presentation (Mansell and Damon Hill ad nauseam), much is lost.  Brief mentions of Villeneuve and Pironi rekindled my interest and the highlight on this whole video is the classic dual between Rene Arnoux and Gilles Villeneuve at Dijon in 1979. If anything, this product is worth owning for only that reason; but as a whole, it was a little too late to save this video.  Over the years, Murray Walker contributed much to the enjoyment of F1; but this video DNQ, unfortunately.",1288656000,,1500,4.972
2051935,5,B00020BVYW,"I love it when I stumble upon films like this one, where the beauty of the story resounds throughout.  A classic story of clashing cultures and ideas, where mere survival forces the two to cast them aside and work together.  Granted it's the bush pilot who has the most to gain in doing so, namely his life.

Nature plays a key role in this story, where, as always, it's power isn't fully appreciated nor understood by the bush pilot.  That nearly costs him his life, and it's only after he comes to understand this aided by an ailing Eskimo that he nearly refused to help, that he begins down the path of discovery.

What he discovers, and the way he discovers it, gives this film a lot of endearing moments, and adds to the depth of the story.

Well worth a viewing or two.

It's ALWAYS the white man that is inept, foolish, hot-headed, greedy, stupid.  Many white men are those things, but every time they're in a situation where the Native shows the way?  If one is a bush pilot, I would assume one would have acquired some knowledge of bush survival just in case you go down.  You would have survival gear in your plane (even though it was summer, wouldn't you have the basics?).  You'd have heard tales of other pilots going down, getting lost, etc. and would've been prepared.  The movie showed this guy as an arrogant bird-brain with the survival skills of a bank teller from downtown Peoria.  The Native woman was wonderful and her skills rang true for the most part, but why she put up with some of his dumb ideas (walking back to the plane) I have no idea.

A well-made film about an arrogant bush pilot and a sick Inuit woman stranded in the Canadian wilderness, The Snow Walker doesn't do anything notably or exceptionally well but it moves quickly and never insults the audience's intelligence; if you're the type of person--as I am--who likes stories about survival, you could do a lot worse than The Snow Walker.

2051944,5,B00020BVYW,"We recognize him as the world-weary WWII pilot. He's tasted death over Germany, the steaks of Montreal, the numerous girls of the Yukon. Outwardly boisterous, inwardly wounded, he flies the NW territories to pass the time and pay the bills, and if he 'sees' the local Eskimos at all, its as a profit-making opportunity.  Since he is spiritually stranded, once he is stranded for real, would he think twice of abandoning her to 'find help'?  In a part of his mind, we are all abandoned, or, as another character relates, we are 'all alone in this world'.

But what motivates her?  Time and time again, this young Inuit, gravely stricken with tuberculosis, appears by his side to rescue him from his own folly.  Why?  This morose invalid doesn't start the film in a promising way, yet we see a woman transformed by the opportunity to care.  This woman has trained her whole life to be someone's wife, her hero was her mother.  Cruelly, TB has apparently robbed her of her mission.  Yet, the plane-wreck that strands them represents a chance to put into practice her short lifetime of training.  Will he let her?  In the 'real world', his friends search for him.  But, like him, they are hobbled by a modern attitude of 'we're all alone in this world' that repeatedly makes their efforts fall short of rescue.  Will her more traditional attitude make the difference?

The good woman fishes, she catches small game, and she sews, and sews, and sews.  Her heroism is completely traditional, it's poignancy informed by her illness.  Her reverence for the dead is also fully formed and uncompromising.  If it came to it, she would give her lifes-blood for her loved ones.  And she would never abandon another person, unless...

In the frozen Arctic wilderness, abandonment lies just outside your door.  As her mother taught her, if she should ever go there, it would not be for herself.

2051950,5,B00020BVYW,"After adding a film about Native Americans to my shopping cart, ""The Snow Walker"" frequently showed up as a recommended movie for me to purchase.  I finally took a look at the description, but was hesitant to buy it (it was not available here in Helena for rent) as it did not sound like it really was about Native Americans, based upon the description and reviews.  None-the-less, I decided to buy the film based upon the praise for it, and I am so very glad that I did.  Let me state for the record, that if I had understood that the story was an adaptation of another book by Farley Mowat, author of book for which the film ""Never Cry Wolf"" was based upon, I would have been much quicker to purchase this movie.

Barry Pepper, as Charlie Halliday, gives a very powerful and endearing performance; with one exception.  While the language of his character's bigotry was included--but clearly diluted for the film--Barry Pepper's personality (and performance, perhaps) just did not fit the role.  That is, Pepper just did not act like a hard core bigot that the role called for.  As such, his ""transformation"" in the film was less powerful than I suspect was the case in the book.  Regardless of the potency of Charlie Halliday's bigotry, Barry Pepper excelled in portraying the character's other traits.  ""New comer"" Annabella Piugattuk, as Kanaalaq, the Native woman that Halliday interacts with (and learns to become a ""Snow Walker"" from), is absolutely perfect in her performance--I hope we will see more of her in the future.

As for being categorized as a ""Native American"" film, ""The Snow Walker"" is not about Native Americans; it is about two individuals from two different cultures, whose lives become interdependent by circumstances of life.  Through Barry's character, we learn a little bit about the type of person who ""runs away to the bush"" with minimal survival skills.  Through Annabelle's character we learn a little bit about an Inuit woman who is trying ""to live through"" a disease for which her body has limited inherited immunity to protect her from it.  The movie is about a man's tenacity to survive the ""wilderness"" after surviving World War II; about his ego and ultimate surrender of that ego to survive.  It is about a woman steeped in understanding life in the ""wilderness,"" having lived there her entire life; about her reticence and ultimate decision to share her knowledge and skills to survive.  To a lesser degree, the film is a metaphor for Native-Non Native culture interactions, and what potential could be had if both could ""surrender"" and learn.

The primary drawback (like that for ""Never Cry Wolf"") to ""The Snow Walker,"" from my perspective, is that the topic is one that has limited appeal for viewers.  And unlike ""Never Cry Wolf"" that appealed to (and was essentially promoted to) children, ""The Snow Walker"" is geared towards an adult audience, and relies much more upon characters and drama.  To that end, ""The Snow Walker"" is wonderfully brilliant.  Like so many Canadian films, ""The Snow Walker"" deserves greater world wide recognition.

2051968,4,B00020BVYW,"Quick plot review: arrogant Euro-Canadian pilot learns survival and life skills from ailing but industrious Inuit woman when they are stranded on the tundra.

The Snow Walker starts out a bit shakily, with several actors including Barry Pepper awkwardly delivering their lines. I didn't buy Pepper's portrayal of the cocksure bush pilot with the anger management problem; several of his emotional blow-ups seemed faintly ridiculous and self-consciously ""acted."" But Pepper improves dramatically as his character softens and matures in response to the ministrations of Kanaalaq (solidly played by lively newcomer Annabella Piuggatuk). Thankfully, there is no disturbingly neo-colonialist Captain John Smith-Pocahontas love match to distract from the power of the fraternal relationship that does spring up between this Euro-Canadian man and Inuit woman (fraternal relationships in general are too often given short shrift in movies). The miming-charades style of communication between these two was sometimes rendered puzzling when Kanaalaq would later jump in with the English translation she knew along.

The biggest miss-steps in my opinion were the contrived girlfriend (""Estelle"") storyline--again, as though the writers felt the audience needs that romantic connection to feel grief over the situation--and the related ""search and rescue"" drama of the gung-ho young searcher and his caustic co-pilot. James Cromwell was sadly wasted in a very minor role; much as I hate to say it, they could have done away with his part altogether. Also, it's important to keep in mind that this movie (and its source material by Farley Mowat) does nothing to remedy the unfortunately common film convention of the European (often, but not always male) aided in survival and general ""life skills"" by willing Native...

***SEMI-SPOILER
...who becomes means of European's redemption before meeting an untimely/tragic end.
*****SEMI-SPOILER OVER***

But these are minor quibbles in a movie with a simple but time-tested and effective ""survival"" storyline (come on, we're always riveted by those), the well-filmed and stark beauty of the tundra, and the Mychael Danna score (not among his best, but still evocative). I am giving this an extra star because the DVD has the best Extra/Bonus features I have ever seen on an independent movie of this low profile and limited distribution. There are interviews with several key players including the screenwriters, director, crew members, actors, and composer; plus a fully produced ""Making of"" documentary that is at least 30 minutes long, has its own alternative-rock soundtrack, and takes us through the entire process, from the casting of then-unknown Piugattuk at a local teen dance, to the crew's run-ins with polar bears while filming on the tundra.",1181520000,5,2786,5.517564402810304

Charlie Halliday transforms from being a charming but arrogant, short-tempered, booze drinking, partying pilot to being a reflective, resourceful and caring human-being, a Snow Walker who lives the way of the Eskimos.

It is the Eskimo Woman Kanalaaq who is responsible for his complete transformation.  In the beginning, Charlie accepts (due to a bribe of ivory) to take the ailing Kanalaaq to a city hospital.  However, it is Kanalaaq who ends up saving Charlie, both physically and spiritually:  She saves his life after he collapses from exhaustion, starvation and bug bites (yes, they are that severe!) by applying traditional healing.  In one of the most powerful scenes of the movie, she heals his soul by freeing him from the trauma he suffered from his actions as a World War II fighter pilot by entering his dream and staying his hand from pulling the trigger.  She continues to transform him by teaching him the ways of her people, both physical skills such as hunting, fishing and igloo building, but also the traditions of her people, such as their views of life and death, family and brotherhood, and their connection to the land and animals.  As Kanalaaq becomes sicker, their roles reverse, as Charlie, who has now completely transformed from his original selfish nature, uses the knowledge she has taught him to care for her.

In today's world in which our lives have become barren in the pursuit of toys and power, this truly inspiring movie allows us to see that change is possible. In a world filled with shallow, meaningless relationships it is incredibly uplifting to see two people grow to truly care about one another.

Why not 5 stars? The movie spends too much time on unnecessary elements that have nothing to do with the main plot.  You could forward the parts of the crew looking for Charlie, Charlie's friends and girl friend grieving for him, Charlie's friends and family throwing him a funeral thinking he is dead, and not miss anything.

Annabella Piugattuk is simply incredible in the role of the seriously ill woman that needs immediate medical attention. But on their way to another location, the plane suffers mechanical problems and they crash in the vast arctic wastes of the distant north.

The scenery is authentic looking, the perils faced as the pilot sets out on foot for a settlement some 100 miles away considerable. Having left the young woman behind at the crash site, he is ill-equipped to survive the long walk. He ends up near death, saved by the skills of the Inuit woman who has followed him. She nurses him until his strength returns and here is where the logic problem arises.

The pilot figures he has walked 5 days at between 15 to 20 miles per day. Figuring on the low side, he would now be between 20 to 25 miles away from the settlement and rescue. Instead, he decides to return the 75 to 80 miles back to the crash site because he heard a plane overhead and believes that searchers likely found their crashed plane. Lemme see now, which makes more sense... 20 to 25 miles to the settlement... or 75 to 80 miles back to the crash on the possibility searchers might have discovered the location? Which would be logical or intelligent.

The answer is obvious to this bleeding idiot, who returns to the plane crash, only to discover that nobody has located the wreck! Great! Now he is once again 100 miles from safety rather than 20 to 25 from the settlement that he was when the Inuit woman found him! Meanwhile, she is getting sicker by the day, and the pilot learns from her and develops an appreciation and respect for her culture.

Once the learn that nobody has discovered the crashed plane, the pilot throws a snit for several weeks, staying holed up in the wreck. Eventually they start walking toward the settlement again, while she becomes incapactiated by tuberculosis. Brilliant.

This is a wonderful movie, with fantastic landscapes and a wild environment that should make this a compelling and marvelous addition to your DVD collection. Except that the illogic displayed ruin the artistic value that was invested into the project.

I enjoyed the movie to the very last few minutes, when the outcome became clear, and left me simply furious. Perhaps I have a Pollyanna view of the world, but I cling to the hope, the abiding belief, that nobody can truly be that stupid. Why would someone walk 75 to 80 miles across some of the most hostile wilderness known to man, and being within 20 to 25 miles of safety and rescue, decide to retrace his steps back to the original crash site.

Instead, he decides to return the 75 to 80 miles back to the crash site because he heard a plane overhead and believes that searchers likely found their crashed plane. Lemme see now, which makes more sense... 20 to 25 miles to the settlement... or 75 to 80 miles back to the crash on the possibility searchers might have discovered the location? Which would be logical or intelligent.

The answer is obvious to this bleeding idiot, who returns to the plane crash, only to discover that nobody has located the wreck! Great! Now he is once again 100 miles from safety rather than 20 to 25 from the settlement that he was when the Inuit woman found him! Meanwhile, she is getting sicker by the day, and the pilot learns from her and develops an appreciation and respect for her culture.

Once the learn that nobody has discovered the crashed plane, the pilot throws a snit for several weeks, staying holed up in the wreck. Eventually they start walking toward the settlement again, while she becomes incapactiated by tuberculosis. Brilliant.

This is a wonderful movie, with fantastic landscapes and a wild environment that should make this a compelling and marvelous addition to your DVD collection. Except that the illogic displayed ruin the artistic value that was invested into the project.

I enjoyed the movie to the very last few minutes, when the outcome became clear, and left me simply furious. Perhaps I have a Pollyanna view of the world, but I cling to the hope, the abiding belief, that nobody can truly be that stupid. Why would someone walk 75 to 80 miles across some of the most hostile wilderness known to man, and being within 20 to 25 miles of safety and rescue, decide to retrace his steps back to the original crash site.

It simply does not make any sense whatsoever, and ruined an otherwise totally brilliant film!",1142985600,3,2812,4.634538152610442

2051992,5,B00020BVYW,"Adapted from a short story in Farley Mowat's book 'The Snow Walker', this is a great film! Based on a true story, a young pilot looks down his nose at the Inuit ('Husky's, as he disrespectfully calls them). He stops at an Inuit camp on his delivery route and is soon burdened with a very sick young woman. He's given some ivory to transport a young Inuit woman with T.B. to yellowknife, and due to his greed, reluctantly agrees. But after his plane crashes in the middle of nowhere, he must rely on her to survive. He's completely out of his element and quickly becomes the 'burden'. He watches her work constantly, and unselfishly to ensure his survival, though her illness leaves her weak. He soon understands how shallow he was to see these Natives as 'dependent fools'.

The scenery is beautiful and the story line brings out the true spirit of an amazing culture.

Most of the film centers around the survival of a stranded pilot and a native girl who are both lost in the Canadian tundra. It's beautifully done and very well acted.

I really enjoyed this film.  Beautiful scenery, characters, and a portrayal of the differences between our so-called ""advanced"" society and that of indigenous tribes is highlighted in a poignant way.

This movie is about a young, immature, and typcial cocky American pilot who becomes stranded with a young, spiritually aware Intuit woman.  They develop a friendship and a non-sexual love that is transforming as they both survive the harsh elements in the wilderness. It is a beautifully done, and thought-provoking film that haunts one for days after seeing it.

It is appropriate for all ages.  There are some graphic hunting scenes, but this is realistic of the wilderness survival lifestyle the characters were leading; however, these may be difficult for young children to see.

I wish that more films were made like this!

2051996,4,B00020BVYW,"The scenery, although minimal, is beautiful.  A cynical, crude young pilot develops an attachment for the young Inuit woman he is with when his plane crashes and he is attempting to get back to his world.  But during this time he is in her world.

That this attachment develops, and that he eventually develops humility, and deep affection for his companion is no surprise.  Either is it a surprise to find that this young woman knows how to survive in this desolate land.

The issue that got my attention is the comparison between the society of these indigenous people vs. our society.  For millennia, these Inuits have lived the same way, and their contact with other civilizations appears minimal.  Their hope seems to be to maintain their existence and to pass on this same existence to those that come after them.

On the other hand, Westerners, in general, are always trying to make changes in their lives, in what they leave for the next generations.  We are never satisfied to live the same life as our fathers, and we make every attempt to progress to something better.  We believe in progress.  Whether by choice or by chance, these primitive peoples apparently do not.

So, which life is more rewarding?  They know who their Gods are and what they want of them.  They know where their Gods live, and they know where their people go when they die.  There is a certainty in their lives that we, with all our  sophistication, and with all of our yearning for progress do not have.

What is better?  I am a Westerner, and I would prefer the life I see around me, with all of its uncertainties and cruelty of people to each other.  But I can just as well understand the other side.  The yearning of these indigenous peoples for consistency in life, and learning how to come to grips with the cruelties of nature, for knowing, in absolute terms, their place in the universe, has its rewards.

This movie brings these questions to the fore, whether it meant to or not.",1137974400,3,1973,4.595988538681948
2051997,5,B00020BVYW,"Why didn't the movie moguls pick this special film for theatrical release? This is a heartwarming movie about a

self-confident, arrogant bush pilot who (for profit) agrees to deliver an Inuit girl to the hospital in Canada.  The plane crashes and he and her are left to survive.  Initially, he foolishly strikes out on his own, intending to leave the girl

to die in the cold, but the positions are reversed and she

discovers him nearly dead, cures him, and teaches him how to survive in the Arctic wilderness...not only as an Eskimo but as a man.  Some parts of the film are poetic, others terrifying.

I can think of very few movies which are more shocking than

the scene where the hero faces a plague of mosquitoes and collapses in pain and exhaustion to die.  Not only is some of the photography gorgeous but the Inuit actress - Annabella Piaugattuk - who plays the female role is terrific in every sense.

2051999,5,B00020BVYW,"This wonderful film is based upon the short story, ""Walk Well, My Brother"", which appears in an anthology of short stories titled, ""The Snow Walker"", written by Canadian icon, Farley Mowat. The story takes place somewhere near the Artic in 1953 and opens with a shadowy figure traipsing slowly across a frozen wasteland. The film then flashes back to a time three months earlier in a settlement called ""Yellow Knife"", located somewhere in the Northwest Territories of Canada.  A raucous sort of place, the viewer is introduced to a young and  handsome, former World War II fighter pilot named Charles Halliday (Barry Pepper). He is a free living, arrogant, hot dogging young gun, who now flies over the frozen wastelands of the far north, working as a bush pilot for a man named Shepherd (James Cromwell).

While making a routine delivery in a desolate area, he is met by a small family of Inuit with a seemingly tubercular daughter (Annabella Piugattuk)) who clearly needs medical attention. They request that Johnny take her to the hospital in Yellow Knife but Johnny refuses to do so. When they bribe him with some valuable ivory tusks, he has a change of heart, taking the young woman on board.  Unfortunately, the small aircraft experiences technical difficulties, and they crash in the frozen tundra, a couple of hundred miles from civilization, but are physically relatively unhurt by the crash.

Thinking that he would do better on his own, Charlie divests himself of the young woman, leaving her with some supplies but believing that he is consigning her to her death. He is a young man with little respect for the Inuit people. He simply does not see the value in their culture, which he does not understand, and marches off into the bleak wilderness on his own. He, who is a whiz with machinery, has little knowledge on how to survive in that bleak but beautiful wasteland. Consequently,  by the time he is about a week into his trek through this unforgiving tundra, he is overcome by nature and the vicissitudes of this harsh and alien environment.  Fortunately for him, the young woman he left behind is far more resourceful than he is. She catches up with him, finding him on the brink of death, and nurses him back to life,  becoming the key to his survival.

It is only after all this happens that he bothers to learn that she is called Kanaalaq. Slowly, he learns to connect with this young woman in a way that he has never connected with anyone. He learns to appreciate her, discovering that she is beautiful both inside and out. Through his relationship with Kanaalaq, whom he begins to regard as a little sister, he learns how to love another human being, becoming reborn as a better person in the process. He also learns to connect to the land and, in doing so, finds the strength to survive his ordeal. Kanaalaq ends up giving Charlie Halliday the gift of life.

What happens to Charlie and Kanaalaq, how they manage, and how their relationship develops is at the heart of this  film. It is the story of two cultures that  come together and seamlessly mesh in order to survive out on the frozen tundra.  It is an intensely moving and deeply personal film that is simply beautiful. With a minimum of dialogue, this film sends out a major message.

Barry Pepper is terrific in the role of Charlie Halliday, a flawed human being who manages to overcome his shortcomings and become all the better for his ordeal. He infuses the character with a certain charisma, so that when his shortcomings become apparent, the viewer does not dislike him but, rather, hopes that he will see the error of his ways and find redemption. Newcomer Annabella Piugattuk is simply sensational, giving a well-nuanced and very touching performance in the role of the dying Inuit girl, Kanaalaq. Her role is central to the film, and she is a breakout star. They searched for six months, until they found her, having auditioned hundreds of young women in the process, as they were looking for someone indigenous to the area to fill the female lead. The casting director discovered her at a local teen dance in the Northwest Territories, and what a find she is.

This Canadian production was the recipient of numerous Genie nominations, which are the Canadian equivalent of Academy Award nominations, and  are conferred by the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television. I have to say that, in recent years,  I have been mightily impressed with the originality, quality, and sophistication of Canadian films. They are sometimes simply the best films to be found. This one is no exception. Deftly directed by Charles Martin Smith, who is also an actor, he  fully understands the concept that less is oftentimes more and exacts powerful performances from the entire cast. Moreover, he perfectly captures the majesty, beauty, and sheer bleakness of the landscape that acts as the backdrop for this beautiful story. Bravo!",1128816000,,4909,4.816884661117717

2052001,5,B00020BVYW,"Shot in the far northern regions of Canada, this well-done story of survival in the Arctic wilderness is also a fascinating 90-minute journey into the heart of Inuit culture. Covering only three months of time in 1953, the film follows the transformation of an arrogant and impulsive young pilot into a man of compassion, courage, and a native-inspired resourcefulness.

The story is simple: a white man and an ill Inuit woman he has agreed to fly to a hospital are stranded on the trackless tundra when his plane crashes. Hundreds of miles from the nearest settlement, they wait for rescue that never comes. The short Arctic summer ends and winter looms as they face their dilemma separately and then together.

The photography is stunning. It cries out to be seen on a big screen. The performances are wonderful, especially the 19-year-old Inuit actress, Annabella Piugattuk. Director Charles Martin Smith creates a movie experience that recalls his wonderful film, ""Never Cry Wolf."" The DVD has a high-spirited making-of-the-movie documentary which reveals much about the on-location logistics required to shoot a film under wilderness conditions, among polar bears (none of which appear in the film), and for part of the time under sub-zero conditions.

Set in 1953 in northern Canada, a bush pilot, played by Barry Pepper, agrees to fly a seriously ill young Inuit woman, who seems to have tuberculosis, to a town where she can get medical attention. He's reluctant to do this but her family bribes him with a pair of walrus tusks.  Played by first-time actress Annabella Piugattuk, this Intuit woman is outstanding in her role, as she helps the pilot to survive after their plane crashes and also teaches him some valuable lessons about life.

Yes, this is a hackneyed story with no real surprises.  But under the expert hand of writer/director Charles Martin Smith, the film comes out better than the sum of its parts.  I found myself completely drawn in and also learned a lot about survival in the frozen north.  I applaud the director's decision to use an authentic Inuit actress in the main role which made the film seem real.

Sort of a cross between ""Flight of the Phoenix"" and ""Nanook of the North,"" ""The Snow Walker"" tells the true story of Charles Martin Smith, a bush pilot in 1935 who crash landed his plane on the Canadian tundra with a seriously ill Inuit woman as his sole passenger (he reluctantly picked her up at a remote camp, agreeing to fly her to a hospital for treatment).  Stranded in the middle of nowhere, miles away from the nearest town or human settlement and with little or no hope of ever being rescued, the two struggled for survival against both the elements and the disease that continually threatened to take the woman's life.

Smith is presented to us at the outset as a cocky, self-assured young man who feels, as a white man, innately superior to the natives who inhabit this far northern region of the globe.  It isn't until he is forced to rely on the instinctive cunning and acquired wisdom of this young Eskimo woman that he comes to understand and appreciate the beauty and majesty of her people in their oneness with nature.

What starts off as a decent little tale of survival soon blossoms into a touching love story between two people from totally different worlds who connect at the very deepest levels of bonded commitment and mutual self-reliance.  Despite the fact that Kaanalaq can barely speak a word of English and Smith not a word of Inuit, the two of them learn to communicate almost entirely through expression and gesture, coming to a shared understanding of the other's worth as a human being.  Barry Pepper and newcomer Annabella Piugattuk achieve a real rapport as the unlikely lovers thrown together by a capricious, perhaps even cruel, but certainly life-altering trick of fate.  There are also fine performances from Kiersten Warren, James Cromwell and Jon Gries as just some of the people back at the base fretting over Smith's unexplained disappearance.

""The Snow Walker"" makes full use of its unusual setting, showing us how harsh and unforgiving nature can be to humans who happen to wander into the most remote regions of this immense planet.  But it is as a love story, rather than an adventure tale, that ""The Snow Walker"" ultimately connects with its audience.",1122681600,11,2208,4.802110817941952
2052018,5,B00020BVYW,"""The Snow Walker"" is based on a short story by Canadian author Farley Mowat, ""Walk Well My Brother."" Charles Martin Smith, who wrote the screenplay and directed the film, is also an actor, (Terry ""The Toad"" Fields in ""American Graffiti""), and starred in another Mowat adaptation, ""Never Cry Wolf.""

Mowat is one of the only writers I know who is able to capture and communicate the essence of life in the Arctic wilderness. Barry Lopez is another. This beautiful, haunting movie evokes the ways of the Inuit peoples of the Canadian Arctic, illustrating how human beings are capable of living in harmony with their environment, and of creating honorable societies. Farley Mowat writes of survival and courage, of superstition and destiny, of loyalty to family and tribe in an isolated, untamed, often brutal land. ""The Snow Walker"" truly captures these themes, as well as the visual magnificence of northern Canada's panorama - the majesty of her vast snowy plains, the monotony of the tundra, thousands of sparkling watery inlets, the extraordinary quality of light, and the variety of wildlife. Cinematographers David Connell, Jon Joffin and Paul Sarossy did a fantastic job. The photography is especially memorable during a misty morning caribou hunt.

""The Snow Walker"" is set in the Canadian Northwest Territories, near the Arctic Ocean's Queen Maud Gulf during the summer/autumn of 1953. Arrogant bush pilot, Charlie Halliday, (Barry Pepper), flies supplies and people around the Arctic, and occasionally makes some extra money selling pelts and ivory which he gets from the indigenous population. He exploits the Inuit's shamelessly, without wasting a moment's thought, trading them chocolate and Coca-Cola for their valuable goods. Halliday is a WWII veteran, an angry young man, who apparently still suffers nightmares from the horrors he experienced serving as a bomber pilot over Germany. He's handsome in a macho way, with his chiseled features and cocky manner. Women flock to him and he is out for a good time, not much more.

On a routine flight ferrying cargo, he picks up a sick Inuit woman named Kanaalaq, (Annabella Piugattuk), agreeing to take her to a hospital in return for two ivory walrus tusks, offered as payment by her family. He refuses to transport her for free, even though she is visibly suffering from tuberculoses. On the plane trip back to the air base in Yellowknife, serious engine problems occur and the plane crashes. Charlie and Kanaalaq are badly shaken but not really harmed - however, they are stranded in the middle of an immense, desolate wilderness.

Charlie foolishly leaves his plane and the woman, promising, in sign language, to return with help when he reaches the nearest town. He attempts to trek over 200 miles in an old pair of boots, and collapses after a downpour which results in the hatching of millions of mosquitoes who all want to drink his blood. Predictably, Kanaalaq rescues him and proves to be more resilient than she looks,  in spite of her deteriorating condition. She teaches him survival skills, and they attempt to learn each other's languages. The story chronicles the growing friendship between the two, as autumn closes in, bringing the danger of freezing temperatures and blizzards.

The story of man's survival in the wild is an old one, but ""The Snow Walker"" is filmed in a fresh way and is extremely effective as a drama. The performance of first time actress Annabella Piugattuk is amazing. She is able to communicate so much with her expressive face and eyes, a few words in English, and her own language, Inuktitut. Barry Pepper is superb as Charlie - really perfect casting. James Cromwell plays Charlie's boss who hates to give up on the search for his ""best pilot,"" and buddy. There are some slow moments, however, when the scene switches from wilderness to the worried friends back in Yellowknife.

I am partial to anything that has to do with the Arctic, but this is an exceptional and poignant film. Author Barry Lopez believes that ""natural landscapes are capable of bestowing a grace upon those who pass through them."" Certainly Charlie Halliday is transformed. Highly recommended!

2052019,4,B00020BVYW,"This is a very nice film about man who has a positive life changing experience via a potential disaster.  The performances are very good by most of the cast, and the scenery is terrific.  I personally enjoyed the fact that the film makers didn't feel the need to explain every little thing in the film, and therefore left a lot to my imagination.

Barry Pepper shows that he has what it takes to be a major actor, and he really carries the show.  His character is someone who isn't very likeable in the early part of the film, but who becomes a much more likeable person as he responds to events around him.  I found myself pulling for both his character and that of Annebella Piugattuk.

I don't want to give anything away, but I will warn you that those who like Hollywood endings, with all loose ends neatly wrapped up, will probably be disappointed.  This is a very well made film that tells a very good story while leaving some loose ends for you to ponder.",1122249600,,962,4.401129943502825
2052020,5,B00020BVYW,"deeply moved by thise movie. everything in this movie is wonderful and wonderfully done. the actor, the actress, the story, the cinematography, the directing, the screenplay.....simply wonderful!
sometime i have to salute to those who in the movie business still have the hearts of not doing hollywood stereotyped commercial motivated movies like this one. it only gives me hope that we could still find some deep instead shallow movies to watch just because there are production people who want to invest money in some great stories no matter what. i'm so tired of hollywood's boring graphics, stunts, explosions, endless disturning background music(sound track). you'll find nothing unacceptable in this movie, but the greatness of human beings, the greatness of a girl who got a heart as big as the universe.",1121990400,3,811,5.246153846153846
2052021,5,B00020BVYW,"The Snow Walker is a superb adaptation of Farley Mowat's story ""Walk Well My Brother"" which appears in the short story collection ""The Snow Walker"".  First-rate acting, majestic scenery, and a story simple but profound make this movie perhaps one of the best to come out in recent years.  It is an excellent example of quality that the Canadian film industry can produce, yet, sadly, rarely achieves.  Highly recommended.",1119398400,2,421,5.072463768115942
2052022,5,B00020BVYW,"Wonderful survival story about a self-centered white man and a young Inuit woman stranded in the Artic  after a plane crash. Charlie (Barry Pepper) is an enterprising pilot and WWII veteran flying the Artic circuit trying to ""make a buck"" with no moral conscience about how he does it. He agrees to fly an Inuit girl with tuberculosis (Annebella Piugattuk) to a hospital after being offered a pair of valuable walrus tusks as fare. At first Charlie displays a sense of superiority over his passenger, but when the plane crashes in a remote, isolated region Kanaalaq's (Anna) wilderness survival skills prove more valuable than his.

In the face of adversity cultural indifference transforms into a profound friendship and spiritual bond between the two that will last forever.

A little slow in spots, but it's such a beautifully visual and spiritually moving movie that it still gets a '5 Star' rating. Annebella Piugattuk is absolutely incredible and makes the movie a profound, emotional experience.",1117929600,5,1002,5.134969325153374
2052023,4,B00020BVYW,"The Arctic tundra plays a major role in this satisfying story based on the novel 'Walk Well My Brother' by Farley Mowat: it physically represents the untampered frontiers as well as the playing field for the confrontation of two cultures and as such it strikes more meaningful chords that expected.

Charlie Halliday (Barry Pepper) is a womanizing, self-centered, cavalier pilot in the northern reaches of Canada and is sent on a mission to deliver goods to an Inuit tribe by his boss Shepherd (James Cromwell).  When Charlie glides into the Inuit tribe he reluctantly agrees to transport an ailing Inuit girl Kanaalaq (Annabella Piugattuk) to a hospital. Once airborne the plane encounters a storm and, losing an engine, the plane crashes.  Charlie is enraged: Kanaalaq is stoic.  Charlie speaks no Inuit: Kanaalaq speaks only a little English,  The story is how the hotheaded, arrogant Charlie shakes his fist at the elements and makes futile attempts to contact the outside world, while the (?) tubercular Kanaalaq quietly goes about incorporating her instinctive tools of survival.  Slowly Charlie and Kanaalaq bond in a mutual dependency and Charlie softens his psyche in response to Kanaalaq's creative and ingenious manner of melding with nature in a oneness that is deeply touching.

Director Charles Martin Smith displays great reverence to the natural phenomena of the Arctic circle by incorporating vista shots and architecturally perfect picture framing of two souls pitted against the trials of survival.  Massive mosquito swarm attacks, the treeless wastelands, the magnificence of the aurora borealis, sunsets unhindered by man's contamination - all of these enhance this tale of the collision of two cultures and the realm of mutual honor that can result in times of challenge.  Both Pepper and Piugattuk give exceptional performances allowing the slow metamorphosis of character revelation to seem utterly natural.

There is much to admire in this small Canadian film, in concept, direction, production, acting and, most of all, in message.  Highly recommended for all audiences.  Grady Harp, June 05",1117756800,13,2117,5.343373493975903
2052024,5,B00020BVYW,"Snow Walker stars Barry Pepper as Charlie Halliday with Annabella Piugattuk as Kanaalaq. Charlie has to be bribed into taking a sick Inuit to the hospital. The sick Inuit is Kanaalaq. On the flight to Yellowknife, the engine of the plane comes apart and they crash land in the ""Barens"". Charlie is arrogant, totally stupid when it comes to survival, and is described as an ""ignorant racist"". He leaves Kanaalaq and walks off for help, leaving her behind. A week later, when he is almost dead from exposure, Kanaalaq rescues him. The young girl that couldn't, proceeds to teach him survival skills that ultimately save his live. It is a 5-* movie from my point of view. Ihope to see more of Annabella in the future.

Pepper has been in a lot of movies that I have watched. I have no doubt that I will see more of him in the future.",1117584000,4,830,4.4605263157894735

No need for soundstages or computer-generated images. The real-live tundra of rural Canada is enough. Added to the cinematic honesty and curiosity is the casting of actual Inuit natives. And no banal plot devices or self-pitying protagonists or empty antagonists.

Thanks to the said features and more, it is easy to get swept up into the journey that Charlie Halliday (Barry Pepper) and Kanaalaq (Annabella Piugattuk) must take across a freezing tundra. Plus, we see the beauty and the danger of untouched Earth, and respect it as the local Inuits do and have done. [I can understand why the film is set in the 1950s, as opposed to the 2000s when there's not as much enthusiasm or notice of the village ways and appreciation of nature and beyond.]

Once on that journey, we join Charlie in putting aside modern conveniences, and people, that we take for granted. The who-is and the what-is of 'live-fast-and-prosper' society simply stop mattering. We also see that disease cannot, or doesn't have to, hinder the spirit. Thus, Kanaalaq's willingness to go on and guide Charlie despite her sickness and declining condition. By the end, Charlie has come too far to turn back, whether or not his friends from the fast lane have found out about his survival. Of course, that is left ambiguous (his survival being realized)--which I'm glad of. Less clich. Plus, the narrative is not enlarged or shrunken by excess dialogue.

Kudos to Mr. Pepper, Ms. Piugattuk, writer-director Charles Martin Smith, author Farley Mowat, cinematographers Paul Sarossy and Jon Joffin, casting director Jared Valentine and various others. To think I first saw parts of this over eight, maybe ten, years ago. Now I get to see the whole hundred of it. No commercials or any other hindering elements.
