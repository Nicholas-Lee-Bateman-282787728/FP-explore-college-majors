7881322,5,6304983689,"Action is in and boring is out, well with this movie anyway that how it goes, Story is about a man who joins a special agency for mercenaries that most other groups won't touch.  The first dangerous mission goes of with a bang and every one is still alive and kicking so far that is. While there he rescues a business man so he is rewarded and given a promotion by the team leader  Yankee. Now he is getting gamer and than the second mission fails but by who and why.  Now he decides to call it quits, only thing is of  ... 1 rule.. once in, always in. He makes a break for it and disappears for a while until he is found, Silly boy I told him not to hide under the bed, now back to been realistic about the show of course. I rated this an A grade plus for the full on action with a few twist and turns plus some first class ideas holding my interest from beginning to end. The baddies always find their man don't they. But they don't know him to well and what happens in this movie you won't want to miss.  Now I have told you some of the clues its your turn to make a move gather up the movie but don't forget the popcorn as there will be no peace tonight in front of the television. Fantastic acting with a great story line to back it up marvellous entertainment from an old classic.  Enjoy!",1400284800,,1294,4.03515625
