1995139,4,B0001F33GW,"This isn't a deep or extremely dynamic movie, but it is good and I thought it was fairly well done. You can nitpick over little things, but overall it was worth watching and I enjoy being able to see it whenever I choose. The acting of the lead characters is excellent, including the young girl.
St. Nicholas, Iowa is a small town in need of a doctor or the hospital will have to be shut down. Beautiful Ann Jillian plays the mayor and town vet who is also trying to stitch up an occasional human patient. Robert Hayes plays the town's favorite son who went away and became a doctor. Everyone thought he would return, but instead he married and settled into a job in a large hospital in the city. His wife died a few years ago and now he and his daughter are going home for Christmas for the first time, while he tries to overcome the demons that are shaking his confidence in his own ability as a doctor. Jack Palance is amazing as his father who does what he can to encourage him to reunite with his old high school flame (Ann Jillian). Rather than explain to anyone that he is struggling, he makes up a story about getting a promotion and having to hurry back to work and he runs back to the city, but not to a promotion. Unable to overcome his insecurities in the operating room, he turns in his scalpel for a desk job in administration. Things come to a head when his dad, who came to the city with them for Christmas, needs emergency surgery and his daughter pleads with him to help grampa.
Will the eccentric townspeople of St. Nicholas have to close their hospital? Who will have the honor of being the ""grand electrician"" who lights the town's Christmas tree on Christmas Eve? And why is Janet, the pig, off her feed? Just a good, old-fashioned small-town Christmas the whole family can enjoy.",1256601600,4,1802,4.3982035928143715
1995140,5,B0001F33GW,This is a great Christmas movie and also a wonderful love story.  Ann Jillian is one of the best actresses in the business and shines in the story line.  We all would love a chance to go back and get our first love.,1254960000,2,215,3.9767441860465116
1995141,5,B0001F33GW,"This is one of the many really wonderfully ""feel goo"" Christmas movies. If you don't own it, you need to.",1218931200,3,105,4.3
1995142,5,B0001F33GW,"This is an enjoyable, warm and pleasant family film for anytime to view. The roles were done well. Ann jillian always gives a good performance & does in this role as a hometown veternarian who loves the community in which she lives. She is loved & respected by many. Along comes a widowed father of a young girl back to the neighborhood & his father's (Jack Palance)home as he has encountered some emotional obstacle to his professional ability in medicine. Ann Jillian helps them all to meet the problems ahead and thicken the plot so that the developing story brings high & low moments to a good resolution. How she does it is a good story. I had seen it on TV several times & can look at it again every so often.",1199232000,12,715,4.383458646616542

Jack Palance is wonderful as their father/grandfather. Ann Jillian as the mayor/former love interest of the surgeon gives a light to the film which is enchanting. A very pleasant holiday movie.",1199145600,6,455,4.7
1995144,5,B0001F33GW,"This movie took me by surprise. I thought, how can this be ok? Once I got into the movie, and began watching, I was hooked. We know how we want it to end, and finally it does!",1198368000,3,175,3.7567567567567566
1995145,4,B0001F33GW,"This movie should have had five stars.  There's a lot here to like.  It has a good supporting cast and some really moving moments throughout the film.  So, what's wrong?  Why is this movie out of print so soon when it could have been a Christmas perennial?

Primarily, the casting of the leading lady.  Yes, it does have a strong romance story, and in order for a love story to work, the audience has to fall in love with the man and the woman.  But they cast a woman who was not just ""overweight""; this woman was fat.  Sorry, I know it's politically incorrect to say that, but it's true nonetheless.  Unless you're a fan of hers, the love story just won't work for you.  Movie stars routinely lose weight for a film.  Why didn't she?

Second, the script is a bit disjointed (although it has some very strong moments and good scenes).  The conflict should have been about coming home versus staying in the big city, advancing in your career versus accepting chickens as payment for services rendered, etc.  Instead, we have an insecurity story, and even this story had problems: first, we can't relate to it because we're not told until the end what caused the insecurity.  We needed to be told early and not just told but shown the scene.  Second, the story is not developed.  It's just there.  Third, its resolution is not developed; instead, a crisis comes along and poof! the phobia is gone.

Note that the ""Product Description"" above is a total joke.  None of it is accurate!  Who writes these things?

On the positive side again, the performance by Jack Palance is amazing.  He plays a good guy this time, and plays it very well and convincingly.  Only trouble is that he is the only one in the whole set who has stage presence.  Whenever he is in a scene, the eye inexorably travels to him, even though he isn't moving, isn't doing anything to attract attention.

Bottom line: see this movie anyway.  There aren't many that can touch it.  If you like family movies and relationship movies told with heart and compassion, see also Mary Christmas, An Angel in the Family, The Christmas Shoes, Unlikely Angel, or read the novel A Thanksgiving Miracle.  These are the best of the best.  There are a lot of fake holiday movies and books out there.  These are the genuine article.",1125964800,19,2281,4.558024691358025
1995146,5,B0001F33GW,"I taped this movie on December 20, 2004 and my wife and I just watched it 2 days ago.  Wanting to get through the movies we taped around Christmas more than we had time to watch, we didn't set our expectation too high -- just wanted to clear it from our schedule.  However we were very pleasantly surprised.  Of course it had 3 of our favorite actors, i.e., Ann Jillian, Robert Hays, and Jack Palance so we figured it should not really be a bad movie.  It was a very good movie with good acting by the three and also Ashley Gorrel and many of the townspeople.  It was well paced but in a couple of places I had to rewind to get what was said.  It is a good movie for family viewing, and for those who enjoy movies picturing relationships.",1106179200,30,738,4.161971830985915

The whole cast is great and even the minor roles of townspeople are perfectly cast, and they all look like they're having a great time.  The struggles of Robert Hays' hometown boy-who-made-good trying to decide his future is a bit familiar, but well written and you can't blame him for wanting to go home again and try to make a life with his old flame (wonderful Ann Jillian).

1995236,5,B0001F33GW,"What is a good Christmas movie? It should be a good story, a good cast and make the viewer feel warm and misty- this hits each mark with gusto. In this age of dozens of dreck (rememember when there were but a decent few gems, instead of the Xmas movie of the day from Hallmark or ABC Family Channel) ""IBHFC"" should be on your calendar each year.
Featuring a venerable cast including a curmudgeonly, but surprisingly great Jack Palance, Ann Jillian, Robert Hayes and Ashley Gorrell the plot centers around the widowed Hays as a doctor whose lost his mojo and returns to his small hometown of St. Nicholas, Iowa with his daughter in tow to visit his aging dad Palance. The town is in desparate need of a doctor to replace the deceased physician or its hospital is in jeopardy of closing, foreshadowing the demise of the town, so the town led by the Mayor (and local veterinarian) Jillian, Dr. Mike's childhood sweetheart joins together to woo him and his daughter to return and stay forever home for the holidays.
Facing professional struggles and having lost his way, Dr. Mike finds support and love and a renewal of faith and his daughter- "" former child of the big city"" discovers a relationship with her grandfather and love for small town life and values.
Surprisingly warm and fuzzy, IBHFC generates a warm holiday glow and enough drama and warmth to make the viewer teary eyed yet not morose. great that it is now available at a resonable priced general release on DVD.
This one has become a staple on our holiday viewing list and it should be on yours. Fun to see Palance - known for his evil incarnate movie persona in such a warm role.",1326585600,,1643,4.554054054054054

The surgeon (Robert Hays) is becoming increasingly depressed over recent feelings of inadequacy, and can't shake his grief over his wife's death.  BUT there are two elements in his old hometown that have the potential to make his life happy and successful again:  the local hospital needs a doctor in order to stay open, and the high school sweetheart he dumped twenty years ago is now both the mayor and the town veterinarian.  And, you guessed it, still single.  Many totally predictable things occur, but Robert Hays and Ann Jillian make such an engaging couple and Jack Palance is so delightful as the grizzled but kind dad that it's easy to just go with the flow and enjoy the film.

8011593,5,B0001F33GW,"2016's I'll Be Home for Christmas is to original plot what Clark Griswold is to parkour. That is, one's got nothing to do with the other. The big saving grace is that I'll Be Home for Christmas makes for a fun watch. It's a yuletide movie that the entire fam can eyeball together without stress. It's weird to see Mena Suvari as a full-on grown-up, maybe because I don't think I've seen her in anything since American Beauty and the American Pie films. She plays Jackie Foster, assistant district attorney in River Falls and mother to the adorable Gracie. Jackie has got her life together, never mind that she's been three years estranged from her father. I guess it helps that she's super-organized. She has a schedule for everything.

Her father, the ex-cop Jack (James Brolin), seems the polar opposite. He's grungy-looking. He lives in a rusty eyesore of a motorhome. Three years ago, when his wife and Jackie's mom passed away, a grief-stricken Jack took off on Jackie, never mind that Jackie, too, was grieving. They ain't spoken since. What brings him back to River Falls? He drove in from Juarez. Jack was embarking on that retirement trip to Mexico that he and his wife had planned years ago. But a cop colleague had just passed, and Jack's come to River Falls to pay his respect. He didn't mean to run into his daughter.

Jack runs into his daughter. He gets reacquainted with his grand-daughter Gracie who promptly dubs him ""Grandpa Grinch."" From that moment on, he should've just torn up his map to Mexico. The movie tracks these three people as they work their way toward each other and try to be a family again. For Jack and Jackie, it's a titanic endeavor. Jack is mighty prideful and set in his ways. Jackie understandably harbors trust issues, abandonment issues. Thank goodness for Gracie who serves as the bridge. Note that the little girl who plays her, Giselle Eisenberg, is cute as a button and has enough bounce to power a pogo stick. I love her scenes with the crusty Brolin.

Anyway, the Fosters reconnecting is pretty much the crux of the narrative. Sure, we get side dishes in the shape of Jack's adopting a K9 dog named Nose and then sticking his nose and Nose into a pickpocketing case, and a firehouse converted into a homeless shelter that's now on its last legs, and the quandary of police detective Mike Kelly (John Reardon) who steps in to cast a shadow on Jackie's perfect romance with her boyfriend, Rand Edwards (Jacob Blair), snobby investment banker from an influential family.

I don't know if James Brolin directs a lot. But he does a solid job of it here. He balances gentle humor with character moments that aren't heavy-handed. He draws fine perfomances from his cast, especially from Suvari and young Eisenberg. He even gets the wifey to sing a couple of holiday songs: ""I'll Be Home for Christmas"" and ""Jingle Bells."" Now, getting one's wife to sing in one's movie may not seem like a big deal, but consider that Brolin is married to Barbra Streisand.

This movie just made me feel good. It's one marvelous thing about Hallmark. You're guaranteed a happy ending. No jitters when you sit down to a Hallmark movie. I never had to wonder if father and daughter were going to reconcile or whether grandpa and granddaughter will bond. The one thing that did concern me was whether the movie would sabotage itself by introducing a dumb contrivance to serve as a last-minute obstacle. Well, it started to but then quickly resolved the thing, so that was cool. Anyway, watch this movie for the interplay among the three main principals (the third party being the little girl, not the young cop). Watch it, too, for that one scene in which the Fosters attend a posh Christmas gala hosted by Jackie's boyfriend's parents. I broke out in giggles when Jack's rusty motorhome pulled up in front of such an elegant venue. There's Jack tossing his keys to the valet, telling him, ""Try not to scratch it."" That's beautiful.",1508630400,,3953,4.706647398843931
