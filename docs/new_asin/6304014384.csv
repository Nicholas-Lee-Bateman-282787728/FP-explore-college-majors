765336,3,6304014384,"Enemy of the Law, 1945 film

This film is dedicated to the law officers of the Old West in the pioneer days of 1880. [Actually, the Old West was basically settled by then.] The film begins with a lone rider pursued by three other men. Tex Haines goes along with them. The Ranger Captain has a new job: to find where Charles Gray hid that stolen gold. Panhandle Perkins will go undercover to try to learn where the gold is hidden. Can the map be hidden so it can't be found? Charles is released, and meets his gang. ""You're smarter than you look."" Will there be a conflict over splitting the loot? Ruby hires a new handyman. Tex Haines drops by and sings a song. Steve Martin argues with the tramp, then fires him. The Rangers plan to capture Charles after he digs up the loot. Charles wants a scar removed, and pays off the doctor who performed this operation!

The Rangers try to arrest Charles, but a hot kills the lights in the tavern. Then there is a fistfight to provide action. The sheriff shows up. ""Stay in town."" Panhandle and Charles hide in that lone cabin. Can Panhandle wash his feet? The Rangers catch Charles, but Steve and his boys show up to turn the tables. Where is the sock with the map? [Subtle humor here.] Charles and Steve find the man who found the sock, and get the map to the buried gold. Will Steve double-cross him? He doesn't worry about those Rangers. But they show up for a gunfight and then a fistfight. Will Charles escape with Panhandle? There is more comedy, and another song to end this film. Ruby will gain control of her property when her guardian is removed. The Rangers ride off.

This story echoes the movie ""Whistling Bullets"" which featured Kermit Maynard. Here he plays ""Mike"", one of the villains, in this more comical version. The original was better.",1284336000,,1798,4.492354740061162

I gave this one 4 stars for Tex Ritter & his singing. I was fortunate to see Tex in person, & much earlier I saw Gene Autry & Champion. They both brought a lot of excitement into my young life, & to this day I thank them for that!
