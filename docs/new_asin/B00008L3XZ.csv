8311879,5,B00008L3XZ,"Jess Franco has been known to make more than a few stinkers in his day and his recent pairing with One Shot Productions has allowed him to more freely explore his own inner monsters.  Given a budget and unbridled freedom, you never know what to expect from the Old Maestro.  But in INCUBUS Franco has harkened back to his spectacular 1970s heydays with a very close retelling of his LORNA THE EXORCIST film.  Carina Palmer is pretty and compelling taking over the old Lina Romay role.  Lina Romay herself takes on the role played by the iconic Janine Reynaud in the original -- how time flies!  Sure the film has a lot of nudity and some very uncomfortable and creepy scenarios, but Franco has not been better recently and for the over-18 crowd this should be very satisfying.  In a nutshell, this is the story of a man consumed by greed who makes a pact with a demoness and thinks he has gotten away with it.  But 18 years later, his daughter becomes the devil's playground.",1068336000,15,975,4.505681818181818
