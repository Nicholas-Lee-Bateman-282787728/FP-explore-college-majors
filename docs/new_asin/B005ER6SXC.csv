8619219,1,B005ER6SXC,"The idea is a good one (showing nativity sets in a yule log style presentation). I was expecting a variety of nativity sets, l've seen some amazing sets elsewhere but none of that is here. The dvd only has 5 nativity sets and they are all small simplistic sets (a couple are weird) and they only run 11 minutes before they start repeating. I am just very happy that I watched it on Amazon Prime and didn't buy the dvd. I would have been upset with spending money on this.

I would love to see this done the right way, with a bunch of different nativity sets. Including a life size one, large fancy sets, and other different sets (like an Eskimo one, etc)

I would recommend skipping this one, it isn't even worth the time. Which is sad because done right it could have been amazing.",1449273600,,782,4.312925170068027
