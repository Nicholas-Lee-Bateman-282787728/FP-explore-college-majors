Would've been perfect if English translations were offered for the bonus materials, and a bit disappointed to not have English subtitles even though there is a dubbed English version (which is ever-so-slightly different than what I'd seen broadcast in NYC long ago).",1508284800,,346,5.0701754385964914
8588923,4,B00D3DR162,"Very good depiction of the time when Germany was at a rise again.  Boys who wanted to be part of the ""boy scouts"" and those parents who were dead set against it.  There are both the english and german versions on the discs.  Yes, they filmed them at the same time, sometimes where a scene was charged for filming reasons (example; a fight in the hallways of the school was on the english version but in the german version the fight was in the school yard.), but still the same plot.  There are several documentaries on the discs as well.  Sadly they are only in german with no subtitles.  This is the only reason it looses one star for my review.  Otherwise, if you want to know the culture of the era, this will give you an idea.  Great historical depiction of the times.",1471910400,2,772,4.3125
8588924,5,B00D3DR162,"Excellent box set of a wonderful movie/tv mini series. I have waited mny years for someone to release this title. Top quality all around, there are 2 different versions of the film included; the German language version, and the English language version, which seems to be a much longer version. Also included is a nice booklet filled with color stills from the film. The text is only in German, but it's not so important. Highly recommended film for all WWII enthusiasts. You will be shocked at just how good this is, and at how it is not more well-known.",1452124800,4,555,4.616161616161616
8588925,5,B00D3DR162,"If this is the 1982 TV Movie and I am sure it is, it was one of the best movies I have ever seen on Nazi Germany and what it was like to be young and in Hitler's Youth group.  It shows not only how ordinary Germans came under the darkness of Hitler but how  these neighborhoods and how neighbors then turn against each other but how they actually lived and Nazism effects on their lives.  It is easy to make people appear like monsters when the reality is that this movie shows you how easily, slowly and scarily normal evil can look like.  I say if you see any movie on Nazism see this one. Even over 30 years later I still remember this film which I saw as a 12 year old.",1434672000,6,673,4.0
