5616424,3,B00BGGITX2,SAY ONE FOR ME was made in cinemascope but i but i think this dvd is full screen since all other that were released that were cinemascope films were full screen. So i would not buy this film which i like very much but i already have a copy from tv. And charging a price of 19.99 is shear robbery. They start the movie in widescreen but after the credits it goes full screen it is a disgrace and they should sell them for 5.00.,1361404800,22,426,4.023529411764706

5616427,5,B00BGGITX2,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!! I saw it as a kid and never forgot it so now I'm thrilled to own it on DVD! I personally find the cast is fantastic-and a great score especially "" you can't love them all"" which is the jazz standard now! I was always aware of this musical because we have the sheet music to ""the secret of Christmas"" when I was growing up!! Released in 1959 the movie has the old-school sentimentality that is lost in movies today! This movie is at the top of my list every Christmas with its Xmas theme toward the end.",1450915200,,525,4.1568627450980395
5616428,5,B00BGGITX2,"What can I say? I'm a big fan of Debbie Reynolds.  Loved her. In this movie. I saw it years ago, but couldn't find it. Great movie for the family to watch. No cursing or nudity, just clean fun. When I met Debbie in person i felt I knew her for years.",1439164800,,250,3.8076923076923075

5616436,3,B00BGGITX2,"This isn't the best musical you'll ever watch. But it is sweet. Bing Crosby and Debbie Reynolds are both great entertainer. Their musical talents are not challenged but enjoyable,. Robert Wagner was not ever considered a song and dance man, but a leading man and he does an adequate job.
I song and the sweet story is why I watch it every during the holiday season.",1421280000,,365,4.545454545454546
5616437,5,B00BGGITX2,I have always loved this movie. The quality on this dvd was great.,1418860800,,66,4.153846153846154

5616439,5,B00BGGITX2,Great movie. Robert Wagner was so young. It is a cute romance.,1414540800,,62,4.25
5616440,4,B00BGGITX2,"I'm not rating the product but the movie itself. I really enjoyed it. First time I've ever seen this one. It's not on par with Holiday Inn, The Country Girl, or Going My Way. But it's a worthy film. Very enjoyable. Except that Robert Wagner isn't the best dance lol.",1405209600,,266,4.34
5616441,5,B00BGGITX2,"This is a wonderful movie. I love it. I am a classic movie"" FAN"" ONLY.
they do not make movies like this today.",1401408000,,111,3.869565217391304
5616442,3,B00BGGITX2,"The movie itself is a true gem, almost like a widescreen color sequel to Going My Way and Bells of St. Mary's.  Uplifting and very Catholic but not too preachy or sectarian, the movie stars the acting and musical talents of Bing Crosby and Debbie Reynolds and secondarily Robert Wagner and Ray Walston.  It was made by Bing's own production company.

Unfortunately, the DVD has the quality of a VHS, across the board:
- Presented aspect ratio is 4:3 instead of the movie's native widescreen format
- Video quality is at the level of VHS
- No extras, no scene selection, no menu at all.

If I were a naive optimist, I would hope that Fox would eventually remaster this movie properly onto a Blu-Ray and offer it for $5 to those customers who purchased this low-quality DVD.",1391731200,6,772,4.572463768115942
5616443,5,B00BGGITX2,"I had been looking for this movie for many, many years.  It was one of my favorites from my early teens.  It showed at the local theater for four days and I went and watched it four times.  I hadn't seen it since although I would periodically search for it.  Thanks for bringing back great memories  - I found myself singing the tunes from the show for a few days - just as I did so long ago. You helped make this Christmas extra special.",1390089600,2,438,4.105882352941176
5616444,5,B00BGGITX2,Great classic movie!!  Debbie Reynolds & Bing Crosby are sensational in this movie!!  Don't miss this one!  I am so glad this movie was finally made available.,1388534400,,159,4.814814814814815
5616445,5,B00BGGITX2,Just a really cute show.  Great music of that time- fun to watch.  Not remembered for great acting or great story line- just a chick flick for all ages.,1377561600,,152,4.206896551724138
5616446,5,B00BGGITX2,I have enjoyed watching this DVD.  I originally saw it in the theater when I was a kid and had been trying to find it for years.  I really enjoyed Debby Reynolds and Bing Crosby's performances.  Robert Wagner was also very good.,1376784000,,228,4.380952380952381
5616447,5,B00BGGITX2,Been looking for this to come to DVD for a lot of years and just about gave up hope!!! And hear it is!!!,1376265600,,104,3.5652173913043477
5616448,4,B00BGGITX2,"While this isn't my favorite of Bing's movies, you just can't go wrong with Der Bingle. I highly recommend this to fans of the incredible Mr. Crosby.",1375660800,,149,4.555555555555555
5616449,4,B00BGGITX2,I enjoyed the singing and music.  Who knew RJ Wagner could sing?  Debbie Reynolds was really sweet.  It was worth seeing.,1375228800,,121,4.666666666666667
5616450,1,B00BGGITX2,"I have not purchased this horrible product nor do I intend to purchase any like it.

1. Widesceen released as 4:3 pan scan URGH.... I can understand releases from 2010 and earlier but this was released in 2013 when almost every house has widescreen TVs. Even in backward Australia we have just phased out analogue transmissions so most consumers have purchased digital TVs. I sometimes think the release companies are trying to commit company suicide.

2. No subtitles. Surprising how many people are deaf or hard of hearing. Surprising how many potential sales (including mine) go down the gurgler.

3. Price. OUCH!!! Say no more.

If going down the DVD-R road then make it at least a well done release and don't charge like a wounded bull.",1370390400,12,741,4.811023622047244
5616451,1,B00BGGITX2,FOX HOME VIDEO has got to be kidding releasing WIDESCREEN films in the pan and scan (fullscreen) version...most TVs now are widescreen and every home video distributor releases films in their original WIDESCREEN format...even the on demand films released by Warner Home Video...If I wanted the fullscreen version I would have taped it off of Fox Movie Channel...VERY BAD NEWS for the consumers who buy these films...stay away from FOX CINEMA ARCHIVES COLLECTION!!,1367625600,22,463,5.3561643835616435
5616452,2,B00BGGITX2,Fox should be drawn and quartered for releasing these lovely old Cinemascope movies so badly....by just putting together an old pan and scan TV print......what side of their addled brain does an idea like this come from? No TV network anywhere would show this poorly presented print. Shame,1367452800,25,289,5.041666666666667
5616453,5,B00BGGITX2,"Robert Wagner is a pious, self appreciating owner of a nightclub. Debbie Reynolds is hired as a singer but she is more sheltered and isn't used to his worldly ways. Enter Bing Crosby as the priest who is trying to protect her from falling from grace. A mistaken shipment of the wrong suit puts Wagner in his place and he wakes up to his errant ways and repents. Now he and Ms. Reynolds can pursue the romance that has been blooming between them.
Ray Walston is a side character with an alcohol problem but at one time was a fine composer and lyricist. With the help and encouragement of the priest, he too finds redemption and writes a beautiful new song about the meaning of Christmas.
This movie will have you laughing, crying and just filled with the joy of the season from beginning to end.",1364947200,6,794,4.445205479452055
5616454,1,B00BGGITX2,"Thanks to the previous reviewer for saving me the disappointment and money of ordering this. It's the same pan and scan print Fox shows on TV, and so it's reputation continues to troll in the mud. In point of fact, though, Tashlin did a lot of creative stuff with the scope frame, especially with the choreography and in the bar scene, and Crosby and Walston are terrific in it. Don't buy this version though. It's total butchery. Shame on Fox for charging top dollar or any dollar for the kind of print you might have seen on TV at 3 am 30 years ago.",1362787200,30,551,4.3076923076923075
8568099,3,B00BGGITX2,"While I am fully aware that this movie may not appeal to the majority of viewers,I retain a very soft spot for it,mainly for Debbie Reynolds
who is charming throughout,sings and dances joyously and manages to rise above a rather banal script. Robert Wagner is not too bad in
the song and dance department but his character is really chauvinistic and he cant do much with the part. I always enjoy Bing Crosby and
he delivers sublime renditions of some nice songs. Watch this movie for Debbie and Bing ; you will find much to enjoy.",1526947200,,530,4.53125

8568106,5,B00BGGITX2,"This has been called one of the ten worst movies ever made, but it is one of my favorite Christmas movies.  The music is varied between cute and quirky, and poignant.  It is a fun movie.",1490832000,,186,4.138888888888889

8568108,5,B00BGGITX2,(Wife replying) I have been looking for this movie for a few years on DVD format. I finally gave up. I was looking for Debbie Reynolds movies and found this one and had to order it right away. It has been years since I saw the movie on tv. I am looking forward to seeing it soon.,1486339200,,279,3.912280701754386
