New Orleans cop Danny Fisher (John Cena) along with his partner Hank Carver (Brian J. White) are out on patrol when they cross paths with arms dealer Miles Jackson (Adian Gillen) & his girlfriend Erica Kessen (Taylor Cole) who were on the run from a an F.B.I. sting gone bad earlier in the night before he was eventually captured but unfortunately resulted in Erica's death in the process. Fast forward a year later when Miles escapes from prison & seeks revenge on Danny kidnapping his girlfriend Molly Porter (Ashley Scott) & forcing him to participate in a game called ""12 Rounds"" where he must perform series of task within a certain time limit or lose Molly & possibly his own life but has another problem with F.B.I. agents George Aiken (Steve Harris) & Ray Santiago (Gonzalo Menendez) getting involved with Aiken having a personal vendetta against Jackson & wants to get him no matter who or what is sacrificed in the process including Fisher's girlfriend.

This movie has a simple plotline where it's the good guy chasing after the bad guy who kidnapped his girlfriend but will also remind you of ""Die Hard With A Vengance/Die Hard 3"" in that the villain is seeking revenge for a personal death caused resulting in him forcing the hero to perform a series of difficult physical task. 12 Rounds didn't come off as a dated B-level generic movie as it made a good mix of action along with different levels of plot & character development.

12 Rounds 2: Reloaded
Randy Orton plays Nick Malloy, an EMT, who after going to a movie with his wife Sarah (Cindy Busby) is a witness to a car accident that resulted in a fatality only for it to come back to haunt him one year later when he received a phone call from a mysterious man named Patrick Heller (Brian Markinson) threatening his wife's safety unless he plays his game of ""12 Rounds."" He has to deal with so many challenges both physically & mentally While playing the rounds such as figuring out what to do with the limited clues he was given, dealing with a kid he was forced to kidnap named Tommy Weaver (Tom Stevens), Det. McKenzie (Venus Terzo) & the police coming after him, and trying to put all the pieces together of what the connection is with everyone involved in the rounds including a missing Governor with Heller telling him that it's all about ""balancing the scales of justice.""

This was one of those sequels that has no connection to the previous movie past it being the same concept which in this case was having to complete a dangerous task in a limited amount of time or else face severe consequences. This version of ""12 Rounds"" was heavily different than the first one as this was set to be more adult & darker with all the events taking place throughout the night, more foul language, some moments of dark humor based off the stupidity of Tommy, and an scene of simulated sex & nudity & drugs.

In the end, the first movie came off more like an adrenaline rush with each round being a more dangerous stunt than the previous one but this one fell flat to me so I would only recommend this for a rental or stream but nothing more past that.",1461283200,,3128,4.550621669626998
