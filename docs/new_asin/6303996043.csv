7858956,5,6303996043,I have used this video for several years in my Critical Thinking course. It has great interviews with world-renowned experts such as Carl Sagan and Elizabeth Loftis. It shows how sincere people can believe in events that never happened due to various psychological anomalies such as hypnogogic and hypnopompic dream states. It's unfortunate that NOVA has not chosen to release it in DVD format. Hopefully someone uploads this sometime soon so it can continue to inform students for years to come.,1444089600,,496,5.135802469135802

7858958,1,6303996043,"This is a very subjective work on the subject. Can't be better in a skeptical way. If you are skeptical and subjective then you are destructive. If so you better shut your mouth. People need to learn and to know by themselves, they don't need somebody to know for them. This is not information but disinformation of course.
There was a good one, made before this one and called: ""Kidnapped by UFOs"", without the ""?"".
Strangely it seems impossible to find it anymore... If it is still possible, it is much harder anyway. And that's not understandable for a much better made documentary.",1007251200,2,585,4.689320388349515
