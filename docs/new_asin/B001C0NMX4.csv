3503417,2,B001C0NMX4,I bought this movie because it featured George Lopez.  George Lopez only came out a few times almost didn't speak.  This movie was not funny at all.  I bought it for about two dollars and I would have been upset if I had paid more than that.,1257638400,2,241,4.085106382978723
3503418,5,B001C0NMX4,"What a fabulous movie!  I am so glad a bought this DVD. We enjoyed a cozy night in with a bottle of wine as we watched. Very entertaining. Wonderful locations and scenery, great actors, whimsical, colorful - I wish I could have walked right into the movie and sat down at the table! We just LOVED this movie - top notch directing, story line, great themes and messages.  EXCELLENT - I highly recommend this DVD.",1256342400,2,411,4.466666666666667
3503419,5,B001C0NMX4,"This is a great movie! The colors are cool, a little dreamy, and the plot is pretty funny so kids will enjoy it, but there is also subtext which Adults will appreciate. Though it says it stars George Lopez, his part is more of a supporting character, but he's his usual self. The soundtrack was really good. Waiting to see if they'll release the soundtrack. What I like best is that it's a film you can watch with your whole family.",1229644800,,432,4.345679012345679
3503420,5,B001C0NMX4,"When I first saw Tortilla Heaven in a theater in East LA, it was clear that it was a family favorite. The Latinos in the audience, seemed to enjoy the villagers in this fable set in the imaginary town of Falfurrias, New Mexico. There is a timelessness of the story that should make it have a long shelf life at your local video stores. The cast is chock full of Latino, mainly Chicano cast. Most notably, George Lopez (George Lopez Show) as a goof ball sheriff, Miguel Sandoval (Medium) as the devil incarnate, Ana Ortiz (Ugly Betty) as his co-hort, Irene Bedard (Smoke Signals) as a hapless civil service worker, Elaine Miles (Northern Exposure) as a farmer's defiant wife, Lupe Ontiveros (Desperate Housewives) as a henpecking mother-in law, Elpidia Carrillo (Predator) as a strong wife, Alexis Cruz (Shark) as an idealistic young man, Del Zamora (Repo Man) as a henpecked son, Jose Zuniga (Crooklyn) is the maker of the tortilla that is the centerpiece of this comedy. For you see, the tortilla has the burned image of Jesus on it. There is even the legendary Olivia Hussey (Zefferelli's Romeo & Juliet) in a supporting role as a free thinking nudist. The cinematography is outstanding. Music is fine in a funny sort of way. This is funny little sweet movie with heart. I took my nieces and my mother and we all laughed and enjoyed ourselves. My father even chuckled several times and liked the ending very much. I am happy to see this family film, finally come out on DVD. I am on the fan website for Tortilla Heaven, so they have alerted me, that it comes out on DVD soon. We have been waiting to buy this movie and show it to our friends. For a family film, it can't be beat!",1229040000,2,1681,4.551155115511551
3503421,5,B001C0NMX4,"We absolutely loved this film, warmed our hearts, renewed our spirit and left everyone watching with HOPE!  Loved, loved, loved it, would recommend it to any families, all ages young and old, has a strong message of greed, faith and belief.

Please rent, buy, do what ever you can to see this film, it's great!!!",1227830400,,312,4.654545454545454
3503422,2,B001C0NMX4,"The basic premise of this movie is good, the cast is GREAT, the scenery is wonderful but the writing is awful.  Too much was going on, there were so many sub-plots that it became tiresome.  I wanted to love this movie because I love northern New Mexico and I tried, I really tried, but this movie is a waste of time.  I only gave it two stars because the scenery  was good.",1225411200,,373,4.138888888888889
3503423,1,B001C0NMX4,This movie was NOT funny .. and the acting was horrible. I like George Lopez but it was really bad,1224806400,,98,3.95
3503424,5,B001C0NMX4,"This movie is a must see! The love and passion that went into the making of this movie is wonderfully apparent. A number of the relatively unknown actors and actresses (at the time they appeared in this film) have gone onto greater success. George Lopez and Ana Ortiz (older sister in Ugly Betty) are just two examples.

Director/writer Judy Hecht Dumontet shows a rare talent to successfully bring off this independent family movie that will have you laughing, crying and feeling inspired. Get this movie and watch it with your family and friends.",1224201600,3,548,4.89247311827957
3503425,5,B001C0NMX4,"This a very entertaining film, this the mexican ""Napoleon Dinamite"" of latino films.  If feels like an indie film, and it is simple as it is charming.  The acting is superb and the cast is excellent with George Lopez at the helm.  The story is simplistic yet so intricate, so human, so revolutionary.  The message is clear and powerful.  This film has it all, comedy, great comedians, and cool music.  The only things to note: their is a fair amount of nudity and cursing in this film.  So, there you have it, a latino comedy that delivers a miracle.",1224028800,4,550,4.494949494949495
3503426,5,B001C0NMX4,"I saw this film at the Denver International Latino Film Festival where it won an award.  I loved it.  It is a fantastic, family friendly, funny funny funny film.  The cast is great and the writer/director has an original voice. The soundtrack is wonderful. It is well worth your time.",1223769600,4,284,4.64

3503429,4,B001C0NMX4,I went to the preview of this at the National Hispanic Center when the movie first came out and have always wanted to see it again.  I enjoyed it this time also and will show it to my friends.,1404777600,,192,3.923076923076923

3503431,4,B001C0NMX4,"This is a reasonably clean and funny movie, kinda wacky in it's premise, yet good enough to keep your attention until the end. You won't mind sharing it with the kids.",1384646400,,167,4.419354838709677
3503432,1,B001C0NMX4,"First, this is not a family-friendly or even remotely funny film.  It has sexual overtones and heresy at its heart. Second, this so-called Latino comedy does nothing but poke fun at Catholic traditions and paints Latinos as stupid, greedy and foolish people. The makers of this film obviously know nothing about faith.  They must have studied Martin Scorcese's film, The Last Temptation of Christ, Penny Marshall's film, Michael and taken them as true representations of the tenets of the Catholic faith. Jesus does not tempt us or use angels to do that.  The Devil does that.  Finally, there is no good message in this other than faith is for fools and has no redeeming aspects.  I would encourage people who have faith to avoid this garbage which only appeals to the shallow-minded and those who nothing about the importance of faith to the Latino people.",1384214400,2,857,4.882758620689655
3503433,4,B001C0NMX4,As advertised and very funny movie. A look into the happy simple lives of indigent people being invaded by corporate greed.,1364860800,,123,4.904761904761905

3503435,5,B001C0NMX4,I had seen this movie a few years back and it stuck in my mind. I wanted a copy to share with friends and family. When you watch this movie for the first time you think it is just another stupid comedy without a meaning behind it. Well that is wrong this movie is funny but has a great lesson to be learn at the end. I really enjoyed it the first time and the second time was just as good seeing my friend's reaction.,1301961600,,417,3.9176470588235293

8285509,5,B001C0NMX4,"The film is even more relevant and funny now since its first release in 2007. A religious ""miracle"" -- Jesus on a tortilla - turns a town upside down. Proud to have co-written the script with Judy the director. Check it out!",1467244800,,224,4.357142857142857
