4196228,5,B003UD7JC6,"This is one of the best new programs on the air this season ! The selection of parts for actors fits each character, and they blend personalities with the story line lending a dramatic portrayal of respect, duty, and honor to the reputation of any police department portrayed on television today.",1293062400,66,296,4.823529411764706
4196229,5,B003UD7JC6,"Picture is clear on this DVD release.  Several extras are included in a good looking sturdy box that will nicely protect the DVD's.  Episode guide included on the sleeve.  Box design is fairly slim and won't take up too much space on your shelf.

This is one of the best new shows out there.  The whole cast is fantastic, especially Frank (Selleck) and Danny Reagan (Donnie Wahlberg).  The episodes have been well written, the plots are excellent, great shots of New York City.

This show offers a nice mix of a police drama and a family drama.  Each week the show just seems to keep getting better.

Looking forward to the Season 1 release!",1291507200,117,641,4.552631578947368

But if you are looking for a good show, this one is it.",1496966400,,400,4.207792207792208

4196328,1,B003UD7JC6,I made the mistake of ordering three seasons of this at one time. Really bad mistake on my part. This is stupid violent brainless conflict within a family for the sake of conflict. There is no greater good. There is really nothing positive to feel good about. Avoid ...,1494374400,,269,4.510204081632653
4196329,1,B003UD7JC6,"The show is unwatchable. But let me tell you why...

If you're a Republican, this show panders to you. Go forth and love every moment. Not a Right Winger? This show will offend your every sensibility.

There is a lot of praying at the dinner table (when they aren't arguing or talking about heinous crimes in front of the kids). If you're religious, you'll love it. If you're not, you'll just find it annoying and cloying.

Donnie Wahlberg's character gives cops a bad name. He's beating suspects, threatening them, using excessive force, etc, with zero consequences. It's disturbing to watch.

""Erin"" is a flat, boring character, which is a shame because they could have made her a very strong female lead. This would have been great, as there are zero other strong female characters.

The grandpa is a boring old coot, Danny's passive wife is apparently fine with her husband's antics, and Tom Selleck is a self-righteous, thinly veiled bigot.

The cast is all white, with no diversity at all. Boring to watch and not true to life (unless you live in rural Alabama).

The only character I like is the rookie cop brother (although he went through 8 years of Harvard schooling and then decided to be a beat cop? Yeah, probably not).

My breaking point was Tom Selleck's character saying a woman's sexual assault claim couldn't be true because the accused was someone who'd baptized his kids and was a ""good"" person. Oh, really? Nice police work and great rape culture talk. Blech.

With so many stellar shows to choose from, BB gets a hard pass.",1494028800,,1545,4.735074626865671

It examines the lives of four generations of the Reagan law enforcement dynasty, a family which has a rich tradition of both police service, as well as military service. Most episodes are structured around a specific police case, which is typically associated with some type of an ethical or moral dilemma, along with other complicating factors. ""Blue Bloods"" focuses more on the fundamental relationships between its characters, rather than on action and mayhem. The weekly Sunday dinner, featuring the four generations of the Reagan family sharing a meal, as well as pertinent stories, vigorous debates, and fatherly and grandfatherly advice, is decidedly heartwarming, and gives the show a gratifying interpersonal touch. The actors of ""Blue Bloods,"" led by Tom Selleck, Donnie Wahlberg, and Bridget Moynahan, consistently deliver excellent performances, and are truly the heart of the show. I give the outstanding police and family drama, ""Blue Bloods,"" an enthusiastic five-star rating, along with my highest recommendation.",1485561600,10,1178,5.58659217877095

4196563,5,B003UD7JC6,Blue Bloods is one of the best shows on TV: It is well written; The actors (regulars and guests) are perfectly cast; And the storylines are well thought out.

4196568,4,B003UD7JC6,"Ok, so like many of the low reviews, I thought this show was blah in the beginning. With docudramas like First 48, it's hard to watch a copy-cat version of a detective show. After three episodes of Season 1, I thought the acting could improve, the plots were a little weak and Donnie Wahlberg's acting was over-the-top. I don't know what happened after the third episode, but the show grows on you and the plots get better. So for all of the people who gave up after a couple of episodes, pick it back up and give it a try. The series starts off slow but gets better.",1485216000,,567,4.2592592592592595

4196617,4,B003UD7JC6,"It was interesting to slip back to the beginning of this series and watch the eventual paths of the various characters evolve into those we still see today.  The patriarch appears a little more vulnerable and sheltering of his off spring; Danny is less disciplined and flirts dangerously close to violating police protocol; he and Erin clash more often and she still suffering the loss of her marriage; while Jaimie struggles to become, but is diverted by the questions he discovers around Joe's death.

Sometimes I just pause the screen to take in the sites on the over head views.  I like the cast.

4196962,5,B003UD7JC6,"It is the best show on the air in my opinion.  The scenes involving actual police work are handled with moral issues carefully developed.  It is an example to everyone on how law enforcement should be used.  The family dinner every Sunday is something that was regularly done in the South.  It shows the Reagans together, enjoying, debating, and supporting one another.  This is the essence of what a family should do and be.  Always supporting one another and caring for one another, no matter the situation.  Most families these days are so scattered because of their careers, that they hardly know one another, children grow up without getting to know their grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins. The youth of our nation feel that they have no one to go to for help.  They turn to gangs for support, instead of family.  Many of them may not have families or anyone they feel they can trust or depend on for support and love.  Blue Bloods sets an example for every family and gives us all something for which we should strive.",1478390400,4,1030,4.640883977900552

The family Sunday dinners become a forum for legitimate discussions that should be center stage in the mind and heart, conscience and consciousness of everyone serving and sacrificing in law enforcement or those questioning the many problems within that community -- often the same people.
Now in its seventh season, critics and consumers alike apparently find it worth a weekly hour of exploration and the writers and great ensemble cast keep coming up with reasons to keep coming back. Bravissimo! (or whatever the Irish equivalent.)",1477958400,5,901,5.338028169014085

Selleck, Moynahan and Wahlberg are fabulous leads. I've also enjoyed the supporting cast as well. Selleck is a little dour in his role as Police Commissioner and I'm not sure if this is because of the over hanging sadness of losing his other son, Joe, on the job two years earlier. They're a family of cops with Moynahan high up in the DA department. This creates conflict at times and it's always interesting how they manage it.

This is a tight family who has dinner together every Sunday night and says grace which I find particularly touching.

We've started on Season 2 and I suspect we'll go the distance through the entire series.",1476748800,,902,4.555555555555555

The writers of the show today a fantastic job with all the scripts very realistic to true life. Directing excellent,  casting perfect acting perfection this is one of the best cast I've seen put together for  Law enforcement TV series. Of course it follows the best of the Law & Order  franchise. NYPD blue.  That's not forget those great Shows. It Doesn't get better than this. Being a former a former Boss in Law enforcement  I can tell you the technical  advisers deserve a lot of credit, not just for the teaching actors how to be a police officer's. The little details such as  The authenticity of the NYPD Shields  uniforms and sets. The worst thing a cop can watch on TV about cops that you see a police captain wearing a detective shield or the wrong  Uniforms to me it's very upsetting.

Family of Cops has Charles Bronson with a mustache and who is a widower a the head of the Family with his sister also unmarried coming in from time to time. They have the eldest a girl who is a lawyer with the defenders office who dresses a lot like Bridget does. She pregnant and Bridget has a daughter who has the same short haircut as Charles Bronson's Youngest daughter who in the 3rd part of the series joins the police academy. Ben Fein - Charles Bronson's Oldest son is married with 2 kids and the second son gives up a career in architecture to become a cop and flirts with dating. Now instead of having a son that died Ben Fein in the first part almost loses his life.

Finally, the family values, strong together and belief in God in both series. The difference is Chritian / Catholic ( I haven't figured it out) and Jewish.",1473897600,2,1102,4.344660194174757

4197364,5,B003UD7JC6,"A gripping series with compelling plot lines and enough suspense to keep viewers coming back for more. (I hope I'll find more episodes free on Amazon Prime!)  The main characters are 4 generations of a New York City family of cops:  great-grandfather was a police commissioner (now retired), grandfather [Tom Selleck, the main character] is the current police commissioner; his 2 grown sons (Jamie and Danny) are cops, and the grown daughter (Erin) is an attorney. Oldest granddaughter, in high school, wants to become a cop someday.  The show has many gritty and heartwarming interchanges between the characters. Often a few lines convey profound life lessons or principles worth chewing on. One of the most refreshing aspects of the show is the extended family's commitment to gathering together to prepare and eat Sunday dinner together after church. Seeing the differing personalities reflected in family members around the table conversing with each other meaningfully--often humorously, or in conflict but still engaged conversationally--reminds me that despite today's increasing fragmentation in families and society in general, there are still families that regard together-times as a priority. May their tribe increase!",1472428800,,1229,5.561497326203209

4197520,5,B003UD7JC6,"When Blue Bloods first premiered on CBS in 2010, my first reaction was, What? Another show about New York City cops?

Over the years, there have been many shows about the NYPD, some good and some  not so good. Blue Bloods is one of the very good ones. Its actually less of a show about cops and more of one about an extended family that just happens to be made up of NYPD police officers.

One of them is Frank Reagan (Tom Selleck), the New York City Police Commissioner. His father, Henry (Len Cariou), is a retired Police Commissioner, and two of his sons  Danny (Donnie Wahlberg) and Jamie (Will Estes)  are cops. One is a detective, and the other a rookie patrol officer. Franks oldest son, Joe, was also a cop who was killed in the line of duty, and his only daughter, Erin (Bridget Moynihan), is an Assistant District Attorney.

It didn't take long for Blue Bloods to join the ranks of my favorite shows. Every episode in Season 1 is first-rate. The crimes that the Reagans investigate run the gamut from suspected acts of terrorism, to murders, to rapes, abductions, and robberies. The Reagans don't always use the latest high-tech investigative techniques. They frequently resort to good old-fashioned sleuthing to solve their cases. Sometimes they break the rules and get in trouble with their bosses. They often argue with each other. At the end of each episode, the Reagans gather around the dining room table and enjoy a meal together. All this makes for excellent drama in each episode. The scripts are great, and the performances by every member of the ensemble cast are simply outstanding.

I like Blue Bloods Season 1 so much that I added the 6-DVD set to my home video collection. Highly recommended.",1471305600,,1717,4.703333333333333

Amazon wanted me to review this so I am, but how many different ways can you say you like something -- alot.  There's a lot of good action and police cars and sirens and the actors are good and I like how Magnum P.I. is a police comishner, (not spelled right, I know), but I really miss the red ferrari and the helicopter.  Magnums Dad plays the Higgins character and Mark Wahlburgs brother is a son and his sons are actors in the show.  The one thing the show is lacking is more pretty actresses.  There are two moderately pretty ones, but no really pretty ones.  I think this would help with their ratings, but for me I don't need to see pretty girls because I''m married already.

4198426,5,B003UD7JC6,"This show hooked me from the pilot, which I just discovered on Amazon Prime, because I fell in love with the Reagan family immediately. The first few episodes felt a bit cliche when it came to setting up plot and character development, but the A+ caliber actors quickly overcame that. Love seeing Tom Selleck again, as I was a huge fan of his from his Magnum P.I. days, but what surprised me most were the supporting actors. I adore every single one of them and wish I could invite them over for dinner! Hope the show keeps going because I have a lot of episodes to watch before I catch up!!",1470009600,2,591,4.333333333333333
