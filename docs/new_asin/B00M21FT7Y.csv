It tells an unusual story of long distance and distant love between mature adults, moving in a deliberate and at times surprising ways, but ends in a scene so wonderfully and beautifully played that if you do not love this movie and the principal characters, you have a cold hard heart. :)  IF you could only watch the last five minutes - somehow knowing how you got there, it would still be rewarding.",1421884800,,517,4.468085106382978
