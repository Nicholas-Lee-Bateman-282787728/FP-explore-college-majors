3892998,5,B002BE7JHK,"Here are three spooky episodes from the Goosebumps series.

In Attack of the Jack-O-Lanterns, a group of kids plan on scaring a couple of kids that always plays pranks on them, but they weren't aware of the aliens in town.

Freddy and Cara stumble upon a secret room in Vampire Breath which contains a real vampire. I like the twisted ending to this one.

Let's Get Invisible has Max and Noah stumbling upon an old mirror that turns you invisible. The more the kids play around with the mirror, the less chances they have of surviving.

I love the Jack-O-Lantern cover on this DVD.",1345939200,,581,4.5576923076923075

3893000,4,B002BE7JHK,"I read all these books when I was younger (teenager and young adult) and really thought they were interesting and scary. My daughter loves scary shows and Goosebumps movies. So,I purchased this DVD along with another. The stories on this DVD are scary for kids. As an adult they are only mildly interesting, mostly b/c of the bad acting. However, my daughter really liked the show, and these episodes, and that's really what counts.",1330560000,,432,4.851351351351352
3893001,5,B002BE7JHK,"Things going bump in the night, shadows in the dark, strange eerie sounds, another spooky children's movie from author based R.L. Stine. This is another classic tale of strange happenings, much like a camp fire setting, where people tell ghost stories!! This is Great fun to watch, both for children and adults alike.",1298419200,3,317,5.0
3893002,4,B002BE7JHK,"GOOSEBUMPS: ATTACK OF THE JACK-O'-LANTERNS features three episodes of the once- popular tv show, GOOSEBUMPS, that was based upon the highly successful young adult ""horror"" book franchise. The first episode is ""Attack of the Jack-O'-Lanterns.""  Drew is a girl who looks forward to trick-or-treating each year, but she is growing tired of the sister and brother duo of Tabitha & Lee frightening her and trying to ruin her fun.  When two of her old friends who used to live in the neighborhood show up unexpectedly, they agree to help Drew give a Halloween scaring to Tabitha & Lee that they won't forget.

The second episode is ""Vampire Breath.""  Twins Freddy and Cara are left at home for the night on they eve of their 13th birthday.  Their parents warn them not to hunt for any presents while they are away, but the twins don't listen and discover a secret door in their basement that contains the secret lair of a sleeping vampire.

""Let's Get Invisible"" is the third and final episode on the DVD.  Two brothers, Max & Noah, and their friend, Erin, discover a strange mirror hidden behind a boarded-up room upstairs in their house.  They soon learn that the mirror has the power to turn people invisible.  At first they have fun turning themselves invisible, but the fun turns frightening when they discover the unexpected side effects using the mirror causes.

GOOSEBUMPS: ATTACK OF THE JACK-O'-LANTERNS is a DVD that fans of Goosebumps will probably enjoy.  As a bit of trivia, look for a young Kevin Zegers, one of the stars of the movie FROZEN, in ""Let's Get Invisible.""",1290902400,5,1576,4.77859778597786

3893004,5,B002BE7JHK,"This DVD contains three scary episodes from popular children's writer R.L Stine.  The first episode, ""Attack of the Jack-O'-Lanterns, follows four young kids as they go out trick-or-treating.  Lee and Tabby enjoy scaring their friends and this year, they decide to keep up the tradition.  But, the tables are turned, and the friends are scared by several scary jack-O'-lanterns.

""Vampire Breath"" is the second episode on the DVD.  Freddy and Cara are about to celebrate their 13th birthday and decide to snoop for their presents.  Instead of finding presents, they discover a hidden door in the basement that hides a scary secret.

The final episode is called ""Let's Get Invisible"".  Max and Noah discover a mysterious mirror located in a hidden room in their house.  The mirror has the power to make them invisible.  At first, becoming invisible is fun for the boys, but as they continue to experiment, the fun turns to something else.

The R.L. Stine series of books have been favorites of my children for some time, and they enjoyed watching this scary DVD.  The episodes are scary, but not so scary as to give them nightmares.  I recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys the R.L. Stine book series.  Turn out the lights, curl up in front of the tv, and get ready for some Goosebumps!",1254182400,27,1287,4.790909090909091

3893014,5,B002BE7JHK,"I was born in 1990 but i have nieces and me personally i just dig the oldschool stuff i used to remember seeing as a kid,from horror movies to music but this is like the Stephen King of childrens books. R.L. Stine was definitely a writer who's books i always read in school,i still have some. But the episode Attack of the Jack-O Lanterns itself was one that creeped me out as a kid at about 5 or 6 seeing it for the first time. I like to reminisce and i just can actually get into watching 1 of these around Halloween,especially if my nieces are over i try to collect the good ones i remember & hang onto them til' i have kids Then it's like this is what i grew up with(and back then things were more interesting & more decent for young children. This particular dvd is one of my favorites becaise i remember the title so well & that's the best episode on the disc. The episode always stuck out & Goosebumps is very mild for young children while maintaining a story & being a bit spooky for kids. It is just like the show Are You Afraid of the Dark? But you get a few other episodes  that are Let's Get Invisible: The plot real quick is these kids find an old mirror that turns em into ghosts and get stuck on the other side.
Next and last episode is Vampire Breath: That one i found to be amusimg,theres a brother & sister left alone the night before their birthday they find this hidden tomb. Unleashing a vampire that wants his  vampire breath back to be 100% and get his fangs. All in all the 3 episodes are all excellent. Kids 4-12 would enjoy it or just parents who grew up watching it and want to trip down memory lane while showing your kids what you grew up on.",1423699200,,1671,4.154320987654321
