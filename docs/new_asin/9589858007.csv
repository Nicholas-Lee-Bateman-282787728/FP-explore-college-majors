7901774,5,9589858007,"This one of a kind documentary highlights the raw, gritty Colombian hip-hop scene.
It probably played more than a minor role in the growing fame of bands like ChocQuibTown, Systema Solar, and others you'll discover on the DVD and CD included.

You'll get much more than a taste of the intensity and fortitude of each of the street artists rhyming out their experiences.

A definite must for any global hip-hop fan. Get it before the limited copies run out. It's well worth it. You won't find anything like this in the US.",1430956800,,521,4.6521739130434785
