2408785,4,B000B8QG18,"Disney sure loves to mess with us american buyers.

First they remove sports goofy in soccormania from it's  extreme sports american release, and now this.

The funny factory dvds was released in most counties before we got them.

They got mickey mouse works tv cartoons.

We get the same thing we get on the classics collection, and disney treasures.

Still, these are great cartoons for anyone who missed the treasures sets.",1143763200,2,426,4.929577464788732
2408786,4,B000B8QG18,"While these titles are all available on the Treasures disc, this is the perfect dvd to give to your children to watch vs risking damage to the ""collector"" dvd.  My kids love the older Mickey cartoons so to invest a few dollars into this disc makes more sense than worrying about the more expensive disc getting ruined. Be glad that Disney is releasing their titles in a more affordable and accessible manner.  Plus a lot of people never had the opportunity to buy the canistered dvd because of limited release and higher cost.",1139961600,13,526,4.645161290322581
2408787,4,B000B8QG18,"As another reviewer points out, all of the shorts on this DVD are on other DVD sets, notably the Walt Disney Treasures Mickey in color Vol. 1 & 2 sets.  If you are a true Disney aficionado then I would highly recommend the Disney Treasures sets.  That said, I'm not going to give this a poor review just because the shorts are available in another set.  For the budget conscious who just wants some good, classic Mickey shorts this is a solid DVD with eight shorts made between 1937 and 1951.

""Mickey and the Seal"" (1948) (6:35) Mickey unexpectedly returns from the zoo with a baby seal resulting in a very jealous Pluto.

""Mr. Mouse Takes a Trip"" (1940) (7:44) - Mickey and Pluto find themselves up against Pete who won't let them on a train when they try and take a vacation.

""Moose Hunters"" (1937) (8:36) - Mickey, Donald, and Goofy all go out to hunt moose and get more than they bargained for in attracting their prey.

""Mickey's Parrot"" (1938) (7:39) - the killer Machine Gun Butch has escaped from Prison but it's a parrot that causes Mickey and Pluto the real terror.

""The Pointer"" (1939) (8:28) - When Mickey and Pluto go hunting for a bear, Mickey mistakes Pluto for his target resulting in one angry pup!

""Magician Mickey"" (1937) (7:01) - Mickey is trying to perform a magic act but Donald is in the audience heckling him.

""Tugboat Mickey"" (1940) (7:16) - Mickey, Donald, and Goofy experience a whole host of problems while operating a tugboat.  Hilarious slapstick!

""R'Coon Dawg"" (1951) (7:05) - Mickey is second banana as Pluto attempts to catch a raccoon.

The video and audio is above average although some of the older toons do show a little bit of age and distortion.  Nothing bad though.  Overall these are very good but I'd still steer fans toward the Treasures editions.

2408788,1,B000B8QG18,"Question: Why buy something you already have?
Answer: Because Disney says so!

Well that is what they hope.  If you are looking for a DVD to let your kids watch to protect your copies of the ""Disney Treasures: Mickey Mouse"" DVD Tins, then get this.  Otherwise you are just under Disney's spell.

Yes, these are ***** five star cartoons, but they are on a one star DVD!

MICKEY AND THE SEAL (1948 repeat from Mickey Mouse In Color DVD Tin #2)

MOOSE HUNTERS (1937 repeat from Mickey Mouse In Color DVD Tin #1)

MICKEY'S PARROT (1938 repeat from the Pluto DVD Tin #1)
Mickey and Pluto overhear a radio broadcast about an escaped, dangerous criminal. When the two hear a voice that they think belongs to the criminal, they get more and more nervous. The voice turns out to be Mickey's pet parrot, to the relief of everyone.

The POINTER (1939 repeat from the Pluto DVD Tin #1)
Mickey tries to train Pluto to be a hunting dog when they go looking for quail. Instead, they run into a very large bear, and soon they're on the run themselves. Instead of quail, Mickey and Pluto settle for a can of beans.

MAGICIAN MICKEY (1937 repeat from Mickey Mouse In Color DVD Tin #1)
Donald tries to heckle Mickey during a magic act, but his antics backfire. Not giving up, Donald finds a way to stir the audience up before the final curtain.

TUGBOAT MICKEY (1940 repeat from Mickey Mouse In Color DVD Tin #2)
Captain Mickey issues orders to shipmates Donald and Goofy to respond to an SOS. Donald and Goofy find a way to comically bungle the rescue operation, of course. Eventually they sink their own ship - just in time to find out that the ""SOS"" was really a radio show.

R'COON DAWG  (1951 repeat from the Pluto DVD Tin #1)
Mickey, sporting a Davy Crockett-style raccoon hat, goes hunting with Pluto. When they corner a potential hunting target, the wily animal convinces Mickey that his raccoon hat is really its baby.

8083548,5,B000B8QG18,"It was said that during the making of Disney's Funny Factory collection in 2005 and '06, other countries' versions of this collection were made up of shorts from Mickey MouseWorks and Disney's House of Mouse. Even though Roy E. Disney played himself in one of those shorts, he felt these particular shorts didn't deserve a non-holiday home video release in the USA. So the USA's Funny Factory collection is all classic shorts, in a similar manner to Disney's Classic Cartoon Favorites collection, but with gag-filled ""Easter eggs"" (hidden bonuses) on the main menus, including a chattering-teeth racing game in volumes 1 and 2! Volume 1 of this collection stars Mickey in 8 of his best-known color classics, including Oscar nominees The Pointer (1939, where Mickey started looking very much as he does today, not counting the new shorts) and Mickey & The Seal (1948)! It'd take a miracle for Disney to go back on Roy E. Disney's word to never make Mickey MouseWorks/House of Mouse home video releases in the USA, even though he's gone from this world now, and the new Mickey shorts are on DVD to prove it. Since the Treasures tins are getting more and more scarce, these hour-long Disneytoon DVDs aren't as scarce, even though they're all in the Disney Vault now! Add the Funny Factory collection to your sets of classic Disneytoon DVDs today!",1431302400,,1343,4.868995633187773
8083549,3,B000B8QG18,"About half of these cartoons are good, the rest are rather mediocre.  These Disney cartoon collections are over-priced and niggardly-supplied -- just eight cartoons of varying quality.  The good ones on ""Funny Factory with Mickey"" (Vol. 1) are ""M.M. Takes a Trip"", ""Moose Hunters"", ""The Pointer"", and ""Magician Mickey"".  Those are clever, entertaining shorts.  The other four aren't worth watching, sadly.  Disney makes this expensive, ungenerous collection all the less-enjoyable with its annoying advertisements and menus.  A simple, music-free menu allowing quick access to any of the cartoons would be so-preferable.  Sigh....",1428710400,,630,5.782608695652174
