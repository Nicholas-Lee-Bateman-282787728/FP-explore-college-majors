The sound is a little thin, thus the 4 instead of 5 stars, but if like me you are a fan of Milton you'll be more than happy to have this chance to see him perform.  You can find  a new copy of this DVD for much less than people are selling used copies here.  I found mine at caravanmusic.com.",1134432000,2,418,4.1234567901234565
