7930736,4,B0000541W9,"this movie sizzles with its great cast that spark and snap this thrilling, well thriller. Peter Coyote(Sphere) is a writer, Nastassja Kinski(Cold Heart, One Night Stand, Little Boy Blue and Cat People) is the one he writes to in prison and she meets him. Jeremy Piven(PCU, Judgment Night) is Coyotes friend, and Fairuza Balk(The Craft, The Island Of Dr. Moreau) is the girl infatuated with Coyote. the cast is great, no doubt, especially Piven(who is always great). you also got supporting cast members like Udo Kier(Blade, Barb Wire), Ernie Hudson(The Substitute, No Escape and Pauly Shore(In The Army Now, Son In Law). hang on",1067385600,4,628,5.048076923076923
7930737,4,B0000541W9,"I started watching this movie with the assumpton that it was going to be very bad and not a good movie at all as I had heard from numerous other reviews and posts, etc. But I actually highly enjoyed this movie. It does have it's faults, yes, but still it is an entertaining movie to me and I think it could be to others too, if they would give it a chance. It does have a very low budget feel to it (not the faul of the director, Bradley Battersby, the music was changed without his permission and he was given only twenty days to shoot it or he would be fired) but these are all the fault of the producers who basically made everything that is cheesy about it that way. I have heard what the original plan for the movie was and that plan was very unique, but as  mentioned above, it was not to be this way through not fault of anybody's except the producers. But again, a highy enjoyable movie with wonderful performances by Natassja Kinski and Peter Coyote (though he hams things up way too much). Good for a light laugh and some enjoyability.",1036972800,5,1045,4.251256281407035
7930738,2,B0000541W9,"Unfotunately, the talents of the cast are ill used. The story trys to be clever and sexually titallating, but mostly is just silly. The characters never seem real and the story less so. I am a big fan of both Ms. Kinski and Balk and wasting their talents in this tawdry thriller was very disappointing.",984268800,2,302,4.509090909090909
