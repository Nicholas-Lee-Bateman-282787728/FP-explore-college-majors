7904747,3,B000006QW2,"Anyone more than remotely familiar with Frankenstein and the mythos behind it (the true reanimation experiments; the famous ""contest"" between Byron, Polidori and the Shelleys, etc) will find familiar ground in this almost-hour-long documentary chronicling the life and times of Mary Shelley. Occasionally, the presentation stops short of scandalous--there are a few references to the Shelleys' views on ""free love"" but nothing concrente. But overall, the documentary drags, with very little commentary, too much panning on artwork, and not enough detail about the ""real life"" experiments Mary Shelley was supposedly influenced by. There is also no detail on Shelley's numerous miscarriages, which has also been postulated as a source of pathos for her creature's sad story.",1044662400,,773,5.672413793103448
