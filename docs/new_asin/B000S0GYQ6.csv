The DVD had what I wanted, the other videos aren't any good, though",1366761600,,121,4.304347826086956
8203468,1,B000S0GYQ6,"We are BIG fans of the Scholastic Video Collection. Most of the stories are based on the very best books for kids, and the videos reflect well the tenor and charm of the stories and characters. Not so with this one! We were, frankly, appalled by the Ralph S. Mouse video--- the adult and child actors alike were forced to embrace ugly, selfish traits, ones that were largely absent from the Cleary stories. Ralph is, in this video, whiny and unpleasant, and voiced with a lack of understanding for the character so complete that he is even bratty and ungenerous to ""Ryan"", his friend and savior in the series. Why was this necessary?!?! Ralph is spirited and a little scampy in the books, but certainly not ungenerous and peevish, as he is characterized here. Most of the adults in this video speak to one another, and to children, with such a consistency of disrespect and stridency, one must assume they were directed to do so... but, again, for what purpose? So what can my children learn from seeing this? Ugh! Badly done, Scholastic! The other two stories are fine, certainly not representative of this company's best efforts, but not horrible... but, sadly, the bulk of the time on this dvd is devoted to Ralph. Look to the other Scholastic videos--- Chrysanthemum, and Pete's A Pizza are two of the best, IMO--- if you want true representations of the books and characters your kids, and you, love.",1293840000,,1405,4.715447154471545
8203469,5,B000S0GYQ6,"What the first reviewers apparently did not know is that this video is part of a larger collection of videos which bring favorite children's stories to video.  This one does contain one episode of the Ralph S. Mouse series, as well as several other titles.  There are dozens of Scholastic Video Collection videos, all available on both DVD or VHS as far as I know.  They are great videos, which all 4 of my kids have enjoyed.  Most have bonus stories in addition to the two or three listed on the back, some have interviews with authors or illustrators, and some have read-along features or Spanish-language versions.

If you are looking for the complete series of Ralph S. Mouse, look somewhere else.  If you are looking for children's books animated on video, then this is a good one to start with.",1199836800,5,800,4.638297872340425
8203470,2,B000S0GYQ6,"I don't know why they didn't release all the episodes together either. (well I guess I do $$$$ get us to buy this multiple times) anyway I was disappointed that this was not the one I was hoping for....My children didn't want to finish this movie and I doubt they will pick it out again, but they loved the book.",1193097600,6,312,4.216666666666667
8203471,2,B000S0GYQ6,"When I first heard about this I thought ""it's about time they put the mouse on a motorcycle series on dvd"". But guess what, it's only one of the three episodes! And it's not even the first one! how dissapointing this is. Why can't these guys ever get it right?! Here I was all set to get this for my 5 year old nephew and it's only one episode and not the first. And what are these two other no-name episode?! What dummies make these brainless decissions? Just like when tv execs decide to show tv series episodes out of order so that it's hard to follow along! Come'on guys it's not that hard! 1 leads to 2 which leads to 3. Get it and get a clue! Anyways I won't buy this till they get it right!",1192665600,9,697,4.057971014492754
