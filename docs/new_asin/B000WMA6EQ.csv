2984462,5,B000WMA6EQ,"I use this program as a warm up before I go on the treadmill or other exercise routine
,also as a cool down routine. Lots of fun,so now I can dance when I go cruising to the Carribean!",1206489600,2,184,3.8684210526315788
2984463,4,B000WMA6EQ,"I am a big fan of the ""10 minute solution""-series and I also adore this workout. I love the fact that there are 5 different segments that I can do in whatever order I want to. Hot Cardio Mix & Tango Toning Twist are my favorite sections. If you really get into the groove and move you will feel it, especially in your hips and waist.
I like Stella beacuse she seems to enjoy the workout which makes it easy for me to forget that she sometimes says right when she means left and that the music is a little low sometimes. And those are the reasons I give it four stars instead of five. However, that's not something that doesn't bother me at all since I've done it a few times and now know which way to go and what to do.
So if your like the latin style dances this should definately be a dvd in your collection along with Stella's Sizzling Salsa.",1204934400,4,845,4.127272727272727
2984464,4,B000WMA6EQ,"I really enjoy this dvd. It was better than I expected. No, it is not for someone who does high intensity aerobics every day. But if you are like me, just trying to work in 20 or 30 minutes of physical activity several times a week, this is perfect! It got my heart rate up, but it's not high-impact or hard on my bad knee and back. The moves aren't so easy I got bored right away, but they are fun to work on and improve my latin dance technique and I always feel like I can handle 2 or 3 segments, even if I really don't feel like exercising. The dancing is a lot more fun and I am more motivated to do it than boring excercise videos, which end up dusty and buried under the couch. I like the 10 Minute Solutions Fat Blasting Dance Mix too, but I sometimes I feel awkward and old trying to do those hip hop moves.",1204243200,12,816,3.981707317073171
2984465,4,B000WMA6EQ,"Despite the previous poor reviews, I went out and bought this dvd.  I wasn't expecting much because others rated it poorly, however I was pleasantly surprised.  The cuing is not that bad (I know others that are worse), and I thought she was pretty easy to follow.  I have almost every dance workout so I am familiar with the different steps.  It was not very intense, but it was a good workout for a lighter day.  I was actually glad there was not a warmup and cool down in every section, rather just cardio.  I can do all the warming and cooling on my own.  Overall, it was fun and got my heart rate up but not racing.",1204156800,17,619,4.194915254237288
2984466,4,B000WMA6EQ,"Okay, so I had a great time working out to this DVD. The moves were fun, yet challenging and it kept my heart rate up giving me a good sweat.  It gives me something to work up to without the steps being too complicated.  I enjoy latin dance and enjoyed Stella's sincere personality.  A Latina with Groove!

2984467,4,B000WMA6EQ,"I like this video workout.  I did the whole video and felt that the time just flew by.  It is pretty fast paced and her cueing is not the best, but I don't find her at all annoying like some other instructors.  I bought the crunch salsa video and I couldn't do that one at all.  One of the background people drove me nuts.  I know - such a stupid reason, but I just couldn't work out to that video so I gave it away.  But I liked this one and can see myself doing it once a week.  I say once a week, because it's a little too light of a workout for me.  I like more of an intense cardio workout and this is definitely not the case.  I would say that you need to have knowledge of a basic cha-cha step and merengue step.  If you know how to do these two steps, this workout should be ok because she does move quickly.  And I find it fun.",1203033600,3,836,3.8304093567251463
2984468,1,B000WMA6EQ,"I am a big fan of the 10 minute solutions series. I was so excited about the release of this video, that I preordered it through Amazon a couple weeks before it was released.

After enjoying such great moves, cuing and cardio action in Fat Blasting Dance Mix and Dance It Off & Tone It Up (both instructed by Jennifer Galardi) I have to say this DVD was a let down.

1. The cuing is horrible! She doesn't do a great job cuing you for the next move, and she even gets her sides confused!

A good workout (or dance) video says ""left"" or ""right"" from your perspective. When they say ""left"" it means your left, and they actually go to their right. This makes it much much easier to follow. Sometimes Stella Sandoval did that, but sometimes she got her sides confused and said ""right"" for her right instead of the viewer's. This makes it very difficult to keep up, and makes things confusing. Plus, she doesn't even lead you into every move, you have to watch her closely to come close to going the right way.

2. The moves and music were unremarkable.

Even though I did have fun doing this video for the most part, I can see how these moves will get boring quick. At one part during the workout, I didn't hear ANY music. I don't know if it was a soft part in that song, or if someone fell asleep during taping.

3. Low end cardio.

I broke a mild sweat before the 50 minutes were up, but the video is really very low intensity.

4. No warm ups, cool downs, or stretches??

Part of the reason I love the 10 minute series is they do a small warm up/cool down/stretch at the beginning and end of every segment. After all, each segment is supposed to be designed to be used independently, so you have to. This allows me to make sure I am stretching throughout the workout, which is really good for your body.

This DVD warms you up briefly in the beginning of the 1st segment. That's it. No stretches. No cool down. This is a HUGE flaw!

5. Far too fast in some parts.

By fast, I don't mean cardio workout wise. As I mentioned, this video isn't the best of cardio workouts. I mean when she is teaching the moves. She doesn't break down each part in an easy to follow slow manner like Galardi does.

6. The video cover is wrong.

A small point which doesn't make too much difference in your buying decision, but is useful info for those trying it for the first time. The workouts do not play in the order indicated on the cover.

In summary: It was fun to do since I don't know anything about salsa so that made it unique for me. But it will get boring quickly I am sure. It isn't inense enough as a workout to become a regular component in my fitness plan. The cuing makes it difficult to follow, so it will take a few times to get the hang of it. All in all? Go get the (2) 10 minute solution dance videos by Jennifer Galardi if you want a good, well cued, effective workout. Rent this from Blockbuster for a night if you want to try a few salsa moves. Other than that, not really worth it.",1202688000,42,2985,4.194055944055944
2984469,2,B000WMA6EQ,"I bought this DVD because I'm a huge fan of the 10 Minute Solution DVDs.  I liked all the ones I've bought.  However, the instructor in this DVD seems to be dancing by herself and is not in tune with the audience.  She goes too fast as if though she's in a hurry to complete this in 10 minutes.  I got very discouraged trying to follow it the first time.  Not recommended for beginners.",1202342400,3,386,4.162162162162162

2984525,5,B000WMA6EQ,This is a fun DVD to use for getting your cardio workouts in at home.  I really like how you can do as little as 10 minutes if you are short on time.  The dance instructions are very simple to follow and enjoyable to do.,1392422400,,220,3.8666666666666667
2984526,4,B000WMA6EQ,I bought this as a beginner to start getting in shape. I bought 4 of these types of videos and only liked this one. I would recommend this for someone that is just starting out to get in shape. The instructor takes her time showing you the moves and then you can work up to something faster. I also like that these are 10 minute segments so you can chose to do one or two at a time.,1383523200,2,382,3.91025641025641

I also use her other workout dvd. I would truly recommend this workout for beginners, and the more seasoned salsa dancers. This workout does it for me, and I forget that I am working out. I normally workout 4-5 days per week for about 30 minutes, but once I start this workout I end up doing all 5 of the workouts. This type of workout is really good for slimming you down, if that is what you are looking for.

The steps were way to complicated and the angle of the camera following the instructor made it very difficult to catch on.  I have another workout video which I love and just wanted something to add to my collection and also add some variety.  I'll be sure not to pick up these 10minute videos again.  I also didn't like that only she was on the video.  I like when there are a group of 4-5 ladies making it fun.",1362096000,2,505,4.175257731958763

What I love about the 10 minute solution videos is that once you do one, it feels so quick and easy that you do another and another.  There is enough of a switch up with a title sequence per workout and the instructor's change of outfits that it breaks up.the workout and makes it feel very quick.

2984535,1,B000WMA6EQ,"The instructor is high energy and likeable, but the actual instruction is very poor. She confuses left and right and rushes through each section without good explanation of the steps. For example, the cha-cha step is not explained, just ""do a triple"".  Also, I have taken Latin ballroom dance, and I felt like this video just threw a bunch of Spanish dance words in without consideration for the actual form. For example, the salsa segment never tells you that the salsa count is 1, 2, 3 (hold), 5, 6, 7 (hold). And then cha-cha steps are thrown in to the salsa segment. Messed up.

This might be a fun aerobics DVD for someone who didn't care about actual dance moves. I was hoping for more.",1352937600,3,692,4.528

2984538,2,B000WMA6EQ,"As an individual with 18 years if dance experience, I had expected an individual tapped to make a dance oriented exercise video to be more impressive.  Sandoval (the instructor) gave unclear direction at several points in the workout.  Also, the choreography left something to be desired.  Some of the moves, SHE frequently performed incorrectly because the counts were not consistent with the music.  I have really enjoyed the 10 minute solution series, but this was a bit of a letdown.  If I had trouble doing the moves, I would assume individuals without training would as well.  Granted, I have a more discerning eye and am probably more interested in correct execution...still, I found this DVD frustrating at best.",1311984000,,720,5.059322033898305
2984539,2,B000WMA6EQ,"After getting all mixed up reading positive and negative reviews on workout DVD's I decided to go for a pack of three 10 Minute Solution ones so that I could try a bit of everything. I got this one which I tried this morning, the Target Toning for Beginners and the Blast Off Belly Fat. I am not in need of losing weight but I do need to get rid of a bit of belly fat and get toned. At 52 with three adult daughters your body is not perfect anymore!

These are my first DVD's of this kind. I have to say that I had a good workout. At the end of the 50 minutes I was really sweating, so much so that my hair was wet even though I was wearing very little and the heating was not on (it is quite cold here right now....). But I found most exercises rather difficult to follow if you are not used to this kind of DVD's. Maybe later on it will all be easier. I did quite a bit of Ballroom dancing in the past and the teacher used to show the steps a few times without music, then we would do them with him, only when everybody was clear about the whole thing the music would be turned on. I find that these DVD's probably try to do everything quite fast in order to save space but the many complaints I read about them being difficult to follow (almost all the DVD's) makes me think that this would be the better approach.

I found the last 10 minutes easier because the steps were less complicated. For the rest part of the time I was doing something similar but surely not the correct steps, especially when the lady does the whole dance. I have Jason Vale's trampolining DVD and the first part is dedicated to trying out all the moves which are explained quite clearly. That works best..... I find workout DVD's are worth the money spent on them as one is more motivated to keep on going than if one was exercising on one's own (I was impressed how quickly 50 minutes went by...) but there needs to be some changes made in the way they are set up. That said I found the exercise room rather bare, I would have liked to have seen a more inviting place. It is not very important but it would be more inspiring. Also sometimes the lady would say jump while one was still doing something else, very confusing. I will try the other two and let you know what I think!",1298851200,,2259,4.120181405895692
2984570,1,B000WMA6EQ,"I was hopeful for this, really like others in the series.

2984571,4,B000WMA6EQ,"I will admit that even as a former dancer, I had initial difficulty in learning some of the dance routines.  She goes pretty quickly in areas and sort of blazes from one movement to another.  However, after a couple of uses, the steps do get much easier, and now I can do them with complete proficiency.  Now I prefer the quick speed in which she transitions through the movements because it makes the workout more interesting and dynamic. It's really fun.  My recommendation is purchase the DVD if you have the inclinations of a dancer, stumble through it the first few times, and then you honestly will enjoy it once you have the steps.  However, an additional draw-back is the absolute lack of a cool-down.  I wish they could have tacked on a five minute cool-down; the DVD does end quite abruptly and I'm left walking around the living room as a poor substitute.",1296518400,,866,4.590909090909091

2984573,4,B000WMA6EQ,"This is my second dvd workout by Stella Sandoval. I usually don't like exercising to solo person, but Stella held her own by herself. I like this dvd. A lot of the moves she did in this dvd, she did in her Dance Off The Inches Sizzling Salsa dvd workout. I tend to catch on to dances quick. I like that she repeats the dances. Repetition is always good in a dance workout. It helps the person learn the steps and before they know it, they will know it like the back of their hands.

I'm glad for my Core Rhythms workouts as well. They have helped me with this workout as well.

Stellla has another dvd that's out already or coming out. I hope to get that one soon.

The 5 parts provide different concentrations but each of them are so much fun! The dances make the 10 minutes go by quickly, you're surprised to look up at the clock and you're almost done!

True, I do not have any previous experience in latin dancing, but I know how to dance - this was just too much!! She would barely get you through the moves before she started the next one. I just could not keep up with her. I also did not feel as though I was really getting a workout from this - maybe if I wanted to learn latin dancing, but I assumed it was a workout DVD? Maybe she goes too fast that I am not getting the benefits from the workout, but I do not like.

2984577,5,B000WMA6EQ,"I am actually using this video this morning. I LOVE this! I find the instructor, Stella Sandoval, interesting and motivating without being too over the top. I like her style and energy. I have no trouble following the routines just by watching her on the screen. The steps are simple enough to do without her having to break down each step. With her as the lone instructor I am having no trouble following. There is no extraneous noise or movement on the set. Also; she is being viewed from different camera angles; therefore, making it easier to see her body movement, etc.

Having stated the above, I do think that I should tell you that I am a relative beginner to this. I have used some videos in the past to work out with. However; I had a fairly serious accident 4 years ago and have not got back to working out with videos until just recently. I am fairly out of shape so I DO work up a good sweat to this. However; when I was in better condition, this whole DVD would have been just a warm-up for me. I used to do the Billy (whats-his-name) Tae Bo workouts. What I am trying to say is this: This is an excellent workout for beginners.

I DO have an extensive background in dance. I have no trouble keeping up with the instructor. But some people would have a hard time; especially if blessed with two left feet. But anyone can get a good workout with this video. If you are not doing EXACTLY what the instructor is, just keep moving. She's mixing steps from several different dance venues anyway.

This is not really an instructional video for dance. But it is a fun and easy to do simple workout routine.

CONS:
1)  the steps are fast for non dancers like myself--could have shown the steps mroe slowly for the first time so viewers can practise before starting with music
2)  only one instructor seemed quite boring--a few more people would be nice
3)  no warm up or cool down before and after quite an intensive workout

Some of the moves were cute/fun
This will get your heart rate up some of the time & moves your feet a lot
Stella does break down the moves since there is no separate area to learn the dances.

Cons:
Stella is a stiff dancer & uninspiring to watch
Stella isn't into the moment of dancing which killed me
Stella doesn't break down the subtle part of the moves that give them the finished/hot/cool look
Stella's cues are late & I noticed I follow by watching because of it
The dance moves got very repetitive, especially the easier to execute ones
Too many of the dances were modified or some done at a slower pace

I've used this video and I've also recommended it to my clients who want to do extra cardio work at home. They find it fun, easy to follow and love how warn and sincere Stella comes across. She is very ecouraging and inspirational.

Stella does a great job modifying these steps.  She make it's a workout that anyone can do. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to have fun, learn dance steps and sweat.",1211414400,6,567,4.380952380952381
2984638,3,B000WMA6EQ,"The host is great, but the speed is way too fast. She doesn't take enough time explaining how to step into all the moves. She says all the right things, but once again, everything is fast. It's hard to learn all the dance moves at the rapid pace!",1208131200,,246,4.145833333333333

3218960,4,B000WMA6EQ,"I am a big fan of the ""10 minute solution""-series and I also adore this workout. I love the fact that there are 5 different segments that I can do in whatever order I want to. Hot Cardio Mix & Tango Toning Twist are my favorite sections. If you really get into the groove and move you will feel it, especially in your hips and waist.
I like Stella beacuse she seems to enjoy the workout which makes it easy for me to forget that she sometimes says right when she means left and that the music is a little low sometimes. And those are the reasons I give it four stars instead of five. However, that's not something that doesn't bother me at all since I've done it a few times and now know which way to go and what to do.
So if your like the latin style dances this should definately be a dvd in your collection along with Stella's Sizzling Salsa.",1204934400,4,845,4.127272727272727
3218961,4,B000WMA6EQ,"I really enjoy this dvd. It was better than I expected. No, it is not for someone who does high intensity aerobics every day. But if you are like me, just trying to work in 20 or 30 minutes of physical activity several times a week, this is perfect! It got my heart rate up, but it's not high-impact or hard on my bad knee and back. The moves aren't so easy I got bored right away, but they are fun to work on and improve my latin dance technique and I always feel like I can handle 2 or 3 segments, even if I really don't feel like exercising. The dancing is a lot more fun and I am more motivated to do it than boring excercise videos, which end up dusty and buried under the couch. I like the 10 Minute Solutions Fat Blasting Dance Mix too, but I sometimes I feel awkward and old trying to do those hip hop moves.",1204243200,12,816,3.981707317073171
3218962,4,B000WMA6EQ,"Despite the previous poor reviews, I went out and bought this dvd.  I wasn't expecting much because others rated it poorly, however I was pleasantly surprised.  The cuing is not that bad (I know others that are worse), and I thought she was pretty easy to follow.  I have almost every dance workout so I am familiar with the different steps.  It was not very intense, but it was a good workout for a lighter day.  I was actually glad there was not a warmup and cool down in every section, rather just cardio.  I can do all the warming and cooling on my own.  Overall, it was fun and got my heart rate up but not racing.",1204156800,17,619,4.194915254237288
3218963,4,B000WMA6EQ,"Okay, so I had a great time working out to this DVD. The moves were fun, yet challenging and it kept my heart rate up giving me a good sweat.  It gives me something to work up to without the steps being too complicated.  I enjoy latin dance and enjoyed Stella's sincere personality.  A Latina with Groove!

3218964,4,B000WMA6EQ,"I like this video workout.  I did the whole video and felt that the time just flew by.  It is pretty fast paced and her cueing is not the best, but I don't find her at all annoying like some other instructors.  I bought the crunch salsa video and I couldn't do that one at all.  One of the background people drove me nuts.  I know - such a stupid reason, but I just couldn't work out to that video so I gave it away.  But I liked this one and can see myself doing it once a week.  I say once a week, because it's a little too light of a workout for me.  I like more of an intense cardio workout and this is definitely not the case.  I would say that you need to have knowledge of a basic cha-cha step and merengue step.  If you know how to do these two steps, this workout should be ok because she does move quickly.  And I find it fun.",1203033600,3,836,3.8304093567251463
3218965,1,B000WMA6EQ,"I am a big fan of the 10 minute solutions series. I was so excited about the release of this video, that I preordered it through Amazon a couple weeks before it was released.

After enjoying such great moves, cuing and cardio action in Fat Blasting Dance Mix and Dance It Off & Tone It Up (both instructed by Jennifer Galardi) I have to say this DVD was a let down.

1. The cuing is horrible! She doesn't do a great job cuing you for the next move, and she even gets her sides confused!

A good workout (or dance) video says ""left"" or ""right"" from your perspective. When they say ""left"" it means your left, and they actually go to their right. This makes it much much easier to follow. Sometimes Stella Sandoval did that, but sometimes she got her sides confused and said ""right"" for her right instead of the viewer's. This makes it very difficult to keep up, and makes things confusing. Plus, she doesn't even lead you into every move, you have to watch her closely to come close to going the right way.

2. The moves and music were unremarkable.

Even though I did have fun doing this video for the most part, I can see how these moves will get boring quick. At one part during the workout, I didn't hear ANY music. I don't know if it was a soft part in that song, or if someone fell asleep during taping.

3. Low end cardio.

I broke a mild sweat before the 50 minutes were up, but the video is really very low intensity.

4. No warm ups, cool downs, or stretches??

Part of the reason I love the 10 minute series is they do a small warm up/cool down/stretch at the beginning and end of every segment. After all, each segment is supposed to be designed to be used independently, so you have to. This allows me to make sure I am stretching throughout the workout, which is really good for your body.

This DVD warms you up briefly in the beginning of the 1st segment. That's it. No stretches. No cool down. This is a HUGE flaw!

5. Far too fast in some parts.

By fast, I don't mean cardio workout wise. As I mentioned, this video isn't the best of cardio workouts. I mean when she is teaching the moves. She doesn't break down each part in an easy to follow slow manner like Galardi does.

6. The video cover is wrong.

A small point which doesn't make too much difference in your buying decision, but is useful info for those trying it for the first time. The workouts do not play in the order indicated on the cover.

In summary: It was fun to do since I don't know anything about salsa so that made it unique for me. But it will get boring quickly I am sure. It isn't inense enough as a workout to become a regular component in my fitness plan. The cuing makes it difficult to follow, so it will take a few times to get the hang of it. All in all? Go get the (2) 10 minute solution dance videos by Jennifer Galardi if you want a good, well cued, effective workout. Rent this from Blockbuster for a night if you want to try a few salsa moves. Other than that, not really worth it.",1202688000,42,2985,4.194055944055944
3218966,2,B000WMA6EQ,"I bought this DVD because I'm a huge fan of the 10 Minute Solution DVDs.  I liked all the ones I've bought.  However, the instructor in this DVD seems to be dancing by herself and is not in tune with the audience.  She goes too fast as if though she's in a hurry to complete this in 10 minutes.

I also use her other workout dvd. I would truly recommend this workout for beginners, and the more seasoned salsa dancers. This workout does it for me, and I forget that I am working out. I normally workout 4-5 days per week for about 30 minutes, but once I start this workout I end up doing all 5 of the workouts. This type of workout is really good for slimming you down, if that is what you are looking for.

I have another workout video which I love and just wanted something to add to my collection and also add some variety.  I'll be sure not to pick up these 10minute videos again.

What I love about the 10 minute solution videos is that once you do one, it feels so quick and easy that you do another and another.  There is enough of a switch up with a title sequence per workout and the instructor's change of outfits that it breaks up.the workout and makes it feel very quick.

She confuses left and right and rushes through each section without good explanation of the steps. For example, the cha-cha step is not explained, just ""do a triple"".  Also, I have taken Latin ballroom dance, and I felt like this video just threw a bunch of Spanish dance words in without consideration for the actual form. For example, the salsa segment never tells you that the salsa count is 1, 2, 3 (hold), 5, 6, 7 (hold). And then cha-cha steps are thrown in to the salsa segment. Messed up.

This might be a fun aerobics DVD for someone who didn't care about actual dance moves. I was hoping for more.",1352937600,3,692,4.528

Sandoval (the instructor) gave unclear direction at several points in the workout.  Also, the choreography left something to be desired.  Some of the moves, SHE frequently performed incorrectly because the counts were not consistent with the music.  I have really enjoyed the 10 minute solution series, but this was a bit of a letdown.  If I had trouble doing the moves, I would assume individuals without training would as well.  Granted, I have a more discerning eye and am probably more interested in correct execution...still, I found this DVD frustrating at best.",1311984000,,720,5.059322033898305
3219036,2,B000WMA6EQ,"After getting all mixed up reading positive and negative reviews on workout DVD's I decided to go for a pack of three 10 Minute Solution ones so that I could try a bit of everything. I got this one which I tried this morning, the Target Toning for Beginners and the Blast Off Belly Fat. I am not in need of losing weight but I do need to get rid of a bit of belly fat and get toned. At 52 with three adult daughters your body is not perfect anymore!

These are my first DVD's of this kind. I have to say that I had a good workout. At the end of the 50 minutes I was really sweating, so much so that my hair was wet even though I was wearing very little and the heating was not on (it is quite cold here right now....). But I found most exercises rather difficult to follow if you are not used to this kind of DVD's. Maybe later on it will all be easier. I did quite a bit of Ballroom dancing in the past and the teacher used to show the steps a few times without music, then we would do them with him, only when everybody was clear about the whole thing the music would be turned on. I find that these DVD's probably try to do everything quite fast in order to save space but the many complaints I read about them being difficult to follow (almost all the DVD's) makes me think that this would be the better approach.

I found the last 10 minutes easier because the steps were less complicated. For the rest part of the time I was doing something similar but surely not the correct steps, especially when the lady does the whole dance. I have Jason Vale's trampolining DVD and the first part is dedicated to trying out all the moves which are explained quite clearly. That works best..... I find workout DVD's are worth the money spent on them as one is more motivated to keep on going than if one was exercising on one's own (I was impressed how quickly 50 minutes went by...) but there needs to be some changes made in the way they are set up. That said I found the exercise room rather bare, I would have liked to have seen a more inviting place. It is not very important but it would be more inspiring. Also sometimes the lady would say jump while one was still doing something else, very confusing. I will try the other two and let you know what I think!",1298851200,,2259,4.120181405895692

She goes pretty quickly in areas and sort of blazes from one movement to another.  However, after a couple of uses, the steps do get much easier, and now I can do them with complete proficiency.  Now I prefer the quick speed in which she transitions through the movements because it makes the workout more interesting and dynamic. It's really fun.  My recommendation is purchase the DVD if you have the inclinations of a dancer, stumble through it the first few times, and then you honestly will enjoy it once you have the steps.  However, an additional draw-back is the absolute lack of a cool-down.  I wish they could have tacked on a five minute cool-down; the DVD does end quite abruptly and I'm left walking around the living room as a poor substitute.",1296518400,,866,4.590909090909091

A lot of the moves she did in this dvd, she did in her Dance Off The Inches Sizzling Salsa dvd workout. I tend to catch on to dances quick. I like that she repeats the dances. Repetition is always good in a dance workout. It helps the person learn the steps and before they know it, they will know it like the back of their hands.

I'm glad for my Core Rhythms workouts as well. They have helped me with this workout as well.

Stellla has another dvd that's out already or coming out. I hope to get that one soon.

I just could not keep up with her. I also did not feel as though I was really getting a workout from this - maybe if I wanted to learn latin dancing, but I assumed it was a workout DVD? Maybe she goes too fast that I am not getting the benefits from the workout, but I do not like.

I like her style and energy. I have no trouble following the routines just by watching her on the screen. The steps are simple enough to do without her having to break down each step. With her as the lone instructor I am having no trouble following. There is no extraneous noise or movement on the set. Also; she is being viewed from different camera angles; therefore, making it easier to see her body movement, etc.

Having stated the above, I do think that I should tell you that I am a relative beginner to this. I have used some videos in the past to work out with. However; I had a fairly serious accident 4 years ago and have not got back to working out with videos until just recently. I am fairly out of shape so I DO work up a good sweat to this. However; when I was in better condition, this whole DVD would have been just a warm-up for me. I used to do the Billy (whats-his-name) Tae Bo workouts. What I am trying to say is this: This is an excellent workout for beginners.

I DO have an extensive background in dance. I have no trouble keeping up with the instructor. But some people would have a hard time; especially if blessed with two left feet. But anyone can get a good workout with this video. If you are not doing EXACTLY what the instructor is, just keep moving. She's mixing steps from several different dance venues anyway.

This is not really an instructional video for dance. But it is a fun and easy to do simple workout routine.

Makes you feel sexy, too!",1230940800,2,265,3.925925925925926
3219130,4,B000WMA6EQ,"I've just previewed the DVD.  The quality of the DVD is quite good except it could be brighter.
PROS:
1)  choices of workout
2)  repetition for viewers to follow
3)  music is upbeat
4)  the instructor is enthusiastic, pleasant and good with her moves
CONS:
1)  the steps are fast for non dancers like myself--could have shown the steps mroe slowly for the first time so viewers can practise before starting with music
2)  only one instructor seemed quite boring--a few more people would be nice
3)  no warm up or cool down before and after quite an intensive workout

Overall I like the DVD and am looking forward to using it in addition to the Leslie Sansone workout DVDs.  This could be more fun and variety than Leslie's but kind of harder for me to follow.  It's worthed a try for people who want a change from regular workouts.",1220832000,2,832,4.48
3219131,4,B000WMA6EQ,"this is a fun dance mix workout.  sometimes its hard to do though also, but found it enjoyable.",1215907200,,95,4.277777777777778
3219132,3,B000WMA6EQ,"I will use this video even though it is less of a workout and more of a dance routine so please don't lose your count because you may become very discourage or better yet land on the floor. Ms. Sandavol seems to be all over the place. Once you get the cha-cha, she is on to the merenque, and the music doesn't help because it is electronic latin music - something you would never hear at the club. Anyway, keep your eyes open.  After I learn these routines, you may see me on one of these dance reality shows.",1215820800,,509,4.141414141414141
3219133,3,B000WMA6EQ,"Pros:
The production values were professional
The music was very good & helped to keep me going
Some of the moves were cute/fun
This will get your heart rate up some of the time & moves your feet a lot
Stella does break down the moves since there is no separate area to learn the dances.

Cons:
Stella is a stiff dancer & uninspiring to watch
Stella isn't into the moment of dancing which killed me
Stella doesn't break down the subtle part of the moves that give them the finished/hot/cool look
Stella's cues are late & I noticed I follow by watching because of it
The dance moves got very repetitive, especially the easier to execute ones
Too many of the dances were modified or some done at a slower pace

3219134,5,B000WMA6EQ,"This dance video is a great workout for those who love to dance (and those who don't have a dance background, but want to have fun while burning calories).

I've used this video and I've also recommended it to my clients who want to do extra cardio work at home. They find it fun, easy to follow and love how warn and sincere Stella comes across. She is very ecouraging and inspirational.

Stella does a great job modifying these steps.  She make it's a workout that anyone can do. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to have fun, learn dance steps and sweat.",1211414400,6,567,4.380952380952381
3219135,3,B000WMA6EQ,"The host is great, but the speed is way too fast. She doesn't take enough time explaining how to step into all the moves. She says all the right things, but once again, everything is fast. It's hard to learn all the dance moves at the rapid pace!",1208131200,,246,4.145833333333333

8223927,3,B000WMA6EQ,"this workout is okay. the instructions are not clear, and it is very fast paced, not good for a beginner. She moves from one step to the other without giving you time to really grasp the move.  The chapters are all over the place too.. during the salsa chapter she starts mentioning merengue moves... a chapter later on in the disc. Also, the background music is blah, and not really Latin/Hispanic rhythm I expected. Overall, an okay workout, I am sure it will be better once I've done it a few times.",1527120000,,502,4.456521739130435

8223932,2,B000WMA6EQ,Eh. The ten minute segments are boring and blah. The woman has a price tag stuck to the bottom of her foot for one entire segment - can you say low budget!
