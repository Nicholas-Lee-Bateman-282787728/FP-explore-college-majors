8708920,5,B00V111JIY,"Little Sister (Zusje) is almost entirely shot with a small camcorder attached to the hand of Martijn (Romijn Conen), a twenty- or thirty-something Dutch man who, after having lived abroad in England for the majority of his adult life, has returned to the Netherlands to visit his younger sister, Daantje (Kim van Kooten).  When he is questioned and ridiculed for his earnest obsession with the camera by Daantje and her friends, Martijn purports to only be interested in capturing moments of his estranged sisters life.  But his real motivation that emerges over the course of the film might be even more unsettling. Granted, Martijn does have a peculiar attraction to his sister, but he does not film only for his own voyeuristic delight. Martijn returns to the Netherlands for closure, to rectify a childhood traumaat least that is what Martijn would like for himself (and for us) to believe.

What is so remarkable about Little Sister is not only the potency of Kim van Kootens first performance and the fact that it was made by students, but most of all (and, in part, because of those factors) the relative lack of attention it has gotten outside the Netherlands, where it won the Golden Calf for Best Feature in 1995. Finally released in the United States on DVD by Facets, Little Sister is a film youd probably want to see, and, once youve seen it, will be a film youll definitely want to see again.",1435622400,,1406,4.754098360655738
