8017432,2,B0001WTWE2,"Yugoslavia is in the white slave market luring Poles to work as slave labor in exchange for passage to America, where they eventually go, only to work as slave labor also. The plot involves an exiled director and an actor from his film.

The plot was poorly developed. It incorporated badly written narration that was read poorly. The film had a weird strip joint scene which made me chuckle. Two men talk, argue then fight. One man is hitting another in the stomach. A stripper gets off stage and hits the attacker over the head with a whiskey bottle.  Soon they are all back to where they were before as if nothing happened.

The film is best known for the nudity (Julie Baltee, Lisa Boyle, Karen Stone-thank you) and would be the only reason to watch it.

F-bomb and attempted rape.",1416528000,,785,4.546099290780142
