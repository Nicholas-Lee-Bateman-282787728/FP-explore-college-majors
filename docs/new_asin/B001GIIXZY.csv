8305607,5,B001GIIXZY,What another amazing DVD. Just when I think they can not Out do them self's they do it again! What great Idea's they never end! IT is just so amazing to see and to have REAL kids in the DVD is a great help. I soo think ALL teachers NEED to see this.. I plan on taking it to my son's teacher and ask her to see it before he comes to class in Jan! IT is the most amazing DVD. It helps ME to understand soo much more. I was not taught soo much of this in my son's OT he got. THIS is my own Personal OT anytime IN my house. and My Son Josh watched it with me HE is almost 3. HE loved to see the kids get squeezes and he did some himself! WOW. So many great PLAY Idea's and things to remind me to talk to teachers about. What a great Going to school each year tool! This will soo HELP YOU TOO I am sure! I have watched the DVD so many times and I am worried I will wear it out! This is a MUST have!!!,1226793600,2,895,3.618556701030928
