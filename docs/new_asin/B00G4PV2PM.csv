The depth is incredible.  You close your eyes and you know when the horns are playing and they are to your front left but more towards the front.  The strings, to my right.  The kettles boom like they are front and center in my living room.  It's magical.

Do yourself a favor and buy this disc.  I promise you'll find a couple of tracks that you'l want to listen to over and over again.  Also, for background music when napping....incredible.",1417046400,,555,4.571428571428571
