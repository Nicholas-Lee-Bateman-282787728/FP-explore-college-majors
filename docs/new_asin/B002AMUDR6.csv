""Mike and Shawn are two nobodies that feel that their existence should at least be acknowledged. The two subjects relate the first few times they were ignored by their favorite celebrity through retellings and reenactments. This segues into their current plan of action to hunt him down and ignore him first - a plan they have obviously not thought through and has affected their everyday lives.

In addition to this the action follows Mike and Shawn as a not-so-helpful psychiatrist, Dr. Newton, tries to help them cope with their obsession and convince them that their problem is only in their heads - and the only solution is to follow his outlandish treatment methods to the bottom of his shot glass. ""

This is a quirky, funny independent mockumentary. It's a quick watch and it has a lot of silly stuff in it but you can tell that it's ultra low budget. It's good to support independent filmmakers - you never know what you're going to come across!

I will say that all of the scenes involving Dr. Newton are comedy gold and are funny to watch over and over - not to mention the great bonus features with his bloopers!",1243728000,3,1158,4.579710144927536
