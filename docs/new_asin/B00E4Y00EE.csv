It's very suspenseful to see how they DEA follow the some of mules before they arrive at the airports. In some other cases, they caught other mules at the airport security checkpoints.

It's puzzling to see many mules get caught red handed and yet they keep doing it. Their excuses are always the same: They need the money to support their families. It's emotionally charging to see a young Italian traveler get caught carrying cocaine in his jacket. Then he breaks down crying because he's going to jail for at least 3 years in Columbia.

This is the first time I heard about liquid cocaine. It's amazing to hear National geographics claims Columbia exports about 450 tons of cocaine to North America per year. I did not know the demand is that large. No wonder they say where there's the demand there's the supply. What I don't understand is people know it deadly but they keep using it!

This document should be shown to students in high schools and universities so that they can learn the grave consequences of dealing with drugs.",1429660800,,1181,4.663461538461538
