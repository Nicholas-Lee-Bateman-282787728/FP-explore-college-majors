4444909,5,B004Q2VAF2,This is perfect when you want or need to exercise at home.  You can do as much or as little as you feel you need.  It is very easy to follow and really filled in the gap for me.  There are days when you can't go walking or go to the gym and I just pop this in my DVD player.  It could not be easier.,1357516800,10,299,3.484848484848485
4444910,5,B004Q2VAF2,"My husband was diagnosed with Parkinson's (from Agent Orange in Viet Nam).  This video is great because it uses people who are genuine--not actors.  If they are actors, they sure look real.  My husband likes this because he can do it on his own and he feels like he is accomplishing something.  People can do as much or as little as they want.  There is also a book available, but it's not necessary for the DVD.

I think the name is a little misleading.  You probably won't really delay Parkinson's, but you'll be helping your body.  And who knows?  Maybe you really will delay some of the symptoms!",1354320000,20,600,4.481481481481482
4444911,5,B004Q2VAF2,"This video is an absolute MUST for anyone struggling with Parkinson's. Although the title is to delay the disease, I am convinced that following Zid's formula can reverse aspects of Parkinson's dysfunction. The underlying truth is that the harder the exercise the easier life becomes. This is a truth that I have experienced in action. Zid presents a comprehensive approach with about ten different areas of movement function and exercises specific to those functions. The information is invaluable, the presentation excellent, and the underlying philosophy brilliant.",1315094400,58,568,5.616279069767442

4444915,5,B004Q2VAF2,This is a really good instructional DVD.  The quality of the picture is not HD but it is acceptable.  I brought this for my husband to use.  I like that  different Parkinson's symptoms are addressed in the video in different sections that you can easily go directly to.  He encourages you to do the exercises daily and you will see an improvement over symptoms. I would recommend these DVDs.,1461715200,,391,4.608695652173913

4444918,3,B004Q2VAF2,The video was disappointing .  My husband has late stage 3 parkinsons.  I found the video to fast moving.  I feel there should be a modifier for persons with later stages of parkinsons.  I would only recommend this video to stage one users.,1460160000,3,240,4.511627906976744

4444927,5,B004Q2VAF2,"This book presents tried and true tips in dealing with common movement problems that Parkinson's Disease patients experience and specific exercises to strengthen the muscles associated with each movement problem.  These tips and exercises are validated through actual patient experiences.

I have been recently diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease.  I do not currently experience many of the problems addressed in this book, but I can sense that my current condition is deteriorating in a direction that these problems will become real for me in the future.  So, I am using these exercises (and others) to delay any further deterioration.",1436659200,5,636,5.459183673469388

4444932,5,B004Q2VAF2,"My husband was just diagnosed with Parkinson Disease.  It has been hard to accept the PD - my husband is a positive person, but the diagnoses has depressed both of us a bit.  All the information out there on the web is so scary, and everyone cries when we tell them about the PD.  This dvd is a blessing.  David Zid is positive, upbeat, and encouraging.  He shows moves my husband can do that will improve his movement in all different areas of concern including balance, freezing, walking, etc. I am grateful that this dvd is so POSITIVE.  My husband and I want to LIVE, not set around and pity ourselves.  We want to face this challenge together with a positive attitude and do what ever it takes to help stay in control for as long as possible.  Investing an hour a day in exercises that improves mobility is totally doable.  I highly recommend this to anyone suffering for PD or simply from decreased mobility due to aging. THANKS DAVID!!",1419033600,17,942,4.4941176470588236
4444933,5,B004Q2VAF2,"I bought both the DVD and the book for my father who had all of a sudden developed balancing problems which made it difficult for him to walk and left him depressed and despondent. After convincing him to give the DVD a try it was surprising to see what a difference the exercises and pointers made. He is walking much better and even willing to try playing golf again. He took the book to his appt with the neurologist who was familiar with Mr. Zid's book and praised it. When my parents went to a PD support group, they mentioned the book and its effectiveness with the result that the group leader as well as the participants took down the necessary information to order Mr. Zid's materials (commission??). I have also recommended the book/DVD to some friends who have relatives with PD and everyone is grateful for this suggestion, esp. when I tell them how helpful it proved for my father.",1417996800,,894,4.559006211180124

4444936,5,B004Q2VAF2,"Outstanding exercise program specifically for Parkinson's patients.  Zid is up beat, encouraging, and realistic.  The exercises focus on some of the more difficult aspects of Parkinson's (walking, balance, and flexibility) particularly as the disease progresses.  The goal of  helping the patient to maintain independence as long as possible speaks to the importance of these exercises.  For years, neurologist told me that exercise is important, but that was the end of the conversation.  This DVD is a ""must"" for Parkinson's patients.  One of the unstated benefits of the DVD is to instill hope - hope that one can see the next sunrise from one's own back porch.",1412985600,2,664,5.2075471698113205
4444937,5,B004Q2VAF2,"My father has had Parkinson's for over 20 years. The last 2 years he has become severely limited in his activity level. We found an exercise vide for Parkinson's that was very discouraging -- the emphasis was on riding bike, lifting weights, etc. Then we found this one, whose emphasis is being able to turn around, pick up and pass things -- every day life activities. We try to do the first video 5 times a week (some days dad is not strong enough to get through the whole thing and there are a few he can't do and several he can't do well) and it has made a big difference in his activity level. And he looks forward to the sessions.",1411948800,11,636,4.221311475409836

4444939,5,B004Q2VAF2,"Lots of information and explanation to help someone with Parkinson's , but remember each patient is different. My wife will only do the arm exercises so the book has limited use. In other words the effectiveness of the book is due in large part to the patients willingness to cooperate.",1397347200,2,286,4.74

4444942,5,B004Q2VAF2,"Ordered the DVD for my Dad who was diagnosed with Parkinson's in late 2013. The exercises are definitely helping with balance, strength, and overall flexibility but must be done daily to reap the most benefit and see improvement. This DVD is more challenging than the first one and I would recommend that you start with the 1st Delay the Disease DVD if you are not currently exercising or struggling with flexibility.

My husband was very pleased to see exercises which tackle the symptons he has been suffering and not known how to improve his fitness.

8437913,4,B004Q2VAF2,Wish this actually did the exercises with the person so they could see how to do it as they do the exercise.  Explaining how to do it is great but if the person with Parkinson's is supposed to do 5 or 10 they need to be able to do it with the instructor.
