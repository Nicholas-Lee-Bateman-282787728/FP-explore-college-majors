While at home one night, he hears a noise and discovers someone in the backyard. He goes out to look and ends up injuring him hand and that's where the story starts. When the movie ends,its start again and you figure out the secret of the substitute teacher and why he is so hard on Eric.
If you have seen Idol Hand, this takes a few elements from that.
This movie was made in 2001 and is just now released to DVD. This not a horror movie, but a story about a boy that gets confronted with his past.",1079654400,2,677,4.255813953488372
