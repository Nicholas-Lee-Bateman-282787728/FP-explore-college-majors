7813618,4,630168138X,"I had an uncle that used to bring five or six movies over at a time, mostly action or horror, when I was little. He'd often leave them for a week or so. I think he must have known my brother and I would watch every one of them, even if we had to sneak some of them. This was one of those movies he left, and for years I tried to figure out what movie it was, I was always just stuck with a couple random images in my head, a crazy old coot controlling snakes, someone being lowered to snakes in a chair, and a woman doing a strip tease in a trailer for an older man while the crazy old coot watched through the window. Now that's not much to go on, and I never met anyone who knew what movie I was talking about. After looking on imdb and getting pretty frustrated I wound up compiling a small list of movies that had tons of snakes going after people, which was actually a surprisingly small list. I looked into the movies as best I could, and found that this movie actually has three titles, Fangs being only one of the titles it was produced under. So, to cut to the chase, lol, I finally broke down and spent a ridiculous $25 for an old vhs copy of Holy Wednesday which rocked a picture of a lady screaming in terror and looked really hokey and cheesy, and found to my delight that this was indeed the crazy old snake controlling coot movie I had been searching for. I don't know that it was worth the $, but, as it's kinda rare and unknown, I'm not to let down. The movie itself probably takes a certain sense of humor or appreciation to get thru, I don't think most would like it. Snakey Bender is the main character, and what a character he is. He loves his only companions and family, his snakes. He collects them, nurtures them, and practically worships them. Aside from this kook there's a brother and sister who run the only market and apparently enjoy sharing the same woman, they are fixated currently on the school teacher, who unbeknownst to them has a very weird snake fetish that has her hooking  up in secret with snakey and his favorite snake. I think you'd have to see it to believe it there. The school kids have sort of a competition to bring the best live snake food they can catch to snakey so his pets can eat. Snakeys best friend and apparently the guy he's freeloading a place to live off of is about to marry a stripper half his age, which will interrupt their wednesday night marching band revelries. And now the sheriff wants to give snakey a ticket for driving so badly. A series of events threaten not only snakeys place to live, kills his best snake, takes away his tryst with teacher, but may leave him with no market in which to buy his canned dinners. So snakey devises a plan to get his life back in order the way it was, the way he likes it, and he's gonna take down anyone standing in the way of that. I don't think I'd ever seen anything quite like this movie, and lord knows just what was going thru the minds of the writers and director, but I was actually entertained. This movie isn't really for everyone, and it takes a little bit to get really started, but in the end it won't let you down. If you have an opportunity to watch it, if you find it cheap in a flea market or thrift store, don't pass it up!",1420934400,,3249,4.1900958466453675
7813619,4,630168138X,Better than average snake horror with some comedy thrown in for good measure. Les is at his nutty best as he knocks off his enemies one by one. A must have for snake fans.,1308960000,,171,4.0588235294117645
