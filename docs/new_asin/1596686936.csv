7799830,5,1596686936,"I received my order very promptly. It was in great shape.  I love to paint flowers, and thought I would try some art lessons.  Claudia was an excellent teacher, she went slowly and explained what paints she used and why.  I am very pleased that i bought this DVD!  It comes in 2 disks and is 3 hours long.  She goes thru the entire painting as she paints it.  I learned quite a few little secrets to make the painting more lifelike.  Very much worth the time.  I have wondered how the artists got the effects they accomplished, and she explained it very clearly.  I'm a hands on type of person, I can't really get much from just reading, so watching someone explain the technique helped so much.  I would recommend buying this!",1452384000,,727,4.398496240601504
