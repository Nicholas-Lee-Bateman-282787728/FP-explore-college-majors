8681352,4,B00O1D3AFO,"It's really hard to know how to rate Bill Zebub's stuff that I've seen, which admittedly hasn't been too much. But this one is really tough.

Firstly, this is two full-length features, one ""Science-Less Fiction"" and the other ""Indie Director."" Most of the same cast members are in both.

Young fanboys who think that they're edgy will watch ""Science-Less Fiction"" for the absurd level of racist shock value. Zebub tries to act like all of this was very self-aware and tongue-in-cheek, but I'm not so sure--it seems to come with far too much ease. I'm a white guy and definitely no screaming liberal idiot, but a lot of the dialogue was tough for me to stomach. Most of the production values are pretty terrible and overall, the movie doesn't make a lot of sense. Something about racist aliens dressed as clowns invading the Earth?? He's trying to make some political statements here but I had trouble cutting through the insanity to figure out what all of them are. So, points off for all of this.

The other merits of Zebub's films though are near-constant gratuitous nudity of his (mostly) very attractive female starlets. His women almost always are all-natural, too, which is a huge plus in my book. There are three here who are pretty scorching hot and aren't afraid to be exploited a bit because of it. On these merits, this movie is pretty great.

Zebub also is pretty faithful about providing behind-the-scenes material, so there's a featurette included with cast interviews and that's interesting. Plus for this.

The included second feature ""Indie Director"" actually is better than the main feature, I think. It has all of the requisite nudity (with some incredibly hot women), but the humor--most of it from Zebub as an actor, a lot of it ad-libbed--hits far more often than it misses, unlike ""Science-Less Fiction."" It's about a director's trials and tribulations as he attempts to get movies produced and distributed. Overall I actually found it to be lighthearted and fun. It is loaded down with exposition, though, so the average viewer probably won't enjoy it so much. Just look for the naked women and it will be worth it.",1433548800,14,2139,4.8493150684931505
