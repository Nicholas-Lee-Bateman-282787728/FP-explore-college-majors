7009715,5,B00THH4VAC,"If you like philosophy, religion, the metaphysical ramifications of quantum theory, cosmology, questions about free will, the existence and nature of God, an afterlife, how the world works, or what it all means this is a great series. I watch them on TV, and want a copy to introduce my grandchildren to the big questions when they are old enough. Kuhn interviews some of the greats of physics, philosophy, theology and other fields. He considers many approaches to answering each question. Really good, in my opinion.",1432080000,12,518,5.034883720930233
8701766,5,B00THH4VAC,I was pleased with my purchase but not how long it took to receive but I live 2000 miles off the pacific rim so that might have something to do with it. Overall its a great buy. A person could do worst. Just make sure you have a dvd remote that works otherwise youll only see about 15 minute segments due to not being able to use your remote. I don't have a remote and not sure if I ever will get a remote  but if I do get one I will be able to watch these dvds.,1517529600,,462,3.7142857142857144

8701769,5,B00THH4VAC,"Coming from a 36 year-old lonely depressed slightly ""aspergers syndrome""-gifted independent individual who also happens to be a self-taught Quantum Consciousness Engineer-Theorist I have enjoyed learning how earlier researchers and philosophers have gotten caught up in their careers and so totally(in some cases) missed out on the cosmos, the Earth Life System School for Episodic compressed learning and so on",1483660800,,411,5.866666666666666
8701770,5,B00THH4VAC,"Helps define the problems those who care enough to inquire about Truth as well as proposing some possible perspectives.  The answer to Truth is found in the King James Bible.  There are many bibles being use but only one tell the Truth.  If you have trouble understanding the Truth, tune into Sonlife Broadcasting on TV or by Roku and the internet.  The men who speak there endeavour to explain the Word of God which is what the KJ Bible is.",1472774400,,441,4.475

8701772,4,B00THH4VAC,"It's GREAT that these are finally out! Lawrence Kuhn has done a wonderful job of interviewing scientists, philosophers, theists, atheists, neurobiologists, etc., and packaged them in easy to understand 25 minute packages. He is one of the best interviewers out there. By the time you have watched a few, you are convinced that you are finally...closer to truth! He is an honest broker, not prejudicing his interviews, keeping an open mind. As one of my professors said long ago, ""the function of a University education is to develop a good healthy agnosticism."" Really well done interviews!",1468886400,5,590,5.15625
8701773,5,B00THH4VAC,"For the neophyte a wonderful example of where thought must go. For the mature a wonderful reminder of why we think what we think. For many, a boost into what might might just be over the horizon!",1459123200,2,195,4.297297297297297
8701774,5,B00THH4VAC,"These are the best scientists of today speculating on things that are currently beyond the grasp of science.  Their speculations are compatible with science though & that is what makes their musings so fascinating.  Really mind expanding stuff.  There is some duplication, especially video, from one episode to another, & even within a single episode, but not enough to decrease the value.  Note that this is not science, it is scientifically compatible speculation.",1457481600,,466,5.342465753424658
8701775,4,B00THH4VAC,A great series to exercise your brain.,1441411200,,38,4.571428571428571
