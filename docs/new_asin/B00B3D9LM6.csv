8562095,5,B00B3D9LM6,"Junichi Suzuki, in his Nisei Trilogy:  442 - Live with Honor, Die with Dignity,  MIS - Human Secret Weapon (How Japanese-Americans fought in WWII) and Toyo's Camera (life of Japanese-Americans and Japanese Nationals in Manzanar, through photographs, tells a compelling story of life in these unconstitutional concentration camps.

442 - Live with Honor, Dies with Dignity tells the story of Americans of Japanese descent whose questioned loyalty at the beginning of WWII became unquestioned loyalty in Italy, France, Germany and in the Pacific.  The most decorated combat unit in the history of the US military, these brave men sacrificed everything to bring honor to their families even though their parents were incarcerated in ""relocation"" (AKA as concentration camps) centers.

Every American should know this story of how hysteria, hate and greed can out maneuver constitutional guarantees.
