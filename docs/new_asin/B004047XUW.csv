4237907,4,B004047XUW,"hello
a long time ago win cartoon network showed some anime is the first time I saw Armitage but t was only today that I was actually able t own this series. Let m say the animation and the movies in general have stood the test of time. This dvd includes the original ova, the movies poly matrix and the sequel dual matrix. All have stood up great and look incredible. The set also includes a featurette called assembling Armitage which talks about getting together the movie dual matrix and making it. it also has some of the songs from the movie as well as some trailer but the main draw are the main features.

Let me ay I like the movie more than the OVA. I know poly matrix are just the OVA made into a movie but I like the movie better in my opinion. still both movies re great stories as well as the ova. IF you are an anime fan this should be a part of your collection if this is your first time you might want to start somewhere else and work up to this",1404950400,3,962,4.063157894736842
4237908,5,B004047XUW,"This review is both for the series and this collection.  First off, this collection is perfect.  You get everything, enough said.

Now about the series.  Did you ever losten to the sound of your dial-up and wonder what is on the other side of it?  Did you ever wish that someone you spoke to on a chatroom was actually a sentient program?  Have you wondered when an android becomes indistinguishable from a human?  Watch this series and you will get even more questions.",1404864000,,470,4.590361445783133

4237910,5,B004047XUW,"This is a bit different than earlier releases of the Armitage as it includes BOTH the ORIGINAL four episode Japanese release, the Poly-Matrix subbed English movie made from the original Japanese series but has a completely different ending to the Japanese original, and Dual-Matrix where Armitage and Ross are living under assumed names with a daughter! Having all three parts to the Armitage Saga in one small disc case makes it perfect for me.",1375228800,7,445,5.027027027027027
4237911,5,B004047XUW,I was listing to music awhile back and I heard on of the songs from this show.  I have not seen it since high school.  Instant nostalgia !!,1374019200,,139,3.9285714285714284
4237912,5,B004047XUW,"I grew up with the original Armitage OVAs, and I was in the market to repurchase them anyway, but when I saw this box set, I had to pounce. It's a silly thing to care about, maybe, but the packaging on this baby is nice stuff. Got to love the whole ""pulp sci-fi magazine"" styling - really brought me back to the good ol' 90s when I was first experiencing this show, which is pretty much what you want a repackage of a classic to do. And it's a box you'd be proud to stash on your shelf, which, much as I like the original OVAs' rather garish packaging, is not something that can be said of them.

Despite the outward presentation, however, do note that this is actually a pretty bare-bones release. You're getting what it says - the complete collection, four OVAs, two movies - and not much else. The menus are as basic as it gets, and the extras are minimal: a ""making of"" featurette for Dual-Matrix, arguably the least interesting of the series, and a handful of tracks from the OST (three, to be exact) in 5.1 sound. And that's it. Which is fine - the important stuff's all present and correct. Just don't go expecting anything fancy.

Oh, and if you were misled by the box into thinking there's an actual article in there - as far as I can tell, there isn't. It's just part of the fake sci-fi mag styling. Which is kind of a shame, because this series could have really done with some interesting deconstructy liner notes a la Noir.

But in the end, this is a well-priced collection of a 90s cyberpunk classic, and well worth picking up.",1356220800,11,1541,4.34375
4237913,4,B004047XUW,"I loved both movies, unlike most other reviewers I actually prefer the duel matrix sequel, except with a couple issues. Then main thing I hated was that it is only available in full screen and not widescreen like poly matrix. That wasn't so bad on my old full screen tv but now watching it on an HD tv it does matter. I usually never buy anything that isn't widescreen because you miss a lot of the picture. The only other thing that was very annoying was the lighting during the final battle on the skylift with the two armitage copies. It was so dark during most of the sequence that you can't see anything. Yeah I know it is supposed to be a night scene but it still should have been done differently. Otherwise I loved both films. Everyone has their own opinions and they are free to disagree.",1354665600,2,797,4.355704697986577
4237914,3,B004047XUW,"Armitage III - The OVAs

The original Armitage III OVA integrates its sci-fi themes into a 1980's - 1990's Hollywood detective story, with violent shootouts likely inspired by John Woo, and a plot driven by political intrigue and corporate greed. Our protagonist, police officer Naomi Armitage, is working with Ross Sylibus, a cop from Earth who recently requested a transfer to the Martian Police Department. As soon as Ross steps onto Martian soil to meet Armitage all hell breaks loose, as a madman assassinates a famous singer and Armitage fails to apprehend the suspect. To everyone's surprise, the singer was an illegally manufactured Third Series robot, a model indistinguishable from natural born humans. The runaway murderer has taken it upon himself to eliminate all Thirds from Martian society, a sentiment much of the robot hating populace supports.

As for production values, it was a mixed bag. The background art in most pre-digital animations is spectacular, and Armitage III is no different. The setting mimics generic future cities in movies like Blade Runner, a conflagration of neon guiding society's refuse towards strip clubs and bars, and corporate structures in the city proper dotted with lights that never go out, symbols of the relentless capitalist machine. Armitage III even has cities that seem to float above one another - upside down! The animation for the characters is okay, but not always appealing. I'm not sure of what to think of Armitage's techno-prostitute costume, other than maybe Motoko Kusanagi shopped at the same store when considering what to wear in Stand Alone Complex.

If the show's mise-en-scene doesn't let you know you're watching animation from the 90's, the music sure will. The introductory mash-up of synthesized bass and music video montage at the beginning of each OVA is a nostalgic throwback for Generation Y children. It's also the most memorable song in the series, out of a total of four or five themes. The soundtrack is all synth and reminds us that in the future only electronic music will remain, with music producers depending on R2D2 and Transformer noises to make their profits. It's happening at this very minute. Ever heard of dubstep?

In a similar vein, the voice acting for the English dub is questionable. Elizabeth Berkley and Skip Stellrecht do a nice job as Armitage and Ross, respectively. Stellrecht works in anime regularly, most notably as Cowboy Bebop's Vicious and Naruto's Mighty Guy. The Polymatrix film version of Armitage III features Kiefer Sutherland as the voice of Ross, and he does an absolutely terrible job. He's monotone and barely audible. I wouldn't blame anyone for watching Armitage III subbed.

Armitage III - Dual Matrix

I'll start with the good news. The animation in Dual Matrix (2002), a film made seven years after its preceding OVA Armitage III (1995), looks amazing. The animation is clearly influenced by advances in computer technology, especially in choosing to design CG vehicles. Speaking from ten years into the future, of course it's silly of me to say 2002's animation can compare to 2012's insanely vivid colors and shiny characters, but it still ages very well. The quirks originally in Armitage III (which included clothing designs vanishing when characters moved; angular and awkward facial expressions, and even Armitage's peculiar costume choice) have been ironed out into a beautiful production. Dual Matrix is glossy and its environment, while a far cry from the Blade Runner grittiness of the original, has been illustrated in painstaking detail. The biggest visual eyesore involves a CG helicopter crashing into a row of windows, a horrendous but brief display of CG gone awry.

Unfortunately, that's where the good news ends. The cyberpunk themes present in the first film are all but gone: a story about cyborgs does not automatically qualify as a 'cyberpunk' story. The machinations of a shady robot development corporation, run by a Mr. Demetrio Mardini, are simply an awful rehash of the Armitage III struggle. Demitrio is trying to recreate the Thirds experiment and design robots that can procreate. He wants to make a slave workforce for his company, instead of paying robots real wages and allowing them to form unions through the inevitable passing of a Robot Rights bill.

I'd rather not belabor the point: this was a dull sequel that did not need to be made. The funky music from Armitage III has been replaced by a recurring female vocal track accompanied by a sinister synthetic double bass; the song lacks lyrics and does nothing but add an ominous atmosphere to the film. There's a little D&B that plays during one car chase, but that's as 1990's as the film gets. Forty-five minutes into the film, the narrative comes to a standstill and the rest of the movie is one long emergency rescue/escape attempt. After Ross and Naomi get their daughter, they are chased by two mute Armitage clones designed by Demetrio. The fight scenes are impossibly dim, so appreciating the combat isn't possible. Just... I don't know, man. I'm disappointed.

4237915,5,B004047XUW,"Armitage III is probably the greatest indie anime series out there. Including the original OVAs, the mashed up version, as well as the two movies. The soundtrack is probably one of the best as well, if not too short. :-(",1347926400,,220,4.525
4237916,2,B004047XUW,"I know I am reviewing this before the actual collection comes out. I went to Anime Expo this year and Funimation released several of their animes early for the event only. One of them was Armitage Movie Collection.

I have been a long time fan of the Armitage series. So it felt like a no brainer to finally re buy the set in one collection. However as I got home from AX to popped the discs in I felt like I may have made a wrong choice. From the outside it looks like everything you ever wanted. The OVA series and the two movies complete in one page. And yet little care went into making this the most definitive collection. Actually no care went into it.

The Video-
Nothing was restored from the original dvd release run by Geoneon. Which I find to be a total shame. Dual Matrix still looks fine but the Armitage OVAs and Poly-Matrix could have been touched up a bit. I didn't notice any glaring errors in the video which is nice but overall it just seemed lazy.

The Audio-
Guess what? It wasn't fixed up either. Poly-Matrix and Dual Matrix are the only ones with 5.1 surround sound option. Because it had one when the original discs were made. Again the OVAs got screwed over and given no upgrade. Which is quiet annoying when your trying to watch it with your surround sound system and the whole thing is quiet. Again I maybe not the biggest upset but if your going to re-release it you could do better. Also for better or worse they kept the original audio for each disc. This in my option was a stupid move. Yes you would have gotten quiet a bit of fans getting upset but at least new comers wouldn't feel so alienated with the voice work. See for those who don't know each disc and completely different actors. Which this wasn't a huge issue when the releases were so spread out in years that you sort of forget. Watching each disc one after another doesn't feel right. I think it would have made much more sense to just go a re-dub. It would also help with some of the extremely hammy acting in the series. The OVA wouldn't have felt so dated. Also don't listen to the 'featuring the voices of' I feel like this is used to trick new comers into thinking that Kiefer Sutherland and others are used in the entire set. That is a lie. Mr. Sutherland is only used in Poly-Matrix and Juliette Lewis in Dual Matrix only.

The Presentation/Extras-
This is probably the worst part of this collection and what made me sort of wish I bought another anime there. One the outside it looks really nice. It just screams Cyberpunk style. Then you open it up and the inside of the dvd case is a mini-poster design. Then you notice the discs look all the same with the only difference being the disc number and in small print the titles. And once you put the discs in you see just how lazy they were with getting this product out. Every disc has the same extremely boring menu with the most minimum amount of options they needed. Its so bad you almost couldn't tell what disc you put it. No different in the background music (which if I remember only Poly and the OVAs shared similar music) and it's the same song in all the different menu choices. Which by the way gets really annoying. But the greatest insult is the extras. There are two in the whole package which I find insulting. Wait there are three if you are to believe that Funimation thinks 'trailers' are considered extras. You get a feature called Assembling Armitage and a music player that plays select songs from the series. Again these are throwaway features and Funimation could have done a much better job.

Verdict-
In the end it is neither great nor the worst thing ever. Its that 'in the middle' I hate seeing in anime re-releases. Funimation literally put zero effort into pumping this out. Which I feel is a kick in the face to what they call 'Anime Classics'. If you loved everything about the originals you probably won't mind buying this. But I think that asking price for this is just to much for how little work they did. Armitage is a classic and it deserves better then this. It makes more sense to just skip this and buy some used copies of the original run discs. At least there was better effort put into those and some even have extras that aren't just trailers.",1342483200,8,4241,4.397452229299363

However, I never realized just how awful this anime was. I use to watch it when I was a teen and Syfy would show anime movies. I got nostalgic one day and bought it, only to be wholly dissatisfied with the story. I was very embarrassed for my teenage self for loving it and at my adult self for buying it.
