8280012,4,B001AX60VE,"DOLL FACE was derived from a story entitled ""The Naked Genius"" written by burlesque legend Gypsy Rose Lee (aka Louise Hovick). Vivian Blaine stars as stripper Doll Face Carroll, whose ghostwritten autobiography ""Genius De Milo"" becomes the catalyst for her talents to shine on Broadway. Along the way there's a rivalry between the two men in the Doll's lovelife (Dennis O'Keefe and Stephen Dunne); and some fun musical numbers with Carmen Miranda (""Chico Chico"") and Perry Como (""Here Comes Heaven Again"", and his classic ""Dig You Later (A-Hubba Hubba Hubba)"").  This was one of Carmen's lesser vehicles, filmed in stark black-and-white; yet it's one of the most delightful musicals of the whole era.

This DVD presents the movie in an over-scanned widescreen version.  Some cropping is evident.  I really don't understand why we need classic 1:33 ""academy ratio"" movies in widescreen at all, but I suppose it's good to have the choice.  Quality is still grainy Public Domain standard.  For the same price you can get the official Fox release -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doll-Face/dp/B00158K1A0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doll Face</a>.",1287878400,,1185,5.742857142857143
