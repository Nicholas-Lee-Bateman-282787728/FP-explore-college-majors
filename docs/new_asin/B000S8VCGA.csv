This video is nice for women of all pilates abilities. I find the excercises and stretches very helpful. The one drawback I've found is that the workout is 30 minutes long. If you have the time (and energy), it's worth it. Also, there is a lot of intoduction material that gets old after awhile. So, I'm finding myself in the market for a new workout video with a little more flexibility timewise, as well as for when I just don't feel like doing an entire 30 minute workout. I will keep using this one for when I feel the urge to do a full blown workout.",1224633600,6,755,5.517241379310345
2883674,4,B000S8VCGA,"The video case says that this is a workout for women in the 2nd trimester.  I just purchased it when I was in month 5 and just did the workout for the first time here in month 6.  You will need one of the birthing balls and a stretch band (and maybe a towel to kneel on).  The entire DVD is about 45 minutes long but the workout is 30 minutes.  The other stuff on the DVD include a ""workout principles"" which outlines the basics for us non-expert pilates people and a ""5 minute bonus"" workout that is a little more intense.

Let me begin by saying that I am not a big workout/pilates person. Sad to say, I don't exercise as much as I know I should. I've never done any pilates stuff, but I have heard so many pregnant women talk about the birthing ball that I thought I should try one. I'm willing to give anything a shot that might make delivery day easier.  I watched the entire workout first a few days ago without doing any of it so that I'd know what I needed.  I just did the workout this morning for the first time. It was pretty easy to follow since I had watched it before. There were a few times that I had to rewind because I missed what the instructor was saying or she went too fast through an exercise.  I imagine that will get better as I do it more often. There is a nice variety of exercises, and I definitely felt challenged but not too overwhelmed. The difficulty level is low, so a pilates ball guru would probably be bored. For a novice like me, it was the right speed.

I am going to continue using the video as long as my big belly will let me.  At some point, I may need to skip over some of the exercises if I'm too big.",1213747200,10,1645,4.049382716049383
8204761,3,B000S8VCGA,"This workout wasn't as much fun as I thought it would be. The smallest problem I had was I had the wrong type of bands. The bigger problem was the instructor on the DVD. Her instructions are quickly spoken with "" take a breathe in"" randomly thrown in between. I'm not a work out pro but I do exercise two to three times a week with various at home programs. The biggest improvement this work out needs is an instructor that instructs more clearly and slowly. Breathing is an important part of working out, knowing when to inhale and exhale with each movement is very important and unclear with this workout.",1376784000,,607,4.4774774774774775
8204762,5,B000S8VCGA,"I bought it because I don't have time to go to the gym... EVER... I have 2 and a 3.5 year old kids and we are expecting out 3 one...
I have done pilates it the past and it helped so much with my back problems! So I thought I would give it a try... I started it when I was 27 weeks pregnant and I did great. It also helped with cramps in my ""restless"" legs! I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for easy way to keep in shape. Not very challenging.",1370044800,,460,3.8020833333333335
8204763,3,B000S8VCGA,"To someone who is used to more intense workouts (pre-pregnancy), this will seem like a very easy video. Some stretches don't feel like they're doing much, but there are some moves that feel really nice. I have to say, when the video ended I was left with the feeling ""Is that all?"" Definitely one to use on days when I don't really feel like a real workout.",1319932800,,357,4.343283582089552
8204764,4,B000S8VCGA,"I enjoy this workout. It is very easy and great for beginners. I myself am not much of a fitness buff, but I do try to get in 30 minutes of exercise 4-5 a week (usually on my recumbent bike). I use this video as a warm up then I go through Denise Austin's Fit & Firm Pregnancy. Both mild workouts leave me feeling refreshed and energized. Watching both videos takes about 45 minutes. I would recommend them both. This video is especially nice, the instructor sticks to only explaining the exercises without unneccesary chit chat, I have to mute the Denise Austin video, she is a little too enthusiastic for me.",1304380800,,610,4.455357142857143
8204765,5,B000S8VCGA,"I am in my 2nd trimester and started using Stott Prenatal Pilates on the Mat dvd and I think it's great.  I usually work out 2-3 times a week and do many different types of workouts from spin class, bikram's yoga, free weights, to kick boxing.  I am not super buff or anything, but eat pretty well and like a good workout.  Having suffered a miscarriage last year, my doc told me to take it easy my first trimester and do light exercising if I wanted to the rest of my pregnancy.  I did not exercise during the first trimester so I've been very anxious to start doing something..anything!

What I love about this dvd is that it is 30 minutes, so you get a full workout in a short amount of time.  Plus, all you really need is a floor to do the exercises on.  This workout definitely wasn't hard for me, but then again I'm just looking for something light to keep my body moving.  I would highly suggest it for anyone looking for a good prenatal exercise.",1304380800,,954,4.261111111111111
8204766,3,B000S8VCGA,I was really expecting a good workout after reading some of the reviews but this is not much of a workout at all.,1268092800,,113,3.9565217391304346
8204767,2,B000S8VCGA,"This dvd is just ok for me, I prefer the instructor to be pregnant. Its a bit boring, and for some reason after I finish it, my back hurts, which I have never had happen to me with the 10min prenatal pilates dvd. My opinion is to get the 10min solutions and skip this one which costs more",1266624000,,288,3.9827586206896552
8204768,5,B000S8VCGA,"Pilates works the perfect muscle groups for labor and post-natal health, especially if you pair it with your Kegels.  I used to be certified to teach Pilates, and have learned Stott is known for staying mostly true to the technique Joseph Pilates intended.  Some of the other more popular Pilates DVDs do not take the time to teach correct fundamentals, which are CRITICAL to receiving the full benefits of the exercises.  I recommend this DVD over several others, especially for those not certified in a fitness/athletics field.

The program in this video also adheres to my OB's guidelines such as never lying on my back, and always using the correct muscles to support my abdomen in certain positions.  I started doing this video at about 28 weeks after being only moderately active my whole second trimester, and I'm doing fine with it.  I don't do it every day, but I could with no issues.

When you try Pilates, take it slowly.  Even though you may not feel it immediately, you will work your muscles MORE this way.  This video allows you to do just that.",1239148800,13,1061,4.691891891891892
8204769,4,B000S8VCGA,"This is a low intensity workout and would be good for beginners. You use a stability ball and a resistance band. It is a Pilate's workout, so there is no cardio. The workout is 30 minutes, and some of the exercises are kind of boring. I use this DVD when I am not very motivated, but know I need to workout. I am now 24 weeks and will continue using it. I like the 10 Minute Solution Prenatal Pilates DVD better because there is more of a variety, I can target specific areas and it is a little more fun.",1238025600,2,504,4.05
8204770,5,B000S8VCGA,"THIS IS DEFINITELY LOW ON THE INTENSITY LEVEL.  WHEN I AM FINISHED I FEEL OPEN AND RELAXED.  I SWITCH THIS ONE WITH YOGA JOURNAL'S SHIVA REA PRENATAL VIDEO, IT IS MORE INTENSE AND BUTT - KICKING.  IF YOU ARE ATHLETIC AND WORK OUT ALOT (WHICH IS DEFINITELY NOT ME) YOU WOULD NOT LIKE THIS.  IT DOES CALL FOR THE EXCERSIZE BALL AND FLEX BAND. FOR THE FLEX BAND I JUST USE AN OLD PAIR OF TIGHTS ;).",1233014400,4,395,4.090909090909091
