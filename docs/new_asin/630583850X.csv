7896015,2,630583850X,"This DVD is recommended with reservation.  Musically, it's excellent.  The modern-instrument orchestra plays in baroque style, and the sound is crystal-clear.  I might quibble that just a few times the phrases seem to be rushed where one might expect a slight pause, and some of the da capo sections seem to be cut down in an odd way.

The scenery is a mixed bag.  Views of the countryside, or of castles whose appearance could pass for 1720, are most thrilling.  But when the castle has a modern delivery van parked in front, the effect is destroyed.  It's even more disconcerting to switch to modern London traffic scenes, or a river voyage past factory smokestacks with jet contrails in the background.  And I would humbly submit, castle interiors done in 20th century art deco have no place in a set like this.

The biggest problem however is that of non-musician sound engineers.  In many if not most tracks the sound is abruptly turned off as soon as the orchestra stops playing, not letting the sound reverberate and die away naturally.  Even more jarring is when they start a track a split second AFTER the orchestra has started.  This is not an isolated incident--it happens several times.

If it weren't for these issues the DVD would be most enjoyable.",1376524800,,1263,4.764976958525345
