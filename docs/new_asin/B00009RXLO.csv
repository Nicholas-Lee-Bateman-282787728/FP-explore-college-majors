1889584,5,B00009RXLO,"I had a blast using this video, something I truly did not think I would with the lack of energy I have due to the lack of sleep....but, Leisa is so positive and uplifting, i really feel like her Prenatal video helped me immensely during labor and think that by incorporating her fitness videos into my daily routine i will have more energy than i did after my first two kids. I love her style and really enjoyed the ""Funky Cardio"" routine, it was perfect and not too bouncy. SHe leads you throught several post-labor specific routines that are fun, safe, and enjoyeable, I highly recommend this workout.",1062633600,,603,4.592592592592593
1889585,5,B00009RXLO,"Leisa Hart is superb in this video, her timing and pace is just what my giggly body needs. I have her FitMama & Me baby video also love both of these, she does a funky type dance routine that was fun and easy to learn and toned you with some pilates or yoga type moves, they were great! I usually don't toat someone who looks so good and makes it look so easy because I feel jealous, but this women is so positive and beautiful she is inspiring. i love her videos.",1061164800,,464,4.054347826086956
1889586,5,B00009RXLO,"I really loved Leisa Hart's FitMama Prenatal video, and when I had my baby and was able to start exercising to her new FitMama Postnatal video, I was very thrilled to see that the funky cardio was easy to follow and challenging for me. I was in good shape before I got pregnant, and I think this video would help anyone shed some baby pounds. She is uplifting and positive and gives great motivating advice on how to get the body back that we want. The toning was good and precise. I also got her FitMama & Me video where you use the baby to tone and workout, and oh my, do you ever feel it. The baby is great resistance and really starts to make you feel toned. I loved both workouts and highly recommend them to anyone who just had a baby.",1058745600,3,741,4.152777777777778
1889619,4,B00009RXLO,"I liked this workout video because it does a good job of easing the body back into exercise.  Leisa is a fun and good instructor and I didn't get tired of working out to this even after working out to it 3 times a week for 4 weeks.  It is too easy once your body is back into shape, but it was fabulous at the begining.",1174348800,,319,3.8181818181818183
1889620,5,B00009RXLO,"i loved Fitmama Prenatal, and this Postnatal dvd is just what i needed, something easy and fun and not over the top...leisa hart was sooooooo good in the prenatal dvd, and she is just as good in this, i love her delivery and execution of her moves, a very good dvd to have after the baby, get started now moms, it is sooo worth it, a great dvd!",1152144000,5,344,4.073529411764706
1889621,5,B00009RXLO,"i loved the fitmama prenatal dvd that my doctor recommended i try, and i love the postnatal...the moves are short, fun and effectively getting me back into shape..i don't much time, so i can split up this dvd and do what i can in the morning or during nap time, it has great streching and great toning, a little bit of everything, all that i need for now...a great dvd!",1148515200,3,369,4.285714285714286
1889622,5,B00009RXLO,"I loved Leisa Hart's FitMama prenatal workout, so I went ahead and bought this DVD while I was still pregnant. It comes with a ""Coming Home"" workout that breaks you very gently into working out again, and then the ""regular"" workout is great for when you're ready to start more than just a gentle breaking in. I didn't do the ""Coming Home"" workout for very long with my son, and didn't bother with it at all with my daughter, but then, I didn't start until she was three months old. With the regular workout, what I like about it is the way it's broken up into segments, in case you want to do it in shorter bursts or just parts of it, or you can do it all together (which is generally what I choose).

If you did the FitMama workout, this one is extremely easy to follow as several of the moves are similar. However, even if you didn't do the FitMama workout, I still think this one would be easy to follow as the moves aren't overly complicated and Leisa does a very good job of demonstrating and explaining the moves. She also shows variations of the moves that some people may find harder.

I don't like this workout quite as much as the FitMama workout, but I think that's simply because after awhile, I outgrew the aerobics parts of it and got a bit tired of it, even with the variations to make it more difficult. It's definitely a wonderful transition DVD to start with after having the baby though - it's a great way to start exercising again and makes a wonderful stepping stone towards other workouts. And even despite feeling like I've outgrown the aerobics part, I find the pilates and yoga segments to still be good. So at least for me, I'm only very slowly outgrowing it.

The seperate FitMama and Me workout is also definitely interesting, though you need more space for it than you do the regular workout portions as it involves using your stroller and some fairly large movements when you take the stroller into account. I like the idea of involving your child in your workout, and my son got a real kick out of it.

This workout won't last you for forever, but then, I don't think it's really designed to either. Leisa Hart is also a very enjoyable and easy to follow instructor. It's definitely great for getting back into the swing of exercising after the baby is born, and the variations are good if you can't immediate start doing the harder moves.",1146700800,13,2370,4.441379310344828
1889623,5,B00009RXLO,"i don't have much time to get back into really great shape, i have my 20 year high school reunion coming up, and so this workout was perfect for me, short and sweet and effective moves that i felt right away. leisa hart was tremenedous in her buns of steel videos in the 90's and i love her fitmama dvds, this is great to do to then advance into other videos...i lost some weight, got encourage, and felt ready to do her sexy series videos(which are the bomb, i love them soooo much). this is a great dvd to have to do after having your baby and then aadvancing to other videos, you'll love that you did this before wasting time doing too advanced of workouts(i made that mistake with my first two babies). this is a great dvd!!!",1138320000,12,729,4.251798561151079
1889624,3,B00009RXLO,"I have used this workout a few times but I dislike the yoga and stretch portions mainly because, although she says ""the yogaball is optional,"" she uses it almost the entire time and does not demonstrate other options. She says you can use a pillow but it was NOT a suitable replacement for me in the various positions she uses! I thought the aerobic portions were fun and I could easily increase the difficulty, which is important for the postnatal changes! It was easy to catch on to her moves if you are used to an aerobic or dance class.",1133481600,8,540,4.41
1889625,5,B00009RXLO,"after having my baby, i was lazy, tired, and uninspired to do anything; BUT, having do this video for a few weeks i was really happy i had started; one, it introduced me to a great instructor who i have started using more of her videos, but at the time, it got me interested in getting into better shape to help be a better mom, which i feel it did 100%; this is a MUST HAVE pregnacny video",1129248000,4,390,4.012820512820513
1889626,4,B00009RXLO,"I bought this video to help my body recover from my second pregnancy. As a busy mother of two I needed something that I could squeeze into whatever time I can find. The short segments allow you to do what you can, when you can. I figure 10 minutes of exercise is better than no exercise because I doubt I'll get a whole uninterrupted hour for exercise anytime soon.

The best part of this video is the mama & me special feature. It's so great to feel like you are doing something for yourself and your baby at the same time. I wish there was a video with several different workouts like this! I would caution you to avoid doing this in front of your two year old new siblings. My son got jealous and I ended up trying to do it with him. 34 pounds of resistance is a little too much!

The other segments are easy to follow- but I don't have the special equipment so I just improvise.",1126742400,6,882,4.152046783625731
1889627,5,B00009RXLO,"After putting on more weight than I should have during my first two pregnancies, I was very lucky to find Leisa Hart's Fitmama Prenatal video and then the Postnatal video, because I was out of shape to start my pregnancy and slowly gained some flexibility during the pregnancy, unlike my first two pregnancies, and I was able to get into decent shape following Leisa's cues. This is a beginner to intermediate level video that gave me great variations. It is an excellent way to get moving, and I have really enjoyed Leisa's other great videos, she is fun and innovative, doing moves that you might see in a specialty class at the gym, but not on video, I really enjoy her style.",1126224000,7,679,4.573770491803279
1889628,5,B00009RXLO,"i knew it would be hard getting back into shape after my baby, BUT with this dvd it was EASY! Leisa Hart is excellent at giving short and simple cues to help you follow her routines, and i absolutely LOVE IT! The choreography is simple and not overly challenging, it is great for a beginner or someone who is in decent shape. I was definitely overwieght and out of shape when i got starte two months after having my baby, i only wish i had done her Fitmama Prenatal video and got started sooner because I was so out of shape after not working out for 3-4 years that it was a struggle to get motivated on my own, but when i started doing leisa's dvd it made me feel capable of getting into shape, slowly but surely. I am in no rush since i took so much time off, but i do feel some results and it is because of the instruction led by leisa hart. I really like her workouts and enjoyed losing my baby weight with this dvd.",1124582400,6,920,4.088397790055248
1889639,1,B00009RXLO,"Very disappointing.  Leisa Hart goes much too fast for anyone to catch on to her moves.  The dance moves she does are much to fast to learn and so is her pace with which she teaches.  She does not set a very relaxing tone to her yoga poses, either-she sounds very rushed and does not teach any of her moves before she performs them.  It is extremely difficult to keep up with her.  Also, I thought there would be more exercises with your baby.  Very disappointing.",1124236800,10,464,4.337209302325581
1889640,5,B00009RXLO,"THIS IS A TOTALLY GREAT COMPLIMENT TO THE FITMAMA PRENATAL VIDEO THAT ALLOWED ME TO DO SO GOOD DURING MY LAST PREGNANCY(I NO HAVE 5 CHILDREN!). I HAVE NEVER BOUNCED BACK THE WAY I DID THIS TIME, I OWE A LOT OF IT TO LEISA HART AND HER EXCELLENT MOTIVATION. SHE IS THE FIRST VIDEO INSTRUCOTR TO KEEP ME INTERESTED ENOUGH TO CONTINUE WORKING OUT, SHE IS TOTALLY GREAT, AND I AM A FITMAMA BECAUSE OF THIS, ITS A GREAT ALL AROUND WORKOUT THAT I GOT INTO A QUICKER RECOVERY AND NOW I AM DOING HER INCREDIBLY FUN SEXY VIDEO, SEXY LEGS AND SEXY ABS, THEY ARER TOTALLY GREAT AS WELL.",1122076800,2,575,4.1891891891891895

1889642,5,B00009RXLO,"After doing Fitmama Prenatal with Leisa Hart, I have become a big fan of hers because of the great ease I had with my pregnancy and delivery and I owe it all to my great motivation I got from her and the workouts in Fitmama. Now, I have enjoyed her Postnatal video, the workouts are short and to the point and I got my bouncing back. I have gained alot of strenght doing this video and am now doing some of Leisa's other great videos and I feel like she is the angel that has saved my body and rekindle my marriage and my husband is glad I am now doing some many of Leisa's workouts, I feel great and look better than ever and it's because of Leisa Hart's strong and sincere encouragement she offers in her workouts.",1107648000,,716,4.158273381294964
1889643,5,B00009RXLO,"my husband laughs at me when he see's me working out to exercise videos, but he is so much so enjoying my firm and tight body that makes him love to call me his little ""fitmama"" after doing Leisa Hart's prenatal and now postnatal videos. I love the way she instructed the three different trimesters in the prenatal fitmama video, and in the postnatal she is always giving cues for women who had different types of deliveries, she is very encouraging and comforting in her delivery of the information, and she never grates on your nerves like some tv people could do. She is very warm and enthusiastic, I love her style of workouts. My body quikcly got back into shape after my third baby, and I feel completely confident that it had everything to do with Leisa's preparation in her prenatal fitmama video and now the fitmama postnatal has allowed me to advance to other great workouts of hers, like the Gym in A Box and her Core Bar videos. I love her style and don't really use other videos, just hers, she is very very special.....i really am glad I found her reviews at this site and others and am very thankful to her for her guidance( and my hubbie is pretty thankful too :-) ) !!!!!!",1103414400,2,1189,4.433789954337899
1889644,5,B00009RXLO,"This workout is great. I had a baby almost 4 months ago, and I started to work out to get rid of the baby weight about a month ago. I bought this and have used it for about 3 weeks, and I have already seen a huge improvement in my overall tone and shape. My abs and lower body are firming up, and my pants are starting to loosen around my waist. Leisa Hart makes everything easy to understand. She explains everything clearly and it doesn't take any time at all to get the hang of the exercises. I love the pilates portion, which is a great challenge after having a c-section. I don't think it's too easy. It's perfectly paced and laid out for those who are out of shape from having a baby.",1101513600,9,690,4.118518518518519
1889645,5,B00009RXLO,"i found this video to be very good, leisa hart is a fit mother and did a great job of getting to the point with her instructions and did some very easy to follow strenght and cardio moves. I wanted to get back into shape slowly, and this video is perfect for me. I LOVED IT!!!",1101254400,5,276,3.9464285714285716
1889646,1,B00009RXLO,I bought this after reading the reviews online and was very disapointed with the video.  There are only a few diferent moves and it is extremely repetitive.  Not very fun at all.  Truthfully I am extremely disapointed with this purchase.  Not a good video.,1098662400,3,256,4.75
1889647,5,B00009RXLO,I also did Leisa Hart's prenatal workout and felt like this was a good sequel.  You get a good workout from the fat burn and the Yoga is good as well.  I like that Leisa has an upbeat attitude without being annoying.  She also gives good level adjustments for those starting out and this allows you to increase your intensity as your strength increases.,1093737600,11,353,4.484375
1889648,5,B00009RXLO,"This is a grea postnatal program. I felt very comfortable doing the moves and my body responded very well, especially after doing the FITMAMA PRENATAL video for my entire pregnancy. I read great reviews of both videos and really loved them, they helped me stay strong and focused. Th FITMAMA POSTNATAL has allowed me to get back into biking shape, and I can enjoy the outdoors and wear some sexy clothing once again, now that i am a Fitmama!!!",1088467200,2,443,4.620253164556962
1889669,5,B00009RXLO,"I did Leisa's prenatal workout throughout my pregnancy and then moved to the postnatal workout after my son was born. I was back in my suits for work by the time my maternity leave ended. I got lots of compliments and I feel great (and sleepy but that is another story).
Leisa is very encouraging. There are different levels in the yoga and pilates portions so you can progress as you feel better. The workout is in short segments which is great for me because my son rarely lets me do the workout at one time. It is nice to do part now part later.
The 'extras' on the DVD are great too. The Mommy and Me is in sections too, my baby doesn't have the attention to do the whole thing at one time. He really likes the lying on my legs for the tummy exercises now. He knew Leisa's voice right away from the Prenatal video!
I also liked the additional workout sections that were part of the extras.",1088035200,8,893,4.228070175438597
1889670,5,B00009RXLO,"i loved doing this workout right after having my baby...as soon as my doctor said i could work out, i popped in this video and quickly found myself dancing to the music and toning up. hart is a great motivator, and she looked great fater having her baby. I love all of her videos and am a new fan, and i bet a life long because her style is better than anyone i have ever tried....i highly suggest you get this vidoe before delivery if you can, otherwise, get it shortly afterwards and get fit...mama!!!",1086825600,2,503,4.3052631578947365
1889671,5,B00009RXLO,"i don't have time to do 45 or 60 minutes of exercise with my newborn, and that's why i LOVE this Fitmama Postnatal workout. If i can only do 10 minutes, i opo this in and feel refreshed. If i can do two or three segments, i feel my body is benefitting from the exercise. I don't feel intimidated by this workout, its definitely designed by a new mom for a new mom...this is GREAT!",1085616000,3,380,4.08
1889672,5,B00009RXLO,"this is a great workout to slowly start getting back into action. I went to the doc and was told I could begin working out five weeks after delivery and i am doing really good three months later, and i owe it all to Leisa Hart. The FitMama Postnatal workout is prefectly paced, Hart is great at telling to watch your body and take it slow, she is precise and fun and motivating. I loved the funcky fat burn, and really felt good after each workout. i am now doing her Gym IN A Box dvd and love it, it is fabulous.....i highly recommend getting the FitMama Postnatal and go at your own pace, itf its not enought, get something else, but i think you'll love this.",1085443200,8,661,4.21259842519685
1889673,2,B00009RXLO,"The idea behind this program is good, and I was really hoping for a good video, but I have to say that I was unfortunately really let down.  The exercises are not very challenging, the instruction is not very clear, and the video itself is extremely short (especially the ""Fitmama & Me"" part, where you actually workout with your baby -- what should get the most time I think).
If you collect exercise tapes, this one can't hurt -- but if you're really looking for an effective post-pregnancy workout, unfortunately this video does not deliver.  I'm putting mine on e-bay and looking for other videos.",1085443200,6,601,4.714285714285714
1889674,5,B00009RXLO,"Leisa Hart did it again!  This has been the pick me up I needed after having my daughter.  As with her prenatal workout video, this one is great.  The moves are so much fun, it's more like dancing than exercising.  I started this workout after my 4 week post natal checkup, and within 1 month I was back in my pre-pregnancy clothes.  I still use it regiously, and it is still working.
My daughter is almost 4 months old, and I am going to start on one of Leisa's newest Fit to the Core videos....I can't wait!!!
It is a wonderful video for the post natal time, I definitely recommend it.",1085356800,2,587,4.252252252252252

Leisa is encouraging and u can tell she knows what she is talking about, she said she's from a family of 10 and loves kids and loves exercising, and her energy really is motivating.

1889718,5,B00009RXLO,"this video is really a great gift idea, i got mine as a gift from a friend and i loved it. the intensity of the workout is great and the instructor gives wonderful safety tips trhoughout the video. she is in good shap just three months after having her second baby and she really seems to know her stuff. i only wish i had gotten the prenatal fitmama video sooner, but i am glad i got it before i delivered as leisa hart gave great tips that helped me thru my first delivery, the workout was great and the moves were easy to learn, i feel fortunate to be getting my pre-baby body back, and soon i will feel like i am a fitmama!!!",1070236800,,629,4.080645161290323
1889719,5,B00009RXLO,"Leisa Hart's passion for fitness and the health of women who have experienced what she has just gone through with the delivery of her second baby is so evident in this postnatal fitmama routine. It is absolutely perfect for me, and should be for just about anyone else. It has great music and great choreography that is easy to follow and fun to do. She is the master at fitness, and her advice for how to handle the first few days after delivery is ideal. My OBGYM previewed this video and recommends it to all of his patients, including his wife who just went thought pregnancy! That is saying alot! I have told all of my friends about the other Leisa Hart videos I have now tried in the 4 months after delivery my baby. She has some great, inexpensive videos(all 3 of the TNT Series, the MBC Yoga series, and her new On the Ball Abs and Fit To The Core series). She is dynamic and a star in themaking, or I guess she's already a star from her Buns of Steel days. MAKE SURE YOU BUY THIS BEFORE YOU DELIVER, THERE ARE GREAT TIPS AND ROUTINES YOU CAN DO PRETTY SOON AFTER DELIVERY, SO DON'T WAIT 6 WEEKS AFTER YOU HAVE YOUR BABY.",1070150400,3,1129,4.255813953488372
1889720,5,B00009RXLO,"it is very advantageous for you get this video before you deliver your baby, as Leisa Hart give great tips for what to do the first few days after delivery. She keeps you fit during pregnancy with FitMama Prenatal, and the FitMama Postnatal is absolutely a must have. I wish they sold these DVD's as a gift set, but anyway, you have to get both of them. THanks Leisa!!!",1068681600,,369,4.36231884057971
1889721,4,B00009RXLO,"Building on the success of the FitMama Prenatal workout, the FitMama Postnatal workout provides new moms with a challenging workout paced to individual levels of recovery.  The workout consists of 2 cardio segments, a yoga segment, a pilates segment, and a stretch and relax segment.
In the introduction, Leisa Hart shows off her four month old baby and then sends him off for a nap to begin the workout.  If your baby takes shorter naps than hers, you have the option of doing only one or two 10 minute segments.  The cardio segments are fun and well-paced for a few months after delivery.  There are many styles of yoga and I'm no expert, but after doing Iyengar style yoga for over a year I'm used to a slower more restful yoga practice which allows me to spend time in each pose.  Her yoga segment seems more like a traditional aerobics strengthening and toning segment to me rather than yoga, but it's still worthwhile.  The rigorous pilates segment uses a yoga ball (one of my few complaints about the program is that although she says the yoga ball is optional, none of the instructors demonstrate the segment without it.)  Throughout the workout she offers modifications for different levels and for C-section and abdominal separation where appropriate, however all new moms should wait until cleared by their doctors to do the workout.
The DVD has some great special features, including:
* Workout to music without narration
* 2 bonus postnatal workouts (Coming Home and Bonus Yoga Ball)
* The entire FitMama and Me workout
Coming Home, the first bonus postnatal workout provides a gentle program that new moms can start doing on the first day post-partum, even while still in bed.  The program builds gradually, adding  more exercises for days 3-4, 5-14, and until your doctor gives you full permission to exercise.
In contrast, Bonus Yoga Ball is much more challenging, targeting those poor abdominal muscles need to get back in shape.  Even Leisa Hart at four months post-partum gets out of breath on this one.  My tummy hurts just watching it.  As the title suggests, this workout requires the yoga ball.
Another special feature, FitMama and Me, is the reason I bought the DVD. How do you exercise when you can't put you baby down for even five minutes?  Simple.  You workout with your baby.  It's not as comprehensive as the full Postnatal program and it's short, but it really is a workout and in many cases it may be the only workout a busy mom can manage.  Because you lift your baby for the dance and tummy time segments, the workout gradually becomes harder as your baby grows.  My baby and I love it, especially the baby dance segment.  For this workout, you would probably want to wait until your baby has good head control.
The DVD format makes it easy to access any of the short workout segments (5 minutes or less):
* Dance With Me - a fun ""baby dance"" that gets mom moving using baby as a weight
* FitBaby - exercises for baby while mom sits on the floor
* Tummy Time - mom holds baby while doing abdominal exercises
* Quiet Time - mom does a few leg stretches while giving baby a massage
* Stroller Boogie - a demonstration of arm exercises to do while walking with the baby (I don't have an exercise band and my stroller doesn't handle well with just one hand, so I don't use this one).
This DVD is not quite perfect.  For example, the Postnatal workout with music option should skip the intro and go straight to the first cardio segment.  Also, I'd like more baby dance segments and stretching segments to provide some variety in the FitMama and Me workout.  Also, you should look elsewhere for instruction on baby massage; this program simply uses informal rub downs (which is fine for this context).  Even though there is room for improvement, this is a great DVD for a new mom from those first few days after having the baby up through the first year or so afterward.",1068681600,180,3898,4.626995645863571
1889722,5,B00009RXLO,"i really needed to find a good paced video to get back into exercising a little bit and this video is just right, i liked the instructor and felt good about the intensity of the workout. I find this video to be exactly what i need, and i also like the baby video, fitmama & me, that was a lot of fun. Enjoy!",1065398400,,307,3.888888888888889
1889723,5,B00009RXLO,"i am not a fitness enthusiast, but my doctor told me to find something i could enjoy during pregnancy and then to do the same after i delivered, and i have thoroughly enjoyed Leisa Harts pregnancy videos. The Prenatal was excellent, and now the Postnatal has impressed me as well. I love the music and pace at whic she teaches, i am carrying extra weight and do not like feeling so heavy, but she makes me feel as though I can get my figure back and that is very motivating. I still don't love working, but who does! I do like doing this video and even like the FitMama & Me workout to alter things and give me a change of pace with my little boy. I really do appreciate the FITMAMA collection.",1064620800,,694,4.225563909774436

7992911,4,B00009RXLO,"I had a couple of Prenatal DVDs, and found Leisa Hart's to be my favorite.  So after having two children in 14 months, I decided to try her Postnatal workout.  I did the pilates and stretching more in the beginning.  She does give variations and options for you to work up to.  She does use the yoga ball a lot in these segments, as others have mentioned, and using a pillow or towel as a replacement is not quite the same.  My favorite has been the two cardio/funky fat burn segments.  The yoga is nice as well.  There are several 10-minute segments, so you can choose which ones you want to do, and mix up your workouts.  Leisa Hart has a warm, friendly personality and gives cues that are easy to follow.  The exercises are easy enough for new moms to try (6-8 weeks post-partum).  I am now 9 months post parturm and ready to move on to more challenging workouts.",1398816000,,866,4.3229813664596275
7992912,1,B00009RXLO,"Very confusing steps, not good at all. The yoga part is okay, but overall, I hate this! I will be returning this soon.",1386460800,,118,4.173913043478261
7992913,1,B00009RXLO,I didn't really care for this video.  The areobics portion was full of cheesy dance moves like the Grapevine.  The yoga portion didn't feel like real yoga either.  It was full of quick movements and fast breathing in and out. Leisa Hart is definately not a yoga master. What I really wanted was a video that was geared towards mom and baby working out together.  I felt disapointed because there was only a short part under special features section and most of it was sitting and stretching while massaging the baby.  My son did seem to enjoy it the first time but he cried the second time so I stopped doing it.  I purchased Lindsay Brinn's post natal boot camp and I liked it alot better.  Over all I'd say I wish I never bought this video.  The aeorbics part also felt like it was from the 80's and the music was a really cheesy calypso sounding track.  It was anoying.,1255046400,,872,4.366459627329193
7992914,3,B00009RXLO,not very excited about it. this video is ok.thats why 3 star.i bought another to use with it.,1249257600,,93,4.222222222222222
7992915,3,B00009RXLO,"Great fitness tape.  Leisa is really good at explaining each step which makes it easier to follow along although, I wish the workout would of involved a section that you could workout with baby.",1240790400,,194,4.705882352941177
7992916,2,B00009RXLO,I did this video once and can't bring myself to try it again.  It just didn't do it for me.  Lindsay Brin's is MUCH better!  I think I will probably sell it or give it away.  Don't waste your money unless you are looking for a LIGHT workout.,1229558400,,241,3.9583333333333335
7992917,3,B00009RXLO,There were parts of the video that I liked and some that I didn't.  I had wished the pilates section was a bit longer and there was more time dedicated to core exercises.,1207440000,2,170,4.151515151515151
7992918,2,B00009RXLO,"I was very disappointed in this postnatal workout DVD. I began using the yoga portion at just a few days postpartum. As a yoga practitioner of several years, I can honestly say it in no way resembled any yoga I had ever participated in - it was just a few poses over and over again. Terrible. As I regained strength, I tried the dance/cardio segments. I'm sure  would have liked them if I had any background in aerobics or dance, but I don't, so I had no idea what she was talking about and she didn't describe it very well (what, for example, is a grapevine?). The pilates section required props, as did the yoga, which I did not have on hand at my house. If you are serious about yoga, or have limited dancing and aerobics background, or don't have the room or $$ to buy a bunch of props, this is probably not the DVD for you. I will give Leisa props for being high-energy and for the DVD including multiple types of workouts, but overall it was a waste for me.",1204070400,4,963,4.233695652173913
7992919,5,B00009RXLO,I was very happy with my purchase because it was just the right level of work out for me.  I like how it is broken up into segments since I usually get interrupted by a crying newborn and I can easily do the workout in parts.,1183852800,,225,3.891304347826087
7992920,5,B00009RXLO,"I've never stuck with workout videos for more than a couple of weeks, but this one is great. I look forward to doing it. The dance steps aren't anything fancy, but that just makes you be able to concentrate on what you're doing rather than trying to keep up with complicated moves. When this video is over, I feel so great. And in just 2 months of using it, I've seen an improvement in my energy and flexibility. I wish I'd gotten her pregnancy video. The little bit of the video that your supposed to be able to do with your baby isn't really that great. My 4 mo old gets bored. But- over all, definitely a winner.",1180742400,2,615,4.220338983050848
