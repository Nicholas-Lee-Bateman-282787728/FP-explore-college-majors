8086827,1,B000BHIBIA,The DVD did not show you how to do a puppy cut.  You were not shown how to trim hair around the face and ears,1405987200,3,109,3.36
8086828,3,B000BHIBIA,"This is a good video on the different Yorkie cuts. However, I think that the special grooming needs for this breed, ie bathing, ears,anal glands,etc. should have been included instead of being advised in the video that an additional purchase would be required to learn the basic grooming instruction/education on Yorkies. This would have been an excellent video had that been included. Educating the owner on proper care is part of the grooming process.",1209340800,12,453,5.135135135135135
8086829,4,B000BHIBIA,"My husband ordered this dvd after scalping our silky terriers.  It is helpful ... however, the terriers shown don't have the same type of hair as our silkies ... Still the instruction helped and the subsequent hair cuts have been better.",1181520000,,237,4.780487804878049
