8092561,2,B000BTQFX6,"I guess it is a good learning tool but it is a money pit and you have to keep buying disc after disc to complete course , I had one that had a whole guitar learning course but for some reason my windows 7 will not accept the disc from an older product so I will keep looking for a complete guitar course in one disc, I don't want to have to keep changing from one disc to another when I want  to refresh my memory of an early session when I can just go to a ref .Page and keep a pleasant learning experience..",1438905600,,509,3.8476190476190477

8092564,3,B000BTQFX6,"I am just learning the guitar, and I find the teacher to be a good guy, and he's very helpful with learning the chords. After learning the chords however, he seems to zip into advanced areas --would have preferred maybe some beginner songs, etc.",1226793600,2,245,4.590909090909091
8092565,5,B000BTQFX6,"The Instructor does a good job of giving you a introductory lesson in playing acoustic guitar.. not too slow... not too fast. He covers proper playing position, tuning by ear and how to use a tuner. He breaks down good basic chords to get you going. He also covers some progressions and various strumming patterns. The exclusive access feature that allows you to go online and download all the lessons in the DVD was very nice.  A very good choice for a beginner.",1177027200,5,463,4.578313253012048
8092566,5,B000BTQFX6,"This DVD is AWESOME! From chords to strumming patterns and metronome exercises, this is a great way to learn. Charles Sedlak does a really good job breaking everything down and making it very easy to follow along. There is a ton of material and access to print everything out at the Icons of Rock website. Worth every penny! If you are eager to learn to play then this is the way to go. Five stars for sure.",1173830400,3,407,4.298701298701299
8092567,5,B000BTQFX6,"I really liked this DVD from Charles Sedlak. his manner of guiding beginning students through each lesson is not intimidating or too fast. Charles starts from the ground floor of guitar playing covering areas such as proper playing position and holding the pick I found this refreshing becasue I have seen videos that completely disregard those important first steps of playing guitar. He covers many chords, stumming patterns and pregressions. I would highly recommend this for any beginning player.

8092568,2,B000BTQFX6,"This dvd doesn't seem to be well organized with nothing more than simple instructions and no extra play along beats or lessons.  It's like watching a low budget VHS video. The instructor just plays his guitar and show off his skills. It is difficult to follow along because he doesn't give you the time to practice. There's absolutely no pause between lessons. Get ready to pause the dvd throughout the lesson.  If you look carefully, you can notice that he is out of breath and excessively sweating.  That's how fast he moves through the lesson.  This is a typical, low budget guitar instruction.  This is also not made in 2006, but rather 2005.  I suggest ""the Fender Presents: getting started on Acoustic guitar"".  Fender took their time making their 300 min dvd.  ""Guitar Lessons:.."" is a okay video.. But are you kidding me? I can't believe these companies don't take their time making their dvds.  I've wasted my money and time with this dvd. Thank goodness for Fender!",1142294400,9,975,4.755952380952381
