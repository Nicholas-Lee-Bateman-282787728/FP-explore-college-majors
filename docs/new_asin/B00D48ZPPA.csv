5773562,5,B00D48ZPPA,"Love these movies. I can't wait for #3 which comes out at the end of November 2014 on DVD.
Stallone's commentary on #1 (which he directed), is surprisingly erudite and insightful. Anytime Hale Cesar picks up that A 12 automatic shotgun, It puts a smile on my face.
Surprisingly, you can watch these multiple times without getting bored. They are bloody sausage fests, with no female nudity whatsoever. . . not even a see through tattered shirt or nip slip. Other than a brief bit with Charisma Carpenter as Strathams gf, the two female protagonists in each respective movie are no-name foreign talent. But that's okay as their reason for being is to provide the rails on which this Expendable Express rides. These movies are uneven but I am sure there was a lot more film in the can and the cutting was to make the films tight. This works but it feels a lot like a plane ride. . . Cruising the tarmac, then a blast into the sky, then a rough landing and you have to pick up your luggage.
I'll be waiting with my twenty bucks next month at Wally World.",1414454400,3,1051,4.422680412371134
