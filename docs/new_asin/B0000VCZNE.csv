I was shocked in parts and laughed heaps too. I did not like Texas Chainsaw (the new one) one little bit. THIS movie has character and style and a unique quality. It does remind me of such films as Evil Dead but its very clever and its more of a ride than a movie!",1070841600,2,410,3.9518072289156625

It had dumb moments from start to finish,and worst of all no characters to root for or really hate. I cant believe a bottom of the barrell flick like this can be released in theaters when exciting ones like DOG SOLDIERS,BELOW,EQUILIBRIUM,and GINGER SNAPS get sent direct to video. Go watch EVIL DEAD and 28 DAYS LATER instead.",1070755200,5,494,4.613636363636363

1948702,3,B0000VCZNE,"An unashamed throwback to the gory, glory days of yore, ""Cabin Fever"" is writer/director Eli Roth's valentine to 70s splatter, with cupid's bloodied arrow aimed firmly at the early works of Raimi, Craven and Hooper.
The plot is bespoke low-budget shtick with a twist. Five deeply annoying teens take the usual inexplicable woodlands trip to a remote log cabin with beer, pot and raging hormones in tow.
So far so ""Evil Dead"". The difference here is that the killer is not a supernatural force or - despite the presence of colourful locals - a hillbilly psycho. Instead, it's a contagious flesh-eating disease, whose virulence is maintained through an infected water supply. Nice.
As the gang starts to fall apart (literally in some cases) half the fun for the audience is in witnessing just how severely this virus takes its toll. Horror buffs who have been dining too long on paltry, anaemic genre parody will relish Roth's determination to deliver the kind of visceral sucker-punch that's been absent from the big screen for decades.
Even more surprising is the ferocity with which the kids turn on each other as they cling on to gossamer thin notions of survival. Cue SARS style paranoia and too-little-too-late ideas about separate eating rules and quarantines, as tempers - and skin tissue -start to fray.
Sounds too good to be true, but a plodding mid-section slackens the pace,while Roth's attempts to diffuse the carnage with comic asides are variable. It may also have been more than just a little over-hyped. Sure, for an audience reared on  ""Valentine"" or ""Wrong Turn"", this is going to
seem like a real pants-filler. On the other hand, aficionados expecting a modern horror classic to match the sense of dread of ""Texas Chainsaw"", the freshness of ""Evil Dead"" or the cruelty of Craven's ""Last House"", are going to be seriously disappointed.
Even so, in the last third, Roth finally lets rip, delivering a couple of choice moments destined to linger long in the memory of even the most jaded gore hound. Female viewers take note - you may want to shave your legs before seeing this movie. Chances are afterwards, you won't want to

1948733,2,B0000VCZNE,"Terrible film.  Reuses the same music cues over and over. Pans to a 'red-out' view for no reason, repeatedly. Cast is atrocious. Characters do not listen to each other at all. How many times did someone ask a question or give a direction and was totally ignored. The punk who brags about his dog being involved with his masturbation and who is burning things and shooting squirrels, who keeps a friend like that around? Who takes a guy like that on a cabin vacation? The women are obviously disgusted by him and his buddies are totally oblivious to their comfort levels.  The stoner with the tent was a buzzkill with his lines. Stupid behavior on everyone's part. The cast was constantly overreacting to the wrong things, and underreacting to the wrong things. Nobody could think clearly about the situation. The bearded shop-keeper is the only interesting and funny person in the film. Since HBO kept showing this, I finally saw it from beginning to end, and this is my hate-review. Truly a waste of a movie.",1476835200,,1009,4.7272727272727275

1948756,4,B0000VCZNE,"I didn't know that there's a different between dvd and bluray and bought the dvd.
The bluray was unrated and the dvd was rated R. BLURAY is longer then the dvd as well.
Anyway, I saw the GREEN INFERNO before this movie which is  Eli Roth's recent film and tought that the director is really good at dealing with the actors but t as far as the special effect makeup, they don't look so real and scary. (It was more like Peter Jackson's early film like-that's why Peter liked this film so much.)
This movie is even worse. But thinking back, it was just for fun. Maybe it was not meant to be all scary.
The good thing about this film is two main actresses were all very pretty and good at acting. It looked like they are all well trained actresses. Also the three actors are good and have individual colors too. There are some nudity and I think they are there to show that the woman was beautiful before and after she is infected, she becomes so fu** up. That is the reason why the director showed the naked woman having sex with the boyfriend.
I have no doubt for the director in choosing actors. Bacaue all of the actors all lovable.
The ending seems decent and the movie above all was ok to me.
I expected nothing so big,.. so what can I say.",1453593600,,1243,4.244725738396625

1948786,5,B0000VCZNE,"That guy asked us for help...we set him on fire...
How can people NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE!?!?
I think this movie is great as a horror movie and great at showing the times we live in. Some vacationing college grads are so afraid of this guy they don't know, asking for help, that the kill him. I think it is a great statement just there. We have been taught to fear everyone and everything to the point that we are afraid of anyone we don't know. In the past, hopefully, a person asking for help would receive it with compassion. The groups response sets up the entire movie as payback for a evil deed. Literally the biblical ""sow the wind, reap the whirlwind"" type of consequence.
I know people don't like Eli Roth very much, for some reason, but you cannot ignore this movie or downgrade it because of that.
On it's merits I believe it stands alone as a masterpiece of horror.",1432339200,,873,4.361963190184049

1948789,5,B0000VCZNE,"The first time i saw this i was not impressed but it grew on me and now i love it,it is the best in the teilogy for sure. Story is there is some unknown pollutant in the water that eats away at the body and causes you to spit up blood and rot feom the inside out. A few college kids are on vacation and they are looking to cut loose and have a weekend party but things go wrong when an unknown bum finds his dog dead from this plague virus,then the kids come across the bum who is now infected and they shoot at him with a .22 and he wanders off. They call the cops who turn out to be a joke,just a random clown who tries to get his kicks out of being ""the cool easygoing cop"" but these kids have a problem when they shoot the guy after he spits blood all over the car. The 2 guys make a bet that they will only drink beer but the 1 kid drinks water that has the contagion in it. The guy they set on fire who's infected fell into the water reservoir and they soon find that the townspeoples pigs and cattle are infected. So these hitsquad type cops come in and slaughter the remainder of the living infected and they burn the bodies & keep it all quiet. In summary there is alot of gore cuz of the flesh eating bacteria that is unknown,some really graphic scenes of skin melting right off as a girl shaves her legs. A guy gets a harmonica down his throat,the cop is a clown,the guys who run the corner market are just wierd & the kid who always yells pancakes i just cannot explain. But this movie is really unique in the sense that you never know how it started til' part 3 which fell short compared to the unique and eerie story here,mixed with gore galore for fans. Part 2 has lots more gore but it is not as in depth as this one. I suggest you get it because Eli Roth does not disappoint.",1427760000,2,1792,4.0083798882681565

Five college students take a road trip after finishing exams out to a campground and rent a cabin.

Out of fear, all the students lock themselves inside the cabin to avoid being hurt by this possibly insane man. As the hours tick by and the days continue, everyone begins to experience strange symptoms that start off like the flu and gradually develop open wounds and sores.

I did like the parts at the end that put the selfish campers in the same boat as the sick woodsman, so they finally knew how they made him feel.  Unfortunately, the movie didn't spell it out so some people might have missed it.  Other than that, the movie is only worth watching for the weird pancakes scene.

The characters felt genuine because they were all squirrley. All the small town people somewhere in the sticks get a good slice of reality, whether or not they face it. The dialog was good, if a little overloaded with profanity. ""It's like you're in a plane and you know it's going to crash and you're going to die. And the only thing you want to do is **ck the **it out of the person next to you."" It really hit a good nail on the head. The movie wasn't about a cure and it wasn't about a cause but how people handle the situation in the face of a gruesome, miserable death. Again, the psychological aspect was well written.

I give the movie four stars because there are some really colorful characters involved. the setting is really good, really perfect for the event. However, sex scenes never do much for me and the characters, for the most part, were idiots. But at the end you can't help but pity them. They were at the wrong place at the wrong time. But they did not deal with it well and honestly, I think that's pretty realistic. None of them were geniuses.

I give Amazon's delivery of the rental a two-star, however. The movie did not stream well AT ALL. It'd play for 3 minutes then I had to wait a minute for buffering-all through the movie! It was frustrating.",1380758400,2,1437,4.398496240601504

The idea of a virus or infection that causes everyone to get sick and literally lose their flesh was a very fresh concept. This film won't scare the hell out of you, but it does offer some pretty good shocks.

You have five friends who decide to retreat to a cabin in the woods to party after college exams. Instead they are greeted by some strange residents to the area and then, later on, by a man dying of some flesh eating virus that he in the process of pleading for help passes along to the five friends. As they slowly start to die off with no one willing to help them they turn on one another as the bleakness of their situation starts to set in.

The acting is decent and the story is fun, so in the end `Cabin Fever' is a somewhat campy, fun and entertaining horror movie that is the best thing Eli Roth has ever done in my opinion. This is definitely worth a watch!",1358294400,,998,4.219895287958115

1948895,3,B0000VCZNE,"Eli Roth's feature film debut features a strange flesh eating disease that turns body tissues soft and spongy, leading to some bloody and horrific moments, for a group of teens on vacation.  These friends are not particularly bright, and do little to help themselves once the misfortune strikes.  The locals are less than friendly, and an already messy situation for the visitors, just gets worse.

A hunter contracts the disease from a dead animal.  When the sick man shows up a cabin looking for help, the five college friends who are staying there wind up attacking him and then setting him on fire.  The burned man wanders into the woods, dies, and his infected body ends up in a reservoir that provides water to the cabin.

With their car disabled, the group is stuck at the cabin.  One of them gets sick from the water, but sadly her friends are unable to do much to help her.  Things have progressed too far, by the time the victims finally manage to contact the locals, who take drastic steps to contain the outbreak.

Like watching a ship going down to the bottom with all hands aboard, Cabin Fever is quite grim, as those in distress slowly slide down into disaster.  Not a particularly likable bunch, it's hard to feel too badly for these folks, but it still isn't exactly a pleasant experience watching their demise.  For a while, there's not much happening at the cabin, except a wild dog drawn by the blood.  Roth eventually delivers some memorable moments, such as the bloody bathtub shaving scene, but the serious gore seems to be a long time in coming.

But if you can stomache a little gore, Cabin Fever is quite entertaining and has so much to offer. There were so many moments that seem to have made an indelible impression on my brain. There was the matter of a german shephard, not at all central to the plot, but it would appear at random and kill people. And while this was happening, it always appeared to be just playing with them. There was the 20something deputy who rides around on a bicycle and is obsessed with finding people to party with. The local rednecks, who flip out and decide to kill our teenage protagonists after a virus is transmitted to one of their kin. I mean, it seemed like an excessive reaction, but maybe thats just me.

A bunch of foul-mouthed potheads travel to a cabin in the woods, have lots of sex, freak out over a water-transmitted flesh-eating disease, and die. I had a couple of chuckles in the beginning, which was okay, but then things went downhill. I wasn't scared a bit in the entire thing and there were lots of idiotic parts. Too many worth mentioning, so here are a couple lame, barely-SPOILERS:

One dumb scene has the first person that comes to the cabin seeking help. The occupants shut the door in his face and the sick person proceeds to hot-wire their truck. This is the same person who was accidentally shot by one of the college dudes who never tried to get help as he said he would. The college guys then come out and try to beat him out of the vehicle or shoot him, eventually lighting him on fire and killing him, when he didn't try to attack them at all.

Let's forget that idiot who survived and goes back to the cabin for some reason. When he sees that his supposed friends died, it first seems like he's really sad that they are all dead --- but then he freaks out and claims over and over how he made it. Then, walking outside, he gets shot zillions of times by the police.

I tell you, the best actor in this mess didn't say a word: that little kid right at the beginning who was listening to the woman in the car telling him that college was a scam and to avoid it.

A better thing to avoid is this film. A college degree isn't needed to do that. Oh my! I see that they actually made a follow-up to this thing which apparently is a failure, too. There's no interest in seeing that and viewing this once was more than enough.",1310169600,4,1882,4.275280898876405

1948915,4,B0000VCZNE,"Any movie that is written and directed by Eli Roth you know is going to have gratuitous violence, gore, and an interesting plot. While filmed in 2002 it felt like a throw back to combination of a late 80's to early 90's slasher film due to the setting with an outbreak film. This is one of Eli's first releases that received actual attention in the horror genre and is what you can thank or blame (depending on your taste) on his continued acquisition of a budget for his films.

The story begins with 5 friends leaving the city for staying at a cabin that they are renting for a nice get away to party at. It's quickly made clear that the town that is closest to the cabin is full of hillbillies and not quite what our group is used to. From the uneducated to a child who bites whoever sits near him - clearly a group of real winners. When they get to the cabin it quickly proves to be exactly what they are hoping for. That is the case at least until one of the friends accidentally shoots a man who is apparently sick. He runs off and promptly puts it out of his mind. The friends go back to relaxing but you know that if he's being introduced here it's only a matter of time before he comes back.

Once the day turns to night the relaxation starts to give way as the get together becomes a party among friends which as you well know in any horror film set on a lake or campground is a sure recipe for disaster. As they are getting comfortable for the night a knock out the door shows the man who was shot earlier show up. It's is clear that his sickness has gotten progressively worse to the point where it has turned serious. They try to offer him help but are convinced he is trying to attack them and end up injuring him trying to get him to go away. He stumbled away and are shown a shot where he falls into a pool of water. We pan over from this pool, through a pipe, and into a glass within the cabin.

With one of the friends infected the rest shut her out and quarentine her. It's quickly showing to spread among others of the friends and when one makes a break for it the townsfolk become aware of the problem. It's a great mix of 80's slasher flick campiness and a good outbreak film. Eli delivers in spades in this one combining humor, horror, and hillbilies - even adding in a governemnt agency that helps to crack down on the outbreak. The sequel as I mentioned just came out and I suggest watching this one before taking a look to get the base ideas on where the film is coming from.",1301875200,,2501,4.173913043478261

This movie has absolutely nothing going for it and apparently the writer thought it would be better to try and shock us with the overuse of the ""F"" word rather than some legitimate suspense or horror. Cabin Fever has no drama, no suspense, no action, no frights no shocks and no tangible plot. And this particular cabin seems to be about five minutes from everywhere, yet they can't seem to get away from it or get help.

The most frightening thing about this movie is that one has to pay money to watch it. Next time I want to watch a horror movie I'll re-watch Raimi and Hooper and quit believing the hype surrounding the wannabe horror directors. Do yourself a favor and watch the family friendly version offered on the DVD extras and save yourself about 89 minutes.

Except, this time out it's not a crazed lunatic after them, it's a disease.  There is something visceral, almost primal, about the fear of disease.  Who likes to be coughed on or at?  And as this is a very visible disease, it's no surprise that the 'friends' soon turn on each other.  That's the horror.  However, it would have been far more effective if any or all of these people were likable to begin with.

1948930,4,B0000VCZNE,"I liked this movie for all the wrong reasons. For starters, I was eager to see everyone die except the token jerk (hereafter referred to as Fratboy) and spent most of the time I was paying attention laughing. Bloody projectile vomiting, immolating ebola victims, and Emocop enticing the vacationing coeds to drink and party and stay longer so they die... heck, maybe I'm supposed to laugh.

Anyway, your typical teens-go-off-to-die movie, at least it seems at first. They spend way too much time developing the dork's crush and the promiscuous couple so it's a good half hour before we get to the flesh-eating action, precipitated by Fratboy going off to shoot squirrels ""'Cause they're faggots.""

While drinking and fag-capping, our lovable stereotype accidentally blows a tiny hole in some poor yuppie that fell into the local toxic waste and got the funny ebola. Fratboy, in amazing violation of all movie cliches, figures it's not wise to touch the man slowly losing his skin. Despite being drunk, and a moron, he high tails it back to the cabin for some sexual tension and pot smoking.

Of course, Mr. Skinless has to show up and incite the stupidity of the others. Fratboy continues to demonstrate his fucntioning brain by first wanting nothing to do with the rotting plague carrier, and then wanting to get the hell out of dodge once it was clear everyone else was going to augment their retardation with a fatal rash.

Naturally, they're all goners. But how they go, that's just delicious! The two girls, slutty and precious, slowly rot until one is a skeleton and the other is devoured by dogs. She would have outrun them, but her leg fell off! Ha! The men get much more manly fates, with the local townsfolk blasting the crap out of them with their second amendment rights. The dork does manage to take a few down with him, particularly the poor sod who gets his harmonica shoved down his own throat. Not enough that he has to die, but his death rattles are a hodown! And to top it off, he drops his rotting body in the town reservoir! Yee-haw!

But we're not done, not just yet. You see, earlier in the film, a crotchety old shop keeper best described as ""Santa makes you squeel like a pig,"" pointed to a rifle behind the counter being for the black folks. But he didn't use that word. Sure enough, they show up and Santa goes scurrying into the shop. Inside the shop, the audience gets one final hit to left field as everyone breaks into ""Wuttup mah n---!"" Because you see, the rifle really was for them -- it was their bloody rifle!

1948933,3,B0000VCZNE,"A weekend getaway to a cabin in the woods turns deadly for five friends when they become infected with a flesh-eating virus in Eli Roth's debut Horror film. Roth is known for being a true-blooded genre fan, which is evident in the visual and musical references he makes to films like LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, DAWN OF THE DEAD, and others. CABIN FEVER caters to the modern Horror audiences that grew up with the excessive Splatter films from the 80s, dishing up gratuitous amounts of nudity, gore, and gross-outs. It introduces a series of oddball characters, from the off-beat shopkeepers in town and their pancake-loving son to the party-crazed Deputy Winston. Roth brings together an enjoyable cast, but his writing is decidedly weaker than in his next effort, HOSTEL, and there are many spotty moments found in the performances. Despite its flaws, CABIN FEVER strikes an even balance between the dark humor and horror, while also offering clean cinematography and a unique twist on classic genre conventions.

During their time, Bert encounters an individual who is sick with a virus.  After Bert shoots at the person, the infected individual tracks down the group and ends up vomitting blood all over the place until fleeing after being ignited on fire.

1948938,4,B0000VCZNE,"Watching ""Cabin Fever"" reminded me of the fun one could have while making a horror film.  One could argue that modern horror is too detailed, over-produced, under talented, and quintessentially making the same mold over and over merely for cinema dollars.  The argument is tired, but true.  Made in 2002, and only grossing about 21 million, this was a small blip on everyone's radar.  Found randomly on DVD one October at my local video store, ""Cabin Fever"" was a means to merely scare a gathering of friends, or perhaps just gather some laughs.  Little did we realize that this was something stronger than just your average teen-horror flick.  Director Eli Roth (speaking pre-""Hostel"") knew his horror genre.  Being an assistant with David Lynch for many years, he understands that spooky doesn't mean linear, that blood does come in gallon containers and the more obscure the better.  ""Cabin Fever"" proved that with mediocre dialogue, great horror shots, and the fear of the unknown (which was left unknown throughout the film).  He tells us the fears, but not his characters - giving us tension with the horror.  While ""Hostel"" seems too mainstream and less Lynch-ian for my standards, ""Cabin Fever"" complete with ""pancakes"", ""Denis"", the box, and the fear of this backwoods community, is that diamond in the rough.  This singular film demonstrated the power behind Roth, and his missed opportunity for films to come.

There is no arguing that this is an amateur film.  The edits are rough, the story is haphazard, and the characters are bland, but what is impressive is the passion behind the camera.  The flux of different genres blended together proves that Roth had done his homework, that he loves horror, and wasn't afraid of taking chances.  He created a horror film without giving us a monster, the choice of a faceless virus wreaking havoc onto a group of unsuspecting teens was bold, but worked perfectly.  Fear was created within the unknown, or more importantly, from what we knew but our characters did not.  Clich to the hilt, our leaders in this rag-tag group of C-actors (of which our leader is the boy from ""Boy Meets World"") try to break the mold, but nothing spectacular comes of it.  This, oddly, works for ""Cabin Fever"" because the core of the film doesn't need popular faces, but instead a stark need for bleak realism.  As horror watchers, we know that the outcome for those with clich lines is not positive, so Roth plays with that.  He builds non-existent characters to run around screaming, while we scream back.  ""Go out of the woods"" - ""Get in the cabin"" - ""Don't stare at the naked woman"" - ""Get help!"" are all things not said within the film, but instead in the audience.  Roth pulls you in.  Instead of being a mere spectator, ""Cabin Fever"" asks you to be involved.

Two big scenes (amongst many) stand out as reasons to watch this film.  Whether you are a horror fan or not, these two speak volumes of what Roth learned from Lynch when working together.  The first is Dennis.  The child at the store that has a fascination with biting people that sit next to him, who loves pancakes, and equally enjoys karate moves - was one of those moments that proved Roth's loyalty to the trade.  The slow motion karate reminded me of ""Twin Peaks"" and the music that accompanied added to that feel.  The entire station was pulled from a Lynch world, and I would have considered this theft if the two hadn't worked together.  Instead, it felt more like a homage, a brief ""thank you"" to Roth's mentor.  With that said, the second scene that speaks volumes of Roth's talent is something that he has carried with him throughout his ""Hostel"" years.  The unknown.  Without spoiling anything, when our group of gun-toting locals arrive to the cabin, two have guns while one merely carries a box.  When two fall shy of their goals, the other merely attempts to open a box as his form of defense.  What was in that box?  What could have protected him?  This is the unknown makes ""Cabin Fever"" stand out stronger than others of this genre released at the same time.  Sure, it's small - but the effect and conversation that follows with your peers is sublime.

Again, ""Cabin Fever"" wasn't the bee's knees of horror films, but unlike Roth's future endeavors it demonstrated his ability to take a small idea and blossom it into true fear.  Many will probably not enjoy this film, seeing ""Hostel"" as his penultimate work, this will seem lackluster - but for those nay-sayers against his torture-porn, this is a throwback to a stronger era of horror moviemaking.  One part David Lynch, one part ""Wrong Turn"", and one part ""The Stand"" (that's a lot of parts) - Roth proves that he can handle a camera, a story, and a crew whilst scaring us, grossing us out, and creating a world within a world.

VIDEO:  The film is loose, an amateur outing with quite a bit of ideas that seem under developed and over exposed, but I loved it.  It showed talent coupled with intrigue.  Roth will forever be remembered to the mass audiences as ""Hostel"" maker, but for me - ""Cabin Fever"" ranks as more original and enjoyable.

VISUAL:  Simple DVD.  The woods and colors seem to blend.  The sharpness of some of the scenes isn't as focused, and it felt grainy at times - but again, this was a first film for Roth.  With little money, what can you do?  There were some great scenes that were filmed with strong angles and a keen eye for storytelling, but nothing spectacular.  Decent transfer that could use a strong upgrade one day.

SOUND:  One of the key elements to this film is the sound - and borrowing from Lynch and creating his own voice, Roth does wonders with the music chosen.  From the included songs to the background theme, ""Cabin Fever"" has a distinct sound that makes it feel like you are being chased by a flesh eating virus in the woods.

EXTRAS:  This simple disc is packed with stuff.  The ""Family Friendly"" version of the film is hysterical.  Roth hams it up for the camera, a la a Disney introduction.  The ""Chick-O-Vision"" is a great inclusion.  My personal favorites, ""The Rotten Fruits"" have three episodes on the disc that will make you laugh hysterically as well as see those dull Veggie Tales in a new light.  Then, there is the quintessential behind the scenes footage where we learn about every aspect of this film.  Lacking a strong commentary, that would be my only complaint with such strong special features.

Overall, I am not afraid to say that I like ""Cabin Fever"".  When I first saw it I was impressed by what little I understood and what Roth spoon-fed me.  I thought he was a director to watch, and I still think he has quite a bit of potential, but to be remembered merely for ""Hostel"" just doesn't cut it.  ""Cabin Fever"" is a great entry into the world of horror, creating genuine scares and following a predesigned structure (not a bad thing for this film) - he uses his own techniques to tell his story.  ""Cabin Fever"" remains a strong entry into the world of horror.  If you are new to Roth, I say start here - if you are disappointed with his future work - go back and see this again.  You will not be disappointed.

""Cabin Fever"" is a great thriller. None of the performances will garner the actors Oscar nods, but the producers main goal was to scare and shock the audience out of their seats; they succeeded in full force. The plot centers on a group of friends embarking on a weekend getaway into the woods where they stay at a cabin. Suddenly, they start to break out in rashes with their skin bubbling and burning. The question is how is all this happening? The special effects are intelligent, but be forewarned: if you have a weakness for blood and gore this movie is not for you. ""Cabin Fever"" is a bit more explicit than most horror films of the 2000's, but it is fast-paced, well-plotted, and freightening. The DVD contains 5 audio commentaries, along with the trailer, and a documentary on the making of the film.

1948954,2,B0000VCZNE,"Released in 2003, ""Cabin Fever"" was Eli Roth's film debut; he would go on to make the 2005 horror hit ""Hostel."" ""Cabin Fever"" has become somewhat of a modern cult film due to its eccentricities and Roth's later notoriety.

THE PLOT: Five college youths -- 3 guys and 2 girls -- take a cabin vacation in the sticks of NC where they are threatened by a serious disease where those infected spit out blood while their skin wastes away. They soon discover that the local reservoir is contaminated. Can they make it out alive?

This is a heavy 'R' picture; Roth was tired of what he called the ""watered down PG-13"" horror films of the studios, and refused to compromise on the violence, nudity and cussing, insisting they were essential ingredients to an '80s-style horror film. Essential ingredients maybe, but such things can't make up for overall ineffectiveness. I just don't get what's so great about ""Cabin Fever."" The plot is good, as are other items, but the film leaves a lot to be desired, unless of course you're not looking for much intelligence or authentic horror and just want a fun, quasi-horror experience. Or maybe you have to be a ""true horror aficionado"" to appreciate it, whatever that is.

WHAT WORKS:

- I was interested in ""Cabin Fever"" mainly due to the beautiful Cerina Vincent. She was only 21 when the film was made and it shows. As good as she looks in ""Cabin Fever"" she's far more gorgeous in later films like 2006's ""Sasquatch Mountain"" and 2005's ""It Waits,"" where she's more curvy with a fuller mane. - The picture's eccentricities are enjoyable, such as the weirdo party-dude deputy, the inbred karate boy (who looks like a girl) and, especially, the part where we're led to believe an old shopkeeper is prejudiced against blacks until we discover the truth at the end; that was a good one! - I like the early Fall backwoods North Carolina cinematography.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK:

- The biggest problem with ""Cabin Fever"" is that it doesn't take itself seriously enough. Isn't this supposed to be a horror film? Well, how can the viewer be horrified when the filmmakers keep telegraphing that it's all a joke? If we can't take the story seriously, we can't take the horror seriously either. Suffice to say, the story could have been horrifying but it's not. What we're left with is a somewhat amusing flick with horror trappings and gruesome elements, but no real horror. By contrast, the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" was successfully horrifying because the film (and filmmakers) took the subject seriously. - Some say the five protagonists are unlikable, but this isn't really true. They act like typical college youths trying to have a good time on vacation. What is a turn-off, however, is their over-the-top cussing. Don't get me wrong here because I actually prefer realistic cussing in film; in other words, I prefer that the characters talk like people in real life. As such, it's very rare that I complain about cussing in a movie (almost never). But, here, it's just total overkill. Now, someone may defend it on the grounds that people would likely cuss a lot in such a horrific situation and I would agree, but the characters overdo it well BEFORE anything horrific happens. Maybe the cussing overkill is part of Roth's joke: ""Let's go ultra R-rated and overdo everything that's watered-down in a PG-13 film."" Regardless, this approach makes his protagonists sound like morons who have no right to step foot into an elementary school English class let alone be college graduates.

BOTTOM LINE: While ""Cabin Fever"" has some positive elements -- Cerina Vincent, the NC backwoods cinematography, a couple of amusing parts and the end-credits song -- it's not horrifying at all because it's pretty much a big joke. But it is sometimes gruesome, if that's your thang. Furthermore, the overkill cussing of the protagonists gets old real quick. It's a trashy, ignoble movie and I don't get the hype.

The unrated version runs 98 minutes and the film was shot mainly in North Carolina, with some parts in Dundas, Ontario, and the Los Angeles area.

1948961,3,B0000VCZNE,"Cabin Fever is somewhat of a cult classic that has been floating around since 2003. With the amount of b horror we've seen over the years it may be suprising we haven't checked this one out. Undeniably it has b potential all over it, especially when you have Rider Strong and Cerina Vincent as 2 of the key roles. Cerina is a joy to look at but couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. She was definately thrown in there to keep your attention as she does in about 100 other b horrors. This film is also an early work of rising writer/director Eli Roth which lets you know it's going to be a very over the top gorefest, which we usually aren't crazy about, but figured it works well being the Halloween time of year. Since it was on tv why not go for it?

The film starts off with a group of college grads who are looking for one last getaway before they enter the working world. Paul(Rider Strong), Karen, Bert, Marcy(Cerina), and Jeff head out to a remote cabin in the woods to kick off the party. They get a nice bonfire going and start to tell a very b story about a murderer who wacked a bunch of people then bowled with their bodyparts when they are interrupted by Eli Roth who makes a brief cameo. He is a total freak and only gets offered to chill once they find out he has a giant bag of doobage (oh yeah!). It's about the rain and he says he has to run to his tent real quick and will be back to smoke them out in about a half hour. As they eagerly await his return inside they get a knock at the door. Once they open it they are greeted by Harry the Hermit whose skin is falling off while he begs for help. The juice machine Bert freaks out shutting the door saying no way to letting him in for fear they will get whatever he's got. Since they don't let him in Harry the Hermit jumps in the car and tries to steal it. So whats the only logical thing to do? Jump out of the cabin with a golf club, bat, and shot gun and tear apart your own car (1 star earned). It was one of the most bizzare scenes but very hilarious. So as they freak telling Harry to get out he starts puking up blood all over the car. They finally get him out and somehow set him on fire where he goes running off into the woods. Oh the laughs were plentiful!

The following day 2 of the guys decide to find a mechanic since they trashed their own car. They are unsuccesful but do get a visit from an officer who was checking out the place after getting a disturbance call. For some reason he shows up the next day instead of when he gets the call but hey it's b. This cop is a total loser and is obsessed with partying. Paul tells the cop their car was attacked by a crazy homeless guy and thats it. The cop ignores the fact that the entire car is covered in bloood and the investigation ends with the cop saying he'll come back to party with them.  Now that the cops gone the good times roll once Karen starts showing strange signs of being sick. It starts off with a crazy looking flesh eating rash on her leg which makes everyone freak out. And being the great friends they are they make her stay out in the shed so they don't become infected. From here on out the remaining crew does everything they can to stay healthy and work hard on getting the car fixed to get Karen to a doctor. By time they get the car running Bert takes off once he shows signs of the virus. He drives to a general store and becomes part of on of the top 5 strangest scenes we have ever scene. Some kid on a bench sees him and screams ""PANCAKES!"" over and over again then starts doing karate moves as he approaches. Once he gets up to Bert he bites his hand. No sure what any of this meant but it was very entertaining yet disturbing all at once. Bert then becomes hunted by some local hicks who fear he may spread the virus and wind up taking him out. One by one the rest bite the dust. It was all because the guy they set on fire jumped into a lake where he died contaminating the water supply. This then spread it throughout the group and appeared that it would affect the rest of the town after some kids have do a lemonade stand with water from the lake.

Cabin Fever really lacked in many departments but was a fun watch from a b standpoint. The acting is some of the worst we've seen in a more mainstream film. You really don't feel bad for the characters except the chick they dump in the shed. The rest of the film is filled with laughs and confusion. We can't give this one a strong recommendation but will say it may be worth it for some laughs. If you're a gore lover you should really like this one.",1224979200,5,4572,4.082313681868743

The infection is natural and gradual. But some of the decisions the characters make are stupid. But even then overall the movie doesn't pretend to be deeper than a horror flick. So you are not going into this one to see Academy award stuff. But the acting is still top notch. They do a pretty good job of acting being freaked out and seeing their friends become walking talking skinned alive beings due to the infestation of the virus. Also an insane county policeman and an insane police kind of gives it that freaky unreal touch that the movie needs. Its like its happening in some other world not on this Earth. But as usual in Eli Roth movies, there is a little skin bonus. We get a pretty attractive female lead with an ample and athletic figure. Eli always gets in a sex scene or two into his movies. This one is no exception. A little added bonus for the guys who wanted to leave the theaters. 'Bloody good fun skinning people alive' kinda film.

I'd definitly say this is a horror/comedy movie. There are too many jokes and funny moments for it to be taken too seriously. I suppose that's why I enjoyed it. For as cheap as it on here, I'd buy it. It's worth it for many laughs and a few, ""eew"" moments.",1194652800,,564,3.956140350877193
1948966,3,B0000VCZNE,"Inspired by the recent review of a fellow Ammy friend I decided to take another look at this quote unquote horror movie.  `Cabin Fever' is not a scary movie.  It's camp.  But when you watch it for the funny film that it really is then you can start to appreciate the movie.  It's not a spoof either though, and one must realize that.  This is not a movie that makes fun of the horror genre ala `Scary Movie' or `Shaun of the Dead' but is one that embellishes unrealistic situations to a point where it comes off funny instead of dreadful.  Yes, director Eli Roth inserted moments of purposeful humor (like the much discussed `Pancakes' boy) but the film is really a quote unquote serious attempt at horror with comedic undercurrents that tend to take over.

The plot is nothing new to the world of horror.  It's somewhat like `Deliverance' with a skin virus.  You have five friends who decide to retreat to a cabin in the woods for some fun and relaxation only to find anything but.  Instead they are greeted by some strange residents to the area and then, later on, by a man dying of some flesh eating virus that he in the process of pleading for help passes along to the five friends.  As they slowly die alone in the cabin with no one willing to help them they turn on one another as the bleakness of their situation starts to set in.  This could have gone the route of the recent `Bug' and become a more psychological film that delved into the insanity of desperation but instead it decided to go a tad (or more than a tad) overboard.  The cast of characters, especially those the five friends encounter, are so clichd and stereotypical it's unbelievable, but that's all in good fun.

The acting is decent, but then again the film really doesn't call for the actors to act.  The scenes are set up for them, the dialog is handed them and they just do their best not to get shown up but the outrageous happenings around them.  I remember growing up watching Rider Strong on `Boy Meets World' so I was thrilled to see him in this movie.  It's not like the film does him much justice, but then again it's not like I have anything aside from `Boy Meets World' to judge this against so for all I know this is the extent of his talent.  Joey Kern is decent for what is required of him, as is Jordan Ladd.  James DeBello is just downright obnoxious and annoying but when taken into context is actually quite funny.  Cerina Vincent is just utterly gorgeous, enough said.

So in the end `Cabin Fever' is not a film to take seriously but is a film that, when taken for what it really is, is sure to entertain.  My wife has never seen this because she's not too keen on scary movies and when I told her it was hysterical she looked at me like I was crazy.  Then she watched it with me and she understood.  So, if you're looking for that horrifying film to chill you to the bone then find something else to watch, but if you want a good time that is sure to gross you out as much as make you laugh then sink your teeth into this film with reckless abandon.",1193788800,14,3047,4.3052631578947365
1948967,4,B0000VCZNE,"""Cabin Fever"" is not a film to take seriously. Anyone grousing over the inane plotting and the occasional descents into weirdness for the sake of weirdness has completely missed the point of this movie. It's a joke. That's pretty much the only thing you need to realize going in: the whole movie, from the expediently rotten dog to the front porch dance finale, is a big, twisted joke.

Director Eli Roth plays light and swift with genre conventions in this seemingly typical screamfest about some kids, some rednecks, and some flesh-eating virus. Explanations are unwanted for where the virus came from, why the kid at the county store yells ""Pancakes!"", and what rednecks are doing holding hip-hop hoedowns on the front porch, or what either of the last two points has to do with the protagonists' encounter with the virus. Eli Roth has seen too many horror movies of dubious quality to care whether or not his burgoo of a movie coheres; he knows it doesn't need to. After all, the source material doesn't.

This leaves one (big) question: why would anyone make one of the goriest, most visually unsettling, most skillfully constructed horror movies of recent vintage an elaborate joke? Roth is not merely an ironist; he is a satirist, and he fully intends to assault the audience with an unsettling premise: everyone alive is just a little bit despicable, a little bit dumb, or both. In fact, everyone is just despicable enough that his or her death may be unsettling to a viewer only insofar as it might resemble the viewer's own potential demise. Maybe the enmity you inspired in the locals during your recent vacation was deserved; maybe your enmity toward those same locals was equally deserved.

If this unpleasant hypothesis was the only principle undergirding ""Cabin Fever,"" it would be very nearly an unwatchable film; it's that visually and conceptually unpleasant. However, Roth also seems to believe that all human life is more than a little absurd. To the end of conveying this, he  locates the exact line along which comedy and horror converge- the establishment and building of tension- and manipulates it so that every big scare is simultaneously a big joke. Black comedy is a work which is constructed just as would be a serious work, but comic timing and overt absurdity render potentially serious, even disturbing moments comic. It is in this technique that Roth excels, both here and in ""Hostel,"" the instant classic anti-torture torture movie.

""Cabin Fever,"" however, is not quite a classic. Even if the film is taken as a comedy, its non sequiturs are still incongruent, if necessarily so, and its general apathy is disheartening. Roth is both cannier and more bold in his follow-up, ""Hostel,"" which stages a similar, but critically opposite, coup.",1193184000,,2773,4.95483870967742

1948979,2,B0000VCZNE,"Cabin Fever has a weirdly unique place in the recent horror movies in that it's not completely part of that ""torture porn"" crop of movies that focus mainly on disgusting audiences than outright terrifying them. Cabin Fever on the other hand wants to be a horror film like seen a lot during the 70's. Problem is the film has an identity crisis in that it doesn't know what it wants to be. A funny horror movie? A scary comedy? Sometimes that dual personality works but here it feels too disjointed...plus it's kinda bad too.

Taking the familiar theme of a group of teenagers into the woods, you'd think some mask-toting killer with stalk ever so slowly after them right? Wrong. Turns out, the cool guy and the sex bomb, the awkward teen and the sweet chick and a lunkhead have to deal with a flesh-eating disease, a rabid dog and weird locals. You know, the usual.

That's pretty much the plot in a nutshell. Granted, it's nice to see a new killer wiping out the kiddies but even then, it's still a little thin. Not to mention these are some of the illogical choice-making kids ever and in the horror genre, that's seriously saying something. One character, the sweet guy, decides to fondle the object of his desires since grade 8...while she's sleeping. Yes, that's right, sleeping. And when said girl has to be sheltered off somewhere, he decides to have sex with the sex bomb. Figures he might as well get in some sex since he knows he's going to die anyway. Or maybe he's just dumb.

The disjointed feel comes in the way of humor adding in. There's the infamous ""pancakes"" scene that feels like it should be in a parody of bad kung fu movies then horror. Was it meant to lighten the tension? Or is it just simply trying to be a funny movie mixed in with the gore stuff to set it apart from serious ilk such as High Tension. Either make it a straight ahead horror comedy like Army of Darkness or go completely for the horror.

Like Hostel, the DVD is loaded with more commentaries than anything. And of course, writer/director Eli Roth is everywhere with a track by himself, with the girls, the guys, Rider Strong who's so gabby he needs his own track and a filmmaker commentary. But that don't mean anything if it's attached to a good movie and in this case, it's all for naught.

I don't know if a horror fan will completely love it. From Saw to Shining, Cabin Fever is just somewhere else. Don't mean unique means quality either.",1183248000,,2435,4.487584650112867

1948982,2,B0000VCZNE,"Not a good horror movie.

Cabin Fever, the story of teens who waste away from a flesh-eating bacteria while camping in the woods, sounded like it might have the potential to be a sort of ground-breaker. A slasher film where the ""slasher"" is disease? Tons of interesting possibilites, there. Sadly, this movie doesn't follow any of the cool new roads it had open to it, instead relying on the same tired formulas we've already seen a thousand times. Worse, though, is that none of those formulas really work in this movie, either. This isn't just cliche; it's cliche done poorly.

One of the basic problems Cabin Fever suffers from is this: the Stupid Teens of this film are only camping. It's not like they're in some remote jungle of South America or anything, so it's hard to understand how they can all waste away from a disease, since 1) they have a car, 2) there are plenty of other people around, 3) they know about the disease, and want to leave the campsite and 4) the disease takes some time to take over and has obvious symptoms.

So: how do we keep those Stupid Teens at the camp, despite the fact that they're being ravaged by a disease? By making them Extra-Super Stupid! Also, by coming up with a series of contrived coincidences and happenings to delay and deter their efforts to leave. And so, the kids manage to shoot up their own car (even then, it's still basically operable, but never mind that); there's a mean dog that they're afraid of, discouraging them from going outside; the local deputy is a dimwit party boy, and thus is no help; the town locals are Deliverance-style, and so actually scarier (and more villainous) than the disease is; the teens accidentally offend the other backwoods people in various ways.

It's just all... silly, when they could just, you know... drive away to a city or something and get help. But they don't do that, because the characters don't want to get in their ""diseased car"" and so they stay in the (healthy?) cabin in the (healthy?) woods.

In the end, and sadly, the disease just makes for a poor villain. Disease can't chase someone. It can't jump out from behind a corner. It can't hide in a closet. So, instead of the disease threatening our Teens, we need all sorts of other, contrived things to provide our suspense and death-sequences. Almost no-one in this movie dies of the disease--instead, they're accidentally killed by others, or shot by local yokels, or hit by cars, or mauled by dogs, etc. The diesase is just what makes everyone act like (more of) an idiot.

Except for Masque of the Red Death, Cabin Fever is the only disease-centered horror story I can think of. The idea has a lot of potential, but Cabin Fever takes advantage of none of it, instead relying on the same horror movie conventions that we've seen for almost thirty years. That would be okay if they were done well; they're not--the events in this movie feel contrived and corny and there's no real suspense or fright to be found. A complete disappointment.

Two stars.",1170288000,2,3012,4.639774859287054
1948983,5,B0000VCZNE,"Thsi is honestly a very interesting movie.  It's bleak existentialism and punk rock outlook on vanity and death add a new wave sort of edge to the horror genre, and also a breath of fresh air (odd because of all the nods to it's predecessors) to a type of film that has left any sence of meaning behind.  This is the first film i have seen in this genre in several years, maybe more, that isn't just a monster/killer out to stab some horny teens.

Thi film does what the horror flicks were doing years ago; it takes the cookie cutter image (teens on vacation, horny, angsty, city brats getting lost and hunted down) and it adds the color, the themes, the metaphore.

i would never go so far as to say that this is an art film by any stretch, but it is not a dumb one either and that needs to be respected.  it is a well made, run-of-the-mill that got that extra bit of care that horror has been missing for so long.",1164326400,2,915,4.176136363636363
1948984,4,B0000VCZNE,"Written and directed by Eli Roth, who was responsible for this year's hostel - Cabin Fever was made for a mere 1.5 million dollars and went on to gross over 100 million dollars, not bad for a first effort. It is basically a tribute to the horror genre from the 70's and 80's with intentional rip-offs all throughout. Humerous at times and not very scary at all, it tells the story of 5 college graduates who embark on a camping trip in the woods, who then encounter a vagrant contaminated with a deadly virus. After a sequence of events, the local water supply is contaminated by the same virus, unbeknownst to the 5 campers. When one of the 5 accidentally drink the water, the flesh eating virus quickly shows its symptons on the victim causing the friends to panic and turn on one another in a desperate attempt to keep from contracting the virus themselves. Stranded in the woods with a broken down car, it suddenly becomes every man (or woman) for themselves.
The story may sound simple, and while it is, it is entertaining enough to keep the audience engaged for 89 minutes. The young cast was well chosen with solid performances by both James DeBello (from swimfan and Scary movie 2) and Jordan Ladd (Never been kissed) exceptional. Director Eli Roth also makes a cameo as he does in Hostel.
I give the story 3 stars, the acting 4 stars and the movie making 5 stars. This is the best example of outstanding movie making in a horror movie I have witnessed for a long time. The cinematography is excellent, so is the music score and the editing. Roth is right up there with Wes Craven and John Carpenter in the same genre in movie making. The special features are also excellent with a good commentary, teasers and trailer, an entertaining 'making of', a Q&A session with Eli Roth, 3 animations and hidden features as well.
This is not just a movie for stoned teenagers, it will appeal to all fans of the horror genre, especially those who appreciate exceptional movie making. The gore factor is what got me hooked in the first place, while it is not the goriest film ever made, over 200 litres of fake blood were used to make the movie.",1162512000,2,2141,4.534883720930233

A good splasher film is fine if there's a reason for it, say as in Hostel. But here, I think they do it just for effect and that's the wrong reason.

Now let's talk about the kid sitting on the bench at the corner store. Was he really neccesary. The only reason I can see having him in there was to create a situation where the kids in the cabin have locals with guns after them on top of being melted by the virus.

Could skip this one and not have missed anything.",1162252800,,608,3.9754098360655736
1948986,3,B0000VCZNE,"This movie is not for anyone who's looking for a strong plot, credible logic, sensible decisions or good acting. It is, however, for anyone who likes gore. Gore is served up in buckets -- almost literally, mind you -- as skins peels and bubbles and scabs, blood flows and spatters, panicked people do violent and panicky things to each other, and a dog snacks messily on one or two of the stars, up to and including eating a girl's lips.

I'd mention any standout performances if there were any of note, but overall the acting is uniformly mediocre (except for a party-hearty member of local law enforcement, who was really, really bad). Kudos to tbe boys in props and makeup, however, for creating some very convincing skin problems. Director Eli Roth deserves mention, too -- not for his direction, mind you, nor for his cameo appearance as a local stoner, but for seemingly having so much fun making the film. He, the cast and crew seemed rather like kids hosting their own haunted house -- the quality was questionable, but they had fun doing it.

1948997,3,B0000VCZNE,"""Cabin Fever"" is an improvement over ""Hostel"", even though this film was first. Here, we atleast more gore than what we see in the other film. I'm also glad that they didn't have gore just to have gore, but it was part of the story. The story came together and was a little better than ""Hostel"" over all.

The acting was good, and the special effects were equally as good. The bad parts are that some things are stolen from other films and the movie really does start to drag towards the end of the movie. The last 20 minutes of the film could have been cut out. By the end, I found myself bored and wondering when the movie was going to be over. There is only so much of this movie you can take before it just gets boring. I also didn't like the rip off of ""Night of the Living Dead"". If you have seen the original ""Night of the Living Dead"" and how it ends, then you would have seen one of the final scenes of this movie. The people on this film also kept throwing up blood, which was very familiar to the people on 28 Days Later, another film that is much better than this.

Overall, the movie is ok. It is better than ""Hostel"", but just barely. When I saw barely, I mean it, both are not that good.

1949001,4,B0000VCZNE,"I resisted seeing Cabin Fever (2002) initially as their seemed to be quite a lot of puffed up publicity around it (both Quentin Tarantino and Peter Jackson gave enthusiastic endorsements), but had I known Cerina Vincent (Maya, the Yellow Power Ranger) appeared sans her top...oh mama...in the movie I probably wouldn't have waited some four odd years to watch it...I make no excuses for my fondness of looking at hot women nekkid other than the fact that I'm a dude and this is a trait ingrained in all dudes unless the dude is into other dudes, which is fine by me as it means all the more ladies for yours truly, but I digress...co-written, produced, and directed by Eli Roth (Hostel, Hostel: Part II, Cell), the film features Rider Strong (My Giant, ""Boy Meets World""), Jordan Ladd (Club Dread, Madhouse), James DeBello (Detroit Rock City, Swimfan), Cerina Vincent (""Power Rangers Lost Galaxy"", Devil on the Mountain), and Joey Kern (Lovewrecked).  Also appearing is Arie Verveen (Sin City) and Giuseppe Andrews (Independence Day, American History X, Detroit Rock City).

As the film begins we see some serious misfortune befall an idiot backwoods trapper/hermit (stupid is as stupid...well, you know)...anyway, following this we meet five college students embarking on a fantastic vacation getaway after the completion of their finals...there's Jeff (Kern), the blonde guy with the seriously receding hairline, his passionate (i.e. wet-n-wild) and curvaceous girlfriend Marcy (Vincent), Burt (DeBello), the loud-mouthed idiot of the group, and Paul (Strong), the uptight dude who's got a thing for Karen (Ladd), the skinny blonde (seems the pair have been friends since childhood, but Paul secretly wants show her the sausage).  After stopping for supplies, allowing us to experience the true hillbilly nature of the locals, the quartet head off into the deep woods, eventually locating a rather rustic cabin.  As Jeff and Marcy proceed to get it on (apparently Marcy can't go too long without a bit of the salami slam), Paul and Karen head to the lake for a swim, and Burt goes off to hunt varmints, eventually running into the trapper/hermit we saw in the beginning, who's not looking all that great (talk about being down with the sickness).  Anyway, a bunch of stuff happens and soon enough the trapper/hermit finds his way to the cabin, but given his condition our campers aren't inclined to provide hands on assistance (the guy is covered with open sores and spewing up blood...what the hell did he get into?).  After the group's ride gets trashed (the trapper/hermit tried to steal it), they chase him off good, but soon discover he may have left something behind in the form of a nasty, highly communicable virus/bacterium with a predilection for the flesh (eating it, that is)...

Overall I did enjoy this film as it seemed to be made by someone who has a great appreciation for the genre, so much so he borrowed from a number of different sources when making his feature, the most obvious to me being George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968), specifically a scene near the end which I won't detail, but if you've seen George's film along with this one, you'll know what I'm taking about...Cabin Fever may have lacked in a number of areas (cohesive script, likable characters, an even, forward flow of the plot), but the effort was there, along with a whole lot of blood.  This is a case where the truly stupid was mixed in with the entertaining, the result being sort of a half-baked project that will either come off really well or extremely poorly dependant on the viewer's expectations.  If you're looking for exceptional scripting, memorable performances (actually, Giuseppe Andrews as the cop who loved to party was pretty memorable), non-confusing or unexplained plot points, and a solid storyline then you probably need to go watch something else, but if your interested in visceral thrills, pull up a chair, cause Roth lays it on thick.  I learned a whole bunch of things while watching this film, including the following...

1. Never, ever sit next to Dennis (seriously, if the kid ever did to me what he did to Paul or Burt, I'd crush his skull, despite his knowing karate).

2. Burt, along with being a petty thief and a pyromaniac, can't shoot for spit and likes to get his dog involved while he's pulling his taffy.

3. Jordan Ladd (Cheryl Ladd's daughter) looks awesoma in her bikini underwear.

4. Deputy Winston (Andrews) knows where all the best parties are...

5. Marcy knows some interesting bedroom techniques.

6. That guy Grim has about the biggest bag of weed I've ever seen.

7. Never drink anything from lemonade stands run by kids.

8. Best not to shave your legs if you're infected with a flesh eating bacterium.

9. It's all right to engage in the horizontal bedroom boogie despite the fact a highly communicable disease is floating around as long as you douse your privates with Listerine mouthwash afterwards (that burning sensation means it's working).

10. Marcy's got to have it.

11. Joey Kern and Rider Strong should be extremely thankful for their roles in this film as both got to hang with a topless Power Ranger with an amazing rack.

12. Hillbillies don't take kindly to having diseased strangers running about (picture the mob scene in Frankenstein, only less sophisticated).

13. Best to leave the dead where they lie (or float), and not poke at them with sticks.

The most unsettling part in the movie for me involved Rider Strong's character (can you possible have a more porno sounding name?) spooning up with Karen, who was quite the tease by the way...anyway, she's feeling under the weather and allows him to get into bed with her (no hanky panky mind you), and then once she's asleep he begins to fondle her up good...I've done a lot of things in my life, but I've never groped someone in their sleep like some kind of skeevy perv...in another scene we see Strong's character trying to get help from the neighbors only to get caught peeping into a bedroom window at a woman laying nekkid on a bed.  I can't fault him too much he as I might have done the same if it wasn't for the fact that some of my friends were dying horribly and in need medical assistance as soon as possible.  As far as the performances here, there seemed to be two modes throughout, normal and spaz (spaz mode, along with the histrionics, included the extensive use of profanity...I heard the word f**k so many times it's lost all meaning for me).  Two aspect of the movie annoyed me, the first being the music.  Some of it worked, but a lot of it didn't...Roth might have eclectic tastes in music, but perhaps showing it off here wasn't the best idea...the second aspect was the needless filler sequences...off the top of my head there's a bowling alley/serial killer bit and another with the director himself making an appearance in a completely pointless role who's seemingly only intent was to put himself into his own movie.  Ah well, since this is Roth's first film, I cut him some slack, but I am interested in seeing his follow up called Hostel as I think he's got a lot of potential as long as he doesn't get his full on ego on after some early success.

The picture, presented in anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1), looks very clean and the audio, available in both Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround and Surround 2.0 comes across very well.  There's a healthy inclusion of extra features including five, count `em five full length commentary tracks, a featurette titled Beneath the Skin: The Making of Cabin Fever, a family version and a Chick-Vision of the film, three episodes from Roth's The Rotten Fruit animated show, a karate demonstration bit titled `Pancakes!', English and Spanish subtitles, an original theatrical trailer for the film, along with previews for The Job (2003) and Serial Killing 101 (2004).  Also thrown in are a few Easter Eggs (hidden features), one of them found by going to the chapter selection screen, highlighting the 19-21 chapters, and waiting a few minutes...all in all I've give the film three stars, plus one extra for the entertaining DVD features.

Entirely two different subjects, ""Cabin"" takes the viewer to a desolate place (as does Hostel).  All the characters develop a skin disorder (which is not that scary), and then the movie goes from there.  The thing I like about Eli Roth's movies is the characters and the character development.  I think that is one of his strong points and I would watch any movie he puts out because of this.  ""Cabin Fever"" had some magic but it was a juvenile attempt at making a ""horror"" flick"". It mixed horror with some comedy and that was it's strong points.  It has some funny quotes and the end was unlike typical horror movies.  On a critical film standpoint, I give Eli Roth the director props for a good looking film with some substance and I think he has potential for future movies.",1150848000,4,1039,4.603260869565218

Not often do you find cinema's typical unfortunate teenage circumstance to NOT have a psycho wielding an axe or some other weapon of choice. The enemy in this film is entirely different, but equally horrifying. The originality of this horror film's plot raises its viewing value. I think the movie should have been a little longer. Its subject matter would definitely hold a viewer's attention. Some more character development would have also drawn in the audience. However, I've seen the movie more than once and it keeps me tense every time.

1949008,4,B0000VCZNE,"`Cabin Fever' is Eli Roth's (lately the writer / director of `Hostel) first horror movie which made a splash at the film festivals, not unlike the first film (`Clerks') of fellow independent, Kevin Smith. It is also far better than the first film (`Last House on the Left') of current horror flick master, Wes Craven.

It is totally expected that since the film was done on a relatively small budget, the high quality would be found not in the special effects or marquee level actors as in important films such as `The Exorcist' or `The Shining', but in the script and in the realization of that script. I can't resist the bad pun in saying that the quality of the movie is a lot more than skin deep.

Without the intelligent script and capable acting and directing, the movie becomes not much more than a garden variety `Friday, the Thirteenth' copy, when, in fact, it's a pretty fair borrowing of a cross between the basic premise of `The Stand' and the local ambiance of `Deliverance'. In spite of all those good genes, the strongest quality of the movie is a grisly humor that far surpasses the boffo hi-jinx of broad parodies such as the `Scary Movie' series.

Another similarity to Kevin Smith on this DVD is Roth's ample commentaries, even on this relatively simple movie, with a story that seems to need far less explication than the somewhat deeper and more serious `Hostel'. But we benefit, in that it automatically makes the rewatchability quotient jump to an initial five, as there are five commentary tracks. This is even better than Smiths usual two or three.

One thing we learn from the many commentary tracks is the depth to which the director and cinematographer played around with the photographic techniques, using options which I am not surprised to find in major Hollywood works such as `Network', but which seem to be a remarkable dedication to craft from this very independent crew. Most of the details are beyond me, but the trick seems to lay with using film with different amounts of silver nitrate in successive reels, giving each reel a darker and darker aspect.

While there is not as much skin and soft core porn in general in this movie compared to `Hostel', there is some, and in an odd way, it is put to a much better use in this movie. First off, unlike the `Friday, the Thirteenth' series, it is a lot more likely to see sex, at least the heavy breathing, getting to third base kind of sex among two teenaged couples in an isolated cabin than we see in the more conventional flicks. Even better, the initial grisly discovery of the very bloody skin infection, the `fever' in `Cabin Fever' during a run from second to third base by one of our young lads, while working on a somnambulant female. The best thing about this event is that the script prepares us for it by giving us a clue to which the characters are totally unaware.

While this movie is a hoot, much funnier in places than virtually all run of the mill horror movies, it is not quite as scary as `Hostel' or even `Deliverance' for that matter, where everything seems all to possible. In spite of the clever technical elements in the photography and the excellent characterizations (for a genre B movie), the movie is still a bit on the crude side, especially with shot making and editing. I got the sense that the director was constrained by budget and did not do a lot of retakes.

There is a `making of' documentary, the most interesting item on which involved the casting of the dog. The first choice was an older, rather arthritic pit bull mongrel looking fellow who would just as soon make friends as run down a fellow cast member with a constant snarl. This little glitch cost the crew a whole day of shooting. Their second choice, a rather lithe German Shepherd filled the role so well, they could not do shots with the dog and a human cast member on camera at the same time.

If you are a horror film fan and you are not familiar with this movie yet, get it. If you like the movie already, get it anyway, since the extras are worth the price of admission.",1145491200,4,4062,4.554794520547945

Big deal. Not shocking enough to gross out horror fans or even hold their attention. The characters are all annoying and I actually found myself glad when they all were dead by the end of the film.

At some parts of the film you can really catch yourself with your mouth wide open in shock. I am not an easily shocked person since I have been watching FAR too many horror movies in all my life, but this was such a sweet fresh twist!

Basic premise - young, horny adults go into woods, get a disease, turn against each other & die. Not one original idea here. Not one good performance. Not one believable moment of people acting like real human beings. And there is one character in the group that is gratingly annoying, to the point that you wonder why he has friends, why he was invited along on this trip in the woods and why the director continually allows him to negatively steal the movie. Only two redeeming aspects are the hot brunette shows some skin, and there was a germ on an idea here - whether a commentary on the AIDS epidemic, or maybe environmental issues - all that got edited out apparently, leaving us with this mess. Also, the early use of the 'N' word, out of nowhere and for no other reason than to shock, is gratuitous and disquieting.

As a movie fan, it troubles me that people actually liked this movie, as there is nothing worthwhile about it.

1949020,4,B0000VCZNE,"Judging from the highly mixed reviews here, I assume that most people watching this movie are either very amused by the comedic aspects of the film or disgusted at its shortcomings, as well as the fact that Eli Roth has hit the big time as of late- or maybe just pleasantly distracted by Cerina Vincent's chest. In any regard, I can remember feeling very puzzled after watching this movie for the first time on DVD. At the closing scene, where the gray haired shop owner reveals himself to be a friend to the black man, which was immediately followed by a jump cut to a collection of hicks trying to play bluegrass, I distinctively remember turning to my girlfriend dumbfounded. 'What did we just watch?'. I soon forgot about Cabin Fever. After months of being aired on HBO however, I've come to really appreciate this movie for what it is- highly derivative to the point of paying obvious homage to past classics (slow motion sequence of Vincent's character walking towards stranger's home an obvious nod to an identical scene in TCSM 1), surprisingly competent and effective in its campiness (bowling ball slasher scene), and of course, very stupid ('The PARTY man!'). The Deputy Winston character is hilarious, and very quote worthy. In short, Cabin Fever was far more original, interesting and memorable than a slew of other contemporary horror films that either boringly and poorly rehash old classics or attempt to create new ones by engaging in high level gore, to little affect.

1949040,3,B0000VCZNE,"Not quite.  Actually, not even close.  ""Evil Dead 2"" is the ""holy grail of horror"", as Eli Roth, the director of ""Cabin Fever"", refers to it.  It is a low budget film with mostly sub-par acting that manages to captivate the audience.  In spite of everything working against it, ""Evil Dead 2"" has a masterful mix of humor, heart, and terror.

""Cabin Fever"" has the heart, but is missing other elements to make it gel perfectly.  I'm going to address a few mild SPOILERS in the rest of this paragraph, so skip ahead if you haven't seen the movie and want to view it with virgin eyes.  The biggest drawback with ""Cabin Fever"" is that it's all set up, and there's no pay off.  The way that the music works, and the way that the shots are set up (self admitted by the director) ""borrow"" from many other horror movies.  I don't have a problem with that, but if you're going to use shots and music cues from ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Dead By Dawn"", then make it pay off.  Here's the spoiler, which the viewer learns early on.  The big bad guy in the movie is a flesh eating virus spread by the drinking water, among other methods.  At the same time, the REAL bad guy in the film is ""human nature"".  Here's my problem.  All these ""horror"" movies without any actual horror in them.  On the commentary track Eli talks about how horror movies are the pariah films in the movie industry, and then he makes a horror movie without any psychopaths, demons, serial killers, zombies, etc.  In other words, in my opinion, he played it safe.  He sets up that there's something sinister or underhanded happening, but nothing ever happens.  The bad guy is human nature.  The problem with that is, if human nature is going to be its own worse enemy, and the plot device bases the horror in ""reality"", then the characters in film need to react to situations realistically.  If this film needs to be based in reality, then why do certain characters start attacking and killing others?  It doesn't really make sense in terms of the plot.

So, why should you see this film?  If you listen to the commentary track, you know that the movie was an effort of love.  Eli Roth was trying really hard to make a horror movie like those that inspired him.  He loves the horror genre.  This is the first film he ever made, so it's a little understandable that the movie isn't perfect.  Speaking of the commentary track, if you are a young aspiring director, then even if you don't like horror, the commentary track is very informative.

If audiences want more horror, then they need to support more low budget and unknown directors who make movies like this.  Support is the only way that studios and producers will want to back these movies.  Though this movie is terribly flawed in the plot, it still has a few good scares, and works on a ""thriller"" level.

I really feel sorry for the director of this film. He doesn't realize his own short comings if he thinks he made a hit here. And the ending with the black teenagers showing up was possible the worst, most stupidiest scene in movie history.

This movie's not even good enough to use as a book end. Don't, for the love of all things sacred, buy this garbage!",1130889600,3,497,4.4021739130434785
1949042,3,B0000VCZNE,"School buddies Paul (Rider Strong), Karen (Jordan Ladd), Bert (James DeBello), Marcy (Cerina Vincent) and Jeff (Joey Kern) rent out a remote log cabin in the forest so that they can earn some time off together only to find a man with a deadly disease who sets off a chain of disturbing and gross events as some of them contract this flesh-eating virus their true feelings for each other and their real personalities materialize as they toil to stay alive from the illness and more importantly...each other!

Eli Roth is going to be a good director... and that is why you should watch Cabin Fever, not because it is a great horror film (it isn't), not because the acting is on flying form (it is barely there), not because the special effects kick ass (you could do them with whatever is in your fridge), but because there is always something good about watching some kids actually put something together than it is little original or has not been done before, and in that respect illness as the monster is quite effective in that it is done Evil Dead style, not to say that it is as good as the Evil Dead (it does not even come close) but has the same overall feel, but is more funny... in fact Cabin Fever is very funny most of the time.

Yes this film is boxed like an Evil Dead movie and yes there are connections (Kids stuck in cabin in the woods with a 'force' after them), but it does try a few new tricks. Probably the infamous razor in the bathtub scene is the stealer and there are little gems in the movie worth watching for a director in a making.

Just make sure that this is what you want to watch before you rent or buy it. It is one of the better horror around and IMO is a lot better than My Little Eye. However you are strongly advised to make your way over to the Evil Dead series before you try this one.",1130284800,6,1823,4.278260869565218
1949043,1,B0000VCZNE,"Anyone who has read my review for Uwe Boll's ""Alone In The Dark"" will remember that I compared the unenviable task of sitting through that piece of human waste to having each and every hair on your arm pulled out. Well, take that analogy a step further with this irredeemable gutter trash and try to imagine the pain of getting your teeth extracted without novacaine. Do that, and you'll have a general idea of what Eli Roth's ""Cabin Fever"" is all about.

I never believed any one film was capable of topping the sheer agonizing dreck that Uwe Boll cranks out as the ""worst film ever made."" But, in all honesty, I have to say ""Cabin Fever"" comes very close. This is yet another sad excuse for a motion picture that had absolutely no valid reason to meet with any form of theatrical release. For somebody who claims to love the horror genre as much as Eli Roth does, he has created the single most annoying and convoluted patchwork of a movie I think I have ever seen in my entire life. How do you screw up a story like this? Think of the potential this plot would have had without the poorly written characters, without the bad writing, and without all that unnecessary and unfunny comedy. A movie dealing with a grotesque flesh-eating virus could and should have been so much better than what Roth dished out for us here. This script failed on so many levels with me. And, while I do not doubt the evident talent this director possesses, I do know that he fumbled the ball big time on an idea that could very well have redefined the horror genre.

To say this was a production of missed opportunities would indeed be a gross play on words. A generous amount of blood and unsettling special effects can't even save it, and that is one element I normally go for. There really was nothing about ""Cabin Fever"" that I could easily recommend to anybody. When three quarters of the crowd walks out of the theater halfway through, you know the movie is sinking fast. My best advice to those reading this would be to simply rent before purchasing. One viewing was more than enough for me to know that I will most likely never bother with it again.",1129507200,8,2139,4.468030690537084

No one really understands why Dennis is screaming about pancakes before he leaps off and takes a bite out of Burt, but if you watch carefully when Rider Strong's character is being wheeled through the hospital at the very end, he catches a glimpse of an eerie character in a passing hospital room, dressed as a giant rabbit, serving a heaping plate-full of pancakes to no other than, yes, little Dennis. Aww, one last treat before he rots away on his hospital bed. hahahaha

A bunch of kids go to the woods and drink some polluted water and get this flesh eating disease that also makes you vomit lots of blood, thats the plot. They all die one by one.

This movie is very good in its own way, not now and never will be a classic just a good decent horror movie with lots of blood and a pretty creepy story. The acting is not bad so thats not a problem. I brought this from best buy (when I was purchasing the ""Blind Dead  Collection"")with a price tag of $9.99 and when purchased it rang for $6.99 which is even nicer and more of a reason to own it. This is just your regular run of the mill better than avg horror movie.

I wouldnt pay more than $10 for it but being between the prices of $5-$10 it is way worth it and a nice little piece to have in a horror collection.

1949046,4,B0000VCZNE,"I had heard this was a good film, and after having watched it I can see why it was highly recommended to me, but all in all, I just never warmed up to CABIN FEVER.  People talk about the unlikeableness of its main characters, that's just part of the problem, but it is a problem, because after all, how can you get emotionally involved in the lives of people you don't really care for?

Bert was the worst, and yet you found yourself rooting for him to live when finally he commandeered the truck and drove away from the cabin towards the general store.  There he meets the ""Pancakes!"" boy and gets a nasty shock.  The surreal scenes didn't annoy me as they seem to have annoyed many viewers, but on the other hand they weren't especially well done either.  Take the scene where the boys stumble onto the woman who's butchering her hogs and complaining about their poor quality.  What was the point of that?  Though even such a lame scene was redeemed, sort of, when the boys spot a familiar face among the family portraits on the women's knick-knack table--it was Henry, the hermit they mutilated, and the woman says it was her cousin!

The best part of the film is its utter unpredictability, for you literally don't know what is going to happen from minute to minute.  That alone sets it above most Hollywood (and independent) movies, which depend on familiarity for response.  In addition, filmmaker Eli Roth generates some screen heat from both his good-looking couples, and he also brings in another stud, goofy deputy Giuseppe Andrews, who underneath the party-hearty giggle and wobbly bike mannerisms, is a stunningly good looking guy and who should have been nominated for an Oscar here for best scene-stealer of 2002.",1127865600,3,1727,4.707641196013289

It's a mix of many bad horror movies and mister George A. Romero's movies. I think they made the screenplay in a weekend - and the movie -,  because the dialogue it's bad, the actin, no comments.

Not that anybody will ever read this review, since nobody will want to buy this stinker, but a group of college kids take a trip to a secluded wooded retreat. One of the doofuses decides to head into the woods to shoot squirrels, and encounters a man who looks like he is covered in pizza sauce. Nobody explains where this disease came from. Later in the movie, Pizza Man shows up at the kids' cabin, and they burn him alive when he won't leave. His dead body ends up in the water supply, which is where the cabin's water is drawn from. One by one, they all get sick, and die in different ways. It's not even scary.

I wondered often during this horrid piece of crap if the movie was intended to be this bad. If so, then well done.

1949071,4,B0000VCZNE,"Cabin Fever is a movie that after viewing it you feel kinda sick. That's probably because Cabin Fever is an exremely gory, extremely violent movie. What makes this movie even more well scary is that the first half is actually funny. But once the ill fated Karen realizes she has been infected with a disease that causes terrible rashes, and causes you to spontaneously puke blood. Her friends can't do anything because their car was trashed the previous night by a crazy guy who appeared to have the disease as well.

The rest don't want to catch the disease, and they have to save their friend, but it's not going to be that easy. There's a crazy dog that's lurking in the woods, and they have no idea who might have the disease. A change of pace for horror movies though. Cabin Fever is actually smart, considering it concerns a bunch of college kids who party in a secluded forest location. That's a reason why I like this movie. It actually makes sense, and the characters are actually [gasp] smart! I know smart characters in a horror movie may seem strange, but it is one of the reasons why Cabin Fever is such a good movie.  This movie more than earns it R rating. With gruesome deaths and spewing blood, sex, nudity, and lots of swearing Cabin Fever is not for the kids.

Another thing, the ending just makes this movie seem way more disturbing.

Rated R: Strong violence and gore, sex, nudity, strong language, grusesomeness in general.

1949072,3,B0000VCZNE,"This is a movie that I didn't give a fair chance to at the beginning.  It was marketed as the next best horror movie, the ""horror film horror films have been waiting for.""  So, when I saw this movie in the theatre, I was firstly disappointed.  I laughed more than I jumped or was creeped out.

At the core, it's a disgustingly great fear the movie is working with.  A group of college students go to a house in the isolated woods to party (Evil Dead anyone?) and end up contracting some flesh-eating disease.  Paranoia and fear tear the group apart as they start turning on each other.  It's a great set up for a scary, no one trusts anyone, descent into madness.

But Eli Roth (the director and co-writer) doesn't necessarily take us down that path.  He infuses the story with very interesting characters like Dennis, the catatonic, bite you if you come too close, blonde kid, a cop who calls the main protagonist ""party man,"" the stoner who says ""ooooh, faced,"" and other equally funny characters.  In fact, the movie becomes more of a campy fun ride than a ""serious"" horror film.

And I think it's this dichotomy that confused and irritated me to begin with.  When everyone is saying this is the horror film us fans have been waiting for, I was expecting a horrific film.  Instead, it was campy.  So, in my opinion, problem number one was the marketing of it.  Also, Peter Jackson calls it the best horror film of the year...and then I realized that Peter Jackson is also known for Dead Alive, a wickedly funny zombie movie that is one of the goriest movies I've seen.  Cabin Fever is alot like Dead Alive and if you enjoyed Dead Alive, I think you would enjoy this movie.  After starting to realize the connection, I had a better respect for Cabin Fever.

Immediately leaving the theatre, I would have given this movie a 1 star review.  However, almost 3 years later, my friends and I are still quoting the movie.  Whether it's Dennis shouting ""Pancakes!"" and doing slow-motion karate kicks, blond mullet flopping all the while, before chomping into a character's hand or the stoner guy dragging his hand down his face while saying, ""ooooh, faced!"" we are constantly quoting it.  I guess if a movie is able to stick in your mind even three years later, it can't be as bad as we once thought.  A masterpiece of the genre, it's not.  But, I'd recommend checking this movie out once more and give it one more chance.  Look at it not as the ""scariest horror movie ever"" but as a campy fun time (with some genuinely disgusting moments) and I think you will be pleasantly surprised.

It takes a special person to really enjoy this movie. A sick twisted person with a love of satirical wit and an appreciation for the type of effort put into making a film such as this.

Number one, The movie is Supposed to be funny. So none of that ""Oh, man this movie is ridiculous...It's not scary at all"" No it isn't scary. It's gross. It's hillarious. But it's not scary, don't even buy the movie with that notion in your head.

Number two, the story has plot holes. It goes way over the top in realm of 'unlikely'. But look, it isn't a psychological thriller. Yeah the kids are stupid, the sex is gratuitous, and the acting is exaggerated; but again I stress, it is Supposed to be. It's fun, you go along for the ride with these stupid kids and watch them deteriorate from irritating - to dispicable, then you get to see them get whats coming to them, it's great!

1949102,1,B0000VCZNE,"Worse than wasting my money at the theater, worse than wasting my money on a rental, I wasted my money by buying this crappy movie on DVD.  This movie brings absolutely nothing to the campy/slasher/horror genre that's original, and its ""respectful"" nods to other successful movies in the genre fall flat and are disgraceful.  This is another example of why you shouldn't listen to the mainstream industry critics.  They praised this movie and it came with above average reviews.  Honestly I haven't been this disgusted since the movie ""Ghost Ship"".

Anyway, if you haven't figured it out yet.  This movie is about five teenage/college aged kids who go on a camping trip to a secluded cabin in some redneck infested woods.  By the way, I feel that true rednecks out the there have a legimate shot at a lucrative lawsuit for the way this movie portrays them.  Continuing, a hermit stumbles into the camp with a gross skin/lung disease and all hell brakes loose after that.  Nothing and I mean nothing in this movie is belivable, coherant or entertaining.  The characters freakout and panic to the point of ridiculousness.  In any horror movie the characters are expected to make a dumb mistake or two.  Mistakes that you see coming and you wish you could slap some sense into character, but this movie would leave a nub on the end of your arm if you tried to keep up with the mistakes.

The only thing that I could remotely praise about this movie is the acting job by the main characters which wasn't too bad.  Other than that the plot/theme was unoriginal, the gore was at ridiculously pointless levels, the support characters (IE rednecks) are cursed with the worst dialogue I could ever imagine, any ""respectful"" nod to the great existing movies out there and/or any of the tried-and-true cliches are horribly managed, and the attempt at humor and jokes reflect the mind of a very twisted and weird individual (whoever the screenwriter is), at the very least the person would have to be the lamest nerd ever.

In conclusion, the movie as a whole tries to be a blatant nod to Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series, but in more ways than can be imaginably possible it fails.  I could grab a couple of friends and a camcorder and come up with better amateur content than this movie has.  Maybe that's why big studios should leave the campy horror genre to the amateurs who made it good and fun to begin with.",1105574400,10,2398,4.657957244655582
1949103,2,B0000VCZNE,"The trick in any horror flick is that it must provide the audience with characters to care about so that when they eventually get killed, it adds more of an anticipation and suspense to the plot.  In CABIN FEVER, there are no salvagable qualities in any of the five leads --- Five pre-adults (Two Girls and Three Guys) retreat to the woods of a small hick town for a little cabin camping ---.  Therefore, not only is the audience waiting for the characters to get killed, the audience WANTS them to be killed. This reviewer was turned off by the gun-toting, squirrel killing, muscle-head,Bert played annoyingly by James DeBello.  When asked by his fellow campers why he would want to kill squirrels, Bert's response is,""Because they're gay!"".  This attempt at homophobic humor is rampant during the course of the film (Not that there is anything wrong with that!) but it isn't funny in any of the context used in the film. Once the characters' brash and thoughtless personalities and attitudes are established at the beginning of the film, it's all down hill from there. How they die? Well the title says it all. They are taken over by a skin eating virus and go medieval on each other.  However, for all the audience cares, they could be killed by a knife weilding slasher and it wouldn't make a difference as long as they do die. Overall, a film devoid of any redeeming qualities..especially with the characters.",1104883200,,1414,4.7317073170731705
1949114,5,B0000VCZNE,"After seeing ""Wrong Turn"", I didn't have any doubts about seeing ""Cabin Fever"". One of the primary reasons I saw ""Wrong Turn"" was because I was familiar with, and liked most of the actors (or actresses) in the movie, and that was a similar with this movie. James DeBello (Detroit Rock City, 100 Girls) has been hilarious in every movie I've seen him in, and Ryder Strong was on Boy Meets World, so you gotta love him. The other actors I wasn't that familiar with, but I decided to see the movie anyway, and let me tell you I'm glad I saw this one.

""Cabin Fever"" is about a group of five friends (3 guys, 2 girls), who have just graduated from school, and now are going to the mountains for a camping trip in a cabin. However when they get there, there is a deadly virus on the loose, which is being contracted by a hobo who lives out in the woods. Bert (James DeBello) is the first to come into contact with the hobo, when he accidentally shoots him with a bee-bee gun, thinking he's a school. The hobo then trys to get Bert to help him, but Bert runs away. The Hobo then interrupts a bon-fire the group is having, and is accidentally set on fire, which for some sick twisted reason is very funny. Some way or another, his dead body ends up getting into the water system, and those anyone who drinks the water becomes infected. The girls both end being the first two to get it. When they find out that the disease is within them, Jordan Ladd (who was one of the pot smockers in ""Super Troopers"") then goes into hiding. It's pretty funny. Well as you may expect the disease eventually infects all of them (except Jordan Ladd). There's also some crazy group of rednecks running around (which seems to be the staple in horror movies right now) who are trying to kill the kids in the cabin. I don't want to spoil the plot if you haven't seen it, which is why I left a lot of holes. Please trust me there's a lot of good in this movie, and none of these reviews do it justice, it's another you need to see before writing off.

With a very likable and funny cast, and interesting (but totally unrealistic) storyline, and plenty of jokes and wild rednecks running around to entertain you, you should definitely check this movie out if you haven't seen it. Don't let others opinions sway yours, form your own. Especially if you liked other movies or shows the cast has been in, you'll like this one.",1104364800,9,2392,4.337053571428571
1949115,4,B0000VCZNE,"If you're looking for an artsy movie, a suspenseful thriller, or a shocking horror film with psychological twists, then you may leave.  Watching this, it should be pretty clear... nothing in this movie is supposed to be taken realistically.  Note, I didn't say seriously.  This isn't Scary Movie.  This seems more like, a horror movie on horror movies.

Here's the setup.  Bunch of good-looking, healthy, stereotypical college kids deep in the woods.  Bacteria in the water cause a disease that eats flesh.  The locals are all complete, oblivious, brain-dead, party animal, deadweights.  It becomes obvious pretty early on there isn't going to be any mercy.  Kids are trapped, they get to die horrendous deaths, and we get to kick back and watch, chuckling at every bad move they make as they attempt to save themselves, and cringing as they fail miserably.

If you haven't figured out that this is supposed to be somewhat silly, just take the infamous pancake scene.  An utterly random moment of stupidity that's really almost unsettling in its lack of point and purpose.  Looking at the cast, most of these youngsters seemed more involved in comedy than horror anyway, so I think that really says something about who the director was looking for.

There are plenty of throwbacks to the campy horror movies we loved or loathed in the past, but this is more of a parody on the genre, the perfect setup for an unstoppable gore fest that makes itself entertaining.  Contemporary and witty on its own right, I wouldn't recommend this to a lot of people.  Maybe if you liked Evil Dead.  Probably if you liked Shaun of the Dead.  Just don't expect to be scared out of your wits or to be seeing Scary Movie4.

Supposed homage to past horror films lacks originality flavor, though it has fun with it's gruesome blood soaked flesh virus scenes. There are some pretty and I mean pretty corny and dymb scenes in this movie as well, including a long blonde haired kid who jumps around and bites people with his rednecked hilbilly, shotgun slinging relatives and also it has a corny ending with the old man and the black guys....just corny. The only one to rise above the sloppy material is Rider Strong.  Also starring Giuseppe Andrews (Detroit Rock City), Robert Harris and Hal Courtney.

Is this supposed to be funny?  Or just make us dislike the characters?  All it makes me think is that the writers should have been a lot less lazy in writing this script, and come up with some real funny lines and characters rather than rendering every single one of the five-member main cast into a frat-house stereotype.

A shame, because when the film's shock sequences kick in, they're pretty effective.  Gross, yes, but effective in that Evil Dead kind of way.  And the ""shower shaving"" scene has to be one of the more disturbing horror sequences I've seen in a while, so the film does often deliver on a horror-film level.

But geez, the amount of juvenile dialogue and plot development you have to wade through the get there makes it little reward.  This film just doesn't have a good script.  Not only is it not funny, suffering from an inability to negotiate the tricky horror/comedy hybrid, but it seems to mash together ideas and scenes that have nothing to do with the actual story progression.  What's with the ""peeping Tom"" scene?  Where's the payoff of Henry's cousin, the ""hog lady""?  And the ending, while somewhat of an amusing gag -- where does it fit in?  Many times, director Eli Roth aspires to create scenes that surprise the audience and turn on horror conventions, but I was able to guess about 90 per cent of the gags, from the ""I made it"" scene (a ripoff of Night of the Living Dead) to the ""sexy touch turned ugly"" scene.  And frankly, I don't like it when I'm too far ahead of the film; it beggars the question ""Why am I watching if I know everything?""

The bottom line is, this film aspires to be The Evil Dead and succeeds in the gross-out factor and intensified violence, but fails on the level of humanity.  The Evil Dead was often funny while being horrific, and thanks to Bruce Campbell's great presence and Sam Raimi's sympathetic handling, you cared about the characters in that cabin.  When Ash from The Evil Dead is confronted with his possessed sweetheart, you feel for him.  Cabin Fever's characters just don't inspire much sympathy; it even apes the same aforementioned scene in The Evil Dead, but abbreviates the character's emotional dilemma so that the scene is just grossly interesting rather than affecting.  Which has its merits, of course, but give me the combined blood-and-heart of The Evil Dead any day.  Next time, I hope Roth spends a little more time cooking up a coherent script and working on dialogue that doesn't sound like a collection of Andrew Dice Clay quotations.  When married to the effectiveness of the shock sequences here, it could result in a better horror film.",1098576000,5,2785,4.698969072164949

1949143,3,B0000VCZNE,"""Cabin Fever"" is your prototypical film that puts forth a somewhat coherent plotline for the first 35 minutes or so, only to swerve off-road and nose-dive into a bog bubbling with senseless, barf-inducing filth.

Set up quite similarly to ""Evil Dead,"" ""Cabin Fever"" tracks five college students who pack their belongings for a weekend getaway at a log cabin in strum-the-banjo, USA. As could be expected, something out there is determined to spoil their self-indulgent undertakings. This time around, the assailant is in the form of a flesh-consuming micro-organism.

The composition of the spunky bunch is second-to-none. You have your bead-brained moron, Bert (James DeBello); your copulatory tease-go-round blonde, Karen (Jordan Ladd); your since-eighth-grade pursuer of the aforementioned blonde, Paul (formerly Shawn of ""Boy Meets World,"" Rider Strong); and last, but probably least, your sexually active brunette Barbie and her kinky surfer-esque Ken, Marcy and Jeff (Cerina Vincent and Joey Kern, respectively).

The misery unchains for the five of them beginning with a twilight visitation by a BB-ridden hermit, thanks to Bert mistaking the man-of-the-hills for a woodchuck in his earthly dugout. The hermit's skin is literally peeling off due to his contraction of the deadly virus some days ago.

His approach for help leads to the campers slamming the cabin door in his revolting face, tempting the now-enraged recluse to hop into the driver's seat of Jeff's truck and ram his foot into the gas pedal, spewing blood all the while.

Eventually, Jeff and Bert ignite the sickened hermit into a full blaze, sending the simpleton rushing through the woods begging for sight of a coolant. He, unfortunately for the campers, finds the coolant - becoming defunct in a water reservoir that supplies the cabin's tap water - and, as we all know, water is an essential requirement for human survival.

Writer-director Eli Roth, whoever the hell that is, must have been a booger-exhibiting, paste-ingesting youth. In other words, like Hitchcock's mastery of the suspense genre, Roth has achieved utmost proficiency in the field of the repugnant and plain-out G-R-O-S-S. Your humble critic, who can usually ward off even the most stagnant on-screen yuck, was carefully considering a beeline for the toilet bowl throughout the picture's duration.

On the contrary, if one can withstand the motion picture's Lennox-jab to the gut, then he or she can anticipate a rich helping of what-the-hell pie. Given, this film is a lousy excuse for streaming entertainment, but, if nothing else, it does keep your eyes glued to the screen.

Perhaps it's the perverse mental capacity of Generation Y'ers, myself included, that continuously flock to theaters to crunch popcorn to such cinematic jetsam that are to blame. So be it. As long as executive producers round up enough dough to make goofball attempts at horror, you can count on my posterior being planted front-and-center at the local movie house.",1096243200,2,2990,5.266806722689076

1949145,2,B0000VCZNE,"From my perspective as a long-time, rabid fan of horror, I have to say that Cabin Fever is simply a dreadful horror film.  I'm not talking about a few bad scenes, either; this film starts out bad and goes downhill from there.  Just because you put a bunch of kids in the woods, throw in a few crazy rednecks, dump buckets of blood all over the place, and rip off a number of scenes from old horror classics, it doesn't mean you've made a good horror movie.

I hardly know where to start on this one.  I knew there was going to be a problem from the very start.  You have a bunch of kids celebrating the end of exams by going camping for a week, then you can't help but notice the woods covered with fallen leaves.  What kind of school has final exams in autumn, for Pete's sake?  And these kids - each one is very different from the others, yet they are all equally impossible to like.  ""Frat Guy"" man is one of the most annoying characters I've ever encountered.  Normally, when you watch horror, there's at least one character you fervently hope lives through the ordeal - not so here.  I was ready to see all five of the main characters taken out after spending just a few minutes with them.

I guess I should mention the premise of this thing.  Basically, these five kids have their good time ruined by some strange hermit with a serious skin condition - he can't keep his skin on his body, to be exact.  It's a similar setup to Evil Dead, only the source of the trouble here is a flesh-eating virus.  As you might expect, the kids start getting the same disease one by one, begin to turn on each other, blah blah blah.  Their efforts to get help are thwarted by their own incompetence as well as the attitude of the local rednecks they encounter.  I was desperately pulling for the virus, and it could not do its work quickly enough to satisfy me, as this film felt like it would never end.  There is a lot of blood in Cabin Fever, and that's normally a good thing, but once you've seen some walking rotten corpse projectile-vomiting blood a few times, it loses some of its appeal.  I guess I can say that the special effects weren't too bad overall, though.  The music, though, was awful.  I have to question the whole vision thing of young director Eli Roth; it's as if he periodically inserted a few silly montages and highly discordant music for no reason other than to make his movie look slightly artistic.

Many of the gorier parts of the film come straight from classics such as Evil Dead, Night of the Living Dead, and Dawn of the Dead - as such, they did not impress me at all, especially those that happened during the very late and supposedly climactic moments of the movie.  The so-called comedy that is interspersed throughout Cabin Fever is not even groan-worthy for the most part.  There is one exception to this, though, and this is the closest thing this film has to a saving grace of any kind: the very last scene is absolutely hilarious - and that's all I'm going to say about it.

When it comes to the Special Features, let me just say that I watched them so you won't have to.  There's a half-hour documentary on the making of the film, a really stupid Family Friendly Version of Cabin Fever, really low-quality (and thankfully short) video of a martial artist wannabe, and three short animated films starring The Rotten Fruit - rotten is truly the key word here.  There are five commentaries of the film, but there's no way I could sit through this film a second time, let alone five more times.  There's also a Chick-Vision option for watching the film.

All in all, in almost every way possible, Cabin Fever is just a very unimpressive horror movie.  It's not scary, it's not funny, the gore does nothing to instill squeamishness, the script is weak, and the soundtrack is a constant source of annoyance.  Doggone it, I looked forward to seeing this film, expecting good things from it, and I was just bitterly disappointed.",1094601600,8,3954,4.451388888888889

1949148,1,B0000VCZNE,"The key to making a good horror film is to make the world of the film believable.  Think of the creepy suburban nightmare of ""Poltergeist,"" or the movie-within-a-movie polish of ""Scream,"" or even the malevolent hell of ""Carrie""'s high school.  Likewise, said movie needs to follow some sort of logic... and if the setting is the real world, then the characters should behave like real people, no?

This is where ""Cabin Fever"" totally and utterly fails.  No one in the film behaves with even the tiniest bit of common sense.  It isn't because their characters are stupid or frightened, or because the world of the film allows for people to behave so incredibly idiotically... it's because their lines just written that way.  The filmmaker creates a very ""real"" threat (a skin-eating virus) and then proceeds to have all of his characters react in completely moronic, unreal (and therefore unbelievable) ways.  Examples:

1. Our party-animal frat-boy character (haven't we seen this jackass in at least a million other movies already?) sets everything in motion by choosing to simply kill a transient who makes a failed attempt to steal their vehicle, rather than let the guy just run away.  Committing unjustified murder... always a smart idea.  PS - the aforementioned frat reject is unneccessarily mouthy, rude, drunk and dense.  Big surprise, that.

2.  A cop shows up on-scene.  On a bicycle.  He acts borderline retarded, and uses the word ""party"" every other word (unlike every other character in the film, who drop the F-bomb as if it were ""and"" or ""the."")  This guy is a cop?  I don't care how backwoods this place is... they just don't allow dull-normal teenagers to put on a badge and carry a gun.  Talk about an insult to police departments everywhere.

3.  When we do actually meet up with someone who is a bonafide mental reject, he proceeds to bite one of our infected lead losers, after screaming ""Pancakes! Pancakes!"" and doing ""Matrix""-style kung-fu kicks for no discernible reason.  (Was this supposed to be some avant-garde statement?  If so, it doesn't work.)  Then the mentally-impared kid's caretaker launches into a monologue that really doesn't make any sense at all.  Trust me, I rewound and listened to it three times... it's just mindless blathering.

4.  The one and only inspired scene in the film witnesses the less-virginal of the two women characters, now infected, as she retreats to the cabin's bathroom and shaves her legs.  The razor courses over her nubile, shaving cream-covered shins.  Underneath, the ravages of the virus appear as patches of her mottled skin ooze and bleed.  Gross, yes.  Unsettling?  For sure.  So what ruins this one little gem?  Later, one of the guys surveys the damage at the cabin, including the bathroom... which is now, somehow, DRENCHED in blood.  Blood everywhere.  When did this oozy little scene turn into total carnage?  I don't recall the gal shaving with a chainsaw.

5.  Another of our annoying leads (the non-infected one) is set up as being overly-paranoid and fearful that he's gonna catch the killer bug.  After coming close to setting a record as the most grating character ever written, he manages to flee from the camp before the virus gets him.  And then, without explanation, he GOES BACK the following morning.  Oy.

6.  (SPOILER ALERT) My favorite: our main character finally succumbs to the dreaded virus after his buddies have already been cremated by the ""Deliverance""-like locals at the cabin-from-hell.  In a cruel twist of fate, it's ""party"" cop who is transporting him as he expires... not to a hospital as promised, but to certain doom and the awaiting bonfire we presume.  But no.  For absolutely no reason, the infected moron's carcass ends up DUMPED IN THE LOCAL WATER SUPPLY.  Why?  Oh, because without this inexplicable little plot twist, there's no chance for a sequel.

Stupid, stupid, stupid.

Some people are touting this film are having an edge or style, even saying that the director is the new Peter Jackson.

 A total Raimi rip-off (except that Raimi had cool demons possess the characters and had an amazing visual flair even at the age of 19 when he made the original Evil Dead.)

 I just totally loathed this vomitous crap. Every single character was moronic and unlikable. Were we supposed to hate them all so much that we'd be glad when they started to bleed? The ending was a total lame-ass rip off of ""Night of the Living Dead"".

 I'll never watch one of this guy's movies ever again. I want the 90 mins of my life back!",1091491200,5,851,4.3081761006289305
1949163,4,B0000VCZNE,"First of all, let's get one thing straight.  This is a simple horror movie that's not be taken seriously.  All those horror afficianados out there should just stop getting their knickers in a knot and chill.  It's nerds like you that drive people away from genre work in the first place.  What I loved most about this film is that it reminded me of those drive-in B movies that used to get slapped together all half-a**ed, in a quick attempt to make a buck off the latest 'big thing' that audiences were flocking to see.  I used to sneak downstairs in my pajamas when I was a little kid and watch movies like 'Driller Killer' or 'Count Yorga The Vampire' or 'Frogs' and just revel in them.  Admittedly, these films had no grand themes and were by no means considered masterpieces of the genre, but the basic premise was the same.  Here's a situation...now, get out of it.  I'm sure in real life you wouldn't need a lot of background information, or even an understanding of what's going on, to notice that you're in danger and must escape.  I wouldn't call this movie realistic by any means, but thats not the point.  So, five 'teens' head out to some rickety old cabin in the woods to drink, have sex, party and relax.  All of a sudden, one of their numbers runs into a guy with some skin disease, whom they shoot at and light on fire.  I'll bet a lot of us would react the same way.  Fear does that.  Then, one by one, the rest of the group slowly waste away from the same affliction.  Pretty run-of-the-mill sounding, no?  What sets this film apart is that I truly didn't know what to expect from one moment to the next.  After years and years of paint-by-numbers horror films, I finally got excited by a movie that kept me in suspense just because I couldn't figure out what was going on.  All notions of plot, character development and even logic got thrown by the wayside as I eagerly awaited the next thrill.  The movie left me both laughing and stunned.  The scene where the chick is in the bathtub, trying to ignore the fact that clumps of flesh falling off her legs as she shaved them, evoked a horrified sympathy from me.  I could feel her self-denial until she started to freak out and met her end.  I loved how everything in the movie was pretty much left open-ended and unexplained.  We really never got a grasp on what the disease was and why it did what it did or why certain characters get introduced and then vanish suddenly. I like how our own prejudices and assumptions made certain things, like the redneck townsfolk or the diseased man seeking help, seem more ominous than they should have been. The film seemed to play on paranoid, irrational fears and in turn, was structured irrationally.  OK, maybe thats stretching it a bit, but I still found many of the scenes fascinating to watch.  When our hero character finally gets to crawl into bed with the girl he's been pining for, he gently slides his hand under the covers and we get treated to some embarrassingly graphic sounds, only to find our friend's hand covered in blood and muckus as he pulls it out.  The way the rest of the group  subsequently turn on their infected friend says a lot about human nature, especially when confronted with the unknown.  I won't intellectualize the film too much though.  Eli Roth left so many things unexplained that at times the film is illogical and uncomprehensible.  But in that also lies it charm.  Once you suspend your disbelief (or even your own criteria for that matter), and get swept up in the ride, the film becomes a lot of fun.  There's so many funny scenes that just come out of nowhere.  When the goofy guy heads out into the woods to do a little squirrel hunting, our hero asks 'Why?' and he retorts 'Because they're (insert homosexual slur here)'.  And its delivered so deadpan that I couldn't help cracking up.  The ultimate scene, that, of course, everyone mentions, is the now infamous 'Pancakes!' scene.  No idea where the hell it comes from or what it means, but when little mulleted redneck boy sees the goofy guy pull into town in his pick up, complete with flesh starting to peel from his recent infection, the boy goes ballistic yelling 'Pancakes!' and doing all these slo-mo kung fu kicks, only to BITE the goofy guy.  Its these surprises that make the movie a roller coaster ride.  The characters are great too...James DeBello is the big goof who stirs up trouble for no  rational reason, making the unpedictable film even more so, by providing a loose cannon, Giusseppe Andrews is great as the bike riding cop who just likes to party (he's oddly reminiscent of David Arquette's cop in 'Scream' but sleazier), and there's Joey Kern who plays the jerk boyfriend (by the way, what's with the effette gay-ish guys playing all the womanizing jerks in horror movies lately?  I noticed it in the 'Dawn of the Dead' remake too.) To top it off, the movie got a rave review from Peter 'Lord of the Rings' Jackson, who got his start making incredibly over-the-top B-horror flicks like 'Bad Taste' and 'Dead Alive', and, when you understand Jackson's sensibilities, there's no more ringing endorsement than that.  Just remember: don't go and pick up a comic book expecting Tolstoy.  Ciao.",1091491200,2,5221,4.581896551724138

The trick is create increasingly compex situations that make the viewer progressively more uncomfortable, but, paradoxically, unable to turn away .

1949165,1,B0000VCZNE,"I LOVE Horror Movies! I have to mention that right off the bat because when anyone rips on a film it's usually because they never cared for the Genre to begin with. This movie was so BAD it stays locked in your mind for hours how BAD it was and how you just lost 90 minutes of your life! (anyone who's ever seen ""Jaws-the Revenge"" knows what I'm talking about.. especially if you paid money to see it in the theater) It boggles my mind how many people gave this movie a positive review! Nevermind the Hype or expectation.. ""The Ring"" received a great deal of hype and because of that it became just a decent to Average Film to those expecting more.. This on the otherhand had no redeeming quality whatsoever! There have been other horror movies in recent years that follow similar patterns, and usually ALL of them make you nod or smile when it ends, going ""That was pretty fun"". Such as ""Wrong Turn"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Identity"", ""Frailty"", etc.. I've come to believe that there are no longer REALLY BAD films because lets face it.. someone has to shell out a LOT of money to produce a Movie these days and if the script, actors, director, or any element doesn't look promising, they're not about to risk losing Millions of Dollars! I cannot believe the producer of this saw anything redeaming to take a risk on such a NON-PLOT, Non-Direction ""Horror"" Film.

 Take for instance the ""cause"" of the carnage.. it's some kind of disease that is never explained where it originated from.. and it simply makes people bleed and get sick to the point where they die. (Picture the movie ""Outbreak"" with only 8 possible victims in a wooded-cabin.. what's ""scary"" about people getting sick??? ... ""OOOooooo.. Johnie's got a whooping-caugh!! Friday the 13th eat your heart out!"" Now maybe the movie would've actually crept up to the level of Average had the Diseased-victims actually gone ""MAD"" and attacked the others.. (like one stray dog does that they refuse to shoot through-out the entire movie but will shoot a Human without a second glance.) if they made the deseased-victims attack others like they did in 28 Days, it would be decent.

 Then there's the kid at the Farm Store.. who does a Mean ""Kung-Fu, Matrix"" ruetine for no apparent reason whatsoever.. It would of been understandable and even humorous if the thing simply played a Banjo. (What was up with that??) Another strange thing was the ""Setting"".. they're suppose to be in the middle of nowhere in the backwoods and the closest form of Help is a ""Farm Store"" with rednecks that probably make love to farm animals while in the background, clear as day sitting up on the hill is easilly a $500,000 home and they're looking for help from the Rednecks instead?? Humor wasn't funny and Horror wasn't scary. Why would you fear People that become sick and lifeless?? As if the entire movie wasn't bad all around, they even had to End it by copying a predictable finish that several other films have done to the point where you hope you never see it done again.. (I'm talking about the last-man-standing thinking he's ""Made It"" and is the last one until they step outside and get blown away ""accidentally"" by renecks thinking he's deseased.. Gee, where have we seen this before??? Practically every George Romero Movie ever made, and endless Zombie-Movies that tried to copy that finish. Just Brutal.. But I guess it needed one last rediculous scene to wrap it all up. (Frankly I should've been watching Jaws-the Revenge.. at least then I could laugh at ""Roaring Sharks"") But anyway.. for God's sake, don't spend good money on this movie.. see it with a Friend that rented it and spent HIS money, but don't waste yours!

1949166,5,B0000VCZNE,"Forget that this isn't the movie that everyone hyped it to be. It's just a very solid horror movie. Something that we horror fans don't see much of. Most of the crap that hits theatres or our rental store's shelves aren't half this good. If for nothing else, watch this movie for the nostalgic use of the woods and music to take yourself back to movies like Swamp Thing, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th, and The Evil Dead. The characters are very underrated as well. Joey Kern, from Super Troopers, plays a great typical, stoner boyfriend who surprises us all at the end. Dennis, the blonde mulleted boy outside the convinience store is somewhat of a standout in the film. His 'pancakes' scene is rib crackingly funny. The dialogue is, for the most part, entertaining if not hysterical. And Rider Strong aka(always known as) Sean Hunter made me forget his troubles with Mr. Feeny and focus on his drooling over Jordan Ladd. And how could you not like a movie that features two of the main stars of Detroit Rock City, Guiseppe Andrews and James Debello? Neither dissapoint here either. Some of the best lines come from these two; When asked to give one good reason to steal a Snickers bar, Debello replied ""the nougat?"" and Officer Winston may well be the best County Sherriff ever protrayed on film, ""Everything is ok ma'am, just go inside and have yourself a nice 40oz"". For all the gripers and groaners, give Cabin Fever a break. Eli Roth knows what he's doing and he is taking his time developing into one the best modern horror directors so he can endulge is fun movies like this.

Nothing in this film makes sense, the characters are despisable, everything they say or do is a sign for Roths horrible script. Implausibilties galore and no friggin supense at all.

Eli Roth is a poser and is plugging himself as the future of horror - let's hope his future projects live up to the hype he has created for himself otherwise he's going to look like an idiot. More so than he does now.

1949171,5,B0000VCZNE,"Wow, I was really surprised to see that this movie got bad reviews from some people. In my opinion this film is nothing short of a classic! I absolutely loved it! I had always had an itch to rent this film, since I am a huge horror fan and since it had received such enthusiastic reviews from movie critics (which is rare for horror films), but being the geek that I am, I sometimes do a little background research before renting a movie. This often includes consulting with the Amazon crowd to get a general idea of what the public consensus is before heading to the video store. Consequently, I kept passing up this film due to one too many negative reviews.
Well, I finally decided to give a shot, and I have to say this is by far and away one of the best horror movies I have ever seen! Ok...if you are not a fan of the horror genre, chances are you are not going to appreciate this film. But for genuine horror fans, I think that most will agree that it doesn't get much better than this. Everything about this film works-the cinematography is extraordinary, the special effects are brilliantly gruesome, and the musical score creates a tension that is beyond anything I have ever experienced during a movie (if you watch it a second time pay careful attention to the music and you will understand why this movie causes so much tension). The acting performances are above average for a horror film, and the dialogue is unforced and natural. One of the major flaws in horror movies is that bad acting and unnatural dialogue are distracting and prevent the audience from getting involved with the film. The characters in this film are believable, which is more than you can ask for in this genre.
 I get so bored with some horror movies, and my mind starts to wander away and think about work or making a pastrami sandwich. But Cabin Fever sucked me in...big time. When a movie can draw you in and make you experience what the characters are experiencing--than it is successful. Overall, I would say that this film is a contemporary horror masterpiece.

1949172,1,B0000VCZNE,"Five teenagers, freshly graduated from college, decide to rush off to a cabin in the woods that they rented to party and celebrate their graduation. Ostensibly they rented the cabin from someone, which should mean that there's a line of communication available to them later in the film when they desperately need it, but apparently there isn't.
So it's a horror film, and with these kids in the cabin we should be expecting a clone of Jason Voorhees or some clone to come crash the party and kill them all, right? Wrong. The culprit is a flesh eating virus, and eventually ""culprit"" becomes plural as they turn against themselves and others. The movie gets a small nod for an intriguing approach (flesh eating virus instead of Jason clone), but no marks beyond that.
Saddest to see was that the Director/Writer Eli Roth and the entire cast took this film seriously. The dialogue was unrealistic and laughable at times, and each scene appeared either more improbable or ridiculous than the one before. The surviving characters also gained an interesting quality that most characters shouldn't gain in a film that strives to take itself seriously: stupidity. Yes, they get dumber. Their collective and individual responses to stress and difficult situations actually get worse as the movie progresses. In whatever art form that aims to take itself seriously - be it writing a book or making a film - characters are supposed to grow, to learn. With one exception, these characters start with a brain, and end with a mostly empty cranium. The one exception is a character that begins with an empty cranium. Surprisingly, he alone experiences a small amount of growth. But it doesn't matter, because it's too small and irrelevant.
There's a frustrating dearth of good horror films. There's no shortage of horror movies that began with an imbecilic notion and carry it through to an imbecilic end. To me there is little more frustrating than a well intentioned horror film with a unique and fresh approach that gets it all wrong.
This could have been one of the few good ones. Instead it turned out to be a parody of itself. As the movie came to conclusion, I really wasn't sure whether or not I was supposed to be laughing along with the film or at it - but one thing I was sure of is that I was laughing. Being unsure of how I was supposed to respond to the movie was the only reason I watched the special features on the DVD, and I learned, sadly, that I was not supposed to be laughing along with the film.
Too bad. It is Eli Roth's debut as a writer/director. If you're true and honest to your craft you grow as you practice it. Perhaps future endeavors will be better.

Now, I don't presume to be a movie critic by any measure of the term, but I think that there is a good reason that Peter Jackson and countless other movie critics have endorsed this movie--it is fun and absolutely riveting in the way only a well made horror flick can be. Sure it's gory, but in a much more creative and stylish manner than your typical teenage slasher. Having watched many a horror film, my response tends to be relatively impassive when a masked villain stabs some hapless teenage victim; but seeing that infected woman in the bathtub shaving her legs and crying as she took off layers of decaying flesh had me clenching my teeth, tightening the muscles in my neck, and curling my toes. I agree with the critic who asserted that ""The Ring"", ""Wrong Turn"", and ""28 Days Later"" are some of the better horror movies to have come out of Hollywood in a while, but I would add this one, along with ""Dawn of the Dead"", to the list as well.

The locals aren't nearly grimy and greasy-headed looking enough and the chicks in the film always seem to keep that makeup and clean hair look even after days of torment. This film could have been great if it had had a nastier ,dirtier ,grimier look about it.

Those movies just seemed like they put forth more effort in trying to scare or gross out the audience. I recently read one review that says this movie takes us back to the days of the horror movies from the late 70's and early 80's. I guess the setting being a cabin in the woods, a la ""Evil Dead"" or 5 teenagers a la every horror movie during that time could be considered the same but the movie iself isn't even close!!

1949199,2,B0000VCZNE,"WARNING :  This review is for the theatrical film not the DVD.

You know a movie is in trouble when a major character is so unsympathetic you wish he'd be the first one to go.  That's exactly the case with the flesh-eating-virus blood-fest CABIN FEVER. Braindead-but-gun-happy Bert (James DeBello) is so aggravating, relief is felt when his life finally ends (where, ironically, the hunter looking to shoots ""gay (!) squirrels"" becomes the hunted himself).  If only his presence is the only thing that makes the audience cringe, but alas, most of the production does as well.  What could have been a fun B-movie extravaganza a la Texas Chainsaw Massacre or a la Evil Dead only turns out to be a less than impressive copy-cat film of all these classics.  Everything you watch feels taken badly from one horror movie after another.  The Sam Raimi woods-speed shots, the Tobe Hooper panorama-filmed atmosphere, the Peter Jackson below shots...  As for his cast, the only one who brings some depth to his otherwise thinly created character is TV Boy Meets World star Rider Strong.  His performance as the doomed hero is both sharp and fresh, and so worthy of better projects.  The rest of the cast (including the uncredited acting part of director Roth himself as the pot-smoking freak) goes from decent (first girl-victim Ladd) to awful (Debello).

The second half of the film is where the ""fun"" really begins and it is also where the plot really thickens, as we are treated to a no holds barred action/horror flick with surprising twists and turns.  The only downside is its last shot, which would have worked better on the cutting room floor ; did we really need to see the town folks drinking that infested lemonade to understand that all are doomed ?  Speaking of less is more, the overlong relieved-reaction shot of the hiding-in-the-woods ""survivor"" Jeff (Joey Kern) was desperately in need of some cutting as well.  Anyone could have guessed his outcome.  But despite its many flaws, the film stays with you.  Just like the so-much-better 28 DAYS LATER, the subject is so contemporary, one can't help but wonder if-or when-reality will take over. 2  stars.-----Martin Boucher",1089590400,3,2179,4.909836065573771

 this movie pays homage to many of the 70s and 80s horror movies such as:last house on the left,cujo,the texas chainsaw massacre,night of the living dead,dawn of the dead,the thing,and the evil dead.another thing it brings back from the 70s and 80s is the blood and gore.wow!!!havent seen gore like this for a long time.
 contains spoilers for people who haven't seen it yet.we see a dog who has been spit down its stomach and we can see inside its bloody body and blood squirts on a mans face.the hermit is bloody in one scene.we see a reinactment of a story being told of people getting killed in a bowling alley.this shows people being hit in the head with a hammer and having thier body parts chopped off with an ax,and the killer bowling with the parts...this scence is kind of disturbing,but also kind of funny,and also has a nice deal of blood in it.the hermit returns and he pukes a load of blood all over the kids trucks,and is still bloody from having the virus.we see a pig that has just been gutted and we see its intestins haging out of the body.
 when paul is fooling around with karen..he thinks he is finging her,but he is actully fingering the bloody hole in her thigh caused by the virus which causes blood on pauls fingers.when ready to leave,they go to get karen and they see her legs with many holes in them and covered in blood,as is her blanket and mattras she was sleeping on,and she then vomits up blood on the truck and ground.bert has blood coming from his neck when he has the virus.bert lader has blood all over his arms and rubs the blood a tree as a distraction.a woman shaving her legs shaves off her skin since she has the virus which causes lots of blood to run from her legs and holes in her back.
 a woman gets completly eaten by a dog and we see many bloody pieces of her scattered around.a man turns over a woman to see her body very bloody and has lost her lips on a count of the virus,the man then beats her to death with a shovel which causes blood to spray on his face.a man gets shot in the head which causes his head to expload which causes lots of blood,brain,and skull to splatter on the wall.a man is hit in the face with a canteen which causes blood to start spewing from his mouth and he is killed.a man is stabbed in the ear with a screwdriver which as blood running from his ear.a man is shot in the side with blood splattering everywhere,and is then speared in the back while trying to craw away..the impact of the spear causes blood to splatter on the killers shirt.we see a man that was either cut or torn in half and we see the blood and some intestins there.a man hits a deer which is a little bloody,but then the man shoots the deer which causes lots of blood to splatter on his face.a man starts puking up blood on people at a party and a man that had a harmonica stuck in his neck pukes up some blood.we see a very bloody man lying in a river.
 sorry if i gave away too much information...i was just trying to warn people that this is a very sick movie with lots of gore,but that doesnt mean u shouldnt see it.its very good and brings something new and cool to the horror gerne.",1089158400,3,4489,4.3179122182680905

This movie starts funny and aloof, then it starts down a surprising chain of events that only a true fan of the genre could diabolically invent.  Eli Roth creates a world that harkens back to the late 70's and early 80's horror movies, without ever feeling like he is ripping them off.  The end of the movie had me laughing out loud and jumping out of my chair with excitement.
  The DVD is packed full of great extras including a documentary, the Rotten Fruit shorts, some funny ""cuts"" of the movie, and my personal favorite, Pancakes, the best ""music video"" I have ever seen.
  All in all this one hell of a package.  A great story with many twists and turns,  a lot of gore, laughs, and most of all, a little nudity.  Add that to great extras and you have a must own.

Some examples the guy's F U hat, the biting child Dennis, the bet the two make, the guy stumbling out of the woods with a bag of weed whom the others tell to go ahead and join them. This is funny stuff. But then as you think this movie is just full of laughs that's when the terror begins. Right, terror. Some ugly infected man goes to the cabin and ends up getting shot again after the drunk hunter in the F U hat already had, and stumbles into a reservoir. Goodness me, I hope no one gets infected. When the first one of the group becomes infected, they try to leave in the car but can't because she pukes all other the interior, so they lock her in a shed.
Well there are a couple of good parts, I can't think of them off hand but there was. Well the hot man of the couple that have (...), goes off into the woods armed only with two six packs of beer, this is good stuff. Well, **SPOILER** all in all he is the last one alive but is shot during his celebration of being the last one. But how was the virus contained you ask?

1949215,3,B0000VCZNE,"An entertaining and surprising effort, ""Cabin Fever"" is one of the most refreshing horror movies of the last years, adding some new blood to a somewhat tired genre. The plot offers nothing new, focusing the adventures of five teenagers in the woods while they make a vacation before going to college. Still, director Eli Roth presents an intriguing and scary enough flick, providing a couple of suspenseful moments with many darkly comic situations. The cast is alright but far from stellar, the soundrack is creepy as it should, the photography is grim and well-crafted and the overall mood and atmosphere are very convincing as well. ""Cabin Fever"" isn`t as good as Danny Boyle`s ""28 Days Later"", still it offers a lot of good scenes with some memorable and sinister details. Not bad for a directorial debut.

1949218,4,B0000VCZNE,"While there was a surplus of profanity coming from this band of post-high school kids, the acting was superb and the story was excellent. Even though it had a very unsatisfying ending (all of the kids contracting the plague and dissolving in red puddles of protoplams), the film was quirky, riveting and hugely entertaining. If you are looking for off-beat chills set in an authentic outback of Illinois populated by primitive Ozark-types, then this is the movie for you.",1087603200,,471,4.974683544303797
1949219,3,B0000VCZNE,"What can you expect from Cabin Fever? Well let me just remind you that this is about a bunch of teenagers going to a cabin in an isolated area and being struck by a flesh eating virus. Of course the teens drink, have sex and then start to die. What makes Cabin Fever stand out is of course the virus aspect; rather than a lone nut with a chainsaw or hunting knife killing off the teens. It borrows heavily from horror films of the 70's (which seem to be making a come back with TCM 2003 and Wrong Turn). The performances are satisfactory and the humour is piled on heavily which works well as a contrast to all the gore. Don't be expecting too many frights though as it is fairly predictable stuff, especially if you have seen all the classic horror films as this pays homage to them all. The film encounters problems when it adds in surreal (but very funny) moments such as a boy with a mullet suddenly doing some kung-fu for no apparent reason, and a harmonica being swallowed whole. These moments just don't gel with the rest of the film but they do add something original to an otherwise run of the mill enjoyable horror.",1087516800,3,1125,4.3619047619047615
1949230,5,B0000VCZNE,"While some may view Eli Roth's Cabin Fever as ""just another teen horror flick"", the film is actually quite refreshing. Never since the 1995 satyrical horror movie ""Scream"" have I been so impressed by a movie of this kind. The plot entails a group of college students who rent a cain in the woods. The vacation seems to be going accordingly until Burt, played by James DeBello comes across a man with a horrid skin infection, and subsequently shoots him with a B.B. gun. Instead of trying to help the man, the main characters panic and end up killing him. The movie then becomes a question of who is infected, how the infection travels, and what to do with those who becoming infected (i.e. inhumanely locking them in the shed). Cabin Fever's plot succeeds, with the perfect combination of horror, gore, and outrageous humor.
  More importantly, the film succeeds where most of its kind fails. Whereas most horror movies of this generation display characters that quickly die off, without the viewer ever developing a notion of their true colors, Cabin Fever successfully develops its characters. For example, Jeff, played by Joey Kern comes off as arrogant and selfish; (not to spoil the ending for those who haven't seen it). Therefore when he meets his unfortunate fate, it's almost a celebrated occasion by the viewer. Not to mention Rider Strong's role, (previously of the hit show ""Boy Meets World""), which I found rather refreshing, as he embarks on a brief but gory killing spree. Perhaps my favorite character in the film is Burt, played by James DeBello, from ""Detroit Rock City"". DeBello brings the majority of the humor in ""Cabin Fever"" with his goofy antics and rediculous stories about masterbation. In addition, the two leading female roles played by Jordan Ladd and Cerina Vincent, although they do not bring much substance to the movie, contribute to the film simply by being stunningly attractive. On a side note, for those who are not aware, the film's director Eli Roth has a small cameo as ""Grim"", the pot smoking skater, with a vicious dog named Dr. Mambo.
  To sum it all up: an original story plot, well developed characters, humor in all the right places (while at times extremely bizarre; i.e. Dennis, the biting Pancake boy), and non-stop action, taking gore to new heights. And not to get analytical about a movie that clearly has little to be analyzed on the surface, but take note at the director's message about human nature that is made obvious by the end of the film. The main characters are viewed similarly to the way they viewed the infected man in the woods at the beginning of the film. In a sense, the movie depicts the ignorance of humans, and how their innappropriate behavior may result in drastic occurences (the whole town perceivedly becoming infected and probably others, as the trucks leave the town carrying infected water). Cabin Fever is fun and entertaining, with all of the necessary components to create such a film.",1086825600,2,2968,4.848126232741618

1949233,3,B0000VCZNE,"I'm surprised to see so many reviews that hated this movie considering the fact that over here in the UK, Cabin Fever was pretty well received.  Okay, so the story's an old staple - a group of kids rent out a cabin in the woods only to find a zombie-like infection as scary as the locals is waiting to ensnare them.
Director Eli Roth clearly knows his horror movies, because this movie plunders a lot of them.  The only real problem is that he doesn't really know what direction he wants to take with it - campy fun, retro Evil Dead pastiche or straight horror.  There are elements of all three, used to varying degrees of success.  I was recommended the movie by quite a few Evil Dead enthusiasts, so it would appear to work on that level.  As straight horror there are some genuinely horrible moments, notably a character shaving her legs in the bath deserves to be an instant gore classic.  However, a lot of this seems to be undermined by the black humour of it all, mingling to produce a film nearly as nasty as reality-TV horror My Little Eye, though not as good and certainly not as consistent.  For instance, characters such as the stoner at the beginning disappear early on and a walk-on from a hilarious cop on a push bike who like to 'party' is cheapened by a second appearance.  Saying that, some of the gags definitely work, especially the anti-racist joke at the end, which had me in stitches.  Yet before you've even finished laughing there's a shot of a dead body, making you feel more than a little uncomfortable.  Whilst it could be argued that the mixing of modes is daring and interesting (and this IS better than Wrong Turn, which played it entirely straight), it comes across as uncertainty on the part of a director who didn't know what they wanted.
Still, that doesn't mean it doesn't have its moments.  It does.  The unknown cast are all great value for money, though you suspect that we'll probably never see them again.  In particular, the guy at first coded as the jock turning into a fey scaredy-cat is great stuff.  There are also enough good moments to suggest that Roth could make a much more consistently good movie in future.  Saying that, as zombie movies go, Night Of The Living Dead, Evil Dead and even the recent 28 Days Later, still reign supreme.",1084924800,5,2286,4.527980535279806

The first 3/4 of the feature takes itself overwhelmingly seriously.  Then, in the last quarter, Mr. Roth and Friends insist that it was supposed to be funny and campy.  Like the film, the last portion of the documentary is the most enjoyable, as it actually does seem to represent all that they claim this film is supposed to be.  That's not enough.  If the first portion of the film would have followed the 'homage' pattern as closely and lovingly as the second portion, I would have absolutely loved it!

1949236,3,B0000VCZNE,"I had mixed feelings about this movie, but I found that I had more positive feelings and felt it was an eerie, funny little film. It displays a familiar little story about a group of friends who embark on a vacation to a cabin (sound familiar yet?). But then, director Eli Roth who also writes, comes up with a freakishly original idea of making the teens not be killed by a masked monster or eaten by a family of cannibals... No, Roth instead scripts the teens to be infected by a vicious skin infection which eats away until it's nothing but blood and guts. One by one, they try to avoid catching the disease. It's a highly original plot with a sort-of familiar setting, and it shows that Eli Roth has talent. The music is absolutely scary, with some offbeat scoring that has great effect on the film. The acting is fair, often sappy, but usually pretty good and Bert is one great character. Some of the shots are truly unique and give a great atmosphere to the movie. This movie however, didn't have much in the way of an explanation of what the disease was, where it came from and what was wrong with the biting kid? The ending was funny, but it was a horror movie, not a comedy. CABIN FEVER was a cool little film and wasn't a waste of time, yet I think Eli Roth may have had tee many martoonis while making this (if you catch my drift).",1083888000,3,1342,4.308300395256917

The characters are so dull that you don't even care when they start dying.

You are forced to follow 5 college students, self absorbed, moronic characters who think of only sex and pot, which seems to be the general trend in these low budget horror flicks.
There isn't much of a story here. Throw in some blood here and there and you call it horror. And whats up with the biting kid who does this crazy kungfu thing. It was the most ridiculous scene I have ever seen.

Some of the acting isn't so great- but overall the scenes are well shot with good suspense.  A creative look at horror where the bad guy isn't a killer but a disease, that starts to make the infected look like the bad guy.  Not like Resident Evil or Dawn of the Dead (2004) where people become violent ""zombies.""  But a demonstration of how tradegy can either unite or tear a group of people apart.  If you liked Jeepers Creepers 2, Resident Evil, or Dawn of the Dead (as I did), then I would expect you'd like this one too.  I'm waiting for Eli Roth's next film.  Www.rottentomatoes.com has clips from this film that show some of the more exciting/neat scenes, as well as interviews with the director and actors.  I'm glad I didn't listen to the negative reviews and watched this film.  One of the criticisms is that nothing happens until the last half hour of the film.  Oh so not true!  Another criticism: ""weak plot""... Well so what?  It was fun, all the plot you need is beware of the sickness, each other, and run/fight/survive/argue!",1082592000,5,1428,4.705645161290323
1949256,1,B0000VCZNE,"This movie was so incredibly awful, that I must ask ""How in God's name did this film make it to the big screen"". I've heard the constant roar from horror film buffs that this movie was great, but come on. Any rational being with the slightest bit of competent criticism would agree that every aspect of Cabin Fever was predictable and unstructured. I mean, they had the stoner from Detroit Rock City playing the f'in sheriff. Rider Strong from Boy in the World graced us with his first appearance since like 1994. Even for a movie as ridiculously mindless as Cabin Fever, it is hard to grasp how someone could possible cast him the lead role. This movie got by with Peter Jackson's inconceivable support and a bunch of bs hype. By the way, I remember seeing a womans name (Anna Jackson?) on the opening credits, who could only be Peter Jackson's wife or family member. That would explain the obligation he hopefully felt to help get her movie off the ground. Anyone who could possibly defend this movie has no taste whatsoever when it comes to true film criticism. The budget that they had to work with is overwhelmingly obvious from the revolting cast to the unexcusably unrealistic effects. I can say with the utmost confidence that this is the worst movie I have seen to date.",1082246400,4,1279,4.614035087719298

Better than most of the crap out there, like Freddy versus Jason or Halloween 50, or I Still Know that You Still Know that I Still Know that This Movie Sucks and the like.
This movie is absurd.  The characters are all unsympathetic, but it works.  I don't care if it seems insincere - it is, and it's funny.  I loved watching these people self-destruct, turning against each other at the first sign of infection.  I also loved the complete nonsequiturs like the partying cop and the kid that bites people and suddenly does some Kung Fu in slow motion.

1949269,2,B0000VCZNE,"I initially expressed some measure of excitement when I learned about Eli Roth's ""Cabin Fever."" After reading a description of the film before its release date, the idea of a flesh-eating virus ravaging the tender bodies and souls of a crop of youthful vacationers in the woods immediately sent me into paroxysms of delight. A ton of horror movies have set their nightmares in the deep forests (think ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" ""Evil Dead,"" Friday the 13th,"" and about a billion others), but none dared employ a nasty little bug with the ability to melt flesh off of bone. The potential for a high grue count virtually assured that ""Cabin Fever"" would find its way onto my DVD rental list. Sadly, watching Roth's film considerably dampened my enthusiasm for viral mayhem. Why? A whole host of reasons contributed to my dismay. ""Cabin Fever"" could have been a highly original romp into an entirely new field of horror; instead, director and creator Roth gives his audience a film with ideas hashed together from a half dozen other films. One can only pray plans for a sequel have been quietly shelved away in the filing cabinet marked ""Been there, done that.""
A gang of raucous young kids heads out into the woods for a few days of drinking and general mischief. The group, consisting of Paul (Ryder Strong), Karen (Jordan Ladd), Bert (James DeBello), Jeff (Joey Kern), and Marcy (Cerina Vincent), are an unlikable lot of arrogant jerks. Bert, for example, likes the idea of subsisting solely on beer for the entire trip when he isn't toting a gun out in the woods blasting away at anything that moves. Paul spends all of his time desperately trying to get Karen to notice him in ""that"" way, a behavior that is sort of admirable from a third grader but pathetic from a grown man. Marcy and Jeff are cloying as an inseparable couple that likes to argue when they aren't spending quality time alone in the cabin. The gang roars into ""town"" and quickly encounters trouble with a shopkeeper, his toothy kid, and a cashier who looks like Santa Claus but spouts racial slurs. What a wonderful way to spend a weekend! I think I would have expressed grave doubts about heading further into the woods at this point. But when a script calls for mayhem no matter what the cost, reality takes a flying leap out the window.
Unfazed by this bizarre encounter with the townies, the kiddies push on to the cabin where more weirdness promptly ensues. A stoner (a shameless cameo by Roth himself) rambles out of the woods, stops by the fire, and proceeds to freak our heroes out before disappearing again for most of the film. Then there is Bert's incident with an obviously ill local in the woods. After almost shooting the guy, Bert realizes the bloke is sick and runs away from him. Later, this guy shows up at the cabin in terrible shape, spouting blood and threatening to break the door in. The guys go outside with weapons in an effort to scare the local off, but only succeed in trashing their own vehicle after a vicious fight breaks out. Eventually, sick guy ends up face down in the cabin's water supply. You can almost guess what happens next: the kids start to get sick. Karen falls victim first to the gluey effects of the virus. As the rest of the group learns what is happening, tensions start to emerge. No one wants this nasty bug, so the first item on the agenda involves locking Karen up in a shack outside the cabin. Unfortunately, this remedy doesn't work. Everyone soon gets the virus and passes on in horrible ways. The locals, xenophobic hicks the lot of them, come after the kids in order to stop the virus from spreading. Buckets of blood, exploding heads and rotting bodies, and a tough decision for Paul sums up ""Cabin Fever.""
Roth's film, aside from a not so covert racism directed against white rural folks, is actually quite boring and derivative. You'll see shades of everything from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" to ""Night of the Living Dead"" in this movie, except those films did what they did better than Roth does it here. Moreover, the movie makes the mistake of not being as gory as it could have been. If Roth wanted to rip off other films, he should have just held his nose and made a Peter Jackson gorefest. Instead, the camera often cuts away from particularly ghastly incidents. Even worse, and unforgivable, is the generally unfocused feel of the film. After the picture reaches its mid-point, it seems to lose any sense of direction by introducing brand new ideas. What's up with the scene where a local lady slaughters a pig? How does that fit into the larger scope of the film in any way? And what's with the sudden hostility of the local populace? The only redeeming feature of ""Cabin Fever"" is James DeBello doing his ""dumb guy with bipolar mood swings"" shtick to good effect as the over the top Bert.
The ""Special Edition"" DVD has a load of boring extras. Aside from a few trailers for films like ""The Job,"" ""Serial Killing 101,"" and ""Cabin Fever,"" there's a behind the scenes featurette, a mess of commentaries, a really lame collection of short films made by auteur Roth, and a ""family"" version of the film that runs for approximately thirty seconds. Ha ha. I recommend ""Cabin Fever"" only to those hardcore horror fans that simply must see as many genre pictures as possible. All others would do well to stay away. If you want to see better horror films, check out the movies this one rips off, for example ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" ""Evil Dead,"" and ""Night of the Living Dead.""",1081987200,3,5511,4.6591375770020536

1949271,5,B0000VCZNE,"I like horror movies.  Ordinarily, I like them because they are so awful; horror as a genre lends itself to the making of cheapjack, backyard pictures with amateur actors and horrible scripts, providing ample opportunities to become full-on psychotronic Golden Turkeys.  Rarely are horror movies scary or interesting in their own right.
Cabin Fever is not particularly scary, but it is definitely interesting.  The director and writer know their horror inside and out, and avoid many of the cliches of the genre.  Further, they play with your perceptions, particularly if you've watched a lot of these things.  For example, Cabin Fever completely ignores the standard rules of victim selection.  Further, it doesn't pigeonhole the characters into narrow stereotypes in the first few minutes of the film (the ""Meet the Meat"" part, with acknowledgement to Liz Kingsley); rather, a couple of them are more complex than you might initially think.
The acting is above par for a horror movie, particularly given that I've never seen these actors in anything else.
There is also some funny, funny stuff in this movie that is legitimately comedic--in stark contrast to the faux, unfunny ""comedy"" that often infests films of this genre.

It was let down further though by the appalling acting, and the fact that we could care less about any of the dumbwits who got the flesh eating virus.

1949275,3,B0000VCZNE,"The reviewer who described this film as a 'Karaoke performance' was right on the mark. Roth - the director - is merely an imitator, an homage-merchant, and this film's skeletal structure is unashamedly taken directly from films like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Evil Dead"", ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and, to a lesser extent, ""Night Of The Living Dead"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"". And the substance (the meat) of this film is precisely along the surrealistic lines of David Lynch's style of direction - which would explain why also some reviewers may see similarities to the original surrealist film makers, the Italians -- i.e., Bava, Leone, Antonioni, Argento, etc.

However - like Karaoke - this comparison does not make the film fully unentertaining or without its own original qualities and merits. The film is very well done, very well scored, very well choreographed and shot; convincingly gruesome and despairing; and the acting is precisely as it should be - downplayed and reflective of these types of characters, even though NOT ONE is likeable in the least way, and will be the dominant reason you'll wish to stop watching the film. 'Course, concerning the latter, most (not all) horror films produced after the 1960s had leading characters that the audience were not sympathetic to, which makes me think that this aspect of 'Cabin Fever' was also intended by its director.

The only thing that separates this film from the other films it imitates is its antogonist: a flesh-eating disease. However, despite this difference, 'Cabin Fever' is no different than the other films that are seen through the 'killer's' eyes; and the viewer will be along every step of the way, knowing precisely what will be coming next, and giving the few suprises the film holds in store all that much more impact by comparison.

I don't think this film is deserved of anymore than 3 stars, but I also don't think this film is deserved of any less than 3.

'Cabin Fever' is the best film of its kind: a reflective homage to a few inspirational and highly popular 70s/early 80s independent horror films. It's simple, darkly humourous, grotesque, disturbing, horrifying (to those who still know how to be horrified), and lots of fun. 'Cabin Fever' doesn't pretend to be anything else, so don't expect anything else.

Recommended for fans of 'Evil Dead', 'Return Of The Living Dead', and 'Dead End', as well as horror/comedies in general.",1081382400,6,2427,4.967980295566503

1949301,3,B0000VCZNE,"Probably the most hyped backwoods horror flick of 2003, Cabin Fever received early marks from many critics as a great return to 80's style horror. Lion's Gate Films was the lucky studio that got its hands on the picture for distribution, but upon wide release, seemingly most horror fans who saw it proclaimed it one of the worst films of the year. Kinda makes you question if pre-release hype is the slightest bit reliable (I remember people talking about how terrible the script for the Dawn of the Dead remake was, but it turned out to be the best horror film since The Ring).
Sporting an opening not too dissimilar from The Evil Dead, Cabin Fever begins with five teens going on a trip to the woods for a weekend of fun and relaxation. Among the teens are nice guy Paul (Rider Strong), who's desperate to sleep with his best friend Karen (Jordan Ladd), horny couple Jeff and Marcy (Joey Kern and Cerina Vincent), and goofball Bert (James DeBello), who gets on everyone else's nerves on so many occasions, I wondered why the others bothered to bring him along.
They reach their cabin with little problem and everything goes well at first; Jeff and Marcy fornicate without abandon, Karen kisses Paul for the first time, and Bert is having fun shooting at the small local wildlife. But the arrival of a sick man infected with a skin-eating disease at their door one night leads to total disaster, he vomits blood all over their car, which gets trashed, and runs off burning when Paul jabs him with a ""torch."" Thinking their immediate problems are over, the teens just want to get a mechanic to fix their car, but an even worse problem arises, the flesh-eating bacteria has somehow passed on to one of them, resulting in paranoia and disease that will lead to a literal bloodbath.
Cabin Fever is a film where one gets the distinct impression that the writer/director is truly an enthusiastic horror fan that wants to pay homage to as many genre classics as possible, while also carving this film its own niche as a scary, funny gorefest. And certainly, director Eli Roth gets much of the film right and has a strong handle when it comes to pacing and dreadful anticipation.
CF is already effective merely because of its premise; the fear of hideous bodily horror is something that probably spooks most of us, I know it has that effect on me. For the most part, Roth plays this for all its worth, we get numerous scenes of the teens trying to avoid touching others who are infected, and lots of scenes of victims vomiting blood and peeling flesh. Disgusting, but undeniably eye-catching and hard to turn away from.
Roth also smartly develops the characters first, which has been a surprisingly growing trend recently (Wrong Turn and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake also attempted to flesh out their characters first). This is not to say we've got full-on, three-dimensional characterizations at work here, but the protagonists are generally likeable, particularly Rider Strong and Jordan Ladd. Hottie Cerina Vincent has the unenviable task of playing the [promiscuous woman], but the role is played with more intelligece than usual, and it's great to see nudity in a time when most slashers shy away from bare flesh (it's too bad one of Cerina's nude scenes is during a particularly uncomfortable moment).
But Cabin Fever is marred with astoundingly idiotic scenes and plot twists and turns. The initial set-up, that of the teens having to deal with the disease, is a great one. But throwing in gun-toting rednecks and a weird kid obsessed with biting people was a bad move. The only logical reason I figure Roth included the backwoods folks was to give the movie a higher bodycount and throw in more opportunities for gruesome mayhem. Sure, the violence is pretty hypnotic in a ""wow, I can't believe I just saw that"" way that most mainstream big-studio films try to stray away from, but it comes at too much of a cost to the film's initially solid premise.
The whole mess in the film occurs because the sick hermit went to the teens for help. Then we later find out he's actually the cousin of a nearby meat factory worker. Why didn't he just go to her for help instead, especially considering she's already aware of a disease being passed around to the wildlife and is likely familiar with the whereabouts of the local hospital. There are also questions involving who got infected when, but there's enough context clues that it's not particularly bothersome that we don't see the exact moment of infection. We just never find out where the disease originated from, not that it really matters.
Roth's attempts at morbid laughs range from rock solid (the bowling story) to just eye-rollingly ridiculous (Paul's constant mishaps, whether it's a ladder that breaks, murderous rednecks, a dangerous dog, a deer conveniently in the middle of the road, and the local police force). In fact, I'm not even sure if Roth meant for the latter half of the film to even be taken seriously. When you've got a kid with a mullet yelling ""pancakes!"" and performing half-assed martial arts moves in slow motion, you know something has seriously gone wrong.
Even that doesn't compare to the terrible final scenes, which actually features creepy music accompanying a scene that I think Roth wanted for us to expect another bloody surprise, then suddenly segues into rap music that then abruptly switches to banjo music. I can only say, what the hell? The constant switch of music is bad enough, the scene it goes with is actually even worse.
But for all the mistakes the second half makes, I still had a pretty good time. Cabin Fever is never boring, a rarity in horror these days, and it avoids some cliches that I would have expected in a bigger budget slasher (though given the direction this film takes, I might actually have preferred some of those cliches). Great score by Angelo Badalamenti, too, no surprise there.",1080950400,,5905,4.778864970645793
1949302,3,B0000VCZNE,"This movie was ok.  I wouldn't call it a classic, I wouldn't actively watch it a second time.  But it is decent as an ookie gorefest and alternative to a teen slasher movie.
There are some scenes that are pretty gory, the disease is pretty disgusting.  It plays into modern fears of disease, with something that is a mix of ebola and leprosy.
The inbreds that surround the main characters are amusing for their faults and quirkiness, especially their reaction when they find out these strange kids are sick with some sort of disease.
But the movie turned into a david lynch movie by the end.  Too many pointless scenes, characters, and scenarios that were purposely bizarre.

The only reason the film gets two stars, is because the production values are slightly above average, the opening 20 minutes are so shows promise and because 1 star should be saved for totally irredeemable garbage like FEAR.COM or THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES.  Those films actually destroy your brain.  CABIN FEVER mostly frustrates it, or puts it to sleep.
Also, the DVD is packed with some unique extras...extras that aren't for kids!!!",1080172800,,1193,5.035532994923858
1949305,4,B0000VCZNE,"*CABIN FEVER* I remember seeing the commercials and thinking, ""this is going to be a great scary movie"" and it's that reason alone that I think many hated this movie after seeing it. It's not scary. It has a couple of weird/creepy moments, but it's not at all scary. I CAN'T prove it but it seemed to be more of a ""HORROR-SPOOF"". It's funny and for all the right reasons and at all the right times. It had all the things in it that other horror flicks do, but it twists it just alittle to make you laugh. Oh and it will make you laugh. If I'd had seen this before reading some of the reviews, here on Amazon, I don't think I would have liked it as well. It prepared me to view it with a different frame of mind. I believe the marketing is where they went wrong. If they'd have marketed this as a spoof, it would have been a huge success. Seriously, it's one step away from being the ""Naked Gun"" of the horror genre. But that's what the movie ""Scary Movie"" is for. ""Cabin Fever"" isn't that much of a spoof.
I must say, it's really a good horror-spoof if you go into it thinking it's spoofy. The acting is very good, the gore is there and it has some great funny moments. I could have done without all the ""F"" this and ""F"" that and all the other curse words. But I suppose that's an attempt to keep a completely unrealistic movie, ""realistic"". In my opinion, it would have been even funnier without any curse words at all.
On the other hand, if this is suppose to be a serious horror flick(which I seriously doubt), then it is a miserable failure. I'd like to believe it is intensionally meant to be funny and I'll leave it at that.",1080172800,2,1630,4.194267515923567

The movie isn't scary and it's not supposed to be. It's supposed to be an artsy parody. The movie starts out with a homely looking guy getting a disease from a wolf - after the credits end we meet our unsuspecting victims, college kids that just finished for the year. These kids will take a journey to the woods, the cabin they go to doesn't even have a road to it!... and immediatly after seeing this you know what's going to happen: You're gonna see breasts, infatuation, drinking and lots of deaths set up in 70's old school horror format. It essentially pays homage too as well as parodies older horror flicks such as House of the Living dead, and the Living Dead. The acting was actually quite good if you bear in mind when watching this movie that the actors are supposed to act cheesily because they are paying homage to horror flicks of the past. My advice to you the viewer is go out and buy this flick, it's so much better than all the other terrible horror movies out right now. Cabin Fever is not scary, but when was the last time you saw a horror movie that was!

This is a badly cast movie about your typical horney teenagers who go up to a cabin in the woods to party, but instead of a guy in a hockey mask slashing them to peicaes, they find themselves infected with a virus and no one around to help!
The plots cheesy, and it almost seems like it was a movie that they figured was too short, so they just added some absolutly useless bits and peaces in between to make it run a bit longer! I mean whats with the pancakes kid and the kung fu moves? There is no point at all as to why some things are in this movie at all?

1949320,2,B0000VCZNE,"First off, let me make clear that I GET this movie. I picked up the classic horror references; I dug the cover of the song from ""Last House on the Left,"" appreciated the references to ""Evil Dead,"" ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" and ""Night of the Living Dead."" I also readily forgave the mediocre acting (who watches horror films for great acting?) and appreciated the cinematography, occasionally on-target humor, and well-rendered gore. Through most of the film, I was having a pretty good time.
The problem here is that the filmmakers essentially crapped out and settled for in-jokes rather than an ending. Yes, many of the loose ends were clearly tips of the hat to other films -- like the mysterious ""kit"" that the local guys take with them to investigate what's happening at the cabin -- but the real challenge when you're doing a Tarantino-esque, postmodern pastiche is to weave the allusions into a clever and coherent narrative. That doesn't happen here: we have film ""quotes"" for their own sake, and a story that devolves into a twist-free gore-fest that's predictable in all the wrong ways.
The director manipulates the cultish characteristics of horror fans to great effect: there is a certain sense of pride in ""getting"" the allusions here, and that sense of self-satisfaction leads people (and I have been guilty of this myself) to overvalue a mediocre film because it makes them feel like part of a club, an elite group in the know. To me, though, that isn't enough: I want a film that stands on its own -- in-jokes and nods to horror lore should be icing on the cake. Here, too often, they ARE the cake.
In the director's commentary, he tells about a screening at a film festival in which several members of the audience walked out after 15 minutes. He thought the film was bombing, but they were actually leaving to bid on it. The film, oddly, feels as if he knew about this ahead of time, and put together 2/3s of a film tied together by a lame and gimmicky non-ending.
This film has some strengths, as I mentioned above, and I wouldn't be surprised if this director goes on to make some very good films working with superior scripts. This one, though, ultimately disappoints.",1079827200,,2189,4.732984293193717

I think the very worst feature of this awful film is the totally disjointed quality of some of the characters and situations that the moviemakers throw at us.

Why on earth would a brainless pot-head know anything at all about motor engines?

*Why did every other word have to be the F word; writers think it's cool..it just shows how void they are of any creative dialogue.

All the clichs are present, with sex equalling gory death, teens making foolish decisions, and rednecks going on rampages.
The movie supposed to be a dark comedy, but I didn't find it to be terribly funny. There were a couple of parts that did get me, though. The kid that plays Dennis, the boy who bites, rocks out. In the DVD extras, he really shows his stuff when he does a highly energetic, head-banging, kung fu staff-handling routine. The DVD is worth watching for this scene alone.

NOTE:  The Shinning said it all!  Most of all I wanted to understand why there were sooooo many Good & Bad reviews on this movie.  The movie should have been titled ""Virus in the Cabin"" not ""Cabin Fever""
I DIGRESS BUT HERE'S MY DISLIKING OF CABIN FEVER.....
The script was very degrading (lyrical content: POOR).  Even the worst of the worst movies have decent Scripting.  It was a shame to see the hospitable store clerk render such a poor display of feminine southern mentality, on top of that, using the ""N"" Word, and then went a step further by choosing stand in actors that actually took the script to render the greeting that the store clerk gestured (just so they could say they were in a movie).  That was more disgusting than the dog or the shaved legs.
The Director: Eli Roth was sitting there on the special features talking as if he made a work of art.  Here's my message to Mr. Eli Roth and his fans:
I would say that your movie had potential, but it was potential less.
YOU HAVE LITTLE CLASS!!!!

1949350,4,B0000VCZNE,"'Cabin Fever,' to me, was a really good film. Low budget, but very effective. The plot evolves around a group of five friends. They rent a cabin out in the sticks and soon after contract a flesh-eating virus. This film really sticks out -- gore-wise. The film shows the characters, after they get the virus, falling apart -- vomitting up blood, shaving skin off their legs and really bleeding from every orpheus. The film is really a cult-classic (or will be) due to the simple plot, tons of gore and characters you can relate to. Cabin Fever is just underappreciated, but that will change in the years to come (as will Rob Zombie's ""House of 1000 Corpses"".)",1078358400,,658,4.632478632478633

1949362,3,B0000VCZNE,"""Cabin Fever"" attempts to pay homage to the classics in a genre that has been collecting dust since the 80's, and succeeds in delivering a few jolts in the process. The story is well conceived, though the direction and especially the writing fails to make this movie stand out as anything other than a campy party movie that will gross out the more squeamish viewers. Read on, if you're interested...
The story begins like so many ""Friday the 13th"" movies have, with 5 college students decide to head up into the woods to celebrate the end of their finals by spending a week at a secluded cabin. The 5 kids are right out of the horror-clich handbook: The horny couple, the token stoner/misfit, and the painfully nice guy who wants nothing more than to get into a relationship with his frosty-box platonic girl friend. Before heading to the cabin, they are given the ominous warning to ""Stay out of the woods"", and as you might expect, they don't listen. One night they are paid a visit by a seriously sick and demented hermit, who appears to be carrying some sort of disease. The hermit dies in the lake, and infects their water supply, which spreads a parasite that causes the body to melt and break apart in the most gruesome fashion. What happens next is better seen than described, but gore-hounds will definitely be pleased.
The cast and crew are composed mainly of unknowns. Director Eli Roth is obviously on his first feature, and pulling out all the stops (assuming he might never get the chance again). Even by horror standards, the script is bad, making the characters as one-dimensional as possible. The one-liners, f-words, and obligatory sexual innuendos are a staple of the genre, and are given in mass quantity here, making the movie unintentionally funny at times. The acting is as inept as can be expected, though Cerena Vincent (best remembered as the perma-nude exchange student from ""Not Another Teen Movie"") stands out, and her scenes do not disappoint. The special effects are the payoff, however, with skin bubbling and melting, blood spewing, and plenty of gruesome dismemberments. The effects are very Tom Savini-inspired, and are very well done.
The DVD contains five commentaries (!), which is hefty considering that the movie hardly warrants a second viewing, let alone five. I haven't touched them, but the ""Beneath The Skin"" documentary (30 minutes) is fun to watch, consisting of interviews with the main cast and crew, while splicing in behind the scenes shots, including many of the effects pieces. What makes is fun is that nobody involved seems to take the movie too seriously, and obviously approached it as more of a fun project. The other extras are jokes, consisting of the 1 minute ""Family Version"", the movie shot in ""Chick Vision"", which cuts out all the jump scenes and gore shots for the sensitive girls watching, and the hilarious ""Rotten Fruit"" segments, which further displays Director Roth's obsession with rotting and decaying things. The sheer quantity of extras will keep you busy for almost 10 hours, though you have to wonder if a movie like this warrants that investment in time.
""Cabin Fever"" is gory and occasionally goofy, which made it a fun movie to watch the first time around, but with the shock value worn off, it is hard to find a reason to watch it again. It is average in every sense of the word, and is not likely to stand up to other time-honored horror classics. My recommendation is marginal.",1077926400,,3461,4.818487394957983

1949369,5,B0000VCZNE,"""Cabin Fever"" is one of those movies that you don't know where to categorize it.  Is it a creepy horror flick?  Does it show signs of hilarious comedy?  Or is this movie just going to be filled with gore?  ""Cabin Fever"" has all of these characteristics and that's why I'm thrilled with this film.  Horror movies are one of my favorite genres and I love when comedy is mixed into the bag.  I, like others, am not a huge fan of explicit gore, but this movie uses it to its full potential.
""Cabin Fever"" was directed by Eli Roth, who I'm hoping will do more work in the future.  His directing was fantastic and kept everything at a fast pace, but gave us time to learn about our characters and who they were and what they did.  Supposedly, Roth came up with the idea for the movie, because he had a flesh-eating virus himself.  It was kind of creepy when you learn that there are actually viruses out there.
Paul (Rider Strong), the kind, wise person, Bert (James DeBello), the idiot, but lovable guy, Karen (Jordan Ladd), the virginal sweetheart, Marcy (Cerina Vincent), the sexy, sweet girl, and Jeff (Joey Kern), the arrogant, mean guy, have just finished their finals and are going up to the mountains for some rest and relaxation.  They rent a cabin in the woods that is close to the local reservoir.  When they get there, they go there separate ways for the day.  Bert stumbles upon a hermit who keeps exclaiming, ""I'm s-i-i-c-c-k-k!!""  Bert, not knowing what to do, tries to shoot away at the man, hoping not to get his disease.  Bert, of course, does not tell the rest of the group.  That night the hermit tries to take their car into town.  The five finally burn him and he flees the area.  It is later that we learn that the infected man has landed in the reservoir and now the drinking water coming to the cabin has deadly bacteria.  Soon, Karen gets sick and the rest panic.  Jeff runs off with a six-pack of beer as his only drinking source.  Paul and Marcy stay at home with Karen.  Bert tries to get help from the local market store, but later is hunted because he too has the virus and has spread it to another person.  This basically sets up the whole plot of the film.
Plot - The plot of the movie was different for a change.  It wasn't like we had a regular killer in the woods scenario.  No, this time it was a bacteria.  Also, the idea of your friends turning on you is an intense thing.  Nobody can be trusted.  There are plot holes in the story though.  For instance, where did the virus come from?  Why did Dennis keep yelling, ""Pancakes"", and doing all this kung fu?  Where did the giant bunny come from?  If you see the movie, you probably be thinking the same question.  Yet, overall the plot was very good.  Plot - 92/100
Acting - I thought the acting was off and on.  Rider Strong did an okay job as Paul.  I just don't see him as the lead in the film.  He had his moments though.  Joey Kern did a great job as the mean-spirited Jeff.  I really didn't like his character and it just shows how much time Kern put his time into it.  I thought Cerina Vincent showed her acting abilities to the best.  She actually cried at one point in the film.  I don't know if it was because her friends were dying or she figured that she was going to die.  Either way, it was good to see that.  Yet, again the man who stands out is James DeBello.  He is by far, my favorite of all rising stars.  In my Detroit Rock City review, I stated the same thing about how he stole the show.  He does the same here.  In the beginning, I had a dislike for him.  As the film progressed, I really came to care about his character and what happened to him.  Instead of being the cocky jerk, he turned into the responsible, caring guy.  The acting was great.  Acting - 95/100
Special FX/Gore - First off, this movie wasn't keen on special effects and I give it credit for that.  Today, in horror films, there is all this CGI and I don't like that.  Only when a film needs it (Jeepers Creepers 2 for example), I understand.  Eli Roth knew that he didn't need any computer images in this movie.  I thank him for that.  He said he paid homage to other ""old-school"" horror movies also.  I heard that some parts of the movie were paying respects to them like Dawn of the Dead (still have to view), Night of the Living Dead, Evil Dead, and more.  There was a lot of gore in this movie though.  As stated before, I'm not a total fan of all the blood and guts, but this movie used it perfectly.  It didn't overuse it, but it was done effectively.  There are some nasty things though (many girls may never shave their legs again).  Yet, it was done outstandingly.  Special FX/Gore - 100/100 (because they didn't use any), and 94/100
Pacing - The pacing in the movie was very good.  It isn't exactly as fast paced as ""Wrong Turn"" (you can see that review also), but it still was good.  It took its time, by letting us get to know who these five people were.  You actually care about the characters and what is happening to them.  It makes you more interesting in the story and when the good parts start coming, you're glued.  It gets going halfway in and doesn't stop.  Pacing - 94/100
Overall - 95/A - An enjoyable experience that was too good to be true.  It was fun, gory, hilarious, corny, and intriguing.  Supposedly, there is to be a sequel.  If they do make one, they better take a lot of time and effort into making it really great.",1077753600,4,5424,4.279092702169625
1949370,4,B0000VCZNE,"""Cabin Fever"" probably turned my stomach more than any horror film I have seen in a long time, which is actually intended to be a compliment when you consider how many of these films attempt to do so and only end up being laughable.  The premise has the virtue of not relying on anything supernatural.  A group of five college students head for a cabin in the woods so they can party hearty, but they run into a hermit (Arie Verveen) who has some flesh-eating disease that is getting really, really bad.  It will not surprise you that the kids end up trapped in the cabin and that some of them start coming down with the disease.  In case you are not clear on how this is going to happen lots of ominous music by Angelo Badalamenti and/or Nathan Barr is provided to reinforce the hints given by the camera.
The problem is that the moments of horror, such as when Paul (Rider Strong) discovers that Karen (Jordan Ladd) is sick, are not in the service of a better film.  It would be interesting to have one of these films in which you actually minded if these kids died off one by one.  First time director Eli Roth exhibits true technical competence, a clear sign that he was weaned on this genre, but he actually proves to be too good for his own good in this 2003 film.  Roth clearly has a sense of humor (check out ""Cabin Fever: The Family Version"" and the other special features on the DVD), but since he really creates some moments of true revulsion, the funny stuff seems out of place.  Splatter flicks tend to have a lot of humor in them because the horror ends up being so campy that you might as well pretend the whole film is a joke.  That is not the case here.  Ironically, the DVD comes with ""Chick Vision,"" where a pair of ""hands"" cover up most of the screen so it is difficult to see the bad stuff, which would actually convince you this is your standard low-budget splatter flick and not one that has moments that go for the jugular.
Another problem is that Roth is clearly working in homages to other classic films, from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" to ""Evil Dead,"" that only serve to work against his own endeavor.  The locals are pretty much ""Deliverance"" rejects and part of the ending smacks too much of ""The Night of the Living Dead,"" further dispelling the film's best moments.  Then Roth tacks on a series of final ironies that strips away the remaining horror elements so that the scenes that had us freaking out seem like distant memories of another film.  Certainly Deputy Winston (Giuseppe Andrews) wandered in from some tacky low-budget horror film, apparently to further sabotage this one.  I have no doubt that Roth thought the comedy and the homages were necessary parts of this film, but after you have watched ""Cabin Fever"" review the film in your mind, take away those parts, and think about how long this film would have kept you up at night after watching it for the first time.
However, there is reason to believe that one day Roth is going to figure out how to either integrate the horror or abandon it completely, and make a horror film that could be one of the scariest of all time.  There are so many moments in ""Cabin Fever"" that show an understanding of true horror and are going to stick with you, that makes it clear the kid has got potential in this genre.  The only thing that might stop Roth is when he gets real money to make a movie, because that could actually stifle his creativity.  But I really think that if Roth were to stop referencing other works and moderate the humor, he would be the odds on favorite to make the horror film that would be ""The Exorcist"" for this generation.",1077494400,4,3635,4.442105263157894
1949371,4,B0000VCZNE,"I didn't expect this movie to be good. When I rented it I thought it would be just another run of the mill B movie that would give me a scare or two if I was lucky, and then I would forget it, but I was very happily surprised.
The movie does start out with the pre-requsite teens going into to the woods to party at an isolated cabin, and there is some unexplainable disease, no surprises there, but after the movie gets going and the characters begin to develop their little quirks the story is both disgusting and hilarious.
I did get scared a couple of times, and I definitely got creeped out by the disease stuff. The part with the girl shaving her legs really makes me happy I have an electric shaver...ewwwww!
The townfolk hillbillies are great, especially little Dennis and the store owner.
It is the smart, unexpected humor and character development that pull this movie out of the crowd.

1949392,2,B0000VCZNE,"""Cabin Fever"" is an absolute bloodbath, with enough splatter across the cabin to keep most blood fiends pretty happy. This movie is also really funny, and I wish the director would have kept going with this humour, as this movie could have been better than it was. The comedy is the strongest parts of this film, as there is little or no actual scariness here, since the bloodletting is more humorous than anything.
The cast here is decent, nothing spectacular but nothing horrible. The usual suspects are here: the vixen, the girl-next-door, the funny guy, the jock and the weakling who proves to be courageous by the end. I can't tell if ""Cabin Fever"" was supposed to be more of a satire of the slasher genre, or if this is meant to be taken seriously.
Either way, this is not a good movie, as there is not enough horror for it to be a good horror movie and not enough comedy to be a satire or comedy. Unless you are a huge fan of more classically styled horror movies, then don't bother with ""Cabin Fever"".",1077321600,,1009,4.45945945945946

The plot line has so many holes in it, you have no idea what the hell is going on, or for that matter, why...also, the acting was especially bad. I have seen better acting in the first few Friday the 13th movies, and if you know them, you know how humorously campy those movies are. Please, if you are thinking of purchasing this movie, at least rent it before you buy. Then, you can come to your own conclusion.

1949395,5,B0000VCZNE,"It was hard to tell what to expect out of this movie. I had heard opinions from complete opposite ends of the spectrum. Some loved it to death, while others completely loathed it. Needless to say, however, my opinion of this movie is a good one. In fact, I LOVED it. 'Cabin Fever' pays homage to the great horror flicks of the late 70's into the 80's. Taking it's premise from Sam Raimi's classic 'Evil Dead,' the movie revolves around five recent college grads, who head out to the woods for one last weekend of carefree partying before entering the real world. However, things turn more than sour when one character contracts a deadly flesh eating virus through the drinking water (although no one manages to figure it out until the end). Gradually, everyone turns on each other, which turns into madness, which turns into a bloody good time. This movie's main asset is the love story between Paul (Ryder Strong, who has the best XXX name, ever) and Karen (Jordan Ladd). Since the action doesn't really kick in until an hour into the movie, this movie spends a lot of time on exposition. We really get inside the heads of the main characters, that way when they are puking blood, being attacked by vicious dogs, being beaten to death with a shovel, etc. etc., we care. The outside characters, which basically consist of out-of-touch hillbillies (one of them only appears to be racist) are rather interesting and make the movie that much more disturbing (I especially loved that Dennis kid with the mullet). The movie does play with a lot of dark humor (especially the ending) which might turn off a lot of people expecting a full out splatter flick. However, if you are familiar with 'Evil Dead 2,' you can pretty much know what to expect. The movie manages to be seriously scary, depressing and creepy all while injecting humourous elements, which is nearly impossible for most movies to acheive. The subtle references to other, older genre flicks was a nice touch for a fan such as myself (a revised version of a song that appeared in Wes Craven's debut, 'Last House On The Left' makes it's way here). And really, if you're not a fan of the genre and don't want to laugh in between watching people rot, then I advise you stay away. The extras on the DVD are more light-hearted than the movie. We get a 45 second ""family version"" of the film, a series of claymation shorts by Eli Roth by the name of ""Rotten Fruit,"" which are hilarious and have nothing to do with this movie, a 25 minute documentary on the making of the movie (it's actually interesting!) and of course, Chick Vision, which places super-imposed hands on the screen everytime a scary part happens.

I have to say, of all the negative reviews I've read on Amazon, I think this movie has the most harsh I've ever seen.  Everyone hated this movie!  From the Scream/I Know What You Did... fans to the classic true horror fans.  Well, I know this negative criticism was meant to keep you away, but after all that I had to see this film.  I had to see why so many reviewers said, ""this is the worst movie I have ever seen"".  After viewing it, here's my verdict:  Far from the worst movie I've ever seen, but nothing too impressive.  I like the attempt and being nostalgic on Eli's part, but it just came across as very half-assed.  It seemed to me like a few Troma films I've seen before.  It's basically a direct to video feature that somehow got a theatrical release.  And it's not nearly as gory as people seem to think.  Then again, this is coming from an Italian horror fan.  If you're a casual horror film watcher, yes, this is a bit excessive, but no more than From Dusk Till Dawn.  In the featurette, you see that this film is clearly a labor of love for everyone involved.  Eli seems to be patting himself on the back a little too hard though.  I can see potential though.  If he continues to do nostalgic, exploitation horror flicks, he could certainly crank out a winner.  He didn't this time around however.  Better luck next time.",1076976000,,1475,4.294545454545455
1949401,1,B0000VCZNE,"For those of you expecting a ""serious"" horror movie as I was, you will be sadly disappointed.  This movie--which for the uninitiated is about a cabin full of teens exposed to a deadly, flesh-eating virus--cannot make up its mind whether it wants to be darkly comedic, campy, ironic, or legitimately scary, intermixing elements of all of the aforementioned genres without really achieving any one of them.  As such, the movie comes off as a pathetic, low budget horror flick.
Much of the acting is intentionally b-movie grade, and the film is generally more laughable than scary.  The filmmakers seem to have confused disgusting with scary, as the blood & dismemberment quotient is high without any really fearful side effects for the viewer. As a result the film winds up being a slightly unusual but highly predictable ""teens in the woods"" flick, replete with excessive explicit language, nudity, and gore.  The only positive thing I can say is that the filmmakers did come up with some imaginative ways to kill people.
Perhaps the most tragic error the filmmakers commit is to reveal too much too soon in terms of exposition.  The film could have at least been tolerably interesting if the filmmakers had waited until later into the film to disclose what is spreading the deadly infection.  Instead, they make a huge point of disclosing it less than 20 minutes into the movie, thereby spoiling any level of mystery or surprise.  Then again, given the lowest-common denominator target audience of the film, any such subtlety in the plot probably would have been lost on most of the intended viewership.
Probably the saddest commentary on the film is that the most clever parts of the DVD were the opening menu and the beginning of the credits.  The highlights (and I use the term loosely) of the content in-between are a deputy reminiscent of a Jim Carrey character, an oddly effeminate boy named Dennis who bites people who sit next to him, and a lemonade stand.  If you're a fan of so-bad-it's-good acting, you'll be rolling.  Otherwise, you'll wish as I did that the virus would spread a lot faster so the film could be over sooner and we could all be out of our misery.",1076976000,,2174,4.804289544235925
1949422,3,B0000VCZNE,"Cabin Fever (Eli Roth, 2002)
In retrospect, I have to say this is the best movie of its kind I've ever seen.
""Of its kind"" does not refer to it being a horror film, but to it being a series of homages to other things with a barely-constructed plot of its own. Flicks from The Birds to Deliverance to Army of Darkness to everything in between are paid homage here in various ways, and the end result is a silly, sick piece of moviemaking that is fun, but nothing much more than that.
Five college pals, done with finals, head out to the woods from some R&R. Jeff (XX/XY's Joey Kern) and girlfriend Marcy (yellow Power Ranger Cerina Vincent, playing catchup with Amy Jo Johnson in the ""let's see ho much flesh I can bare"" race) are accompanied by Jeff's best friend Bert (James DeBello from Detroit Rock City and American Pie) and their pals Paul (Rider Strong of Boy Meets World fame) and Karen (Jordan Ladd, star of the upcoming Bill Butler flick Madhouse), who keep meaning to hook up but, well, never get around to it. They're all set to party, but things get a little sidetracked when a hermit (Arie Verveen of The Thin Red Line) infected with necrotizing fascitis shows up. Needless to say, people start getting infected, everyone gets paranoid, and it ain't much of a party, except to the local sherriff's deputy, Winston (Two Guys, A Girl, and a Pizza' Place's Giuseppe Anthony) and camping skater-dude Grim (played by Roth himself).
The best part about this movie is playing ""spot the homage."" You should find at least twenty; I lost count after that. There's also a handful of fun special effects (Roth is from the Hideshi Hino school of gore, never a bad thing), comic relief, some decent acting from the cast of rising stars, gratuitous nudity and violence, and, in general, everything you want from a brainless horror film.

Cabin Fever does have it's share of good points though: the performances from Detroit Rock City co-stars James DeBello and Giuseppe Andrews are funny and help carry the film along, and there is plenty of blood and guts, and the scene where one of the girls who is contagious decides to shave her legs is gut churning.  Director Eli Roth tried to make a fun horror film, and Cabin Fever kind of works in that method, but one can't help but feel disappointed after viewing this.  Cabin Fever is still worth a look for older horror fans who enjoyed other recent Lions Gate horror films like House of 1000 Corpses, May, and Frailty, but don't go in with high expectations.",1076371200,,1041,4.580645161290323

1. The teenagers move the sick girl to a shed outside the cabin to avoid getting the ""disease"", yet hours later they seem to have no problem touching her and getting her blood all over themselves.  Why didn't they just lock her up in the room in the first place?
2. Again, these characters are supposed to be avoiding the ""disease"" at all costs, yet one of the teenage morons dives right into a reservior which contains one of the dead diseased bodies!  Way to avoid all contact with the disease, moron!
3. What the heck was up with the little kid at the country store?  ""Pancake pancake""!  Little bit of karate here, a little arm-biting there.  What in the heck was the point of that?
4. The guy that swallows his harmonica.  Did the filmmakers assume this movie would eventually show up on MST3000?
I heard great things about this movie, but I'm wondering if they saw a different version than I did.  What a waste of my time!",1076284800,5,1173,4.4186046511627906

But a few people here at this site brought this movie up for their reviews of a better horror film, ""Wrong Turn.""  At least ""Wrong Turn"" had a discernable story, with a direction for the characters to follow.  This steaming heap of refuse is simply a mess.  The acting is bad, the plotting and editing is worse, and this movie is just gory for gore's sake.  Sure, Fangoria fans will lap up this garbage for the decent make-up effects and half the characters spewing blood everywhere, but it serves no purpose other than to be as nasty as possible. At no time did I care whether any of these characters made it out alive.  Another thing that is growing tiresome is that whenever there is a group of teenagers in the woods alone, they apparently have a collective IQ of 60.  Now, I'm no longer a teen, but I still believe teens are more intelligent than the ones portrayed in these gore-fests.  It would be a lot more interesting if they were to fight back using ingenuity or just plain grit and tenacity.

>>>OK what really got me to like this movie so much..
>>>>The way they acted toward each other.. It was just so real how they turned on each other..their mannerism toward each other was so realistic.
>>>One of they girls who gets the virus first ....they throw her in a shed and lock her up and she basically rots away
>>This part I really can't type it here so I will try to use proper words.. after two of them have sex.. the guy dumps Listerine on his____well you know. Because he doesn't want to get the virus. Funny but people in a state of panic would probably do such a thing.

1949502,4,B0000VCZNE,"To start with, I don't know very many college students who would take off for break and head up to a desolate cabin far in the woods rather than Ft. Lauderdale for some more typical college fun.  But let's thank them, for we know that a desolate cabin in the woods is an excellent backdrop for some bloody horrific action.
A Zombie/Plague/Night of the Living Dead plot takes 5 college students out into the woods for a quiet break.  Before heading up to the cabin, they make a last minute stop at a tiny local store, with a (literally) wild boy sitting out front, and a funny old man at the register with some shocking things to say.  Pay attention here!
As they settle into their cabin, Bert takes a walk off by himself with a rifle to shoot a squirrel or something, and winds out accidentally shooting a strange man.  As the man picks himself up and pleads with Bert to help him, Bert can see that he is *very* sick, and warns the man away from him.
Back at the cabin later, the sick man finds them, again begging for help, and spies Bert behind the others.  ""Hey, you *shot* me!""  Bert warns his friends that the man is sick and they lock him outside, where he tries to steal their vehicle.  A little mania follows, along with baseball bats and vomiting blood and setting strangers ablaze, and our movie takes off with its plot.
With a vehicle too damaged to drive, the group decides that they need to find a mechanic and also a sheriff to report last night's incident to.  With all but Marcy and Paul gone, the sheriff does show up, a ridiculous (on purpose) character on a pedal bike, who wants to talk about partying more than actually investigate a crime scene.
He leaves with promises to send a tow truck, and the others return without any luck in finding a mechanic.  Things go downhill from here when Marcy gets sick, with the same odd illness the stranger at the door had.  She seems to be melting.  And now the fun begins, as they realize they need to leave and the locals realize they need to be contained.
This is an enjoyable suspense/horror movie because it strays from the slasher forum, but despite some mighty fine flesh rotting scenes, it lacked in the gore fest category.  Don't miss Karen shaving her legs, or the vicious dog, and *definitely* don't miss the ending; an out of the blue surprise that left me laughing my tail off.

1949503,1,B0000VCZNE,"I had pretty high expectations for Cabin Fever.  I mean how could you go wrong with a flesh eating virus attacking a bunch of kids while they ""vacation"" in the woods.  At the very least the gore factor should be quite high.  Boy was I wrong.  Cabin fever turned out to be a not only a huge disappointment, but easily one of the worse horror movie I've seen in a long time.  I've mentioned before that I like a lot of horror movies that others do not, but this movie is painful to watch.  The directors try to make it a dark comedy while paying homage to horror movies such as Evil Dead and Night of the Living Dead.  In the end the story is incoherently pieced together with the main characters doing such unbelievably stupid things, it is just plain bad.  As for gore, you would think there would at least be some pretty good scenes, but even that is a disappointment.  The make up effects are passable, but nothing spectacular.
The quality of the DVD is pretty good.  Sound and picture are sharp.  Extras include deleted scenes and five (yes five) commentary tracks.  Honestly I could not bring myself to watch the movie again so did not listed to any of the commentaries.  If you are looking for good modern horror, check out Wrong Turn, House of 1000 Corpses, or the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Even Freddy vs. Jason is a better choice.

1949504,1,B0000VCZNE,"Right then. This film has been getting quite a mixed reception from media and the general public so I thought I'd lose my Amazon review cherry by offering my opinions on this movie.
Cabin Fever has been hailed by some as being the saviour of the low-budget horror genre, others though consider it to be the worst movie ever made. I unfortunatley fell heavily into the latter camp when I paid my hard earned cash to watch it.
I really wanted to love this movie. It was the end of the summer and myself and a few mates decided at the last minute to pay a visit to the local cinema. One of the group had seen a trailer for Cabin Fever and thought it would be a good laugh. This friend is now in a shed in the middle of nowhere having his face chewed off by a rabid water vole. I was imaging the film to be one of three movie types a) A rehash of the Blair Witch b) Your usual teen slasher flick, nothing special but great popcorn fodder c) An Evil Dead style independent film that was fresh and full of individuality and charm. Cabin Fever was none of these things. From the very start I could tell this film was bad news. The group of actors cobbled together for this movie will hopefully never work in the mainstream again and I can only hope that Eli Roth is now safely locked away somewhere.
I was neither grossed out nor scared by this film. The make-up effects were passable but nothing spectacular. I'll admit to laughing a couple of times during the movie. That whole thing with the Hanson kid and his pancakes was hilarious. But as soon as my initial roar of laughter calmed down I was impelled to question quite loudly ""what the f*** was that all about?"". Noone else in the cinema was sure either. I could really sense discomfort in the audience as noone was quite sure exactly what they were watching on the screen.
This film left me puzzled for a long time after - my main confusion being why I had spent any money to watch this shoddy flick. There seemed to be no passion from the cast, there were also so many random moments in the film that I can only imagine the director believed would be witty, but that just came across as a desperate attempt to fill some time. That whole section where the group wandered off to try and  find help - where the hell did that boat come from? There were two good points in the film - I'm not going to lower myself by telling you what they were (.)(.). Whoops. Ummm, I really can't be bothered to write anymore on the subject. Like the film, I think I'll just tail off and start loosing all structure and sense. Wibble. Yep. That outta do it.

I thought the characters were absolutely stupid and un-intelligent when the times to PANIC came...they had no clue what to do and had no common sense.  The whole idea of a skin disease, to me, was a bad idea as well...they should've made it in the style of the Blair Witch Project.  I read that the movie was about supernatural happenings out in the woods and that sounded intriguing to me...but no...completely different.  I also find it funny that Peter Jackson saw the movie.  In the theatrical trailer I saw of it on TV, the commentary guy said ""It's one of the freshest new scary movies to come out"" says Peter Jackson, the director of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy...yeah...WRONG!

This film features some of the most blatantly and ridiculously excessive amounts of disgusting, disturbing and revolting images, though I suppose these aspects wouldn't serve the integrity of the ""horror"" genre, if the viewer didn't come away disturbed in one way or another. The story? A group of teens head up to a cabin, and one of the members encounter this scary, and seemingly disoriented guy who was carrying this mysterious ""fever."" Upon contacting him, this fever is transmitted to one person, and then, before you know it, almost every other member of the group has contracted this skin and flesh-eating virus. Like a few other reviewers noted, in some ways, this film was funny, and bordered on sheer silliness - especially with the sheer amount of profanity used by many of the members of the group, which almost gives the film something of a parodical element. I'm not sure I'd watch this film over and over again, unless I have much more of a masochistic streak than I otherwise would have thought - or, if I wish to invent a more natural way of expurgating the contents in my stomach.

1949507,4,B0000VCZNE,"Yes, Finally Cabin Fever on DVD! I really enjoyed this movie in the theater when I saw it, so I decided to buy it on DVD. When I saw this movie in the theater I liked it alot, but it wasn't what I expected to see. I thought it was going to be a serious slasher type  horror flick, but it turned out to be what I thought was a cheesy horror flick that was so bad it was funny and fun to watch.
I admit when I saw the movie a second time on DVD I liked it even more! Now I understand that this wasn't supposed to be a serious horror flick, but rather a dark morbid comedy in a horror movie setting.
As others have mentioned, this movie is about a flesh eating virus. The cast plays a bunch of graduated college kids who take a vacation (somewhere in the south)in the cabin. Certain things happen that leave them stranded at the cabin, which is not good news since the virus is spreading.
This is an adult movie. Lots of strong language, some nudity and lots of blood. Usually I find it hard to respect movies that have these adult themes, but it all makes Cabin Fever the great movie that it is. Rider Strong from boy meets world leads the cast with a excellent performance and the rest of the cast is great too!
This DVD has some nice special features including The family friendly version and Chick Vision. All the special features clue you into the fact that Cabin Fever is not a horror movie, but a dark comedy horror film.. For example the chick vision feature throws some virtual hands over the movie screen to block out the scary parts.
I had 2 dissapointments. One is that the DVD didn't have a alternate ending. The ending in the movie I like because I am such a fan, but many people will not like it! Last, I wish the director explained what the Bugs bunny doctor was doing in the hospital at the end of the film.

Who bribed Peter Jackson and the handful of reviewers that praised this film? And what's with the clueless internet buzz that built interest in this trash (Ain't it Cool Hype)? The first rule of making a horror film is it should be SCARY... not so hard, ask Wes Craven or Tobe Hooper... But director Eli Roth, who appears to know something about past horror classics, fails at creating tension and can't seem to sustain or pay off the few moments of suspense he manages to achieve. The sex and gore feel uncomfortably gratuitous since they neither titillate nor shock. Unfortunately, there's just nothing fresh about this film and it only makes the horror genre feel all the more stale. Roth's commentary on the DVD is far funnier than any of his screenplay's lame attempts at gallows humor. He pats himself on the back for borrowing every hackneyed horror cliche and applauds even the most pedestrian technical achievements. In fairness, the photography isn't bad and production design works. The acting seemed passable to me in spite of a disjointed narrative and some downright ridiculous dialogue.

However, something goes wrong when they are exposed to a flesh-eating virus that infects one of them and now threatens all of them.  Cabin Fever begins with an interesting plot, but that is all that happens to the story as the audience can see a cascade of terrible storytelling.  Even the occasional jokes do not provide a foundation that could save the film.  Most of the time the audience will feel lost and wonder what purpose the characters have as the director jumps back and forth between scenes without aim.  In the end, Cabin Fever offers a cinematic experience that causes an annoying itch in the mind, why did I pay for this.",1075248000,3,749,4.559701492537314
1949543,4,B0000VCZNE,"One of the things that makes Cabin Fever a genuinely fun outing for horror fans is the cast and crew's obvious enthusiasm for what they're doing.  Even without viewing the entertaining (if rather short on substance) ""Making of"" featurette, you can easily tell that the film was a labor of love with a game cast.  While the extras don't shed much light on the film's progress from unsellable script to most-hyped horror film of 2003-- which would undoubtedly have made for a fascinating story-- the movie is (almost) enough of a delight to make up for it.
Cabin Fever takes pretty much every convention of ""classic""  drive-in horror films of the 70's, and manages to make them look new again.  Curmudgeons may say that it's nothing more than a Scream-esque parody of horror movie chestnuts, but the approach is really quite different.  Instead of self-conscious winks to the audience, the walking cliches of Cabin Fever seem to enjoy playing their roles to the hilt, with performances that are as much tribute as spoof.  One of the most entertaining aspects of the film is that the lead characters, each a counterpart of a 70's-horror staple, are almost uniformly unlikable.  Instead of counting on us to hope that the smug hipster, the ice queen, and the obnoxious jock manage to escape the killer's clutches, we can finally enjoy seeing them get what we thought they deserved all along.  I mean, did anyone REALLY identify with any of those too-good-to-be-true high school superstars?
Cabin Fever won't have you leaving the nightlight on, although it does boast some solid shocks.  It might be a bit of a letdown for fans of gore, but for my part I'm thankful that the more intensely violent moments were off-camera.  Otherwise it might have been too dificult to watch.
The most striking thing about the film is its big-budget look.  The directing is confident, the performances are strong, the effects are convincing, and the photography is excellent (unlike most of its ancestors).  The DVD transfer's color is glorious, and the sound really fills a room.  It belies its independent origins every step of the way, right down to the Angelo Badalamenti score (the composer's hilarious account of his involvement with the film is one of the featurette's high points).  In most ways, the pricey DVD release doesn't disappoint.  Most highly recommended to horror fans with a sense of humor.
Note: the DVD also includes several short claymation features by director Roth that star a fruitbasket of British rockers who spend most of their time causing mayhem and squirting their own juices over everything in sight.  A pleasant enough addition, but they aren't really anything to get excited about.  Other features include the clever-yet-useless ""Chickvision"" option, and a short called ""Pancakes"" that shows just how much fun the creators were having with their project.  Although when the subject grows up, he just might sue them for defamation of character.... The five(!) commentary tracks could probably have been boiled down into just one or two, but their easygoing tone adds to feeling of good-natured fun that went into the production.",1075248000,19,3140,5.005769230769231

1949546,5,B0000VCZNE,"Its true that every time a unique and clever movie finally sneaks into theaters most people either ignore it or simply wright it off from a bad trailer. Cabin Fever sadly fell into this category. Most people would probably think this is a brainless cheap teen horror movie just like Urban Legend, Soul Survivors, and all the other crap thats come out in the past. For anyone who has been awaiting a modern day ""Evil Dead"" return, this is it! Cabin Fever revitalizes the gross out horror comdey era with new and inventive cinematography that any Film Major will appreciate. The Writer/Producer/Director Eli Roth is truly a gifted filmmaker. He took a recyled horror movie formula and added a whole new artistic even independent film feel to it.
For all you David Lynch and Twin Peaks fans this may interest you as well. Eli Roth was actually associated with David Lynch on several of his films and used many of his teachings in this film. Even the select themes (such as Deput Winston's Theme) where composed by Angelo Badalamente, (I know I spelled it wrong) the same composer from Twin Peaks, and all of Lynch's other films. Anyone who says this film was too serious or overly gory needs to re-examine the movie! Its all a joke! I mean a kid doing kung foo and screaming ""Pankcakes!"" and the crazy Deput Winston, who just wants to Party, even when he sees a truck COVERED in blood!? In my opinion Cavin Fever has finally done what movie fans have wanted for years. Basically just have a funny (not stupid) horror movie that ends in a real 70's horror movie style. Still, not all viewers respect these type of movies and brush them off without even giving them a chance. Too bad, but all I have to say to that is ""Do you realize how many great parties where gonna have!?""",1075248000,3,1771,4.554858934169279
1949547,3,B0000VCZNE,"I'm being very generous with my 3 star rating.
The film starts off just fine. The story is actually genuine and the acting was good IMO. Instead of some psycho killer chasing young men and women it's a water borne pathogen that disentigrates the flesh and once it starts there is no stopping it. I really liked this flick up until the last 20 minutes or so.
Apparently the makers of this film couldn't think of an ending so they just kill 'em all off and never explain how this virus began. How very weak and uncreative.
To add insult to injury, in an attempt to make the movie watcher forget they didn't know how to end it, they finish it off with a dose of humor. A very sad attempt at humor to boot. Keep in mind this isn't a funny movie.
It's too bad. It had a good beginning and solid story throughout but what sticks in my mind the most is the ending, which blew*.

I also hate movies where the creators have no sense of humor, because this movie failed miserably in the black humor department.  It would've worked better if released in the 80s, because that's about what it looks like, a poorly made 80s film.

Since that is out of the way.  Lets talk about the movie, since I alway said, ""If you like the movie, then who cares about anything else.!?"".
With praise from Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings Director in case you've been in a cave for the past 3 years), I was really looking foward to this fright film.  The movie is made by Eli Roth, and there is no dought he loves the horror genre.  He pulls off camera work and stunts found in Evil Dead and Texas Chainsaw Massacure, just to name a few that I remember.  This in no way hurts the film, I say if your going to rip people off....then might as well be from the best in the genre.
The story is about a college students, going camping, one gets infected by a flesh eatting virus and then they start to turn on each other for their own survival.  No one is to be trusted, since no one is really safe...infected or not.
The movie has a great set up, a great idea, and a great feel to it....the only thing that hurts it is the lame and largly out of place sense of humor found in it.  This is no movie for that kind of stuff.  The horror found it is too dark and the setting too moody.  A feeling of death overruns the film and so there is no place for comedy. The last 10 minutes belong on another movie!!
Their are some great creapy parts in the movie (rent this for the shaving scene) but in the end the desire to put in comedy and humor in the blender with all the right ingrendints....makes this one turn out sour and dissapointing.",1075075200,,1626,4.100946372239748

It's an O.K. movie, but is so cliched that you can tell in which order everyone of them will die in (except for the ending, you can't really predict that). The gore isn't really amazing, or gross out, (not as guesome as the critics said) and the story just wants to drag on and on and on (well you get the picture). The cast is pretty terrible with the exception of the two characters from ""Detroit Rock City"" (James DeBello and Giuseppe Andrews). The script has so many holes in it, that it truly is pathedic. I've seen cheesy horror films, but they atleast tried to be cheezy/funny, this is neither.

1949600,3,B0000VCZNE,"Best:
1) If you like lots of blood in your horror movies, this ones delivers big time. It's comparable to the ""Evil Dead"" series in that respect.
2) The makeup effects for rotting flesh and desicated corpses are comparable to that used in big-budget movies.
3) All the girl stars in the movie have nude scenes.
4) There are special features including 3 commentary tracks, a couple of behind-the-scenes shows and 3 episodes of a stop-motion animation series called ""Rotten Fruit"" (with very cool comical splattering).
Worst:
1) It wasn't scary - just bloody - and the funny moments were few and far between.
2) There's no reason to become emotionally invested in the main characters, so you don't really care if they live or die.
3) The first half of the movie is relatively slow.
Recommendation:
This isn't a horror movie, but rather a gross-out flick (like they used to make back in the 70's and 80's). The only thing you'll take away are memories of blood and nudity. It does, however, rise above most independent films in quality and execution.

1949601,5,B0000VCZNE,"I can't quite comprehend why so large a group of people despised this movie.  I have read a number of the derogatory reviews and it seems to me that the recurrent complaint is that Cabin Fever is unoriginal, slow, and hardly scary.  I am taken aback by these opinions because these descriptions do not apply to the film I viewed.  Okay, so the setting is slightly purloined from the Evil Dead films.  So there is a myriad of references or homages to classic horror films like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Last House on the Left.  So What?  Does that in any way detract from the viewing pleasure?  Please cite one horror movie of the past ten years that didn't recycle a concept or a goddamn setting for a movie that preceded it.  I myself thought that the way it was akin to all those great 70s and 80s horror movies was terrific.  It reminded me of a time when horror movies were enjoyable and not perfidiously pandered as the kitschy cannon fodder of Scream-like movies.  It made me ruminate the joviality I received when I first saw Evil Dead.  It's not scary?  Tell me, when was the last time a horror movie was actually frightening?  Evil Dead IS NOT scary, but it is immensely enjoyable and fun.  Nightmare on Elm St is no longer scary to me, but that does not in any way impede with my enjoyment.  I would honestly assume that fans of the genre (and Evil Dead, etc) would be thrilled to experience something that payed earnest tribute to their idols.  I suppose I assumed wrong, as most people have disregarded this as drivel.

""Cabin Fever"" starts with the obligatory group of young kids who go for a trip into the country for the weekend.

Second, the characters and the direction of the story/action was original while the overall feeling of the film wasn't. The music deserves special attention as well. I've read and have heard numerous interviews by Eli Roth or from people who know him and I do not doubt his sincerity to the genre. I think that this is a great stepping stone to what he might possibly unleash in the next couple of years. Sure, this film has homages to other great films but instead of taking these images and giving them a twist, they were merely presented again so that we could all pat ourselves on the back for getting the references. On his solo commentary track, Eli Roth makes fun of Film School Pretentiousness which exists--but in different forms. I think this film is pretentious but that is not a bad thing necessarily. This is the work of man who grew up watching the early 80's sex comedies and Fulci/Cronenberg films and decided to mix it up with Evil Dead and others and see where it took him. Alot of this film is fun and beautiful and sick, but that is part of its charm. It's also copied without the least bit of irony and in a film school sort of way, that's charming too.

1949630,2,B0000VCZNE,"Millennia ago, primitive man found fear from the unknown.  That same fear exists today in each of us.  Call it what you will, but ultimately it boils down to horror.  A dictionary definition refers to it as, ""...as sense of dread or forboding"".  A film character, in a haunted house, looks at the doorknob to her room as it slowly turns (only she's supposed to be alone).  The emotion that she feels could well be defined as horror.  When you are alone and you have the distinct feeling that there is someone else there - that's horror.
There is a distinct difference between horror and gore.  Cabin Fever is a gore film.  It is not a horror film.  That said, let's take a look at it on its own merits...
Cabin Fever is neither particularly scary, nor is it original in the least bit.  It borrows so much of its storyline from a multitude of other films (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, The Evil Dead, to name a few).
The actors are all unknowns with the exception of the lead boy (Rider Strong) who was formerly on Boy Meets World, a television show.
The premise is this: college kids rent a cabin in the deep woods for a week, but somehow manage to catch a severe case of the dreaded (sarcasm) flesh eating bacteria.
There's some doper who stumbles across them as they tell ""campfire"" ghost stories to each other outside the cabin - which makes no sense, because the cabin has a fireplace - for no reason than to later end up as a footnote in the carnage.  (And why is his dog in such a bad mood?).
There's the three rednecks sharing a single brain with murder on their mind for no darned reason at all (this whole storyline even includes a semi-retarded kid ala ""Deliverance"").
To be certain there is lots and lots of gore.  The filmmakers must have gone through gallons of Kayro syrup and red food coloring, because the blood looks anything but like the real thing.  That's not to say that this film isn't gross - because that is one thing it really is.
Gross.
If you are actually past your teen years you'll probably look away from the screen as I did.  Not in fear or horror - but because gross is just not scary - it's shock value only.
I thought I was going to see a horror film - not a gore film.  I can't say that I recommend this film unless you want to see one pair of quite obviously surgically enhanced breasts and a young man (Rider Strong), who desperately either needs to shave both his face and that nasty patch of hair on his chest (and trim that pit hair while you're at it) or hit the gym - because, yuuuck - it's a horror all on it's own.",1074643200,,2597,4.293032786885246

1949634,4,B0000VCZNE,"One little known fact about Cabin Fever is that it was shot on a budget of 1.5 million... making it one of the more professional looking independent movies ever made.  Is this movie genre defining ala other independents such as: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Halloween?  Nope... Is it a fun horror flick... YES.
Despite being hampered with a low-budget, Roth manages to produce a slick, nicely shot movie, with some awesome gore.  Roth is first and foremost a horror fan, thus all the tributes he pays to other horror flicks throughout (I'll leave you to spot them, but be on the lookout there are alot of them).  With that, I don't understand the complaints made about this movie at all...
They did the exact opposite of what they should have done!
-Duh, it is a horror movie!
It wasn't scary!
-Very few movies really are, I hate shock-horror.. ya know the type of movie that goes by the formula, ""Let's have something pop out on screen to spook the audience!""  That isn't scary and Cabin Fever doesn't subscribe to that formula.  What is scary if you ask me is a flesh eating virus.... An idea which actually came from a real-life run-in Roth had with a nasty flesh eating bug while in Iceland (Something you find out during the DVD's AWESOME extras).
It's unoriginal!
-Easily the dumbest of the complaints.  I can't remember many horror movies being about a flesh-eating virus, I'm sure something has been done along those lines before, but obviously wasn't good enough for a pretty big horror fan like myself to recognize.  That is the basic plot in Cabin Fever... a Flesh Eating Virus.  Throughout the movie you are treated to Eli Roth ""Tipping his Hat"" to his fellow Horror-Countrymen.  Whether it be a kill scene from Dawn of the Dead, or a camera-shot from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Roth does it in many ways... something not new to the genre at all.  Nobody seemed to complain when Sam Raimi tipped his hat to Wes Craven by putting a torn Hills Have Eyes poster in Evil Dead (Seriously, why would there be a Hills have Eyes Poster in the basement of a cabin out in the middle of nowhere?)... Nobody seemed to complain when Scream and Halloween: H20 both had their characters ""Drive down to the McKenzies for help"" ala the original Halloween.  People within the horror genre ""Tip their hat"" so-to-speak to eachother ALL the time, Roth just does it more than others.... the fact still remains, the basic plot is original, Roth just pays tribute to those that came before him throughout it in little ways.  It's unfair Roth/Cabin Fever get slammed for being unoriginal and Wrong Turn didn't nearly take this much heat, despite being a complete knock off of The Hills have Eyes.
The humor in the movie is great, but different.  It is just a matter of taste, I found it hilarious, my friend did not... to each his own.  It is pretty dark and plays up on stereotypes.  One thing that has to be said about the movie is the amount of Gross-Out Scenes... from the Dog Splitting open, to the under the covers bed action, all the way to the shaving scene... there are a lot of moments that will make you cringe.
Overall I loved the movie... but I'm a pretty big horror fan.  A big fan of the genre?  If yes, this DVD is a must.  If you're not I would suggest renting or borrowing it first... then make up your own mind.",1074556800,,3321,4.532663316582915

1949637,5,B0000VCZNE,"as a movie man. i appreciate good and bad movies for, well, the good and bad aspects of both.
as everyone should know, horror movies are bad. so expecting that, one can pick out great qualities.
this movie combines everything a present horror movie should have. a bit dark, pretty gross at times, sexual (and with some wacky things, even for today's teen-audience movies), a whole lot of laughs (the kind that may or may not of been intended, random, and plain old humor), and a bunch of twenty-something mediocre to horrible actors and actresses.
very enjoyable.",1074038400,3,563,4.814432989690721
1949658,4,B0000VCZNE,"Many may have wonder why so many critics have given this movie positive reviews.  Is this an academy award winning movie?  Or course not.  So then why with all the good reviews?  It's simply because this is one of the first movies to go back to the 80's style horror.  For so long we have been exposed to the 90's teen horror movies that don't stay true to horror movies at all.  This movie followed all of the rules of 80's horror; it's script was not that great, the acting was ok, there were plenty of bloody death scenes, ...nudity, and humor to top it off.  These are the characteristics and important qualities in making an 80's horror movie.  No other movie this year has truely made that attempt except for House of 1000 Corpses.  Many of the reviews hear at Amazon claim that the movie isn't scary.  Of course it's not scary.  Remember this is an 80's horror movie.  Do you honestly think Jason and Freedy are scary characters.  Of course not, and in fact most of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies have Freedy saying some pretty funny dark comedy lines.  So, this movie is not supposed to be as scary but yet darkly funny.  That is the most part for the reason of the ending.  This movie is a fantastic work of art of tribute to famous 80's horror movies.  If you are a fan, you will see the tributes and remember them from your favorite movies.  If you are not a fan, you may be disappointed in thinking this was going to be another teeny bopper ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" or ""Urban Ledgend"" movie.  The critics give praise to Eli (the director) for making a low budget movie that tries to be different and bring back the genre.  I know fans are satisfied and can't wait to see more.  ...",1073865600,2,1706,4.318611987381703

After director Eli Roth was quoted as saying the tagline he wanted was ""If you can't get laid after seeing this movie, you're (explicit) pathetic.""  I must admit I was expecting a whole lot more, but when it boils down to it, the movie's too fun and outrageous to bash.  I would have definately added depth to the movie, but who doesn't want to watch a gory movie with hicks and cabins in woods?  This movie made me upset, but at the same time think...ha, what it this?!  At times it's dark and disturbing, at others it's funny and still strange.  Definately only for fans who don't plan on taking it very seriously, and who have a sense of humor.  And by the way, Scary Movie 3 is one of the least funny movies of the year, so what can we conclude about Ebert?  Salamander, you're flaw is YOU took the movie too seriously.  The movie didn't have this problem. I'm definately buying this Jan. 20th after seeing it twice in the theatres.  I do, however, recomend renting it first.",1073606400,3,1075,4.494845360824742

1949661,4,B0000VCZNE,"This movie was a lot of fun.  It could have been REALLY bad, but the director made some very good choices, such as, not creating a villian the audience could hate or even sympathize with, especially one with an attitude and one-liners.  You see people react to a situation they can't explain.  Yes, it goes off the deep end several times with plenty of stereotypes, and it's generous with the gore, but that's what makes this style of film fun.  The fact that it's not your standard slasher flick makes it interesting, and somewhat more intense.  It wasn't perfect, but it was fun to watch.

Those who compare or say it is inspired by the GREATS (TCM Evil dead etc.) are sorely mislead. Instead of an homage this movie completley misses the mark in all areas.

1949664,5,B0000VCZNE,"I personally liked this movie, I love horror movies... It is scary in its own way. The fact that it is about a real flesh eating bacteria that kills atleast 1,500 American's every year is what makes it scary. The make-up was great and looked very much like what the real thing looks like.  This movie is a change from the basic Jason or Michael movies. It may pay homage to other horror flicks but Eli Roth definetly made it his own. It is not another Evil Dead or 28 Days Later. I wouldn't say see them instead... They are all horror flicks, I would say see them all.... It is hard not to have horror movies tie into one another in some way. Eli even pulled a Stephen King by showing up himself in the movie. Cabin Fever portrays how young adults would react. They love one another but will turn on one another  to keep from getting infected. It shows real emotions.  James DeBello also pulls off a great Bert...He is a great actor and I love him!!!! He was definetly a BONUS!!! Cabin Fever is a great movie and I WOULD recommend it... Atleast see it once and make up your own mind and not have it made up by someone else's review... I will purchase this DVD on Jan. 20th.... This is one of the best horror movies of 2003, the other is TCM!!!!",1072915200,2,1244,4.218487394957983
1949665,5,B0000VCZNE,"Who is Eli Roth? His name, unlike, say, Wes Craven or John Carpenter, doesn't instantly make you think ""amazing horror,"" but soon that will change, if Roth's first nationally-distributed film, ""Cabin Fever,"" is any inclination. The film begins innocently enough, with a group of five average college kids packed in a green truck, off to a remote cabin for one last week of partying without abandon before entering the dreaded workforce. But, soon, the kid's fun turns to horror, when a diseased hermit wanders near their cabin. After a horrifying encounter, they believe the man is gone, and the threat is over, but one of their numbers has contracted the disease, and soon friendship turns to fear and paranoia, for anyone could have it now.
I am sure it was no easy task for Roth to make a chilling horror film with a low budget and no ""killer,"" such as gabby dreamstalker Freddy Krueger or silent slayer Jason Voorhees, but, somehow, he makes an unseen virus even scarier, but most spooky of all is how the carefree kids become tough-as-nails survivalists.
The acting is top-notch, especially from BOY MEETS WORLD-alumni Ryder Strong as everyman Paul. His final moments in the film, in particular, I daresay, are Oscar-worthy, if those prudes would give horror motion pictures a chance.
The writing's also quite nice, with the scenes of horror not standing alone, as the writers skillfully throw in ""small-town""-y quirks, such as police officer Winston, who is obsessed with parties and one awesome campfire tale about a bowling-hall massacre.
It's hard to define why this film works so well, but it does. I personally guarantee that if you purchase this, it will instantly become one of your favorite DVDs in your collection. You've GOTTA catch the fever.

The top ten grossing movies in 2003 were: Finding Nemo, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Matrix Reloaded, Bruce Almighty, X2, Terminator 3, Elf, Bad Boys II, The Matrix Revoluions and Anger Management. People need to get off their butts and go watch movies that actually make you feel emotion. The List is freaking lacking.

When four college students decide to take camp in a cabin near a red-neck kind of town, they all realize that something ain't right. A weird guy with a real bad case of the flu actually has a mysterious flesh-eating bacteria. Soon the students become overwhelmed with paranoia and fear.
  The story isn't half bad. I actually became a little scared and disgusted by the make-up effects. The humor and in-jokes about the rednecks are pretty funny. The finale is pretty dissapointing though. And the credits with the hillbillie music

8003540,2,B0000VCZNE,"Oh where to begin with this turkey.  The movie has just about every bad horror movie clich within the film except the obvious masked killer.  Instead you get a virus and Cujo combined.  Now the acting is god awful and the stupidity of the characters will make you chuckle.  While watching the movie I was thinking no one can be this dumb.  Then I realize that we elected Donald Trump.  The thing is this movie is so damn bad it is actually worth watching.  Like Battlefield Earth bad, but it is worth your time to soldier on to the end.

Back to the movie.  You do get cussing, nudity and violence so kudos to the director for making an R rated horror movie.  God Bless him for that, so sick and tired of watered down PG-13 horror movies tempting us with skin and cutting the camera away for possible death scenes not showing you anything.

You basically have 2 couples and the stoner tagalong going on a spring break trip to a remote cabin in the woods.  Now right off the bat the plot of Evil Dead comes to mind.  No way was this movie going to touch that masterpiece.  I was a little surprised they didn't try and cram in a third woman for Berts character which is the stupidest human being on the planet in this movie.  You get clich after clich over and over again.  Marcy rowing solo in the lake in a canoe is your Friday the 13thmoment.

Several things in this movie just seem out and out goofy.  The cop obsessed with underage drinking and riding a bicycle similar to the goofball cop in Scream.  I was thinking what was the director smoking that day?  The blonde kid biting people just seemed oddball crazy right out of something like the kid from Deliverance.

The saving grace in this film is actually the beautiful Cerina Vincent who plays Marcy.  For her nude scenes alone I would give this film an additional star.  Dont know why some actresses are afraid of nudity.  Never hurt Jamie Lee Curtis or Sharon Stones career.

Overall this is a 1 star quality film, but because of the R rating and nudity I have to at least give this 2 stars.  Several parts still don't make a lot of sense but if you are in the mood to see a bad movie as a guilty pleasure this should be your go to film.",1509667200,,2197,4.2846715328467155
