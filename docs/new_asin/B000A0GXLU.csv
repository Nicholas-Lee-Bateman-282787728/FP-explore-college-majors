Bottom line...  not enough action....too much blah blah blah.

Sure, some scenes shocked me, but it still looked like an internet movie. (If YOU've seen the movie YOU know what I'm talking about. If not, just know the screen looks like it's having some kind of slow down UNTIL the effects come along, then you know somebody made this KINDA CRAPPY MOVIE ON THEIR OWN COMPUTER.)

2348647,2,B000A0GXLU,"I have recently seen the new Steven Spielberg Movie and have seen the old fifty's War of the Worlds and enjoyed both so I thought I would surely enjoy this one as well. Well I was Wrong. In the movie there are only 2 0r 3 scenes with the alien tripods, and those scenes are very short. The tripods did include heat rays that were similar to the ones from the book and the Steven Spielberg movie put the whole thing looked like a giant crab or spider. and the aliens somewhat reminded me of the movie ""Alien"". I prefer the aliens from the other War of the Worlds movies a lot better, especially the 1953 version. I would only recommend this movie to someone that wants to see all the War of the Worlds movie to compare them (Like me)otherwise I suggest you watch another movie instead.",1121385600,6,784,4.304054054054054
2348648,1,B000A0GXLU,"When the Spielberg version of ""War of the Worlds"" hit theaters, viewers started submitting their reviews to Amazon. To read them, one would think, ""This must be the worst movie ever made"".  I myself gave it less than 5 stars, mainly because of A) Tom Cruise's incredible invincibility in that film, and B) Dakota Fanning's irritating screeching. I can still hear her screaming in my mind.
So, to all those who sent in their movie/DVD reviews slamming that movie, I suggest a cure: see THIS version.  The acting is good enough, but basically it's 93 minutes of NOTHING. Color lenses are overused to great detriment, the pastor agonizes over his shaky faith ad nauseum, and the few action scenes in it are done in ""splatter mentality"" for that truly cheesy feel. The aliens spit some kind of flesh-dissolving goo, reminiscent of the ""poison-spitter"" from Jurassic Park. Yecchh.
Once you've ""experienced"" this one, you may feel like giving the Spielberg version 5 stars or even more! (Or then again, maybe not....)
So watch this on TV, and if you can't do that, rent it. But whatever you do, don't BUY it! I did, and lost my money. Save YOURS.",1146355200,4,1140,4.752525252525253
2348649,1,B000A0GXLU,"The question about this shouldn't be about whether it stands up against the Speilberg release or not; it should be about whether it even stands up as a film.

Let's see now. The special effects are loud and they stink; there was better work done in 1933 on the original King Kong feature. The acting all belongs in Ham Central (probably because the actors didn't have anything to work with in the first place) and the story moves so slowly it would lose a race against a Jungle Sloth.

This film is a crime against some of the solid professionals who ended up involved with it. C. Thomas Howell and Jake Busey are both far better actors than what they show here and Rhett Giles gives the impression that he is as well. But there's no way they can overcome the limitations imposed by this excuse for a script. It just proves (once again) that it's impossible to make chicken a salad from a chicken's droppings. All told this thing probably has H. G. Wells rolling in his grave.

I just wish there was a way to give it a ""no-star"" grade.",1139529600,2,1035,4.380208333333333
2348650,1,B000A0GXLU,"You know, this happened so many times before. While Steven Spielberg/Tom Cruise big-budget blockbuster about the alien invasion hit the screen nationwide, small independent company release their own direct-to-video version. That's why we saw as many as three versions of `The War of the World.' One is the a little disappointing version by Spielberg, another is the terrible 3 hour (!) version released from Pendragon Pictures directed by Timothy Hines, and this one from Asylum, which is slightly better than the second, but still not good at all.

Still C. Thomas Howell is a professional actor, and even in this B film he shows it. The story is set in today's America, and there are some clever changes done to the storyline. Howell's character, astronomer George Herbert, watches a meteorite landing on the nearby land. Of course, it is not a meteorite, but a metallic cylinder from another planet, and after the devastating attack from the aliens, he heads for the Washington DC, where he believes he can meet his wife and child again. (Trivia: Herbert's son is played by Howell's real-life son.)

As far as the basic plot is concerned, it is better than Tom Cruise's. The film attempts to give the characters more substantial roles, and the soldier (Andrew Lauter) and the pastor (Rhett Giles) whom the hero encounters on his way are better than what you would usually expect in the direct-to-video pictures. Jake Busey also appears as a soldier who forms his own vigilante corps.

[NOT ENOUGH ATTACKS] Maybe they should be called laudable, but the filmmakers' efforts to produce a character-driven film only makes the fact more obvious that the film is not given enough money to create the emotional intensity from the massive attack of the aliens. The best part of H. G. Wells' story is the scene in which we witness the first attack from the Martians. The 1952 version knew it, and so does Spielberg. Even `Independence Day' unofficial adaptation of the book knew it. But this version simply misses the chance, with the too dark lighting and too scarce attack from the cylinder.

Not that every CGI is terribly used. Some of the shots using special effects are surely clunky, but some are effective, and the ruined city of Washington is fairly convincing. However, those good moments come few and far between, and in the famous chapter where the hero and the pastor are trapped in a house, the film works around the problem of budget by simply letting us only see the inside of the rooms, not the outside. C. Thomas Howell's character consequently reports to the pastor (and us) that there is an alien's machine outside, but we are not allowed to see it.

As a result, the film's characters talk and walk very much. Probably that's what we would do if aliens should really attack, but few of us believe it will happen in real life, and that is why we watch this kind of a film. The long conversation between the distraught hero and moody pastor is not what would attract the general viewers. Such scenes are only boring or annoying, and Spielberg too made the same mistake in Tim Robbins' character in his version. Spielberg's film suffers from his bombastic approach in the first part, but it has plenty of actions - not only the attacks, but the movement of the characters. In this film, the hero spends so much time talking and walking, but his talk and walk only lead to dull, meandering narrative.

One irony is that this film features C. Thomas Howell, who once worked with Tom Cruise. Yes, he was ""Ponyboy"" in `The Outsiders.' but do you still remember the days when they were so young and fresh? Ralph Macchio, C. Thomas Howell, Patrick Swayze, Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez, and Matt Dillon were in that film. It was 22 years ago, and this cheesy version of `The War of the Worlds' only reminds me of that fact.

Anyway, my opinion is, forget this one, and stick to the 1952 version.",1138492800,3,3896,4.737463126843658
2348651,1,B000A0GXLU,"One of no less than three film adaptations of H. G. Wells' War of the Worlds released in 2005, this direct-to-DVD affair may be the least original and least engaging version of the classic science fiction novel ever produced. The film is a dreadful mess, chaotically offering up traditional apocalyptic themes and scenarios without any of the action, imagination, or commentary that grant the genre its appeal. When the film isn't confusing us with aimless drama or confronting us with unexpected violence it's just plain boring. C. Thomas Howell does a fine job of portraying the story's astronomer hero in spite of a lamentable script, standing as one of the only successful elements in the haphazard ensemble. Many elements have been inserted as clear tributes to Wells' novel despite updating--the film's modern setting allowed distributor the Asylum to make an attempt at capitalizing on the success of Spielberg's far more effective blockbuster--but the resulting scenes always seem forced or illogical. Visual effects are appalling and, as a result, the alien invasion is utterly unconvincing in both scope and power. We're granted the rare beautiful depiction of grand destruction, most often in digital matte paintings, but there's absolutely no real sense that the world is being brought to its end by the giant, computer-generated machines that occasionally appear spouting ridiculous heat rays, nor does the limited budget allow us to see the human populace reacting believably to the attacks. What's more, the alien menace presented here bears none of the distinctive traits that make Wells' celebrated invaders so recognizable. Surprising stylistic shifts in the film's final scenes can't save this apocalyptic piece from becoming a catastrophe. This version of War of the Worlds is hard to follow, difficult to believe, and even more difficult to enjoy.

2348652,4,B000A0GXLU,"H.G. Wells ""War Of The Worlds"" wass a novel published in 1898.
On October 30, 1938, CBS Radio was broadcasting LIVE on ""The Mercury Theater On The Air"" program with Orson Welles dramatizing ""The War of the Worlds"".  People who had tuned in found to their horror a news broadcast reporting that something had landed at Grover's Mill, New Jersey.  It was an invasion.  Well, times were very sensitive then in 1938 and many people across America actually thought it was a real war beginning or a martian invasion.* Remember, their was no television sets invented yet.*
  Orson Welles later apologized that this was not a real news bulletin, but a Halloween prank as a way to say ""boo"".  It was just another ""Mercury Theater"" production.
  In 1975, an all-star cast television movie was made about the real events that happened October 30, 1938 due to the radio broadcast as it was being heard across America.  It really caused a mass panick and people were calling CBS Radio in New York because they were scared too death.  This movie is called, THE NIGHT THAT PANICKED AMERICA (1975-tv). Currently it is not available on VHS nor DVD.
  In 1953, Producer george Pal made the first motion picture version, ""THE WAR OF THE WORLDS"" starring Gene Barry and Ann Robinson with Academy Award winnig special effects.
  Their was a ""War Of The Worlds"" tv series in 1988-90.

In 2005, three new ""War Of The Worlds"" film were released.
A straight-to-DVD version H.G. Wells' ""War of the Worlds"" was released on June 14, 2005. Directed by Timothy Pines. Starring Anthony Piana and Jack Clay.  This version is considered to be the first authentic adaptation of the H.G. Wells' novel in 1898.
 In 2005, Steven Spielberg made his own theatrical version of ""War Of Thw Worlds"", starring Tom Cruise.  It is the worst version ever made.
Also in 2005, another straight-to-DVD version of H.G. Wells' War Of The Worlds was released on June 28, 2005. Directed by David Michael Latt. Starring C. Thomas Howell and Rhett Giles.  This version was finally broadcast on the SCI-FI channel, January 14, 2006.
  George Herbert (C. Thomas Howell) and his wife, Felicity (Tinarie Van Wyk-Loots) are going to Washington DC, but plans change when George's son, Alex (Dash Howell, his real son) finds a comet in the sky. Felicity and Alex go on while George must stay behind until tomorrow morning.  That night as he drives his car, his car stalls as the comet streaks across the sky and crashes into the woods.  He runs to the site. A man, Max (Ed Deruiter) is trapped in the crater as his girlfriend, Audrey (Meredith Lane) panickes.  Suddenly, a crab-like metal creature emerges creating terror to the entire city.  It can vaporize a human with a green light and pierce with its legs.  Those creatures are everywhere and in the surrounding cities too.  With the help of Sgt. Kerry Williams (Andy Lauer) and Father Victor (Rhett Giles), can George get back to his family and conquer the creatures?
  This David Michael Latt directed version is by far a better, more interesting in storyline film than the Steven Spielberg version which only relied upon Tom Cruise, cursing and annoying effects.

2348653,1,B000A0GXLU,"I figured I wasn't in for a great movie when I saw that my used copy came from Blockbuster, it was dated 2005, and I'd never heard of this version.  The picture on the back of the box is false advertising, because it wasn't in the movie.

With the few pathetic special effects scenes it had, they have the nerve to include an added video about how they did them.  Luckily, my DVD has a flaw in the pressing which prevented me from viewing more of the extra features.

One example of how bad this movie is:  at the end you're supposed to be seeing the main character in the devastated city of Washington, D.C.  Oh, he's sitting in a pile of rubble all right, but in the background you see countryside.  Gee, did the aliens remove all the buildings they destroyed and plant grass?",1135987200,,778,4.324137931034483

2348655,3,B000A0GXLU,"I now own all four versions of this movie. This one is third best.

THE GOOD- C.Thomas Howell. His acting, and his part is excellent! Jake Busey as the psyco army officer is also excellent. The human intrest side stories, the lady whose husband, and child are killed, the minister whose faith are shaken by the invaders. One shocking scene that I never saw coming.

THE BAD- Some parts dragged. The invaders were not included in as much of the movie as I would have liked.

THE UGLY- The tripods are not tripods at all, but look like giant spiders. No real confrontation with the military. Special effects not very good. No explanation as to what killed the invaders.

ALL IN ALL- Without the gore could have been a chic flick. That said if you can get it used for 8 Bucks as I did it is well worth the money!!!",1133827200,,811,4.3509933774834435

Jake Busey is awesome as a psycho military type. Rhett Giles gave a performance his fans have wanted since day one of his career. Didn't understand having Peter Greene show up at all,and was feeling very cheated by his whole single scene.

2348658,3,B000A0GXLU,"Not to bad for a contemporary take on the HG Wells story.  Sort of like the same adaptation done in 1953, but done for 2005.  A few slow spots, Special effects are OK.  Not mind blowing, but not as pathetic as the Tim Hines crap.  Story line is solid but a bit jerky at times and the action scenes on occasion seemed to want to throw me into an epi' fit.  IF they had a bit more of a budget, it could have gone neck and neck with Spielberg.  All and all a good watch for a lazy afternoon.  I suggest getting it used for $8 if you can.  But it does blow the doors off the HInes version.  Sort of an 'antidote' if you have seen that one.  And any move that starts with a hot naked woman getting out of the shower gets points with me!

2348660,1,B000A0GXLU,"This movie was called INVASION, then they changed its name H.G. WELLS WAR OF THE WORLDS just before the Spielberg film came out. This is not the other H.G. WELLS THE WAR OF THE WORLDS, which was a low budget adaptation trying to do the book. NOW the producers have changed the name back to INVASION again to cash in on the TV series, INVASION, about to broadcast. This movie is not WELLS. It is not WAR OF THE WORLDS. The nudity that they put in it is bland and you are better off renting PORN if you want that. Avoid this movie like the plague. If you look at this company's website, they gleefully have knocked off (copied) many bigger movies as their mainstay. If this movie were a newspaper it would make the fish wrapped in it smell bad.",1126310400,10,742,4.2695035460992905
2348661,1,B000A0GXLU,"I watched this film with a growing sense of wonderment at the sheer awfulness of it all.

Starting will the unconvincing narration, in which the actors accent went from English upper class to Dick Van Dyke Cockney to Hopkins Hannibal Lector, it was all downhill from there.

My viewing experience could only be described as one of abstract anguish hoping it could not get any worse but it did!

Nothing is more annoying than American actors attempting English accents in the belief that everyone, apart from the Irish and Scots all speak in a Cockney brouge. The Costuming was very poor. The soldiers uniforms were laughable. Scenes went on far too long, you got the impression that the director did not know when to say 'cut' - continuous close ups of actors looking either frightened, baffled, bored or a combination of all three.

It would have been marginaly better if it would have been made as a totaly animated film, the actors then wouldn't have been as wooden and the technical effects just about acceptable.

Finally it should be pointed out that Well's original story was a veiled attack on British Imperialism, imagining what it would have been like if the most technologicaly advanced and powerful nation on Earth (at that time England) was attacked by a superior enemy - like the British army fighting natives armed with spears using Maxim guns and Breech loading rifles. In the Victorian era maps of the British Empire were coloured red, in the story red weeds grows over the land. This strangley enough is made obvious in the Cruise/Speilberg version but not here.

All in all a poorly realised attempt.",1124928000,4,1619,4.8267148014440435

The special effects look like it was done in the 80's. I mean it is extremely horrible. The acting was horrible. Too much dialogue, weird unbelievable responses, and not enough action. I would say that if you don't have the budget to make a good movie, don't try to and embarass yourself in the process. I wouldn't purchase this movie ever and probably wouldn't even accept it if it was given to me for free! I'm only mad that I wasted 3.99 to rent it...",1123977600,6,609,4.304347826086956
2348663,3,B000A0GXLU,"It appears quite clear to me that David Michael Latt is not receiving the fair amount of praise he deserves for this film. His take on the Wells novel, in my honest opinion, ranks high on all levels. Infact, I would even go so far as to put it right up there with Byron Haskin's 1953 original. Those who bash it, I believe, are just way too nitpicky.

This is a B-movie, friends. Latt never went out of his way to lie and foolishly claim it is anything more. Unlike Pendragon's Timothy Hines, who conned everybody into thinking he was crafting the next best thing to ""Gone With The Wind,"" Mr. Latt was upfront from day one. He knew what his resources were, he wasn't trying to outdo Spielberg, and he maintained a firm mindset over how he felt this version of ""War of the Worlds"" should play out. And, for the most part, I truly feel in my heart that he succeeded. In as much the same manner as the Spielberg film, Latt sets his story in the present day. But, unlike that other feature, Asylum's production follows the novel's basic outline in fairly accurate detail.

No, the special effects are not letter perfect. But, they are also light years far and away removed from the pathetically cheap print-shop effects we saw in Pendragon's fiasco. I actually quite liked the spider-legged battle tank war machines. The acting, as well, contrary to petty critique, is perfectly acceptable. C. Thomas Howell, Tinaire Van Wyk-Loots, and Rhett Giles all delivered the finely leveled performances I expected. You won't find any phony accents or fakey facial hair in this one! Are you listening, Timothy Hines? Good pacing, too, I must say. Not once did I find myself glancing down at my watch. The story, familiar as it already was, really pulled me in far more than I initially thought it would.

A nice behind the scenes featurette rounds out this specific DVD package and delves into the dedication Latt harbored for the production. The sheer passion he possessed to make this film happen radiates through his every word and, for my money, he pulled off a small miracle.

In closing, I was ultimately very pleasantly satisfied. Asylum Entertainment did an overall fine job with putting this together. Even if you may have found yourself turned off in the past by Asylum's other offerings, you should still give this title a chance. It surprised me and, if you go into it with an open mind, it may just surprise you too.",1123545600,4,2415,4.648711943793911
2348664,1,B000A0GXLU,"The movie seemed ok at first... the acting wasn't ""bad"" and it was nice to see some new faces. But that's about as good as it gets. I hate it when ""Hollywood"" uses CG to make all of their creatures, but at least those guys have the budget to hire someone that can do a decent job of it. The ""aliens"" in this movie were the end product of hiring someone that doesn't know how to run a computer to make animations for a film that relies heavily on fictitional creatures.

I could probably buy any ""newer"" computer game (probably from the last 5-7 years) and get better graphics than that. It ruined the entire movie. After about 5 minutes after the aliens showed up I shut it off.

I actually went back the the video store that night and told them that I wasn't going to pay for that and I wanted to exchange it for a different movie. They didn't argue about it either. I love indie films to death... but they just shouldn't do more than they have the budget for and they shouldn't be looking elsewhere to get what they want cheaper.

Although my review is based on no more than a half hour of the movie... only get this movie if you really want your eyes and ears to bleed. I'm confident that it has no redeeming qualities... at least not so much that it can make up for the horrible mess that it is.

There is more dialog than action another indication of a cheap budget. Acting is laughable.
The aliens looked like pieces of a hose tied together and animated like a seseme street muppet

The Spielberg version wasn't perfect but WAY better than this insulting POS. I will keep the 53 and Speilberg version, may sell or throw this one out.
It is made by a company which is infamous for ripping off new releases with cheap badly made knock offs.
I originally bought it because it technically wasn't a knock off, just another version.

In my opinion two things could have helped this presentation tremendously. 1) Do away with the Jake Busey character. This stereotypical, over-the-top, megalomaniac military officer added nothing to the movie except a cringe factor. The money spent for Busey's salary could have been better utilized to accomplish the second factor. 2) Give the movie a climax showing the the war machines crashing while destroying Washington. The anticlimax provided gives the impression that one day the accountant walked onto the set and ""Wrap it up. We're out of money."" And so they did.
Even if these two things were accomplished, I'm still not sure this movie would be worth the rather steep asking price it's selling(?) for new. My advice is to buy it used. I got mine for less than four bucks including S&H.",1186531200,,1041,4.7569060773480665
8071825,2,B000A0GXLU,"To be honest, I saw the DVD cover and was expecting a bad (meaning good and cheesy) sci-fi flick.  Unfortunately, it didn't even deliver the fun cheese.  Sometimes things are so bad they are good.  This was just plain bad.  While the plotline kinda-sorta followed the book, the script was poorly written, the special effects were not very special, and the acting was fairly embarassing. This wasn't even a good, schlocky B-movie.

Don't bother with this one.",1177632000,,458,4.896103896103896
8071826,2,B000A0GXLU,"OK, first let's get the movie out of the way.  It stinks.  A handful of B-list actors are put in forced servitude of a script that goes nowhere.  When your opening credits proudly (and oh-so-inaccurately) boast ""H.G. Wells' World of the Worlds"" and your opening scene is a gratutious shot of your lead actress topless. . .well, you know this isn't going to be a classic.  Then, because anyone with an iMac can produce affordable CGI effects these days, the producers seem to have found someone with an iMac to produce affordable CGI effects.  You're not likely to see less convincing effects in this lifetime, believe me.  I'm sparing you the plot details, because I'm currently trying to forget I ever watched this movie.

Far more entertaining is the documentary (one of the MANY bonus features inexplicably afforded this turkey).  Watch in awe as the director recalls reading the original novel (a dubious claim in itself) ""when I was a kid in school, back in the 1800's.""  Sit dumbfounded as the producer talks of rushing to complete this film to beat the Speilberg version, and proudly proclaiming, ""They've got Tom Cruise, but WE'VE got Tommy Howell!""

There are even TWO audio commentaries, but I frankly couldn't sit through them.  And there are outtakes and deleted scenes (97 minutes of which seemed to have made into the final film...heh heh).

I've seen this one in the bargain bin for like 4 bucks.  And it might be worth that, just for a good laugh.
