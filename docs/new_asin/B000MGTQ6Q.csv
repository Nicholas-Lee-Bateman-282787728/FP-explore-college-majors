2736014,4,B000MGTQ6Q,"Season 5:  worth buying if you are a fan of the show?  Of course.  Hartman was a hard act to follow.  Lovitz is a very funny man but probably was not the best fit for this show.  He doesn't really have a full character other than just being ""Jon Lovitz"".  Is that the writers' fault, Lovitz' fault, or both?

Is is at funny as previous seasons?  No.  But many of the faults with Season 5 have nothing to do with Lovitz, so we can't place all the blame on him.  As with most sitcoms, there are going to be some seasons that are better than the others.  Season 5 of ""NewsRadio"" featured some new writers and producers, and they don't really do much worse than the original writers did in the early years.

As with any long-running sitcom, not every episode is a classic, and not every season is the show's best.  It just happens that Season 5 of ""NewsRadio"" happened to be the show's last.  Even at its worst it was far better than many of the shows that DIDN'T get cancelled at the end of that year, and shows usually get renewals based on profitability and ratings, not quality.  And we already know that even during its best seasons ""NewsRadio"" was never a ratings juggernaut.  So again, we probably shouldn't blame the show's demise on Lovitz or a sub-par (but still very funny) season.

Had ""Frasier"" been cancelled after its 8th or 9th season, seasons generally regarded as the weakest of the series, we might not look back so fondly on it.  Or we might remember it for having gone out with a whimper.  It had a chance to rebound and ended on a high note.  The powers-that-be killed ""NewsRadio"", not the writers and not Lovitz.

I was initially reluctant to buy Season 5 because for a long time I'd allowed myself to believe that the entire season was unfunny because Lovitz stepped in to fill the void Hartman left.  Eventually I got over that and bought the DVDs.

Glad I did.  The show is still funny in Season 5.  And bringing in Patrick Warburton or Tiffany-Amber Thiessen to see if it could add an extra spark to the show is no more egregious a crime than when countless other sitcoms did any one of a number of things late in the show's run -- ""Mad About You"" and ""Family Ties"" added a baby, ""The Brady Bunch"" introduced Oliver, ""Moonlighting"" saw Maddie and David hook up, ""Cheers"" diffused the sexual tension between Sam and Diane by allowing them to hook up, ""Happy Days"" introduced a slew of new characters and got really saccharine and boring, etc etc etc etc etc.

""NewsRadio"" tried something new and it didn't always work perfectly.  Welcome to the world of network television.  No one has a crystal ball.",1174608000,40,2623,4.465263157894737
2736015,5,B000MGTQ6Q,"After having read a few reviews on here before buying it, I noticed there was a consensus that the show was not as good after Phil died. While it is not exactly the same, I believe it still was REALLY good this season. All the laughs are still there; I've laughed just as much this season as I have with previous ones. It's really great and I'm happy I've got all 5 seasons now.

In regards to special features, this doesn't disappoint, though I would've enjoyed a featurette remembering Phil Hartman and a retrospective from cast members, but oh well, we can't have everything. What is here is good. The gag reel is about 20 minutes long and pretty funny, as ones before have been. There are 8 episode commentaries (3 on Disc 1, 1 on Disc 2, and 4 on Disc 3), and two One Man Newsradios. I haven't seen those or the commentaries, but they usually have been good. Hopefully the One Man Newsradios are good; the one on S3 was good, but S4 was not that good.

While it is not completely the big bang I'd have liked them to go out on, in regards to the DVDs, but it is still pretty good. I completely recommend getting this set as well as the previous 3.",1174608000,,1151,4.251141552511416
2736016,5,B000MGTQ6Q,"I am very pleased with this DVD set.  The episodes themselves are fantastic; these are some of the best characters ever created.  Jon Lovitz is funny no matter what he does and was the best replacement they could have gotten for Phil Hartman.  The commentary tracks are some of the best yet.  Paul Simms answers questions emailed to him by fans, and Andy Dick and Stephen Root show up for a few.  I'm very sad that the book is now closed on one of the best TV shows ever, but this is a fantastic DVD set to end it with.",1174435200,7,519,4.15
2736017,5,B000MGTQ6Q,"I adored ""News Radio"" though the Phil Hartman era was its best.  Good to see it again.",1174003200,2,86,4.0588235294117645
2736018,4,B000MGTQ6Q,"NewsRadio's fifth and final season features Jon Lovitz as Max Louis.  He was a replacement, NOT A RECAST, for Phil Hartman.  Developing his character's weirdness was the forefront of the beginning of a season that just wilted out.

The characters changed, but failed to fully evolve.  Beth's look and attitude changed, but only on the surface.  They could have grown her further and turned her into what Catherine had been, but they didn't.  Lisa inexplicably fell for Johnny Johnson while Jimmy was on the lam, and far too much of the midseason focused on his character.  The end of the season came near the series' original stride (perhaps just by comparison with the disappointing earlier episodes), but ended mid-air as the series waited to be cancelled.  No finality, no closure, no revamp.

In short, I'll be buying this DVD on release day because I love NewsRadio, and I want to complete my collexion.  It has some excellent episodes and the touching send-off for Bill McNeal.  However, if you are a casual NewsRadio fan, or haven't heard of the show or seen the DVDs, you should pick up Season 3 or 4 first.

As a hardcore NewsRadio fan, this was a disappointing package overall.  There was no commentary for ""Bill Moves On,"" and it seemed as though the producers and writers had run out of things to say.  I actually stopped listening to the commentaries, which had been extremely informative and funny for the first, second, and third seasons.

In short-the Season is 4 Stars, the extras are 1 star.  Overall:  3 stars, still worth the buy if you've enjoyed any earlier seasons.",1171670400,15,1588,4.779411764705882
2736019,3,B000MGTQ6Q,"While S5 of NEWSRADIO is still better than most sitcoms, it falls well short of the standard set by previous seasons. Obviously, the loss of Phil Hartman was a big reason for that, but the show could've survived without him and S5 gets off to a good start. The farewell to Bill/Phil found the right mix of humor and sentiment. It was hilarious while still getting you choked up. The following ep was also a treat, with Joe's Year 2000 mishaps(he claims to have a birth certificate with Jesus' real birthdate).

NEWSRADIO was always weird, but S5 crossed over into the realm of ridiculous and absurd. Jimmy's irrational fear of hippies leading to Joe hypnotizing him; Matthew turning 30 and going punk; redecorating the men's room; Jimmy's imposter security expert; the ""Freaky Friday"" parody; everyone nonsensically moving to New Hampshire; Lisa's wedding to homeless Johnny(ugh!); and the 3-part D.B. Cooper saga...this was either the ""Jump the Shark"" moment, or it was the ramp and the actual jump was Johnny Johnson returning to marry Lisa. The whole story was crazy, and lazy when you consider how it's resolved(it's like the writer's got tired and used the first insane thing that came to mind), but it also suffered from too much Johnny Johnson and the story went on too long(since when does this show need a 3-parter?).

Johnny Johnson wasn't a bad character so much as he was overdone...unlike Andrea the efficiency expert and Jimmy's nephew Walt, who were around for multiple episodes but weren't featured too much. Also, the first 2 parts exemplified the way almost everyone was written out-of-character...these aren't the same characters that made the show so great.

Jon Lovitz wasn't a good choice to replace Phil Hartman because Lovitz can't act...he just does his ""Jon Lovitz"" schtick, which is fine for 1 or 2 eps but begins to grate on you. And it doesn't help that Max Lewis is too much like Matthew, and in some cases even weirder.

Other things...Beth stops dressing like The Gap and The Salvation Army had teamed up to create a clothing line, and that's disappointing; there are TWO different ""b**ch-slapping"" jokes; a litle too much self-awareness on the part of the characters; Tiffany Amber-Thiessen isn't funny; the cinematography is different, with the episodes looking dimmer/darker(although I think this was an NBC thing); and maybe it's just me but there are times where the actors seem ineffectual or exasperated, almost like they realize just how absurd the material is.

Of course there's a lot to like, even eps like ""Towers"" and ""Freaky Friday"" that are excessively weird and contrived but have plenty of laughs and tons of energy, but this isn't the same NEWSRADIO as seasons 1-4. I'm sure I'll buy it someday to complete the collection, but it just doesn't seem worth it right now.",1171152000,23,2817,4.947145877378436
2736020,3,B000MGTQ6Q,"Im a big fan a Newsradio (got hooked back in 1998) and to me its by FAR the best show I have ever seen. Season 5, while not as good as the past seasons, had some GREAT episodes....BUT overall it REALY hurts to say I have to give 3 out of 5 stars....my thoughts below...

John levitz as a regular was alittle bit of a turn off since you already have Matthew (Andy Dick) as the show clown. You don't need two...

Last min of the first episode in Season five with jimmy and the desk was quite powerful!! Watch it!

Noise is the one where Joe makes the noise machine for Dave. GREAT episode!

Flowers for Mathew with the ""Smart drink"" was FANTASTIC.

Things went down from there when Johnny Johnson (Patrick Warburton) entered the picture. It just got way too weird and out of the ""news radio norm"". After he finally left the next 6 or 7 episodes were OK but were still too strange to really enjoy as much as the previous seasons mostly because the lack of Phil and Levitz just seems alittle annoying.

Then in 16th episode of season 5 Johnny Johnson (Patrick Warburton) comes BACK....WHY???? Why would they do this???? The next two episodes with him just sucked. Im talking about ""wino"" and ""Wedding"".

Anyway once he left things got back to normal finally the writers spit out the last few GOOD episodes in the NewsRadio legacy which were ""the padded suit"", ""freaky friday"".

After that things just went DOWN HILL and the final episodes were just depressing. Truly truly depressing...

Everyone but mat and Dave move to New Hampshire? What happens to everyone? Why depress Newsradio fans buy splitting everyone up? The last words in the final episode (from Dave) were ""I know"". SOOO depressing. WHY would the writers end such a good show with such a depressing ending?? It's a shame IMO.

If the stupid Johnny Johnson (Patrick Warburton)episodes were never made I would have given 4 out of 5 stars and if the ending wasn't so depressing I would have given it 5 out of 5 despit John Levits annoying character.

One last note, its amazing how Beth (Vicky Lewis) transforms from average good looks in season one to smoking HOT in season four/five. Amazing. Go Vicky!",1170720000,10,2161,4.572538860103627

2736022,5,B000MGTQ6Q,"Despite the tragedy of Phil Hartman's death, the 5th and final season of NewsRadio is still very good. Max Louis (Jon Lovitz) is not a great addition to the show, but he has his moments and decent chemistry with the rest of the cast. ""Flowers for Matthew,"" the episode with ""Smatthew"" (Smart Matthew) is one of my all-time favorites and worth the price of admission alone. A must have for any NewsRadio fan.",1169251200,3,407,4.589041095890411
2736023,4,B000MGTQ6Q,"In this 5th and what is the somewhat dismal final season of NewsRadio, The season premiere deals with the death of Phil Hartman who died on May 24, 1998 at his Hollywood, CA home in a murder suicide. The season premiere deals with his reflections on his life as well as what he did for the series. The replacement, Max Louis Jon Lovitz, who played as Fred and Mike Johnson in seasons 3 and 4 takes over the duties as newsman. there were some great episodes standout I might say, ""Flowers for Matthew"",

Max: Well then, Do you forgive me?

Beth: Not a chance in hell you LOSER!

Lisa: So how did that go?

Max: That's OK, Beth doesn't usually stay mad for long so...

Beth: I HATE YOU AND I HOPE YOU GET RUN OVER BY A BUS!

The other episode that was good this last year was Freaky Friday where Matthew and Mr. James switch places for a day and he gets in trouble causing Mr. James to go bankrupt. Bt otherwise, the seasons episodes were so-so at best which included Johnny Johnson, D.B. Cooper (Adam West from Batman). The episodes were really dumbed down from past seasons and that's why it probably lead to the shows premature cancellation on May 4th, 1999. But this seasons episodes still has laughs but not the way it was with Phil Hartman.

The character Max Louis came in to replace him, which was a touching choice since Jon Lovitz who plays Max was a friend of Phil's in real life. It was a little awkward at first, but then the cast hadn't even had a chance to really heal from the unexpected loss of Phil, so considering the circumstances they all did a pretty outstanding job.

I love the show and after watching the entire series on DVD, it was fun to go back and watch some different episodes with the commentary playing. There so much information included in the commentary about the show that you'd never know without listening to it. It's done so much better than the commentary I've listened to in other shows and movies. It's like watching the show all over again from the viewpoint of someone in the in the room while filming.

If you know anything at all about office politics, plus have an understanding of the reality that nobody that has became a billionaire by being friendly, honest, or generous; then those will help you appreciate the comedy behind NewsRadio. SNL and SCTV fans will enjoy NewsRadio.  On the hand, if you work in an environment exactly as emmulated by this TV series, you're not likely to become an avid fan.  It's great to watch older versions of the cartoon Tom & Jerry, unless you're being victimized on an hourly basis, 365 days a year.  The old versions of Road Runner cartoon are great unless you have a mirror of Wile E. Coyote's for a life.  If you have never seen any of the NewsRadio series, don't start with this one.

Like the other reviewers, I don't believe Lovitz is to blame - he does very well with what (little) he's given, and certainly no one can expect him to be a replacement for Phil Hartman's comedic genius. The writing, however, is terrible to the point of being painful - honestly, I could swear that with each consecutive episode, the show was trying harder and harder to be taken off the air. Jokes on the show went from cerebral to nonsensical; characters' personalities got a complete remodel, and one can only wonder why a character like 'Johnny Johnson' was even introduced, much less brought back as Lisa's jailbird husband.

Having watched the show again from beginning to end, we decided to stop at disc 3. It's probably best, since I half-expect the episodes to turn into some sort of a Married.. With Children spinoff. The two stars I'm giving it are largely due to the first few episodes, which seem to retain the original spirit of the show, and prove that Max Louis certainly does not deserve the blame for the crapulence of what was once a brilliant TV show.",1260230400,4,1226,4.593607305936073

After the first episode, the show goes on in just the same terrific manor that it did the 4 years previous. Jon Lovitz fills in for his good friend Phil Hartman as Max Lewis, a bumbling, weird, insane & ultimately lovable newsman. While Max Lewis as a character can never replace the genius character that is Bill McNeil, he's a perfect fit with the rest of the cast. And, throughout the season, the lack of Bill's trademark humor & presence is definitely felt.

There are many priceless episodes & moments, including ""Flowers for Matthew"" in which Joe gives Matthew a ""smart drink"" and the results are hilarious. ""Jail"" ""The Lam"" & ""Clash of the Titans"" where Jimmy James is arrested for supposedly being notorious long lost thief D.B. Cooper. Jimmy's arrest, incarceration & escape are only part of the fun of these episodes. ""Freaky Friday"" in which Matthew & Jimmy switch jobs for a day. And, of course, Matthew totally messes things up for Jimmy. I laughed so hard when Jimmy chases after Matthew, you could tell they had fun doing that scene. And, of course, the final episode ""New Hampshire"". Series finales are always bittersweet, and this one's a great end to the series. I really liked how all the characters were resolved and in typical Newsradio fashion, the very end is hilarious. Also, watch for a seriously creepy looking Matthew under Dave's desk near the end. There are also many guest stars like Adam West, Patrick Warburton & Tiffany Amber Thiessen.

All in all, if you were ever a fan of Newsradio, pick up this season (along with all the others), you will not be disappointed. It's my favorite sit-com of all time.",1225584000,,2075,4.742382271468144
2736084,5,B000MGTQ6Q,"The fifth and final season of ""News Radio"" opens with what was the unexpected departure of Phil Hartman, who was shot by his wife.  The series never really recovered from his absense, but it made an honorable effort under unbelievable circumstances.  SNL alum and former friend of Hartman, Jon Lovitz stepped in to play Bill MacNeil's former friend and radio personality cohort.  Many people criticize the show's final episodes for lacking the dry comedy of Hartman, but they fail to appreciate the slapstick of Andy Dick, and the amazing efforts of the entire cast.",1221696000,,566,5.0
2736085,5,B000MGTQ6Q,"Yes, of course!  Especially for those fans of the show.  Yeah, Phil Hartman made the show his own, but without him, the others were left to shine.  And they came through.  It was a shame that no one really accepted Jon Lovitz after Phils demise, but the one season he was a part of, he did add his little touches.  I thought NewsRadio was one of the funniest shows all the way through.  No ""jumping the shark"" although I felt they jumped a guppy with the space episode(season 3) and the Titanic episode(season 4).  Those were not that most entertaining, but they got through it ok.  Purchase season 5 and don't worry about Phil not being a part of this, the season was fine.",1221436800,,674,4.379032258064516

2736088,5,B000MGTQ6Q,"Season 5 saw the loss of beloved character Bill McNeal, after the unfortunate death of actor and comedian Phil Hartman. Another comedian, Jon Lovitz, was added to the show as another crazy news anchor, but he was not as lovably cynical and arrogant as Phil Hartman's character, Bill McNeal. Despite this, the episodes in this season are hilarious and most include ridiculous conclusions to previously alluded-to scenarios associated with each character (e.g., possibility that Mr. James is DB Cooper, Mr. James fear of hippies, Lisa's love life, etc.). Additionally, as with the departure of Catherine in Season 4, the departure of Bill McNeal and the departure of the show at the end of the season is very creative and well done. If you are a fan of the show, this Season is a definite purchase.",1197331200,,796,4.9037037037037035

Granted, without Hartman it loses something, but the same could be said for criminally underused Khandi Alexander's departure.  Picking up the slack are Patrick Warburton and Jon Lovitz.  Lovitz, guesting in many roles in earlier seasons (the one in the mental ward may be his finest work), did some of his funniest work on this show and he does the job solid as a series regular.  If you're a fan of Newsradio, the wacky fun continues in this final season.  Enjoy.",1180828800,2,551,4.697916666666667
2736091,3,B000MGTQ6Q,"Newsradio's fifth season is a very different beast from the four years of comedic gold that preceded it. Shattered to the core by the untimely death of Phil Hartman, it isn't until near the end of the season that the well-oiled comedy machine that was Newsradio's original cast recovers. Unfortunately by this time, the scripts themselves were showing signs of fatigue, and the show as a whole had quite frankly lost its touch. Despite intermittently great episodes, like ""Apartment"", ""Freaky Friday"" and ""Padded Suit"", the fifth season disappoints more often than not and can really only be recommended to the fans.",1179619200,4,616,5.108910891089109

2736093,5,B000MGTQ6Q,"Much has been sad about the fifth and final season of Newsradio.  At the time I think Phil Hartman's tragic death may have overshadowed the season and caused people to look down upon Jon Lovitz as he attempted to fill Hartman's large shoes.  Of course Hartman could never be replaced and the Newsradio writers did not try to.  They just let Lovitz be Lovitz and it worked.

In retrospect, season five is quite good.  It had been a while since I last saw the season when I purchased this set.  I actually now believe that it might be Newsradio's second best season behind #3, though time might change my opinion.  I've seen the others more recently and may be more weary of them.  Still, season 5 has the very funny DB Cooper storyline and several other hilarious episodes.  ""Freaky Friday"" is actually one of my favorite Newsradio eps as Stephen Root really shines in his pursuit of Matthew.

If you can get over Hartman's absence Newsradio Season 5 is excellent.  Every season of Newsradio is excellent.  Buy them all and be sure not to neglect this final season.  It's a shame that we never got to see how the staff of WNYX did in New Hampshire because the producers have said that season 6 would have taken place there.  Too bad.  I guess I should just be thankful that NBC gave this show as much time as it did because they could have cancelled it at the end of any of the previous seasons; it was never a ratings hit.",1174608000,7,1422,4.415384615384616

8169133,5,B000MGTQ6Q,"Season Five of Newsradio is a great watch. I've gone through the entire series several times, and the final season is no exception. Despite the necessarily difficult start to the season, the cast quickly reestablishes much of their old rhythm, and the quality of the writing and production lose nothing over preceding seasons. The DB Cooper arc is engaging and produces some great moments, and Patrick Warburton's recurring character fits right in. Still, much like the rest of the series, the stand-alone episodes are generally the most memorable. Indeed, ""Flowers for Matthew"" is one of my favorite episodes of the whole series. The show continues to build on the strength of its cast: from Dave Foley, the frazzled station manager working on the fringes of his sanity, to eccentric Stephen Root, space cadet Andy Dick, OCD workaholic Maura Tierney, and the list goes on. The cast frequently talks of how much they enjoyed working together in interviews and such, and that shows quite clearly right to the final episode.

Much can and has been written about Hartman's passing, Lovitz's role, whether that could have been handled better, or whether there should have been a season five at all. I believe Hartman would have been sad to see the series die with him. As for Lovitz, I'll grant his start as a regular is a faltering one, but by the end of the season he does feel like a member of the dysfunctional WNYX family. Season four is by far my favorite, and I won't pretend five comes close to matching that zany energy, but neither does it fall on its face. NBC definitely made a mistake canceling the show: at the time, only Frasier had anything resembling the kind of smart, up-tempo humor Newsradio was so good at (even without Hartman). Finally, here's a suggestion for those of us who would rather have seen the show go out with a bang: start with season five and then go as normal.",1522195200,,1893,4.736363636363636

8169137,3,B000MGTQ6Q,"""NewsRadio"" was a great show but by Season 5, it clearly had run out of steam. There was very little content that had anything to do with running an all-news radio station. It was mainly the various characters doing schtick and most of that wasn't very good. Great workplace comedy uses the workplace and whatever business is being conducted there as a source of its material (think Mary Tyler Moore, Bob Newhart, Home Improvement, Frasier, Cheers, Barney Miller, Taxi, 30 Rock). The cast of this show could have been doing their routines in any setting; the radio station itself became merely stage dressing, a backdrop. The work of broadcasting the news was going on in the background, but our players didn't seem to have anything to do with it (not even Jon Lovitz the on-air talent who seldom was seen working in the booth). It's as though the writers had run out of ideas for NewsRadio and decided to do sketch comedy instead. The loss of Phil Hartman loomed large; one wonders how the season might have developed if he had been there.

In addition to the numerous sketches that were sometimes successful, mostly not, the several running gags were really lame. The whole DB Cooper/Johnny Johnson/Lisa storyline was just plain dumb and, more to the point, not funny. Jimmy James lost his fortune not once, but twice. Hilarity did not ensue. One exception was the episode that spoofed ""Flowers for Algernon"" in which Matthew was smart for a day. It was very well done by all concerned, especially Andy Dick, and very funny.

That the series was not renewed for a sixth season should come as no surprise. It's a shame the show had to go out on a down note, but, on the other hand, the sense of loss was less acute.",1503532800,,1716,4.641447368421052
