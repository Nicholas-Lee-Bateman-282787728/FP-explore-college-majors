Brian McNaught takes a very non-confrontational approach to his material, presenting gay men and lesbians as people who simply desire to be treated by the Golden Rule. He points out some of the common workplace problems, ranging from unintentional slurs to outright homophobic attitudes, that gay folk face on a daily basis, and suggests methods to eradicate the problem.",1017446400,2,474,5.076923076923077
