Kabir Bedi that plays the Black Corsair is a very very gorgeous Indian-British actor. It is a beautiful movie. thanks Y.Castilla",1419724800,,295,4.462962962962963

8103684,4,B000E0VWIA,"I saw this movie in the early 80's but is was dub in spanish.  The movie is great great plot, good actors and great setting. Some events of the plot are based on actual history.  In my oppinion if your looking for a good pirate action film this is the one much better than the pirats of the caribean trilogy.  Its just pure plot and action no fx bs eather.
The only problem is that is availavle in Italian and french, but you can still follow it some how.",1354060800,,455,4.089887640449438
