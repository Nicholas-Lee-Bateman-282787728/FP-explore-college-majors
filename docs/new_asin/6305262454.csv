1000844,5,6305262454,"I probably said it before and I'll say it again - I never met a Shaw Brothers movie featuring the Venoms and directed by Chang Cheh, that did not ROCK THE HOUSE!
(P.S. I know it by the title ""Crippled  Avengers.""",958089600,,212,4.170731707317073
1000845,4,6305262454,"A five star kung-fu movie, it even has a plot.  Video quality is acceptable.  Audio sounds like a mono record.  DVD version is superior to the video version and a must buy for true fans of this genre.",939513600,23,200,4.2105263157894735
1000846,5,6305262454,This movie is simply awesome.  The figting scenes are great and you also get good laughs.  I recommend this movie to anyone.  One of the best I've seen as of late.,936489600,,163,4.193548387096774
1000847,5,6305262454,"First of all, this is not a part 2 to the first Venoms movie.  The original name of this movie is Mortal Combat, but when it came to America they called it Crippled Avengers.  All of the Venoms are in this movie  except Wei Pai, the Snake.  The storyline is good and the fighting  choreography is excellent.  Chen Kuan Tai, the ""Iron Monkey"", is  also in this film.  This is the second best movie the Venoms gang has done,  but also check out ""The 10 Tigers of Kwantung"", ""2 Champions  of Shaolin"", and ""Unbeatable Drangon"" and you'll be even  more amazed at their skills.  Peace!!!!",934934400,10,583,4.447619047619048
1000848,5,6305262454,return of the five deadly venoums is probably one of the best martal arts movie i'v ever seen. It's very origanal in it's traning and fighting seens and it's a shaw brother's work of art.,934588800,,187,4.371428571428571
1000849,4,6305262454,"This entire movie revolves around a pretty cool concept; how would a blind man, a deaf man, a man with no legs, and an idiot take revenge on the man who crippled them. They would team up and negate their handicaps of course.  Not only would that make an interesting movie, but throw in  those good old  boys from Taiwan, the Venom Mob, and you've got a dazzler. Not at all a  sequel to the classier Five Deadly Venoms, but it does stand well on it's  own. Also of note, look for some of the most original training sequences in  a Kung Fu film.",933984000,7,543,4.173076923076923
1000850,5,6305262454,"This movie has it all, including the most-thought out choreographed fight scenes ever! The action is almost non-stop after the characters are introduced.
The story begins with three men breaking into the home of one  of their enemies in search of revenge. Instead they find his wife and son.  They decide  to take their revenge by cutting off the wife's  legs and the  sons hands.  But when the man they're after gets home and catches them in  the act, they are dead meat.  The father then realizes that his wife is  dead and his son's a cripple.  But he promises his son that he'll have iron  (or was it steel?) hands built for him, and that he'll teach him the  variations of the TIGER style of kung-fu.
But that's just the first 5  minutes and they aren't even the main characters to this story. In a twist  that would make Brian Singer proud, the focus switches to a group of  cripples who in search of their own revenge (nuff' said, buy it!)",926812800,,946,4.4186046511627906

It's got laughs, action, violence, and everything else you could want on a Saturday night when you sit down with your bowl of popcorn.

Like the other VENOM'S classic movies, this one is among the best. As far as plots and specifics, others accurately described it, therefore, I won't go over that. The Audio and pictures are great.

1001456,4,6305262454,"I have been a fan of the martial arts (Judo, Jujitsu, Karate, Combatives, Krav Maga etc), and martial art films for most of my life.  This one (The Return of the 5 Deadly Venoms), which is also called The Crippled Avengers,  had plenty of martial arts action in it.  However,  even though this movie was fun to watch,  I found many of the fights way too long and sometimes boring.

The story is about a martial arts master who becomes evil when his wife is murdered and his son's arms are cut off by another martial arts group.  After the father kills the three bad guys with his three Tiger Kung-Fu, he becomes even more evil himself over the years.  He makes his son, who he trained in Kung-Fu, and now has iron arms to replace the arms he got cut off, a mean and cruel bully.  He winds up crippling  and injuring a group of four people in various ways (blinds one, destroys one's ability to speak or hear, makes one an idiot, and cuts off the legs of one).  These four seek out another Kung-Fu master who trains them for three years and shows them how to overcome their handicaps.  The four return to seek revenge on the group who injured them.

In conclusion, if you are a martial arts film fan, you will see tons of fights, both unarmed and with a host of martial arts weapons being used in this film.  The fight scenes are very unique but like many Asian made martial arts films, many of the fights look more like dancing than fighting.  Still a fun movie to watch.

1001458,5,6305262454,"Return of the Deadly Venoms aka Crippled Avengers is one of director's Chang Chehs best film and venom favorite. Released in 1978 after the success of the Five Deadly Venoms movie,Chang Cheh hires Kung Fu legend Chen Kuan Tai to play the villain. No Wei Pai in this one though,but all of the venoms are in top form. Lau Kar  Leung,Tong Gaii are out of choreography and Chang Cheh hires Robert Tai Chi,a Taiwanese martial artist/actor to do action directing duty,along with help from Kuo Chi,Chiang Sheng,and Lu Feng. What do we get after that?one of the best martial arts cult films of the Shaw Brothers and of all time. The cast includes Johny Wang Lung Wei(Return to 36th Chamber),Dick Wei(Project A),Jaime Luk,Yeung Hung,Chui Tai Ping.

Dao Tian Du returns home too late after his family has been attacked by the Tian Nan tigers. His wife's legs have been amputated,His son's forearms have been cut off. Tian Du is able to kill the murderer and his gang. His wife has passed away and only his son survives. Tian Du makes an oath to him that he can still make him a kung fu fighter and gives him Iron Arms. His son is able to get his revenge. Years have passed and Tian Du has gone mad and has made the revenge an even personal matter. He kidnaps the Tian Nan's family members and makes them fight his son to the death. At the end they either die or become crippled. Both father and son have become even worse and anyone who crosses their path will have a lesson taught to them.

All three core venoms Lu Feng,Kuo Chi,Chiang Sheng have peking opera training and are the most acrobatic out of all the fighters in the movie. The have all different types of martial arts weapons,from swords to Iron Chain balls.",1355356800,6,1710,4.509677419354839
1001459,4,6305262454,"It's hard not to love this one. Lu Feng's iron hand from LIFE GAMBLE returns with its twin, and Kuo Choi, Lo Mang, Sun Chien and Chiang Sheng round out the Mob. Not only do you get Lu Feng as a villain, but Chen Kuan Tai and Wang Lung Wei are on board as well, giving this film an exceptionally high Villain Quotient.

The Venoms play a group of men maimed in various ways by Chen and his lackeys for the offense of not being sufficiently terrified of them. Banding together out of necessity, they make their way to the home of of an aged master, who takes pity on them and teaches them kung fu (of course) to overcome their handicaps. Building upon this simple righteous revenge plot, director Chang Cheh and screenwriter Ni Kuang give us some great characters, real ""heart,"" and plenty of applause-worthy moments. Lo Mang's facial expressions (as a deaf-mute blacksmith) are another high point in a movie full of high points - if the Shaw studio had really pursued the kung-fu-comedy trend, Lo Mang could have been one of their crown jewels. Lu Feng's choreography is great throughout and shows off his (as well as Kuo Choi's and Chiang Sheng's) Peking Opera chops.

On the downside...the subtitles kinda blow. A minor quibble, but when one scene loses its dramatic punch due to some flubbed subs, it's enough to make a fan grit his teeth. This is one where you're better off watching the (not at all bad) English dub, which makes it a good choice for a ""gateway drug"" if you're trying to hook some new kung fu converts. Another screw up is the title card - RETURN OF THE FIVE DEADLY VENOMS. Not at all a sequel to that classic, that title originally came about in early bootlegs, trading on the success of the previous film. It's a shame Dragon Dynasty felt the need to go the same route rather than preserve a classic for the fans - I can't imagine that decision really sold more copies of the DVD. Finally, there's one (ONLY ONE!) bad wire-fu moment at the film's end that always makes me wince - but it's a case of something being so close to perfect that any defect, no matter how minor, sticks out.

It may not be the ultimate fun kung fu flick, but it's close. Even non-fu-fans will cheer at the great ""iron feet"" scene. The film's theme, that any kind of disability can be overcome with perseverance, lifts it that much higher above the genre norm.

""The Crippled Avengers"", not a sequel by any means to ""Five Deadly Venoms"" as many have noted, is one of the best of the 70's Shaw Bros. kung-fu features. It suffers from tedium from time to time (ie a few scenes seem to go on for just a bit too long), but otherwise has memorably cruel villains, even more memorable heroes, fantastic, kinetic fight scenes, a loving dose of comedy (mostly from the zany half-braindead warrior), and a number of all-out wackiness (nevermind how someone without hands can still move the hands on gloves around). Not perfect, but a heck of a lot of fun if you can get past the ocassional tediousness.

1001519,5,6305262454,"In the original 1978 Kung Fu classic ""The Five Deadly Venoms"" a dying teacher instructs his final pupil to seek out five of his former students and destroy them. The five former students are all highly skilled killers with their own unique style of kung Fu such as Centipede, Snake, Scorpion, Lizard, and the Toad.

""Return of The Five Deadly Venoms"" aka ""Crippled Avengers"" is considered by many Kung Fu fans to be the sequel to the original Five Deadly Venoms when in fact it has nothing to do with the original at all. If you know anything about the original you know that all of the characters were killed except for the Lizard and the final student, so how can this be The Return of the Five Deadly Venoms?

I think that the title is misleading. I also think with the success of the first film the actors went on to embody what was known as the five deadly venoms in name only. My biggest concern with this movie is that there are only four venom characters together because one of the original venoms is now playing the son of the evil Kung Fu expert and he is the enemy of the other four venoms. Another problem is that none of the four venoms in this movie have been trained in any sort of venomous style like the original.

If they were really the deadly venoms as the title suggests, they wouldn't have any need for more training because they're already lethal killers. None of the Kung Fu has anything to do with any sort of venom style in this movie because all the new training is related to their individual disabilities. Aside from sharing many of the same actors, the two movies are completely unrelated and should be viewed as such. I really prefer this film to be called the ""Crippled Avengers""

After the family of a wealthy Kung Fu expert is brutally attacked the Kung Fu expert decides to take control of the town he lives in and punish anyone who gets in his way. He is aided by his crippled son who has been given a lethal pair of metal arms and he uses them to cripple those who oppose him. Now, four men who have been crippled will join forces and strengthen their disabilities to defeat the man with the metal arms for good.

Fully restored, re-mastered and beautifully presented in SHAWSCOPE from Celestial Pictures ""Return of the Five Deadly Venoms"" has finally been released under the Dragon Dynasty label. The digitally re-mastered picture and sound are truly outstanding and any fan of this movie will want their own copy. The widescreen picture is crystal clear and the colors are vibrant and sharp. The soundtrack is clean and crisp and it sounds great on my home theatre system. The disc packaging and disc artwork is well done. In the end ""Return of the Five Deadly Venoms"" aka ""Crippled Avengers"" is an eye-popping Kung Fu classic!

It came out right after Unbeatable shaolin and I was already hooked on seeing these guys.  I'm originally from NYC and we loved these guys and was always wondering who was going to die in the end and which one would live.  Now this movie was the second time in a row that we saw the Toad live all the way through the movie and me and my boys were laughing our ass off about that.  The story wasn't classic at all and the main boss in the movie had never been the bad guy at all and the only guy of the venoms who wasn't in this movie is #2 The Snake.  He is only in 3 of there films the original 5 deadly venoms and 10 tigers of Kwangtung, and The kid with the golden arm , and not the frank sinatra drug film hahaha. This movie is the only venom film that in the end I was crying a bit when the 6th student died from the darts of the centipede.  This was the first movie that I ever saw were the martial artist were afflicted with some sort of handicap and didn't let it hold them back from getting there revenge.  Now on to who died in this one the Judge bought it haha.  chen kuan tai the main villian.  and The Centipede haha.  oh and my man from 10 tigers the muscle man che chu san .

Aside from the kung-fu fighting if you watch closely there is a moral lesson to learn, and I just personally love shaw brothers ,movie's that are famous for doing that.

In a world that we live in full of needless violence on the movie screen ,with nothing in the movie for you to actually think about.

1001523,3,6305262454,"""Return of the Five Deadly Venoms"" a.k.a. ""The Crippled Avengers"" is a weird combination of exploitation piece and kung fu movie, and looks like ""The Three Stooges meet David Carradine"". The plot centers around power, vengeance, and horrible mutilations. The crippled masters are legless, blind, deaf, and brain damaged. How they got that way is central to the story, so I won't reveal it here; fortunately the producers don't resort to thalidomide victims in this production. Some of the artificial limbs are amazing (I especially like the iron hands that shoots darts), and the ""tiger style"" martial arts here are quite spectacular, especially the lengthy closing scene which contains some truly amazing acrobatics.

The film is long on hand to hand combat, but short on plot, dialogue, and pacing (not that typical audiences expect much in the advanced thespian or screenwriting skills departments from these films). It is a quite long movie for the genre, and despite the amazing fight scenes is actually boring in places: if the film had twenty minutes edited out of it it would be much stronger. While the fight scenes were extraordinary, they account for all of the three stars the film deserves; the plodding pace of the backstory hurt the final rating.

One problem is the audio is extremely low and you'll have to blast your speakers to hear the talking.  Other than that a pretty solid movie.

The choreography is tip-top and the movie should be seen if you're a fan of this genre.  It's not awful but it has more than its share of flaws.  Some copies of this are titled, ""Return of the 5 Deadly Venoms"", though this is not a sequel in any way.

Lu Feng has his arms cut off as a child by enemies of his father.  The old man also loses his wife and develops quite a chip on his shoulder.  He could have really learned a lot from the philosophy of Martin Luther King, Jr., as he replaces his son's arms with iron ones and togehter they enjoy inflicting deformities upon others.  What a couple of jerks.  They take the eyes of Philip Kwok, the ears of Lo Meng, the legs of Sun Chien, and the brain of Chiang Sheng.  These four are a little upset themselves and train, despite their handicaps, for revenge.

The action is really a sight to behold.  Especially Philip Kwok, though Chiang Sheng and Lu Feng are no slouches.  The problem is (and I'm having a hard time with this) that there is too much in the way of acrobatics during the final fight.  I normally LOVE a lot of flips 'n' stuff in my old-school kung fu, but they go WAY overboard.  Flips for the sake of flips, over and over again.  The movie as a whole is also too long and could have been shortened by a half hour or so.  I don't know.  I may feel different after another viewing.  It doesn't suck, that's for sure.  Plus Lo Meng actually lives through this.

The presentation is marvelous.  Like a fuji apple; crisp, sweet, and shiny.  It is recommended for fans of the Venoms and maybe it only suffers by their standards.  Does objectivity have any place in the review of a kung fu movie?  I'd say it does but what do I know?  Journalists usually have no integrity to begin with.

These guys really rock. They must have know the success of 5 was awesome because they took even better care and more time to get this Kung Fu stuff right. This is a must see. Even better then 5 Deadly venoms. I think everyone knows its not the original title. The venoms died in the last one. This one has some pretty amazing scenes in it. Just get this version. Its pretty good and clear. I don't know about the Hong Kong Celestial pictures and the rights. What I do know is that some company's sell this DVD here in the USA and its good that they do so we can enjoy it. I have seen bootleg dvds before and this sure don't look it to me.

1001636,5,6305262454,"This non-Celestial pictures DVD is the best!!  I LOVE SUPPORTING LOW DOWN PIRATES looking to make a quick buck, or even a slow one for that matter.  Quite frankly the savings are passed on to the customer and everyone wins.  I would make this movie on my DVD burner at home and sell it for $3 on amazon if I could and I would even throw in bonus footage of myself in ninja gear rocking out to Holy Diver at the end of the movie for free.

The movie itself is a classic tale of a gang of crips getting together to beat up a kung-fu warlord with the stumps where there arms and legs used to be.  The fact that iron appendeges are now attached to the stumps doesn't hurt either.  The scene where Iron Legs tricks the invincible cape wearing guy to let him kick him in the stomach is unforgettable. The look on the caped man's face is priceless when he realizes he's fallen for the old ""guy with iron legs, which are covered by normal shoes and pants, asks you for a kick in the stomach head start to the fight"" routine.

Don't listen to any quality otakus who are complaining about the dvd quality.  I found out some of them actually work for celestial and are just trying to get sales.  In a private e-mail, one of them (I told him I wouldn't name names) admitted that celestial is actually run by funballs from Laos who have no respect for kung-fu's heritage.  So you might as well get the bootleg and support the true asian artists out there trying to keep the kung-fu heritage alive.

If you are a fan of the 5 Deadly Venoms then you will love this movie. The story will hook you from the very begining while the fight scenes are great.  I especialy like this film because of the training scenes.  I am very big on training sequences in Martial Arts film, and this movie has some good ones.  The story builds as it goes, which is good, and there isn't any action just for the sake of action shots, which I hate.
As a martial arts movie buff I had to have this movie in my collection.  Even if you are not a serious collector you need to have this movie.  Its one of those films that you can show to people who hate martial arts films and dubbed movies just to hear them say ""damb, that was a good flick!"".",1054252800,4,833,4.142857142857143

1001705,5,6305262454,"aye boys and girls, first things first, this movie is not related to 5 deadly venoms.  There are two relations between this Return of the 5 Deadly venoms and the original 5 Deadly Venoms, 1) they both have the phrase 5 Deadly Venoms in the title 2) the actors from the original are in this one!  Please note that this is not a sequel to the 5 deadly venoms, it has nothing to do with the story of the first one, in fact the title for this movie refers to the actors, they're back (in another, completely different movie, playing different characters, etc etc).
now that ive cleared that up, i would like to go on record and saying that this movie [was great].  i like the first one(read my review for that one), i like this one even more (though my brother begs to differ!)
what happens?  a good guy turns bad, his kid is crippled, so he gets [mad].  later in life, they cripple others (one is made deaf and mute, one is made retarded, one is made blind, the other has his legs cut off.  The crippled folks are helpless, and want revenge, but stand no chance...because they didn't have any MA skills to begin with. Now have less of their god given abilities, thanks to the good guy gone bad and his now grown up son.
basically, thats what ill tell you about the story, as for the MA action, man its unbelievable.  Ive seen a lot of acrobatics and MA in my time,...these guys are extremely skilled.  they have gravity defying jumping ability, seriously, they're quite a wonder to watch.  their acrobatic skills are mesmerizing and then they display an equal jaw dropping level of MA.
The training sequences are exciting, the hula hoop scenes are mind boggling.  this movie is great...great story, great cast, great acting, great time...
I bought the DVD version and highly recommend it, yeah, my mum liked this one too, even more so than the first one!
