8005714,3,B00012QM2C,"This two DVD set covers more than just massage, in case you happen to believe in aromatherapy, acupressure and reflexology.

On the plus side, all the massage techniques are performed long enough for those new to massage to grasp them.  Head, feet, and facial are covered, along with body.  Camera work is adequate if not inspired, and the video quality is good.  While one gets the ""what could be expected in an institutional setting"" feeling when watching, this is a video for the whole family, something  one can't say for some other massage videos.

On the minus side, some things are repeated.  One sees essentially the same complete back massage three times, in different places on the DVDs.  There is a menu mixup between arm massage and chest and neck massage.  Whoever laid out the DVDs was not a friend of logic.

As for the massage itself, it somehow doesn't look that enjoyable.  The draping, for the most part, would be acceptable to a nun, and it causes definite breaks in the massage.  The techniques look very rule-bound, which I suppose goes along with the instructional nature, but I watched a masseuse miss the same part of the back over and over, just to follow a pattern.

All in all, you could learn to massage someone from this DVD set.  Just don't pay too much.",1093910400,11,1285,4.653333333333333
