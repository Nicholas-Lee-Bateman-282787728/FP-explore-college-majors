This is not about the fighting spirit of old Japan. It's about the modern versions of older systems which are by now widely known outside Japan. What strikes me most is the casualness of Shimuzu sensei and that's something I noticed with other people of his renown. Compared to what is now taught he's worse than casual, not to use other words. So, viewed from our present angle, he's bad. Or is it the other way round? Are we to obsessed with beautiful form and is the content lost? A way to transfer energy without doing it?",1140480000,,589,4.5046728971962615
