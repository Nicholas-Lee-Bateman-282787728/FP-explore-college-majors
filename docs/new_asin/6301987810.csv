405763,5,6301987810,"Playing a trick with the ""fourth wall"" of a movie - what happened before the opening credits rolled and the film started -Gregory Peck's character finds he knows no more about his past than you do. That's creepy enough. But when he begins to realise he is in deadly danger and doesn't even know why, let alone from whom, then this movie really starts the goosebumps.
The one other big mystery is why this film is not more widely available. An absolute must-have classic thriller with more twists than a rusty corkscrew.",1047513600,6,519,4.6521739130434785
405764,4,6301987810,"This suspenseful, black and white film, redolent of Hitchcock, centers around David Stillwell (Gregory Peck), a man who seems to be suffering from amnesia and remembers very little about himself. He consults with a psychiatrist but finds little help there, as the psychiatrist accuses David of being in trouble with the law and trying to set up some sort of fake psychiatric defense, something which the psychiatrist wants no part of.
David then hires  Private Detective Ted Casselle, engagingly played by Walter Matthau, to discover just who he really is. When David learns that he is being followed by two hard bitten thugs, with the unlikely names of Lester and Willard, menacingly played by Jack Weston and  George Kennedy, events in the film start to really heat up.
As David begins to get flashbacks of a disturbing  past that is trying to reinstate itself in his present, David finds himself getting more and more enmeshed into a life and death struggle of some sort.  A woman named Sheila, played by the fresh faced Diane Baker, interjects herself into his life with warnings of danger that even the least paranoid person would be wise to heed. It is almost as if a cat and mouse game were being played.
As David begins to remember more about his past and the places, people, and events that were to bring him to his present state, David discovers that danger and deception is closer to home than he thought. This is an intriguing and taut film of psychological suspense that those who enjoy the films of Alfred Hitchcock will like.",1046908800,27,1540,4.7781954887218046
405765,3,6301987810,"It made me think of Charade in many ways. I didn't like Charade. Mirage was a bit better, because I understood for the most part what was going on.
I've wanted to see this film for some time. I enjoyed Diane Baker in Marnie and The Horse in the Grey Flannel Suit, and I love Gregory Peck. The story sounded quite good, etc. So when I saw it at our favourite rental haunt I wanted to bring it home.
While I won't say that I was wildly let down by this film, I cannot really say it was great. I didn't think it was particularly Hitchcock-y, as the box said.
For the first while, it was O.K. being in the dark about what was going on, but when it goes on for an hour and twenty minutes and still no hint as to what is happening, that's gone too far. Diane B. wasn't really a big part and all the good people get killed. The character of Calvin was a bit fuzzy. Was he at heart really good or really bad? Perhaps I just missed something.
I felt that overall the filming was very good and tight - I liked the way the film would cut from the present to things Gregory's character was remembering. It was strange to see tacky 60's hairdos and clothes in black and white. There wasn't anything too gory, but there was some language that I didn't appreciate.
Not sure really what else to say about this film... If you are a Peck Fan such as I, you should see it for the experience, but don't pay eighty bucks for it...",1044316800,3,1409,4.108695652173913
405766,5,6301987810,"This Hitchcock like suspense masterpiece featuring great performances, stunning black & white cinematography, and a Quincy Jones score needs to be on DVD now!

405767,5,6301987810,"Gregory Peck stars as David Stillwell, a man with a secret.  The problem is: He doesn't know he has a secret, because he is suffering from amnesia.  Thus begins this psychological thriller in the Hitchcock tradition, set in New York City in the mid 1960s.
Peck, feeling that he's lost his grip on reality, and needing to actualize his existence, starts down the path of reconstructing his life.  Because he has amnesia, he can't remember having any friends.  He visits a psychiatrist (played with passion and intelligence by Robert Harris) and hires an easy-going private eye (Walter Matthau) to investigate who he really is, and find out his identity.  Early on, he runs into old flame, Sheila, played by the beautiful and underrated Diane Baker (fresh off of Hitchcock's dark ""Marnie"").  She turns out to be even more of a cipher than Peck, refusing clues to his queries about his identity.  ""I want to remember who I am!"" Peck rages at Baker.  Her tortured reply singularly sums up his bizarre and paradoxical world: ""Not remembering is the only thing keeping you alive!""
So, as you can see, this is a neat twist on the amnesia flick, and I'm going to stop here, because I don't want to give any more of the plot of ""Mirage"" away.  The intelligent script by Peter Stone (Charade) moves alternately fast-and-furious/ slow-and-langorous. ""Mirage"" is chock full of great performances:  George Kennedy and Jack Weston give two of the best portrayals of sociopathic, ruthless hired killers ever; Leif Erickson stars as ""The Major,"" an equally ruthless industrialist bent on prying the secret loose from Peck's clouded mind; Kevin McCarthy is glib and smarmy as the sycophantic Josephson and Walter Abel is suave and conflicted as Peck's mentor, Charles Calvin.
Director Edward Dmytryk -- best known for his masterwork ""The Caine Mutiny,"" and blacklisted during the McCarthy years -- directed ""Mirage"" really tight: There are no dissolves; every cut is literally a cut, and the breakneck pace of the chase scenes further establishes Peck as a man alone, being kept on a long leash.  Dmytryk broke with tradition by editing even the flashback scenes with straight cuts, and it works beautifully.
Notching the tension up even further is Quincy Jones' jazzy and urbane soundtrack, which draws on the ""crime jazz"" genre created by Elmer Bernstein and Henry Mancini and looks forward to Jones' own soundtrack for ""In the Heat of the Night.""
That ""Mirage"" isn't even currently in any release is perplexing.  This is a totally solid and taut thriller,...it's worth every penny, especially if you're a Gregory Peck fan -- one of his best and most convincing performances.",1029196800,38,2660,4.993212669683258

405769,4,6301987810,"The 1965 film Mirage is a very good suspense mystery.  It was filmed in location in New York City.  In an era when movies were more commonly being filmed in color, this film was in black and white.  It evokes the gritty cynical film noir of the fifties (bringing that refinement that is Gregory Peck).  Peck plays an amnesiac who finds himself in New York City.  He is trying to find out who he is while at the same time he is becoming increasingly aware that his life is in danger.  Among the many aspects that make this film interesting and entertaining is the cast, which includes Diane Baker, Walter Matthau, Lief Erickson, and George Kennedy.  Filming on location in New York City gives it a realism which adds to the suspense.  This film should be more accesible for rent and sale.  It may have been more in tune with the suspense thrillers of the fifties but looking back from our time it is a timeless example of the ""innocent man"" being pursued because he knows more than he realizes.

405858,5,6301987810,"This was one of the finest films by maverick, and at times black-balled, director Edward Dmytryk.  Star Gregory Peck had earlier appeared in Hitchcock's ""Spellbound"" and ""The Paradine Case"", but this film was 20 years on, in 1966, yet still filmed in black and white.  Here for some reason the lack of colour works beautifully: usually I find myself critical of this when unnecessary... And there are precious few films that can stand up to the master's best, or even exceed it, and ""Mirage"" is certainly one.  A wonderful film that keeps you guessing until the conclusion, with all players being excellent.  Interestingly, it features George Kennedy in a supporting role, with music by Quincy Jones.

The Movie: A nice little mystery with a bunch of strange, dream-like symbolism permeating throughout. Matt Weiner mentioned this as a huge influence on Mad Men, prompting my wife and I to check it out, and while there are some fun nods, in particular to Mad Men's opening credits, the whole of this film is much stranger than anything Don Draper gets up to. Gregory Peck is, as always, charming, and Diane Baker plays a suitable foil as he tries to unravel the reasons behind his strange amnesia. In particular, the editing and several narrative devices used in the film play more modern than modern - it's kind of experimental in its way, and I really recommend it.",1436572800,4,820,4.694444444444445

The quality of the print is related to the quality of the film as it was first produced, so, no, it isn't crisp and clear.  I am glad this was filmed in B&W instead of color.  The story comes forth more in this format.

WARNING:  A few spoilers appear below.

I really like this movie.  it is one of my favorites. One must pay attention to the details or it won't make a lot of sense.  It is a ""watch it more than once"" film to really appreciate all the fine acting.  All the actors in this film do a great job -- the character actors are all pros.  One sees them in a lot of films from the 50s and 60s.  Kevin McCarthy, Walter Matthau, George Kennedy, Leif Erickson, Walter Abel, Jack Weston, etc.  They are all believable in their roles.  What more do you want?  Harry Rhodes' doing a police report for Peck is superb.  You believe he really is a police officer.  (How many producers and directors in 1965 cast a black actor as a police officer?)  Diane Baker and Peck do a great job, as usual.

Yes, the plot is confusing and there are continuity slip ups, like when Peck talks to Abel's widow and says he has never heard of Unidine when in a flash back he said ""I don't work for Unidine anymore . . .""  (This is after he recovers his memory.)

The score by Quincy Jones is wonderful.  It is romantic and promising when it needs to be so one can identify with poor Peck who has lost his memory but still maintain hope that he and Baker will somehow get together.

Director Dmytryk did not dumb down the plot for the audience.  Too bad so many new movies hit one over the head with plot points instead of respecting the intelligence of the audience to figure it out.

Peck's character's anti-nuclear weapon position doesn't come forth until the end of the film -- but his willingness to be killed instead of revealing the secret of a ""no fallout radiation"" nuclear weapon is a powerful statement which provokes thought about the use of nuclear devices in general.

Some films are just ""watch and be entertained.""  And that's a good thing.  This isn't one of them.

Instead it has an intriguing plot -- containing many things which turn out not to be not what they initially seem to be -- as well as good acting, especially by Gregory Peck. it's a bit difficult to realize -- given the current paucity of good movies -- that there once was a time when there were so many good movies that one of this caliber has almost been forgotten.

406189,4,6301987810,"Like the superior ""Captain Newman, MD"" and ""Arabesque,"" ""Mirage"" was previously released only as part of a Gregory Peck collection.  It has now been released separately.  This black and white thriller was filmed on location in NYC in 1965.  (As someone who lives in New York and works in Manhattan, I always enjoy seeing the differences between the city then and the city now.)  Peck is an amnesiac wandering the streets and chased by various nefarious characters.  He is assisted by the beautiful and classy Diane Baker and a private-eye in a scene-stealing performance by Walter Matthau.  Other supporting cast members include Kevin McCarthy and George Kennedy.  As someone mentioned the plot is similar to the inferior ""Mister Buddwing"" released a year later with James Garner in the amnesiac role.
""Mirage"" is not a great film and the plot is a made-for-tv variety.  Still it is suspenseful and has its moments.  And like ""Breakfat at Tiffanys,"" it is a nice look at New York City in the early 1960s.",1302912000,4,1004,4.893491124260355

That's what you get in ""Mirage,"" a solid if not brilliant thriller in the vaguely Hitchcockian, post-<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charade/dp/B0001J3SVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charade</a>&nbsp;model. The plot is repetitive at times, but director Edward Dmytryk soaks the entire film in a feeling of claustrophobic creepiness, and  Gregory Peck and Walter Matthou give excellent performances.

After a blackout at the building where he works, David Stillwell (Peck) is greeted by a woman he doesn't recognize, goes down to a sub-basement that doesn't exist, his job doesn't exist, and finds that his apartment apparently hasn't been lived in. Oh, the head of his company also plunges to his death that very night. And a mysterious gunman is suddenly trying to kill and/or capture him.

But when David goes to talk to the police and a shrink, he realizes something shocking -- he can't remember anything of his life until two years ago. And after hiring a private eye (Matthau), he discovers that apparently a conspiracy is erasing all signs of his prior existence.... and yes, more hit men have been sent after him, at the command of the mysterious ""Major.""

""Mirage"" is a good film, though not quite good enough to stand among the titans of the suspense movie like ""Charade"" or ""The Man Who Knew Too Much."" Edward Dmytryk's talent is in making the entire film feel like a long nightmare, in which everything is dangerous and/or uncertain. And he peels away the layers of conspiracy and delusion with a slow, deft hand, tricking us with misconceptions and half-truths at every turn.

However, it also can be rather repetitive (how many times can Shela appear, say vague sinister stuff, and then vanish?) and has some moments that are just too convenient (a small child randomly appears so Peck and his girlfriend can hide in her apartment).

But if the movie is flawed, Gregory Peck's performance is not. He starts the performance as a nice, slightly confused man, but his performance gradually mutates into a wild-eyed, harrowed man who can't run or hide. You really feel sorry for him, especially when it starts making him look a little insane -- and even frames him for homicide.

Diane Baker's role is basically that of a designated love interest, but Walter Matthau is delightful as a quirky, oddball detective who defies all tropes. I was actually rather sad when Matthau exited the film, because he was so much fun. He deserved his own movie.

""Mirage"" has some deep flaws that keep it from being as great as it could be, but it's buoyed by a sense of chaotic fear and a solid performance by Peck.",1301184000,20,2755,5.024122807017544

This is an overly familiar plot device now, but in 1965 it was all the rage (James Garner starred in a less sinister film called ""Mr. Buddwing"" the same year based on a very similar idea). Gregory Peck does a good job of looking suitably concerned and befuddled, and Walter Matthau provides needed comic relief. Black and white might've been a mistake; films built around crazy mysteries like this one just seem to cry out for color (""Charade,"" ""Arabesque""). A more interesting leading lady might've helped, as well, because Diane Baker isn't gonna make anyone forget Audrey Hepburn. Nonetheless, this is a fun and somewhat forgotten film that will definitely hold your interest while it's on, and the DVD print is excellent.",1295654400,73,854,4.896551724137931
406274,3,6301987810,"I understand how this movie might inspire cult devotion, but it confused and irritated me, and I kept wondering how on earth contemporary audiences felt about it.

It must have been audacious in its time, with its parable of big corporations ruthlessly plotting more and better nuclear bombs and apparently killing anyone who threatens their total hegemony.

The amnesia plot is the hook that probably lured them in, but the more I watched the film, the more the amnesia angle seemed totally arbitrary and overdetermined.  Peter Stone, who wrote the script, must have thought otherwise, but imagine if you can what the movie might have been like it if was a straightforward action thriller with Gregory Peck's character trying to protect the precious piece of paper he's been safekeeping.

Peck with amnesia was so much better done in Hitchcock's Spellbound!  Seeing him come down with it again I had that rueful feeling of ""fooled me once, shame on you, fooled me twice, shame on me.""  Peck isn't the warmest actor in the world and maybe he needs a warm co-star to rise to competence on the screen.  And Diane Baker seems even colder than Peck here, so she's no help.  Funny that the 60s, in which so many ""cool"" actors became stars unexpectedly (Steve McQueen, Lee Marvin), didn't really do much for Peck's career, but twisty, heady, mind games like Mirage couldn't have helped much.",1273622400,3,1385,4.863829787234042

I love this movie so much I made myself a DVD of it a few years ago.  I had to rent the VHS from Scarecrow Video, and because it was their only copy -- and long out of print -- they made me put down a $100 deposit on the tape.

That's how much I love this movie.

The movie has a palpable sense of vertigo about it (pun intended) where accountant David Stillwell suddenly realizes that two years of his life are missing.  He sets out to fill in what his amnesia has removed, and all sorts of dangerous situations result.  The Hitchcockian direction by Edward Dmytryk, the performances by Peck, Baker, Matthau, Weston, Kennedy & Erickson, the Herrmannesque score by Quincy Jones, the eerie black & white photography, the imaginative staging, the use of sound effects, the unforgettable images of watermelons...

Wow, I first saw this way back as a boy one summer afternoon, and the film really drew me in because it has a real compelling weirdness to it in its open scenes.  And things only snowball from there.  The film really moves well in spite of not having a lot of action, and the dialogue is darn good.  In short, it's another darn good story that blends the old 1930s niore genre with some then slightly more contemporary 1960's thriller offerings.  There's even an off handed comment to a popular character in another series of movies within this film.

It's really a good movie, and doesn't get all high falutin nor overly simple, nor even glossy like a lot of today's offerings.  The thing about this film is that ""it all works out"", and has some pretty interesting suggestions to mankind as a whole in terms of his future, and who we are as human beings.  It's that good of a movie.

Highly recommended.  And seeing this film some forty some odd years later, I still think it's a good watch.  Again, they just don't make 'em like this anymore.

7819374,3,6301987810,"Review of Mirage
Hot Toasty Rag, August 28, 2017

Everything about Mirage, from the story to the cast to the camera angles, feels like an Alfred Hitchcock movie. Edward Dmytryk directed this intense thriller, but part of me thinks that Hitchcock did it in secret and hoped no one would remember his presence on the set. After youve seen the movie, youll get that joke.

In the film, Gregory Peck is caught in a buildings blackout, and rather than wait for the power to return and use the elevator, he makes his way down the stairs. He bumps into Diane Baker, who seems to recognize him, even though he has no recollection of who she is. Thats only the start of Gregs very difficult day! The bartender at his favorite hangout claims not to have seen him in ages, but the doorman at his office that he doesnt know seems to know him very well. A stranger approaches him and threatens to kill him if he doesnt deliver his suitcase to The Majorbut Greg has no idea whats going on!

This is a very tense mystery and psychological thriller, with an intriguing script and very memorable lines. If you like Hitchcock movies, add this one to your list; you won't be disappointed. Gregory Peck does a great job in his fright and desperation, and George Kennedy makes a fantastic, tough, and pretty hunky bad-guy. Diane Baker, seen in Hitchcocks Marnie, and a pre-The Odd Couple Walter Matthau join the cast in this film full of twists and turns that will keep you on the very edge of your seat.",1503878400,,1483,4.5055762081784385
