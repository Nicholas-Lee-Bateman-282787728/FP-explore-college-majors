8149765,5,B000JBXHSM,another great video by Fred. If you're familiar with his work I don't really need to say anything here. Great Song Selection and real playing.,1383868800,,142,4.72
8149766,5,B000JBXHSM,"I didn't even like many tunes on this disc-I prefer older Carter style stuff-However Freds' arrangements changed my mind.  I am working on one right now- that pays for the disc by itself, will get to several others in time.  This is a follow-up to his country dvd, close-ups of both hands and a little downhome humor make this worth the 25 bucks.",1263254400,,346,4.476190476190476
