8380140,5,B002THW24E,There is a reason why some movies are called classic and this movie is no different. i really enjoyed this film. i listened to the soundtrack and the broadway soundtrack before i saw the movie and wanted to see it. i thought the movie was directed very well and the music by rodgers and hammerstien is excellent. the acting is great and the set design is beautiful. there is one scene that i thought was done very well and that was the house of old uncle thomas scene. that was really good. let's talk about yul brynner he is excellent as the king of siam. he did an excellent job and so did deborah kerr as anna. if you love musicals this movie is for you. this is a must own film. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do. until next time have a cinematastic day,1505952000,,779,4.1655629139072845
