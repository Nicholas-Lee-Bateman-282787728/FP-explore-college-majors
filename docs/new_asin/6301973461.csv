And that is because, in this edition they included the grout line as an 25th anniversary gift! But they are definitely not acoustic bricks because the sound quality is falling from grace. This as a musical film for heaven sake, what remastering the 'bricks' on the cover if the music sound goes behind the VHS edition?",1522281600,,430,4.746666666666667

406112,5,6301973461,"This is a reedit of the original - and a worthy one. The story I heard was that Waters and Parker wandered into a matine showing of the original in London one afternoon, post-millennium, and were appalled at the film they'd made. What originally worked as genius, catering to a 70s and 80s crowd, no longer felt relevant to them. I suspect the original was intended to be seen in a somewhat, um, elevated state of mind (with chemical assistance).

They took it back to the editing room and recut it drastically, removing a ton of the droning, repetitive animation and paring it down to a very terse, very tight film.

I loved the original, don't get me wrong, but it was a bit of a hair-shirt of a film in spots.

This version is solid, tells the story better, and still has the impact of the original (but without the need for chemical assistance to appreciate it).

If you haven't seen it, get it.

I'm thinking of pairing this with Samuel Goldwyn's ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" as part of a Memorial Day movie marathon - that film being the story of returning WW-II veterans and this one being about the cost of that war on the children born during it.

Both are moving, sometimes painful to watch, and ultimately hopeful (yes, as dark as The Wall is, there is hope at the end).",1509408000,7,1282,4.411016949152542

I learned that the director in my opinion cast the wrong actor to play Pink Floyd's character. Bob Geldof does not like Pink Floyd's music. The actor did not have much dialog but,his little dialog revealed a lot of Irish dialect. This is pretty much a British movie filmed in UK.His acting ability is not bad and his scene on stage as the surrogate band was above average and entertaining.",1494633600,,532,4.610526315789474

408106,5,6301973461,"The vinyl appeared six years after 'Dark Side of the Moon' made them famous. The film was about three years later. Supposedly the music had the same four-man music line-up. In fact the list of supporting musicians and sound-makers is very long. Just as their LP benefited from technical improvements (e.g. stereo sound, electronics) selected late insertions (Clare Torry, and the voices, notably the Abbey Road Irish doorman), so the film has what I take to be green screen or equivalents (the singing classroom has internal repeats - check the token black face) and Gerald Scarfe. There are no full computer graphics: Scarfe's cartoon animations, no doubt helped by 'in-betweening', cannot fit into normal 'realistic' films. His 'wallflower' cartoon and then 'What Shall We Do Now? (' ... Take to drink? Go to shrinks? Give up meat? Rarely sleep? Keep people as pets? ...') are the most impressive sequences by Scarfe; he may well have been responsible for the scared-face masks. Scarfe's website has a short video of sequence of BBC people saying nice, but absurdly exaggerated, things about him: Scarfe turns out to be rather empty. So does this whole escapade: it's memories from early post-war Britain, and to the 1960s, as filtered by intensive propaganda. The fatherless house with lino, the cartridge box, routine death communication, school dominie, fears of 'the Bomb', the CND meeting with a pickup, are uninformed memories. They seem to me well done: ""if you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding!"" is just right for times of rationing. The later superstar material is grafted on and doesn't really work; maybe they had no images of Geldof playing a stadium somewhere.

As with many people famous in youth, there's a lack of substance here; as with both the Beatles and Rolling Stones, and Monty Python, they had no motive to grow up and learn. The whole history and war presentation (not really even 'Second World War'; just 'war') is childish or at any rate immature. Fortunately we're spared fake atrocities; but some hint of Dunkirk might have been interesting. But the really huge atrocities are simply ignored. Queen and 'everything I had to know/ I heard it on the radio' shows a similar attitude. Of course this is so common many people don't even know the are other versions. I commented on a Youtube somewhere that Japanese soldiers had probably heard their home town and family had been burnt out in US bombing raids; how would you expect them to feel?-and getting a puzzled silence. I have to feel some sympathy with the teachers (presumably something like extras) and their time-bell synchronised march to their classrooms, past the black dadoes with red walls, echoing the marching hammers (Nazzies, geddit) of Scarfe. They were victims, like soldiers, told what to do, just as they were told it was 'Hitler's War'.

As far as I know, Pink Floyd did nothing much subsequently. Unless you count 1990, Saturday 21st July, Potsdamerplatz, Berlin, with Roger Waters and the Bleeding Heart Band. It would be nice to think they might produce a mature work. But of course they never will. Alan Parker (director) may have been selected because he did Fame a couple of years before: music, and fantasy, presented chaotically, with what he thought of as a low class London backgroundhe was a good choice. I wonder what happened to Kevin McKeon, the 'young Pink'. And whether 'black '44' and Royal Fusiliers Company C was historically correct.",1463616000,,3468,4.967297762478485

408833,5,6301973461,"A mandatory purchase for all Pink Floyd fans, this iconic 1982 Alan Parker-directed film based on the album looks fantastic in its new Hi-Definition film transfer with the images spotless and colors perfectly saturated. Sonically it is also a real treat. Going through my quality Hi-fi stereo system set up around my large LED TV the sound is stunningly good. My son and I sent the ladies out for a couple of hours, closed the curtains, cranked up the volume and had a blast. Adding to the pleasure is a bucket-load of extras  substantial documentaries, a commentary (by Roger Waters and Gerald Scarfe) and lots of tidbits including a video of Hey You, a song inexplicably omitted from the complete film.

The only quibbles I have about this DVD concern the film itself. Coming to it for the first time in 25 years I was reminded of the same reservations I once had when viewing it in the kitchen of my college dormitory. I still don't like what has been done to Mother. One of the best songs on the album, it is slowed down, the guitar being replaced by lullaby baby bells at the beginning. It even grinds to a halt half way through only to resume again. The original album version is simpler and much much better. Also, the added musical material still does nothing for the film, especially the very first song etching in daddys life on the Anzio front before he is butchered. A lot of extra imagery and noises have been added between songs and still serve to stretch a concept which was already wafer-thin perilously close to breaking-point  come on Roger, stop wallowing in self-pity and get a life! As a concept album for listening only theres never a problem with this. We can forget the story and simple relish the extraordinary songs. Put to images in a film however, and the thin-ness is all too evident.

That said, there is more than enough in the film to make it essential viewing  Bob Geldofs miserable posturing in front of the TV, the kids being processed and marched into the mincer by their draconian teachers, Pink breaking up his hotel room and drowning in the swimming pool, the emotional meltdown of Comfortably Numb and the spectacular staging of a fascist rally replete with animated marching hammers are just some of the highlights. Other points of interest are Bob Hoskins in an early role as Pink's tour manager and a reference to Dark Side of the Moon (the poem the teacher ridicules Pink for in class contains some of the lyrics for ""Money""). I still find Gerald Scarfes animation spot-on in the grotesque caricatures (especially the wife as a deadly flower and then later a scorpion), and Alan Parkers punchy no-nonsense direction straightforward and unobtrusive. The album is pictorialized pretty much as it is with only the minor alterations mentioned above to qualify the total effect. Buying this is a no-brainer for fans. Watching it with my son I just thought how wonderful it was to experience this blast from the past and pass the passion on to the next generation",1445904000,,3001,4.708571428571428

409476,5,6301973461,"""Spoiler Alert"" A fascinating movie in many ways. The main thing to remember is that Bob Geldof (playing the role of pink) is slowly slipping into madness. Most of these scenes are metaphorical. The lyrics themselves are extremely important due to the fact that they explain why the scenes in the movie are metaphorical. His overbearing wife turning into a scorpion. His schoolteacher grinding students into uniformity. My favorite cinematic is without a doubt when the dove of piece literally explodes into the bird of war leaving a bloody trail where once a town was.

I won't go quite that far, but, if you consider numbers and the outlandish media coverage of the up-coming Floyd album, I can see how someone might come to that conclusion.

When The Wall  was released, Michael Jackson was Number One on the Billboard list. Within hours of the first sales of The Wall, it was Billboards Number One, and it remained there week after week after week after week.",1421539200,,596,4.542056074766355

This is not a usual movie. It is mostly symbols and surrealist images (reminds me of David Lynch movies) with great music written by Roger Waters.

I am not sure but if the original masters exist it should be now that Pink Floyd (David Gilmore) has said it's over, ""there's nothing left"" with the release of 2014 The Endless River boxset.

410272,5,6301973461,"I remember my first time watching this, I had no idea what was going on. After running through it a few more times, as well as listening to the album, and discussing it with a friend who had watched it and listened to the album as many times as me, we figured it out. Even after you have it all down, you can watch it again and come to the realization that there was a substantial amount of symbolism behind the message that you missed (this also applies when you listen to the album). Without providing too much of a spoiler, the stories underlying message is that history tends to repeat itself. The story centers around a rock-star named Pink (clever?) who lost his father at an early age during WWII. Growing up with an over-protective mother (due to her son being all she has) and in a society that strongly suppresses any artistic desires, Pink often finds himself devoid of emotion. The bricks in the wall. so to speak, are the different components within his life that further cause him to detest society around him. Upon reaching adulthood he finds himself the star of the show, living the life of sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll. During this process his wife cheats on him, putting another brick in his wall. The final brick occurs due to his drug addiction. This causes him to utilize his following to become the next Hitler, starting a purist genocide in England, with promise that they will once again dominate the world.

The climax and resolution speaks for themselves.

While everything isn't as clear cut for the world as with other rock opera's such as ""Tommy"", and many of the scenes appear to be strongly drug-influenced, they all server a purpose towards the message. The animation in this movie is beyond reproach, as someone who doesn't appreciate art very much, I really like the work they did in it. Aside from Pink, we never get to know any of the other characters, aside from their hurtful qualities, however, this was not intended for character development. I find this story fascination mainly due to their method of presentation, it has offered me and my friends countless hours of discussion time to break down what is happening. Not a movie I would suggest watching alone, and while the concept of watching it while you aren't sober might seem enticing (and even be worth the watch), there is much in here to actually look at and think about.

410545,5,6301973461,"There are many out there who equate Pink Floyd and anything that they do or write as ""stoner music"" or cop out and say ""you have to be on drugs to understand it"".

The hubris of the small minded, I say.  It is fairly easy to understand ""The Wall"", all you need is an open mind and empathy to understand it.

The story of which is about a rocker, named Pink, who is slowly losing his mind.  Through the course of the film we track through his mind, his memories, his nightmares.  All stemming from the loss of his father in World War 2, a smothering mother, an atrocious teacher, horrid classmates and on through blinding musical success and then, the final brick in the wall, the breaking of his heart by an unfaithful wife.  Each one creating a brick upon brick in the wall that separates him from his fans, his friends and the rest of the world.  A psychological defense from a cruel and unemphatic world until at last he becomes a dictator in his own mind, one that is as cruel, malicious and heartless as the world that had hurt him.  Finally, he let's slip his emotions in front of a total stranger and thus sets himself on trial for showing his humanity when he's already isolated himself from humanity.

All in all, it's a very multiple layered, beautifully written, frightening and enjoyable experience for both a movie lover and a music lover.",1380844800,,1352,4.463414634146342

Thought ya
Might like to go to the show.
To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow.
Tell me is something eluding you, sunshine?
Is this not what you expected to see?
If you wanna find out what's behind these cold eyes
You'll just have to claw your way through this disguise."" - R. Waters

And with that begins the 92 minute opus based on one of the greatest, if not the greatest, concept album ever realized!

But it was released some 30 years ago. Why bring it up now? Well...Why not? A work of art this important deserves all the attention it can get. And as sit here writing this I'm playing the album loud while my little girls play nearby. I'm very deliberate in the exposure because I want them to absorb it's brilliant nuances at their ripe young ages. ""Mother will she tear your little boy apart? Mother will she break my heart?""

For those of you too young or...for whatever reason, have not watched the Wall, please do so now! It's available on every format imaginable; VHS, Laserdisc, HD DVD, Blu Ray, Betamax, iTunes...you name it! And when you watch it ensure there are no interruptions. Turn off your cell, dim the lights and crank the mofo up loud. You will need to watch more than once. The first time to get the plot of a narcissistic rocker named Pink. Who, as a kid, was brought up by his old and out of date mother having lost his father to the war. He grew up in a `world within a world', not being able to assimilate with other kids his age and longing for a love and attention that constantly eluded him, Pink, of course, develops a talent for songwriting and attains fame. With that fame his descent into madness because absolute and the rest you can experience on your own.

After the first viewing you will want to watch over. Each and every time you watch it again a layer of substance is shed, revealing another layer of substance more intriguing than the last. See `The Wall's"" story really is about so many things. To me, being a parent, it's about how much power and influence we can have as parents and how we have the ability to really do some hardcore mental damage to our children if not careful. It's also a case study on how damaged our society is. How we idolize rock stars instead of teachers or doctors, or scientists. ""The Wall"" may have well been subtitled ""The Decline of the Western Civilization- the Pink years"" for it is every bit about how much rot has accumulated in our popular culture and how we are on a expressway trip to hell. Nothing new, right? But it's ultimately also a story of optimism that things can be different because it takes us on a first hand journey of what's wrong with us so we can know what's right. Ultimately, to me, ""The Wall"" is a cautionary tale on how not to raise your children...I know you were waiting for the optimism...There it is. Now go and do likewise boys and girls...

I first saw the Wall in the late 80s. I think 87 or 88. I gave it a 9 of 10 then. But the more I watched it the greater that number became. Out of the almost 200 films I own, ""The Wall"" is one of few that I have on my regular rotation list. I have it on my iPhone,  iPad, my i Mac, on Blu Ray and on DVD. I can watch it at anytime, anywhere and I often do. For every time I watch it I think of how my two little girls can gravitate towards someone as nihilistic and self destructive as Pink. I ponder the extent of my own anti socialistic tendencies and know how I must be better. How I must not fail my children. I bet Roger Waters and David Gilmour did not have that in mind when they sat down and fleshed out the album but I am ever so grateful and thankful they did.

411344,5,6301973461,"Pink Floyd's The Wall (movie):  For the fan of Pink Floyd, this movie becomes an instant favorite.  For the person not familiar with the music, this puzzling movie needs to be seen several times just to get a grip on it (if you don't toss it after the first viewing).  Trying to be objective, It's a brilliant collection of images set to the music of Pink Floyd that needs to be deciphered, and not everybody will be willing to go to all that trouble, but for those who do, it is a piece of brilliantly conceived, though depressing, art.

Personal tale:  I saw The Wall in Westwood (California) on opening night (in 1982) with a then film student from UCLA (who is now a popular children's author) and his wife.  While we were in line, the previous group of moviegoers exited the theatre quietly and wobbly.  We looked at each other puzzled.  ""Was the movie that bad?""  We soon entered with the next crowd and found a good set of seats.  My friend turned to the crowd and yelled, ""Who let all this riffraff into the room?""  To which we received various reactions, but everyone was in high spirits in anticipation of the Pink Floyd movie.  As you may know, the movie starts off quietly.  It was not quite in that theatre however, as they had their massive speakers turned ALL THE WAY UP!  Once the first loud cord was struck, I was happy that I had sat down in time because the force of the blast was pinning me to the back of my chair.  I remained in that position for the rest of the movie.  The movie was amazing but the Westwood theatre speakers turned it into an audio, physical, and emotional assault.  Now I knew why the previous crowd was subdued...they were in shock.  We went down the block afterwards to a bar my friend knew of and we went upstairs and sat at a table.  To our surprise, there sat Alice Cooper (whatever his real name is).  He was in a corner, out of the view of the main body of bar goers downstairs.  Poor Alice must have been to the same screening we had attended because he looked as shell-shocked as we felt.  We acknowledged each other's presence politely, finished our drinks, and went home.  We had intended to discuss the movie, but had to allow for a couple of days of recuperation before doing so.  Overall, it was a memorable event.  We all liked the movie, amazingly enough, but decided that we would NEVER purposely listen to anything that came anywhere near that volume again!",1326067200,3,2417,4.426303854875283

411350,5,6301973461,"In spite of Pink Floyd's reputation, don't come into this movie looking for escape. While the film's animation, music, and depth of message can not be beat, newer movies with lots of random ""Hey wasn't that actor also in _____?"" moments are better for distracting the mind.

The Wall is a journey into the darker sides of society. It shows us Pink, a rock-star who is disillusioned with everything our society has to offer and represses all desire for human connection. The cycle of disillusionment, alienation, and oppression unfolds.

The movie begins by contrasting an audience coming to see Pink in concert with images of soldiers in WWII. The effect is anti-movie as much as anti-war. Mass media brainwashes us into conformity as much as the army indoctrinates soldiers.

The movie then takes us through the chronology of Pink's life. The death of his father in battle leaves a big gap in his family life and also a distrust of government, which he represses in order to fit in with other boys his age.

In one scene, a young Pink finds his daddy's military uniform one day, tries it on, and salutes his image in the mirror, as the soundtrack plays When the Tigers Broke Free.

Next comes education. A particularly harsh schoolmaster repeatedly belittles Pink in front of the class, which participates in his ridicule out of their fear of the master's paddle. The harshness of the schoolmaster underlies the larger industrial purpose of modern education--the sorting of children into specialized economic roles. Roger Waters encapsulates the industrial attitude toward people in the chorus ""All in all you're just another brick in the wall.""

The final step is marriage. While Pink becomes a successful musician, he is often inattentive to his wife, more interested in sitting at the piano keyboard than attending social functions, and looking over her at the TV as she tries to be romantic in bed. When she is inevitably driven away, and no longer answers his phone calls, Pink's wall is complete.

We begin to see the dark side of celebrity. Pink willingly participates in the music concerts, even though he feels the music industry is just another authoritarian social institution, offering no authentic human connection. Ironically, the only place Pink finds hope for the possibility of authentic connection is TV, but he knows that's not real.

Pink's repression has cut him off from all authentic human connection. In what could be argued is the climax of the movie, Pink takes on the identity of the leader of a Neo-political movement and moves his adoring fans to adopt dehumanizing attitudes. Director Alan Parker has the crowd transition into a synchronized march and brilliantly superimposes faceless masks over every member of the audience, illustrating the egoless conformity that crowd behavior brings out in us.

At some point in the future, Pink at last yells ""STOP!"" and takes time to reflect on what he has become.

He then heroically looks into himself, as depicted in ""The Trial"". The website A Complete Analysis of Pink Floyd's The Wall says it well:
""In many ways, 'the Trial' epitomizes all that is the Wall, combining the album's high theatrics, unflinching cynicism,
dark humor, tongue-in-cheek irony, deep emotion, and (paradoxically) both unwavering nihilism and steadfast optimism.
The song is a seeming contradiction, offering a dichotomous look at the light and dark, good and ill, of Pink's life
from a number of different perspectives, all of which take place within the mind of one person.""

Roger Waters explains, ""the judge is part of him just as much as all the other characters and things he remembers. They're all in his mind, they're all memories."" Although bizarre at first glance, the""The Trial"" is a fitting ending to the multiple themes the film touches on.

The Wall, both the album and the movie, is enormous in scope. It's about what concentrations of power and authoritarian social structures do to our souls. For anyone looking to face these deep issues head-on, The Wall offers ample opportunity for reflection.",1317513600,2,4065,5.023774145616642

411474,5,6301973461,"Pink Floyd ""The Wall"" is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's simply life changing. The way the lyrics are nearly all of the dialogue was something that has never been done so skillfully before or since. Geldof who was a little known punk artist at the time is perfect for the part of Pink. The way the movie depicts his childhood and his descent into madness and finally his transformation into a fascist like the ones who killed his father is just brilliant. Some of the scenes are blood curdling. The transition in the middle of the movie with ""One of My Turns"" is the best part of the entire movie for me.

The movie includes songs that aren't on the original albums, and some of the lyrics are different. Geldof does his own singing in the movie, and I think it was a good idea. He brings an attitude that wouldn't have been nearly as effective if Waters or Gilmore had done the singing. Lip syncing just would not work on those scenes. Some people may not be aware of it, but part of the movie is autobiographical for Roger and many of the crazy scenes are based on things that happened with Syd before he cracked up. Even the melting face is based on an incident where Syd put a bunch of Bryl Creme and Mandrax (quaaludes) on his head before going on stage. It looked like his face was melting when he got under the lights. That's what Roger said it was based on.

The plot has been re-hashed so many times that it's probably useless to do it again here. I'll simply say that if you haven't seen ""The Wall"", you should. It's not for everyone. I used to have a genuine movie marquis poster over my bed. My wife made me take it down when we were dating because it ""freaked her out"". It does freak some people out.

The movie, while filled with all sorts of creative efforts to tell the story of ""Pink"" and his downward spiral into madness, comes across as nothing more than a hodgepodge of vignettes with little or no connection to each other. Unless one knows The Wall beforehand, one will be completely lost in following this movie. Watching this movie, I thought of other movies that attempted to bring music albums to life. Two much more successful examples are The Who's ""Tommy"" and ""Quadrophenia"". These efforts were more successful because they didn't take their respective albums as screenplays for the films.

411563,5,6301973461,"This movie has just become one of my favorite films of all time after my first viewing. Why? Because of its imaginative surrealism, hard-hitting subject matter, and the always lovable music by Pink Floyd. I never gotten into the band's music, but once I finished watching this movie, it made me become a fan. Anyway, the movie is tells the story of a man named Pink and how his past experiences with different people, places, & things have affected his views of the real world. The plot sometimes references experiences from the band members (for example, Roger Waters' father died during WWII). The best parts about this movie, however, is the symbolism that surrounds the images and music. From the marching hammers to the infamous meat grinder during the ""Another Brick in the Wall"" sequence, you'll never see this much symbolism in the films of today. Plus, the stunning animation by Gerald Scarfe is shockingly beautiful.

The Wall is almost like a Kubrick film: it's uniquely crafted and has a hypnotic quality attached to it. A lot of people say that you should watch this while either drunk or high. I saw it while sober and I don't see how you'd be able to see it any other way. I suggest that you watch it without any drugs or alcohol whatsoever, because you'll find it more awesome that way. The Wall is a great film, and I'm glad that I've seen it now.

411564,5,6301973461,"Rock singer Pink (Bob Geldof) is an angry, lonely and depressed man who use to have a wife (Eleanor David), a bad childhood as a boy (Kevin Mckeon) during the Korean war period, a rotten teacher (Alex McAvoy), a manager (Bob Hoskins), one of his fans (Jenny Wright), a mother (Christine Hargreaves) who cared for him and of course wealth, fame and fortune. But all that matters is his madness through times even by a powerful brick wall that it must be broken even if he becomes a Neo-Nazi that brings hate and all kinds of bad things.

A unique, harrowing and exciting live-action and animated musical rock opera drama from Alan Parker and writer/singer/producer Roger Waters of ""Pink Floyd"" fame. This movie is about madness and how society effects him even from the days of war as a kid, he draws from the real world to fantasies. I think this movie is a powerful film that uses amazing animated sequences by Gerald Scarfe which are so unforgettable that they are iconic, the film is very faithful to the landmark album and uses medium dialog. It plays to the music of Pink Floyd as it's a surreal movie with terrific artwork and memorability but it's not for everyone.

This DVD contains terrific picture and sound remastering like it's new with extras like unreleased film footage, Documentary on the film, commentary, retrospective 45 minute documentary, production stills and trailer.",1285545600,2,1391,4.840336134453781

As far as I'm concerned you could glue googly eyes on crayons as long as you played Pink Floyd music with it I'd STILL buy it!! What kind of a freak doesn't like Pink Floyd?? He even made some nasty crack about Cheech and Chong!! Obviously from the sound of his review he probably has all the personality of a pea. Jeese, who turned over the rock?!!

My uncle loved this movie, and he's 80 years old!! What can I say, the old man has taste!! Respect your elders, buy this DVD!!!

In any kind of packaging, this film is pure perfection. The ""comfortably numb"" segment is nothing short of amazing!! David G. is a GOD on the guitar!! As far as I'm concerned, the animation is as better than a lot of the soulless crap animation that is produced now!
This movie is a timeless masterpiece that never gets old. I've seen the concert and probably watched this movie a thousand times!

411632,3,6301973461,"The Wall is a great album; the movie, Pink Floyd-The Wall is a striking, moving, frustrating muddle.  The images do not cohere in a unified narrative and at many points they overshadow the movie.  The images are superb; the music is superb, but together they add up to less than the sum of their parts.  This could all be explained away as a psychotic nightmare . . . fair enough, but art brings form to experience and clarifies it.  When art simply reflects experience, with all of its chaos and incoherence (if that is what is happening here), we have a classic case of what Yvor Winters called the 'imitative fallacy'.

How do images of rape/asexuality/drug-induced catatonia/fascistic display/the brutality of war/the peaceful tending of field rats cohere?  They don't.  We get it that Roger Waters is psychically riven because of the loss of his father in WWII.  Why are the images here of the trench warfare of WWI?

The overall effect of the film is one that suggests a loss of creative control (or a confusion of it).  The center (in my humble opinion) should be the music, but the music is often overshadowed by the imagery, the background sounds and the (excellent) acting of Geldof.  What should have been some of the titanic moments, e.g., Gilmour's soaring guitar solo at the end of Comfortably Numb, are lost amid the other sounds and visuals.

This is a powerful film but, simultaneously, a great pity.  We do, however, still have the music, and better still we have the album for which (as some critics said at the time) The Wall was only a prelude: The Final Cut, Waters' masterpiece.",1271894400,2,1601,4.715827338129497
411633,3,6301973461,"Pink Floyd is one of the greatest musical artists ever and The Wall one of the all-time best albums. Making the epic rock opera into a film was near-inevitable, but the result was unfortunately less than ideal. It could have been done several ways - as a concert film, a straight movie, a musical, or some combination. Unfortunately, it really did none of these, instead simply playing the music over dialogue-free live action scenes mixed with animation - essentially a long music video before music videos were common. It is thus historically important for prefiguring the MTV crazy by a few years as well as starring the soon to be world famous Bob Geldof, but the film is a failure as both adaptation and on its own terms by any reasonable standard. It was eviscerated by many critics, though some, including Roger Ebert, continue to champion it; the film's reputation seems to keep growing, and it has achieved a cult following. Meanwhile, it remains hotly debated by fans; many, including me, loathe it, and even Roger Waters, the album's architect, calls it ""deeply flawed."" However, it has defenders, especially among those favoring Waters-heavy Floyd. All fans should watch it at least once to make up their own mind, and the DVD's generous extras are enough to entice even those who have already seen it, but non-fans should stay far, far away.

Again, I strongly urge all fans to watch, but I will say why the film disappointed me greatly. First I will focus on what is good, as this is very little. Most obviously and notably, a post-""I Don't Like Mondays"", pre-Live Aid Geldof does a surprising strong job - which is important in that he is onscreen the vast majority of the time and indeed nearly the only actor. There are also a few good scenes, notably the fascist rallies and segments of young Pink roaming a battle-scarred countryside. The film also does a convincing job of portraying gradual insanity and gives an interesting, if perhaps not really accurate, inside look at the rock lifestyle's most extreme side. And of course the music is great, but there is nothing different from the album other than a few minor mix changes, a couple of well-done Geldof vocals, and the pedestrian ""When the Tigers Broke Free"" since released on multiple Floyd albums.

Now for the bad, which is virtually everything else. The main problem is format; the nature of The Wall makes it easy to see why the filmmakers would not have wanted a straight concert film, though the associated tour was probably the most lavish and visually spectacular ever undertaken. Yet the poor product we get makes this highly regrettable, and the fact that a Wall tour video has still not come out is truly criminal. On the other hand, successfully adapting it to a straight film would probably have been impossible, though it could seemingly have hardly been worse. A musical may have been best; I and many others find them inherently corny, but it again could hardly have failed to equal this. What we get is truly lamentable - a music video that goes on far too long. The concept is probably inherently flawed, but execution is poor even so. With a few minor exceptions, the album is played straight through, and the film ostensibly acts it out. This could perhaps have been done at least decently, but the result is simply atrocious. Perhaps the most fundamental problem here is that this is an ""in"" movie to a fault; no one unfamiliar with the album could possibly follow it. The execution is so bad that even the fact of the album playing along to it hardly helps. This is of course irrelevant to fans, but even they should realize how deep of a flaw this is. The problem is mainly due to a bizarre lack of synchronization; the famous Dark Side of the Moon/Wizard of Oz sync almost works better despite being unintentional. Many scenes do a very inadequate job of conveying accompanying songs' emotions or even basic sense. Some - e.g., ""Young Lust"" - even flatly contradict them. Added elements - such as the infamous rat - are even worse. Perhaps sensing this, the filmmakers threw in seemingly at random an array of sexual imagery and violence without even bothering to connect it. Even scenes that would have seemed nearly impossible to ruin - like that accompanying the ""Happiest Days of Our Lives"" line ""their fat and psychopathic wives would thrash them within inches of their lives,"" which practically anyone could have made hilarious - fall disastrously flat. Waters clearly saw much of this, refusing to allow the reel accompanying ""Hey You"" to stand; we thus lose one of the album's best songs. Unfortunately, much of the footage was used elsewhere where it does not even remotely fit. Waters also points out another major flaw - in contrast to the album, the film has no humor; even scenes accompanying songs like ""Another Brick in the Wall Part 2"" and ""The Trial,"" which are funny on the album, lack it. However, to me, the biggest problem is Gerald Scarfe's animation, which takes up nearly twenty minutes. Strangely, many disagree; some think it the highlight or even the only strength. In my view, though, it is simply stupid beyond measure; the animations are amateurish and the execution shoddy. It rarely has any real connection to the music, and transitions between it and live action are shockingly jerky. The few high points do not nearly compensate for such disastrously fatal flaws, making this in my view not only perhaps the worst rock-related film ever - which of course says much - but one of the worst ever period.

The many extras thankfully make the DVD somewhat more worthwhile; even those who have seen the film previously and hate it as much as me may be intrigued. They include a documentary made at the time that consists mostly of filmmaker interviews and a longer later documentary. The contrast is interesting; the infamous tensions that surrounded the film are clear in the first documentary but mostly gone in the later, letting those involved reflect more objectively. Even more interesting is the contrast between the always brutally honest Waters and the rest, all of whom seem to think they made a masterpiece. There are also several minor extras, including deluxe packaging overseen by longtime Floyd designer Storm Thorgerson. Whether or not all this makes the DVD worth purchasing for those who have already seen the film is of course a very open question.

Fans who have not seen this should watch, if only to say they have, while others should avoid it at all costs unless feeling unusually masochistic. Nothing will save the film, but it did well at the box office, and DVD sales continue to be strong, showing just how far a great album can carry a bad movie.",1270425600,,6703,4.785837651122625

411774,1,6301973461,"I noticed that you failed to mention Richard Wright in your reply to B. Alexander! It seems to me that Richard Wright was and has been the most maligned, mistreated and ignored member of ""Pink Floyd"", and if ""Pulse"" and ""Delicate..."" are not, to many of you, the ""real"" ""Pink Floyd"" then the same can be said of ""The Final Cut"", which to me was really Roger Waters first solo Album with the ""Pink Floyd"" name slapped on it so Roger could suck as much money off of the ""Pink Floyd"" name as he could get!
  I can see how you might think David Gilmour, Syd Barret and Roger Waters would be part, and I stress PART of the ""Creative Core"" of ""Pink Floyd"", but to add Nick Mason to that ""Creative Core"" of ""Pink Floyd"" before and without even mentioning Richard Wright is Asinine!
  Nick Mason was a great drummer, no doubt about that, but a drummer nontheless his input being 1 piece, ""The Grand Vizier's Garden Party"" that he wrote for the album ""Ummagumma"" no vocals on that song that I remember! The only times Mason's voice has been included on Pink Floyd's albums are ""Corporal Clegg"", the single spoken line in ""One of These Days"" and spoken parts of ""Signs of Life"" and ""Learning to Fly"" (the latter taken from actual recording of Mason's first solo flight) from ""A Momentary Lapse of Reason""! He does, however, sing lead vocals on two unreleased but heavily bootlegged tracks, ""Scream Thy Last Scream"" (1967) and ""The Merry Xmas Song"" (1975-1976). In live performances of the song ""Sheep"", he did the spoken section and yet you consider him to be member of the ""Creative Core"" of ""Pink Floyd""!
  You can't be so dense to the ""Creative Input"" from ""Richard Wright"" can you? Though not as prolific a songwriter as his bandmates Roger Waters and David Gilmour, he wrote significant parts of the music for classic albums such as Meddle, The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here, as well as for Pink Floyd's final studio album The Division Bell!  ""Richard Wright""  was the keyboardist, vocalist and songwriter, best known for his career with Pink Floyd! Wright's richly textured keyboard layers were a vital ingredient and a distinctive characteristic of Pink Floyd's sound. Wright frequently sang background and occasionally lead vocals onstage and in the studio with Pink Floyd (most notably on the songs ""Time"", ""Echoes"", and on the Syd Barrett composition ""Astronomy Domine"")!",1234742400,6,2386,4.732530120481928

411849,5,6301973461,"The film version of Pink Floyd's The Wall was released in August of 1982.
The movie did fairly well at the box office. It initially grossed $23 million which was alot of money back in 1982 considering it was competing against films like E.T., Rocky III and the first Poltergeist. I first saw the movie when my father rented this movie for me when I was 9 (I am not joking folks, this was in September, 1985 as I had been a fan for quite some time by then).
It is still a great film even today though some say too overdramatic. The screenplay was written by Floyd bass player/singer/lyricist Roger Waters amd the film was directed by Alan Parker (famed for the movies Midnight Express, The Committments and Evita) and starred Boomtown Rats frontman (and future Live Aid and Live 8 organizer) Bob Geldof in the leading role as Pink.
Originally, the film was to be footage of the band performing The Wall concerts at London's Earls Court but was scrapped at Parker's request (though this footage is available via bootleg in not bad quality).
The movie tells the story of Pink, a rock star whom had a traumatic life. His father died in WWII, had to contend with an overbearing mother, cruel sarcastic teachers, an unhappy marriage and a successful music career. One night after calling his wife and hearing she cheats on him, he invites a groupie into his hotel and loses it.
The character was based on part-Waters, part-Keith Moon, part-Syd Barrett and part fascism.
The film is noted for having the unreleased tracks When The Tigers Broke Free (parts 1 and 2), a new version of Mother, the studio version of What Shall We Do Now. Plus new versions of Another Brick in the Wall (part 3), Is There Anybody Out There?, Bring the Boys Back Home and Outside the Wall. Also, Bob Geldof does the vocals on both parts to In The Flesh (one with a brass band). The rest of the tracks were re-mixed and/or edited.
Gerald Scarfe's animations in this film are the same as the ones shown at the original Wall concerts Pink Floyd performed in 1980 and 1981.
This DVD (which was re-released with new artwork to coincide with The Wall album's 25th anniversary with a new slipcase cover and artwork) has bonuses of The Other Side of The Wall documentary as aired on MTV in 1982, the Another Brick 1980 video filmed to promote the album and aired on Don Kirshner's Rock Concert and Midnight Special, the theatrical trailer and various other surprises.

It's basically a bunch of scenes attached together that fit together with the music from the Pink Floyd album.  In other words, while the music is playing from the Wall album, you can see the lyrics from the songs matched together with the scenes on the screen.  Most of the scenes involve a little school boy who appears lost and confused when it comes to family and school.

My favorite scene is the same one MANY people who currently hate, or have hated in the past, the dreadfully LONG hours (and days) of going to school and learning.  Man, it really stinks to be a kid and have to do the same old routine day in and day out as far as learning and classroom assignments are concerned.  In the movie, you get to see what going to school is like through a childs eyes, and how boring it can be.

Also, another highlight of the film was all the incredibly diverse and creative animation that fit in well with the music.  A colorful tale and vision that was beautiful in every sense.  It almost looks like an amazing drug trip.  You truly have to see it to know what I mean.  Worth watching!",1207958400,,1171,4.321100917431193

So I finally looked on Amazon.com and found this one on sale for less than $15 - I snatched it up immediately. The movie itself is indescribable - you just have to see it for yourself. It's a look into a disturbed mind that goes beyond anything else you've ever seen. There's not much of a linear storyline, it's more like... a music video for an entire album.

Now I sold my VHS copy and bought this thing.....,the picture is great,BUT I don't have any surround sound system capability. So let me warn any buyers that DON'T have a 5.1 system that THIS DVD HAS NO STEREO MIX option.

This means that when I play it most of the film has almost no audible soundtrack,...until the music comes in loud.  Then it almost blows the speakers on my TV set.  This must be because most of the quiet sounds are set to play from the rear speakers (that I DON'T have),and the LOUD sounds just flare up past the level of endurance.

I am sick over the fact that I sold my perfectly good VHS copy of this,especially since this version of the film is almost unbearable to listen to and watch on a stereo set.

411940,3,6301973461,"Looking back at Alan Parker's work, he was great for capturing the dark side of postwar England. You watch ""Angelas Ashes"" and ""The Committments"" and you can see the thread that leads back to ""The Wall"".

Supposedly there's a screentest that had Roger Waters audition for the role of Pink, but Boomtown Rat and Live Aid/Live 8 mastermind Sir Bob Geldof got the part. And he wasn't a Pink Floyd fan until years later.

But I think Parker made it a little too downbeat. There are things on the album that I think Roger comes across a little more over the top through it, and hopeful towards the end.

There is a story, but it's very nonlinear. You see the rock star's spiral into his own madness (similar to Syd Barrett) and what drove him there, but the theme of ""The Wall"" is a breakdown in communication and the walls we build around us, or built by others. You assume there's redemption at the end but it's really hard to tell.

Does the wife take up with the lover because Pink was sleeping with groupies to begin with? ""Young Lust"" should've captured Pink putting the band together a little more, out on the hunt for nubile maidens as the song suggests, instead of turning it into being about the groupies. By the time the groupie gets to Pink, his wall is already in place...bored and uninterested. The mother in the movie isn't all that menacing, neither is the wife until ""The Trial"". I thought this should've been ratcheted up a lot. The teacher however, is dead on. ""Another Brick in the Wall"" is definitely one of the best parts.

The highlight of the film is ""Comfortably Numb""... it's wonderfully filmed and is as creepy as anything Cronenberg's done.

Scarfe's animation had been used for the band's live shows and is used here, also a great highlight of the movie.

Big reason to have this is because it's in surround. The documentary's ok, and seeing the original ""Another Brick in the Wall II"" promo's cool.",1189209600,,1923,4.5726744186046515
412002,5,6301973461,"Back in the day, when I was in high school, I absolutely could not stand Pink Floyd with the exception of one song (Wish You Were Here).  When tracks came across the radio I just tried not to listen and couldn't understand the hype.
Then for reasons I can't recall, my girlfriend (later my wife) and I went to see The Wall when it released at the theater.  I sat, mesmerized and staring at the screen.  To see the movie is to hear the entire album set from start to finish and the movie put it all in context.  The thing I was missing before, I understood now.  The music of Pink Floyd is put together in albums and if you don't listen to them that way they are disconnected and just don't make sense.
Now I was hooked and started to listen to PF albums instead of individual cuts.  I bought the cassette tape (hi-tech back then), wore it out, wore out a backup copy, wore out another tape and years later bought the CD set.  Today I'm buying the DVD and can't wait to experience it all again.
Bottom line, the movie is dark, it is disturbing, and it is terribly awesome.  Pink Floyd played the music of the insane.  Maybe it is the insane who still play the music of Pink Floyd.  In any case, I can't wait to introduce my 15 year-old son to it.  Wonder if his jaw will drop like mine did?",1183852800,6,1289,4.157258064516129

412004,3,6301973461,"I remember first time I watched this film in movie theatre when it was released to the first theatrical events, I left the room really disappointed. I felt that Floyd had lost one great opportunity of creating a masterpiece of images and music. By that time we all were still under the impact of Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" album a real masterpiece and there was a great expectation about the film, but I have to confess, I had an insight that it wasn't to happen and why I affirm this, because one of the worst experiences I have ever had in my life was my decision of watching the worst film of all times, a film called ""Fame"" or ""Infamous if you like"", and guess who was the director of this ridiculous film, yes Alan Parker, so I couldn't expect nothing better from this guy really. Can you all remember good films this guy has been done? Well, no, so do I! It was really a disaster this choice, but how we cannot change what happened, I only can give three stars for the few really good moments this film has, like that of ""Goodbye blue sky"" and I'm sure this great moments is much more because of the music than the image itself, no, one thing we have to say and recognize ""the work of Gerald Scarfe is a real work of genius"" he was with Pink Floyd since the creation of the fantastic ""The Wall"" artwork. Can you all imagine if this film had been done by Ridley Scott with the help of Gerald Scarfe, wow, simply no comments... It would have been a truly masterpiece!",1178755200,3,1468,4.284172661870503
412005,3,6301973461,"And not a great one, by any measure. While I'm sure the Pink Floyd fan boys will slobber all over this and proclaim its genius, the truth is that it's really pretty boring. Random trivial war images, check. Random trivial teen angst and rebellion images, check. Random trivial drug lifestyle images, check. Random trivial imagery of fascist oppression. Hooray! It's paint by numbers anti-establishment. FIGHT THE INSTITUTION! I guess this explains why Pink Floyd zealots have a long standing reputation of excessive drug use, you'd have to be toasted in order to find brilliance here. No dialogue and a non-linear story line makes it so the film is really nothing but a long music video, which like most videos depends on symbolic imagery, and we learn that film isn't Roger Water's medium. Instead of four or five music videos (which is how it would probably be done today) from a solid album, they made one huge video from a concept album. Actually a great idea and quite progressive for the time. But it's still boring.  I guess if I'm pressed to say something truly positive about the film, it set a strong precedent that music videos have the potential, as a medium, to do something very special, above and beyond what the song itself could do. That music videos can be something more than just performance/concert videos. Of course, it just showed the potential, it didn't actualize that potential.

Usually, with any criticism of Pink Floyd, you can expect the usual  diatribes from the fan base about how you just don't get it, it's over your head, beyond your grasp, blah blah blah, but the sad truth is, there's just nothing here. It's just plain boring.

There's nothing. Well, except maybe we learn that someone in Pink Floyd has serious mommy issues. And even as the film bores you to tears, the music really is fantastic. In fact the music is so great it really does illustrates how they tried so hard, and fell so far short with the film. Buy the album, forget the film! The music alone salvages three stars for this, the album itself rates much higher.

And really, the flower scene?  Just lame.",1175472000,6,2111,4.73841961852861
412006,4,6301973461,"Pink Floyd's the Wall is not your typical rock concert like Tommy or Jesus Christ Superstar, but is an allegorical story about a rock star who is descending into madness. Each bad event in his life helps to add another ""brick"" into the wall of insanity that he, Pink, is building around himself to shut out the real world. While Pink is fictional, he embodies in part the story of real-life Pink Floyd member Sid Barrett whose LSD induced behavior ultimately got him removed from the band and elements of the way Roger Waters was was beginning to feel after touring for a long while which led to his writing The Wall.

At turns grim, weird, bloody, violent, a bit sexy, and even a little bit funny, this movie is very compelling to watch even though it's not as easy to understand (for instance, the marching hammers). Yet, the lyrics of the accompanying Pink Floyd music helps to hold everything together so that the sum of the parts is much greater than the individual parts of this movie. I only gave it four stars instead of five because of the letterbox format that cuts away half of the screen if youhave a small TV set. If you had a huge projection screen it would be a different matter. While DVD offers more features, if you want to see the picture in all of its glory, then until a full screen version comes out (if there isn't one already) it's best to get the VHS version.",1174521600,6,1384,4.427450980392157

412008,5,6301973461,"Unlike most people posting reviews of this film here, I had not seen it when I was younger, while on drugs, nor did I even know what Pink Floyd was. Rather I simply found a short clip from ""The Wall"" online, watched it, and was stunned. Needless to say, I hunted down the film, and watched it in one sitting, and when it was over?

I bought the original 2 disc album, and listened to it daily. Truth be told, the music itself tells a pretty good story, if dark and depressing for a good deal of it's duration. Had I heard the music before the film, I'd have known what to expect. Of course I didn't, but comparing the two is pretty stupid in my opinion. The reason for that is, while hardcore fans seem to take to heart the fact that the key factors in the production of this film weren't happy with it, they did in fact create a masterpiece of film and music fused into one giant story that has more layers and depth then most films I can name.

Trying to take ""The Wall"" and make a film from it, must have been as trying and difficult as Kubrick's direction of ""2001"", as both films are stretching and reaching to not only absorb you, but trap you in a world of sight and sound, where there is no escape till the credits roll. The problem with this film is, too many people are viewing it once or twice, and missing more complex metaphors to physiological viewpoints or at the bare minimum, the main point. Merging live action segments with animation, creating tripy and psychedelic imagery for a purpose. It isn't just random algimations here, we are seeing the inner workings of a mind that seeks to isolate itself from the world...and thus build a wall, to keep everything and anything out.

It's much deeper then that, but what must be said is, despite how bizarre or insane it might seem, it's a film that anyone can connect with, since it isn't about ""Pink"", it's about everyone, and everything, just as ""2001"" wasn't about outer space, it was about humanity and evolution. Everything you see is just window dressing for the real message-

""Tear down the wall"".

This film introduced me to Pink Floyd's music, and to ""The Wall"", which stands as one of the greatest rock albums of all time. The film is the visual representation of that album...therefore?

It's one of the greatest films ever made, that doesn't require you to know the music, the band, or anything before going in. Just know you will be glued to your chair for the duration, and when it's over?

412010,4,6301973461,"Alan Parker has always had a gift for the integration of music and film, and his efforts over the years have reflected that. Movies like ""Fame"" & ""The Commitments"" have made him a director more remembered for his music video skills than his storytelling, even though he directed gripping controversial more seriously films, like ""Midnight Express,"" and ""Mississippi Burning.""

""The Wall"" tells the account of a rock star's breakdown, Pink Floyd slowing down into madness... Pink's madness is illustrated with living flashbacks of his life... He has visions of his childhood from a baby held in the cradle to his present moment... We have little Pink suffering from alienation for the death of his father in the war, and taken under the care of his mother... We have also rock and roll star Pink, who is destroyed by his evident insanity and is driven over the edge by his wife's infidelity and we have a blown insane Pink, a Nazi dictator under the Hammer Regime leading a series of occurrences like raping, breaking and pillaging...

Alan Parker translates the music into memorable images that are insensible to love or pity... All of Pink's life is projected on the screen... We see and hear songs altered from an abstract concept into a disgusting vision of students being thrown into a meat grinder...

Pink constructs the wall by building up tension... In mixing up sexuality and violence, he creates a new window into Pink's character... The animated sequences that reflected Pink's foolishness are important and influential...

Alan Parker's direction moves the story cleverly from the present into the past and into a possible future, drawing a warning, but still contemplating traumas of a child with hurtful effects on the fully grown man... The result is a mad piece of cinema, a kind of a bad dream becoming even worse than usual...

The film exploits great special effects, some frightful and impossible to understand... The music praises the film so well from declaring noisy rock and roll music to quiet ballads of insanity...

Bob Geldof is amazing as Pink, the British rock star broken in pieces under the psychological pressure of an American Tour...

Pink Floyd-The Wall is a bizarre animation reinforcing its vision of an insane, inhumane, unjust and cruel world, not easy to follow...

The movie is perfect, especially since they didn't add any dialogue from what has been done in the album, what you hear on the CD is what you hear in the movie. At some points disturbing though, not something I would suggest children to watch but for anyone who has a love for this band as I do, this is a must-have.

412072,5,6301973461,"""The Wall"" is a partly animated film with music augmented from the Pink Floyd album of the same name, directed by Alan Parker and animated by Gerald Scarfe. Reflects the band really well, I think.

Bob Geldof plays Pink, a rock star who's burnt out, traumatized by his past and recently divorced. He remembers his childhood, imagines his future and sinks into the metaphors of his head, of walls, of faceless students, of blood and lusty flowers. It's interesting that way, how it all flows, it is like a mix of imagination and memory. It's pretty intense imagery.

Special features include a commentary by Roger Waters and Gerald Scarfe, where they discuss inspirations, memories and the making of the film. There's also a couple of loose music videos, one for ""Another Brick in the Wall"" and another for ""Hey You"", there's a promotional trailer, a making of documentary, and a couple of galleries of stills and concept art.

Transparent pandering to teenage angst and unspeakably commercial.  ""We don't need no education"" -- give me a break.

Still haven't seen the film and never will.

We were all crushed when this was released.  It seemed nothing at all like ""our"" Floyd -- precious little of the weird time signatures and keys, way-too-long-for-radio songs, cosmic themes, etc.  Should have included a subtitle ""We went for the money, mates.""

Of course, it's well-produced -- we'd expect nothing less of the band.  And Mother, Hey You and the breathtaking Comfortably Numb do make the album worth a buy -- grudgingly, on principle alone.  Gilmour's work on CN is, of course, jaw-dropping to anyone who's ever picked up a guitar.  It almost -- almost -- saves the double album.

But don't expect much more from this crude, self-indulgent, materialistic nightmare from Waters.  Hard to believe he consciously prostituted himself and the band's credibility for such vulgar, base commercial success -- and harder still to believe the band would have let him.

Perhaps it was subconscious.  The man has shared his hopes, fears and wonders with us so sublimely over the years, I'll have to give him the benefit of the doubt.

But, conscious or not, if you look in the rock dictionary for the word ""sellout,"" you'll see this album cover.

This movie took the concept album of The Who's ""Tommy"" and transferred it to the big-screen, using only music and absolutely no dialogue to further the story along. I never turn off a movie, no matter how bad I think it is. Except ""Tommy."" In reality, the film wasn't bad...It just annoyed me. There was a huge lack of entertainment going on. I wasn't expecting much from The Wall, but I've heard so many good things about it. I had to see it. Let me say, I haven't heard a lot of Pink Floyd stuff. I've only listened to four albums (Umma Gumma, Dark Side of the Moon, Atom Heart Mother, and Wish You Were Here). Yes, that's right. I haven't even heard The Wall album. This film is simalar to Tommy in the fact that Pink Floyd's music plays throughout the film. The difference is, there is some dialogue in the film although it doesn't move the plot along at all. The other difference is, this film has amazing visuals and is fun to watch. The movie's plot is basically a rock star named Pink (Bob Geldof) sits watching a war movie and begins to remember his childhood. Blended in is memories, fantasies, and a bunch of other [...] that results in one trippy movie to watch. But, as I said, the visuals are what keep you watching. The movie's metaphors (especially the title one) are very smart, the script is by Roger Waters (although I don't know how a person could write a script like this). If you're a Floyd fan/arty kinds of films, check this out for sure. All movies, in my opinion, are forms of art...But this film is actually like a work of art. Anyway, if you're just a moviegoer looking for some entertainment on a Saturday night...This isn't the movie for you.

If you are a rocker, and especially if you turn on to Pink Floyd's self-indulgent negativity, this movie brings to you, in graphic detail. All the nightmares they sing about, all the hidden fears and phobias emerge on the screen in bloody detail.

It is a picture window into the spiral of insanity.  It is the pictoral record of the effects of dodging uncomfortable emotions and situations, whether through drugs, self-indulgence or merely ignoring them. In all cases, all that is accomplished is adding ""another brick to the wall.""

This movie changes Pink Floyd's classic album into a gut wrenching experience, not to be missed.",1145145600,8,718,4.813008130081301
412162,5,6301973461,"I have seen this movie so many times...and each time I can honestly say I can glean something additional that I hadn't gotten before.  This film is a psychological exploration of an individual who falls away from the social norms and in doing so builds a wall between himself and reality.  From his early days as a child longing for a father and his mother's attention to his assent into a rockstar Pink longs for someone to give him what he needs, which is approval.  He is able to obtain this through various means but always subsequently sabotages these efforts.  Each one of these incidents creates ""another brick in the wall"" between Pink and reality.  He subsequently succumbs to being completely shut off from the norms of society and begins to create his own. He then is labeled by some as a villian and others as a hero.  His own self-hatred leads him to hate all others who are different than conventional standards so that he might gain acceptance.  When his ""wall"" is forced to come down what will be the consequences?

I find this to be quite compelling and the visual presentation is stimulating and awe-inspiring.  This is the perfect movie for someone with ADHD (this is a compliment) because there is always a constantly changing presentation from live action to animation, from past to present.  The fantastic music from the album Pink Floyd's The Wall (which the film is based and inspired from) is the dialogue and narrative and is the perfect background to the images flashing across the screen.  Not only is the presentation stimulating to the senses but the story gives much food for thought.  Highly recommended for multiple viewings.",1144713600,7,1658,4.799295774647887

Brokeback mountain? That's simultaneously funny and sad.

In addition to that, I looked up what other reviews this person had made. Apparently they hate classic rock. Also - just incase you were still wondering whether their opinion mattered, let's have a look at an excerpt from one of their reviews for a Britney Spears CD:

Isn't it time you start trusting a mature and experienced critic like me? Isn't it time that you start lsitening to quality timeless music? Then get ""...Baby One More Time."" You won't regret it.

Anyway, as for the movie itself. I have mixed feelings about it.

I love some parts of the movie, and others I don't like that much. If you like the album, you should definitely watch it though. You won't regret it if you do. The best parts in the movie make it worth watching, and watching it gives you a deeper understanding of the wall.

Also, the scenes in the movie where Pink is a child are especially good.

I was a little dissapointed when I found that they cut Hey You out of the movie... until I started paying closer attention: if you think about it, The Wall IS Hey You. Roger Waters said he wasn't completely happy with the movie, but it still turned out to be qite extraordinary. My only grudge with the movie is that they changed the dialogue between the characters a little and they shortened Waiting For The Worms(one of my favorite songs of The Wall), but overall, it's awesome and a must for all Floyd fans.",1140480000,,756,4.4071428571428575

412250,5,6301973461,"First time I saw this film, I was sixteen, staying the night at my best friend's house.  We had not smoked anything (except cigarettes) and I remember feeling like I was higher than I've ever been when it was over. A lot of people say that this is strictly a ""stoner"" film.  Not so.  Out of the hundreds of times I watched it, I was stoned maybe once or twice.  Sure, it was great those two times, but I got more when I was sober.

The thing with The Wall is you have to look BEYOND the visualization to really get it.  For example, the scene that accompanies ""Empty Spaces""(extended), watch that carefully.  You'll see the Wall going up, destroying buildings, churches, and finally stealing innocence.  Going backwards in the movie, the war scenes at the beginning that keep flashing to the stampede/riots at the concert has so many possible meanings it's astounding.  And what about the rampant death that goes with the song ""The Thin Ice""?  The part where Roger is singing ""Mama loves her baby..."" and it's showing a young man who couldn't be more than eighteen who was badly injured gave me chills.  That portrayal is all too true for those times.  The only war that had more children fighting in it was the Civil War.

So what is The Wall REALLY about?  The walls we build within ourselves, our facades, our ugliness and beauty, our private pains made public, our betrayals and the horrible things we do to others (and to ourselves).  Sure, the nudity on ""Young Lust"" is gratuitous and not what I would expect from Pink Floyd but all the rest of it?  VERY deep.  Dark, yes, a little strange (but what would you expect from them?), yes, but deep and beautiful.  Watch it.  If you're over sixteen and like Pink Floyd.",1138492800,3,1720,4.525974025974026

Though you can't just rate a movie on it's music,as thats only a part of what a movie has to offer. Well thats actually an essential chunk of this movie and without it this movie would fall into the depths of chud.(Some songs were removed and some were rerecorded)

The movie has alittle to do with Rogger Waters,and Syd Barrett.(Both were members of Pink Floyd)With a dash of ficiton and drugs you get ""The Wall"".Overall i thought the first half of this movie was great,the second half seemed to drawn out and lost a movie touch. It's like a story with no point. It's fun to watch once, though by the ending it leaves you going ""WHAT JUST HAPPNED?"".The artistic element is genious. The sketches were fluent and really well done for the early 80's.

The extra features are a nice addition,but haven't been touched from the original DVD version. Leaving you to wonder if this was a money scandal, whatever the case was it's cheaper and nicer packeged. I would say to rent this if you liek it buy it and appreciate the oddity.

412256,5,6301973461,"In 1984, when I was 16 years-old, I didn't know any of Pink Floyd's music.  Then one day I rented PINK FLOYD THE WALL, having only heard that it was supposed to be a real cool movie.  Ninety minutes later, I was stunned, dumbfounded, and knocked senseless.  I couldn't believe what I'd just seen and I hadn't understood ANY of it.  Nightmare images combined with intense animation.  But, goddamn, what incredible rock music!  Like a persistent 90 minute rock video!  I rewound it to the beginning and watched it again.  Before the tape had to be returned, I'd watched it three or four times.

Thus began my love for the band Pink Floyd; with a movie.  I raced out to buy THE WALL album, which was almost immediately followed by THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON, WISH YOU WERE HERE, ANIMALS, THE FINAL CUT and MEDDLE.  My obssession was born and Pink Floyd has been my favorite band ever since.

Director Alan Parker will probably be remembered least for this one; not with movies like MIDNIGHT EXPRESS, FAME and EVITA under his belt.  Makes no nevermind.  Pink Floyd fans count for plenty in this world and PINK FLOYD THE WALL will remain a rock and roll movie classic!",1132617600,,1162,4.524038461538462

This was a great movie, it does help in understanding the album a little better. If one were to read the lyrics and pay attention as to what ""the wall"" may mean, then the movie would probably make more sense to you. Sometimes you have to do a little bit of research to enjoy things. Everything is not just going to be handed to you. That is the beauty of Pink Floyd, they want you to think about what things mean. In ending, a little fact that people might not know is that Roger Waters had almost total control in making the album and film. The animation sequences are very interesting and vivid and enjoyable even though most of them are violent. The rest of the movie has great visuals as well, but you probably won't appreciate them as much if you haven't listened to the album.

The great thing about the movie is that it helps explain the album in the easiest way: with pictures.

The Wall is an amazing story more than it is an album. Although it is great, it is not really a Floyd album to me, because it lacks the greatest asset that floyd has to offer: the epicly symphonic pieces of rock music. (excepting Comfortably Numb). The album was made to be listened to by yourself in a dark room. The story is meant to be composed by you, in your head. It is supposed to be meaningful to you in your own head. You deserve to have your own interpretation of it. The Wall is a good movie by movie terms, but it goes against everything that the Wall stood for. The album is ofcourse, asking for a movie like this, but it is much better for the movie to just be in your head, not spoonfed to you by the screen.

People have said you have to be on drugs to like this movie.  They are full of it.  If you like rock music, this DVD is a must see.  A must own.

Worth noting is the fact that a few songs contained in the movie are not actually featured on the regular double album.  My personal favorite scene in the movie is this:  Young Pink finds his dad's Army outfit in a drawer and puts it on.  The sequence is set to a powerful song called ""When The Tigers Broke Free,"" a fitting tribute to a lost family member killed at war.

I have read all the different reviews of this movie, and how it is a movie fraught between three different artist (Waters, Parker and Scarfe) who were trying to put forth thier art onto this movie individually (and sometimes together -waters/scarfe).  This is a valid point, and you can (after being told to look for these things individually) find that some of the points made by these pundits to be somewhat on the mark.

There should be some note of the obvious... if you hire a person to direct, if you hire a person to write, and you hire an artist to make cartoons... they are, by virture of being artist themselves, portray the art as they see it.

Could be there were too many cooks in the kitchen, I am not sure.

ALL I KNOW is that I have always loved this movie since I first saw it as a teen ager, and I still repurchase it when my copy either gets destroyed/stolen/permanently 'borrowed'.  It is a movie that has scenes that are captivating, and emotional and they all are acted out brilliantly.

That to me is what makes a good movie a good movie.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who appriciates good art.  (and the music is excellent as well).

412516,5,6301973461,"The movie itself - compelling, bizarre, incomprehensible (slightly less so once you listen to the director's commentary, but still a baffling story), and completely addictive.  It's a film you won't be watching every week, but certainly once you put it on, you've pretty much committed yourself to falling under its spell for the duration.

But I'm here to primarily discuss the diffrences between the two editions of the DVD.  If you have the previous edition of this DVD, don't bother getting this one thinking that you're upgrading.  The ""limited edition"" disc itself is absolutely no different than the old one - same menus, same extras (nothing more, nothing less), same audio encoding and video transfer, even the same artwork on the disc.  The packaging is the only difference here, and it's a beautiful slim digipak that looks more like ""The Wall"" album than the original box did.  Of course, the original box mimicked the film's promotional poster, so if you're more of a purist in that sense, get that one.  The box is then slipped into an clear acetate case with the movie's logo printed on the outside.  Inside is a fold-out of the movie poster and a few photos.

What's odd though is that the ""limited edition"" is actually 5 bucks less than the previous version.  Five bucks more just to get a standard plastic clamshell case?  I think not!

It is about a rock star who goes into a deep depression because of many hardships in his life, which makes him build a psychological ""wall"" between himself and reality. Based on the troubled lives of some of the band members of Pink Floyd, the rock band who scored and composed the music for this film. It is a uniquely made film using flashbacks to explain the troubled life of Pink (the main character), and some scenes which use very strange images (some animated) to symbolize some of the thoughts of the character. It is not at all a very happy movie, and in my opinion will greatly disturb some of its weaker viewers. But it is still a highly recommended film, especially for those who are fans of the band Pink Floyd, of whom I am very big fan, and for those who want to see a very unique style of film.",1104192000,9,863,4.236363636363636

All of the actors in the film, one of them being the very talented Bob Hoskins, could have done a great job if given actual lines to say.  The film focused more on creating a collection of music videos to all of the wall songs instead of developing characters and a clear plot.  There are times when Bob Geldof's portrayal of Pink is rather haunting and effective, especially when he transforms himself into the leader of the surrogate band.  I am not sure what director Alan Parker intended for this film, but his concept just didn't work.  For example, the film lapses into strange and wonderfully powerful animation sequences, courtesy of the awesome Gerald Scarfe, and then makes an awkward transition back into the real time story.  The animation sequences are entertaining to watch, but they don't serve to solidify the plot or develop the characters.  However, the DVD has some really cool special features including a making of featurette and some music videos as well as easter eggs.  Enjoy!",1103846400,3,1120,4.821989528795812
412522,5,6301973461,"I have been a Pink Floyd fan for years and years. Their music is inspiring, haunting, and meaningful. Incredible, unique lyrics and music make this band both original and a joy to listen to.

That said, it has only been since last year that I have first viewed this film.

The Wall is a well-thought-out movie that puts the entire The Wall album (plus a few new tracks) together and tells the amazing, eerie story through video. The actors/actresses all play their parts well, and the video portions, acted and animated, fit the Pink Floyd atmosphere beautifully.

The Wall takes you on a wild ride with a depressed rocker by the name of Pink Floyd (believe it or not!) who is addicted to drugs, has no free time on his hands due to his fame, and has suffered years of depression from his failing marriage, his awful childhood, and the fact that nobody will listen to him anymore. Pink, throughout the film, builds a wall of hatred and isolation around himself to try to bear with the fear that he gives himself from recalling these events in his life. Things turn for the worse when his wife cheats on him because he ignores her, and his true colors appear when he starts a white-extremist radical hate group. At the end of the movie he gets ""judged"" by those who most effected his life.

The movie is just an incredible experience. The darkness, the emotion, the hatred, that is given off by this movie is chilling and meaningful. Don't watch this movie if you have a very soft stomach, or if you found that films such as A Clockwork Orange were too disturbing to watch. This movie will make you think, and it is one of the most depressing, disturbing, hateful movies that I have ever seen.

However, if you can bear with the overwhelmingness of this film, I guarantee your life will be changed forever.",1103846400,2,1805,4.541538461538462

The director also flopped out with 'Evita' another lacking film.,1103068800,3,380,4.442857142857143
412604,5,6301973461,"As a fan of Pink Floyd, particularly Roger Waters, I have a less cynical view of this effort than many people. After all, for many teenagers even today, this movie serves as a rite of passage even if illegal substances are not involved.

The Wall is presented with little dialogue, letting the music from the album tell the story. Bob Geldof is in the lead role as a mentally unstable rock star dealing with demons of an overprotective mother, a cheating wife, and the memory of a father he never knew while growing up in post war England. This album tells the story of how he became unhinged. There are animated bits in this movie that graphically, and through the use of flowers, portray the sex act as some scary, boy-part eating event, saying a lot about the women in this man's life.

The problem is that people try to seek a more profound meaning in this album and movie that simply chronicle a breakdown that throws the viewer into the depths of it through imagery and sound. It isn't necessarily an ego thing - look to Britney Spears singing ""My Prerogative"" for whining about fame and fortune. I never got that impression from Waters, and in fact, feel that Geldof's character would trade the fortune and fame for some peace and quiet with no human contact. And that sentiment goes deeper than the whining rock star surface-view. But don't read any more into it than that or you will not enjoy it for what it is. It's not out to change the world or the establishment despite it's complaints about it. It's a trip into the depths of madness, and that's all it is.

412607,5,6301973461,"I feel like a total fool trying to write a review of ""Pink Floyd: The Wall."" There is almost no point in even attempting to summarize this extraordinarily symbolic and emotionally complex film into a few hundred words. It's like trying to fully explain why you love someone on one side of a postage stamp. But, I'm always eager to put pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard) in order to review nearly everything I see on DVD or read. Why should Pink Floyd's magnum opus be any different? Actually, this film meant more to me roughly fifteen years ago than it does now. Back then I was an impressionable lad with nothing more than a car and Pink Floyd's entire catalogue on CD to my name. More than any of Pink Floyd's other albums, ""The Wall"" is probably the one most suited to young people. Its themes of emotional and physical alienation, its strident antiestablishment views toward education, and its bleak condemnation of war resonate most with kids who think they can change the world. By the time you get a few years under your belt, by the time life wears you down a bit and makes you more accepting of the massive hypocrisy we all toil under, the album loses a bit of its luster. Don't get me wrong; ""The Wall"" is still one of the best rock operas ever created, and the movie is still worth watching.

The story, as though I even need to summarize it, concerns the tumultuous life of troubled rock star Pink (Bob Geldof). Here's a guy who has a whole host of ailments eating away at his soul. It would appear that being rich and famous, immensely talented, and the envy of millions everywhere isn't the type of life one would wish on their worst enemy. First of all, Pink's father perished in the ill-fated attempt to hold the Anzio beachhead in 1944, thus robbing our protagonist of a strong male influence during his childhood. With his father gone forever, Pink grew up under the stern gaze of his domineering mother, which shaped his outlook on future relationships with women. In fact, we see just how difficult it is for Pink to deal with females when he nearly murders a groupie during a rampage through a hotel room and in his growing distance from his pretty wife. Second, Pink didn't function well during his school days. His teachers at school mocked his penchant for writing song lyrics--from ""Dark Side of the Moon,"" no less!--and spent all of their time trying to break down his individualism so they could turn him into a faceless drone. Life is apparently quite tough in merry old England.

Don't worry, there are many more dilemmas our hero must deal with before he can tear down wall he built to keep people out so he can reconnect with humanity. The third major problem Pink deals with is his drug addiction, which has spiraled out of control and threatens to claim his life. He's so bad off that he spends most of his off time nodding off in a hotel room watching old war films on television while a cigarette burns to an ash between his fingers. He almost passes over to the other side at one point, but his manager (played by Bob Hoskins) manages to revive him just in time for his next concert performance. Finally (or fourth, whichever you prefer), it seems living the life of a rock star is eerily similar to a career as a fascist dictator. You can march on stage clad entirely in black, wearing an armband with a pair of crossed hammers on it, and preach to the adoring masses. You can order underlings to physically remove riffraff from the room, and send them out into the streets to wreak havoc on the decadent society. Yep, living on stage sure has its problems. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that Pink also undergoes several horrific hallucinations. Good grief! It's amazing most (but not all) of the conclusion is as redemptive as it is.

It's impossible to argue that ""Pink Floyd: The Wall"" isn't an amazing film. The sights and sounds seen in this movie stay with you for years afterwards: the Gerald Scarfe animation sequences, Geldof's creepy ability to portray a man completely detached from reality, and of course the music. Ahhh, the music! Pink Floyd went back into the studio to rerecord most of the songs, and even added a few more intriguing bits to the mix. It is in this film where one finds what is perhaps the most depressing Floyd song ever, the dirge ""When the Tigers Broke Free."" It's a heartbreaking tune describing the death of Pink's father (also Roger Water's father) at Anzio, and Pink's discovery of a form letter from the King of England, ""signed with his own rubber stamp,"" offering condolences to the family for the loss of his father. Soul shattering stuff even though the song probably would fit better on ""The Final Cut,"" the album that followed ""The Wall."" I could go and on with the mind blowing stuff in the movie. You definitely wouldn't want to watch this bleak film if you're feeling blue.

The best thing about ""The Wall"" coming out on DVD are the extras. The commentary track alone, with Gerald Scarfe and Roger Waters, is worth the price of the disc. We finally get to hear exactly what these guys were trying to accomplish with the film. We also get to hear Waters's astonishing admission that his only regret about the movie is that it doesn't contain any humor. Humor? In ""The Wall""? Imagine that! Fans of the greatest rock band in modern history must pick this one up posthaste. And if you haven't seen it, you don't know what you are missing.",1100217600,11,5425,4.561025641025641
412608,3,6301973461,"I first saw this in the theaters,saw it on video a couple of times, and recently picked up the DVD to see how I like it now. I also watched some of Alan Parker's films recently and wanted to see how this one stacked up against the others he's done since..

Alan Parker directed this film. I loved ""Angela's Ashes"", and as far as musical films go, he did it the best with ""The Committments"", also another favorite. ""Midnight Express"", ""Shoot The Moon"" and ""Fame"" are part of his credentials, all great films. This film I would put with Madonna's version of ""Evita"", or ""Angel Heart"", where you'll either love it or hate it. You could even make links to ""Birdy"" with ""The Wall"" in a way, as it deals with the effects of war, one from the view of a child, the other the view of a vet.

This film is notorious for watching it *ahem* ""chemically enhanced"", but I think that between the imagery and sound and ""storyline"", it'll disorient you anyway.

To sum it up, a British rock star has a breakdown and regresses into his childhood of cruel mothers, cheating wives and sadistic teachers, a growing detachment of the world he lives in as well as megalomania that a rock star has, which is shown as  potentially dangerous thing to have.  ""Pink"" (Sir Bob Geldof of Boomtown Rats and Live Aid fame) is a composite of Roger Waters, Syd Barrett as well as those who grew up in England post WWII.  A lot of cultural references are mentioned that might go over American's heads, but not too much. The actors are mostly British, except for the groupies, one of which is Jenny Wright from ""Near Dark"".

The animation by Gerald Scarfe is still great to watch.

Watch out for Joanne Whalley-Kilmer and Nell from ""Rocky Horror"" as the groupies, and Roger Waters in the wedding scene. Bob Hoskins is Pink's manager, unfortunatly not in it long enough. As far as Bob Geldof's performance goes, I liked it, but not sure if I felt much sympathy towards him.

As far as the extras go, you have commentary by Roger which does fill in some blanks but not much, but it does explain that Parker and Waters had a falling out early on (no surprise). You have a ""making of"" that shows the genesis of the film and some rare live Pink Floyd footage from 1980 that make it worth watching, and the original ""Another Brick in the Wall II"" promo video.

If you like Pink Floyd and ""The Wall"" in particular, it's an essential film. I think for those who have never seen it before, it'll be an unsettling film. But it sounds great, and the film looks great. If you're a Parker fan, you might think it's one of his lesser films. As far as musicals go, it's miles above ""Tommy"" and ""Sgt Pepper"", and more on the same level as ""Quadrophenia"", and less insane than ""Lisztomania"". It's  a ""must have"" as a cult classic.

I wouldn't be surprised if Roger decides to remake it one of these days though, esp. having mixed feelings about the film and with the news that Waters wants to take it to Broadway and do it as a stage musical. Supposedly they're also planning on making improvements on the live footage from 1980.",1099267200,7,3076,4.44404973357016
412609,4,6301973461,"The Story: Pink, the main character, has his father killed in the war. This depresses him and the memory becomes a brick in the Wall of many. His mother is overprotective, and he goes to a strict school,in which the schoolmaster embarreses him (he reads poetry which is actually lyrics from ""Money on ""DSOTM""). He never really gains a girlfriend until he is in his 30's. He becomes a rock star and gets married but he ignores his wife. She cheats on him, which becomes another brick in the wall. Things like this go on, until he goes insane, and shaves his cheast,facial, and regular hair(not to mention his eyebrows.)When his manager finds him out cold, they inject something into him which turns him into a neo-nazi leaderfor some odd reason. By the end, these nightmares become reality, and in his last dream, his is found guilty by the people in his life(the schoolmaster,his wife,mother ect.)and is sentenced to be exposed the his peers. The wall he has built around himself, is torn down. WHat actually happens to Pink at the end, and why children are sorting threw bricks and bottles is unclear, but the  viewer is probably meant to interperet his or her own ending.

It took me a few times too view the film and listen to the live album, to get it, and enjoy it. IT usualy takes me a few times to discover the real brilliance of it. THis film is sort of an anti-establishment type of film, but it can be viewed in many different ways. There is a storyline, even though there is very little diolouge.

GIve this film a chance to grow on you. I think it should be rated about pg-13, because of it's depressing theme, and graphic depiction of sex. If a 14-year old like me can understand a story as complex as this, then the people who claim there is no storyline, or you have to take drugs to understand it, should take another look, and listen carefully.

The Best moments:

The animation is certainly a highlight, but for some reason the part where Pink's school chums walk to the rail-road track, and one of them falls over into dirt, makes me laugh uncontrolably every time. Why didn't they do another take?

412610,5,6301973461,"Please, oh please, can we stop calling Pink Floyd The Wall an acid trip?  This movie is a masterpiece (my favourite movie, actually) created by a team of five particularly wonderful talents... among others.  First, there is Roger Waters, with his amazing lyrics and introspective musical themes that pull you in and direct your mind through the movie.  Obviously, Roger Waters and Pink Floyd deserve the most credit, but animator Gerald Scarfe and cinematographer Alan Marshall are the ones who created the beautiful, dream-like look of the movie.  Even if you hate Pink Floyd's music or the story of The Wall, you will be transfixed by the swirling, symbolic visions of Pink's dreams and nightmares (mainly nightmares).  Director Alan Parker was wise in making the decision not to add any dialogue (the entire movie is told in Pink Floyd's music with a few short phrases moving certain scenes along).  He also brings out the best in actor Bob Geldof, who plays Pink, the burned-out rockstar.  Although he has very few lines of dialogue, Geldof brings intensity into every moment of his screen time (he also does a wonderful impression of Waters's voice during the fascist rally scene near the end).  To say that this movie is merely a drawn-out music video or a film that can only be watched on drugs is to categorise it with the lowest common denominator in movies.  This is not a film meant for a casual Pink Floyd fan or a person who wants cheap escapism in a film.  It is a thinking film, an art film, that must be watched and listened to with complete attention.",1094083200,3,1568,4.731617647058823
412699,1,6301973461,"I like some of Pink Floyd's music and heard so many songs from the album that I finally decided to purchase and watch the video.  Roger Waters was wise in sticking to music and not going into the movie making business.

  This is a bizarre and completely incoherent saga of a self-absorbed rock star tortured by his past and going insane with his present situation.  You have to figure out for yourself what the plot is about, so bear with me while I attempt to interpret this thing.

  The main character, ""Pink Floyd's"" father was killed on a battlefield and he grows up with an over protective mother who tries to shield him from pain by starting to build a wall which Floyd adds to later on in life.  He attends a strict institutional school where a rigid schoolmaster ridicules his poetry in front of the class.  Later, as an adult, his wife, who he completely ignores, has an affair.  Floyd calls her when she is in bed with another guy and she hangs up on him, thus, another ""brick in the wall"".

  Throughout the movie, Floyd obsesses over these things and exaggerates them in his mind.  The school he attended becomes a factory where kids are transformed into faceless creatures and fed into a meat grinder.  An erotic cartoon plays in his head where two flowers are copulating and the female flower devours the male flower and turns into a monster.

  Floyd's present condition, a pampered, over-indulged rock star with screaming, demanding fans, groupies that throw themselves at him, and producers and promoters that leach off him drives him to insanity.  The wall which he has built to shut everything out becomes his biggest nightmare.

 In a fit of rage, he trashes his hotel suite and terrifies a young groupie then passes out from either an overdose or a mental breakdown.  His producers and promoters give him injections to revive him for the show which transform him into a psychopathic Hitler-type character with an army of skinheads for fans who try to take over the country.  Thus we have cartoons of mass destruction and goose-stepping hammers.

  Finally, Floyd, after bouncing back and forth from past to present and reality to fantasy, becomes a faceless naked creature trapped inside his wall with beastly cartoon characters trying to break in.  The wall blows up and the movie ends with children picking up the scraps.

  There are alot of tired, old anti-establishment themes from the late 60's throughout the movie but nobody has a real solution for anything.  It's also hard to identify with a narcissistic, self-absorbed prima dona who drives himself nuts.

In one scene, Floyd, as an adult, is curled up on his bed in a fetal position while asking his mother (in his mind) if ""They're going to drop the bomb"" or if she thinks his girlfriend/wife is  going to ""tear her little boy apart"".

  I often felt like reaching into the screen to slap this guy and tell him to get over it.

  It's hard to say if Bob Geldof, who plays ""Pink"" Floyd, is a good actor because he hardly says anything.  Most of the time his character is staring into space or into a TV screen trying to blot everything out.

  The best part of the movie is the imaginitive but weird animation.  This film displays the hedonistic narcissism of pop-rock culture.  It is very confusing and somewhat nauseating.",1093478400,9,3309,4.696335078534031
412700,5,6301973461,"What varied opinions of this movie. That's exactly what makes it so great!! People can have their different assumptions as to what they were aiming for when creating the film. I see a couple things that this movie could be metaphorically implicating.

 The first is basically what everyone else gets from it. All the problems he has faced in his life, all the bad experiences, have been bricks in the wall that he has built around himself. He has sheltered himself from the world, and has fallen into a deep depression.

 Another way of looking at this, is from a governmental or societal point of view. He is explaining how we are controlled. He shows you how we are told how to think and what to think. We have no freedom of choice. We think we do, but society's rules and thought patterns are still embedded in our head. ""We don't need no education, we don't need no thought control"". Everyone's face is the same at parts in the movie; a metaphor showing that we are not individual. ""All in all we are all just bricks in the wall"" we're nothing more than a brick in the wall called Society.

 There is definitely a point to this movie. There are several. Its just a matter of finding them.",1090972800,5,1192,4.444954128440367
412701,5,6301973461,"It seems to me that Roger Waters has us all fooled, that this was actually a parody of the highest order.  If you watch the interview with him on the bonus materials on the DVD, you can almost see him smile when he discusses the inspiration for this film.  It's a film that we read into it what we will.  To a small degree, it is autobiographical (most everyone knows about the incident when he spit on a fan during the Animals tour).
Taking that as a leaping off point, he takes the conclusion of the absurdity of the rock star life to its logical end.  And it is brilliant.  Pink Floyd was simply not the same after the breakup.
It is visually and viscerally stunning.  I used to watch this over and over again and it seemed to tap into what I was feeling at the time and it provided comfort, a sense that someone else could relate to the isolation and loneliness I felt, even in the midst of people.  I had to replace my vinyl record several times because I listened to it so much.  The movie provides eye candy for the songs.
The plot is quite simple: Pink ('by the way, which one's Pink?') is a rock star whose about had enough of the excess and snaps, journeying into his brain way too far.  We see the meltdown unfold and follow the transition to something much more frightening, gaining a vision of just how far human vanity can take us.  The songs and the visuals form a cohesive whole.
Sure it's pretentious and takes itself too seriously at times - but isn't that the point?  It works.
It's one of the darker takes on this life but it nails it brilliantly.  You'll find that many of the scenes are bigger than the context of the film.  Many of them could be related to events in the political or social sphere of then and today.
It's a bit dated, perhaps, or I've merely gotten older.  But the extras on the DVD make it worthwhile, including the video for 'Hey You' featuring footage that didn't make it into the film.",1088553600,6,1929,4.292817679558011

And to those who say the real life and animation do not comfortably coexist - I say ""rubbish !"" the transitions are smooth and seamless. My favorite part is when the school kids, with their faceless masks, are marched through the factory and into the grinder. Classic Pink Floyd. And I say Bob Geldof's portrayal of Pink is flawless. Buy this DVD - you won't regret it !",1087948800,3,737,4.23404255319149
412703,3,6301973461,"First off, let me say that this movie DOES have a plot. It shocks me that so many Pink Floyd fans would think that the movie is plotless. I would have thought that more Floyd fans would have either caught on or listened to other fans when they explain the plot. The movie is about a rock star named Pink who lost his father to the war while he was only a small child, dealt with an over protective mother all his life, had a failed marraige (mostly his own fault) and was also a rock star who abused the power he had over his audience, still a nice statement for the mindless sheep who follow a band blindly and become obsessed to the point of losing their own individuality. Pink began his career as a rock star to escape the every day Hell that he had to live with, one that haunted him for years.
That said, Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" was a ground breaking album and a step in rock and roll that HAD to be taken. A band like Pink Floyd had to exist so that they could inspire other bands (Tool and A Perfect Circle come to mind) to produce honest to God, good rock and roll with a heart and something real to say, rather then the mindless soulless corporate crap that clutters up the radio today. The character here builds up an emotional wall around him to guard his vulnerability, something that we've almost all been through at one point or another in our lives. Pink Floyd by all acounts were a revolutionary band, the first band to go the extra mile with their art and were wildly successful with it. Of course, this is just one reviewer's opinion, I've always understood a person's reason for not liking Pink Floyd. The band is not for everyone. Some don't want to be dragged along for over an hour, following a story with music. Some just want good tunes to blast in their car or headphones and that's understandable.
Down to the movie. It's more or less over an hour of music videos, before there were such a thing. The dialogue is the music which is more of a narration which could turn some people off. I personally would have loved to see a real movie with real dialogue because everything about The Wall is theatric. From the album to the stage show. Here, the music is the film and the scenes are the background. Reverse the rolls and you would have one Hell of a movie, in my opinion. Which is not to say that this movie is without it's good points. For instance, ""Another Brick in the Wall pt. 2"" is a great point in the movie. The maze to represent a school is brilliant and so are the kids being lead into a meat grinder. A great social commentary on crooked education, with teachers that revel in taking out their own problems on the kids they're paid to teach. ""Comfortably Numb"" is also another high point. There's too many videos to run through, so I'll just say that they vary from being great (Goodbye Blue Sky, The Trial, When the Tigers Broke Free), to just being ok (Young Lust).
The real shining star of this movie is Gerald Scarfe. His animations are AMAZING. ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" is really the high point of the movie, hands down. The symbolism is great and on point and gets the point across beautifully, more so then the regular scenes with actual acting. ""The Trial"" is also everything it should have been and more. (The judge is a butt with a face on it. How true is that?)
All in all (no pun intended), you should get this if you're a real Pink Floyd fan, who hasn't just heard a few songs here and there on the radio. You should also buy this if you've read all the reviews on here and have a good grasp on what you'll be spending your money on. This film is not for everyone. This is the type of movie where if you don't get it, you'll most likely just watch it once and never again. Maybe twice if you're thinking that you missed something that you should be getting. And if you do get it, it's a great experience that you'll dig out every now and than for a fun time. As depressing as the movie is, there is much positivity that lies beneath the surface. So many of us have the emotional wall around us that we really do need to break down in order to enjoy life, love and all the other adventures that the world has instore for us. You have to dig beneath the surface with this movie like much of Pink Floyd's work to get the concept. If nothing else, you can enjoy the music as it sounds better on this DVD than the album. There's also two new songs. The bonus features are rather plentiful, featuring the original documentary on the movie, a two part retrospective, the music video for ""Another Brick on the Wall pt. 2"", the ""Hey You"" scene (which was cut from the movie because Roger Waters thought it dragged the flim on too much but is actually quite great), the trailer, a still gallery and commentary by Roger Waters and Gerald Scarfe which is great and at times very funny. If nothing else, the bonus features may interest you.
If you'd rather experience The Wall in a different way and are interested in seeing just what the live shows for the album were like, I'd strongly suggest Roger Waters' ""The Wall: Live in Berlin"" DVD. It's a great DVD despite some stale guests here and there. A truly great thing to witness if you really love the album.
One love to all,
Kevin",1087862400,36,5216,4.312627291242363

412705,5,6301973461,"Despite what I've been reading from other reviews there is a story in this movie. You may have to watch it a few times to understand it because the movie jumps around in time a lot, but it's there.
This is the story of a boy, Pink Floyd, growing up in England after the war. His father was killed in the war so he is starved for male attention. At one point in the movie he tries to attach himself to some other kid's dad but is rejected. His mother is very over-protective. His schoolmaster at school is abusive and too strict. He grows up to become a rock star and eventually his wife leaves him for another guy because he's always too stoned to even acknowlege her. They are all bricks in his wall. Finally he just loses his mind and nearly kills himself and some groupie that came to his room. When he wakes up from this stupor he imagines himself a cold-hearted nazi leader reborn from a rotting corpse. Finally at the end of the movie he is sentensed in a ""trial"" to be exposed and his wall is destroyed so that he no longer has any place to hide. Thus his nervous breakdown is complete leaving him to pick up the pieces.
All of us have walls that we build up around ourselves. Some more than others depending on how open a person you are. We only let people see what we want them to see. That's what this movie is about. Imagine if all your deepest fears and secrets were completely exposed. You'd probably have a nervous breakdown too.
This movie doesn't follow a traditional chronological order so it's hard to follow and fit the pieces together. If you think of the beginning of the movie as the end and the rest of the movie as flashbacks you'll understand it better.
This is one of my favorite movies. I watch it every once in a while and am always amazed. It has possibly one of the best musical scores in history. The animated sequences are amazing with a lot of symbolism and pop art. Give it a try, especially if you like Pink Floyd's music.",1086739200,8,1957,4.291891891891892

412781,5,6301973461,"I don't get it...how can film critics continue to fail in their reviews of the conceptual film that so perfectly visualizes Roger Waters' utterly brilliant concept album ""Pink Floyd The Wall""?  Why can't they seem to appreciate a movie that all Pink Floyd fans I've ever known (including myself) find to be such a tremendous interpretation, albeit it at times an admittedly depressing one?
What we have is a character study of A Big Rock Star who could be anyone but is actually a combination of two former founding Pink Floyd bandmates, Syd Barrett and (project mastermind) Roger Waters.  The rock star (""Pink Floyd"", played by Sir Bob Geldof, pre-""Band-Aid"" and knighthood) has had a rather interesting life which is shown in flashback (and the occasional animated hallucinatory) sequence to World War II (where his father, like Roger Waters' own dad, was killed in action in Italy).  Awkward in childhood without a father (unusual in those days) and castigated by schoolmasters (at one time busted during class for writing ""poetry"" -actually the lyrics to the Floydian signature piece ""Money""), Pink eventually hits it big, marries...and then begins to lose control of it all, eventually leading to the meltdown that is occurring in...what is supposed to be a hotel room in the Hollywood Hills during yet another tour.
It's a bit mainstream to be considered an ""art flick"", but it has settled comfortably into ""cult flick"" status, deservedly so.  Roger Waters' original inspirations that led to the Wall"" album -increasing distance between the artists and their fans, alienation from societal institutions such as school, the death of a father Roger Waters never knew, the eventual insanity of close friend Syd Barrett- are all well-covered and simply enough portrayed so that subtle symbolism is never needed.  The movie stands as a perfect visual accompaniment to the album...and in fact is a bit broader, particularly considering the extra themes written for the flashback scenes involving Pink's father.
For me the best of the smorgasbord of extra features is the commentary track, if only to actually hear Roger Waters' input and insights (and his brilliant Irish accent when mimicking Bob Geldof).  Waters has a deserved reputation for being a bit reclusive when dealing with the media, so getting a chance to hear him discussing one of Pink Floyd's defining moments is particularly enjoyable for me as a Pink Floyd fan.  He DID make it a point to mention that he thought the film was a bit too dark and didn't reflect the humor that he felt was found throughout ""The Wall"" as an album.  I listened to ""The Wall"" again after hearing that comment and have yet to understand what the hell he was talking about.  If there's any humor in ""The Wall"" at all, I've never heard it.  It always seemed as brilliant and as heavy and darkly depressing as the movie is...which is probably why I've always liked the movie.  See it if you haven't.  If you've ever wondered what Pink Floyd was about, see this movie.  Like the band itself, you'll either love it passionately or you just won't get it at all.",1079740800,3,3100,4.915708812260537
412782,2,6301973461,"I rented this DVD last nite... I have been a major Pink Floyd fan for several months now, and ever since listening to the wall, I had wanted to watch the film. I say film, because it would be wrong to call it a movie. There is no traditional dialouge, its more like i gigantic music video.
I am torn as to whether or not I even like this film. I love the album, love the music, and love the lyrics, but this film destroyed what I had imagined the story looking like, and left me with a very odd feeling.
At times I thought this film was wonderful, yet at the end of it I literally felt like I was gonna throw up in the bathroom. Certain images were spectacular, like the ""Another Brick In The Wall, pt. 2"" scene. ""Run Like Hell"", however, was a bit too much for me to take, especially with the graphic depiction of a woman being raped by one of Pink's footsoldiers after he beats up the woman's boyfriend. This was not the only sexually explicit scene in the movie, for as any fan of the album knows, there is a whole section on dirty women... lots of breasts in that scene, and not to mention the hardcore depiction of Pink's cheating slut of a wife screwing her boyfriend.
The best parts of the movie were the animated ones, and for the live segments, Bob Geldof is perfect for the role with his satanically-good looks during the ""In The Flesh"" sequences, but as a whole I would not recommend this movie to anyone, and if they do see it, they should be prepared to be disturbed.",1079395200,6,1480,4.23321554770318

412784,5,6301973461,"As a long time Pink Floyd fan, I saw this film for the first time on its opening night.  The crowd was packed, noisy; mostly teens, early twenty-somethings, they expected a concert film.  I was lucky to see it in one of the last truly large screen houses while it was in its prime.  I was initially concerned by the talking and laughing of the sold-out crowd.  Soon, there was no worry.  It was the quietest full house I've ever been in.  I looked around at one point about ten minutes into the movie.  Mesmerized.  Mouths open, no laughing, no talking, no popcorn eating.
Why an anecdote instead of a review?  That's the most pointed thing I could say.  No other movie has so grabbed an audience, defied their expectations, and held them in thrall like Pink Floyd The Wall.
3 strong personalities collided:  Roger Waters, Alan Parker, and Gerald Scarfe.  By all rights, it should have been a mess.  Amazon reviewer calls it a fascinating failure.  There is nothing failing here.  The narrative works on a number of levels.  The paranoid rock star who sees himself as a fascist youth leader is only one of the more superficial.

412875,5,6301973461,"I am not a person that would normally be inclined to watch a movie such as this.  Music just is not my favorite thing.  There are people out there who love music, spend a lot of money on it, and know every important song from every decade. Whatever.  Me, I listen to music when I feel like it, and expend no more effort than that.  I rarely buy an album, and I normally listen to talk radio.
So why on Earth would I like this movie so much?  It's simple; it's an entertaining movie that symbolizes the struggle within men to make sense of their existence.  The Wall is the semi-autobiographical story of Roger Water's life.  Made from the musical album that shares it's name, The Wall takes us through the ups and downs of a fictionalized rock star (representing Roger Waters) and explains the difficulty of losing a parent at a young age, shows the pain of having an overprotective mother, and numerous other elements to life.
Finally, this movie is entertaining.  For a movie that lacks a lot of dialogue, and is just based on symbolizing the aspects of the album it's based on, The Wall does not bore.  I say this movie is easily worth the price of admission.",1076803200,,1162,4.443396226415095

There are many fine acts:
1. A little boy is sitting and writing poem on the classroom where is a cruel teacher who takes his poem and reads it for other students. Little later we can see cartoon part where teacher puts his students on the slaughter.
2. Main character is sitting on the chair and his girlfried triess to make him happier without no result. Suddenly, man gets a rage disease. He brokes television, curtais, quitars, window and so on. Finally he gets a big wound and his hand is bleeding.

The shots are brilliantly composed and thought of, and flow consistently throughout the film. Some of the most appealing shots are at the beginning of the film and one of the most artistic scenes of all time can be found through the flow of the main characters insanity being interlaced within the boy running across the field and away from the mental patient.
In terms of actual appeal and plot, The Wall is actually quite decent until the ending (at the approaching of the trial). Unfortunately if you don't appreciate the music of Pink Floyd it is very unlikely that you will appreciate this film, seeing as it is composed to the music of their ""rock opera"" album, The Wall. It is very likely that if you are not a Pink Floyd enthusiast you will maintain interest past the first half hour and the events will seem pointless and not organized very well.

I'm sorry to anyone who disagrees, but I think that this movie is amazing and Roger Waters is a genius.  Bob Geldof was awesome in this role and I really liked the little kid who played him as a child.  The movie is basically an analysis of how we build a figurative wall around ourselves to block out the world which everyone, like it or not, can relate too.  The movie is insane, it doesn't stay put or follow the conventional setup of how we think a movie should be done, very much like Pink who is basically going crazy.  It was a very imaginative and creative venture.  Pink Floyd's The Wall makes you pay attention to what's going on, you get wrapped up in trying to figure out what exactly is happening and I must admit it can be confusing at times but it's well worth the trouble.  The music really adds another dimension to the movie that you don't normally get with dialog.  And of course, Pink Floyd is super-cool and amazing, so the music is very beautiful and full of life and vivid emotions.  The animation is just incredible it flows in an odd fluid sort of way, it seems very different from what you normally see.

It is so important to add that Gerald Scarfe,a prominent cartoonist, played a great role on making this movie a huge success.

Never had I pictured Roger Waters' life being soo immense. This movie helped me understand why Pink Floyd writes the way they do. This record blew me away along with the movie. It's one long story on Waters' life. The music from the Wall fitted perfectly with the movie word for word.

413005,5,6301973461,"Contrary to popular belief, The Wall (movie) is about the life of original Floyd guitarist/vocalist/lyrical mastermind Syd Barret. The movie stars ""Pink"", the receding rock star, who is slipping into insanity and slowly losing control. This is a DIRECT reference to Syd Barret, who was diagnosed with schitzoprenia and was asked to leave Pink Floyd in 1969 because while performing he would either play a completly different song thean what was being played, would not play at all, or not even show up at the performances. after Syd left, they hired David Gilmoure to fill in for him. By the way, for those of you who still have an old turntable lying around, play the song on The Wall ""Empty Spaces"" backwards to reveal a hidden message. for those who don't, the message says ""congragulations! you have found the hidden messsage. please send your reply to 'Original Pink, Care of the funny farm, Lancaster."" This is referring to Syd Barret.",1047945600,,941,4.8875
413006,5,6301973461,"I am stunned by any review that claims this film is a failure in any way.  Director Alan Parker wisely puts the famous soundtrack up front, and rarely interrupts it with any dialogue at all.  In fact, most of the dialogue is also found on the double-LP set that inspired the film, back before CDs were the prevalent form of musical media.
This film and accompanying music are an attempt to explain and understand the rise and fall of Syd Barrett, original founder of Pink Floyd, a mentally unstable young man who unfortunately indulged in mind-altering drugs and is now out of touch with reality.  According to band members, Barrett lives in a house in a small town in England, is cared for by friends and family, and occasionally leaves his house and makes a sad, public spectacle of himself in one way or another.  The equally classic ""Dark Side Of the Moon"" LP is another glorious musical collection that focuses on the kind of madness that Barrett sunk into, although ""The Wall"" is more specific and oriented around one individual.
In any event, the film begins with the birth of ""Pink"" and the death of his father in WWII, follows briefly through his childhood with a smothering mum, abuse at the hands of cruel schoolmasters and the British education machine, and into his adulthood as the leader of a successful rock band.  He slowly loses his mind, relating his fame and the fans' mania toward him to a Hitler/Nazi type of self-image, and the imagery fits the music and theme perfectly.
It is impossible to listen to ""The Wall"" the same away after seeing the film.  Its occasional dark humor and generally dark characterization are ultimately shattering to the viewer who is paying attention, and that's the point.  Parker & the Floyd did a fabulous job of translating the subject matter to film, which is something nearly impossible to do.  Be warned:  It is not an ""upper.""  You will be bummed at the conclusion of the film.  But then, Pink Floyd has never been known for happy themes.",1046822400,,1995,4.687679083094556

I am however compelled to log a complaint about the DVD.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound track is inferior to the PCM stereo track on this DVD.  The 5.1 track is not as crisp overall, with the surround channels being particularly noisy.  This finding really surprised me, but despite numerous adjustments and listenings I find the PCM stereo track to be much more enjoyable.
On a positive note, the PCM stereo track is still better than most DVD movies.  The PCM track invokes a full 3-D sound -- you will still hear artillary shells zipping over your head, and feel the crashing down of The Wall.  I possess THX-certified components and am experienced with 5.1, so I don't think I'm having a technical issue.  Additionally, I have heard this same problem with a friend using a different disk and audio rig.
Please Roger, we need a new 5.1 remastering of The Wall !!!",1045008000,,1121,4.6313131313131315

While the video was much plagued with noise in the soundtrack, this DVD is much cleaner in all 5.1 channels of sound.  Although I am unable to comment on any aspects of the video (being blind) I am asured that it meets the standards of this format.  A word to blind purchacers of this disk, the menues are accessed without using the enter key on your remote as is common for DVDs.  To access a menue choice. use the up arrow keys to enter a selection.  the only difficulty I have with this DVD is the commentary.  An Anti war theme is much to prevalent threw out, and it is not as technically informative as I would have wished for; however, if you can get past the rampent liberalism with which this commentary drips, you'll find a movie which is nice and dark and very enjoyable:  if only for the music alone.  Now, the 5.1 channel sound is just great on this film.  The center channel is not used except for what very few speaking parts there are and a few lead vocals.  The suttle use of the saround channels is quite effective.  There is no doubt that anyone who purchaces this DVD will enjoy it very much!!!",1043539200,,1254,4.244725738396625

The lighting, cinematography, and animation are all excellent. The songs are all perfectly tuned to the action on screen. Its all about an imaginary rock star by the name of Pink Floyd. His psyche has been damaged through years of over protection, abuse, and trauma. His way of dealing with it is to construct a ""wall"" to hide himself behind.

413083,2,6301973461,"Ever since his departure from Pink Floyd, Roger Waters (bassist and principle songwriter for the album and much of the band's '70's material) has used every source of media to reignite the fortunes he made from the 1979 blockbuster ""The Wall."" From books to live stage adaptions, Waters has yet to let go. Few of these ""revivals"" have been as successful, and 1982's film adaption of the hit record may be why.
Combine Pink Floyd's ""The Wall""--a smash hit--with an acclaimed two year tour and add a somewhat relentless visionary--Roger Waters, and a silver screen adaption is guaranteed. But ""The Wall"" movie was not to be well received with the critics. Director Alan Parker describes it as ""one of the most miserable experiences"" of his directing career...a fine director being wasted on an ego-trip like this is definitely one of the elements of the film's lack of luster. For anyone who is familiar with the album, the movie is undeniably predictable, with each scene following the songs to a T, and adding nothing new or redeeming, except Gerald Scarfe's stark animation, one of the few highlights. Bob Geldof portrays the depressed rock star that the story follows, and gives the viewer nothing to appreciate, doing little but staring into space, throwing an occasional tantrum, and a bit of singing and screaming. The sequences for the songs 'Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)' and 'When the Tigers Broke Free' are nice enough but would have done better has promos.
Had this movie been...well, an actual movie instead of a somewhat uninspired two hour promo for the album, it would have fared slightly better. There is a limit of dialogue in the film. Though a few scenes do contain spoken parts, they're usually taken straight from the album (for example, the scene with the American groupie who finds herself in the middle of yet another one of ""Pink""'s unprovoked, pointless tantrums), except for the scene with the wicked schoolteacher (though even that sequence takes a line from Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon"" album). This is definitely one of the things that limits the depth of ""The Wall"" film. One other major mistake is the dimension of the main character, Pink--at least the album had music to create a surrounding atmosphere and explanation for his severe isolation, but the film only tells us this is a man whose father died, had an overprotective mother, married a harlot, and became a big rich famous rock star...and shows us such a severe dementia that the viewer will wind up concluding that Pink is just a crybaby whose anger is unfounded. Yet the biggest mistake overall is that Roger Waters forgets that he's a songwriter, not a screenwriter. Perhaps Alan Parker should have hired a professional who was unfamiliar with the album, and only given a copy of the lyrics. Surely they would have refrained from delving into their own ego, as does Waters. Long story short, ""The Wall"" film is one long music video, adding no dimension or depth to the characters or story.",1027728000,7,2998,4.857421875

Pink surrounds himself with objects both mentally and physically due to harsh pains in his past that are told in glimpsing flashbacks.
The Wall is not for people who must have an immediate answer for everything they are seeing. It will probably take time, and  piecing together after it's seen. If you don't like to dive deep into psychotic images of gritty moments, this may not be for you. But I thought it was great for a study!

The animated scenes include a very vivid portrait of war (bombings symbolized quite astonishingly by an enormous bird of prey clawing up chunks of the english countryside), the building of the wall (this is just an awesome scene all together), and the trial (complete with a stunning array of characters symbolizing a prosecutor, a judge, his school teacher, his wife, and his mother).  The film is one of the most visually arresting ever made, and it uses only the lyrics and music of Pink Floyd to advance what little true plot it has.  But it wouldn't particularly matter if the movie had a plot or not.  This is a film about images, and very vivid images at that.  Some are funny, most are cruel and unforgiving (the young Pink walking through the bombed out trenches in search of his father).  This is a movie that just has to be seen.",1009584000,3,1382,4.5894308943089435
413188,5,6301973461,"The Wall is a great movie about the pink floyd bassist and leader (at that time) Roger Waters. It's a non-linear movie, really hard to understand, full of metaphors. It was made in the 70's and it discusses lots of actual themes. The only problem of this movie is that it's too much non-commercial, what makes lots of people to not like it...
It's like nothing i've ever seen. It's an album made to be a movie and a movie made to be an album; by that you can imagine the sync between images and sounds.
The treatment of the images is really damn good. The contents of the DVD is really amazing too. Of course, for those who like Pink Floyd, the dvd is even better.
It's really worth to spend the money.",1008201600,,702,4.246268656716418
413189,5,6301973461,"I first saw PINK FLOYD-THE WALL at a friend's house about ten years ago. I saw it again on cable a few years later. Although I have not seen it in 5-6 years, I have never forgotten most of it.  It is more than just memorable, though: it still gives me chills when I just think about it. (Boy, it's getting kind of chilly in here right now!)
I have to disagree with the editorial reviewer: sure, this is probably one of the most depressing films ever made (which is why I can only watch it in a certain mood), and it IS relentlessly bleak, but that was obviously what was intended in the first place. I also don't think that this film lost any of the humor from Roger Water's lyrics; just watch the ""Young Lust"" scene with the girls in the police station!
This isn't a film where plot really matters, anyway: it is a film about images, emotional feelings (namely alienation), and style. PINK FLOYD-THE WALL is not so much a movie as it is (as described above) an ultrasensory and visceral experience, and it does succeed very well as pure entertainment.  Many of the live-action scenes are cool, and the animation sequences are nothing short of brilliant and mesmerizing. Leonard Maltin describes this as the ""longest rock video to date"" but that is a simplistic description. You do not have to ""be high"" to enjoy this film; I wasn't on either occasion when I saw it.
Director Alan Parker did a wonderful job in taking on the very difficult task of visualizing Pink Floyd's THE WALL, the album. Boomtown Rats singer (and eventual Band-Aid and Live-Aid organizer) Bob Geldof makes a striking film debut in the title role of Pink Floyd, a rock star who becomes increasingly alienated from everything around him until he just breaks. The resulting film is entertaining, disturbing, and definitely earns its ""R"" rating--it is not for any child under the age of 15, or even 16. In the almost twenty years since PINK FLOYD-THE WALL was first released, neither its power nor its stature has diminished. Just look at the fact that this is the 185th review written of it on these pages!  Obviously, this incredible film still provokes thought and discussion today, every bit as much as it did in 1982.  I can't wait to get it on DVD--look, it's in my Wish List! :)",1007510400,5,2254,4.558024691358025

Additional features are only mildly interesting, and listening to interviews with Roger Waters interesting but not really enlightening.
Listening to the ""Directors"" audio track is disappointing, as the director isn't on it.  It is just Roger Waters and the animator, who, as it seems, weren't involved enough to have any interesting incites.  Conversations break down in to unrelated tangents about the cycle of child abuse and safety of public parks, punctuated by the occational ""oh, hold on.  This is the part I did.""  Ultimately, having the film nararated by two people that haven't watched the film in 20 years was perhaps not the best idea.
Again, I believe that the film is a masterpiece, but the supporting content isn't up to snuff.  Maybe they should have waited a couple of more years until everybody involved in the production was on speaking terms again.",1006560000,7,1040,4.948275862068965

""pink"" is a character that none of us want to know, but i do believe that we all have seen some of him in ourselves, whether its thur self doubt, feeling left out and alone, or simply misunderstood. his father dying when he was just a boy, his mother smothering him beyond belief, his teacher abusing him verbally, becomming very ill and then the loss of his one true love, vera lynn.....these are all of the things that create the wall. in the beginning, its a protection and a very much needed instrument, but eventually, it becomes a burden and its only thru his realization of that burden that he is able to break free of it.
for anyone that has seen this movie once and loved the music, but didn't understand the movie, watch it again. if nothing more, you'll enjoy the music, but maybe....just maybe you'll understand more than before about that fine line between the sane and insanity.",995673600,7,1357,4.388888888888889
413253,5,6301973461,"I have listened to The Wall's sound track many, many times while I've been working on the computer and wondered what the full film would be like. I came to Amazon looking first off for the sound track on CD so I could hear all the track but found the DVD was actually less. I live in the UK so having it mailed here would take time and cost more, in total the film was a bit over ... I think. I was worried I wouldn't like it and I'd be wasting my money. It arrived 6 !days! before it was meant to, to my suprise. Initially I couldn't get it working because I was using a player on my computer that didn't support the US region on the disc. I watched the film the morning I got it in bed and thought it was one of the best I've seen, my number one film being Blade Runner. It is FAR from being a normal film, it follows no real obvious plot apart from how Pink is driven mad. I had no problems with the music sound levels at all. My only complaint is that it's not long enough, even though it's about as long as a normal film. The film is not really about Fashism or the Nazi's. You will need to be able to think to understand some of the points in it which are not made bluntly like in other movies. Pink is driven mad as he remembers how he's been treated and what people do to each other over time and what happens to people who try to care. The Wall is the wall he builds against people remembering all these things until he eventually turns into the steriotypical Nazi who doesn't care anymore. This film made me think quite hard and it's well worth spending your money on. It is not a happy film at all, it's not meant to be. It's full of weird bits of animations which really do look like they've just come direct from someone's imagination. I suppose it's a bit more like a musical than a film as there are very few parts of it which are not backed by music. The CD has interviews with Roger Waters and the rest of the people who produced the film as well as video clips of the promotional video and things. It's good to see a film of this quality coming from the UK as I've become very used to every film coming from the US. Move back up the page and click buy.",995673600,,2170,4.025462962962963

So, I was in blockbuster, lookin for horror movies when I stumbled on it. I got it not knowing what to expect.

THE WALL truly is Floyd's greatest and best next to DARK SIDE on the shelf the best Rock n' Roll albums ever, and there are a few (But the Floyd certainly holds a lasting spot on it). The wonderful thing is that THE WALL can be interpreted in many different ways. Because of that, everything in the movie and album means something, from the smallest visual element, to the slightest musical hint. Floyd as well as the filmmakers of THE WALL have truly created a rock masterpiece. The story of Pink and his WALL applies to us all with its theme of hiding our pain by surrounding ourselves with a WALL built by our own two hands, blood, and pain.

The picture quality of the deleted ""Hey You"" scene is very poor ... the film was obviously heavily damaged. It's watchable, though, and interesting. All in all, though, it doesn't add anything to the movie, so it's understandable that it was cut out.
The subtitles display the song lyrics and most of the background dialogue (such as the lyrics to ""The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot"" (the Vera Lynn song playing very quietly at the beginning) and the dialogue on the TV that Pink is watching). It would have been nice to have Pink's ranting, difficult to understand, megaphone speech during ""Waiting For the Worms"" subtitled, but no such luck.
If you don't listen to the whole commentary, at least listen to it during the ""Is There Anybody Out There?"" segment. Roger Waters goes off on a strange, Monty Python-ish tangent ... it's very funny, especially when placed up against the humorless movie.

413348,4,6301973461,"I was a Pink Floyd fan throughout my younger years, but The Wall to me
is still one of the most wonderfully well-produced albums of all time.
I must have seen this film in the theater over 20 times during my high
school years.  And now, seeing and hearing this film on DVD has
'remastered' my appreciation for this entertaining visual and audio
experience.  At first sight, the graphics work on the package and the
disc itself is attractive.  the animated flowers are beautifully
portrayed on the disc.  The inner pamphlet is a simple mini poster,
with movie and DVD credits.  I was hoping for a little more to read,
but I guess not this time.  I popped the DVD into my player and was
immediately introduced to the main menu. You have 4 choices....the
movie, the extra features, scene/song selection and audio selection.
Let's first talk about the audio selection, titled ""Set The
Controls"".  You have a choice of 5.1 surround and PCM stereo
surround.  **TECHNICAL NOTE-If your DVD player has 3D sound
enhancement, you must turn this off for this disc.  Having that
feature on will lower the sound quality from this disc** You also have
a ""system set up"" choice.  It gives you specific sound tests
and directions on volume and surround elements.  A nice addition, kind
of like the THX optimode on other discs, but slightly different.  The
next menu button is titled ""Any Title You Like"".  Under
this, you get to choose subtitles if you wish.  Your choices are
Spanish, French or English.  You get to choose scenes by song, of
course.  Unfortunately, these choices are only numbered, there are no
descriptions of the scene or the song.  So, it may take a few tries to
find an individual scene.  You also have a choice to watch the film
with the song lyrics below the picture.  This is pretty cool. It
reminded me of those ""Pink Floyd Karaoke Parties"" that I
never went to!  Anyway, it would probably be taken more seriously to
those not too familiar with the lyrics.  The final button, titled
""A Soucerful of Features"", contain all the supplemental
material.  You have your choice of two documentaries, titled ""The
Other Side"", ""Retro Part One"", and ""Retro Part
Two"".  ""The Other Side"" is a piece produced around the
time The Wall was released, and it's great to watch.  There is a lot
of behind the scenes footage.  ""Retro Part One and Two"" are
recent documentaires containing rather new interviews with Roger
Waters, Alan Parker and others who worked on the film.  Both of these
documentaires are fascinating because it is well known (to fans), that
Roger and Alan had very different views as to what the film is about!
A lot of behind the scenes stories and information.  They are put
together very well and a pleasure to watch!  You also have the choice
of watching the film with commentary by Roger Waters and Gerald Scarfe
(animation).  These commentaries have great behind the scenes
information throughout the film.  Roger Waters is especially a
pleasure to listen to because he laughs (which is rare), and he gives
the commentary a more personal experience since the film is
semi-autobiographical.  He even mentions a story about Syd Barrett
(the founder of Pink Floyd).  This commentary is outstanding.  The
final piece of supplemental material is when you click a button titled
""Oddities"".  These pieces of supplemental material include
the trailer, photographs from the movie set, paintings from the film,
a music video of ""Another Brick in the Wall-Part 2"", and a
sequence of the song ""Hey You"" that was not in the final cut
of The Wall.  That's all the supplemental material...well worth it
too!  The only two complaints I have are these buttons that you can
press that give you 10 second sound bites from the film, and the
slowness of the menus.  After you select something, you need to watch
10 seconds of video before you are allowed to make your next choice.
Menu design and graphics is pretty good, but should be MUCH faster.
OK, so I watched the film and the high definition transfer is
incredibly beautiful.  Colors are deeply saturated with a sharp
picture and wonderful clarity.  The transfer is very impressive!
Sound quality is a mixed bag.  The production track sounds dated, not
too much range but not at all annoying, just noticeable.  The music is
unbelievable!  The soundtrack was remastered from the ORIGINAL MASTER
TAPES.  If you've never heard The Wall on a surround sound system, you
are in for a big treat.  The music sounds almost perfect, with some
hiss, but nothing to complain about.  There were times I heard
instruments that I didn't remember from the album....incredibly clear,
wonderfully recorded music.  I can't say enough about the musical
soundtrack, it comes alive on DVD.  Pink Floyd never sounded better!
In conclusion, I recommend this DVD to EVERY Pink Floyd fan, and to
those who want to hear a unique, musical experience and watch a
beautifully photographed film.  I must add that the animation is
absolutely wonderful.  Gerald Scarfe has included his great creativity
throughout the film!  The disc loses points ONLY for its slow menu
navigation.  Other then that, Pink Floyds The Wall on DVD is
wonderful.  Tons of extra footage, a beautiful transfer and
unbelievable sounding music.  A great DVD to own whether you live
inside or outside the wall!  Enjoy!",973728000,273,5311,4.816371681415929

The music and animation in this movie are  powerful and touching. This is all about society and its impact on humanity  -- as it becomes larger, each human becomes smaller. This can have even  greater effect on those who see themselves as sacrificial victims of  society (in Pink's case because he lost his father, his socially-opressive  schooling, and his pandering to the masses of fans).

In this film, everything is where it is for a reason.  The story is wonderful. I believe that it is something everybody can  relate to.  Building up an emotional wall to attempt to combat the horrible  things that occur in all of our lives, and the trauma that comes with the  building of this wall.  There is so much more to it than that though.  So  many references, so much deep symbolism in every scene.  Some anti-war,  anti-establishment undertones.

I feel to this day that it is the greatest rock album ever made.  The interpretation onto the  screen is, to me, fairly accurate.  A few years later, when the movie was  released on video, I again saw it.  This time it was at a party in my home  where certain illegal substances had been inhaled. This time, it was as if  I'd seen the movie for the first time. I was able to see the movie in an  all new perspective. In my drug/alcohol-induced stupor, I saw images that  were totally indescribable.  The animation seemed to come virtually alive.  The movie spoke to me like no other ever has to this day. Whenever I have  watched this movie ""straight"", it seems rather dull, however  under the influence, it takes on a whole new life of its own, and never  seems to tell the same story twice.  The rock culture and the drug culture  grew to the point where they intermingled together to become one and the  same.  This movie exemplifies that intermingling.  Therefore to interpret  this movie is nearly impossible, because like the effects of mind altering  substances and music, no two people are necessarily affected in the same  way.

Pink's childhood was a  traumatic one, his father died in W.W.2 and was raised by an over  protective mom and was beaten by his school teacher.  Later he became a  rock star and got married to a wife that cheated on him.  The movie shows  how Pink completes his ""wall"" that he started as a kid.

One such scene shows an  anmated dove exploding into a german eagle or a British flag collapsing to  make a bloody cross during the song ""Good bye blue sky"".  It's  amazing soundtrack will have a firm grip on you as you watch.  The high  ammount of symbolism will also keep you thinking.

In fact, due to the horrifying content of the movie, I would not recommend watching this movie  on acid.  The fact that people hold such silly beliefs about this movie  only confirms the notion held by Roger Waters, Pink Floyd's then-front man  and the author of the script, that no matter how clearly you tell a story,  most people are just not bright enough or well-educated enough to  understand it.  Basically, the Wall is a very thrilling, extremely  disturbing music video that has an actual plot.  The plot concerns the  trials and tribulations of rock star Pink Floyd.  Most of the scenes are  anything but ""trippy.""  The character Pink is a combination of  both Waters and original Floyd front man, Syd Barrett, who was forced out  of the group because he went insane, a condition some blamed on his heavy  use of hallucinogens.  If anything, this film is a statement against drugs.  I have no problem with people who don't like this film because they  believe it to be heavy-handed and self-serving, but if you hate it because  you don't understand it, that's only because you don't understand the  background of Pink Floyd.  Even people who despise this film -- including  those who are confused as to what it's about -- will admit that the  animation (which makes up maybe a quarter of the film) is amazing.  Though  this film does nothing to negate the widespread view of Waters as an  eccentric egomaniac, it is an ultimately moving journey of personal loss,  fame, insanity, and vulnerability.  There are two sequences that I have to  admit sickened even me.  One involves Pink turning into a worm, which isn't  half as bad as the scene in which he shaves off his nipples.  Other than  those two disgusting moments, the Wall has a number of memorable scenes  complimented by the classic album of the same title.

  This movie is not a collection of videos to go with the  famous album The Wall written by Roger Waters and David Gilmore.

413467,4,6301973461,"Alan Parker's film ""Pink Floyd The Wall"" visualizes the offbeat, yet brilliant album by the band. The album's basic focus is alienation, and the film does an excellent job at showing that. It follows the life of a  famous rock singer, named ""Pink"", who has a nervous breakdown and  becomes isolated from society. He literally builds a wall around himself,  and the movie focuses on how he deconstructs the wall, brick by brick.  The film's first 30 minutes or so don't make any sense, and that may  draw the viewer away from the film. There are many flashbacks that at first  seem unimportant and senseless, but are fully explained later. Still, after  the film, many scenes remain unclear and do not make sense.  With  that said, this is a visual masterpiece. The animation mixed with the real  life gives the viewer a feeling of isolation, and paranoia almost, taking  us into the mind of the isolated rock star. When I first saw the film, I  was just getting introduced to the great band, Pink Floyd, and I still  thouroughly enjoyed this film. Now that I know a lot about the band's  music, this film will be better next time around.

True, it's not exactly the most uplifting and cheerful movie ever made, but  even if you see it just once in your whole life, you will remember it  always.
Basic plotline:  Rockstar Pink (semi-autobiographical embodiment  of Roger Waters, Pink Floyd's bassist, vocalist, and chief songwriter) has  had a rough childhood, a rocky marriage, a few too many pills, and few too  many gigs.  So, to cope, he sits in a hotel room in front of a TV showing  English WWII movies and slowly loses touch with reality through flashbacks,  paranoia, and nightmarishly surreal animation by Gerald Scarfe (these bits  are my favorites!).  There is very little dialogue, as the movie serves as  little more than a ninety-minute music video of the 1979 masterpiece album  of the same name.
The cool thing about the DVD (besides finally getting  to see the footage intended to accompany the song ""Hey You"" which  was deleted by Waters himself), is the audio commentary provided by Waters  and Scarfe, who actually (gasp!) TALK ABOUT THE MOVIE!  So many of the  DVD's I've seen with this feature simply let the director, or whoever's  talking, ramble on about politics or people they met while writing another  movie altogether while a scene that you would have loved to have some of  their insight to is playing...ARRRRGH!  Here, the rather witty duo  explain each scene's meaning, inception, and even trivia bits like trick  camera work.  There's a hilarious Mystery Science Theater 3000-ish bit of  goofing around on Waters' part during the ""Is There Anybody Out  There?"" sequence that was very surprising.  I expected these guys,  especially Waters, to be stuffy and dismal, considering the movie.
Secret  trick by the way:  the DVD has a LOT of interactive menus, and on all of  them, save for the into/main menu, if you push the ""9"" on your  remote, it will acitvate a different sort of sound byte.  Nothing real  exciting, but kind of amusing.

Cut (Oliver Stone shows you all kinds of stuff you might never have  noticed about the film).  Clerks (Kevin Smith and members of the cast,  including a very intoxicated Jason Mewes).

First of all, the music on this movie is spectacular and is the absolute best quality on DVD.  The video quality is also very  good.  This film descriptively explains The Wall alblum by Pink Floyd as  well as the intended story: all those background noises, lyrics, and moods  come to life in this film.  It has so much symbolism, euphemism, and other  underlying meanings. I could sit for hours explaining scenes with their  hidden and obscure meanings from it. This film also has great visuals. Many  crowd shots, much creativity, and the use of many different people. There  is also animation that is very very cool. Lots of euphemisms there.  The  drawings really help explain the story and deliver the message better than  actual people could. This movie is so cool and is even better since I love  Pink Floyd. For anyone willing to watch a different kind of movie and  listen to great music at the same time. This film made my emotions and  senses fluctate very frequently. One moment I was scared, another  mesmorized, one I was very pleased, another I was in disgust. It's a movie  worth seeing, and it's so awesome on DVD, high quality sound & picture.

I also strongly reccomend  that you also have a copy of Pink Floyd's amazing Album ""The  Wall."" One cannot be a substitute for the other.

The whole ""Hey  You"" and ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" sequences are brilliant, filling  me with buried emotions. As did ""Vera/Bring the Boys Back Home"",  which in my opinion is the pentacle of Roger Waters power as a songwriter  (that's my opinion).  I also love the scene where young ""Pink""  takes bullets of his father's and places them on the railroad tracks.
There are several tidbits of goodies here, as well.  For instance, did  anybody else out there catch ""Pink"" reading poems that were  actually lyrics found later in ""The Final Cut"" and ""The Pros  and Cons...""?  Or, does anybody else actually know who Vera Lynn is?  I do.  I actually researched it in high school (very sad).
Finally, I  rented this movie on numerous occasions just to hear ""When the Tigers  Broke Free"" and the longer, better version of ""Empty Spaces""  (both songs are written in the sheet music book ""The Wall"" that I  have).  ""Tigers"" is such a good song, wow.

The visuals are stunning  and the music breathtaking.  The film is one of the most underated ever if  not the MOST.
THE EXTRAS
Their are some great extras on this DVD  release.  The interactive menus are brilliant with shots of the film  playing in the background.  This is also where the secret buttons come into  play.  In the corner of each screen you will see a picture in a box.  If  you press your number nine key it will play some music from the part of the  film shown in the box.
Their are two documentaries on the DVD.  One is  old - 'The other side of the wall' this was made during the film and shows  some back stage footage, it is quite informative, but dosen't look very  good.  'Retrospective' is a new documentary made especially for the DVD.  It is a lot better than the other one.
Their is also the 'Another Brick  in the wall part 2' video, which to be honest is a bit rubbish.  The  trailer is also included as is the 'Hey you' film footage, (This is the  unseen footage, it is not inserted into the film).  The footage is quite  interesting to watch although a lot of it was actualy re-edited into the  film. The commentary from Roger Waters and Gerald Scarfe is fabulous.  It  is very interesting to hear what they think about the film.  It also sheads  some light on the scenes that you may just have misinterpreted.
Also  included are some pictures of cartoons drawn by Gerald Scarfe, and some  photos from production.  You also get four lobby cards.  All in all this  is a well worth purchase.  Even if you don't like Pink Floyd's music this  is a great film visually.",950832000,,1792,4.315151515151515
413622,5,6301973461,"A few years back, a limitted edition of ""The Wall"" appeared on laserdisc with secondary audio commentary from director Alan Parker.  This time around it's the largely silent since his departure from Pink Floyd  Roger Waters' turn. In case you didn't notice, he and the remaining band  don't get along very well anymore.
One thing about this disc, with as  much storage capacity as a DVD provides, it's not nearly enough for Waters'  ego.  You may not agree with his claim that ""I am Pink Floyd,""  but there's no denying that on this movie, he was.  The other band members  had absolutely no say in the creative, artistic and editorial content of  this film.
As a film that's been disected and analyzed in many a film  class and college psychology course, it's worthwhile to finally have  commentary from the mouth of the film's driving creative force.  If you're  as big a fan of the film as myself, it's worthwhile to find the laserdisc  and hear Alan Parker's commentary as well.  Whether or not you're in the  Waters camp in the Pink Floyd blow up or not, his is the opinion on this  film that really matters.
From a digital transfer standpoint, this is a  gorgeous release, even cleaner than the laserdisc version.  The audio has a  few troubles though.  This film was released in the old Dolby format.  As a  result, there are moments when the new dolby digital audio pushes the  limitations of the source audio.  (I.E. you can't really create a true 5.1  audio track from a film that never had it to begin with.)
This film  remains a masterpiece and a source of inspiration for many a director.  One  moment that springs to mind is the opening shot closeup of the fully burnt  cigarette in Pink's hand.  This exact shot turns up ten + years later in  the opening of ""Aliens.""  While largely dismissed by critics on  it's release, this film has withstood apathy and is now largely regarded  with the respect deserved. Critics may not have appreciated this film but,  from the number of times it's cinematography gets aped in film since,  obviously a lot of young directors did.
Other Alan Parker films that are  worth checking out, ""The Commitments,"" ""Mississippi  Burning,"" ""Angel Heart,"" ""Midnight Express.""  He  also did ""Fame"" and ""Evita"" if musical films are your  thing.",950572800,4,2281,4.711734693877551

While the story is indeed depressing, it is also brilliant.  Watching ""the wall"" build up around the main character is  fascinating to say the least.  It's interesting to see what things can  cause a man to delve into himself and come out with his own distorted view  of reality.
Furthermore, the soundtrack is unequaled in quality and  sound.  Pink Floyd was, and is, a premier band in terms of talent, sound  and uniqueness.

413730,5,6301973461,"Most clearly put, this movie is a spellbinding artistic masterpiece.  It will evoke every possible emotion and leave you wanting more of even those that are ""negative"".
Roger Waters knew when the album itself, a  masterpiece all its own, was made that he wanted to eventually make an  accompanying screenplay.  The fact that the music of The Wall forms a story  on its own is a testament to Waters' vision.  There is very little script  in this movie, it is more of a visual aide to the music itself, and allows  us to see what Waters really wanted us to see when the album was originally  released.  It is like an art gallery more than a movie, where each scene is  full of both powerful meaning and subtle expression.
It spotlights the  roller coaster ride of Pink's tumultuous life, who is reportedly based on  several influences.  From Roger Waters' own personal past, to his views on  the influence of drugs on music and performance, to thoughts of the  mentally unstable former member of Pink Floyd, Sid Barrett, this movie will  both shock and move you.
I honestly cannot describe this movie and give  it the justice it deserves.  You simply must see it.
As for the DVD  itself, the remastering is truly phenomenal.  From start to finish the  video is crisp, and the sound.. my god the sound.  I don't know if I will  ever find a movie which possesses equal richness of sound.  This DVD uses  both senses to their fullest potential.
Some person commented that the  widescreen format meant losing a portion of the picture.  Au contraire,  widescreen is the only picture where you capture everything through the  eyes of the director's camera.  It is the full screen format which loses  the sides of the picture by stretching and trimming to a (roughly) 4:3  ratio.  Unfortunately however, being only available in widescreen format on  this DVD, those viewers with small televisions might be faced with a  vertically short, albeit complete picture.
The DVD extras and menus are  incredible.  This is the first DVD I have seen which has menus to configure  your sound system for optimum performance (speaker position and test).  And  the sound.. did I mention the sound?
This movie and DVD version deserves  far more than 5 stars, and is the definitive ""Final Cut"" of Roger  Waters' vision.",945302400,154,2294,4.744897959183674

The sound quality is excellent (although I don't have the  proper system to give you a more specific critique of the sound). The  documentaries (one old, one new) are fascinating and comprehensive.

It has been too long a waiting for  new or remastered music (video) productions, but what an incredible reward  'The Wall' brings ! The scale and complexity of the typical Pink Floyd  soundscape rendered in a full-circle panorama provokes a 100 minute  eargasm.
If remastering nearly 20 year old material can bring such joy,  try to imagine what new projects specifically developed for the surround  format will bring.

413828,5,6301973461,"When buying a movie, whether on DVD or VHS, it is crucial that that movie be so provocative and intellectually stimulating that it begs the viewer to watch it numerously.  If there is no desire for a viewer to watch a certain  movie more than once, than what is the point of owning it?  The Wall, by  Pink Floyd (the second greatest rock n' roll band of all time), is a movie  which cannot be watched merely once.  It has so many layers to it that it  astounds me.  There are so many ways in which to interpret the bizarre  experiences of Pink that you will have to see this movie a number of times  before you relate Pink's experiences to your own life.  However, once you  have achieved this, you will only want to watch it even more, if, for  nothing else, to enjoy the unbelievably powerful music that is contained  within and what better a way to hear such strong melodies than with Dolby  Digital 5.1 sound.  Indeed, The Wall is an event almost made to be  experienced through the medium of digital picture and sound.
The music  of Pink Floyd is so incomprehensibly strong.  They excel at powerful  rhythms which serve to severely alter your psyche.  It is this rock opera  and album, The Wall, which is their most powerful work, and hence their  greatest.  It at the very least deserves to be a part of anyone's home  video library.",944438400,22,1339,4.411522633744856

413914,5,6301973461,"I think the overwhelming response and the average rating of this film by amazon visitors is indicative of how great a film this is. I know there was one bad review but we must assume that he tends, as someone else noted,  towrds the multi-million dollar rock em sock em and blow em up kind of  flick. The Wall is nowhere near that. This movie is not about drugs at all,  In fact, if you made a little trip to your local library you would find  that this movie is almost a complete autobiography of ex-lead singer, Roger  Waters, as well as a condensed biography of the band. The allusion to the  war scenes are indicative of this since Waters father died in World War II,  and the scene where Geldof goes insane was actually inspired by their agent  having a nervous breakdown in his trailer. Further, you will come across a  song in there that is impossible to find and out of print now, called,  ""When The Tigers Broke Free."" It is one of the most amazing songs  by Floyd and its a song in memory of Waters' father. Hence the boy dressing  up in the army surplus and reading the scroll that says it as such. This is  one of the few movies I can watch more than once without ever getting tired  of it. The symbolism is phenomenal, the animation is one to be reckoned  with, and the astounding performances by the actors and actresses cannot be  matched. If you are looking for an older movie that evokes thought while  drawing you in with its amazing songs, than this movie is for you. I will  probably get a lot of flack for this, but I think it would be safe to call  this movie a masterpiece. If you don't own it, you need to get it, and if  you already have it, then alas, you know the treasure you possess.",944179200,6,1712,4.241486068111455

413916,5,6301973461,"Just finished watching THE WALL on DVD.  And it was quite good.
Firstly, as all of you know it is presented in widescreen, which afforded me a view of those sights that were previously hidden in the pan and scan full frame  version.  The picture is very clear, with only a trace of those pubic hair  like things every now and then.  To my slight dismay, I got a digital pixel  blip that I have never experienced with my DVD player.  It was near the  beginning and did not reappear to my knowledge.
The sound is wonderful.  I don't have a huge sound set up in my living room, but my TV does have  surround sound and I thought it was a dramatic improvement over the VHS.  Although I've listened to these songs more times than what's probably  considered healthy, they almost sounded like brand new songs.
The running  commentary track with Roger Waters and animator Gerald Scarfe was extremely  entertaining.  Not only did Waters and Scarfe discuss bits of film trivia,  but they also wax a fair amount of philosophic.  In places Waters  reminisces at length about his childhood and while some of it is stuff  we've read or heard in past interviews, it's still fascinating. Scarfe, of  course, talks mostly about the animation, but his commentary is engaging as  well.  Oh, and there are moments in the commentary that are very, very  funny.  I was unprepared for this and almost laughed myself to tears at  some of his comments.  While the film itself might be very grim stuff,  Waters himself is extremely witty with a gut busting sense of  humor.
There are two documentaries on the DVD.  The first one looks old  and appears to have been made shortly after the movie.  I only watched half  of it as it was a trifle repetitive, filling in alot of screen time with  clip after clip from the movie itself.  The second documentary, divided  into two parts for some reason, is alot better.  It looks quite recent and  features lengthy interviews of Roger Waters, Gerald Scarfe, Alan Parker,  and others.  All of them are very fun to listen to.  Being a fan of Waters,  I naturally liked his interviews best.  Unlike other persons in the rock n  roll industry, Roger Waters on film is sort of a rarity.  It was neat to  see him talking and telling stories.
Among the extra bonus features on  the DVD is the inclusion of the previously unreleased HEY YOU reel.  While  it's in black and white and the sound is somewhat raw, it is a welcome  addition to the DVD.  After watching this footage, it was clearer to me  why, of all songs, this one was deleted and why I never really missed it.  I can see how it would have made the narrative bog down a little.
Next in  the list of bonus features is a crude music video for ANOTHER BRICK IN THE  WALL PART II.  In the commentary,  I believe it is Gerald Scarfe who says  that when this song was first released as a single, a video was hastily put  together using animation from the WALL live shows along with some footage  of kids milling about and lip synching the words.  It looks like an  extremely early MTV video, shot on a budget of about fifty dollars.
The  third bonus feature, titled PROMO, takes you to another menu where you can  watch the trailer, look at still production photos (some of which I have  never seen), or leaf through a gallery of conceptual drawings and artwork  by Gerald Scarfe.
The menus are interesting at first but get tedious once  you've had to sit through them a time or two.  It is clear that time and  care went into their design, but certain menus are bordering on cheesy,  particular the one for sound set up, in which the selections look like red  pie plates for some reason.  I would have loved to see some clips of live  WALL footage as a bonus feature but with all that WAS included, I can't  complain.  Except for the design on the DVD case.  I think people will  agree with me that the original blue screaming head on the old VHS box and  movie poster was a more classic looking design.
Aside from those tiny  gripes, this is a top notch DVD.",944092800,10,4025,4.430536451169188
413917,5,6301973461,"This film is one of the most powerful films I have seen.  It is a shame most people have to assoiciate the downward spiral to drug use.  This film is very abstract. I believe it is done so in a way so that the viewer can  feel how estranged the character Pink becomes.  Excellent Artwork,  metaphorical presentation, and staging coupled with powerful music.  Hate  it or love it, must watch at least twice to start forming your own views.",943660800,11,438,4.468354430379747
413918,4,6301973461,"""Pink Floyd the Wall"" is what it was always supposed to be...a visual experience.  The music from the original LP hit us hard enough, with such poignant tunes as ""Hey You"", ""Vera Lynn"" and  ""Mother"", not to mention the showstoppers ""Run Like  Hell"", ""Another Brick in the Wall"", and ""Comfortably  Numb"".  It was a natural progression that a movie came out, and I'm  glad it did.  The result is powerful.  The film creates an eerie, sad,  desperate and pervasive world that envelopes you, taking you in and down  with the movie's anti-hero, Pink.  His life is one of rebellion and  loneliness, and he never quite comes to terms with himself until the end,  when it's really too late.  From his early experiences with bitter and  sarcastic headmasters to his final drug overdose and near insanity, we get  to run the gamut of experiences with him, and if it isn't always  satisfying, it is certainly compelling.  One of the most memorable, tragic  scenes involves Pink's crew trying to get him ready for a gig, while he's  whacked out on pills and whatever else is handy.  As they drag him, wasted  and near-comatose, to the show he must play, he hallucinates that he's  literally rotting away, while the song ""Comfortably Numb"" drones  ominously on the soundtrack.  The result is frightening, and very good.
Not for the squeamish, this movie has many brilliant little moments like  this, and as a whole, ranks as one of the more intense dramas ever made.",943315200,83,1453,4.758064516129032

414152,5,6301973461,"'Pink' (played by Bob Geldof) has been turned into a rock 'n' roll fascist by the overwhelming excesses of fame, fortune and applause. As Pink subconciously builds his wall between himself and the outside world, Roger  Waters and co-director Alan Parker provide - with the help of animator,  Gerald Scarfe - an insight into how the dark side of success can cause any  level of piece of mind to unwittingly decay into an existance of various  forms of destruction.
The music is provided courtesy of Pink Floyd's  album 'The Wall' which was written by Roger Waters. Gerald Scarfe's  startling animation sometimes borders on the horrific, but rarely fails to  entertain.  In addition, Hey You has been included for the fans who missed  it on the original cut, as well as a narrative from Waters and Scarfe.  Part of the intent with this DVD release was to insert a level of humor  missing from the movie's initial release, which for me wasn't without it's  smile-enducing moments.
A real 'smack in the face' flick, which by virtue  of an unfurling change in emotional direction at the movie's end, leaves  the viewer feeling a little more positive than might have been anticipated.",936748800,,1178,4.8542713567839195
