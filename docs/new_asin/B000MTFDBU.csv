2747935,2,B000MTFDBU,"There are very few laughs in this movie. David Faustino and Nora Dunn couldn't even save it. And, predictable, the good guy wins. I only rented it, very glad I did not purchase it.",1262217600,,180,4.323529411764706
2747936,3,B000MTFDBU,"After receiving 208 unsolicited and pre-approved credit cards in the mail, unemployed dreamer Frank (Jon Bon Jovi) decides to use the cards to finance his latest idea - a women's ice-hockey league. However, Frank runs into trouble when the credit card companies finally catch up with him and charge him with fraud.

""National Lampoon's Pucked"" is a ""bad"" movie. You probably already know that. I knew it before I even purchased this DVD. With the exception of the ""Vacation"" movies, pretty much every movie with the words ""National Lampoon's"" in the title is a B-grade movie made on a low-budget using second-rate actors and a second-rate script, and ""Pucked"" is no exception. However, unlike some of the other ""National Lampoon"" movies, ""Pucked"" somehow manages to work.

The cast of ""Pucked"" is made up of a bunch of has-beens and never-beens, but among them are Jon Bon Jovi, Curtis Armstrong (Booger from ""Revenge of the Nerds""), David Faustino (Bud from ""Married with Children"") and Cary Elwes. Sure, none of them are top actors anymore (if they ever were), but they all commit to the material that they are working with and through their belief in their characters and enthusiasm, manage to sell their characters to the audience. Similarly, the script of this film is certainly no Oscar contender, but it is well structured (better structured than ""Twilight"", which I saw the same day) and is surprisingly funny. Within the first 15 minutes there's a fight between Jon Bon Jovi and a midget! What more could you ask for?

If you have ever liked any of the actors in this film, or just want to switch off your brain for 83 minutes and watch some mindless entertainment, then this film is worth a try. Don't expect too much, but don't expect to be bored either.",1232409600,,1765,4.818481848184819
2747937,5,B000MTFDBU,"The DVD plays perfectly and the case looks new.  Delivery was fast, and the price was great!",1227398400,,92,4.411764705882353
2747938,2,B000MTFDBU,"This is the worse of all the movies JBJ has appeared in.  But for the bon Jovi fan, it is worth shutting off the sound, sitting back with a glass of wine, and enjoying it purely for voyeuristic purposes.  A really bad career choice for Bon Jovi",1224547200,,244,4.170212765957447
2747939,2,B000MTFDBU,"Yes, I bought this movie because Jon Bon Jovi was in it.  My male friends wanted to watch it for the T&A factor, and we all love a good bad movie.  This one, unfortunately, missed the mark on all of it.  The story was boring and predictable, no T&A (except for the deleted scenes where there was way too much of it.)  Bon Jovi and Faustino actually did a pretty good job, they made their characters somewhat likable and charismatic, but the script was worse than your usual National Lampoon fare.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one.",1196035200,,536,4.373737373737374
2747940,2,B000MTFDBU,"I'm an avid Jon Bon Jovi fan and thought he did well in a movie that's script should be burnt, I should have realised considering it's a National Lampoon's T & A movie. Light hearted and slightly amusing - Jon's looking good as usual.",1184803200,,234,4.340909090909091
2747941,5,B000MTFDBU,Pretty good movie.. I was a extra in the movie when they were in the hockey rink.. My friend was shone 3 times but I only got to see myself once... On well My 15 seconds of fame...,1184544000,,180,3.763157894736842
2747942,4,B000MTFDBU,"Actualy, i found this movie pretty good and fun:) And Jon Bon Jovi is good in it, don't trust some online critics that can not see it...",1181606400,,136,4.074074074074074
2747943,1,B000MTFDBU,"This is yet another example of why it's just about always a bad idea for NATIONAL LAMPOON to give pseudo-celebrities their chance to take a lead role in one of their films.  Paris Hilton bombed in BOTTOMS UP and Michael Douglas' son had a career-ending flick in ADAM AND EVE.  The present film, with John Bon Jovi, belongs in this same infamous league of NL flops.

It becomes painfully obvious from watching this movie that John Bon Jovi can't act - not even just for an NL movie.  [Of course, he can't sing either, but that's another story altogether]  He has no screen presence @ all and mouths his lines as though he is reading off of cue cards (which he probably is).  Not ever, ever, EVER seeing Bon Jovi in another movie again would be a very good thing in my book.

The plot is pretty simple.  Bon Jovi plays a con artist who tries to get a women's hockey league going.  The ""catch"" is that the women all look like Victoria's Secret models (with the exception of 1 girl).  As he doesn't have the resources to finance such a venture, he uses ENRON techniques of book-keeping to keep his mis-guided ""dream"" alive.

Being that this is an NL film, one would think that there would be a lot of opportunity for some locker room scenes.  Inexplicably, they don't really take advantage of this.  Sure, there are a few flashes of nudity here & there, but if you blink you will miss them.  This aspect of the movie was VERY disappointing.  I've seen some NL movies in the past that were lame but were redeemed by the amount of T & A they had.

Along those lines, the only thing that remotely saves this DVD is the special feature.  It's as though the producers say ""We know that you (the viewer) wanted to see topless women.""  {Question:  why didn't they put more in the movie then?}  At any rate, they have some funny ""topless interviews"" with girls from the film - even though the questions are very lame.  They also have some locker room scenes that we were all expecting to see in the movie itself.  Guess that it's better to have it in the Special Features than nowhere @ all.

I can't recall ever saying that a DVD's special features were better than the movie itself, but that is the case here.  NL has put out some of the very best party movies of all time (VAN WILDER, VACATION, ANIMAL HOUSE to name a few).  Unfortunately, this one is not one of them.  In fact, it's not even close!",1180310400,,2390,4.36281179138322
2747944,5,B000MTFDBU,"While the movie got terrible reviews, I and my 21 year old son LOVED this movie!  Jon Bon Jovi was incredible and the cast was amusing and there were subtle jokes all through it so you have to pay attention!  I am thrilled with this movie!",1179187200,,239,4.173913043478261
2747945,4,B000MTFDBU,"This movie was a lot better than recent movies released by ""National Lampoon"", or at least a watered down version of a name you used to be able to trust.  As compared to recent releases such as Spring Break and Pledge this, this movie gets an oscar for best picture.  This follow Jon Bon Jovi as Frank, a down and out invetor/thinker who gave up a life as a lawyer to pursue a career in promotion and sales.  When he thinks he's lost it all, filling out a simple survey brings new fortune and potential fame his way, along with changing the lives of many others for the better.  David Faustino (Married with Children) is co star as Franks best friend, and unlikely legal consultant when the bubble gets busted.  Rent this movie, find out what happens, and chuckle while you do it. Worth a rental, or purchase.",1178409600,,809,4.4391891891891895
2747946,3,B000MTFDBU,This movie is not bad for a National Lampoon.  The message is good.,1178409600,,67,4.153846153846154
2747947,3,B000MTFDBU,"After a few absolute horrible movies from National Lampoon's (Pledge this, Van Wilder 2 to name a couple), Pucked is not to shabby. And, good or bad, Jon Bon Jovi Stars in this with David Fastano, (Bud from married with Children).  It is a comedy about a former lawyer turned dreamer that for over 10 years gave up his great leagal career for creativity and some failed business adventers eg. professional women's mall mud wrestling.  Well, by magical chance and by filling out a ""survey"", John bon jovi character receives a pre-approved credit card...and many more follow.  His Current dream, the World wide Women's hockey league. Unfortunately, his finacial backer's fall through...and the ones he eventually uses are just plastic, if you know what I mean. The movie revolves around a court hearing for him against his creditors.  Not great, but not the worst in the National lampoon's catalog.  One thing, in here they make a statement that the WNBA is successful, and thats why he's starting women's hocky...The WNBA may be getting better since I last checked, but For years was a big red mark on the ledgers NBA...so this guy really is a dreamer.  Oh well, enjoyable, worth a viewing.",1176940800,,1189,4.861386138613861
8172172,1,B000MTFDBU,"Rocker John Bon Jovi plays Frank Hopper a down-on-his-luck dreamer and never do well who gets the idea to make a womens' hockey league after he royally screws up yet another job that his downtrodden girlfriend got for him. How does he want to pay for this you may ask?? A long string of maxed out credit cards that the credit company comes after him for. 'madcap hijinks' ensue.

There's a long list of people that should have known better than to star or take part in this deathly unfunny bad-sitcom level movie. There's Bon Jovi of course, but then there's Bud Bundy from Married with children, Booger from ""Revenge of the Nerds"", & Nora Dunn from SNL. All of which boast extremely lackluster performances in this atrocious film. I don't really recall laughing once during the duration of it & i implore you to spend your time more wisely than with this turd. If this movie was a car you'd bet your sweet ass that I'd try to get cash for this clunker.",1516406400,,953,4.477011494252873
