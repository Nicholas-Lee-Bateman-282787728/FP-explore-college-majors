201971,4,1888568003,This video has been around for over 25 years. At least that is when I first viewed it and found it to be so impressive that 25 years latter I want to use it as a tool to minister to my family and others as well.  It  involves three couples. One couple has accepted Christ into their lives and  another couple laughs at the thought of a Savior. The third couple is  questioning at first and then the husband accepts Christ. The rest will  keep you on the edge of your chair,938822400,8,472,4.086956521739131
201972,5,1888568003,Good movie. I enjoyed it. I couldn't help thinking as i was watching it how i might have felt about it had i seen it when it first came out as i was just a teen in the 70s. Im sure it would of made me think. Service was great. Came pretty quick.,1451001600,,245,3.641509433962264

201974,2,1888568003,"I had wanted to see this for again for MANY years.  I had seen it as a little girl in church and it made a huge impression.
As a adult (WAY many years later)... it was comical (in not a good way) and just plain silly.  Terrible acting,  Mostly it's a church sermon in between the story/movie and I didn't remember the group talk part at all.  I only remembered the shocking parts (blender and lawn mower still running after people gone etc).  The only cool thing seeing this now was looking at the old 70's hair and clothes.",1446768000,,524,4.252525252525253

201979,4,1888568003,"A movie my childhood church played just about every year. So serious, it's hilarious. Got me into apocalypse fiction, which probably wasn't what my old pastor intended. I did a live-tweet movie review of thisfor my blog and Storify last year. You can find them here:

201981,5,1888568003,"A Thief in the Night was an amazingly well-done, Scripturally accurate portrayal of what will happen (soon, now, I believe!) with the Pre-Tribulation Rapture for all TRUE (born again) believers in Christ and what will be left for those who aren't. The Rapture and the Trib are beautifully explained through the actors and close-up views of detailed, illustrated tracts, the characters are real seeming people to whom we can relate. The movie (through Jeanette) brings up common questions that skeptics often have about God; the youth worker at the youth center does a beautiful job of answering them before Jeanette gets saved. Patty's loving but firm grandmother does an excellent job of explaining the Tribulation and stressing that the time is NOW to ask Jesus to rule your life! Wanda does a great job of portraying a Tribulation age saint, through her brave (and, amazingly joyous) beheading. Patty portrays the blame toward God that many will feel during the Tribulation by rejecting God when they still had a chance. Amazingly, though she's heard the Gospel and sees prophecy in the news headlines (like we are today) AND endures the Tribulation, she still rejects God; then, after taking the Mark of the Beast (Rev. 16-17) in her right hand, transforms from an unbeliever still capable of humane thought to a demon possessed, cold, ruthless killer; she's sold her soul to the Devil by taking the Mark. This is part of what Revelations was talking about. I am going to share this movie with all I know. I wish all churches would show this to small groups. The acting was superb. I can see why it was award winning!",1425600000,5,1621,4.855595667870036

201991,5,1888568003,"I saw this online and I was hooked. I had to buy this. The acting could use some help, but the message came through loud and clear, accept Jesus in your heart. Many of us go to church and don't listen or get a useless politically correct version of scripture. This is dangerous and the movie shows that. I am going to give a copy to a lady at our church who does a ministry in the prison.",1331078400,2,388,3.9871794871794872
201992,1,1888568003,"I came across this movie today while trying to explain the difference between this and the Left Behind Series.  I am one who grew up watching this movie, and at the time agreed with the ramification of the message. I have since come to realize that Jesus spoke of a gospel of Love, grace, restoration, and peace, not of damnation.  Now twenty-some years later, I must laugh at the manipulation effect used to scare the viewer into accepting Jesus.

If you are looking at this movie as an ""evangelistic technique"", DON'T BOTHER.  Fear-based manipulative encouragements don't work.  We've seen this for years through the drug and alcohol field.  Do you wonder why we don't have ""this is your brain on drugs"" commercials anymore?  It is simply because anyone can be compelling when they use fear, yet when the fear subsides - so does the compelling portion of the argument.  So use some better Christian movies like ""The Ultimate Gift"" or ""To Save a Life"".

But if you are viewing this movie to remember the horror you used to feel while watching them as a kid (BTW it's on YouTube), keep a therapist on speed-dial!  I have always wondered why the song ""We are one in the Spirit"" sends chills down my back, now I know.",1331078400,6,1215,4.609302325581395

201994,1,1888568003,"I was forced to watch this when I was about twelve. Luckily I'm smart, so after a period of nightmares, I was able to work out that if the message of Christianity is so weak that they need to scare little kids into believing, the whole thing is probably a crock.

The shame of it is that Christians tend not to be so smart (look around any congregation) and their kids mostly inherit their stupidity, so I guess a lot of them weren't able to brush off the message as easily as I did. Pure child abuse, committed by hypocritical church leaders who shoved this filth on us while condemning, for example, Philadelphia with Tom Hanks because of its sympathetic portrayal of an AIDS sufferer. Evil scumbags.

Kids, if you're reading, it's all rubbish. Now go and have a beer and relax.",1294617600,10,780,4.485915492957746

The massage on the movie is clear and enlightening about the second coming of our lord jesus christ, and it would make anyone self reflect about their relationship with God. My problem with this DVD is that it was too expensive. I searched for months for a cheaper DVD but couldn't find one so I had to pay over $40.00 for it. I recently just realized that theirs a full version of this DVD on youtube.com and I wish I had known earlier then I would have watched it online and not spend so much on just one DVD.

201996,5,1888568003,"I saw this video when I was about 15 years old or so.  I loved it so much that I wanted to share it with others.  Some new generation hadn't seen it before and I wanted them to view it.  It portrays what Jesus talked about in the gospels as to what signs we are to look for at the end times.  This movie is not to scare anyone into believing in Jesus, but just present facts and it serves as a warning to us.  The more I see what's going on in this world, the more I see that what Jesus said would happen is happening right before our eyes.  That is something we can't deny.  I loved this movie.

and YES, i absolutely am a christian.

fear is not a tool that should ever be used to love folks into the kingdom.

the idea of the rapture is less than 200 years old, it was a vision made by a young british woman->
most importantly, THE RAPTURE IS NOT BIBLICAL !!!!!!

this is a weird fear based agenda that has no place in the kingdom.",1236816000,13,435,4.023255813953488

201999,3,1888568003,"What would we do without technology, even 70s-level special effects, to dramatize our most terrifying fantasies?  All John of Patmos had was words, but we have those thundering sound and light extravaganzas called movies to make the ""end-times"" look horrific--and then we have reviewers on Amazon to say that whatever you saw in the movies isn't nearly as bad as the reality will be.  I'm wondering whether all those people who have seen the film realize it was made some thirty years ago, and we're all still around to watch it.  We're also all still around to read some history of end-times thinking and find out that such predictions have reared their loathsome heads in Europe and America recurrently over the last 2000 years, since Jesus himself is reported to have advised his listeners that some of them would live to see God's cosmic judgment on His enemies.

And future generations will be around to wonder how anyone could take these fictions seriously.  John of Patmos wanted to scare his readers/listeners into compliance with his fanatical righteousness and reassure them that the enemies of the 1st century followers of Jesus would get their just desserts, even though, at the time, it certainly wasn't apparent how that would happen.  John's message: have faith--in wrath and doom.

Watch this film and be thankful we're at least enlightened enough that we can turn our backs on its incredible ideology.  How do believers validate their claims that this part of the Bible is true?  They simply circle you back to the very book you're trying to verify, as though any other possible authority (like critical history, or better yet, common sense) is irrelevant.  Final rating:  dumb but moderately enteraining, so long as you don't have the volume up too high.  Or, better yet, relevant to the study of aberrant cultural phenomena.",1192579200,5,1843,4.96742671009772
202000,5,1888568003,"This is one review that I will try to tell as little as possible, so you can enjoy this movie without preconceived notions.  The title comes from the reference in 1 Thessalonians 5, that the Day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night.

This movie (and the subsequent movies) are taken from a pre-millennial, pre-tribualtional theology.  Pre-millennial means Christ will return following a seven year tribulation period to set up His kingdom.  Pre-tribulational means that Christians will be taken from the earth to be with Christ prior to that seven year tribulation.

This is all I'll tell you about the movie.  If you have not seen it, please do.  If you are not a Christian, definitely see this movie, and definitely find a Christian to answer any questions you have concerning this movie.",1168387200,15,799,4.788321167883212
202001,4,1888568003,"Everybody is a ""victim"" these days. First, to all the whiners - get a good dose of the truth! If you want to get a feel for what the ""end-times"" will really be like, then THIS MOVIE IS FOR YOU. If you would rather bury your head in the sand and go on playing church, then skip this film. The depictions in these films are NOWHERE NEAR what the real thing will be like. Open your BIBLE and take a look (and not one of those watered down perversions (NIV, etc.) - use the KJV! Even though they don't use the KJV entirely in these films, they are a very good outline for what the tribulation will be like. If you will notice when watching this, Patty is right all along - she keeps saying she can't get saved - she turned down God's free gift before the rapture. I think that those who are offended by this or have ""nightmares"" from this movie better take a long hard look at themselves and their relationship with God - they may see things differently if they allow Him to change them. As for children, all our kids have seen this (15, 12, 10, 6, 4, and 1) and our daughter who normally has ""nightmares"" from ""scary"" things (the 10 year old) in movies thought this was a good movie and had no problems with it. I think it is the ""spirit"" in which you watch the film that makes the difference. If you watch it with a nasty attitude, sure, it is going to affect you negatively. If you watch it with an interest in what God wants for us NOW, then it will affect you to want to lead more people to Christ. Quit whining over what happened 20 or 30 or 40 years ago and move on. Look past the aged clothing, etc. and see the TRUTH!",1084492800,16,1622,4.10377358490566
202002,3,1888568003,"russell doughten is a genius. he taught acting in hollywood, studied at yale school of drama, and made these cult classics which resonated in the 70's. i was blown away seeing these at Christian youth rallies and baptist churches as a kid. i'm making movies in hollywood now, and i still watch these flicks for inspiration. i think russell made films that scared the hell out of people, with a sincere motivation to see them saved. his detractors may say they are dated and campy, but like ed wood, the films outlive their detractors. russell got them made and shot on 16mm in the middle of iowa, a greater achievemnet than his critics.",1083542400,11,636,4.6371681415929205
202003,5,1888568003,"After watching the ever popular Left Behind starring Kirk Cameron, I had a whole new out-look on the future, and on God's ways of doing things. But then someone at my church told me there was an orginal Left Behind. What the title was, she didn't say. Then, looking it up one day, I ran across a Thief in the Night on Amazon hoping that there would be a book to the movie like Left Behind. Watching the movie, I realized, they made A thief in the night from scratch. It is a highly underrated film for it's times. It should've been given more credit then it has. If only people in the 70's would've paid more attention to it, they would know what is going to happen to our world, for it is near.

Stubborn, and spoiled Patty Myers thinks she's a christian. Going to church, reading her bible, and following the ten commandments; what more do you want? But no later than expected, she realizes there was a lot more than to what she thought was going on. Thinking she could've changed anytime she wanted, she is now stuck in the spiraling vortex that the tribulation has her trapped in when millions of people suddenly disappear into thin air all at the same time all over the globe. All too many times she was warned about the disappearances as the infamous Rapture. In the chaos that the world is now facing, everywhere around her, people are getting marked with a symbol that a strange shadowy organization called UNITE has come up with. As even more apt as can be, the mark will not come off, and Patty knows all too well that this is the mark of the beast which also turns up in the tribulation as foretold in the bible. She tries to avoid it as much as she can, but stores all around won't let anyone in without it. There's only one way out for her, and that's to let the problem enter God's still willing hands.

Watching this left an even bigger impression than Left Behind ever will. It mentions God more than it does in Left Behind, and probably gives an even greater message than Left Behind does considering you don't even have to see a sequel just to know what's going on, and what will happen if people don't hurry up, and change. I'm not saying the Rapture is going to happen anytime soon (it might, you never know) but it's just the fact that people wait until the last minute to accept Christ. People say these movies used scare tactics and ruined them for life. Sometimes you have to scare people just to get their attention. I'm 13 and you don't seem me crying about it, do you? This was actually a pretty exciting movie for telling the truth about the future.

I'm saying this to the people who say these movies ruined their faith and their life. These movies didn't do anything to you. You're the one who made the choice to leave your faith just because you saw the truth. It will not ruin your life, it will change your life. Take it from a kid who was falling away and came back to Christ because of this film. And believe me, I didn't see one scary thing about this movie. Take a look at reality. It just might look you back.",1080259200,48,3047,4.323426573426573
202004,5,1888568003,"One of the best films from the 1970s on the subject of cobra-handling and emergency treatment for snake bites, and if you're not careful you might learn something. About Jesus, that is -- not the snake, but the Messiah. The Biblical prophecy as applies to our times is very well laid out in this film, even if the theology is sometimes at cross purposes: ie, ""Jesus is like a snake."" Borderline genius, yet slightly evil in its own right -- the film was also controversial in its time for obvious drug use. The film only falls apart at the end, when it turns into a drab litany against the government bureaucracy. We should be grateful we have a Christian government, Christian post office, etc. Leaves the story open for sequels, including FIGHT EVIL WITH EVIL.",1018137600,4,762,4.651851851851852

Ask anyone in Generation X who saw this as children, when we were bused to churches in large crowds.  These 4 movies are one major reason for our ""issues"" as a generation.  We all lived in constant fear of 5 things:  the Rapture, the Russians, the vampires, the aliens, and nuclear annihilation in World War III.

He told me, that as a child, he had nightmares after watching this movie, but now he's asking me if I could remember the title.  He does remember, wants to see it again, and to show it to his friends. It's a movie that we had a hard time watching and believing, but it does fall in line with the word of God.  I would not ever show this to little ones again, but as children get older, I think it's a movie that can help put life, and what children may come up against in life, into a better preseptive.

202010,3,1888568003,"The evangelical nature of this film may scare some non-Christians away from what is a true 70's B-movie classic.  Filmed on location in scenic Iowa, this film even features Russell Doughten Jr. (co-producer of the 1958 classic ""The Blob"" and executive producer of this film) as Reverend Turner, a liberal pastor who is left behind after all the Christians disappear during 'The Rapture.'  The plot follows the trials of Patty Myers, a young teenager who awakens to find that millions of people around the world have suddenly disappeared without a trace.  She had the opportunity to give her heart to Jesus, but was hindered by Rev. Turner, who denies the teaching of the Rapture from the pulpit.  Suddenly, Patty finds herself in a world ruled by a global organization (UNITE) controlled by the United Nations.  She spends a good deal of the movie running away from armed UNITE thugs who are intent on making sure she receives ""the mark,"" a strange 'computer code' that identifies her as one of Satan's own.  This is a film that scared the hell out (quite literally, in some cases) of a good many children and teenagers during the 70's and early 80's.  Endearingly sub-par acting, low-budget sets and props, horribly dated scenery and clothing, and a cheesy over-the-top film score add up to a film that should rightfully be a classic among lovers of B-movie flicks.

202016,5,1888568003,"I will never forget the impact this movie has done in my life. 18 years ago. I still remember as if it was just yesterday. I've seen it several times along with the other sequals that come with it. I've rented it and  showed it to my family and friends. It is a ""MUST"" have for  witnessing, I'm glad I've found it on Amazon.com for purchase. I will  purchase my own set and use it as a witnessing tool. Including the Nicky  Cruz movie ""The Cross and the Swithchblade"" These all have  impacted my life and have made my walk in the Lord stronger, just to think  of what could happen in just a blink of an eye. At times I found my self  thinking the Lord had came when I would come home and see food on the  kitchen stove and everything working and my mother gone. I would get flash  backs of the movie.

I have  seen this movie several times since, and while a product of it's times  (early 70's) with bell bottoms, wide sideburns, and mini-skirts, its  message is just as pertinent and pressing as when it was made, and impact  just as effective; time is short, the harvest plentiful and workers few.",951609600,13,496,4.23404255319149
202018,5,1888568003,"This video captured my heart when I was 10.  I have never forgotten this video and have encouraged my friends, Christian and non, to watch and accept the message.  Powerful and biblically correct in its content.  A  message everyone should hear.  It does not beat around the bush as a  current ""Christian"" movie does.  See this and give your life to  the Lord, or rededicate your life to our Savior in Heaven.",940550400,16,409,4.583333333333333

7800931,1,1888568003,"This movie should not be rated G. It should, at the very least, be rated PG. Parental Guidance is necessary for this movie. Would you let your 5 year old or a 10 year old watch, the Shining, The Exorcist or other such movies? I doubt it and this movie will definitely make a distinct impression on your children if you let them watch this movie. You might as well sit down with a bucket of popcorn and watch Saw, The Shining, Carrie and It with your kids and see how much sleep you get in the next few months. They will be having nightmares repeatedly and sadly they might even believe what this movie presumes to teach - that one day when they least expect it, their parents, teachers, friends and classmates have all ""raptured"" and they are left all alone. They'll worry over it, they'll obsess over it and they'll even be afraid to hope for anything.

So PLEASE, if you care naught for your children, just pop it into the DVD player and sit them down and watch their brains warp and manifest paranoia, insecurity, lack of hope, faith through fear and other not so healthy manifestations by those poor children who were forced into watching this to scare them to behave in a uncertain world that was the seventies. (Hippies, marijuana, free love, gas shortages, hostages, etc., etc. - No wonder they thought it was the end of times!)",1474416000,,1335,4.493827160493828

The clothing is very dated, but the message is timeless.  Good choice for purchasing.",1472947200,,261,4.16
7800933,5,1888568003,"Okay...the acting is either wooden or over-the-top. They obviously did not have a huge budget. The production values are bargain-basement. However, this is a film that I will remember to the day I leave this earth. Because it is so simple and so ""not slick"", the story has a chance to be foremost. Not special effects, or famous faces, or soundtracks by well-known artists. I saw this at church and then rented it several times and watched it with my kids. Some scenes are etched forever in my mind....the mixer that endlessly rotates and the shaver that is buzzing in the sink. The sequels were not nearly as good. In the first movie, the female lead looks very ordinary. In the second movie, despite living in a Post-Rapture world, her hair is much nicer, she has better make-up, and has lost weight - which I guess weight loss might be explainable - but she looks a lot better groomed. I think the stars saw themselves in the first movie and decided to upgrade their appearances. Too bad...the first movie is so unsophisticated that the truth is unvarnished and real.",1471910400,,1070,4.666666666666667

7800936,3,1888568003,"First, for an evening of laughing at the retro clothes and cheesy production values, etc, this film is pretty fun to watch. I recall the sequels being markedly worse as films, with A-Team (TV series) level scripts and production values, bad dialogue, etc.

As kids, they scared the daylights out of us, and all I can do is thank God I had friends whose families also thought showing these movies to children was a good idea so we could process this stuff together. We'd have a moment of panic if we couldn't find our parent in the store, or came home to an empty house. We thought if we couldn't straighten up and fly right, we might find ourselves on the run from UN goons intent on cutting our heads off, which would have been the only way to avoid hell. It's amazing that we are not all crazy, but somehow this was all normalized.

As an adult coming back to the faith, I remember the day I read some verses pertaining (according to some) to a premillennial rapture of the Church, which is followed with this instruction: ""Therefore encourage one another with these words."" It dawned on me then that the return of Jesus is a source of hope, not a threat to be used to make horror films. Crazy times, the seventies.",1463356800,,1217,4.428571428571429
