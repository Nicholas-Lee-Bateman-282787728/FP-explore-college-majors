He pulls Ludovic Texier out of his bland shell to sing glorious.  Worth the price of DVD to see Dessay's intense concentration and humor",1445040000,2,270,5.090909090909091

8607956,5,B00EPFMS88,"This fine documentary takes you right into the heart of creation. A skilled, sensitive director working with a cast of masterly singers on the staging of the old staple La Traviata, turning every scene into something completely fresh and new, and at the same time being true to the work. To see a star of Natalie Dessay capacity struggling with her role in close-up is a rare revelation. Highly recommended not just for opera lovers but for everyone interested in drama and stage craft.",1412121600,2,486,4.7976190476190474
8607957,5,B00EPFMS88,"It would be good to have a general summary of the plot of La Traviata to enjoy this the most, but it is not entirely necessary.  It is an extremely moving portrayal of a director working with his singer/actors to develop the idea of who the characters in the opera really are and what the society expects of them.  I attended this movie with a opera singer friend and we both emerged from the movie with tears streaming down our faces.  By the time the movie was over, we had such empathy with the characters we were stunned!",1409529600,6,525,4.336734693877551
8607958,5,B00EPFMS88,"I read a glowing review of this documentary about a production of La Traviata in Opera News and bought the DVD mostly to find out why so much fuss is made over Natalie Dessay, the French soprano. Well now I know. I subsequently bought and watched the DVD of the Opera production that is  being rehearsed in the documentary and was moved by La Traviata for the first time in my life.",1398902400,6,382,4.305555555555555
8607959,5,B00EPFMS88,"This is an excellent documentary of the production of Verdi's opera at Aix-en-Provence Festival 2011. The director Jean-Franois Sivadier works with the singers as they get into the psychology of the music and the libretto. One sees how the director and singers come to realize what drives each character and who they are in a contemporary way. The music is performed by the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Louis Langr&eacute;e. Natalie Dessay is a good actor as well as a wonderful musician, not to mention being a very attractive and charming lady. This video really helps me to see operas with a wider perspective. I learned from this how much more one can see, hear and feel in every production of this wonderful opera. One should go on to see the actual resulting performance for which a DVD is available.",1387756800,12,816,4.835714285714285
