7993534,2,B00009W0WA,"A private investigator (C.C. Costigan) takes on a case involving a missing male model. It pulls her into a subculture of sex clubs, sex parties, prostitution, and rich people. In addition to C.C., there is Regina Russell and several other attractive women. Sounds like the perfect setup for a great softcore movie, right? Unfortunately, this was pathetic. What happened to the Surrender I knew and loved?

There are five sex scenes, and I am using a really liberal definition of ""sex scene"" here. One of them was appallingly short and two of them were just plain bad. The other two were decent, but not very memorable. Fortunately, the two decent ones were C.C. and Regina's scenes, so this thing wasn't a total waste. The longest scene lasted only about four minutes. There was also a solo scene involving C.C., but it too was very short and very tame.

This is a Shadow DVD release, and amazingly, it is the unrated version, not a hacked up R rated version. However, if there is an R rated version, it's probably only missing two or three minutes of footage.

I don't recommend this one.",1093996800,12,1089,4.69109947643979
