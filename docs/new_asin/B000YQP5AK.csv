I'm not much for religious stuff, but I was going through the six ""live"" TV broadcasts on Disc 12 of Mill Creek's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Historic-Classics-50-Movie-Pack/dp/B000A2WMNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Historic Classics 50 Movie Pack</a>&nbsp;today. All that was left when I got up to prepare for another work night was The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and The Nativity. I chose the latter and watched it between 9:30 and 10:30 pm.

This program should be recreated and shown during the holiday season. A STUDIO ONE broadcast from 1953, it was adapted directly from the mystery cycle that was performed annually in York and Chester, England in the 14th and 15th Centuries.

Done completely in verse using the archaic English of pre-Shakespearean times, this play is both moving and very impressive for a live performance. The Robert Shaw Chorale sings quietly in the background songs of praise from that Medieval era, thus all but two were new to my ears, ""O Come, Emmanuel"" and just the melody (no voices) of ""What Child is This?""

An actor playing one of the three kings wore a costume right out of a deck of playing cards. Looked like he posed for the King of Hearts.

Well, you know the general story. An angel comes to Mary; she and husband Joseph leave for Jerusalem where all the inns are full; the kings visit Herod, who's outraged by their claim that a new king has just been born; four shepherds are awakened by the angel Gabriel and they set out to see the child. They're first to arrive and give their humble gifts. The youngest has nothing for Jesus but his heart, which may be the best present of all. Then the three kings worship, giving gold, incense and myrrh, the latter in a gorgeous lidded box is to be placed with Jesus in his tomb. (I never knew that!) Angel Gabriel warns the kings not to return to Herod but to go directly home, as that angered monarch intends to have murdered all the newborn boys of Israel. Gabriel comes to Joseph in his sleep, tells him to flee to Egypt with Mary (who is dressed like a nun) and the child (that we never see), and stay there until Herod has died. And that's how it ends.

All told in lovely rhyme that's sometimes quite clever.
An example from the first shepherd to speak after they're bathed in a heavenly glow:

Oh, what is all this light here
That makes so bright here on my black beard?
For to see this light here a man may be afright here
And I am afeared!

So it's only minutes later, the middle of February and time to drive to work. During my previous morning commute home I switched the car radio from AM (which is where it's always kept) to a local classical FM station. That station was still tuned in when I started the car. The first thing that comes on is a jazzy piano and violin  interpretation of the melody heard during the manger scene, ""What Child is This?"" The announcer later apologized for playing out of season a carol from Chick Corea, but justified it by stating the obvious, that this tune is also known as ""Greensleeves.""

I love those eerie and improbable coincidences.",1391990400,2,3359,4.76592082616179
