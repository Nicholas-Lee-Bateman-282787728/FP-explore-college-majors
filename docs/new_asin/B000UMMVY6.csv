8213876,5,B000UMMVY6,"ICBMs, MIRVs, nuclear-armed submarines, cruise missiles, supersonic bombers - all have played a role in a dangerous world.  Even after the '91 end of the Cold War, about 20,000 nuclear missiles are aimed at Russia and the U.S.  A '95 peaceful Norwegian missile launch almost prompted a Russian launch that could have resulted in 189 million killed on both sides in 30 minutes.

The U.S. has disassembled 58,000 nuclear weapons and the released fissile material is closely monitored.  Serious questions, however, exist on Russia's ability to monitor its nuclear stockpile (persons with stolen nuclear materials have been arrested about 16 times in Europe), and its 540,000 formerly employed nuclear scientists are tempting employees for rogue nations seeking to build a bomb.

Global Warming is the second major threat examined by ""Doomsday Tech.""  Rising sea levels, stronger storms represent serious threats from having more CO2 in the atmosphere now than at any time in the last 45 million years - a fact directly linked to rising temperatures over the last century.  Ironically, another likely problem is the interruption of the Gulf Stream's heating of northern Europe.

A related problem is that the world is running out of cheap oil.  Fertilizers and mechanized agriculture, foundations of the Green Revolution, will be threatened.  Alternative energy sources (wind - capable of providing 10X all our needs and now offering costs comparable to coal, and solar) are the two major alternatives.",1224115200,,1498,5.309322033898305
