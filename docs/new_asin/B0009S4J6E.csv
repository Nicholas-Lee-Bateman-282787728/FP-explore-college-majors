The hi/lo portion is way too low impact and a bit boring, but the step + abs section will give you a good quick and fun workout.",1231113600,,284,4.089285714285714
8065957,4,B0009S4J6E,"You will sweat doing this DVD.  I like the fact that the instructions are cued well, the music is interesting and the aerobic section is long enough to get a good sweat. (About 60 minutes of aerobics) I also like the fact that you can skip the second aerobic section if short on time.
I thought that some of the step movements were a bit too dancy (turn and the step, back off, step, half off again etc.) and could be dangerous on carpet or on a higher step, but this is not a beginner DVD, so hopefully experienced steppers will modify.
Other than that, this is a good DVD to get your heart rate up and keep it up!",1198108800,,615,4.125
