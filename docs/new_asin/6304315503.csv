7867670,5,6304315503,"This is the first of the Torre-era MSG Networks-produced annual season recap videos. (They also did it in 98 and 99, didn't in 2000 because of the feud between MSG and Steinbrenner's new YES network, nor in 97 nor '01 b/c they didn't win the World Series...) Al Trautwig narrates the entire season, beginning with the opening of Legends Field in Tampa, Rise of the Rookie (Derek Jeter's Rookie of the Year season), the fine year of Andy Pettitte, Doc Gooden's no-hitter, Tino Martinez stepping into Don Mattingly's shoes, and of course the nail-biting World Series versus the Braves, capped off with Wade Boggs riding the horse around the field, and the first tickertape parade in a long time! Includes interview bits with David Cone, Bernie Williams, Paul O'Neill, Mariano Rivera, etc. with bits of play byplay by Phil Rizzuto in his last year in the broadcast booth. Unlike a World Series video, this recaps the whole season.",1013040000,,927,4.8734177215189876
