It should be priced at $5.00 or less. I've seen VHS tapes of this movie look better. Its unusual because MGM Home Video usually does better with DVD.",1075852800,5,314,4.25
759199,5,6303920098,"Well, the movie has its pros and cons, but for myself, it's worth the dough because Jimmy Page wrote the soundtrack. End of story!!!  Look for live concert recordings of Jimmy Page when he went solo in 1988, there are a handful of songs done live that originally were released on this sound track.",1070323200,,297,4.5
759200,1,6303920098,"Like the Rambo films, this drivel is a prime example of why NOT to make a sequel to perfectly good original. Indeed, as Margaret Hinxman wrote in the Daily Mail, Death Wish 2 is ""The sort of sequel that makes you realise that the original wasn't half so bad as you thought"".
In this one the plot is identical. The twist is that it's set in a different city. A bunch of crooks attack his family again. The difference is that whereas in the original the rape scene was a not too graphic short sharp shock, in this film it is leeringly drawn out. Is this to show how vile crime and criminals are? Perhaps. Does it feel shoehorned in for pervs? Certainly.
After this Kersey goes on the rampage again, and this is where the film gets silly. Part of the strength of the original Death Wish film is that Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) never actually tracks down the crooks who attack his family. Whilst condoning vigilantism, it still feels a little hollow that those guys got away. Like the brilliant, but criminally unavailable 'Joe' with Peter Boyle, there is an emptiness to the revenge.
Here, Kersey is trawling Los Angeles looking for targets. Now I haven't been to L.A., but I imagine it's pretty big. You know, you're not too likely to keep bumping into the same people at random. Well, you're not Charles Bronson. While out one night, Kersey stumbles across the same hoodlums who attacked him earlier in the film! Fancy that. As if this stroke of luck was not enough, later on he's strolling around when he hears a scream. He goes to investigate and, in the peculiar haze of sexual violence in which this film operates (there is one gang rape, one rape and another attempted rape), he comes across a rape. But, get this, the rapists are some of the gang who attacked him earlier!
Now how's that for luck!
It gets one star for two reasons. First, the hilarious bit when Laurence 'Othello' Fishburne tries to shelter from machine gun fire behind his ghetto blaster (it doesnt work), and second, I cant give it less.",1069545600,4,2014,4.550964187327824
759201,5,6303920098,"This film is arguably the most revolting ever made in cinematic history. It's cheap, amateurish, reactionary, depraved, excessively violent with no acting and the mere remnants of a script. The product of a sick, warped, and twisted mind.

759202,5,6303920098,"Apparently the punks in L.A know nothing about Bronson and how he'll turn you into Bisquick if you harass his family(or what's now left of it).  Yup, this time around he's moved to the city of angels with his catatonic daughter, but the vacation ends quickly.  In a stroke of rotten luck(which Bronson excels in), his home is broken into(AGAIN!!) and Lawrence Fishburne and a few other assorted punks kidnap and rape his daughter(AGAIN!!!), but not before assaulting the housekeeper.  Well, since not all of her dogs are barking this time, his daughter decides to kill herself before more harm can come to her.  Naturally, Bronson doesn't like this much.  He gives one of his  ol' ""Gosh darn it, I'm gonna have to slaughter more punks"" looks, and away we go.  He's alot less awkward about it this time around, coz he's an old hat at this now.  The rest is pretty much what you'd expect from this kind of thing.  By the end of the film, his newly acquired girlfriend ditches him coz she finds out who he really is.  This guy has zero luck with women.  And what's with all these commie schmucks whining about how ""disgusting"" and ""violent"" this film is?  Sure this movie goes for the throat, but haven't we all seen worse in terms of violence?  If you ask me, the torture scene in Reservoir Dogs pretty much tops anything you see here.  That's the problem with action films anymore-They are way too tame with violent and intense subject matter that's not supposed to be tame at all!  ...",1046131200,5,1485,4.571969696969697

759204,2,6303920098,Former action superstar Charles Bronson and director Michael Winner made some great (and a few entertainingly not so great) movies together.  This is not one of them.  The sad fact is that Death Wish 2 is a vile and disgusting pile of cinematic sexual sadism.  It features one of the most brutal and graphically disturbing rape sequences ever captured on film.  Making matters worse is the grainy porno film production values.  An all time low for the Bronson/Winner team.  Strictly for fans of I Spit on Your Grave.,1007510400,25,516,4.806818181818182

Paul is now living in L.A. with a new life, it seems, but his daughter is still left in a comatose state from the first movie. Well, things get dicey and Paul resorts to his usual tricks to find the perpetrators.
The movie looks good and I think this is the best available version it is going to be on HD. Although, I would have liked a 5.1 mix as the MGM DVD has that. Still, I will take this version by Shout Factory over the MGM one. Well done SF!
Now, if we can get perhaps 3 and 4 this way, I would be happy. I like all of them.
The UNRATED VERSION is about 3 Minutes longer than the THEATRICAL. It basically has more of the ""rape"" scenes.

759329,3,6303920098,"Film critic and you tube sensation Rob Ager delved into DEATH WISH II a while back, making a spirited case in praise of the film as an effective thriller with more thought behind it than its many detractors have given it credit for.  While I don't altogether share Agers enthusiasm for the film, he raises a lot of interesting issues and its because of his study that I returned to this film at all.  I found a more positive appreciation for it than I experienced when I first saw the film long ago.

Director Michael Winner famously tosses out the character study and nuance of the original DEATH WISH, opting instead to deliver an extremely graphic and fast-paced revenge thriller.  The film finds Paul Kersey living, not in Chicago as the original film promised, but in Los Angeles.  More intriguingly, he has resigned from vigilantism, apparently opting to reimmerse himself in bourgeois society.  Hes working as an architect, courting a TV reporter (Jill Ireland, in a much lambasted role), and keeping hope alive that his daughters fractured psyche may one day heal from the trauma she suffered in the first film.

All of that comes flying apart, as the film delivers Kersey a Biblically terrifying fate.  A brief confrontation with a street gang prompts the motley punks to opt for nuclear escalation, home invading his residence and, by turns, gang raping and killing his housekeeper and his daughter.  These events unfold upon the screen in agonizing, drawn-out detail, and the severe revulsion they induce in the viewer must account for most of the films battered reputation.

If this were STRAW DOGS, the same horrifying choreography of brutality mightve passed muster with the critics.  Winners decision to frontload his B-movie revenge flick with such a prolonged sequence of violation and depravity is not easy to stomach, especially given how much of the subsequent action seems unrealistic or outright jokey.  Yet its hard to deny a certain horrible truth to the depiction of these events: to these dead-end nihilists, its all a sick lark, pretty much as it is to the hoodlums of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.  Granting that Michael Winner is no Kubrick or Peckinpah, can he be defended for assaulting the viewer with such suffering?  Regardless of the films limitations, Winner seems to take seriously the theme that, if society cannot resolve to control and properly punish violent crime, somebody else will (and perhaps even SHOULD) do so.  Given the implications of such a thesis, perhaps Winner was judicious in coating his case in the sleazy trappings of an exploitation flick.

Broken and then steeled by these tragic events, Kersey returns to vigilantism with extreme prejudice.  He tracks down the gang members with almost surreal ease, stalking them down through an urban jungle which leaves them as exposed as fish in a barrel.  Winner employs some sly humor in these scenes, as when Lawrence Fishburnes attempt to use his boom box as a shield proves less than satisfactory for him.  These brain-dead punks don't stand much of a chance!

In a subplot to tie this film back to the original, Detective Ochoa returns, apparently intent upon a cynical resolution to law enforcements longstanding Kersey embarrassment, but finds some redemption in a scene in which, curiously, the surviving gang members are about to score a huge shipment of armaments.  This detour into THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS territory is the films most nonsensical one, and I cant defend it except as a chance to sneak in a big shootout.  Oh well, amusing to watch though.

DEATH WISH II draws out the climax by granting the last surviving gang member a reprieve thanks to the broken legal system, in spite of his PCP-fueled manhandling of a bevy of cops.  This provides Winner some of his best visual jokes in the film: first, the hilarious image of Nirvanas topless girlfriend blissed out listening to her headphones, oblivious to the mayhem going on around her as her beau is knifing cops and getting multiply tasered.  And second:  well, lets just say that when Paul Kersey makes a sneaky visit to the psych ward to check in on Nirvana, the electrifying conclusion provides an ironic commentary on the job the courts shouldve been doing in the first place.

Its a sordid and disturbing ride, told at a breakneck pace that sometimes involves film editing so abrupt as to seem almost avant-garde.  Its absolutely not a film for all audiences or tastes, and you could easily argue that its message was better made by the original DEATH WISH or by a number of other films.  The rape scenes themselves are, if this makes sense, ""well-acted"" (and undoubtedly emotionally demanding, especially for the actresses) but the rest of the film is played woodenly.  Stoic Bronson is iconic, but I think Winner knew he'd have to work around certain limitations and let him do here what he does best.  Still, I find a certain level of thought and grim intelligence at work in the film that, in spite of its questionable taste and rough patches, makes it worth consideration by fans of the genre or simply by those who take the horrors of crime seriously.  Much about this film is not realistic, but its portrayal of the wickedness of violent crime seems real enough.  Perhaps its most provocative puzzle is that, compared to what those nearest to Paul Kersey have to suffer in this life, the fate he metes out in return to their afflicters is merciful and just.",1494028800,,5428,4.877995642701525

759331,5,6303920098,"Its been a while coming but here you can now view the unrated version along side the R rated cut.
I can remember when this movie was released in the UK and the then named British Board of Film Censors demanded that Michael Winner cut some scenes. To my recollection he did remove a scene and re-edit others in the 2 rape sequences.
You can now view what Winner originally filmed in the unrated cut.
Please be warned they are graphic even by todays standards. One wonders how Winner thought he could get this version passed the censor at the time. Even now  I very much doubt if this version will be released in the UK.
The rest of the film is "" pure Death Wish "" as Bronson as Paul Kersey goes about finding those responsible for killing his daughter and maid and despatching them to their premature deaths.
The disc by Shout factory is a very good transfer considering the age of film. This one is for the fans of the series despite the graphic material at the start of the film.
I can remember Winner being interviewed about the violence in the movie. He replied that he thought that Death Wish 2 was "" a harmless little thriller""

The movie basically consists of the Bronson character finding and eliminating those original five intruders.

But this satisfaction is incomplete. While the perpetrators rely on rape and slow deaths from beatings or knifings, Bronson's revenge consists mostly of a dying process from bullets which lasts a minute or two.

759561,1,6303920098,"Charles Bronson returns as architect/ vigilante Paul Kersey, seeking to  mete out lethal justice to the lawless. Following a number of endeavors  in projects that did not quite equal or surpass the domestic gross of  the 1974 release Death Wish, Bronson and director Michael Winner reunite for Death Wish II.
  Now residing in Los Angeles, Kersey seems  to have established a new  life. His daughter (Robin Sherwood), rendered a virtual vegetable in the  original appears to be making slight progress. Kersey has also found  romance anew in the form of a radio reporter (Bronson's off-screen wife,  Jill Ireland). Apparently he hasn't found trouble--or at least not much  of it.
  That all changes one afternoon while on outing with his girlfriend and  daughter when a posse of punks purloin his wallet. Kersey shows he is  not one to be trifled with. The predators find his address and again the  Kersey home is invaded. Kersey's cleaning lady is killed, his daughter  kidnapped, and following  a brief bid for freedom, she too dies a  horrible death. Kersey figures that efforts by LAPD will be as fruitless  as the NYPD in the first films. He returns to his no-nonsense approach  to those who have darkened his door. And what follows is essentially a  retread of the original. Different place; virtually the same story; and  virtually the same results.
  Credit (or perhaps blame might be more appropriate in this instance)  should go to Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus, the profiteers...er  producers who purchased the rights from Dino DeLaurentiis. Too bad the  funds weren't better spent. The final product looks cheap. Sadly,  director Winner hasn't taken a cue from either Francis Coppola or Irvin  Kershner, who were responsible for the follow-ups to The Godfather and  Star Wars, which were arguably better than their predecessors.
  Bronson was probably prompted by the paycheck. No doubt such was the  reason for Vincent Gardenia who, apart from Bronson, is the only  returning cast member. Anthony Franciosa and J.D. Cannon offer rather  sub par work in cameos as the Los Angeles D.A. and his Manhattan  counterpart, Cannon looks a bit irate (perhaps due to his impression of  the script). He looks like he's still trying to rein in Dennis Weaver on  ""McCloud."" Franciosa appears befuddled and no doubt due to same. The two of them are no doubt looking forward to an escape on the  small screen to ""Fantasy Island,"" a cruise on ""The Love Boat,"" or a trek  to South Fork on ""Dallas.""
  Bronson, despite entering his sixties, still is a formidable presence  onscreen with or without a gun. Still, it's too bad he hasn't been given  a solid script. Ireland turns in a rather dull performance too. granted  her thespiatic turns have never come close to making her among the  noted leading ladies of cinema. Here it was probably just another  opportunity to work with her husband. Though her work with him in Hard Times and especially From Noon Till Three are far more worthwhile. Offering really nothing new, as such seems to be par for the course with sequels, Death Wish II is basically a waste of time and film. It's a crude carbon copy of the original.",1472428800,,3164,4.881132075471698

Well, you're gonna meet him..."" or the very simple ""Goodbye"" as he looks down on him and puts a bullet between his eyes.  Even with much of the violence edited out, DW2 is still worth watching.  I'd say the franchise was still trying to find itself when this was made, and eventually became more of an action series in the subsequent DW films.  Still, the moral of the story is to never, ever antagonize a mild-mannered architect.",1431820800,,713,4.709677419354839

It seems destiny wants Frank to go back to cleaning up the streets, and events unfold that make him pick up his gun and look for scum. This time, he goes after a specific gang of thugs (one of whom is Laurence Fishburne with his macho pink sunglasses). The NYPD is afraid the LAPD will figure out they just let Kersey go, so they send Det. Frank Ochoa to convince Kersey to stop. This time the bad guys are meaner, tougher and have more guns.

760320,2,6303920098,"I grew up with this series and loved it when I was a teenager in the 80s.  Watching it again several decades later, it's wincingly difficult to watch.  The bad guys are caricatures, and the violence against Kersey's family is really over-the-top.  Yeah, yeah, yeah: I know this series was the precursor to modern-day revenge flicks like Taken with Liam Neeson, but it's still hard to watch.  And it's not because of the slow 1970s pacing.  Taxi Driver came out only 2 years after the first Death Wish and still remains a classic.  Why is Taxi Driver still so fascinating to watch?  Why is Death Wish so cringeworthy?  The lack of subtle character development, the comic book plot line, the lack of believable characters and unrealistic dialog all jerk you out of the trance and remind you that you are watching a movie from the 1970s.  Even the violence is unsatisfying.  It's very by-the-numbers as Kersey just shoots the bad guys like it's part of his boring 9-to-5 job.  There's no satisfaction to the revenge killings.  Both Taxi Driver and Death Wish flirt with the theme of racism either on the nose or tangentially but I'll leave it to the viewer to decide how they feel about its handling.",1429142400,,1197,4.6746411483253585

760360,5,6303920098,"DEATH WISH II is another classic by the Cannon producers
MGM previously released this on blu-ray for the first time ever, tragically it was the cut version at 88mins
well Shout factory got the rights to Death wish II and finally released this film
 in Unrated cut version on blu-ray run time 91mins as DEATH WISH II SPECIAL EDITION
the first time ever the Unrated version has been officially released on blu-ray
but shout factory also included the usual Theatrical version anyway on the same Disc
which makes no sense to me i'll be watching the Unrated version
i haven't seen the HD transfer of the theatrical version i wasn't interested
i can only comment on the new 1:85:1 HD transfer for the Unrated version which does look excellent
Shout factory made a big effort to clean up the picture quality for sure, No Grain or Dirt
tragically they didn't do the same for the sound quality,
it's only a master audio 2.0 stereo mix
which does sound much better than the old Mono sound the 2.0 master stereo mix is definitely a boost in quality
but a 5.1 master mix would've been much, much better for sure
and for the first time ever new extras for Death Wish II
there's no new retrospective featurette, there can't be anyway
Charles bronson & Actress Jill ireland passed away over 20 years ago now
Director Michael winner died few years ago aswell otherwise Michael winner might've been interviewed for this blu-ray reissue
and the Cannon producers also passed away few years ago
and Actress Robin sherwood who played Carol kersey in the film wasn't interested in a interview about the film
Robin left the movie business after Death wish II
so instead shout factory got a new audio commentary with Paul Talbot author of Bronson's Loose the Death wish films
Paul talks takes the commentary very seriously there's no joking around unlike some commentaries i've heard
that are not worth listening to
Paul talks in Great detail about the movie itself the difference between the Theatrical & Unrated cut
Paul talks about the casting very specifically, Charles bronson and his wife Jill Ireland, Robin sherwood
Paul talks about the rape scenes and Michael winner's approach to them and other Great info about the film
one of the best commentaries i've heard actually worth listening to for sure
apart from that just the usual original Theatrical trailer is added
and there's also reversible sleeve cover art either choose the new 2016 cover or switch around for the
original Theatrical poster artwork which says Bronson's Loose again Death wish II
i switched it around myself i prefer the original cover art
so worth buying the new Shout factory special edition blu-ray, not the MGM blu-ray
5 stars for the SF blu-ray based on new Unrated version HD transfer & new extra

760421,5,6303920098,"This is a cut version, try to shop around and get the uncut version.

  I saw this one, and the 3rd movie when I was really young probably around the time it came out in theaters.  This series is a very dark and violent one so be warned the subject matter isn't politically correct, nor was the late Charles Bronson.

 What I can state about this series is I do like the idea of a lone wolf hero (or anti-hero) on a mission to gain justice & avenge the crimes against his family, saving the city that is under siege by the worst criminal scum ever.

Charles Bronson is fantastic as the lone wolf victim turned into a vigilante because of the high crime rate, and crooked system. This is a very violent, and dark film but never the less they really do not make action adventure ""police crime"" dramas like this as much anymore. Both the first film, Death Wish 2 and 3 are all vicious ""crime-violance"" orientated movies, though there are some continuity errors.

 I remember seeing this franchise years back, and like other ""tough guy takes on the worst criminal villains"" movies like the ""Batman"" films, any cop movie involving the late John Wayne, & finally the ""Dirty Harry"" franchise of Clint Eastwood fame I really was taken with this series as a boy.

 Charles Bronson was an awesome actor, and great man where his intense action films really represented the struggle of ""everyman"" against the dark sinister elements in this world.

This movie is very dated, & one could say it endorses vigilantism; thus it is a form of fantasy wish fulfillment, with Bronson acting act on film what many good men would like to do to the crooks of the world, but in the name of justice and not resorting to anarchy we simply cannot take the law in our own hands.  As a fantasy movie it is enjoyable to watch.

Was concerned when I saw that this collection was produced by TGG Direct, for their boxes of public domain films are pretty shabby picture and soundwise. But I'm pleased to report that transfers here are widescreen, clean-looking and near-studio quality.

As for the contents...
DEATH WISH 3 is almost laughable. Bronson takes on an army of about 200 slum creeps and comes away without a scratch, while in video game fashion he greases countless dozens of them.

If not for an over-the-top last scene, 10 TO MIDNIGHT would be darn good.

DEATH WISH 4 is competent, even if it does rehash plot points of previous editions.

THE MECHANIC is the best here. Good twist at the end.

Returning: Charles Bronson and Vincent Gardenia.

When we last left Paul Kersey in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Wish-HD/dp/B009L7QO6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Wish [HD</a>] (1974), he had mourned the death of his wife and was worried about his daughter Carol, who was still in shock after being attacked and raped. After Paul was shot by a hoodlum, Inspector Frank Ochoa could not arrest Paul for being a vigilante, but told him firmly to get out of New York City. And so Paul went to Chicago, Illinois.

Now it is seven years later. Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) is in Los Angeles, California. He visits his daughter, Carol (now played by Robin Sherwood). Paul, along with his lady-friend, Geri (Jill Ireland) and Carol spend the day together. They go to Olvera Street. Paul offers to go get some ice cream. Five hoodlums: Jiver (Stuart K. Robinson), Punkcut (E. Lamont Johnson), Cutter (Laurence Fishburne), Nirvana (Thomas F. Duffy), Stomper (Kevyn Major Howard), steal from a woman and push into Paul. They all run and Paul chases after one of them into an alley. The hoodlum brings out his pocket knife, but Paul stops it with a cardboard box, He roughs up the black man against the wall and takes the knife and throws it. Paul leaves the alley and goes back to Olvera Street. Geri and Carol had no idea what happened. Paul then takes Carol on a sailboat ride in San Pedro.
  Meanwhile, the hoodlums have Paul's wallet and they go to his address. They break into the house and attack the maid, Rosario (Silvana Gallardo). All five hoodlums rape her.  When Paul and Carol arrive home, the hoodlums attack and kidnap Carol.

  Also in the cast: Vincent Gardenia, J.D. Cannon, Robert L. Lyons, Anthony Franciosa, Peter Pan, Henny Yougman, Don Moss, Paul McCallum, Charles Cyphers.

Bronson's scriptwriters give him edgier lines.  He asks a young punk he is about to execute upon seeing him fiddle with a cross on a necklace, ""Do you believe in Jesus?""  When the punk answers in the affirmative, Kersey quips, ""You're gonna meet him.""

C.B's acting is gripping as usual. Besides that, the acting of the last bad guy is scary and convincing. The last fighting is intense, bloody and terrifying.

The ending is surprising. I did not see it coming.

It's not as suspenseful as the first picture.

The worst thing about this film is some unacceptable logical holes as big as houses.
For example, 60 minutes in to the movie, C.B. and the police inspector with only 2 hand guns, successfully fought off 6 guys with 2 sub machine guns, 1 rifle, and 3 hand guns. C.B killed 4 guys with the sub machine guns and hand guns. The inspector killed one. The shooting scene looked awkward, fake and ridiculous.

760786,2,6303920098,"""Death Wish"" was a great film because you got to know Paul Kersey and his family before they were taken away from him.  You really felt for the guy and rooted for him when he went on his killing spree as a vigilante in New York.  In ""Death Wish II"", Kersey has relocated to Los Angeles and has a new girlfriend.  His traumatized daughter is living in a mental hospital.  Early in the film, Kersey has a run-in with a group of thugs who steal his wallet.  As a result, they go to his home and kill his housekeeper.  When he and his daughter arrive home, the thugs beat him unconscious and abduct his daughter and things go south from there.  Kersey goes on another revenge killing spree in the mean streets of L.A.  The main problem I have with this film is it is so shallow.  There is no real character development.  You don't ever get to know the characters very well so you can really care about them.  The thugs are so cartoonishly portrayed that they are more ridiculous than really threatening.  The only thing I really liked in this film was the score composed by Jimmy Page.

The studio thankfully did NOT 'grain-rape' this older film and so yes, we have real film grain of the 35mm stock of that era. The picture is somewhat soft, but looks like it should. Many studios are using Digital Noise Reduction to remove grain, resulting in a smeared, wax like picture devoid of life and detail. Thank heavens that did not happen here.

Actually '3' masters of this movie, if you want to count the one made for T.V., which had been even more censored.

For years, this was not talked about, however it's now in black & white, documented
on the International Movie Database, (IMDB). A cut and uncut version of this movie. Read for yourself...

[..]

If this link winds up getting 'censored' out of the review, go to the IMDB web site, do the search for the title and scroll down to an FAQ listed on the page, specificaly asking, ""How many different versions do exist of this movie?""

There is some very informative, extremely detailed information between the different versions, including scene pictures and exact discriptions of those scenes.

Thanks IMDB for putting this information in black & white, so all would know the truth!

-----------

I had watched the `original' version of this movie when it had first came out on VHS, rented out of a video store. Wanting to add this to my collection, I purchased a copy for myself, but it wasn't the same movie that the video store had. It was a cut up version of the movie.

I had searched for years, trying to find that original, and never did find it. Even going through dealers and companies that were buying out the complete stock of video stores that fell under the Blockbuster boom and were forced out of business.

I do remember at one point, being so frustrated in my search, contacting Orion Studios as they had owned the rights to that movie at that time. Don't know which studio currently owns the rights to this movie now, but when talking to someone at Orion, explaining that there has seemed to be `two' versions of this movie, they were completely unaware of this, thinking they had the original master of it.

So there's for sure, `at least' two masters of this movie floating around out there in movieland. So who has the real original? Who cut it up, and created a different master for distribution and resell?

I can probably understand why the original was cut up as it was. Because of the censorship back then, it could have got tagged with an `X' rating. The rape scene in the original was extremely violent, including some nudity, that wasn't very common back in those days for anything with less than an `X' rating.

There were many movie makers that got called before the censorship board, being `threatened' with that `X' rating unless the movie was recut. Which I understand still goes on today.

Those `movie makers', studios, producers, directors and actors don't want their movies tagged with that `X' rating, back then, and even today. Even though scenes in some movies today, could be considered `tame' as compared to that one little scene in Death Wish II.

I'm quite sure if that movie was released in its original version today, there wouldn't be any censorship issues, considering what is being released today under `R' or `NC-17' ratings.

Personally I believe if any movie today did get tagged with an `X' rating, it would certainly draw more attention, although limiting its audience of those younger masses, that purchase the majority of movie tickets today.

When is the world going to realize that 16 and 17 year old kids are exposed to a whole lot more these days, in regards to sex, violence and language, than when us older folk were at their age!

The `age of consent' in most states is 17, (some states even younger than that). So what out government is saying is that kids at 17 years old can openly have sex and it's perfectly legal. At 18, kids can join the military, go off to foreign countries half way around the world, and sacrifice their lives for this country.

But yet they can't yet even vote for those `policy makers' that would put an M-16 in their hands, and send them half way around the world to `kill or be killed'.

To shoot someone in the head, see their brain matter splatter all over the place, toss a grenade and see body parts scatter, with blood and guts a common sight in the streets, and for `real'. We all see that in movies these days, they experience it in real life.

But yet they can't watch an X rated movie? Makes a lot of sense when they themselves can have legal sex at 17, but can't watch or rent a movie, and watch others have sex until they're 21.

Where is the logic of our policy makers! If an 18 year old kid can be put in the middle of some idiotic, political war, risk their lives and limbs over some `political agendas', then they should have that right to vote, and watch any damn movie they want to!

Anyway, whoever has that original, uncut version of this movie, hidden away in some vault somewhere, get it re-released and make a ton of money from it.",1304812800,8,4676,4.5536992840095465
760902,5,6303920098,"I bought this one after enjoying the first Death Wish movie. A totally underrated series of movies by a great actor in his days of American fame. One can tell that this is an 80s movie. The first movie was more classical in terms of music and dress style. The guns are more serious and the victims of bronson more targeted. Unlike the first one, he actually targets the attackers of his daughter. Why Bronson never thought of moving to Alaska, i don't know. Bronson in this movie, doesnt look as classy or vulnerable looking as in the first. He looks very bad ass to put it politely. Just about all the muggers are armed this time around, but as always Bronson knows how to line up the sights. The music by my lz man, Jimmy Page was pretty damned good. Appropriate for a revenge killing movie. Enjoy, but skip forward 15 minutes after the intro, its not important and you avoid the rape scene. Much more horrible than in the first movie.",1304121600,,937,4.421965317919075

I agree somewhat it would be nice to have this movie uncut, and widescreen. But according to movie censor reviews this was the best print MGM could find, and the rape scene being trim was not do to censorship. The movie is still a must own. Death Wish 2 Bronson's daughter is still traumatize about being rape. Bronson is confronted with a couple of thugs who steals his wallet got his address. The thugs go to his address raped the maid, and kidnaped his daughter. The daughter get raped again, and wind up killing herself by jumping out the window onto a fence. Bronson goes after these thugs one by one. It 's a great movie from beginning to end. MGM release a lot a good titles some cut some unrated. Like the movie Deranged was cut, but From Beyond, The Burning wasn't. Even with some scenes trimmed you still get a excellent movie.

And as for your censoring of my media, well let's just say I think the fact you cut out parts of the movie that existed in the original is unacceptable. This is a pathetic, censored, cut version of the original film, and it should be noted on the front of every DVD you butcher that you butchered it in BOLD PRINT.

760944,2,6303920098,"After a brief spurt of competence in the late 60s and early 70s, Michael Winner's inherent laziness took over in the 80s to such a degree that Death Wish II doesn't even look like it was made by the same people who made the first Death Wish. Flat lighting, clumsy editing, a hilariously overwrought score from Jimmy Paige and a feeling that everyone got so bored during the first take they rarely bothered to go for another, it seems clearly aimed more at the lascivious street scum Charles Bronson polishes off than the frustrated citizens with handguns who get pushed too far (again) - Winner sure does love him a rape scene, even in a heavily censored version (in the uncensored version he almost plays it as comedy). With novelist Brian Garfield so unhappy with how the first film turned out that he refused to sell the rights to his sequel Death Sentence (later filmed as an unrelated Kevin Bacon film), Winner got round it by reworking the plot of the first film but moving the action from New York to LA (Kelsey would commute between the two cities for the subsequent sequels). Unfortunately adding the ever-insipid Jill Ireland to the mix, it still just about passes muster even if it delivers a particularly underwhelming finale, and gains some points for the scene where Bronson's vigilante and Vincent Gardenia as the cop following him find themselves both being shot at by street punks, but it's a fair bet Laurence Fishburne is deeply embarrassed by his excruciatingly stereotyped street scum.

760947,4,6303920098,"I'm at a point in my life where watching movies like this kind of goes against my nature. But that said, this is probably a better movie than a lot of people would like to admit. very quickly, these movies were made at a time when people felt helpless, and people wanted a hero like the dangerous architect.

Charles Bronson never really looks for trouble, but it has a way of finding him. Many would chalk this up as of course being required for the sequel, but there is some realism to this. (The character who doesn't look for trouble, but is often found by trouble.) The movie wastes little time. Charles visits his injured daughter (from part 1) and is trying to start his life over. He runs into some thugs, but Charles flips the tables on them. Not being too bright, the thugs decide to give Charles more trouble by raping his housekeeper and kidnapping his daughter. (I say not too bright because if they had left town, they probably would have gotten away. But by kidnapping, they have now involved themselves in a Federal offense.)

Charles's daughter dies soon afterwards. As expected, Charles gets little help from the police. When he says: ""There really isn't any use,"" his intentions are so obvious. What I find interesting about this movie is we can see consequences of actions work both ways. The first is obvious. The thugs that have once bullied Charles (who was just minding his own business) are now reduced to tears as Charles taunts them just a bit before he shoots them. ""Do you believe in Jesus? Well, you're going to meet him."" Another example is when he looks at Jiver, smiles and says: ""Goodbye."" One tragic scene is after Bronson saves an 'almost rape' victim and her husband, and the police seem more concerned with the fact that the assailants were killed than the condition of the surviving victims (who were just minding their own business).

Undoubtedly, many people are cheering Bronson unconditionally at this point. But there is a fine point worth some attention. (Bronson gets darker as he carries through his revenge. One notable point is that he starts to get dishonest with his possible future wife Ireland.) So, the movie does not glorify revenge 100 %. We see that there may be a price Charles Bronson will have to pay. After Charles Bronson puts a gun/drug deal 'to rest,' he has a moment of quiet peace before he goes after the gang leader Charles Wilson. (We can suspect Wilson's absurd trial is just a setup to provide the conclusion the audience wants.) For an insanity plea to work, the client has to have no idea that what he was doing was wrong, and the evidence needs to be clear and convincing.

It is interesting how the final fight is not one sided. Bronson does take some bad hits, and the fight is not 'hollywood polished' either. It is brutal, and we are once again introduced to how disturbing violence can be. Wilson's death is a tad disturbing despite his crimes. While I don't really like action/revenge movies for the most part, I have to grant that this series at least shows the hero may NOT walk off happily into the sunset. He might survive, but he may have to pay a price as well. While ""Death Wish V"" was my favorite, I have to admit this 2nd one was pretty good.",1226275200,3,3231,4.575129533678757
760948,5,6303920098,"DEATH WISH 2 pertains to legendary tough guy Charles Bronson resumes his trademark role as liberal architect & hard-as-nails vigilante avenger(Paul Kersey) who is not your ordinary victim & fights back with a vengeance in this hard-hitting, action-packed sequel! With the murder of his wife and the revenge against her killers now behind him, Kersey moves to the West Coast to start a new life, but tragedy is never far from his door & when a group of local hoods viciously assaults his daughter, they unleash a wrath unlike anything the city has ever seen. Kersey has the face of each of them branded in his memory, and he will not rest until he tracks every one of them down...and puts them all in the ground using the same killing frenzy he did on the East Coast 8 years ago, but unlike this movies predecessor from 1974, every criminal he encounters, Kersey only pursues his families perpetrators this time using a Beretta Model 85 .380 ACP pistol as his favorite weapon.

The beginning of this action flick begins with a news broadcast detailing a big surge in crime in L.A. where Paul now lives, but seems to have picked up the pieces of his life in New York and moved on, now dating and engaged to KABC news/radio reporter Geri Nichols(Jill Ireland)who was Bronson's wife in real-life at the time.

As Paul tries to move on to start a new life on the West Coast, Paul picks up his daughter Carol Anne Kersey(Robin Sherwood)from the hospital after she begins to finally speak again, despite her traumatic catatonia after her husband Jack presumbably left her and then eventually gets raped by gangsters along with Paul's housekeeper Rosario(Silvana Gallardo)before Paul goes on a killing rampage and gets his sweet revenge on all the bigots, especially since the police were failing to catch the crooks and bring them to justice.

The only thing I found to be a shame in this flick was Geri breaks off her engagement to Paul after catching him in a string of lies by finding a copy of a forged ID in the waste basket after hearing the grizzly news on the radio about one of the sleazy thugs Charles Wilson(Thomas Duffy) being killed at the same mental institution where Paul posed as a doctor and realizes that Paul has been lying to her about his whereabouts & was totally unaware of his vigilante lifestyle all along when she started getting suspicious about why Paul was becoming more and more distant from her, but it doesn't make sense why Paul acted like it didn't even faze him that his fiancee had broken off their engagement or his fiancee's reason why, since Paul didn't even look or act heartbroken at all, unlike how most people feel when their engagement is broken off in real-life.

DEATH WISH 2 also brings me all the way back to memory lane to when we had the recession in 1981-1982 since Ronald Reagan was the president when this movie was released for the very first time back in the Winter of 1982.",1221004800,2,2923,4.637065637065637
760949,2,6303920098,"Last we left off with our vigilante hero he had transplanted himself to CHICAGO after being kicked-out of NY. But, here in DEATH WISH II Bronson is firmly routed in LOS ANGELES! No explanation is given as to how or why he ended up in LA?? We quickly find out that the vigilante is up to the same tricks.

This is a leaner meaner Bronson in Death Wish II. He has traded in his trench coat for a Members Only jacket!  As well as taken to hand-to-hand combat. The plot is the same as the first. His poor daughter from the first pic gets even more abuse! Mentally damaged by thugs in the first film. Now, she is again used to illicit blood thirsty vengeance from our hero after the vicious gang rapes her. This time he's battling 80's East LA hoodlums one of which is played by Lawrence Fishburn.

As in the first film Death Wish '74 the racial stereotypes continue. They abound everywhere from the gang members to his house maid. Of course the producers made sure there were token white males also in the  gang. But, it is still a very heavy handed and obvious portrayal or racial stereotypes where minorities are either the  criminals or are busy making tacos.",1211587200,,1158,4.417840375586854
760950,3,6303920098,"The list is as long as it is astounding. Bronson, Norris(as Chuck is short for Charles), Manson, Murphy(as Charlie is short for Charles). Sid could go on all day. This is like a public service announcement: If you meet someone named Charles or any variation, you better be as nice as you can.

We see this horrifying paralell again in Death Wish 2. In fact, you know what? Everything about this movie was horrifying. We, Sid the Elf were shocked that this movie was made in 1982. I mean, if I'm the only one I'll shut up. But this movie had a distinctly 70's feel to it. Maybe it was the curly white man fro on the leader of the gang, or the wierd colors in Bronson's house, or maybe the music. Let's get that out of the way right now. The music in this movie was...atrocious, deplorable, hillarious; you know, they all actually work. It was like the producer couldn't find anybody to do the music and said to himself, ""Well, I did get my 13 year-old nephew that casio keyboard and  synthesizer for Christmas(see? Santa treats everybody right!!!!) he could probably pull it off."" Well, no it is not true. This film was just overpowered with wierd sounding synth music that exagerated every scene in the film. The music situation sums up the whole experiance of watching this movie, really. If you're looking for quality, probably not your first choice. But, if you're looking for some really great, top-notch B look no further.

While there were so many things that made Death Wish 2 b, the one that stood out the most were all the questions this film brought about in Sid's head. For example, how did this black cloud of people antagonizing Bronson follow him cross-country? Isn't it historically unprecidented that guys would just keep finding women in Bronson's life to assault causing him to lash out on both coasts of U.S. and A, greatest country in the world? Why oh why did Bronson's daughter jump out of the window while running away from the men who had just assaulted her?(although, this did open the door to people getting impaled in movies, so it's a wash really.) Is this how life was back then?(Sid was just a baby elf and does not remember the early 80's well.) Did gangs of hooligans go around looking for ugly Mexican housekeepers to force themselves upon? How did they manage to make 5 of these? This is only the second film in the series, so how long did it take Bronson to realize that maybe he should just do everyone a favor and live in the mountains alone, instead of moving from city to city causing mayhem?(Sounds familiar, right? Sid thinks the Real World producers got their idea from the Death Wish series.) Finally, how in the world did Lawrence Fishburne become a successful actor after this?

So, we've just finished watching a little over an hour of people antagonizing Bronson, and him performing a huge amount of vigilante killings. All that's left is for them to wrap everything up in a nice little bow and everyone will be happ--and it just ends. The closing credits rolled as Sid stared at the screen in astonishment. One of the most perplexing/funny moments in Sid's memory when it comes to film. Words really cannot do it justice. It just added another layer to this already wonderful b.

Another thing that was very b, and frankly brought the film to a higher level was Bronson. There is no way, we mean ZERO chance that Bronson memorized a single line for this film with the exception of ""Do you believe in Jesus? You're going to meet him."" They absolutely had cue cards for this one. And Bronson always took that one extra split second to read and deliver his lines. This just added so much to the film and Sid could go on forever, but we digress. So, definitely catch Death Wish if you're looking for extreme b some enjoyable action and Bronson at his finest or his worst depending on your point of view.",1202256000,3,3847,4.569565217391304
760951,4,6303920098,"While it's quite the norm now to make sequels to Rambo, Die Hard, Terminator, etc 15-20 years later, the eight year wait between Death Wish and this seemed interminable. Readers by now know what these films are about. No one will mistake these films for being Oscar nominated, but where they do excel is the need for vengeance fulfilled. And sadly, there aren't any Bronson's in Hollywood today. What I enjoyed about the first two is Charles' believability and physicality. He's running, jumping, shooting and punching and you're rooting for him the entire time. He absolutely looks the part and excels in the role of vigilante. What I find more enjoyable in II is he knows who's responsible this time and expels the criminals one by one with the hospital room fight at the end being the best part of the film. Also, the clearly drawn Clark Kent/Superman parallel of Kersey's architect by day, vigilante by night with change in clothing to further support this. The return of Vincent Gardenia connects both films and the change to Los Angeles makes for a more sinister, but still entertaining city backdrop. Sadly, the sequels following this don't have the same connectivity or craftsmanship as Charles is reduced to standing still with any artillery blazing until he comes off as a mockery of his once potent character.",1201737600,3,1320,4.897321428571429

760953,5,6303920098,"Death Wish II  DVD

By 1982, crime rates were still high enough to warrant another ""Death Wish"" film. Enter ""Death Wish 2,"" a picture that finds New York City vigilante Paul Kersey pulling up roots from the place of his first exile (Chicago) in order to head to sunnier digs in Southern California. Los Angeles provides our architect with a new outlook on life, a place where he can tend to his still mentally and physically damaged daughter Carol (Robin Sherwood in this outing) and his new girlfriend Geri Nichols (Jill Ireland). In fact, Paul and Geri hope to wed one day. Unfortunately, a curse falls on the House of Kersey when a crew of mangy vermin, the most important member being Cutter (Laurence Fishburne), invades our hero's bungalow. The gang brutalizes Kersey's maid Rosario and abducts the shattered Carol. In the process of submitting Paul's daughter to an indignity nearly identical to the horrors she suffered in the first film, the poor young lady takes her life by plunging out of a warehouse window. Predictably, Kersey arrives home to find a deceased Rosario stretched out in the hallway and his daughter gone. Within a few minutes the authorities break the sad news to Paul; they found his daughter's body outside of a known gang hideout. The horrors of New York are starting all over again, and Paul Kersey must once again go forth and battle the forces of evil.

Unlike in the first film, Kersey specifically targets the criminals responsible for the slaying of his daughter. He finds out where they hang out and rents a grungy hotel room in the area to serve as a base of operations. Every night Paul drives down there, dons a knit cap and dark duds, and roams the streets looking for riffraff. As soon as he stumbles over one of the thugs in question, he pulls out a gun and dispatches them with extreme prejudice. The police, led by Lieutenant Mankiewicz (Ben Frank), take note of the sudden rash of killings and start to put the pieces together, namely that a vigilante is working the city streets. Kersey's name soon pops up, thanks to his reputation from New York years earlier, and the authorities bring in Inspector Frank Ochoa (Vincent Gardenia) from the first film to help them put a stop to Paul's rampages. Kersey becomes aware of Ochoa's presence, leading to a cat and mouse game that threatens Paul's ability to wreak vengeance on his enemies. Nonetheless, after a shootout gives Kersey a temporary respite from the attention of the authorities our man continues to hunt down his enemies. He goes so far as to infiltrate a mental hospital to pursue a victim, but his single-minded pursuit carries personal costs in his relationship with Geri Nichols.

It's obvious from the start that the makers of ""Death Wish 2"" went straight for the sleaze effect. The first film sought to examine crime and vigilantism in a serious way, even going so far as to have the Paul Kersey character become physically ill after attacking a criminal. ""Death Wish 2"" throws all introspection out the window, replacing a message with gory deaths and memorable one-liners rivaling anything Dirty Harry ever tossed out. Carol's death scene is particularly tough to watch, as are the atrocities visited upon the poor Rosario. The dialogue is magnificent in an extraordinarily entertaining way. ""Goodbye"" says Paul Kersey immediately before pulling the trigger on a helpless thug twisting in pain on the floor of a warehouse. ""Do you believe in Jesus?"" asks Kersey of another goon, who replies with ""Yes, yes I do."" ""Well, you're going to meet him,"" responds our vigilante as he opens fire. Great stuff! This isn't dialogue churned out by some hack; it's holy scripture chiseled on stone tablets that someone carried down from a mountaintop. If you can get your mind around the idea that ""Death Wish 2"" is completely devoid of a message, you'll love this movie. Too, make sure and listen to the Jimmy Page soundtrack; you'll hear it again in ""Death Wish 3.""

761038,1,6303920098,"As with most great movies, sequelidas has to follow and the original classic , Death Wish was not spared from this. Number two followed eight years later.
Th gang rape scene has to be one of the most gratuitous and unpleasant moments in movie history. I know rape is not supposed to be a pleasurable experience, but was it really necessary to have it as long as it was?  I don't know about anyone else,but I was squirming thorugh this. The rape scene from the first movie was brutal too, but it only lasted a few minutes and was used effectivley in conveying that senseless crime . This scene from Death Wish 2 seems to convey director Michael Winner`s sick fantasies.
Ironically, the actress who played Bronson`s gang -raped maid gives the best peformance of the entire movie. The late Bronson,his wife Jill Ireland(never one of the better actresses in history), and surprisingly, Vincent Gardenia ,turn in weak, ineffective performances. Bronson`s peformance is statuesque and I don't mean on a grand scale..He demonstrates the emotions and range of a statue.
This is poorly directed, cheap and grainy film making if you can call it film making. After the brutalization and murders of his daughter and maid, Bronson embarks on a dreary chase for the thugs in which he surprisingly remembers all their faces from two brief encounters. Predictable results follow, obviously, since there were three more sequels on the way.",1171411200,10,1422,4.925
761039,3,6303920098,"I have to agree with the highlighted review above. This film is very disturbingly graphic in the depiction of the group rape scene. I do have to doubt the validity of that whole scene being there in the first place. It is definitely not for under 18 viewers, and in some cases, not for those weak at heart/ emotions.

That being said, overall , it follows as a decent sequel to Death Wish 1. Not a buy, but you can rent it out on a Saturday night when your bored and definitely *NOT* with your loved one or family..",1164672000,7,515,4.202020202020202

761041,4,6303920098,"Charles Bronson picks up where he left off in the famous ""Death Wish"" movie of 1976, going after punks and eliminating them. The only differences: he's moved from New York to Los Angeles and the violence is more graphic.

Despite the B-movie feel to this (produced by the kings of the cheapo movies of that era (70s and early 80s) : Golan/Globus, it still is very enjoyable and satisfying - if revenge is your thing. Here, Bronson revenges the death of his daughter. At least her death is quick and bloodless, unlike the unpleasant rape-and-murder scene in the first film.

Also, unlike the first film there is no need for a long setup. Bronson gets back in his vigilante mode in a hurry here and never lets up. If you want a short dose (an hour and a half) of action, this is your movie. One of the gang members in here, by the way, is a young Laurence Fishburne.

The negatives are (1) sub-par acting performances by Bronson and his real-life wife, Jill Ireland; (2) some blatant credibility problems with the story ( such as how Bronson could get across town all bloody but never be noticed;) and (3) not exactly the most intelligent dialog!

Yet, this is still an appealing movie to our conditioned satisfaction for instant revenge. So, if you've had a bad day and need a release of your hostilities, this is a good remedy!",1145836800,7,1327,4.539748953974895

BRONSON: Do you believe in Jesus?

PUNK: (terrified, holding up cross as protection) Yes I do.

BRONSON: Good. You're about to meet him.

BLAM. BLAM.

With such strring exchanges of theologically-based dialogue, ""Death Wish II"" was unleashed on American audiences. It was met with a certain amount of horror from critics and a certain amount of delight from audiences, and after 20-odd years that mixture is still valid. If it wasn't, they wouldn't have made so many sequels.

I don't know why so many years stood between the first ""Death Wish"" and the second, only that during the interregnum, director Michael Winner apparently decided that all the serious moral issues of vigilantism had been tackled in the first movie and all the audience really wanted to see from this point forward was Bronson exploding the brains of stupid, loathsome, and badly-dressed criminals. Oh, how right he was.

I remember the original ""Death Wish."" It was an almost unbelievably brutal film, in which a mild-mannered architecht abandons his pacifist convictions and goes on a violent rampage after his wife is murdered and his daughter raped by evil thugs. As a kid, I was shocked by the brutal way Bronson finished off one crook he had already shot in the guts -- firing a coup de grace into his spine while casually stepping over his crawling body. The most haunting feature of the movie is the futility of Bronson's quest -- he never catches the men who violated his family. Perhaps to redress this balance, we got ""DW 2.""

In this flick, Paul Kersey (Bronson) has moved to L.A. and is dating a lovely radio personality who has no clue about his past. His daughter is still semi-comatose after her rape, but her condition is improving. Everything is going well for Chuckie B., and of course, you know that ain't gonna last long.

A gang of mixed-race thugs in ridiculous 80s-era villain costumes (80s movie producers had no idea what gangs were actually dressing like in their own time period, so they combined 50s-era leather biker hats with 60s-era army clothes and threw in some punk and hippie fashions as well....see ""Death Wish 3"") does very bad things to Bronson's daughter and maid. Immediately, he seeks payback while trying to hide the fact from his honey. Wackiness ensues, including one of the greatest cinematic deaths in history which I must now describe:

Black thug, fleeing from Bronson, attempts to use his big-ass boom-box as a shield for his face. Guess what?? Radios do NOT deflect large-caliber bullets. Spectacular scene of radio bursting apart amidst shower of sparks, bullet going into thug's mouth, thug's head bursting in disgusting glut of blood....and me laughing hysterically as thug falls into lamp-post with stupid, shocked look on face. Word to the wise, chump: before you mess w/Chuckie B., invest in some body armor or a large helmet.

The acting in this film is almost horrendously awful, but the writing is worse, with the exception of one great sarcastic line about the police commissioner's wife taking self-defense classes because the crime rate is so bad. The scenes with the cops and DA are so badly acted and shot they look like out-takes or rehearsals somebody taped by accident, and even the camera seems to have been placed at random by some bored grip or assistant DP who had his mind on whatever was in the catering truck. Nor does the plot make any sense. My favorite moment is when the punks go to a major arms deal by city bus. Dude, you can afford $33,000 in exotic weaponry but you can't afford a car? A close second is when the gun dealer's big-ass caddy finds its way over a cliff (found everywhere in downtown LA) and explodes before it hits the ground. Villians really should stop soaking their cars in gasoline before they go to shoot-outs. Third is the scene where Bronson watches the villains bust out horrible dance moves on what appears to be a broken-down carousel in the middle of a park. Couldn't he have found it in his heart to kill them then, before I witnessed the big white oaf do what appears to be a slow motion version of the robot dance?

The most notable feature of ""DW 2"" in relation to the rest of the series is that this may be the only entry where Kersey's girlfriend gets away scot-free. She should consider herself lucky, because most of them get set on fire or dissolved in acid. It's really an unhealthy gig.

Such is ""DW 2,"" a film that never fails to satisfy, if the sight of evil bastards getting shot to bloody goo satisfies you. On a side-note, the blond punk whose real name I can't remember has the distinction of having been immolated by Clint Eastwood in ""Sudden Impact"" and beaten to a pulp and thrown off a roof by Frank Sinatra in an episode of ""Magnum, P.I."" This man might want to engage in some vigilantism himself -- against his agent!",1125273600,7,5045,4.725824800910125

761079,5,6303920098,"A discussion of Charles Bronson that fails to mention the ""Death Wish"" series isn't really a discussion at all. The first entry in this seminal series arrived on the scene in 1974 during a period in American history when all types of crimes skyrocketed. We can thank the moral laxity inflicted on the rest of us by the Counterculture for the increased numbers of murders, arsons, burglaries, robberies, rapes, and countless other forms of physical and mental assaults that soon became common occurrences on every street in the country. A large percentage of the population, referred to by Nixon as ""The Silent Majority,"" ached to find a way to fight back against the vermin committing these atrocities. Since our embrace of vigilante justice faded away due to the abuses of lynching in the South, and our legal system began letting the scum back out on the streets, only Hollywood seemed to offer refuge to the growing number of victims. Enter the revenge and vigilante genre, the most notable entries of which consisted of the Clint Eastwood ""Dirty Harry"" pictures. In these films, a cop or outraged citizen would hunt down criminals outside the law, meting out a savage brand of justice we could all cheer about.

By 1982, crime rates were still high enough to warrant another ""Death Wish"" film. Enter ""Death Wish 2,"" a picture that finds New York City vigilante Paul Kersey pulling up roots from the place of his first exile (Chicago) in order to head to sunnier digs in Southern California. Los Angeles provides our architect with a new outlook on life, a place where he can tend to his still mentally and physically damaged daughter Carol (Robin Sherwood in this outing) and his new girlfriend Geri Nichols (Jill Ireland). In fact, Paul and Geri hope to wed one day. Unfortunately, a curse falls on the House of Kersey when a crew of mangy vermin, the most important member being Cutter (Laurence Fishburne), invades our hero's bungalow. The gang brutalizes Kersey's maid Rosario and abducts the shattered Carol. In the process of submitting Paul's daughter to an indignity nearly identical to the horrors she suffered in the first film, the poor young lady takes her life by plunging out of a warehouse window. Predictably, Kersey arrives home to find a deceased Rosario stretched out in the hallway and his daughter gone. Within a few minutes the authorities break the sad news to Paul; they found his daughter's body outside of a known gang hideout. The horrors of New York are starting all over again, and Paul Kersey must once again go forth and battle the forces of evil.

Unlike in the first film, Kersey specifically targets the criminals responsible for the slaying of his daughter. He finds out where they hang out and rents a grungy hotel room in the area to serve as a base of operations. Every night Paul drives down there, dons a knit cap and dark duds, and roams the streets looking for riffraff. As soon as he stumbles over one of the thugs in question, he pulls out a gun and dispatches them with extreme prejudice. The police, led by Lieutenant Mankiewicz (Ben Frank), take note of the sudden rash of killings and start to put the pieces together, namely that a vigilante is working the city streets. Kersey's name soon pops up, thanks to his reputation from New York years earlier, and the authorities bring in Inspector Frank Ochoa (Vincent Gardenia) from the first film to help them put a stop to Paul's rampages. Kersey becomes aware of Ochoa's presence, leading to a cat and mouse game that threatens Paul's ability to wreak vengeance on his enemies. Nonetheless, after a shootout gives Kersey a temporary respite from the attention of the authorities our man continues to hunt down his enemies. He goes so far as to infiltrate a mental hospital to pursue a victim, but his single-minded pursuit carries personal costs in his relationship with Geri Nichols.

It's obvious from the start that the makers of ""Death Wish 2"" went straight for the sleaze effect. The first film sought to examine crime and vigilantism in a serious way, even going so far as to have the Paul Kersey character become physically ill after attacking a criminal. ""Death Wish 2"" throws all introspection out the window, replacing a message with gory deaths and memorable one-liners rivaling anything Dirty Harry ever tossed out. Carol's death scene is particularly tough to watch, as are the atrocities visited upon the poor Rosario. The dialogue is magnificent in an extraordinarily entertaining way. ""Goodbye"" says Paul Kersey immediately before pulling the trigger on a helpless thug twisting in pain on the floor of a warehouse. ""Do you believe in Jesus?"" asks Kersey of another goon, who replies with ""Yes, yes I do."" ""Well, you're going to meet him,"" responds our vigilante as he opens fire. Great stuff! This isn't dialogue churned out by some hack; it's holy scripture chiseled on stone tablets that someone carried down from a mountaintop. If you can get your mind around the idea that ""Death Wish 2"" is completely devoid of a message, you'll love this movie. Too, make sure and listen to the Jimmy Page soundtrack; you'll hear it again in ""Death Wish 3.""

My only problem with the ""Death Wish 2"" DVD, aside from the unacceptable fullscreen presentation and a trailer as the only extra, concerns MGM's inexplicable decision to put an edited version of the film on the disc. I remember seeing a more vicious version of the film back on cable in the mid 1980s, mainly one with a longer sequence involving the gang and Rosario, which obviously didn't make it to the DVD. Why MGM saw fit to give us this version is a mystery. Nevertheless, ""Death Wish 2"" is highly entertaining; it's must see viewing for Bronson fans.",1105315200,36,5723,4.818921668362156
761080,1,6303920098,"""Death Wish 2"" (1982) is an inept piece of filmmaking. This contrived sequel looks as though it was photographed, edited and scored by pornographers.

761082,2,6303920098,"Not sure where to begin with Death Wish 2.  Significantly, it was directed by Michael Winner, who directed the first and would go on to direct the amazing third entry in this series about 'bleeding heart liberal' architect Paul Kersey and his vigilante side job.
Paul Kersey now lives in sunny Los Angeles, which like New York is depicted as a pit of human filth and depravity.  The incredible cynicism of the filmmakers begins right away as Kersey's housemaid and daughter--who, remember, was violently raped in the original--are brutaly raped, with the maid murdered.  Then Kersey's daughter is taken away, raped again, and decides to jump out a window rather than endure the rest of the film.  Kersey then puts down his slide ruler and blueprints and takes up his old hobby of blowing away criminal scum.
The main difference between Part 2 and the original, besides an even deeper cynicism, a lower budget, and overall abysmal effort by all involved, is that Bronson actually hunts down the individuals responsible for these acts of malfeasance.  His behavior now flat-out pathological, he rents a cheap office in a bad part of LA, using it as a home base for his vigilante operations.  Donning ski cap and dark clothes and packing heat, he roams the streets of LA, looking for revenge.
Even the tagline is noteworthy:
Bronson's on the loose again!  Seems to suggest that, in effect, it didn't matter who Bronson was playing, because 'he' was on the loose again!
Overall, it's bad.  Very, very bad.  Part 3 is bad, but it has other things going for it, namely that it cannot be taken seriously for a moment and it knows it, the tongue so firmly in cheek that it becomes an incredible guilty pleasure and one of the best bad movies of the 80s, perhaps ever.  But Part 2, for the most part, is an exploitation movie.  The film looks cheap, grimy, and rushed.  It can't even succeed as a bad movie, which is pretty depressing.  It feels seedy, right down to the very grainy film stock and washed out look to the picture.  And to top it off, Jimmy Page contributes one of the most appalling scores I've heard in a movie of any genre.  Not even his score for Part 3 was this embarassing.  And yes, it is THE Jimmy Page.
As for Bronson, he's particularly wooden in this one.  Which may be appropriate as at this point, Kersey is less than sane.
But alas!  The Death Wish flicks finally reappeared on DVD, right around the time of Bronson's death in 2003.  Obviously recommended if you like, well, Death Wish movies, the DVDs are capable, if pretty bare bones.  I would love to hear Michael Winner do a commentary track to discuss his state of mind when he directed this one.",1087862400,7,2671,4.606765327695561
761083,3,6303920098,"I thought this death wish was not a bad one. It had somewhat of a continuous storyline to it. Basically how the punks kill his daughter and the police don't seem too helpful in hunting down the killers. THerefore, he becomes the vigilante and blows away each mugger one by one. This is not a bad movie but the rape scene should be short and concise beacuse it takes away the value of death wish 2. All in all, I would simply recommend buying the VHS version of this film rather than the dvd because it's something which isn't really the greatest death wish but has a good soundtrack with jimmy page. However, I would recommend buying death wish 3 on dvd because that is a real classic!!!!!",1083283200,2,689,4.390625
761084,4,6303920098,"DEATH WISH 2 is one of those movies that screams ""CASH GRAB!"". The late, great Charlie Bronson is reteamed with Michael Winner and Hal Landers and Bobby Roberts (DEATH WISH 1), along with the immortal team of Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus (most of Bronson's 80's flix, ditto Chuck Norris, AMERICAN NINJA series et al) for this thoroughly scummy retread of the original.
There is a difference however: DW2 is purely for exploitation value, and is certainly not a movie to be watched with Mum (especially my Mum, or my Grandmas- maternal or paternal).
The plot is practically identical.  Charlie and his reporter girlfriend (Jill Ireland) take his daughter Carol (Robin Sherwood- betcha ten bucks that isn't her real name)- still institutionalized after being assaulted in DW1- on an outing to the market. However at the market Charlie runs afoul of a band of scummy pot smoking muggers one of them played by a young Larry Fishburne- (Laurence Fishburne the 3rd, thank you very much!) who blast Jimmy Page's ""Jam Sandwich"" on their retro 80s ghetto blaster. The thugs steal Charlie's ice cream money, but also his wallet.
Unfortunately the thugs get Charlie's address from his ID and head to his house, break in and gang rape his maid, Rosario (Silvana Gallardo). A rather icky scene. Unlike the brief bash round the head in the first movie, the rape scenes here are extended (in NZ the film runs 87 mins- there's actually FIVE MINUTES of rape missing! Gross!).
Then Carol is abducted by the thugs and raped again, and while fleeing the sexual sadists runs through a window and is convieniently impaled on an iron picket fence.
Meanwhile the cops are at Kersy's house, when he is called in to identify Carol's body. (Considering where the LOCATION of the corpse was it's pretty easy to finger the gang, isn't it?). But no, this is a DEATH WISH movie, the cops are DUMB. Charlie makes up a story about blacking out, but of course he remembers everything. And it's not long before he hits the streets of LA with his trusty .44 Magnum, hunting down the scum and blowing several shades of poop out of them (Fishburne's ""death"" gives a new meaning to ""Ghetto Blaster""!).
Highly recommended, even if it's cheap, inept, sadistic and bloody. Viewer discretion is advised though. The music (another high point) is by Jimmy Page of Led Zep. I just found it odd how NZ's censors didn't add a warning note about the sexual violence in the film. However if you have the stomach for it, make sure you check out DEATH WISH 2. Despite it's violence its utterly compelling. If you think otherwise, well you know how to contact me.",1080604800,10,2612,4.753303964757709
761085,4,6303920098,My personal favorite of the series.  MGM used to be the leader in releasing older catalog titles with pride but they seem to have lowered their standards much to the fans dismay.

761086,5,6303920098,"Death Wish was an excellent movie that told the story of mild mannered common man Paul Kersey driven to become a vigilante after the murder of his wife and rape of his daughter. Death Wish is very artistic and was a hit that spawned 4 sequels. Death Wish 2 set the pattern for the other movies in the series and is a different type of film from the first. The second Death Wish falls into the category of revenge films and has a gritty look to it that captures the rawness of it's subject. Some have complained about the look of the film, but it serves to make it much more visceral from the first film and one of the grittiest films ever made. There's a disturbing snuff film/documentary feel about Death Wish 2 which both repulses and transfixes, and at the same time the film also works on a much more unreal level as a revenge fantasy.
In the first film Kersey never catches the thugs who destroyed his family, but in Death Wish 2 his revenge isn't just aimed at random criminals, but at specific thugs responsible for his daughter's death. The first Death Wish was about Kersey's transformation into a vigilante, but Death Wish 2 is about hunting down specific guilty criminals and seeing that they pay for their crimes. There have been many revenge films, but there's just something much more satisfying about the way justice is served in the Death Wish series than in other films. William Lustig's Vigilante is another good film of this type as is The Exterminator, but Death Wish 2, like the rest of the series, really provides the audience with a satisfying feeling of justice. The combination of the hyper real and the fantastic make Death Wish 2 compelling viewing. As a cinematic revenge fantasy it's the best of it's kind.",1077235200,3,1735,4.581993569131833

We sees views of a big town. Crimes are up in Los Angeles says a radio announcer. This is like a war on citizens. What can be done? Paul Kerseys daughter has a medical condition. Paul is robbed of money by some street thugs; they get away with his wallet! These robbers go to his home. [Note the racial balance.] They attack the maid! Then Paul and his daughter come home are attacked. Pauls daughter Carol is kidnapped! Later his wife comes home. Carol tries to escape by jumping out of a window. The police question Paul. Then he is told about Carol. There is a funeral. Paul vacations in the country. When he returns the police ask him to view mug shots, but he refuses.

Paul has his own method, and visits a poor neighborhood. He walks around, then rents a room for $50 a month. Back home he changes the locks. On the streets he sees two of the robbers and follows them to their lair. There is a drug deal. Paul stops two of them. The TV news tells of two deaths in a closed business. Paul prowls the streets. A womans screams attracts him, a couple is being attacked and robbed. Two criminals are stopped, then a third. The police cars roll up, victims cant describe the shooter. A New York detective tells about his experiences. Frank goes to Los Angeles. [Does his fedora make him conspicuous?] Frank talks to Pauls girlfriend and suggests he stop. She visits Paul and tells him about Frank Ochoa. Paul takes a bus at night; Frank follows him. Paul recognizes three young men on the street. He follows them onto a bus, and then when they leave.

The three trade a white powder for guns. Shots are fired! Men fall, a car crashes and burns! Paul talks to Frank, who has a last request. Kersey discusses building costs with his client. The police radio conversations can be monitored. Paul listens and learns what they're doing, and goes to that building. That man runs out, the police cant stop him at first; it takes many to take him down. [What drug is he on? PCP?] Paul was injured on his left forearm. Charles Wilson was remanded to the state hospital until the medical board can release him. Paul visits that hospital and takes a souvenir. Later he returns at night with a lab coat and a clipboard. But things don't go as planned (at first). Pauls girlfriend enters his home and finds a crumpled piece of paper.

If you saw the original movie youll know the same plot is repeated here but with a different background. What is the message of this movie? It is that people are afraid of becoming crime victims (justly so) and admire a hero who opposes the villains. It is like an echo of those old Westerns where a hero arrives to save good people from the villains. Think of Shane or The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.
