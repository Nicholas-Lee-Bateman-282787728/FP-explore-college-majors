7230864,3,B00YQTCPP4,At times this was a believable and convincing movie. Unfortunately this was not the case throughout. The buildup of the drama fell flat at crucial moments due to unconvincing scenes and a mediocre scrip. It is a pity as it could have been a great drama about various sexualities. The acting is fine and the actors well cast. The title of the movie is spot-on!,1444867200,2,359,4.538461538461538

7230866,4,B00YQTCPP4,"Quite a story; can't say I really 'enjoyed' it but it had a lot of twists and turns. One member of the gay couple was especially cunning and sly as he figures out what is going on and the truth all comes crashing down at the end as discoveries and admissions are made, with a silent departure at the end,  without giving away too much about it. Great French scenery of parts of the South of France.",1442793600,,398,4.1688311688311686

7230868,3,B00YQTCPP4,"There are several problems with this movie: 1) It desperately needs sub-titles due to the actors' British accents and mumbled dialogue. Repeated viewings of a scene did not help; 2) The unfolding scenario is almost obvious from the beginning yet unaware to the one who unintentionally (?) made it possible until much later; 3) A particular scene was deleted and then shown in the Deleted Scenes section which should have been left in the film and would have helped to clarify an all too sudden and open ending.  The French director undoubtedly knew that he was not directing an ""art film"". Yet, the movie is almost treated as one - especially with lengthy and breathtaking views of the Provence landscape almost preempting the main storyline. The old saying: ""Three's a crowd"" is certainly applicable here. When two gay men go off to a Provence hideaway in southern France for a vacation, James invites his friend Caroline to join them in order to help her get over a three-year romance that has just been terminated. While James has been gay all his life, his lover Olivier of barely a year has only been out more recently after a not so rewarding heterosexual life. Without giving anything away, the emotional and sexual cravings of Caroline, the insecurity of James, and the not yet fully settled sexual orientation of Olivier (despite his protests to the contrary) pave the way for a discordant brew. While the message of the movie is the fact that there are varying degrees of sexual preference, the plot itself seems somewhat contrived and the resolution to the quandary is left to the mind of the viewer. A similar theme is to be found in a 1967 movie with an equally ambiguous title called THE FOX which starred Keir Dullea, Sandy Dennis, and Anne Heywood (highly recommended). That one had more depth and a clearer ending despite the period in which it existed that was orders of magnitude less understanding than today's environment. I do recommend THE WASP because the acting is excellent and the subject matter is thought provoking. Others can judge it accordingly. If you do see the movie be sure and watch the Extras. (Except for the Director and the actress playing Caroline, the remaining actors are much more readily understood even without sub-titles.)",1438992000,4,2270,4.865633074935401
7230869,5,B00YQTCPP4,"Loved it!! Definitley worth seeing. Really beautiful movie that draws you in immediately.
It captivates you and makes you think about a subject rarely explored: the spectrum of sexuality.
Highly recommend it!",1438646400,,208,5.53125

8718846,2,B00YQTCPP4,"I didn't find this a good movie as so many others did.

I'm only giving it two stars because I did finish it...and the only reason I did, was I kept hoping something interesting was going to happen...and in my opinion...that never happened.

It was only 3 actors...and I found all of them rather flat and uninteresting. The basic premise is a gay couple, with a recently dumped female friend...go on holiday. Unlike most gay movies, where a straight guy is being seduced to the other team...in this film  a woman tries to seduce her friend's boyfriend. And that my friends, is as exciting as this movie gets.

I'm glad so many others found it interesting, unfortunately, I found it quite boring and tedious. But, that's just my opinion...what do I know? I hated the stage play CATS...and it was one of the longest running and most popular plays out there. lol",1496620800,,859,4.631578947368421
8718847,5,B00YQTCPP4,"I very much enjoyed this movie, although I kept imagining that Elizabeth Taylor would have been profound playing the role of Caroline.",1482192000,,134,5.136363636363637
8718848,3,B00YQTCPP4,"I have to admit to being torn with this movie. I have never minded a ""talking"" movie at all...I don't need to have shooting or explosions to enjoy a movie but I do require some kind of good pacing. Here we have lovers Olivier and James and they have been together for a year. They go to the South of France to vacation and James invites his ""friend"" Caroline to come along as she had just broken up with her boyfriend. Caroline asks if either has ever been with a woman and lo and behold, she tramps out and tries to seduce Olivier! Why? Who knows. Olivier does have some interest though. James get to be annoying because Olivier is ""mean"" to her and wants him to be nicer and Olivier is just trying to keep his distance. So you see what this is, she is trampy, Olivier is weak and James is annoying. Do we ever see them get together? Have they done the deed? The last night of the vacation James asks and asks big time. The ending is undefined, maybe that is how it should be. This movie just became annoying.",1460073600,3,1010,4.211340206185567

8718850,1,B00YQTCPP4,"Just another movie that leaves a lot of open questions and innuendo nothing is clarified except three things: a boyfriend who's does or contemplates cheating, a woman who is manipulative, a boyfriend who gets hurt. And a bad ending nothing is clarified!",1448236800,2,253,5.0476190476190474
8718851,1,B00YQTCPP4,"I rely on  CC for viewing.  On attempting to view ""Wasp"" the captions were unreasonably out of sync with the video thereby making viewing impossible.  If I can figure out HOW I will and do request a refund of $3.99 to my account.

8718852,4,B00YQTCPP4,"James and Olivier are going to stay in Oliviers south of France country home for a romantic holiday. Caroline is a friend of Jamess and has just been dumped by her boyfriend and James being a thoroughly nice bloke  invites her along only  quelle horreur she accepts!

Once they start to kill time enjoying themselves it soon becomes obvious that Caroline is having an effect on the pairs relationship and as the French summer slowly and languorously ebbs past so too the shifting emotions of the three start to change.

Now this is an independent film and the only characters are the three aforementioned ones. However, it does not suffer for it. It is well acted and filmed with only a few moments where I felt the scene added not very much or indeed went on a bit too long. That said the overall effect is of a confident and well made indie effort that actually does credit for all involved.",1448064000,2,893,4.527950310559007
