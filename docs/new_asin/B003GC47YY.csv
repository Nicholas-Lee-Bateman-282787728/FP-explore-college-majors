8444704,5,B003GC47YY,"I went to a few of the screenings last summer of Facets Children's Movie Festival with my younger brother. Honestly, I wasn't excited to go, but I went because my brother really wanted to and he couldn't go alone. However, I must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed every short film that I saw, just not as much as my brother who loved every minute of it. The stories, although simple enough for a young child, are very capably directed and cleverly written. My brother was very excited to buy this set and has not been disappointed. Indeed, he watches these short films so much I've practically memorized them. Highly recommended for anyone's son or doughter (or brother or sister).",1337558400,,679,4.714285714285714
