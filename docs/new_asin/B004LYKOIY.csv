4427869,5,B004LYKOIY,"Tom Wulf did an excellent job on this documentary on Circuit City.  It was very interesting, especially learning the early history of the company. Companies today should watch and learn!  I worked for the company for over 17 years - came in during the high times and it was sad to watch the company go down.  Too bad it all had to come to an end.",1297987200,4,346,4.212121212121212
4427870,5,B004LYKOIY,"I watched it last night 2/15/11 Tom. It was great. I sure do miss Circuit City and everyone, what a very talented group of people we worked with. What a shame such a family oriented business had to end this way. You really captured the spirit.
THANK YOU!",1297814400,2,254,4.3125
4427871,5,B004LYKOIY,I watched the documentary last night.  Great job in producing it.  Really enjoyed all the segments.  This documentary will be useful to business schools throughout the country as a case study.,1297814400,2,192,5.129032258064516
4427872,5,B004LYKOIY,This is a must see for any business owner or business student.  This will help you learn from the success and failures of a major business.  The film is very well done.  It is presented in a concise and clear manner.,1297814400,2,216,4.219512195121951
4427873,5,B004LYKOIY,"A sixty year old, multi-billion dollar retailer that employed over 40,000 at one time and helped America embrace the VCR and DVD player, disappears.  This story will help loyal customers remember why they shopped there, will remind loyal employees why they worked there, and help today's business person understand that success versus failure are balanced on a knife edge.  Tom Wulf's documentary looks at the human side of a once great company that suddenly disappeared and shows that it took just much less time to fail than it did to reach success.  Old pictures, video clips and interviews with the people who were there weave a rich tapestry that shows all successful companies are made up of people that care to do a great job.",1297814400,12,733,4.848
4427874,5,B004LYKOIY,"Whether you are a former employee or business student, this documentary is a wonderful, heartfelt story of how Sam Wurtzel built a billion dollar company from an entrepreneurial dream during the dawn of the age of television.  The story takes us from the early days of WARDS TV up through the triumphs and tribulations of the Circuit City superstore empire.  Many Circuit City employees gave their impressions of both the positive and negative aspects of the company over the decades.  Those local to the Richmond, VA area will be able to relive the days of Circuit City and what the store meant to the economy and the people involved with the company's success.  Filmmaker Tom Wulf has done an excellent job producing this documentary.  For more background information, visit [...]",1297728000,8,782,4.984615384615385
4427875,5,B004LYKOIY,"I worked for Circuit City HQ, and before I worked for the company I purchased electronics from it faithfully. This story provides a clear and honest look at how Great becomes Failure. There are lessons to be learned here! If you run a company and are riding high, watch this video! Failure follows Success if you are not perpetually on guard!",1297728000,5,342,4.622950819672131
4427896,5,B004LYKOIY,As a former Circuit City employee this is a great but sad look at the place that took me from a boy to a man. I am so greatful that this was made so the memory of just how great CC once was will be able to live on even in a small way.,1440201600,,234,3.3518518518518516
4427897,5,B004LYKOIY,"very interesting; its a low budget event, but the lessons learned are invaluable.

Excellent documentary ~ mistakes include discontinuing appliance sales (what idiots); exclusive w/ Verizon (no iPhone);
and stock buy back at the wrong time.  This is a company that had loads of cash in the 90's, and by a series of misteps,
CEO misteps, and a series of CEOs I should add, took the company from hero to zero.  For every student in business school  --
this should be required viewing.  It fell from internal mistakes, not external issues like competition, the economy, etc.  The fact that
it collapsed in fall of 2008 is just a coincidence.  Wurtzel family did tremendous job building the company, then others came in and blew it up.
Loved this documentary.",1439856000,3,755,4.8515625
4427898,5,B004LYKOIY,"Every Business Owner should watch this.

  It doesn't matter if your business is retail or service industry, etc.  The founder of the company was 1)appropriately innovative,2) customer oriented and 3)understood human motivation (buyers and employees).  He was a business genius.  His son was the same.  After his son stepped down, the CEO's rarely embraced #3, occasionally embraced #2  and often were inappropriately innovative.
Choosing a successor who understands and utilizes the principles that a founder has used to create a successful company is key to the company.s continued success.  Without it, you have story like circuit city, one that I am sure has occurred hundreds of times in business, but there was no video outlining the rise and fall.
This should be used as a training video for all top management in any company, with discussions what their own company's core values are, on what went wrong, followed by a plan of prevention to keep them from doing the same.",1436140800,5,979,5.06875
4427899,5,B004LYKOIY,This is a lesson in how to destroy a wonderful and creative business.  A must see for every business owner and for all who are interested in business.  Well Done!,1435276800,2,162,4.366666666666666
4427900,3,B004LYKOIY,"5 stars for an important story about why a major business failed. Many lessons to be learned. 1 star for a poorly edited documentary. Therefore, the 3 stars. Was this created by the original owners who wanted to make sure that those who crushed their legacy were identified? When you film a key presenter, don't you make sure their shirt isn't wrinkled? Just poor produced which took away from appreciating the full story.",1433721600,,422,4.794520547945205

4427902,3,B004LYKOIY,"I believe the story gave an in-depth view alright, I can't give it more stars because it gave no new insights of a business failure but confirmed what can happen when the goal is trying to beat the competition instead of improving or beating your own best.",1433721600,2,256,4.468085106382978
4427903,5,B004LYKOIY,Interesting documentary about the rise and fall of circuit city and the businesses that spun off of it.,1429833600,,103,4.777777777777778

4427905,5,B004LYKOIY,great documentary. You'll also learn how CarMax got it's start.,1424390400,2,63,5.4
4427926,4,B004LYKOIY,Philip Schoonover will find immortality in University level finance and business books as an example of what not to do in business. Schoonvers incompetence was at such a level that someone should have made sure he wasn't on Best Buys payroll. It is a shame that a business founded on such sound principles was run into the ground by such incompetent CEO's. Anyone thinking of owning a business no matter how small should watch and learn from this story. Even today somewhere a incompetent bonehead is running a profitable business in the ground..,1422230400,2,546,4.881720430107527
4427927,5,B004LYKOIY,very good movie.  Quite informative.  Would recommend to anyone in business.,1416009600,2,76,5.818181818181818
4427928,3,B004LYKOIY,"I personally was delighted that Circuit City went out of business.  I used to shop there all the time, then one Christmas I walked in wanting to buy a new laptop for someone and noticed the word ""Christmas"" was plainly omitted from the entire store.  Disturbed, I went to their in-store magazine, same deal.  I left the store and went online and the did a full Google search of their entire website for the word ""Christmas""...not one single hit.  At that point, I decided I was going to never shop there again.  I'm not a huge ""Christmas"" celebrator but any business that literally goes out of their way to ban the word of the holiday, while simultaneously soliciting my business specifically for that particular holiday, is a hypocritical disgrace. This documentary was interesting showing how it all started with Wards, but even as I watched, I found myself disgusted that this business decided to abandon good business and embrace the philosophy of the corrupt democrat party.",1410048000,2,979,4.873493975903615
4427929,5,B004LYKOIY,really enjoyed this.great business history told in a way everyone will appreciate. I didn't know car max was company started by circut city. Lots interesting behind the scenes stuff .Even if you are not a business history fan you will like this. I highly recomend this video.,1409875200,,275,4.872340425531915
4427930,4,B004LYKOIY,For those who shopped at or worked at or are just curious about Circuit City this documentary is one you should watch.  It chronicles the history of the electronics retailer from it's beginnings to the very end.  A fascinating look at the downfall of a once great retailer.,1403395200,,273,4.666666666666667
4427931,5,B004LYKOIY,This was a good review from start to finish about Circuit City.  I really enjoyed shopping at our local store.  Bought quite a few appliances from them.  Sad to see them slip away.,1403222400,,180,4.393939393939394
4427932,4,B004LYKOIY,Enjoyable. The film was fascinating. Well done. Interesting history of circuit city. You should watch it. Only avialble on amazon.,1401235200,,130,5.55
4427933,5,B004LYKOIY,I would highly recommend this to any former Circuit City employee or anybody interested in history.  Lots of information - I worked for Circuit City for 5 years and I learned a lot about the company that I didn't know before.  Very good and informational DVD.,1377648000,,259,4.608695652173913
4427934,5,B004LYKOIY,"Must read, especially for anyone who had the privlige of working at circuit city during the great times. I still miss it everyday",1374883200,,129,4.6521739130434785
4427935,5,B004LYKOIY,This movie was great. Being the son of a director for Carmax and having alot of friends coming from Circuit City this was really well produced and very interesting.,1359590400,,164,4.689655172413793
4427945,3,B004LYKOIY,"I showed this movie to my business classes in high school. I would think they would give it a 2-3 star rating. The movie didn't really hold their interest, in spite of my helpful interjections. Circuit City was such a good company to work for when I started there. But it's difficult to believe how horribly management screwed things up. It was fun while it lasted. But, I wouldn't want to work in that kind of environment again, nor would I want to watch this movie again.",1353715200,,473,4.448275862068965
4427946,1,B004LYKOIY,"this movie's description is false.  it is just as bad as a safety or history video you have to watch to as a beginning employee.  this movie is a waste of time and money for most of us.

as for the circuit city employees that have emotion attached to the end of the company.  it happens.  move on.  this stuff is ubiquitous.",1351468800,,324,4.145161290322581
4427947,5,B004LYKOIY,"Very good documentary! It goes through the entire company start to finish with a lot of the people who started it, or worked in the head offices or in a management role in the stores. A very eye opening look at what killed Circuit City, but also how it became so successful. The extras are also worth it, with plenty of commercials and footage. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is into retail or documentaries.",1334534400,,419,4.454545454545454
4427948,5,B004LYKOIY,This is the best documentary that i have ever seen. It is a must for any business owner to see. You will learn what can take a business down and what can make it a success. You will hear from former employees that were there for over 25 years. It is a must see for everyone.,1332720000,,274,3.9107142857142856
4427949,4,B004LYKOIY,"Wow, I worked in CC stores from 1996-2005 and saw all the changes from the store level.  When I left in 2005, atleast in Northern California, the writing was already on the wall.  The story was fair, albeit most of the interviews was with Circuit City leadership or Support Center partners.  I think that many store managers, like myself, have a different view on the demise.  It was many of the reasons discussed like exiting the appliance business, laying off the best sales counselors (which I unfortunately had to do), again, and held accountable for hiring ""talent"".  CC leadership considered any Best Buy recruit ""talent"" at the time.  I pushed the point on why would any manager want to leave Best Buy to go to CC while they were already kicking our butts?  For less pay as well.....(unless they sucked or were underperforming  I have many great memories working for CC and am thankful for all the training they provided to make me successful today.  The two concerns I have with this story is the lack of challenging from the leadership team on what everybody knew was wrong exept for them....and the second concern of store level point of views.

4427950,5,B004LYKOIY,"The video came in yesterday. I was very pleased with how everything turned out. The video combined news stories with information that was new to most viewers that did not know about the inner details of Circuit City. The video flowed smoothly through the topics and was very interesting to watch. In hindsight some of the ideas to change the company may have sounded good at the time, but too many bad ideas too quickly killed the company. The stories of the demise of Circuit City given by former employees of the company bring a more personal side to the story than found in any other media article.",1310256000,,601,4.574074074074074
4427951,5,B004LYKOIY,"I worked at Circuit City during the hey day mid nineties and this DVD really brought back some great memories. I still can't believe the company is gone. Seeing my old store sit empty and then become a training facility for electricians breaks my heart. This documentary really touches on the multiple reasons of Circuit City's demise. As a former major appliances sales counselor, I always felt this was a horrible decision to stop selling appliances.  That and divx.....great doc. Tom Wulf does and outstanding job.",1309910400,,517,5.011627906976744
4427952,5,B004LYKOIY,"I was thoroughly impressed by the well-researched, well-documented story of the rise and fall of an electronics retailer that had been a part of my life and recipient of my business for many years before it started to decline. Although I had some opinions as to why Circuit City was losing business through my perspective as a consumer, A Tale of Two Cities delves into the actions at the executive and store level that led to and precipitated the company's bankruptcy. The story is told through interviews with men and women who witnessed the fall of Circuit City from the inside, and it is their insight that makes this such a powerful documentary. The interviews are supplemented with photographs, advertisements, and commercials, which add much to the film.

As a graduate of business school, I agree that A Tale of Two Cities is an important case study for anyone considering starting a business or climbing the corporate ladder of an existing firm. I also believe it serves as a more general warning, however, about the danger of hubris and failure to pay attention to and adapt to one's environment.",1301961600,3,1106,4.851851851851852
4427953,5,B004LYKOIY,"Tom Wulf could have taken the easy path by focusing on why Circuit City failed. Instead, he unfolds a compelling narrative history of the company and stresses what the founders and core executive team did correctly that made Circuit City one of the most successful retailers in the last half of the 20th Century. Doing so suggests that the executive missteps of the company's final decade were as tragic as they were avoidable. While the interviews with past employees could have ended up as merely a vehicle for complaints, each associate offers an emotional yet carefully reasoned critique of what was witnessed. They stand in testimony to the folly of just plain bad decision making and of pandering to perceptions about how Wall Street ""might' react while diluting the company culture that made Circuit City great in the first place. You will take away not a feeling of anger but a real sense of loss.  Alan Wurtzel, the founder's son and a former Circuit City CEO himself, plays the Shelby Foote role by providing necessary insight into the key decisions (strategic and ethical) that made his company a great place to shop as well as a great place to work, learn and grow. Mandatory viewing and a cautionary tale for all strategic planners and executive decision makers, regardless of your industry.",1298937600,2,1304,4.900452488687783
4427954,5,B004LYKOIY,"This documentary is an excellent story of how a company oriented toward providing the best customer service no matter what can grow to be the giant that Circuit City was in its day.  The focus and drive of the people interviewed throughout shows the passion they had for working with people to achieve something great, unfortunately it also shows how quickly the bad decisions of a few can bring a good company to its knees.

The tale of Circuit City lives on in this documentary, and it a must see for  business leaders, management, and entreprenuers alike.

I worked there (for over 5 years) during the time it ascended to the top as described in the book ""From Good to Great"".
