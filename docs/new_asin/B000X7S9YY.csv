2998724,2,B000X7S9YY,"Got this movie solely for The Deserter. It is very hard time find on DVD let alone a good copy. The picture is grainy and blurry like it was recorded from an old VHS. Parts of the movie has been removed because during chapter changes, the picture will freeze, black out and when it picks up again, you are about 30 secs to 1 minute further in the story.  Over all, this DVD is maybe worth $1.00 with no shipping fees. I've picked up movies from the dollar store that has better quality.  I'm glad I held onto my VHS copy. Hopefully the will release the onto DVD in the US that will be a worth while copy.",1381017600,,604,4.110169491525424
2998725,5,B000X7S9YY,This movie is not your typical western.  Offbeat but definitely worth watching.  The female lead was one of two twins - born in Austria - who later in life became a world class tri-althlete - along with her sister.,1357084800,,214,4.461538461538462

THE DESERTER which is an exceptional movie, was bad because it skipped and blacked out in spots. was very disappointed.",1302652800,2,174,5.0
