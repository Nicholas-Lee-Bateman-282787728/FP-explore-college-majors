characters played their parts well.",1441497600,,141,4.68
8072023,5,B000A1IJS4,"This is one of the later series of Poirot in which Captain Hastings, his Dr. Watson, is dispensed with. I rather miss him but the fundamental quality of David Suchet's performance more than makes up for the loss. In this outing, there is romance, disappointed love and murder. As usual, Suchet is supported by a good cast and a tricky plot. Poirot fans, of course, know that they will want to see it. Newcomers who like others in the mode of the Classic British Mystery School will find it much to their taste. Those with a penchant for the violent or 'modern' approach will find it wanting.",1422144000,,591,4.5327102803738315

8072025,5,B000A1IJS4,"I've read this book, in which Poirot is more part of the supporting cast. Of course, that can't happen in this movie series. I actually enjoyed this more than the book, though it has a couple of bizarre scenes, one of which uses horrific special effects. This one has a unique variation of getting all the suspects together that I found enjoyable (even though it includes the other bizarre scene I mentioned). Not one I'd probably watch again, but still one I though was well done.",1378080000,,481,4.604651162790698
8072026,4,B000A1IJS4,"""Sad Cypress"", based on Agatha Christie's 1940 novel, is a feature-length episode in Series 9 of ""Agatha Christie's Poirot"", that originally aired on Britain's ITV in 2003. Poirot's old friend Dr. Peter Lord (Paul McGann) asks the detective to investigate a letter that has distressed a friend of his, Miss Elinor Carlisle (Elisabeth Dermot-Walsh). Elinor and her fianc Roddy Winter (Rupert Penry-Jones) are visiting her Aunt Laura (Diana Quick) at her country home, because Elinor received an anonymous letter claiming that someone was scheming to convince Aunt Laura to disinherit her. Poirot thinks the motive behind the letter is serious, rather than a vicious prank. So he is not entirely surprised when, after the death of Aunt Laura, followed by that of Mary Gerrard (Kelly Reilly), a rival for Roddy's affections, Elinor is accused of murdering both of them.

Part of the novel was a courtroom drama. None of the film is, though it begins with Elinor's conviction, flashes back to reveal her experiences, and then continues with Poirot is racing against time to save her from execution. The mystery is a good one. The cast is also strong, especially Elisabeth Carlisle, who is featured more prominently than single characters usually are in Agatha Christie, who tends to prefer ensemble casts. But Series 9 was when ""Poirot""'s writers made big changes. Among them were the loss of secondary characters like Inspector Japp, Capt. Hastings, and Miss Lemon, whose interaction with Poirot humanized him and provided vehicles through which we could poke light fun at the Belgian. David Suchet's interpretation of Poirot has changed subtly. It is humorless. The levity of the ""Poirot"" of the 1990s is gone, which has left the films a bit flat.",1315353600,,1745,5.12280701754386
8072027,5,B000A1IJS4,"Agatha Christie's favorite detective, Hercule Poirot, puts his ""little grey cells"" to work to unravel a puzzling mystery.

When Eleanor Carlyle and her fiancee receive a poisoned pen letter about Eleanor's spinster aunt, they journey to her large house in the country.  When they arrive, Eleanor's fiancee meets Mary, a childhood playmate and the gardener's daughter.  A love triangle gradually ensues, and two murders occur.  Could Eleanor be the guilty party, or is there another culprit? Could the motive be a crime of passion, or could the motive be something else entirely? It is up to Poirot to unravel the tangled skein of threads that make up this twisted case of deception.

Sad Cypress is one of the darker Christie novels, and the film is wonderfully executed.  As usual, David Suchet shines in his portrayal of Poirot, and his confrontation with the killer is fantastic! Although I figured out the culprit fairly quickly, the movie never became tedious or boring.  The acting of the supporting characters is equally as good as Suchet's.  Please give this wonderful film a chance.  God bless.

(Please look for my fantasy novel, Crimilia, which will be released on May 24, 2011.  Thank you).",1301356800,,1202,5.02020202020202
8072028,4,B000A1IJS4,"I'd like to respond to the reviewer who thought that the story itself wasn't very good.  I don't think that is what's wrong here.  I've just purchased 2 boxed sets of Agatha Christie's ""Poirot"" and I felt in all of them that something subtle was ""off"".  After watching them again I can see what it is.  These productions are lifeless.  There is a certain energy missing that was in evidence in the earlier ""Poirot"" productions.  It's hard to describe, but if one were to have a little ""Poirot"" mini-marathon some long weekend, one could see the differences between the films in ""The Movie Collection - Set Two"" which contains: """"Hickory, Dickory, Dock"" (surely one of the funniest of all the films),""Murder on the Links"", ""Dumb Witness"" and ""Poirot's Christmas"" - and the films in ""The New Mysteries Collection"" and ""The Classic Crimes Collection"".  I bought the two latter sets because I hadn't seen any of them on TV and it was a great treat to have some of my favorite Christie mysteries come to life.  And even though the films in these two boxed sets do not have the vivacity of the earlier works they are still well worth the purchase.  I particularly liked ""Death on the NIle"" since, once I had seen David Suchet, I couldn't stand to watch any other actor playing Poirot and I didn't care for the earlier version with Peter Ustinov.  It's been my heartfelt wish that Suchet would make ""Murder on the Orient Express"" before he retires.  The Albert Finney version was just silly.

So I don't think Agatha Christie's story is at fault here.  ""Sad Cypress"" is one of the best reads.  I can't tell whether it's David Suchet - he seems tired - or whether it is the writing that is stale.  But there is certainly a lack of energy and a lack of humor that differentiates these two collections from earlier productions. If one could use a color analgy there is a certain ""greyness"" to these later productions that seems to sap some of the life from them.  The color is, in fact, actually much less saturated in these two boxed sets than in earlier productions.  So, with Poirot seeming a little tired and not much color in the films, they come off as much less vibrant than previous DVDs.",1242777600,9,2186,4.57840616966581
8072029,3,B000A1IJS4,"David Suchet yields his usual fine performance in this not all that well-known Agatha Christie mystery... but he unfortunately didn't have much to work with.

The story, loosely based upon Chistie's original work, is this: A young heiress, about to marry her soul mate (her cousin!) is accused of snuffing her fiance's prospective new girlfriend with poisoned hor's d'oeuvres sandwiches. The heiress is dragged down to The Old Bailey and promptly convicted of the murder. Hercule Poirot is called in (by a physician who has the hots for the rejected fiance), to quickly find the REAL murderer before the heiress is unjustly hanged!

Now, as simple as that sounds, the screenwriters bunged it up, I think because they had to fill in a lot of time -- and it shows. The whole thing is a bit foggy, especially to folks unfamiliar with Christie's original work. It's understating the fact to say that this film drags a little.

Fortunately, the cinematography is quite good, the locations and sets are very nicely done, and the actors pull off their respective roles, I suppose as written... sadly. BTW, the title of the film exudes from a song.... not a very good song.

This is an ""okay"" film for rabid Christie fans but most folks will be asleep on this one before 1/3 of the show is finished.",1198368000,9,1291,4.75
