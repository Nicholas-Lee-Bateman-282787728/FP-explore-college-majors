Endless Summer, Step Into Liquid, Sept. Sessions, etc. Stories from Tom Curren, John Carper, and and others. Pick it up if you can get it cheap.",1104796800,,303,4.735849056603773
8503661,4,B00008DP14,"This is a great video, full of sweet surfing footage and the powerful  testimonies from some of the world's top surfers how Jesus Christ has  changed their lives.
This is perfect for family entertainment,  Christian outreach events or youth groups.
Even landlocked non-surfers in  the midwest love this great video.
I hope you enjoy it as much as I  did,
Peter Gillin Campus Crusade for Christ",968371200,6,393,4.893939393939394
