4190879,5,B003TO541O,"I'll admit, I was skeptical at first.  After all, half of the allure of Sherlock Holmes is the grittiness and fog contrasting against the elegance and splendor of the Victorian era.  How would this translate in a modern era?  Surprisingly well, it turns out.  Although only 3 episodes have been released (and yes, it has been renewed for further seasons/series), Sherlock has already found a place in my heart (and a permanent slot on my iPod).  The acting is absolutely fabulous, and it is a smart blend of action, suspense, drama, and comedy, filled with references to the novels.

A Study in Pink (Steven Moffat): Written by the mastermind behind the latest season/series of Doctor Who starring Matt Smith (my favorite year of DW to date), and other gems like Jekyll (another modern retelling, this time of Robert Louis Stevenson's Victorian horror story), A Study in Pink re-introduces you to the characters of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson.  Based more off the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle stories than the movies that made the term ""dearstalker"" a household name, Holmes solves mysteries the police cannot using his powers of observation, keen ability to connect the dots, and a smartphone.  Watson, an Afghan war vet once more (things never really do change, do they?), is introduced to Holmes while looking for a roommate, and finds in him a friend and partner who can satisfy his need for adventure and danger in the humdrum of post-war life.  On the advice of his psychiatrist, Watson begins a blog about Holmes' cases, and thus fulfills the role of biographer to the famous consulting detective.  In this story, the police are looking into a series of deaths that are believed to be suicides by ingestion of pills, but Sherlock knows are murders.  The mystery takes second-stage to the characters in this one, though.  While the story suffers a smidgen for it, you will still have a ton of fun watching the characters develop and the stage get set.  A pitch-perfect introduction to what is surely going to be a beloved show for a long time.

The Blink Banker (Stephen Thompson): A series of mysterious spray-painted symbols links murders and disappearances to ancient Chinese artifacts.  Easily the weakest of the three stories so far, but still a good time, with some particularly fine acting by Martin Freeman.  The ending is especially chilling, and worth the price of admission alone.

The Great Game (Mark Gatiss): An explosion rocks London, and soon the culprit challenges Sherlock in a race against time to solve seemingly unrelated cases before the next bomb goes off.  Dr. Watson shines in this episode, showing that he is not the bumbling idiot as often portrayed in the movies (but NOT in the books, mind you; while he is not Sherlock's equal in terms of training, he is nearly as smart, and certainly more world-wise).  There are also some lovely moments between Sherlock and Mycroft, great character exposition with regards to how Sherlock's mind works, and the nemesis that has been winding himself into the plots and lurking in the background.
And the ending... oh, my.  My friends and I are still talking about it!

This program is more like three stand-alone movies, each episode being about 1.5 hours with a satisfying conclusion to wrap it up at the end (with one minor episode 3 caveat, about which I will not go further to avoid the slightest chance of spoiling the moment).  But like any movie and its sequels, it is still best to watch them in order.
(A side note: The price might seem like a bit much for only three episodes, until you realize how much you would be paying for one stand-alone movie.  And this show is better than most movies I could name.)",1283904000,65,3691,4.805379746835443
4190880,5,B003TO541O,"But JHC, only three episodes!
I think Moffat is tied up with the new (and rather disappointing to me) Dr. Who series, so it may be a while until we see more. My own opinion is that Benedict Cumberbatch (great name!) should have been the new doctor.",1283731200,,248,4.297872340425532
4190881,5,B003TO541O,"Just finished watching this - happily, I have a multi-region DVD player and got it months early from the UK. And although I had high expections going in, it exceeded them so completely that I'm almost at a loss for words.

This series is everything that's good about British TV - brilliantly sharp writing, fantastic acting, perfect casting, stunningly filmed, full of humor and wit and tension and even a touch of the surreal. And downright scary at times too.

To Sherlock Holmes fans, you will be delighted at how well he translates into the 21st century - complete with shooting at the walls and debating about the merits of knowing that the earth revolves around the sun. Watson is a bit different than he is in the original, but it's only an improvement - he is our eyes and our emotions, and he could not possibly be a more perfect character, or played by a more perfect actor, to carry the moral and emotional weight of the series. And Sherlock himself - disturbed, possibly damaged, clearly self-destructive, but utterly charming - is one of the greatest reinventions I have ever seen. In fact, probably the greatest ever.

I honestly never thought any TV series could surpass Life on Mars as my favorite. And while we're only three episodes in (because there HAS to be more), I can honestly say that Sherlock is better.",1283558400,24,1329,4.670940170940171
4190882,5,B003TO541O,"One of my top favorites, great acting, directing and writing.
each episode is almost 2 hours long and it gives enough time to develop the story and characters,

I hesitated when I saw the series was in modern time, but very soon after I forgot completely and accepted the change, come to think of it that made it even more enjoyable and easier for me to relate as viewer.

Excellent series, I am beyond happy to see it return next year, and I can assure you then it will end in my shopping card too.",1283558400,216,499,4.242105263157895
4190883,5,B003TO541O,"As a big fan of the original stories and of the 80's Granada show with Jeremy Brett I was expecting to be disappointed by this show.  I wasn't!  Though it has been transplanted to modern day London it has kept the spirit of the books, and the casting is superb, especially the lead actor who plays the cold, calculated Holmes to perfection.

It's not an easy task to move this concept into a modern day setting given the advances in forensic science since the stories were first published, but focusing on Holmes' acute intelligence, observation and deduction it still gives that sense of awe that makes you feel like you're waking around with your eyes shut.

Don't hesitate... buy or rent this today if you love Holmes!",1283385600,378,721,4.653543307086614
4190884,4,B003TO541O,"Sherlock Holmes....makes brainy sexy.  Sure he's a self described ""high functioning sociopath"", with no people skills; but he's brilliant, driven and dresses wonderfully.  Dr. John Watson is not a patsy (not a sidekick - he's a partner); sharp, wry, worldly man of action who tolerates Sherlock's idiosyncrasies because he misses the adrenaline edge of combat and seeks meaning in a life after war.  They are evenly matched although Sherlock draws the attention and enmity of their foes - Watson is a good second.

The writing is engaging, cheeky, smart and fast paced. It rolls current technology into the stream of consciousness.  The looks of awe when Sherlock figures it out - and his amusement when he learns he's alone are priceless.  The cinematography, costumes, lighting and use of text overlays to move the story along are well placed and impressive on their own.

But the intelligence of the show is its presumption in the interest of the watcher; therefore moving with alacrity, flexibility and certain undefinable element of charm missing from many US shows (the brilliant but cancelled Life with Damian Lewis excluded).  I'm a US viewer lucky enough to have a friend in the UK - but this show should gain followers worldwide with the power to draw from the past literary works and latch onto the current to slingshot us into the future of TV - for thinking people.",1283299200,818,1378,4.935064935064935

4190889,1,B003TO541O,"At the time of this writing, late December 2017, there are renewed threats that the terrible Sherlock television show might be revived. Im begging that this vile piece of filth  which never should have existed in the first place  not be given yet more time to damage the true Sherlock Holmes! This show is an abomination from first to last, making people think that Sherlock Holmes was a murderous creepy sociopath, Watson had a psychosomatic wound (with all the A to A-0.1 range that Martin Freemans little sputtering double-take Jim/Hobbit skill can generate), that Mary is a ninja and Mrs. Hudson is the widow of a drug dealer and Irene Adler is a dominatrix, and that Mycroft and Moriarty were . . . whatever that was that those terrible terrible actors, Mark Gatiss and Andrew Scott tried to portray.

When I first heard about a new Sherlock Holmes television show several years ago, to be produced by BBC Wales, I was thrilled. Ive been an avid reader and collector of literally thousands of stories about the original true Holmes since I was a boy in the 1970s. (Ive even written some Holmes stories and novels, and edited a lot of other Holmes anthologies.) Soon, in spite of my initial enthusiasm, I was disappointed to see that this new show was going to be set in modern times. This has been done before in several films, so it was not a new or original idea  do these clowns have any original ideas? Additionally, there have been shows such as House that lift many Sherlockian aspects, giving us even more versions of a modern Holmes. The thing these modern versions have in common is that they are not actually about Sherlock Holmes, a character born in the 1850s, and working as a consulting detective in the Victorian and Edwardian ages. These modern takes are instead about a character that has the same name, a few personality quirks, and little else.

Of course, when I first saw Sherlock I was mightily disappointed. Still, Im just one voice, and it went on to be wildly popular, with many people arguing that it didn't matter if it was set in the correct era, as long as the characters had the correct names. I have to disagree with that. As Ive explained before elsewhere: Imagine a new movie re-make featuring a character named Luke Skywalker, who lives in a dusty desert Old West town and meets a crazy old prospector/ex-soldier named Ben Kenobi. They find out about a girl that needs to be rescued, and they hire a roguish wagon driver, Hans, and his big hairy unintelligible tobacco-chewing side-kick (named Chew Bacer) to take them somewhere. Then, there is some big-shot with a pun-like name similar to Darth Vader who has a Death Train  kind of like the one in the Lone Ranger movie  and so on. The character names are the same or very similar, and there are all sorts of winks and nods to the original fans, showing that the creators are very familiar with the original material  as the Bard said, The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose  but if its not actually set in the stars, then it isn't Star Wars anymore.

As the show Sherlock progressed, many people who had initially enjoyed it came to dislike it, as it wandered farther and farther from Sherlock Holmes, becoming a shrine to how clever Gatiss and Moffat think they are. As things stand following their desecration, Holmes is a drug addict murderer and Mary Watson is a global assassin. How does that fit at all with the true Canon?

When it was first teased that there was going to be a stand-alone episode of the show, in what came to be The Abominable Bride, setting Holmes and Watson back in the correct Victorian era, I was cautiously optimistic. Gatiss and Moffat stated in interviews that they had the chance to film Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman as Holmes and Watson the way they were supposed to be, back to basics. Photos were released throughout the process showing the actors in period costume and on appropriate sets. Over and over, it was indicated that this was going to be a unique episode, wherein Holmes and Watson would be in the correct time period, with no explanation whatsoever. It would be completely separate from the modern-day version, which had concluded Season 3 by sending Sherlock, that modern-day alternate universe simulacrum of the true Holmes, into exile following his cold-blooded murder of a rich criminal.

On the night of the premiere, January 1st, 2016, the episode ran in England five hours before appearing in the U.S. Before the 9pm showing here in the U.S., I had four emails from friends warning me, including one that indicated there were some modern aspects. However, we settled in to watch. The first hour was okay. It was exceptionally well filmed, I didn't mind some of the snappy in-joke dialogue, and I didn't object to the film techniques of reenacting the crimes as seen from the sitting room, or having Holmes grab the floating newspaper articles in his mind. I thought that was the modern part that I had been told/warned about.

And then, at around the one hour mark, that exceptionally terrible actor  and I cant overstate that fact enough, hes simply awful  Andrew Scott, shows up as a Moriarty hallucination. The room starts to shake and rock, and suddenly were back on the airplane in modern times, where Season 3 left off. My blood pressure spiked in anger so much that my head hurt, and  to paraphrase a character in A Study in Scarlet  I believe I would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed from my nose and relieved me. Actually, I didn't have a nose bleed, but I probably needed to.

For it turned out that Gatiss and Moffat had  no surprise here  proven to be liars.

The next half hour devolved into a mess in which Holmes was drug-hallucinating the whole 1890s segment in order to figure out how Moriarty in the present had supposedly survived. It then went through a whole round-about of dreams within dreams  a concept blatantly stolen from Inception  and alternate realities wherein the modern version might be a story told by the 1890s Holmes or the 1890s version might be a drug hallucination from the present  a concept blatantly stolen from a Deep Space 9 episode, and probably a number of other things blatantly stolen that I don't even recognize.

In the end, I wasn't surprised, as Gatiss and Moffat just cant help themselves. I don't watch Doctor Who, but I can only imagine the pain felt by some of those true fans as these people ruin their character too. I do know that when Gatiss adapted the Poirot episode The Big Four, he stated that the novel that it was based on was an almost unadaptable mess. He certainly unadapted it, all right. In fact, he ruined it. There were parts of it that should NOT have been changed or eliminated, but of course he did. Theres a reason certain books and characters are beloved across generations, and it constantly amazes me that script writers like Gatiss think that they can do better than the original authors when messing up original material that has millions of loyal followers for a reason.

 The Abominable Bride can only be rewatched if one only views the 1890s segments that relate to the Ricoletti investigation  most of the first hour, and a very few pieces from the last half-hour  ignoring the modern dreck tacked on to it. Ive had to do this kind of thing before. For instance, Ive re-read several times the first two chapters of The Last Sherlock Holmes Story by Michael Dibdin, but I go no further, as the rest of the book is a spurious addition that only damages Holmes. The same is true for Sherlock  To paraphrase Doyle: It takes peoples minds from better things.

No one needs to see Mr. Cumberbatch say something snarky or cute while wearing a cool coat. I could not care less specifically about Benedict Cumberbatch, et al. Ive never in my life watched a film or TV show just because it had a certain actor in it. I watch for characters. It doesnt matter to me if Indiana Jones is played by Harrison Ford or Sean Patrick Flanery or River Phoenix, as long as they get the character of Indiana Jones right. Cumberbatchs Holmes was almost right for 2/3s of The Abominable Bride, as close as some other actors have come, and the whole thing could have been really great  the first time that Cumberbatch had actually played the true Holmes on screen  but then they went off in the weeds. And then they went off a cliff. And the episodes that followed simply became too loathsome for even many crazed fans. This sickening show should die.

Gatiss and Moffat claim to respect The Canon, and that there would be no modern adaptations, as they wanted to direct people back to the originals. But they had no problems putting out their terrible versions as comics, and also defiling the original stories by putting out versions with Cumberbatch and Bilbo Baggins on the cover. Hypocrites to the end.

Tell Gatiss and Moffat I said so. Tell them I hate their stinking show and what they're trying to do to the True Sherlock Holmes. Tell them to go try to ruin something else instead.",1514592000,3,9037,4.637445209768315

4190896,5,B003TO541O,"The first season is fun because it strikes the right balance between humor and drama.

Of course, it's no revelation that Benedict Cumberbatch is a revelation as Holmes.  Prior to Sherlock, I was unfamiliar with his work and the initial press that heralded his portrayal of Holmes initially left me uncertain as to whether I'd enjoy it.  Well, my misgivings were unfounded and he is of course brilliant in the role.  His delivery of Holmes's deductive monologues as written in this series is spot-on; the cadence and his expression are perfect for this post-modern Holmes.  I say ""post-modern"" because many of the institutions which provided context for the original release of the Holmes stories have changed or no longer exist--in fact, as the original run of the stories reached its twilight, they were becoming anachronistic even then.

The plots and science are clever in these stories, but it is the relationship between Holmes and Watson that makes this iteration (and any of them, really) work.  That's the raison d'etre for any Holmes and Watson story.  In this case, we also have the splendid portrayal by Martin Freeman as a weary, put-upon Watson who still has so much dignity and integrity.  We get a strong Watson who is still plausibly wowed by Holmes's brilliance, one who's still the brave man of action, but is also mentally and emotionally capable of standing up to Holmes.  This portrayal is close to how Watson was originally written, but with a modern twist added.

The chemistry is solid between these two and this allows for humor that isn't slapstick or derived from implausible reactions from the characters.

The production values are high and I'm glad they kept it to three episodes per series to maintain quality control.  I cannot recommend the first season highly enough for any Holmes fan--be they rabid or casual.",1511049600,,1846,4.954545454545454

The acting is great.  I truly believe the neurosis of the lead character played by Cumberbatch, but I think even more interesting is Dr. Watson played by Freeman.

4190954,2,B003TO541O,"Glad I got this from the library because I was not impressed. First of all, the show is too long at 90 minutes each. If I wanted to watch a movie, I'd get a movie. Second, it just doesn't hold my attention. Thirdly, I don't care for the fast talking Sherlock. It is difficult to keep up with what he is saying. Also, only 3 episodes (6 if you know each is double a regular US episode) per season is crazy. I'm glad I got mine from the library instead of paying for it. Watched 2 shows and will be returning it with the 3rd not watched.

Elementary, the American version of Sherlock Holmes is much, much better. The characters, character interactions (Watson is Lucy Liu, an American actress, and Sherlock is Jonny Lee Miller, a British actor), and story lines are much better and more humor. I would say there may be 2 or 3 shows in each season that I could have done without but overall very good. It also has 24, 42 minute shows (about 1,000 minutes per season compared to Sherlock's 270 minutes).",1485993600,,999,4.342245989304812

Plots are dense, fast-moving and involving.  I also love it that each episode is 1.5 hours long, so story-telling doesn't feel abbreviated.",1485907200,,298,5.5777777777777775
4190956,5,B003TO541O,"Not sure what I can say that others haven't already said...

+ Great modern take on the legend and his sidekick.

+ Speaking of modern...the simple fact that they can use cell phones and technology can be a help or hindrance is a great touch

+ Episodes are like mini-movies running close to 90-minutes each

-- Only 3 episodes (6 regular 45min episodes) for a season. What is up with British TV doing a ""season"" in so few episodes?!? Here in the States we expect 13 to 24 forty-five minute episodes.

Episode 1 A Study in Pink
+ Good ""origin"" story of how the characters get connected and wind up at 221B
+ The episode with the most humor
+ We get to see Watson contribute to their team the most in this episode

Episode 2 The Blind Banker
+ Less humor than episode 1, but still some key lines that give one a good laugh
+ Seems a more complex mystery than Episode 1, but that just means I had to pay attention a lot more
+ More background and Sherlock's homeless network introduced

Episode 3 The Great Game
+ Moriarty introduced and he isn't what many of us expect. I was left with uncertainty at his character interpretation...until we see him in later episodes and now re-watching this episode I find he is a serious threat, even though it may be a bit downplayed in this episode
+ A serious episode, almost no humor that I can remember
+ We get more into Sherlock's sociopathic intelligence. A great development to the character

At first I wasn't sure about Cumberbatch as Sherlock, but he has grown on me.
Freeman as Watson works more for me more in the first episode than in the later episodes.
But their friendship starts to grow as quickly as episode 2, which is great to see how Watson handles a socially-inept / uncaring personality like Sherlock's.

While Watson was always the receiver of occasional ribbing in the original books and movies, this Watson, an Afghan War vet, is berated and picked on by this dandy, spoiled-brat Sherlock to the point where I was hoping he'd beat the daylights out of him.

I would have given this Blu-ray version 5 stars; however the ending in the 3rd episode (The Great Game involving Moriarty) was cut out (or was different from the PBS episode) - quite a disappointment. Amazon did not indicate which version - UK version or PBS version.  My 2-star rating is directed at Amazon for leaving-out important information.  In the PBS episode, Moriarty had taken Sherlock and Dr. Watson (wearing a vest wired with explosives) hostages by a swimming pool.  Moriarty's plan to have Sherlock and Dr. Watson shot by unseen assassins got thwarted when Moriarty received a phone call (unknown caller).  The episode ended when Moriarty declared something like ""another day"" and left the scene with Sherlock and Dr. Watson unharmed.  Episode 1 and 2 (A Study in Pink, The Blind Banker respectively) merit 5 stars.  The Commentaries and Special Features are excellent.",1477267200,,1055,5.093023255813954

One of the first things I thought to be odd, there was only 3 episodes on season 1. Some of the words are slurred and hard to understand, especially when Sherlock gets wound up. It's hard for any actor to follow in the footsteps of the great Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, many have tried. Overall I think the show is good and there still feeling out there parts and trying things to make it better.",1475884800,,540,4.41

Okay, the first episode was frustrating since I couldn't figure out why the brilliant Sherlock took so long to tumble to the cabbie's part in it - I figured that out a long time earlier than he did, but I don't know if the film maker planned it that way, since the viewer gets to see things Sherlock doesn't see.  Int he long run, it was the motives and the villain in the background that had to be discovered.  The relationship between Sherlock and John Watson is good and the exploration of the effect of war/adrenaline/addiction to danger are all themes that are highly pertinent.",1470787200,,659,4.71304347826087

It's a really smart and sometimes surprisingly emotional show that's ultimately about the friendship and love between the two leads, but every supporting character is wonderful.  I particularly love the landlady Mrs. Hudson, she's hilarious.  The tone of the show is quite unique--fun and dark in a widely-appealing British way.",1464652800,,490,5.48

4191105,1,B003TO541O,"Guess I'm in a minority opinion here but I just couldn't get into the revamped Holmes, and not just because I'm partial to the far superior Jeremy Brett version of Holmes. It's the fact that in modernizing Holmes they've made him far too mechanical, detached and frequently annoying. Plus watching this series Cumberbatch's Holmes seems less like a genius and more like a Rainman-style autistic. He isn't particularly charming or intriguing but irritating. More troubling is how the BBC has to amp up the sexuality/gay references, much like the new Doctor Who. Is this really necessary, or is the audience more intended to me mature 40-somethings and not all-age viewers?
The other thing is just how copious the cheesiness of this series is. Maybe its the writing, maybe it's the acting, I don't know, but I can't watch any of this for long without shaking my head and wanting to see something else.",1462752000,6,899,4.882352941176471

4191187,1,B003TO541O,"I was excited to watch this based on recommendations from friends.  I like characters that are flawed, difficult, troubled, moody - and that is what I expected from a show about a genius/addict rooming with an Afghan vet with PTSD.

This Sherlock has flaws that are barely a micrometer deep.  He's arrogant - but his arrogance hints at no depths:  it doesn't come across as the defensive posturing of a lifelong outsider, or a painful side effect of being extremely cerebral.  As played by the actor, it's just pure immature obnoxiousness.

This Watson had nothing to do but walk in Holmes' shadow.  In fact, in their first scenes together Holmes orders him around and treats him in a way no normal person would accept.  Yet, Watson does accept it.  His meek submission to the Great Man was a ridiculous character choice as well as a huge missed opportunity for conflict and dramatic tension.

The tricky Holmesian deductions were interesting and fun the first time, predictable the second time.  I could too easily imagine the writers brainstorming to invent miniscule (and completely ridiculous) ""clues"", like:  ""Suppose Sherlock figures out Watson's sibling is a drunk by noticing little scratches on her cell phone where the charger inserts - proving she has the shaking hands of a drinker.  We'll ignore all the other reasons hands shake (essential tremor, Parkinsonism, and cerebellar stroke, off the top of my head) and hope the audience goes ooh and aah over this faked-up stroke of genius.""

Most appalling was the idiotic stereotyping, which made this visually ultramodern show seem absurdly retro, like an ancient sit-com.  To save you from buying the disc out of curiosity, I'll tell you about all the female characters in the first two eps.

Episode one

First female (Screen time:  two minutes):  a timid and subservient lab tech.  Holmes is rude to her; she adores him anyway; she timorously primps for him; he humiliates her for it; she comes back for more abuse; he humiliates her again; she scuttles away but is clearly still smitten. This is comic relief:  Timid smitten females who asks to be humiliated are amusing.

Second female (screen time:  one minute):  an effusive and subservient landlady.  Holmes is rude to her; she adores him anyway; he orders her to wait on him; she protests but meekly obeys while fluttering about like a goose; then Watson joins in and orders her to wait on him as well; she protests but meekly obeys with more fluttering.  This is the next spot of comic relief:  Fluttery obsequious females who asks to be exploited are amusing.

Third female (screen time:  three minutes):  a cop who is strong and opinionated.  Sherlock announces loudly that she is dating one of the male cops.  He adds that she was at his home recently and spent some time on her knees.  This is the third spot of comic relief:  castrating bitches who dare to dislike our Sherlock must be sexually demeaned as punishment.
.
Second ep

First female (screen time:  four minutes):  a Demure Oriental Beauty.  Scenario of Trite:  She pours tea in a mysterious Eastern-y way, while Chinese music plays. She's enigmatic and soft-spoken.  She reappears later to tell a story of her victimhood at the hands of a Chinese gang.

Second female character (screen time:  about fifteen minutes):  Watson's date, who is strong and opinionated.  Scenario of Trite:  The writers undo her prior strength by plugging her into their Helpless-Damsel-in-Jeopardy climax.  She's bound, gagged, screaming, sobbing! then rescued in the nick of time by Watson! just before a crossbow bolt can skewer her!  Then she faints.  I kid you not.

Third female character (screen time:  about five minutes):  two-dimensional Spidery Chinese Villainness.  She gets shot at the end.  Meh, whatever.

Fourth female character: a timid secretary (screen time:  90 seconds).  Scenario of Trite:  she was having an affair with her powerful boss who didn't appreciate her.  When she learns that a jade pin given by her ex-lover is worth a fortune, she responds like a character on Three's Company:  literally throws her hands in the air, shrieks, jumps up, runs out of the room, shrieking hysterically the whole way.  (And leaving said hairpin in Holmes's possession.)  We're back to comic relief:  silly females going into hysterics are amusing.

I kept checking the calendar to see if I had been swept back to nineteen seventy-three.  Apparently BBC has.  It's really disheartening to see how many people think this show is smart and sophisticated!

However, the most disappointing scene, hands-down, has to be the tease of Watson coming home to discover Holmes unwinding with a shot of heroin after his stressful day.  For a moment there, I thought the character was actually going to be interesting.  My bad.  It turns out there's no heroin; it's just a stupid fake-out, and what Holmes is sighing orgiastically over is the rush (??) from three nicotine patches that he's applied to his forearm.

I'm sad, thinking of all the great places this show could have gone, if it had an ounce of daring or even just decent characterization and a likable star.",1451779200,4,5135,4.946009389671362

4191192,5,B003TO541O,"This show deserves more than five stars.  It's a six or seven star series if anything.  I wasn't sure I would enjoy a modern version of Sherlock Holmes, but this series is fabulous.  It's well and smartly written with dry wit, sharp comments, and wonderful turns of phrase.  Sherlock himself is as brilliant and flawed as we've come to expect and fits very well into a world of high tech, though he still lacks in the social skills dept.  Dr Watson proves to be his foil and his match as he comes into contact with Sherlock when they both need a flatmate.  He quickly ends up in Sherlock's world of intrigue and murder, running around London helping and annoying the police in the process.  Mycroft is also nicely done, but the real icing is the series portrayal of Sherlock's nemesis, Moriarty.  Oh my, that man is scary.  I mean, really freaky smart, freaky weird, dangerous and terrifying.

The DVD includes three episodes and each builds on the other until we get to the cliffhanger end of the last one.  If you don't already have Season 2 when you watch this one you will probably run right out and get it just to see what happens next.  Much as I love the new series of Sherlock movies...this tv show is more than a match for it.

Very highly recommended.  A smart show with great characters and complex stories and brilliant acting.  What more can you ask?",1450828800,,1363,4.506122448979592

4191194,5,B003TO541O,"Didn't want to enjoy this show.  I don't like crime shows as a rule. Besides that, the Jeremy Brett version of Sherlock Holmes won my loyalty years ago, and no one could do it half so intelligently or with such finesse, could they?  It just wasn't possible.
So I resisted.  For over a year.  When finally made to sit with my teenaged Sherlock fanatic and watch the show as I sewed my way through a lot of hand applique,...well,...it was all over.  Sorry, Jeremy.  Game, set, and match.

While entirely updated in every way, this version of Conan Doyle's classic series is also satisfyingly faithful to the tone and spirit of the novels.
Sherlock does what the best adaptations do; with a keen grasp of the essential elements of the original, it opens them up, breathes in fresh air, adds a twist of respectful inventiveness, and brings to life something entirely new and yet totally recognizeable.

Not only is this adaptation of the Sherlock novels absorbing in it's sleek, complicated pacing and textures, but for maybe the first time ever, Watson becomes a fully realized character in his own right, played by Martin Freeman. Now THAT was a serendipitous bit of casting.  Finally, Sherlock has a sidekick who isn't merely a sidekick, but capable of carrying the heart of the story, and the audience into it with him, and maybe that's why, finally, the stories actually have a heart.  Benedict Cumberbatch as the title character naturally gets the hearthrob marketing for the series, but it's Freeman's performance as Sherlock's foil and interpreter, that succeeds in investing freshness and humanity into a rather tired, over-blown tale.",1450051200,2,1640,4.930909090909091

Was shy about Robert Downey & Jude Law's movies until I bit the bullet and bought them.

I always thought Watson got the short end of the stick and Holmes humiliated him out of boredom.  It's in most of the movie adaptions - sorry Rathbone & Bruce.  Was thrilled that the new movies have done away with this.  Watson has been a partner and less of a comedy relief.  BBC radio did a marvelous adaption of the stories that gave voice to this partnership.

Sherlock and Watson are fantastic together. The stories are definitely out there, but are still witty and entertaining. It's really well written and well done all the way around.

I'm sorry I waited so long to finally see it.  It's a clever adaptation of Sherlock Holmes that is very faithful to the original in spirit. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are perfect as Sherlock and John.  It's a compelling presentation of a contemporary Sherlock.

I was hooked from the very beginning and waited on pins and needles for the second season to come out on DVD. Compared to the RD Jr Sherlock movies, the BBC Sherlock series seems a bit darker, and goes more in depth than a movie really can, I think.

4191298,2,B003TO541O,"I could barely get through two episodes. Sherlock is completely miscast. Cumberbatch looks far too young for this role; he would be better suited in a role as a computer hacker.  Beyond the casting, this show's Watson & Sherlock are so far from Doyle's creation that they might as well have different names.  Rather than having Watson as the normal, right-hand man to the eccentric, ever-logical genius Holmes, we have a Watson who acts as a babysitter for the petulant Holmes who is likely to throw a tantrum at various points in the show.  As for the so-called mysteries, most of the inferences Holmes makes are so ridiculous that they're laughable.  Also, the PC gratuitous gay references are over the top:  The way this show makes it seem, no two men can possibly walk into a bar, a restaurant or basically anywhere unless they're a gay couple. I counted seven gay references in the first 30 minutes of the first episode. What's the point of that? I don't watch shows so that I can get a political agenda shoved down my throat.  Besides all that, the show is just boring. It needs tighter editing.",1435795200,3,1101,4.649484536082475

 This series had real potential, unfortunately, it was totally unrealized.  Most of the actors were fine, though the Moriarty character lost his menace and instead was given a double serving of petulance, the locations were beautiful, and the cinematography interesting.  Lot's of swell camera shots.
 Too bad that the revised stories were mostly moronic, banal, predictable and really tested my patience.

This season focuses on Dr. Watson (Martin Freeman) an Afghanistan War Vet who needs to find an apartment and a roommate.  This roommate ends up being non other the Sherlock Holmes, (Benedict Cumberbatch) who is a Consulting Detective.

Together they get into all sorts of adventures.  This series is much like the series with Basil Rathbone, which also took place in contemporary times.  It is not a reverent series whatsoever.  Sherlock is not a fully likeable character-he is often contemptuous of others and he does drugs.  Nonetheless, this series is really interesting.

4191390,2,B003TO541O,"A modernized Sherlock Holmes that isn't entirely faithful to the spirit of the original novels.  They try too hard to be politically correct (replacing actual smoking wiht a 3 nicotine patch solution)  and have made this Holmes too narcicistic; Watson isn't much better than the Nigel Bruce version as a somewhat dottering side kick--but the Basil Rathbone's incarantion of the novels had more heart.  I find this Holmes to be to icily aloof, too inhuman.  In the original novels, Hollmes actually cared about people and wanted to help them--this Holmes is all about his own ego and superiority.
I must admit that I liked this version intially, but after thenRobert Downing Junior/Judd Law movies and the American Elementary have really given it up--a shame really because it had so much potential to be something great.  It's an anemic shadow of the greatness of the original series of novels and is too much in love with itself to give the audience much to love about it.

My advise is to check out Elementary first before investing much time in this incarnation.  That Holmes, though egocentric, really cares about people.",1425254400,4,1125,4.952127659574468

Benedict Cumberbach does a heroic job. The style of the production is definitely contemporary. Entirely entertaining and and not terribly compromised.

The new movies are great, I really liked the feel they gave the characters in them. But then I found this series from the BBC, & was totally blown away. It's brilliant! Every episode!
 I hate reality TV with a passion, but it seems like, on TV, that's all there is anymore. They're  cheap to make, cause everyone on it (& watching it) just shuts they're brains off & go. There are no WRITERS & it shows. So I was thrilled when this show came along. I was beginning to think this kind of TV was lost. Smart, intelligent, & something you actually have to think & keep up with. What a breath of fresh air!
This is not the Sherlock Holmes of the 1800's (which I love). The creators brought Sherlock into today. And it works so brilliantly with the Sherlock of old, & all his quirky trappings, that we have loved & become so familiar with over the years. The writing is so well thought out & engaging. The characters are wonderfully fleshed out & real. The acting is spot on & fun to watch.
I think it's the best TV on TV. If you're a Sherlock fan of old (or new), you will love this show. Buy this season & then buy the others while you're getting this one, because after you see the 1st show you'll be happy you got the others.",1422316800,,1333,4.203125

4191472,5,B003TO541O,"Sherlock Holmes has to be one of the most filmed characters ever. How can you improve Jeremy Brett's portrayal of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's most famous character? Well you can move it to the 21st century and have Benedict Cumberbatch play the title role. Add the able assistance of Martin Freeman as Dr. Watson and all the care that the UK drama industry can apply to something and the result is simply epic.

Series 1 is quite short with only two episodes and the pilot for a total of three episodes. Each is approximately 90 minutes in length and keeps you riveted to the chair as you watch the plots unfold. I haven't actually read any of the Sherlock stories or even seen many of the films and so I can come at these fairly fresh. Cumberbatch's portrayal as Sherlock as a ""high functioning sociopath"" is perfect and the visual effects which enlighten his thought processes keep the story moving. Martin Freeman gives Watson a personality and life of his own which also adds to the atmosphere.

This is great. It might shock Holmes traditionalists but there's not a dull moment and the tension is built so carefully that these will become future classics. I think I might still prefer Lewis but this is coming sooooo close....",1419120000,,1228,4.654377880184332

""Fiction in any form has always intended to be realistic...

Everything written with vitality expresses that vitality; there are no dull subjects, only dull minds. All men who read escape from something else into what lies behind the printed page; the quality of the dream may be argued, but its release has become a functional necessity. All men must escape at times from the deadly rhythm of their private thoughts. It is part of the process of life among thinking beings. It is one of the things that distinguish them from the three-toed sloth; he apparently-one can never be quite sure-is perfectly content hanging upside down on a branch, and not even reading Walter Lippmann. I hold no particular brief for the detective story as the ideal escape. I merely say that all reading for pleasure is escape, whether it be Greek, mathematics, astronomy, Benedetto Croce, or The Diary of the Forgotten Man. To say otherwise is to be an intellectual snob, and a juvenile at the art of living...

In everything that can be called art there is a quality of redemption. It may be pure tragedy, if it is high tragedy, and it may be pity and irony, and it may be the raucous laughter of the strong man. But down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid. The detective in this kind of story must be such a man. He is the hero, he is everything. He must be a complete man and a common man and yet an unusual man. He must be, to use a rather weathered phrase, a man of honor, by instinct, by inevitability, without thought of it, and certainly without saying it. He must be the best man in his world and a good enough man for any world. I do not care much about his private life; he is neither a eunuch nor a satyr; I think he might seduce a duchess and I am quite sure he would not spoil a virgin; if he is a man of honor in one thing, he is that in all things. He is a relatively poor man, or he would not be a detective at all. He is a common man or he could not go among common people. He has a sense of character, or he would not know his job. He will take no man's money dishonestly and no man's insolence without a due and dispassionate revenge. He is a lonely man and his pride is that you will treat him as a proud man or be very sorry you ever saw him. He talks as the man of his age talks, that is, with rude wit, a lively sense of the grotesque, a disgust for sham, and a contempt for pettiness. The story is his adventure in search of a hidden truth, and it would be no adventure if it did not happen to a man fit for adventure. He has a range of awareness that startles you, but it belongs to him by right, because it belongs to the world he lives in.

If there were enough like him, I think the world would be a very safe place to live in, and yet not too dull to be worth living in.""  The Simple Art of Murder, Raymond Chandler, 1950.

Chandler's heroes, such as Philip Marlowe, are essentially conservative.  They are not ""anything goes"" moral relativists of the liberal school.  On the contrary, they have a code of honor by which they live and sometimes die.  Even the politically liberal Dashiell Hammet was a creator of conservative fiction in this sense.

Moreover, the structure of the mystery is intrinsically conservative.  Crime has put the world out of joint and the hero detective must restore order in a world that constantly seems to be spinning out of control.  The conservative principle is, at its heart, a struggle against the forces of entropy and chaos.  The detective/hero re-establishes order by bringing the criminal to justice even when this may contravene the law (e.g. Agatha Christ and Murder on the Orient Express).  By doing so, he struggles towards redemption.

Have you seen the new BBC production of Sherlock (three seasons produced thus far)?  It is simply a revelation of how good television can actually be.  This Holmes and Watson (an Afghanistan veteran) are set in 21st century London.  The writing on the show sparkles and is constantly allusive to its source material while at the same time being thoroughly modern.  Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch) is the ""complete man and yet an unusual man"" that Chandler praises while Watson (Martin Freeman) fulfills the role of the ""common man."" Dr. Watson blogs.  Holmes has a web site and uses nicotine patches instead of smoking a pipe.  Irene Adler, ""the woman,"" is a high-class sex worker.  This Holmes is assuredly ""a man fit for adventure"" with ""a range of awareness that startles you"" at every turn.

Holmes famously is indifferent to whether the earth rotates around the sun or vice versa.  The world's meaning lay entirely in the sphere of the ethical as far as Sherlock Holmes was concerned.  The brute facts of natural science were only of real interest when they could be put to use in serving an ethical end (e.g. solving the crime).

Sherlock Holmes is the embodiment of conservatism on so many different levels.  First, he is a practical Aristotelian examining the world and making deductions* based on his findings.  Second, to consult with Sherlock is to enter into a free and private transaction (Adam Smith would approve!) because government based solutions (the police) are so clearly inadequate.  Third, Sherlock Holmes prefers reason over feeling, thought over emotion.  Fourth, through his work, he restores the moral order of the universe.  Finally, Holmes and Watson celebrate the importance of male comradeship.

The success of Sherlock tells us that conservatism remains utterly relevant in the 21st century.

Plan your escape with Sherlock!

* Technically, it should be ""inductions"" but Arthur Conan Doyle conflated ""induction"" and ""deduction"" in the original canon and Sherlock perpetuates the error.  If I wake up in the morning and observe that the streets are wet, I would usually ""induce"" that it rained during the night, in spite of the possibility that the water mains may have burst .  Induction, therefore, involves the calculation of probability.  If all men are mortal, and Socrates is a man, then I may correctly ""deduce"" that Socrates is mortal.  ""Deduction"" demands a logical necessity.  If Sherlock Holmes notices the cigar ashes on my vest and ""induces"" that I am partial to Montecristos, it could be that I am a non-smoker who brushed up against someone in the tube that morning.  Sherlock Holmes is, correctly speaking, a master of ""induction.""

4191526,2,B003TO541O,"What did a re-boot and an additional half-hour lose?

Lets begin with the most obvious and essential aspect to the new series.

Unlike the Steampunk, Matrix and Rumble in the Bronx mash-up the motion pictures starring Robert Downey, Jr and Jude Law delivered, Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss are telling the right story.

If we were discussing Beethovens 5th Symphony, the comparison would be akin to PDQ Bach and Walter Murphy.  And though, both introduce modern elements, the former utterly trashes the basis as well as the theme while the latter fully preserves the raison detre.

The unaired version had well-placed non sequiturs, which through bad judgment or piss-poor editing ceased to exist except as mere lines of no import in the aired version.

Conciseness limited the original presentation to a development vehicle for Holmes and Watson with only Lestrad and Mrs Hudson providing foundation - no Mycroft, no Moriarty. The blocking and sound were so properly coordinated and edited so to provide a seamless and understated presence allowing the dialog its correct role mortaring the visual.  It was well-paced, dark, edgy and dangerous but with sharp details permitting, though not requiring, a thoughtful audience.

The re-boot, including its present-day need to make all things revolve around homos, threw away any attempt at intelligence, preferring, in its slap at Doyle, to copy the spoon-fed tripe found in the motion pictures.  There was no story, no continuity, only collisions as various arcs vied for attention.  Scenes that provided the original with visual insight into the storys narrative, though included somewhat in this re-hash, changed the narrative person producing only confused afterthoughts rather than recollections.  The sound editing is no better than the misbegotten idea to include textual visual effects.  Apparently,  cacophonous music layered over the remaining tweaked and reassigned dialog was thought to provide the necessary glue lacking in the poorly blocked scenes.

Mark Gatiss is not Sir Alfred Hitchcock and sadly, his need for a screen presence inevitably diminishes the final product.  For another example, see his work as Professor Cavor in his 2010 made-for-TV remake of the 1964 H.G. Wells motion picture classic The First Men in the Moon.  The best that effort produced was Cavors self-deprecating probably.

The actors are, for the most part, well selected and adapted for their roles, only the (re)direction interferes with the delivery.

It is my hope subsequent episodes shall return to the look and feel of the unaired pilot rather than the abortion that actually aired.",1415145600,,2629,5.309178743961352

Midern times did nothing to destroy the story and the clever intertwining of technology was exactly as one would imagine Sherlock would use it!!  One of my favorite characters is Mrs. Hudson.

4191586,5,B003TO541O,"I got into this series when I had just finished an episode of Downton Abbey on PBS and left the TV on while doing some homework. I was pulled in immediately! When compared against the later seasons, this season is focused more on the cases, whereas later it becomes more about characters and relationships (though the cases are still excellent). I've loved Sherlock Holmes since I read Hound of the Baskervilles in high school and later bought a book with all the short stories in it. I can't get into that show on CBS (Elementary) because it reminds me more of the typical crime/police drama with a Sherlock character thrown in. I find the Sherlock movies with Robert Downey Jr to be very enjoyable and action packed, but this show is in a league of its own. For someone who never buys TV shows on DVD, it's kind of incredible that I now happily own all of the seasons, even though I have the episodes recorded on my DVR.

That worked wonderfully because I love all things Sherlock Holmes and have done since I was a child reading books, then the Basil Rathbone movies shown on TV.  By the way.

4191608,1,B003TO541O,"A ""Sherlock"" whose actor projects his voice like he is always ""on"" a stage, who is too young to have had any mysterious past, who has a computer-programmed brain rather than one based on exotic experiences, who seems to CRAVE attention rather than walk in the shadows... who is rude rather than reclusive... and what's this about hugging a landlady he hardly knows?  This is a Sherlock-if-he-had-been-raised-in-daycare portrayal -- a far cry from AC Doyle's original brilliant creation. The plots are cartoonish -- Sherlock ""solves"" a puzzle simply because a woman wearing pink is going to carry pink luggage (blue luggage if she had been wearing blue, I suppose?). Sexist overtones with the ordering of the housekeeper BY BOTH MEN to serve them food, and the treatment of the only other female figure (detective) is overtly dismissive. Includes the now-obligatory discussion that a gay roommate is fine (of course). Will no doubt be enough of a distraction for those who, exhausted after a brain-numbing day's work, wish to fool themselves that they are using their brain by just watching these episodes flicker in front of them.  Not nearly interesting enough for those who have read Sir Arthur Conan Doyle'a works and cannot be compared favorably to earlier Holmes as portrayed by Basil Rathbone and Peter Cushing.",1407715200,17,1317,5.092592592592593

Correction. It is apparently region free, but as the one I got is not the one listed but rather a UK disc in 1080i50 PAL format that many US Blu-Ray players (including my PS3) won't play, it might as well be the wrong region. I'm still going to return it, and ask for the correct disc to be sent.

The item listed says ""Season One"" at the bottom of the box cover and ""2 DISC SET"" at the bottom right.

4191636,3,B003TO541O,"I just finished watching all 3 seasons of Sherlock and I must admit that is was... not as good as I have heard. I am going to review the entire series. I am going to be very honest. I am not a hipster, nor do I have some bizarre notion that if the show comes from BBC it is automatically better than those found in the US. I am fair and I believe a show must pass on its own merit, not on how cool I will seem for liking it.
First, the good- and there is quite a lot of it. The show is a good one. True to form, BBC assembles a terrific crew with top notch costuming, set designs, and music. It is beautiful to look at and hear. It offers a modern update to the Victorian world of Sherlock Holmes that possesses to-the-moment technological savvy. It works this well, capitalizing on how the original tales displayed a hero who used any and all methods to solve crime.
The cast, too, is fantastic. Benedict Cumberbatch is far better than I expected. He is funny, sharp, and sells the audience on his crazy intellect. He even, once or twice, manages to make Holmes a fully realized character who is more than his rudeness and brilliance. Though- for the most part he is simply a superhero with no tact. Oh, and the 'mind palace' stuff is dreadful and the creators of the show need to forget about it.
Martin Freeman truly shines. His all-too-human Watson is magnetic and immediately accessible. He elevates the show as the single best performer on it. His performance, more than the writing or Cumberbatch's performance, truly grounds the show and makes it seem plausible.
Also outstanding are Mark Gatiss as Mycroft Holmes, Laura Pulver as Irene Adler (though she is woefully under-used), and Amanda Abbington as Mary Watson (though the plot twist surrounding her at the end of season 3 is so awful that it is painful to watch).
The writing for the show, overall, is deeply at odds with itself. The dialog is great and the characterization of most of the players is enjoyable. However, the mysteries aren't particularly hard to deduce. In some cases, they are telegraphed so blatantly that one wonders how stupid Holmes, et al, must be not to see it. The pacing is uneven as well. Too often, a great deal of time is spent in setting up the problem, which is then solved in the final 10 minutes of the show. That is a problem easily overlooked, however, since most mysteries similarly suffer. What haunts Sherlock is that its character moments are too clever for its own good. They are great moments. Brilliant, as a matter of fact, but the writers know it and they dwell on it. This leads to the plot of the episode almost always getting set aside for long tracts of witty banter. It is as if the show gets distracted by its own cleverness. Fortunately, the clever is very, very clever.
So, the show is excellent. 4 to 5 stars depending upon the episode (well, the pilot is a weak link, 3 for it, but it IS a pilot and they are almost universally weak, so slack should be cut).
BUT
The bad guys in this show are crap. Everything good about the show is in its heroes. As soon as the big bads show up, the but starts to smell up the room.
Laura Pulver is the sole exception. Her Catwoman-ish turn as Irene Adler is excellent and she departs the show far too soon.
Lars Mikkelsen is Magnussen in season 3 and while his performance cannot be faulted, the writing for the character is pathetic. He is described by all parties as brilliant and yet when he actually shows up and begins talking, he comes across as petty, insipid, and idiotic. He literally stupids his way to defeat, obviously handing over to the heroes many great reasons to dispose of him and not one for his keeping. It is blunderingly ridiculous.
The villains from A Study in Pink, The Hounds of Baskerville, and The Sign of Three are adequate to the tale at hand, to be sure, but easily forgotten.
The biggest but, and the show's weakest link, is Andrew Scott as Moriarty. Holmes' most notorious villain is here notorious for all the wrong reasons.
I should first say that the part is disastrously written, lacking any menace or subtlty whatsoever. In fact, the role lacks almost all intelligence, as Moriarty comes across as an idiotic drama queen most of the time (In all fairness, his robbery/prison escape/trial plot in the second season was brilliant). That much is not Scott's fault. An actor can only do so much with a crap role (witness Cumberbatch as Kahn, for example).
However, Scott chews the scenery with a ravenous display of campy overacting that would make the cast of the 1966 Batman blush. His choices as an actor reduce the poorly written lines he is delivering into obnoxiousness so overwhelming that I'd likely give the show 2 stars if it were not for his lack of on-screen time. Barbarian Queen II has finer performances. Somehow he won awards for this mess. Don't let those little statues impress you, though. This one's as ill-deserved as handing out a knighthood to Guy Fawlkes.
So, overall, the show is great, but for its villains. Still, it was entertaining enough to make me watch all 3 seasons and be curious about season 4, though with Moriary's unfortunate return I'm not too curious. I guess it boils down to this:
The hype is more impressive than the show.",1406073600,4,5252,4.535300316122234

My biggest complaint is the actor Andrew Scott who plays Sherlock's mortal enemy James Moriarty. Are they serious? He just does not come off like a villainous mastermind. Physically, he's a pale, small in stature, effeminate man who is not in the least bit menacing. His acting is so over the top that it becomes annoying. He sits their warbling in a high pitched voice that sounds like Glinda the Good Witch and hams it up with gawky facial contortions that is completely out of place for the character. He screams like a child having a tantrum with silly lines like ""I'll burn the heart out of you"" with the intensity of Phyllis Diller. He's about as scary and effective as a theatre queen doing a Liza Minelli impersonation. Moriarty should be a composed, brilliant, sinister, imposing and dangerous adversary.

There have been a flood of Sherlock spinoffs and all of them lack any real imagination,  just a re-tuning to match our society's current obsession or comic book hero.

When I finally sat down and watched the first episode I was hooked in 10 minutes. It is brilliantly written and acted,  finding a perfect balance between of being in the modern present and firmly rooted in the past,  lighting fast paced one momement then slow and ponderous the next.

From the very first, this series has made me sit up and cheer.  It took me a while to adjust to Benedict as Holmes.  He wasn't what I was used to or who I had imagined Holmes to be.

Martin Freeman who protrays a more enthusiastic Dr. Watson (as with Jude Law's version) and a fascinating interest in Cumerbatch's Holmes, the interaction between the two actors is well done.

4191744,3,B003TO541O,"The TV drama did a marvelous job at replicating the speed at which Sherlock Holmes was figuring out the conclusion from hints according to the novel. And, both Bene and Martin Freeman were doing great at incarnate the soul of the two main characters (or Protagonists).  CG and sound track were great and gave the new Sherlock Holmes story a new modern air (I particularly like the CG about texting).

However, the story was tuned to a very simple nemesis of Sherlock and Moriarty, and it became a plot of cartoon. The atmosphere of a detective novel which focuses on the complexity of crimes and the beauty of plotting murder(s) on one side and that of probing the plots on the other was just missed in this series. I feel particularly disappointed about it, and cannot be assuaged / compensated by the spectacular sound and visual, which I am sure the production spent a lot of effort in.

Benedict Cumberbatch portrayed Sherlock Holmes just the way he was written in Arthur Conan Doyle's classic.
Martin Freeman may not be the Dr. Watson of Doyle's description, at least not physically. He is in essence the Holmes companion, of Doyle's imagination. The contemporary setting seemed relatively unimportant as the stories unravel and you are drawn in by the characters and the scripts transformation from yesteryear to the present with relative ease.

4191752,5,B003TO541O,"Sherlock is a British television crime drama that presents an up to date adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes detective stories. It was created by Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss. It stars Benedict Cumberbatch, a relative unknown as Sherlock Holmes and Martin Freeman as Doctor John Watson. The first three episodes aired in 2010.

Sherlock depicts Holmes,  who is assisting the Metropolitan Police Service. The person Sherlock talks to is Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade, played by Rupert Graves.  Dr John Watson, who has returned from military service in Afghanistan. Is Holmes roommate.  Holmes has a great conflict with his archnemesis Jim Moriarty, played by Andrew Scott. Holmes has other people who assist him.  Una Stubbs, plays Mrs Hudson, their landlady. The series is thought provoking and innovative. Benedict Cumberbatch is such an unusual star, charismatic as Sherlock who probably has Aspergers. No social skills, very intelligent and obsessive. The series is a hit in almost 200 countries.mwhat could be better, well, the 4th year series.

4191762,5,B003TO541O,"The BBC's contemporary incarnation of Sherlock Holmes is everything I want in a 90-minute TV show. The writing is clever, creative and detailed. Unfortunately, there are only three episodes per season and a long wait between them.

The photography and production quality couldn't be better, and the scenes around London can make you feel like you've been there. Each episode could be a movie, if it were a half-hour longer. (I know, most are less than two hours, but I feel cheated by those.) Musical soundtracks are not supposed to be noticed, and this usually isn't, except for the dramatic open and closing credits theme and a catchy, fast-paced tune that tells us when ""the game is ON.""

The show was created and is written by Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat, producer of DR. WHO, a pair of extreme Sherlock Holmes fans who have skillfully transported Holmes, Watson, and the whole Victorian cast of characters into 21st century London. Rather than simply update each of Doyle's adventures, the writers create new stories that are believable in today's world, yet contain the essence of more than one original mystery. So even if you've read everything Doyle wrote and you've seen all the films, SHERLOCK will surprise you with new twists.

Of course, there is the excellent cast. After years of solid acting in a wide variety of roles on stage and in films, many viewers finally discovered Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock. He probably can't go anywhere without being mobbed, with good looks and a kind demeanor that make him incredibly attractive to women and girls everywhere. Martin Freeman gives Dr. Watson far more personality than any of his predecessors did and for once he's a real working partner to Holmes, rather than just a sidekick. That opens the door to a lot of humor to accompany the serious plots. Una Stubbs as Mrs. Hudson, Mark Gatiss as Mycroft Holmes, Louise Brealey as Molly Hooper, and Rupert Graves as D.I. Lestrade are all completely believable as the people surrounding (and tolerating) the arrogant title character.",1396310400,,2046,4.959183673469388

Here he has a great script and perfect direction and a supporting cast that are wonderful, too.  The equal stars are the camera work and technical aspects that are vibrant but never get in the way.

4191764,5,B003TO541O,"Rule #1...when watching any series be prepared for the cliffhanger ending.  I was prepared because I already had season two on my watch list.  So when I got to the end of episode three...honestly I laughed my a$$ off.  If I had to wait....well....
My favorite episode of all three seasons has been A study in Pink though.  I enjoyed all the others immensely but...I think the portrayal of John Watson was more, lets say intense.  You saw more into his head, or that is how it felt to me.  It was also interesting to study Sherlock Holmes study John Watson in this modern interpretation.
My concern before watching this series was that I am a big fan of the movies and did not want to confuse the two.  No worries.  It was almost easy to separate the two.  I don't know if it is because the movies are based more on the historical view point and the tv series is a modern view point, but I enjoyed how it was essentially the same story but from different view points.  It was almost like both played off the differences to the peak of enjoyment at different ends of the spectrum.  Example? Movie: I really enjoyed the Sherlock vision/fight scenes.  How he anticipates every move and plays it out.  The visual and camera play was interesting and stoked the imagination.  TV Series: The play on phone txt.  I really appreciated how this was used to portray a lot of action or thought..it added that modern touch but again, stoked the imagination.  It also made me, personally, think of the books themselves and to see more of the correlation between the books to the series.  I actually saw more common ground there and loved it!
I would recommend this series to any fan of Sherlock Holmes.",1396224000,,1687,4.496710526315789

4191766,5,B003TO541O,"Benedict Cumberbatch presents us a 21st Century look at the Sherlock Holmes character.  This is not your father's version of Doyle's beloved detective, Cumberbatch's Holmes is a delightfully dark, brilliant, amazing, dangerous and amusing ""high-functioning sociopath"" who makes other depictions of Doyle's hero look either dated or uninspired.  The ensemble of actors who are brought on board as his supporting cast are up to the task of making a Holmes-world that could hardly be topped!

Dedicated readers of the Arthur Conan Doyle novels will see the homages paid to his works, but what we have here is comparable to Jimi Hendrix playing a Bob Dylan song - psychedelic fireworks replacing mournful bleating (apologies to those who like Dylan's voice, if there are those of you reading this).

4191772,4,B003TO541O,"We have seen the three seasons of Sherlock a couple times now. Season one is enjoyable and seems true to the Sherlock Holmes genre. We especially enjoy Benedict Cumberbatch in the role of Holmes; he does an amazing job of acting and portraying the character. All of the main actors do a superb job and make the show worth watching!

The series is not 100% without sexual content and innuendoes, unfortunately. It seems that we cannot make good TV shows and movies without some sexual content, as if that were something everyone is looking for. For many of us, this is disturbing and totally unnecessary. Thankfully, it is not too overbearing in this series of Sherlock.

The episodes are an 1.5 hours in length, which gives you extra time to enjoy each episode. Unfortunately, there are only three episodes per season, which is kind of strange. The season ends with you wishing you had more.

The packaging of the DVDs in this box is better quality than what you sometimes see and the DVDs are well protected. There are a lot of extras in the DVD set as well, which is always a pleasant bonus!",1395964800,,1093,4.5948717948717945

4191774,5,B003TO541O,"Excellent show for the first season.

Excellent writing.
Excellent setting.
Excellent costuming.
Excellent lighting.

Can't say enough about this about how good it is.

Some gay humor, but I can get along with that and in this season it was funny. Unfortunately, they drop Watson's love interest who I thought had a good angle for the show.

I was in the industry as a child actor back in the 70s. Lemme tell you, science has nothing on Hollywood. Lighting angles can change a person's mind. The level and volume and cadence of music employed can change a person's mind. The camera angle has conclusively shown in focus groups to elicit certain emotions in the viewer.

Season 1 = brilliant. I will write a review for Season two. But my recommendation is buy season 1 and forget Season 2.

At three episodes per season, why should we pay some fat producer to tell us his propaganda message? Enjoy Season 1, forget Season 2.",1395878400,,923,4.666666666666667

I'm starting with Season One now and the first episode is so true to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle I'm blown away! The updating of the stories to modern technology is extremely good. It shows off Sherlock's insanity and genius in a fresh, new light, but not deviating from the original concept. I wouldn't have believed it possible!

To take a one hundred year old story line and make it this interesting requires a delightfully devious kind of genius. I feel grateful that the series creators cared so much about Doyle's work that they worked so very hard to get it right, then chose actors who are also committed to excellence. Oh, well done!

Episodes are never dull or boring (in fact, gripping!) and progress at a pace that can be grasped by ""ordinaries"" such as myself.  The court scene in Season 2 is fun beyond words (Sherlock can't help but show-off).

4191792,5,B003TO541O,"The show is incredibly well written, acted and all around great! The show has the best depiction of Sherlock Holmes I've ever seen. If you are a big Benedict Cumberbatch fan, this is acting at his finest. Martin Freeman too! Incredible actors. I like that each episode is like a movie. It allows for great plot development and proper character arcs throughout the season and series.

However, and this has nothing to do with the quality of the show (which is why it didn't affect my rating), but I am VERY upset that Amazon Prime took this season along with season two off their prime list. I understand they have the right to do so, but it really was messed up. If they want to make someone pay for the season, they should have just made it so from the beginning after each season was released, rather than taking it from us prime members. It's still available on Netflix, but I prefer to do business with Prime because of all the benefits and do not have an account with Netflix. I definitely think they should bring this season and season two.",1395446400,5,1046,4.476439790575916

It was included in our Prime membership until it became popular and Amazon decided they had the goose that laid the golden egg and now charge for watching.  If they had decided to start charging for the new season (once it becomes available) that would be one thing but to take away something that was included in your membership is underhanded.  So you can pay for Prime but you're also going to pay for Sherlock. it's a great series but I won't pay $20 for a 4-year old show (you get three episodes for that price!).",1395446400,2,627,4.571428571428571

This modern day portrayal of the beloved Sir Arthur Conan Doyle character easily rivals the American version ""Elementary"" and even surpasses it in many respects.

I mean, all that stuff he deduced about Dr. Watson and everything and everyone in the show but couldn't figure out the extremely obvious link to the killer.

4191836,5,B003TO541O,This series is multifaceted with intelligent dialogue and challenging plots.  It also is infused with subtle humor and brilliantly understated acting by all the major characters.  The portrayal of Holmes as an autistic savant who is challenged and centralized by the normalizing friendship of Watson creating a sympathetic character of someone who could have been decidedly unlikable is a masterpiece of character development.  In short I am delighted by the series.,1395014400,,466,5.535211267605634

It didn't take long for us find the characters likable, the music fun and the story telling excellent.  Well done, it's just too bad there's only 3 episodes per season.  Of course each one is almost the length of a feature film.  Already moved on to season 2 and 3 but trying to watch one episode a week so we don't run out to quickly.

Sherlock is a wonderfully conceived update to the traditional stories. I especially like the racy Irene Adler.

Good way to do this!

They kept my attention.  Good, likeable (or not) characters.  Almost did Season 3 at same time, but ran out of time.  If you like Sherlock and mysteries with twists, you will really like this.",1394928000,,284,4.203703703703703

With a sort of disappointment with Sherlock series 3, I keep going back to series 1 and 2, which include the best of the best episodes:
Series 1:
* A Study in Prink (a fantastic and signature introduction of young Sherlock and Dr. Watson)
* The Great Game (a great display of Sherlock's wit and deductions in solving a pack of mysteries forced onto him)
Series 2:
* A Scandal in Belgravia (the woman, who's equally clever in the game)
* The Reichenbach Fall (the fall, and the tense buildup leading to it)

If you don't want to be disappointed, then get only Sherlock series 1 and 2 DVDs, and forget about series 3 ever existed.",1394928000,,850,4.697986577181208

The modern setting is a master-stroke, allowing the plot to concentrate on character development and Holmes' struggle with his adversaries. Sherlock Holmes has met James Bond and the results of the merger are not bad. Once more the BBC has hit the cricket ball out of the park. Why can't Hollywood produce this sort of quality program?",1394841600,,432,5.013888888888889

It is so cleverly written - suspenseful, funny and witty with lots of unexpected twists and turns. The acting is wonderful - I am now fans of Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch. There is one thing I dislike about it - there aren't very many episodes in a season and they are 2 years between seasons...I hear maybe even 3 years for Season 4.

The relationship between Holmes and Watson develops pretty well in just three episodes. After the first episode you wonder if it will always be so contentious and one sided, but by the end of the third episode, while still contentious, Watson's strengths have been displayed. It is well acted, extremely well staged from a cenmatographer point of view. don't expect it to get very deep, it is escapist entertainment for sure.",1394668800,,516,4.942528735632184

There are plenty of hat tips to the original but enough has been reimagined and updated to provide a fresh take. The casting is spot on, the writing is good, and the relationship between Sherlock and Watson develops organically and believably.

The attempts haven't been successful, until now.

4191934,5,B003TO541O,"Plots are kind of wild, but not totally crazy. Acting, especially by actors playing Sherlock and Watson, is superb. Interesting to see how Sherlock becomes more humane (especially in social skills) and Watson becomes more self confident as the series develops. I also like (a) the placing of the series in the modern day which allows Sherlock to have almost instantaneous access to all the obscure facts needed for his work and (b) the visual showing of his deductions on the screen as he views a person or crime scene. Finally, Sherlock.s actor does very well in making an initially very cold, deductive genius with no social skills into a gradually evolving human being while realizing other persons also have strengths as well as weaknesses. Only drawback for me is that sometimes it was hard for me to understand all that was said because of thick British accents and Sherlock's very fast speech at times (one reason I liked visual explanations of his deductions.",1394323200,,967,4.902439024390244

4191952,5,B003TO541O,"I've loved the various BBC Sherlock iterations over the years.  Jeremy Brett was the quintessential Sherlock, in my opinion.  That is until Benjamin Cumberbatch was cast as Sherlock.  This version is set in modern London with all its electronic interfaces .  Its a fascinating and very fast moving depiction.  We actually ""see""  Sherlock taking in a scene, or person, pulling apart every aspect of the experience and storing it for later reference in his ""mind palaces"". Watching this process makes computers look slow and mundane in comparison.  Dr. Watson is just back from the war in Iraq and is in therapy for PTSD when he meets Sherlock.  The bond that forms between these two men is played out very convincingly and you are left feeling happy these two very different, complex and, at least for Sherlock, flawed men have found each other.  Bring on the adventures!",1394150400,,870,4.904109589041096

4191973,5,B003TO541O,"I cannot say enough about the first series (and successive series') of Sherlock. Benedict Cumberbatch is a phenomenal, modern-day Sherlock and Martin Freeman is the perfect Watson to Cumberbatch's portrayal.

Each episode launches a new, fantastical investigation, and each mystery is brilliant. It's the kind of show that you have to pay attention so as not to miss clues, but every scene draws you in and you don't want to miss a second. While there are only three episodes per season, they are feature-film length, at 90 minutes a piece.

If that's not enough, the orchestral music is incredible. I could not ask for anything else in a series! I love it; it is, simply put, my very favorite show. Give it a chance, you won't be disappointed!",1393977600,,744,4.8046875

4191982,5,B003TO541O,"Let's start by acknowledging that I deeply love the characters and stories of  Sherlock Holmes. I've read and reread the complete works. I downloaded them on my Kindle recently. And read them again.
I've seen every version of the tales that exist. My favorite period-faithful Holmes was played by Basil Rathbone but his Watson was dumbed down too far. If you want to know how Holmes truly felt about Watson, ask him. He said it best.
I enjoyed the old time dirt and modern day action of Robert Downey, Jr. and who doesn't love Jude Law but, once again, Watson bumbled along behind.
Finally, in Sherlock, we see the development of the true symbiotic friendship between Holmes and Watson. Without Watson Holmes would never have had the success and notoriety he enjoyed. He would have burned out or over dosed or...
Holmes truly needed and appreciated Watson's courage, practicality and willingness to jump into the path of danger just for the hell of it. While Holmes identified the criminal from cigar ash and the condition of his sleeves, Watson remembered that he needed to eat lunch. Watson carried the gun, and ably used it. Holmes knew he would.
Sherlocknimbly and cleverly plays about with the details of the setting and cases (blog instead of magazine, Afghanistan in both cases, Nicotine versus cocaine) but remains very true to the intention of the tales, the rising and falling action and the balanced, durable partnership of two men who's abilities, while incredibly different, complimented each other's perfectly.
And, frankly, this is the best Mrs. Hudson ever.
I have pages more I could write about the particularities of the cases presented so far...but that's for another day.

I've seen many versions of this character and Doyle's stories over the years and some I enjoyed better than others. I am delighted by this updated characterization! The viewer has the option to either engage in the solving of the mystery or sit back and enjoy the dialogue and action, and either approach is an enjoyable one.

Another reminder of the superiority of UK over North American television, Sherlock rewards close attention and outclasses unwatchable U.S. police procedurals in every way. All elements of the program are top-notch: the excellence of the literate, nuanced writing is matched by the acting, editing, and production and design (which innovatively uses overlay graphics to suggest the rapid-fire workings of Sherlock's brain). Both Holmes brothers, in particular, are brilliantly realized characters. The 90-minute format allows for a longer, richer story arc than conventional procedural dramas.

One of my top 5 tv shows of all time!",1393718400,,359,5.137931034482759

4192020,5,B003TO541O,I avoided watching the series for a couple of years. One day I felt like watching a mystery but I was too familiar with my usual British mysteries so I decided to try Sherlock. I' very glad I did. It now one of the mysteries I watch.,1393632000,,233,3.978723404255319

4192029,5,B003TO541O,It's mysterious yet whitty in humor. The actors are very good in character. I'm smitten by the English dialect and location. Even the music is theme is perfect. Excellent show.,1393632000,,176,4.9

4192031,5,B003TO541O,This is a fast moving drama where it is easy to miss something if you so much as blink. I would recommend this for high school and above.,1393632000,,137,3.9285714285714284
4192032,5,B003TO541O,"I'm not a big fan of TV, but this series is funny, smart and incontrovertibly entertaining. My only wish is there were more episodes.",1393545600,,133,4.583333333333333
4192033,5,B003TO541O,"I thought that this was a great interpretation of the classic series by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It takes the modern twist on things, adding even more to the effect. I love the people who bring these characters to life. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Sherlock accurately as an obsessive, egotistical anti-hero type. I very much enjoy this series so far.",1393545600,,348,4.915254237288136
4192034,5,B003TO541O,"This is a great series; the writers have kept true to Conan Doyle's work and have brought Sherlock into the modern day world. The acting is excellent and the cinemaphotography is wonderful.  If you like mysteries and suspense along with an excellent production, this series is for you.",1393545600,,285,4.9375
4192035,5,B003TO541O,"Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman shine in ""Sherlock,"" a modern version of Sherlock Holmes, complete with text messages, computers, cell phones, and people assuming that Holmes and Watson are gay.  It's witty, the mysteries are excellent, titled somewhat differently than the original stories.  ""A Study in Pink,"" ""The Sign of Three"" (in the last series) are just examples.  Also Moriarity here is Jim Moriarity, beautifully portrayed by Andrew Scott.

This is the Sherlock for today, and it made Benedict Cumberbatch an international celebrity.  Holmes is a classic character and can be depicted in a variety of ways and in a variety of times.  This is one manifestation, and it's wonderful.",1393545600,,698,5.3
4192036,4,B003TO541O,"I really enjoy the chemestry between Benedick and Martin.  They are truly fun to watch and the twists in the plots, genius.

I recomend watching!",1393545600,,145,4.76

We intend to watch all that is available!!!!

Thanks",1393545600,,240,3.8979591836734695
4192038,2,B003TO541O,The sound is way out of balance. Turn down the musical interludes and turn up the dialog.  Love everything about this series except the poor sound production.,1393545600,2,158,4.851851851851852

4192040,5,B003TO541O,"A welcome surprise, done with appropriate British attention to details...some too fleeting for most to notice!

Benedict Cumberbatch brings a fresh measure of (but measured) ""over the top"" eccentricity, while Martin Freeman provides the necessary dose of Hobbitian tentativeness and common sense. What fun!",1393545600,,306,5.954545454545454

4192043,5,B003TO541O,Excellent in depth modern version of the classic detective. I only wish they did more than 3 episodes per season.,1393545600,,113,4.7
4192044,5,B003TO541O,"These are adaptations of the  Sherlock Holmes mysteries; however, you do not have to have read any of the Sherlock Holmes mysteries to enjoy these stories. They are set in current time with Modern forensics and technology. This series could not have been  set without extensive use of iPhones, The cinematography was fantastic, The best I've seen in a very long time. So far there are three episodes each season and season three is currently finished. Seasons one and two are currently available to watch on Amazon instant videos with a prime membership at this time. I hope Season three will soon be available to watch very soon. Season three starts back with Sherlock's return after supposedly being dead for a couple of years",1393545600,,728,4.862903225806452

4192050,5,B003TO541O,"But, I'd give them one star if someone asked how I liked a ""season"" consisting of only 3 episodes.  I just get into the cross episode arc and then the season is done with no prediction of when the next ""season"" will air.  But, it's from the same group that does Dr. Who so I guess we should come to expect it.  I want more!",1393545600,,323,3.9384615384615387
4192051,5,B003TO541O,"A friend told me about this show and when I saw it on Amazon Prime video, I decided to watch it.  I am so glad that I did! The episodes kept me guessing all the way through until the end of each one.  Being a fan of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes books, I was also happy to see that the writers weaved portions of the book's story lines in with the show but in a modern day way.  It is an excellent show that I would recommend to anyone who likes Sherlock Holmes or detective stories.",1393545600,,490,4.030927835051546
4192052,4,B003TO541O,"At first, I thought this is not Arthur Conan Doyle's famous sleuth, what's the point of watching it?  But I got hooked and now am going back and watching all the past seasons.  Because it answers the questions that no one asked, such as ""What would Sherlock have done differently if he had a cell phone and internet?""

The names are the same and the characters are somewhat reminiscent of their originals, but it really helps to see this as a new mystery show, with admirable characters, great actors, and cleverly designed plots.  So I gave it 4 stars because they called it ""Sherlock"", and I think forgetting that makes watching it more enjoyable.",1393545600,,649,4.666666666666667

4192056,5,B003TO541O,"My husband claims he talked me into watching this when it first aired on PBS, I watched 5 minutes & left the room, saying I didn't care for it. I think he dreamt that up, because I love this show. Some people don't like the modern aspect of the series, but there have been so very many stage & screen shows set in the Victorian era that it really becomes tedious after a while. Basil Rathbone & Jeremy Brett come to mind as having portrayed a great Victorian Holmes, then there are the recent Robert Downey Jr films, so this is actually a refreshing change. I'm amazed they can follow the basic stories so closely & take place today.",1393545600,,633,4.3277310924369745

4192059,5,B003TO541O,"This is a modern take on Sherlock Holmes and I think the casting and the setting are wonderful! The shows themselves move along well and I think the two main characters play well against each other.
The shows move along so pay attention to what is being said. The stories may be a little predictable but that is half the fun of watching the stories move along!

It's very well written. I love Cumberbatch's smirky face and his portrayal of Sherlock. Each episode gets better and better. I hope for a long run of this show as it is one of the best out of the UK (along with Doctor Who).",1393459200,,486,4.11578947368421

4192065,5,B003TO541O,"I missed the first season of ""Sherlock,"" but the Pittsburgh PBS outlet rebroadcast season two prior to broadcasting season three, and I got addicted to the unique perspectives of this self-admitted ""highly functioning sociopath,"" a heroic figure with whom I can identify and empathize.  The unity of plot construction comes off as nearly Shakespearean in level.  The story lines at times can and do frustrate the viewer who frequently asks, ""Where in the bloody blue blazes is this going?""  But by the conclusion, every loose end is tied up -- EXCEPT for the ""cliffhangers"" at the conclusions of each season which remind one of the original Ian Fleming ""James Bond"" thrillers.  The major addicting quality of the series involves the authentic and vibrant ""local color"" of the modern (and postmodern) city of London, not that I approve of postmodernity, but I can admire the quality of the presentation of any literary art work.  It's the kind of work that one can watch again and again.",1393459200,,986,4.951515151515151

Once in a while situations between main two characters a bit too silly and much too drawn out which demeans/ weakens the complicated depth of the relationship that the writers seem to be trying to get the audience to understand and embrace.  Also I am starting to become annoyed with the increased speed of speech of Sherlock while one is trying to read all the written info.  Starting to feel like an over abundance of "" slickness "" on the part of a bunch of maybe competitive writers who are trying to out ""clever"" one another.  My advice ( like who cares? ) stay with the more sophisticated slick intelligent techy approach and continue with the in depth humanization of all the eccentrics in the series.

4192083,5,B003TO541O,"It's as good as you've heard. The second episode of the three is the weakest, but the first when they meet is excellent. And just wait until you get to the third season! Maybe even better than Basil Rathbone, and I love me the Basil Rathbone.",1393372800,,242,4.282608695652174

4192113,5,B003TO541O,"This is not like an American tv show. It's like a movie! It's well written, the director makes pretty pictures, and Benedict Cumberbatch is perfect for this role! For those who don't like story lines to go on and on this show is perfect! Most episodes the mystery is solved within the episode but the story line of their personal lives is continuous, like ""Law and Order""",1393200000,,371,4.552238805970149

4192117,5,B003TO541O,"Sherlock Holmes has been the favorite of readers for years.  He has been portrayed by a host of marvelous actors, including Basil Rathbone, Roger Moore, Robert Downey, Jr. and Benedict Cumberbatch.  Each has brought a different flair to their portrayal and each presents us with a different Sherlock Holmes.  Benedict Cumberbatch gives us an intelligent, arrogant Holmes, impatient with everyone but intensely committed to finding the killer.  His methods are not always conventional, but the results marvelous.  Martin Freeman is perfect as Watson.  It is a pity there aren't more episodes of this per season.",1393200000,,610,5.368421052631579

4192119,5,B003TO541O,"Benedict Cumberbatch is a good pick for Sherlock and Martin Freeman good for Dr. Watson.  Benedict's voice does not match his young face, but he fits the bill.  There's humor, thought provoking dialog and lot's of action.  The only thing I wonder is why there are only 3 episodes per season.  Wish there were more and looking forward to many more season.",1393113600,,354,4.661290322580645
4192120,5,B003TO541O,"This is by far, one of the best television series I have ever watched. The actors are all terrific, and the filming is done in a very original way. Having only been exposed to the American TV series, ""Elementary"", it was really fun to see the British take on a 21st Century Sherlock Holmes. The character development, the story plots, the high tech forensic techniques, the almost noir style of the film, the wry humor of the British writers, the theme song and background music is haunting, and of course, Benedict Cumberbatch (Fifth Estate, Star Trek)and Martin Freeman (The Hobbit), all blend to make an excellent series. The added re-cap by the writers and actors that explains how they arrived at the  plot lines, the character development and the inclusion of secondary characters, is most interesting too and even multiplies your enjoyment of the stories. I would suggest that everyone who likes really good drama and original screen plays, will love this program as I did.",1393113600,,980,4.903614457831325
4192121,5,B003TO541O,"One of the most boring things for me in movies and television is writers and producers being lazy when they make a genius. What I mean by this is showing the protagonist genius ""hacking"" an unbreakable website, and then some pentagon official exclaiming ""that's impossible!"" or something stupid like that. That`s not the case in this Series. The Sherlock Character draws conclusions that someone else who is very smart could also come to with the same amount of given information that the viewer is provided with. This is a really well put together show, and the plot line has action, humor, and plot twists that come off great. Highly recommended.",1393113600,,648,4.9
4192122,5,B003TO541O,"It's very smart and well done. From what I've seen of Doctor Who, I'm surpised the writer can make something this good. It's a brilliant translation in a modern setting.",1393113600,,169,4.666666666666667

4192141,5,B003TO541O,Thankfully not as quirky as Jeremy Brett. Very fast moving. Artfully transferred to modern day London. Dr. Watson is strengthened to a fantastic assistant and Sherlock has been a little more humanzied. I was half way through the first DVD and fired up the computer to order reamaining 2 seasons. I will definitely enjoy watching through a second time as I'm sure I've missed small details.,1393027200,,389,4.909090909090909

4192146,5,B003TO541O,"A great fan of Sherlock Holmes, I have read and watched most of the films, collections, series and articles about the characters.  I was coaxed into watching by a friend because of the modern setting of this particular version, but since the very first moments of the first episode have been baking cookies for that friend as thanks for each new season.  Cumberbatch is so percise, prissy, particular, snooty and OCD that he hits the nail into the heart of Sherlock's character and personality.  Watson is perfectly unasumming and human and a splendid contrast to Sherlock.  The modern twist is exquisite - the details are painted into the picutre in a clever way, the updates are so much fun to pick up on.  The stories are a rollercoaster ride that is both fun and exciting.",1393027200,,776,4.718518518518518

4192148,5,B003TO541O,"I'm a long time Sherlock Holmes fan and this series continues (and in my opinion improves on) the past pairings of Holmes and Watson actors. Benedict Cumberbatch adds an ethereal, almost eerie, dimension to Sherlock and Martin Freeman is outstanding as the loyal, if often exasperated and unbelieving, Dr. John Watson. I particularly appreciate the attention given to Watson's backstory as the physically and emotionally wounded former Army physician - more true to Conan Doyle's original than most of the previous depictions. Other characterizations stand out as well including fresh takes on Lestrade, Moriarity, and Sherlock's brother Mycroft. This is a really well done series, and both Cumberbatch and Freeman are actors to watch as their careers continue to rise.",1393027200,,769,5.416666666666667
4192149,5,B003TO541O,"It wasn't necessary to modernize Conan-Doyle's nineteenth century detective; indeed, a costume series with a strict devotion to the history surrounding the original stories has yet to be made and I am convinced is a ripe field awaiting some brilliant filmmaker's attention. Still, this modern update of the series attains brilliance in so many ways, not the least of which is Cumberbatch, Freeman and the rest of the cast. Even incidental characters are interesting and well-played. The adaptation of the source material avoids a wooden literalism but the plots are still recognizable enough to please the avid fan of the original stories. Another excellent series from the BBC and PBS.",1392940800,,686,5.245454545454545

The characters are played well, and I think that Benedict Cumberbatch does a great job playing a character who is irritating, arrogant, yet still  he is rooted for throughout the episodes.",1392940800,,487,4.47191011235955

4192166,4,B003TO541O,"Well written and superbly acted, I have watched the first two seasons online several times.  It is done in such a way that Sherlock's arrogance is both detestable and adorable, the whole time being funny on that smart@ level.
I am a fan of Robert Downey JR as Sherlock Holmes. This show to me is like a modern times version of those two movies.  It has enough action to keep the 10 year old in me happy, and enough intellect to stop it from becoming cliche after twenty minutes.
I couldn't watch them fast enough to see where the story went and am waiting impatiently for the third season to be done and posted for online streaming.",1392940800,,632,4.3931623931623935

4192175,4,B003TO541O,This was enjoyable watching.  It's a great update of the Sherlock Holmes saga. Benedict Cumberbatch is awesome as Sherlock and Watson is well-cast also. I enjoyed watching the season and will watch future ones.,1392854400,,210,5.176470588235294

4192180,5,B003TO541O,"Well about 2 or so years ago I noticed the internet in a buzz with love for Benedict Cumberbatch, and I was all WTF kinda name is that? I decided I would watch Sherlock eventually (since there are so many cable and/or British shows out there that look good you can't watch them all right away.) Winter TV hiatus time is a great time to get into something new, and this year it was Sherlock. Since there are only 3 episodes per Series and just 3 Series I had been putting off watching it in general, having heard already online about the 2 year wait between Series 2 and 3.

Anyway I loved it!  From everything Sherlock does to John's reactions to everything this show is good fun and a good laugh much of the time. It kind of goes between being dark and serious and having some comedy. Both Benedict and Martin Freeman are perfect in their portrayals of Sherlock and John Watson. And yes, I admit I'm lusting over Benedict pretty hard core :)

Anyway, I recommend people to give this a try! If you like Mystery shows and/or British shows definitely give it a try. I haven't read the Sherlock Holmes books yet, so I'm not quite sure of book accuracy. But as it is a modern adaption, I think it is more of a ""inspired by"" the books kind of thing. They do take stories from the books though for most(?) episodes and like translate to modern times. Some stories more directly than others.

I don't usually watch mystery shows. I like them well enough, but they rarely get me hooked. It is really the cast of this show that has me wanting more and more. The characters and their relationships.
Lastly, anybody should give this a go, even if mystery shows are not your thing! I watch a big variety of shows myself. Currently: Vikings, True Blood, Game of Thrones, How I Met Your Mother, Dracula, Once Upon a Time, Revenge, Doctor Who...

Sorry for the nerdy ramblings. In closing I want to point out that the dialogue can go pretty fast. That might be the only [negative?] downside to the show. Not for me, but I mean some people might find it fast. That and the combination of them speaking British. I speak American English and watch lots of BBC so I'm like 95% ok with understanding stuff.",1392854400,,2186,4.400990099009901
4192181,5,B003TO541O,Really excellent series. I only wish there were more episodes per season.  Would recommend highly!  Best rendition of Sherlock out there.,1392854400,,137,5.476190476190476

4192183,5,B003TO541O,"My fondness for these characters began with the printed works.  These were followed by the Rathbone films and found their most beloved realizations in the Granada productions starring Jeremy Brett.  Brett is, in my opinion, the finest of the classic Holmes interpretations.

I will also point out that with very rare exceptions I do not care for the trend to remake anything and everything that was ever remotely successful.  This series is one of the few exceptions to that statement.  This is truly a Holmes and Watson for the current age with plots that are well constructed and performances that are a delight to behold.  Different enough to not ruffle the purists feathers yet close enough in spirit to give us the cast of characters we know and love as one can easily imagine Conan Doyle writing them today.  Not a Holmes fan but like a nice taught story line and well crafted characters?  Then this may really be just the thing for you.  Now if only we could produce entertainment of this caliber in the U.S. reliably and consistently.  This is yet another bit of British craftsmanship that makes the fact that our world grows smaller with every passing year a bit more of a blessing than a curse.",1392854400,,1204,4.690476190476191
4192184,5,B003TO541O,"Smart, modern twist on Doyle's great work, as only Masterpiece can do. Dark, twisted Moriarty is seriously disturbed in a new millennium kind of way.

4192191,5,B003TO541O,I enjoyed season 1 so much I went right to season 2. Well acted.  Love Watson.  Sherlock is well-played.  I'll look for this series to continue.,1392854400,,144,4.461538461538462
4192192,5,B003TO541O,"This series is excellently cast, plotted, and directed. It may take a while for Holmes aficionados to get used to a Holmes with such character flaws. In our psychologized times we focus more on them than was previously the case. Cumberbatch pulls it off, though, and gives us an interesting character study of a brilliant and driven young man, a ""high functioning sociopath,"" in Holmes' own words. It is Watson's character that makes the stories interesting, though, since we -- and Holmes -- see in him the humanity Holmes lacks. The fact that Holmes comes to see this over time and comes to value Watson as a friend -- perhaps the only friend he will ever have-- is one of the interesting subtexts of the series.

Although consistently modern, the stories contain true-to-the-tradition references to the Holmes stories, so don't feel that modernity has watered down the Holmes tradition.

It's unfair to compare this to the Jeremy Brett versions, done as faithful presentations of Doyle's writings. Brett was (IMAO) a better actor than Cumberbatch, but the stories were faithful representations of Doyle's stories, not modern representations. This is a ""based-on"" approach, and it works quite well.

I'm enjoying the series more than anything else I've seen for a while. It's worth a look.",1392854400,,1291,5.051643192488263

4192203,5,B003TO541O,"This series is not for the casual TV watcher, you must give it your undivided attention, and probably watch each episode multiple times to catch the clues, nuances...  The acting, the writing, the stories are first rate, guaranteed to keep you guessing and off balance.  I also watch the American series Elementary which I enjoy, but it is not in the same league as this series.  I purchased all 3 seasons of Sherlock and cannot believe at how much I missed the first time  and how much I am enjoying watching each episode again.  Season 3 adds a new principle character and I was worried it would throw off the chemistry between the characters but I was wrong, the actor adds to the relationship between Sherlock and Watson and makes the series even stronger.  I don't want to give anything away, this is truly a remarkable series.",1392768000,,832,4.625850340136054

4192218,4,B003TO541O,"The show's writers think their plots are smarter than they really are. There are often glaring holes and oversights that they then try to leverage to prove Sherlock's brilliance; unfortunately, the viewer figured these things out a few minutes earlier. So the plots are the series' weakness.

On the other hand, Benedict Cumberpatch and Martin Freeman are both excellent. They make this series worth watching and a lot of fun. I think Cumberpatch does a great job of not falling into the weird detective trope that is so prevalent today. He plays Sherlock Holmes as a genius who doesn't care, instead of a sociopath who can't care.",1392768000,,631,4.897196261682243
4192219,4,B003TO541O,"The modern high-tech Sherlock Holmes is good, but the rapid speak, many asides and the Queen's English forces one to turn up the volume to understand.

4192227,5,B003TO541O,"Sherlock Holmes season 1 is like cheating on a strict diet - a delicious guilty pleasure. One has to appreciate the rapid quips and witty banter between Sherlock and his talented Watson. Fun and flirty, this is for someone who appreciates ""tongue and cheek"" humor and is not worried about everything being solved perfectly or in a purely believable way.

I think this show is ideal for anyone tired of the mundane and thoughtless content that has plagued television broadcast for quite some time. Please don't think you'll be able to watch a part of an episode--make sure you have enough time to start and finish each one before you begin--or you'll drive yourself nuts.

4192271,4,B003TO541O,"This version of Sherlock Holmes is set in present-day London and the exterior shots of London are great. They add a lot to the exciting flow of events. The two main characters, Sherlock and Dr. Watson, are very well played by two gifted actors. Sherlock isn't likable on most levels and he really suffers from the ability to empathize with other humans despite his amazing ability to see clues and evidence where others see nothing. This Dr. Watson is both intrepid and intelligent, and, of course, admiring of Holmes' talents. He suffers Holmes's brusqueness and rudeness more patiently than others might because he thoroughly enjoys being part of Holmes's cases.

The stories themselves are creative, full of twists and turns, sometimes excessively so. It's easy to get lost in an episode. Also, the Holmes character often mumbles, and sometimes speaks in a staccato, aggressive style and it can be hard for a non-Brit to understand what he's saying. Nevertheless, it's always easy enough to get the plot and understand exactly what happened.

The series makes good use of current technology. Both Holmes and Watson use mobile phones and computers constantly, and if something they see on the device in use is of importance to the viewer, the text appears on the screen in a creative way that adds to the show instead of distracting from it.

Almost everyone in Holmes's life either doesn't like him or actively hates him, but part of the conceit of this series is that Holmes has obviously settled on Watson as his only real friend, sometimes, amusingly, to Watson's astonishment. Poor old Mrs. Hudson is far more tolerant of Holmes and his sometimes violent lifestyle than any other saintly human might be. She is obviously fond of Holmes, and she thinks that he and Dr. Watson are, in fact, a gay couple, of which she totally approves. This provides for some mildly humorous scenes, but, thankfully, it's not at all overdone.

Holmes's relationship with the rather dimwitted Inspector Lestrade is tenuous at best. The police actively don't like Holmes because of his imperious and brusque manner, but Holmes always manages to do their jobs for them in the end, much to their ongoing consternation.

It's a creative, updated interpretation of the classic detective (thank you, Mr. Doyle, for your enduring gift of Sherlock Holmes). It's also a treat to watch on different levels (good to great acting, wonderful exterior scenes of current-day London, entertaining vignettes of how Holmes actually figures out various plot elements, etc.) It's certainly worth watching at least one episode to judge for yourself.",1392595200,,2615,5.043981481481482

good dialogue

fun twist on original stories

If you know the originals, it's a lot of fun to see how the show changes the details of each story. The fact that the show pretends that the historical Holmes & Watson as written by Doyle never existed is a key element in making this show work. While they are unencumbered by the original text, everyone involved is dedicated to maintaining a high quality product.

4192282,4,B003TO541O,"I find the show quite entertaining.  I think the actor speaks just a bit too fast when summarizing how he arrived at his conclusions.  I find myself putting on the subtitles, not because it is British English, as I watch many British shows and have been to England several times, but just so I don't miss any of his clues.  I think it would be too fast even if it were created in the US.  The best part of the show is to listen to his reasoning and deductions, and it often sounds garbled together.

4192284,5,B003TO541O,"Let me begin with a confession: I was not entirely ""okay"" with the idea of a modern version of one of the most beloved literary characters of all time...until I saw the first episode of Series 3 on whro several weeks ago.

Of course, like any rational Sherlockian I immediately purchased Series/Season 1 and waited anxiously for its arrival.

There have been by far too many plot summaries, and delightful as they are, they do get tedious and repetitive after a time so instead i'll do a 'Character Portrayal' thing. Starting with The Master

BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS SHERLOCK HOLMES: I was quite impressed. He is a brilliant actor; quite handsome in that interesting, original way thatI feelis nessecary to pull off Sherlock, and he doespull it off. Brilliantly! His Sherlock is wonderful, a self described ""High-Functioning Sociopath"" with a rapier-sharp mind and an even faster tongue; the man delivers the famous Sherlock monologues in a rapid, lyrical staccatoVERY fast! He also is quite in touch with the quirks and vices of Sherlock: randomly firing his pistol at the wall because he's bored, plucking despondently at the strings of his violin whenever the mood strikes him, abusing drugs, silently staring blankly into space while he thinks, dashing off in the middle of a sentence with no explanation, not eating for days on end, not sleepingall of Sherlock's classic habits. I highly commend both Benedict and the writers for bringing Sherlock Holmes to life again in the modern world. Bravo!

MARTIN FREEMAN AS DR. JOHN WATSON: An intriguing interpretation. Watson is a war veteran who misses the danger of combat and the thrill of the chase. He is the only man who could possibly be Sherlock's flatmatesimply because no one else could tolerate him. But Watson thrills in the excitement, even if Sherlock sometimes drives him to his breaking point. When they meet, Watson is recovering from an injurythere are a few fun nods to the original stories where Watson never can seem to decide where his wound actually was! and looking for a flatmate. Martin Freeman is an excellent Watson; his acting is top-notch and his portrayal wonderful. His Watson is both amazed by Sherlock's extraordinary mental powers and at the same time bewildered by Sherlock's lack of common knowledge and social skills. He can't help being frustrated with Sherlock at times, for all the obvious reasons, but Martin Freeman treads the fine line between nagging and extreme tolerance with grace. Wonderful.

MRS. HUDSON: Mrs. Hudson has perhaps undergone the greatest change from the original stories, usually a rarely seen character with seemingly no past, future, or family; this Mrs. Hudson is introduced as a woman whose past relationship with Sherlock is that of a former client. He ensured her husband was executed, and so owes him a favor. This Mrs. Hudson is rather spacy, is always popping in and out with a tea tray and despairing at the mess 'her boys' have made. She is less of a landlady and housekeeper and more of a mother-figure for Sherlock and Watson.

DETECTIVE INSPECTOR LESTRADE: Classic Lestrade. Basically competent; resents the fact that he needs Sherlock's help, while at the same time admiring himthough he'd die before admitting it. It's interesting to see the relationship between Sherlock and Lestrade; they bicker like two pageant girls most of the time, but it is evident there's something akin to grudging mutual respect between them.

MYCROFT HOLMES: Excellent job. Mycroft is the very mysterious elderand smarterbrother of Sherlock. He practically is the British government, and seems to have a hand in every secret agency you've ever heard of, and no doubt some you haven't. He's a delightfully odd, never-leaves-the-office-but-happy-to-do-the-brainwork type and the sibling rivalry between him and Sherlock is hysterical; they're always trying to outdo one another, while at the same time pretending the other doesn't exist. It's quite funny. The repeated jokes about Mycroft's weight are an amusing throwback to the original stories where Mycroft is quite rotund.

MORIARTY: He scares me. He really does. Others have said he yells and carries on too much...but I find him terrifying. It's bone-chilling, and his picture should be in the dictionary under: criminally insane, demented, manipulative, psychopath with serious problems that absolutely no psychiatrist in the world could solve. An absolutely wonderful portrayal of Moriarty for which the actor deserves great applause(though it won't be coming from me, because I'd be too scared to be in the same room with him, even though i'm sure he's a lovely person in real life).

All in all a wonderful show that masterfully transports the greatest detective of all time to our time. I am a fan.",1392508800,5,4766,5.115681233933162

4192295,5,B003TO541O,"Since finding Downtown Abby, I have been hooked on PBS Masterpiece and Sherlock doesn't disappoint.  The production quality, storylines and quality of acting is so far superior to anything U.S. produced.  Cumberbatch does a phenomenal job as Holmes, playing a sort of ""House-like"" genius without the vulgarity.  Martin's Watson is the perfect protege.  Both are multilayered, broken characters, but complete together. You know Watson both loves Sherlock and wants to deck him at the same time.  The plots are well thought out and in include twists you wouldn't expect, unlike U.S. crime dramas.  They  keep your attention and the underlying Moriarty thread keeps you coming back.  In addition, they do not need to pander to the profane and sexually explicit to try to draw or keep the audience.  Well done!",1392508800,,806,5.138461538461539

I've had to watch episodes twice in order to appreciate all the detail and nuance.  Also, I had to alter my viewing habits because even though this is a tv show, each episode is like a movie,  - not a tv show which has a break in action every 20 minutes for commercials.

Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are nothing short of brilliant in their roles, but every actor in this series (I love to hate Mycroft) does a superb job. Are actors just better in Britain?  And I haven't even mentioned the intelligent writing.  Normally, I'm someone who likes to stick with original writing, but I love how it was updated for the 21st century.  The BBC has done it once again with an intelligent, well acted and filmed series.  This isn't mindless fluff, like a lot of what is on TV.  You have to concentrate and THINK.

I was, in fact so engrossed with the show that I spent a small fortune to hdmi it from my Kindle to my 27 inch television screen.  I will invite any American Sherlock tv fan, who has not tried the BBC version, to try it, and they will be hooked as I am.  The fact that the British accents throw me off some, only makes me go back to hear every word.  It goes without saying, that I use earphones to enhance the sound, and to help me with the difference in pronunciations.

When I first watched this series, I started with the middle episode of Series 2, Hound of the Baskervilles, and utterly hated it because although the two leads were fine, the story didn't track the original and seemed to glitz everything up with technology.

4192339,5,B003TO541O,"Sherlock Holmes returns in this modern take on the character. First off, the acting is superb and by all the actors. No doubt taking on a classic role invites all kinds of comparisons to past efforts. This group does a fantastic job of presenting the characters in a fresh way, especially Doctor Watson, who is an army veteran. The scripts are intriguing as well, another difficult task in this modern world where it's all been done before. Then there is the production value, which is top notch. Put it all together and you have a modern classic in the making. Fans of the old-time will enjoy the mood and newcomers will be thrilled by the twists and turns. I've watch the first episode of Season One twice, looking for small clues and other things I've missed. I look forward to another season as soon as I get through my watch list.

Benedict Cumberbatch seems to thrive in this role as Sherlock and embraces the wit, and quirkiness that goes with it. The stories are the same but cleverly updated to our times and in my opinion, well done. My daughter watched the first few shows and soon the whole family was hooked!

4192348,4,B003TO541O,"I'm old school when it comes to the 2nd greatest detective ever.  So having Holmes' and Watson's adventures set during present day sort of blew my mind when it comes to Sherlock.  Turns out, this is a very well-made show and most of the stories are familiar and based on the original Doyle character.  But the new series offers some really intensified twists and turns and the Holmes character, played by Mr. Cumberbatch is a lot of fun to watch.  I sometimes have to rewind the DVR in order to catch all he says, since there are times where he is able to describe all his deductions.  But those deductions come at such a verbally fast flurry, it is sometimes difficult to follow exactly what he is saying.  But very interesting and amazing, nonetheless.  I've completed the very short Season one and am on to Season two.  The other thing I enjoy about this series is the British humor, especially as it relates to Holmes & Watson.  The episodes are filled with mystery, intrigue and mild humor.  Enjoying every scene.",1392336000,,1018,4.605555555555555
4192349,4,B003TO541O,"It has humor, suspense, and intrigue.  The villain's have been good and creepy as well.  It is pure entertainment.  The duo works very well together.  I like Watson as much a Sherlock.",1392336000,,184,4.65625
4192350,5,B003TO541O,"Story, actors, production values. I read and reread the Conan Doyle stories many times and this update series captures the spirit of the original effectively.",1392336000,,158,5.36
4192351,5,B003TO541O,"In todays world of cell phones, the Internet, text messaging, CSI, etc; it would seem out of place for a detective from the Victorian era to exist in it. Nevertheless, the makers of this series take this concept and make it work brilliantly. ""Sherlock"" manages to be fine escapism that successfully puts the old into the new. If Arthur Conan Doyle stories were written today, this is how they would appear.

Benedict Cumberbatch is a delight as Sherlock Holmes. His Holmes is a self-described high-functioning sociopath. A man that manages to be both hyper-attentive and insensitive at the same. As unlovable as he is (at certain moments he is not even sympathetic) you cant help but sit back and enjoy watching him.  He is a blissfully rude, wonderfully grouchy addict that lives for mental stimulation. Like the late, great Jeremy Brett this was a role he was born to play. His interpretation of the character might not be definitive per se but he certainly makes for a definitive contemporary Holmes. The best for our generation in the 21st century.

Martin Freeman is superb and believable as John Watson. An army doctor haunted by his time in Afghanistan. His Watson is an everyman we can all relate to. He often banters with Holmes as he has to put up with his self-centered and condescending behavior. Yet he is the most reliable person that Holmes knows. He can act as the moral guide to a man that does not always consider the rights and wrongs of what he does. Watson is the heart to a man that is all brain.

The rest of the cast ensemble is wonderful. You also see the usual supporting characters from Holmes canon like his motherly landlady Mrs. Hudson (Una Stubbs), His brother Mycroft (Mark Gatiss), who works for the British government. Also, you have Inspector Lestrade, played by Rupert Graves, who is a competent policeman instead of an ignorant one as he is often portrayed in other Holmes TV shows and movies.

The writing is slick with plenty of humor and clever twists. As seen in these following mysteries:

A Study in Pink  Influenced loosely by A Study in Scarlet, This a solid, polished introduction to the series and its characters. In order for the show to have been a hit, the first episode needed to be a winner (although Ive never watched the unaired pilot). I appreciated this one a lot more on second viewing. It has plenty of humor along with a tightly written script.

The Blind Banker  This is the only episode I don't care much for. It is not horrible but its just rather meh. It borrows from The Dancing Men as it is a mystery involving a baffling cipher. The script starts out intriguing but it eventually bogs itself down into clich&eacute;s with a climax that could have from a typical Hollywood movie. Not too mention that it contained lots of Asian stereotypes. Still, it is worth watching for its visual direction and the amusing Sherlock and John scenes.

The Great GameA very good episode. It is like a series of cliffhanger serials rolled into one (add the fact that it ends on a cliffhanger). The plot is compelling from start to finish. Like most episodes, it moves at a lighting pace that also helps capture the fast-paced world of London. It adds in a Bruce Parkington Plans mystery into the script and marks the first official appearance of Moriarty.

""Sherlock"" is great fun whether you're a die-hard Holmes fan or a fan of mainstream mysteries. In a time in which TV shows aren't what they used to be, this is one of the few series that you can get excited about.",1392336000,,3518,4.648953301127214

4192355,5,B003TO541O,"This new rendition of Sherlock Holmes is nothing except masterful. The acting is superb and the writing ingenious. The new writers have mashed together a few of the standard Holmes stories into one wild ride.  Sometimes I can't understand the actors when they speak, possibly due to the idioms differences between American English and British English.  I love the dynamic between Sherlock and John, even though John is smarter than previous depictions of Dr. Watson, but Sherlock is more of a pompous ass in this series.

Please note that I was asked to review this series in 2014, when I had already watched Season 3.  Now I know where it was going in Season 1, and it is a runaway train of a hit.  I love it.

There is just enough wit, snark and humor to keep my attention. The way it is filmed is also very artful in my opinion.

All the actors are superb but Benedict Cumberbatch is phenomenal!!! Martin Freeman is fantastic!!!  I cannot express how much I love this show!  It is clever, well acted and a pure joy!",1392249600,,398,4.184210526315789
4192378,4,B003TO541O,One of the better Sherlock versions I have seen. It really gets you involved in trying to see what Sherlock sees and why. There are times when the pace is faster than you can keep up with and the fact that things can go in many directions all at once.,1392249600,,251,4.04
4192379,5,B003TO541O,Surprised at the writer bringing Sherlock into modern world and making it relevant! Exceptional acting and cinematography. Highly recommend to mystery lovers!,1392249600,,158,6.2272727272727275

4192382,5,B003TO541O,"The only reason I gave Sherlock Season 1 a rating of FIVE Stars is that there is not an option for a million stars. I was first struck by the fact that theis show wove the original stories so seamlessly into the script. The way in which Sherlock and John meet, etcetera. I can think of no finer actors to play the respective roles of Sherlock and John, and Lestrade as well. There is action, humor, and that unique cerebral quality that any good mystery will bring to the table. Sherlock is NOT a show that allows one to become vegetative! This show appeals to the logical mind, yet, because of John, and the dynamic between the two characters, there is a most excellent emnotional dimension to this show that is undeniably appealing.

Yeah, I give this show a million stars!",1392249600,,775,4.49645390070922
4192383,3,B003TO541O,"I chose this rating , not because of the show; which I like, but because of the slowness of the website. It also kept dropping it and I would have to wait & wait. Lost out on dialog because of it.",1392249600,,196,3.8048780487804876
4192384,4,B003TO541O,"The two main characters, Sherlock and Watson are quirky and while not lovable, are certainly likable.  The problem for me was in the attention required in picking up pertinent details.  It is not in-your-face drama, but subtle clues presented at lighting speed!  Would not suggest it for bedtime viewing, takes a more alert mind to gather it all in.  Perhaps my choice of cuddling up w/my laptop under a cozy comforter is not ideal for Sherlock who like his orders to Watson wants us to keep moving and increase our pace!",1392249600,,521,4.6923076923076925

Benedict is SPECTACULAR; he should win every away ever in history for his portrayal; as an actor myself, he blows me away with this choices, his subtleness yet strong transitions, thoughts...he is so on point every single time.  Martin Freeman leaves me breathless as his incredible performance; he bring such a beautiful realness to Dr. Watson.

4192462,5,B003TO541O,"This version of Sherlock Holmes is both smart and at times funny.  The interplay between Holmes and Watson is intelligent, quick and full of surprises.  And, the fact that the show is modern, with its mix of graphics, technology and the use of London as a primary part of the show only makes the show even more fantastic.

Finally a relative made me sit and watch it and I was hooked after the first episode. It took a little getting used to. The style reminds me of the Robert Downey films, but set in modern times. It has it's own flavor too. It took me a while t to realize the star was Khan from Star Trek. I was really impressed with his acting. John Watson walks like a Hobbit but I still like him. :)",1391990400,,478,4.042105263157895

At first, I wasn't sure how I felt about it, as for me, it can get confusing if you don't watch closely and catch all of the details.  I am usually in the habit of knitting when I watch TV and makes for not paying 100% attention to what I am watching.  I was also having a little trouble with the dialect.

After the third season ended, I decided to go back to the beginning of the series and ""get to know"" the characters better.  I am finding that I really like this program and feel that it is very well done.  Clever, witty and sometimes funny.

Some special effects and graphics show the thoughts of that mind as it is in the process of practicing ""the science of deduction"" so you need to watch closely.  Martin Freeman is also brilliant as Dr. Watson.  Imagine Conan Doyle was a present-day blogger and you have John Watson...the one person (so far) Holmes cares about more than himself.  The plots are well written and each 1.5 hr episode is like a mini-movie.  And there's not much better than than a good drama that includes some laughs along the way.

For example, for all of Sherlock's genius and acuity, he seems to forget in every episode that the police can track the GPS location of any cell phone. Some of the deductions are somewhat of a stretch as well. Watson is an all but useless character. Fiddlesticks Crumpetbuns is fantastic for the role, however.

Aside from a bit of typecasting, the talents of both actors comes through. The characters are well developed, credible and very engaging.
I like the format in which the show is presented (in longer episodes), giving time for a well developed plot.
I enjoy the portrayal of Mycroft and the character having a more prominent role in this series than it did in the books.

I'm glad I did.  I found all three seasons to be very entertaining and well-paced.  The acting is very good, especially the character of Dr. Watson.  The episodes are not merely retellings of the original stories.  The writer takes liberties with those stories and does a fine job with his rewrites.

The stumbling, bumbling portrayal by Nigel Bruce is insulting at best.  Jeremy Brett is by far the truest to the original Holmes and Edward Hardwicke the best of the Watsons.

4192529,5,B003TO541O,"Are you seeing Benedict Cumberbatch everywhere? This is the show that started the frenzy. He's brilliant, and so is Morgan Freeman. In fact, so is everything about this BBC hit.

I ordered this show on a lark, never having seen an episode, because I like BBC programming and this was deeply discounted on the day. Well, I was hooked instantly. This is a modern-day Sherlock that stays faithful to Sir Conan Doyle (and Bruce & Rathbone), but brings him into a modern world of forensics and texting and GPS - and does it pretty seamlessly.

Created and written by current Doctor Who showrunner Stephen Moffatt and awesome DW writer Mark Gatiss (who also co-stars in a wonderful turn as Mycroft - you know , SH's smarter brother?), this is smart, funny, intriguing entertainment that you can't stop watching. (In fact, Whovian though I be, I actually like Moffat's Sherlock much better than his Doctor. The material lends itself perfectly to the intricate plot twists and surprising turns at which he truly excels. And who can bring the human element home like Gatiss? Looove him.).

The 90-minute episodes mean there's time to develop the stories, which all tie, at least nominally, to classic Holmes tales. You may think that only three shows per season is skimpy... not to worry. You will indeed want more when it's over, but everthing there is so rich and so well done, you'll have no doubt you've gotten your money's worth when the disk is done. Nice extras, too.

4192544,3,B003TO541O,Elementary is far better. The first season was excellent with a clear and clever adversary which made the plot line for the entire season clear and compelling. Jonny Lee Miller outshines Benedict Cumberbatch and having Watson and Moriarty as female characters was brilliant. I found Sherlock to be a bit hard to follow.,1391817600,,319,5.037735849056604

8405308,5,B003TO541O,This is a witty and clever update. But one of the aspects I most like is that you can enjoy the Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett and Benedict Cumberbatch versions because each actor brings an interpretation that expands and deepens the character of Holmes.,1522972800,2,255,4.818181818181818
