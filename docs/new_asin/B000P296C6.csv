2808845,5,B000P296C6,"If you're a fan of British comedy, I would highly recommend this dvd.  For fans of The Office and the first series of Extras, this is a must-have item.  The second season of this show is similar to the second season of The Office.  The stakes are raised, characters are placed in a variety of new situations and, of course, more uproarious hilarity ensues.  This season heightens the best elements of the first series and expands upon them immensely.

Mr. Merchant and Mr. Gervais are comedic geniuses and have created some of the best television in years.  Featuring special guest appearances by Orlando Bloom, David Bowie, Daniel Radcliffe, Chris Martin and Ian McKellan.  This show delivers some of the funniest moments comparable to the best of The Office.  You'll be having a laugh with one of the best television programs of the year!",1182124800,3,840,4.825174825174825

2808847,5,B000P296C6,"As the second season of Extras opens, it appears as if things may be looking up for struggling actor Andy Millman (Ricky Gervais).  His sitcom, ""When the Whistle Blows"", is picked up by BBC with himself in a lead role.  Problem is, BBC makes him water the show down so much that despite it's high ratings, it gets slaughtered in the review columns.  The season mainly focuses on Andy's troubles with the show becoming a hit (including a hilarious satire on the paparazzi), while Maggie (Ashley Jensen) goes about her same routine of looking her love, and Andy's agent (Stephen Merchant) proves to be inept as ever, leading up to a decision from Andy in regards to their professional relationship.  Like the first season, the second season of Extras has it's fair share of A-list guest stars that all leave their mark.  Robert DeNiro, Orlando Bloom, Ian McKellan, Coldplay's Chris Martin, Stephen Fry, and Warwick ""Leprechaun"" Davis all make the most of their time, but it's David Bowie and Harry Potter himself Daniel Radcliffe that will leave you in absolute hysterical joy.  All in all, the second (and possibly final) season of Extras is another excellent comedic blast to come from Ricky Gervais, and if you've never seen this show, you have been sadly missing out.",1177286400,18,1269,4.851851851851852
2808848,5,B000P296C6,"Ricky Gervais actually managed to top himself with season one of ""Extras,"" all about a struggling actor trying to catch a break.

Well, in the second season of ""Extras,"" his character has finally gotten one. But obviously it's not smooth sailing for the stressed-out extras, who continue to stumble through odd jobs and exaggerated celebrities. It's full of hilarious spoofery of the entertainment biz, and is pretty much hysterical from start to finish.

In the opening episode, Andy (Gervais) has finally gotten his own sitcom, ""When the Whistle Blows,"" and is over the moon. Problem is, the BBC decides to dumb it down and make him use funny costuming to achieve cheap laughs. As the season goes on, Andy struggles to keep ""When the Whistle Blows"" afloat and approved of, since the reviews are atrocious.

Meanwhile, Maggie (Ashley Jensen) has a tiny part in an absurd courtroom drama starring Orlando Bloom, and the arrogant Bloom starts pursuing her when she expresses a lack of interest.  (""They're basically just doing it because you're famous."" ""Well, they're not just doing it because I'm famous -- no, it's my looks as well!""). When he's not making fun of Johnny Depp (""I've got scissors for hands!"")

He and Maggie continue to tangle with a bunch of other celebs -- a sex-obsessed Daniel Radcliffe (who accidentally snaps a condom at Diana Rigg), Warwick Davis, a self-promoting Chris Martin, and Robert De Niro. He also gets mocked by David Bowie in a pub, and his sitcom is criticized by Stephen Fry. He even stars in a play directed by Ian McKellen, but neglects to notice that it's a gay romance with a man-man kiss.

It's sort of pleasant that Gervais didn't pound the ""barely employed actor"" thing to death after the first season of ""Extras."" Instead, he uses Andy's sitcom to open new storylines (and new disasters) for his increasingly embittered character, as he tries to straddle the fence between success and being a genuine actor.

Gervais continues to write wonderfully squirmy dialogue (""'TV bully kicks dwarf in face.'"" ""Accurate, but as you say there's no such thing as bad publicity"") and horribly embarrassing situations. It's all filmed in a very natural style, except that now we have some looks inside Andy's sitcom, a sort of lowbrow, widely-watched comedy with a random celeb cameo.

Poor Andy has a rough time in this season, and so Gervais really brings out his frustration and dissatisfaction with the way his poor show has been mutilated. Not to mention his tendency to embarrass himself. And Jensen is wonderful as the sweet, flaky Maggue, while Stephen Merchant is great fun as Andy's inept agent.

But the best is the stuff uttered by the actors -- Radcliffe and Bloom are hysterical as clumsily woman-chasing, self-obsessed parodies of themselves, and it's hard not to adore them for it. Bowie's ""pathetic little fat man/nobody's laughing"" song is just hilarious. And McKellen steals the show, whether it's discussing his ""method"" (""How did I know what to say? They had my lines written down on a SCRIPT"") or accidentally making it look like he and Andy had an intimate encounter.

""Extras: Season Two"" is a solid follow-up to the outstanding first season, with our ""extras"" continuing to struggle in the surreal world of showbiz. Definitely worth seeing!",1176681600,33,3297,4.967332123411978

2808929,5,B000P296C6,"'Extras' is an amazing stand out comedy from the the genius brain of Gervais and Merchant. 'Extras' focuses on the life of a movie extra and his best mate, Maggie who constantly have interactions with famous people. The cameos of the series are extremely funny, especially that of Daniel Radcliffe, David Bowie and Robert DeNiro. I enjoyed this show, I bought it online, the best way to watch them over and over (which I do and you will). The story lines are fresh and there is never a moment when I was wishing that it would end already.

The brilliance behind this show is the writing. The fact that the writers have dealt with the industry that they are making fun of makes the scenes sweeter. The Kate Winslet, which is one of the first episodes, is so spot on that I could not believe that anyone ever thought that ending this show was a good idea. The jokes that even the start (cameos) deliver makes me believe that Gervais and Merchant can get an way with anything.

The unique thing that makes Gervais and Merchant so popular is that they see the funny things in life and make them even more disastrous. I love how they can point out the insanity of the movie industry, while making a point to remind the viewer, that it is because of the public movie stars behave the way they do and get away with it. The transformation from movie extra to big star to fallen star is one that is the main storyline, but I laughed the whole way through...either I missed the point of the series, or I fully get it.

If you want to laugh-",1399420800,,1530,4.36140350877193
2808930,3,B000P296C6,"Summary
Some fun stuff, but I would have liked if the guest actors were more central to the plots of the episodes. Gervais, Jensen and Merchant played engaging, though vaguely believable characters, and I did have a few laugh-out-loud moments. The humor in this season takes on a darker tone, with a bit of squirming, than the first season, as it deals with the compromises that must be made to make yourself a star.

Give it a try if you are a die-hard Gervais fan or a fan of a quick laugh in that Gervais packaging of I should be doing better, but what's the use, but I'll try anyway and the person I should be with is my best friend.

Episodes
1. Orlando Bloom: It was okay. If you like Bloom you will enjoy it. It was almost as if they had wanted Johnny Depp and didn't get him for the episode and were having a bit of a go at him through Orlando.
2. David Bowie: My favorite episode of this season.
3. Daniel Radcliffe: Harry the hound dog, no ladies on set are safe. There are some odd, embarrassing and funny moments here.
4. Chris Martin: This was a tough one for me to enjoy, just didn't come together well.
5. Ian McKellan: It has its moments. Again the humor derives from awkward, squirming, embarrassing moments
6. Robert DeNiro: I like this one. It is the first time the Gervais and Jensen character start to realize they have more than a friendship brewing",1372118400,,1371,4.3515625

Gervais continues to poke at the silliness of much of our popular culture, and the episode with David Bowie includes one of the funniest scenes I have witnessed on television. The intelligence and willingness of Mr. Gervais to take on the shallowness of much of modern entertainment stands in stark contrast to television's current offerings, where utterly banal shows like ""Modern Family"" are considered worthy of acclaim.",1358899200,,553,5.213483146067416

Ricky surrounds himself with lovable, funny character actors that are a scream. Be sure to check out the ""Corpsing"" extra feature which has some seriously insane gaff outtakes where the crew can't keep it together.

It's more than I needed or wanted to know about Gervais, who apparently has a bondage/bdsm fetish which he acts out upon film editor  Nigel Williams who doesn't appear all that comfortable with the prospect...one can't help worrying that he puts up with being bound (by tape, etc) into also sorts of painful and humiliating positions simply because he's got bills to pay OR he is star struck.

Gervais' tongue-in-cheek look into the life of a struggling actor is a breath of fresh air.  If you liked Season One, you'll LOVE season two.

2808945,2,B000P296C6,"I should first say that I am a huge fan of ""The Office"" and Season 1 of Extras. Season 2 however shows the creators as having nothing much more to say. Their mean spirited nothingness is eerily reminiscent of the demise of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" where the goal seemed more to push the ugliness envelope than to actually provide laughs. If a joke is funny, there is no topic out of bounds. Here the comedy is missing so all that remains are the same tired parlor games of season 1. Celebrities are jerks / fame is difficult, and the disabled or freaks are fodder for amusement. They spin this within the commentary but it remains a glaring deficit upon their work.
In this world of diminished quality it is heartbreaking when great workers fail and this DVD is testament to the limits of Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant. Season 1 and the Movie (Part 3) would have left a mystery as to their abilities, but ""Extras"" Part 2 seems an inside joke which speaks volumes about how success kills comedy.

It is so fun to see what they'll do with the guest stars each episode.  Their subtle humor is a breath of fresh air.  Ricky comes off as a bit gay.  Wish there was more nudity in it - the scene with the pen just wasn't enough.  That bit was hilarious.  Loved the outtakes and these bits make you appreciate the shows even more.  The interviews are exciting to watch.  Didn't realize how short Ricky is in real life.  Looking forward to next season.  Daniel Radcliffe was funny.  Chris Martin very funny.  Last episode guest star was good - wish was more from that person.  David Bowie very funny....

2808968,4,B000P296C6,"Overall I was disappointed with this because the distinctive format from the first series has been morphed into something else entirely. In the first series, one famous person dominated and they either overdid their public image or played against it. This was especially powerful given how straight the other characters played alongside them, while still remaining funny themselves. When the famous person was absent, Gervais and Ashley Jensen's characters and performances were pitched just right to keep the laughs coming.

Admittedly, series 1 was so perfect it was always going to be difficult to follow, but the same team did it with The Office and I had high hopes here ... but when I saw who was appearing in the second season, alarm bells were ringing. Richard and Judy? Jonathan Ross?

Admittedly, Ross is pretty good, as are most of the 'celebs' who appear. And when they fail - like Orlando Bloom, it has more to do with the lines they are given rather than their performance.

The main problem is not with the performers, it's just that Extras now feels like just another 'celebrity' show - as if the main aim is to pile in as many celebs as possible and hope that the laughs will surely follow. Yes, there are still laughs here, but each episode is struggling for them rather than flowing as it did in the first season. Then it was either Ross Kemp's inflated macho man, Ben Stiller's deluded tyrant or Kate Winslet's kinky opportunist that held each episode together. Now things often feels forced, or messy (or both).

Another major reason for the decline is that the quality of the writing has dropped noticebly. An example being jokes about Ian McKellen and vaseline that felt as if it had been lifted straight out of a 'Carry On...' film (and Gervais hates Carry On films!). Ashley Jensen is sidelined too much and Stephen Merchant's insane character is brought more to the fore (although Merchant is still hilarious so this does have its plusses). And one episode features a very famous person whose name I won't reveal - but he was so criminally wasted it left me depressed!!!

That's the bad news. The good news is that this is still great stuff compared to any other recent comedy out there. If nothing else see it for Keith Chegwin's turn as a clueless actor, Ronnie Corbett as a notorious drug taker and David Bowie singing to Gervais that he is a 'fat waste of space.'

Fat he may be, but Gervais proves he still has plenty to offer - his acting is always spot on even when his writing is shakey. But on this evidence he should stay away from a 3rd series of Extras and employ his marvelous talents in another direction.",1189036800,4,2645,4.665236051502146
2808979,4,B000P296C6,"In Season 2 of Extras, Ricky Gervais's character now has secured his own sit-com, but nothing has gone quite the way he envisioned it.  While I enjoyed thoroughly eveery episode, Season 2 lacks the freshness of Season 1, and I much more enjoyed the characters actually being ""extras"", but of course, how long could that really go on? I guess the show had to reinvent itself a bit.  A moment of absolute brilliance is the episode with David Bowie, when he serenades Ricky about his sad existence.

I was pleased to see that Ashley Jensen was still with the show.  I am hoping with the success of ""Ugly Betty"" that she doesn't have to bail on this hilarious show.  While I didn't enjoy the episodes as much as Season One, I still love this show, and am eager to see more of Gervais and Jensen.",1188777600,,791,4.427586206896552
2808980,3,B000P296C6,"While Season 2 has many hilarious moments, the episodes start falling into a pattern.  In each episode, Andy is humiliated and embarrassed by something said or done by Maggie or his agent.  After a while this stops being funny and just starts being predictable and depressing.  It gets to a point where one just can't sympathize with Andy anymore because he should have fired his agent long ago and should have learned to keep his mouth shut about sensitive issues with Maggie.

Also, a lot of jokes are disguised versions of previous Gervais jokes.  For example, the joke about Sir Ian McKellan's character's method of acting is very similar in spirit to Keith Chegwin's confusion about acting (i.e., the distinction between acting and real life).  Even Orlando Bloom's hilarious part has echoes of the scene where David Brent asks his employees how old he looks and cannot bring himself to accept their answer.

What is indeed interesting, and quite brilliant actually, is how the show-within-the-show parallels the show itself.  For example, as Andy struggles with the sitcom status of When The Whistle Blows, Extras itself becomes a bit ludicrous and outlandish in its jokes and situations and more like a sitcom.  In the show, Andy bemoans having to bring on Chris Martin as a celebrity guest, when this is exactly what's going in the real show, Extras.  Very Charlie Kaufman-esque.",1188172800,5,1387,4.991304347826087
2808981,5,B000P296C6,"I would rate this higher if I could. Season 2 is funnier than the first, which was funnier than The Office.
I watched this through the fingers of my hand like watching a horror movie. I couldn't watch, but couldn't look away either.
This is British humor (humour?) and has a few references to British TV personalities, but from the context the humor comes through. Lots of ""big, big, big stars"" (to quote the box) who play against type -- and sometimes /with/ type.
I wouldn't want to have Ricky Gervais as a next door neighbor but he's genuinely funny in selected small doses.",1187049600,2,577,4.5576923076923075
2808982,5,B000P296C6,"Ricky Gervais' second series about he becomes the star of his own sitcom. The catch?  The series, after having been put through the BBC Marketing Machine, is insipid, littered with catchphrases, and is nothing like what he envisioned. It embarrasses him.  Yes, the former extra is now a star, but is the cost to one's artistic integrity worth the benefit of temporary stardom?  This through line is enough to make the series play on its own, but the weekly addition of an international guest star (this series includes a perplexed Orlando Bloom, a cheeky and randy Daniel Radcliffe and David Bowie, who is brilliantly condescending, among others) makes it the frosting on the cake.",1186704000,,681,4.956140350877193
2808983,5,B000P296C6,"I was floored by the first season, and ordered Season 2 having not seen any of it. This DVD is worth buying for the David Bowie scene alone.",1186617600,,140,4.035714285714286
2808984,5,B000P296C6,"Series 2 brings Extras darned near close to the heights achieved by the classic The Office.  It's amazing to me how Ricky Gervais's brilliance seems to be somewhat overlooked in the US, but then again, not everyone can appreciate his brand of distinctly British humor.  The cameos in Series 2 are as enjoyable as the first series.  I personally found Orlando Bloom, David Bowie, and (surprisingly) Chris Martin to be particularly amusing.  The bit with Chris Martin after his episode's credits left my sides hurting with laugher.

Extras Series 2 exceeds in engaging the viewer in Andy's struggles.  It often achieves a real emotional poignancy and relatability which can be uncommon for comedies.  The supporting cast, including Stephen Merchant and the amazing Ashley Jensen.  And Shaun Williamson (as Barry) lends the series some of its best laughs with his scenes with Merchant.

For fans of Extras, you probably already own this.  For anyone curious and looking for something new and refreshing, check this out, but make sure you grab up the first series while you're at it.

And if you haven't already (and shame on you ;), watch the original The Office by Ricky Gervais.",1186099200,2,1177,4.984615384615385
2808985,5,B000P296C6,"Ricky Gervais takes 'Extras' up a notch and makes Season 2 even better than the first.  Andy Millman gets his wish to be a star but ends up selling himself out in the process, which makes the struggle for success that much more entertaining.  There are more/bigger stars in Season 2 but it's really the shows writing that makes it enjoyable.  Everyone gets to punch Millman while he's down and the cast works so well together you'd think it was a documentary.

I love 'Extras - Second Season' the most of Gervais' work and the DVD has some cool bonus features such as Gervais and Stephen Merchant walking you through the process of the story development and shooting.",1185148800,,667,4.627118644067797
2808986,5,B000P296C6,One of the most brilliant comedians ever! This is a fantastic show. Subtle humor... over the top humor and everything in between. I haven't laughed this hard since Curb Your Enthusiasm. Totally Hilarious.,1184803200,,204,5.212121212121212
2808987,5,B000P296C6,"As ""The Office"" has now become television lore, Ricky Gervais could have turned out something similar for his next effort,  (Think Lucille Ball and her post-""I Love Lucy"" programs) but instead, he went in an entirely different direction.  Hooray, we win!  Season 2 of ""Extras"" is even funnier than season 1. Andy Millman has achieved some sort of fame with his new sitcom, but he's not happy.  Meanwhile, his agent still doesn't have a clue, his best friend Maggie still struggles as an extra and Britain's (and some of America's) best and brightest make clever cameos.

The fact that Ashley Jensen as Maggie did not get an Emmy nomination for her work on this show is criminal.  Maggie is a brilliant comic creation and Jensen makes her ditzy but incredibly lovable.  The blank look and muttered ""Hmm?"" Maggie gives when she realizes she's in trouble is classic.  Stephen Merchant is incredibly funny as the lackluster agent and lights up the screen whenever he's on.  You'll never forget his scene with a wire whisk.

And then there's Gervais who this time out plays a much more sympathetic character than David Brent.  Andy is even the straight man at times, though there are the usual Gervais-esque slip ups.

One of the best things about ""Extras"" is that it doesn't seem to have the type of formula ""The Office"" did and therefore, we won't have an American remake. ""Extras"" stands completely on its own and hopefully will continue to do so.",1184803200,,1445,4.782258064516129
2808988,3,B000P296C6,"In the new season of ""Extras"" Andy (Ricky Gervais) takes the next logical step in his quest for superstardom. No longer slumming with those other extras he has joined the cast of a new sitcom. The main theme of this season is the role of selling out in the name of career advancement. Andy seems to think the show is crap (as do the critics and most anybody he run into on the street) so to even be on the show (which involves him wearing a silly wig and glasses) is a sacrifice of his principles. He learns that when you are at the bottom all of your anger is directed upwards and unquestionably justified, but when you climb up that ladder you are suddenly a target of somebody else's anger. Hobos want extra big handouts, moms want you to visit their sick kid, and ""victims"" of your abuse want you to make a donation to their favorite charity. . .it's never ending really. I found all this kind of funny because for my money Gervais has one of the least compromised careers out there. Well yes, he did take that ""Night at the Museum"" gig, but even there he tried to bring soul to that failure. . .and failed, but I forgive him.

As the season wears on it becomes quite apparent that Andy isn't cut out for this whole celebrity thing. He is far too susceptible to emotional outbursts which lead to him being placed in some fairly embarrassing situations. To make matters worse his sidekick Maggie and agent Darren only work to make his life a little more difficult. Yet despite this his star continues to rise. He sticks to his catchphrase, even when out of character, and plays to his base. And I'm sure that whole incident where he beat up a midget didn't hurt matters either. Of course this being HBO the whole show exists pretty much as an excuse to spit on the idea of celebrity. This along with ""The Comeback"" and ""Entourage"" has created a little subgenre where the viewer is invited to pretend that they are also a part of the entertainment industry. Of course the joke at the core of all of these shows is that in reality the entertainment industry is really a nasty, vile place where no sane person would choose to hang out.

This season improves upon the last but the show remains good not great. The lines got funnier, the cringe factor was turned up and Gervais even throws in some physical humor for us. There are guest stars in every episode playing themselves but the one that struck closest to gold was Daniel Radcliffe playing a sexually warped wannabe gigolo who tries to bed Maggie. Since Radcliffe is really only known as Harry Potter the joke works quite well. The whole season feels unfair to poor Andy. He wants to approach the sitcom in a dignified manner but those suits at the BBC stick their noses in and practically force him to sell out. That left him with the choice of being an extra or being a laughing stock, he chose the latter and I think the show is better because of it.",1183507200,5,2909,4.415270018621974
