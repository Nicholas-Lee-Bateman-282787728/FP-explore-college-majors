8716851,5,B00XW4TO1M,"This is our first experience with the Octonauts - I was pleasantly surprised other than the really annoying song during the creature reports, this DVD is actually pretty good I like that during the creature reports they teach real facts about sea creatures that are in the episode. It takes a lot to find a DVD that can hold my 3 years olds attention for long and this Octonauts search and rescue is a huge hit.  Contains 8 episodes and run time is 90 min. Episodes are:

- kelp forest rescue
-giant whirlpool
- jellyfish bloom
- manatees
- triggerfish
- scared sperm whale
- giant kelp forest
- humphead parrotfish ",1468713600,3,616,4.531531531531532
