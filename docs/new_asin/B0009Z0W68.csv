This movie alone justifies the cost. Excellent picture and sound.

Boy on a Dolphin is Sophia Loren's best movie. Sophia Loren has unequaled natural beauty, no tattoos, no strange piercings, a real woman!",1316822400,,276,4.851063829787234
2343884,5,B0009Z0W68,"For me, this film encapsulates all the qualities of Sofia Loren that make her more than just a beautiful actress, but an enduring figurehead of womanliness on screen.
It's all here, the maternal, the earthy, the sensual, the humble, the proud, the vulnerability, the strength & street smarts, comical, touching, determined yet possessed of a hard-won moral core.
Add to that singular asset one of the most hauntingly seductive musical scores in film history, lashings of vivid technicolor location photography set amidst the greek islands, Clifton Webb playing Clifton Webb, Julie London singing the title track and the above mentioned Loren, emerging from the sea in transparent wet cheese cloth ( her introduction to american film audiences ) and you can't ask for much more.
The story isn't Shakespeare, but it has a beginning, middle and end with enough conflict & intrigue to keep things entertaining.
The movie is also consistently visually beautiful to look at.
I declare my bias as this is one of my favorite films.
The Spanish import release has a good crisp picture and the sound is good. You can switch off the Spanish overdubbing and subtitles if like me you only speak English.
I write this in 2011, I cannot think why Twentieth Century Fox has not yet released this on dvd in America as it's one of Sofia Loren's most iconic film roles.",1302048000,20,1350,4.899563318777292
2343885,4,B0009Z0W68,"On the island of Hydra in Greece, a peasant girl (Sophia Loren in her American film debut), who makes her living diving for sponges, discovers an ancient statue of a gold boy riding on a bronze dolphin. An archaeologist (Alan Ladd) and a wealthy art collector (Clifton Webb) race against time in an attempt to obtain the statue, Ladd for the glory of Greece and Webb for his own personal collection. The film is most famous for the indelible image (even if you haven't seen the film, you've seen the photo) of a dripping wet Loren fresh out of the Aegean sea. The film itself is grand entertainment greatly enhanced by the stunning Greek landscapes and islands in CinemaScope shot by Milton Krasner (ALL ABOUT EVE) and the Oscar nominated score by Hugo Friedhofer, one of the most beautiful film scores ever written. Julie London sings the haunting theme song over the opening credits while Sophia Loren sings it, in Greek yet, in the film proper. Directed by Jean Negulesco. With Laurence Naismith, Jorge Mistral, Gertrude Flynn and Alex Minotis.

The Fox DVD from Spain is in its original 2.35 CinemaScope format and for the most part, it's a nice transfer though a little restoration work or remastering wouldn't have hurt.",1295827200,3,1226,4.81042654028436
2343886,5,B0009Z0W68,"No ordinary fish story, ""Boy On A Dolphin"" looms larger with every telling.  There is a timeless quality.  Filmed on location, it is an eye-popping view
of island life in Greece, and altogether a fascinating showcase for a young Sophia Loren.  The traditional music and dance sequences are a special joy.
The first displays an amusing continuity issue.  The talented actress wears
a top with a diagonal stripe that reverses direction, shifting shoulders in
the middle of the dance.  A quick nod focused on someone off-camera, at one
point, is further evidence of something that required more than one take to accomplish.  At the end of the dance, Loren fairly stumbles out of the line
as though exhausted by the effort.

Even so, her delivery is flawless, throughout.  A consumate professional in
her debut.

The Aegean never looked more breathtaking, on the surface.  Some underwater scenes were overpopulated by denizens of the deep, as one would expect with creatures confined in an aquarium.  Also, Alan Ladd reminds her to hold her breath when they begin diving together.  Not advisable using SCUBA. Oops!

On a scale of ten, not perfect, but a fine film nonetheless.

2343887,3,B0009Z0W68,"This 1955, Fox vehicle for CinemaScope offers up fabulous scenery in the form of Greek locations and Sophia Loren.  The plot about salvaging a rare greek statue is inconsequential, but adequate.  Alan Ladd has little to do, but Clifton Webb entertains with his usual, urbane sarcasm.  As for Loren, this is the one that opens with her emergence from the sea wearing just enough to make it better than a nude scene; the first 10 minutes are worth the price of admission on their own.  Hugo Friedhofer wrote one of his wonderful scores for the picture, and it's a major highlight, too.
This Spanish DVD presents both an English and Spanish soundtrack (and optional Spanish subtitles).  The good news is that it's presented in it's original widescreen (2:55 to 1) CinemaScope ratio.  The bad news is that it's letterboxed and not enhanced for 16:9 tv setups; it also uses the magnetic mono soundtrack for both versions, instead of the original English 4-track, stereo sound.  As of 2010, this is the only version available in it's original screen format on dvd, so you'll have to settle until Fox decides to release an anamorphic, stereophonic version in the US.
The need for profits seems to have made many of the major studios very adamant about releasing classic films on dvd and blu-ray for US audiences, unless you pay premium prices for on-demand dvd-r's.  What a shame.",1276387200,10,1373,4.837606837606837
2343888,5,B0009Z0W68,"Many people won't find the film exciting. I find it very entertaining because of the cast and, the story. Alan Ladd, Sophia Loren and Clifton Webb star. It is a story of a sunken treasure, a gold statue of a Boy On A Dolphin. I had been hoping for years to see this on DVD. But, the only thing I could find was a used VHS copy, and paid through the nose for it. Of course, I watch it but I was hoping the studio would soon release it on DVD as they had advertised. Now, I do see one on DVD (Amazon) and hope it isn't a pirated, and not too good of a transfer.

Funny thing is that the statue is at the entrance of a parking lot in Los Angeles across from a famous hamburger stand near Ramparts street. Of course NOBODY knows what the hell the statue is there for and that it was featured in a motion picture. And yes, I was working in another theater when it played first run in Hollywood. Memories!

Well, it is on PAL and my DVD player plays NTSC and PAL. Boy, do I ever love this film. Also one of the Dolphin statues is in the parking lot by Tommy's Hamburger joint in Los Angeles. I would sure like to have it. Nobody knows what the hell it is there for?",1253404800,4,1159,3.9699570815450644
2343889,4,B0009Z0W68,"I just love that line from Sophia Loren in this movie as she fends off the advances of some lothario.  What makes the movie so good is that it has aged into a fine wine.  This is Greece and the Greek isles circa 1950's. Not the tourist ant hill it is now. There was actually room to shoot this movie. Plus the always wonderful Clifton Webb reprising his arrogant plutocrat American tycoon role which no one (other than Edward Arnold) does better. Here he is, decked out in yachting attire and all, sailing the Med in his steam yacht in search of ancient treasures. It's a battle of wits between his cunning and money and Ladd and Loren's honesty and innocence.  You can guess who wins in the end but its fun anyway. When the treasure slips from Webb's hands he wistfully directs his yacht skipper to sail of to 'Monte Carlo, where else?'
Wish this would come out in DVD.",1245628800,4,870,4.391304347826087
2343890,5,B0009Z0W68,"This wistful sentiment to the hauntingly beautiful title song to ""Boy on a Dolphin"" is sung in a mesmerizing near whisper by the lovely Julie London, to images of the Greek Isles,the Aegean Sea, and the equally exquisite Sophia Loren.  An engrossing story of Phaedra, the sponge diver who discovers a pricless statue underneath the sea, Alan Ladd as the archeologist who wants to recover it as a national treasure, Clifton Webb as the deliciously unscrupulous art dealer who wants it for personal gain, along with an pleasant supporing cast.  Memorable scenes include Ms. Loren in a beguiling dance with native young men, Ms. Loren fresh from a dive in the famed clinging wet dress, and the grand finale which I leave you to discover.  An absorbing tale with a timeless message for all who seek riches and the surprising places we find them.",1135987200,23,841,4.826388888888889
2343891,5,B0009Z0W68,"I have always loved this movie. Sophia Loren plays the part of a sponge diver in the Greeks islands and discovers a beautiful statue of a Boy on a Dolphin while diving.  She enlists the help of an American played by Alan Ladd to help her raise it up, before another unscrupulous wealthy man discovers where it is and brings it up for himself.  The cinematography and scenery around Greece are fabulous. This movie was Sophia Loren's US screen debut and she has never looked better. I have an old VHS version of this movie and am hoping the studios will release this on DVD.

Update 5/9/12. Almost 7 years later, and still waiting for this movie to released on DVD.",1128124800,27,664,4.471074380165289
2343892,3,B0009Z0W68,"Sophia Loren stars as Phaedra, a poor sponge diver on the lovely Greek isle of Hydra.  While diving, she discovers an ancient statue of a boy riding a dolphin, which is believed to grant wishes.  Her shiftless boyfriend wants to sell it to an unscrupulous art collector (Clifton Webb), but Phaedra wants to give it to anthropologist Jim Calder (Alan Ladd), who would return it to the Greek government.

This is Sophia's movie all the way.  She is natural and lusty and full of fire, and the sight of her, soaking wet, rising out of the sea is the best moment in the film.  In 1957, Sophia's accent was still quite heavy and she is sometimes hard to understand, but her acting skill transcends the dialogue and you really believe she is the proud and sensual Phaedra.  Alan Ladd, unfortunately, was horribly miscast as her leading man.  He's nervous and awkward and way too short for her.

If you've been to Greece, or dream of going one day, you will enjoy the location photography.  Hydra, Athens, and Epidaurus are so lovingly filmed that you'll want to be right there, folk dancing at the taverna with Phaedra.  Definitely recommended for those who enjoy the beauty of both Sophia Loren and Greece.",1122940800,19,1201,4.6761904761904765
8070680,5,B0009Z0W68,"This is the movie that inspired my lifelong yearning to see the Aegean Sea!  I was only 13 or 14 when Boy on a Dolphin came to the only theatre in my small southern hometown.  My memories of the film are more visual than the story.  The hauntingly beautiful theme song, Nature Boy, still touches my soul.  And, yes, I made it to Greece in 2011 and cruised the ports of the Aegean.  The highlight of that experience was swimming the the sea and falling in love with Turkey!",1510444800,,472,4.258426966292135
