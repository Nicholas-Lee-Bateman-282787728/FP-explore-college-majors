8266281,3,B0017KORGK,"As a level 2 university student of ASL, this cd did not have the tips and finger spelling practice I was hoping for. It may be helpful to others looking for advice on muscles and how to avoid stress to the hand, etc.. I was looking for ways to improve my ability to read finger spelling.",1367280000,3,287,4.142857142857143

8266283,5,B0017KORGK,"I must say that I bought this DVD on a whim. I had just finished ASL 101 and was looking for ways to improve my fingerspelling. I am so glad that I found this page. The exercises and explanations are topnotch. Mary is a great teacher, truly. A hearing student will likely notice immediate improvement after viewing this, because they'll look at fingerspelling in a very different way: the Deaf way. However, this DVD is great in the long term as well, because the exercises will encourage continuous improvement.

Thank you!",1295308800,5,524,4.758241758241758
