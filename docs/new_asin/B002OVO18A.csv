The lead actress is stunningly hot, and the whole time I was watching this movie, I couldn't help myself from staring like hunted lion at her tight worn jeans, and butt...

3963316,5,B002OVO18A,"In a similar vein as genre classics like ROSEMARY'S BABY, THE EXORCIST, and THE OMEN, Ti West's THE HOUSE OF THE DEVIL is occult-themed horror done right. It favors atmosphere over intensity, structure over style, and isn't afraid to put aside the ""in your face"" conventions of modern horror films in order to deliberately pace its eerie and well-crafted story influenced by the ""satanic panic"" trend of the early 1980's. And in a movie marketplace that seems to shun building atmosphere and other such attributes in favor of gore and/or a PG-13 rating, that's a good thing indeed.",1255132800,5,581,4.938775510204081
3963317,5,B002OVO18A,"Ti West's ""House of the Devil"" looks and feels so much like a horror film of the late 70's or early 80's it'd be entirely too easy to mistake it for one if not for the presence of industry vets Dee Wallace, Mary Waranov, and Tom Noonan.  Think ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""Black Christmas,"" or ""Halloween.""

This movie performances and dialogue are so perfectly analogous to a bygone era of a film making that you'd swear this was a lost classic and not just a style exercise.

Thankfully it completely succeeds as an unnerving and suspenseful horror film as well.  Its slow burn may be too much for the ADD set who think it isn't horror without rapid fire cuts and heavy metal music.

But those with patience will be rewarded with a movie that can truly get under your skin.

Enter the ""House of the Devil"" to see just how well done this experiment is, stay for the creepy atmosphere and the bloody, satisfying climax.",1254614400,9,910,4.5182926829268295
3963318,4,B002OVO18A,"""The House of the Devil"" is an assured little film that fondly invokes horror films from the 1970s and 1980s. Many people are going to complain that this movie is slow and boring, but they are missing the joys of this type of film making completely. The best horror is a slow burn leading up to the proverbial poo hitting the whirling blades. You have time to begin to care about these characters, before something terrible happens to them and it cuts deep.

The plot: a college student is ready to move out of her dorm and into a nice rental home, but needs to make some quick cash to pay the first month's rent. Responding to a flyer requesting a babysitter, she will get much more than she bargained for.

The final twenty minutes, while rapid-paced and bloody, do not live up to the promising tension built up by the rest of the movie. However, if the end was a bit of a letdown, overall the movie was very well done. This is not the action-packed gore fest that some people might be expecting. Instead, it is a solid throwback to horror films that used setting, tone, atmosphere, character-building, and music to build up to the scary!",1254614400,55,1140,4.475961538461538

House of The Devil is a good old school style horror film. One of the things about it that's fun is that the less you know about it the better. The basic plot setup is that a pretty girl, Jocelin Donahue looking particularly vulnerable due to being super skinny, gets hired to be a baby sitter and then creepy things start happening. The whole movie hangs on her shoulders basically and Donahue nails it pretty well. She looks like a pixie mashed up with a girl you'd see in an old 80s movie, the film is a period piece and that part of the reason for that. The other 2 stand out actors are of course Tom Noonan and Mary Woronov. Both of them have been down this road countless times but manage to bring some new quirks here and there. Again no spoilers but Mary has a particularly good scene towards the end.

It's interesting that the people that went on to have the biggest careers were Greta Gerwig and Lena Dunham, providing only a voice here. Donahue is more conventionally likeable and honestly seems like she could genuinely get killed at any moment. Just goes to show how random show biz can be or in the case of Dunham how important having rich parents is.",1491955200,,1406,4.445736434108527

3963327,5,B002OVO18A,"No Anchovies: A Review of The House of the Devil

For film fans who are nostalgic for the 80s, but are tired of re-watching Halloween to get your retro-horror fill, Ti Wests The House of the Devil (2009) is a refreshing rejuvenation of late 70s, early 80s horror. Shot on 16 mm film, this movie seems to have been teleported from the 80s to the 21st century. With the grainy film, dim cinematography and featuring of Mtley Cres Kickstart My Heart, West brings viewers back to the good ol days of flannel, indoor ashtrays and Satan-worshipping.

Samantha (Jocelin Donahue), desperately in need of money, takes a babysitting job, but haven't we all learned what happens when you babysit after watching Elizabeth Shue in Adventures in Babysitting (1987)? Clearly, Samantha missed that film as she coerces her friend into driving her to a house in the middle of nowhere with foreshadowing of what is to come as the cemetery that the two friends pass on the way is briefly superimposed over an establishing shot of the house.

After Samantha is left alone to babysit, she turns on her Walkman and dances around the empty house like Tom Cruise in Risky Business (1983), a moment of brief loudness in an otherwise quiet film. West effectively creates a quiet and tame atmosphere for most of the film which causes the grand finale to be even more discombobulating. Tired from all her dancing, Samantha decides to order a pizza in which the pizza boy on the other line of the phone jokingly asks her if she wants extra anchovies, paying homage to Joan Micklin Silvers Loverboy (1989). Samantha declines the anchovies, but will definitely be receiving much more than pizza that night and unfortunately it won't be Patrick Dempsey.

Wests film contains a hefty amount of intertextuality with numerous films from the 70s and 80s and is incredibly postmodern as it takes on one of postmodernisms main mantras: to recreate/re-see history. In this film, West gets away from the generic slasher formula that was trending toward the end of the 20th century and creates a film that deserves recognition as it highlights why people tend to and probably should fear strangers. Nothing about this film was hokey or overdone, but was a beautiful fusion of present-day concerns through a kaleidoscope of the past.",1489363200,3,2290,4.879177377892031
3963328,4,B002OVO18A,"***WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD***
From the moment we are brought into this film, it is obvious that Ti West's The House of the Devil is going to include a reemergence of the classic '80s stereotypes we have grown to know and love. Ti West does something extremely smart when placing the opening credits over freeze frames of our main character, Samantha (Jocelin Donahue), because it allows us to automatically feel connected to her. It also reminds us of the films we have watched over and over. However, with this being a horror film, West also creates an atmosphere that makes the viewer slightly uncomfortable. The dulled sounds and grainy edits, something that we have become accustomed to when viewing films made 30 years ago, is somehow out of place when viewing a movie that came out in the last decade. The feeling of nostalgia that viewers experience is almost misplaced, and it begins the sensation of terror in their stomachs for the anticipation of what may come next. This feeling of dread compounds throughout the movie when little oddities begin to occur, such as Mr. Ulman's peculiar phone habits, strange appearance, ""off"" mannerisms, and unusual interactions with his own wife, whom Samantha engages with as well. Everything adds to this dreadful feeling. So, commence the white knuckles on every viewer, as Samantha is left alone in this Hitchcockian house. The suspense builds, and the mise-en-sc&egrave;ne alone is enough to make a viewer go mad. Although there are moments of relief placed strategically throughout, the anticipation for the modern day, fast-paced gore we have grown used to is immense. The lull in the movie, which is preceded by the abrupt and gory death of Samantha's friend Megan, allows a viewer's imagination to run rampant. The yearning for questions to be answered grows exponentially with every passing scene as Samantha slowly explores the home. I commend Ti West's use of these elements that build suspense, similar to the ones that the great Alfred Hitchcock used thoroughly himself. When the film is over, the viewers are left with a feeling in the pit in their stomachs that is never quite resolved much like Samantha.",1488844800,,2166,5.019444444444445
3963329,5,B002OVO18A,"House of the Devil takes you on an emotional roller-coaster from beginning to end. You start by comfortably strapping into the relatable college element, listening to the deafening, upbeat 80s soundtrack and awaiting the thrill. Once you're secure and devoted without an exit, you begin by slowly traveling into a heightened suspense and elevated anxiety as you become aware of the climactic drop that is inevitably in front of you. Once you reach the top, you get a few short moments to gasp and take your last breath before you're consumed by the full-speed terror, teased with not knowing what twists and turns may come next. Finally, you're abruptly halted as the ride has come to a close. Did you bring that paper bag I mentioned? Because, House of the Devil leaves you stagnate with echoing screams, recurring images, and a new sense of lingering, hyperventilating horror.  Although released in 2009, the filming techniques and styles beautifully capture the 80s atmosphere. Being a college student myself, this film truly puts into perspective the setting of a bumming rides, bored eating, clutter-filled dorm living, hopeful college student that only wants a quick fix for cash so she has enough money to pay for her first months rent on a new apartment. The subtle, childlike demeanor of her best friend, Megan, engages the audience in some comedic relief with the suspicious circumstances of Samanthas new babysitting gig. Low angle shots and bottom lighting personifies the Ulmans house to be a powerful and frightening menace, similar to the cannibals house in Tobe Hoopers Texas Chainsaw Massacre and the Bates mansion in Alfred Hitchcocks Psycho . From the moment Megan is driving Samantha to the Ulmans house, viewers are sinking in their seats preparing for the expected and cliche jump scare. House of the Devil is the first, and hopefully last, film that left me feeling like I was crawling out of my own skin, that my heart was pounding against my chest begging for escape; In that moment, I was completely and utterly haunted.",1488499200,,2046,5.0

Sadly the ending was seriously lacking any substance. It was pretty predictable and then it was just over. It was inconcluded , just like his later film THE INNKEEPERS.

From the freeze-frame credits to the hairstyles of the newscasters, I cackled at everything I had forgotten about that golden age of scream teen flicks. Unlike other movies set in the 80s that use current music and camerawork, West uses lots of slow pullaways and even achieves the correct grainy appearance of the film. And unlike those set-in-80s movies that leave technology off-screen, West's protagonist uses a real Walkman with orange-foam-padded headphones - beautiful. If someone walked in on a screening of this movie, they could easily think it's really from the 70s or 80s. Oh yeah: and it's a great story with good scares and a satisfying ending.

Have to mention that I'd also forgotten how important telephones used to be in movies of the 70s and 80s. There were closeups of the handset, the dread of the ringing and lots of dialing. Oh, how dialing a rotary phone builds tension!",1469923200,5,1038,4.798882681564246

Yes, it is that good.
Yes, the director edited by himeslf to make sure that the picture is there as he wanted.
Yes the back ground sound effect scares us but not so cheap way. It's just for tension's sake. Not for SURPRISE! way.
Yes, there is twist and it is kind of corney but it was forgivable since the story was so so good till then.
The story never hurries since it knows how to delivers when to actually make the audience throw the punch and it did work so so well that we are really knock out and never come back.
We from the beginning that there will be something going on but not this much higher unexpected way.
The ending final battle was enough waiting for. The blood on her cloth, I cannot forget. It is not just a regular Horror film.
It is work of art.
The girl is not at all pretty but well enough to rull the movie the whole time. How?
She dance, she do the line again and again to get herself together not to be panic and run away from all this. She needs money and she is desperate.

The story I am not gonna tell much.
It's about a girl who is in dorm and she is having this stupid roommate who is sleeping with a boy all the time that is really annoying.
She decides to move out since she is having her 4th year and all.
She cannot have a job and all, there is this strange call saying they need a baby sit. She asks her friend for a ride.
The house was far away and they drive there anyway.
It was qite strange from the beginning but she was ok with it. The man says he lied and there is no baby but his sick mother.
She still is ok since they are telling to give her 200$ cash.
She aven asks for 400$ and he says yes.
Her friend was pissed off since they agreed that if they are strange, they promissed to leave at once and they are more then strange now.

Jeff Grace's music helps as does Eliot Rockett's 16mm lensing. And Jocelin Donahue is very appealing. But Ti West, who wrote, directed, and edited (edited? this was edited?) is to blame for the somnambulant pacing. And the payoff? A nod to a certain 1968 horror film. Really?

Some annoying lapses, too. For example, Donahue knocks over a vase and picks up parts of it with a dustbin and broom (she somehow knew how to find licketysplit), but this is forgotten about. The TV in the spooky house only gets channel 13 and she only watches what's on (news and the much, much, much better Night of the Living Dead) before switching it off. She passes her friends Volvo in the cemetery, a friend shes been worried sick over, and she doesnt even peek in the car.

3963383,4,B002OVO18A,"Style trumps substance in Ti Wests delightfully atmospheric callback to 70s and 80s occult horror.  Neither gory nor exhilarating, if you don't like slow-burns then you definitely won't like this.  However, if youd enjoy a callback to atmospheric 70s-80s horror with a well-developed and endearing victim, then this is for you.

From the opening shot director Ti West (The Sacrament, The Innkeepers, Cabin Fever 2) transports us to what feels like 1980, a time of payphones and public bulletin boards with thumb-tacked want-ads.  The score, film quality, wardrobe and even the credits simply ooze ""VHS horror.""  The film doesn't just ""look"" old, it ""feels"" old.  Like it's been in a dusty box of tapes in a closet for the past 35 years.

As with It Follows (2014), we take our time getting to know and invest in our female lead, Samantha (Jocelin Donahue; Insidious Chapter 2).  Her hair and delicate features remind me of a young Margot Kidder (Black Christmas) and, thus, a good victim.  She rents a house from an all-too-kind landlord (cameo by Dee Wallace; The Howling, Cujo, Halloween) but desperately needs money to pay her rent.

West gives us a lot of subtle hints, and then some unsubtle ones in the spirit of the more obvious horror of the 80s.  When Sam finds a ""babysitter wanted"" flyer, it's surrounded by flyers/ads for watching the upcoming lunar eclipse.  Later the radio and TV news harbinger the ominous eclipse.  Add that to the babysitter trope, a house in the middle of nowhere and her friend (reluctant to leave Sam alone) finding the house and owner creepy and no one in the audience should have missed whats going to happen.

The house is huge and remote.  Its owner (Tom Noonan; Wolfen, RoboCop 2) is weird but polite, speaking of preparation for the eclipse to a suspicious degree.  He clearly wants Sam alone in the house, protesting the presence of her friend.  When Sam hesitates the old man offers her $200, $300, then $400 to watch over the house for a few hours while he and his wife (Mary Woronov; Warlock, Chopping Mall) are out.  Sam's friend says this is too good to be true and she should leaveshes obviously right!

There's a lot of exposition but it's delivered tactfully enough; like a subtle delivery of blatant content, which also holds for the scares and gore, when present (though rare and skewed to the end).

The film moves at a slow pace and it tiptoes the line between slightly boring and provokingly interesting.  I don't mind, though.  Im digging the nostalgic atmosphere and West does a god job of getting us familiar with Samantha and her friend (Greta Gerwig).  Several scenes endear them to viewers, my favorite being Sams cute scene dancing around the creepy house listening to a Walkman.

The payoff in the end is nothing we haven't seen before (many times, in fact, in 70s occult horror), but again, I don't mind.  Its creepy.  And even though we saw it coming and very little happens until the very end, I enjoyed this for what it was.  Honestly, I enjoyed the buildup in the first 60 minutes more than the payoff at the end.  Some may even argue that the final act does the films first hour no justice.  Despite this perhaps somewhat justified criticism, I felt the film was largely beautifully executed.

West wisely cast aside the CGI, overblown gore for shock value, nudity and over-exposition.  He ignores the rules of modern horror success and contemporary tropes to instead resurrect the nigh-forgotten tropes of decades past as he breathes life into that 70s/80s style that never truly benefited from high production value back in its time.  In short, West has created a classic horror film for a modern audience that has lost its patience with dated filmsand I applaud him for it!

Theres actually nothing original at all in this film.  However, Wests careful approach restores my faith in an overplayed genre.",1436313600,,3877,4.79788838612368

3963385,2,B002OVO18A,"I get what this was supposed to be, and if it had fulfilled its promise I would have loved it. I enjoyed the slow build, and the inconsistencies of style wherein the producers couldn't pick a year (as though 1978 through 1987 happened all at once). But what a stinker of an ending. I really am annoyed that I wasted a couple of hours of valuable Sunday free time on a this junk. It could have been great, but in the end it just fails miserably. I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because the slow build was well crafted, but it got just 2 because it is a huge let down. Not scary in the least, and I was ready to love this movie. Over an hour of build up to be left wanting.

Not scary at all. If you like the build and do not care if a horror movie is actually scary, rent away. If you want your scary movies to be scary, look elsewhere.",1431820800,3,831,3.9464285714285716
3963386,4,B002OVO18A,"Imagine a film made in 2009 but one that is a period film based in the 70's - 80's, now imagine what if it is shot so well that you actually feel it is made in several years back. This was something about my experience with this film, I know how I resisted the urge of googling about the film while watching the film. For what it is worth I must say I am glad a film like The House of The Devil has been made. And here I will tell you why...

Horror is a very strange genre. Horror film fans will watch every film in the world that is remotely related to supernatural. But horror film fans rate a film decently very rarely. No horror film will ever have a perfect rating. Horror film fans keep thinking that if they keep giving films small ratings, the films will get better, this is where I come in.  I watch horror for the splendour, for the wonder, for that feeling that the supernatural is meeting the horrors of the subconscious mind, for that fear of the unknown and that my friend is where The House of the Devil really plays well.

You see, the film is about a baby sitter who's accepted to baby sit an old lady. This she does inspite of all the negatives and risks involved with doing such a thing. Her room mate is worried for her because the house is an old house sitting in the middle of nowhere but hey our girl here needs money for her college so she takes the job and is promised a handsome deal.

Like any jean wearing curious girl with delightful eyes, she roams the house never once seing that old lady who's room is upstairs. Think about this, the first forty five minutes of the film won me over, oh my god, there is so much that you will think of and there are so many possibilities and ends, she is such a good actor you will feel the film is 100% true to scene.

I loved the sets, I loved the music, I loved the dancing (go figure) and I loved the commotion. Where the film failed is what you will see if you watch this film. I will always remember this for the dancing scene, it is disquietingly brilliant I thought. And that one scene has won it's place n my mind for ever. I think it was done beautifully. The film may not make many people's all time favourite horror films but for just the atmosphere that the film creates in it's first hour or so I am giving it the extra star.

PS - if you're a strict rater, you may not like this film too much so I really really want you to go easy on this one.",1430956800,,2425,4.084033613445378
3963387,3,B002OVO18A,"Creepy slow-burner that pays homage to 70s and 80s horror films, but is ultimately kind of empty. Tom Noonan has been creepy in other films (The Pledge; Manhunter) but here he's almost too nice to be believable. And I would've had Greta Garwig play the lead role instead of the lead chosen. On a modest budget, they did a good job of capturing the 1980s, tho I did notice little anachronisms like margharita pizza (I don't recall that being around in the 80s?) and spoken colloquialisms that didn't arrive until later. But these are minor. The film is a big build-up to its conclusion, but it's perhaps a bit too slow in doing so, with odd pacing and cinematography at times. Music from The Shining was recycled here, which I found kinda silly. This is a film that pays deep respect to grindhouse horror/suspense films, but it just lacks something. It's well made and stylish, but ultimately empty calories -- there aren't really any ideas or lasting images or memes that can come from this film. It's like a really well-done student film of a filmmaker finding her skills and talents and cinematically harkening back to an earlier time (as a Gen Xer this is appreciated, but when you pay homage you have to have more substance than just the stylistic things you are paying tribute to). If not taken too seriously, a fun film, but definitely minor league.",1430438400,,1355,4.673640167364017

It's done, apparently, to imitate the aesthetic of '80s horror films, and in that it succeeds in terms of set dressing, hair, clothes, the fact that nobody's carrying a cell phone, etc. It gets one star for that and another for the acting.

**SPOILER ALERT: PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD** The lead character, who, along with her best friend, was far too interesting to be stuck in this boring mess. She took on a babysitting job, only to not get called back. Then, finally, at the last minute, she does get a call. If this built any actual dramatic tension that informed the plot, it would be worth it; as it was, it only filled time. The dumb horny dorm roommate got a lot of screen time (given her uselessness, plot-wise) that went nowhere. The ""funny-tasting"" pizza in the actual pizza parlor was, I suppose, foreshadowing; it made no sense otherwise. The sudden death of the best friend had only minimal logic behind it, as it seemed to me once she finished her cigarette, she'd be on her way, and having to hide a body that wasn't fit for the villains' use was a waste of time (and why was it just randomly at the house for the heroine to trip over?). At the end we find that the villains were freaky cultists of such a prosaically Satanic stripe their intentions didn't even need to be outlined (one can imagine them saying heavily over breakfast, ""The demon is rattling around the attic again. I suppose it's about time to go get *another* virgin..."" ""Very well, dear, I still have some of those babysitting fliers left over from last solstice; I'll just run on up to the college and post a few. Goodness, this is getting tiresome. Why didn't we just buy a gerbil?""). There is a vaguely ""gotcha"" ending; one imagines that Evil Supreme lives on to bore future audiences into a stupor.

Seriously, if you HAVE to have it, purchase a used copy. Normally I'd say don't because you might have a damaged disc that pixillates, but frankly that could only add to the appeal here.",1423440000,2,2103,4.517060367454068

First off, lets just say, I really wanted to like this film. I really really really wanted to like it, given my love for classic horrors like Halloween, etc etc. It just fell so short of what I expected. Which I guess is why you should NOT expect anything going into this one. That's why I only gave it 2 stars, I just did not like it enough to give it 3.

I love Halloween, it's one of my favorite classic horror films, and since the pace of horror has changed over the years to a much faster, get to the kill, point. My generation wouldn't really know of this kind of genre to be entertaining. But if you look at some greats like, When a stranger calls (being of the opposite pace) you meet the character, you see her routine, and you become involved in her life, leaving you ultimately, emotionally attached. The house of the devil just led you on soooooo long that when the end came you really didn't care anymore what was going on in that house or what was going to happen to the character.

Let me break this film down for you. First 40 min, you get to know the character. Another 30 min in you figure out what's going to happen, the last 20 min, all hell breaks loose in a very predictable manor.

The end, well, i'll let you see for yourself.

I would say, see this movie, it is just not for everyone. If you grew up with Freddy, Jason, and Michael, this movie is for you. If you grew up with Sydney Prescott, SKIP IT. You will be bored.

It appears the director has spent a fair amount of time, trolling through old vhs labels like EMBASSY and VESTRON for early 80's horror movies. You know, the real stuff, back when there were  ""indie-movies"".
So, you shouldn't expect any more from this other then pure style, a nod to the naive, simpler days of  horror movies.

As in the film V/H/S, the motives of the ""BadGuy"" here are never really explained. There is no social relevance, and it is devoid of any theme or concept other then horror movies.

It's clear that the script lacks real story and serves only for the director to showcase his own fetish for horror movies, you know just the cool moments.

Like old movies, the set-up is slow and boring, meant to build tension, but in the end, we feel taken. Why so long negotiating when the ""bad guy, he  is insane, willing do anything, moves about without fear of being caught, has no motive, and could of easily just taken the girl at anytime.

Slasher films and torture porn do nothing for me.  I liked to be spooked, creeped out, given the willies...you know, SCARED.  I LOVE atmosphere, and to me it is what truly makes a film frightening.  I bought this when it came out and thought I was suffering from over saturation because I really didn't see what all the fuss was about.  Turns out, three years later it isn't any better than I remember.

While it's heart is (very very much) in the right place, HOTD doesn't deliver.  I wasn't creeped, nervous, scared, anxious at all.  Not once.  Now this is one of those flicks were people will cry ""You just don't get it!  You need violence and gore and therefore your opinion doesn't matter.""...hogwash.  Like I said I don't dig slasher flicks.  Pacing is a huge issue with this film.  The scares are just too far apart.  As far as atmosphere goes (which would carry the slow parts), HOTD simply doesn't have any.  The filmmakers put all the ingredients together, but forgot to stir.  The house looks like its supposed to, but lacks any personality at all.  The sets are dead and boring.  Acting was a bit overdone.  I can feel them trying to act in a deliberate way to make it seem more like a cheesy old 80s film and it fails.  These factors stacked on top of a really uninteresting plot just don't add up to a good film.

House of the Devil is not the worst film, but it isn't really anything special.  The whole thing seems like a whole lot of effort to make a really generic uninteresting throwback.",1381017600,3,1665,4.425742574257426
3963416,5,B002OVO18A,"Director Ti West brings a horror flick shot on film in the style of 70's/80's horror that DOESN'T rely on cheap and predictable jump scares and unlikeable characters, but rather atmosphere, tension, and creepy cinematography with a touch of dark humor. Something you may notice about many of Ti West's films is that he relies heavily on tension and build up, having the first half often set up the characters and story, with many times little if any action going on, until the final segment of the story in which the horror and action jumps out into an exciting and suspenseful climax. Now personally speaking, I am a fan of Ti West, but I don't think this method has always worked for him. Although I did overall enjoy ""V/H/S"", I was disappointed with Mr. West's segment and this method of building everything up to the last part of the story didn't work very well in my opinion. However, A somewhat similar method can be seen in ""The Innkeepers"", which I think did it much better than in ""V/H/S"". But I think ""House of the Devil"" does this method the best out of those three of his films, with it's music, cinematography, and little moments of horror throughout the movie that don't give a whole lot, but just a little taste of what is to come in the climax. One thing that is very obvious is that Ti West loves horror, and ""House of the Devil"" shows that heavily. I highly recommend it to any fan of classic horror who loves build up and mystery.",1376265600,,1449,4.492424242424242

The acting is first rate and Jocelin Donahue is a joy to watch as the unsuspecting babysitter who is terrified in the big creepy house...i just don't want to give anything away as it's just refreshing to see a movie like this which relies upon a slow build with jarring act's of terror and jumps. Tom Noonan and Mary Woronov make appearances both of which i am a fan of and it's really nice to see them adding to the tense atmosphere. Ti West is a director to watch for sure and he has done a great job recreating the feel of a 70's movie down to the grainy look,the music and the general style to which it was shot......check out those open credits....wow.

3963420,4,B002OVO18A,"The house of the Devil is ultimately a reasonable tribute to the moody satanic horror stories of the 70s and 80s. Its well made and has the feel of those classic slower horror films of the period. The acting is reasonable as well. The problem is that the film moves extremely slow nearly the entire way through. The mood is mildly hypnotic and sort of keeps you holding on for a payoff, which in the last 10 minutes of the film you do indeed get. The last 10 minutes is solid and scary stuff in the tradition of Rosemarys baby. Things move at a snails pace up unitl the end for the exception of one killing that sort of takes you by suprise. One extremely redeeming quality the film has is the presence of veteran actor Tom Noonan who adds to the creepy mood. From the moment you meet his character you know the guy is up to no good, but at the same time you feel he might be a little weird but a decent man. Noonan was the perfect choice to play this character. Some of you might remember Noonan from Michael Manns film Manhunter, the original film based on Thomas Harriss book Silence of the Lambs, which came before the 1991 Best Picture starring Jodie Foster. In Manhunter Noonan played the killer known as The tooth ferry. Noonan was extremely creepy in that film and hes very similar here. This movie owes a lot to Noonan who helps set the mood and tension for the first 70 minutes of the film which can be rather slow. Noonan saved this film putting it bluntly. The end was worth the wait though.",1367884800,,1503,4.3144876325088335

3963424,5,B002OVO18A,"SPOILER ALERT. This is a great film! A real surprise! A young college co-ed is brought to a house under false pretences. There is an add for a babysitter. She reallllllly needs cash to pay for an apartment. She calls the number on the add. Her best friend agrees to drive her to the house and leave her there. When she arrives at the house the man tells her it is actually for his mother in law, not a child. He tells the co-ed that the mother in law will not come downstairs and that she should not go upstairs to bother her. And it just so happens that the amount of money he is willing to pay is just what she needs for the apartment. So, against her better judgement she agrees and the friend leaves. While the girl is calling for pizza, breaking vases and exploring the house, the plot begins to thicken. The best friend is murdered and the ""pizza boy"" that she called is just their son making pizza to deliver to their sitter (soon to be victim). As it turns out the family is a cult and, big surprise, they worship the devil. The co-ed is their sacrificial lamb. Does she die? Does she escape? Does she kill the whole family? You should watch it to find out. Love this movie. Although there are many parts that are pretictable for any horror movie addict, like myself, It is quickly becoming one of my favorites. LOVE IT.

This movie is a masterpiece of horror cinema and it shines on Blu-Ray, no DNR, great detail, blacks look deep and although there is some muddy soft edges throughout, I can only assume director Ti West was going for this look when trying to make this harken back to early '80's horror. This really is an instant classic in a world of unoriginal horror films made with shaky hand held cameras and generic slasher flicks. If you like classic horror films, the '80's, and originals like The Exorcist and Texas Chainsaw Massacre (even though the only things these movie have in common is setting a high standard for horror films and awesome cinematography and musical scores) then you should really like this movie.

Her sidekick is played by Greta Gerwig in an equally phenomenal performance, the embodiment of the slightly annoying bff. In my opinion, though, AJ Bowen takes the cake. the scene with him and Greta Gerwig comes out of nowhere. He has one of those faces where you almost feel like maybe you know him. He's likable.

I don't need a constant body count or blood or guts to keep me entertained.  However, I need SOMETHING to happen.  It's a shame, too, because the 80s vibe, the casting and the directing were great.  But they are wasted on this weak script with absolutely NOTHING happening for a good 30 minutes.  I actually started falling asleep and that NEVER happens.  The ending is okay, and I dig the retro vibe and the obvious nods to ""Black Christmas"" but that film actually had something going on.  This movie has a girl snooping through a house and finding almost nothing, dancing around to bad 80s music, calling her friend 4 times and getting her machine (yes, we hear all 4 rings all 4 times) and getting gradually paranoid.  There is no method to the madness.

This is the second time I have almost been put to sleep by a Ti West film, but it will definitely be the last.  The first time was ""The Innkeepers"" which was another complete snoozefest that was critically applauded for some reason but had NO action at all.

3963432,4,B002OVO18A,"While a film set in the 1980s may not be distant enough in the past to be labeled as a period piece, regardless, ""The House of the Devil"" might be the first. The film-making techniques, costumes, ambiance, etc. are perfect mimics to 1980s horror films, and the satanic implications also connect with the hoaxes and hysteria in 1980s America. The film centers on Samantha Hughes (Jocelin Donahue), a bright college student who is in need of some work to help pay her bills. She seeks babysitting work or the like and answers a flyer requesting help for a babysitter. The strange thing is that no one answers as she calls from a pay phone but, after hanging up, the pay phone rings. A man offers her work and a ride but he oddly never show up to meet Samantha. Her roommmate later receives a message from this man and she returns the call. He apologizes and offers generous pay for one night of work. Her friend, Megan (Greta Gerwig), gives Samantha a ride out to this grand house in the countryside. Samantha meets  the homeowner, Mr. Ulman (Tom Noonan), who is soft-spoken but somehow off-putting. Samantha learns that this is not a babysitting gig but a chance to watch over his mother who lives in the attic. She hesitates but agrees to the deal when he increases the pay. On this autumn night, things get mysterious, creepy and potentially dangerous as Samantha becomes paranoid from weird happenings, Megan's absence and a pizza deliverer who acts very strangely. The mystery of the house is slowly revealed as the night goes on.

This was a movie reminiscent of an old time ghost story or urban legend. Writer/director/editor Ti West creates a believable and earnest exposition for the film to launch from and the quiet suspense and tension makes it creepy, uneasy, if not scary, to watch. Certainly the title gives a clue to what is happening and nothing truly groundbreaking is introduced to the genre here, but much credit goes to West for making a quality horror movie here with an old school look, feel and process to it. While watching ""The House of the Devil,"" I would have easily have guessed this film was made in 1987 if I had not known otherwise. The acting is solid throughout, although none of the roles are that meaty. Still, at least none of the characters are ridiculously stupid or foolish as they so often are in horror movies. Ti West has made a few horror films now including a segment in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/V-H-S/dp/B00944CS3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">V/H/S</a>, I think he is a name to watch for now on.

The premise is simple, the climax is predictable and the suspense is standard fare... but it works incredibly well.

As you can see, I find this film to be of pretty high quality. My number system is slightly skewed to benefit films that have been around longer... and that seems natural because you want films to be able to stand the test of time before you hand them a crazy rating.

This film is very, very, very moody. The gloomy, oppressive feelings come from the story telling. You have the idea of a lunar eclipse and the atmosphere within the film is quite dark. The characters come across as very honest and it seems obvious to me that the actors believed in the story. I simply love Tom Noonan in this one!

The satanic cult is a new twist on the classic babysitter slasher motif. The idea is tragic and you really get a sense of hurt and distress for the victim!

There have been a LOT of American horror movies dealing with the ""devil"" subgenre lately, and each one has been pretty terrible.  This movie is a clear exception to that trend.  Yes, it starts out slow, but the suspense is almost palpable. Don't listen to those comparing it to ""Rosemary's Baby"" or ""The Exorcist,"" both of which are in a completely different realm.  The set design and, yes, even the music are very reminiscent of the 1980s. This isn't a masterpiece like ""The Exorcist,"" but it is very much worth watching.  For fans of the classic, suspensful, and....wait for it..wait...ATMOSPHERIC... 1980s horror, this is a must-see!!!

I know there are the usual people who would turn down a movie upon seeing the word ""atmospheric"" in a review.  But, fortunately there are plenty of blood-soaked Wes Craven and John Carpenter films to satiate them.",1332374400,,921,4.858974358974359

But enough about my qualifications. I watched this movie because a.) the devil of course and b.) NPR recommended it (yes, strange bedfellows.) On the plus side, it certainly has the period details of the early 80's lovingly correct: the clothes, the giant Walkman, even the overly intrusive score, cinematography and opening credits sequence.

But for most of the movie, there's just not a lot happening and rather than building suspense, it just made me shift in my seat and look at my watch approximately 666 times. Some of the plot points (stinky-looking Satanist who lives in the woods and makes inedible pizza) were enjoyably ridiculous and I'm about 80% sure this was intentional. Also, there are great campy performances from Tom Noonan and the divine Mary Woronov. On the whole though, too much dead air to even recommend on a camp level in my opinion.

It is somewhat slow throughout the movie.  There was alot of lurking...then some searching...then more lurking.
I could have done without watching the girl dance around the house listening to pop music on her tape player.
The cast is small so it is pretty easy to predict what will happen/who will die.
The main ""demon"" woman looks funky and not really scary..but more awkward almost comical.
The babysitter seemed rather stupid.  She chose to stay even with all the ""warning signs"" given to her?  I understand that if she had left there wouldn't have been a movie but the ""warning signs"" could have at least been more subtle.

There isn't alot of gore or nudity which was somewhat refreshing.  The atmosphere was creepy (but use of the same atmosphere gets a bit old after a while).  I enjoyed the light/shadow used to create the initial creepy atmosphere.

3963450,5,B002OVO18A,"Look, I'm getting tired of reading all of the complaints by the ADD-riddled minds of this generation. This film is slow-paced. This film is not heavy on gore, but on mood and atmosphere. If you're looking for a fast-paced thrill ride, look elsewhere, and the rest of us will have all the fun without you.

Now that I have that out of the way, I can tell you that The House of the Devil is one of the best feature debuts that I have ever seen. I've heard reviewers compare this film to the early work of Polanski, and that seems pretty spot on to me. If you took the isolation of Repulsion and the satanic horror of Rosemary's Baby, put them in a blender and poured out the contents, you'd probably get something like this film.

The story tells of a young college student who is in need of some quick cash, so she ends up housesitting for an extremely sketchy old couple in a big, creepy house in the middle of nowhere. As the night progresses, she begins to realize that everything is not what it seems, and that she may be in real danger. However, the film does not arrive at this conclusion quickly. Ti West lets the sense of dread build for a good solid hour of the running time -- this does not detract from the film, but only adds to the creep factor. The film has a very retro-80s feel that I really enjoyed - sort of like ""Grindhouse"", but less extreme -- but this never distracts or overwhelms the film. You'll never forget the last fifteen minutes!

Overall, excellent horror debut from a promising director, not for the squeamish or impatient -- but for everyone else, HIGHLY recommended!",1330473600,3,1599,4.4135593220338984

I enjoy suspense as much as the next guy, but 70 minutes of waiting for something to happen is NOT SUSPENSEFUL! Obviously something bad is going to happen; it's a HORROR FILM.  So where is the suspense in watching a young woman worry about money and walk around a house for over an hour?  Maybe I just went in with too high expectations, but aside from some enjoyable acting (Tom Noonan is always fantastic, and the young lead is very believable as well) and ten scary minutes near the end, it was a complete wash.  A lot of wasted film with barely any payoff at all.

I will not cover the plot here.  All I wanted to comment on is the style of the film.  Even though it is a recently made film (2010), it is filmed as though it takes place in the 70's (no cell phones, station wagon cars, 70's hairstyles etc, bell bottom jeans, etc.)  I thought this was really an artistic and clever touch of filmmaking.

So it 'looks' like a 70's horror film, and the style of filming is the same as well.  The plot is a little slow at the beginning, as the suspense slowly builds, and the layers get peeled back one by one.

3963457,4,B002OVO18A,"The House of the Devil is a seriously good film. Although I'd argue that the film is less horror than it is suspense, I think the horror works better because of the slow and creepy build-up before any blood is spilled. It's really the atmosphere of dread that kept me hooked. The movie doesn't feel tricky or gimmicky, everything felt genuinely creepy and there wasn't a moment when I wasn't wondering where the film was going to take me next.

This is not to say the movie is perfect. The third act felt really short and underwhelming compared to the strong first half. The final act, while still interesting, doesn't payoff on the promise of the earlier scenes. At least not in terms of milking tension as effectively.  The final ""reveal"" is a great concept in an awesomely ambiguous way but the rushed final act leading up to that point should have been more dramatically protracted.

I still recommend this movie whole-heartedly because the atmosphere and mood is some of the best I've seen in a long while.

In Ty West's ""The House of the Devil,"" a young co-ed (Jocelin Donahue), hard-up for money to pay the rent on her new place off campus, answers an ad for a babysitting job way out in the boonies, only to be plunged headlong into a bizarre devil-worshipping cult  in search of a sacrificial victim.

Set in the 1980s - in a time before cell phones gave us at least the illusion of connectedness and security - this refreshingly unadorned and unembellished thriller does something rather unique with its structure (possibly a necessity brought on by its extremely low budget).  The story comes to such a slow boil that the stretched-out tension becomes almost unbearable to sit through, greatly enhancing the atmosphere of dread.

Unfortunately, diehard slasher movie fans may be disappointed by the rather rushed, truncated and anticlimactic nature of the final scenes, in which our heroine finds herself being held captive by some of the most feckless and least competent kidnappers in horror movie history.

Still, the suspenseful buildup is more than compensation for the half-baked and halfhearted resolution that follows.",1303430400,2,1132,5.158469945355192
3963459,5,B002OVO18A,"I'd like to go on record and say that if all of Ti West's films end up as The House of the Devil does he may very well become one of the best horror directors and writers of our generation. I can't help but stress at length how much I love this film. He was able to film this to make it feel like a late 70's to early 80's horror film. From the look of the film, clothing, dialogue, props, everything makes you feel like you are watching one of the horror films of days gone by. I do have to stress though that the first hour of this movie is build up and not much happens. If you are a gore or action hound you might be put off by the long introduction. In the style of the movie though it works and it does end in a bang.

The film opens as Samantha (Jocelin Donahue) has found a new building to live to avoid her roommate who is too into both partying and sex for her taste. Samantha just wants to have some peace and quiet while she's doing her studies and isn't able to in her current living arrangement. The problem? She is a little light on money to be able to make the initial rent. To cover this she looks for side work to help pad her wallet a little.

She is soon able to find a babysitting job that is supposed to pay well. An older couple, the Ulman's, need someone to watch the house and Mr. Ulman's mother for them. While Samantha originally believes she is going to be taking care of a child, enough money is thrown at her to ignore her qualms and take the job. Her friend that gave her a ride leaves and soon after the Ulman's do as well. After this happens the buildup slowly raises. While we quickly discover things aren't as they seem - Samantha has no idea anything is wrong until it's too late and the action kicks in. Once it does Samantha learns that she was setup from nearly the beginning.

Movies where the end are what make them can be hard to write about. I want to rant on where this goes but the journey and destination are equally enjoyable. The problem with really explaining where the movie is going though is ruining the surprise of it. It's so rare that such a perfectly done horror movie comes out that to ruin it would be doing it a disservice.

This is shot to match the style of 70's horror that has a huge build up of characters, suspense, and just setting the right mood for something to attempt to creep you out. What really stands out though is that this was both (for the most part) more believable than any movie similar to it done in the past. I was consistantly struck by how amazingly well this was put together and can't stress enough that if you enjoy build up, suspense, and a little throwback in your horror that you need to pick this up immediately. I am not a person to give a perfect review to a movie on a regular basis. This one has easily become one of my top 10 horror movie favorites.",1301875200,5,2845,4.139240506329114

It did capture the feel of an 70's or early 80's movie quite nicely but nothing happens in the first hour except for one girl getting her brains blown out by some drifter looking loser guy. The main problem with this movie is that the main character is as fidgety as a field mouse through the whole movie so it's almost a relief when she shoots herself in the head at the end of the movie. I'm sorry if I spoiled it for anybody who hasn't seen it yet but this movie is not as great as a lot of these other reviewers say. Rent is if you still want to see it.

It has been intimated, ""Babysitter Wanted"", not a bad film in itself but this movie is superior! The Actresses Not only look like they are in the 80's but act like it and astonishingly recapture it! The innocence is there, the naivety, the fun loving spirit put in peril without expecting it! Rob Zombie, may have as well as a few others resurrected the horror genre with, ""House of a thousand corpses"", and other films before touched on like, ""The silence of the Lambs"", witch inspired all of horror film making today, but Those films derived form Tobe Hooper's, ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"",unlike that film, inspired by the 70's (Witch are now making a comeback, Big Time!)

3963462,2,B002OVO18A,"Man I was quite disappointed after viewing Ti West's film The House of the Devil. I was under the impression that it was a cut above most small budget indie films. I guess it all depends on ones view of what suspense is .I thought that this plodding film was a total bore. I was dismayed at the fact that in the first hour of a 95 minute film there was 1 murder. That was it as far as action went 1 girl killed. You don't need an all out splatter fest to have a good horror movie. Kubrick's Shinning has only the killing of Scatman Crother's by ""Johnny"" in the first 90 minutes but it's a taut suspenseful movie. House of the Devil is basically watching Sarah(Jocelin Donahue) wander around a scary old house .She's hired to ""babysit"" an elderly woman by an eccentric couple played by veteran actors Tom Noonan and Mary Woronov. Being a cash strapped college student looking to rent a nice apartment from a nearby landlady(hey it's Dee Wallace) she takes the gig despite warnings from her best friend Megan (Greta Gerwig),If the film was a scary as they wanted it to be more things would happen in it. The phone actually worked unlike in 90% of most horror films. There were no real tell tale signs that something was amiss either. No blood dripping out of the faucet or creaky stair noises or mysterious voices or disappering ghosts. Ordering a pizza and having it delivered by the couples deranged son was about the extent of what went on in the house. Sarah approached a room where we the audience saw dead bodies on a pentagram(ah so something is evil here ) but she never opens the door. Oh we did see Sarah break a vase(that's coming out of her pay) and dance around to the Fixx's song ""one Thing"".By the way the film was set in the 80's and looked like a reasonable take on the era. The rotary phone was a bit over the top but at least Sarah dialed 7 digits every time. And what was West's obsession with Donahue's butt? Most of the film was shot from the rear in a POV manner. We follow Sarah as she wanders around the house .But West's camera shoots mainly from the feet to the shoulders. So the end result is we see Donahue's cute butt in tight jeans every time. Next time he may want to vary the angle that he's shooting from. Looking from behind Sarah all the time was getting old. And really until she's drugged and tied died by satanists there's nothing to actually see no matter what angle it was shot at. The acting was decent Donahue looks a bit like a cross between a young Sissy Spacek and a young Debra Winger. The veteran actors collect a pay check and we all wish that more action happens.

When I *did* see it, I was overjoyed to find it was exactly what I'd wanted it to be. It's definitely slow-paced, which I understand a lot of viewers found to be a turn-off, but I thought it made it far scarier. The movie allowed itself space to breathe. The ending IS abrupt and doesn't really fit the rest of the film, but the rest of the movie was so enjoyable and spine-tingling (seriously, I think I watched most of the movie with goosebumps) it didn't really matter.
  I will add, and this probably makes a huge difference in my review, I don't really like horror movies. I don't watch them often because I scare easily. This might ultimately affect my judgment/opinion in several ways, but my thoughts still stand!
  The best part about this movie is that it's a GREAT period piece. The hair, the make-up, the clothes, the props, the decor, the technology, the cars, the title sequences, the music...it's all there! So I think an argument could be made that the plot/genre is actually secondary to the fact that it's a period movie. Like, if someone wanted to accurately make a period movie about the 90s, they might make a stoner comedy. That sort of thing.

If you are looking for the much needed reinvention of the horror movie genre -- this is not the movie you are hoping it to be. The beginning of this film is very stylized and makes one think they are about to witness some great movie making. NOt so.

This would be welcomed if all that slow build up was leading up to something truly terrifying. Unfortunately, The House of the Devil doesn't deliver.  The last few minutes is like a different, very badly made home horror movie. Much of it so dark and murky that it's hard to tell what is going on. It feels like the director had no budget left, or even a finished script and everyone involved made up the end as they filmed just to finish.

After an hour, I really started to think, something has to happen soon!  Once I watched 85% of the movie and NOTHING happened, I honestly started to fast forward the DVD.  Up to this point, she is asked by a soft spoken boring man to watch an elderly woman that she is told that she will ""probably never see"".

The house is dark and there is ominous music playing throughout the film...  I'm scared...  Once in a while, you will hear a little sound, but nothing that's alarming.  Frightening...  Like I said, 85% of the movie is what I just described.  There is literally 10 - 15 minutes of action (which could have been MUCH better) at the end and the movie concludes with a predictable and clich ending.  If you are going to make people scotch tape their eyelids open to get through this painfully lame movie, at least make the freaking ending worth the viewer's time and effort!!!  Think about this once you finish the movie.  If I muted the TV and watched this movie until the last 15 minutes of the movie, would I be scared in the least bit?

It wasn't overly-exaggerated or cheesy like other movies that are supposed to take place during that time.  It was kind of like watching an episode of ""Tales from the Darkside"".  This is far from being the worst movie however, it dragged a little for me.  Even though the movie was less than 90 minutes long, it felt like I was watching for hours.  It seemed to take forever for the main character to actually get to the house.  And it took even longer for something to happen once she was there.  Don't get me wrong, the film has some edge of your seat moments and I was in no way expecting a gore fest.  The performances were solid especially from Tom Noonan and Mary Woronov playing the eccentric couple.  The movie had a good premise, but there is no payoff in the end.

This is the classic baby-sitter in the creepy old mystery house in the middle of nowhere plot with a dash of Satanic worship thrown in. There was a lot that happened in this film, but nearly all of it happened off-screen prior to the start. Unfortunately we are never told any of the backstory, which seemed to be much more interesting than the real story. I love movies that build to a crescendo so the slow pace didn't bother me at first. What did bother me was that there was no plot at all. None. Zip. No character development, no introspection, and almost no dialogue. Not even at the end do we find out who the antagonists were, what they were trying to accomplish, or why they had to go to such incredible lengths to do it. I can't say this is the worst film I've ever seen, but it is probably one of the most boring. All in all, I want my $5.00 and 90 minutes back. Both were wasted.",1286668800,7,1182,4.143478260869565

Time and time again I see great titles with low ratings, and very bad films with high ratings.  After all There would not be three Mummy films (or Pirate films and on and on) if the masses didn't like bad films.  There should be some criteria that you have to meet first before your able to review a film.  One reviewer for this film didn't even know what films Ti West was paying homage to!  Seriously!

Every one deserves an opinoin, but I have a feeling most of these reviewers are either very young with little film viewing experience, or just have very little film viewing experience.  I understand if you liked the majority of the film, but just didn't like the ending.  I'm not sure what you were expecting, but at least I can respect that.  But calling a film slow just because it doesn't use quick editing, loud music, and cheap jump scares is just clueless. It's called building suspense, and most movies don't do it any more.  They settle for cheap jump scares instead.  It's such a shame.  Most of Hollywood thinks the masses are dumb.  If they put a big star in a film (or CG robots)it doesn't matter how dumb the script is because the masses will still run out and see it.  The sad part is the ticket buyer don't even realize Hollywood is insulting them right in front of their faces.  Not all films to come out of Hollywood are like this, but a lot are.

This is a great film from the first second to the last.  I have not been a huge Ti West fan, but this film changes that.  Roost wasn't very good. Trigger Man wasn't half as good as the spanish film King of the Hill.  I'm very anxious to see his next outting (Cabin Fever 2 was disowned by Mr. West when he lost control of editing) to see if he has truly become a master director as this film indicates, or if it was just a fluke.  Either way there is no denying that The House of the Devil is a masterpiece.  If you don't get why, go watch a few hundred more films from each decade.",1283212800,4,2055,4.217948717948718

The movie does an excellent job of building up your tension and there are very chilling scenes, that make you wonder what sort of nasty sinister event is going on.

Jocelin Donahue does an excellent job portraying a naive young college student ( Samantha ) who thinks she has scored a great job for the night by negotiating a very high-paying babysitting job for herself to care for an elderly woman for one evening.  The couple, whose ""elderly mother"" she babysits for are suspicious, eerie, weird people. And the house is an old isolated victorian manor with lots of creaky old floorboards and claustrophobic rooms and twisting stairways. Samantha's best friend, who drove her out to this job, and then left... mysteriously will not answer her phone regardless of Samantha's repeated attempts to reach her.  The movie builds up, and builds up, and you really expect some powerful slam-bang ending, and it just falls TOTALLY flat on its face.  For all it's potential..., for all that it COULD have been, it ends up being a very poor rip-off of another movie.., Rosemary's Baby.

Genre: Horror | Thriller
Tagline: Talk on the phone. Finish your homework. Watch T.V. DIE!
Plot: In the 1980s, college student Samantha Hughes takes a strange babysitting job that coincides with a full lunar eclipse. She slowly realizes her clients harbor a terrifying secret; they plan to use her in a satanic ritual.

Not much can be said for the director of Cabin Fever 2, let it be known, I did not expect much, this film followed my expectations almost perfectly.

I must admit, the depth in which character detail was delved into was amazing, you really get a feel for who these characters are, however character detail does not the movie make.

At many times in the movie, the pace is just entirely too slow. At one point, you follow the lead female role around, as she goes from each room of the house, this took about 45 minutes alone. As a matter of fact, for more than 80% of the movie, you follow her around, which very little twists or turns. It's not till the last 15 minutes, that the movie actually gets intense, with some rather disturbing imagery.

As far as horror goes, if you're into gore/violence, this movie is not for you. If you're willing to go nearly an entire movie with very little action, and you enjoy rather in depth analysis's of characters and motives, then this movie might possibly peak your interest. I however, enjoy the old sense of hacker/slasher movies, and I did not receive what I was looking for.

While the slow build was a signature style of the 80s, it wasn't as slow as this.  Luckily, I rented the DVD and ultimately skipped ahead after waiting about an hour for ANYTHING to happen.  This film doesn't build suspense so much as it pretty much kills it entirely.  While the retro 80s feel may seem terribly clever by its creators, this film gives classic 80s horror a bad name (though the style of the film leads me to believe the director confused the 70s with the 80s).  The cheesy schlock is there, but the pacing and direction are all wrong.  It's dull and predictable; the antithesis of suspense.  I can only imagine the film is entertaining to those believing they are watching a loving tribute to 80s horror films, but only if they have never actually seen any good 80s horror films.  After reading reviews of Ti West's Cabin Fever 2 and Trigger Man, I think it would be wise to add him to my list of directors to avoid.",1280102400,3,1064,4.420512820512821
3963479,4,B002OVO18A,"Its title may make it sound like a low-grade would-be shocker, but writer-director Ti West's ""The House of the Devil"" marks itself from the beginning as an ideal horror movie for those who are unimpressed by contrived shocks or gratuitous gore but would like to see a film with somewhat believable situations and characters who (mostly) talk and act like real people.  It's a rare attempt to take a decidedly sensationalistic subject and approach it in a naturalistic, relatively believable way (granted, ""The Omen"" took a somewhat similar tack about 35 years ago, but, well, this movie does it better), and West's efficient script and assured direction are enough to further distinguish this movie from the competition.  The title and the opening graphics about Satanic cults leave little doubt as to what's coming, but the movie takes its time in revealing the particulars, and does so with a minimum of clunky exposition or backstory (it's not even clear until the very end whether there was any actual supernatural involvement in the film's events).  In place of the all-too-common horror-movie trope of obnoxious dolts being picked off one at a time, viewers get a story that, at least until all hell breaks loose in the final act, should actually be pretty relatable for anyone who's ever been young and trapped in a hellish living situation with little means of escape.

Jocelin Donahue makes for a refreshingly normal horror-film protagonist as Samantha, a cute, vaguely tomboyish college sophomore desperate for some quick cash so she can escape from her oversexed roommate and rent her own apartment.  A seemingly perfect opportunity arises in the form of a lucrative babysitting gig for the Ullmans, a couple seemingly eager to get out of the house to view the upcoming lunar eclipse, but as is so often the case in horror movies the job isn't what it seems.  For one thing, her prospective employers turn out to be the epitome of creepiness, led by Tom Noonan as the imposing, secretive Mr. Ullman.  Those who saw Noonan as the bizarre detective on the last two seasons of ""Damages"" will be familiar with his erratic movements and irregular speech patterns, and here they're combined with a patchy beard and ominous-looking cane to produce a character who manages to be frightening without doing much of anything.  And Noonan's character may as well be Mr. Rogers compared to his wife (Mary Woronov), whose brief appearance in the early going is marked by an imperious stare and a demeanor creepy enough to send a less cash-strapped babysitter running for the hills.  In the end, Noonan and Woronov both strike a near-perfect balance in their roles--they're spooky enough that viewers in on the story will know there's something up with them, but not so overtly menacing as to make it implausible that Samantha could believe they were merely weird rather than truly nefarious.

Once Samantha inevitably takes the job after some tough negotiations over the price, the movie settles in for an extended stretch devoted more to establishing an eerie atmosphere than to delivering any real scares (with one brief but very notable exception).  While some will surely be bored by a middle section that consists largely of Samantha walking (and in one memorable scene, dancing) around the Ullmans' apparently empty dwelling, West does an admirable job of steadily ratcheting up the tension while capturing the inherent scariness of being alone in a spacious, isolated house.  The movie does surrender a good deal of its carefully constructed air of mystery with its frenzied, nightmarish climax, but the conclusion is still made all the more effective by the slow buildup preceding it.  Suitably, the violence is employed sparingly and almost entirely in the final 15 minutes, with what bloodshed does occur presented in a blunt, unflinching manner that goes well with West's overall minimalist approach.

Given the endless barrage of stupid-looking horror flicks landing in theaters, it's a shame this one didn't make much impact at the box office, but viewers who like their scares delivered intelligently should be sure to check it out.  At about 90 minutes it doesn't stick around anywhere near long enough to get boring, and still manages to take its time getting its pieces in place before everything goes to hell (no pun intended).  The typical pitfalls of horror cinema--cheap effects, flat characters, brainless dialogue, direction that treats subtlety as an unpardonable crime--are all very little in evidence here, making ""The House of the Devil"" the rare horror film that should appeal to both enthusiasts of the genre and those who typically avoid it.  Injecting a measure of realism into the devil-movie template may seem like a thankless task, but fortunately West and co. turn out to be more than up to it.",1279065600,2,4826,5.050314465408805

3963485,1,B002OVO18A,"I can't say if this movie is ""good"" or ""bad"" but I can give my opinion. Bear that in mind if you want to read this.

I watched ""House of the Devil"" and I didn't like it. I asked myself some of the questions that I've seen the defenders of this movie use against reviewers who don't like it.

Is it because it's a ""slow burn""?
No, I'm a big fan of 1970s ""slow burn"" movies; ""Let's Scare Jessica To Death"" qualifies in that category and it's one of my favorite horror movies.

Is it because I just don't ""get"" it?
It's a pretty simple story, so there isn't a lot to ""get"", and I understand minimalism when it's used for effect, so I don't think I missed anything. I'm not going to read my version of the director's intent into the movie to justify it to myself or anyone else, though.

Yes, the film DOES capture the look of the early 80s, but that's simply reducing history to a template for fashion and style and isn't the same thing as creating mood or atmosphere. Long stretches of mundane tedium isn't the same thing as creating tension, either.

I never learned anything more about the main character than what's in the premise set-up during the entire runtime. The story itself is never fleshed out enough to qualify as more than a premise set-up. That might work in a short film under twenty minutes, but it left a lot to be desired in a ninety minute horror movie.

With all the padding where nothing happens, there's plenty of room for something other than just waiting for something to happen. Watching this movie, I felt like I was being slowly embalmed while alive, and by the end of the movie when something finally happened, I was numb beyond caring.

Bottom line? I didn't like ""House of the Devil"" because it bored me. Between the premise set-up in the first ten minutes and the pay-off in the last ten minutes there was nothing to hold my interest.",1275523200,17,1864,4.401162790697675

The backdrop of the 1980's is clearly identified down to the music of the time and the portable cassette players.  There are some moments which make you jump off your seat and the demon is wicked looking, however, it does show class, as it does not have the sterotypical sataic type orgy and nudity.

I also liked that it was set in the eighties, but they didn't beat you over the head with it. Too often in a period piece, the makers try and cram every single detail and fad from the time into the story. Here you get some gigantic Walkmans, feathered hair and a few other details. It was nice to see the Satanic Panic scare of the eighties (when even Oprah had people on saying outrageous, unbelievable things about Satanism and ritual murders in suburbia) used as the basis of a horror flick.

The main girl reminded me an awful lot of Margot Kidder in the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Christmas/dp/B000IMUYJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Christmas</a>, which was nice even if it was unintentional.

On the downside, it maybe moved a little too slowly in the beginning. Once things ratchet up, you will be hooked. But have some patience. You'll need it.

Also, even though they did a good job on suspense, I never really understood what set the main character off. She finds a picture and we as viewers know what it means, but she wouldn't have. She freaks out anyway.

Jocelin Donahue plays Samantha, a financially struggling college student in this 1980s style horror film. Enter Tom Noonan and Mary Woronov (Mr and Mrs Ullman) who desperately need her. Tom Ulman falsely advertises he's looking for a babysitter - where in fact it's his mother that needs babysitting and for her to stay the night. Because she needs the money she accepts, nevermind that these people are creepy. I cant speak for everyone but a creepy set of people wouldnt convince me to stay the night. Her friend was right about getting out there.
So for a good 40 minutes of the film, she roams the house to check the rooms, perhaps a little bit too curious...things slowly start to happen & the film gets creepier and creepier. There is a lot of suspense as the music is really creepy as she walks from room to room, and suddenly starts to hear noises. That was a great part of the film, that tension of something coming out and scaring you. Of course the big payoff is the family is a bunch of devil messengers that need some kind of sacrifice. It could have a been a sacrifice or an impregnation, either way it wasn't pleasant whatever they wanted. The last 15 minutes are the most suspenseful and there is some moderate gore. It may be too strong for some, but for gore lovers this should deliver. I did find it too disturbing & wasn't pleased with how such a beautiful girl (Donahue) winds up. I liked her character in some areas as she seems mature & intelligent and suddenly she's acting a little too naive in terms of her curiosity, dancing around this house among other things.
I liked it, but for me it wasn't a keeper, but certainly worth checking out. Personally speaking Ive gotten past the disturbing movie phase, but now Im a Jocelin Donahue fan if nothing else...
Some people will say it was boring for the first hour, but it really depends on if you like the characters, & if you get into the story as it develops within the house. For me it worked.

3963495,3,B002OVO18A,"A horror film which is set in the 80's, so you have rotary phones, Walkman's, cassette tapes and acid washed jeans  is based on true events about Satan worshipers.
A college student Samantha Hughes (Jocelin Donahue) needs cash to move in to a new apartment because she is fed up of living in the dorm. She has to come up for the first month's rent in a few days. So she takes up a job offer as a baby sitter in a far away house on a night of a full lunar eclipse. When she reaches her assignment, she is told that the baby sitting is actually for a old woman and she is enticed with 400 dollars for the 4 hour assignment. But things start to happen as soon as the owners leave the house leaving Samantha alone in the house.
The action and horror happen in the last half hour but the entire movie is devoted to creating tension and introducing the development of the very few characters. Blood and gore are minimal and are restricted to the last 12 or 14 minutes with a twisted ending. If you like slow paced horror movies where plot development is critical instead of special effects laden gore and body parts. This would be a good rental.

It's pretty obvious that there's trouble coming for Ms. Donahue, but the creepyness that builds as the babysitter roams the dark mansion is great fun. I've seen other reviews mention ""Let's Scare Jessica to Death"" for comparison, and I agree. It's great to see Tom Noonan and Mary Wornov again. Also, Ms. Donahue really looks great bouncing around in her 1980's jeans.
As for negatives, sometimes the low budget shows, and I'd have liked a slightly higher body count at the climax, something that suggested of a more monstrous conspiracy. {maybe a few more car loads of bad guys showing up}
Some of the ADD challenged viewers out there might not appreciate the buildup, and that's their loss. Another solid entry from Ti West.",1269388800,3,853,4.8493150684931505
3963497,5,B002OVO18A,I'm not sure what the nay sayers are complaining about.  I've seen 100's of horror movies and this was one of the most suspenseful and one of the best.  Period.,1268870400,,160,4.3
3963498,4,B002OVO18A,"""The House of the Devil"" is one of the better horror movies I've seen in quite sometime. It was nice to see a horror film that showed a attention to detail and a eye for suspenseful cinematography, and of course, one that was really creepy. ""The House of the Devil"" is a tale of a desperate Co-ed named Sam, who is strapped for cash. She replies to a ""Babysitting"" gig to make a quick $100 but there is something strange and desperate about the man offering her the job. After some deliberation her and her friend drive out to the back woods house where she meets with the man and his wife, an odd couple dressed in all black. Soon, the husband confesses that this isn't a babysitting gig, he wants her to stay in the house and respond in case his ""bedridden mother upstairs"" has any problems. Sam is ready to forget the whole thing but he offers her a whopping $400 for four hours of work. Something any cash strapped co-ed would have trouble refusing. Sam agrees to the terms but as the night progresses she will soon be fighting for her life. I can understand how some will find ""House of the Devil"" a tad slow and boring but as a fan of suspense rather than gore I found the movie to be an excellent exercise in building tension and the production of a beautifully shot horror movie. The simple shots of the house in the dark surround by the sinister and ominous woodlands was enough to send a chill down my spine. It reminded me a little of ""Susperia"" which automatically won its favor with me. Aside from the technical aspects, everyone contributed solid performances. Jocelin Donahue is perfect as the polite but naive Sam and Tom Noonan plays the creepy ""tall man dressed in black holding a cane satanist"" to a T. ""House of the Devil"" is a solid horror flick with flashes of brilliance and a refreshing alternative to all the carbon copy slasher flicks that come out every year. Most importantly I think it functions as a great cautionary tale to all the aspiring babysitters out there. If they seem like satanists then they probably are.",1268611200,14,2046,4.487935656836461

The acting is good, the script is very well thought out, the dialog works, the characters are believable, and most of all the atmosphere is amazing.  Although, this was shot recently the movie takes place in the early 80's and has a strong grindhouse 80's underground feel to it.

3963502,4,B002OVO18A,"In need of money for a down payment on an apartment, college student Samantha Hughes (Jocelin Donahue) takes a babysitting job for an odd couple living out in the middle of nowhere.  The situation becomes even more bizarre when the man (Played by veteran actor Tom Noonan) informs Samantha that they don't actually have a child, but rather the job entails her looking after his elderly mother.  Not wanting to turn down the large sum of money offered to her, Samantha decides to take the job which turns out to be the biggest mistake of her life.

Being a huge fan of 80's horror films, 'The House of the Devil' really blew me away with it's retro 80's look.  Everything about the film screams 80's cinema, whether it's the cinematography, music, fashion, etc..  There have been quite a few films in recent years that have attempted to duplicate the 80's era vibe, but Ti West's effort here is clearly the best that I've seen.

Without giving a whole lot away, I will say that the title of the film pretty much says it all.  The film has a slow build up, leading to it's grand finale, which may aggravate those looking for a faster pace movie.  I've seen quite a few people on the internet label the film as ""boring"" and ""pointless"".  It did seem like there were a couple of ""filler"" sequences in the middle of the film, thrown in just to push it to a 95 minute run time.  Overall the slower pace of the movie didn't bother me at all though as the characters are all well acted out and the locations bring forth a rather creepy atmosphere which will keep you glued to your seat...with a conclusion that is more than satisfying.

'The House of the Devil' relies more on tension and psychological horror than it does blood and gore...not to say that the film doesn't have it's fair share of that as well.  I think fans of classic Satanic themed horror films such as 'The Omen' or 'Rosemary's Baby' will really enjoy what Ti West has created here.  Younger, A.D.D. stricken fans of newer films such as 'Saw' or 'Hostel' may find it a bit boring.  I, myself absolutely loved the film though and in my opinion 'The House of the Devil' is a definite ""must own"" for any true horror fan.

3963504,4,B002OVO18A,"This is a nifty little horror flick. Shows what can be done with a little budget and a lot of smarts. The story revolves around a young female college student who gets hired to babysit only to find out she's a target/victim in a Satanic cult ritual.

There are only a couple of sets in the movie and while the cinematography is good the viewer can see they needed a few more dollars there. What does work in that regard is that the camera always seems to be in the right place. I didn't feel as though I were looking at a student or amateur film. Just very good sense in direction. The soundtrack was good and the editing was good for the most part. My guess is they spent much of the budget on the two main cast members, Tom Noonan and Mary Woronov. It was money well spent. They aren't in the movie a lot but they make an impression when they are. The lead actress, Jocelin Donahue, I've only seen in one previous movie, The Burrowers, but I honestly don't remember her because I didn't much care for the movie itself. She does a nice job here. She really gives off a cute, innocent vibe.

The movie is a bit on the slow side. The early scenes have a few too many filler shots for my taste. Long shots of Jocelin walking down various hallways or waiting on steps for an appointment that doesn't happen. It does help build up to the later climactic scenes. It's just a bit slow is all. When things key up to the climax they get pretty good. And the clues leading up to that point are nice as well. That being said, this is an exercise in good sense film making. I got the impression that there wasn't a lot of pork in the budget. A lot of directors try to make their mark with horror films and there are more misses than hits. This one is a definite hit.",1267660800,2,1755,4.174041297935103
3963505,1,B002OVO18A,"I understand that some people like this movie, and I understand why.  If you listen to these people, you'll hear comments about suspense, and slow burns, and atmosphere.  ""This is what you get when story takes a back seat to style,"" says one of the higher rated reviews on this site.  It's a comment I completely agree with, although I don't think it has such a positive connotation.

That reviewer, and the other praisers of this piece, can only point to one element of the film that they enjoyed, and that is its glacial pace.  To these people -- who often bemoan the short attention spans of horror audiences ""these days"" -- the only horror you really need in a film is the vacuum of suspense, the creepy feeling that something MIGHT happen.  And this movie has that in spades.  Tons of slow, trawling shots through a creaky and creepy house in the woods.  Lots of slow pans as a babysitter walks slowly down hallways or clicks on bathroom lights.  Dozens of poorly framed and unnecessary shots establishing that our lead is getting her backpack, or frustrated by her roommate's snoring, or a big fan of The Fixx.

Directors: if you're going to build tension, you must occasionally release it, or you threaten to warp that mood out of any usable shape.  Pull a rubber band long enough, and it loses it's ability to bounce back.  By the time this movie decides to release its tension (about fifteen minutes before the closing credits), it has already robbed itself of any spring or strength.

The story is a kick back to the 80's era Terrorized Babysitter tales, right down to its fuzzy cinematography and it's cheesy title card.  This is done well, although it also feels like the producers' excuse for failing to do anything new or creative with its basic storyline.  The opener of the film claims that the plot is based on ""true unexplained events"" having to do with Satanic cults, and if you know anything about Satanic cults, you could probably guess the entire story without much help.  But don't worry!  If you're cinematically challenged, the film gives you a few (horribly written and poorly acted and weakly contrived) televison news segments that conveniently hint at the movie's main motivation.

It's bad, folks.  It's uninteresting, uncreative, and kind of an insult.  As a move buff and a die-hard horror fanatic, it's frustrating and baffling that a movie would demand an hour and a half of patience, only to deliver fifteen minutes of weak cheese, stale dramatics, and laughable thrills.  Too bad this house didn't actually have a devil in it.  It would have been a whole lot scarier.",1267574400,18,2603,4.737777777777778

The slow burn works great in a good thriller, but in order for it to work, you need just a lil' bit more happening than happens here for a very long time.

No point at all in the opening where she finds a new apartment (but fun to see Dee Wallace(Stone))and lots of plodding scenes of sitting around.  Always a hoot to see Woronov, though.

Sure it was something different, but it still wasn't good.  I hate the new modern gore style movies and am still waiting for a return to a nice mix of mood and terror.  This film goes too far to all out mood, which I really couldn't get into (try the French film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Them-a-k-a-Ils/dp/B000X1RYEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Them (a.k.a.

And the 80's-vision, grain-adder looks like crap on blu-ray: crap-o-vision.

For me, I love slow-brew suspense and horror movies, Hitchcock, Polanski, etc., but this was just flat out dull and boring. On top of that the similarities to Rosemary's Baby were disappointing.  I just don't understand how a movie like this gets green-lit.  Someone should be fired over this one.  Although in a way, I hope West tries again.  Go back and watch The Amityville Horror ('79), The Howling, Poltergeist, Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street and notice how the mood and atmosphere are massaged into the scalp for a satisfying horror lather.

The only thing scary was that we actually sat through this movie.  If it hadn't been a guy's night movie, we agreed, none of us would have finished it.  The unfortunate part is I made my friends watch this, and they agreed I can't pick movies anymore.  It did that much damage.

3963513,5,B002OVO18A,"It's been done a hundred times, late teen to early twenty something needs cash so she takes a babysitting job at a large, creepy and barely lit house; either in the middle of the nowhere or in the middle of a group of homes with people who couldn't hear an atomic bomb go off in their front yard.  It's a simple, creepy and old premise. And it's one of my favorites.

With such films as ""When A Stranger Calls"" and ""Halloween"" being two of the grandparents to Ti West's wonderful throwback film ""House of the Devil"" no wonder the film is so good.  You take the above mentioned premise, throw in a little devil worship and some Alfred Hitchcock; and 'bang' you got yourself a sure fire hit; at least in my opinion.

Samantha is a busy and broke college student, who despises living with her borderline prostitute of a roommate, so she goes out and finds herself a nice little place right beside a church no less.  Her soon to be land lady is very nice, even waving the deposit; as long as Sam has the first months rent by Monday.  But, this is only a few days til then, where will the money come from?! Enter an ominous 'BABYSITTER NEEDED' ad on the ads board and an ill fated phone call and the set up is done.

The great thing about ""The House of the Devil"" is that it doesn't rely on gore or something MAJOR happening every 5 minutes.  That is fine for some, but in this day and age of instant gratification and now, now, now film making where a gallon of blood and a few severed limbs are needed to keep most of the ADHD kids interested; it's great that Ti West has the guts to go out on a limb and give us a very simple set up and then let our imaginations go into overdrive for the middle 45 minutes of the film.

Yes, you heard me.  After Samantha gets to said house, meet the ""owners"" and after a few bumps in the road, with one or two HOLY CRAP moments, we are left alone with Samantha, her walkman and a HUGE mansion of a house to explore and be creeped out by.  And this is where the film shines.  By making the mundane experience of exploration into a tightly wound, edge of your seat ride.  And as things begin to become clear to Samantha, and little tilts of the camera or focusing on an open doorframe become more noticeable, the chills of the film start to sink in even more.  The ending, although coming on very fast and ending to easily and much to quickly for my taste, is a perfect example of 80's horror.  How what you are exposed to earlier in the film, such as a staircase, or a doorway, or a carpet, becomes a bit more important.  Even simple lines are used well to help throw us and Samantha off.

The cast was wonderful.  I had never heard of Jocelin Donahue before this film but her portrayal of Samantha was great, bringing just the right amount of innocence, fear and fight into the role and her beauty didn't hurt.  Greta Gerwig as Sam's best friend who's name alludes me at the moment was also great, even if her screen time was short.  She was spunky and feisty and showed a genuine amount of concern at leaving her bff out in the middle of nowhere.  ""Manhunters"" Tom Noonan was creepy and imposing as Mr. Ullman and ""The Devil's Rejects"" Mary Woronov  was the same with her limited sceentime.

The films design was PERFECT, as it was set in the 80's and was meant to emulate an old 80's horror film.  The leads girls had their hair feathered, wore tight or acid washed jeans.  I LOVED Samantha's HUGE mittens at the beginning! SOOOOOO 80'S!!! Even the music was 80's! With the film frame freezing during the opening credits to really cheesy synth music, and Samantha's little dance number to The Fixx's 'One Thing Leads To Another' mid film!
The sets were creepy when they needed to be, and fun when they needed to be and throwback normal when they needed to be.  Little touches were also great, like the phone in the Ullman's kitchen, and Samantha's walkman.

I'll admit that the film is not for everyone.  It's a slow burn of a film, having a fun and creepy beginning, and a tightly wound and very disturbing middle, and then a VERY quick and fast paced ending.  But, if you enjoyed films like ""When A Stranger Calls"" (the original) and ""Rosemary's Baby"" then this is definitely a film you'd enjoy.",1266105600,,4232,4.33502538071066

House of the Devil avoids current pratfalls and absurd, over-the-top rubbish that placates most new horror flicks.  Thumbs up for that.  This is more of a subtle, intelligent suspense story that will challenge your wits.

However, it's far from perfect.  This movie doesn't deliver anything very original with the premise.  Another college student/babysitting type of setup.  But the idea of a satanic cult touches on a sensitive nerve that is all too disturbing.

But the Devil never really gets his due.  This movie has solid acting, good character development, and creepy sound effects.  Unfortunately, not much of a payoff for your patience.  The story tiptoes along, and finally reaches a frightening bloody climax.  Too bad it ends so abruptly.

3963519,5,B002OVO18A,"Ti West's critically lauded ""The House of the Devil"" has received two seemingly conflicting descriptions: most hail it as a throwback to the satanically-inclined horror movies of the 70s and early 80s, while a more insightful minority compare the pic to the related and sometimes overlapping art horror films of the late 60s and 70s. (See Polanksi, Roeg and Weir). West's attention to period detail allows him to create a film that could pass as mid-80s vintage, but the dramatic heart of the film is tied to the more low key works of the artier directors. While the 80s saw the compromising of the past decade's innovations and eccentricities, West refuses any such diminishment, and creates a deliberate, slow-build rare to any era of horror.  This combination no doubt leads to the somewhat conflicted response among horror geeks: many surely came in expecting conventional thrills and instead received extended exposition followed by Jocelin Donahue wandering about a large empty house for a full half hour, knife in hand but with precious little to stab. There's really no silencing such critics, it's ultimately too subjective, but I would submit that ""The House of the Devil"" establishes Ti West as perhaps the most careful, subtle horror director on the scene today. ""The Roost"" and ""Triggerman"" already displayed an impressive patience, a willingness not merely to build but to actually make the viewer wait, so much that the random explosions of violence could be legitimately surprising. West takes this tendency even further here, but, at the same time, West does not cheat the viewer. Some low-key horror films refuse to show the viewer anything at all (see Picnic at Hanging Rock), but, after all the wait, ""House of the Devil"" delivers with a blood-smeared, no-nonsense finale that answers any questions we may have had. This climax is, I'll admit, not as impressive as what came before, but it stands up well next to the conclusions of most quality modern horror films, and the surrounding material puts most everything else absolutely to shame.

As with most horror films, the premise is simple: Sam (Jocelin Donahue) is looking to escape her college dorm, but needs money for her new apartment. She answers a rather cryptic ad for a babysitter placed by the gaunt, towering Mr. Ulman (Tom Noonan) and his somewhat unpleasantly friendly wife (Mary Woronov), who live in an isolated, oversized house far out in the woods. Upon Sam's arrival Mr. Ulman admits that there is no child, but rather an elderly woman, unseen and evidently asleep in the upper reaches of the house. Sam is hesitant, but the Ulman's are so desperate to view the grand eclipse (which just so happens to peak at midnight) that he offers Sam a full $400, more than enough to cover her current financial woes. Such an offer seems too good to be true and, unsurprisingly, it is.

The film is even more deliberate than that synopsis suggests: Sam doesn't arrive at the Ulman's house until a solid 25 minutes into the film, and she does not find herself alone in the mysterious place until 20 minutes later. Furthermore, overt scares are in short supply until the final act. (The few we receive early on, however, are terrific.) The slow build is mirrored in the visual style, dominated by slow, prowling takes and ultra-deliberate zooms. Similarly, the score is, for the most part, minimalist, dropping to near silence much of the time. These tendencies are largely dropped in the climax, as the soundtrack screeches and the camera careens wildly. These are, perhaps, rather conventional effects, but the film's willingness to play things gently for so long gives the final shift much more impact.

While West and co. simulate the technical aspects of 80s horror filmmaking effortlessly, the greater polish is undeniable, and West's talent for exquisite little touches is impressive. (Note the oft-referenced and rather charming scene where Sam dances about the house to ""One Thing Leads to Another."") Though shot on grainy 16mm, the film maintains an elegant look and the performances are perfectly modulated, in contrast to the hammy and flat turns of much 80s horror. Donahue's Sam is somewhat thinly written, but she injects her with the perfect ing&eacute;nue vulnerability, while Noonan is tastefully low-key and Woronov just shy of camp. There is not a single off moment in the film in either the acting or visuals, at least until some overly hasty editing near the conclusion. (Minor points I assure you.)

The film's heart comes when Sam finds herself alone in the Ulman's home and gradually discovers that something is drastically wrong. There is, again, little that is overt, as Sam mostly wanders about, growing more and more frightened. Rarely in these scenes is she in any apparent danger--they are more about the idea of fear, reminding of how one (one like myself, anyway) can inexplicably work his way to terror in an empty house. In the commentary West describes the film as a mystery, a not unreasonable claim. The solution to the mystery is mostly obvious (the title isn't subtle), but West's delicacy and Donahue's humanity place the viewer in the world and give the inevitable revelations an impact. By isolating her so long, the film creates a connection between viewer and protagonist that is rare but absolutely crucial to the film's effect.

Even after my extended rambling, ""The House of the Devil""s charm is difficult to quantify. It is nothing new, deliberately nothing new, but it repeats the old conventions so beautifully that they feel new again, that we can see why they became conventions in the first place. The film is a good counterpart to the terrific and very modern ""Martyrs,"" the other candidate for best horror movie in recent memory. While that film shows where the genre can go now, ""The House of the Devil"" displays the best of what it already has done, and will continue doing for a long time. Check it out.

3963521,3,B002OVO18A,"First off I want to say that I  was psyched about this movie and wanted to love it, but it just didn't deliver the goods. A lot of reviews will tell you how this rises above dumb teen horror and how it doesn't resort to this cliche and that cliche or how it builds tension and blah blah blah.  The truth is that it's  not enough just to not be like a lot of bad movies.  You still have to deliver. This is a movie that pretentious critics are afraid to say sucks because it isn't run of the mill and most critics know jack all about horror and only give the thumbs up if they think its artsy. True horror fans though won't be afraid to say this thing is way too SLOW ! Slow isn't a virtue in and of itself and anyone who says this isn't too slow likely isn't being very honest. Horror movies don't have to come at you like a Bourne movie, but this was ridiculous. I don't know that I have ever seen a movie that could have improved as dramatically with some editing. The movie has all the elements, Tom Noonan is terrific.  When he firsts opens the door, the bemused look on his face is oscar worthy, that is how much the man owns in that scene. The 80's vibe this thing shoots for is also spot on.  This really could be confused with an authentic horror film of that era. Remember big ass walkmans, pay telephones, mall hair? It's all here. This puppy just doesn't come together however in the final analysis.  The film's small budget is painfully obvious and unlike in some films it doesn't come across as ""independent"" or ""gritty"" because of it. The cheapness of it gives it rather instead a very isolated quality, that only adds to the tedium.  I will keep my eye on director Ti West however, the man will contribute more to the horror genre.  Hopefully next time he will have a budget and an editor.",1265587200,3,1804,4.236151603498542
3963522,5,B002OVO18A,"'House of the Devil' is by far one of THE best Horror films of its kind I have seen in a loooong time.  I swear I thought I was actually watching a lost, Horror classic had it not been for seeing some familiar faces.  Don't get me wrong, even though 'House of the Devil' pays homage to late 70's to early 80's Horror by achieving the look and feel and using the old satanic cult formula (babysitter in trouble once again!), it still manages to be original!  It's always interesting to watch a Horror flick like this one that gets its inspiration through true events.  For the longest time, I never knew (due to my age), there were a large number of unsolved crimes and in some cases, strange unexplained happenings involving small groups of satanic cults.  I mostly hear of Jim Jones or Charles Manson.  You know, the usual stuff. haha.  Well, back to the flick, I didn't find myself rolling my eyes one bit because every action made from the victims is realistic.  Every actor and actress that was hand picked for this film, is perfect.  What does make this film remind you that you are watching a new Horror film, is that there is some grizzly splatter involved.  Not much splatter but when it is shown, it is HIGHLY affective!  The pacing is just right.  Some folks might complain that the pacing is slow.  Sorry folks but for a story like this, the pacing is just right.  Oh, and on a personal note, that blonde character, Megan, is what was once my 80's-next-door neighbor/babysitter! LOL!  I don't want to give any spoilers so I'll just keep this ""review"" short and sweet.  It is sure to please fans of the old and new Horror genre.

3963523,1,B002OVO18A,"IF YA DON'T WANNA KNOW, DON'T READ BELOW!!!

I first read about this movie on [...] and was really interested to see it.  Being a long-time horror fan, I thought a nice Satanic-cult-throw-back-to-80s-horror would make for a great late-night watch.  Sadly, this movie nearly put me to sleep.  Yes, it's just that boring.  Even the awesome Mary Woronov & Dee Wallace couldn't keep me from being bored silly by this dull let-down.  And, besides, they were both really underused in this flick.  It needed much more of them in it.  They both REALLY must need the paycheck.  But, I digress...

In its defense, this movie gets the 'creepy' feel & tone down mostly well.  But, we've seen it all before in much better movies.  I could totally sense what this movie was TRYING to do but it never lives up to that anticipation.  Desperate girl takes a mysterious job at a spooky house where spooky people live and even though she knows something is not right she still stays proving she is an idiot.  This has been done 1,000 times before and this movie adds nothing but frustration and disappointment to that particular horror legacy.

I kept waiting for this movie to get good.  It had potential with the Satanic cult theme and the spooky house in the middle of nowhere right next to a graveyard theme but it just seemed to me that the director thought he was making something cool when it really just came off as tired, cliched rehash.  There just isn't a lot happening in this movie.  To be honest, the most shocking thing in the movie was the unexpected way the main character's best girlfriend gets it.  You just know she has to go but how it happens was so quick and unexpected, well, I just wished the rest of the movie gave me the same feeling that this particular death scene did.  Unfortunately, I was not to feel that way again.

At about 94 minutes in length you literally have to wait until the LAST 10 MINUTES for anything exciting to happen.  Seriously!  During the film there's a little bit of creepiness-while-exploring-the-house but most of this movie is simply godawful slow, tedious and boring.  When 'it' really starts to hit the fan at the end, it is so entirely anticlimactic because the villians are some of the easiest-to-dispose-of villians that I have ever seen in a movie.  It's laughable how easily they meet their demise.  Really, I laughed out loud because it was so unintentionally funny.  This, for me, really deflated how the movie had inflated these characters to be super creepy and scary and then they are so easy to kill.  And, finally, when the anticipated pay-off is about come it falls completely flat.  The moment-of-horror at the end when all is revealed is so corny and goofy that it's not even scary.  The monsters look cheesy, the acting plummets to new levels of awful and the ending feels like a slap in the face we've felt 1,000 times before with hokey & inferior low-budget films copying superior cinematic climaxes.  Satan's ill-conceived devil-child will live even if the unwilling mother-to-be lies in a gunshot-induced coma.  Yawn.

This is low-budget horror done poorly.  It's a shame because this movie had potential.  The massive, menacing house in the middle of nowhere storyline is intensely overdone but for awhile in this movie it got a little creepy.  I could honestly see a decent movie in here with a different director.  This was some of the worst direction that I have ever seen on film.  And the film is horrendously predictable.  And I mean you can see scenes set up 45 minutes from when they actually happen just by one character repeatedly mentioning certain dialogue.  Hint:  College kids like pizza.  The number for pizza is on the 'fridge.  There's the number for pizza.  Don't forget to call for pizza.

OK, we get it, sheesh.  The pizza's gonna be evil and this movie is gonna suck.  A terrible shame as I had much better expectations.  Oh, well, better luck next time.",1265328000,12,3934,4.691068814055637
3963524,5,B002OVO18A,"What can I say... great movie, just great!

This movie oozes 80's horror, what a great tribute to those kind of movies. From the hair style right down to the electronics, and title card in the beginning, the filmmakers spent their money wisely on this film and it paid off. This film isn't flashy, a glossy big budget Hollywood flick, it's a straight forward, in your face, gritty horror film.

Let's start, the director Ti West obviously paying tribute to kubrick, Polanski, heart of the story, Samantha (played by new comer Jocelin Donahue) needs money to pay her first month's rent on her new apartment, so strapped for cash she answers this babysitter flyer she has found on the campus bulletin board. She goes to said house which is the most foreboding, creepy house since Amityville horror, her friend megan who was her ride doesn't like the idea of dropping her friend off in the middle of nowhere with some weirdos. We meet the head of the house hold played by subtle perfection by veteran character actor Tom Noonan, he states he has lied he has no child that needs to be watched over but his elderly mother. So Samantha backs off from the offer can't watch over an elderly person, but Noonan offers her $$$, enough money to cover her rent, so she takes it, four hours in a big, desolate house, what can go wrong?
As it turns out Noonan and wife are part of a satanic cult, who plan to use Samantha in their ritual, all this happening on the night of a Lunar eclipse none the less.

Ok with the plot out of the way I thought the film was down right awesome, seeing the grain on the film at first thought I got a lousy DVD or the distributor just did a crappie job of doing a DVD transfer, but the director did this on purpose, see some scratches and grain on the film, gives it more of that 80s feel. The atmosphere was right on the mark, ok so last ten mins or so felt little rushed but it's that build up before the end that gives you the heebie jeebies. A nice slow burn, building up to the climax. Most of the film we see Samantha explore this giant creepy house, things start getting more weird as her friend Megan is not picking up her phone, there is something weird going on in this house.  It's the tricks the director uses, some nice editing, the music to set the atmosphere, some cheap scares such as the phone ringing to catch ya off guard. Brilliant film making using basic fears that we all have.

Anyways this movie is a bit slow for 90 mins or so, but an average length for a horror film. I liked the fact that it was set in the eighties in a non descript town, University, State, and that there are no cell phones no 21st century technology to help you, what did people do back then? I liked how the film makers used that, makes for a more believable movie. there's no nudity not a whole lot of blood and guts.

What you do get is a slow, steady, meticulous movie where creepy dark hallways, shadows, cold basements, creaky floor boards, a foreboding house, weird satanic cultists, a cute protagonist, and some good scares generate the story... this movie shows what horror can be

Any horror fan will enjoy this one even though it does borrow from Polanski's Rosemary's Baby, still worth checking out",1265328000,,3227,4.404362416107382
3963525,4,B002OVO18A,"I didn't know too much about this film except that Dreadcentral liked it and they liked it a whole lot.  Plus anything that seems to do with the occult rather than not brings back the thought and enjoyment I had with such great 60's and 70's fare as The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, The Omen, and the various Hammer films of the time.  So when it came out for purchase, I had to check it out and what we have here is a very good throwback of a film that will either make people smile with glee or roll their eyes.  I'm most certainly in the prior group and here is why:

This is a story about a college co-ed that desperately wants to get out of her dorm and away from her pretty but slob of a room mate and her room mate's revolving door of concubines.  So to do this she is in desperate need of getting cash and out on the college bulletin board she sees an advertisement for a baby sitter.  Which is where our story actually begins.

First off, I would like to say that this film, though made in 2008 is actually a throwback to the films of the past and happens to be a period piece of that time (most likely 1983)).  It is true to its time period with everything: hair style, clothing type, phones, televisions, music.  The film almost feels as if it was made back then.  It even has a style that reminded me of John Carpenter's Halloween and James Cameron's Terminator in this sense:  very throwback in look and feel.  And the film maker deserves a pat on the back for that.  A non-original film (since it all has been done with Rosemary's Baby and the Oliver Reed/Karen Black/Bettie Davis/Burgess Meredith film Burnt Offerings) becomes very original in today's horror world.

This film gets its reputation and praise from critics from this throwback feel but also, and more importantly, from its build up of suspense.  From the moment our lead girl calls the phone number, there is a creepy vibe and her best friend knows it.  Our lead girl knows it too but money is money and the job is a well paying job and the folks hiring her are desperate indeed; a lunar eclipse happens only so often (hmmmn, very interesting).  Anyways, those who love today's teenager made horror will hate this film (the same crowd that laughed at scenes in The Exorcist when it was rereleased at the theaters a few years back).  Some could say it is very slow and that nothing much happens for good periods of time in the film, that even maybe parts could be removed completely, but that is not the point.  The film instead leaves a dread like a dark cloud hovering over us throughout with glimpses of what will come.  We have a very horrific moment occur around the 29 minute mark and then at the 57 minute mark the real film begins and the suspense begins to turn into kenetic action with a payoff that most horror fans will love (even those who did not enjoy the first hour).

I recommend this film most definately.  It's throwback feel is great, having a horror title using the occult as the premise has been missed.  Our characters are truly gems and the actors that play them are splendid.  We don't have college kids that look like supermodels here.  And our heroine is brave and our villians are wonderfully eccentric.  If you like fastpaced action horror, forget this film.  But if you like slow moving suspenseful film, with good character development, that has a powerpunch payoff, you'll want to see this.  But be warned, you'll either love this film because of its true worth as a genre film or hate it since it just isn't today's ""norm"".  Watch and enjoy.",1265328000,,3550,4.443585780525503
3963526,4,B002OVO18A,"The House of the Devil might be a new film, but if I didn't know that before watching, I would have bet everything I own that it was made in the early to mid 1980's. I did a little research on it before I viewed it, so I knew it would be a slow burn that was more concerned with building up tension. I had no problem with The Changeling and I had no problem sitting through this one. The lead actress, Jocelin Donahue, was very good, especially for low budget horror. She gave a natural performance that never felt forced. Top top it all off, her character didn't do the many stupid things associated with this genre. I also enjoyed the opening sequence, complete with a nice 80's sounding horror beat and some old school credits. The movie is slow at times (might bother some) and has very few editing cuts, but there is a strong payoff at the end for those who might want a little splatter to go along with the goosebumps. Rosemary's Baby may come to mind because of the satanic storyline, but The House of the Devil does everything right and is a breath of fresh air in this age of bad horror remakes.

As one reviewer mentioned before this film has tremendous atmosphere, much like Let's Scare Jessica To Death, which is one of my all-time favorites. This will not be for everyone. Im 26 and I think most of my friends would be bored to death with this because they think in order for a movie to be scary or interesting you have to have buckets of blood & carnage filling every scene. The house itself in this movie is a bigger tension builder than the satanists. My only drawback from giving the movie 5 stars is the climax, which just didn't take advantage of the momentum built up to that point.

The film is one that is not for those who are looking for a quick paced, gore filled scream fest. It is, however, for those who enjoy an atmospheric, character driven movie. The film does have well done effects, a very atmospheric score, and very solid cinematography.

If Mr. West is involved with the marketing of this film then I say job well done.

The tension is replaced by boring, ultra-long drawn out wanderings through the hallways and rooms of the house, Greta Gerwig disappears and nothing, I mean NOTHING happens!!

Nothing could be further from the truth. I already mentioned that the script was stiffly written. ""Ah, I see you've met. Excellent."" The lack of editing creates a slow pace that drags on and on.

3963535,5,B002OVO18A,"From what I can tell director Ti West discovered a wormhole to 1983 and decided to film his movie while visiting. Like Tarantino & Robert Rodriguez's homage to the grindhouse genre or Rob Zombie's ongoing love affair with 70s exploitation films, West painstakingly recreates the vibe of early 80s horror, even shooting in 16mm to achieve the proper ""look"". The end result is so effective that I'm convinced House of the Devil is simply a movie I missed back in the day. I can envision it sandwiched somewhere between The House on Sorority Row and The Hunger in a fat clamshell case at Blockbuster Video.

Just how 80s is this? The film begins with the protagonist, Samantha, walking down the street and in typical early 80s horror movie style the frame freezes as the title pops up. This happens during the end credits as well - I love this so much!  Later Samantha puts on orange 80s Walkman headphones and dances to The Fixx's ""One Thing Leads to Another"".

3963537,4,B002OVO18A,"The House of the Devil (Ti West, 2009)

Let me start this review by saying that this is a vertical-market movie. I'm not sure that those under forty are going to enjoy it nearly as much as I did, because it's a flat-out homage to all those cheesy seventies and eighties horror flicks on which I grew up, and as a result, it is, itself, inestimably cheesy. I get the feeling the younger generation will just groan and shake their heads at this, the way they do when I (and those horror fans near my age) talk about how great the original Dawn of the Dead was or how The Exorcist (the original cut, not that hideous ""version you've never seen"") is one of the best. Movies. Ever. The second thing I need to say is ""wait. Ti West directed this? The same guy who directed The Roost? What happened in the past few years?""

Plot: girl (He's Just Not That Into You's Jocelin Donahue) takes shady babysitting job in scary old house. After that, it's just plain creepiness. You know something scary is going to happen (after all, the movie is called The House of the Devil, and the house's inhabitants are downright weird), but you've no idea what. Unless you read IMDB, but you shouldn't before you see this movie.

Because yes, you do want to see this movie. Why? Because it rocks. West has created a picture-perfect homage to all those stupid movies that we laughed at when we were kids (When a Stranger Calls is the obvious reference here, but you'll pick up on at least a dozen others from Rosemary's Baby to The Devil's Rain to Halloween). The difference is that West actually knows (and I'm again wondering what happened between the awful The Roost and this to make him this good) how to use silence and sustained shots to build tension rather than boredom, and to keep that tension going even through the inevitable jumps that usually release it. In other words, he took the part of When a Stranger Calls that was actually worth watching (the first twenty minutes) and drew it out to feature-film length. He does, of course, have to bow to the B-movie climax by making it hilarious, but if you were raised on these things like I was, you should know to expect that. And, hey, because it's an homage, he can get away with it. (I can just see the kids rolling their eyes and shaking their heads now.)

Despite some awful missteps (Jennifer's Body, anyone?), 2009 has been an exceptional year for horror films, and The House of the Devil is as good as any that have appeared this year. While I admit I haven't really been keeping up with current film as much as I should (the spreadsheet tells me I've seen thirty-six movies made in 2009), I'm confident, however shakily, in saying that this will definitely make my ten favorite films of 2009 list. ****",1259539200,5,2748,4.49
3963538,4,B002OVO18A,"Written, directed and edited by Ti West, ""The House of the Devil"" is a 2009 horror film that mixes in `slasher' elements, haunted house features and uses the ""satanic cult"" as its central plot element. It is a throwback horror movie that uses the film techniques, style and the look of the bygone era of the 80's. West's creation keeps it straight and simple, to keep it true to the 1980's genre of horror films.

She lucked out in finding a place owned by a kindly landlady who is willing to waive all deposits so long as Samatha can come up with the first month's rent the following week. Things look rather down for Samantha, as she drowns her concerns in pizza and chit-chat with her talkative friend Megan (Greta Gerwig). Her desperation leaves her to make a call as a babysitter for a Mr. Ulman (Tom Noonan) who desperately needs assistance; only instead of a child the job is for the care of an elderly mother and Ulman is prepared to pay a generous amount for a few hours. Reluctant but her need for cash is more a priority, Samantha agrees to the deal. When Mr. and Mrs. Ulman (Mary Woronov) leaves to watch the lunar eclipse, the young house sitter soon finds out that there is something sinister afoot and her life is in deadly danger.

""House of the Devil"" is a low-budget horror film with the sensibilities of 80's horror. The film looked a little grainy as was intended by being shot on 16mm film and is very thoughtful of the era that it pays homage to. The hairdos, clothes, music, art direction and set designs looked very 80's which aids in convincing the viewer that the film does occur in the 1980's. Using the plague of devil worship as the film's foundation, the film opens with text warning of the fact that Satanism was a major event during this period; even going as far as suggesting of a government cover-up to quell the potential panic. The film sells itself as a based on real events and do take note that not as a true story. It is a good gimmick to get the film going but it just doesn't seem viable the longer the movie went on as the film does have a major B-grade feel to it; this is not negative comment but rather a simple statement of its charm and sensibilities.

The film is suggestive, but barely infuriated as the direction gets Samantha going in exploring the huge, eerie house. West isn't trying to stir up the senses in a very nippy manner, the film takes its time with its screenplay as we see our main protagonist go through some feelings of weirdness as she finds out certain secrets within the home. There are also a mild snippet of violence to keep things interesting and to draw to viewer in. Ti West doesn't hide the fact that something is definitely amiss, he scrounges up some suspense driven by creepy sensations as Samantha becomes more uncomfortable with her situation in the eerie home. There are some graphic images of blood and some gore dispersed throughout, not as a cheap scare but more as a stimulant to keep the film interesting. Those who are expecting a thrill-a-minute horror movie may be a little disappointed, as the audience needs to settle in and explore the film's spooky elements.

Tom Noonan and Mary Woronov are no strangers to horror films; they have that very creepy feel to their characters as Megan seemed to have detected right away. The film does have a good final act sequence as we become privy to a demonic physicality that can bring some chills down your spine. Its final scenes do generate a lot of tension as we see the film go into overdrive; West goes on to display some bursts of violence, ghoulish imagery and bloody sprays. The film doesn't exactly give the answers to how things become the way they are, but asks its viewer to find the answers as it does make the consumption of pizza and demonic blood very problematic. It isn't exactly hard, as it has become common knowledge in the horror genre as to how spells and demonic blood can affect someone.

""The House of the Devil"" doesn't assume too much and it relies more on the power of suggestive restraint rather than resorting to an abundance of gore and blood. I was impressed in the manner with which West captured the mood and atmosphere that the film could've been ripped off the vault of horror sets. The film's main weakness is the problems of it moving to the next gear, as it dawdles a little too much. The film also starts off very clichd and in all honesty the way it gets its footing isn't very inventive. Be that as it may, West is succeeds in taking his viewer to an alarming, albeit less aggressive mood for horror. The film relies more on atmosphere than depth in characterization. ""House of the Devil"" is a fun watch.

3963539,4,B002OVO18A,"I enjoyed this movie.  It was set in the 1980's and I think the filmmakers  did a good job of bringing the era to life.  The acting was good as well.  But please be forewarned, this movie is more of a suspense film rather than a traditional horror flick.  I'd say 3/4 of this movie is about building suspense.  It's not until the last quarter of the movie that we get the gore and chase scene of a horror film.  I do think at times the scenes went on too long.  For me, there's a fine line between suspense and getting too long in the tooth.  But I did jump and scream several times, so in my book, the movie was worth the rental.",1258502400,,630,4.016129032258065
3963540,4,B002OVO18A,"You'd think a title like ""The House of the Devil"" would tell you everything you need to know. It does tell you a few things; this is, indeed, a story that involves evil people and hapless victims, who of course are young and female. But on the whole, this movie plays against everything you would probably expect, which in this case is a compliment. Instead of the usual gory camp fest, where idiotic teenagers are a dime a dozen, ""The House of the Devil"" is a quiet, slowly paced exercise in suspense, where apprehension comes not from bad things happening but from the idea of bad things happening. It's the kind of film where story plays second fiddle to style, the first hour spent on virtually nothing except establishing mood. This is good because, when there finally is a startling moment, we really do feel it.

The mood is so thoroughly established that one can't help but be somewhat disappointed by the final ten minutes, when all is explained (as best as can be explained, anyway). That's the inherent flaw with suspense: What leads up to the ending is always more frightening than the actual ending. Fortunately, the last major scene is amped up with a final shot so unnervingly ambiguous, you may find yourself clutching onto your armrest waiting for something to happen.

In spite of its fresh approach, the story effectively makes use of familiar horror movie themes. Taking place sometime during the 1980s, it tells of Samantha Hughes (Jocelin Donahue), a young college student trying to make it on her own but in desperate need of cash. Lo and behold, she spots on a bulletin board a want ad for a babysitter, and when she calls, she's immediately offered the job. As is always the case, the house she goes to is old, ornate, and located deep in the woods, far, far away from any other house. The occupants are Mr. and Mrs. Ulman (Tom Noonan and Mary Woronov), an older couple who dress in attire that might have been in fashion fifty years earlier. They're soft spoken and accommodating, yet there's always an uncomfortable air of mystery surrounding them.

As they get ready to leave for the evening, Mr. Ulman confesses that he and the missus have no young children for Samantha to look after. Instead, he wants her to stay in the house just in case Mother needs any help. Mother, who lives somewhere upstairs, is quiet and should be no problem at all; in all likelihood, Samantha won't ever have to go up and check on her. Samantha agrees to the job if her pay is increased to $400 (if that sounds ridiculous, keep in mind that the original offer was $100). Mr. Ulman, in dire need of someone for the night, agrees. He and his wife then depart, leaving Samantha with a list of phone numbers, including a local pizza joint in case she gets hungry. We don't exactly know where the Ullmans are going, but we do know that there will be a lunar eclipse around midnight.

What follows is a carefully paced buildup of tension. At first, it seems like absolutely nothing will happen; Samantha goes up and downstairs checking out various rooms, and that's it. Uneventful? Yes, but at least we get the chance to take in the ambiance of the house, which gives one the feeling of having stepped back in time by at least seventy-five years. At a certain point, things start to get creepy. For one thing, she keeps calling her best friend, Megan (Greta Gerwig), but gets only the answering machine. She then orders a pizza, and the guy at the other end seems a little too friendly. She turns on the television, where ""Night of the Living Dead"" is being broadcast on the weekly horror show. When she has to use the bathroom, she takes a butcher's knife with her for protection. And what exactly is Mother doing upstairs? Is anyone even up there?

I suspect the vast majority of today's audiences will be bored out of their minds by ""The House of the Devil,"" a film released at a time when the success of a horror movie is measured by masked killers and teens wandering off alone and getting naked before dying elaborate, bloody deaths. Writer/director/editor Ti West has the ambition to avoid such clichs and go for something much subtler, relying on dim hallways, eerie shadows, and phantom noises emanating from faucets. Even the final scenes, which aren't as strong as the scenes that came before them, don't follow the conventions of the typical horror movie; they explain certain things, yet they still leave much to the imagination. As we all know, what we see is never as scary as what we don't see.

When we leave the theater, we think not about the plot or the characters but about what has been experienced - the suspense a quiet room can generate, dangers that may or may not be hiding behind a closed bedroom door, terror brought on by what we can't actually see or hear. What evils lurk out of sight? Will they ever be seen? And if they are seen, what will they do? Even if ""The House of the Devil"" is founded on a premise that's all too familiar, it manages to be frightening because it exposes some of our most basic fears, none more powerful than being alone in a house. If you're tired of the typical teen slasher film, if you find slow and steady buildups more satisfying than back-to-back pop out scares, then I would recommend you go and see this film.",1258329600,39,5279,4.580952380952381
3963541,1,B002OVO18A,"While not as boring a ""horror"" movie as, say, ""Let the Right One In,"" be assured that ""House of the Devil"" will have you nodding off like a champ by, say, the 42-minute mark. Oh, and that thing about the movie being based on a true story is a complete joke.

On top of that, by now everybody who does not have their head up their poop chute should know that satanic cults are nothing more than fat guys eating cheese curls in their basement, listening to Slayer and playing D&D -- and maybe plotting new ways to blow up fish in the family aquarium when mommy's not in on the game.

But, boy howdy! If I didn't adhere to a strict 1- or 5-star rating policy (because life is black and white, never gray), I would probably give this movie 2 stars just because of Jocelin Donahue, the hottest new actress to come along in years. Seriously, folks. I can't wait for her to act in a real film. If you're reading this, Jocelin, holler at me!",1258243200,8,933,4.235955056179775
3963542,5,B002OVO18A,"I saw this movie twice I loved it so much. What a great old fashioned horror/suspense/thriller type of film. First off, the film was shot in 2008 but the time era it actually takes place in is the early 1980's (Thomas Dolby's ""One of our Submarines"" was a hit on the radio as they indicate in the film). The big thing then was tape player walkmans and rotary telephones. No email, cell phones or twitter here! Makes you think what the hell would I do in this circumstance? This film is just creepy. There's not a lot of action. There are no monsters. Just a creepy couple and their creepy son. I classify this film with ""Let's Scare Jessica to Death (1972)"" and ""Don't be Afraid of the Dark (1970-something)"" The film is also based on true events which makes it that much more interesting and scary. And whether the world likes it or not, there are Satanic Cults out there. They do exist. Which, again, makes this film all the more scarier. I'm buying it on DVD when it's released in 2010. If you're a sucker for good horror, I highly recommend this movie!",1258243200,20,1056,4.420512820512821

This movie was a brilliant departure from that trend.  Yes, it is slow moving (though without saying much, you do get your body count somewhat early).  But the point of the film is to build the suspense, and in that manner it did so very well.

There were some low points...grabbing of the knife at the onset seemed a bit unrealistic.  They did force a lot into the last ten minutes and it seemed like they should have developed it out just a little more.  But other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Reminded me of past thrillers that seem to now take a back seat to the bloodbath crap or comedy-horror that is en vogue.",1255737600,,810,4.544827586206897

So I saw a trailer for this and knew almost nothing about it. A girl takes a babysitting job, said job is actually a cover up and they want her for a satanic ritual. Wow. . wow.. I don't even know the budget but director Ti West completely captures the essence of late 70's/early 80's horror. From the lighting, props, whatever camera he used- this could been straight out of 80s but..it was made last year. The first hour is very slow but never boring..filled with tension and great cinematography. Jocelin Donahue is in every frame of the picture, she captures attention without needing to do anything at all. Her acting is so natural.

Tom Noonan!) and such a controlled and specific hand and eye.  I get it.  I love it - from the opening song that sounds like a watered down muzak version of The Cars.  This is a talented director who knows exactly what he's doing and like ROSEMARY'S BABY this film might take it's sweet time getting there but when the switch is flipped  - beware.  Post the explosion of a bulb - descend into a hellhole of scares.  It was akin to walking up 20 flights and then jumping off the roof.  Big recommend for true fans of the genre - Kubrick, Polanski, Carpenter fans, et al.  Don't come here looking for those bad remakes of classic horror movies that are clogging the box  office (yawn)- instead enjoy a movie that you might swear leapt from a time machine.

8376492,4,B002OVO18A,"SPOILER ALERT

Who are you running from?

The psycho with a chainsaw? The masked slasher? The flesh-eating zombie?  At least you can see what you're running from. What about running from someone/something you cannot see? In The House of the Devil, there is a battle royale between the doings of the Devil, and the vulnerable college woman. This slow-paced film builds an incredible amount of suspense by leaving viewers chilled by the thought of such a horror that does exist (devil worhshippers). Ti West placed viewers right up close and personal with its characters and utilizes many close-up shots to enhance the terror he is trying to provoke (like the face of the grandmother and the stone cold killer son). We as an audience feel Samantha's vulnerability to the dark and demented phenomenon blanketing the beautiful Victorian home. Between the strategically placed jump scares accompanied by eerie music, and the overall sense of the unknown throughout the movie, we are just as surprised as Samantha is when she discovers the Ulman son's body in the middle of a pentagram on the floor. This instance contrasted so immensely to the beginning of the film, when Samantha calls for the ""babysitting job"" or ""sit in the house, eat pizza, watch Night of the Living Dead, get paid $400, and then be sacrificed to the devil himself job"". Overall, The House of the Devil captures aspects of the horror genre and compiles them into one such as: silence, suspense, jump scares, and an evil villain (literally). I definitely thank Ti West for teaching me NOT to become a babysitter no matter how broke I am or how much a tall creepy man will pay me.",1519603200,,1645,4.826241134751773

I've never been a fan of slasher films, so maybe it's lost on me, but this movie lacked an interesting plot, likable characters, thrills, or even an occasional jump scare.

Nothing that even remotely resembles horror happens in the first hour and twenty minutes of this hour and thirty-five minute movie. Okay, wait, the guy shoots the one girl in the face. But other than that, nothing about this movie makes sense.

It's the story of a college coed in the 80s, who is hired to house-sit an old woman while her son and his wife go out for the evening. The coed is never introduced to the old woman she's to babysit, and then when there are strange noises in the house, she doesn't immediately think ""Oh, that's probably the old woman."" No, the film pretty much forgets that we already know that she knows she's not alone in the house.

My mother-in-law lives with us. If I hear a noise from upstairs in the middle of the night, I am going to assume it was her, not get all creeped out and walk around with a knife.

Then, in the last 10 or 15 minutes, it becomes a Satanic cult film and they just douse everything with blood. Stupid!",1505347200,,1065,4.262376237623762
