What I got was a dreadful movie with EXTREMELY poor special effects and a character/victim I couldn't care less about. This movie has been done dozens of times by the British, not sure if they had a hand in this one too but it came across as one such as the type they seem to have currently and thankfully gotten away from.
Dreadful, simply dreadful. All I can think of is that the makers of this movie had a lot of friends and associates write in great reviews for this.........stinker of a movie. Avoid this movie like the plague!",1367020800,,631,4.3559322033898304
3520124,1,B001CU7VKE,This is the worst transfer of a movie I have ever seen. I appears to have beeen done with an inferiior video camera. The picture was transferred in wide screen but it is not a wide screen movie so the picture is compressed. It jitters and freezes a couple of frames every few seconds. I cannot believe Amazon would sell such an inferior product. I paid $16.00 for this! I will be returning it for a refund and fully expect to get it!,1267488000,,433,4.228915662650603
8289415,1,B001CU7VKE,"The Cold is evidently the same movie as The Game. Both are rather generic titles, but the latter is really more appropriate since there are only a couple of scenes specifically dealing with cold while the premise revolves around a game. That premise begins with a group of rich people who have gotten bored with normal games. Now they bring people to an island to face their worst fears with the last remaining person receiving a prize of a million dollars. Sounds a bit like a reality game show I used to watch (Fear I think it was).

When this latest group of players arrives people quickly begin disappearing and showing up dead.  Elaborate pranks to scare everyone or lethal consequences to a game gone wrong? We're never quite sure if the group hosting the game takes it as far as murdering the losers or if this is an undesired turn of events for them as well since not everything in the realm of murder is what it appears to be. A few strong-willed members of the group are determined to find out what's really going on, and a couple may have secrets of their own to affect the outcome.

The movie teeters on having promise.  There's the question of whether or not we're seeing staged events or people really getting killed (in the movie reality, of course, obviously Bill Rebane didn't kill his actors).  There's the possibility of a crazed lunatic either hijacking the game for his own amusement or being a victim of it himself.  There's an undercover investigation subplot  and the possibility that someone is turning the twisted game on the group that runs it.

There are lots of possibilities here, and played out right they could make for a good tale of suspense and unexpected but logical plot directions. Unfortunately, not one of these ideas plays out to a satisfactory conclusion. It seems to me that Bill Rebane got so focused on surprising the viewers that he didn't concern himself with having a plot that actually makes sense. Most disconcerting is when, rather than have a real ending, he plays a sort of prank on the viewer -- that yanked me right out of the movie, gave me the middle finger, and  rolled credits while laughing at my expense.

Acting is passable. For a B horror movie these folks are good enough. If the plot didn't unravel so completely the weaker acting would be easier to overlook. With everything else that's wrong the performances do nothing more than rise to obscurity. I don't even remotely recognize a single name in the cast, and while I do recognize the director's name, Rebane, I don't associate him with anything I particularly enjoy.

The movie seems to try to mix whimsical with suspenseful. The opening music and running theme of the rich game runners is a lively saloon piano tune. Amusing poems open and close the feature. The tone of the rest of the movie is tense and creepy  at least it tries to be. The mixture isn't done very well and serves to make the more comical elements seem out of place rather than part of a smooth mixture.  I assume the whimsical tone is supposed to be the point of the ending, but rather than amusing it comes across as weak.

Content:
This is not a flick particularly well suited for young viewers. Watch for nudity, molestation, violence, and blood.

DVD:
This is available in at least two 50 movie mega-packs: Fright Classics and Chilling Classics. The audio on the former is unclear with a lot of white noise. The picture is out of focus. The audio and video on the CC print is better but still with trashy picture and noisy sound. There are no extras for either.

While a stand-alone DVD has existed at some point I cant find one currently in print making Chilling Classics quite possibly the only way to own this on DVD.

FINAL THOUGHTS:
You need to really be hard up for a movie to watch to take time for this one. If I might have at any point entertained the notion of giving this flick 2* the unraveling plot and unsatisfactory ending ensure that  I give it skid marks.",1520899200,,3967,4.571227080394922
8289416,4,B001CU7VKE,"if you like strange 1970s european horror,
this one had just enough of a plot to make the story interesting.
the monster is an insane creation.
the acting is pretty solid.",1519603200,,171,4.548387096774194
8289417,1,B001CU7VKE,"Truly Awful. Low budget bad acting, filming, and of course, to top it off, no scares. Unfortunately, skip it.",1519344000,,109,4.7894736842105265
8289418,2,B001CU7VKE,Snore. I like B horror. I like B Eurohorror. I like medical monsters. But this one doesn't deliver.,1519344000,,99,4.555555555555555
8289419,3,B001CU7VKE,Transferred from a 4th generation vhs copy but watchable in the Mills Creek / Brentwood kind of way. The sound at least is crisp. Part virus horror part mutant horror. The heroes must neutralize the blood sucking monster before the city is obliterated. Dated but for those nostalgic of late late late night movies this is pretty good.,1517875200,,334,4.775862068965517
8289420,3,B001CU7VKE,"It's bad, don't get me wrong. Yet it IS entertaining. If you like B movies with a capital B this is for you  The dubbing is strange and the camera quality is bad.  Its so trite it's funny",1516665600,4,187,3.8947368421052633
8289421,4,B001CU7VKE,"PANIC (1982) opens w/ extreme close-ups of various lab rats, which quickly go berserk! An experiment has gone hideously awry, unleashing a murderous mutant upon society! An amorous couple soon suffers a gruesome end to their backseat shenanigans. The police are baffled, finding the mutilated remains of the victims. Jane Blake (Janet Agren- HANDS OF STEEL, NIGHT OF THE SHARKS) worries about Professor Adams (Roberto Ricci), who seems to have gone missing. Enter Captain Kirk (David Warbeck- THE BEYOND), who joins Janet in her search for Adams. More bloody deaths put Adams squarely in the frame. Can Kirk and Blake get to the truth behind the senseless slaughter? Will they discover the high-level cover-up, involving a government snafu, having to do w/ germ warfare? Meanwhile, a gigantic guinea pig, that escaped from the lab, is found in a sewer drain, looking like a goggle-eyed liverwurst. Simultaneously, Adams, looking like rancid meatloaf in a wig, runs amok at a theater! A state of emergency is declared, and the town is quarantined. A priest is killed in church, by the festering Adams! Oh no! Now, soldiers are enforcing the quarantine, and killing more people than the maniacal monster! Captain Kirk and his team plunge their way into the sewers to flush out the ultra-ugly Adams-creature. Can they stop him, and his awful wheezing, before a secret aircraft destroys the entire city? In the end, Jane shows compassion for Adams, in spite of his having turned into living lasagna. This is crackerjack entertainment, folks!...",1516406400,,1540,5.139442231075697

8289423,1,B001CU7VKE,"I tried this one with the thought, well I've a little time to kill and...Well after a few minutes I was fast forwarding through the majority of the film to see what that monster looked like, how they killed it, etc. Even that was a waste. Where does Amazon get this junk?",1403481600,,271,4.230769230769231
8289424,3,B001CU7VKE,"The acting was horrible, but the plot was pretty decent. This however was not a typical English horror film which are usually done much better.  The special effects were weak as well.  However the story and plot was pretty good.",1373500800,,228,4.675
