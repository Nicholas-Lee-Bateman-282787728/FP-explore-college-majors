7830992,5,6302719496,"First in ""Horizon"", Blake and the crew arrive on the planet Horizon. Blake and Jenna are captured by Federation troops and interrogated by the planet's ruler, Ro. Ro is a native of the planet, and cannot bring himself to realize that he has become a puppet of the Federation, a figurehead used by them to maintain control over his people. Soon Gan, Villa, and Cally are captured too, and all are put to work in Horizon's deadly mines. Avon, alone on the Liberator and unable to contact the others, considers leaving them behind. Meanwhile, Blake tries to convince Ro of the truth, that he is leading his people into slavery, before it is too late. A very good character driven episode with an excellent plot and a really good ending. Five stars.

Next in ""Pressure Point"", Blake launches a daring campaign to destroy Control - the main computer nerve center of the entire Federation located on Earth itself. But with Servalan and Travis lying in wait, the mission will have some devastating costs. This was a really good and action-packed episode in which Blake learns the hardship of war and leadership as the struggle against the Federation becomes harder and a valiant member of the crew dies in a very sad and emotional ending. Five stars.

7830994,5,6302719496,"Volume 9 of ""Blake's 7"" on video contains two more episodes of this classic British sci-fi series. These episodes continue the saga of Blake, a rebel who is waging an interplanetary war against the oppressive Federation.
In ""Horizon"" (the first episode on the tape), Blake and his crew travel to the distant planet Horizon, where the natives are being ruthlessly exploited as slave labor by the Federation. A struggle emerges involving Blake's crew, the visiting Federation official, and the native leader who has been turned into a Federation puppet. I can't help but view this episode as an ironic commentary on England's own colonial past in Africa and India.
In ""Pressure Point,"" the next episode, Blake plans a daring strike on Earth, the heart of the Federation. This is a grim and suspenseful episode. This installment also offers a tantalizing glimpse into the background of Blake's nemesis Servalan.
These episodes contain many of the elements that make B7 such a compelling saga: intriguing characters, intelligent dialogue, and low-budget inventiveness. Essential viewing for fans of great sci-fi sagas.",993600000,,1114,5.299435028248587
7830995,5,6302719496,"More classics of a classic series!
""Horizon"" features an original and frightening aspect of what happens when the entire crew (but one) are captured and sent into slave labor.  The one remaining is Avon,  who has from the start wanted to keep out of harm's (and Blake's  vigilante-like) way.  Avon saves them in the end.
Another refreshing part  is Ro, who rules planet Horizon - who is actually a puppet by some  Federation people who are there only to mine the planet's resources.  Ro  and his mate come across as real people, not just stick figures, and that  adds GREATLY to an already superb story.
""Pressure Point"" is  sadly predictable in terms of the old ""Let's advertise an empty room  as being our control center"" even though such tactics do work in real  life, even to this day.  What is unpredictable is the death of one  character.  It's not the strongest death scene every made for the series or  ever made, period, but it suffices for what it needs to do.  This story  features a wealth of strong characters and typical Federation brutality  which surely must have tempted British censors!
