See and see again.",1430697600,,388,4.514285714285714
7925625,5,B00004WLRM,Vakhtang Chabukiani one of great Solors of the past has brought LA BAYADARE to life with a matchless cast who breathe emotion into every scene.  The two leading ballerinas: Gabriella Komleva and Tatiana Terekhova as Nikia and Gamzatti couldn't be better.  All this with Rejen Abdyev as Solor and wonderful soloists and corps de ballet leave you without a moment of boredom.,1116720000,11,373,5.0
