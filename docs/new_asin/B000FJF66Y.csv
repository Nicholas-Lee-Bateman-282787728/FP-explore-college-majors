2569634,4,B000FJF66Y,not what a hallmark movie usually is. The plot was not up to standards. did not keep me quessing what is going to happen,1396137600,,120,4.041666666666667
2569635,5,B000FJF66Y,"I believe this movie conveys the right relationship disposition between members of the same family, either close or not, for the most part the one that involves teenagers and responsible adults.

The movie imparts excellent positive feelings, suitable to follow in, instead of the confusing errant behavior most films featuring teenagers bring up.

I saw it on TV and would like to buy it in a digital format, although I am not being able to find.",1393718400,3,447,4.868421052631579
2569636,5,B000FJF66Y,"I saw this movie originally on TV and automatically was captivated by it. It deals with heavy issues, and really is such an amazing movie. Recommended if you're into psychological genres and have the desire to really be moved by a movie :)",1249257600,8,239,4.5813953488372094
2569637,4,B000FJF66Y,"I love this movie! I watched it on Hallmark a few years ago and decided I had to buy it. The relationship between Bobby and his aunt is really well developed and Bobby's developement is very well done and believeable. The actors rocked their roles! Also, usually movies about teens are them partying, drinking, doing drugs, pursuing a love interest, etc... but this movie was a change of pace, its about the relationship between a woman and her nephew. Its really great, I highly recommend it!",1216080000,12,493,4.744186046511628

8123742,5,B000FJF66Y,"I am a fan of Marcia Gay Harden.  I am also interested in child-development & how a dysfunctional family has negative effects upon family members through the generations.  Ms. Harden's character had grown up with misguided parents, who probably meant well, but raised 3 maladjusted children.  As an adult, Ms. Harden's character had sought counseling & had mostly overcome the ill-effects of her up-bringing.  She had only minimal contact with her family.  The story centers on Ms. Harden's character as the aunt who takes in her brother's teen-age son.  The aunt had made a good life for herself as a single woman, teaching & writing her first novel.  But, she puts her life on-hold as she learns how to help her nephew, whom no one in the family knew was a victim of long-term child abuse.  The relationship that the aunt & nephew forge together is a beautiful thing -- they become a family & nurture & sustain one another.",1485302400,4,925,4.7375

8123744,4,B000FJF66Y,Liked this movie very much. Makes the audience think about long-term effects of troubled childhood and profound impact it has on development. Loved the acting in this movie. Good job.,1470268800,4,183,5.133333333333334
8123745,5,B000FJF66Y,Not a big Hallmark movie fan; they tend to be unrealistic and somewhat boring.  But I loved this one.  Hard to go wrong with Marcia Gay Harden in a starring role.  The actor playing Bobby was terrific also.  And a good supporting cast.,1449619200,3,235,4.395348837209302
8123746,3,B000FJF66Y,"This wasn't quite what I expected.  My stomach was in knots just about the whole time I watched it.  The Aunt was so kind to take her nephew in, but the violence in one part (from his so-called ""new friend"") was way too much for me.",1429920000,7,232,4.021739130434782

8123748,5,B000FJF66Y,"how to survive a dysfunctional family is what this is all about. I loved the story...because families aren't perfect but sometimes you can take all that is wrong and work on it. Not your typical movie, but I thought an honest one. I love Hallmark movies.",1425081600,,254,4.543478260869565
