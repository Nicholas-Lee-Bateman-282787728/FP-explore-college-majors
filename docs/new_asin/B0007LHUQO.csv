8377837,2,B0007LHUQO,"I had seen snippets of this film in other DVDs and the picture quality was very good. Being a Spitfire fan I had to have a copy of the full length feature film with the bonus materials.

When the DVD arrived, I found that it was sourced from Rareaviation.com. The picture quality was very poor to say the least. It looks like someone had a poor quality VHS copy and had transferred it to DVD. I understand that it is an old film but I have many other films of similar vintage and I feel sure to say that there would be better copies of the film to be had. The only way to view the bonus materials was in my laptop as they are in Pdf format.

The DVD came in a transparent plastic CD case and not a regular DVD case with a good quality colour slick. I was very disappointed allround.

Would not recommend to anyone. I am considering buying a copy from Amazon. Co. UK who has a different supplier. Hope this review assists anyone considering buying a copy.",1147132800,45,954,4.202185792349726
