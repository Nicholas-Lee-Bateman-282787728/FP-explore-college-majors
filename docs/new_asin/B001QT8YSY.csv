8336255,4,B001QT8YSY,I thought it was good and well produced. Very informative and came with a bonus video on tanning animal hides.,1395014400,,110,4.55
8336256,5,B001QT8YSY,Good Video. Allan Probst always does a good Job with his videos. This is an informational video for trappers who already know some about the lifestyle. Not really a begginers video but good none the less.,1330214400,,204,4.694444444444445
8336257,4,B001QT8YSY,"There are two dvd's in this bundle.  There is one hour spent on beaver trapping, another hour on racoon trapping, and two hours on cleaning skulls.  Overall it is worth the money for what you get. As far as trapping videos go, I would have to say the info and entertainment rates as average.  I have seen both better and worse, but most 1-2 hour videos cost $25-40, so once again, for the price it is a good addition to any trapping library.",1317600000,,441,4.289156626506024
