8162987,5,B000LPG5X0,"I used this DVD to introduce guitar to my son. It took us  about a month to work through but after that my son was so excited bc he  was able to play so many simple 3 cord songs. My son was so motivated to move on and learn more. I also loved how calm the author was when explaining concepts. He introduced different styles - classical, rock, country which I thought was very educatinal. Also, he went over some basic theory. It was all well put together and  I would recommend this Dvd!",1363132800,,487,4.159574468085107
8162988,2,B000LPG5X0,"For Christmas I got my 9 year old son an electric guitar.  I also got him this DVD.  It started off by telling you the different parts of the guitar.  After that you were trying to follow him playing a song.  My son was confused right off the bat.  It did not focus on the very basics like how to hold the guitar properly, telling you that you have to push the strings down hard to make it work.  The correct way of pushing the strings down.  So now I am looking to find another dvd.  I would tell you not to buy this one.",1198540800,19,522,3.9047619047619047
