The music sound track for the first half of the movie is not good but you still know it is Ann Sothern singing and the spoken parts are fine.  I found Maria Gambarelli's ballet dancing lovely , Bill Robinson and Jeni Le Gon a joy to watch, and Ann Sothern and Gene Raymond fun.  The more times I watch this movie the more I appreciate the showmanship of Fats Waller!!  Of course the great Dorothy Field's song lyrics and the wonderful tunes make this movie in my opinion a must see for those who enjoy vintage songs.  These songs are so full of good melody even the faulty first half of the sound track can't ruin them!!  I feel very lucky to have found this movie!!",1427846400,,770,4.204081632653061

8518677,3,B007K7IB0W,"Fair story line, but whoever told Ann Sothern she could sing?  I found her voice annoying at best.  Robinson  and Waller made the movie a must see.",1386115200,,147,4.37037037037037
8518678,4,B007K7IB0W,"For a movie that was made nearly 80 years ago, I was pleasantly surprised with the picture and sound quality on this DVD.  While the movie has a rather conventional plot, the musical numbers are excellent, including several songs by Ann Sothern (who was a big musical comedy star in those days, which may surprise baby boomers who only know her from her sitcom roles of the '50s and '60s (PRIVATE SECRETARY, THE ANN SOTHERN SHOW)).  The highlight of the film is a production number, ""Living In A Great Big Way,"" which features Fats Waller, Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson, and Jeni Le Gon.  I don't know much about Miss Le Gon, but I understand that she was one of the best tap dancers of that era (which is displayed to excellent effect in the film).  She also had an uncredited bit part as Ann Miller's maid in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Easter-Parade-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0007939MU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Easter Parade (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>.

While this film is rather short - only 72 minutes - it is very entertaining.",1353715200,2,1085,5.434523809523809
8518679,3,B007K7IB0W,"A lot of fluff with little acting capablility EXCEPT for the production number featuring Bill Robinson, Jenni, and Fats Waller which makes the whole watching experience worthwhile. Too bad it doesn't last longer.",1336348800,3,212,5.454545454545454
