2966912,5,B000WCN8RS,"I'm home with a little one that likes to take short naps, so I needed a workout that I could fit into a 30-min window.  This one is great!  I love Karen Voight, and this one is my new favorite.  It's cardio, but has a heavy emphasis on lower body toning with lots of squats.  A definite keeper.",1204329600,17,294,4.017241379310345
2966913,5,B000WCN8RS,"This is a great little aerobic workout. It's 30 minutes long as follows: Warm Up - 6 min (a stand-up warm-up that gets you moving right away), Cardio 1 - 10 min (kickboxing flavor), Cardio 2 - 10 min (side, front & back lunges with lots of upper body movement and plyometric impact optional), and Cool Down - 4 min (pure yoga stretching).  Karen's instruction is clear as always, and I found this one easier to follow than most.  Only if you've never done aerobics before will you have trouble with this one.",1201132800,39,508,4.451612903225806

8222594,5,B000WCN8RS,"I have two young children and one baby. I am a big cardio person, and sometime don't have the time to get a long cardio workout, this dvd definitely gives you a great cardio workout in a short amount of time. The moves are simple and can be modified for a more or less intense workout. I just did the workout a few minutes ago and I'm a definitely sweating.",1338940800,,357,4.114285714285714
8222595,2,B000WCN8RS,"Was extremely excited about getting dvd, especially after reading reviews. However, after it arrived and I tried it out, was very disappointed.  It was hard to pick up the moves, and seemed to hurt my joints. I am an avid fitness person, work out 5-6 days per week. This did not impress me.",1262822400,,290,4.471698113207547
8222596,5,B000WCN8RS,"I am 26 years old and work out 4-5 times a week. I was doing Barry's Bootcamp and found it effective, but also tiresome and boring after a while. I've done the Leslie Sansone videos and I enjoy them, but was looking for something a little tougher that would give me a harder workout. I think Karen is AWESOME. She has a great attitude, the music is fun, and you actually feel like you're in a class with her. You can tell there aren't a bunch of edits to keep everybody sweat-free and pretty, which I think is perfect for an exercise video. I also felt very energized after the workout. It's a very quick pace and she breaks up the cardio into two sections, so if you're new to it, you could only do one section in between the warm-up and cool-down until you're ready for both. This is my first Karen Voight DVD and I think it's awesome!",1258329600,,837,4.2375
8222597,4,B000WCN8RS,"i love karen voight.  i like her attitude.  she is not sugary sweet like some instructors.  just energetic and encouraging.  this dvd is really good.  it is what it says: quick (just under 30 min) and will make you sweat!  this dvd has some high and low impact options.  the yoga-inspired stretch at the end feels great!

sometimes her cueing can be a bit last-minute, but once you have done the dvd once or twice, you don't need any more cues than she gives.  i feel that is her style in most workouts.

the choreography in this one is a bit more sports-inspired rather than the usual dance moves that she usually incorporates.  it is a great addition to a karen voight collection.",1251158400,,682,4.463414634146342
8222598,4,B000WCN8RS,This work out is quick and gets the job done in a short amount of time.  The moves target the large muscles and provide a excellent workout.  I can see and feel the results right away.  Excellent Purchase !!!,1229299200,,208,4.282051282051282
8222599,4,B000WCN8RS,Karen Voight once again provides a no non-sense type of workout which can have some slightly complicated choreography in parts but you do catch on after a few tries.  I wish there was a bit more to it but it works for me when I do the low impact version with ankle and wrist weights when I am short on time.,1222041600,,307,4.032786885245901
8222600,4,B000WCN8RS,"Although some of Karen's combinations are challenging and take some practice, I love how high energy this low-impact workout is.  I have back problems (so I can't take all the pounding that high-impact involves), and it's just what I needed!

Karen keeps your heart rate up and is very encouraging and positive, without being too ""peppy"" or fake, which I really don't like in an instructor.  She actually sounds very calm and patient during the whole workout.  I liked that.

She does try to start each combination out by adding moves gradually; lets you practice legs and then add your arms.  I'm kind of uncoordinated, though, so I can see that it's going to take a bit of work for me to master all of the moves.

But that's ok!  I'm alone in my living room, so if I get confused, I just keep moving to maintain my heart rate and jump back in when she starts a new set.  I've got no one to impress--I just want to get fit!

Even if you're a beginner, this is a challenging tape that will carry you for a months.  Just keep moving, and know that you'll master her combinations eventually!",1219449600,4,1089,4.422110552763819
8222601,2,B000WCN8RS,"What concerns me about this video is the intensity with which Karen starts out at and ends with.....she goes from heart pounding cardio, into a dead stop to start the cool down which consists of a few yoga moves and that was it.

Is this really safe? I'm used to exercise videos where there's a gradual increase in intensity and a gradual decrease in intensity at the end.

Also, some of the footwork was confusing and she doesn't cue well.  While this is technically a beginner's workout, I wouldn't recommend it to ANY beginners I know.  I consider myself at an intermediate level and just did not like this DVD at all!",1216684800,12,621,4.517857142857143
8222602,5,B000WCN8RS,"This is a great, short workout with absolute perfect instruction & form from Karen Voight.  I have her Burn & Firm, which is circuit training and love it as well.  The cardio flows well, and it really gets the heart rate up.  I am in good shape, and feel that this dvd can be beneficial to everyone - no matter the level.  I love how she incorporates arms into the movements, making low-impact aerobics VERY effective. I do agree with one reviewer that she goes straight  into the stretching RIGHT after you finish a heart pumping squat jump section, however, there is a quick break in the dvd that alerts you that the cool-down is about to begin...I pause it for about a minute while I march in place to cool down a bit, and then move on with the stretching... no big deal. Other reviewers have already offered a breakdown of the dvd, so I will just say that this is definitely worth the purchase ~ Karen is awesome, one of the best instructors around.",1214352000,17,953,4.392045454545454
8222603,5,B000WCN8RS,"Great workout for toning and strengthening the arms, abs and legs.
I had results after just three workouts, feel stronger and energetic.
I don't need that afternoon nap anymore.  I look forward to doing the workout.",1210464000,7,215,4.972222222222222
