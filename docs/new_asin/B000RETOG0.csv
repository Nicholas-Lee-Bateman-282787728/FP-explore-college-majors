2865026,5,B000RETOG0,The only thing I did not appreciate about this movie was that it never made it to theaters.  This was a great movie with a fresh idea.  I believe with larger budget this movie would have been a box office favorite.,1287014400,2,214,4.195121951219512
2865027,4,B000RETOG0,"By conceiving a child via artificial insemination, hip, modern and thoroughly independent magazine writer Julie Davidson managed to trim the messy nuptial relationship strings so often attached to starting a family. Imagine her shock, then, when her now-six-year-old son, Jason, demonstrates his growing need for a paternal role model by misbehaving in school. Julie soon sets out on a quest to find the original sperm donor youngish, self-effacing actor Paul, hoping he will take some responsibility for Jason's awry behavior. Father and son do indeed forge a strong relationship; but in Julie's wildest imagination, she never expected to fall in love with this new acquaintance. A fair number of halfway decent scenes and an overall feeling of goodwill, ""And Then Came Love"" is simply too slick, too contrived and too insubstantial to rank as anything more than just a negligible romantic comedy. I enjoyed watching the movie.",1266969600,,928,5.319727891156463
2865028,2,B000RETOG0,"Weak storyline, lackluster acting. I can not recommend this film, even if you do Like Vanessa Williams. This was not her best film.  She's a much better actress than this films allowed. Very predicatable plot, a yawn.",1266364800,,217,4.864864864864865

Julie (the lovely and appealing Vanessa Williams) is a writer and a single mother who conceived her only child through artificial insemination.  When the boy begins having trouble at school, she goes in search of the anonymous sperm donor to find out if the man was really the Ivy League genius he claimed to be on his application.  Naturally, meeting him leads to all sorts of personal complications and romantic entanglements, especially since Julie is already going steady with a well-meaning executive who, in spite of all his protestations to the contrary, is actually every bit as commitment-phobic as she is.

Despite a fair number of halfway decent scenes and an overall feeling of generosity and goodwill, ""And Then Came Love"" is simply too slick, too contrived and too insubstantial to rank as anything more than just a negligible romantic comedy.  For even though the movie earns points for neither sanctifying nor demonizing its major characters, the set-up and resolution are far too formulaic and pat to be taken very seriously.  Moreover, the performances tend to be a trifle rough around the edges, except for the wonderful Eartha Kitt, who steals every scene she's in playing Julie's high-strung, intrusive, and hyper-critical mother.",1196380800,3,1258,5.172413793103448
2865032,5,B000RETOG0,"What a fun movie.  Although it isn't rated, it is a clean movie. NO Sex violence or cursing.  It is a romantic comedy about a career woman and her relationships with her mother, boyfriend and the father of her child.
The story is also color blind and could have been filmed with any ethnic group.
I saw this movie when it premeired in New York City.",1187222400,12,349,4.2727272727272725

8200208,3,B000RETOG0,"This was a general cute film film about a woman who had a career and chose to have a child rather then wait for a husband then later finds love. Basic story line, nothing spectacular but fun and of course it's great to see Ms. Eartha Kitt in film in her later years and she did a great version as the mother. Worth watching and like seeing shows that don't need all the nasty language and skin scenes that make up too many films today.  I like it very much. Ms. Williams is very talented and pretty as well.",1362787200,,507,4.121212121212121
