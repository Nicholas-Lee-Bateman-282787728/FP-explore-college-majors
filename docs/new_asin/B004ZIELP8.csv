8449790,5,B004ZIELP8,"As an anti-establishment art enthusiast and occasional art dealer of Calder, Dali etc, my take is that Con Artist is not a must-see for every artist and art class, but it is a very telling and compelling behind-the-scenes look into business savvy and PR that is the life blood of the commercially successful artist. Obnoxious and lovable Mark Kostabi is the starkly honest yet playful artist who generously shares the ingredients and recipe of his creative sausage factory, and is in turn rewarded with fame and fortune. While art lovers will largely appreciate it, art dealers and entrepreneurs may get the most out of this movie that exposes much of the business side of Kostabi's bustling little empire. The documentary hits the mark throughout as it steadily underscores the point that gifted virtuoso painter and charlatan may be one and the same.  --  Corey Chambers",1523318400,,872,5.006896551724138
8449791,5,B004ZIELP8,"Making the decision to show Con Artist as a Joy Film Event was a hard choice. While I was confident my marketer friends would enjoy Mark Kostabi's unique promotional antics, I wasn't sure how my artistic family and friends would like the documentary.

Questions I worried about: would my art-loving friends get up and leave? Would my artist mom (painter of over 1,000 oil paintings) be so appalled she would move to the back with my sister and talk, disturbing my guests? Would people ignore the film and just party?

Watching people watching Con Artist gave me a unique perspective on the documentary. Most of the crowd sat entranced with the movie. A few children got up for popcorn, but the adults were captivated. Even the few who did not like the arrogant Kostabi watched closely.

After the viewing, people gathered to talk about the man, the art, the marketing, and the controversy about Kostabi signing art he didn't create. We didn't need to encourage the discussions because everyone wanted to talk about the movie experience.

What makes a good movie? Pure entertainment, escape, controversy, comedy, outrageous antics, a good story, interesting scenery, uplifting emotions, exploring new ideas, or just giving us something to talk about? Con Artist gives you all these experiences and lingers in your thoughts.",1364601600,,1322,5.0504587155963305

So this is a GREAT movie. It makes you think.

The story of a man who sees the world from his own eyes, just like the rest of us. Not many people like the guy, nor applaud his values. Yet what does he do to hurt anyone? Is the art he causes to be produced thoughtless? Not really. Is it worth looking at?  Not in the traditional sense of personal labor evoking magic. Yet skilled human hands are employed, just as they were by the old masters. Not THAT skilled perhaps, but the artist makes no such claims. Many artists and critics similarly revile Andy Warhol and his Factory works.

Many of the work I have been privileged to do, all over the world, have been executed and put up by 100's of hands that were not my own. I believe in the visions that drove my concepts. Maybe Mark Kostabi does too (?).

Kostabi sells his works for a fortune while costing little, much like a production line. He, like Robin Hood, sells to the rich. No one else can afford him.  The same can be said about my own works, except they cost a fortune to produce with little thought of, or room for, profit. Yeah, the guy is an ass, a common enough trait, not relevant. Or is it?

Visually the film is just as clever as Kostabi is convinced he is. A telling comment from the Cinema v&eacute;rit&eacute; style commentator: ""Kostabi thinks he is making this film"".

Worth seeing more than once, I highly rate this film.

8449793,4,B004ZIELP8,"A rocket climb to financial success, then sudden changes in public demand, then hand picking the best ""talent"" as slaves rather than ""partners"" then far far too much similar material.  The tastemakers and gatekeepers of the art world mostly missed the boat on Kostabi.  5 or 10% of his work is undeniably great.",1345075200,3,311,4.849056603773585

8449795,4,B004ZIELP8,"This is an entertaining, funny insight into the mind of a crazy artist and the equally crazy art world of the late 80's.. I saw it at Tribeca Film Festival where it wowed the crowd. As much a time capsule as affectionate critique of contemporary culture... Dali-esque showmanship meets New York fame rollercoaster.. Well worth the ride.",1313712000,3,336,4.912280701754386
