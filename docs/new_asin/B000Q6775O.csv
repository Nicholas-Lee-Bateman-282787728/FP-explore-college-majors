2831838,4,B000Q6775O,"To start with: Yes, definitely, one star gets taken away for the missing episode.

Return now to the City and its mighty but brain-addled sworn protector in THE TICK VS. SEASON TWO. Another season on the small screen, it seems, hasn't mellowed the indestructable but half-certifiable blue superhero. His patrols still cause vast structural damage to the city's rooftops, and he combats evil with the same brand of indomitable good cheer, incoherent speeches, and, oh yes, superstrength. In its entire series, Ben Edlund doled out a total of 36 spoofy and witty episodes. THE TICK VS. SEASON TWO offers 12 of these. But just as THE TICK VS. SEASON ONE withheld one episode (""Tick vs. the Mole Men""), SEASON TWO repeats the offense, denying us ""Alone Together."" The dirty rats.

Still intact are all the cleverness, the inventive spins, the surreal leanings, and the quirky humor. Tick's universe is a fabulous one, which merrily lampoons a whole lot of things superheroic. Plenty of smarts in the show, as we witness evil hand puppets who quote Sophocles and penguins who are discerning haiku critics. We're exposed to the speed of lint, which is way faster than the speed of light. Arthur finds love. As does Der Fledermaus, even if, in his case, it's ephemeral. And we find out the function of Tick's antennas.

I must say that Rob Paulsen, who this season plays the put-upon Arthur, does quite a job as he provides the consistent grounding voice in all this nuttiness. But the Tick, dementedly idealistic and brimming with righteous bombast, is as oblivious and off the wall as ever. And voice actor Townsend Coleman, with his exuberant, over-the-top delivery, works hard to keep it that way. Now that's one cat who really gets his character. What other superhero engages in a breath-holding contest with a dolphin? Or patrols the City with a plank for a sidekick? Or demands to be probed by space aliens? Or lays an egg? Only the Tick.

Present and sometimes assisting the Big Blue Bonkers in his fight against injustice (but mostly hanging out in the diner like losers) are the preposterous Der Fledermaus and the Rain Man-inspired Sewer Urchin. Admittedly, American Maid is pretty reliable and deadly with a shoe. As for the even more peripheral crimefighters, for some reason, I have a fondness for the Decency Squad's Living Doll, whose battle cry is ""I'm full of tinier men!"" But, for my money, the grossest superhero award just has to go to the Visual Eye (yech!). Meanwhile, villains El Seed, the Terror, and Brainchild return, even as we greet for the first time the porcine-infested Deadly Bulb and the Splendid and Perfect Queen of the Ants, whose name is Betty.

The TICK remains one of the most quotable animated superhero series ever. Some of my favorite Tick-isms in this season are: ""Honk if you love justice!"" and ""Evil's out there making hand-crafted mischief for the swap meet of villainy."" But, of course, you can't beat the Tick's battle cry, the classic ""Spoooon!""

Here are the Season 2 episodes:

Episode 1 - ""The Little Wooden Boy and the Belly of Love"" - When his moth sidekick Arthur falls in love, will the Tick just whittle away?

Episode 2 - ""Alone Together"" - This is the missing episode and it's a good one (dammit!). Tick goes to the moon and ends up pulling grooming duties for Omnipotus, the gigantic devourer of planets. Back in the City, with the Tick absent and thought dead, Arthur sidekicks for Die Fledermaus and Human Bullet.

Episode 3 - ""Armless But Not Harmless"" - When the evil Venus is foiled by Plungerman (actually just a regular plumber, mistaken for a superhero), she is snubbed by the Annual Enemy Awards show. To impress the Enemy Awards, she has her lackey apply his invention which causes the arms of the Tick and Arthur to fall off. Arms which are then used by Venus to commit crimes. Cameo by the insanely cool The Evil Midnight Bomber What Bombs at Midnight.

Episode 4 - ""Leonardo da Vinci and His Fightin' Genius Time Commandos!"" - The androgynous Mother of Invention kidnaps the famous inventors of the past. It's up to Leonardo da Vinci (and the Tick) to save the day.

Episode 5 - ""Coach Fussell's Lament"" - Charles the Brainchild returns and transforms the Tick into a two-headed bluebird that speaks only in high school French.

Episode 6 - ""Bloomsday"" - El Seed steals the 400 Year Bloom, a plant that requires constant soothing with gentle music, else it'll bloom ""the bad way."" This forces the Tick and American Maid to serenade it.

Episode 7 - ""Evil Sits Down For a Moment"" - The focus is on Die Fledermaus as he falls for a villainess. Meanwhile, Tick falls a great height and begins to talk in a British accent. Oh, and now he wants to addressed as ""Duchess.""

Episode 8  - ""Heroes"" - This one's a send up of the TV show COPS. A camera, belonging to the reality show ""Heroes,"" films a day in the life of the Tick and Arthur. Just as it seems there's gonna be a lull in villainy, Deadly  Bulb shows up to make it interesting.

Episode 9 - ""Ants in Pants!"" - At Captain Sanity's Superhero Sanitarium, the Tick undergoes therapy as he discloses an awful day involving ants in trenchcoats who've pilfered the City's window glass.

Episode 10 - ""The Tick Loves Santa!"" - The evil Multiple Santa is running amok and unchecked because the Tick just can't bring himself to hit Santa.

Episode 11 - ""Tick vs. the Big Nothing"" - Hilarious episode! The Tick and Arthur are abducted by aliens whose language consist of only one word (""what""). The kidnappers want the Tick to infiltrate the mothership of a hostile alien race called the Heys - whose language also consists of only one word (can you guess?) - and deactivate a doomsday device.

Episode 12 - ""Tick vs. Reno, Nevada"" - When the Nevada-based performing porpoise Monsieur Smartypants is abducted, Tick is asked to get him back. But when he ventures to Reno, he is seduced by the gambling bug.

Episode 13 - ""Grandpa Wore Tights"" - A great episode, my season's favorite. The hoary and decrepit Terror sends his angst-ridden son Terry to the equally-aged Decency Squad's retirement home to sniff out info about an ultimate weapon, the Desire-O-Vac. When Terry coaxes 'em into talking about superweapons, he hears this comment: ""The Ray Gun was the worst. One blast from that sucker turned half the town into a guy named Ray. And then there was the Tommy gun...""

This 2-disc collection presents 8 episodes on Disc 1 and the final four on Disc 2. Huge, huge disappointment, though, as there's nary a whiff of a special feature, although we do get a lithograph insert of the Tick which reveals on its back our hero's erstwhile secret identity and civilian job. So, that's something. But, still, damn...",1188172800,10,6721,4.731394354148845

MISSING EPISODES!!!!!!  Once again one episode is exempt, making this an incomplete set.  No reason was given.  I do not buy the copyright infringement rumour as parody is very legal.  Every character on this show is a parody of an earlier character.  This is a five star show and I cannot give it more than three for not giving fans what they want: the whole series.  Shame on the makers of this dvd.",1186876800,53,571,4.371428571428571
2831841,4,B000Q6775O,"My only hesitation in strongly recommending every season of the Tick is the  possibility that Buena Vista is deleting episodes from each season for the simple reason that they want to release a ""complete series"" box set after they are done with the seasons -- and they want to be sure that true fans will buy it all again by holding a few episodes back. This possibility presents itself because the seasons are available (or will soon be available) in the UK from a different distributor with no episodes missing, which might mean that Buena Vista is not being forthcoming with the truth behind the missing episodes here in the US. Despite the possible evil, it still makes the most sense to buy this US edition, even if it is missing one of the key episodes.",1186704000,4,759,4.580882352941177
2831842,5,B000Q6775O,"I can still remember the day that my best friend introduced me to this cartoon show. I was amazed. At the age of fifteen, I had no idea how much brilliance could be packed into 22 minutes of animation until I saw The Tick. Season one was fantastic but by the time Little Wooden Boy and The Belly of Love aired as the season 2 premiere, I was completely hooked...and sore from laughing.

While the quality of the animation hints at the show's low budget, it is completely effective and enjoyable to look at. It has a warm and quaint hand-drawn quality that is sorely missing from today's CG aided shows.

The characters in this show are absolutely marvelous. Some are clever satires, others are utterly and hilariously original. The voicework by Coleman and others is absolutely top notch.

The lack of Alone Together is indeed a sad thing for this set. Unlike the Mindy Moleford episode that was omitted from the season 1 set, this episode was one of the best and an essential piece of Tick history.
It would also be nice if the publishers would see fit to have more special features...but as all Tick fans know, we should feel lucky to be getting episodes on DVD at all. We'll probably never see anything better.

I considered knocking a star off of my rating for this set (because of the sorely missing episode and lack of features) but the show is just so devastatingly wonderful, I couldn't make myself do it. It really deserves 5 stars.",1186617600,6,1441,4.552123552123552
2831843,3,B000Q6775O,"Looking for something different for your kids? This probably isn't it. Though more clever than the cartoons in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tick-Vs-Season-One/dp/B000FS9MVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tick Vs. Season One</a>, the twelve episodes in this set still suffer from poor pacing and limp storytelling. Edited down to 7-minute cartoons they'd be great, but as 21-minute programs they really drag. And that's a shame, because with better writers this odd, witty series could have had a timeless appeal. Back in the mid-1990s ""The Tick"" aired for three seasons on the Fox Kids Network. It had the potential to last a lot longer.

At least that's my take. But to be fair, if you liked Season One you'll love Season Two. The 1995-1996 season of ""The Tick"" is probably the show's best, as the premise is still fresh but the characters are fully developed and the storylines wackier than ever. One episode features the villainous Ottoman Empress controlling an army of furniture. Another is a Christmas show.

On a different note, watching this set I couldn't help but think that many Disney creative-types must have been fans. Its premise -- that superheroes are real people -- showed up a decade later in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Incredibles/dp/B00005JN4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Incredibles</a>&nbsp;and a gag in the episode ""Heroes"" seems to have inspired the Walt Disney World attraction Sounds Dangerous.

2831844,5,B000Q6775O,"I'm like all of you. Where the heck is the 15th Episode? Now I don't know why they cut that episode out; but I'm not going to worry myself over it. The only explanation I heard is the legal issues excuse.

Despite the one episode short, I really enjoy season two; but I brought it from Walmart for $24 dollars. Not $34 dollars or more Amazon was seeking. I was shocked and thought: ""Surly you don't expect your customers(especially The Tick fans) to pay that much money for two dvd set animated series.""

As for the missing episodes! We can only hope that they will make it up to us by putting them on the dvd and named it: ""The Tick's Missing Episodes.""",1186444800,2,654,4.308943089430894
2831845,5,B000Q6775O,"Let me start off by saying that I know how everyone feels.  I agree.  ""Alone Together"" was one of the best episodes of the season, and for me, the only one that's better is the one where they fight against the dolphin with the fish magnet.  The lines, ""You call that a haiku?  You're just counting syllables!  Get back in the water!"" are burned into whatever part of my brain controls joy.  Really, I understand your anger.  But please, don't take it out on this DVD set, because it's not the DVD sets fault.  This is a Walt Disney Studio's problem, and we should definitely blame them, and write them letters, and moan at them until they give us what we really want.

But support The Tick.  And here's why.  If sales of this DVD are poor, then the execs over at Walt Disney are going to decide that they failed because people weren't interested in the content, because they don't want to blame themselves.  Studio execs get paid enormous salaries, all based on the idea that they don't make mistakes that cost the company lots of money.  If they make that mistake, they will find something else to blame.  It's what they're good at.  It's why they still have their jobs, even with all those atrocious movies Disney's been peddling for the past few years.

So yeah.  It stinks that this set doesn't have Alone Together.  It really does.  But if we want to give The Tick a chance for a truly complete collection, a collection that the studio execs are going to be willing to go to bat for, to fight for the rights to all the episodes for, then we have to prove to them that it's going to be a hit when it happens.  Support the Tick.  If not for you, then for me.  Because this show epitomizes everything that I love about what comics can be, what television can be, and what true heroism in the face of horrid cynicism can be.  Fight for the Tick, cause he'd damn well fight for you.  Spoon, baby.  Spoon.",1186358400,66,1904,4.356125356125356
2831846,3,B000Q6775O,"Of course I love the Tick! Arthur too! But I cannot believe they're doing this again! How can they leave Christopher McCulloch's smash-bang episode Alone Together off the DVD? It has to be a tie for the best episode in this season! (Tied with The Tick vs the Big Nothing) Heck, I'll be honest, it probably is THE best one.

This is Vs. The Mole Men all over again. No Cindy Crawford look-a-like in this one so what excuse shall we get this time? Can't do it because of the Galactus spin? Well, it seems the the Impossible Family over at VB made it onto DVD okay. Er, okay as they can be, I suppose.

Oh, I can't wait for season three! Let's see... no That Mustache Feeling, no Sidekicks Don't Kiss, no Devil in Diapers, no the Tick vs. Science... Oh, no... NO SPEAK!!! Well, maybe. Would they remove Speak's back story and still keep 'it all starts at the UN'?

I can't tell anyone NOT to buy this thing. Ben Edlund has like 8 (2) kids at home to put through college. I'm just saying... do not disrespect the McCulloch!",1181260800,13,1019,4.296875

Lets hope that when it comes time to release the shorter 10 episode 3rd season, the rights problems will be cleared and the missing episodes from seasons 1 & 2 will be included to make that a 12 episode set.

****UPDATE****
I found out that both omitted episodes from the season 1 & season 2 DVDs were written by the same screenwriter!  These were the only ones he wrote for those seasons.  Now I don't know for sure that he is the reason, this is just a common denominator of the two missing episodes.  DO NOT BLAME HIM THERE IS NO OFFICIAL WORD ON THIS!  This same screenwriter also wrote 4 of the 10 episodes for season 3.

2831870,1,B000Q6775O,"I loved the original comic books.  I love the live-action series.  I love this animated series.

Why the 2-star review?  These Disney/Buena Vista DVD releases in the US.  First, Season 3 was never released in the US (copies of it and of the complete animated series on Region 2 are long out-of-print and command high collector prices on Amazon UK and elsewhere).  Video mastering could have been better.

But, the biggest crime is omitting  ""The Tick vs. The Mole Men"" on the Season 1 set and ""Alone Together"" on the Season 2 set.

Why do this?  This is only a (conspiracy) theory, but it is backed by a bit of history.  Disney lawyers have always been tasked to be obsessive about stomping any 'perceived' copyright infringement to death. Do a search for ""The Uncensored Mouse"" comic book for just one example.

However, when the tables are turned, it appears to be quite a different story.  Or perhaps not?

Fox sold the Family Channel to Disney in 2001.  Under Fox, the Family Channel aired more than a few cartoons from the 1980's & 90's based on Marvel superheroes.  Marvel's deal with Family Channel stipulated that should Fox sell the Family Channel, all rights to air the Marvel shows revert back to Marvel.  Disney disagreed, and kept airing the shows, claiming that when they purchased the Family Channel, the rights to continue airing those Marvel shows were part of the purchase.  Marvel sued Disney.  Marvel won.

Now, on to The Tick animated series.

""The Tick vs. The Mole Men"" features Mole Men and Lava Men.  There is a Marvel villain known as ""The Mole Man"".  Marvel also has a separate race of bad guys known as the ""Lava Men"".  The characters on the Tick episode bear no similarity to those similarly named from Marvel, and even if they were, it is legal to parody another's copyrighted character.

""Alone Together"" features a world-devouring being known as Omnipotus, Marvel has a world-devouring being of it's own named Galactus, and it's quite clear that the one is an OBVIOUS PARODY of the other.

The theory is that the usually over-zealous Disney attorneys, still smarting from their defeat at the hands of Marvel's attorneys (for something completely unrelated), were afraid of another lawsuit from Marvel over Buena Vista's (a Disney company) DVD release of these two Tick episodes, either because they were unaware of the legality of parodies or by a conscious decision to avoid even the remotest chance that they would have to go back to court with Marvel over the matter of potential copyright infringement (which, if it had occurred, Disney would have won) perhaps because they may have feared being stomped upon as they had stomped upon others.

This is the most plausible reason why it was decided to not release these episodes on DVD (with a notice on each season set's box that the episodes in question were not included in those sets).

Those sets were released in 2005 & 2006 in the US.  Season 3 has never been released in the US.  I do not know if those missing episodes were on those sets released in the UK.

And for anyone who doesn't know, Disney bought Marvel for $4 billion in 2009.

Since they are now all one big happy family, there should no longer be any concern about any imagined copyright infringement (Imagined because the laws governing parodies are in effect here).

I think it's high time for Buena Vista to release EVERY SINGLE EPISODE of the Tick animated series on one remastered DVD box set.

And even though I have my own copy, they should re-release ""Dr. Syn: The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh"" for everyone else out there who wants a copy!

2831880,4,B000Q6775O,"Here in the desert wasteland of region one DVD, Tick fans are allowed almost all of Tick Season one, and with this DVD almost all of season 2. Each set is missing one episode. Exactly why this is true is pretty much in the hands of the conspiracy theorists. The most likely answer being: the folks who made the decision forgot why. Meantime there is a 3rd Tick Season over in England, but American sales did not justify a region 1 release.

It is my belief that if you splice together the two missing episodes , then reverse the polarity of the leads in the third season you get unedited proof that Jack Bower wasted a bunch of his twenty four hours, in every season, sitting on the can and reading The Shadow comic books.

The Tick continues to be the best in Hipster humor. The best lines are usually the throw away ones that may take an extra viewing or two to catch. Meantime we have a rerun of a number of the old villains. This is a tradition in the non-satire world of super heroes and in keeping with tradition, Tick faces off against villains who now have a personal grudge against the big blue guy. There are some new villains most noticeably the Swiss Commandos who have multi-tools the like of which us Victorinox fans can only dream. On the other hand, the Commandos have to keep explaining that they are villains and not agents of the Swiss government.

If there is a complaint against season it is the  tendency to fill episodes with The Tick going on longer Tick speeches about evil and goodness and the Valentine heart of love and whatever replaces having a full length comic adventure. Tick being who he is these monologues are barely coherent, which is the joke. This particular joke is over used.

My bottom line is that the total level of humor remains, mostly hipster, with just enough appeal to satire and `think a moment' humor that I enjoyed it. Tick Vs Season 2 is not for everybody. But if you ""Can Dig"", these are fun half hours.",1404604800,6,1957,4.440111420612813

2831903,5,B000Q6775O,"I am writing this review in an attempt to provide an as accurate and detailed as possible comparison between the animated version of The Tick and the live action series. Until recently, I had only ever heard of The Tick because the live action series was mentioned during the introduction to episode one of Family Guy Season 4. I never gave it another thought, until I learned of the existence of the animated version of this show as part of my on-going quest
to attempt to collect every series I can get my hands on that Rob Paulsen has done voice work for. After reading a number of reviews of both versions of this show, I realized that I simply had to add them to my collection. Because every DVD player in my home is region free, I elected to purchase my copy of the animated series from Amazon.uk, so that I'd be sure to get all 36 glorious episodes. I ggrew up watching You Can't Do That on Television and Dangermouse, and I've only recently discovered and added such gems as Pinky and the Brain, Animaniacs, the 1980's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Dangermouse's spinoff series Count Duckula to my DVD collection. Suffice it to say that I have always thrived on this type of silly yet surprisingly intelligent humor. According to nearly all of the reviews I've read, the live action version of The Tick seems to compare favorably with Seinfeld, another show which I've always liked quite a lot and am proud to own all nine seasons of on DVD, and now that I've watched through the live action version of the Tick several times, I would definitely have to agree that that comparison is quite an accurate one to make. Before I formally begin my review, however, I feel that it's only fair to warn you that I'm writing this review as a totally blind individual. So, I can't make any comments regarding
which show has better visuals; all my observations strictly pertain to the audio aspects of the show. OK. On to the review. I'll start by comparing and contrasting the four main characters which were featured in both the animated and live action versions of the series. Since the live action version of the Tick seems to be compared to Seinfeld so often, I will also make an effort to relate my character descriptions to that show as much as I possibly can.

The Tick is voiced by Townsend Coleman in the animated series and played by patrick warburton in the live action series. Both versions of the show's main character are simply phenomenal, but in slightly different ways. Both versions of The Tick make a lot of hilariously nonsensical speeches. Both are extremely silly and incredibly clueless regarding nearly all aspects of daily life, but it seems to me that the animated tick is slightly more worldly than his live action counterpart. Best example: in episode eight of Season 3 of the animated series, Tick is trying to encourage Arthur to kiss Carmelita. In the live action version of the series, Tick comes across as being utterly clueless about romance: trying to accompany Arthur on his date with Stacey and otherwise interfering with their relationship. Both versions of the Tick have a lot of truely absurd and unforgettable lines: ""Keen!"" ""spoon!"" and ""Arthur, honk if you love justice"" from the animated Tick and ""a secret message from my teeth,"" ""I am the wild blue yonder,"" and ""Wicked men, you face the Tick!"" from the live action Tick. One of my favorite scenes from the live action series is when Tick is talking to the toilet while he is attempting to clean/repair it. The only negative I can think of pertaining to either version of the Tick's character is in a scene near the beginning of the first episode of the live action series when Tick calls the coffee machine his b*tch, something which I don't think is at all necessary or appropriate, especially given the otherwise seemingly child-like, innocent nature of the live-action version of the character. Don't get me wrong. That particular line would have been even more shocking and inappropriate coming from the animated Tick, but it really stands out to me because of the way the live action tick is otherwise portrayed. If one wishes to relate the live action show's incarnation of The Tick to Seinfeld, in spite of his overwhelming stupidity, I suppose that Tick would probably be closest to Jerry's character if for no other reason than because he's the main character.

In Season 1 of the animated series, Arthur is voiced by Micky Dolenz after which Rob Paulsen takes over for the remaining two seasons of the series. David Burke plays the part of Arthur in the live action series. In my opinion, both Micky Dolenz and Rob Paulsen do a superb job voicing this character, but in spite of the fact that a couple of Arthur's funniest, most memorable lines occur in season one, I still have to give the slight edge to Rob Paulsen as he just does a slightly better job of bringing Arthur to life for me. To be perfectly honest, though, they actually sound so unbelievably similar to one another that there's a chance I might not have even noticed any difference between season one and the remainder of the series if I hadn't been specifically listening for the change after reading about it beforehand. I have a feeling that this is more likely than not the primary reason why I have so much trouble liking the live action version of Arthur. David Burke just doesn't sound at all like either Micky Dolenz or Rob Paulsen to me. I just can't help thinking that they should have tried a little bit harder to find someone who sounded at least vaguely similar to Arthur from the animated series. After watching a few episodes of the live action series, however, although I still couldn't forget about it entirely, I managed to more or less accept the all-too noticeable change in Arthur's voice. Never-the-less, for some reason which I still haven't been able to completely figure out, live action Arthur is still one of my least favorite characters from either version of the series. My feelings about live action Arthur are a little difficult to articulate, but I think the best way to describe the contrast between the two versions of the character is to say that at least in my humble opinion, animated Arthur is a lot more likeable. While you can tell by his tone of voice that Arthur in the animated series is often frustrated with, if not thoroughly annoyed by the Tick's stupidity and/or overenthusiastic manner, you can also clearly tell that the two of them are always a team, and that Arthur serves as the brains of the operation and does his best to look after Tick while also attempting to keep him at least moderately grounded in reality. On the other hand, in the live action version of the show, no matter how often they talk about it being to the contrary, I honestly can't sense any genuine teamwork vibe between Tick and Arthur. Live action Arthur seems to be a lot more demanding and argumentative, and he even comes across as being disrespectful, if not outright mean to Tick from time to time. More importantly, however, while Arthur in the animated series seems perfectly content with and secure in his role as Tick's sidekick, live action Arthur seems to deeply resent being labeled as just a sidekick, and we as viewers almost immediately begin to suspect that he has aspirations of some day becoming a full-fledged superhero in his own right. Finally, when it comes to worldly matters, I can't help thinking that live action Arthur may have been better suited to be pared with the animated Tick. Best example: in the animated series, it turns out that poor Arthur is too shy and/or nervous to kiss Carmelita, his supposedly steady girlfriend, while live action Arthur appears to be a lot more interested in trying to date, and it would seem that he is even hoping to possibly have sex at some point. Personality wise, I'd say that live action Arthur can best be compared to George Kostanza on Seinfeld, which makes it even harder for me to determine my reasons for not liking him. George is most definitely my favorite Seinfeld character, but I think the problem is that all of the personality quirks that make George so loveable to me just don't work in the context of Arthur's character. Besides, the animated version of Arthur is probably my favorite character from either series, so to be perfectly honest, it would be pretty tough for live action Arthur to compare favorably.

In the animated series, we have the character Die Fladermaus, who is voiced by Cam Clarke. This character is replaced in the live action series by a character named Batmanuel, a delightful pun which is reminiscent of those found in abundance throughout the animated series, who is played by Nestor Carbonell. It's not entirely fair to compare these two since they're technically completely different characters, but surprisingly, they're actually quite similar to one another. Both of them have huge egos, are total cowards and both seem to be a lot more interested in talking to women and making themselves look good than actually being superheroes. To continue the Seinfeld analogy, I suppose it would be accurate to say that Batmanuel is the Kramer of the group.

Last, but certainly not least, we have our female lead character. In the animated series, her name is American Maid, a spectacularly bad pun which would have definitely been right at home on either Danger Mouse or Count Duckula, and she's voiced by Kay Lenz. The live action series gives us Captain Liberty who is played by Liz Vassey. In my opinion, American Maid and Captain Liberty sound remarkably similar to one another, which only serves to add to my frustration regarding Arthur. I really like American Maid a lot. She doesn't take crap from anybody, and she somehow manages to keep Tick moderately focused in situations where Arthur has been kidnapped or is otherwise in danger. She's also quite a decent superhero. Captain Liberty strikes me as being quite a lot like American Maid in nearly all respects. I think the Seinfeld analogy can best be used here, however, because so far as I can tell, Captain Liberty seems to possess all of the best/funniest attributes from both American Maid and Elaine from Seinfeld.

Now that I've done my best to describe all of the main characters from both versions of this series, I'll try to compare the actual shows themselves. I simply can't think of any words to adequately describe the animated series in particular. The only way I can explain it is to say that it takes the hilarity of shows like Animaniacs, Count Duckula, Dangermouse, Pinky and the Brain and Monty Python's Flying Circus to a whole new level. It's so off-the-wall and uniquely original that there really isn't anything that I'm aware of that I can compare it to. It's pure silliness, and that is most definitely meant to be a complement. The humor is nonstop, but they always managed to keep it completely family friendly. Every single one of the numerous villains who Tick and Arthur encounter over the course of the 36 episodes of the animated series are just delitiously bizarre, and more often than not, they're spectacularly incompetant as well. In order of appearance, the most prominantly featured villains include: The Idea Men; Chairface Chippendale and his partner Chrome Dome; Dinosaur Neil; Mister Mental and his reluctant assistant Minda; The breadmaster; El Seed along with his helpers the bee twins and Rosebud; Evil Tongue Thrakorzog along with his creation the mucace tick; Charles the brainchild; the evil dictator Pokopo; Protoclown; The Human ton and his little friend Handy; The Swiss commandos; Omnipotus; Venus and her eager accomplice Milo; The Mother of Invention; The Ottoman empress; The Deadly Bulb and his assistants wat and socket; Betty Queen of the ants; The Fin and last, but certainly not least, the evil midnight bomber what bombs at midnight. Unfortunately, the only major villains mentioned in the live action series are the Red Scare, Apocalypse Cow and Destroyo. In all fairness, though, the live action series is intended to be more focused on the characters' down time when they aren't fighting villains. Both versions of the show do have episodes featuring The Terror, however, which I must admit is extremely awesome because he's definitely one of my favorite villains. One minor disappointment with the live action series, however,  is that they don't have counterparts to some of the animated show's other superheroes. I think that instead of introducing the superhero character Firey Blaze and his somewhat annoying sidekick Friendly Fire, it would have been far better if they could have shown us live action equivalents of The Sewer Urchin, the caped chameleon and/or the human bullet. Despite the many differences between the two versions of the show, there are also a number of aspects which both versions of the series have in common. The three most noteable examples of lines or situations that I can think of which both incarnations of the series share are when Tick sees Arthur's apartment for the first time, when Tick states that gravity is a harsh mistress, and to a far more limited extent, when Tick and Arthur meet up with Arthur's sister. I came across several other nods to the animated series scattered throughout the nine episodes of the live action series, but I think that half the fun of watching it is discovering these totally obscure references for yourself. Aside from its favorable comparison to Seinfeld, another positive thing I can say about the live action series is that its theme music is much better. As much as I love the animated series, its theme music is, to quote the animated Tick, ""just plain awful!"" Once it gets stuck in your head, it absolutely refuses to leave, and I think it would have been really cool to hear the animated Tick do an intro to the show similar to the one in the live action series.

I must confess that at first, I really disliked the live action version of The Tick. Even as similar as it was to Seinfeld: four main characters with lots of relationship issues, that still wasn't enough to make it worth watching at first. My initial impression was that although the live action version of the Tick had a number of laugh out loud moments, so much of its humor was clearly intended to appeal to an adult audience that I just had a lot of trouble getting into it. The animated series never found it necessary to resort to using profanity to make a joke. I even went as far as to sell my first copy of the live action series to a friend who was extremely happy to get it, but for some reason, I just couldn't seem to get the show out of my head, so I ended up deciding to repurchase it when I was lucky enough to find it in like new condition for less than half of its retail price. I'm not sure if there was something magical in my second copy having the pretty blue case which the live action series was originally released in, but for some reason, I absolutely loved it the second time I watched it. Even live action Arthur was significantly more tolerable to me than he had been initially. I think it also may have helped that I took the time to listen to all four of the commentaries which were available when I watched the live action series for the second time. I think that more than anything else, the information I acquired from the commentaries enabled me to understand and fully appreciate the live action series.

Bottom line: as far as I'm concerned, The Tick animated series will always be the definitive version, but if you're able to overlook the occasional swear word here and there, the live action series does have quite a lot to offer and is almost as enjoyable in nearly all respects. I would highly recommend both versions of The Tick, but if you can only afford to buy one, I would highly recommend that you start with the animated series first, and if at all possible, try to get your hands on the non-US version so that you don't miss a single second of the Tick's endlessly entertaining insanity. Then, if you're still craving more of the Tick's marvelously unique antics, proceed directly to purchasing the live action series. I can practically guarantee that you'll never regret either purchase.",1246233600,,16215,4.735314932767162

2831909,3,B000Q6775O,"The Tick is one of my favorite animated television programs.  A wonderful and hilarious send-up of the superhero genre, with plenty of both incisive satire and outright silliness.  Ben Edlund's comic should be required reading for all superhero comic fans everywhere; and the animated series captures it perfectly.  When the DVD was first announced, I was ecstatic.

Then Walt Disney/Buena Vista went and screwed it up.  Badly.  For starts, as many others have noted, there are missing episodes.  Like Season One, this set is also missing an episode.  However, unlike the first missing episode, generally regarded as one of the weakest; this one is one of the best espisodes of the series.  But enough has been said on this subject by others.  There are numerous other weaknesses with this release; which make it seriously disappointing, and rather overpriced.

The biggest is simply the incredibly poor quality of the transfer.  Having purchased numerous other DVD releases of old animated programs, I'm astounded at just how bad this transfer is.  Even on an ordinary analog television, the low resolution and high level of compression artifacts is painfully obvious.  It almost looks like they created the DVD, not from the original sources, but from some of the pre-DVD videos that have been floating around the Internet for years.  The sound transfer isn't much better, and is rendered flat and lifeless, although without obvious artifacts.

There are no extras to speak of, and it appears that they instead used all the space saved by the low-bitrate transfer to cram in a lot of extra advertisements that are extremely annoying to have to forward past to get to the show.

If it wasn't for the fact that this is likely to be the only offering of The Tick on DVD, and if The Tick wasn't as great a show as it is, I'd say don't bother with it.",1211328000,3,1848,4.853035143769968
2831910,3,B000Q6775O,"I loved the Tick when it originally aired, and went on to enjoy the comics as well. Season two contains some of my favorite Tick episodes, and it is great to finally see them on DVD.

If you love satire, screwball humor, or hilarious moral messages, you'll love the tick. This show kept spot on faithful to the Tick of the comics and brought him into an animated world that a character like him could really thrive in. This is entertainment great for kids and adults alike. I doubt you will be disappointed with the show itself.

The DVD however is another story in itself. Why they keep cutting out episodes is beyond me. The Mole Men episode from season one wasn't too much of a loss, but will hopefully be on an upcoming DVD. This season really lost a great one though. ""Alone Together"" is one of the best Tick episodes that aired, and it is completely missing from this collection. My only hope is that this episode, and possibly the mole man episode make it on to the Season Three DVD. This all is kind of strange to me. The UK seasonal DVD's contained all of the episodes. In fact, there is actually a three disk boxed set you can get on Amazon UK if you can play region 2 DVDs.

These DVD's also seem to be lacking any sort of feature. The story of how the Tick came to get published is certainly interesting enough to warrant, at the very least, a five minute featurette. Instead we get ads for unrelated shows.

Overall, above-par episodes, sub-par DVD. Let's hope The Tick Vs. Season Three redeems the seasonal DVDs.

2831911,4,B000Q6775O,"The Tick is still the gold standard when it comes to children's cartoons.  Unfortunately several problems plague this disc, which makes it difficult to recommend purchasing it, in spite of the high quality and sheer fun of the show.

In this season we learn all about the origin of Arthur's suit in ""The Little Wooden Boy and the Belly of Love"".  The villianous Venus steals Arthur and the Tick's arms and uses them on crime-committing robots in ""Armless but Not Harmless"".  Die Fladermaus falls in love with a villianess in ""Evil Sits Down for a Moment"".  The Tick and Arthur appear on a reality show, ""Heroes"".  And we meet an entire alien race that looks just like Arthur in ""The Tick vs. the Big Nothing"".  Of course, it is not the plots of the shows (summarised in other reviews) that is the fun of the show.  No, it is the absurd villians, the even more absurd heroes, and the Tick's social commentary (mostly unwitting) and head-shaking malaproposes that gives the show it's enduring charm.

For me, the highlights of this season are threefold - (1) the battle between our heroes and the Deadly Bulb, caught on camera on the reality show ""Heroes.""  It is especially fun for those old enough to remember Cops, as it is clearly meant to be a parody (or homage?) of that show.  (2) the introduction of Carmalita as a love interest to Arthur in ""The Little Wooden Boy and the Belly of Love"" - this subplot plays out more in Season 3, but it's fun to see the Tick become jealous of Arthur seeing someone else on craft night.  (3) My favourite episode of the season is far and away ""The Tick vs. the Big Nothing"" - two alien races are battling each other, one whose only word is ""what"" and the other whose only word is ""hey"" leads to a ""Who's on First""-like moment where the Whats interrogate Arthur,

Interrogator: ""Hey?""
Arthur: ""What?""
Interrogator (getting agitated): ""Hey?!""
Arthur (getting frightened): ""What??""
Interrogator (very angry): ""HEY!!!""
Arthur (bewildered and very frightened): ""WHAT!??!""

I guess it's funnier when you see it on the screen.

Unfortunately, all is not good in The City.  There are a couple of almost unforgiveable problems with this DVD package.  First is the lack of one episode, missing for no apparent reason.  Second is the lack of extras - there is absolutely nothing on the discs but the episodes and the ads, which is the third problem.  Yes, the ads.  They go on forever.  They cannot by skipped en masse (you can skip them, but each one individually).  It is DVD packages like this that drive otherwise honest people to piracy - it's like the makers of the DVD are punishing us for actually buying the discs instead of downloading them episode-by-episode from some file-sharing site.  Because the ads are at the beginning of disc one, someone like me who has to share his DVD player with 2 children (Thomas the Tank Engine and Bob the Builder keep appearing in it!) has to skip through the ads EVERY TIME he puts the disc in.
