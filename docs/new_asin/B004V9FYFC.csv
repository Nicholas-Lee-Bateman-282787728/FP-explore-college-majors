4482207,5,B004V9FYFC,"It's got action, romance, car chases, drama, Korean war gold, greedy evil rich people, kick-butt fight scenes, dirty double crossing all over the place, a great main storyline and several secondary storylines amongst other things.  The 3 mail lead actors have lots of action/fight scenes and they are awesome.  The actors did most of their own stunts and did an excellent job. Every episode moves along at a nice pace and doesn't drag like some k-dramas have a tendency to do.  It has a great soundtrack too.

I first saw this on Dramafever and decided that I needed to own the series.  The English subs on this are done very well.  It has a few nice extras.  About the only thing that I didn't like was the traveling KIM POH logo that shows up in every episode.  It was distracting at first, but after about the 5th episode, your mind blots it out. I recommend this series if you like lots of snark, with side orders of kick-butt action, comedy and drama.",1397433600,,956,4.517441860465116

4482209,5,B004V9FYFC,I really liked this show. Even if it didn't have Rain in it I think I still would've bought it in the end. The english translation is really good too.,1377820800,,150,4.033333333333333
4482210,5,B004V9FYFC,"Living in Vietnam, I caught some episodes randomly, but couldn't find the complete series on DVD.  But thanks to Amazon, I was able to order in the US and have a friend bring it back for me.  Still haven't had a chance to complete, but happy with the quality of what I have seen so far.",1376265600,2,286,4.089285714285714
4482211,5,B004V9FYFC,"Prior to the start of the series, Ji Woo, Rain, solves the case of a dead Asian couple in a single day and becomes famous for it. Shortly there after his best friend, Kevin, also dies. Now, jump to the start of the series and Jini, Lee Na Young, requests Ji Woo's help in locating Melchidec, who she believes is the person responsible for the death of her adoptive parents, the Asian couple. In order to get Ji Woo's help in solving her adoptive parents murderer, she tells Ji Woo she knows who killed Kevin. So starts the series in which both Ji Woo and Jini try to deceive each other all the while, they slowly start to fall in love. All this while trying to evade detectives Do Soo and Yoon So Ran, Lee Jung Jin and Yoon Jin Seo, and trying to keep from getting killed by Melchidec's men.

If you like plenty of action, drama, suspense, mystery and a little bit of romance you'll like the Fugitive: Plan B. This drama is kind of like an action romantic comedy. Two of the problems with buying one of these DVDs, that's not made by a U.S. company, are how good are the subtitles and how good is the picture quality. I'm happy to say both are great. I've got nothing to complain about the picture however, the subtitles (although great) does have some spots where they fly by faster than the speed of light. However, this few and far between and I've had no problems so far but I'm only on disc 3 of 5. Hopefuly the other 2 discs will be just as good. I have several Poh Kim DVDs and they all do pretty good on the subs with the occasional speed of light subs. However, nothing beats Blue Max copies of dramas as I've yet to experience anything wrong with their subtitles and they translate everything including the background notes and stuff. However, this is a mute point as Blue Max doesn't have the Fugitive and Poh Kim does. There is one other con to this set and that is there's no chapter stops. You can't skip past the intro or skip ahead. You'll either need to go the the main menu to get to another episode or fast forward through them.",1341532800,4,2047,4.289405684754522
4482212,5,B004V9FYFC,Really loved this show! It was one of the first Korean shows I had watched and have to say that Rain did an awesome job along with the lead female actress. Plus can't pass up watching Rain in anything. He's super duper yum!,1335225600,2,223,4.209302325581396
4482213,5,B004V9FYFC,Wow! I thought that this was going to be really goofy but it was very good.  I loved the action and for once the major character does not die.,1321401600,,142,3.896551724137931
4482214,5,B004V9FYFC,"If you're a fan of Rain you will enjoy this drama.  It is definately action-packed with lots of running and fighting and car chase. Probably the guys might like it better than the gals for the storyline and the gals will like  it for all the attractive actors: Rain, Daniel Henney and Lee Jung-Jin. Rain can be a cool, serious character in this drama and then he turns on his comic side so some scenes are hilarious.  It's like he doesn't want you to take him too seriously.  I think he's a wonderful comedy actor.  I'm an older female fan of K-dramas mostly  of the romantic genre but I really enjoyed this one maybe because Rain and lead actress Lee Na Young has a good chemistry. The action scenes had me gripping the chair and rooting for Rain to beat the bad guys. I found the English subtitling very good. It was helpful that Daniel Henney spoke English most of the time. I would recommend this drama to anyone who likes action/adventure/romance/comedy.",1306886400,9,959,4.546511627906977

8443102,5,B004V9FYFC,"FAST...FAST... OVER THE TOP RUNNING.  COOL CLOTHS.  INTERESTING CHEMISTRY BETWEEN BI RAIN AND LEE NAN-YOUNG - WE LIKED IT.  ALL ACTORS GREAT TO WATCH.  Yoon Son-ha is sweet, smart, and tough.  The kind of person you want in your corner. Her chemistry with the Lee Jung-jin character is great and funny.  Prefer this one to City Hunter.  Bi Rain is just more fun.  The shows are a bit different.  City Hunter is like the Batman story this one a funny Bourne Identity with the International players and high action fight scenes.  There is romance of course and historical treasures etc.  Glad we bought it.  Disc holder is plastic sleeve we had to replace it but everything else was great.",1450224000,,687,4.680672268907563

8443106,3,B004V9FYFC,I am a big Rain fan...but this is not one of his best.  I just wasn't expecting the silly comedy.  Still it was good enough to keep me watching and the second half was better than the first half.,1419811200,,195,3.9743589743589745
