8380299,5,B002TMTPO4,"Exactly what I was looking for to learn to properly teardown my grandfather's old Model 37. The video was very easy to follow and allowed me to break down the shotgun for a good 'deep cleaning' and then reassemble! This video was extremely helpful when it came to disassembly of the 'trigger housing' and the 'bolt/carrier assembly'. Good video close-ups when needed.

I am sure I will be ordering other videos from AGI for various firearms in my collection. In fact, I just ordered the armorer's course video for my 'Winchester 97' solid frame, pump shotgun! Finally, a valid resource that provides quality reference material for future use!",1435795200,2,642,4.944444444444445
8380300,3,B002TMTPO4,"The Ithaca Model 37 is an OK DVD.  As with many other AGI assembly/disassembly DVD's that I have watched, they give you allot of good information.  My problem is that some of the methods they use are deplorable.  Some of the things they do would work on farm equipment but are not the best for a precision firearm.",1362355200,2,314,4.379310344827586
8380301,5,B002TMTPO4,The Ithaca Model 37 is a Great DVD! Everything I needed and more! Very informative I would recommend this dvd to all interested in gun repair,1357603200,,141,4.461538461538462
