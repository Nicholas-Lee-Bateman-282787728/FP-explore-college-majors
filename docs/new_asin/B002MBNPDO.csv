8373806,5,B002MBNPDO,"These 2 discs sets have good picture and audio, though unlike the blue brick season set collections, they don't seem to be remastered. The picture has alot more grain and the colors are not as vibrant and bright. The audio sounds a little different too, but not all that much. These 2 discs sets contain english and japanese launguage uncut episodes, character profile extras, english subtitle. So if you could get these at a lower cost than the blue brick sets THEN GO FOR IT, blue brick season sets also contain same settings except for the and contains 5.1 surround sound, & textless songs witch the 2 discs sets do not have. I will soon own the whole series, dragonball is a great fun, funny, fighting action anime. 5 out of 5 stars for anime series and dvd release.

 Dragonball follows a young boy with a tail(seriously) named goku as he travels meeting friends and enemys along the way primarily seeking seven artifacts called dragonballs that when brought together can summon a great dragon named Shenron who will grant one wish to the one who gathers all seven dragonballs. On his journey he will encounter new foes and places he's never seen and train himself to become a great fighter and martial artist and fight the forces of evil.",1328572800,4,1244,4.675799086757991
