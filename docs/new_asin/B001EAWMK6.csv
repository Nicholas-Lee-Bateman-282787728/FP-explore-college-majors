8297295,5,B001EAWMK6,Not the very best but a great value as a whole. Relaxing with nice synth. music ...very soothing with the moving to and fro of the reeds.,1404345600,,137,4.111111111111111
8297296,1,B001EAWMK6,This video was drab and not colorful at all.  It was a disappointment.  This is seven more words in review,1313539200,,106,4.25
8297297,1,B001EAWMK6,"I was not impressed with this DVD at all. I returned it,even though you get little of the money back in actuality.
It had poor color & repeating scenes. My regular aquarium looks better than this video.
Try another one instead!",1298851200,,227,4.560975609756097
8297298,2,B001EAWMK6,"This is a nice dvd but it is more like a camera in the ocean.
It is not like a tropical ""AQUARIUM"" as I was expecting.
It also has many sections but I have not found a way to have just ONE section play and loop. It keeps changing and just looks like I have a Discovery Channel on, instead of an aquarium of fish....pity.",1283126400,4,320,3.9384615384615387
8297299,3,B001EAWMK6,"This is not underwater photography in the sea.  The aquarium discs are often repetitious with a limited variety of sea life.  The best disc of this type I have seen is ""SeaVisions.""",1278633600,,181,4.625
8297300,5,B001EAWMK6,"We love having this on while having company or just ourselves. It's something you can enjoy watching or just glancing at, perfect backround atmosphere. I want to get others for this purpose. So much better than the big black screen on the wall.",1277424000,2,244,4.6976744186046515
8297301,5,B001EAWMK6,"I recently saw a promo for this DVD on The Martha Stewart Show, and since I've always wanted an aquarium in my home.....I decided to order it. I received it over the weekend and I can truly say I was amazed at the incredible underwater footage captured. The footage on the DVD is not only beautiful and mesmerizing, but soooo incredibly relaxing. I actually took it to a dinner a friend of mine was hosting that evening, she popped in the DVD, played some music soft music in the background and it was the highlight of the evening. It definitely set the tone for the entire night.

If you're looking to get rid of your aquarium, or have always wanted one just like me but didn't think you could offered one - YOU CAN NOW!!! This is the DVD for you. I highly recommend it for everyone.",1272412800,6,784,4.333333333333333
