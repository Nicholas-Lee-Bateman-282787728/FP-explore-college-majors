8505321,5,B006W2CRVK,"How long has it been since Melrose Place was taken off the air? 13 years to be exact. That's how long it's been since my wife and I enjoyed watching television together. I discovered Kaseifu No Mita, pronounced Ka-say-who'n No Mee-ta, after subscribing to TV Japan while learning Conversational Japanese at a language school in the city. I was fascinated by the story but could only understand perhaps 20% of what was spoken (TV Japan has no English subtitles). I ordered this 3-DVD set from Amazon after an accidental encounter with a Japanese couple while my car was being serviced. They were so thrilled that I could introduce myself in their native language! We spoke in English afterwards and almost immediately we found ourselves talking about this TV Drama. The gentleman filled in a lot of missing information of the storyline. That night I ordered these DVDs from Amazon! The DVDs give you the choice of English or Chinese subtitles. I am very happy that I made this purchase. My wife and I are hooked!",1338163200,2,1011,4.782857142857143
