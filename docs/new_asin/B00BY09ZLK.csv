8575246,4,B00BY09ZLK,"Cloud Gate's choreographer has training in modern dance and t'ai chi. He blends both to create a style that is unique. His dancers are well trained and have a level of focus one rarely sees. There are moments of great stillness and others of explosive brilliance. Not everyone will like his work (duh!), but if you love dance, I urge you to take a look. They've got quite a few things out there.",1371859200,,395,4.424657534246576
