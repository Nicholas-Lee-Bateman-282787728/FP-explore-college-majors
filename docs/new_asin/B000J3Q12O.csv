8149077,5,B000J3Q12O,"I really enjoyed this film. It captures some awesome performances, some hillarious moments, and some performances that need to be seen/heard to be believed. Anyone who has sat a half hour through a band they didn't like will find this film refreshing. You don't like the band thats playing now? wait 2 minutes and laugh your way through it. There is no guessing what the next band will bring.

I really liked the whole feel of the film, everyone involved seemed very connected to eachother, and to the scene/enviroment they created. I felt echoes of my own town's local noise scene throughout. I would highly reccomend getting the film, getting some friends over, and watching the strangest show you've ever seen.",1176681600,,713,4.892561983471074
8149078,5,B000J3Q12O,"The only bad thing about Sean Carnage's rockumentary/ performance experiment is the feeling of regret you'll have that you didn't get to participate in this totally insane evening. 40 bands each given 2 minutes to perform- and these groups are some of the strangest you're likely to see in one sitting. Unsung luminaries like Whitman, Captain Ahab, and Gowns give (presumably) their feature film debuts while all kinds of other chaos ensues- including a man making a sandwich with his feet! Captures the fun and oddity of a night with the new weird underground, as well as providing a useful document/primer for anybody going to L.A. who likes bands on labels like Wantage, Load, and Bulb.",1176595200,,689,4.948275862068965
8149079,2,B000J3Q12O,"Boy, what a night. On one hand, you really feel the weariness of that night as this film chugs along; I feel for the young lady of Il Corral who worked the whole night keeping time and, somehow, her humor as she policed over fifty sets into the morning. Yet with some pretty fun editing, the youthful, awkward, playful personality and musical openness of the venue and its audience weaves in and around the various acts, quick interviews and intermissions.

As one would expect with so many performances, I found them rather hit and miss--some leave quite a mark, while others drag you through their two minutes as through broken glass mixed in mud. The good ones, though--and the idea of the thing--make this documentary worth sitting through... in not too inebriated or anesthetized a state, so you can make mental notes of the several artists worth looking up.

Sean Carnage and those who helped with this project did a professional job, remarkable considering the number of faces captured and the messiness and potential chaos of a semi-planned event at a semi-wild Los Angeles hole-in-the-wall. I suggest other cities join the fun; all-comer samplings like this should come out every few years.

Addendum:
Among the artists I particularly enjoyed, I recall:
- Captain Ahab - opening with the song/rant ""Punch Yourself in the Crotch as Hard as You Can""...
- Bizzart vs. Demonslayer - cheerleading chant to freestyle rap over huge buzzing, pulsing noise...
- I Heart Lung - baffling free-jazzish drum & guitar, puts a smile on my face...
- Nosajthing - perhaps my favorite set, fun, danceable electronic/laptop noise...",1176595200,,1622,4.977859778597786
