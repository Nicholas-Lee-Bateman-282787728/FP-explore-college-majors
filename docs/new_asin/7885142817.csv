7900333,5,7885142817,"Highly recommend both films ""MR73 / 36 Quai Des Orfvres"" for those who enjoy high-end, taut, realistic `police drama' thrillers with excellent dialogue, performances, cinematography, seamless film editing, and superb storyline continuity. The unpredictable nature of scenes in either movie, the sheer brutally within them, and the sense of `being put right into the deadly action where anything can happen' - all elevate these two `high voltage' films to be considered as Modern Classics in their right. Masterful cinematic work by writer/director (Olivier Marchal) and deeply moving, incisive performances by renowned French actors, Daniel Auteuil and Grard Depardieu in ""36 Quai Des Orfvres"" and by Olivia Bonamy and Auteuil (again) in ""MR 73""; accolades also to the fine cast and crew of each film for their polish, dedication, and professionalism.

Excerpt from ""MR 73"" movie review:

True heroines are borne not always from enflamed passion, but from a dire need to make things right. Excruciating memories haunt our heroine Justine Maxence in ""MR 73"" (2008, in French, aka ""The Last Deadly Mission"") to the point she can no longer tolerate the thought - that the human devil who raped, tortured, and then murdered her mother in front of her - while she was yet a child - then tortured and murdered her father - all done throughout the night - will be released from prison on good behavior.

This nightmare now encompasses her every thought. We wait upon her words. Her suffering ignites all levels of compassion and empathy for us. Her character is linked by a common plot thread to her drunken knight (a police detective who investigated her parents' murder many years before). Her unlikely garde du corps will protect her, her family, and her baby. But he has to exit his own hell first; he has to pick up the pieces of his dissipated life, visit his paralyzed wife once more, and finish his own investigation. This is serious plot tension for those of us who appreciate strength, precision, and depth in a movie thriller and tragedy.

We have the feminine soul in torment with the young pregnant woman Justine (brilliantly played by Olivia Bonamy). We have the masculine soul in torment with the self-destructing homicide detective Schneider (superbly played by renowned French actor Daniel Auteuil). In this graphic `investigating serial killings' crime thriller, replete with subtle nuances of plot progression, character depth (especially our two tormented souls), chilling acts of torture & murder - all encased in a tightly-woven storyline with the refined, artistic, assured hand of writer/director (Olivier Marchal).",1332720000,,2632,5.2004716981132075
