7005967,3,B00TF7KZ2W,"This 1974 film represents two important firsts - it is the first feature film Steven Spielberg has directed. It also happens to be the first film in which Spielberg collaborated with composer John Williams. Together, they'll end up creating many blockbusters in the years to come.

*** WARNING -- Plot Points revealed ***

The script is written by Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins from Steven Spielberg's story, which is based on true-life events that took place in 1969.

This is the story of a young couple creating a Texas-size chaos on the highways while trying desperately to get to their little son who could be given away for adoption if they are late. So at the end, no matter what they do, you can't help but identify with them because their intentions are so pure and understandable.

Lou Jean Poplin (Goldie Hawn the Lovely) helps her husband Clovis Michael Poplin (William Atherton) escape a Texas Penitentiary Pre-Release Center in order to kidnap their baby son left the custody of another family in Sugarland, TX. Time is ticking since if they are late, little Langston might be given away for adoption.

After conning a ride out of the prison in an elderly couple's car, the Poplins are chased by Texas Patrolman Maxwell Slide (Michael Sacks). Following a crash, they take Patrolman Slide hostage and push on towards Sugarland with Slide forced to drive at gunpoint.

But soon both the cops and the media realize that a state trooper is taken hostage by a fugitive and his wife. This opens the floodgates for a long and fantastic chase sequence full of mishaps and funny reversals.

Clumsy cops from all kinds of jurisdictions chase the trio. We are treated to the mother of all collisions when dozens of patrol cars crash into one another (a la BLUES BROTHERS) and temporarily lose track of the fugitives.

But they might be in for a nasty ending. We are allowed to follow the preparations of the sharpshooters, already positioned in the baby's home in Sugarland and who are waiting for Clovis to show up.

At the end, Spielberg treats us to a peaceful compromise. The fugitives are caught when their car gets stuck on a sand dune in the middle of a river at the Mexican border.

A light-fare entertainment carrying many of the trademark plot points that made Spielberg the successful director of such blockbuster action thrillers as JAWS and the JURASSIC PARK.

Goldie Hawn is a special delight to watch in her depiction of the goodhearted but scatter-brained mother who creates the mess she is in while desperately trying to save her son.

7005970,4,B00TF7KZ2W,"Oddly, when initially released, audiences ignored Spielberg's debut feature but the film demonstrates that by the time he'd graduated from television, he was in full command of the film making process. And, it's also a reminder that Goldie Hawn was a wonderful dramatic actress. One aspect of 'Sugarland' that I find interesting is how Spielberg populated the film with colorful non-actors and locals--something that he abandoned in his later work. But the gentleman who really centers the film and gives it dramatic weight is Ben Johnson who'd already won an Oscar a few years earlier for The Last Picture Show.  If you can ignore the fact that the plot has very little to do with the real story or that the geography of the setting is non-existent, sit back and enjoy the ride.
