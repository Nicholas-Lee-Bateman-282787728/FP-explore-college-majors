2838697,2,B000QGEB1C,"There were no scenes that were integral to the movie because ultimately it didn't have a coherent plot. Roselyn is beautiful and the dancing was amusing.

The movie wasn't about anything in particular but it could have been about:
1) Showing beautiful dancing
2) Struggling for stardom
3) Family troubles
4) Running away
5) Coping with tragedy
6) Or something else

The movie touched on a lot but failed to go deeply enough into any area to really fulfill its potential.

The ending was particularly unsatisfying with the arrival of the son, the relationship with the doctor, ... and everything else left unresolved and unexplained. It seemed to be one inexplicable occurrence after another.",1239408000,,691,5.043859649122807
2838698,4,B000QGEB1C,"This is a story about a young woman (Roselyn Sanchez) who moves from her native Puerto Rico to the Big Apple in hopes of becoming a dancer.  She was trained in ballet by her late father & wants to preserve his heritage by becoming a great dancer in her own right.

Along the way, however, reality sets in.  She needs to do something to support herself and she's unable to secure a job that pays more than minimum wage.  She lucks out by running into a friend (Billy Duke) who gives her a place to stay & acts somewhat like a father figure.  However, the ways in which he can help her are limited.

Eventually, when she hits rock-bottom, she is forced to consider being a stripper so that she can continue to pursue her dream of being a real professional dancer.  Now, at this point many will be inclined to say that a ballet dancer being a stripper would be like a concert pianist being relegated to playing the piano for a truck stop.  Well, yes & no.  The problem with this sort of analogy is that I've seen some exotic dancers in my time who were VERY impressive acrobats.

In spite of the plot line, there is surprisingly little nudity in this film;  we get just a few quick flashes of Sanchez in the buff.  For me, that was quite disappointing.  Still, as a movie it's far, far superior to other stripper movies such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Striptease/dp/B00000JGHS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Striptease</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dancing-at-the-Blue-Iguana/dp/B00005QJIG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dancing at the Blue Iguana</a>.  Somewhat surprisingly, the story doesn't even really portray exotic dancing as a sordid lifestyle.  In fact, the other strippers and even the nice-guy manager support Sanchez' character in her quest for greater things.

If you are at all into dancing, this film is a must.  Sanchez is a phenomonal dancer and she does several different styles in the film, from ballet to jazz dancing to pole dancing.  In spite of its content it is, as another reviewer remarked, a ""feel good"" kind of story.  Ultimately, it's not about working from being a stripper to a bona-fide dancer so much as it is about never letting go of your dreams.",1208649600,3,2279,5.1775956284153

2838700,2,B000QGEB1C,"The title of this film should be ""I Am the Great and Marvelous Roselyn Snchez"".  A self engrandizing film with a weak plot and terrible acting, I would save my money unless you are an all-out fan of Roselyn's.  If that is the case, buy it, and you will see her in all of her glory.  Most telenovelas are masterworks when compared to this melodramatic piece, which perhaps will turn you ""yellow"" from sheer distress.",1197417600,,415,4.506666666666667
2838701,4,B000QGEB1C,"Actress Roselyn Sanchez (best known as FBI agent Elena Delgado on ""Without a Trace""), began her career as a dancer, and as the producer/star of ""Yellow"", her acting and dancing skills lifts a somewhat routine plotline into an entertaining celebration of a multi-talented performer.

Daughter of an invalid ex-dancer/teacher, young Amaryllis Campos (Sanchez) has had to curtail a promising dancing career to support her parents and drug-dealing boyfriend as a pizza delivery girl in San Juan. When her father commits suicide, she takes a friend's advice and moves to New York City, where she befriends a mentally-ill poet (Bill Duke, who is excellent), and ends up becoming a stripper, until she can break into the 'legitimate' dance world. As she waits for her break, a patron (D.B. Sweeney) falls for her...but will she sacrifice her dream, yet again, to move to Australia with him?

If this sounds like soap opera, it is, but Sanchez's intensity and likable persona keeps things interesting, if reminiscent of ""Flashdance"" and ""Striptease"". Unlike the Demi Moore film, however, titillation is not the major goal of ""Yellow""; there is surprisingly little nudity (Sanchez only has one very brief nude scene, early in the film); what the film focuses on is her discipline and skill as a dancer, which is considerable!

The major pluses of the film (besides her dancing) are some truly beautiful views of Puerto Rico (which far outshines NYC in the film), and Duke's shaded performance, in support. Best of all, the DVD offers many deleted and longer versions of scenes, and a terrific interview with Sanchez, who discusses her long effort to bring ""Yellow"" to the screen.

""Yellow"" is certainly no classic, but if you enjoy dancing, or are a Roselyn Sanchez fan, you will be pleased!",1196985600,15,1782,5.051020408163265
2838702,2,B000QGEB1C,"The movie is about a woman, Amaryllis, whose dream is to become a professional ballet dancer, like her father was. But, she lives in a poor neighborhood in PR and once certain events take place (I won't give the movie away), she moves to the US to try to follow her dream. Instead, she ends up becoming a stripper and starts dating one of the customers of the strip club. She also meets a neighbor, who was a former university poetry professor, and who now is quite crazy. The movie was too disjointed and full of pointless characters (what is the purpose of the neighbor?!). The script was weak, the dialogue did not make sense and neither did the plot sequence. The plot did not present an opportunity for the characters to grow and somehow they did! This is one of those movies that an actor will regret having made.

I like Roselyn Sanchez, and I know she is a better actress that what she showed in this movie. I hope she chooses the next movie better.",1194393600,10,957,4.406779661016949
2838703,5,B000QGEB1C,"I'll be brief.  This is an excellent art flick.  Well written, exceptionally cast and acted.  Apart from a gripping script, the music and dancing are outstanding.  I watched it twice in one night, and I'm buying it now. You should do the same.",1188691200,2,243,4.5813953488372094
2838704,2,B000QGEB1C,"Alright it's not awful, but it's not likely to make my collection either. It's textbook cliche. Poor girl with crappy life in poor place (In this case Puerto Rico) escapes to find better life in the big city of NYC and to fulfill lost dream of her father. Struggles to find hope by working as a stripper hoping to make it big on Broadway some day, but meets nice rich doctor guy and fall's in love; however he is moving overseas and wants her to come just as she is getting her first big break. (What are the odds? ... 1:1?) Faced with the choice of either choosing the love of her man or the love of her passion of dance, she must decide. What will she do?

It's an tired story line that has been done to death in one way or another 100's of times before. The acting is fair at best, there are not awards in anyones future from this film. The is Roselyn Sanchez first attempt at writing and producing, likely to be one of her last too. She's a pretty women, but she's just not lead quality and while she can dance, Grace Kelly she's not, but few are. The supporting case was fair albeit at times they seemed to be walking through their scenes. Bill Duke who plays Miles Emory is by far the shining light here in the acting department as he played a washed up poetry professor now working in a plebeian job, but tries to hold on to his passion as well and acts as the wise old fool who guide the now lost way of Amaryllis Campos (Roselyn Sanchez). There are a few lose ends that don't seem to tie in anywhere else, but overall there is a story and a plot, even if it is predictable.

The DVD is a little skimpy on extras only deleted scenes and ""Roselyn Sanchez on Yellow"" a short promo for the film. Oh don't forget the previews, no DVD is complete without an hours worth of previews. Sound quality is ok, a little soft at times and only comes in 2.1 stereo.

Watch it if you want to, but don't feel like you are missing a lot if you don't see it. It's 'ok' at best and for that it gets 2 stars. I'd give it 2.5 if it was an option and 3 stars would be to mislead you. I don't think you'll feel ripped off or wanting your 90 minutes back at the end, but you not going to feel like you hit the movie lotto either (or a scratch off for that matter.) It's more of an 'Ok, I've seen it, now what?'",1187395200,2,2294,4.059602649006623
2838705,4,B000QGEB1C,"YELLOW may be fairly easy to dismiss as a soap opera story of little girl makes good despite a troubling journey, but the presence of Roselyn Sanchez is reason enough to see this little art film,  She has what it takes to make a film magic, she acts well, dances well, and creates a credible persona from a rather superficial script.

Based on a story by Nacoma Whobrey about the gifted daughter of a once famous male ballet dancer who leaves her native Puerto Rico in the grief of her father/tutor's death to find a better life in New York - the city where her father found fame.  Amaryllis Campos (Roselyn Sanchez) worshiped her famous father (Jaime Tirelli), learned ballet under his tutelage, then grew up in a home after her father's leg crushing accident, with a mother (Sully Diaz) and a live-in druggie boyfriend Angelo (Manny Perez), supporting her helpless family by delivering pizzas.  When her life falls apart one person befriends her - Hilde (Nancy Millan) - and provides her money to move to New York and a cousin with whom to live.

Once in new York Amaryllis finds the cousin's apartment occupied by a sweet old poet Miles Emory (Bill Duke) who allows her to stay. Finding work proves difficult until she signs on as a pole dancer in a sleazy nightclub. There she meets an emotionally bruised physician (D.B. Sweeney) who befriends her and who with the help of her new found friends finally makes her way back to the legitimate stage.

Yes, the story has been done before, but it is the pacing of director Alfredo De Villa that keeps the film pulsatile, and the shimmering screen presence of Roselyn Sanchez that makes this little film worth watching. Story 3, Performance by Sanchez 5. In Spanish and English with subtitles.  The additional features on the DVD are even more interesting than the script!

2838737,5,B000QGEB1C,"This movie was purchased for a friend who found herself in need of inspiration to increase her fitness level. Roselyn Sanchez portrays an aspiring dancer who move from her home in Puerto Rico to New York City in pursuit of a career in the arts. Most impressive about the movie is Sanchez's training regimen, her dancing skills, and the acting ability of Bill Duke. Duke delivers an Oscar winning performance as a poet whom suffers from mental-health challenges. The delicate and loving relationship that develops between the Sanchez and Duke characters is alone worth the DVD's purchase price. Yet, the aesthetics of Sanchez's body and her dancing skills make this film a prized possession. Purchase the movie and enjoy the story!",1392940800,,730,5.041322314049586

2838742,3,B000QGEB1C,"Ever since I saw ""Chasing Papi"", I wanted to find more movies with Roselyn Sanchez. I appreciate that this film was done in High Definition (well, the best you can get for DVD), but like everyone else has said, the story is kinda weak. Had this film been done with any other actress other than Roselyn Sanchez, I would have never giving this film another look.

But, this film has it's moments. It would have been nice if they had a few more girls in this film to have more variable sub-stories within to strengthen the film, but it just seems that the focus was all on Roselyn Sanchez. Surrounded by a cast of many insignificant people. I'll still want to find another film with Roselyn Sanchez with a better story, and what I see out there seems rather bleak. So, I'll forgive her for this one. Heck, even Eva Mendez has a difficult time participating in a worth while movie. If Eva and Roselyn ever did a movie together, I would call it a movie made in heaven. I would be extremely forgivable for all the pending weaknesses that may occur. So, I haven't given up yet.",1358726400,,1070,4.404040404040404
