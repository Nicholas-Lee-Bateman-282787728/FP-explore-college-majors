8430193,3,B004I6J6CA,"The Model Couple (Le couple tmoin)  takes an interesting premise and milks it for far more than it's worth. Jean-Michel (Andr Dussolier) and Claudine (Anmone) are chosen for their complete average-ness for a national experiment that will help determine what the future of consumerism looks like in France. They are poked, prodded and tested by a pair of largely disinterested psychosociologists and kept under 24-hour surveillance as they are inundated with an array of new household goods to gauge their reactions. The experiment is also televised for the nation's edification and to serve as fodder for shallow talk shows.

Klein uses this premise to delve into the idea of state control leading to totalitarianism which can often come about from the most mundane of sources. The satire here is barbed and sharp witted at times but the film's 101 minute run time seems overly long. I enjoy watching Klein's fims for their aesthetic appeal but often find myself running out of interest by the end. This was certainly the case here. That being said there is a great deal of social commentary in the film and it does presage the coming of reality television quite nicely.

This is the basic Eclipse edition of the film with no extras.",1339632000,,1233,4.918269230769231
