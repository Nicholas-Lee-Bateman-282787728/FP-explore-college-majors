6938259,4,B00S0DW5UC,This story line was a bit predictable but very the story line was very interesting none the less. Life happens but God Always makes up for our losses,1430611200,,149,4.357142857142857

6938261,5,B00S0DW5UC,"Wendy Raquel played her part in this movie it was off the chain, but I hated the homeless man killed her child even thought it was a accident. But forgiveness is a must for everyone.. Must Must See.",1441670400,,198,4.2368421052631575

6938264,4,B00S0DW5UC,"I think this movie was pretty good, well known actors and actresses. I really felt the emotions in here, again another low budget movie with a good story line, and I would rent this movie again because it has several messages in it that needs to be seen and heard by adults. Good movie.",1437091200,,286,4.314814814814815
6938265,1,B00S0DW5UC,"This movie is by far the worst & most boring I've ever viewed! I was totally disappointed with the acting skills of all characters involved --especially of those well known. The whole plot was nothing short of lackluster. I really expected so much more. The writer/producer/director need to cash in their card & find a different line of work because making movies just isn't their gift. SAD, BUT TRUE!",1434672000,5,401,4.826086956521739
6938266,3,B00S0DW5UC,"Marilyn (Wendy Raquel Robinson) is grieving over the death of her son, who was killed by a hit and run driver. She's doing her best to function everyday, to be strong. Mozart (Gary Dourdan) is a homeless man she tries to help.

I wasn't sure I'd be interested in this movie, because the loss of a child isn't easy even if it's a fictionalized story. I decided to watch because I think Wendy is a good actor. I first saw her as Regina 'Piggy' Greer in The Steve Harvey Show years ago. When I saw that Marilyn was a Choir Director and that there were church scenes, I felt better about Mysterious Ways. I didn't know it was faith-based. And it's always nice to see Telma Hopkins. She is a funny lady. Her character added humor.

There was a scene that didn't seem right. I wasn't clear on what was going on, but it seemed assumptions were made because of appearance and what happened wasn't believable. The movie was also predictable, but still a good viewing experience. A Christian Film with a strong message of forgiveness, and traditional Christian music vs contemporary Christian music was addressed.

Favorite Lines:
You never really know what's going on in someone else's life.
Easy and life are rarely found in the same sentence.

Light Profanity: When referring to Hell (a place of complete, unending separation from God), I don't see that as swearing. But other words were used when a character was upset.",1434499200,2,1413,4.662650602409639
6938267,2,B00S0DW5UC,"It was ok, won't watch it again",1434412800,,31,3.5714285714285716
6938268,4,B00S0DW5UC,"Mysterious Ways points the viewer to how God's plans and ways are far above our own. Based upon the acting alone or the quality of film alone, I would rate much lower, but the theme and story is what caused me to rate it higher.  This is one of those movies that will cause one to search his or her own heart and life.",1434240000,,318,3.96875
6938269,4,B00S0DW5UC,"I didn't expect too much of this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised.",1434067200,,71,4.538461538461538
6938270,4,B00S0DW5UC,"I just finished watching the movie at Bethel Baptist Church where most of the scenes were shot.  It was a great movie, I saw lots of familiar faces.  The plot was something we all need to remember......FORGIVENESS.  B. Sweet",1434067200,,224,4.6923076923076925

6938273,4,B00S0DW5UC,Nice movie that would of never figured out the ending.,1433376000,,54,4.5
6938274,3,B00S0DW5UC,"I really wanted to like this movie but it most defiantly fell short of my expectations. Don't get me wrong, the acting was good with a solid plot but the movie itself left me with more questions than answers that were never fully addressed. Overall all I see where they were going with it and got the message but it failed to fully deliver.",1433030400,,340,4.328125

6938277,1,B00S0DW5UC,"I am sorry, but this movie was horrible. Wendy done a terrible job acting and I was very disappointed. I knew exactly were this movie was going from the opening credits. Not good at all.",1432425600,5,186,4.3428571428571425
6938278,3,B00S0DW5UC,"Marilyn (Wendy Raquel Robinson) has trouble moving on after her son was killed in a hit and run. She is the church's choir director, as that seems to be her only occupation. She has a boyfriend Roland who she ignores and has a choir ready to revolt. One night she runs into Mozart (Gary Dourdan) with her car. He is an educated homeless man, who she helps out.

This is an African-American spiritual with multiple themes:

1) Everything happens for a reason.
2) Accept the things you can't change.
3) Forgiveness
4) And maybe ""God works in mysterious ways"" but not so much.

We never did find out why God took her son, I guess it is one of those Book of Job things.

The film is predictable with acting a bit on the hammy sit. For those who like sad uplifting films, this could be the one, although I never felt her pain, because Marilyn was a bit disagreeable.

Available on line at the Urban Movie Channel.",1432425600,,908,4.380952380952381

8696801,4,B00S0DW5UC,"This was an excellent movie with a surprise ending.  It was very emotional, but it was obvious
the writer never been to church much because the church scenes were definitely not in
the manner in which service in church is handled, which is why this received a 4 star rating
instead of a 5.",1446768000,,289,4.351851851851852
8696802,2,B00S0DW5UC,"It was a sweet low budget movie with a message on forgiveness. I could relate, others may not. Everyone has had some pain in life that forgiveness may help heal. It's for you not them. I enjoyed this movie because of that.",1444176000,,222,4.309523809523809
