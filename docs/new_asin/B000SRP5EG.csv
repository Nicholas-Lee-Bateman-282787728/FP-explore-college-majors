8206552,5,B000SRP5EG,Love it! This is by far my favorite Jazzercise workout.,1484524800,,55,4.6
8206553,5,B000SRP5EG,Jeethuth I just couldn't believe my hip flexorth after this,1420416000,,59,5.0
8206554,1,B000SRP5EG,Very hard to follow moves. Made you feel like you had to be a hip hop dancer to keep up. Felt more like and dance lesson than a workout dvd. I returned mine.,1390780800,2,157,3.787878787878788
8206555,1,B000SRP5EG,"I love most of the jazzercise dvds--the instruction is good & the workout level is kept up throughout. But this dvd is taught like a dance performance rather than a workout--lots of stop & go. Plus, the moves are bland.",1365984000,4,219,4.5
8206556,1,B000SRP5EG,Too much time spent explaining complicated choreography - not a good sustained workout (for me). Jazzercise customer service wouldn't take it back to give me any credit (or even free shipping) on a different DVD. Not good customer service.,1234224000,7,239,5.153846153846154
8206557,4,B000SRP5EG,"I like this DVD- but probably because I have taken their live class and I love them both as instructors. Tim and Shanna are excellent instructors with great cueing and each step ""builds"" on the next so you don't learn an impossible combination at one time. I do like that with this, unlike the class , if you have to have a do-over, it's possible. If you are a JAzzerciser, you will love this- especially if you have gone to tapings as I have. Tim is always a popular instructor with his street jam class and gives you a great workout. I probably WOULDN'T do this in front of a mirror the first few times. If you can get through the body roll without rolling on the floor laughing, the rest will be a piece of cake. It's not truly for complete beginners. It does assume familiarity on your part with some of the basic Jazzercise steps. Still, after a few times, you will catch on with no problem and from the first time, you will definitely break a sweat.",1197331200,21,955,4.311111111111111
