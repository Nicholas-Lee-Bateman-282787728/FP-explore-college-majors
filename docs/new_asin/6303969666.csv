768124,5,6303969666,"I love the Brother Cadfael mysteries - I watched them on TV quite a few times and when the DVDs became available I ordered them immediately. Brother Cadfael is a Benedictine monk living during the war-torn years of the middle ages. Stationed in England but of Welsh descent, he was a crusader during his middle years and therefore has knowledge of both the outer world as well as the church life.
This episode shows that life 'back then' wasn't always quiet and peaceful. Two children are lost, nuns are violated and killed, ransom and murder are the items of the day. Even with these rough acts going on, men and women find ways to show compassion and love.
It is one of the earlier episodes, with the set and costumes being perhaps a bit sparklier than they need to be, but the acting is fantastic and the plot great as well. The atmosphere is also wonderful.
This is one of my favorite episodes because of a sub-plot with the mysterious crusader who helps find the children - quite special. There are many weavings going on in this story, and the tapestry they create is truly beautiful.",974678400,5,1090,4.566326530612245
768125,5,6303969666,"Can you imagine Oswin caught up in the arms of a woman? Picture him kissing her softly then flying into a rage wherebye he rapes and kills her. To make matters worse, she is a nun and her body is found frozen in a pond just a mile away where she and Oswain were sleeping together. Sound incredulous? Poor Oswin confesses his vile sin when ravaged by fever. Cadfael has a challenging mystery to solve in clearing the name of a man whom he holds dear in his heart.  Brother Oswin has always been like a son to Cadfael. Although he has broken numerous pots and stumbled and bumbled his way through Cadfael's hut, he still remained Cadfael's favorite among all the monks of Shrewsbury. Once again trouble hits the area of the monastery. Two children have been lost and their uncle, an enemy of King stephen, has dispatched an emissary to find and return them. Oswin gets involved by helping the nun and her two charges. Their separation during the storm brings upon more troubles than can be imagined.
  You will love Derek Jacobi's performance in the best of Ellis Peter's tales of our wiley monk Cadfael. He must fight with Prior Robert and Brother Jerome as they immediately condemn Oswin for his vile ""sins"". As he ventures to clear Oswain's name he comes across this emissary who has a very special relationship to Cadfael in addition to being a Crusader. Reminise with Cadfael as he thinks of the woman and son he left behind in Jerusalem as a crusader. In this series, you will encounter another side of Cadfael never shown in previous tapes. I loved the action, suspense, tenderness and thrills of this movie. Give yourself a treat in watching two sons return home.",969667200,2,1669,4.6127946127946124
768126,4,6303969666,"The Virgin in the Ice is one the the many Ellis Peters books that I have  read and enjoyed over the last twelve+ years.  Why then, when there is a  more than adequate story line, and very clear descriptions of the  characters, do the film writers have to alter details.  Surely there was no  need to distort the details to such an extent that Brother Oswin, who had  nothing to do with the disappearance of Yves and Ermina Hugonin in the  book, should suddenly be so closely involved?  Or is it just that the  script writers could not make the plot fit any better?  Why also is the  Hugh Beringar of this film so unlike his description in the books - tall,  solid and fair rather than  slight and dark?  Perhaps I'm being picky but  why change for the sake of change?",965347200,2,767,4.295774647887324
768127,5,6303969666,"Do you like BBC dramatizations with fine actors such as Derek Jacobi (I, Claudius) and Alan Rickman (Sense and Sensibility)? Do you like first class mystery stories you can watch over and over because the plots are  complicated and you miss some of the detail the first or second time you  see the film? Do you like romance and action set in the Middle Ages? Are  you fascinated with daily life in a monastery and the fine art of healing  with herbs and remedies learned by an ex-Crusader now turned healing monk?
The time is the mid-1100s.  Queen Maude and King Stephen, first cousins  who each claim the throne of England, have divided the land in Civil War.  ""The Virgin in the Ice"" is set in the town of Shrewsbury England,  near the border with Wales. Brother Cadfael (Jacobi) is an ex-Crusader, who  in his old age has become a member of the Abby of Saints Peter and Paul.  When he was as a Crusader, Cadfael acquired the knowledge healing from  Miriam, a woman he knew in the Holy Land (and the Biblical sense). He  ministers to the monks at the abbey, the town folks, and any others who may  need his services.
One bleak mid-winter night, Cadfael's young  assistant is found half frozen on a road near the abbey. He has been badly  beaten and is semicomotose from a skull fracture. Cadfael nurses him back  from death's door. Meanwhile, Brother Jerome, the abbey ""snitch""  and troublemaker overhears Cadfael's assistant ranting about a woman.  Brother Jerome jumps to the conclusion the young man has done something  very bad. The young monk had been in the company of a young noble woman and  her tutor a young nun when last seen. Now he has been found alone. What  could possibly have happened?
Cadfael, being a careful and sensible  monk does not jump to conclusions.  He goes in search of clues. In the  process of tracking footprints in the snow, and other traces of the party  of travelers, Cadfael stumbles on a young boy who says he was overrun by  brigands and separated from his sister and her tutor. Cadfael discovers the  boy is the son of a nobleman loyal to Queen Maude's side of the civil  dispute.  En route back to the abbey, while crossing a stream, Cadfael  spots a face peering up at him from the frozen water--a virgin in the ice.
The rest of the story Cadfael tries to determine what happened. How did  the young woman die? Who killed her?  Where is the sister and where is the  nun? Was the party attacked by King Stephen's loyalists? Was it attacked by  a rebel band of ex-Crusaders who have become thieves and highwaymen? Did  the young monk attack the women? How does the young nobelwoman's fiance  figure into the equasion.  And then, there's the mysterious young man with  an olive complexion who was clearly a Crusader, and has orders to bring the  young man and woman to a preselected destination south of Shrewsbury.
""The Virgin in the Ice"" was one of the best of the  dramatizations of one of the best of Ellis Peters 20 volume series on  Cadfael.",960595200,32,2987,4.560377358490566
768128,5,6303969666,"Christmas is coming, but the Abbey of St. Peter and Paul isn't merry at all.  With King Stephen and Empress Maud warring over who is the rightful ruler of Englad, two orphans are sent to Shrewsbury by their guardian for  safekeeping.  When the youngsters and their chaperone Sister Hilaria turn  up missing, Cadfael is enlisted by Hugh Beringar, Shropshire's  undersheriff, to locate Ermina and Yves Hugonin and the nun.  Beringar  coldly refuses to let the nobleman's search party enter the shire.  The  children's uncle is a recently returned crusader but he sides with Maud and  Beringar supports Stephen.
In the weaving of this tale, the threads  become tangled when Brother Oswin, Cadfael's engaging but inept assistant,  is brought to the Abbey unconscious, barely alive.  While on a mission of  mercy, Oswin met up with the siblings and Sister.  Another fiber is woven  into the fabric when Cadfael, out looking for the orphans, finds the nun  frozen in a stream, murdered.  The evidence points to the novice monk, with  whom Sister Hilaria was last seen as they and others fled a raid upon  Ermina's fiance's manor.  After finding Yves, Cadfael ventures forth in  search of Ermina and to prove, or disprove, Oswin's innocence, or  guilt.
Shrewsbury's forest bristles with bandits, and there is a  mysterious stranger from the Far East named Olivier de Bretagne.  The  exotic gentleman came to serve with Ermina and Yves' uncle in Jerusalem and  followed him back to England, homeland of the father he never knew.  The  soldier secretly stays in Shrewsbury, despite the danger and peril, to  complete his mission - tracking down and securing the two Hugonins' safety.  When Cadfael and Olivier meet, the two bond immediately for some  mysterious reason.
Ermina is finally found.  Yves becomes lost once more  but is rescued by Cadfael, Olivier, the undersheriff and his men, and  Oswin.  Oswin?  It seems the lamb-like lad has the heart of a lion after  all!
Justice prevails against those who pillage and plunder.  The cold,  hard truth is revealed as love conquers as itswarmth melts more than one  heart.
It is the Christmas season after all, and as the tapestry-like  tale is completed, there is a surprise for Cadfael, one he never dreamed of  in all his years within and without the Abbey's walls.
""The Virgin  in the Ice"" is stuffed with subplots and scurrilous suspects.  Foreshadowing of Foregate events and Shrewbury surroundings are intricately  interlaced throughout the story, making viewing most intriguing.
This  particular episode isn't perfect though: the falling snow resembles pieces  of floating styrofoam and the wintry groundcover resembles the gooey glop  with which modern day suburbanites spray their windows at Yuletide.  Other  than these blemishes, ""The Virgin in the Ice"" is faultless.
Sir  Derek Jacobi brings to the role of Cadfael the best blend of Benedictine  brotherhood and worldly yet warm wisdom.  Eion McCarthy (Hugh Beringar)  gives another persuasive performance.  Mark Charnock (Brother Oswin) meets  the challenge of acting up a storm even when unconscious.  Amelia Curtis  (Ermina Hugonin) is radiantly charming and ebullient.  William Mannering  (Yves Hugonin) captures the essence of adolescent angst.  Robert Cavanah  (Olivier de Bretagne) is strong, sensitive, and a sigh-t to see.  Roman  Vibert (La Gaucher) is the baddest of bandits; you can almost smell his  rancid breath and his rotting teeth are totally repulsive.
Russell Lewis  adapted the Ellis Peters novel for the screen and deserves the highest  praise for his work. Stephen Smallwood produced ""The Virgin in the  Ice.""",922406400,9,3637,5.185441941074523
768129,5,6303969666,"I have read almost all of the books and seen almost all of the videos and this one really  stands out as being better than the book. I really empathize with Brother Oswin in all  of the videos so it feels right that  he should be the focus of this story.  ""The Virgin in the Ice"" is  also one of the best acted, by all of the cast.  Derek Jacobi and the other  monks  are always flawless, (even Julian Firth as  Brother Jerome who we  all love to hate) but in this one, even the children do an exceptional job.  If you have never seen a Brother Cadfael mystery, I highly recommend that  you start with ""The Virgin in the Ice"".  And if you want a  wonderful book to start with, try ""The Confession of Brother  Haluin"" by Ellis Peters. Bravo to a video masterpiece!",917827200,2,763,4.165517241379311

7860154,4,6303969666,"During this tale of lost teenagers, wicked violators, and errant crusaders, Cadfael has to untie a Gordian Knot of possibilities, and he does so with his usual aplomb.  Much of the episode is spent in the forests, searching for, and strangely, finding one lost teen after another.  Are the forests that small?",1361232000,,309,4.923076923076923
7860155,5,6303969666,"The title is a little misleading, but I'll leave it to you to find out why.

Brother Oswin is brought in nearly dead, having been attacked while on a mission to bring a brother and sister, Ermina and Yves Hugonin, to Shrewsbury where Ermina is supposed to marry a local lord. They were accompanied by Sister Hilaria, a nun who is Ermina's chaperon. In the opening scene, we see Sister Hilaria and Brother Oswin taking shelter from a blizzard in a shepherd's cottage which is used to store feed for the sheep. They must cuddle together to keep warm, and you know how nervous Oswin is around women. That Hilaria is quite pretty doesn't help him relax.

So when he is brought into the abbey nearly dead, the twit Brother Jerome overhears him raving about holding her close and kissing her, and his guilt and shame. And where is Hilaria? She's the virgin under the ice in the title. She'd been thrown in the river before it froze over. And the two young people are missing. This is especially bad since a troop of Queen Maud of Wales' soldiers are roaming about the countryside.

I'm not going to give too much away, but a major part of the plot involves the fact that Ermina no longer wishes to marry the local lord, and is instead in love with Olivier de Bretagne, lately from the Holy Lands, the bastard son of a Muslim widow and a crusader father he never knew. All he knows is that his mother spoke well of him, calling him brave and kind, and saying that he never knew she was pregnant when he left, or he would not have left.

What does all this have to do with Brother Cadfael? Well, he was in the Holy Land at about the time Olivier was conceived. Does he know something of the young man's father?",1336780800,,1702,4.359621451104101
7860156,5,6303969666,The incredibly artistic portrayal of this sad story is visually striking and quite memorable.  But the added twist of Cadfael's discovery of who the young hero really is - brilliant!,1316563200,,182,5.066666666666666
7860157,3,6303969666,"This series of historical mysteries shows the social structure
of England and the problems. The rape murder of a young nun
is the basis for this movie, but Brother Cadfael's past also
comes back unexpectedly to haunt him at the last.
I like the film, but I still suspect the history.",1266451200,,283,4.568627450980392
7860158,4,6303969666,If you like a good mystery and are a student of history  then buy and watch  this series,1253145600,,88,3.8333333333333335
7860159,4,6303969666,"Of all of the Brother Cadfael books that were filmed with Derek Jacobi in the title role, this is my favorite!  It introduces the sleuthing friar to the son he never knew he had.  (Hope that doesn't spoil it for you...)  It turns out that the son is as brave and resourceful as his father.
If you are interested in learning more about Olivier (the son), he was brought back into the novels in one of the last written by Ellis Peters, 'Brother Cadfael's Penance'....I wish they could have filmed that one, too, with the same actors!
Enjoy watching Cadfael defend Brother Oswin in this one as well.",1223337600,,596,4.5
7860160,5,6303969666,"Although the video doen't precisely follow the book, the visual presentation is a stunning feast for the eyes! The depiction of 12th century England in the depths of a pre-Christmas storm awes the viewer with the contrast between the beautifully stark, harsh
snow-covered countryside and the simple, life-saving, warmth of Shrewsbury's Benedictine monastary; it is an island of life in a white sea of death.
An excellent presentation of English drama:  a great story done by great actors and filmed by a great cinema crew.
A must-have video for Christmas!",1041724800,,555,5.166666666666667
7860161,4,6303969666,"Brother cadfael, 12th ecntury benedictine monk and herbalist of the abbey of St Peterand St Paul, of Shrewsbury has been transformed into life by Sir Derek jacobi,and in a way, has become his as much as his creators,Ellis Peters. In this entry,the civil war raging between King Stephen and Empress Maud[never far from any of the 20 stories]is raging on...It opens with Brother oswin,cadfaels clumsly,sweet novice wandering about in a snowstorm,then coming uopn a gropup of badints, and being beaten and stabbed and left for dead. A missing pair of teens,their teacher{a nun}, a lord,some wayward crusaders,another crusader and our intrepid slueth are intertwined very well. The scene of the frozen corpse being melted by candle while gregorian chant in sung is very well done,though much of the snowfall looks like soap flakes. The acting is first rate. Jacobi has done, to the same degree with a lesser literary figure, what the late Sir Alec Guiness did with John Le Carre's Geroge Smiley: made him so much his own it is difficult to distinguish between the two. There are a couple of surprises here, a twist at the end,and a satisfying conclusion  to this chapter. The video is not vey well filmed at least my dvd was poorly shot. I do not think it was the transfer,I think it was the quality of the original recording. I have vhs copies of this series that are much better productions. Also, there are no special features worth talking about. So to sum up, nice storyline, superb acting from Jacobi,interesting moments,poor quality recording.",979862400,5,1546,4.946153846153846
