7563051,5,B0195G9YNI,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

I remember the first time I ever saw this film as a child on a late night horror hosted program. Called HORROR HOTEL (the name given the film for its American release) it was one that stuck with me years after I had seen it. Whenever I saw it was on TV I made a choice to watch it again if possible. Id seen it released on DVD in various packages and from different companies but knew that most of them were low quality releases for the film so I never bothered. I pleased to now say that a definitive version of the film is available and includes some fantastic extras with it.

If youve never seen the movie it starts off with a young female college student named Nan Barlow (Venetia Stevenson) looking into witch trials in American history. Willing to do extra credit she takes the advice of her professor Driscoll (Christopher Lee) to visit a small village called Whitewood where he came from. 300 years ago Elizabeth Selwyn was burned at the stake there for witchcraft and he tells her she could find plenty of information on the topic there, suggesting that she stay at The Ravens Inn run by a Mrs. Newless (Patricia Jessell). As viewers we immediately recognize Mrs. Newless as Selwyn, the witch burned at the stake years ago and seen in a short prologue at the beginning of the film.

Strange things begin to happen immediately and it isn't long before Nan is soon marked to be a sacrifice to a coven of witches that still remain in Whitewood. Before that can happen Nans brother Richard (Dennis Lotis) shows up in town as well in search of his sister. He is befriended by a blind priest and his granddaughter Patricia (Betta St. John) who runs a local store. Richard and Patricia soon become enamored with one another as she helps him try to find out what happened to Nan. Having befriended Nan when she arrived even Patricia is wondering whats going on. Before the film ends witches will rise, a coven will threaten non-members and a twist will reveal itself.

What makes this film work on all levels is the atmosphere it creates from the start of the film. The town of Whitewood is creepy as all get out, with a low lying mist forever working its way across the ground. It seems as if daylight has never reached this village and the odds of it ever doing so again are slim. Add to that the eerie factor on display from events that happen throughout, from dancing guests that disappear to strange individuals who can be found in the town to the fact that the priest has a church with no one in attendance and you get the impression early on that this is not a town to remain in for long.

The appearance of Lee in the role of the professor, a man who takes the subject he teaches seriously, lends a certain amount of horror credibility to the entire film as he had played Dracula, Frankensteins monster and the Mummy in the previous 3 years. His time on screen is short but valuable in establishing many moments of the film. Jessell does an amazing job of moving from mad to subtly threatening in her role and adds to the overall creepiness onscreen.

Although over 56 years ago (!) the film holds up amazingly well. Made at a time just before people began to honestly fear a resurgence in devil worship and cults between the Manson family and the release of THE EXORCIST, the movie uses both themes to instill fear in the viewer. Im sure there was some fear of both prior to the films release but at the time movies had no problem using those themes to create a horror tale. While that continues today most are wary of using either for entertainment purposes and more people are fearful of watching films like this than at that time. That this film can still make you feel dread and concern over the topic is a testament to the power it has.

VCI has released the film before but this Blu-ray version offers a pristine transfer of the film, the best Ive seen to date, as well as numerous extras to go along with it. The film itself offers both the U.S. version as well as the lengthier British version. Extras include an archival interview with Christopher Lee and a behind the scenes interview with Lee when he was signing autographs for a previously released VCI edition released in 2001. There is a new audio commentary track by Bruce G. Hallenbeck (a British film authority and contributor to LITTLE SHOPS OF HORRORS MAGAZINE), liner notes by Mike Kenny, a trailer for the British title of the film and a gallery of photos that include lobby cards, stills, posters and more.

If you loved this film as a child or having discovered it on TV years after it was released then by all means youll want to check out this edition of the film. As I said it retains the creepy factor after all these years, might still inspire a nightmare or two and is the best version of this movie that can be found right now. The folks at VCI have outdone themselves with this release. All thats missing is a horror host to introduce the film to take me back to my youth.",1459814400,2,5020,4.43709327548807

There is a light fluctuating problem for the first several minutes but you have to look for it to be bothered, otherwise, it is quite sharp except for an anomaly in the upper left bookcase that last a few seconds which I cannot begin to explain.

Even when you know what happens you'll still enjoy rewatching it - that's one mark of a well made movie.

7563054,3,B0195G9YNI,"My review is for the blu-ray disc, not the film, which I love. I expected something better from this HD package, better even than the superb SD release also by VCI. This disc is 1080i rather than 1080p and they've changed the aspect ratio from 1:67 to 1:78 cutting off a bit from the top and bottom of the image. Black crush is evident in the very dark scenes and this should simply not be. Though the film source seems to be in good shape it appears somewhat bland with relatively low contrast between darks and lights. Most of the scenes are in the mid-grey area. The only questionable added value over the SD version is the American version of ""Horror Hotel"" in SD and an extra commentary that is not so great (lot's of ""don't go in there"" and ""she'll find out what happens""- type comments). I guess my final recommendation is, if you have the SD version, this is not much of an improvement if any. If you are buying this film for the first time (and you should buy it) it's a toss-up which way to go. Buy based on price.",1459296000,22,1024,4.283505154639175

7563059,5,B0195G9YNI,"BOTTOM LINE: If you enjoy classic atmosphere & mood over today's in-your-face gore then this movie is for you. Relatively obscure British-made horror film about witchcraft and devil worship has more atmosphere and dread that a half dozen lesser films. CITY OF THE DEAD has continued to gain a steady & growing cult following over the years and this impressive, newly remasted Blu-ray should only serve to increase the number of fans of this moody minor motion picture masterpiece. 5 STARS

THE STORY: College student writing her term paper on witchcraft during America's colonial period is sent by one of her professors to the remote Massachusetts village of Whitewood, for additional research on the subject - where she finds far more than she bargained for. When the girl fails to show up on the promised return date or contact her older brother with an explanation, both he and the girl's boyfriend separately head for Whitewood to find out what happened. Neither are prepared for the horrors they encounter there.

THOUGHTS: An excellent film I caught decades ago on the old 'Sir Graves Ghastly presents' creature feature show out of Detroit, in its truncated U.S. version titled ""Horror Hotel."" The mood & creepiness stayed with me for years afterwards. I snagged a Public Domain copy of the film during college, then I upgraded to the VCI DVD back in 2009, and now comes this excellent restored & remasted Blu-ray. What a joy to have this classic piece of moody film making in hi-definition! A young yet always commanding Christopher Lee is icily threatening as college professor Alan Driscoll. The other stars range from strong (Patrica Dressell) to weak (Tom Naylor), which is par for the course on a low budget production like this one. Though the script is very heavy-handed & obvious at times the film triumphs in spite of it. Yet it is the film's outstanding cinematography and an unrelenting sense of impending dread, (and enough fog to make John Carpenter green with envy), that have helped make CITY OF THE DEAD so memorable. This film is a prime example of style over substance, but please don't think I'm slighting this movie. Indeed not! I LOVE this flick. I spin it every Halloween season. And even though I've seen it many, many times, CITY OF THE DEAD's frantic, white-knuckled climax can still raise goosebumps!

THE BLU-RAY: This spiffy high-definition Blu-ray from VCI is sweet. The film has perhaps never looked better. Focus is razor sharp for the most part, with only minimal pixelation & artifacting. No edge enhancement or crush (video noise) that I could detect. Thankfully no overuse of DNR (Digital Noise Reduction) either; film grain is wonderfully evident throughout, (as is the occasional scratch or bit of dirt). Sound is very strong, the level is loud and the soundmix is mercifully even. Bonus content includes most of the extras from VCI's older DVD version ported over (still standard definition), a new full-length commentary track from film historian and CoTD super-fan Bruce Hallenbeck, a separate commentary track with Christopher Lee, the film's trailer (altered for the British title) and a still gallery. The other big 'gimme' is the inclusion of the full ""HORROR HOTEL"" American cut of the film. This is in standard def from, I am guessing, a pretty crummy PD source. If you want to see how rough this film has looked for decades watch the HORROR HOTEL version for a few minutes and then flip back to the new restored CoTD cut. Amazing, isn't it?!? And what about that GORGEOUS snapcase cover art!? I would LOVE to have this print as a poster in my office or as a T-shirt! Wow. Anyhow, thank you VCI for the excellent restoration & remaster of this wonderfully atmospheric old horror thriller!",1475798400,7,3741,4.916139240506329

7563063,5,B0195G9YNI,"An excellent Blu-ray restoration long overdue. A side-by-side comparison with the US 'Horror Hotel' cut makes one question the rationale behind making the two minutes of cuts they did.

Also includes the US version, obviously a tape dub (the TCM print is better), but it suffices for comparative purposes. The real star of the show is the restored UK version, anyway.

The bonus material is good, as well, with two interviews with Christopher Lee (one is tolerable only if you can handle the bad audio and shaky hand-held camera), and shorter interviews with Venitia Stevenson, and John Moxey.

The real disappointments are the commentary tracks. The commentaries with Moxey and Bruce Hallenbeck are sparse and unremarkable, with only occasional tidbits of information. The Christopher lree commentary is better, once it gets started, but is sad at times, with Lee struggling to recall (often inaccurately) things that happened forty-plus years before the recording of the track.

7563075,5,B0195G9YNI,"This review is for the VCI blu-ray version of 'The City of the Dead' (Horror Hotel).

I've read some of the comments about the quality of blu-ray DVD and will defer to their expertise as I am no expert on these things. I know some think the quality could be even better. All I know is what I see in front of me. To me, the blu-ray looks terrific. The print has no scratches or lines and looks very clean. The image quality to these admittedly older eyes looks pretty damn good. As a bonus you get the 'Horror Hotel' (American version) of this movie which is not the same quality as the main feature. It is obviously a poorer image but at least it's their to compare. You also get 3 interviews with two stars and the director which are all informative and interesting to watch. You also get the trailer.

As far as the movie itself....I think it is a great movie even though I don't especially love the ending sequence.

The strongest point of this movie by far is the cinematography, lighting and set design. The town of Whitewood as as creepy as it gets. The fog that is crawling around everywhere is especially effective. Most of the scenes in Whitewood have a shadowy noirish look to them. The scenes in the antique shop are like a breath of fresh air and give a sense of relief after the other scenes in the oppressive town.

As unlikely as the story may be, it's easy to look past that. The movie moves along at a decent pace and the acting is quite good. You have Christopher Lee along with Patricia Jessell who was an award winning actress. Everybody else is decent enough.

As for the story, parts of it have been compared to Psycho but Psycho was after City of the Dead so it had no influence. Neither did any Hammer film, according to the director in his interview. He stated he had never seen a Hammer film before filming the movie so any similarities to either Psycho or Hammer films is purely coincidental. The movie is about a student who is sent by her professor (Christopher Lee) to an obscure New England town to study witchcraft. He tells her the town of Whitewood is where witches were burned at the stake in 1692. He tells her to see the proprietor of the Raven's Inn and mention his name, Alan Driscoll. To say anymore would ruin the story as things take an unexpected turn halfway through the movie. As I stated earlier I didn't love the ending and felt it could have been handled a bit better but it's not so bad as to knock down my rating a star.

Recommended for just about any fans of any horror movies made before 1970. Especially fans of black and white horror movies. This one is a throwback. The five star rating is for the quality of the DVD and for the quality of the movie in it's time period.",1460332800,7,2726,4.3352941176470585
8744022,5,B0195G9YNI,"As is my usual custom, this is a review of the video and audio quality for the available releases of City of the Dead. I am not reviewing the film, as you can find a plot review pretty much anywhere, so why waste your time with that. The only thing you need to know, in order to understand this review, is that there were two cuts of this film:  the uncut UK version (City of the Dead) and the cut US version (Horror Hotel). Now on to the Blu-rays....

The most popular Blu-ray releases of City of the Dead are the Region A, City of the Dead / Horror Hotel from VCI, the Region B, City of the Dead / Horror Hotel from Arrow and, most recently, the Limited Edition Region A, City of the Dead from VCI. The key differences are detailed here.

VCI's original, two cut, Region A version, contained transfers of the uncut and cut versions with poor picture quality. They included a wonderful assortment of special features but the picture quality on the transfers of both cuts was in incredible disappointment to many who purchased the release. On that release, VCI included a new retrospective commentary by filmaker and author Bruce Hallenbeck, a behind the scenes interview with Christopher Lee, a feature length commentary by Christopher Lee, an additional 45 minute interview with Christopher Lee, an interview with Venetia Stevenson, an interview and commentary by the director, John Moxey, and a trailer and photo gallery. For the special features alone, I purchased this release.

Then Arrow, among the best Blu-ray distribution companies in the world, released their own, Region B, remastered Blu-ray with both the cut and uncut versions. The picture quality was stunning, especially in comparison to the unfortunate quality on that original VCI release. Arrow included, on top of their standard reversible artwork, an audio commentary by film critic Jonathan Rigby, exclusive to their release, standing, essentially, in competition with VCI's historical commentary, and then they included the same audio commentary by Christopher Lee, the same director commentary and interview, the shorter interview with Christopher Lee and the longer interview with Christopher Lee, the interview with Stevenson, an a trailer and photo gallery.

Basically, the difference in features, for the first two releases, was that VCI had one film historian talking about the film while Arrow had a different one. The major difference, of course, was that stellar video presentation on the Region B locked version and the embarrassingly poor picture quality on the VCI release. Both were released in 1:66:1, so there was no difference in basic presentation.

And so, we come to the third release, another from VCI. After the poor video quality on their last release, VCI did what very few companies do, after such a screw up, and they actually paid, yes paid, quite a bit of money, to get a new transfer on that original uncut version of the film, they worked on it, and then reissued it as a stand alone, single film, low cost release. It was, very clearly, their apology to the fans who had been so disappointed. They couldn't afford to do a disc swap out or offer a discount to prior purchasers so they did the next best thing and cut all features that would cost them the most money (commentaries and such) and kept only the most important feature, the 45 minute interview with Lee. And so, VCI's Limited Edition Remaster of City of the Dead contains the uncut version, only, and an interview, and does not add any features to the original release, but, deletes the ones that would add to the cost of the release. The picture on the uncut remaster rivals the Arrow release and appears, to me, to have been soured from the same master. The major difference on the Arrow release and the VCI remaster is that Arrow opted to go with Hammer's standard aspect ratio, 1:66:1 (like VCI on their original release) and VCI felt that 1:78:1 would be better, owing to the controversy over whether it was originally exhibited in 1:66:1 or 1:85:1 and the complaint of many American fans that they didn't like the bars up the sides of the screen and would rather sacrifice a little off of the top and bottom in order to have a nice, clean, widescreen, screen-fitting presenation.

No on can say for certain what the original aspect ratio was, but it really comes down to personal preference, as to which you would want in your viewing experience. I have to see every little bit of what was filmed, even if it is an open matte 4:3 presentation of what was intended to be a 1:85:1, with the top and bottom cut off, removing things like boom microphones hanging into frame. Most of my friends and relatives like the picture to fill their 1:78:1 television and would be happier with the newer VCI version for that reason.

Overall, to offer, hopefully, some advice, it is buyers' choice, as to the transfer, the terrible VCI original or the beautiful and nearly identical Arrow and VCI Limited Edition Remastered, and buyers' choice as to your preferred aspect ratio, VCI original 1:66:1, Arrow's 1:66:1 or VCI's Remastered 1:78:1, and buyers' choice as to which version will work for you, based on your region capability (if you are not region free and live in the US then you need Region A and must select from VCI poor picture but great extras vs. VCI great picture with one 45 minute Lee interview or both), I know people who have their preferred release, who have the original only or the Arrow or the VCI Remastered or a combination, and it really does boil down to what you prefer. The main picture problem on the original VCI release was excessive DNR, to such a degree that fine detail was lost and the picture looked slightly better than an upscaled DVD, coupled with a very low bitrate for the encoding and an encoding process that used MPEG-2 (VC-1) instead of the better MPEG-4 (AVC), which only made matters worse. The VCI Remastered Edition is wonderful, for picture and encoding. So is the Arrow release. If you are region free, and don't mind 1:66:1, Arrow wins, especially considering their extras. If you are Region A only, then it is a choice between 1:66:1 with a terrible picture but a lot of features or a 1:78:1 presentation of a beautiful transfer with only one feature or, as the most expensive option, a purchase of both the original VCI and VCI Remastered editions, the dreaded double-dip.

I hope this helps to clarify your choices so that you can pick what works best for you.

The ASIN for VCI's original release with the features is B0195G9YNI .
The ASIN for Arrow's Region B release with features is B01N9RHGS1 .
The ASIN for VCI's new Remastered release with only the one feature is B078D674W7 .

8744025,5,B0195G9YNI,"Beautiful Blu-ray of this horror classic (also know as Horror Hotel) really gives new life to a film now almost 60 years old. The transfer provides a sharp picture with some nice contrast to really accent the black and white photography and preserve director John Llewellyn Moxey's spooky visuals. In the extras, there are a host of interviews with cast and director Moxey, including two with Christopher Lee. For those who have never seen this, here is a review of the film itself...

The legendary Christopher Lee stars in this classic 1960 horror that is still as spooky and effective today as it was then and is one of my favorite films to watch during the Halloween time of year. This chilling horroralso known as City Of The Deadbegins with the burning of witch Elizabeth Selwyn (Patricia Jessel) in 1692 in the town of Whitewood, Massachusetts. We then cut to the occult studies class of professor Alan Driscoll (Christopher Lee) where eager student Nan Barlow (Venetia Stevenson) intends on writing her class paper by going to New England to investigate its occult history first hand. Driscoll suggests she go to Whitewood itself to do her studies and gives her the directions to find the small infamous town. Upon arrival in the spooky village, Nan stays in The Ravens Inn run by the mysterious Mrs. Newless (also Patricia Jessel) and soon finds that the 300 year old legends of Whitewood may be all too real. When Nan doesnt return from her research trip, her brother Richard (Dennis Lotis), followed by friend Bill (Tom Naylor), travels to Whitewood looking for her. Richard teams up with the granddaughter of the local reverend, Patricia (Betta St. John), who had met Nan and lent her a book on the occult. What they find is something very ancient, very evil and very deadlysomething they may not escape alive.

John Llewellyn Moxey brings loads of atmosphere and a great visual style to this B&W chiller about college students running afoul of Devil worshipping witches in an old New England town. He gives the film an almost non-stop tension and creates some frightening horror sequences and its all supported by a sometimes very haunting score by Douglas Gamely. With an almost 300 year old witch, fiendish occult ceremonies and ritual sacrifice, youve got a really old fashioned Halloween horror film treat. The graveyard climax is both bone chilling and contains some truly stunning horror film visuals that have stayed with me since I first saw this on TV as a little boyand when I was a kid, this flick scared the heck out of me!

As for the cast Christopher Lee is at his sinister best as the professor in occult studies who is far more involved in his subject than his students realize and just may be leading his eager-to-learn lambs to the slaughter. Patricia Jessel brings the evil witch Elizabeth Selwyn to vibrant life and Venetia Stevenson stands out as the inquisitive and ill-fated Nan. The rest of our young antagonists do well in portraying the horror of what they encounter and the film is peppered with some very unnerving supporting characters.

I highly recommend this to any horror fan who appreciates how it was doneold school and in glorious black and white! A wonderfully spooky and delightfully charming horror classic. Also stars Norman Macowan as Reverend Russell and Valentine Dyall as the mysterious Jethrow Keane.",1517097600,,3358,4.885964912280702

8744027,5,B0195G9YNI,"I am a big fan of this film!  For me anyway, it is one of the best all-around black and white horror films!  It's got everything: great story, great villains, great music, and fantastic eerie setting...  plus a tiny bit of humor and even maybe some ""campiness"".  It's a ""must see"" every year, before Halloween!

For those fans of this film who are ""on the fence"" about getting the BluRay version, I'd say go for it !!  You only get a couple extra minutes in the full UK version, ""The City of the Dead"", versus the old US version, ""Horror Hotel"", but these 2 minutes do add to the story a little.  But also, the BluRay re-mastering of the picture is noticeably better.  Totally worth it, in my opinion!  And you get lots of extras, including interviews and the old ""Horror Hotel"" US version in ""pre-remastered"" version, as on the older DVD (and you really CAN see the difference, especially on a large or hi-def TV).",1512777600,3,915,4.463855421686747
8744028,5,B0195G9YNI,"For years this has been one of my favorite horror movies. I watch it every February 1st. For starters it's in black & white which is my preferred medium for horror movies, Next is the film's remarkable imagery courtesy of director of photography Desmond Dickinson. The fog shrouded town, the interior of the old inn illuminated by firelight, the faces of the residents are all images that stick with you. Then there's the dialogue..campy, full of pregnant pauses, imminently quotable, and delivered with the utmost seriousness and panache by a wonderful cast headed up by Shakespearean actress Patricia Jessel (""I am Elizabeth Selwyn""). Yes, Christopher Lee gets top billing but his is only a supporting role.

Also in the cast are Betta St John, a Brit B movie actress, and Venetia Stevenson as the two female leads. Stevenson is the daughter of director Robert Stevenson (MARY POPPINS) and a direct descendant of Robert Louis Stevenson. There's also character actor Valentine Dyall immediately recognizable to BBC listeners by his unmistakably sonorous voice. The film was directed by John Moxey, a Welsh director who came to the U.S and as John Llewellan Moxey did many TV movies including the original NIGHT STALKER. The film was produced by Max J. Rosenberg and Milton Subotsky and is considered to be the first Amicus film although it's not billed as such. In horror film circles that's quite a pedigree.

So much for the background. The movie is best known to American audiences as HORROR HOTEL (""Just ring for Doom Service"" ran the ads) and is missing about 2 minutes from the British original. For years it has existed in several cheap public domain copies which have done the film's visuals a huge disservice. This was finally remedied when VCI Entertainment released a pristine copy of the British version back in 2001. Now it has has been released on Blu-Ray. I have not seen the Blu-Ray as the 2001 DVD has everything significant to be found here and it's considerably less expensive so no need for me to upgrade. One reviewer complains that the aspect ratio has been altered but I can't comment on that. The good thing about the Blu-Ray is that you are guaranteed the best available version. If you love classic atmospheric horror movies especially British ones then it doesn't get better than this.",1499040000,3,2313,4.913043478260869
8744029,5,B0195G9YNI,"THE CITY OF THE DEAD [1960 / 1963 / 2017] [Dual Format] [Blu-ray + DVD] [UK Release] In Whitewood, Time Stands Still! The Thrills, the Chills of Witchcraft Today!

Christopher Lee was already a horror icon when he started filming THE CITY OF THE DEAD in 1959. Having played Frankensteins Monster, Count Dracula and The Mummy for Hammer Films, this new picture would allow him to extend his range to the American Gothic and witchcraft in a small Massachusetts New England village.

Christopher Lee plays Professor Driscoll, an authority on the occult who persuades one of his students Nan Barlow [Venetia Stevenson] to research his hometown, Whitewood, once the site of witch burnings in the 17th century. Booking herself into the Ravens Inn, she soon learns that devil worship among the locals hasn't been consigned to the past.

Produced by future Amicus founders Milton Subotsky and Max Rosenberg, and beautifully shot by Desmond Dickinson (whose credits ranged from Laurence Oliviers Hamlet to Horrors of the Black Museum). THE CITY OF THE DEAD is a wonderfully atmospheric and still shocking slice of horror that stands firmly alongside its Hammer Films contemporaries.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: THE CITY OF THE DEAD film is an English production taking place in America. As Professor Alan Driscoll [Christopher Lee] is the catalyst of the story, teaching his student Nan Barlow [Venetia Stevenson] all about witchcraft. This inspires her to take a trip to the hamlet of Whitewood, home of a notorious tale of witches, the Devil, and a horrific curse. Not everyone supports the idea of going to such a suspicious sounding place, but Nan ignores her boyfriend Bill [Tom Naylor] and her brother Richard [Dennis Lotis], and off she goes to fall into inevitable trouble and doom.

The hamlet of Whitewood and its inhabitants are the real stars of THE CITY OF THE DEAD, with the cinematography and score creating a spooky atmosphere that makes you feel dread from the moment Nan Barlow arrives. We soon find out why Driscolls so fascinated by Whitewood, and that Mrs. Newless [Patricia Jessel] at the local Ravens Inn isn't quite what she seems. The City of the Dead does a fantastic job of creating and maintaining suspense, and while the audience remain suspicious of everything, it isn't long before the truth comes out and things escalate quickly from there. City remains one of the best and most chilling examples of witchcraft depicted onscreen, and no doubt influenced many movies still to come, while itself following in the footsteps of H.P Lovecraft and Hitchcock in many ways. As we all know, Alfred Hitchcock has redefined cinema with Psycho that same year, and many will note similarities between the two horror films it seems to be coincidence.

As expected, Christopher Lee steals the show amongst a middling cast. He has a naturally menacing presence that appears almost effortless and is thus the perfect actor for this type of movie. Theres a reason why actors like Lee, Vincent Price, Boris Karloff, and Peter Cushing are still appreciated for their contributions to the horror genre, and thats a screen charisma that cannot be taught. Christopher Lee himself remained enthusiastic about THE CITY OF THE DEAD later in life, and its not hard to see why. With a few surprising twists and a very creepy location, this is a slightly forgotten horror film that is well worth anyones time.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Arrow Video brings you this Blu-ray with an excellent brand new 4K restoration from the original negative, restored by the Cohen Film Collection and the BFI, presented here in a brilliant 1080p High Definition Black-and-White transfer respecting the original 1.66:1 aspect ratio showing more information at the bottom of the frame. The image looks totally sharp and definitely has extremely good image reference, nicely rendering the Gothic atmosphere of the film especially during its numerous spooky foggy shots in the small New England village. There is not any noticeable amount of grain and there was definitely was not any noticeable traces of dirt, scratches or other defects and looks solid in-motion even standing very close to the screen and especially when you get close ups of the actors faces. This is therefore a very good improvement on previous inferior DVD release. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Arrow Video once again bring us a really nice clear uncompressed 1.0 LPCM Mono Audio track with no apparent defects or distortions. This uncompressed audio track does a superior job with the film's sound requirements which are fairly extensive with plenty of good effects, screams, fire, and along with the occasional Gregorian chant. The films atmospheric music score by Douglas Gamley works really well with the film's encompassing spooky atmosphere of the darkness and fog effects.

Special Feature: HORROR HOTEL [1963 / 2017] [1080p] [1.66:1] [76:00] When THE CITY OF THE DEAD was release in the USA in 1963, and it was presented in a shorter version and retitled Horror Hotel. That version is now presented for the first time in 1080p High Definition.

Special Feature: Interview with Christopher Lee [2001] [480i] [1.33:1] [45:12] Here we are introduced to fan come genre critic Brad Stevens who informs us that he is doing an in-depth interview with the legendary actor Christopher Lee who talks extensively about his vast career in mainly the film industry, but has done some stage work and this interview is in conjunction with the release of the DVD of The City of the Dead [2007]. Brad asks Christopher about all the legendary Hollywood luminaries he has worked and mentions Raoul Walsh, Nicholas Ray, Michael Powell and Orson Welles. Christopher feels Nicholas Ray was more into action films and the film was Bitter Victory and was a 1957 black-and-white Franco-American international co-production film, but sadly Nicholas Ray lost one of his eye due to car accident. Christopher talks about Orson Welles and feels he was a genius and worked on Orson Welles unfinished film Moby Dick [1955] where Orson Welles filmed approximately 75 minutes of this original 1955 film. Christopher Lee talks about the time he was often unemployed and how he was employed as a Floorwalker in the Simpsons of Piccadilly Department Store in London, but suddenly out of the blue was spotted and got to appear in a film which started his acting career in films. Christopher talks about a John Huston film he appeared in who was treated very nicely by the director, but was forewarned the director had a very intimidating reputation. Christopher is asked about the two famous films that really kicked started his rise to fame and they were The Curse of Frankenstein and Dracula that were directed by Terence Fisher [1904  1980] , but originally was a Film Editor which helped him shape his films and knew where to edit his films while actually directing. Christopher also gives great praise to Hammer Films and the team behind the scenes that were very professional, especially working on a tight budget. After the Dracula film, Christopher was asked to do four more films for the American distributors and each time they phoned him he turned them down despite putting up his fee several notches, but eventually Christopher caves in as he was informed that by rejecting their offer it would put a lot of actors out of work and he did not want that on his conscious. Christopher is asked about his appearance in three Sherlock Holmes films, which was filmed in three different countries and he had a great time, but was annoyed in the first film his voice was dubbed. Christopher gives great praise towards three directors who he felt were very talented and they were Tim Burton, Peter Jackson and George Lucas, who he also felt they were the biggest, very clever, very imaginative and very helpful. Christopher also enjoyed working Stephen Spielberg, Joe Dante and John Landis, but the greatest director that Christopher worked for was Billy Wilder in the film The Private Lives of Sherlock Holmes [1970] and felt great gratitude to of worked in that film. I could of listened to Christopher Lee for a lot longer and he is a very intelligent and fascinating person to listen and definitely gets a five star rating.

Special Feature: Behind the Scenes [2001] [1080i [1.78:1] [16:37] This extra bonus is a very intimate amateur video interview in the offices of Salvation Films where we find Christopher autographing the VCIs DVD release of The City of the Dead, and Christopher talks about his latest DVD releases coming out of some of his latest films that people will want a signature on them and says that it will have to be a stamp of his signature, as it will just be too much to keep up with the demand, even though people will be upset it is not his physical signature, but the one negative aspect of this video session is the very unprofessional person working the video camera, as he just wouldnt keep the camera steady, as it was all over the place and was so annoying.

Special Feature: Interview with John Llewellyn Moxey [2001] [480i] [1.33:1] [28:18] Here we get a very nice and personal introduction with director John Llewellyn Moxey in his home in Hollywood, where he informs us he is descended from Welsh ancestry, but was born in Argentina in February 1925. His family operated a coal and steel business out of South America at the time. Before entering the film industry, he served in World War II and began his career as a film editor, and he subsequently went on to direct episodes of the British TV series London Playhouse and The Adventures of Tugboat Annie. In 1960, John Llewellyn Moxey directed the film The City of the Dead but also known as Horror Hotel for the American release, which was his feature film directorial debut which came about via a friend in wanting to get involved with this black-and-white film and then went onto direct the film Circus of Fear [1966]. One actor he really praises that appeared in the film was Norman Macowan who played the blind Reverend Russell, and especially of his wonderful face, and the way he warned people to leave town. The other film John directed that he was very proud of was Circus of Fear which was the 1966 Black-and-white Thriller film that also starred Christopher Lee which was also partially shot at the Billy Smart's Circus, that he also feels helped to give its real genre horror atmosphere, especially working with real animals, but at the same time you had to treat the animals with respect. Although John likes making Horror films, the other types of films he has directed where the actors have to take their clothes off for a sex scenes, he found not only difficult for him, but also the actors who get very self-conscious and embarrassed, even though you have to clear everyone except the cameraman and sound engineer. John talks extensively about the different style of making films or television drams in America and Great Britain, especially the techniques, lighting and shooting a film. When making The City of the Dead, John gives very great praise to Desmond Dickinson, B.S.C. the director of photography, because he did a fantastic job in producing fantastic images in also making the film have a great atmospheric look. One thing John is so very grateful for, is that people now can view the newly restored The City of the Dead with is full 78 minutes length, but could not fathom out why it was give the title of Horror Hotel which he really hated, which unfortunately he had no control over, especially with certain scenes removed for the American market. So all in all, this was another really nice interview and again John came over as a very likeable and intelligent person and one I again could listen to hearing more of his anecdotes on the film industry and his lifetime involved with his career in films and television, and especially working in America and Great Britain and is well worth viewing.

Special Feature: Interview with Venetia Stevenson [2001] [480i] [1.33:1] [19:35] Here we get a rare interview with the actress Venetia Stevenson who informs us why this particular actress was picked to appear in the film The City of the Dead, because Venetia was invited our to England from Hollywood to appear on the BBCTV programme Juke Box Jury as one of the jury to pick a record that she felt would be a success on the British Hit Parade at the time and producers of the film saw her on that TV programme and approached her to be in the film The City of the Dead. One thing Venetia remembers very well was how cold it was on the film set with all the artificial fog produced. Another aspect Venetia remembers very well is the long day shooting on the film set and especially the amount of screaming this actress had to perform, which at times was very hard to do. At one point Venetia admits that she did not know who Christopher Lee was and one of her actor friends told her he was the British equivalent to Vincent Price, which is a typical ignorant attitude you would get from an unintelligent American, as you cannot say such stupid ignorant statement, as the two actors are of a totally different style of acting and especially their personality, but one thing that stood out for Venetia is the fact that Christopher Lee was a very nice polite gentleman. The actress recalls her role as Nan Barlow and suggests that the main things she brought to the film were especially her distinct American accent, and also enjoying her time being filmed at the Shepperton Studios in Surrey, but what has really surprised Venetia with all the films she has appeared in that The City of the Dead is the one that all the film buffs know about her appearance in the film and totally amazed how this film has stood the test of time, compared to all the other films Venetia has appeared in, and what has struck Venetia is that the 78 minute version look so beautiful black-and-white cinematography, especially by the award winning Desmond Dickinson, B.S.C. (Director of Photography). Venetia talks about her marriage to Don Everly, in 1962 and retired from acting and modelling the couple had two daughters, Stacy and Erin Everly and a son, Edan Everly, but unfortunately got divorced from Don Everly in 1970 and has not remarried. But despite this tragic part of her life, decided to move on and eventually went back to the film industry and became a reader and also did synopsis on the storyline, which eventually led to becoming a story editor, which eventually went onto the storyline department of the film industry, then moved on again to being a story editor. In later years, Venetia became a script reader for Burt Reynolds's production company and, subsequently, became vice-president of Cinema Group, a production company that made several films in the 1980s and the work she is most proud of with this company was the Walter Hill's film Southern Comfort [1981]. Venetia also wants to thank all the dedicated fans and people interested in this film made well over 40 years ago at the time of the video.

Trailer [1960] [1080p] 1.78:1] [1:31] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film The City of the Dead that is shown in glorious 1080p crisp black-and-white images, but what a shame the sound was not very clear, as I had to crank the sound up. WARNING: This film trailer includes the final shot of the film and giveaways, so don't watch this first.

Special Feature: Gallery [2017] [1080p] [1.78:1] Here you get to view 34 glorious stunning images that consist of promotional cinema posters for both films, publicity material, and rare promotional photographs. But near the end we get several images of some saucy promotional images of the actress Venetia Stevenson in a black corset.

Audio Commentary by film critic Jonathan Rigby, author of English Gothic: Classic Horror Cinema 1897-2015 and Christopher Lee: This Authorised Screen History: This Audio Commentary by film critic Jonathan Rigby was recorded exclusively for this Blu-ray release. Here we are introduced and welcomed by Jonathan Rigby to join him in viewing the film The City of the Dead with him and where he reckons the film has a really terrific surprisingly good atmospheric gothic thriller we are about to watch with Jonathan, and he feels it is British horror in its halcyon days for that specific period in time when it was released in the cinema and Johnathan definitely has a lot to talk about in the next 78 minutes viewing time, and Jonathan warns us that hopefully you have already viewed the film, as he warns us that he will be revealing certain plot spoilers left, right and centre. As you would expect from Jonathan Rigby is that his audio commentary is packed with very insightful and very interesting facts and anecdotes on all aspects of the film from the choice of the specific  shots, or the various actors previous roles in other films, to the reviews when it was released in cinema. Jonathan talks about Christopher Lees illustrious acting career that spanned nearly 70 years and also talks about Christopher Lees autobiography and in it he described the film The City of the Dead as an American Gothic with a sort of Lovecraft flavour and Jonathan feels that Christopher Lee summed the film up so accurately, as well as a close proximity to a H.P. Lovecraft New England genre scenario. As we come to the end of the film and you see the credits roll up the screen, Jonathan points out that the actress Venetia Stevenson has a spelling mistake with the credits at the start of the film and there they spelt it as Venetia Stephenson. But finally Jonathan says, This is Jonathan Rigby wishing you all a very good foggy night, especially in a very spooky fond farewell to an absolutely brilliant and informative audio commentary and definitely gets a five star rating from me.

Audio Commentary by actor Christopher Lee: Here we have the second audio commentary, where Christopher Lee introduces his personal anecdotes on this film and this audio commentary is from the original VCI DVD release, and features as always a very insightful and intelligent Christopher Lee conversation, and is moderated by Jay Slater and we are told that they are watching the DVD with the sound off. As usual, the famous actor displays an excellent memory, but sometimes cannot remember the names of some of the actors, and he also informs us of many anecdotes related to the film. Christopher Lee comments that he is very pleased to be viewing this DVD release and viewing it with the proper UK film title and of course the 78 minutes version, and informing us that they are not watching the horrible 76 minutes version and complains about what idiot genius decided to call the USA version Horror Hotel. Christopher Lee comments also that his biggest challenge in appearing in this film was to be able to produce and American accent and found it extremely difficult to do. Christopher Lee also criticises these so called splatter horror films that he whole heartedly detests and says that to make a really good horror film is that you give the audiences what you don't see, not what you do see and what is suggested and not everything in plain sight. Christopher Lee talks about Boris Karloff who he did three films with and use to live next door to him, and once Boris Karloff told Christopher Lee that you must leave it to the imagination of the audience, because they will always think of something far worse that what we are doing and Christopher feels this is absolutely true. Christopher Lee gives great praise to the director John Llewellyn Moxey who he found very easy to work with and also says he was a very clever director, as well as praising Desmond Dickinson, B.S.C. (Director of Photography) who made the black-and-white photography so brilliant and says the film could not be filmed in colour as it would of spoilt the whole of the evil atmospheric genre of the film. With the rest of the audio commentary with Christopher Lee just talks in general terms about the film industry, the very long hours shooting with some of his more later films, which in some cases he feels this is not good for an actor, as if you are very tired you are not going to give your best performance or especially for the director. We also get from Christopher lee lots of anecdotes about different actors and the different pay structures that are paid to certain actors and whether they are worth the money they get, and Christopher also asks what it means to be typed cast. The only annoying aspect of this audio commentary is that they are watching the DVD without any sound and sometimes Christopher Lee could not work out what was happening in the film and getting very confused with certain scenes.

Audio Commentary by director John Llewellyn Moxey: Here we have the third and final audio commentary by director John Llewellyn Moxey that is also taken from the previous VCI DVD release of the film, who welcomes us to his audio comments on this film and informs us that this was his first feature film and thanks the producers in allowing him to have confidence in letting direct this film and also informs us this film is something that he has never ever tackled on this scale before, and John also praises all the cast and crew who were involved in making this film and making his job very easy, but he wants to praise especially the wonderful and very inventive Desmond Dickinson, B.S.C. (Director of Photography) who produced some stunning and atmospheric black-and-white images. With this audio commentary John Llewellyn Moxey informs us of lots of very interesting stories and anecdotes about the film, and definitely shows a lot of passion and enthusiasm about the Horror cinema in general, but sometimes John Llewellyn Moxey regularly leaves lots of big gaps of various lengths between him imparting his information on different aspects of this film, especially as he directed the film, which I suppose is done on purpose in trying not to get too boring in repeating himself too much. One bit of interesting information he imparts about the wonderful Shepperton Studios in Surrey in England where he tells us it was a vast film studio with a history dating back to 1931, where they started doing Silent Films. We are also informed that all the houses and other buildings were built specially for the film and everything was filmed on the film set because of the vast space available to make it look real as though it was on location. But John gives greater praise to the actor Christopher Lee who he was perfect for his character in the film and handled the scenes he appeared in, in a very professional way, and John also gives great praise towards the actress Patricia Jessel who played Mrs. Newless who I remember was in the hilarious film A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum [1966] and played the character Domina who was the wife of Michael Hordern who played Senex. When John was in the process of making the film, he did a vast amount of research into witchcraft and doing a lot of reading about the history in American of the place called Salem, which is a city on the north coast of Massachusetts above Boston. It's famous for its 1692 witch trials, during which several locals were executed for allegedly practicing witchcraft. But when the film came out John had loads of correspondence about the Gregorian Chants in the film and was asked if these chants were actually used in the actual witchcraft ceremonies in 1692, but John sadly had to let them down and inform that this never happened in real life, but informs us that he wanted to use these chants as he felt that it gave the film the right spooky atmosphere he wanted to achieve. Jonathan talks about the English actors in the film doing their best to produce an American accent and it is very acceptable and no one has complained about this situation and excepted it, especially as it was filmed in England to give the impression that it was all set in America, and even the critics gave it the thumbs up at the time of its release in the cinema. Jonathan talks about how other Directors who admire his style of directing and have actually copied his style of directing in their films and feels very flattered by this honour. Jonathan also comments on that he really likes working in the 1.66:1 aspect ratio format. Jonathan informs us about his time in Hollywood and meeting the wonderful and talented actor Boris Karloff who he got to know like a personal friend and feels that actors like Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing had at the time taken over the horror genre from Boris Karloff, and Jonathan also really liked the two British actors, especially when not filming as they were extremely funny, but when acting in front of the camera they were extremely professional actors. Jonathan also admires other Directors like John Carpenter and Clive Barker who have continued the horror film genre to great effect. As the credits roll up the screen, Jonathan states that the film was a very exciting one to make and also helped a great deal with the wonderful team behind him and points out sadly some of the people in the credits have now passed away. So ends this final audio commentary, to the point I now know every frame of the film, as I have now viewed this film  four times, especially viewing the film first time round and plus of course with the three audio commentaries, so personally I can really only give a three star rating for this particular audio.

BONUS: FIRST PRESSING ONLY: Beautiful printed illustrated collectors booklet featuring a new writing by Vic Pratt entitled DOOM SERVICE and the October 1997 writing by Tom Weaver entitled THE FRIGHT STALKER. Plus ABOUT THE TRANSFER; PRODUCTION CREDITS; SPECIAL THANKS, and some excellent black-and-white images from the film.

PLUS: Reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Graham Humphreys. Graham Humphreys is a British illustrator and visual artist best known for producing film posters. During the 1980s, Graham Humphreys worked with Palace Pictures, producing publicity material for films including Dream Demon, Basket Case, The Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, Nightmare on Elm Street film series, Phenomena and Santa Sangre.

Finally, Arrow Films new release offers two versions of the film, and THE CITY OF THE DEAD being the most complete film, compared to the US version rebranded Horror Hotel. Film critic Jonathan Rigby offers interesting insight throughout an audio commentary, and having written books on English Gothic and Christopher Lee he clearly knows what he is talking about. As a piece of horror history, its a horror film that everyone should see, especially in their lifetime. This film works for what it wants to accomplish: a chilling, moody, Gothic witch tale and is well worth seeking out for the program alone but it even more worth it for fans and neophytes alike for the myriad bonus features the Blu-ray release includes. Highly Recommended!

We'll watching this new Blueray, and perhaps being prejudiced because I have watched it before, and new there would be no surprises for me, I couldn't help but feel that maybe wear and tear on film stock makes a film look better than it really is. For me this blueray just highlights how cheaply the film really was. Recommended for people who have really never seen it. Also interesting that it is a British film made in England but taking place in the USA. The audio commentaries by the director and this film historian  are not very interesting, usually I don't find director commentaries that interesting, but film historians usually, but not here. Perhaps because he had died just before this release, the Christopher Lee one resonates a little more. If you have never seen the film, recommended, but if you have, can't recommend the blueray that much.",1486166400,,1172,4.661835748792271
