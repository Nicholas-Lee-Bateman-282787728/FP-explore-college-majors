8406724,5,B003VE9WNI,"story- in the 50's a guy liked a girl.  he went to a dance hall hoping to dance with her.  a fight breaks out.  he seems to be disoriented and leaves with the girl.  he crashes into his watery grave but she makes it out. years later the car is recovered.  he somehow comes back to life and gets even with some of the bullys.  it seems all of this takes place while rock-a-billy music plays and detectives try to figure out what's going on.  until now i have never been impressed by faye dunaway.  i'd like to see her as this character again; maybe in a tv series, as --something like-- the new carl kolchac/ night stalker.  but she's a detective not a newsman [that is: 'x-file' type cases].  mrs. taylor- johny 'flick' taylor's mother- was a great charactor, also.  rarly do you get to see older women in great rolls with a chance to display their abilities.

  i really liked this film. the characters were great- which means that the actors did a great job. the director did a fantastic job. for a low budget film the f/x were outstanding. the f/x gave this film a unique and special texture [i feel 'texture' is the appropriate word]. they did use a lot of 50's style rock-a-billy music which will add or distract, depending on you. i like that music , myself. the film is in the style of a 'tales from the crypt' tv show [but totally works as a movie]. one of the things that i really liked about this film were some of the thoughts/ideas that it conjured up in me. A: i love 'repoman' [not the rock opera!] and it should never be remade. but... if it were to be remade i want david howard to direct it. B: sam raimi made: 'crime wave' & 'evil dead 2'. peter jackson made: 'dead alive'. all were great movies; but those two on a small budget were not as good as david howard is. in short: 'the next movie GIANT may be david howard!",1329436800,,1836,4.253602305475504
