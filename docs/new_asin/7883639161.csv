1124224,5,7883639161,"I saw this film twice, last year and now I have the 2 disc director's cut edition dvd. The film is well done, it revolves around a police team headed by Simon Yam. There is a lot of depth and substance unlike some of the action films lately.

Simon Yam's close friend was a key witness against Wong Po(Sammo Hung)who was killed in an ambush so he ended up taking care of his daughter. He finds out that he has developed a brain tumor and realizes that he is running out of time to put Po behind bars. 3 years prior to his retirement, Yam, along with his team decides to manipulate evidence against Wong Po when their undercover man turns up dead. One of his team members has also taken Po's money during a raid in one of his operations. Inspector Ma(Donnie Yen)the man who is supposed to take his place becomes caught in the middle. Although ruthless, Po displays love and regard for his family since it took him awhile to conceive with his wife.

The theme of the story is obsesssion. There are many shades of gray in this film noir, each character has depth and well developed. Suffice it to say, "" DO NOT BECOME SO OBSESSED THAT YOU MAY BECOME THE THING YOU HATE THE MOST AND FOUGHT SO HARD AGAINST.""

The action scenes are phenomenal. The fight between Wing Ju(Sammo's top assassin)and Donnie Yen is well done and doesn't look choreographed at all. Even the fight between Sammo Hung and Donnie Yen was great, Sammo has slowed down a bit but for a bigger, older guy, he can still move.

The theatrical release and director's cut was different endings. The theatrical cut is shorter and a bit of a happy ending while the director's cut is more tragic and more effective that is why I gave the uncut version 5 stars.

The DVD imported Hong Kong version quality is great,(DVD-9/DTS AUDIO)mastered in high definition, it looked so great in HD widescreen television. The english subtitles are well translated, and no cut offs.

Do yourself a favor and order this DVD, you'll be glad you did. With all the weak films coming out of Hollywood, it is refreshing to know ASIAN CINEMA is alive and well. Other recommendations: FEARLESS(Chinese import w/ dvd-9/DTS)w/ Jet Li, TOM YUM GOONG(Tony Jaa), THE PROMISE(ROMANTIC FANTASY) and HOUSE OF FURY(action-comedy).",1145145600,3,2255,4.625
1124225,5,7883639161,THIS MOVIE IS VERY GOOD. THE PLOT AND THE MARTIAL ART IS OUTSTANDING. DONNIE YEN MOVES ARE MORE BETTER THAN JET LI AND JACKIE CHAN. I WISH THEY CAN COME OUT MORE MOVIES LIKE THIS.,1144540800,2,179,4.142857142857143
1124226,5,7883639161,"If you are an avid Hong-Kong film fan, you know the names of Simon Yam, Sammo Hung, and Donnie Yen. You find not only these talents in `SPL,' well-directed Hong-Kong noir, but also very intense action sequences choreographed by martial art master Donnie Yen himself.

Simon Yam is the trusted leader of the police squad, who is not averse to using violence when confronting the crime lord Sammo Hung. Their conflict, as you see in the opening 10 minutes, is now a personal one, not the simple fight between the police and the gang, or the good vs. the bad. And Simon Yam's cop knows that he must end the war quickly, because the time left for him, he knows, is not long.

Now to this police precinct infested by crime, a new police office (in black leather jacket) comes. Donnie Yen plays the new cop who prefers to do his jobs in a law-abiding manner. But even he cannot be free from the violence when one of the squad is attacked by a knife-wielding assassin Wu Jin sent by Sammo Hung.

If you want actions, you have to wait a while. The actions start when Donnie Yen arrives. It is true that the action scenes are not many in number, but what he presents is less showy, more realistic fights using the authentic martial arts techniques (like Brazilian judo style) only real experts like Donnie Yen can show. The tension-packed fight scenes between Yen and Wu Kin in the alley are what none but Donnie Yen can achieve, and he must be proud of it, and should be rightly so.

But if `SPL' has succeeded in resetting the standard of action films in the Hong-Kong film industry - and it certainly did - that is because of the clever blend of actions and drama. Some say the story of `SPL' is weak. I disagree. The film is in fact a seamlessly-told character-driven drama, and the concluding chapter including the fierce battles between Sammo Hung and Donnie Yen ends with a big surprise. So here is my advice: Don't miss it.",1142208000,6,1922,4.467236467236467
1124227,2,7883639161,"Sammo Hung has a reputation in the martial art world as great as his reputation in films. Hung is truly one of the old school masters, a compatriot of Jackie chan, Yuen Biao and Yuen Wah since the 70's, seen with the great masters tak Hing and Bruce Lee, so when word gets out that he is doing a film with,; 7 sword and the Hero's Donnie, pandamonium breaks out, however this tired bit of tax write off is nothing more then a throw back to the corny bell bottomed and platform shoe detective vs Tong; kung fu fliks of the 70's,

  Donnie is a good actor, who does no acting in  this film but alot of mugging and Sammo has about 3 lines in the entire movie, the fight scenes are of course good but few and far between, not worth the effort, would have been better if Andy lau could bring it up to an adult level like Infernal Affairs. Sammo's US tv stint was a hit but his last 2 movies bombed out with US audiences.",1137283200,,915,4.094972067039106

That said, the fight scenes are absolutely top notch but id expect no less from Donnie Yen & Sammo Hung. The fight scenes are gritty & brutal, the final fight being the positive high note of action. That last fight, plus an ending I didn't see coming just added to the quality of the film in my opinion. The storyline I also found enjoyable & it had no problem keeping my interest from beginning to end.

I believe I am a very good judge of what people want to see when it comes to martial arts films. First, what makes this exceptional is that it has a good storyline. That's right folks, I said it has a good story, which makes sense. The acting is superb and the fight scenes are fantastic. But what would you expect from three veterans such as Donnie Yu, Simon Yam and Sammo Hung.

We also know that some of his movies suck.  I waited for an action scene.  I was especially hoping to see Donnie Yen kick some ass.  I now understand that Sammo Hung is also in it.  He must have been the fat, slow moving character, like Jabba the Hut.  So I was watching and it got boring and I decided to skip some of the talk and fast forward a little to the first action scene.  I went to 1.5x.  Talk talk talk talk.  I went to 10x.  Talk talk talk talk.  I went to 30x.  Talk, talk, scenery, boring, was that a punch that I just missed?  Back up!  No, my mistake.  Before I knew it I made it to 120x and there was still no action scenes and I pushed fast forward again but I realized that I could not go any faster and then it dawned on me that no matter how fast this movie runs, it's not exciting.

1125356,4,7883639161,"""SPL"" (also known as Killzone, which means absolutely nothing) is a very good and bleak cop thriller. Simon Yam and Donnie Yen lead a team of men who are trying to take down Sammo Hung's gangster character. The film depicts each man as both right and wrong in their actions. This is very interesting, and the whole film's theme revolves around how bad or negative actions have consequences. By the end of the film, you will see what I mean. The film only has two to three very small and short fight/shootout scenes leading up to the big finale. It is the last 30 minutes of the film when all hell breaks loose and Donnie Yen shows why he is an action God. I mean, wow. Simon Yam is also of note here for playing his usual calm and collected type of character (he also gets to kick butt in a small shootout scene). Sammo Hung kicks butt as usual as well. Director Wilson Yip is seriously the best director of action scenes around. This film is recommended to people who enjoy HK action, bleak film noirs, and films like Flash Point, Legend of Fist, and Ip Man 1 and 2.

1125485,2,7883639161,"I'm no expert on Hong Kong film. I love Hero, Ip Man, and Ip Man 2. I haven't seen much more than that. After reading the reviews for this film, I was excited to buy it and figured for 8 bucks, what was the big deal? Well, I wish I'd saved my 8 bucks.

First, the good: There are some great action sequences. Wu Jing, Donnie Yen, et al are all impressive. The acting isn't terrible, either. The premise of the plot is relatively interesting. Overall, it's a visually stimulating movie. However...

The bad: The execution of the plot is terrible. The screenplay is bad and jumpy. The narrative is all over the place, leaving you to figure out what's going on occasionally instead of steering the audience competently. I don't mind having to figure some things out, like when a film trusts its audience to be smart. This is the kind where the script is all over the place and messy. The fight scenes are not as awesome or brilliant or entertaining as Ip Man 1 and 2. With those, I felt like the actually brought the movie along. Here, a few of them felt thrown in just because they needed to do something. The characters are not well developed and all lack any type of arc. The ending is dreadful and does not reward the viewer for the poor film he/she sat through. I'd recommend passing on this film.",1358985600,,1299,4.385892116182573

 1. Apparently everything in China revolves around father's day. It's just like Christmas is to the United States.
 2. Super bad guys love being called very 5 minutes by their significant other. It means the world to them.

The fight scene toward the end with Donnie Yen was intense and brutal.  I simply loved this movie.  Is this movie better than Ip Man?  It depends on if you prefer martial arts to drama action.  I loved both movies.  Killzone had good cinematography and the music was great (I know it may sound stupid but the music was peaceful).

This movie is so good, that I will watch again and again; just like Ip Man.  Much better than Flashpoint but I will say that Flashpoint had a fight scene similar in intensity and had a babe that is unmatched in charm/cuteness.

Second, 'Kill Zone' is a horrible movie. It's strange how such a simple premise as ""cops investigate mob boss"" can be executed so poorly in this day-and-age. The main issue is that the protagonists are all horrible people. They falsify evidence, beat witnesses to support their claims, murder suspects, steal money, and love every second of it. And rather than being antiheros, we're meant to believe that these are our noble heroes

Sammo Hung's character is far more interesting and compassionate, and his story of juggling his life as a brutal mafioso with his wife and newborn son is by far the best part of the movie.

However, what everyone wants to see is Donnie Yen. Well, he isn't in it. About 20 minutes in, Donnie just comes out of nowhere to join the team, and then all but vanishes until a little over the hour mark. His fights are very good, and are iconic of his style, but there are only a grand total of four in the whole movie, and only two that are more than 30 seconds long.

The parking garage assault is a real wake-up-call with its intensity. Diminished somewhat by Donnie Yen's lack of emoting chops.
I just didn't care for the climactic fight. After the skill of the alley fight, it seemed like two guys slamming each other on the floor and not a heck of a lot more. (except for Donnie's wonderful slo-mo kick, complete with flying teeth). Sammo is a good fit here, those dead eyes of his really sell his character's more sadistic scenes.

1125861,5,7883639161,"Long time addicts of Hong Kong action flicks have, for too long now, felt like addicts.  ""Where's the good stuff that got me hooked?""  Many have wandered off into the good old chanbara slashers for a fix and if it wasn't for a handful of beautifully made movies out of Korea we'd have nowhere to go except our increasingly perverse seeming and overflowing dvd shelves with hardly a movie not seen 3, 4, 5 times.  So maybe someday they'll be erecting a little golden altar to Yip Wai Shun who is saving the genre with a power like that that first infused our then young bloodstreams.  If you are so old don't be surprised if ya get teary eyed seeing old Sammo and Donnie (who, it seems, don't get old) mixin' it up like you haven't seen out of China since, well, who's countin', too long.  Key here is Shun's respect for the talents and abilities of everyone in the cast.  Simon Yam, whose made every kind of movie there is, plays his role, as he often does, like he was born for it.  Jackie Wu, whose young talents have shone elsewhere, is here given a role where he can and must cut loose and he leaves no doubt but he's up to it.

It's worth a rental, and after that you have no use for it. Basically hand to hand is about two good fights. Donnie Yen vs Sammo Hung, and Donnie Yen vs Knife guy.

1125863,4,7883639161,"The very first film that featured the first Wilson Yip-Donnie Yen collaboration is ""SPL: Sha Po Lang"" (re-titled Killzone in the U.S.). This film is a welcome return to Hong Kong crime noir and cool martial arts action. It is easily one of the best action films of 2005 and has proven that the Yip and Yen tag team can bring out a quality motion picture, as they have since followed their success in ""Dragon Tiger Gate"", ""Flash Point"" and most notably ""IP MAN"".

Qui SHA is the power star, PO Jun is the ruinous star and Tan LANG is the flirting star.

Hong Kong 1994, Inspector Chan (Simon Yam) is a cop escorting the key witness to the hearing of triad kingpin, Wong Po (Sammo Hung). When an intentional accident kills the key witness, Po is set free, leaving only Chan and the child of the witness to his care. Now, 3 years have passed and Inspector Chan is a cop carrying a grudge against Wong Po, and he is still caring for the child. Chan is now on the road to retirement after being diagnosed with brain tumor, and  Inspector Ma (Donnie Yen) is now the newly appointed commander to take over Chan's post in 3 days. Chan's unit (made up of Danny Summer, Ken Chang and Liu Kai-Chi) is furious that they agree to go to extreme lengths to put Wong Po behind bars, those steps include framing Po for murder and even stealing his money. Inspector Ma is caught in a crossfire between Chan and Wong Po as the final reckoning is about to unravel...

""SPL"" is a gripping cop drama that blends elements of noir and martial arts action. While martial arts films have been branded with the stereotypical simple plot, director Wilson Yip manages to build the storyline around its characters led by Simon Yam, Sammo Hung and Donnie Yen. The cops in the film have their own share of humanity, their lives feel very real as they are burdened with family and duty. Wilson Yip successfully brings the lives of our cops into exposition and he also never forgets to bring forth a needed humanity to its main antagonist played by Sammo Hung; Wong Po is one ruthless and evil individual, but never for one minute do the viewer forgets that he is also capable of emotion as exhibited with his loving exchanges with his wife and month old baby. The cops, Sum and Wah (Danny Summer and Liu Kai Chi respectively) have failures in their family affairs as their duties as policemen always seemed to take precedence. It was nice for Yip to set up their final meetings/conversation with those they love. Ma is a man who had badly beaten a drug trafficker in the past that the suspect had suffered brain damage, yet we see Ma trying to atone for his mistake as demonstrated by his implied weekly visits to the former drug dealer.

All these serve up to bring emotion into the screenplay and it truly does succeed in the film's build up towards its climax. The screenplay also manages to bring several morality questions as we see Chan's unit stoop to lengths quite questionable to our eyes. ""Obsession can bring one closer to ruin when he becomes the one thing he fights against..."" may well also be the film's central theme. Yes, ""SPL"" does manage to pitch in an intricate storyline that involve the morality questions a righteous cop may face. Sure these guys are total coolness, even when they are being corrupt, because they may seem to have an honorable goal to some eyes. In the world of ""SPL"", everyone has their own challenges and anger to deal with. Even bad guys while ruthless and uncaring on the outside, may have a sense of humanity on the inside.

While the film's emotional sequences help set up the film's climax, to some it may serve to hamper the film's pace by downplaying on the action scenes. But the action (choreographed by Donnie Yen himself) delivers in spades, as we see a very intensity-filled baton versus knife alleyway fight between Donnie Yen and Jing Wu (who plays Wong Po`s chief enforcer) that precedes the one with Hung and Yen achieved `iconic status`. The fight was nicely paced and excellently shot as we see Yip manipulate the camera movements to pans, zoom outs and zoom ins for close ups to exhibit the fight`s emotion. The Donnie Yen and Sammo Hung final fight was also excellently executed, but it was arguably a little outshined by the fight before. Yen utilized the style that defined his character with the use of Boxing, Judo, Jiu-Jitsu accompanied by stiff-legged kicks. While the fight that preceded the Yen-Sammo Hung encounter, is smartly played to its build ups, as the final fight adding the closing remark and climactic end.

""SPL"" isn't exactly an action-packed affair, but there is some nice bits of action dispersed throughout, it just leaves a very strong impression that it is a balls-to-walls actioner because of the way it builds up on its final climactic encounter, when the film is actually more of a crime drama than a martial arts film. The action in ""SPL"" is exquisitely played and the set up is just one effective exclamation point. The viewer could sense that the final encounter would be bad, just how bad it would be just kept me totally gripped by its screenplay--and when I saw its climax, I was literally blown away due to the impact in its narrative. The film may have a bit of a bombastic style as the soundtrack by Chan Kwong-Wing (Infernal Affairs) pitches the film's sequences with all guns blazing.

Wilson Yip manages to engage his audience not by the film's storyline (admittedly, the film's plot isn't original), or by its script and performances, granted the film's story is quite generically simple and it does make its symbolic sub-theme a little irrelevant; but ""SPL"" has tons of cinematic flamboyance that whatever flaws it does have, they could easily be forgotten--even Donnie Yen's occasional over-acting is forgiven. ""SPL"" is a lot better than most crime thrillers as it manages to channel come factors of unpredictability, with its climax being one tragic big bang. Wilson Yip and Donnie Yen has delivered one of the most solid action films of 2005.

Highly Recommended! [4  Stars]",1247961600,2,6048,4.670422535211268
1125864,5,7883639161,"KILL ZONE

Let it be known that I am a huge fan of these kinds of films and in fact own every Dragon Dynasty release that they have put out thus far. I was thinking the other day that other than ""The Protector"" starring Tony Jaa I have not reviewed any of the Dragon Dynasty releases. I decided that the best place to start would be with the first release from the company and that is this wonderful film called ""SPL"" or by this release ""Kill Zone"". If you are like me you have the original release but for the average viewer this is probably the best way to go, and the special features are great.

Kill Zone is about a group of cops who after countless times of trying to put away the bad guy decide it is time to take the law into their own hands. Det. Chan Kwok Chung [Simon Yam] is the leader of this group of officers who has a tumor and is nearing the end of his career. So before he exits the game and after taking in the daughter of a witness killed by the lead villain he must take down Wong Po [Sammo Hung]. Enter Insp. Ma Kwun [Donnie Yen] who will be taking over for Chung after he retires is on the fence about what role he should play after he learns of the officer's vigilante ways. So the film progress over some of the best action and scenes ever witnessed by my eyes leading to a final showdown between Donnie and Sammo which features some great MMA style moves including some great Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu techniques.

This is easily one of the most entertaining films one could have in their collection and to not own it seems a little off to me. This film has that don't become what you hate feeling to it as the officers become what they wanted to stop in the first place. I have always loved these types of films, the idea of taking action yourself and handling business on your own is appealing no matter who you are. The noir style and look of the film only adds to the atmosphere and makes it feel a bit real. The surprising thing about this movie is that I have heard some people speak down on this film, I have no idea why. This has revenge, action, fights, and basically all that is required to have a good time.

The fight scenes at least in my opinion feel real [excluding certain moments] and are very entertaining and I love that fact that some Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is applied in the film particularly in the final battle between Donnie and Sammo. Every one did a great job in this film particularly Sammo and Simon Yam who are really the leads of this film not only in the credits along with Donnie but these two hold this film even higher with the tension between them. Donnie's character seems cool and does an excellent job especially since his character lands in the middle of a war. But Simon and Sammo play their characters so real that it seems they really hate each other.

I have heard both negative and positive things about this film but in eyes this is a classic, how could it be any thing less?

What you get until then is a taught thriller that has interesting characters. This film is very stylish and and well-directed.

1125968,3,7883639161,"Ok, I hope that anyone reading this gives me a chance to explain my rating. I know how big Kill Zone is and my friends don't hesitate to tell me either. I can understand because anything with the amazing Sammo Hung and Donnie Yen is a must see. So Kill Zone is no doubt incredible but trust me when I say how much I cannot overlook its huge flaw.

Basically Kill Zone is very simple, Sammo Hung (Wong Po) is a triad boss who cant seem to be detained. Yen (Ma Kwun) among others is a hard working detective trying to put Wong Po behind bars but it seems that Wong Po runs everything, even some cops. Wong Po is very slick and finds his way out every time he gets captured. Yen seems to be the only detective that is capable of finding him and taking him down but his partners are getting cut down quickly. When Kwun has a huge dispute with his superiors over how the case is being handled, he quits and this is where the real action begins. The question now is if Kwun can take out a vicious force of triads by himself and survive to tell about it.

SPL had amazing fight scenes, choreography, stunts, and camera work. Especially the angles, great slow motion takes and replays on breath taking stunts. The problem was not the story for me but the overall pacing was awful. The film was very slow and the fight scenes were badly placed. If the action was managed better by maybe putting some more in the middle and some in the beginning, the film would have been the classic it could have been. You literally ask yourself if you have the right movie because the opening scene feels like it takes 25 to 30 minutes with boring talk and no action.

What I loved about SPL was the realness and grit of the fight scenes in there. Yen did an amazing job choreographing the scenes in there and he showed amazing athleticism and range with his stunts. For me the acting was not a problem, the story was not a problem, but overall SPL gets 3 stars for great action scenes but bad pacing and placing of the scenes. It's a good film worth watching for the battle between Yen and Hung. Also the fight between Yen and that crazy guy with the white jacket was sick.

....not. There's one thing they're forgetting: A good storyline. A few minutes in, I was thinking ""OK, did they accidentally place this under the Action genre instead of the Drama section?"" But 10 minutes later: Time to switch to Action mode. A few cops in Hong Kong, one with a Tumor and is about to retire, raiding a drug house. Ooh, this is exciting!!!!!

Killzone is a thriller from the director of Flashpoint, which is a Martial Arts action flick that certainly had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I knew this would have a little more meat in the bun for me since I liked Flashpoint a lot. And this movie did have SOME meat in the bun- a dark, complex action thriller that has good fight scenes and good blood and gore. But on the other hand, this movie just bores me to tears.

Had it not have been for the fight scenes, this would have been a one star review. It is too slow to be an action movie in general, too depressing to be a cop drama, and too over-the-top to be a drama in general.

1125976,4,7883639161,"""Kill Zone"" or ""SPL"" as it was called in China, is an action packed police drama starring the inimitable Donnie Yen, the tough guy extraordinaire Simon Yam, and of course the legendary Sammo Hung. It also stars, as a knife wielding henchman/hitman, the amazing Wu Jing, or Jacky Wu, whose career never really took off outside of mainland China, but whose incredible martial and acrobatic skill is almost unrivalled in cinema today.

The story of cops v. robbers is not exactly new. They've made it very modern with moles, plot twists, questions of loaylty, and questions about the main characters character, but in essence it is more or less 'only' what you'd expect from a modern police film. The action is top class, as you'd expect with names like these on the poster. Especially the fights between Yen and Wu, which was actually more or less improvised as they went along, and between Yen and Hung, the final fight, are worthy of notice. Here must be given praise to Donnie Yen for his ability to renew himself and stay modern in his choreography. His use of different styles of fighting, adding different feels to the scenes, is truely unique. Many choreographers try and fail, but Yen does it really well.

The feel of the entire film, the darkness, the gloom, the threat of impending violence is well acted out and well directed. Although this being a action film, it is still very much character driven. Not your run of the mill 'Hong Kong Film'. I use the term HK Film only reluctantly, because it usually connotates something second rate and unworthy, which films from Hong Kong seldomly are.

1126093,4,7883639161,"SPL (or Killzone as it is generically labeled in the States) is named for stars in Chinese Astrology that can be seen as either good or evil depending on where they show up in the heavens...and that pretty accurately sums up the message of the film: the greyness of good and evil and where you draw that line.

Sammo Hung is a merciless triad boss by the name of Wong Po. Po would do anything to keep himself out of jail, including killing cops, informants, and their families. Yet, above all this, Po has a real interest in being a father and takes a shine to children. Simon Yam however, is a police detective that has been on the receiving end of Po's ruthlessness and has adopted the daughter of an informant he could not protect. Detective Chan doesn't have much time left to put Po away and his desperation leads to him and his team taking drastic, illegal measures to try and put Po away. Caught up in the middle of all this is Donnie Yen as Detective Kwan, the man who will be taking over Chan's team after he retires. He's trying to cope with his past...but will it last?

SPL (Killzone) is a very good HK cop action drama. It's not exactly a straight martial arts film though it does have plenty of that and it's very good. It is essentially what you'd get if you removed the humor of Police Story and then mixed what you had left with Infernal Affairs and added a dash more implausibility. There is a piece of evidence in this movie that anybody with a working knowledge of the legal system would know that the person it involves would be damned no matter what yet...you'll know it when you see it. I don't want to give too much away. Is it unreal? Possibly (though I don't have any knowledge of the Chinese Legal system). But that level of implausibility is usually par for the course when it comes to over the top cop dramas so it doesn't take away from the film very much.

Everything else is top notch and there are a few things in this movie that are downright shocking. Not the least of which is that Sammo Hung can play such a good villain (though nothing compared to his sadistic assassin underling Jack). It's interesting to think of an action comedian such as Sammo playing such an unfunny and affecting villain. Donnie Yen really deserves more praise and appreciation than he gets. He truly is an unsung action star.

For years these 2 have starred in many martial arts movies and delivered top notch fights, but have never faced head to head.  So I watched.  Wow.  The ""entire"" movie was actually wonderful.

Kill Zone really only has 2 major fights, both at the end, but the drama and emotions throughout the movie are so powerful, you can feel the emotions in these 2 fights.  The cast is wonderful.  The story is superb.  Its a tale of revenge told like almost no other.  I absouletly loved it.  The good cops, led by the Simon Yam charcater, are like family.  When they begin to perish under the criminal boss Po (Sammo Hung) and his handy 2nd in command, the good guys become bad to get revenge.  The Donnie Yen character shows up, and discovers the cops secrets for revenge, and he tries to stop them at first, but later he gets just as emotionally involved.

I enjoyed the way in which the movie was presented, and how it progressed.  Finally a movie, especially martial arts, with flashback scenes that are not cheesy, but very important for the story.

1126213,1,7883639161,"i have no idea how this movie managed to garner the reviews it has.  that this has been as heralded as it has shows a serious lack of respect for the genre.  this is a movie that has high aspirations, but low standards, disappointing both the cinema connoisseur AND action geek within me.

i respect what this movie was trying to do.  it wanted to be a crime thriller with a twist of hong kong action.  i've got no problem with that, and in fact i've been waiting for a movie like that for years.  but the movie failed to execute this plan properly, borrowing the wrong aspects from each of its derivative genres and turning it into the poster child of movies cited as reasons why action cinema deserves no legitimate consideration.

the basic premise was to make a crime drama, but for the violent sequences to be choreographed into stylistic martial arts fighting.  the problem came when the filmmakers tried to mesh the two- they didn't know which elements to use from which genre.  the crime drama is filmed like an assembly-line fight movie, with a confusing jumble of flashbacks ruining the pretty opening shot: pulse-light clips of a criminal being released from prison with 'hard' music behind it, followed by a two-years-in-ten-seconds montage of a man adopting a little girl with 'drama' music behind it.  i was willing to forgive all this, because the acting is actually very good here, and i convinced myself that the explosion of violence i was anticipating would make everything worthwhile, sort of 'equilibrium' style.

now, i've got a straight-boy crush on donnie yen, his action is top-notch, but what he tried to do here was ruined by the directing/editing.  firstly, the fights are sped up SO MUCH that i had a hard time figuring out what was going on!  people ran into each other, became a blur of hands, then broke apart, one of them maybe holding a bloody nose or something.  this is unneccesary.  katsu shintaro taught me that you don't need to speed film up for a man to be lightning-fast on camera.  'oldboy' taught me that you don't need to speed film up to have a totally captivating hand-to hand fight.  this movie couldn't wrap up the fight scenes fast enough.

second, the fights broke into the ridiculous on occasion.  i don't like wires, i don't like cg, and i DON'T like movie scenes that look like they were drawn by a manga artist.  the guy in white who used a knife looked like he walked straight out of 'blade of the immortal' into this movie.  now, if that was the kind of movie i was watching, i wouldn't have had any problem with that.  but as mentioned, this movie was also trying to be a legitimate crime drama, so having skinny donnie yen THROW sammo hung over his head into a glass statue kind of tends to ruin any dramatic merit they may have earlier built up.

so, since the brush of action had already corrupted the dramatic template, i still would have forgiven the movie if the action had been good enough.  mind you, i'm thrilled and content to have one single fight scene in a movie, so long as it's well filmed and the rest of the movie is good enough to watch as well.  but this movie was filmed like an action movie, so i unconsciously came to expect there to be more action than i got.  the fights were few, fairly compacted together, and entirely too brief.  when they happened, i had no idea what had just occurred, only that two of the men who HAD been standing were now lying on the floor.

the ending was terrible, i'm sorry to say.  i like a good surprise, but not when it comes at the cost of surprising the screenwriter.  it's like everybody got up to that point and couldn't figure out how to arrive at the ending they wanted, so they resorted to one of those age-old comic book deceits that even hong kong cinema has left behind at this point.

i'm sorry.  i REALLY wanted to like this movie, and i tried to do so throughout the entire thing.  the credits were pretty, the opening and closing shots were actually beautifully filmed, the acting was better than the writing deserved, and the fights probably WERE pretty good, if you watched them in slow motion.

but my expectations were as high as the filmmaker's aspirations were- and my final impressions ended up as disappointingly low as the filmmaker's standards did.

'the protector', also available on dragon dynasty, is a much better martial arts movie, featuring possibly the first ever filmed battle between capoeira and muay thai styles.  'oldboy' is an exceptional crime drama, with legitimate film merit, that happens to have an amazing fight sequence somewhere in the middle.  'breaking news' is a hong kong treat that properly showcases how to have a thoughtful action movie.

there's better out there.  don't be fooled by great reviews or, as i was, by a drool-worthy trailer.  kill zone disappoints, which in itself is a disappointment.  i expected so much more from this line-up.",1175731200,4,4911,4.611751152073733

Let me first say that I like the premise, it's the details that don't make sense.  You have multidimensional characters.  All have flaws.  You soon find that the good guys aren't really that good and the bad guys (although despicable) have some redeeming qualities.  Sammo is the baddy this time, in a role reversal from the norm.  Donnie is a good guy, replacing a dying, bulldog detective who has dedicated his life to destroying the big bad boss (Sammo).  The cops are a little dirty, but for understandable, possibly noble reasons.  Sammo is bad, but cares about his family.

So the problem is that the legal issues just don't add up.  We've all watched enough Law and Order or CSI to know that you don't have to be the one pulling the trigger to be persecuted for murder.  And here lies the critical flaw.  The entire plot pivots on a murder (of one of the cops), ordered by Sammo but they can't bring him in.  So the cops cheat and try to frame Sammo.  Everything goes to crap over this majorly flawed plot device.

This confusing mess of a film almost has what it takes.  Almost.  Even the ending has an interesting twist, but I didn't care because the lead in didn't make logical sense.  A good film should suspend disbelief.  This one encouraged it.  I bought it and I'll watch it again, but only for the fight scenes.  It reminds me of ""The Game of Death"".  I love the fights, but hate the rest.  I spend my time skipping to the good stuff.  I'm betting you'll do the same with this action crime thriller, that's heavy on the action, nonsense on the crime, and hardly a thriller.",1168041600,4,1807,4.527950310559007

The other reviewers are not exagerating or over-emphasizing how great this film is. It's totally terrific! The beginning, middle and ending of the film is just great!

As for the choreographed action scenes--they are the best I have ever seen. Donnie Yen is just outstanding! The film centers around a group of cops who have attempted to put a crime boss named Po (Sammo Hung) behind bars. However, they have run out of patience and decide to frame him for a crime he didn't commit. And I can tell you, in the action scenes, Sammo can move as quickly as anyone can. Don't let his physique fool you. He's lightening quick.

When Ma (Donnie Yen) is pegged as the replacement for Detective Chan (Simon Yam) he finds that he is in a pretty tangled predicatment. With Detective Chan making up rules as he tries to nab Po, Ma finds his loyalties to Chan in question. However, he views things from a distance. He is a clean cop, and wants to catch the bad guys the right way. The fight scenes with him in this film are so realistic, they are incredible. Please viewers, do not give away this film's ending. It's incredible. I never expected the ending of this film coming. It totally floored me. Highly recommended. [Stars: 5+]",1165104000,49,1608,4.407407407407407
1126330,5,7883639161,"SPL aka Saat Po Long/Sha Po Lang aka Kill Zone is the best Hong Kong actioner in years, featuring superb performances from Donnie Yen, Sammo Hung and Simon Yam and some seriously vicious I'm-not-showing-off-I-really-want-to-kill-you fight scenes.

The plot is fairly standard, with Yam's dying cop on the verge of retirement crossing the line to put away Hung's very unpleasant gang lord (there's NOTHING loveable about Sammo here), implicating his replacement Yen and dooming his men as everything goes seriously wrong, but it's the execution that raises it above the norm. Aside from the brutal and convincing fight scenes superbly staged by Yen, Wai-Sun Yip's direction of the film around them is particularly strong, managing to balance a stylish but not overpowering visual sense with a gravitas and grasp of character that gives the inevitable violence more weight. That's not to say there aren't plotholes - in one scene Hung's wife is incapable of having children and in the next she's got a one-month old child, while no police force in the world would release a criminal when they have video footage of him playing golf with an undercover cop's head even if he doesn't deliver the coup de grace - but there are fewer than usual for the genre, and if you can make allowances the strengths far outweigh them. Very, very impressive.

Amazingly, not only does the US DVD have more special features than the Hong Kong version, but for possibly the first time in their history the Weinsteins have resisted the temptation to cut an Asian film to ribbons and rescore it for the US market!",1164672000,5,1590,4.92910447761194
1126331,5,7883639161,"SPL (or ""Kill Zone"", which is the ridiculous American title for this movie) is a return to the gritty, hard core action movies from Hong Kong cinema's heyday when John Woo and Ringo Lam ruled the roost with their brilliant, hyperactive bullet ballets. Directed by Wilson Yip and featuring some of HK's  greatest veteran action stars, Sammo Hung (Prodigal Son, Pedicab Driver), Donnie Yen (Iron Monkey) and Simon Yam , SPL  is one helluva ""edge of your seat"" roller coaster ride of a movie for HK action fans. It is relentless, tragic, dark and furious, detailing the story of a retiring HK cop (Simon Yam) with terminal brain cancer, dead set on putting the one triad nemesis (Sammo Hung) of his entire career behind bars before he calls it a day and hands over his job to his replacement (Donnie Yen). Aside from the excellent and lightning-fast action choreography by Donnie Yen, this story starts off as a nail-biting, dramatic showdown between Simon Lam's police inspector and Sammo Hung's brutal triad kingpin, building tension with each relentless scene, but ends crashing to a tragic climax on Father's Day. The theme of fatherhood is the connective tissue for all these characters: while Simon's character agonizes over the prospect of not being able to take care of his godchild due to his brain cancer; Donnie's character deals with carrying on his father's legacy as a policeman; another cop deals with reuniting with his daughter after 10 years apart; another cop deals with his long bitterness toward his father; and crime kingpin Sammo is experiencing the joys of his very first Father's day, after suffering through his wife's two previous miscarriages. As time ticks away, methods become more lawless and brutal, with plot twists becoming more convoluted. Sha Po Long delivers the goods with some of the most impressive fight sequences ever filmed, coupled with strong performances and brilliant cinematography. The ending is a shocker, as Sammo's character resounds the poignant message echoes throughout the entire movie: ""God is fair"". SPL sets a new standard for HK cinema and is a proud new addition to the HK's great cinematic canon. Go check this out.",1160956800,15,2174,5.019390581717452

1126333,5,7883639161,"SPL is probably the best Hong Kong film I saw in the last 10 years.

Plot: I thought the plot was very nice. It was tightly crafted, for the most part, just enough character development without holding up the film. I like how the plot slowly ease in the action sequences. This is essentially a story first film, rather than a story complimenting martial arts like in Tom Yum Goong. If there is a flaw in the plot, it has to be the fact that Sammo Hung got too little screen time. I mean, they could have done more to show his operations and his methods and more of his brother henchmens. I thought there could be more story to his character.

Acting:

Donnie Yen: This is probably his best acting work to date. At least I get a sense that he is acting in every scene and not just when the camera focus on him. I plays the rookie cop pretty well. If there is a weakness, I will say that he did not show enough intensity. Especially at the end of the movie leading up to the final fight scenes. There should be a burning intense look in him. But I didn't get that.

Simon Yam: As usual, this guy plays the same character in almost every cop film. But as usual, he is pretty good as that character. He show his toughness and vulnerability pretty well. A little more emotions could help though. Nothing to complain about anycase.

Sammo Hung: In terms of physicality, I couldn't imagine a better fit than Hung to play a triad leader. He has the looks, the charisma, and the skills to play it right. I felt like Hung was the weakest of the three though. I felt like he didn't have the voice. It didn't have the leadership quality to it. As for acting, he got too little screen time and he was too subtle at times. He is at his best however when he is playing his character up to his arrogance. Such as smoking a cigar or banging the bottle on the railing of the steps and such. He had the presence.

Wu Jing: Ok, his character was awesome in this movie. His fighting ability was vastly superior than in any of his previous works. But I still don't see much leading man material in this guy. His face is not that hero type face. He doesn't have Jet Li's boyish handsome looks or Donnie's cocky, yet mature style. It is hard to judge his acting because he got wayyyy little screen time. But character wise, he was awesome. Perhaps the movie memorable in the entire film.

Fight scenes

First of all, this is the best hong kong choreography I seen for a while now. I thought everyone did at least a good job on the fights. And best of all, very little wirework. I don't see how people say Donnie Yen didn't take the fight sequences seriously. I mean, it was serious. And Violent. And satisfying. If I have a complain, I have to say the director sometimes move the camera in the wrong spots. Especially during quick action scenes with a lot of striking moves. The camera wasn't still or far enough. Not that it matters too much.

Donnie Yen vs. Wu Jing: Great fight sequence. Wu Jing absolutely stole the show early on killing cops left and right. I like how there is a lot of stoppage and dodging between Yen And Wu. It makes the fight so much more realistic. There is nothing super special about this fight, but the quality never drops. Plus the emotion and coolness factors in.

Donnie Yen vs. Sammo Hung: My favorite fight scene is the end fight between Yen and Hung. I mean, how good was that? While the striking choreography wasn't that great, it totally makes up for it with terrific grappling and ground fighting. Brutal, realistic, and different. Very nice job.

Overall: A dark gritty action crime flick with great martial art sequences and a tightly woven story. Highly recommanded.

1126335,5,7883639161,"""Kill Zone"" - known properly as Sha Po Lang (and improperly as Saat Po Long on the IMDb) - is quite simply one of the finest Hong Kong action movies of all time.  It draws heavily on the City Noir genre established and epitomised by John Woo in the 1980s, with corrupt cops and evil crime bosses at every turn.  Unlike Woo's movies, the action here is mostly in the realm of martial arts, not gunplay.  Donnie Yen, a long established Hong Kong star only recently making his North American debut in Shanghai Knights, plays a policeman newly assigned to a squad led by Simon Yam, who is hellbent on punishing crime boss Sammo Hung by any means necessary.  The fighting in this movie is beyond belief - Yen is said to have set out to one-up ""Ong Bak"" and re-energize Hong Kong fight cinema.  Yen, along with Sammo Hung (an old hand at chinese kung-fu movies) and Wu Jing take the fights to the next level.  The alley fight between Wu and Yen is a standout - supposedly the director told them to just fight it out, and Yen told Wu to go as hard as possible, because he could take anything Wu threw at him.  The story is also first-rate, and in fact takes up much more of the movie than the fighting does.  This is no Tony Jaa one-note story, this is an epic exploration of the dark side of man.  I could go on for pages, but trust me: you owe it to yourself to see this movie.",1156377600,28,1372,4.206106870229007
1126336,1,7883639161,"It's been years since I've had the pleasure of seeing a genuine Hong Kong action movie on the big screen. I was prepared for some great fights, mad action, and stylized violence swathed in glorious melodrama. Unfortunately, the melodrama in SPL was a wet blanket that choked the life out of this film.

Our story has a band of cops led by Inspector Chang (Simon Yam) in hot pursuit of Wang Ho (Sammo Hung), a dastardly criminal who the law can't get its claws into. Entering the fray is Inspector Ma (Donnie Yen), a handsome hot shot cop. Add to this story the elements which push it into laughable extremes. Inspector Chang has adopted the child of two Wong Ma victims. The little girl's future looks bleak as Chang has an inoperable brain tumor. This father/child theme is echoed in all of Chang's underlings - all of whom are either estranged from their fathers or children. Additionally, Wong Ma is a new father after his wife has had several miscarriages. Inspector Ma, meanwhile, has his own ""child"" to tend for in the form of a former criminal that Ma turned into a ""half wit"" with a well-placed punch years before. All of this adds up to something resembling a James Ellroy story directed by Douglas Sirk. SPL is so over the top that it makes John Woo look as restrained as Vittorio De Sica.

It's hard to dislike Sammo, even as a remorseless golf-loving drug trafficker but it's easy to forget that he's even in the film as he only engages in fisticuffs twice. The gun and knife fights are rather ho-hum, fitting right in with this dreary little film. If this is the best that Hong Kong can currently offer it makes me year for the old days and pray that Hong Kong can see a better tomorrow.

Final Note: I don't often look for or care about historical inaccuracies in a film unless I'm bored. This movie made a big point to set itself in 1997, a crucial year in HK history. However, all of the characters carried modern cell phones and a major scene takes place where a 2005 iPod campaign billboard is distractingly visible.",1149292800,4,2034,4.521739130434782
1126337,5,7883639161,"sammo hung is a legend in asian cinema. he went face to face with the master Bruce Lee in the opening sequence in enter the dragon. as i recalled, he often play that comedic fatso who got bullied on but somehow by the end of the movie, his kung fu skills turned him into the hero. superstar donnie yen on the other hand is undoubtedly the most underrated, under appreciated actor by hollywoods.

 i love this movie because it is not what i thought it would be. it started out slow. i thought ah, this is going to be another cops vs robbers story. however, it was not like the 80's classic CHIPS where punch and john never draw their guns, just chasing the bad guys around. SPL's story line was simple but quite captivating and emotional. the line between right and wrong is blurred as the good guys protect and serve. do as i say but not as i do!!! i was pleasantly surprised at how good and enjoyable it is the minute donnie yen appears on the screen. i like the theme of brotherhood, and loyalty. the fight scenes were cool, fresh, very original and well done. donnie yen did a great job choreographing the actions and fight scenes. the camera slowed down and sped up at the right moments to show energy and emotions. the music was really cool pumping at the right moment which enhanced our sense of tension, excitement and anticipation. my favorite fight scenes was the alley fight between donnie and the assasin. it was very original and way up there similar to the one between donnie and jet li in once upon a time in china part 2. mr. yen is a legend in his own rights. . !! i watched the movie a few times already just to appreciate the speed, continuity and fluidity of the fight scenes.

 well, sammo hung is a much bigger star today and still is a fatso [no disrepect intended!!!]. i still like his works and he still kicks ass. he did some pretty amazing fight scenes at the end. he did not make me laugh in this film. i was waiting for him to say something funny. warning, sammo was pretty brutal and this movie was very violent. i love the ending as often seen in classic asian cinema, where the main character is often killed off in the end. this is a movie that hollywood can't make, probably run way out of budget. hurray for asian cinema. hollywoods, take notice!!! punch and john, are you watching!!!!",1145923200,,2319,4.373549883990719
1126338,5,7883639161,"SPL aka Saat Po Long/Sha Po Lang is definitely one where you need to import the Asian DVD, since the Weinsteins have picked up English-language rights, which means we can expect the film to be rescored by a cheap computer program, dubbed into English by failed childrens' TV presenters and cut to buggery - which is pretty criminal considering this is the best Hong Kong actioner in years, featuring superb performances from Donnie Yen, Sammo Hung and Simon Yam and some seriously vicious I'm-not-showing-off-I-really-want-to-kill-you fight scenes.

7900210,4,7883639161,"This was pretty much the movie that redeemed Donnie Yen for me. For years he was a weird figure in the industry that seemed to be everywhere and embodied almost a parody of what HK film was all about. He under cranked the camera for action sequences to the point where he was throwing 100's of punches at a time and the dust packets that let you know someone got punched were turning into sand bags practically exploding. Here, he is surprisingly restrained and surrounded by not only better actors like Simon Yam but also better action performers like Sammo Hung. Turns out Donnie Yen can be pretty humble when he needs to be even if he still gets to be the lead.

It to everyone's benefit and especially his own. Instead of playing opposite a beat up stunt man, he gets Sammo Hung and Andy On. Instead of acting upside a HK no name actor, he acts opposite the super talented Simon Yam. Donnie Yen also plays into aspects of their work that you're not expecting. Simon Yam always seems menacing but it's different from being able to menace when the rubber meets the road. Yen might look like a Liam Neeson sad dad at times but when the physical portions come he seems like a monster. Sammo Hung normally plays comedy but in his scenes with Yam and Yen seems like scariest monster in the room. It's a cool thing to see for those of us who have spent most of our lives binge watching their work. Even as they are all getting older, they still got new tricks. You also still get all the violent and wild action sequences you were hoping for along with the Michael Mann's Thief inspired visuals that define so much of HK  action cinema
