8578918,3,B00C9LNT74,"I found this movie to be a good b-horror film that would have been great to catch on cable, Netflix, or Amazon Prime. It is a fairly novel (though not unique) plot, and the acting was decent enough to make for a pretty decent experience. No real scares or chilling moments, but it does a better job than I think the one star reviews give it credit for. Having said that, bottom line, I cant recommend this as a rental. But, if you happen to catch it for free some time in the future, it's worth giving it a try - it is a true three-star, ""it's OK"" movie.",1419379200,,554,4.091743119266055

8578920,3,B00C9LNT74,"This movie demonstrated some good choices. The story was well crafted. The gradual unfolding of the backstory regarding the Chinese woman was very effective. Perhaps then it was the acting that brought it down. I just didn't get excited at all about anything that was going on. It was purely cerebral. I enjoyed solving the puzzle of what was the agenda and why. Also, deciphering the fortune cookie prophecies and what they meant. I just didn't feel it. Neither did the characters really. I remember thinking that as I watched. They reacted to the bizarre and supernatural occurences as if it happened every day. They accepted their plight too quickly and painlessly. ""Oh man.. Its the Chinese ghost revenge. I should''ve known that was coming. Pass the beer."" The only guy who got excited at times was the one with the beads. he protags or antags are the vehicle through which the audience derives the tension and suspense and shocks that make good horror. We are supposed to empathize with someone and get into their POV and feel it. While it was an interesting mental exercise, and so it wasn't a complete bust, horror is a visceral experience too (or it should be).",1400889600,2,1170,4.768472906403941
8578921,1,B00C9LNT74,"I tried to sit through this movie 3 different times ad still have never made it to the end. This movie is so boring it puts you to sleep and thats saying something coming from me. I enjoy watching B rated horror movies and have see a ton of them  It's not as bad as ""1972 Yellow House"" But, it boring. If you have trouble sleeping this movie is a good alternative  to taking sleeping pills.",1399766400,,390,4.118421052631579
8578922,5,B00C9LNT74,"This is a very well-crafted old-school horror movie featuring a small but excellent cast, sensitive direction, fine cinematography, a complex and interesting story line and a gorgeous musical score. Instead of displaying numerous over-the-top shocking blood and gore scenes that seem to be essential in most contemporary horror films, this movie instead relies upon character development, a thorough story exposition, and a slow-building tension that finally reaches its climax in the penultimate scene. This is old-fashioned horror in the style of ""The Innocents"" (1961) and ""The Haunting"" (1963). Horror viewers who are so inured to slam-bang killings and a myriad of CGI effects are probably not going to appreciate this film. It would be like a heavy-metal junkie suddenly listening to chamber music - the subtleties and nuances of expression would most likely be lost on them. But for those horror fans whose senses have not been totally dulled by absurd exploitation cinema, this movie will be a real treat. I must say I found it very refreshing, and certainly containing enough creeps and scares to satisfy my horror-lust.",1395360000,,1129,5.312849162011173
8578923,1,B00C9LNT74,"Terrible terrible movie. Some of the worst acting I have ever seen and I watch a lot of low budget films. I actually feel like I should get my money back. Stupid story, bad camera work, I could go on and on, don't watch this.",1393027200,,225,4.022222222222222
8578924,2,B00C9LNT74,"Two couples go to a cabin in the woods, cue spinner....and we get death by fortune cookie. Okay the cabin is really a home and their fortune cookies, hand written in Chinese are very grim. No phone reception, the car has been disabled, and miles from the nearest whatever, I think you know the set up.

In this case the story has a unique angle to it as this is not your typical fortune cookie gone bad movie. The problem with the film was primarily the characters. They were far too serious. Most horror films have an occasional light or dark comedy moment to break things up, this one did not. I found the characters to be annoying. At almost 2 hours, the film spends time to build character, but doesn't do it effectively.

There were a few things that were unusual. For instance, when they confirm they have a problem and catch it on camera, they are fairly calm about it. When the first person dies, they just bury that individual in the back yard like they are still living in Chicago. Seriously?  I would of had Carl in a Trekkie shirt say, ""Dammit Jim. I'm a doctor, not a grave digger!""

The film is different in scope, but is far too long and lacks entertainment value.",1388793600,3,1179,4.394495412844036

Acting was great and believable.  The ending was nce and disturbing as a horror/thriller should be.  I recommend this film for any indie horror fan!!!",1374883200,2,306,4.826923076923077
