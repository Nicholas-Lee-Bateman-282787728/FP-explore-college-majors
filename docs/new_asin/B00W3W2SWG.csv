8712064,4,B00W3W2SWG,"From Siberia with Love, broadcast in the summer of 1992, is the fourth Lupin made for TV special. This time Lupin is on the hunt for 500 tons of Romanov gold lost after the Russian revolution of 1917. Standing in his way is perhaps the most terrifying enemy Lupin has ever faced, the grandson of the mad Russian monk Rasputin. The ancestor named Rasputon is so powerful that he exerts control of President Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev. He EVEN appears to control Goemon if that seems possible. Can even Lupin win against a foe who literally possesses supernatural powers?

The Japanese are notorious for shortcutting on animation and From Siberia with Love is no exception. In particular the animators showed intense action by literally repeating the same frames of animation 3 times. On other occasions animators would pan in and out quickly on static images to give the illusion of action. Having said that I will say that the animation here is a vast improvement over Napoleons Dictionary released about a year prior.

Plot wise I would say From Russia with Love is probably one of the better Lupin movies. I found it very amusing that Lupin intended to steal the gold right down to the final brick and 500 tons is a whole lot of gold. A few bricks would make someone quite wealthy but our favorite thief never does anything half way. Lupins plan for stealing the gold is completely unfeasible but still very clever and classic Lupin. The production quality as a whole is about on par with Japanese television animations from the era. There is some female nudity and profanity so I cant say this film is safe for children but I think Lupin fans will be quite satisfied.

This is now the fifth Lupin movie released by Eastern Star in the past year including the Pi&egrave;ce De R&eacute;sistance, Castle of Cagliostro. Castle of Cagliostro definitely got the premier treatment with the most extras and a blu ray transfer. The other movies are all released on DVD with less extras at a higher price and more often than not without dubbing. Its common for lower quality movies to be released at a higher price because they appeal to a smaller niche audience. If you really enjoy Lupin but want to wait for a dubbed version and/or high def version you may well be waiting forever. In fact if fans shun the releases by Eastern Star for a better version it may simply convince studios that the United States is not a viable market for Lupin movies. The next Lupin movie unreleased in the U.S. is Alcatraz Connection from 2001 and hopefully Eastern Star plans on jumping to that one rather the next eight which have already been released in the states.",1436745600,2,2646,4.686021505376344
8712065,4,B00W3W2SWG,"From Siberia with Love is what you'd expect from a Lupin special: over the top action, comedy, a hidden treasure and plenty of mayhem. While not the strongest television special in the franchise, it's certainly worth a look for fans and once again Discotek deserves major credit for delivering this to us. This adventure takes us from New York to Texas and finally to the harsh Russian countryside of Siberia, though I'll admit it's a bit disappointing that this doesn't happen until the last 20 minutes. It would have been interesting to see Lupin and the gang spend more time there, something that seems logical given the title of this special. Overall it's fun and should be enough to please fans, though there are a couple of bizarre elements.

For one thing, we have a villain who likes to stick his finger into people (seriously, this is the creepiest thing I've ever seen and that's saying A LOT considering some of the people Lupin has dealt with). This is also the only time where I can remember seeing an f-bomb dropped in the Lupin universe, courtesy of Fujiko. I can definitely say that was quite shocking. Poor Zenigata also doesn't get much to do in this once and he's basically relegated to the sidelines. Aside from those minor gripes this is one is worth checking out for fans and hopefully Discotek will gets the rights to release The Legend of the Gold of Babylon and a few more recent specials. In the meantime, enjoy!",1436313600,,1438,4.661417322834645
