4493023,5,B004X904HS,"This collection has 14 discs covering 3 seasons.  The packaging is not great for shipping as the dvd's slide out of their pockets and rub together.  Several were scratched, but they play fine.  What's not to like about Miami Ink?  Some of the stories were eh, but I enjoy watching the interaction of the artists.  Enjoy Nunez, and seeing him on Ink Masters makes me want to rewatch all the old episodes.  Worth the price.",1378598400,,421,4.546666666666667
4493024,4,B004X904HS,"This is a review covering all six seasons. Miami Ink is a reality show on TLC that was located at a tattoo shop in Miami Beach, Florida. It premiered in 2005, and has run for six seasons. The first four seasons were interesting. I learned a lot about the process of producing an excellent tattoo. They talk about the tools and how they make the stencils. Last two seasons were really dragged out. There were only a few interesting moments here and there towards the last seasons. Season Six had the best intro by far. Few interesting people, but really I think Miami Ink died after Kat Von D left. Kat Von D brought a lot of interest to the show. Honestly, I only started watching the show for Kat Von D. She was a family person, she was funny, she cared for her clients, she treated everyone with the same respect, and she had a good relationship with her fellow tattoo artists, except Ami. It's obvious she has her own fan base. I don't blame her for leaving Miami. I'm not into the whole skanky beach scene myself. Granted, she was a bit rude to those biker people in season four. American Chopper? Who the hell cares anyway? If she doesn't want to tattoo them, she doesn't have to. I'm sure there were tattoos Ami didn't want to do, such as script. That leads me to the people who come for tattoos. It is obvious a lot of people make up reasons to get tattoos. There doesn't need to be a reason to get one. If you want one for the hell of it, just get one. I guess the show needed things to talk about though. Other than that, there were a lot of sad stories. All kinds of people walk in to get a tattoo, some more sane than others. Some more fake than others. There were a lot of repeat offenders. Although there were very few tattoos that I would actually get, almost all were intricate and high quality. I'm not sure why Ami and Chris decided to open up a bar. I feel that is more time consuming and not as rewarding as creating art, but I'm sure they did make money from it. It's interesting what kind of homes they bought after a few working five season. I should mention the episode where they went to New Orleans. I think what they did for that man who lost his home was wonderful and that painting was beautiful.  I should have become a tattoo artist.
Artists:
Ami James - Ami James is one of those guys who wear their heart on their sleeve. He may be a little OCD. But overall Ami is funny and I see a lot of my personality in him. He's funny and real. His impersonations made me laugh.  I can see why he would have conflict with co-workers. It's hard to keep it professional when you have a temper that can go from 0-60. He does nice work. Maybe limited, but professional nevertheless. And I thought it was cool that he talked about Israeli traditions or customs. I also liked that he got a dog Bella, and later a cat. That was unexpected. He also loves kids.
 Chris Garver- It's clear that Garver is very artistic. I like his work a lot. He has a lot of knowledge, and flexibility in art and I'm sure he will never have a hard time finding work if he gets back problems again. He is very calm and laid back, which is why he works well with a lot of artists. He is professional and easy to work with.
Yoji Harada-Obviously, Yogi is there because he is friends with the rest of the group. Otherwise he doesn't belong there. I'm not sure to what the extent his artistic capabilities are now, but I don't see myself getting tattooed by him unless it is kanji. He is basically the shop's bitch, but he doesn't do a very good job of managing the shop as far as what I see from the show. Outside of the shop, Yoji has a beautiful baby girl named Sydney. That was pleasant to see. And I liked the episode where Yogi went to Japan to see his mom. He is musically talented. He knows how to play the guitar. I'm not sure why he decided to pursue tattooing over his music. Nevertheless, Yogi is a funny guy that the other tattooists like to joke around with.
Darren Brass - At first I thought Darren was going to be a goof, but he is actually one of the most professional guys in the shop. He can do a wide variety of tattoos. He really got a lot of unique ones. I liked the way he went about his divorce with Carolina. It wasn't talked about over four episodes. It was only one episode. I'm not sure what the problem was, but he seems like a nice guy and Carolina seemed annoying. What seems strange is that he had a hard time having a baby with Carolina while married with her. Yet he goes out with this ugly girl for two seconds and she's already preggers. Strange. I don't know. He and Talea don't look right. I feel that Darren didn't get enough camera time overall. They gave the child birth too much time!
Chris Nuez-Chris needs to grow up. He really isn't very professional. He shows up late to work for endless partying. There was an episode where he kissed a girl's rear end. Obviously anything with women in bikinis was put into the show for more ratings and viewers. I'm not sure how he can conduct business in a drunken state. He even screwed up on a tattoo on Season Five, episode Two. His habits may have been the result his father's suicide. I'm not sure, but at least he respects his mom. Oh, and I was amazed at how many speeding tickets he got. I have to say, despite all, he can produce some really nice tattoos.
I suggest watching Miami Ink if you are looking into getting a tattoo. I'm kind of sad the show discontinued. Overall, Miami Ink had a lot incorporated that is catered to a male audience, such as, the bikes, cars, cage fighting, skaters, racing, baseball, golf, graffiti, and ""fashion"" contests. Obviously, it's an all male cast so no surprise there. Anyway, on to watching Kat Von D's spinoff.",1319673600,3,5730,4.274401473296501

8446508,4,B004X904HS,"Basically, I like the dvd's and I am happy to have the full collection available now. However, since I live outside of the US, the Country code for the DVD is different in my country and I therefore, had to buy a specific and additional DVD Player in order to be able to watch the dvd's. It would be great if the country code of the DVD would be mentioned in the description on Amazon (also for other dvd's). If you deliver dvd's with specific country codes to other countries, you should mention this and make customers aware of this ""technical issue""",1425686400,,552,4.421568627450981
8446509,5,B004X904HS,"For anyone wondering: Yes, this box set includes all 6 seasons. The box only described the first three seasons, so was happy to discover it includes all six.
(Updated *just finished watching the **14th** dvd) Really enjoyed watching this boxed set. Took me a good month or two to work my way through them all. Some people have complained about the drama, etc. I didn't find it disconcerting... just stuff that happens over the course of time. Def enjoyed it.",1420934400,2,458,4.7375
