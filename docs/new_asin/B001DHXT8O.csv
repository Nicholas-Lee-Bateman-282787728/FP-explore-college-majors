3530449,5,B001DHXT8O,"I was definitely caught by surprise by the film ""Noelle.""  It is one of the best films I have seen in 2008, and one of the best Christmas themed movie I've ever viewed.  The story is well-written, convincingly acted, and beautifully shot.  Best of all, it makes profound points about forgiveness, community, restoration, the preciousness of life, and the grace of God.

Watching this film for me was like eating a delicious home-cooked meal after weeks of fast food.  The contrast between this truly creative story and its portrayal of interesting and complex human characters and the predictable and derivative films of the Hollywood system was bracing.  It was encouraging simply to be reminded that creative and thoughtful people of integrity can produce quality works of art.  Kudos to all the folks involved with ""Noelle.""  It was a great Christmas present to me and my wife.",1229299200,4,880,4.97945205479452

I saw this movie at a small theater when it was first released as ""Mrs. Worthington's Party"" two years ago. I have been looking for it ever since and badgering the theater to show it again.

That's what it felt like to me, watching this film unfold before me in the theater.

For a pic set in a religious world I found it refreshing that it was unafraid to poke fun of the foibles of its own, while at the same time upholding its faith and values.

It's the best of the bunch so far to come out of the recent stream of ""faith-based"" films, as it seems like the director actually knew what he was doing with the camera and a myriad other things in his story-telling choices.

Acting is great. No, really. You can tell they're doing more than spitting out memorized lines from the script. They are actually inhabiting the characters they are playing! (Yes, these guys actually took the time to find real actors who have worked on their craft.)

Music is hauntingly beautiful.

Cinematography... let's say the director didn't hire no idiot. It's great. It delivers.",1223424000,28,1008,4.634831460674158
3530457,3,B001DHXT8O,"Added Comment 12-27-2009: The Amazon product description lists the format as ""widescreen"". Further down the aspect ratio is shown as 1.33:1, which is full screen format and incorrect. The actual format is WideScreen only. The original pre-release Amazon description only gave the aspect ratio of 1.33:1 which is Full Screen format. That is why I wrote my original comments below. As I said in the original comments the movie itself is excellent. If you like arthouse and independent movies you will most likely enjoy it. I still feel it is an Excellent picture.

Original Comment: First the good news. At last this movie is coming out on dvd. The bad news is the powers that be have decided to milk fan anticipation by first releasing it in FULL SCREEN. Considering this release is a FS version it is rather expensive. At some point in the future it will no doubt be re-issued as a WIDE SCREEN version at an even more hefty price markup.

The movie itself is quite enjoyable and my star rating is only three because it is not WIDE SCREEN. If it were a WS version I would most likely give it a four or five stars. The movie itself is excellent.

So can you wait for the wide screen version or do you give in and get this FULL SCREEN version. Of course when the WS version is finally issued many will get it too and spend double the cost.

The producers of Noelle now join the infamous ranks of the producers of Matilda, Kindergarten Cop, etc. who in the finest tradition of marketing will do there very best to sell you two or three copies of the same movie. Some might consider it a form of milking the fatted cow.

So can you wait or will you give in to the darkside? If you decide to get it please do check the web for other versions. Do this and you will know the benefits of the astute shopper.

I am waiting. I may get this FULL SCREEN version in say six months when the price comes down. But my top dollar is reserved for a proper WIDE SCREEN copy of this excellent movie.",1220659200,6,1978,4.361413043478261

Am I ever glad we did.  We both enjoyed it.  I wanted to see it again but unfortunately we attended the last showing in our area.  I have been monitoring the internet to find out when it was coming out.  I can hardly wait to see it again and have recommended it to several people.  It is not ""glossy"" but very sweet and moving.

3530473,2,B001DHXT8O,"I don't agree with all the glowing reviews of this film. I found it cynical, mean and sad. The cinematography was indeed lovely and the actor looks uncannily like Robert Redford, but the drinking, cheating, faithless priests with a negative view of the church and praying did not put me in a Christmas mood.",1420848000,,307,4.703703703703703
3530474,5,B001DHXT8O,"Noelle (2007)  A Subtly Sleeping Blockbuster

First the basics:

Nolle is a 2007 drama film written, produced, and directed by David Wall who also stars as Father Jonathan Keene, a Catholic priest who comes to a small American fishing village in the Christmas season to shut down a dying parish, only to experience a personal transformation as he encounters the eccentric townspeople.
Shot on location on Cape Cod, Nolle was originally produced under the title Mrs. Worthington's Party by Volo Films (David Wall's production banner) and won two awards at the 2006 Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival for Best Director and Best American Indie 1st Runner Up. The film was picked up for commercial distribution by Gener8Xion Entertainment and was released in theaters on December 7, 2007.  Now for the important stuff...why you should DEFINITELY see this movie:

One guy--a near spitting image of Robert Redford--but younger--did it all.  Before he wrote it, screenplayed it, directed and starred in it, he (true story be told) likely--to some profoundly real extent--lived it in the same place he filmed it...Cape Cod.  There was a bar there in his younger days that probably provided the creative social milieu and experiential/philosophic core that he artistically morphs into a Catholic church, teetering on the edge of collapse for reasons I won't share because of plot spoiling.
When I say ""spitting image"", I mean uncanny. Wall is totally aware of his Redford reflecting and even combs his hair, poses and paces his speech with rote Redfordian aplomb.  But why in hell shouldn't he?  Besides the creative DNAbilities he was born with, it's not his fault to have been born with an iconic faade. It's what you do with such gifts that counts and Wall can never be faulted for resting on his freaky facial features. His story is simply enchanting. Amazingly and surprisingly offbeat (the movie as a whole) I think it's autobiographic.  Seldom do stories this good come solely out of the imagination and a desire to create box office bounty.  Let me tease your interest with a sketch of what he gives us in this really delightful, delicious cornucopia of unexpectedly moving morsels.
You'd think that the story of a Catholic Church's survival tribulations in today's world would be ...well... boring...or at least predictably clich.  Dash those thoughts. Nothing in this flick is quotidian.
A  great literary critic once said that great stories aren't as often built around extraordinary people doing ordinary things than they are about ordinary people doing extraordinary things. That sounds profound, but it's really what life's about and what gives us the motivation to continue it. Ordinary folks--you and me--every day get chances to notice and take part in extraordinary things.  Most of the time we're simply not paying sufficient attention, or...more often...we're focused (entrenched) in quotidian stuff to the point we're blinded to the beauty (physical, loving, noble suffering, just for a few) in our midst.
Before seeing this movie, my view of the Catholic (or any celibate) clerical order was stereotypically...monolithic, as are most of  my views of ""organized religions"". So, as the apparent plot was unfolding and I saw I was watching a story unfold where a weary and underwhelming local priest was having problems getting his congregation to come to church to the point he was being visited by a Catholic ""hit man"" (played by Wall) whose mission was kin to the one George Clooney played in the corporate-centered cinematic cousin ""Up In the Air"", I bet myself I'd be bailing on the movie before halftime.
But one unexpected gem after another hooked me, until the story had me sitting up with wide-eyed anticipation for the next stunningly-unexpected belly laugh...or embarrassing realization that I'd been ""tricked"" into thinking...stereotypically instead of ..intuitively.

The uniqueness of the characters in this film is exceeded, if at all, by the uniqueness of the plot's turns in their lives. Moreover, the movie, as it turns out (with little hint of it during the rising and falling action and subplottings) is a microcosmic story with macrocosmic implications and import, one layered upon the other in a conundrum of unexpected poignancy--make that power.
If you are a ""religious"" (preferably Christian) type, you will be inspired and wonderfully entertained.  If you are an agnostic (or intellectually gifted) atheist, you will be inspired and wonderfully entertained.
I can't say this (last paragraph) about any movie I've ever seen, and that's why I'm sharing this with you.  That, plus the fact, that if you rent this movie on my say-so, I'll enjoy the pleasure of having made a wonderful gift to you in sync with the season of sharing and  celebration  ahead.
Merry Christmas and

Best

3530481,5,B001DHXT8O,"I was working as a lay professional in a declining, troubled church when this movie came out.  The movie was such a source of hope that there are new beginnings for callous people and for struggling churches.  Its story of redemption will warm your heart, make you laugh, and cause you to shed a tear or two. The visual setting is the beautiful Cape Cod coast in winter. The movie captures the charm of a small town village at Christmas. ""Noelle"" is one of my favorite Christmas movies along with ""It's A Wonderful Life."" Both movies carry the hope of a life reborn.",1385424000,,566,4.485436893203883

3530484,4,B001DHXT8O,"I stumbled across this film quite by accident, and was so pleased with this quiet, calm story. In the midst of loud, tasteless, and fast-paced Christmas movies that we are assaulted with every holiday season, this film stands out as a breath of fresh air.  It's a story of redemption, the search for an authentic life, and making difficult choices. There is also the budding of a very special romance as well. The music is haunting and beautiful. The transitional scenes where there is no dialogue are so charming and carry much meaning.

There is just a tad bit of stiff acting by a couple of secondary characters, but don't let that sway you if you get the chance to see this film. It's part of my holiday collection and I watch it along with my other favorites every Christmas season. There is also a nice local, small-town feel to it (filmed on Cape Cod, MA).",1354320000,,863,4.5256410256410255
3530485,5,B001DHXT8O,"I have tried for many years to buy this movie BUT always knew it as 'Mrs Worthington's party'. My wife and I saw it at our local cinema on Cape Cod, where the movie was made.

3530486,5,B001DHXT8O,"I checked this out at the library when I first saw it. It is the story of a priest who is in need of redemption. He does his ""job"" but does not know how to love. Through the people he meets in the little village, he realizes that his life up to this point has been meaningless. Through these people he finds friendship, love, and forgiveness to become the man God wanted him to be in the first place.",1325203200,,400,4.075949367088608
3530487,4,B001DHXT8O,"I watched this for the first time at O'Shea's (very recently in fact). In recent years, it has been a tradition for O'Shea's to play it for some of their patrons. Being a fairly new patron myself, it was fun to see some of the regulars and another friend of mine in the movie!

The movie focuses on a small community, and their suffering parish. It is comical, yet it touches on themes that resonate in today's society.

Shot right here on Cape Cod (on a shoestring budget it seems), and using local talent, I think this is a fun movie that brings out the Christmas Spirit in both the viewers and the actors on screen.",1324425600,,618,4.318965517241379
3530488,1,B001DHXT8O,"I hate to break people's bubbles, but the film Noelle is not only poorly written and corny, but is downright offensive. The course of the story basically follows a priest, who has been sent to shut down a small Catholic parish, and then encounters a young woman with whom he shares some sort of ""cosmic connection"". He later discovers that she is pregnant out of wedlock, and in the end, he ""finds redemption"" for his past sins by abandoning his vows and marrying the woman, raising the child with her. The film quickly loses credibility by moving from moderately intelligent dialogue to incredibly corny scenes, such as when the priest discusses buying an oven with the Inn Keeper (presumably a metaphor for wanting a family). And the comparisons the film makes between its characters and those of the original Christmas story is not only inaccurate, but also extremely offensive. Finally, the film has a completely inaccurate portrayal of Catholicism, especially in regards to its nearly flippant treatment of the priesthood. I am not Catholic, but I know many Catholics, and I was outraged at Wall's portrayal of their faith. Save yourself two hours of time and $16 from your pocket.",1324166400,10,1186,4.935

3530500,5,B001DHXT8O,Beautiful movie! There's something about it that makes me want to watch it throughout the entire year. I love the characters and the scenery. My friend and I decided to see it one day without ever having heard anything about it. We just saw the movie poster outside the theatre and thought the man on the front looked like Robert Redford. We both absolutely loved it! The ending is fantastic and the creators demonstrate very well how in life we see the ordinary normal things but what really ties us together are spiritual things.,1277596800,,531,4.659574468085107

3530502,5,B001DHXT8O,This movie is so real with all the complexities of life.  It's always amazing to me that what we fight against the most is usually what we need.  It was easy to relate to all the characters and of course the meaning is so beautiful.,1264809600,,232,4.133333333333334
3530503,4,B001DHXT8O,"My wife and I have watched this little, unknown but remarkable film three times this Christmas season. Each time it gets better. There is some remarkably deft writing in the script (listen carefully to the banter between the pub owner, Dermott,  and Father Jonathan Keene). Some plot points are not immediately evident on first viewing (why did Father Keene, when preparing communion, suddenly realize he needed to go to Marjorie?) and the humor and appreciation of the excellent musical score grow with each viewing. An adult with a Christian background can appreciate this film on so many levels but even those whose faith may not be so evident should be able to embrace the lessons of love and forgiveness that permeate this film.

For this film to be written, directed, and acted out by the (seemingly) entire Wall family is even more remarkable. Surely it was shot on a very tight budget but one would hardly know that considering the cinematography and the musical scoring. My one complaint is the acting of some of the lessor roles which seemed pretty stiff (or was that just being Cape Coders?) and, while I loved Sean Patrick Brennan's Father Joyce, his monotone delivery of many of his lines was distracting. Hence the deduction of one star as it was almost, but not completely, perfect. (Yes, I am a harsh judge.)

We have viewed this film with adults and even teens and all are at rapt attention during the showing. We were concerned that it might be too ""talky"" for teens but instead it stimulated a robust discussion of many issues presented. (A fun activity is for each person viewing the film for the first time to indicate when they have finally ""figured out"" who the mesmerizing little girl on the DVD cover represents.) I do feel sadness that this will be seen by so few, apparently due to its limited distribution. Please don't miss the opportunity to view it yourself this holiday or anytime you wish to be charmed and reminded that we can all be forgiven from our past transgressions.",1262217600,5,2006,4.758620689655173

The depth of the story, the layers of meaning, the beauty of the cinematography...
We were all taken with it.

This isn't a quick flick... nor does is it ever become heavy-handed... but rather we found ourselves caught up in a thoughtful movie that leaves one reflecting long on the brokenness of humanity, our universal need for forgiveness, and how guilt can bankrupt a life. Really, it's themes are refreshingly fitting for Christmas: a story of redemption, of coming to terms with what it means to believe... of grace.

Strong acting by the two leads, unexpected humor, and a thought-provoking script that is an honest portrayal of the complexities of the human soul -- and we were left with a movie that etched itself deep.

We'll be mentioning this one to friends....",1260576000,,810,4.8478260869565215

Although the weird storyline keeps your interest, it is a very different kind of Christmas movie.  It is sombre and the joy that is present in most holiday flicks is absent from this film.  I can see that my opinion differs from many of the posters here, but I want to caution people who have similar values to me.  I'm not Catholic, but to me it wasn't very respectful of the priesthood & I could see how someone who was Roman Catholic could be very offended by this movie.  I just assumed that because there was romance involved that it was a story about an Anglican priest.  I'm afraid not.  A story about priests with tons of skeletons in the closet just isn't for me at all.  Don't get me wrong, there is a message there, although a loose one that is more about 2nd chances & also that someone should go into ministry for the right reasons.  However, there appear to be no consequences for the inappropriateness of certain characters' behaviour and at the end, for at least one character, it is like the story never happened. The one swear is presented without sound, but hey we can all lipread that!  The acting was very stiff and poor, and the storyline was slow and dragged.  Please give me a more lighthearted film for Christmas time!  Unfortunately this film is rather expensive and really, in my opinion, not worth the money.",1231891200,14,1473,4.601532567049809

3530525,4,B001DHXT8O,"For anyone who has been to the Cape, particularly in the off-season, this quaint movie will bring you back.  There is a lot of scenery from mid and lower cape areas.  The acting is well done and the storyline wraps up the loose ends in the end.  Catch Sean Brennan and Dave Hickey playing throughout the Cape during the summer season at O'Shea's Olde Inn on Rt 28 in West Dennis (the Olde Inn in the movie).",1230336000,6,407,4.259740259740259

3530527,5,B001DHXT8O,"This movie has really meant so much to me,I saw it at the movies last year in Dec. and I have had to wait almost a whole year to see it again! I watch it over and over again.

I had hoped it would become a Christmas classic. Sadly, it did not meet any of my expectations. The acting was poor, the storyline even worse. Instead of being uplifting, I was left with a decided bad taste in my mouth. I would not recommend anyone waste their hard earned money on this disappointing film.",1229472000,6,446,4.5875
