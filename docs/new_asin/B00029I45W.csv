8024276,3,B00029I45W,"When it debuted in 1989, nobody paid much attention to the movie because Brigitte Nielsen was almost an unknown (except that she was romantically linked to Sylvestor Stallone), and Jason Connery, who was trying to make it as an actor.  A simple story about 2 couples who have love-hate relationships, the cinematography is somewhat superb, taking audiences from Milan to Mauritius; it must have been a quite an expensive production.  And we see Miss Nielsen beautifully clothed in elegant and sexy dresses that befitted her role in the movie as Lisa.  Although a bit draggish mid-way thru the movie, one gets to be entertained, nonetheless.",1376265600,,640,5.076190476190476
