8763884,5,B01GWCHNYK,"I love this series and the characters!
Tremendous Family Friendly fun.
It is slanted towards girls of course but both series, 1 & 2 are great for all young people.
Most episodes are light hearted but some are quite serious and thoughtful.
All are very decent moral values oriented and demonstrate what responsibility is.
The most beautiful thing about this series are the lovely friendships and the way the characters come to understand how to make them work and last.
All this takes place in exquisitely natural surroundings with beautiful horses, this is a great show for equestrians as well.

This DVD release is of the highest quality possible, there is absolutely no pixelation that I can see with my 4K TV and my LG UP870 4K player. It upscales to perfection, amazingly so!
A Bluray edition isn't necessary!

It's cool to have friends, it really shows in the Saddle Club.
Watching this will keep you young!
