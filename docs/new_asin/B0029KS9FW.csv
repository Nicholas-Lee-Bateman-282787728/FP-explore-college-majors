Now and Then, Here and There is a very powerful story that that hits on many very emotional points. The story is great the visuals are just as great if not better. I defiantly recommend this peice to anyone who likes the action/'Pre-Apocalypse' genre anime.

The product came packaged as advertised, and for a very nice price. This is the entire series of Now and Then, Here and there, all 13 episodes.",1264032000,,537,4.536082474226804

3876959,5,B0029KS9FW,"Now and Then, Here and There was currently licensed by Central Park Media, which has been defunct since early  2009.

I've been wanting to purchasethe old release for a loooong time, but didn't want to buy it for more than it was worth, so waited for it to get  cheaper, then I learned that ADV Films rescued this gem...

A boy lives in a town is a very fierce kendo player, after leaving his match behind  (which didn't go too well...), he sees a quiet,  lonely girl who he takes an instant liking to. She gets ambushed by soldiers from the future who claim that she is something special...

I know. It sounds VERY generic... However, the first episode is probably the lightest and least oppressive episode out of the entire series!

After being transpoted, he learns that he is in hell. And, of course, I don't mean a fantasy hell, I mean a vicious, harsh, deceitful place where humanity are practically monsters. For whatever reason the girl traveled to the past, is explained just within the first episode...

So what does the boy do? He gets captured, and is coerced into doing what the other child soldiers do. Kill. Kidnap. Rinse and Repeat. The boy lives from a different era so he resists the orders by never giving in. NEVER.

The first half of the story focuses on how the world works, as well as show you other characters that are just as strong, and equally moving as our hero. Eventually, he is emprisoned again for defying them too long, and he uses his wits and training to break himself and the girl he promised, out of there.

This takes us to my favorite episode: #8, which shows us why the girl is the way she is, and why she'll only trust the boy. By the end of the episode, they are forever bonded by a force that can't be described as just romance. It's much more than that, and it shows throughout the rest of the series.

I'll stop at the story here, so I won't ruin the plot, and so you'll enjoy it better.

The presentation is at a 4:3 aspect ratio, which suits the slightly aged appearence of the series.
The audio is both English and Japanese stereo. The old boxset/releases claimed to have English 5.1, which is no longer here. But since I haven't seen that release I, personally can't complain.

The extra's include storyboards, which are nice, ADV trailers, and one of the best closing animation/songs ever...

Now and Then, Here and There is a short, sweet tale of war, the future, bonds, heart, and an impression that will stick with you...",1256256000,11,2474,4.491071428571429
3876960,5,B0029KS9FW,"This is the version I own so I don't really have any other versions to compare it to but....that's not the point. The point is that if you're reading this review you're an anime fan and if you haven't seen this anime then go see it, and once you see it buy whatever version of it looks nicest on your shelf.

If you like Grave of the Fireflies think of this along the same lines...really sad but really amazing. Honestly the episodes aren't too long...there's only 13 of them but this anime does more in 13 episodes than most typically do in 26 and with an amazing musical score, great voice acting and a powerful story it's perfect for your growing shelf of anime epics.

Hopefully this review helps you consider it!",1250899200,15,717,4.424242424242424

I loved it, since I don't really get down with anime that is too goofy, unless it's an admitted comedy, and I don't get down with anime that is a bit too far out, as the tropes tend to get overplayed (how many demon meets boy animes can a guy watch huh?)

It's pretty unique, even in it's genre and full of feels and I really wish there had made it two seasons long.",1361664000,,404,3.926829268292683

8357843,3,B0029KS9FW,"""Now and Then, Here and There"" is a 13 episode show.  It was my first animated series I ever purchased.  I definitely don't have any regrets about the purchase, now...and it's still a part of my DVD collection.  But it didn't live up to expectations.  I may watch again later, but in all practicality, it's kind of in my ""once is enough"" section.

FOR PARENTS AND OTHER CONCERNED FOLKS...
Overall, the show is pretty clean.  There are some coarse language scattered throughout though.  There is no fanservice or blatant provocative material.  But there is implied abuse of women by soldiers (this happens in the military colony...there's more than one colony) as part of ""the necessities of life"".  But I stress the fact that nothing is shown...and it is purely implied.  Still, the context and situation may be a tad bit much for young ones.  Also, violence is pretty realistic and sometimes vicious.  There is torture and massacres (little gore, but much blood) and vivid death scenes are also part of the show (it does take place in a war ridden land).

MOVING ON...

This anime is kind of a classic.  So I'm not putting that in question, it's just a matter of taste.  In fact, even though I don't like it much, I do see many of the reasons why it can be considered a classic.  Just in case there are fans out there for this series, I wanted to make that clear.

Anyways, ""Now and Then, Here and There"" is not a light and humor-focused anime.  It's a very dark and dramatic show that deals with many heavy themes.

PLOT...
the general concept of the plot is actually quite interesting and the set up of it really helped to introduce and discuss the many themes brought about in this film.  I had no problem with that at all.  In fact, they engaged on many unique and different themes that many shows (live or animated) would rarely deal with such as: abortion, abuse of women, war and the after affects, military, violence, peace, 3rd world culture, martial societies, etc.  I didn't always agree with many of the conclusions they made, but it was interesting and worth considering either way.

CHARACTER...
What really lost this show for me was the characters.  Not the supporting cast, though.  They were great!  I even loved the villain and semi-villain.  Plus the entire supporting cast was very believable and well-portrayed.  You could sympathize with them in many ways.  The main protagonists, however, were quite grating.  It was mainly the guy (Shu) however.  For me, 2nd to a great plot set-up/concept - a good film needs good and relatable characters as individuals, as well as a strong & believable chemistry between the inter-character interactions.  Again, the supporting cast (including main villains) did that well.  Shu on the other hand was very grating.  He serves as the ""I-want-peace-and-will-never-kill"" character archetype.  There is a difference between being a warrior of peace or justice standing up for ideals regardless of the opposition, and being a stubborn/naive fool that only sees the world through his own well-meaning-but-unsympathetic eyes.  That's a form of selfishness.  Shu does have a kind heart, to be sure, and he is often right in his convictions (though not all of them), but even though he cares, he seemed to lack a truly compassionate and understanding heart towards others....he could not step into their shoes and help them from that aspect.  This would not be a problem in the series except for the fact that the anime revolves around the decisions he makes.  That fact kind of brought the show into a somewhat irritating mess for me.

GRAPHICS...
The art is simply beautiful and amazing...it's seriously amazing how much one can do by simply drawing.  You will not be disappointed.  The world is very engaging and vibrant because of it.

ALL IN ALL...
I can't say it's a bad series.  What I can say is that it is one that needs a very specific taste and people to enjoy.  Many of the themes are interesting and well executed/discussed.  The plot concept was actually phenomenal, and the art was brilliant.  Still, for me, I ended up rooting for the supporting cast and not the main protagonists...and that was enough to kill the experience for me.",1334361600,5,4201,4.793584379358438
8357844,4,B0029KS9FW,"WARNING: It should be noted that this anime is not for children. Rape, violence, mass killings, and suicide are topics that may not be appropriate for some audiences.

As you can tell from the warning, this anime is tragic. Very tragic. Shu is normal, positive-thinking boy who finds himself transported into the very distant future after encountering a strange girl named La La Ru. Once arriving aboard Hellywood, Shu is immediately using every minute trying to survive a world where morals have been disregarded under the rule of the insane evil King Hamdo.  Shu learns that friend and foe is not a black and white concept but in order to help La La Ru and later other characters he comes across, he needs to keep his humanity and remember to stay true to himself.

Positives:
-At 13 episodes this is a fairly short anime but that means every episode is used to its fullest to convey it's story. No fillers here!
-While cute anime such as Azumanga Diaoh, and crazy anime such as FLCL are all very good.  I also like more mature stories that delve into deeper topics than the first day of high school, or if how to get a cute boy to like you. If you're interested a more mature theme, this is it!

Negatives:
-If you've seen Grave of the Fireflies you understand what animation you're in for. It's more rounded and less realistic but in a way thats a good thing because of some of the brutality that goes on. It's not a style I particularly go for but eventually, I personally got used to it and it became less of a bother.
-There is a lack of developed reason in some situations. You'll wonder why some characters got to how they are and how some events occurred in the first place. While some are answered, a lot is left unanswered. There is hardly any character backstory.

Honestly, despite it's depressing tone throughout, there is always a glimmer of hope and the story envelops you in a way that many don't. For those old enough and want a more heart-wrenching story, give this a look!",1306627200,,1993,4.522222222222222

8357846,3,B0029KS9FW,"""Now and Then, Here and There"" - a short 13-episode series is a mixture of science fiction and drama involved with war atrocities.  However, the science fiction part is just used as a marketing tool to help set the stage, the real focus of the series is actually about dealing with the inhumanity of war.

There are quite a few flaws in the series, but the biggest problem I have against is it fails to make clear its core philosophical position: is violence good or is it necessarily bad?

***CONTAINS SPOILERS***

Through the main characters, Shu who followed a mysterious girl named Lala-Ru who both got kidnapped by a military-like group into the distant future where Shu witnessed mankind is being terrorized by the atrocities of war.  The earth is surrounded by desert and controlled by an evil military group called Hellywood that led by a cruel psychotic leader named Hamdo.  The story soon takes us to experience the true terror of war such as genocide, torture, kidnapping, shortage of water, child soldiers, murders and rape.  Although there are no graphic nudity or rape scenes depicted and the violence is really not that bad to see, the implied violence is still very brutal enough to disturb those with weak stomach especially when an adult character is seen beating a child with no holding back.  The writer of the series uses the protagonist Shu and a secondary character, Sis who both believe in non-violence, to deliver a message that violence and revenge are bad because they could only generate more conflicts or death and would never truly bring peace to the world.  This is fine, however, from time and time again, the series contradicts its ideal by resorting violence to end another violence. For example, Sara had to commit a self-defense murder to free herself from captivity; Sis, who opposes against violence, but does not hesitate to pull out a rifle to protect Lala-Ru from a man who tried to sacrifice Lala-ru for his selfish means; and let's not forget about the ending where Lala-Ru would have to summon great flood to kill all bad guys in order to cease the chaos and save Shu and other people's lives.

All these contradictions really have failed the series potential from time to time.  You will get very confused by the writer's true position. As a result, the writer's ideal is come into question that whether violence is necessarily bad while he's clearly trying to promote the ideal of peace.  It seems to me that the writer was of two minds about something while creating the series.  At one point, he wants to keep audience entertained by creating all these realistic warfare conflicts, but at the same time, he tries too hard to tell us violence is not the answer, which he ultimately failed to justify and balance both of his intentions successfully.  In my opinions, the only way to save this failing is to have a  more realistic view about the topic of violence. As a person who also believes in non-violence myself, I understand the dilemma we face in some desperate situations when violence is necessary to be used if it could prevent a person from killing another person's life especially in a warfare situation.  If the character, Shu had been portrayed as less nave and more flexible, the quality of the series would've been much better. By the end of the series, Shu's character remains unchanged throughout the entire hellish adventure even though his belief has been proven wrong from time to time that killing enemies may be the only option left for saving his friends.

Additionally, there are also a few plot holes that contribute another problems for the series. For instance, once the story is over, you may end up wondering many things that haven't been answered.  One in particular: is there a point for introducing Shu's fighting style? In the opening episode, we learn that Shu fights like a mad bull who likes to rush in attacking opponent without following disciplinary strategy (everybody thought he was crazy when he fights). We were led to believe that such an introduction would end with something significant in later series, like maybe we could see how his irrational fighting style might save his friends' lives in some future episodes. However, this topic has never been explored further again. Although the topic got brought up again briefly while Shu was having a combat simulation with Nabuca in later episode, then such an issue was totally forgotten or abandoned by the creator of the series  afterward. As a result, such a scene serves absolutely no purpose for the plot overall, which is A Big waste of time.

Even though there are flaws in the series, I have to say the series is still very awesome.  There are many good qualities that truly make this series shine. First of all, the plot overall is very addictive, emotionally intense and at the same time also very believable in most of the events depicted; second, the music scores extremely high in the series. It has one of the most breathtaking and memorable soundtracks I've ever heard in my life. The music used suits the mood of the tragic events amazingly well, which I think is part of the main reasons why this series is felt so beautiful, brutal and upsetting at the same time. Third, the animation is very cute, beautifully drawn though the arts can be a bit old-school, so it may not be everyone's cup of tea, but the ""old-school"" animation suits me just fine. I love old-school anime the best; and finally the science-fiction part is also very interestingly made like the giant monster in the desert etc., which manages to provide some extra exciting value.

All in all, ""Now and Then..."" may have its flaws, but the good points generally outweigh the bad.  I found myself got hooked by this short series from start to finish because I wanted to find out what's gonna happen next to the characters. What a memorable experience I felt on the show after it's finally over!

This is absolutely not a kiddie anime. I would only highly recommend it to those who have a strong stomach for sensitive topics and not easily get offended by topics such as abortion, the exploitation of children, violence against children and women etc.

So Enjoy!",1295568000,4,6185,4.779549718574109
8357847,5,B0029KS9FW,"As many have indicated, this anime seems generic on first blush, but it's an allegorical tale that is frighteningly real. A young kid is swept away from his world into a hellish alternate reality (Hellywood). There, young children endure the unthinkable -- including slavery, being conscripted to fight in brutal wars, also being terrorized through physical and sexual violence. The sad part is, that many children and adults, in real life who live through wars and violence suffer these calamities on a daily basis. We often just look the other way.

The thing is, we as human being can do something to stop it, if we have the bravery and hope that it's possible.

This anime, although highly recommended, is NOT recommended for young children.",1290816000,,745,4.952

I never thought I would be buying it to watch again since it made me want to cry so much but here I am, proud to add it to my collection. It's a story of a honest but somewhat clumsy boy brought to another world wrecked by war and trauma. It's a short, not very well known anime, but one that definitely leaves an impact. The subject of children and war, portrayed realistically within this science fiction setting, can effect you emotionally. Don't pick this anime for laughs or an easy-going adventure - I couldn't even say that there is any comic relief. It sometimes left that pit in your stomach when the soft credits come by. I definitely believe it to be a small gem among anime.",1274745600,,767,4.333333333333333
