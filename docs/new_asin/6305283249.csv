1005442,4,6305283249,Completely forgettable. I watched this movie 4 days ago and can't remember anything about it. My buddy and I love watching bad sci fi and I do remember laughing at how bad it was though. Worth a laugh and a good way to kill some time.,1393286400,,234,4.108695652173913

1005445,3,6305283249,"This tense and terse B  movie runs for just 73 minutes and makes them all count admirably. It was made in black and white in 1957 in the UK and its story is that of a young boy -nicely played by Vincent Winter -who gets trapped in a bank vault .Attempts are made to rescue him before the air in the vault runs out and he suffoctes,each attempt being more desperate than the one before
The performances are fine especilally from Robert Beatty -the English based US actor who was popular in the UK during the 50's and early 60's .Please note that while Sean Connery does appear in the movie it is strictly a walk on role as a welder and attempts to portray  this as a Connery picture smack of sharp practice to me

Enjoy it in its own right as a modest but tense race against time movie with a claustrophobic feel and some gripping moments",1193529600,,837,4.251572327044025
1005446,2,6305283249,"OK, I read the reviews and still bought this movie...
Maryam D'abo is starting to show her age in this low budget Sci-fi Non-thriller. I had remembered seeing this movie somewhere but mainly bought it because I liked D'abo in some other flicks.
The best parts of the movie are the moments of 20th century comic relief provided by Ayre Gross (a Cyber thief sent to the wrong prison). Not much more I can say except wait to see it on [tv].
P.S. What the title of the movie has to do WITH the movie I am still trying to figure out(maybe I snoozed thru that part).
Happy viewing................",1030924800,7,590,4.422018348623853
1005447,1,6305283249,"Well, I went in to this film knowing full well it was no ""Star wars"" but this was extra cheezy. First of all there was no time travil, time warping...nothing to do with time but wasting it. This was not even a B-movie. Saddly, the acting and FX were not so great ether.(they [stunk]) It looks like they filmed it in an old wearhouse. If you like bombs, or hate your self, then this for you, if not stay away...far away. Run if you have to.",1006387200,14,439,4.116279069767442
1005448,1,6305283249,"This movie is terrible!!!  If it were possible, I would give this movie no stars at all.  It's an extremely low-budget sci-fi movie.  The thin plot is about a prison in space that gets taken over by its prisoners.  One of the prisoners who accidentally ended up in the wrong prison, and the only remaining security guard, team up in order to escape.  Everything about this movie is bad.  The acting, direction, action, plot, and everything else I can possibly think of is just plain horrible.  I taped this off of television for free, and I still felt [....]  There is no reason to see this film at all.  I truly think it is the worst movie that was ever made.",996969600,10,660,4.3884297520661155
1005449,3,6305283249,"First let me say that I wish they'd allow us to rate half-star intervals here; I'd have given this another half-star, mostly due to the great lines given to Arye Gross. I never heard of the guy before, but he's hilarious  here in the role of unlikely hero (that also doesn't want to be hero).  Reminds me just a little of the Ash character in ""Army of  Darkness"" or the Jack Burton character in ""Big Trouble in Little  China"". It's Arye Gross' performance that raises this film above  mediocrity. Without his character, the movie would be a plain-jane sci-fi  movie with nothing special about it....  ....Except Maryam D'Abo, whose  sexiness could almost carry the whole thing by itself. Mind you, the  character she plays isn't a particularly sexy character, but her subtle  beauty shows through anyway, and between her and Gross, there is always  something worth watching going on.  The supporting cast, Jeff Speakman,  etc., perform quite well also, and the bad guys are convincingly  evil-looking.  The production standards are strictly B-movie however.  Special effects are okay but not great, and the settings are sort of  cliched. There are several close-up shots of an asteroid that is pretty  obviously a miniature, but it adds a little charm to it that way--kind of  like watching an old sci-fi movie from the 50's. But understand that I  don't think this movie is trying to be anything but a B-movie.  All in  all a standard sci-fi movie with great humor sprinkled throughout. I  laughed out loud many times while watching it. It's worth spending money  on, but just don't expect Oscar-winning stuff here. And now I have to go  see what other movies Arye Gross has been in.

1005525,4,6305283249,"This film is an action comedy. There are plenty of funny jokes mixed with a little action. I have no idea why Speakman made this film. He has one fight scene in the whole movie. Do not expect to see Speakman beating up people. This is kind of like Die Hard in space with Speakman as the villain. The movie suffers from short uninspired fight scenes and the under use of Speakman. Some of the FX are bad. The poster for the movie looks terrible. They should make a new poster. On the positive side the plot was interesting, the jokes were funny, the heroes were likable, the villains were creepy and most of the actors seemed as though they were enjoying themselves.

1005528,3,6305283249,It is a good nineties type movie. Made to be entertaining not artsy. Characters are likable and the story is interesting. Never meant to win Oscars with this one just for you to enjoy. and I did. People that gave it less then three stars have not seen the crap they put out lately or if they have then that's even worse.

1005592,3,6305283249,"Like the Lahren review, I say that Arye Gross made the movie.  The sifi story was pretty good.  This isn't billed as a comedy; but I did get a lot of laughs with Arye Gross' activities.  I didn't know what to make of the end.  As far as I could see, the acting was OK.  I don't know if it was intended or not; but this movie makes a great sifi farce.  Lots of violence.  Lots of killing.  It would have to be classified as a tragedy by definition; but it is also a comedy.  The jacket picture tells more about what to expect than I thought before I saw the film.  The dialog was pretty simple,  The characters were pretty simple and single dimensional.  The special effects were not great but OK.  The plot kept me interested.  It was fun watching things happen.  The end title music was not bad.  I do not agree with the really low ratings.  I have seen MUCH worse movies.  The line delivery was smooth and conversational.  I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.  I wouldn't mind seeing it again.",1435276800,,1000,4.218085106382978

It's a good movie for its time, genre, and budget, and they do have a couple of decent actors in there, including the guy who plays Riley. If you've got popcorn and are in the mood for some mindless 90's sci-fi escapism, then by all means give it a shot. One of the other reviewers was right- the cover art is a little misleading (there is no time travel at all in this movie), but other than that, not bad at all.",1412985600,,518,4.138613861386139

1005707,1,6305283249,"First, a pet peeve of mine. The cover art has nothing whatsoever to do with the movie. The proposed chemistry between the lead characters is implausible. The set is severely limited and there are items that were used for booth main settings, a spaceship and a space prison. Hard to keep up with where you are. One of the bad guys was funny (in a sarcastic way). I was sucked in and sat through the whole thing hoping for redemption, but I had to take the talk of shame after this one.

I cannot decide which was worse - the good guys or the bad guys, so I settled on all of them. Preposterous, ridiculous attempts of humor thrown in didn't work either. The remarks were cheesy, sleazy and crappy. Director Robert Munic must have paid to make this film because I don't believe he has any credible credentials for someone to hire him. Maryam D'Abo as the only woman in the film and the heroine was so bad she should have stayed retired. I cannot think of one thing good to say about this film --- oh, yes, I can --- it ended.

The sets are cheap.  The computer graphics are cheap.  The limited number of locations and repetitious B-roll stock images are cheap.  The costumes are cheap.  This film has more cheap than a flock of canaries.  Cheep. Cheep.  But I can honestly say, ""I loved the dialog, the writing, and the acting.""  I never felt like ending the movie pre-maturely.
