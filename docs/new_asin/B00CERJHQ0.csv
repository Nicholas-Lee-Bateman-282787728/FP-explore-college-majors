5720858,1,B00CERJHQ0,"This video is not the correct format for US - so it seems wrong that the customer has to pay to return it (the return label is unusable because it has no country code on it )- so cost of return IF given a new return label would be more than initial price plus a lot of leg
work - to PO, back to ask Amazon for a new return label , customs form etc.,...",1376956800,,352,3.7066666666666666
5720859,4,B00CERJHQ0,"Imagine my surprise when this movie recently showed up at the local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati, basically without any advance notice or advertizing. But knowing that this movie is directed by Ken Loach was good enough for me to go see it, even though I really had no idea beforehand what the movie was about (and I purposefully stayed 'uninformed' before seeing this).

""The Angels' Share"" (2012 release from the UK; 106 min.) brings the story of Robbie (played by Paul Brannigan) and three others in Glasgow, Scotland, who are sentenced to community service instead of jail time for various crimes they've committed (Robbie had assaulted someone, we later learn). Robbie is struggling mightily as his girlfriend Leonie is about to give birth and he has no job, Leonie's family only wants him to stay away from her, and op top of all that Robbie has some long-time fiends who won't leave him alone. Harry (played by John Henshaw) is the community service supervisor and feels sorry for Robbie, giving him temporary shelter and some much needed parental-like care. Harry introduces the group also to the world of wiskey tasting, for wich Robbie seems to have a gifted and telended nose, literally. In one of the funnier scenes of the movie, as the group is sitting around tasting wiskey, one of them comments dryly: ""Peaty and a wee bit lumpy"", haha! They also learn about a rare wiskey (Malt Mill) that is about to be auctioned. To tell you more of the plot would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: this is billed as a comedy, and while there are a lot of funny bits and pieces throughout the movie, there are a number of erious undertones as well, which show up primarily in the first half of the movie, dealing with the hopelessness of younget people growing up on the wrong side of teh tracks and without much prospects for anything. This is a social theme that director Ken Loach knows well and has visited before. Seconf, the movie is spoken in the local Glasgow dialect (the movie was shown with substitles in the theatre where I saw it), and that accordingly the language is peppered with the F bomb and other choice words, so viewer beware. Third, the scenery in Scotland (besides Glasgow, it also features Edinburgh and the Highlands) is like a postcard come alive (I once spent a summer at the University of Edinburgh, still have great memories of that). The whiskey scenes are filmed on location, including at the Balblair Distillery up north. Bottom line: I went into the movie knowing next-to-nothing about the plot, and I left the theatre a satisfied customer with a smile on my face. If you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie that is slightly off-center, you cannot go wrong with this, I guarantee it.",1370131200,4,2815,4.719512195121951
5720860,5,B00CERJHQ0,"This delightful outing is a triple threat: 1) It has people to root for; 2) It is laugh-out-loud funny; and 3) It has captions (it takes place in Scotland, so they are very, very welcome)! The screening audience (some of the men wore kilts) was appreciative and I was tickled pink.

After a hair-raising scene at a train station, we start with a number of criminals being handed down sentences by a judge. We see the accused and hear of their crimes, then we follow a handful of miscreants who have been sentenced to community service. The fellow in charge takes them on an outing to Edinburgh one weekend...to...of all places, a whiskey distillery! (It's spelled ""whisky"" in Scotland.)

Our principal players are:
  * John Henshaw is Harry, the whisky-loving overseer in charge of the community service workers, would like to find something LEGAL to interest and maybe motivate his youthful charges.
  * Paul Brannigan is our young felon Robbie, a brand-new daddy who is determined to make a new start. The judge has given him one last chance but we can see the deck is stacked against him.
  * William Ruane is Rhino, willing to go along with the gang, but not the brightest bulb in the box.
  * Gary Maitland is Albert, who is, beyond a doubt, a cerebral black hole!
  * Jasmin Riggins is Mo; she steals anything that isn't nailed down, even after she swore she would go straight.
  * Roger Allam is Thaddeus, an agent for some anonymous connoisseur who savors rare whiskys.

While touring the distillery, the tour guide explains that the mysterious two percent of the liquid that quietly evaporates from the barrel each year is called ""The Angels' Share."" Having toured the Jack Daniel's distillery in Lynchburg, Tennessee, I was surprised to see how much of the process was familiar, but I still was deeply grateful for those captions!

As this is a low-budget film, the MPAA has not rated it, but I must warn you, it deals with the riff raff of Glasgow, so be prepared for a LOT of profanity, crude repartee, and a couple of brutal fistfights. Because much of the delightful humor is bawdy, it is NOT for the faint of heart. On the other hand, if you can tolerate it, you will be in for an exciting and satisfying romp!

I have pre-ordered my DVD from Amazon and I can hardly wait to watch it again.",1366761600,8,2305,4.596577017114915
5720861,4,B00CERJHQ0,"After a political thriller ""Route Irish,"" Ken Loach has come back to more familiar territories. His latest drama ""The Angels' Share"" deals with such serious social issues as unemployment among the young, but the film itself is surprisingly optimistic (with a Proclaimers song), and is often very funny, with a tone close to that of ""Looking for Eric.""

Newcomer Paul Brannigan plays Robbie living in Glasgow, young and jobless, who is going to be a father soon. Robbie knows he has to change his life, but finds it virtually impossible with the environment surrounding him.

While on community service, Robbie meets three young troubled Glaswegians, Albert (Gary Maitland), Rhino (William Ruane) and Mo (Jasmin Riggins). Harry (John Henshaw), a Manchester-born whisky lover in charge of the community service becomes a sort of father figure to them, taking them to an Edinburgh distillery, where Robbie discovers his talent for whisky tasting.

For ""The Angels' Share"" Ken Loach has created credible characters without making them overly sympathetic, and the film balances well between serious and funny scenes. Perhaps some may prefer the director's more intense dramas like ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley,"" but I for one like the film for what it is, an enjoyable comedy drama with a message.",1366675200,11,1296,5.1913875598086126

5720865,4,B00CERJHQ0,"This dark-to-light Ken Loach film didn't get much attention outside Scotland, partly because much of the dialogue is in  dialect virtually incomprehensible to non-Glaswegian ears. But the story is nevertheless easy to follow, and the film's array of misfits whose lives are transformed by one man's love for scotch whisky are impossible not to love. Malt heads will adore this film, which--from its title onward--is filled with references, locations, and experiences that will bring smiles of recognition to scotch lovers.",1435363200,,522,5.525
5720866,5,B00CERJHQ0,A delightful heart warming comedy with an engaging cast but be warned: if you have difficulty understanding Glaswegian accents you may find most of the dialogue incomprehensible.  My wife & I first saw this film in a cinema and it was apparent that almost all the verbal humour by passed almost all of the audience except for one couple who laughed uproariously.  We bought the DVD for the option of subtitles and enjoyed the film enormously.  A rewarding extra on the DVD is a short documentary on making the film including the background of members of the cast.  Highly recommended.,1425254400,2,584,4.81
5720867,5,B00CERJHQ0,"Great movie with an excellent plot and fine acting.  There are some violent scenes in the first section, but they aren't gratuitous, and they disappear after the necessary groundwork for the rest of the story has been laid.  The theater version of this film included subtitles (it's is in English, but the producers evidently decided that the Scottish accents would be unintelligible to viewers); in the DVD version, however, the subtitles can be turned off.",1420675200,,458,5.093333333333334
5720868,5,B00CERJHQ0,"This is a very entertaining movie. As an expatriate of Scotland, I am always looking for movies to remind me of the home country and its edgy sense of humor. This movie did not fail in this regard.",1420156800,,197,4.2105263157894735
5720869,3,B00CERJHQ0,"Haven't finished it yet -- so far at least, it's VERY, disagreeably violent.  Maybe that's the point.",1406764800,,101,4.9411764705882355

8581058,5,B00CERJHQ0,"One of the funniest and most accessible of all of the great, great films of Ken Loach. Most Americans will need subtitles. Absolutely brilliant, moving, HEE-larious, wonderful movie. I'd give it TEN stars if I could. Courtroom scenes at beginning are stunningly real; they very well might have been filmed with non-actors!
Did you know that if you wanted, you could spend $20K on one bottle of Scotch? Don't believe me? Look up Macallan's on the web......",1491955200,,455,4.922077922077922
8581059,1,B00CERJHQ0,Not heartwarming.  Not a comedy.  I wanted to love it and spent most of it flinching instead.,1491782400,,93,4.411764705882353
8581060,5,B00CERJHQ0,"When I had seen that the people that made ""The Wind That Shakes The Barley"" I was seriously skeptical. Not a fan of that movie. But The fact that it was a Scottish film, I took the leap and am so very glad that I did. Robbie, is a problem, he gets into all kinds of fights with his nemesis and eventually ends up doing community service. there he meets a comical group of similar criminals all doing community service. Robbie has a gift as noted by harry in charge of the group, he can tell whiskey the way wine tasters do it. Well, what follows is a very amusing tale of this bunch not quite able to get away from their backgrounds and that involves and very old and newly discovered cask of whiskey worth a ton of money. This bunch is from Glasgow and have very thick accents, I have an Anglo-Saxon background and usually don't have a problem understanding any of the Scots, Irish or English but I did need the sub-titles for this one. The scenery is gorgeous and the story and acting is terrific. Very different.",1487030400,,1015,4.319371727748691
