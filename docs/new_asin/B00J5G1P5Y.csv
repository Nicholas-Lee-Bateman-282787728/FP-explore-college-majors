6333466,2,B00J5G1P5Y,"The first three episodes on this best of disc are from season one and people awaiting any further releases more then likely already own that. Also of note is that the season two episode ""Beyond Control"", included on this set as well, is also a bonus episode on the season one set from 2008. So if you own the first season you already have 4 of the 5 episodes.

EPISODES:

1. China Rain
2. The Lock Box
3. Breakpoint
4. Beyond Control
5. Trial by Ordeal",1419033600,14,452,4.244186046511628

6333468,2,B00J5G1P5Y,"One great TV show.. And it still is.
But this best of bit... What a sad waste.
How about putting out all the seasons.. 1-4.... And you watch. This will be some knock off bit. With NO SDH are Closed Caption on it..
Season one has SDH and CC on it....

I will pass on this best of bit!
No thanks....",1397001600,10,297,3.8688524590163933

8648260,2,B00J5G1P5Y,"After watching Denzel Washington's movie, it was hard for me to like this series as much as I did ""The Equalizer"" starring Washington.  The acting in the series is disappointing and is of course ""dated"". If you able to keep from comparing the latest movie from the older series, then maybe you'll like it. I would have liked the series better if I hadn't seen Denzel first.",1431561600,,373,4.567164179104478
