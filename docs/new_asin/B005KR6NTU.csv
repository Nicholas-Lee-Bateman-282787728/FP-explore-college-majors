8477198,5,B005KR6NTU,"Twins are born with a family prophesy that the younger brother will kill the older in the Black Room of a huge estate. To prevent the tragedy, the Black Room is bricked over and sealed. Despite a few moments of weak acting and some improbable plot twists, this is a solid thriller. The action moves quickly, and the story is engaging. Cliches like rip-roaring tale and on the edge of your seat apply here. Boris Karloff in dual roles plays both brothers. Marian Marshs beauty radiates. She truly has porcelain doll features. Id recommend adding this to your collection with other early 30s thrillers/horror/mystery films such as Frankenstein and the Wolf Man. Must See viewing.",1488412800,,677,4.895652173913043

8477200,4,B005KR6NTU,"I caught the middle to end of this movie early one Sunday, I was suppose to be getting ready for church, but I was so intrigued I had to sit down and watch it even after not seeing it from the beginning.
I was desparate to see it from beginning to end but forgot the name.
Saw it on Antenna TV -I was so desperate I finally emailed them and gave them the date and time frame the movie may have aired so I could come on line to Amazon and order it -smile.  Wonderful old black and white movie.  My daughter watched it with me while home on spring break and we loved it, and got a few chuckles although it is suppose to be a horror movie.",1365206400,3,636,3.9224806201550386
