1894385,5,B00009WNWH,"Great flick. Every hunters nightmare. Very well shot, Josh does a great job acting. One piece of advice--DO NOT WATCH THIS ALONE.",1410220800,2,129,4.909090909090909
1894386,5,B00009WNWH,"I saw this movie at an earlier preview and as a deer hunter I always watch for reality, as if it is possible or not. This movie completely freaks you out and keeps you involved like you are hunting with them! It is totally insane for how real it is and I love it! I have purchases it and i can not wait to get to watch it over and over again! Best movie I have seen in a very long time!",1410220800,3,386,3.7195121951219514
1894387,5,B00009WNWH,"The Hunted is a truly amazing film!!!  It scared the heck out of me.  My pulse may never go back to normal.  The hunted is a horror film but it is a film that is not defined by its genre.  The Hunted will scare you half to death because the situations are frightening but you are truly scared because you care deeply about the characters.

This is a truly well crafted and well laid out film.  The acting is excellent, Josh Stewart owns his role, and the script is awesome.  Josh Stewart wrote, directed and starred in the film.  A true tour de force.  The Hunted  is thrill ride.  This film will not disappoint.  It really is a great film.  No way you will make it through this movie and not jump out of your chair.",1410220800,3,716,4.176470588235294
1894388,5,B00009WNWH,"Had a chance to see and early viewing of this film and it scared me 100 times more than The Blair Witch.  Up until this point that was the scariest movie I've ever seen.  If you've ever been out in the woods long enough I'm sure you've seen or heard something that you can't quite explain.  This movie takes that feeling we've all had and takes it to the next level.

It had me hooked from start to finish.  My hat goes goes off to these folks.  In fact, going to download it on my ipad and give it to my buddy next time I'm up in a tree stand, early morning. If I was smart I'd put a trail cam on him as he's watching it!  Just hope this movie becomes a franchise because it's way better than a lot of the other stuff that's in theaters.  If you're looking for a good scary movie to sit down with your wife and/or by yourself (warning keep the lights on either way) buy this movie.  You will not be disappointed.",1410134400,3,913,4.027777777777778
1894414,2,B00009WNWH,flash back to the blair witch filming style  .. all you see is the two main character filming each other..  Watch with partner he enjoyed the scare,1518998400,,147,4.407407407407407
1894415,1,B00009WNWH,"Nice build up and the first few screams being explained as a Bob Cat were ok because a dead cat was found. However, from that point forward it got ridiculous. A lot of time and wasted film doing & showing absolutely nothing....... and then it ended.  ARE YOU KIDDING?  Did the author die?  And did this movie make a claim it is based on actual events? If so, what the hell happened?",1518566400,,382,4.277777777777778
1894416,5,B00009WNWH,Excellent. Keeps you on edge with plenty of jump scares. You will never be more terrified of something that you never actually see!,1518220800,,131,4.739130434782608
1894417,1,B00009WNWH,Wish I could give it 0 Stars. Kept me and my wife in suspense for an hour and a half with no pay off... Thanks for wasting my time.,1517961600,,131,3.5517241379310347
1894418,4,B00009WNWH,"I'm a horror/supernatural fan and, frankly, the genre sucks. This one is pretty good, however. I had very low expectations and, hating found footage movies,  the bar was even lower. I thought was very well done, the acting was good and, with the exception of a few bloopers in terms of timing, it was well worth the time invested.",1516492800,,330,4.593220338983051
1894419,3,B00009WNWH,"I liked the first part but hate movies that have a bad, stupid,unbelievable ending. These characters(very well acted) have gone to the expense and time to film a bow hunt that is  a very competitive endeavor . So Why they loose their grip on commen sense, over some stuff that could be explained on more than a few things we will have to just believe * that it was all staged to be that way* thus the unbelievable is meant to be that way so as to have a twisted plot. NOW I get it! OK so all the stupid stuff they do like not staying together, is ok.nd just part of movie making. Still unbelievable. I do not like 'lost film' movies and if you don't either you will not like most of this movie either.",1516320000,,701,4.116788321167883
1894420,1,B00009WNWH,Would give negative stars if I could,1516147200,,36,4.285714285714286
1894421,1,B00009WNWH,"I thought since I've seen Josh Stewart in a lot of movies this should be a good one. I really liked the fact it was suppose to be a true event, and it happened in WV.
I found it to be too far fetched, not scary, just dumb. I love Josh Stewart as an actor, but did not like this movie, The way it ended was way off what could have happened in real life.",1515974400,,352,3.7066666666666666
1894422,4,B00009WNWH,"Not quite what I expected, but a good horror flick.",1515888000,,51,4.2
1894423,1,B00009WNWH,Terrible. I liked the actors but there was an unsatisfying ending and no answers.,1515715200,,81,4.857142857142857
1894424,1,B00009WNWH,"I agree with the guy that said skip the first hour.  Watch a couple minutes like when they realized the keys were gone and were starting across the river. Then skip the next 25 minutes.
But then, what can you expect the tree huggers made it.",1514419200,,241,4.239130434782608
1894425,4,B00009WNWH,"I liked it. It kept my imagination running wild. Made me jump a couple of times, didn't expect the screaming at certain moments. not giving 5 stars because it reminded me of the blair witch movie, but at least it is a much more believable story then 3 kids getting lost in a small wooded area.",1514160000,,293,4.25
1894426,3,B00009WNWH,This movie had such potential but they just didn't know how to deliver it. It a story of 2 guys hunting deer for the weekend and an elite cabin for hunters when they come across haunted forest area wrecking havoc on them. their equipment and cameras. There were more questions and incomplete scenes that left you hanging and the ending was no better.,1513728000,,350,4.571428571428571

1894429,2,B00009WNWH,this movie has some horrible acting in it.,1512864000,,42,4.375
1894430,1,B00009WNWH,"Good actors and acting, but no plot or ending.  I regret wasting over an hour watching it.",1512777600,,90,4.294117647058823
1894431,1,B00009WNWH,Found footage. Boring. No story. Bad ending. Lost track of how many times I dozed off during it.,1512777600,,96,4.388888888888889
1894432,1,B00009WNWH,"I would like to have given this five stars because the acting is really good and the movie is weird and spooky.  BUT, the ending is absolutely horrible.  Second, I don't like jump scares.  There's a difference between startling someone and scaring someone.  Resorting to startling because you can't write a good scare into a story is a cheap shot.  The screams were disturbing but we never saw the bad thing.  We don't know what it was.  I don't WANT to use MY imagination to find out.  If I was using my imagination, I'd be the one writing the stories and making the movies.  I want to see what others are doing.  It's a real cop out to just not have an ending to your story or a reveal and depend on the watcher's ""imagination"".",1512777600,3,730,4.340740740740741
1894433,5,B00009WNWH,"Ok, I'm just a few minutes into the movie, so I may change my review when/if I finish watching it. If one is going to depict WV bowhunters, a more convincing portrayal should be made. I live in WV. These hunters and their hosts are NOT typical WV  hunting community people. Maybe from Ohio? Or elsewhere in the Midwest?

 I did an edit but it didn't show up. Josh is from WV. And a hunter. It's a big state, different places, different people. I changed my rating from a 2 to a 5.  I liked the ending, it will insure that your bung hole is puckered when you're in the woods at night. I used go fishing at a reservoir at night. In the middle of the boonies, no lights for miles. It was a long walk out. I'd fish until 10, 11, 12am. The 30 to 45 minute walk out always freaked me out. I kept doing it, but I was always on edge. I never used a light on the walk out, that only cut my vision down to a 5 foot radius. Walk in the dark, let the darkness be your friend.",1512259200,2,963,3.923076923076923
1894434,3,B00009WNWH,"Mixed feelings about this one, it didn't scare me or make me laugh, but it kept me in anticipation that the movie is about to begin...yep, something's gonna happen...soon.... The shrieking of a woman's voice was kinda disturbing, so the imagination, similarly to the Blair Witch, made the movie scarier than it is, which is what I think the low budget accounted for - viewers imagination to fill in the lack of plot. The movie never really opened nor closed, thank goodness I was just cleaning the house while it played in the background. Only reason it didn't get two stars is because I laughed at the reviews.",1511481600,,611,4.666666666666667
1894435,1,B00009WNWH,What pitiful acting.,1510963200,,20,6.0
1894436,5,B00009WNWH,"Really unique horror movie. I don't think anything has been done like this before. A found footage hunting movie. Loved it. Great acting, great scenery, great story line...",1508976000,2,172,5.178571428571429
1894437,4,B00009WNWH,"A pretty good scary movie.  It is kind of a slow starter as the scene is being set, but once the action starts, I guarantee there are parts that will make you jump.  Worth watching for those who like to get startled.",1508889600,,216,4.119047619047619
1894438,2,B00009WNWH,"If you want to be entertained without a brain, then this is your flick!  Makes no sense to me. Why do they make movies like this with no plot other than ending up leaving the audience scratching their heads by the end of the movie wondering what happened?",1508284800,3,255,4.3125

1894440,1,B00009WNWH,Not a fan of leaving you hanging. Just a lot a screaming by some woman you never see who can overpower two men in the woods.,1508198400,,124,3.8076923076923075
1894441,3,B00009WNWH,Kinda boring - reminds me of a Blairs Witch project,1508112000,,51,4.2

1894443,5,B00009WNWH,Found myself looking for a good Halloween spooky.  Be careful what u wish for!  In no way did I expect this.  Oh ya...did I say its very scary?  First half is NOTHING like the second half.,1507680000,,188,4.138888888888889
1894444,5,B00009WNWH,edge of your seat the whole way thru - bite-ya scary too,1507680000,,56,3.75
1894445,3,B00009WNWH,"I'm a firm believer that people should make their own decisions about what they do or do not like, be it a book or a movie.  If you don't like something 15-30 minutes in, hang it up.  Why let someone else do it for you?  Ok, that being said, imo, this movie had suspense, darkness, flashes of fear, and downright fright.  That makes for a good movie on its own, sometimes.  This was a good movie.  What I don't like is for a movie to carry you along and sort of promise you an explanation for all the hoopla and then leave you hanging.  I don't know why a film maker thinks that's ever a good idea.  Might be why I've never heard of it.  I don't remember what year this was made or who the director is, but I liked the main character and the cameraman.  I don't like the ending, and never will like these kind of endings.",1507680000,2,821,4.075
1894446,2,B00009WNWH,Started out well. Skip the last hour. Wish I had done something else.,1507593600,,69,4.384615384615385
1894447,1,B00009WNWH,"This was such a waste of time. The majority of the movie is about as entertaining as a real hunting show where no one ever fires a shot...just whispering in the woods. I was interested for a while when they heard screaming and couldn't figure out what it was, but that premise went nowhere. 15 minutes before the end, they firmly establish that we'll never see the ""invisible ghost"" as the two guys just run from screaming sounds for way too long. If you're afraid of the sound of a woman screaming, I guess you might consider this a horror movie. I consider it unwatchable and truly wish I'd turned it off early instead of waiting for the disappointing ending. Also, music is added for suspense even though it's found footage. If you realize there is no suspense in your movie, just change the plot. Musical accompaniment on someone's GoPro video doesn't help. I hope this helps someone avoid wasting time or money on this. I can only surmise that the 5 star reviews are from practical jokers who think it will be funny for others to sit through this mess.",1507593600,2,1057,4.539267015706806
1894448,1,B00009WNWH,"God, this is horrible.  2 Rednecks, with a camera decide to make a movie.  It will bore you to death with supposedly scary creatures in the woods that never materialize!",1507593600,,169,4.6
1894449,2,B00009WNWH,"Ehhh. They gave just enough background to the main character at the start, even though it didn't quite make sense, but not really enough for his buddy and ""co-star"". Right at the start the wife basically says this needs to succeed as if they need money, but he doesn't seem to be much of a hunter at all, and if they need money they can just sell the $20-40k worth of camera equipment and gear they're carrying around. It's a jump scare movie, and there are a few of those, but it falls flat. The acting wasn't bad, just cheesy, they could do better in the future I'm sure.",1507507200,,573,4.26605504587156
1894450,1,B00009WNWH,about as bad as it gets right here. it was a free movie and I still feel impelled to ask amazon for a refund,1507507200,,108,3.5416666666666665
1894451,1,B00009WNWH,Just an awful film. Total waste of time. Never really got going then just ended explaining absolutely nothing. Wish I had that time back.,1507507200,,137,4.75
1894452,4,B00009WNWH,"I've seen low budget movies that are okay by the dozens, but this movie took a few cameras, a couple a.t.v.s,  and the West Virginia woods and created a movie that grasps you.

1894453,1,B00009WNWH,This movie was very disappointing. The storyline could have been much better developed by the creators. I wouldn't waste my time on this one.,1507075200,,141,4.916666666666667

1894455,2,B00009WNWH,Could had been much better with more back story of this ghost and the area than a 5 minute segment of someone telling them a story. Movie was drawn out and paced horribly.,1506988800,2,171,4.212121212121212
1894456,5,B00009WNWH,"If you have ever walked to or from your stand/blind in the dark then you will enjoy this movie;however,I do agree the ending could have been better.",1506902400,,148,4.518518518518518

1894458,4,B00009WNWH,As an archery hunter it appealed to me. It kept me interested from beginning until end. I agree with others that the end could have been better. I thought it was a good blend between adventure and the paranormal though. I gave it a four because of the ending.,1506556800,,259,4.3061224489795915
1894459,4,B00009WNWH,"I really liked this movie, i give 4 stars maybe because the end, like other reviewers said, it could develop more on the story. I am a big fan of Josh Stewart which i saw in ""The Collector"" and the sequel ""The Collection"" as the hero of those great horror series, this time he directs and performs in his own movie. By the title and previous performances i thought this would be a total slasher, bloody and gory film which is not the case. This is more like a paranormal, disturbing psychological thriller. The element of surprise and the fear of things we can't see were the key on this film. Its interesting that tells is based on true events. If you like outdoor activities like hunting and horror movies you will like this one.",1506297600,,731,4.4222222222222225

1894461,5,B00009WNWH,"This is one of my favorite horror movies, the actors are amazing and the premise is great.  It's mostly found footage but even if you hate FF give this one a quick look, the camera work is much better than your typical movie in that genre.",1505692800,,239,4.195652173913044

1894463,2,B00009WNWH,"Very unenjoyable film. There are about two scenes that get my attention and are well done, they're pretty good scares, but the rest of the film ranges from boring to frustrating.

I admit to not being a fan of found footage films, but I can still enjoy them despite the style if done well. This isn't.
Too much time is spent with simply nothing happening. I'm not talking about ""action"" or scares, but I mean in general, things going on.
Perhaps this is because the film is about hunters, and the majority of a hunt is patience, but.. in this film it never pays off.
I don't get to learn much about either protagonist outside of the first act. Their dialogue outside of it is largely just deadpan TV show talk into the camera while distractingly not looking into it.

Perhaps I'm being too hard on it, but it's got about as many interesting/engaging moments as the original Blaire Witch. If you enjoyed that film I'd recommend this one.",1498003200,2,936,4.5325443786982245

1894477,5,B00009WNWH,"Spolier alert: A must see, terror, unlike we have seen in years, good horror, creative, unique, imaginative, well done, good writing, good story, I remember one part of the film which did not make sense in that it was something the hunters did which they should not have done, for their safety, it was a common sense action.  Beautiful scenery. Of course you have to watch it at night, late, preferably on a non work or non school night. Hitchcock like, great acting, great simple affects, real talent, real good choice of actors. If you like hunting, bow hunting, nature, spooky films. TO set the mood even better, think about the times you spent in the woods just as it was getting dark and also at dark. The perfect camp fire story or camp fire movie from home. One my top 3-5 horror films of all time. I love the woods and I love horror films, especially these kind which are natural, and low on special affects. It uses the emotions and expressions of the actors, sound, shadow, leaves, branches, trees, wind, the moon, the clouds, as it canvas. This takes films to a whole new level. I know nothing about film making, but I wonder if even the makers of this film knew how good it would turn out.  I am now thinking about buying this one for keeps. Watch it with a friend or family member. The main actor, Stewart is great, he has been in other films and TV series, knowing he was in this made me want to rent it, then seeing the trailer, I had to try it out, it was very satisfyingly spooky.  A few twists and turns to keep you guessing. All hunters, all hikers, all campers must see this one for sheer spooky entertainment. Now I need to research it because they said it was based on true events.",1463184000,,1703,4.365930599369086

He wants to start his own hunting TV series called ""The Tree Hugger"" as he spends most of his time in a deer stand. He has a professional camera man friend as they head out to deer camp. They are hunting a newly opened area, one that has a huge buck nicknamed, ""Movie Star.""

There is an early clue as to what is about to happen, although the title isn't clear until later. Kudos to DVD cover guys for not revealing any plot spoilers.

Some of the film was fine, but other footage, such as watching the trailer hitch, left something to be desired. Much of the film is found footage, while some is not, and I wish they did the herky-jerky ending in the ""not"" group. What it really looks like is that Josh works at Cabela's and got a bunch of hunting gear sponsors to make them an 87 minute commercial we would pay to watch.

1894496,2,B00009WNWH,"This film has an interesting premise and does pretty well with its build up. I happen to like the actor, director and writer of this film Josh Stewart. I for some reason kind of like his ""rough around the edges"" appearance, and I enjoyed his acting in the Collector and the Collection. The acting in this film is pretty good, the story is pretty interesting. But where is falls flat is about 2/3 of the way through we are finally shown, well, not really visually shown, but the antagonist is revealed, as this shrill screaming ghost. Which quite honestly is presented in a creative way.
But after the reveal, we are left with only the continued shrieking as they try to flee through the woods at night from this invisible spectre, cool albeit, overdone since the original Blair witch. It felt as if the writer and director just didn't know where to go after the reveal, I felt like at the reveal, we are getting this ""Oh! Yep! Frickin scary right!?""... And then every time after this the director keeps going with an elbow to the viewers ribs, ""Gotcha didn't it, Scary huh!""... After about the 5th time I found myself becoming rather irritated. Really thinking, ""Alright already, is that it, its actually just annoying now!""
Over all a standard and below average found footage style horror, which could have been better than it was, I just think the writer got lazy near the end of the story, and the director, Josh Stewart, sorry to say this man it being your directorial debut, you should have caught this and fixed it.... But I hope to see your future offerings!
Overall, if you like found footage horror, and you're really bored on a Friday night, and cant find something else to watch horror wise, this will do its job and give some jumps... but other than this... not worth the time.",1426723200,10,1789,4.59375
1894497,3,B00009WNWH,"Hunted is yet ANOTHER found footage film in a genre that is already way overcrowded. Now don't get me wrong, I really dig Josh Stewart and there is a lot of good in this movie but in a time when there is a great glut of similar films its needs a little something more to stand out. Josh not only stars in the film but also wrote and directed it. The film says it is inspired by true events. What is most interesting is that it is inspired by something that happened to him personally on a hunting trip.

Josh plays Jake a man with aspirations of having his own hunting show and he along with his camera man Stevie set off to get some great footage for their pilot. The owner of the hunting lodge rents them a virtually untouched plot to hunt for 3 days and tells them about a massive buck known as Movie Star. There's a lot of nice scenery as the guys settle in to do some hunting/filming. Of course it isn't long before a few strange things start happening. Unfortunately its all pretty standard. Stuff gets moved around, odd cries in the night, some property damage/sabotage (just enough to make the guys think its other jealous hunters of course). Its all very par for the course as far as this sort of movie is concerned. What saved it for me was how much I liked the characters. Josh and Stevie were pretty likable and defined enough that you understood their motivations as the story moves along. Best of all, they aren't a couple of bumbling redneck idiots. In fact none of the hunters around the lodge are. The film is refreshingly free of oafish sterotypes.

When the film finally moves into its third act (spoilers from here on out) we learn that the creature is the insane, invisible ghost of a dead woman who lets fly with a lot of blood curdling screams. Now here is another point to note...I LOVE invisible monsters. I think that is some of the most awesomely terrifying stuff ever, or even just plain cool when done well. I even like the invisible monster sequence in the awful Supergirl movie from back in the 80s. But what makes the invisible monster gag work is see in it effect it's enviornment and that is sadly lacking here. What could have been a pretty damn scary thing turns out to just be ok. I know this was done on the cheap but man I wish I could have been on hand to help out with some fx and vfx for this film. Hoping to see more from Josh as a director as this film was only a base hit and not a home run.",1426636800,,2436,4.259179265658747

The movie lacked everything except beautiful scenery, but I have the National Geographic Channel for that, and they have better stories than this movie.  It is almost as if Stewart did not take the class on the parts of a story. This movie was just made because someone had an idea and the money to make the movie.

But, Josh Stewart (of The Collector and Dark Knight Rises) played his role remarkably well. This one's a cut above the rest, as far as low budget horror, and definitely worth a rental. There are, of course, innumerable found footage movies about folks making a reality show, and wading through them is increasingly tedious.

Like I said, horror and suspense is not my typical genre so I am not jaded into needing blood, guts, gore and other kinds of dismemberment to disturb me. An intelligent psychological thriller such as this one does the job just fine together with watching it by myself at night. I used to wish I lived near woods-not so much anymore. Of course, the acting was superb, the cinematography was great, and I thought the plot was very good, I was intrigued the entire time, which was only 90 minutes.

I might recommend not holding a hot drink in your hand while watching the woodland night scenes.

so ever since Josh said he was making his own movie I've been excited to see this movie. now here I am two months later. since been in the UK its not out here yet so I bought it the DVD off amazon and a multi region DVD player just so I could see this movie, and it didn't let me down. definitely worth the long wait. I loved it from the start. and Josh's kids are the most adorable kids ever. great job. I loved the whole showing how a movie is actually made and how it did it with every step. I loved the characters. Jake and Stevie were normal down to earth guys who in the end were truly scared. half way through when Stevie starts freaking out my heart started pounding and didn't stop till the very end. the screams had me everytime and do did the screams and music no matter how loud you have the volume as soon as you hear those screams it instantly gets louder and give off a chilling effect. and as for the ending well that's just say I hope that script josh has been working in is the unanswered questions I am asking myself right now.

Over all great movie keeps you on edge of your seat or if you're me hiding behind a cushion. watching it alone was pretty fun I cant wait to watch it with others to see there reactions.

 I think Josh did a brilliant job writing and directing it and I loved the hand held camera stuff it definitely gave it more of an effect that you were actually there with them.

It also leaves you asking yourself questions and wanting answers

I give this movie a 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 5%

There are inherent problems to the style right away, but Stewart's film bypasses a few of them by giving a great performance that actually makes it easy to sit through this film that amounts to two guys in the woods hearing spooky sounds.  Some Found Footage fans may hate that music is used in a couple scenes, but otherwise the film does a great job at creating the illusion that this is actual footage. In the end, telling the story through the characters' cameras seems less like the stale long shots of a Paranormal activity or the shaky cam of Blair Witch and feels more like the style of the cinematographer. It's a nice film to watch and also presents a pretty authentic look at hunting. Impressive low budget filmmaking.

There is no blood or gore in the movie and most of what is creepy is the atmosphere and sound. The acting is good and Josh Stewart does a great job. It is a ""hand-held"" type of movie, but it is not shaky or annoying to watch because the point of view changes throughout the movie.

This is a genre that produces lazy crap with the exact same, tired tropes movie after movie after movie.  If you actually care the plot concerns two men who are spending three days hunting bucks and filming to create a reality show pilot.  The area where they are hunting seems strangely empty of animals and they hear something that sounds like a woman's cry, which the experienced hunter half of the duo thinks is a bobcat.  Later they hear a ghost story relating to the cry and by the third day it's pretty obvious that the woods where they are hunting are haunted.  Unfortunately the ghost isn't very scary and doesn't seem particularly dangerous--they both made it through two and a half days in those woods without a scratch, after all.  If both men didn't panic and turn into complete sissies towards the end of the movie this would barely even qualify as a horror film.

1894549,4,B00009WNWH,"As other reviewers noted, this movie was well-made and surprisingly scary.  No it doesn't have the gore, violence, and language found in most horror movies nowadays, but that just added to its realism and appeal for me.  After all, these are two nice, likable guys trying to film a hunting trip.  Frankly, I was relieved to be spared the constant onslaught of the F-bomb and gratuitous violence. The ""slow"" pace (as noted by disgruntled reviewers) is meant to build suspense - much like Hitchcock would have done.  Hitchcock's movies are generally not liked by contemporary horror fans for this reason.  He was subtle and built the suspense at a slow pace - implying violence rather than having blood and body parts slinging about.  (The shower scene in Psycho is, of course, an exception.)  And boy oh boy, you are rewarded for your patience at the end of this film!

I love a good scare, and this one delivers.  Enough to make me run up the stairs at bedtime - looking behind me the entire time - and to keep me from going downstairs at 3AM for a snack.  So you can enjoy this movie AND lose weight!

Found footage films can go either way, for me, but I like the way this was framed. Discussions of how to set up their footage helped the viewers get into the viewpoint of the two hunters, as well as their well-portrayed excitement. I don't have any hunting experience, but there seemed enough information to get a sense of how things worked, which was also cool.

As for the supernatural side, the subtle lead-ups were well-placed, and the pacing felt right as the tension built.  The use of trail-cam footage to show happenings away from the hunters themselves was also clever.  Monsters with no substance prey on the imagination more than ones with form, and this screamer holds true!  Watching the director/writer/star's account of the inspiring story makes the creep factor raise the hairs on the back of the neck, as well.  Nicely done, all around.

This movie is the directorial debut for Josh Stewart (Best known for The Collector, The Collection and Criminal Minds). He also wrote, produced and started in the film. The film is a mixed of Blair Witch Project and any type of horror found footage type film but this one is so much better! The acting is much better!  The film starts out a little slower than I had expected but once the two guys (Played by Josh Stewart and Ronnie Gene Blevins) are in the woods, the storyline hooks you. Josh Stewart knows how to pace out the storyline so it doesn't get boring and the finale is worth the wait. Intense and suspenseful. The viewer can feel the tension mount in every passing frame. What really made me want to watch this movie was because number one my grandfather was a hunter and two, this story was inspired by a incident that actually happened to Josh Stewart himself. But you don't have to a hunter to enjoy this movie. Bravo to Josh Stewart for making a suspenseful film that will stay with you long after it is over.",1410393600,,1185,4.486111111111111

1894577,5,B00009WNWH,"THE HUNTED IS MERCILESS PERFECTION!

Two Hunters go into the woods
One hunts with a bow.
The other a camera

What they capture over the course of a few nights grows into a heart-stopping event sure to rattle the nerves of the even the most steadfast of scary cinema.

Halloweens candy has come early THE HUNTED is the shriek-inducing-slam-dunk of falls fear season!  A tremendous achievement of heart and horror; Josh Stewarts debut as writer/director/star is a bulls eye of craftsmanship.  Stewarts rapport with co-star Ronnie Blevins is a gift to the terror as these two able-bodied men soon find themselves stalked by a disembodied prescience all to eager to scrape them from our earthly plain.  Stewart and Blevins imbue their characters with genuine kinship, planting both feet firmly in reality, before isolating them in the dark and letting the worst fears of their imagination take hold.

This is an accomplished, briskly paced motion picture with the astute touch of a storyteller who lived his role to the molecule.  There is an authenticity to Stewarts performance that lures the audience to join a state of sheer panic when the supernatural unleashes upon him.  The hunting gear, the steady aim the flayed layers of skin on the calloused outdoorsmans trigger-finger are in plain sight to assure the viewer we are in the company of a professional.

When Stewart and Blevins realize it is they who are the prey of something outside of the wild kingdom the dedication to detail in their humanity pays off in spades.  Were hooked. Were with them.  Were praying to all Gods they make it home

This adrenalized scare-a-thon is an original beast worthy of praise also for the copious clichs it avoids: Not one woman is under-dressed and over-exploited. Not one bucket of gore is thrown. Not chock full of curse-words or floods of bombastic score No THE HUNTED is a pure, uncut terror experience for the viewer.

This film doesnt need the aforementioned production crutches nope  it kicks your ass all on its own.

THE HUNTED stands tall in the hallowed grounds of horror.
This film announces Josh Stewart as a multi-hyphenate talent to be reckoned with.
