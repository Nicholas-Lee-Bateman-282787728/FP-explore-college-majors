4192949,5,B003TY2STU,What a wonderful series. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I am so disappointed that the series was discontinued.  This series conjures up a a simpler life and makes you wish we were living in that time.  Well done to Jennifer Saunders and her cast.  Totally loved it.,1286582400,2,259,4.586956521739131
4192950,5,B003TY2STU,"After seeing series 1&2 I couldn't wait to see part three. WOW! I have just watched the first three episodes and I laughed, cried...I fell in love agan with this show. The writing is more witty than ANYTHING I have seen recently on american TV. Dawn French as Rosie had me with tears in my eyes! She is more hilarious in this third season than the other two. I am sad to think it ends here.",1284768000,14,390,4.144736842105263
4192951,5,B003TY2STU,"This has been a terrific series.  Apparently lots of people don't ""get"" it.  So many people seemed disappointed that it wasn't AbFab.  I loved Ab Fab--own the whole set, but that was then and Clatterford is a whole other, equally funny, thing.  Gentler and more woman-centered than Vicar of Dibley, but with an equally compelling cast of actors developing just-on-the-edge of-real characters.  Maybe this is what happens to Boomer women when they manage to survive the hyperactivity of the late 20th century urban life  (Patsy and Eddie) and the quest for romance and lasting bonding with the perfect man (Geraldine) and live the unique, authentic, even eccentric, lives that they can have when they have some wisdom and live in Devonshire.
Also, it's just so blasted funny to see what women get up to when they are in the ""freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose"" stage of life.
Jannifer Saunders is totally genius and her dialogue frees up all the actors, especially the fabulous Dawn French, to go mad.
If this show is ending because of lack of audience interest, that's a shame.  If it is ending because Saunders feels she's ready to move on, well we can await her next venture enthusiastically.  Ricky Gervais, another genius comedy writer/actor, always manages to know when to leave us laughing and go on to the next new-new thing too.
To quote Pauline McLynn, ""More anon!"" We hope...",1282089600,38,1403,4.8655462184873945
4192952,4,B003TY2STU,Very enjoyable series.  Humorous and charming.  Great ensemble of very good actresses and well spun characterizations of local women in a small village setting.  Dawn French's performance as the local whack-a-doodle is too good to miss.  She is pure comedy genius.  This series is my cup of tea.,1431388800,2,295,5.0625
4192953,2,B003TY2STU,Odd characters and story lines.  It did not catch my ongoing interest.,1429401600,,70,4.833333333333333
4192954,5,B003TY2STU,we really enjoyed this,1416182400,,22,4.75
4192955,2,B003TY2STU,"Disappointed. Love Dawn French, but this was just plain boring. Did not watch entire series.",1414540800,,92,5.2
4192956,5,B003TY2STU,"Seriously smart and funny. Also known as Jam and Jerusalem. Really good acting, writing, music, landscape, etc.",1414108800,,111,5.588235294117647
4192957,5,B003TY2STU,Loved It.,1413331200,,9,4.0
4192958,5,B003TY2STU,Soooo funny!,1410480000,,12,5.5
4192959,5,B003TY2STU,I have this in my own collection and bought this as a gift.  It is the most funny situations in a small English village.  The characters are perfect for the parts and you can pop this in and laugh and laugh.  Such a feel good story.,1405728000,,232,4.0
4192960,4,B003TY2STU,I really like this series and have enjoyed the DVDs. I'm not sure why they stopped making it. The cast and story lines were great.,1396828800,,130,4.24
4192961,5,B003TY2STU,Very funny!!!! The whole series is quite good! Usual British character actors do a very good job of portraying quixotic neighbors.,1396137600,,130,5.238095238095238
4192962,5,B003TY2STU,"I live in the US and never saw this show until recently (it is called Jam & Jerusalem in the UK) it is so absolutely funny. Its my new favorite and I watch a lot of Brit TV. It features Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders, Joanna Lumley (who you won't recognize at first) and Sue Johnston. Very interesting characters, absolutely hysterical. If you liked Ab Fab you'll love this.",1390694400,,374,4.514705882352941
4192963,5,B003TY2STU,I really enjoyed this series and I wish it kept going. I love the cast! Had never heard of it and was very glad I gave it a chance,1388707200,,130,3.5172413793103448
4192964,5,B003TY2STU,"Season Three gives Sal Vine a love interest, and we experience the relationship's ups and downs. Some of the old characters are missing from this season, but we are able to follow the remaining ladies that much closer. My only complaint is that there is no Season Four!",1388620800,,269,4.625
4192965,5,B003TY2STU,"This comedy about  club women in an  English village made my husband laugh.  That is not an easy feat. That is why it rated five stars. I enjoyed the ""girls"" and their all too human predicaments.  The story lines were unusual and the acting just perfect. I'm sorry there weren't more seasons",1386892800,,291,4.538461538461538
4192966,5,B003TY2STU,"Why can't they make more truly interesting and funny television these days.  I've heard it said that ""the public didn't understand Clatterford.""  Don't blame the public for your own laziness.  This show is funny, quirky, touching, I'd even say it was wise.  I loved it and want more!",1384905600,,283,4.833333333333333
4192967,5,B003TY2STU,"This series makes me laugh, my cheeks hurt from smiling so much. Wish they kept the series going! Bring back Clatterford!",1381190400,,121,4.809523809523809
4192968,5,B003TY2STU,Great series! Wish there were more seasons.  Saunders has such great writing talent. Always love to see French and Saunders together.  The cast really does an amazing job together.,1373068800,,180,5.172413793103448
4192969,5,B003TY2STU,You will come to love each and every quirky resident of Clatterford.  Once again the subtle comic genious of Jennifer Saunders shines in this lovely tale of a village and its inhabitants.  Highly recommend and good transaction with seller.,1371168000,,239,5.102564102564102
4192970,5,B003TY2STU,"Anything penned by Jennifer Saunders is fantastic.  This series is a bit offbeat, even for her.  It is a very engaging group of actors and they play their parts to the hilt.  A very, very good series.",1369008000,,200,4.351351351351352
4192971,5,B003TY2STU,These women were funny.  I would recommend  this to anyone.  British humor has more to offer than what we seen to have on our own televison series.  I hated to see this end.,1362787200,,173,4.151515151515151
4192972,5,B003TY2STU,Clatterford or (Jam and Jersusalem) is one of my favorite British television comedies of all time. The show is absolutely amazing and I laughed soooo much. I was so sad once it came to an end and I had seen all the episodes. You really grow attached to all of the characters. This show is a must have for any fan of British Comedy,1362268800,,330,4.171875
4192973,5,B003TY2STU,This show is wonderfully done. I love that Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French are in this together. It has a stellar cast! Love it!,1361750400,,130,4.458333333333333
4192974,5,B003TY2STU,This completed the entire set of Clatterford for my personal collection.  British humor is far and above my favored viewing.,1359936000,,124,5.2
4192975,5,B003TY2STU,This is one of my favorite English shows.  I've watched the 3 seasons over and over again.  I am wishing they would do another season.,1356048000,,134,4.32
4192976,4,B003TY2STU,"I recently bought all three Clatterford series, having never even seen a single episode. Because Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders were directly involved, I was confident the series would be hilarious. While it was definitely NOT hilarious - and a bit more like Ab Fab rather than the Vicar of Dibley humor-wise - the more I watched it the more it grew on me. By Season 2, I craved spending time with Sal, Tash, Spike, Tip, Rosie (CharlesDance! CharlesDance!CharlesDance!)and all the ladies of the Guild. After Season 3, I was feeling slight withdrawals and a sense of disappointment that there were no more episodes to come. This is a sweet, charming series whose characters are warm, caring and, of course, quirky. The subtle humor comes through after multiple viewings, but watching this series again and again should be no problem as you, too, will feel like a beloved member of the Clatterford Ladies Guild as well as the village. Big hugs to all of them. If I could, I'd buy them all a drink down at the pub.",1342310400,8,1014,4.702247191011236
4192977,5,B003TY2STU,"Final year for the TV series written wonderfully and in a touchingly, heartfelt way by Jennifer Saunders.  Excellent.  Sorry they did not go further in the series.",1333497600,,163,5.0
4192978,1,B003TY2STU,"Not so funny
Brit humour should be better than this.
It pales to older British humour.
Bring back Sid James!",1328572800,,108,4.45
4192979,5,B003TY2STU,With each season this village of warm and amusing characters develope and their lives become more interesting and hysterically funny. Third season is the best yet. Sad to see it end.,1324857600,,182,4.903225806451613
4192980,5,B003TY2STU,"A great third season to a wonderful,and quirky British comedy.  Characters resolve issues from the previous seasons -new characters and love interests appear.  Dawn French's role or Rosie is much expanded and appreciated.
Would make a good series finale but I hope not.  I hope the series keeps going.",1323216000,,301,5.1020408163265305
4192981,5,B003TY2STU,"This was the end DVD of one of the best series I have seen in a long time.  British humor at its' best!  After watching the Clatterford series, I wanted to pack up my things and move to England to find a group of women (and gents) just like these characters.

This is a very warm and FUNNY and quirky series about the interaction of many different personalites and how the characters make the differences work between them.  You wish you could be one of the group when watching the show!!!!

Never wanted the series to end as so many other viewers have voiced.  But, very glad to have the 3 DVD's to watch over and over.

Here's to Clatterford!!!!!  Cheers!!!!!",1318896000,,661,4.404958677685951
4192982,5,B003TY2STU,"A great slice of village life.  Funny, poignant, silly, endearing.  Jennifer Saunders is a brilliant writer.  Fabulous cast!",1300838400,,124,5.777777777777778
4192983,5,B003TY2STU,"This is the third and final series of the ""Clatterford"" collection. It is a wonderfully quirky Briish comedy! It has so many of my favorite actresses and is a pure shame that BBC has cancelled this series! Buy it, watch it and you'll love it!",1299456000,,242,4.4
4192984,5,B003TY2STU,"A third season of the wonderful Clatterford series - very highly recommended for gentle humour, a wonderful depiction of life in a village in Devon. There are lots of asides and visual details that make these episodes worth seeing more than once. Sue Johnston as Sal is a first-class performance. I also really enjoyed Salima Saxton's perfomance as a Muslim nun who is afraid of the sight of disease, and has a complete change of personality when she coaches a netball team. But all the performances are great!",1297641600,,510,4.806818181818182
4192985,5,B003TY2STU,"I just adore this series.  If you're a fan of Jennifer Saunders and/or Dawn French, don't expect AbFab or French & Saunders.  This is a sweet, charming, well-written, well-cast and well-acted ensemble series.  I fell in love with all of the characters and the town of Clatterford.  It makes me wish I could live there.",1292544000,,318,4.7272727272727275

4192987,5,B003TY2STU,"This series has an outstanding cast of actors.. Totally enjoyed all three seasons.  Looking forward to the next season.  I hope it is coming soon.,",1289865600,2,147,4.84
4192988,5,B003TY2STU,"This is a review of the third (and sadly the last) season of a very quirky and hilarious British comedy called Clatterford in the US and Jam and Jerusalem in the UK. I highly recommend this season's episodes - the first two seasons are maybe even better than the third, so don't miss those either.

Clatterford is about a group of people who live in a small town (I guess they would say village) in the UK called Clatterford. These people are for the most part fairly ""eccentric"" and all of them are fun to watch.

One main focus of this season concerns Sal's trying to cut the apron strings with her adult daughter who returned home with a child and who recently married. The daughter, husband and child are living in an old library bookmobile that they have converted. Only problem, they have it parked in Sal's driveway. It takes a lot of effort to move them - and then they don't get all that far.

Sal, who lost her husband at the start of the first season, may have found a love interest. He is a very tall Scotsman working on converting a barn behind Sal's house. They do not get along at first, but that starts to change. Charles Dance is involved here - thanks to Rosie.

Rosie is played by Dawn French - and she is great in this part. Poor Rosie has a split personality, but she is relatively harmless. She does get into some ""interesting"" situations and wears some very odd clothes.

The vicar finds a love interest among the regular characters - believe it or not.

There is lots more going on that is truly funny and entertaining as well. I think the interview when Sal joins the gym is priceless.

Watch the first two seasons then take a look at this one. You won't be sorry. Too bad this is the last season.",1289001600,6,1722,4.345794392523365
4192989,5,B003TY2STU,"The third season of Clatterford is a triumph. The actors move around much more freely and whimsically in their characters. We see peripheral characters explored with compassion, as well as interactions between characters heretofore unobserved. Most notably for French & Saunders fans, an episode (finally) featuring Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French interacting alone...funny, but touching as well. I wish this series would keep going, but scuttlebutt sez it's come to an end. Good things apparently must come to untimely ends in the world of telly...vision.",1287100800,5,558,5.576470588235294
4192990,5,B003TY2STU,I recently became aware of clatterford and fell in love with the quirky characters and village life immediately. Dawn French is amazing in this as Rosie the local schizophrenic. Jennifer saunders adds an uptight posh who always says the wrong things in innuendo form and yet has no clue. all i can say is this trio of videoes is a must buy. relaxing good fun for all. only negative thing is that BBC has cancelled the show even though it had high ratings due to some issues with ms. saunders.,1286668800,3,492,4.477777777777778
4192991,5,B003TY2STU,"If you were enchanted by the first series, you will enjoy this continuing saga of the widow Sue.  This series has a real chance for romance in her future!  Great product and great service.",1286668800,2,188,4.5
