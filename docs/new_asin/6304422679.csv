869778,4,6304422679,"Although slow and somber, ""The Funeral"" is also an unsettling, intense, captivating and impressive movie. The story focuses the relationship between three brothers from the mob, and their reaction to the death of one of their own.
This isn`t a typical picture about the mafia, one that focuses multiple chase sequences, gun shootings and random betrayals. Instead, director Abel Ferrara prefers to showcase the dramas and flaws of the characters, presenting a powerful cinematic experience about guilt, family, loyalty, union and choices.
It`s not an easy movie to get into, but it`s surely an original and worthwile one. It`s also way too depressing, still very well crafted, managing to be moving, poignant and emotionally heavy without getting melodramatic or over-sentimentalized.
Ferrara creates a gritty, realistic and claustrophobic atmosphere, making for an addictive and memmorable movie. The cast is first rate, including Christopher Walken, Chris Penn and Vincent Gallo (creepy as always) among others.
Don`t be afraid to enter this funeral.",1077235200,5,1052,5.58125
869779,1,6304422679,"""Christopher Walken and Chris Penn play 1930's hoodlums whose violent crimes cause them a degree of spiritual anguish rare among movie gangsters."" Love it - 'Rare'. Nitch and Kinkyguard discussions over bootleg liquor deals were de rigueur in 30's gang culture, son, get it right. I bet even Al Capone went into half hour monologues on the nature of the divided self while chewing cigar butts. If only he had concentrated more on his tax papers than butt-end existentialism, but that's gangsterism for you. It's only the day job while you're a full time bar room philosopher.
Ferrara stalwart Walken has the most amazing hair in Hollywood. He looks like he steps every morning into that power shower depicted on 'Seinfeld'. If so, he should have empty eye sockets too. In the final scene, a puzzled look crosses Walken's face as he descends the stairs. Is he thinking ""Where's the director?"" It's a little late for that, Chris.
As for the other Chris, Mr Penn once again shows his remarkable ability to whip up a fine level of steam a-la the average boiling kettle, until he goes beetroot and then you wait for the inevitable projectile of flem from his gob. Luckily, the poor actress on the receiving end of this charming mouth candy was fortunate on this occasion to have her back to him. I'd rather not tell you why she had her back to him but in any case, it's the best position to be in when Mr Penn goes into full method meltdown. Out bulge the eyes, out goes the flem. If there was an oscar for flemming, Mr Penn would be Meryl Streep. This may account for the erratic cinematography in the film. Everyone from the runner to the sound guy is sliding in it. It no doubt led to many long, soul searching questions on the meaning of existence, not to mention accident insurance. For instance, ""Why, in the name of God, life, the universe and everything, do I always work on low budget films where they can't afford a man with a bucket to run around after Chris Penn?"" Probably because cars run out of petrol driving round Chris Penn. What chance has a lowly PA got on foot? They should consider a few wind-cheaters at the very least. If they don't, then it's their funeral.",1014422400,4,2177,4.5561224489795915

869781,5,6304422679,"Abel Ferrara, like his star here, Christopher Walken, is not much noted for subtley. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed BAD LIEUTENANT, but it's not a particularly morally complex film, and tends to go just a wee bit over the top to make its points (which, really, is one of the reasons it's as impressive as it is -- sometimes bold strokes work, if you'll pardon an obvious pun). What's most interesting about THE FUNERAL is that it takes characters -- gangsters -- who all too often are treated in a cartoonish, romanticized fashion, and lends them considerable moral complexity. All the gangsters in this film are forced to continually confront their consciences in regard to what they've become; the characters played by Walken and Penn in particular are both extremely reflective, troubled men, and capable, in different ways, of being quite articulate about the moral ground they find themselves on. There IS something uneven and choppy about the film -- it almost feels like Ferrara was forced to cut it down from a considerably longer length to satisfy the studio, and there are things I'd've liked to see better developed -- but there is simply TOO much to recommend this film to take a star away for that. The performances are top-notch, and there's genuine thought put into a genre too often coloured with crayons. There may well be good things to say about GOODFELLAS and all that, but for their ills, this film is the remedy. Highly recommended.",989798400,12,1453,4.816

Although very dark and frigthning at times, this film gives new meaning to the ""mafia flick"" that everyone is used to.  This is not in any way a Godfather or Untouchables film, but it has it's own flavour with, I believe, one of Christopher Walken's best performances.  The cast is supurb, I'm not too sure about Benicio Del Toro's Italian, but he along with other members pull off an intensely in depth look into the ""American Family"".",982713600,4,590,4.689320388349515

It is the obvious tragedy of this film, the clear contradiction of every Italian movie cliche, that the character played by Chris Penn realizes at his own (and his brothers') peril.  Anyone who watches ""The Sopranos"" uncritically, giggling at the antics of those murderous bastards, should be forced to watch this (uneven) movie.  Finally, an Italian-American filmmaker saw the immorality inherent in the old formulae.  We are too often ready to excuse the barbarous behavior in such films as ""The Godfather"" and all of its (often uncredited) sequels.  Only a murderous society such as ours could find comedy in the internecine killings of the Mob.  Abel Ferrara alone saw it for the obscenity that it is.  And he could see no other conclusion than the one Chris Penn carries out in ""The Funeral.""",979344000,3,909,5.013333333333334
869784,1,6304422679,"I'll join those who laud Ferrara's darkly inevitable gangster film. A great cast hits just the right notes (excepting the incessantly odd Benecio  Del Toro), and Christopher Walken is a marvel of (for once) subtlety, all  bringing alive a meditative, literate script that avoids nearly every mob  cliche. Ferrara's direction wisely stays out of the way.
It's  unfortunate, though, that Pioneer and Artisan were so lazy in producing the  DVD. The transfer appears to come from a video master, and the picture and  sound are, as a result, awful for DVD. There is not a single extra on the  disc -- not even a theatrical trailer. Worst of all, the film is presented  in a pan-and-scan version, and the packaging fails to disclose it -- a  first among DVDs I've seen. There have been situations when a director  prefers the pan-and-scan version -- see Kubrick's The Shining -- but even  then, the packaging is usually very clear. This version borders on  deceptive, and at a ridiculous price to boot. I put this up there with the  pan-and-scan DVD of Peter Weir's Fearless (priced as a ""bargain""  DVD, unlike this) as one of the most infuriating and inexcusable  abdications of entertainment companies' responsibilities to people who love  film.",965779200,7,1241,4.9227053140096615

The blame surely lies with director Abel Ferrara, who has used the themes explored in this film elsewhere to much greater advantage (e.g., Harvey Keitel's 1992 ""Bad Lieutenant"", Chris Walken's 1990 ""King of New York"").

Perhaps it is the 1930s setting. Or perhaps Ferrara's films are better suited to a low budget look. Or perhaps by 2005 we've come to expect more from our gangster films.  Who knows for sure, except the film left me disappointed.

BTW - director Ferrara is a big fan of ""The Sopranos"" and often employs them in his work. In this film we have Annabella Sciorra (Tony's  girlfriend Gloria ), John Ventimiglia (Tony's boyhood friend Artie), and Joseph Gannascoli (homosexual hitman Vito).",1298678400,,916,5.006578947368421
869985,1,6304422679,"You'd think a movie directed by Abel Ferrara, and with a stellar cast including, Christopher Walken, Vincent Gallo, Chris Penn, Anabella Sciorra, Gretchen Mol, Benicio Del Toro and Isabella Rossellini, would be a can't-miss flick. Yet, ""The Funeral,"" a somber mob movie set in the Depression era 1930's, falls flat on it's face, with and ending so surreal and depressing, it almost makes watching  the movie a total waste of time.

 The movie begins with Gallo, who plays Johnny, the youngest of three mobster brothers, being carried in a coffin into the family house for viewing. The casket is opened and  viewed by the oldest brother Ray (Christopher Walken) who says, ""He died so young. Only 22 years old and look what they did to him.""

 Now enters the crazy-eyed, middle brother Chez (Chris Penn), who intermittently laughs and cries at the sight of his younger brother in the coffin, and you get the idea that maybe Chez is not playing with a full deck; or maybe without any cards at all. Then we get the flashbacks, which try to explain how young Johnny got into the coffin in the first place.

 The three Italian/American brothers are in cahoots with fellow mobster Gaspare (Benecio Del Toro), in some sort of a union busting operation. At a meeting in Chez' bar, Gaspare lays down the law that things are to be done his way, or people may get hurt. Ray and Chez, reluctantly agree to Gaspare's demands, but young Johnny laughs in Gaspare's face, making Gaspare not too happy himself. When Gaspare exits the scene, Chez screams at Johnny, ""What's wrong with you?"" Ray chimes in with, ""You know what? You're looking for trouble.""

 Johnny was looking for more trouble than his two brother's realized, and they found out quick how much trouble, when Johnny brings Gaspare's wife, obviously drunk, to the family home for a few more pops. Ray demands that Johnny leave immediately and take the girl with him, but Johnny scoffs, ""I'll leave, but only after I have sex with her.""

 One thing leads to another and we find out that Johnny is not only an adulterer, but also a  Communist, who disdains the business he and his brother are engaged in, not to mention Gaspare in particular. There is scene in a union hall where a female agitator (Edie Falco of  The Sopranos fame) incites  the Communist pro-union crowd with a fiery speech, and afterwards, we realize Johnny was lucky he wasn't killed long before he was 22 years old.

 All three brothers have long suffering wives. Ray's is played by the talented Anabella Sciorra (who co-produced the movie); Chez' by the very beautiful  Isabella Rossellini and Johnny's by a very young, blond and pretty Grethcen Mol. None of the three women do anything more than look sad and hopeless throughout the movie, and you can't blame them, considering they're  married to three base hoodlums, with no obvious redeeming values and not one iota of likeablity.

 There is one memorable scene where Ray and his crew bring Gaspare to a ""sitdown."" Ray accuses Gaspare of murdering Johnny, because Johnny was sleeping with Gaspare's wife. Gaspare, as cool as a pina colada in Miami Beach, says with a shrug, ""I'm only going to tell you this once. I did not kill your brother.""

 The rest of the movie is one surreal scene after another, where Ray somehow turns into a two-bit philosopher, then a predictable  murderer. (Oh I forgot, when Ray was a child of maybe 12 years old,  Ray's father, great man that he was, handed young Ray a gun and made him blow out the brains of some poor sucker, for reasons unknown.)

 The final scene is so unbelievable, I can't believe an accomplisher director like Ferrara didn't leave it on the cutting room floor. And if necessary, end the movie with no ending at all, right in the middle of a scene (like in the last Soprano episode).

 I'd like to give this morose movie zero stars, but the actors, especially Chris Penn, give believable, if not over-the-top performances. So in the interest of fairness, I'll give ""The Funeral"" 1 out of 5 stars.

 But don't say I didn't warn you not to waste the 98 minutes needed to sit through this very bad movie.

The detournment to detourn all mafia films, Ferrara uses a despairing 1930's backdrop of the Depression and a ""family feud""--three mob brothers (a mischevious Christopher Walken as Ray, the head of the family, the late Christopher Penn as monstrous nutcase Chez, and Vincent Gallo as Johnny, the idealistic/hopeful baby of the family who is killed (hence the title) before the movie begins.

Ferrara snuffs out all hope at the getgo: all that's left is to crawl over the funeral pyre with him and the very dysfunctional family which has received a monstrous blow.

Everyone in this film, with the exception of Johnny who is quite dead and Walken's beautiful wife Jean (played by Annabella Sciorra), is pretty much an animal.  This is particularly true of Benicio Del Toro's corporate gangster Casper: a ruthless opportunist who evens go so far as to betray his own by allying himself with business partners that cause even more dire consequences for the unemployed during the 30's.  And this the director's point--gangsters are not Don Corleone, they are not Tony Soprano, they are not even the publicized images of John Gotti as basically a good man who was just doing business: they are evil animals who, as Jean notes, simply refuse to rise above their ""harsh, illiterate upbringing"" and are unable to.

Flashbacks into the family's past reveal that all three brothers were witness and, in Ray's case, participants in the murder of a man who crossed the Don.  They are each given a bullet and Ray is told by his father that he can let the man go, but that he will most certainly return to kill them all.  Ray does so.  This sets the pattern for the entirety of this anti-mafioso Dante's Inferno: bullet leads to bullet leads to bullet.

The questions Ferrara raises about God and Roman Catholicism through the mouth of Ray are not too difficult to comprehend.  ""If I didn't do the right thing"", he says, ""it's because God didn't give me the grace to do what's right.  I'm only working with what I've been given.""  If that isn't the most absurd excuse for evil, I've never heard one.  All are convinced they are going to burn in hell and one can see why.  This is a mob masterpiece that does something no other mob film has done before: beneath the spaghetti dinners, talks about loyalty, honor, there lies only the blood of the innocent.",1294790400,7,2955,5.65158371040724

869988,3,6304422679,"The truth is I'm really not sure what to say about this film.  My guess is that it needs more story than the screenplay provided.  I find myself wondering, frankly, what the film was supposed to be about.

Yes, ok, it's about some guy who gets killed, and why did it happen, and what happens as a result, and isn't it all just so inevitable, and is it really anybody's fault, or do we put the blame on God, the Fates, the Devil, the moon, or something in the water, but the sum effect is just a little too much like reading yet another story about the liquor store that got robbed, or the nut who went postal and took 5 or 6 of his co-workers with him.  I don't know any of those people so the plain facts don't move me much.  And I guess I would have to say much the same for this film.

I would agree with other reviewers that The Funeral is NOT The Godfather or Goodfellas.  But I would not agree that it's more ""realistic.""  I think Goodfellas, for one, did a respectable job of portraying organized crime as being full of people, who, in the words of a former FBI agent, would greatly enjoy cutting off your arm and beating you to death with your own arm, just because it's their idea of a pleasant pastime.  Goodfellas also provided a lot of gallows humor and a story that evolved, plot point by plot point, from beginning to end.  It always felt like it was going somewhere.  It was, in the end, very entertaining.  The Funeral was not.  At least not for me.

And, in point of fact, there was no funeral.  Not literally, at least.  We could debate the symbolism but the fact is the corpse gets laid out in the living room at the beginning of the film, and it's still there when the credits roll.  So one might say this film was really more of a wake.

I like watching Christopher Walken work.  I like Isabella Rossellini and Annabella Sciorra, too.  I was pleased to see (too briefly) John Ventimiglia and Edie Falco, both of Sopranos' fame, and Frank John Hughes, who shone as Sgt. ""Wild Bill"" Guarnere in Band of Brothers.

Trying to combine guilt and revenge in a gangster movie is like trying to put garlic on a cannoli.  You've got two great themes, but they rarely can be combined to make something tasty.  Walken's Ray has plenty of things to feel guilty about, not least among them his failure to shape his little brother Johnny's character after the death of their father.

While the combination of brooding and vengeful thoughts works for the young Hamlet, we expect more from the supposedly mature Ray. Either he can reflect on his role in  his brother's death, or he can pursue the killer with a focused vengeance. Here, though, he does neither. The only tension in his pursuit is whether he'll get the right guy. If this tension had been the central theme of the story, it could very well have been more interesting.

Roger Ebert in an overall positive review of the movie described the ending as disappointing. That's a bit of an understatement. It's more like preposterous and lazy. It's hard to say why without giving things away though.

While thought this movie was quite poor, in a nod to the many positive reviews, many by folks I trust, I will say that you know and share the tastes of reviewers who recommend this movie, then go for it.

Director Abel Ferrara (BAD LIEUTENANTS) has crafted a tense and unflinching psychological look at three Italian brothers in the politically/crime charged 1930's who have been scarred by the violence into which they have been plummeted  from their earliest childhood. The film carefully examines the deep contradictions of religion, family,morality and fidelity that combat the souls of those who ""inherit"" the criminal world as their family legacy. Unlike so many ""Italian gangster movies"", THE FUNERAL has incredible heart and soul. These characters are ""trapped"" in a world that causes such vaccilation of emotion that no matter how they might try to change they simply cannot.

Yes..this film is full of bloody violence, sex and explosive rage, but Abel Ferrara asks us to understand WHY these brothers and their companions act the way they do. Ferrara wants us to examine these men and their women who fall for and fear them. We are also forced to examine the continued place that Roman Catholicism and it's teachings had as a foundation for life and thought of these people.

As a rule, I simply do not care for mob/violent films. I must say,though, that THE FUNERAL is completely unique. The script is intelligent in that instead of senseless and gratuitous violence, we are asked to think about the causes, motivations and devastating consequences of violence when it is passed down from generation to generation.

One special note about the acting: CHRIS PENN is downright frightening as middle brother Chez.

The ending was a positive shocker!!!",1181779200,35,1776,5.065068493150685

870099,5,6304422679,"""The Funeral"" is a mob movie. However, it's different from many other mob movies you'll see. It's got a different premise, different dialogue, same actors.

You won't find Marlon Brando or Robert DeNiro here, but I think Christopher Walken fills in nicely. The Funeral is kind of like The Godfather mixed with Eulogy. Both of those films are completely different movies (one's a Best Picture winner with Al Pacino, the other is a forgotten comedy with Ray Romano) but I like that analogy so I'll continue. The movie opens in a house where several obvious members of organized crime are gathering around a coffin that contains a guy named Johnny (Vincent Gallo, 'Buffalo 66' & 'The Brown Bunny'). Johnny has recently been killed and through flashbacks we see some events leading up to Johnny's death and his brothers

Ray (Walken) and Chez's (the late great Chris Penn) search for Johnny's killer. While there's really nothing to say about much of the plot, there's plenty to say about the performances and about the script. The script for the film is really good and it's unlike any mob movie before it. The dialogue is quite different, as is the whole mood of the film. This is the first mob movie I've seen where a character, in this case Ray, is about to kill the man responsible for Johnny's death but firsts asks him why he did it. When the guy gives Ray an answer that is quite surprising, Ray almost doesn't kill him. Ray gives the guy a chance to explain himself. Now, that's something I've never seen before. Chris Penn's character Chez is completely different, he's crazy over his brother's death and appears to be slightly unstable. Then there's Vincent Gallo. While Gallo has established himself more as the writer/director/b.j. reciever for the controversial movie ""The Brown Bunny""

and is best known for either that film of ""Buffalo 66"" his prior acting gigs have been overlooked. The only movie I saw with him acting and not writing/directing was ""Palookaville"" where he was quite good. Here, Gallo delivers one of his best performances. First of all, regular people will know who Christopher Walken and Chris Penn are before Vincent Gallo; but Gallo manages to hold his own against the two Hollywood Heavyweights. Gallo gets really into the character, says his dialogue perfectly, he has the look for it. Well, anyway, besides not just being a regular mob movie which makes it unique; it's also entertaining, has a great ending, and is completely overlooked by people. If you've liked movies like The Godfather, Goodfellas, Casino, or the TV show The Sopranos; you should be quite fond of finding something different here.

Here just like Bad lieutenant and King of New York he displays a hard crime story with religious morality thrown in for good measure,its really sad that this brilliant trilogy of films will never get the credit there due since lets face these excellent movies ( The Funeral my favorite) are the type of films mainstream society just cannot accept, why? because no one cares about originality anymore they want all flash and no substance overrated actors and actresses who could not act to save there lives, and pathetic remakes. Is that a fair assesment of all people in todays modern day society? perhaps but there is still a strong minority who demand something more from films, the basics of originality, a good plot, and actors and actresses who give a damm. Plain and simple Abel Ferrera and his films are a blessing in todays world since there is to much crap that is in todays theaters, and while there are his critics about him and his complicated films lets just say they should look closer at Abel Ferreras works of art and this brilliant crime trilogy of King of New York, Bad Liutenant, and The Funeral, should be viewed by all and if you don't understand or somehow are bored LOOK CLOSER.",1149811200,22,1440,4.62890625
870101,4,6304422679,"Really great film that focuses on the psychological underpinnings of mobsters. The whole thing surrounds the funeral of a mob boss's son and questions the various moral dimensions involved in the life of mobsters; religion, family, loyalty, and revenge to name a few. Also it provides a poignant view of women and their various roles in the mob family. Great companion to the Godfather movies and it has a terrific cast!",1144972800,4,420,4.929577464788732
870102,1,6304422679,"DON'T BE FOOLED!!! first let me say that i am a big fan of Bad Lieutenant,King of New York and Christopher Walken.who doesn't already know that Walken,Penn,Del Torro,and Gallo are already great actors? of course they are good but that does not make it a reason to see this worthless piece of trash. Ferrara directs this movie at a snail's pace and makes you not care about the characters.he tries but to no avail.i had heard such great things about this movie and after watching this i find myself wondering why.i won't go into any detail because i refuse to waste another few minutes on this disappointing film.so don't believe the hype.don't be fooled by the great cast.they're seriously wasted amongst this turd.consider yourself warned.",1132617600,,740,4.928

7870680,5,6304422679,"I have always been impressed by the dramatic intensity of Abel Ferrara's films and 'The Funeral' does not fall short of any of them. The true beauty of this film lies in its characters and their emotions and relationships. The plot takes second stage but, honestly, the incredible acting performances will make you feel that a more complicated plot would be absolutely unnecessary. All the important bases of small-time mob life are covered here - God, family, revenge, lies, anger, etc. If you can sit down and watch a movie that chooses atmosphere and character over action, then I highly recommend this movie.",1497225600,2,612,4.951456310679611
