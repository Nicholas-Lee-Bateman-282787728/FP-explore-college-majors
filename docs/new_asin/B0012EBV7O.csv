8245408,3,B0012EBV7O,"If you've picked up the first Gigantour DVD, you know what to expect with this second edition.  Much like the first, this DVD provides a great selection of A and B-list metal bands.  Opeth is the most surprising addition to the line up, offering a decidedly different texture to the Gigantour mix.  If you are a fan of any of these bands, you are guaranteed to enjoy the rest of the lineup, a group hand-picked by Mustaine himself.  Be it the newborn energy of Sanctity or the seasoned polish of Overkill, this DVD gives fans a chance to expand their horizons, and discover metal bands they may not have even had on their radar.

The biggest disappointment of this DVD is the scale.  Each band is only given one or two songs on the DVD, leaving the viewer desperate for more.  More than anything, the DVD makes you wish you could actually experience the whole concert, rather than a small snippet of its entirety.  Unlike the first Gigantour DVD, however, this one provides much more in the way of behind the scenes footage and bonus features (including Megadeth's ""Peace Sells"" sung by the entire tour lineup).  Unfortunately, the bonus features only make one wish the DVD makers had included more live footage instead.

In short, if you are a fan of any one of these bands (especially Megadeth), this DVD is a worthwhile endeavor to expand your metal vocabulary, and discover some bands you may not have even heard of.  All of the acts give great performances on this disc, but if you are looking for a satisfying concert experience, you may want to pick up a different live dvd.",1234915200,6,1581,4.610714285714286
8245409,1,B0012EBV7O,"WOW, what a disappointment. Gigantic let down. I can't help but ask how did these bands even get there. Megadeth, was the only little ray of hope at the very end(familiarity only), but not enough to make up for all the other acts. The pure lack of skill and ability combined with lound obnoxious noises, yep, there you have it. I was fool enough to pay full price. I am a metal fan, these all need to be recycled in the metal pile!",1231200000,,431,4.204819277108434
8245410,5,B0012EBV7O,"Gigantour 2 isn't as long as Gigantour 1,but the entertainment value & the quality of the acts is just as good-where else can you witness a good old-fashioned guitar smash done as only Dave Mustaine can do?The ONLY R&R Guitarist who does as well or better,is the originator himself-Pete Townshend(unfortunately,it's cost prohibitive).You also get a taste of tongue-in-cheek humour(the scene where somebody-Dave?-tells the bimbo to stop being a'video princess'and bring the hand sanitizer to the meet&greet-outrageous! Can't wait to get my hands on G3&G4-YOU MUST BUY1",1220745600,4,567,5.604651162790698
8245412,4,B0012EBV7O,"The pro's : 1 ) The band lineup rocks. Hardly any weak tracks here. The SMashup song wasn't to my liking,but that apart,the other songs slay. Arch Enemy,Opeth and LOG are the highlights. Even the mighty Megadeth look slightly jaded after such strong acts. 2 ) The sound rocks - As the other reviewer put it,its sooo much better than the 1st DVD.You feel like the Marshall stacks are all around you.

The Con's : 1 ) Why is there no Subwoofer bitstream signal. This makes this a 5.0 DVD instead of a 5.1. Though the sound quality is awesome,they could have utilised the provison to add some more bass or double bass rumble. There's no such thing as too much double bass esp when you have Daniel Erlandson and Chris Adler on the DVD.
2 )Majority of the extra's are pretty much on the lines of what was on the 1st DVD ( with a few nice exceptions )...pranks,pyro,charity baseball game etc. With so many accomplished musicians here,it would have been fun to have everybody talk about their gear,influences etc. Its also silly to see everybody praise Megadeth for the heck of it,sucking upto Dave when one of those bozo's thought SFSGSW was the debut album..haha. 3)Megadeth seriously looks tired and washed up after 3 killer bands. And Im a die hard deth fan,so Im not being unduly fussy here. Also,strangely,there seems to be a huge latency between the visuals and the audio only in the Megadeth set ? WTF ?

All in all - its a killer metal compilation which will be hard to beat. The con's listed,if fixed would have taken this DVD from good to godly,but in no ways does it make this DVD a bad deal - BUY IT !",1210291200,2,1607,4.444067796610169
