8524572,5,B0083QJW7A,I probably will not begin to understand the attraction to anime. Yet it makes my son happy and he eagerly awaits for more stories in this series.,1393286400,,145,4.407407407407407
8524573,5,B0083QJW7A,Shangri-La is an engaging and imaginative anime. Some of the characters are a bit twisted but are treated in a largely humorous way. I would recommend this series to anyone who is a fan of anime and is not offended by alternative life styles portrayed in a light way. Definitely not for children as contains a number of themes and images that could be disturbing to the younger folks.,1392163200,,384,4.579710144927536
8524574,3,B0083QJW7A,"This review should be read alongside my review of Part 1. The two parts are not stand-alone and cannot be viewed as such.

In Part 1 of Shangri-La practically all of the elements of what could have been a truly creative story are put in place:
Feisty, pink-haired heroine: check
Wise old granny: check
Wacky gender-bending entourage: check
Unorthodox weaponry: check
Superbly BBEG mega-villain: check
Morally bankrupt corporation: check
Equally morally-bankrupt economic side-plot: check
Underlings who serve the BBEG without a qualm: check
Morally-informed landscape: check

So why the low number of stars you ask?

The following review includes some unavoidable spoilers.

Kuniko is a darling of a heroine, courageous in the extreme, high-spirited, flat-chested and using a power boomerang that allows her to avoid killing. In Part 2, she now leads Metal Age, the small rebel force that seeks to force Atlas, Japan's only real remaining authority and sanctuary, to open itself to all people, not just loyal corporate slaves. Top marks for the heroine, for resisting any fan-service (other than subtle references to her underwear colour after she performs some aerial kicks) and a tiny minus for leaving her wearing an increasingly battered sailor-suit, which I think is down to one button by the final episode.

But in Part 2, a few new elements are introduced that take the story off into a skew that is unwelcome and ultimately create too crowded a canvas at the end.

There are one or two too many ""reveals"" about the people that created Atlas, that run Atlas, and that serve the factions. With another three to six episodes that would not have been a problem. But by the 2nd-last episode the faces ducking in and out of the plot to announce they are helping/still alive/seeking revenge/looking back sadly are getting comical. The last episode is a rushed mess that even Kuniko's spirit can't quite overcome.

I can't forgive the writer for placing a McGuffin at the heart of Atlas and by extension at the heart of everything he wants to say about Carbon Markets as an economic theory. The show had potential for explaining and critiquing this very contemporary issue, but instead opts for ""we found a god's body."" (I have no problem with a very similar McGuffin in Evangelion, but that show puts it pretty much front and centre.) And I'm no economist but explaining that carbon markets can be bankrupted by buying ""carbon zero"" tracts of Antarctica to offset them sounds like nonsense and jibber-jabber.

Anime series are often spoiled a little by changes of music and even art direction. No complaints about this in Part 2. The case is attractive, and if you wisely buy the limited edition Part 1 you can choose to throw it out and slide Part 2 into Part 1's case, which is made for both.",1362355200,,2795,4.906779661016949
8524575,5,B0083QJW7A,"Kuniko has launched a rebellion against Atlas. As the fight reaches it's peak, secrets about Atlas, Tokyo, and Kuniko's past are revealed. Prime Minister Ryoko's sinister plot to dominate the world is far more evil and will require the deaths of many innocent people. Kuniko, Momoko, and all their friends must give everything they have to save the world from a nuclear winter.

This series started of kind of strange, and got even stranger in good way. This series has a very interesting plot. There are lots of twists, turns, huge surprises. The characters are unforgettable. I also loved the animation style. The bright colors and detail are amazing. The voice acting and soundtrack are top notch as well. This series isn't for young viewers. There is a lot of suggestive material, strong language, and violence. There isn't any nudity though, if that bothers you. Everything about this series is awesome. I'll enjoy it for many years to come. I think that any mature anime fan will as well.",1355788800,,994,4.881656804733728
8524576,5,B0083QJW7A,"The saga contiues and the pace quickens as Kuniko Hogo assumes her role as the head of Metal Age and plans a full-scale military attack on Atlas itself. The forest has become even more deadly as spores are being fired into the outland cities at an alarming rate. During and after the assault,Kuniko begins to learn the truth of her existance and what she had held true thus far begins to unravel as people she once thought of as ""family"" and supporters may not be as they seemed to be.
Meanwhile the computer hacking prodigy of means,Karin Ishida,learns of the existance of the Digmas and their importance to Atlas although she isn't sure how they are so critical. But,while information is power,her hacking activity draws the attention of the Prime Minister,the evil socialpathic Ryoko Naruse thus causing Karin to effect a quick escape to outside Atlas,a tramatic move for an all-alone shut-in. But,she did buy the Akihabra Shopping District of Old Tokyo and,although she starts out in a bare room in a seedy hotel she asserts to herself and/or teddy bear that as she leads a charmed life she sets out to prove it. The information of the existance of the Digmas and their identities soon proves more valuable than even Karin could have imagined. Karin,however,soon begins to ""grow"" and,through being pushed and proded by reality, starts to evolve from the greedy parasite that only took the wealth created by others and into a capitalist that adds value to a product/service,entightened self-interest,as it were,and dealing with the risks therein. You shall see how risky her enterprises become but also how important to society she becomes.
  For Miiko, the sumo cum transgendered maid and confidant of the ""Moon Princess"" Lady Mekunie,life takes a breath-taking tumble,once again at the hands of the psychopathic PM all in an attempt to bring the little girl under control.
As the entire Atlas project begins to crumble the two originators reunite to try to bring their ""puppet"", the prime minister,back under control....good luck with that.
  Your hearts will quicken as you see a proper display of the much-maligned teenages ""belly up"" to help as the tragedy of Atlas begins to unfold. The typical teen's service to others and selflishness during the times of great need is not exaggerated here,having witnessed this first-hand for many years.
  These two Atlas project originators,typical of those that think they are smart-by-one-half and that they think thay have all the answers,lament the fact they thought it was in the best interest of all that MILLIONS of little children were scraficed to appease the thirst of a long-forgotten false ""god"" whose tomb was discovered during the construction of Atlas. It was for the best,don't you know.
  To say more would be to reviel too much of this masterpiece,timely presented to a world facing the same or simuliar evils of fraudulant sciences and political forces today and world-wide. A hundred years ago,Progressivism swept the world,then communism,then fascism,all collapsed at the cost of tens of millions of lives,only to resurface with different names,but still as fraudulant as always.
  There is no nudity nor fan service but,except for an episode with the teens in juvi lock-up,the majority of the time is spent with men,children,two trannies and a granny.
  Or,you can just sit back,ignore all the deep stuff and enjoy one hell of a good series.
The cost,however......",1350345600,,3433,5.088967971530249
8524577,5,B0083QJW7A,"I thought this maybe to kiddie, but this is definately not. This a review of part 1 and 2 also. The charaters are quite different from one another from cruel, to money hungry, to pure intentions, to extreme devotion. Everyone seems so different from one another and the show is just a continuous suprise once you think you know who and what it changes. This isn't in a bad way just from the extreme rough choices of the characters.

Pros
Unique story
The mindset of the characters and their extremes
You really start to feel for different players throughout

Cons
You really need to pay attention or you can miss something very important

Other
The show is a whirlwind of constant change and suprises

Overall
Id suggest getting this I was doubtful on my first episode but kept going.",1346112000,2,784,4.618705035971223
8524578,5,B0083QJW7A,"I first watched this series for free on Crunchyroll (a free or premium for pay streaming anime site). They have since removed the series due to Funimation's picking up the license. Note: this is the second half of the series and contains 12 episodes on two discs.  The box is made to go into the art box from Part One LIMITED EDITION -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shangri-La-Part-1-Limited-Edition/dp/B0083QJW8E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shangri-La: Part 1 (Limited Edition)</a>.

I had always wondered why a top class Gonzo series had not been picked up until this time. But now seeing the staggering $60 price point for 12 episodes borders on criminal. The series is a solid 5, but Funimation's decision to package a 2009 series for this price is unethical at best. I felt this would have better been the entire series for $60 instead of $60 for the first half and $50 for the second. Shame on you Funimation. Perhaps in a year or two it will appear in their S.A.V.E. series?

The series is one that is set in the near future. Mankind has been cornered into small settlements due to overwhelming growth of aggressive plants. Any attempts to use fossil fuels typically winds up with mysterious attacks from afar on the populace.

The aspect I really enjoyed about this series was their characterization. I really like that one of the important characters is actually a transvestite! The other supporting characters are also quite enjoyable. I do prefer the Japanese audio with English subtitles, especially for Karin (the blue haired computer hacker girl) and Momoko (the tranny). Mikuni adds a little awe, horror, and strange compassion into the series as well. Don't want to spoil anything.

The 'villains' at Atlas corporation are only some of the diabolical fiends of this jungle world. Every person is unwittingly contributing to the grip the totalitarian rulers are exerting on the populace. Kuniko is a brave and fearless heroine, and she is a welcome addition to the recent outbreak of strong female anime leads recently.

It seems the late 2000s and early 2010s are giving the public many great, under appreciated anime series. This is surely one of the better Gonzo produced series I have seen recently, and a great addition to any anime fan library. I only wish the price wasn't so steep. I wonder if there were 'business' issues with the licensing fees preventing a lower release price?

The animation is fluid and wonderful to look at (only the scenes with Leviathan look like a PS1 video game segment). Voice acting is top notch, though I think the Japanese edges the English dub. But it is a good English dub. Subtitles seem to be pretty consistently translated. And the music, while not to the level of Fullmetal or Gundam, is still quite good.

By the end of the series you will be scratching your head wondering why they didn't go an extra few episodes. Episodes 21-24 seem a bit rushed. The series WAS based on a Japanese novel, so perhaps the producers didn't foresee the story arcs they would need tied up in the end. And since most new anime series are only running 12 - 24 episodes nowadays (except a few big franchise series), you can't just go to the studio and ask for more money to produce an extra 2 or 3 episodes.

Still, a five star series, a creative story, and just loads of fun to watch.",1345507200,4,3369,4.886164623467601
