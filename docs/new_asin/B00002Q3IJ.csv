8697201,5,B00002Q3IJ,"Tractor fire, wagons tipping over, cows getting loose...what else can go wrong!  A lot of difficult situations sure can happen on the farm, and much ingenuity is needed to fix those situations.  Chris Fesko takes you into  center-stage of the action with crisp close-up shots.  The lively,  finger-snapping music keeps your toes tapping and your brain working to  help figure out how to fix the problems.  ""Fixin' On The Farm"" is  an excellent video to help children to understand deductive thinking and  cause-and-effect reasoning.  Chris Fesko truly makes learning exciting and  fun!",944352000,8,585,5.25
