8418950,5,B0049BOJHG,"I love, and always will love, road movies. And Historias Minimas is a really good road movie; well three really good road movies! It is three stories, of no particular consequence, of people trying to get to a town called San Julian, for their own private reasons. An old man is trying to find his lost dog. A young single mother wants to take part in a televised game show. And a man has made a birthday cake for his son.

Do they each end up getting what they want? I guess you'll have to watch the film to find that out. As I wrote, these stories in themselves are of no particular consequence, perhaps they are just little stories about ordinary people, no more and no less. But in these stories are worlds of wisdom and acres of joy; if a journey is a metaphor for life, then each story is important to these three people; important only to themselves, but still at the end of the day important nonetheless. Forgive my waffling; I'm trying to find deeper meanings in simple stories and maybe there aren't any!

Philosophical points aside, I really enjoyed this film a whole lot, partially because as I said I absolutely love road movies of all kinds and love simple tales crafted well, even if the tales seem not so out of the ordinary. Also, the landscape of Patagonia, where these stories are set, is stunning and epic and vast, so what we are unused to in our little European countries. In such vast and unconquered landscapes the mind can wander and dream and literally go where it may.

Well, I loved this movie and will look for more like it.",1370304000,2,1553,4.423076923076923
