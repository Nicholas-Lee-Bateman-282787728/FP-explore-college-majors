2605224,3,B000GDH9NM,"I feel as though I sat in on this film with a past that led me to have a different set of priorities than the film itself. The story is an oldie, but one that never gets old. Harlan (Edward Norton) falls in love with Tobe (Evan Rachel Wood). Harlan, being a bit older and a bit odder than Tobe manages to severely tick off her dad Wade. A huge chest pounding contest occurs, and this being a melodrama, tragedy ensues. The film wants to be a cautionary tale on why it's a good idea to chase the boyfriend away; I prefer to view it as why you shouldn't chase the boyfriend away.

Yes, Harlan does eventually degenerate into a life of pain and violence. But it is only after he treats Tobe and her family with an absurd amount of respect. And is after Wade, fighting the natural progression that says that boyfriend replaces the father, pulls a gun on Harlan and tells him to stay away from his family. Sometimes when a society views a person as something it only leads said person to become more like societies view of them. A self fulfilling prophecy, if you will. Six years ago I started dating a girl and her parents used every Gestapo tactic in the book to chase me away, but it didn't work. Rather it led to them being eliminated from the girl's life. In this film we learn that that same principle can be applied to a gun. The only crime Harlan had committed up until the gun pulling was admitting to Wade that he was a rancher. I think it's time dads stopped chasing away boyfriends simply because they don't hold jobs that the dad's themselves wished they had.

While the plot is fairly by the book, it does have a few tricks up its sleeve. Unfortunately, it never reaches the dramatic heights or intellectual depths that it is capable of. But I'll happily accept what I am given here. The fact that the climax manages to wander onto an Old West movie set is less forgivable. I did, however, enjoy the acting. Edward Norton may not be believable as the misplaced cowboy, but I sure had fun watching as he gave it his all. Evan Rachel Wood is an actor who I will show up for every time, no matter what she is in. I'm not so deluded to think that it has nothing to do with her looks, nor so cynical to think that they are the only reason. Her films and performances speak to me because she reminds me of every girl I knew growing up. So, while this is not her best performance (um... ""Thirteen"" . . . hello) it is still solid. She does go all out, but not as far out as Anne Hathaway went in ""Havoc."" In the end this film isn't really about old world vs. new world, but rather boyfriend vs. father. It is far easier for fathers to follow their instincts and chase their replacements away, but this film shows just how bloody that path can become. ***1/2",1156723200,7,2758,4.27151051625239
2605225,3,B000GDH9NM,"Edward Norton is a wonderful actor brimming over with charm and intelligence and though his portrayal of a pseudo-cowboy, Harlan is one of his best creations, ""Down in the Valley"" fails on most fronts to surround and envelop his extraordinary performance with anything even approaching a good film.

Director and Writer David Jacobson makes a heroic attempt to draw comparisons with the idea, though it is 2006, of the ""dying"" of the Old West and it's Cowboys and some of what he posits works because of Norton's work but most of it doesn't.

The perennial bad teen Evan Rachel Wood as Tobe, Harlan's love interest does a good job but Wood really needs to move on and out of these roles: she's beautiful, she's rebellious, she's bad...ok, we've got it!

""Down in the Valley"" (the San Fernando Valley in the Los Angeles area, by-the-way...home of among other things the contemporary porno industry) tries hard, has good intentions but fails to make its points in a logical, thoughtful manner. It is obvious that Jacobson has talent and several scenes in this film are magical: there are just not enough of them.",1156204800,12,1110,4.831578947368421
2605226,5,B000GDH9NM,"I saw 'Down In The Valley' with two girls, thinking, me being a guy, they would love it and I would think it was dismal. But, much to my suprise, I found myself enjoying it quite a bit. Even more to my suprise, I was the only one in the group that liked it. One kept saying that she loved it, only because someone in the movie said ""Just swim in your underwear. Mexican's do."" The other was saying throughout most of the movie how much she liked it, but then at the end said it dragged on and on and took too long to get to the main action. I disagree with this. Bringing on the shootouts early in the movie would have padded the impact of the movie. It's not an action movie, at least not in context, so having them late in the third act worked. However, most of the violence, especially one scene, is very shocking (one of the people I was woth literally screamed in suprise, and then kept saying 'Oh my God. Oh my God.' But, the movie isn't about the shocking onslaught of violence in the last act, it's about a psychotic guy, disillusioned by modern day, who believes he's a cowboy, going so far to stage shootouts in his apartment where he shoots at imaginary foes, then pretends to be shot himself.

The movie does have a few small problems, though. The girl, Tobe (Evan Rachel Wood), that Harlan the cowboy (Edward Norton) begins having a romantic relationship with should have seen the shocking change of character coming way down the tracks. Her brother, Lonnie (Rory Culkin), also takes to the cowboy, but he should see when, after the Harlan becomes dangerous, that it may be time to give up on that friendship. But these are small problems in an otherwise great movie. Alot of people have said that the cowboy movie symbolism is way over the top (one reviewer said ""It's not symbolism, or even Symbolism, but SYMBOLISM!"") I didn't feel this way. The movie could have been a very plain romantic drama, but it adds an extra layer in making it's main character in a state of mental deterioration. The movie spends its first half on how Tobe (short for October) and Harlan get involved with each other, and then it spends the last half on Harlan slowly going crazy, and eventually exploding.

Tobe is an 18 year old teenager living in San Fernando Valley with her brother Lonnie, and her police officer father, Wade (David Morse, who is wasted and does nothing more than yell at Tobe and shoot a few people). One day, going to the beach, Tobe and her friends stop at a gas station where Harlan works. Tobe invites him along, and he quits his job at the gas station so that he can go with them. This scene is followed by a short scene at the beach, and that is followed by a weird sex scene between the two. Harlan meets Lonnie, who thinks he's just about as cool as anything, and Wade meets him as well. Wade is not on the same wave-length as Lonnie, and still considers his daughter a minor. Wade dislikes Harlan so much that he bypasses doing what any normal person would do, which is forbidding his daugter to hang around with him, and goes straight to threatening to shoot Harlan in the head when he arrives to pick up Tobe. But Harlan and Tobe continue to see each other, all while Wade continually beats Tobe. This is another small problem with the movie. Wade throws Tobe through a window, but she has not a scratch on her.

In the end, 'Down In The Valley' takes on an incredibly serious tone, as well as a creepy one. The preview never alluded to this, and I think it was good that way. No one expected what happens to happen, and therefore the shock value is greater. There are a few bravura sequences in the movie, among which is a completely old fashioned shootout at the end. Edward Norton's character is also a great pleasure to watch. He's like a combination of Butch Cassidy and Travis Bickle. ""Down In The Valley"" is by far the best movie to be released this year, and I really can't see why people dislike it so much. It's a very likeable movie, one that has great emotion and depth and isn't just about a crazy guy. You can tell from the first scene that the movie is going to take a turn down a darker road, but we don't expect the movie to become genuinely creepy. And we don't expect it to be as good as it was.

Running Time: 2 Hours 5 Minutes

Rating: Rated R (brief sexuality, strong profanity, and shocking, but not overly graphic, violence that includes shootings and domestic abuse.",1151625600,,4418,4.396088019559902
2605227,3,B000GDH9NM,"In `Down in the Valley' Edward Norton again shows his talent as one of the best actors in his generation, who can create a credible portrait of an apparently implausible character. Here Ed Norton plays one Harlan, who speaks and behaves like a cowboy even though he is living in modern-day San Fernando Valley. Actually, Harlan seems to think that he is truly a character (and of course a Shane-like heroic one) coming directly out of good, old Western films

When a beautiful and spirited teenager Tobe (Evan Rachel Wood), bored with the life there (and especially the life with her father or dysfunctional family), meets this charismatic guy working at a gas station, they fall in love with each other almost instantly. Tobe's younger brother Lonnie (Rory Culkin) also likes Harlan because of his free-spirited attitudes, but Harlan's unconventional behaviors (like riding a horse in the Valley) could be not only a joyful experience to Tobe and Lonnie, but also something much different than they had expected.

Bruce Dern is also seen in a minor role as an angry horse owner.

I do not give away much about the story, but I only say this. As Tobe's protective father (David Morse) understands, Harlan and his fantasy could be dangerous to the ones around him, and the film, which looks like a quirky romance about the incongruous couple in the first half, becomes suddenly more serious in the second. The gap between them is considerable though it is, I suppose, exactly what the writer/director David Jacobson wants to do. Still I am not sure that the downside of someone's fantasy could be or should be like this.

What is the most memorable thing in the film is, as I said before, Edward Norton's credible character, but the fact is the acting is unanimously good, particularly that of Evan Rachel Wood, who is willing to be deceived by the fantasy of this handsome stranger. What is equally impressive is its simple but evocative soundtrack music which perfectly matches the scenes. Probably those who actually live there might not think so, but the locations of the Valley with the hills and freeways give strength to the story as the backdrop.

During the interview with one Japanese reporter, Edward Norton said that people (including the director of this film) tend to think that he prefers so-called `independent' films, but `Down in the Valley' is actually the first indie film that he is in. (`American History X' is from New Line Cinema.) It is a bit surprising, but if we misunderstand that way, that is because we know from his superb acting that he is always a gifted actor whose roles do not fit in the conventional mold.

Anyway, the two leads Norton and Wood (who was also wonderful in `Thirteen') both give us subtle, nuanced performances, and though it must be admitted that the film's unique story and its symbolic use of Westerns do not always work, `Down in the Valley' provides a pair of interesting characters supported by good acting.",1150675200,7,2964,4.824803149606299
2605228,4,B000GDH9NM,"This slow-burning indie flick tips its cowboy hat to American classics like Taxi Driver and Badlands. Like Travis Bickle, Harlan Fairfax Carruthers is the hero of his own stories, but is he the hero of this story? The film doesn't spoon-feed us any answers, letting a wonderfully on-form Edward Norton peel away Harlan's layers at his own pace. Norton channels the best qualities of James Dean, Montgomery Clift and Robert DeNiro into yet another complex role that still bears his unique stamp. Evan Rachel Wood is equally compelling as the headstrong yet fragile October, starved for love and seeking an escape. David Morse is understatedly brilliant as the father figure, who could easily have descended into typical father figure cliches but emerges as a fully-rounded character in his own right. And last but not least, we get a powerful performance from child actor Rory Culkin as October's little brother, who looks up to Harlan as the father he never had.

Although a few scenes come off a bit too derivative, the film still offers a fresh vision, juxtaposing San Fernando's sun-baked urban sprawl with the pockets of green that fuel Harlan's Old West fantasies. Its cinematic scope is especially impressive considering that it was made on a shoestring budget. Unfortunately, some lapses in script continuity remind the viewer that it's not a polished studio product. (The most glaring example appears in the climactic third act, when Harlan's beard goes through two different incarnations before disappearing altogether in one 24-hour period.)

The occasional one-dimensional character, flaky bit of dialogue, and tacked-on thematic elements also conspire to keep this from a perfect score. One plot twist in particular has an intriguing Saul Bellow flavor to it, but it comes out of nowhere and is left disappointingly unexplored. In addition, I'm leery of the somewhat heavy-handed anti-gun stance that the film seems to adopt towards the end. But it's still a tragically riveting tale of longing, loneliness, and fatherlessness. The sound mix is also excellent, blending  elements of folk, country and psychedelia to create an almost surrealist atmosphere. The editing and scoring of the last scene still haunts me days later.

Down in the Valley is a fine indie effort and a hidden gem that deserves to be seen by a wider audience. If you spy it in a bargain bin, snap it up and give it a watch.",1424563200,,2407,5.070707070707071

2605236,5,B000GDH9NM,"DVD cover and title portray this Indie style film as a Western, but this is only so in the socially isolated Harlan's somewhat deranged mind. He meets a rebellious teenaged girl at his gas station job and quits on the spot. This quickly ignites into a passionate, perilous relationship.

A well written and executed film that at times was almost painful to watch, e.g., when the girl's father tells Harlan who is desperate for acceptance in great detail that he is a loser. The music throughout this film was perfect for setting the mood. Having gone to high school in San Bernardino myself, seeing the high school students and area felt very familiar/real; it brought back lots of memories of that time in my life. As in 25th Hour Edward Norton excels in his ability to make you ache for an ""undesirable"" hoping he'll prevail, somehow.

Highlight: Edward Norton riding a horse and shooting pistols.

2605237,4,B000GDH9NM,"It's quite difficult to meld a slice-of-life drama with a somewhat fantastical homage to the Old West of movie lore, but this film nearly manages to bring it off.

What keeps the viewer committed to seeing this story through to the long-winded end is its brilliant cast.  The protaganist is a self-deluded drifter, played by Edward Norton to perfection.  Norton's every moment on screen is testament to the infinitely small nuances that a master actor can bring to a challenging role such as this.

The next-best performance in this film belongs to Rory Culkin as 13 year-old Lonnie.  Much of Lonnie's dialogue consists of saying ""yes"" or ""no"" to questions put to him by the other characters.  Uttering dialogue that is so one-dimensional while creating a character that is fascinating to watch is a high achievement of the actor's craft.  Culkin's unvarnished simplicity in playing this role is a genuine delight.

Evan Rachel Wood is sad and beautiful as Norton's love interest.  David Morse is aflame with inner turmoil and outward rampages of anger as Wood's father.  Both actors give the viewer everything that we need to care about their characters and to follow them with profound interest as the story unfolds.

There are some problems with the plot, especially toward the end.  The story eventually leads us to a mythos-heavy fairytale landscape where the Old West brutally collides with the New.  But it's always compelling to watch.  The viewer can never really predict where the story will take us.  The cinematography is stunning.  There are images in this film that will probably stay with you forever.

This is a movie that is fresh, inventive and filled to the brim with distinctive performances.  It's a great flick.",1283644800,,1733,4.979094076655052
2605238,4,B000GDH9NM,"I don't know if this movie went nowhere at theaters because people mistook it for a western, it was poorly promoted, or it's just too damn smart for success. It made for a real surprise on DVD, though. What starts off as a moving romance (albeit kind of creepy due to the massive age difference), slowly turns into something dark and (eventually) violent. I wouldn't call Edward Norton's character evil (as some reviews have). I don't think that his actions are premeditated and I don't think they involve malice. (That is debatable though. The movie, rightfully, doesn't make it perfectly clear.) I think he's a troubled man who has an emotional breakdown when he realizes he's losing the only thing he really cares about. With just some minor changes in the script, David Morse's father could easily have been the traditional, 100% bad guy and Norton could have been the hero who rides in to save the day.

The acting and direction are top notch all around. It is seldom that a movie of this quality and maturity is made anymore. There is none of the pretentious artificiality of so many independent films, and none of the compromise common to most Hollywood films. Not quite a masterpiece, but the type of movie that mature, intelligent film-goers should be seeing none-the-less.",1270598400,,1282,4.827272727272727
2605239,4,B000GDH9NM,"It doesn't completely nail what it's apparently going for, but surprisingly `Down in the Valley' stays with you longer than you'd expect.  With riveting performances (Norton and Morse are simply outstanding) and an intriguing plot that tackles weighty subjects and stands out as uniquely visionary, `Down in the Valley' is a film you are bound to remember, even if you don't enjoy it.

I mean, let's face it; this is NOT a film for everyone.

The film centers around a borderline sociopath named Harlan Carruthers.  Harlan uses his comical persona as a way to escape the redundancy of his life.  He hasn't a steady job or a love life and he's living in a string of motels.  His life starts to unravel when he meets Tobe, a young an impetuous teenager who sees a relationship with Harlan as a way to escape her seemingly domesticated existence.  She is bored, and she wants to experience something exciting.  Despite Harlan's near-ridiculousness, he is exciting and Tobe envies that.  Her father is not impressed.  He sees right through Harlan's exterior.  He sees the mental deterioration, not necessarily in a `handicapped' kind of way.  He sees that Harlan has `lost his grip', that he is living in his own world, and he knows that it is dangerous.

I actually love the comparisons made to `Taxi Driver', for it helps me look at the film a little differently, and may even induce a completely different reaction from me upon another look.  I personally consider `Taxi Driver' to be one of the finest films ever made, and the message it conveys is poignant even today.  `Down in the Valley' attempts to `go there', but I think that it falls just short of really `going there'.  It needed to filter through Harlan's mental state a little more, really give him some more layers.  I will admit, at first Harlan can come off as a tad corny and it's almost a deterrent, but Norton works wonders with this character and brings it all together in the end (or at least the best that he can).  Still, the film almost feels as if it has more to say that maybe it doesn't know how to convey.

That said, it has more than enough going for it to make it a MUST SEE type film.

The acting is the films key selling point.  Norton had a banner year in '06, with this and `The Illusionist' and `The Painted Veil', and while this isn't his best film (`The Painted Veil' is a near masterpiece), this is by far his best performance.  He just really pulls this together.  Like I said, he starts off almost like a caricature, but he really molds this man perfectly in the end.  For me though, this film belongs to David Morse.  His portrayal of a single father struggling to protect his children is heartbreakingly realistic.  His outbursts are so heartfelt and emotionally invested.  You can see him working things out in his head, his eyes glazing over with aggravated foreknowledge.

Evan Rachel Wood and Rory Culkin more than hold their own, and Wood especially has a few scenes that prove her `thirteen' stint wasn't just luck.

It has a lot going for it, even if it doesn't quite pull it `all' together in the end.  I'd certainly recommend this film.  It is tense, original and for the most part very engaging.  Norton is fantastic and Morse is Oscar worthy.  It's a small gem of a film that you may not have ever known existed.",1269561600,2,3313,4.579931972789115

2605241,3,B000GDH9NM,"The acting, I agree, is fine. I was prompted to pursue this after reviews of, 'Elvis' to which it is likened. It possesses nothing like the turmoil building within 'Elvis' though. In fact, accomplished as Norton is in this, the nuanced complexity wrought by Gael Garcia Bernal makes this urban cowboy, childish in any sense of the word. The direction hasn't the pacing of the aforementioned. Now, all these misgivings are only applicable if you are expectingthe suspense of, 'Elvis'. I liked Morse, as usual. He seems to have the law enforcer gig whenever required,'Dancer in the Dark', 'Indian Runner'. Not an endearing critter here, but he's learn't a thing or two by the time of the improbable comeuppance on the corny western filmset...a scene that is just too cute, too predictable, for its own merit.",1237248000,,806,4.9338235294117645
2605242,5,B000GDH9NM,"Down in the Valley is a classic tale about just how lost we can get in life.  Edward Norton plays a confused young man (Harlan) who has found his place in life to be a time that has past.  There are some really cool scenes with him and his ""6 Shooters"".  He does some cool trick draws.  Evan Rachel Wood (Toby) is quietly hot and Rory Culkin (Lonnie) is...Rory Culkin...always good, although better in Signs (2002, M.N. Shyamalan).

David Morse however plays an awsome character in this film.  In my opinion his best since Brutal in The Green Mile.  A concerned father, with a rebelious teenage daughter (E.R. Wood) and a timid son (R.Culkin), Morse's character Wade has to fend off Harlan's advances.  Like any not so mature person would, Harlan continues on his quest of being an Urban Cowboy and running off with Toby...A surprise twist and action packed ending make this movie, for the cast it had, a 5 for sure.",1225929600,,916,4.576687116564417

2605244,4,B000GDH9NM,"This is a pretty good film. It isn't a great film but it is a good film.  The entire cast turns in stellar performances and Evan Rachel Wood is just a beautiful as ever though I think she was better in The King of California.  There's a good cautionary tale here, the directing and cinematography are top notch.  Why only four stars?

Well, Down in the Valley does take a while to find its footing. You just know that the relationship that starts off rather innocently is going to morph into tragedy - and it does.  Of course it does but it takes a while to get the momentum going.  This was another of those films where I wondered about 15 minutes in whether it was going to really reach out and grab my attention.  Not to worry, eventually it does just that but it does take its time getting there.  There is also one setting where Harlan and his friend Twig wake up inside one of those old western towns that like ""Old Tucson"" that are out there today for the purposes of shooting western movies and touristy reenactments of gunfights.  That's a bit too much of a coincidence for me.  I have to wonder whether that setting is in the book... There is a book isn't there?

I can't say too much about the story or characters without spoiling the viewing experience.  I will say there are some scenes with Harlan (Norton) where I immediately made both visual and psychological ties to James Dean in Giant.

In a nutshell, this film is all about whether someone is really who they seem to be.  It keeps you wondering about who's the good guy and who's the bad guy here?  Even when you finally gets something of a final answer to that question you are still left without complete closure (deliberately) because there are many admirable traits despite the character's overall failure as a human being.

One small caution for animal lovers, there is a seen with a frightened horse trapped in a garage that some may find  distressing.  The animal doesn't get hurt but it is a little intense.",1217462400,,1985,4.466666666666667

2605248,3,B000GDH9NM,"This small film stuck with me after one viewing, mostly due to Edward Norton's touching and subtle performance.  He portrays Harlan Carruthers, a drifter who inhabits the persona of a South Dakota cowboy working in the San Fernando Valley.  For a good part of the movie, the viewer is not sure how much of that persona is fantasy, and how much is fact - but the thing is, Harlan isn't sure, either, and that lends his character its sad charm.  While working at a gas station he meets October (""Tobe"") a sexually forward but emotionally adrift 17-year-old (Evan Rachel Wood), and her 13-year-old brother, Lonnie, nicely played by Rory Culkin (who gave such a lovely performance as Mel Gibson's son in M. Knight Shmaylan's ""Signs"").  Tobe and Lonnie are spending an aimless summer hanging out in the cultural desert of the smog-ridden San Fernando Valley.  They have no mother, and are being raised by one Wade, played by the often underrated David Morse.  Wade works in the correctional system, and leaves the two children to their own devices much of the time, seesawing back and forth between neglect and overprotectiveness.  Wade is not Lonnie's biological father, and it is unclear whether he is Tobe's biological father, and how he came to be the children's only parent - this unresolved issue is about the only narrative flaw in the film.

When Harlan and Tobe meet at the gas station, she immediately senses something ""different"" about him and invites him to go to the beach with her and her friends.  A romance quickly develops, although Harlan is clearly a good bit older than Tobe.  Harlan presents, initially, a gentle and philosophically evolved persona that entrances not only Tobe, but the attention-starved Lonnie as well.  As the film progresses, and Wade's disapproval of the relationship exerts pressure on Harlan and the two youngsters,  Harlan's quirky but sweet aura begins to reveal darker dimensions.  For a long time, the viewer is uncertain whether Harlan is what he seems, and if he is not, how much of his pretense represents a danger to Tobe and Lonnie.  Norton does an exceptional job of pacing the small shifts that begin to change the viewer's perception of Harlan.

Eventually, the divide between fact and fantasy that Harlan's presence in their lives uncovers forces Tobe and Lonnie to come to grips with harsh realities, pain, and loss.  They mature through the experience, but part of their maturing is a curious understanding at the last that what Harlan at first offered was valuable and worth wanting, even though it was offered under false pretences.  It is clear at the end that the adults do not share the youngsters' understanding of this, and that the experience, although it has on some level justified the adults' judgment, widens rathar than narrows the gap between them and the children.

This is a poignant story, well written and well played, and is absolutely worth your time.",1201132800,6,2925,4.9105691056910565
2605249,4,B000GDH9NM,"When reading the raft of reviews posted here for Down In the Valley it becomes obvious that some reviewers were expecting the film to be something it was never meant to be. Despite protagonist Harlan Carruthers' ""cowboy"" pretensions, it is not a western nor is it just another movie about a middle-class girl who finds love on the wrong side of the tracks. What it becomes when one looks beyond the outward story of forbidden romance and teen angst is an allegory of sorts about how what society regards as progress relentlessly changes the world we live in and our relationship to it for better or worse. The juxtaposition toward the end between the freedom of riding through idyllic rolling pastureland then suddenly being confronted by the creeping sprawl of a ticky-tack housing development under construction speaks volumes. Kind of like a real cowboy finding himself trapped in a box canyon, I'd say.
Wade, the father, early on had the cowboy Harlan down pat as a loser who was trying to be somebody and was just using the cowboy shtick to attract attention to himself. But in case you think the ""cowboy in LA"" act is too outlandish to be realistic, let me mention that when I was a kid in San Diego who spent a lot of time at the beach there was one long-haired hanger-on who called himself ""Country"" who met with considerable romantic success using his hillbilly act on the local beach bunnies. One more empirical proof that opposites often attract.
One reviewer criticized the father as an overbearing alpha male. Well, what father wants his teenage daughter to hang out with a ne'er-do-well twice her age? Harlan's phony act was patently obvious to adults, but to a couple of kids who felt trapped in a numbingly boring suburbia, he seemed a romantic relic of a bygone age.
Overall, the acting is strong though the story wobbles at times. Edward Norton is excellent as Harlan the wannabe and increasingly delusional  cowboy. His laconic and sleepy-eyed movements often remind the viewer of Robert Mitchum. I like David Morse as Tobe and Lonnie's father, a single parent trying to juggle his need to be a provider with his equal need to guide and be solicitous of the welfare of two rather ungrateful children. When Harlan comes sniffing around, Wade is naturally protective of his kids especially when Harlan shows a lack of respect for his rules vis-a-vis his home and family. In addition, I enjoyed Evan Rachel Wood's very realistic portrayal of a bored and rebellious teenager trying to figure out her place in the world.
While parts of the film may seem unrealistic, there is a lot of hidden meaning ready to be discovered for those willing to think. Down In the Valley is certainly no masterpiece, but its no dud either.",1197590400,2,2735,4.770042194092827
2605250,1,B000GDH9NM,"Talky and contrived, this fake ""western"" set in the San Fernando Valley misses all its targets -- in spite of the gunplay.  I grew up semi rural Texas with a rich (not redneck) cowboy ethic and culture, and I lived in San Fernando Valley for a decade.  I recognized no truth in any of the characters in this incredibly slow-going movie.  It reminded me of an expanded student film in which the filmmakers have no real life experience but only know a virtual life as lived in front of a TV screen or in dark theater.  Life is too short to waste on bad movies.  And, sadly, this is one.  This is a two hour film with about ten minutes of actual story.",1191888000,,649,4.235772357723577

2605252,4,B000GDH9NM,"Overshadowed by movies like ""Brokeback Mountain"".  ""Down in the Valley"" got by my radar of movies to watch.  Finally reviewing it, it took me by surprise.
  I should've known with actors like Edward Norton, and Evan Rachel Wood; you're never disappointed.  What a great character study between two people, that's mysterious and deep in depth.  This is far from being a slapstick western, but more of that classic tale of falling in love.  Who you fall in love with is always my greatest question.
  The performances given by both actors go hand in hand.  I've seen Norton act out a lot of roles, my favorite in ""American History X"".  But now he's got me believing that he's got some southern in him too.  I thought it would be hard for Rachel Wood to top her acting stardom in movies like ""Thirteen"", and ""Pretty Persuasion"".  But she continues to do so.  With acting like this, you only see glimpses of two talented actors in their past and future careers.
  If you want a movie that's honest, sad, persuasive, loving, and overpowering, ""Down in the Valley"" is it.  I think what it greatly offers is truth.  The only reason I give it four stars, is because for me, it's hard to know what to feel emotional about in the end.

2605253,4,B000GDH9NM,"Most people seem to really not get this movie at all.  Aside from structure, I don't think it's really about being compared to the old west as much as it tries to speak about striving for identity and to be close with others.  The cowboy deal just happens to be the clothes Norton's character wears, but I get the feeling it could have been a pirate outfit, really, without changing his character's purpose.  Of course the land one inherits in life is connected to one's identity, so what is left of that, the film asks.

I disagree that this movie is a mix of Taxi Driver and Lolita.  For one, Norton's age isn't mentioned, and is in fact never brough up as an issue even by the girls's protective father.  So the Lolita comparison is brought entirely by the reviewer.  Taxi Driver?  I can see that more.  But I think any discussion of that leads to thinking more about what Taxi Driver is about more than what Down in the Valley is about.

  The film does feel familiar in a lot of ways.  And it goes on for a little while longer than it should...to me it should have begun wrapping it up soon after Tober maded her decision about Norton's character (I'm being vague about all this on purpose).

  Other than that, the music is wonderful, there are a lot of great moments, and the movie is pretty compelling.  I really liked it.  And usually Norton gets on my nerves.",1186704000,2,1369,4.386454183266932
2605254,4,B000GDH9NM,"Down in the Valley is a chance to see Edward Norton create another multi-layered, unpredictable, and highly watchable character.  Evan Rachel Wood is not just another pretty face, but a young woman with acting chops and great instincts beyond her years.  Ms. Woods also has star quality; she eats the lens.

Despite their obvious age differences, Ms. Woods, Tobe, leads the cowboy Harlan played by Edward Norton, into her world of sex and drugs, which she will come to rue, as Harlan is anything but what he seems.

David Morse does a fine job as Wade, a man in an emotional tug of war with Harlan, for his rebellious, and out-of-control daughter.  Wade seems a man not quite sure how he found himself as head of this disfunctional household.  Rory Culkin following in McCauley's footsteps turns in an amazing performance as Lonnie, the insecure and frightened younger brother, who finds in Harlan a hero, protector and a friend.

The San Fernando Valley itself plays the title role.  This middle class suburb of L.A., becomes the ""old west"" for Harlan and Tobe, riding a stolen horse, owned by a cantakerous old man (played by Bruce Dern) straight out of a western.  The inevitable showdown between Harlan and Wade begins on the set of a western, with cameras and crew conveniently out of view so one wonders if the set exists or is part of Harlan's fantasy. In the DVD EXTRA's there are deleted scenes that make clear that it is indeed a tv set.

Is Wade actually the children's father, or merely a guardian as Lonnie relates to Harlan and if so how did he come to be their guardian.  From the way the children play their scenes, I sensed that Tobe is Wade's child; while Lonnie is not.  Are we to assume that Harlan's warning to Lonnie of the dangers of the foster care/juvenile justice system, were visited upon the person of Martin Weiss?  The filmmaker credits the viewer with a few smarts; and leaves these questions for the audience to decide, just as the children will have to decide for themselves the impact of Harlan's presence in their lives.  A more predictable director would have had one of the children or perhaps their father recite a homily like speech as they stood looking across the valley; silence seems the most appropriate and profound response.",1183334400,2,2270,4.713924050632912

Edward Norton has proved his acting talent in films like American History X, Fight Club, and Primal Fear.  This movie, however, doesn't belong in the same class.  It borrows heavily from classics like Taxi Driver, Five Easy Pieces, and Badlands (three of my favorite films) but doesn't have anywhere near their success.  The movie just didn't add up to much.  The dynamics are missing.  The cause and effect relationships are weak.  The dialogue is mundane.  Everything is straightforward.

2605258,3,B000GDH9NM,"Edward Norton plays an evil drifter in ""Down In the Valley"", a low-budget flick he made between big budget movies in 2005. He meets and woos 16-year-old Evan Rachel Wood, daughter of his foil, David Morse, and brother to Rory Culkin, whom Norton also turns toward him with his easygoing, hayseed charm.

What is most recommendable in this film is Norton's outstanding caricature of a South Dakotan using his enigmatic charms to entrance Los Angelite Wood and her brother against the wishes of their lawman dad, Morse. Bruce Dern has a small role as someone trying to unmask Norton's evil character.

As always, Norton is riveting in the understatement with which he carries out his role. You want to accept his explanation that he's a misunderstood well-meaning guy against Morse's admonition that ""I've seen your type before."" Morse plays the good guy opposite the evil star, although he really isn't that much of a good guy. Abusive with both kids, Morse plays a lawman that uses his position to dissaude Norton from sticking around his daughter. This precedes a somewhat predicatable scene where the film both unravels and begins, finally!, to get interesting.

I say finally! because this movie is about as slow as maple syrup in February for 75 minutes. It crawls around with little forward motion in a sequence of scenes that define the characters and build the apocalypse that occurs after 75 minutes, when the movie seems to take off.

Still, this is required viewing for fans of any of the principal actors, all of whom are well-cast and carry out their roles well. Morse played another good guy foil to a bad guy star in the outstanidng 2001 movie, ""The Indian Runner"". If you like this movie, buy, rent or borrow the other one.

Evan Rachel Wood gives a mind blowing performance as the rebellious teen who clashes with her domineering father who lacks an emotional connection to his daughter. The scene where Harlan (Edward Norton) and Tobe (Wood) first lock eyes is brilliantly filmed.  Through the back windshield of her friend's auto, Tobe seductively gazes at Harlan who is filling the car with gas. The camera moves back and forth from Harlan's innocent, naive face to Tobe's angelic face.  From their first ""date"" at the beach, the two characters become romanticaly involved.  For Tobe it is a temporary escape from a shallow existance as a high school girl who doesn't seem to be headed for college, nor a promising career.  She is trapped in a low middle class home where her father ( David Morse) works as a night-time correction officer unaware that his role as a father is much more than just a financial provider.  The tension between Tobe and her father are captured well on screen.  Wood gives all she has in the role of Tobe.  I am glad that there are still some actresses in filmland that can deliver in a role so demanding as this one. Angeline Jolie is not half the actress that Wood is.  I hope that Wood is offered more roles to showcase her talents.  Edward Norton gives another thought provoking performance as the delusional Harlan; a character only an actor like Norton can make memorable.  What makes the film a just miss in the ""indie classic vien"" is the last 45 minutes or so, when Harlan's delusional world becomes unraveled.

Although the story centers around the relationship between Harlan (Edward Norton) and (Tobe) Evan Rachel Wood, several other relationships come sharply into play. The family dynamic between Tobe, her younger brother Lonnie (Rory Culkin), and her father (David Morse), and the relationship that Harlan develops with Lonnie.

This film offers a realistic, if odd portrayal of life. Harlan likes to think of himself as a cowpoke, making his way from ranch to ranch, when actually he's stuck in the suburbs of San Fernando Valley working as a gas station attendant. Tobe is an angry teenager who meets and falls in love with the older Harlan, against her father's wishes.

What results is a beautiful, sometimes almost corny, film about relationships, reality, fantasy, and how thin the line between good and bad can sometimes be. If you like independent films that actually deliver, theis is the one for you. Down in the Valley gives viewers what more movies should: something they haven't seen before.

The story is set purely in L.A. as we watch a cowpoke named Harlan (Edward Norton, THE ILLUSIONIST) walk into town wearing Levi's and a frayed rope draped over one shoulder. The dichotomy is immediately striking as planes fly over his head and power lines droop across roadways.

Then we jump to a small family that lives in L.A. and are having troubles. Tobe (Evan Rachel Wood, THE MISSING) is a very pretty young high schooler who lives with her burly father Wade (David Morse, 16 BLOCKS) and her clingy brother Lonnie (Rory Culkin, SIGNS). Tobe is growing too fast into womanhood and independence, and she and her father constantly joust with each other regarding curfews, clothing, and being a responsible teen.  Lonnie latches onto Tobe all the time, a lost little brother whom Tobe is growing tired of raising since her father works all the time to help support them. And Lonnie isn't Wade's son, being an adopted family member but still a significant part of their lives.

One sunny day Tobe and her friends pull into a gas station to fuel up and encounter the ""for real"" cowboy, Harlan. Tobe is immediately attracted to him and invites him to go to the beach with her and her friends. Harlan accepts at the cost of his job, simply walking away from it. The two form an instant relationship and all appears sweet.

But when Tobe's father Wade finds out about it, he's less than happy. Harlan tries to steal into his good graces but Wade will have none of it. His parental guard goes up and puts the brakes on their relationship.

Initially we're pulling for Harlan and Tobe to become the ideal star-crossed lovers, battling family and circumstances in order to ride off into the sunset. But all is an illusion as we see Harlan's cowboy facade crumbling under the weight of a doomed relationship. Not willing to give up, Harlan tries anything he can fathom to get back into the family's good graces. This includes taking young Lonnie out shooting, stealing horses for daylong trips, and finally doing the unthinkable of unthinkables.

The fascinating portrayal of a wannabe cowpoke in today's society is excellently done by Edward Norton. He is so adorable in the beginning that most female viewers will probably fawn over him. But when his steady psychological break starts showing, a terrible realization hits the audience; Harlan isn't Harlan at all.

The film comes complete with panoramic views of the San Fernando Valley atop lush hills, giving us a truly western feel to the movie, and there's even a quick draw shoot out that'll both entertain and repulse most movie watchers.

The only downside is the ending. With all that happened to Tobe, Lonnie, and Wade at the hands of Harlan, it didn't make sense that they would ""honor"" him in this way (no spoilers).

But this is still a fantastic psychological, modern day western. Norton is lovable and creepy both at the same time.",1161734400,7,3145,4.743589743589744

But the beautiful and comely October is underage, and Papa doesn't like the older and somewhat weird Norton dating October, so he forbids their liasons. But Harlan doesn't take no for an answer, and when he can't find October, he settles for her little brother, taking the young boy on another stolen horse ride and teaching him how to shoot .45 revolvers. On their return, Daddy is waiting, and pulls a gun on Harlan, threatens he'll use it if Harlan ever darkens their door again. Harlan responds by breaking into the home, stealing October's Daddy's .45 and packing her a bag. But October won't leave. Tempers fly and October is shot. Harlan tells October's brother October was shot by their father, and that only Harlan can rescue the boy from being a ward of the state. Another horse is stolen, and Harlan and the boy are on the run from the cops and October's father through the hills above the San Fernando Valley. Shots are fired and people go down. But Harlan and the boy are still on the run, and October's wounded father is hot on their heels.

This movie charms and frightens the viewer. Harlan's progression into madness is slow and masked by his easy going nature, his simple humor and by his easy smile. But underneath, Harlan is seething, roiling in a world that doesn't fit him. A cowboy out of his element. A dead shot with a lightning quick draw. Harlan knows he's going to die, and he's determined to take some people with him.

Meanwhile, the children's father is finding ways to bridge the resentments which have split his family apart over time. Coping with adolesence can be tough for a hardened man pre-occupied with his corrections job and looking for love. Once disinterested and authoritative toward his children, the father discovers the depth of his love for his children, and learns new ways to communicate it. adversity can bring people together.

2605269,4,B000GDH9NM,"In the DVD bonus interviews for this movie, the people involved with the project claim originality for it. However the author of the film's script admits to being a lifelong film buff. And I think he unwittingly re-wrote ""Taxi Driver"" when he composed this material.

This movie follows the same general arc as ""Taxi Driver."" It pursues the same general theme of a man trapped on the fringes of society, with no one to invest his love in, with nowhere to go but into an increasingly elaborated fantasy in which he features himself as heroic rescuer of a lady in distress. But instead of weaving his fantasy out of the cloth of New York's mean streets, the hero of ""Down in the Valley"" casts himself as a cowboy in the Old West. His joust with the world takes the form of a perpetual shoot-out, a perpetual need to get the drop on his opponents.

The parallel between the two movies extends even to the heroes' rehearsing their respective challenges to the world in front of a mirror. Only instead of building muscle and asking, ""You talkin' to me?"" - this hero practices his draw and commands, ""Reach `em high!""

This duplication of a classic movie isn't a bad thing. There is room for another take on ""Taxi Driver."" Edward Norton is a sweeter, gentler Travis Bickle, although we early get the same intimations of his capacity to become dangerous.

This movie is also somewhat more realistic than ""Taxi."" Edward Norton's character similarly meets circumstances in his surroundings that feed into his fantasy. At one point, he finds himself in a wild west setting built for a movie shoot. It's a coincidence, but it's a little more likely than the over-the-top brothel combat in which Robert de Niro gets to live out his dream. And although Edward Norton's fantasy also absorbs him and becomes a mythic re-enactment, it's still a development that could conceivably take place in California's San Fernando Valley where this movie is set. You won't be left wondering, endlessly debating whether or not the conclusion is meant as a dream sequence.

But as with almost all of Edward Norton's films, his performance is the main reason to watch and praise the movie. Here he plays the character of Harlan with a combination slyness/shyness that kept me on edge, but that also deeply touched me.",1161216000,4,2287,4.765151515151516
2605270,4,B000GDH9NM,"It takes a certain mindset to appreciate DOWN IN THE VALLEY, a quiet little movie about little people who want something more than what their environs offer.  The film is long (just over two hours), could use some editing, allows a rather pedestrian musical score to cover the dialogue far too frequently, and for much of the film the camera exposure makes everything so sun drenched (even for the San Fernando Valley where the story takes place!) that it feels bleached.  But those aspects feel secondary in the presence of some very fine performances by an excellent cast directed with vision by writer/director David Jacobson.

Life is exceedingly boring in the bland town where Tobe (Evan Rachel Wood) and her little brother Lonny (Rory Culkin) live with their sheriff father Wayne (David Morse) - we never know why there is no mother around though Wayne brings in sleepover subs at random.  Tobe has girlfriends with whom she cruises guys and on one afternoon's trip to the beach she meets gas station attendant Harlan (Edward Norton), a drifter who claims to be a rancher form South Dakota and has all the genteel manners of a gentleman raised to respect women.  Harlan lives in a trashy motel, plays and dresses as a cowboy, and has an innocence about him that makes us want to believe he is not the borderline personality he is.  Tobe picks Harlan up, they begin seeing each other despite Wayne's better judgment, and Tobe and Harlan include Lonny in their pursuit of a world that borders on make believe Western drama.  Wayne objects more strongly, discovers Harlan is tempting Tobe away from her home, and confronts Harlan until Harlan finally decides the only way to move forward is to rescue Tobe and Lonny from their bad homelife.  Harlan's dark side emerges and his cowboy play becomes real, gunshots are fired and the ending of the film is a mlange of old Western movie make-believe and contemporary tragedy of a young man out of joint with his world.

Edward Norton gives a stunning portrayal of an out of touch drifter: we never know his background except for suggestions that his childhood was spent in detention homes, foster homes, and other dysfunctional modes of getting by.  Evan Rachel Wood is radiantly beautiful as the needy teenager who ultimately cannot cope with her desires to leave the home nest.  Rory Culkin has few lines but his presence is palpably worrisome.  Bruce Dern is on board as a crusty old contemporary 'cowboy' and David Morse again turns in a performance that is three dimensional and credible (it would have been helpful to know why he is a single parent).  The film is not without its flaws (as mentioned above plus more), but it manages to give Edward Norton yet another chance to demonstrate his considerable skills as an actor who can make the most peripheral characters stick in our hearts.

He's older than she is and slightly odd (he thinks he's a cowboy) but she's drawn to him, maybe because she knows her father wouldn't approve or maybe because he's so different than anyone she's ever known that he fascinates her.  I think, perhaps, it's a little of both.  Their relationship starts off heavy and passionate, but when Harlon almost gets Tobe arrested her father Wade (David Morse) tries to put a stop to their relationship.

Harlon refuses to be torn apart from the girl he loves and so he convinces both Tobe and her younger brother Lonnie (Rory Culkin) that Wade is unreasonable and they should leave with him.  After a horrible accident leaves Tobe in critical condition the film turns from a slightly eerie drama to a game of cat and mouse as Wade tries to avenge his daughter while Harlon continues to pollute young Lonnie's mind, turning him against his father and causing him to place himself in danger for Harlon's sake.  Thank goodness for Edward Norton who plays his character with enough originality and genuine calm collected composure that Harlon, in all his insanity comes off real and somewhat believable, even when he's jumping around his apartment shooting at imaginary people.

The acting itself is a huge asset to this film which thrives on the believability of its characters to over shadow the hole-ridden plot.  Evan Rachel Wood delivers yet another knock out performance as Tobe and she gives her character the same amount of realism she conveyed in `thirteen' proving that she is a definite young star to look out for (we have so many young actresses really shining as of late, Wood to Scarlett Johansson to Kiera Knightly, Ellen Page and Camilla Belle we have a wide range of talented new comers).  I was probably most impressed with David Morse's protective father, for he played his character with so much frustration and genuine parental concern that he elevates his character from stock to influential.  He, to me, has the most powerful scenes in the film from his confrontations with his daughter to his verbal battle with Harlon.

As a whole this may be a difficult film to swallow.  It's a little far fetched that a man that obviously strange could have such a strong grip on these two children, especially when neither of them seem to be slow or, for lack of a better word, stupid.  He may have seemed like an escape from a world they've grown bored of, but it's really not the story but the performances that make this movie one worth watching.  Edward Norton is always capable of delivering a spot on performance, and while Harlon is no where near as powerful as say Derek from `American History X' or his narrator in `Fight Club' he is still outstanding here and proves yet again that he is one of our finest working actors.",1160611200,,3140,4.744485294117647
2605272,4,B000GDH9NM,"Being a long time Edward Norton fan, and an admirer of how great films are put together, I liked ""Down In The Valley"" a lot.  But there's an inconsistency near the end of the film.

Harlan is wearing a goatee when he lights a torch in the dark just before the final gunfights begin.  A short time later his goatee is no longer there.  Are we supposed to believe he takes time to shave it off for some reason between moments of being shot at?

It's still a great film with a beautiful way of contrasting the old and new west.

2605274,3,B000GDH9NM,"This film is a blatant rip-off of ""Taxi Driver.' Like that film, we have a confused, sociopathic main character that lives outside reality, attempting to grasp any sense of the world around him by trying to save 'the girl.' He lives in a different time where a demented chivalry, like that of Travis Bickle, consumes his plight in life. The scene where Norton (Harlan) is getting drunk and stoned, talking to himself, flashing his gun, round and round, swishing about in his mind, is straight 'You talkin' to me?' The scene is over-played, and now over-done: 'You talkin' to me! I'm the only one here!' The only original and interesting sequence is when Harlan accidentally walks on to a western film set. His reality now comes to life as we are, (for a moment before the big showdown) transported back when men courted ladies and dosey-doed around their partner. It's a terrific scene where dream merges with reality and reality emerges from a dream. Norton is always compelling to watch with his subtleties as a great actor. I think his finest work can be found in '25th Hour' and 'Rounders.' Haven't seen 'Illusionist,' still waiting for 'Motherless Brooklyn.' If you haven't seen 'Taxi Driver' (and if you haven't you should be deported), watch that original film before settling on this.",1159660800,5,1292,4.877272727272727
2605275,5,B000GDH9NM,"""Down in the Valley"" is the 2nd film by David Jacobson, who's previous film ""Dahmer"" was released straight-to-video. For good reason too. When he released that film, it was just another film in a series of straight-to-video films about serial killers. Out of the 5 I can think of off the top of my head (Ed Gein, Gacy, Ted Bundy, Dahmer, and Evilenko). That was the 2nd best.

But, it was a terrible movie. It was inaccurate, had a straight-to-video feel to it, and was a waste of time. It was the 2nd best because the acting was good and the cinematography was professional looking. When he made this film, it looked like it's future would be the same as Dahmer. Producer/Star Edward Norton fought to get it put in theatres and looking at the finished product, I'm glad. This is not a film that should be released straight-to-video. It's a good movie. Norton plays Harlan, a cowboy living in California's San Fernado Valley. He talks with a accent and has all the mannerisms of your classic western cowboys. He claims he's from South Dakota, but it seems that he's making up stories as he goes. While working at a gas station, Harlan meets Tobe (the very talented and beautiful Evan Rachel Wood) a rebellious 16-year old girl. For the record, Tobe isn't pronounced Toby. It's short for October and rhymes with ""globe."" Despite the age difference, there's never a weird stautory-rape overtone here; At least from my viewpoint. Harlan is charming and also befriends Tobe's younger brother Lonnie (Rory Culkin, also young and talented)...The only person Harlan fails to befriend is the brother and sister's dad Wade (the always fantastic and always underrated David Morse); Wade is a security guard (I'm pretty sure, they never really elaborate) and takes an almost instant dislike to Harlan that only gets worse as the story continues. This movie is frequently compared to Taxi Driver and I'm pretty sure writer/director Jacobson noticed too. In one scene, Harlan talks to his reflection in a mirror. The only way to have made it more obvious would to have had Harlan say ""You talkin' to me?"" The movie opened to mixed reviews; Roger Ebert gave it a hesitant thumbs down, Richard Roeper didn't care for it. Peter Travers (critic for Rolling Stone) fell in love with it. I'm going to have to take the side of Travers and Ebert. I know I gave the film 5 stars, but that's for entertainment not necessarily quality. I loved the movie; It was entertaining and the performances are great, but it's definitely flawed. First off, some of the characters make decisions that aren't very characteristic of them. I found myself liking the deceitful and mentally unstable Harlan more than the loving and sometimes violent Wade. The film's ending is a little gratuitously violent (something I've never complained about).

It's not for everybody, a lot of people besides critics haven't liked it. Edward Norton proves, once again, that he is an amazing actor with a lot of range. This is one of his best performances. Evan Rachel Wood has played this character at least twice (Thirteen and Pretty Persuasion). The only difference between this character and the other two is Tobe is rebellious, but she's a nice girl overall. The scenes between Wood and Culkin are very true (a lot of the scenes were inspired by Jacobson's childhood). I have a theory that more people will dislike this movie than not, but it's a big step forward for Jacobson and I can't stress enough how good it really is. It's haunting, it will stay with you (whether you liked it or not), and it's really well done.

2605276,4,B000GDH9NM,"Edward Norton never fails to deliver something, and as homely and polite as he comes across, right away you know that something just aint right with this kid.  He takes up with Evan Rachel Wood as October, or Tobe, and there is the proverbial clash with Tobe's dad, played by David Morse.  Morse has quite a gun collection, and as we all know, a gun seen in the first act of a play will make a reappearance in the third act.

Edward Norton's acting seems to be in about 2nd or 3rd gear, just cruising along as Harlan, his laconic drawl spinning tales from back on the ranch.  He lulls us into his character, and even when things get nasty, he remains understated, and never gets to the throbbing-vein stage, or starts screaming.  The film takes its own leisurely time to develop, there is plenty of love story, and an appearance by yet another of the vast array of Culkins, this one is named Rory, and they are all highly capable in that kid role.  As things finally begin to unravel, Ed Norton displays some pretty mean drawin' and shootin' skills, and he doesn't look too bad up on a horse, neither. It has been a good year for the Western; ""The Proposition,"" ""The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada,"" and now ""Down in the Valley.""  None of the three are old-school Westerns, but instead modern variations that are keeping a genre alive and vibrant.",1159488000,4,1352,4.516393442622951

8130852,5,B000GDH9NM,"Well, there was a mixed thought after watching this movie. Good and bad. The good thing was the beautiful and quiet country like-not country country but somewhere where the place where l lived for 4 years, Northridge California (San Fernando Valley) where is 30 minutes far away from LA, which is the exact location of this movie- a bit deserted place where I can see few people around. And the beautiful music sound like Simon & Garfunkleish and country songs.
Also the somewhat who has his own world guy Edward Norton and Evan Rachel Woon who is a beautiful actress who is one of my favourite actress who doesn't care who sees her bikini look.

The story is about Evan Rachel wood who meets Edward Norton who is much order then her and instantely falls in love with him. On the way to the beach with her friend, she asks him to go with them. Edward was working at the gas station and he quite to go with her.
From then on, they just hung around.
Evan's father didn't liked him at all. Even though he also gets along well with somewhat sick Evan's younger brother too and enjoys playing with him.
When his father prohibits Edward from meeting his daugter, he sneaks in to her room and accidentally shoots her stomach with her dad's gun.
Then everything becomes ugly.
She is in a comma. And her father searches him and shoot to kill.
The thing is since it was Edward who shot Evan, it was hard to feel pity on him when Evan's father soot him to kill. That was the onlt problem whith this movie.
The scene when Edward and Evan's father and his mates are fighting was like an old western movie and was well shot. You should check it out.
This movie is a love story and also a western. Kind of mixed nuts. Kind of strange combination. A good one.
Two main actors are playing together so well that I almost felt like they've been together for years.
After all, they are all great actors.

It's a bizarre story, to be sure, and could have easily been called Broken, as all four of the lead characters are just that.....broken.....very broken. The only thing that kept me from rating the film five stars is the fact that too much is missing. 1. What happened to their mothers.....Harland's, Tobe's, and Lonnie's? 2. Is Harlan's real father, Joe, and does Harlan steal from his father, or someone he thought was his father?. Are the kid's father and his buddy gay lovers?
