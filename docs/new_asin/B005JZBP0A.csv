4713485,3,B005JZBP0A,Very little of the collection was actually Hugh Grant.  The title of the collection was misleading to me. I guess I should have paid more attention to the descriptions of each movie.,1361923200,,182,4.6875
4713486,4,B005JZBP0A,"I like Hugh Grant so of course I start out on a positive note. The quality of the video and audio is excellent although I have not yet watched every movie on this disc.
I gave it four stars and actually considered only awarding three because I really do not care for 4 videos on one disc. While it is easy enough to select one from the four choices, getting back to selecting another one was at least for me a no go. Very annoying indeed. And given that I have another four set package (Steve McQueen) which came on four different discs, I cannot but help consider that this is a major fault and perhaps deserving of another docked star. But I was gentle.",1358726400,2,655,4.248
4713487,5,B005JZBP0A,The Hugh Grant collection is wonderful!. I love Hugh Grant and these movies were great. I would recommend this collection to anyone.,1350777600,2,132,5.045454545454546
4713498,2,B005JZBP0A,"Four full length feature movies squeezed onto one DVD? Why aren't all boxed sets produced this way? Quite simply because the quality of the product suffers. Made it through the first feature but from there on in the images froze, skipped and generally played up which made further viewing a trying experience. Thought it was too good  to believe when I purchased it but for the price was willing to risk it. Now have an expensive coaster. Stay away from this poor example of DVD mastering.",1385510400,4,489,4.686046511627907
4713499,5,B005JZBP0A,"His ability to make trivial things seem important is hopelessly romantic. It is a wonderful series of movies, based on love and luck.",1379894400,,133,4.826086956521739
4713500,3,B005JZBP0A,"None of the movies were that good.  I hadn't realized he was in this many boring movies.  If you love Hugh Grant in any thing, no matter how boring, you will probably enjoy these movies.",1379808000,,186,4.285714285714286
4713501,3,B005JZBP0A,"Not one that I would recommend to friends.  Had it's moments of good viewing.  However,  I am sure there would be many that thoroughly enjoy it.",1379721600,,144,4.461538461538462
4713502,1,B005JZBP0A,Would not get 4 on one disc anymore.  Too hard to get to the movie you want to see.  Takes way too long to fast forward.,1371081600,2,120,3.576923076923077
4713503,2,B005JZBP0A,"Too bad Hugh Grant made so many lousy movies.  The only one worth watching, in my opinion, is ""The Man Who Went Up a Hill and Came Down a Mountain"". Charming movie.  The rest, not so much....",1365724800,,191,4.135135135135135
4713504,4,B005JZBP0A,4 stars cause 3 of the movie where great.. I love the bbc movies  and hugh grant is wonderful..this has nice sences in it and i would buy again...,1364515200,,146,4.0344827586206895
4713505,3,B005JZBP0A,"I gave this collection 3 stars because the films surprised me. I had a hard time between the image I had of Hugh Grant, and with the type of films these were. There was quite a mixture of nudity, sex, fantacy and dark witchcraft in this collection. I prefer the lighter romantic type rolls he has played in other films.",1364083200,3,319,4.333333333333333
4713506,3,B005JZBP0A,"I didn't expect them to be as old as these, but I guess you didn'tsay they were new ones.
Not too bad anyway.",1363651200,,109,3.782608695652174
4713507,3,B005JZBP0A,"I liked two of the movies but it was disappointing in that I thought two of the movies not up to Hugh Grants somewhat humorous, bashful style.  The plots were no great literary writing and were boring.",1362787200,,201,4.4324324324324325
8476201,4,B005JZBP0A,"Good movie/s, good quality control, fair price, and delivered on time",1517097600,,69,5.363636363636363

8476208,5,B005JZBP0A,"Gave this as a stocking stuffer to my wife at Christmas. What can I say, she loves this type of movie. Not my cup of tea. The CD arrived on time & in new condition.",1397865600,,164,3.7142857142857144
8476209,1,B005JZBP0A,that someone doesn't pick Hugh Grant's movies very well. Soft porn in one and largely disappointing plots in the others. Rent them before you buy.,1393804800,2,146,4.88
8476210,5,B005JZBP0A,"What's not to love!  Having all these movies together on one DVD is great!
I watched them in a marathon!",1386720000,,104,4.2
