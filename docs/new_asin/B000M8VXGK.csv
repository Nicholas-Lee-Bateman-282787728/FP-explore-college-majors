8167231,5,B000M8VXGK,"""Part 2"", if you will, covers the ramining field positions, with catcher gary Carter, pitcher Tom seaver, and slugger Mickey Mantle.
Here's another instructional tape for youngsters and oldsters, though the later gtroup may feel a little down realizing they have been playing (here and there) incorrectly for 50 years or so.
A special treat for Mantle fans, as he looks great at age 56.
Very highly recommended.",1314835200,,411,5.0588235294117645
8167232,5,B000M8VXGK,"This VHS tape operates brilliantly on many levels: as an instructional device for kids; as a showcase for the great sports personalities of Mantle, Ford, and Rizzuto; as Baseball history - all three toss in slice of BB-life stories, some very funny. As usual, the humble, working class heros, show that fame has not affected their comradery...or their seriousness, their love for the game.

Getting back to the real reason for the product: to show people who are *not* familiar with these Hall of Famers what to do and what not to do on the field. How to move and avoid injury.

As a longtime fan of the three Instructors, I enjoyed watching them, in 1986, swing, run, throw...again.

Another plus for the ""older"" fan: learning how wrong he/she has played over the years! I thought I knew the correct way to lay down a drag bunt!

I see that the tape goes for about $1.50 on Amazon. Buy 2-3.",1311465600,2,891,4.55
