This documentary examines the early life of the studio focusing on moguls like Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg, stars like Greta Garbo, Lon Chaney, Norma Shearer, Buster Keaton, John Gilbert, Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, Lionel Barrymore, Wallace Beery, and Jean Harlow, and explaining the transition to sound and the preview process used to perfect films.

There are interviews with many major names in Hollywood including stars like Helen Hayes, Lew Ayres, Samuel Marx, Eleanor Boardman, King Vidor, Jackie Cooper, Maureen O'Sullivan, Freddie Bartholomew, and others.

There is an extravagant opener for each installment of this series featuring detailed miniatures which transform into lifesized sets. Patrick Stewart in period costume narrates the film.",1151280000,,928,5.4825174825174825

Patrick Stewart gives his narration in a refreshingly bright and enthusiastic way.... he is clearly excited about the clips and bits of info he is sharing... and the material is pure gold. So many young people think that if a movie is over 2 years old, it is not worth watching. The films represented here will give the babes a taste of what real entertainment was back then... real stories, loads of action and optimism, romance and pure joy. Films are occasionally made like that today, but in the old days, it was the norm, not the exception. This will remind you what entertainment was and the amazing degree of talent a star or even a cameraman must have had to be part of the movies.",1096502400,4,818,4.381578947368421

7826503,5,6302453186,"It is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen.  Tells about how MGM got started to till it decline in the 1980's. Most imformative about MGM stars like Clark Gable, Elizabeth Taylor, Mickey Rooney, Debbie Renyolds, Norma Shearer, Wallace Berry,  Greer Garson, Walter Pidgeon, Esther Williams, and many more stars.  Also, how producers, directors and writers of how they started at MGM.",977184000,4,390,5.158730158730159
7826504,4,6302453186,"This is the first of the 3 part documentary on the MGM studios produced by Ted Turner pictures, hosted by Patrick Stewart who tends to yell his narration to camera. Turner also provides set designs and effects that imitate the MGM brand of kitsch. Part 1 begins in 1924 with the opening of the studio with both Louis B Mayer and Irving Thalberg in charge, and ends with the death of Thalberg in 1936 and Mayer in total control. This period sees triumphs with productions like Ben-Hur (with the experimental two colour technicolour shown here), The Big Parade, Flesh and the Devil, Trador Horn, Grand Hotel, Dinner at Eight, and Mutiny on the Bounty. It also covers the perceived failures of Greed and the end of Erich von Stroheim's career as director, periods where Buster Keaton was dissatisfied with the constraints of the studio and Marion Davies' mentor William Randolph Hearst felt his mistress was being misrepresented, the decline and fall of John Gilbert said to be influenced by Mayer's hatred of the actor, and the scandal over the murder of Jean Harlow's husband Paul Bern. There is also coverage of Mayer's stable of stars including Norma Shearer (who acts appallingly in the scene we see from her Oscar winning The Divorcee), Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, Wallace Beery, and of course, Garbo. The power plays that lead to an lessening of Thalberg's role as head of production, in spite of the industry acknowledgement of him as a genius, are justified by Thalberg's poor health, a reminder that the studio was in business to make money and that no one was indispensable. For the most part, this series is great viewing, offering good prints and interviews with survivors of the titles, but the habit of having an anecdote from one continue over film footage is both annoying and insulting to these people, and when footage from Ben-Hur is projected behind a talking Patrick Stewart it is positively an outrage.",975024000,,1922,4.862804878048781
