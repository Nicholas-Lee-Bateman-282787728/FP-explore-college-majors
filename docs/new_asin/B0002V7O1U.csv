8032172,4,B0002V7O1U,"The second installment in Kinji Fukasaku's The Yakuza Papers series (aka Battles Without Honor & Humanity) is Deadly Fight In Hiroshima (1973). Fukasaka's style is becoming more apparent in this the second of the five part series I am planning on viewing. It has a semi-documentary feel to it as there are freeze frames that provide identification of key players and the deaths or aftermath of skirmishes throughout the film. There is also a lot of violence. They scenes often seem chaotic to me, I often wonder how much of the action sequences are scripted.  This film is essentially the story of a single soldier in the yakuza forces, Yamanaka (Kin'ya Kitaoji) who becomes the tool of the bosses and is manipulated and exploited before he eventually kills himself when backed in a corner. Yamanaka is friendly with Hirano (Bunta Sugawa) a holdover from the first film who diplomatically tries to navigate the underworld when two families go to war without being forced to choose a side. Sonny Chiba is great as the over-the-top loose cannon Katsutoshi of the Ono family. Unfortunately, Chiba will not be in the next installment as he gets his comeuppance in this film.",1388620800,,1170,4.909090909090909
