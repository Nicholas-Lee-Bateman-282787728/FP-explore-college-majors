7902268,4,6302037662,This vhs was put out in 1982 by the My Company. On the back description is a flaw it says there is a bonus program included but its a lie cause its not on there. Sometimes versions like this  happened in vhs manufacturing without barcodes for some reason? Maybe cause they were on a time schedule and had too release them unfinished without the bonus footage? Anyway i thought is was funny the boy being a redhead in the story cause he reminded me of every redhead i have ever encountered  with such self-confidence issues and sissy attitudes towards standing up for ones self even in the face of adults. Redheaded children are genetically flawed predisposed to psychosis and there is no wonder the kid had no friends in the story redheads are creepy to be around they just are thats not an opinion its a fact. I don't remember seeing this as a child or pete's dragon but i remember the song and the dragon picture. Add this to your 80s cartoon collection if you like.,1394582400,,968,4.463276836158192
