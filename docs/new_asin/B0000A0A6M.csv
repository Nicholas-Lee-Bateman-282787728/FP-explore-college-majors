I am a beginner in acquiring information about wine and found this to be a great introduction. It was not insulting to me at all. It is understandable and I appreciate the visual representations.  I also appreciate the comfortable style used by the host and other guests in presenting the information. The information mirrors much of what I have read in books and magazines.  I like the tips provided.  I wish that I could download recipes, and other from the DVD.",1199577600,,572,4.578431372549019

It is so overly simplistic that it's insulting and obvious that it is the result of someone's desire to travel, take nice local video shots, get paid and write it all off. The ego's from chefs to sommeliers to the useless woman who is your ""guide"" through Quick Tips to ordering wines -  they really don't have much to say and it all detracts from much of what you really want to know that it is annoying at best. The glossary is a joke and should not be allowed to be included as an extra feature, and the quick tips for ordering wine is as useful as an ashtray on a motorcycle. There are no real guidelines here - just repetitve suggestions without any explanation as to why certain wines work with certain foods. It's a shame that Tim Hanni MW,  lent his name and credibility to this project! Oh yes - the DVD ROM feature also does not work - it just flashes up a screen repeating that you need a DVD ROM drive to use these features - funny enough - that's exactly what I viewed this DVD on.
If you are looking for a wine-related DVD that has real information, but is not quite so ""nice, and oooh - look - they're in Burgundy today..."" find a used copy of OZ Clarks DVD - it's hard to find now but blows this useless silver platter off the map!",1075507200,29,1280,4.157258064516129
7994828,5,B0000A0A6M,"I ordered this DVD a bit suspiciously because I didn't know nothing about who made it and I had disappointments before about life style/educational DVDs. Many times such DVDs can be unprofessional and amateur like. However, this one was an excellent surprise. It delivered exactly what I wanted: solid basic advice from experts filmed in relevant and appealing locations. There is a narrator, with whom the viewer can identify because he doesn't know much about wine, but he goes on an expedition asking the right questions to experts. A Wine Master, a Wine spectator Wine Maker of the year, Chefs, owners of wine stores, etc. These people explain in a non-overwhelming way the types and sub-types of wine, the categories, the labels, the common terms, how to taste wine (filmed in detail). It is also full of practical advice including advice from restaurant owners about how to order wine in a restaurant, how to choose it in a wine store, most common terms to describe wine to your friends, etc. There are plenty of Italians and French talking about their wines. The locations include restaurants, vyneards, and wine stores. It will be a good use of money if you want to know the fundamentals and have solid advice without being overwhelmed with information. After viewing this DVD I went to a wine tasting event to test my knowledge amidst professionals /long-term wine lovers, and felt very happy about the amount of knowledge I was able to acquire just by watching a simple DVD.",1062201600,,1484,4.869565217391305
