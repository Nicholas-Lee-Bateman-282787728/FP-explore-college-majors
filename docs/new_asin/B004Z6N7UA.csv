4506286,5,B004Z6N7UA,"Justice League, Justice League Unlimited, and the Animated Batman and Superman series are still better, but that's because I'm old school. Young Justice is great but it won't succeed the past. It's worth watching and buying I'd say. I'll probably buy in the full collection.",1309651200,3,274,5.111111111111111
4506287,4,B004Z6N7UA,"I can see reviewer A. DiSanto's rationale. Like most folks here, at first I was rankled by the fact that WB isn't giving us the whole season, but he's kind of right. I didn't mind buying Batman: Brave and the Bold as two purchases and, yeah, they pretty much end up going in a DVD flipcase anyhow, instead of staying in the boxes, so why the heck not? I'll pay $9.99 for the first half, then again for the second half. This series is just too brilliant to not have in my collection.

In fact, I'm really happy WB VP of Creative Affairs, Sam Register, enlisted Brandon Vietti to co-head up this production with Greg Weisman, since Vietti was such a driving force behind my favorite DC animated film, Batman: Under the Red Hood. You can see his work carrying over to Young Justice. Huge bonus that they signed Bruce Greenwood to voice Batman in Young Justice after his brilliant Batman in ""Under the Red Hood.""

The animation, effects, pacing of the story, casting, characters used for the team...all of it is FIVE STARS for me. I had higher expectations for The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, but ended up loving Young Justice much more. So, even though, yes, I'd prefer a collected full season, I just feel bad slamming a one-star rating on this because of that. Instead, I'm going to show my appreciation to everyone involved on the creative end and go four stars.",1309046400,5,1370,4.587755102040816
4506288,4,B004Z6N7UA,"Great show -- the handling of Superboy is especially well-done.  The animation is a little bland, but it's very much in keeping with the style of the DC Universe DVD movies.  More important, releasing these a half season at a time is perfectly reasonable, and a perfect way for many people to afford these DVD collections.  Not everyone can afford to drop 30 bucks in one pop for a full season.  This way I pay for half the season, then get the second half when I have the money.  I did this with the first season of The Brave and the Bold, and it worked out perfectly.  Folks should lighten up.  Either way, you're getting the full season on four disks, so who cares how many boxes they're in?",1309046400,5,694,4.333333333333333
4506289,2,B004Z6N7UA,"I love this series, as I think this is the best DC Comics animated series to date; includes a wide range of DCU characters (Zatara and Captain Atom as part of the JLA!); and the series has the freedom to re-imagine and/or redesign DCU characters.

I give this review two stars, as I think this DVD release is horrible!  Where are the DVD extras?  Why couldn't you include all of the pre-launch interviews?  Why aren't there any episode commentaries?  Why can't you include the Flaming C clips?  How about including character designs?  Couldn't you have gotten permission to include the Happy Meals commercial?

I think this DVD release is redundant, as I have already bought these episodes from WB's online store.  The digital downloads are DVD quality or better and are divided up into individual episodes already.

If this DVD release doesn't sell well, I think that WB should blame themselves for not including extras that drives a lot of DVD purchases.

Now if Young Justice gets released on Blu-ray, then that's an entirely different story.",1308787200,6,1045,4.880681818181818
4506290,1,B004Z6N7UA,"I refuse to buy this because it is ""not"" a complete season.  The WB should be ashamed of themselves for half assing the fans like this!!!!",1308700800,9,138,4.3076923076923075
4506291,1,B004Z6N7UA,"I would rate the series Young Justice 4 stars, but like Batman: TAS, Superman, and Justice League the decision to first release volumes of seasons is just a money grab. Wait a year or two and get entire season for about the same price. Or if you wait 3-5, wait until the series is completed and get the complete series on Blu-Ray and get more extras for a cheaper per season cost than buying each release every year.
  If you can't wait buy now, but beware this will eventually be either part of a complete series set or a complete season set for a cheaper per disc cost.",1307404800,8,571,4.277777777777778
4506292,1,B004Z6N7UA,"Young Justice WB has to be the most money hungry company out there they sell partial series then come out with full series and their prices are outragous this is the main reason I wanted to be removed from the web site, they just do not get it, economy is tough money is tight and they just seem to not care.",1306454400,10,308,4.065573770491803
4506293,3,B004Z6N7UA,"I have been watching this as it's been coming out and I was pleasantly surprised at how good the storys were.  The personalities are an interesting mix and ""real"" problems are being addressed in a measured and responsible manner.

So on the whole I'd call ""Young Justice"" a reasonably good follow-on to the recent line of successful WB/DC Animated Series (Batman, Superman, Justice League, etc) the problem is that this is ""V. 1""

They tried this with the Justice League and it didn't work.

Guys, guys, GUYS!  FULL SEASONS!  A reasonable price point (say $30.00) and the ENTIRE SEASON in one set.

This is not hard to understand, so why don't you?",1306022400,130,648,4.732142857142857
4506304,1,B004Z6N7UA,"Please do not buy this DVD! I hate the way producion/marketing executives try to milk consumers for every cent by putting out several editions/partial collections of a ""season"" and then releasing the complete season a year later. Don't encourage this kind of marketing! Consumers don't want to pay [what usually amounts to] double price for something, but that is just what happens when people buy these seasons, broken up into several, single-disc releases. We want complete season releases! Night-time drama shows are not broken down into several separate releases. Why do this with shows for children? Do they think we're stupid? Don't prove them right by buying this SINGLE DVD!

Yes, this show is pretty good. It is well-written, has good animation, and the voice acting is also well-done. Still, when it's offered in such a small dose for such a high price, the whole thing just stinks. Get it right WB!",1320710400,10,909,4.980263157894737
4506305,1,B004Z6N7UA,"This DVD contains only four 23-minute episodes, which, as far as I'm concerned, means it's not worth the money. If you buy these DVDs individually, rather than wait for the release of the full season, you'll end up paying nearly double the overall cost. What the studio is doing, as they've done with their other animated shows, is unconscionable and unjustifiable, and I strongly recommend that you not give them your money until they release the full season.

If I were to rate the content rather than the studio greed, I would give this release 3.5 stars. The team isn't yet complete (Artemis hasn't joined) and I don't think the writers were fully comfortable with the characters and the interactions. You can see the broad outlines but they're a little too one-note: Superboy is angry and withdrawn, Robin is brash and cocky, Kid Flash is reckless and unthinking, etc. It's still worth watching these to get the background, as the season gets better as the writers get more comfortable with where they are going.

If you want to view the content now rather than wait, do what I did and rent it or stream it.",1319932800,6,1112,4.697435897435898
4506306,1,B004Z6N7UA,"I like just about all things from the DC Comics world, and Young Justice is an excellent series worthy to be watched and enjoyed.  It's a new and original twist for the ""sidekicks"".  They have great episodes and dialogue.  I'm pleased with the animation and artwork, too.  The thing that irks me to no end is the way Warner is selling this series.  There are sixteen (16) episodes in the first season.  Warner is releasing them only four (4) episodes at a time at a cost of $10 to $13 depending on where you buy them.  The complete season one will cost $40 to $52 this way.  My personal opinion is not to buy it piecemeal but write Warner and insist on having them release each COMPLETE season for $25 to $29.  I'm sure they'd make many more sales with many more satisfied customers.  Wait, I just remembered something - it takes BRAINS to figure that out!  Wow, what a concept!  The series is worth five stars in my book, but I gave the rating one star for the the way Warner is mistreating its fans and customer base.",1319500800,6,1019,4.333333333333333
4506307,5,B004Z6N7UA,This is a very cool show and I couldn't wait to get it on DVD! It teaches you values and life lessions but it is also full of action and adventure! I love it!,1317513600,,158,3.676470588235294
4506308,2,B004Z6N7UA,"Let me start by saying Warner Bros. is downright evil for releasing this set. Only 9-10 episodes of this series exist so there is no excuse for them not to release at least 9 on this set. I wish the WB would stop ripping us off, but they've been pulling this crap for years, and I don't see them stopping anytime soon.

Personally, I don't like this series. The ""teenager"" portion of the show overwhelms the note worthy action, and completely strangles what little plot development this series has. That is my personal opinion though. I want to like it, but there isn't enought here. There are too many amazing DC shows out there for me to recommend this series, and those shows have much more substantial dvd release for me to recommend this set.

If you have to have teenage angst doused all over your super heroes, than this is your show. Everyone else should pick up Justice League, or Batman the brave and the bold.",1316390400,6,920,4.502994011976048
4506309,5,B004Z6N7UA,"Whilst the production value of the series was good, the stories were uneven as the conceit of an overarching nemesis for the juior Justice Leaguers was not clearly defined. Not sure if this is caused by the manner in which the serialisation is taking place. Anyway was only four stories so utimately unsatisfying, despite being promising.",1316044800,2,338,5.053571428571429
4506310,2,B004Z6N7UA,"Of course they put them out in piece like this...they make more money this way.  Most fans buy them piecemeal, and then in whole sets.  And mostly, this release schedule is to catch parents in stores like Target and Best Buy, not for collectors.  When little Johnny wants to put a cartoon in the cart, mom is much more likely to pay 10 bucks rather than 30.  Once they feel they've tapped that market, THEN they put out the full set, sometimes on Bluray, so they can get YOUR money.  These guys are marketing geniuses with JOBS for a reason.  They know how to exploit you and I to make money.",1315094400,8,592,4.288288288288288

The Series

Like I said, ""Young Justice"" is good. It isn't great. I don't like it as much as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Teen-Titans/dp/B000CEXFZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Teen Titans</a>, which was tons of fun, mixed classic Titans stories with wacky hijinks, and had its own style and identity. I don't like it as much as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Justice-League/dp/B003L7DK88/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Justice League</a>, which to my mind is the greatest DC animated series ever made.

""Young Justice"" has a promising start, and I suspect it needs some time to flesh out its characters and its series. Supposedly, ""Young Justice"" has been renewed for a Season Two next year, which is a good thing.

""Young Justice"" is firmly set in the DC Universe (Earth-16 for the uber-geek), although in an emo-teen-angsty corner of it. The Justice League makes regular appearances, with Red Tornado and Batman being the most active. Cadmus is set up as the main villain, along with a decent rogue's gallery like Kobra, Blockbuster, Bane, and Sportsmaster. I liked the nod to Mister Twister as well, the villain who battled the original Teen Titans from the 1960s.

The series starts when the sidekicks Speedy, Robin, and Kid Flash get sick of being seated at the kid's table and storm off in a huff to form their own supergroup. Speedy decides he is too cool to be part of a junior Justice League, but Robin and Kid Flash pick up a new member in the new Aqualad. They soon break into Cadmus and accidently rescue the Superboy-clone, and then the Martian Manhunter drops off his niece and prot&eacute;g&eacute; Miss Martian to join the team.

The team has a different dynamic than what I am used to. Instead of being the in-control, calm-headed, raised-by-Batman-natural leader, Robin is the epitome of a whinging teenage jerk who thinks he is cooler than he is. I am used to Robin being the steadying point of any teen group, so it was odd to see this little upstart punk who rarely looks before he leaps, and gets the team into more trouble than he solves. Even his voice has a nasal whine to it, reminiscent of Casey Casum's classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Friends/dp/B002S3Y1LQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Friends!</a>&nbsp;Robin.

Instead, both Superboy and Aqualad (Not the classic one - This one has some sort of Green Lantern-inspired omni-power using water constructs) are the mature members of the team who think of planning and caution. Kid Flash is typically the comic relief; a stereotypical hothead speedster.

I am not sure yet what I think of this role-mixing, but it was nice of the series creators to try something different. You can almost imagine them sitting around a planning session and saying ""Hey! What if Robin was the immature, annoying one?""

Miss Martian is an intriguing character, because I know so little of her from the comics. She has good potential, but I was disappointed that the prominent female member of the team, even though she is incredibly powerful, is played as such a ""pretty airhead""-type. She mainly serves as a romantic-triangle foil, with Kid Flash making mooney-eyes at her while she goes for the strong and silent Superboy. The other female character, Artemis, does not appear on this DVD and debuts later in the series, so I don't know how that dynamic will change.

The DVD

Four episodes? Seriously? That's all you are going to give us, Warner Bros? Out of a ten-episode Season One, you thought it was a good idea to split off the first four episodes into ""Season One, Volume One?"" What are you going to do with the remaining six episodes? Put out another ""Season One, Volume Two"" boxset then a 2-episode bonus disk?

Whatever. We all know that eventually, ""Young Justice"" will be collected into an actual Season One collection, and for less money. My advice would be don't buy this. Vote with your dollar, and don't support this kind of studio nickel-and-diming of their series. Be patient, save your money, and pick up the REAL release when it comes out.

Because it will.",1314144000,8,4377,5.191489361702128
4506313,5,B004Z6N7UA,"I've watched this series and recently went back to the old justice league...

****Spoilers****

I've noticed the story doesn't fit too well with each other. Prince Orin in this is someone that didn't betray Aqua Man and is a good person, while in the old justice league, he betray the king and assumed dead early on. Also, Amazo took the league 4 hours to beat but these guys beat it pretty fast.

**** End Spoilers****

But, it's not bad at all. It's an incredibly fun watch, and story consistency isn't exactly what you care excessively about when you watch these tv adaptations anyway.

I guess the only really bad thing aside from character consistency is that there's no Kevin Conroy, instead Bruce Greenwood voices Batman, which isn't horrible though you do hear him rasping at times that sounds bad.",1314057600,,806,4.76978417266187

4506325,5,B004Z6N7UA,I enjoyed the DVD very much as I generally do anything by DC COMICS (WARNER BROTHERS). Although this product is for teenagers it was pretty close to the the comic book. I would recommend it to anyone who collects DC COMICS.,1313452800,,223,4.463414634146342
