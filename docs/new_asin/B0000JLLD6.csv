8002455,2,B0000JLLD6,"Stan ""the Man"" Longinidis was, by most accounts, one of the best kickboxers in the world, exceling in virtually all disciplines and winning thirteen heavyweight championships. In the early '90s, he teased a film career via a few small roles in small martial arts movies, but disappeared from film following Don Wilson's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodfist-III-Forced-to-Fight/dp/630582472X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodfist III: Forced to Fight</a>. A full ten years later, he resurfaced in an independent Australian feature that almost nobody saw and even fewer liked, judging by online ratings. It beats the heck out of me worse than one of Stan's haymakers why he chose this queer little movie to have a final go at celluloid, but at any rate, it makes for a (mostly) interesting study in seat-of-the-pants action comedy.

The story: when a hapless, small-time bag man (Arthur Angel, bit player in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Voyage-of-the-Dawn-Treader/dp/B004M1A21K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Voyage of the Dawn Treader</a>) rats out a local mob boss (Henry Maas, ""Dogstar""), he needs to rely on his kickboxing cousin (Longinidis) to keep him alive and deliver him to court.

The whole time I was watching the film, I couldn't help but think of what Quentin Tarantino would have done with it, were he the director. The picture is a poorly-stitched patchwork of strange ideas (e.g. the mob decides they want to castrate Arthur Angel's tattooed genitals), vaguely surreal imagery (Longinidis drives a naked Angel around on his motorcycle), and head-scratching situations (the skinhead house scene) that are weird by default but could be considered entertaining if wrangled by someone who knew his craft a bit more than short film producer Salik Silverstein. There's nothing really wrong with ""Kick to the Head,"" save for a bit of weak CGI and a bit too much scatological humor, but it feels disjointed and sort of joyless - like all of these strange aspects were tossed onto the screen without a thought to context. Some of the characters are just plain boring, but weirdoes like the ones played by Longinidis, Angel, and the enigmatic assassin played by Filipino cult star Roland Dantes (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angelfist/dp/B00006II6C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angelfist</a>) help make up for them.

The only other Australian action-comedy I've ever seen is Richard Norton's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Under-the-Gun/dp/B0000A02VX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Under the Gun</a>, and while that one was weird as heck as well, it at least featured some neat martial arts scenes to draw me in, but ""Kick to the Head"" doesn't really have these, either. Stan is treated more as an actor than a martial artist, to the point that his handful of fights are mere afterthoughts. He has a quick brawl in a Turkish diner that's not fantastic, a quicker exchange with a muscular thug that's even less fantastic, and a finale with Roland Dantes. This final showdown isn't filmed very well and it's not very flashy, but it is arguably well-choreographed: Dantes, a real-life practitioner of escrima, doesn't match Stan well physically but keeps the fight interesting by repeatedly breaking out hidden or improved weapons and attacking his opponent's wounds. It doesn't save the movie, but it was nice to see a bit of the film's creativity working out near the end.

The DVD cover doesn't relay what a weird film this is, but hopefully it won't matter for Longinidis fans, since this is the only substantial way to view their hero outside of the ring. Everyone else ought to tread carefully, though, and not expect anything fantastic out of this one.",1339200000,,3837,5.738137082601054
