8706557,4,B00UGQ6M9G,"Dentist Painless Potter has a history of getting run out of town for incompetence. Calamity Jane is on a government mission to identify those smuggling guns to the Indians and chooses Painless as a patsy to pose as her husband in the wagon train west. This film is a good comedy featuring Bob Hope in his typical role as a bumbler who always comes out on top. Fast-paced with truly funny bits, this is a comedy well worth watching.",1500681600,,431,4.468354430379747
