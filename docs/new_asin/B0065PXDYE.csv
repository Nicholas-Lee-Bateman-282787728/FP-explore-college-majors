4961302,1,B0065PXDYE,Husband bought these for me as a Christmas present 2014 off my wish list.  Broke the left pedal July 8th 2015.  Bolt has filler and is weak inside.,1436400000,,147,4.214285714285714

4961307,5,B0065PXDYE,Love the pedals! I have cycling shoes with clips my significant other doesn't so it works for both of us to use our home spin bike!,1418169600,5,131,4.076923076923077
4961308,5,B0065PXDYE,Needed SPD with straps on the other side so I can use my spin shoes and the rest of the family can strap in when they want. Pricey but excellent quality. Easy to install.,1388275200,6,170,4.029411764705882
8493497,5,B0065PXDYE,Excellent and awesome pedals. Purchased for a Spinning bike as the old pedals were so worn and rusted. These are a marked improvement and work perfectly for my performance on the Spinning bike. Really like them!,1527120000,,211,4.888888888888889
8493498,5,B0065PXDYE,Perfect !!! I now have the Best of Both Worlds as they say.,1502928000,,59,3.6153846153846154
8493499,5,B0065PXDYE,"I bought these as a replacement for the pedals for my Sole SB700. That spin bike didn't come with clips and I wanted a pair that would allow me to wear both cleats and regular shoes (depending on whether I wanted to do a high-intensity workout or just some light pedaling while watching TV.) These not only had the clips but also better straps. On the original pair that came with the bike I had to tighten the straps every 5-10 minutes, with these it's every 20 minutes or so, which is nice.",1494028800,,492,4.301075268817204
8493500,5,B0065PXDYE,Great pedals. they fit perfectly in my Spinner Sport bike that I bought in 2006. Still going strong!,1489881600,,100,4.611111111111111
8493501,5,B0065PXDYE,"Exactly as listed, no issues with shipping or product quality.  quick install with no issues.  Solid product.  placed on my Marcy Club Revolution Stationary Cycle Trainer  with some Giro bike shoes.  Works perfectly.",1489449600,,216,5.424242424242424
8493502,4,B0065PXDYE,"Looks to be good quality, but have not used them yet.",1487894400,,53,3.909090909090909
8493503,3,B0065PXDYE,way overpriced. the $2000 spin bike I bought only comes with non-caged pedals. Paying $90 for toe cages is ridiculous but necessary so more than one person in my house can use it. I also had to hire someone to remove the original pedal as the hex key stripped out for one pedal's removal.,1475798400,,288,4.351851851851852
8493504,1,B0065PXDYE,I purchased these pedals with the sunny health & fitness bike (shown as frequently bought together items) because the sunny health and fitness bike did not come with clip in pedals. These pedals do not fit the bike. super disappointing and a waste of time. Will be returning.,1462406400,3,275,4.75
8493505,5,B0065PXDYE,They are  working well with my spin bike.,1444176000,,41,4.125
8493506,5,B0065PXDYE,"I inherited an old Johnny G spinner bike from my Mom a few years back.  My dad got the bike in 1998 or 1999 (I believe).

One day I broke one of the pedals; it snapped off.  I worried about not being able to find a replacement, but these Spinner NXT fit on perfectly even though they are a different brand.  They are comfortable, and the straps work so much easier to hold my athletic shoe in place.  I have not used the other side of the pedals for those shoes that lock in place, so I can't comment on that side.  But the straps and pedals themselves are fantastic.",1438300800,,567,4.109090909090909
