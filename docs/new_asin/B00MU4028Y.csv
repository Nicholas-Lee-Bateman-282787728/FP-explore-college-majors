6601883,5,B00MU4028Y,"Maya was a fabulous short-lived television series that ran from September 16, 1967 through February 10, 1968.  Filmed entirely on location in India, the 18 episodes are filled with action, intrigue and heart-warming stories.  The impressive cinematography captures beautiful Indian scenery and landscapes.  The suberb music was by famed film composer Hans J. Salter, a score the composer was proud of.  Excellent lead actors Jay North, Sajid Khan and of course ""Maya"" the elephant, will bring joy to the viewer, whom after seeing the series, will wish that there had been many more episodes filmed.",1434240000,3,598,5.2631578947368425

6601885,5,B00MU4028Y,"This series was on when I was young, and I remember enjoying it a great deal.  I purchased it for the children in my life and have found that they are as mesmerized by the elephants and locations as I was.  The stories are sort of 1960s, but there is little violence and no profanity.  The characters are ones that children can identify with.  I think that the Johnny Quest animated series is a take-off from Maya, which was often filmed on location in Ceylon, India and other tropical locals.  I'm sure the animated series was far cheaper to make.",1425600000,3,548,4.44
6601886,5,B00MU4028Y,Great series. Filmed in India was a great plus for the series. Stunning locations.  I was amazed how much  Jay North had changed in appearence (and grown up) from his Dennis the Menace series which was just a few years apart.  Well done. Very happy with the DVD set.  Too bad it only lasted one season.,1416960000,9,302,4.339285714285714
6601887,5,B00MU4028Y,I haven't seen this show since 1967. But it is still as good today as it was then. Very enjoyable and highly recommended.,1414281600,9,121,4.304347826086956
6601888,4,B00MU4028Y,"Last time I saw Dennis he was getting into mischief as a kid, so I was kind of surprised to see him so much older. Seems like a pretty good show, with him instead getting into perilous situations. Should have brought his slingshot. It's an MOD just like it says because apparently there's not enough interest, so this is all they'll make. I just wanted to watch it for fun anyways, this is something for people who enjoy old shows like me.  North's face is a little pink, but it does not really distract from the show.  It's kind of cool that it was shot on location, the native performers are interesting.",1412726400,8,606,4.401785714285714
8674597,5,B00MU4028Y,"I vaguely remember watching this during the NBC Fall 1967 season. After recently viewing several episodes, it is starting to come back to me... why I liked it so much as a child. It is kind of like ""Route 66"" only with boys, an elephant and India as a backdrop. Lots of action and good storylines. Kudos to MGM for filming on location and using many native actors. It does seem strange now that almost everyone in India in 1967 seemed to speak English.",1532131200,,452,4.392857142857143
8674598,2,B00MU4028Y,The DVD's in the series don't play. In fact Disc #4 froze my DVD player. I would like to know how to exchange it for a working set.,1523404800,,131,3.7142857142857144
8674599,5,B00MU4028Y,"What a great way to go back to 1967... I loved the series then, and this DVD set did not disappoint.  I enjoyed every episode and it brought back great memories of good times with family watching this show.  It has great quality and clear picture and sound.  Worth the purchase price.",1507593600,,284,4.423076923076923
8674600,5,B00MU4028Y,"It took three tries (including two from Amazon) purchasing this series due to poor quality dvds, but this set arrived in perfect condition. I watched this series as a youngster when I was the same age as Jay North and Sajid Kahn. I recently remembered it and was delighted to find it available on DVD. This is a great adventure series, full of exotic locales teaming with bad guys, both human and animal. The series utilized local Indian actors, who were not exactly Emmy nominees; but their presence adds to the authenticity of the scripts. The acting isn't that good; the scripts are hokey.  Still, I enjoyed seeing this series again. Maya, the elephant, becomes a real star, especially when she charges in at a villain or stomps on a threatening cobra. Best of all, the series exhibits a respect for the local culture, something which I probably didn't appreciate so much as a kid. I recommend buying this series. Watch it with your kids. This is the way true tv adventure series used to be.",1487030400,,994,4.6477272727272725
