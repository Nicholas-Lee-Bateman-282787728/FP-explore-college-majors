7881056,5,6304968140,I purchased an NTSC copy of this video from Erle Montaigue in the mid ninties obviously to use it in australia i had to convert it to pal which i did. the quality was what you would expect from a vhs compact camera or 8 mm which was the standard of the time{not everyone could afford betacam  sp}  on an academic level erle certainly knows what he is talking about. his ability to explain in both a scientific and spiritual way the art and application of dim mak is excellent. i also have his encyclopedias and other books .  if you are genuinly interested in dim mak this is a must video for your collection . learn more about erle at ...  congratulations ERLE MONTAIGUE,1047859200,5,671,4.344
7881057,1,6304968140,"I'm not sure what the other reviewers were thinking when they reviewed this video, but they obviously left quality out of the picture.  The ""Secrets of Dim Mak"" was obviously made with someone's personal camcorder by a very amateur videographer.  The sound quality is so poor that the viewer will need to turn their volume all the way up just to understand what's being said.  Random images are edited into the video and offer no significant contribution to the message.  In demonstrating some of the moves, both Montaigue and his partner disappear from the screen, leaving the viewer even less knowledgeable about the impact of the moves.
I don't doubt, in the least, that Erle Montaigue knows his stuff (I own his Dim Mak Encyclopaedia), but he should've invested more into the production of this video.",972950400,16,805,4.897058823529412
