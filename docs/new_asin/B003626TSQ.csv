I actually expected a little more from the documentary but it's still pretty cool even though it's fairly short. It shows the process of these 4 ""masters"" rummaging through old records at secondhand stores buying 5 with 5 dollars and taking them home to remix that which they picked up. I'm sure a majority of people looking at this documentary know who the producers/DJ's/Mix Masters are or they wouldn't be looking at this documentary. The mixes from the 4 producers are the gem here. It's cool to see the process but the finished product is really interesting music. Their efforts were successful in my opinion and there's more than 4 songs like in the Documentary on the CD. It's hard to look him up but my favorite is DJ ""Nobody"", he looks like a caveman but he mixes like a master. The CD that comes in this bundle makes it worth buying the whole shabangabang. Better than a lot of current music out there, at least more creative.

The biggest problem that really bugged me (but keep in mind this is just my review; this may just be with my DVD) was that right in the beginning of the movie it freezes up and doesn't play. I've tried it on multiple DVD players and it freezes up so I finally just decided to skip passed that part, that scene, and it works out but you don't get to see the intro so that kinda sucks. Once again this was a problem with my DVD not automatically all of them so consider that. I don't know if anyone else noticed it or cared or if it even happened so just buy it. If I still had to buy it I would, I just wish I didn't have to trick my DVD into playing.",1324598400,,1669,4.231974921630094

Would have liked more footage of the actual production of each tune.",1281484800,,243,4.377777777777778

8389399,5,B003626TSQ,"The premise is simple; $5 to get 5 records and make a beat. This challenge was given to Daedelus, Ras G, Nobody, and J.Rocc.  What was special about this movie/documentary was that in watching these beat makers shop, chop, and play with sounds, they expose very tender and unique parts of their soul.  Their was no favorite amoungst the bunch. They all had something to bring to the table.  If they can make $5 beats sound that good, give these cats a Bad Boy record Deal!",1268870400,,472,4.465116279069767
