8365693,5,B002DPPH9O,The video quality is clear and the content is educational. I bought a used one but it looks like new lucky with cheaper price. Hope other buyers would also consider the used one.,1363305600,,178,4.424242424242424
8365694,2,B002DPPH9O,"I bought this set based on the reviews I read on the site, here, on Amazon.com. I guess I was so eager to watch more nature documentaries after viewing all the BBC stuff..(Planet Earth, Life, and others) . I also watched Great Migrations, a recent NatGeo production and release. I thought, wow, I will get this set for more viewing thrills, even though the reviews I read here hinted that the video was not as good as the BBC stuff but still left the impression that at the very least it was good.
In my humble opinion, this set is way overpriced at around $ 70 if you factor in tax and shipping. Problem is there is no way you can tell how bad or good video is without watching and opening the package. I watched all six discs in the set. I honestly felt I was watching DVD quality material. The material itself seems to have been put together with no rhyme or reason.there was no particular theme to the pack. The claim that this was high definition, was laughable. The extras were all in Standard definition and looked bad when projected on a small screen. Really, let's face it, the BBC really knows how to put a set together.  As I said earlier, Great Migrations a NatGeo recent release was excellent with Great video and  very nice coherent themes. The narration was top notch.
This release (Nat Geo. Ultimate High Def. Collection) was very disappointing to me. I really regret buying it. Oh well, I can always use the pack as a bookend or a paper weight.",1320883200,14,1461,4.4275092936802976
8365695,5,B002DPPH9O,"As the other reviewers say, this ain't Planet Earth. In fact the narration is downright annoying. HOWEVER! The last disk in this set is worth the price of the whole thing. It's a solid 90 minutes of uninterrupted computer generated space fly-bys. Pick your favorite Pink Floyd album and turn the sound off on the TV and you have yourself the makings of a psych-o-delic spectacle that will burn brain cells faster than you can stop and count them. Fly by bizarre planets covered with seas of gas, the crab nebula, and trippy slit screen 2001 effects! All without leaving the comfort of your own couch.",1293580800,4,600,4.669811320754717
8365696,4,B002DPPH9O,"This set isn't as fascinating as Planet Earth (5 stars) and it's strange that the animals have names.  Otherwise, very educational and entertaining.",1292889600,,148,5.434782608695652
8365697,5,B002DPPH9O,"I am from Malaysia and purchased this title from Amazon direct shipped to my corridor. The audio and video quality is awesome!! best blu-ray i ever seen so far.
Fully recommended to those like national geographic. This is the title you should definitely have for your pleasure watching!
Furthermore, Amazon services is the best i had so far.",1289520000,,341,4.896551724137931
8365698,4,B002DPPH9O,"Never regret to own this wonderful Nat-Geo package...jus don't compare with Planet Earth, then u will enjoy !",1282521600,,109,5.111111111111111
8365699,4,B002DPPH9O,"It is hard to compare this set of documentaries to Planet Earth because the film makers did not intend for these films to be another or type of Planet Earth. They did not have the time or funds to create a look at the entire world that Planet Earth does and I doubt they wanted their pictures to be compared to Planet Earth. Instead we have here a classic cross section of National Geographic documentaries with superb picture and sound that should thrill any family to own. Some inclusions weaker than others, this is a great set on blu-ray for less than $10 a film.",1257984000,21,567,4.40952380952381
8365700,3,B002DPPH9O,"This is a nice set, but not up to the standard set by Planet Earth.  The imagery on Planet Earth was absolutely stunning, the best examples of 25 years of footage. The story lines on this set were OK and the imagery OK, but for National Geographic I expected more.",1257984000,12,264,4.28
8365701,2,B002DPPH9O,"This set is basically a rehash of prior NatGeo documentaries. I had seen some of these before, such as Relentless Enemies and Kingdom of the Blue Whale. While good, they're not great - and certainly not up to the groundbreaking standards set by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth/dp/B000MR9D5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth</a>&nbsp;and the folks at BBC. They tend to provide overly dramatic storylines for the animals and focus far too much on the human researchers. The fact that this is mixed with with documentaries on things ranging from astronomy and sports makes it difficult to recommend this set as a gift for anybody, except perhaps a diehard NatGeo junkie.",1257984000,92,730,6.028846153846154
