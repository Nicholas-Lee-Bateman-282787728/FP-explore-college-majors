Whatever you are reviewing is certainly NOT Hero, starring Jet Li and directed by China's brilliant Yimou Zhang.  Hero is one of the great Chinese art films to come out of the late 20th Century.  It is stunningly beautiful to watch; my favorite film of all time, in fact.",1515888000,,440,4.972602739726027
8370314,5,B002HFWB2G,"Without a doubt, the most beautiful Wu-Shi film I have ever seen. In addition to its amazing visuals, it also tells a story about getting to the truth, and does so on many different levels. A must-see.",1468886400,2,201,4.45945945945946
8370315,5,B002HFWB2G,"Absolutely incredible. Stunt-work was beautiful, music was beautiful, scenery was beautiful, and the story was refreshing and full of winding material. More than just an action movie.",1455494400,2,183,5.814814814814815
8370316,3,B002HFWB2G,"uneven pacing and quality, but hey, what else when you run through three leading ladies before hitting the airwaves or whatever?? This is not for everyone. In fact, given the right- on presentation of S. Korean problems with corruption, media and internet manipulation,illegitimacy, trashing of neighborhoods in the name of ""redevelopment"" and ""economic progress"" this series was probably too close to the bone for most Koreans to watch.( How about a murderous crook running for president of the country? Or a suicide attempt secondary to internet persecution?) Comic moments,especially at the opening of episode 1.didn't quite fit with the overall serious tone.  The director still has a lot to learn. about this uniquely Korean skill.. Plus it was aired near the winter holidays, MBC made itself unpopular by canceling a series to get this one out,thus it's low ratings. Sort of a CW style drama without vampires, a tad of Saturday Night Live,and If anyone is interested,  a conventional K-drama style romance. Where have I seen Baek Sun-shik before?? "" The censored "" President's Last Bang"" and the off beat ""Save the Green Planet.""This is right up his alley. LJK's acting keeps your attention when he has a script to work with. Yoon So-Yi, the third leading lady was really great. Much more connection between her and Junki than he has had with any other leading lady. Like to see them in a Hitchcockian caper thriller some day. ??LJK Korea's Cary Grant?? Best episodes start with episode 6, though you need to get through episode one to sort out ALL the characters and plot lines. Unlike most US TV dramas, there are close family and friend relationships An endearing quality of K-drama. Not the best K-drama but not the worst either.",1299283200,2,1739,4.972508591065292
