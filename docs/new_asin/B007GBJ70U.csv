8516256,5,B007GBJ70U,"It looked really good when we saw the list of techniques and weapons they cover when I ordered the course. But then we sat through the  whole 8 hours of video and it is absolutely blowing our minds. It's way more than we expected and I think my family will be using these tapes for years. Our dojo doesn't handle half of this. I also email with Sensei and the Instructors and they are very cool about all my questions. Our family uses this together and the friendly manners of Sensei Roemke with his safe training tips are good for my kids, I don't have to worry about what they practice when I am at work. We recommend these DVDs for anyone, even some more advanced old-timers like me.",1403395200,4,686,4.317829457364341
8516257,5,B007GBJ70U,"This is incredibly complete and it was easy for me to follow. It covers all the basics thoroughly. Lots of weapons instruction is great and has lots of examples how to use the tools and grapple against them too.  The sensei is excellent and the friendly style is refreshing for martial arts instruction.  Very high production quality. There is so much in here that I will be able to use it and re-watch it for many years.

It came with 10 discs as advertised - 9 are DVDs and 1 is the CD with the PDF curriculum guide that's printable, over 40 pages that follow the DVD material.",1355875200,7,579,4.342592592592593
