8091855,5,B000BSO75A,Most informative and well rounded program on the hidden city that we have watched in a long time. If it is not being used in collage courses it should be.,1380758400,,154,4.166666666666667
8091856,5,B000BSO75A,I really enjoyed this.  I learned a lot about Petra I didn't know.  Like the people who actually built the City and that it was a thriving metropolis.  I'd recommend this to anyone.,1354233600,,181,4.424242424242424
8091857,5,B000BSO75A,This documentary is very interesting.  Leonard Nimoy has the best narrating voice in the business.  This video is for archaeology buffs and biblical archaeology enthusiasts.  The ancient city of Petra is on the Jordanian/Israeli border.  I recommend seeing this documentary and visiting the city.,1300838400,3,296,5.659090909090909
8091858,3,B000BSO75A,"This DVD is all about the history behind Petra.  I was hoping to see more photos or video of what is there.  I left with mixed emotions because I now know more, but wished to see more actual photos.",1212019200,5,198,4.051282051282051
8091859,4,B000BSO75A,"The program does examine well who these people were, why Petra was so successful, and what happened to it. It does so in a very entertaining way and is well worth seeing. My only reservation is that there could have been more detail about the people's way of life and what the remains of Petra actually represented. It is a little unclear about what were tombs and what were not and what the actual layout of the site was. I realise of course that there is still a lot of work going on at the site.",1168387200,11,498,4.197916666666667
