This film inspires me and reminds me not to hold anything back from Him, but to give Him everything I've got!  Josh Ridgway did a fine job of playing himself, the young man in the film.  The script closely follows the storyline in the book, ""My Heart, Christ's Home,"" by Robert Boyd Munger.  If you want to make Jesus the Lord and Savior of your life, and be really good at it, then I highly recommend this film.  It portrays Jesus as the Person living on the inside, always there with you, giving you intimacy and true friendship, unconditional love, guidance and help, and a relationship that's real and never quits!  If you are serious about having that kind of relationship with Jesus, and you want to get better and better at it, then you really should get this DVD.",1441411200,,856,4.379746835443038
