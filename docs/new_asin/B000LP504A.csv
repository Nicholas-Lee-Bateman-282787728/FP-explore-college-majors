8162742,5,B000LP504A,"There are many reasons to like this movie set in a Shanghai boarding house as the Communist armies approached the city in 1948.

--  You can read about the Chinese civil war in a dry textbook.  ""Crows and Sparrows"" fills in the history with views from a lane in Shanghai -- inflation, housing shortages, corruption, arrests, and so on.
--  Zhao Dan gave a fine humorous performance.
--  A subplot involving black market penicillin nicely showcased true character in hazardous times.
--  The home's occupants show different personality types -- venal, enterprising, naive, timid.
--  Economists will want to tease out lessons from the arbitrage between official and black market exchange rates.
--  In general, the story line reflects the fatigue of the Kuomintang regime and ordinary people's hopes that a Communist victory would turn a new page for China.  That their hopes would be cruelly dashed within a few years does not falsify the film's images of hopefulness, seen in a final gathering of the home's residents for Chinese New Year, and in a proverb.

Two back stories make the movie more poignant today.  The first:  Zheng Pengli began making the film when the KMT still controlled Shanghai.  Left wing in his beliefs, Zheng had written out a parallel script that would celebrate the coming Communist victory.  Shooting the scenes for the final version while the KMT still controlled Shanghai required some clever subterfuge.

The second back story is what happened to director Zheng Pengli.  His film anticipated and welcomed the Communist victory in the Civil War, but Zheng was ultimately persecuted during the Cultural Revolution and died in 1969.  The Revolution ate one of its own.

My imagination also turns to a sequel.  What would have happened to the characters after the end of the film in 1948?  The corrupt KMT official, ""Mr. Hou,"" and his wife would have escaped to Taiwan.  For the others, they might have suffered the same fate as Zheng Pengli.  They welcomed the prospect of a new China, but Zhao Dan and his wife would have soon been persecuted as former black marketeers, the innocent maid A-mei would have been persecuted for working for KMT officials, and even the timid schoolteacher who finally came out for the revolution, Mr. Hua, would be persecuted for his education.

The Chinese film ""Shanghai Rumba"" (2006) recreated the making of ""Crows and Sparrows.""  When it eventually comes out on DVD, you'll want to watch the new film to see some of Zheng Pengli's ingenious camera techniques.

8162743,1,B000LP504A,"While the quality of the movie is about what one could expect from a film of that era without having had careful archival processes, the key problem for non-Chinese speaking audiences was that the movie is not subtitled. The main menu offers three choices - as far as I can tell - play movie, return, and scene selection. Nothing that one can select gives you the option of language or subtitle, let alone other settings. Having read a previous review that talked specifically about the subtitles, I had selected this for a film class but then had to switch it out. I suspect that Amazon may have gotten the wrong batch and did not know about it. The film is supposed to be one of the more interesting ones from the era (some of which was actually filmed prior to the revolution and subject to GMD censorship). But non-Chinese speakers should beware that they will not be able to understand the film.",1235606400,6,900,4.561728395061729
