7575889,5,B019IZAZL6,"Lefty Kreh's techniques are the best out there and I highly recommend them.  They can take a poor caster and make them successful without a casting instructor.  The instructor is still best, but this is a good product to get yourself on the water.",1465603200,,247,4.590909090909091
7575890,5,B019IZAZL6,Great review of how to cast,1458345600,,27,3.6666666666666665
7575891,5,B019IZAZL6,"There are many videos on fly fishing and fly fishing technique which I have bought over the years some are junk! Trash poorly made and poorly instructed. This is the best I have seen, it out ranks what I thought was the number 1 video Joan Wulff's Dynamics of Fly Casting which I also bought from Amazon. If you want the best get The complete cast if you want a a complete course I would get both videos. If you only are going to buy 1 then get the Complete Cast.",1456617600,4,463,4.0989010989010985
8745353,5,B019IZAZL6,A fountain of knowledge and very helpful.,1528761600,,41,5.0
8745354,5,B019IZAZL6,Extremely helpful for someone who already casts reasonably well and wants to improve. Not for someone who is just beginnings to fly cast. Too much detail.,1525219200,,154,4.961538461538462

8745357,5,B019IZAZL6,"It was like spending time with lefty. The era's best. Lefty, I still have trouble curving a fly to the right. Thank you for all of the help.",1511049600,2,140,4.035714285714286
8745358,5,B019IZAZL6,"There's something about these two guys that inspires confidence in their methods. You can tell that they've put a lot of thought, experimentation, and experience into figuring things out. They come across as friends offering advice and are never condescending. I've got a couple of other casting DVD's but this one has helped me the most. The scientific analysis, working on principles backed up by graphs, is an effective teaching approach for me. And the Blu-Ray clarity is a real bonus, not to mention the excellent photography. I have something to think about each time I watch it.",1478044800,,585,4.979591836734694

8745361,5,B019IZAZL6,OUTSTANDING!!!  Already have many FlyFishing instruction dvds because I continually want to learn and improve.  This by far is so inclusive.  I've watched it several times already and will continue to watch as a refresher before every FlyFishing trip.  Highly recommend for all level of Fly Fishing Anglers.,1475020800,,307,5.333333333333333
