416745,4,6302036054,"Jodie Foster began her acting career at the age of two making commercials while she entered the television drama scene a few years later.  Her big break emerged when she received a spot in Scorsese's Taxi Driver (1976), as she performed the part of the teen prostitute Iris.  It was a part that received an Oscar nomination 1977.  The same year Taxi Driver was released another film surfaced where she had the role of the story's protagonist.  It was titled, The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane, where she portrays the tough and independent 13-year old Rynn, a poet's daughter, who lives in a leased house all by herself.  Again, she performs brilliantly, however, this part did not land her any Oscars, but she had the opportunity to polish her talent with Martin Sheen performing against her.

The low rays of the fall sunset reflect off the New England seashore waves, as the camera smoothly pans to the right in the opening scene.  Together with the beach, Foster's character emerges in full contrasting figure due to the daylight's reflection bouncing of the water.  Rynn stops and stares out over the water, as if she were looking for something, maybe an answer, or for help.  In either case, the scene provides some insight to Rynn's character's thoughtful persona and the ambiguousness atmosphere that later appears in the film.  Her solitary presence on the beach also gives a conceptual idea of her position in society, as she lives in a small leased without anyone caring for her.

Quickly after the opening credits the story jumps into the middle of the story, as Rynn celebrates her own thirteenth birthday on Halloween night.  If this does not evoke any kind of anticipation, the audience might not be aware of the American culture, or the neglectful abuse parents accomplish by neglecting a child's birthday.  Nonetheless, Rynn goes about her business, as if she did not expect anything else.  The isolated seclusion and loneliness of Rynn immediately wins over the audience to her side, as the audience does not know what to expect form the story.  Consequently, someone is knocking on the door and it is Frank (Martin Sheen), a lone trick-or-treating adult.  The initial meeting between Rynn and Frank delivers a significantly tense moment, which intensifies when Frank snoops around in the cottage and asks about the father's whereabouts.  It is clear that Frank knows something, but what we never find out.  However, his presence augments the audience's favorable feelings toward Rynn, as her vulnerability increases with the pedophilic tendencies of Frank.

The story in itself focuses on the father, who obviously never emerges, as Rynn repeatedly lies about his location to all that ask.  Through clever camera use, the audience learns about secretively guarded secret that Rynn hides.  The secret seems to hide in the basement, as Rynn works hard on keeping the nosy people from her house, including Frank and the owner.  The secrecy within the film enhances the apprehension in regards to Rynn. It is obvious that something is wrong, and the initial positive mind-set toward Rynn begins to rumble.  The ambiguous nature of the story brings forth an intriguing notion in regards to human nature that humans often have more than the image that they attempt to portray to the people in the social setting.

The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane is a highly atmospheric story much due to a combination between the cinematography, scene framing, score, and the performances by the cast, which all helps strengthen the secrecy and suspense within the film.  The director Nicholas Gessner's delicate handling of taboo issues also increases the uncertainty that seems to linger in the air, as the audience never knows what will happen next.  It shows that Gessner has a brilliant eye on how to build up a solid thriller, however, after having seen the film it feels like there is something significant missing.  The film strongly flirts with the audience's anticipation, but it never delivers anything to relieve the tense atmosphere.  Instead, the film only leaves the viewer with a highly teasing experience of what could have happened.  Yet, within the ambiguousness the story and the open-ended feeling leaves the audience with the idea of finishing the story for themselves. Gessner's cinematic creation leaves the viewer with a clever depiction of something very captivating, which delivers both a terrific and awkward cinematic experience depending how the viewer approaches the film.

Jodie Foster's performance is an excellent reason to why the viewer should experience this captivating thriller.  In addition, Gessner's direction helps keep the story fascinating.  The combination between these, the direction, and the acting helps develop a unique cinematic experience that will linger for some time in the back of the mind.",1129852800,6,4857,5.07808564231738
416746,5,6302036054,"I have waited about 25 years to see this movie again! Finally, it is on DVD where it belongs! This is my favorite Jodie Foster flick (yep, I even like it better than Silence Of The Lambs) as well as my favorite movie from the 70s. As Rynn, Ms. Foster is perfect! She was 13 (as was her character), going on 27, and comes across as cool, controlled, and mysterious. Living in her leased house, Rynn must use her smarts in order to survive and avoid discovery. Is her father alive? What's the real story about her mother? Will that nasty / nosey Mrs. Hallet (Alexis Smith) ever leave Rynn in peace? Will Hallet's disgusting and dangerous son (Martin Sheen) go too far? Will Mario (Scott ""Bad Ronald"" Jacoby) be able to help Rynn in her ruse? And what about officer Miglioriti? Will his suspicions unravel Rynn's carefully constructed life? And just what is down in that cellar anyway? TLGWLDTL is a twisty little mystery / thriller showcasing Jodie Foster's natural acting ability. She's so adult it's scary! I love some of Rynn's comments on public school (she's never set foot in it) for instance. She calls it stultifying. Rynn is a unique kid in a homogenized world. Her conversations with Mario are as enlightening as they are entertaining. I find myself wanting her to make it, even though her doom appears inevitable. Much has been made of her nude scene. It is very brief and I wasn't offended by it. The sexuality between Rynn and Mario is more implied than explicit or graphic. I had a harder time with the infamous hamster scene! Of course, this helps to define Sheen's character as a thoroughly repugnant human being. He is driven to have Rynn at all cost. Watching his increasingly obsessive / violent behavior toward her is disturbing and (sadly) familiar. He's just like the predators that fill our current papers and news programs. Enough about him! All Jodie fans must add this one to their DVD shelf!...",1128816000,45,1919,4.680473372781065
416747,5,6302036054,I have loved this movie for years!!!!! one of the best thrillers I have ever seen. Jodie Foster and Martin sheen are awesome in this classic..It's about time they finally released it..,1127952000,5,184,4.78125
416748,5,6302036054,"Possibly the best of Jodie Foster's post ""Taxi Driver"" adolescent films, Nicolas Gessner's ""The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane"" is a terrific, creepy psychological thriller about an abandoned thirteen-year-old girl who will resort to anything to remain living alone in her father's house, even murder.  Her murder weapons of choice?  Arsenic, and the unseen creature (or whatever it is) that lives in the basement.

Martin Sheen, Scott Jacoby and Alexis Smith co-star as potential victims, but this film is Foster's showcase all-the-way.  She is terrific in this ultra-creepy fright-fest which concentrates on pulling the strings of psychological horror rather than offering a full-frontal, visual assault on the viewer.  And giving away any more of the plot would be a cheat; it's best for the viewer to experience what happens him/herself.  A word of warning, however:  some viewers who are partial to gore and action in their horror flicks would be well-advised to steer clear and check out the ""Friday the 13th"" films instead.  But for psychological horror fans, ""The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane"" is hard to beat.

One question:  with Foster's success in the suspense/horror genre as an adult (""Silence of the Lambs"", ""Panic Room"" and the upcoming ""Flight Plan""), why did it take 28 years for this film to become widely available on video?  That said, kudos to MGM/UA for not only finally presenting this classic for mass viewing, but for offering it in its original widescreen format.  Evidently there are no more features, but who's complaining?  At least we have another great film, long unavailable and unseen on any format (including TV), finally available for consumption.  Thank you, MGM-UA.

416749,5,6302036054,"I almost fell over when I read that one of Jodie Foster's best films is finally on DVD, hidden away no longer. ""Little Girl"" was a modest box office success from American International (now acquired by MGM) which features one of Foster's best performances--younger or older; her Rynn Jacobs is purposefully cut off from the world, wise and alone, and she's forced to match wits with intruders like Alexis Smith as the nasty Cora Hallet. Not a big-budget release, the film carefully builds atmosphere within the one major set using a terrific group of actors, eerie-romantic music and a solid script. And Jodie, who reportedly was uneasy making this film(with the sexual aspects and the scene with the hamster), is so incredibly vivid: whether hiding a chipped front tooth(as per the novel), lighting a cigarette from a birthday cake candle, or showing off Gordon, she's mesmerizing. Two minutes were added from the European cut: a playful F-word and some nudity featuring an obvious body-double for Foster (actually, it was older sis Connie Foster who stepped in to disrobe).",1124236800,11,1075,5.044943820224719
416750,4,6302036054,"(...)

Long lost and all but forgotten, finially coming to DVD.  And, in widescreen. The local used for the film fits exactly. First of all, I loved the production quality, atmosphere and locale. The acting was first class and shows Jodie's soon to blossom strong talents. Martin Sheen probably won't be happy to see his character reprised, he is not a nice guy in this film, especially with Jodie Foster. The direction and score are excellent as well.

The plausibility of Jodie Foster's character behaving essentially as an adult stretched things a bit. It was a little rough for me to buy into a 14-year-old cooking gourmet meals, serving fine wines, listening to Chopin and generally acting much older than her chronological age. Even taking into consideration the events in her life, which apparently had
shaped her personality, she seemed too mature for her age. If you put that concern aside however and accept it as a given premise of the movie you can sit back and enjoy the fun of trying to figure out what's going on.

The film takes pleasure with its twists and turns and will keep you guessing.

416751,5,6302036054,"This quiet little film is rather interesting. Foster plays a brilliant teenage girl who is fiercely independant, and whose father is always away on business. Sheen plays a creepy child molester who sets his sights on her. There is a secret that Foster is holding and Sheen aims to uncover it, all the while aiming to satisfy his twisted desires. Moody and damp mystery has become increasingly popular over the years, and rightfully so as it features outstanding, mature performances and an effective storyline. We can only hope that it is soon released on DVD, as the video is long out of print. Search this gem out.",1121731200,7,616,4.766355140186916
416752,4,6302036054,"The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane (Nicolas Geesner, 1976)

I find myself more willing to forgive a film for not sticking to its literary roots when I've seen the film first, and such is the case with The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane. It's hard to believe it's been almost thirty years since I first saw this film, but it is; when I rented it last weekend on a nostalgia trip, I found that it's lost none of its brilliance over time.

Much of that has to do with the performances of the two principals, Jodie Foster (fresh off her success in Taxi Driver) and Martin Sheen (three years after Badlands, three years before Apocalypse Now). Foster plays a thirteen-year-old girl menaced by pedophile Sheen, but takes care of herself quite nicely in that regard (in fact, Foster's character here might have been the poster-child for what is known today as empowerment). There's a subplot going on about Foster's mysterious father, whom no one ever sees, and a related coming-of-age one about her falling in love with the nephew of a member of the local constabulary. All of it is handled quite nicely, and while things are rushed, they're done as well as they can be; chalk it up to Laird Koenig adapting his own novel for the screen. It's almost enough to forgive the large gaps those who have read the book will notice, and Gessner's almost amateurish handling of the passage of time (it seems almost as if Foster and the nephew, played by Diary of Anne Frank/Return to Horror High star Scott Jacoby, go from wary acquaintances to lovers overnight, since Jacoby does nothing to show the passage of weeks except add snow to the scene; he must not have ever lived in Cleveland, where snow on Halloween may be uncommon, but does happen now and then).

Highly underrated atmospheric suspense. A must-see for Jodie Foster fans. ****",1096502400,89,1836,4.643076923076923
416753,5,6302036054,"I've never been a big Foster fan, but when I saw this movie I was impressed. Jodie starred in this movie when she was a teenager. The movie is mainly about a girl whose father and mother have seemingly abandoned her, and she's left alone to fend off nosy teachers, and a would-be child molester. Although it appears that Foster's character has it hard, her sagacity is amazing- -Foster's the smoothest kid ever...nothing in this movie is what it seems.",1011916800,18,452,4.6625

416870,4,6302036054,"Very creepy movie.  Not scary, but creepy.  Martin Sheen is such a scumbag in the film!  Lol.  Jodie Foster once again is flawless and plays against the adults in the movie very well with her intellect and instinct.  I got real uncomfortable when this PG rated movie got to a part with a naked Jodie Foster but then read that her older sister was the body double for that scene.  Anyhoo...it's a great mystery, suspense, semi-horror thriller that you should check out.  Quick description...a little girl lives in a house by herself but keeps giving convincing stories to the adults that keep asking questions about where her parents are.  Martin Sheen and his evil mom start really investigating if the little girl is telling the truth or not.  Martin Sheen plays a child molester and really gives the film a great convincing uncomfortableness to the story.  Great supporting cast.  The Blu-ray is top notch.  The picture is cleaned up from the last DVD release and the audio is fantastic.
The extras include the following:
Commentary features director Nicolas Gessner.
Interview (27:27, HD) with Martin Sheen discusses the actor's approach to working on ""Down the Lane,"" starting with casting and initial curiosity about the part, which required trust in Gessner. Time with Jodie Foster is discussed (the star befriended Sheen's daughter on-set), along with a breakdown of the hamster sequence, with the interviewee careful to note that a real creature wasn't harmed. Sheen's always fascinating and invested in the moment, making the conversation lively, and his thoughts on professional opportunities for young actors in today's media-everywhere landscape are interesting.
""A Conversation with Sheen and Gessner"" (5:33, HD) is a brief reunion between the professionals, who enjoy some mutual appreciation and explore creative choices over Skype. Unfortunately, Gessner's side of the conversation can't be seen due to laptop illumination issues, but a spirited chat remains.
And a Theatrical Trailer (2:03, HD) is included.

I had heard that there is a longer Canadian cut of the film but this is the 92 minute theatrical cut of the film that was released here in the States back in 1977.",1465084800,3,2189,5.132394366197183
416871,4,6302036054,"The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane (Kino Lobber) is set in a New England seacoast town, where thirteen-year-old Rynn Jacobs (Jodie Foster) lives alone in an old cottage at the edge of town that her famous English poet father leased for three years. When he discovered he had cancer, he committed suicide. A letter from her father urged Rynn to make it on her own without getting involved with institutions and bureaucracy, especially orphanages and schools that have little respect for the rights of children.

On Halloween, pervert child molester Frank Hallet (Martin Sheen) comes trick-or-treating with his kids and makes inappropriate advances. Franks mother (Alexis Smith)  also Rynns landlord is a wealthy, WASP-ish sort. Both she and her son begin to suspect that this little girl is hiding a dark and dangerous secret. Rynn is determined to preserve her isolated existence at any cost.

This film is interesting mostly because of the cast. The young Jodie Foster, already proving her ability to anchor a movie, would go on to win Oscars for The Accused and The Silence of the Lambs. Martin Sheen would later play the President of the United States on TVs The West Wing. Former 1940s Warner Brothers contract player Alexis Smith never achieved the stardom of her fellow Warners actresses, Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, but always maintained an aura of glamour in her roles. Its an interesting collection of talent and a capable thriller with some suspenseful moments.

416955,5,6302036054,"I remember first seeing this movie on television in the 1970's, when I was not much younger than Jodie Foster's character.  I remembered it as a creepy thriller.  Watching it again recently brought back those memories, but the story is still fantastic.  Thirteen year old Rynn moves into a rented house in New England with her father, who is never seen.  Rynn dodges and weaves, telling slightly different but perfectly feasible stories to different adults interested in her welfare.  One story to the teacher and principal; another story to the local cop; still another story to her nosy, buttinsky landlady and her super-creepy pedophile son (a young Martin Sheen).  Rynn is still a child, but in many ways, far more capable of taking care of herself than the adults.

I liked Jodie Foster's performance in this movie--she was utterly believable.  I also found Martin Sheen to be believable, and in the 1970's, an era before cell phones, cameras on every corner and room, the 24 hour news cycle and helicopter parenting, he played the creepy adult who wanted Rynn, not happy to date and have sex with women his own age.  Like true pedophiles, he watched her very carefully, picked up that she was a potential victim, and used his power against her, thinking her powerless.  Little did he know just how resourceful Rynn is, and underestimated her determination NOT to be his victim.

My date remembered the movie too, but had forgotten the ""tinny"" music and he thought a few of the scenes were overly dramatic, but that didn't bother me.  Technology and movie making have changed a great deal since the mid 1970's, and that means some of the scenes (like the snow to show that it is now winter and that time has passed) and the music would be much easier to edit.  I didn't think these matters detracted from the story.  This is the story of a young girl who battles monsters, not the kind that live under the bed or in her imagination or that go bump in the night but a real monster--a pedophile.  Viewers never fully see what is in that basement, but back in the day producers didn't believe that all viewers needed to see everything--the glimpse of the latest victim was enough (and it was the quickest glimpse), leaving viewers to put together for themselves, helped by Mario's (Scott Jacoby's) reaction (nicely done and not hammed up) reaction.

Ultimately, as another poster noted, the story is about empowerment before it become a fashionable buzzword, and she dealt with her latest demon efficiently.  No fleeing from dinosaurs chasing the main characters, but a real life movie monster who got outsmarted by a thirteen year old who was going on thirty.

Other posters commented negatively about the brief nudity and sex scene, but like the other scenes (save the animal cruelty/hamster scene) in this movie, it was brief and much more was implied than actually shown.  I agree that Rynn and Mario became lovers very quickly, but I think that too went with the storyline.  Rynn was an adult despite her age; she trusted Mario as she trusted no one else except her father.  To me, sex was the natural progression of their relationship, though I think Mario had reason to be wary--she trusted him with her secret, but could he trust her?

There are plenty of chick films/lifetime movie network women in danger and young girls in danger to watch if you want something more modern.  The local channels and cable run them often, and for the most part, they're dreck.  They try, but they fail where the 39 year old movie The Little Girl Who Lives Down The Lane succeeds.  So get the popcorn, ignore the tinny music, funny hairstyles and clothes and the youth of Foster and Sheen and enjoy a well-acted and well-told story.  Highly recommended.",1426291200,,3746,4.751159196290572

416958,1,6302036054,"I stopped watching this after around a half hour.  I read other reviews and expected greatness; instead what I saw was a remarkably slow film and while Jodi Foster was great in it she couldn't save this terrible script from disaster.  If it ever became better later on still a movie should not be so incredibly boring to have to find out and that in itself is a big IF
I have an eleven year old daughter, Sierra, who has four adorable, loving hamsters and I hated the scene where this disgusting, mean man killed a young girl's pet hamster that she loved with a cigarette and threw it in the fireplace.

this film, written by the original author, offers many guilty vicarious pleasures as the protagonist faces conflict from all directions on a mission to remain independent and free from the world she's... broken into, that finds her curious and suspicious. while the world of a preteen girl isn't that complicated, the characters she encounters and deals with are a satisfying example of expected and acceptable conflict to explore within this context.

the film is very formulaic and generic as an example of cinema of the time-period, which has annoyed some reviewers but as i haven't seen ""barnaby jones"" before or whatever, it's a great time-period piece that was produced in a smooth, seemingly effortless style by obviously experienced/talented professionals. story 8/10 film 9/10.",1381190400,2,1012,5.053892215568863

The DVD quality was very good with no digital lock ups or skipping. The acting was great. The movie was very suspensfull, scary, tender in some parts but very sad and uncertain in it's ending. It was also very nostalgic for me as I grew up as a teenager in the 1970s but never watched the entire movie, unedited, until I received this DVD movie. I'm about the same age as Jodie Foster and can identify very much with how it was to be a young teenager mostly unsupervised during that era, only I feel like I'm a male counterpart to the character Rynn in some ways. It's not for anyone and can be disturbing for some. The movie, 'Bad Ronald' which came out on TV in 1974 had similarities to 'The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane.",1376092800,2,770,4.244897959183674
417023,4,6302036054,"Before he was an R.E.M. song or the beheader of Marlon Brando, or Mr. President, the young Martin Sheen was one of the most badass creepers in Hollywood.

And before she became the pluckiest FBI trainee ever, taking on the most badass, fava bean-eating creeper ever, Jodie Foster was already the longtime pluckiest kid in Hollywood, planning parent traps and taking on the likes of Travis Bickle's warped affections.

And between her two iconic adolescent roles, in the somewhat forgotten little 1976 film The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane, Foster plays Rynn Jacobs, a barely thirteen-year-old girl hiding some creepy secrets of her own in her basement while matching wits with the pedophile Frank Halle, perhaps Sheen's most truly sinister role. Some might argue that Sheen embodied a larger evil in his star-making (on the big screen, at least) turn as Kit in Terrence Malik's Badlands, but for me, Halle's cold calculations against both the welfare and presumed virginity of a barely teenage girl are far more cringe-inducing than Kit's murderous abandon.

At the start of the film all we know of Rynn is that she apparently lives alone in a rented house and doesn't want visitors going into the basement. She's constantly making excuses as to why her father is not present - these range from ""he's working in his study"" to trips to New York.

Frank Halle and his straight-laced and, let's be blunt here, bitchy mother, from whom the house is rented, soon begin to suspect the truth - that Rynn's father is no longer of this earth. Mom, despite her uptight demeanor, seems to have some genuine interest in the girl's welfare, but Frank, whom we quickly gather has a completely unwholesome interest in children, sees easy prey.

It's a pleasure to write about a movie where almost anything but a bare bones summary would be a spoiler. Suffice it to say that, much to her detriment, Mrs. Halle discovers what Rynn's hiding in the basement soon enough. This leads to a number of plot twists and turns which include Rynn attracting the curiosity of a local policeman as well as the officer's teen nephew, Mario (Scott Jacoby), a budding magician with a limp who is only slightly older than she is.

Mario eventually becomes a co-conspirator, attempting to protect Rynn from both Frank Halle and his own uncle. A case of puppy love also ensues between Rynn and Mario. The two young stars have a believable chemistry; they're believably sweet and innocent - which is to say they pull off the tough roles of kids trying hard not to be sweet and innocent, which only makes them more so.

Some of the surprises in the plot work better than others in terms of suspension of disbelief. The manner in which the police officer is finally convinced of the existence of Rynn's father is one, for example, which begs credulity, but the movie is so generally clever and its tension so genuine that we forgive and go along for the ride.

One thing the movie does well is show both Rynn's cunning and her loneliness. While the idea of a girl only a few days into her thirteenth year managing to live on her own in a small town for any amount of time without being found might sound difficult to swallow, the film provides enough concrete examples of Rynn's resourcefulness that we could actually see it happening. Her loneliness comes through as her friendship with Mario blooms. She is in dire straits when he comes to her, her subterfuge all but unraveling as she tries desperately to hide a huge piece of evidence. Mario's eventual fate - which is not resolved at the end of the movie - only adds to the viewer's sympathy when Rynn must, in the final scenes, face Frank Halle alone in a tense game of cat-and-mouse.

That final scene is a textbook example of how suspense can be employed to squeeze the viewer's guts and heart without the use of a gun, without physical violence, with only words and situation prodding us to the edges of our seats. Rynn's final dilemma, a spin on the old ""two cups, one poisoned"" theme, strikes the final poignant note as we realize that Rynn would have stoically accepted either outcome.

This is one of those movies we're seeing less and less of these days, one that takes chances and allows the many horrors it portrays to be ""quiet"" with no shots fired, no blood spilled. It's also brave, for both its era and ours, in that Sheen's character is realistically portrayed as a pedophile who is allowed to operate in society because of his position in society, despite the fact that most of the town knows the truth about his predilections.

Although it's more than 35 years old, the story elements of The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane don't feel dated at all. It's a tale that could happen down the street and it's of a type we need to see more of. It's mystery with a number of actual mysteries, a screenplay that isn't afraid to let its protagonists experience sadness and dark emotions, and a story that could be performed on a stage, the audience sitting rapt by the unfolding plot itself with genuine concern for sympathetic characters in real peril.",1375315200,4,5089,4.681208053691275

417028,5,6302036054,"A french canadian film with a melancholy tone, what makes the story particularly enjoyable is to consider the ways that the writer has structured the circumstances that the main character is exposed to, which form the situations she finds herself in. Pay attention also to the economy of the directing-- long camera shots msake the audioence appreciate the mood the actors create. There are two aspects i noticed that make this film especially interesting:
she is not malicious. she is not deranged and shouldn't be feared, which in some ways the cover art portrays her to make that impression. But rather the deaths that occur weren't intentional but that they just fell together naturally, yet it becommes unfortunate for the girl. These circumstances create a mysterious air about her, and the fact that she is friendless exacerbates the unusualness, although it is truly brought out when she makes her first friend, the magician. Through him,  with regard to her needs for friendship & parenthood, she realizes the true realitiy she deals with which her suppressed feelings had dulled, perhaps as a psychological survival mechanism. Most importantly to recognize is that her precociousness seems to attract adult situations which give the plot flavor in the first place. It is unheard of to the other town folk that a girl spends so much time alone.  What makes it interesting is the circumstances this lonesome girl is thrown into through no choice of her own, and her interesting responses to them, which also come across as unusual for one so young.
Second aspect: there is an underlying sense of the sexism that a female must brook in society, which the main character experiences at so young an age---that very reality shapes her personality as the next level of maturity she is faced with after the adjustments she had to work through from the recent suicide of her father, where the story opens at. The audience is never told what happened to her father, but we're left to figure out through presuming that was the case. So, the story might be used as a little study in socialization, not just with the psychological insecurities of labeling people & hostile judging those who come from different cultures as ""others"" based on their nationality (British in this case); to a good look of the treatment of people in a community based on their gender, and how people place expectations on each other with regard to age as well. Status might be considered too, as her father had a respectable one strictly based on what type pf work he did.
Overall, aside from taking the story for what it is, and with good music, producers did a commendable job & credit should be given to it as it does offer an insightful look (subtly presented) at these interesting sociological aspects... and how these things affect our behavior.",1365897600,3,2826,4.885416666666667

It's akin to a modern day foreign or independent film. So, if you're waiting for some loud slasher scene or blood & guts, you will be disappointed. This is a 'psychological thriller'. There are no over-the-top or chatty scenes, no unrealistic effects. 'Little Girl' is a suspenseful, well-acted, character-driven film.

I first saw it when I was a child, then again as a 38yo. My guess is, most kids (and adults, for that matter) of today need more action and editing than this film offers.

Sheens character is a ruthless monster and the little girl is a sociopathic little girl who will do anything to stay in her house.

It's a horror movie based on people that could vary well exist and in 1976 youth crime was alot lower (no gangsta rap to inspire them onthankfully ) so this would have even seemed more shccking.

417117,5,6302036054,"Rynn Jacobs [Jodie Foster] is an cunning 13 year old who lives with her father, a famous poet. She's homeschooled, takes care of all the household chores, and apparently caters to her father's every whim. Except that's not quite true. Her father is dead, dead for some months. He ardently believed that Rynn would grow up to be a stronger, more well-educated, more independent woman if she was left to her own devices rather than being put through the American foster system.
To survive on your own as a 13 year old girl isn't easy, especially in an insular, bigoted small community like the one Rynn and her father settled in. She is set upon by the local matron, who doesn't like independent little girls who tell them how to act. Worse is the matron's son, Frank [Martin Sheen], who likes little girls way too much. She has only two recently-made friends, Officer Miglioriti [Mort Shuman] and his nephew, Mario the Magician [Scott Jacoby]. But that's all she needs. That and her father's teachings--he taught her to protect herself under any circumstances, and her moral code (or amoral code) is centered on her survival.

This makes Rynn Jacobs a perfect horror hero, and also one of the most original horror heros the genre has seen. Rarely do women get to play the lead in horror, even more rarely do young women win such roles. And this movie was made two years before Halloween, a decade before Alien.

417155,3,6302036054,"CONTAINS SPOILERS !!! ""Moral ambiguity"" is a phrase often associated with the films of Alfred Hitchcock. But it takes this low budget, far from Hitchcock level film to actually achieve a level of moral uncertainty. Jody Foster plays a too smart for her own good teen who has hidden her poet father's death  and continues to live on her own. She is set upon by her prejudiced  virago of a landlady (Alexis Smith), and the landlady's pedophile son (Martin Sheen). We casually learn over the course of the film that the young girl has poisoned her birth mother.( This fact will play significantly into the movie's final scene.) She is befriended by a local policeman (Mort Shuman of 'Jacques Brel' fame), and his amateur magician nephew (Scott Jacoby). (The uncertain age of this nephew is part of the film's ambiguity. His sexual relationship with the Foster character may be as illegal as what Sheen wants to do ! -The brief nude sequence with Foster, obviously cut from television showings of the film, is seriously disturbing on many levels.)
The source of the film is a novel, but much of the structure seems oddly stage bound. Mostly filmed on a single set, the living room, dining room and kitchen of an old house, it plays out like one of those old-fashioned stage thrillers.
Foster and Jacoby are simply too likable for all of their wild behavior. They are lost or trapped in a world of teenage logic.
One looks in vain for a ""no animals were harmed"" (although one assumes that none were) notice at the end of the film because of a really awful sequence where Sheen tortures and kills a Hamster.",1240790400,4,1601,4.673758865248227

Sheen is superb as the annoying and salacious pedo-man, veteran actress Alexis Smith is good as the snooty and prying renter and Scott Jacoby, who I fondly remember for his numerous early-mid 70's made-for-TV movies, is wonderful as the young man who befriends Foster, helps hide her secrets and falls in love with her. Nice sparse Canadian rural location dovetails well with Foster's solitude & fortitude. Haven't seen Sheen this sociopathic since great cult classic THE INCIDENT [1967]. I was taken aback by the brief Foster nude scene but, then again, I'm still watching Andy Griffith re-runs. Only shortcomings: 1-Jacoby masquerading as the absent dad just plain ludicrous and, 2-the soundtrack was a mess with classic Chopin alternating with something that sounded like it could be used for a 70's skin flick.

417194,4,6302036054,"In this unusual, quite effective 1976 thriller, Jodie Foster plays a 13-year-old who ostensibly lives with her poet father in an isolated house in a small rural community.  However, we ""know"" early in the proceedings that the father is, in fact, dead and Jodie is surviving with the money he had put aside for her and by her own wits.

Problems arise for the young girl when Martin Sheen, a known child molester whose indiscretions have been covered up by his wealthy mother (Alexis Smith), arrives on her doorstep and starts making advances toward her.  Jodie is able to get rid of him, but he is determined to get what he wants and to also learn the girl's dark, deadly secret.

There are several surprising plot twists in this Nicholas Gessner-directed gem, and Ms. Foster's final, lingering close-up is unforgettable.

I LOVE Jodie Foster in this movie,
Full of confidence and showmanship after the success in Taxidriver and
Bugsy Malone. However.. the cutting, both on the visual AND the soundtrack are poor and Miss Fosters exellent work truly deserves a better craftmanship than the final result.
It would have been REALLY interisting to see what Miss Foster could have done as a director on a remake on this potential creepy story....

Now who, might you ask, is Gorden? He's not listed in the credits, but the scene between Martin Sheen and Gorden is so twisted, it makes you flinch. If you haven't seen the film, I won't spoil it for you in this review. But I'm sure if this film was made today, activists would assemble to protect the rights of all the Gordens in the world.

417203,5,6302036054,"Whether you are a fan of Jodie Foster, love films with only a handful of characters or just enjoy watching a really good old drama/mystery than this one is worth owning and having in your collection for future viewings. Jodie Foster plays thirteen-year old Rynn who hides the secret that she lives alone. Alexis Smith plays her nosy landlord Mrs. Hallet and Martin Sheen is her pedophile son Frank Hallet who the viewer will quickly begin to despise. Scott Jacoby plays her new friend/boyfriend Mario who helps Rynn keep her secret a secret. Mort Shuman is Mario's cop uncle who pays a few visits to Rynn's haven. With only 5 main characters and a few locations mostly at Rynn's home, much of this film focuses on character interaction and development. As you follow along, you find out why Rynn lives alone. What happened to her father? What happened to her mother? What happens when people find out Rynn's secret that she slyly  keeps hidden away? The sound and picture on the DVD is clean and crisp. No extras which is a shame because I have never heard Jodie talk about this film and it would be interesting to hear her thoughts on it. Jodie was a perfect choice for this film. Her character Rynn is a very intelligent young adult and it's fun watching her match wits with the people who are trying to expose her. I give this film 4.5 stars. If you enjoy this film, I also recommend Death and the Maiden which also includes a cast of only three people including Sigourney Weaver and Ben Kingsley and takes place in only a few locations. Much of that films focus is solely on character interaction and development as well and like this one, the suspense builds at a nice pace. There are a few people who gave this film 1-2 stars because it's wasn't a horror film. It's not trying to be a horror film nor do I believe it was ever advertised as one. Take it for what it is and you have a very enjoybable picture.",1190592000,6,1913,4.465714285714285

It's just really out of left field, but some how it was pulled off and didn't seem totally ridiculous, great cult film type of feel.

Some good tense scenes, some fine acting by young Jodi Foster, and hey watching the film you would think martin sheen really was a child molester irl!

A good pick up in my book.

OH, I almost forgot the sound track... for shame.  It sounds like it was wrenched from a cheezy 70 porno flick.  When the tension hook comes in the form of ""waka-chicka-waka-chicka"" you know something has gone terribly awry.  Try to cringe through it.",1188000000,,819,4.530612244897959

When I watched it this morning, I was still astonished with Jodie Foster's acting ability at such a young age.

It may be a long stretch, a thirteen year old living in a huge house in the country, with her poet father who may, or may not be, living with her.  But as the story enfolds, we understand why she is not in school.  Thirty years after the movie was made, I got rather frustrated about Alexis Smith's role.  I mean, the rent was paid for three years, what's the beef?  Too much overacting on her part.  And Martin Sheen -- well, he was creepiness personified.  A known pedophile in a small town!  C'mon.  Oh well, it is only a movie!

Martin Sheen was equally as good as a vile and sadistic pedophile. Basically an all around good cast. The story was so good that it kept me interested despite the plot holes. I agree with other reviewers that the story tried to deliver the right message about independence and not letting others change you into what they want you to be. But lets face it, in real life a 13 year old living on her own is not a wise idea. At the end her character even admits that they thought of everything except for loneliness and the need for human companionship. I also felt that the 13 year old carrying on a sexual relationship, let alone with someone who was obviously older than her was disturbing. It seems as if the movie was presenting some kind of double standard: Martin Sheen is disgusting for going after young Jodie but ""Mario"" isn't because he's her hero and within 10 years of her age.",1165363200,6,1030,4.543010752688172

The movie is well acted, directed and has an interesting plot. I found myself wanting more, though; almost as if the movie wasn't long enough. I wanted to see development of more details, but those details weren't as acceptable in the 70s, so I do understand. If you want creepy, this is a film for you.

It's the only movie that ever made me scream.

For almost an hour it kept me guessing.  I thought it might turn out to be a monster-in-the-basement flick.  It proved to be something totally different.

Young Rynn is living in an isolated house on Long Island with her father, famous poet Lester Jacobs.  Only nobody's seen her father for months.  And something--or someone--is in the basement.  Something Rynn desperately wants to conceal.

But her secret does come out--with fatal consequences.

This is the story of a loner who, facing cataclysmic events, finally learns to reach out to the one who befriends her: Mario, a young amateur magician.

""I'm not going to play their game,"" she insists.

""Well, you've got to trust somebody,"" Mario replies.

But in trusting him, Rynn places his life in danger.  She has to confront the final threat alone--as the trap door to the cellar creaks open.  It's that scene that made me scream--begging her to run to the kitchen and grab a knife!

She doesn't ... facing the final menace armed only with her wits.

This is great drama--a harrowing story of individualism, courage, and trust.  (And it's better than the novel by screenwriter Laird Koenig it's based on.)  Beautifully acted.  Beautifully filmed.  With a haunting score by Christian Gaubert.  Don't miss it!",1130198400,20,1554,4.930232558139535
417243,4,6302036054,"What a bizarre and frequently astonishing little thriller this is.

Unlike a lot of the reviewers here, I'd never seen this before.  But I do know a lot of people who had seen it on TV growing up and their enthusiasm made me curious.

Now I understand.  Though sometimes tonally uneven, this is a captivating little puzzler that somehow combines elements of 70s afterschool specials, Roald Dahl, Poe, low-budget horror and a single-set stage play... with apparent nods to Pinter and Orton.

A young Jodie Foster (at roughly the same age as when she played Iris in ""Taxi Driver"") stars as a teenaged girl attempting to conceal from the world that she's an orphan living alone.  Her obvious intelligence and uncanny maturity shield her nicely from most adults (she loves Emily Dickinson and Chopin and is teaching herself Hebrew) but then she's set upon by a pushy, presumptuous landlady and by the landlady's lecherous son, a turtleneck-clad mama's boy played by a stark Martin Sheen (not long after he made ""Badlands"").

What happens next needs to be seen with as little advance knowledge as possible.  And though the dialogue and music sometimes shift into melodrama (""Don't ever leave,"" the 13-year-old girl tells her new boyfriend, an amateur magician), the shifts almost seem intentional, a means of making the twists that much more surprising and unsettling.

This is a strange and cool little movie, a true underseen sleeper, occasionally quite shocking and a perfect example of a film that arrived far, far ahead of its time.",1129939200,68,1532,4.976470588235294
