8445069,4,B004WGKAJE,"Good demonstration and discussion of these nearly identical pistols.  Only drawback was that demo was only on the Taurus and slight differences exist in the trigger mechanism which was mentioned but not demonstrated on the Beretta.  Also a few camera angles were not good for some portions of the disassembly, but overall a very good explanation and demonstration.",1443830400,,364,5.258620689655173
