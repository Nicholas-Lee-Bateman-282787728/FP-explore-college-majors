8298393,3,B000Q6CGAU,"deep crates is a dope video that basically touches on the history of diggin' in the crates. touches about sampling and you get interviews with legends such as Pete Rock (who has a new album comin out ""NYS Finest"" and Marley Marl.

If you are looking for this dvd to give u tips on sampling or want to see people at work on the boards it won't help you much.

Its jsut basically informing you on the beginnings of diggin for samples and the players.

in all i enjoyed it but would of liked to see more of the producers making Beats.

its a rental or borrow form a friend.",1204156800,2,570,4.154545454545454
