8619907,2,B00G0JQM34,"I own every film Almodovar has released on DVD.  This is the first time he has bored me.  I found ""Habla con ella"" creepy, as I did ""Mala educacion.""  But these movies were both dramatic enough and skilled enough I wanted to watch them over. ""Los amantes pasajeros"" was simply boring.  The movie is largely self-celebration. The opening is a cameo for Almodovar's discoveries, Penelope Cruz and Antonio Banderas.  Cute, but meaningless, except to set up the possible airplane crash that is supposed to provide the movie with suspense.  It doesn't.  You know Almodovar won't kill off these characters.

There are plenty of themes from the past, including an obsession with ""maletas"", a raped-in-your sleep scene, along with a loss of virginity, plenty of drugs and druggings, personal items dropping from the sky, evil businessmen, a dominatrix, and enough mincing, prancing and swishing to give anyone diabetes.  Please!  Give up the anything that lisps is funny routine.  The three male stewardesses are grotesque, and the Captain is a troll.  The lipsynch cover of the Pointer Sister's ""I'm So Excited"" is simply embarrassing, like watching Bob Hope in blackface. (Neither homosexuality nor drag queens bother me, I have dated a few.  What bothers me is the laziness of defining gay as effeminate, and the bad taste of casting clowns for the parts.  Javier Cmara looks like he has some sort of chromosomal deficiency.)

Lola Dueas, with her innocent goofiness, is really the only saving grace of the movie.  She plays a psychic who loses her virginity raping perhaps one of only two good looking men in the movie (three if you count the co-captain who might go gay or might not).  But even the rape is boring, and her victim sleeps through it. Cecilia Roth phones it in from under a wig and a vintage paisley dress.  Her menace as a femme fatale isn't even false.  It's like the meanness of an old drunk; pitiful.

I won't tell you not to see this movie.  I could never skip a new Almodovar movie.  Just make sure there's a good return policy on your purchase.",1386115200,,2062,4.798295454545454
