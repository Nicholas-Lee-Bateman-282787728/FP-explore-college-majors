1245834,5,B00001ODGH,"I originally had this as a VHS back in the 90's. My God, When angels sing they sound like Sarah. The passion and intensity radiates from her songs and transcends on a level that I can't even put into words. She is pure angelic!",1406332800,,227,4.181818181818182
1245835,5,B00001ODGH,"Probably the best concert I've ever seen. Sarah McLachlan is dazzling, the music is fantastic, everything about it is awesome. I'm just glad that this concert was captured and preserved on DVD so I can experience it as often as I want.",1406160000,2,235,4.619047619047619

Buy it if you are fan of Sarah as I am :)",1400112000,,199,3.975
1245837,5,B00001ODGH,"I just received my copy of the DVD, Mirrorball yesterday. All I can say about it is that Sarah McLachlan is outstanding. I love every song. I am completely satisfied with the sound quality. I am completely satisfied with the visual aspect of this live performance too. She looks absolutely beautiful in this performance but hey, she IS a beautiful lady and so talented. I love her stage presence. All of her songs are so relevant to my life and I wish that more of the music coming out these days were still done like this. Her music comes from the heart. I recommend this DVD highly to everyone. This DVD is a must for any Sarah McLachlan fan.",1392163200,,644,4.420168067226891

1245841,4,B00001ODGH,"The seller performed their duties with aplomb. Regarding the SM performance, her performance was better when she did the Unplugged DVD, but this was good nonetheless.

1245852,3,B00001ODGH,"The Mirrorball live concert album has been a permanent resident on my iPod for years.  In fact, ""Path of Thorns"" is one of the tracks on my ""Hi-Fi Test"" playlist.  I finally got a decent Blu-ray player, and saw this in my search for live performances--as a DVD only, but I was still moved to buy it.  (Isn't it amazing how few Blu-ray live concerts are out there?)

I agree with most of the negative reviews on the production.  A cryin' shame for such a great concert.  The video is simply unsynchronnized with the audio, and it's most prominent with the mainstay front angle on Sarah.  The contention of some reviewers that this is an artifact of poor DACs used by listeners is nonsense; my ""DAC"" works just fine with everything else.

On the 5.1 surround sound: Yes, it sounds worse than 2 channel stereo.  But it DOES sound a little more like you're in a concert--it's just that you're in a bad seat and the vocals are too low in the mix.  Realistic, in an ironic way.  Using the stereo setting and a faux surround codec like Dolby ProLogic II sounds a lot better.  But you know what?  I'm not sure how surround sound is supposed to contribute to a concert recording anyway.  The whole purpose of surround sound is to have acoustics that replicate the spacial origins of the sounds relative to the camera perspective... but in a concert, all sound is ideally coming from the front, with a little reverb and some audience noise coming from the sides and back.  So it's not immediately obvious why 2-channel stereo with one of the artifical ""stadium"" or ""music hall"" settings on your A/V receiver wouldn't sound pretty convincing... and it does, in the case of this DVD.  You'll notice that in any concert video production--even lossless audio Blu-rays like Dave Matthews at Radio City or Sting in Berlin--when the camera angle changes the sound stage doesn't... i.e. a camera angle from stage right isn't accompanied by a massive audio shift to the left channels.  So what's surround sound really doing for us?

Well, back to the Mirrorball concert DVD.  Aside from the production problems, it's a great show.  The editing is good... the stage pulls you in, and there's not too much jumping around.  There are several more tracks on the DVD than on the CD, and the continuity is better, of course.  I'm glad I finally got it, but I find myself comparing it to the CD.  I guess the way to say it is that this is a good DVD that becomes great if you close your eyes.",1345161600,4,2466,4.541950113378685
1245853,5,B00001ODGH,"Although it doesn't say so anywhere on the disc, the 14 songs on the CD version of Mirrorball were recorded over a number of nights on her recent tour. This DVD, on the other hand, seems to be a single live performance - the last show of the tour, judging from some of what McLachlan says to the audience. Sarah and her band are in top form, as they cover practically the full range of her work. I can't think of a single song you'd want to hear in a Sarah McLachlan live concert that isn't on this disc. And that's the real selling point for this DVD. The DVD version of Mirrorball features some 23 songs - 9 more than the original CD! That's over an hour and a half of music to satisfy you Sarah fans.",1320364800,,703,4.101449275362318
1245854,5,B00001ODGH,"Now I ask you, what is wrong with watching a barefoot beautiful singer decked out in a bluish evening gown, complete with a black boa and a strapped on Les Paul guitar.  She mixes things up a bit using a Stratocaster and a Gibson to alter her look.  Now on top of this, Sarah McLachlan has a beautiful voice with a terrific range and she writes beautiful songs.  This live concert came at the end of her tour and features a tight band featuring 2 great guitarists.  I can listen to every song (well maybe I've had enough of ""Angel"") again and again.  She can be syrupy sweet and yes she can rock, e.g. ""Into the Fire"".  This is one of my favorite concerts.  It is well played, well staged and well produced.  How about a true 16:9 Blu ray?",1319155200,3,739,4.228571428571429
1245855,5,B00001ODGH,"This concert DVD is pretty much perfect in every way.

Sarah's singing is flawless and vividly animated by her bodily expression (she looks like a goddess), her band is in top form and tight as a drum, the song selection and sequencing is harmonious, the stage show provides a fitting context for the music, and the DVD audio quality is excellent.  In short, this is a performance which can deeply stir your soul, as though Sarah was channeling the music of heaven itself.  What more could you want?

If you're a Sarah McLachlan fan, you simply must experience this DVD (many times).  By capturing a live concert, this DVD offers dimensions which aren't possible with her CDs, to the extent that the CDs almost pale by comparison.",1273276800,,730,4.716535433070866

1245858,5,B00001ODGH,"This DVD shows Sarah McLachlan at her best.  It's a concert that focuses on her music instead of being a huge stage show, and I really like that.  It also has some cool special features.",1252713600,,186,4.285714285714286

1245860,3,B00001ODGH,"Sarah is superb! She sings with her soul in way that touch you specially. Regarding the DVD production...is a trash! The sound is horrible...i have to turn up the volume to MAX to have a proper sound and when i switch to 5.1 the voice comes from the rear speakers. It's a pity...this DVD deserves ''eagels hell freezes over - quality sound''

Image Quality is Below avarage. Besides that, 4:3 format.

Despite all that, I Still like it.",1231286400,2,436,4.576923076923077

1245862,5,B00001ODGH,"First, I must say that I love Sarah McLachlan; she is my favorite artist...period.  This live concert is well worth the money, and I cannot praise it enough.  The sound quality is good, the editing is good,the other band members are featured, and it is a DVD that will stay among your favorites.  Sarah is electric, her songs are timeless, and she sings with unsurpassable, transcendent beauty and longing.  From the first time I heard Sarah, I knew that she was touched by something greater, and this is evident in this DVD. If you have not yet figured what all of the fuss is about this woman, buy this DVD and you will no doubt be a changed person. I recommend this DVD a thousand times over.",1197244800,2,695,4.448818897637795
1245863,5,B00001ODGH,"I have been listening to the CD for years - It is my absolute favorite !!Although it was my only cd of her for years . I bought this and have watched it 3 times now  skipping through to my favorite songs I knew - then watching the entire concert . Where have I been ??? The songs that are included in this dvd are great ( a bunch  are on here that are not on the cd ). I now want every one of her cds . Little late I know but ... I did get Wintersong 2 weeks ago - wow - you have to get that also...
You will not be disappointed it is wonderful to see her perform .",1197158400,,565,3.5853658536585367
1245864,4,B00001ODGH,"The music in Mirrorball is fantastic.  The audio quality is very high and the Sarah McLachlan's voice is wonderful.  The band is very tight and seems to seriously enjoy the performance. The guitarists in particular, really shine.

The production quality is very good though cinematography is kept very simple.  The overall stage presence is elegant and clean with nice, and generally subdued lighting.

Sarah McLachlan sticks to the music in this concert providing minimal interaction with the audience.  Those few moments of dialogue are interesting and light with commentary on the particular piece she is prepared to perform.  The dialogue is pointed and serious where it matters the most and light, even humorous when she can afford to be.

The extras on this DVD are fine.  As a person who was only as familiar as radio playprior to the purchase, the interview with Sarah was very interesting. I am extremely happy with this performance and know it will find a regular place in my rotation of concert DVDs.

This is a concert that I can listen to repeatedly without loss of interest and I even expect to find an ever increasing appreciation for McLachlan's artistry.",1192147200,,1171,4.958974358974359
1245865,5,B00001ODGH,"I've read most of the reviews here and I could not disagree any stronger with the negative comments. The overall sound is very above average. I think the quality and adjustment options on a sound system are important. The point that I would like to make is that I am schooled in music and it just doesn't get much better than this. Period. This is one of the tightest, most versatile, talented bands I have ever seen on DVD. Sarah doesn't get it perfect every time, but one has to understand that this is difficult music to translate and play live. The band is diverse and almost flawless in it's execution. I know incredible talant when I see it.",1155600000,4,647,4.445378151260504
1245866,3,B00001ODGH,"Mirrorball (CD) is a favorite CD of mine, so I was eager to watch the concert DVD.  I haven't seen many concert DVDs, but I was thrilled by Fleetwood Mac's The Dance DVD, so I thought I might be by this too.

Unfortunately, the audio mix was inferior to the CD's audio (and the overall level was very low) and the camera shots changed so rapidly that it was difficult to view it as more than a glorified music video.  On MTV it's appropriate to change shots with every measure, but it's too distracting on a live-concert DVD.

If you're a fan of Sarah McLachlan, I'd still recommend buying this.  But, if you want a concert DVD to put on and listen to as a great-sounding concert, it might not be worth it to you -- check out The Dance instead:

1245868,3,B00001ODGH,"... Sound Quality is okay, lows are hard to find, video is not bad ""seen much worse"". Sarah's make UP is rather glam in this, she sings a decent repertoire, but she seems a little stiff ""Dean Martin style"" ... her body language fails to help you (audience) gain an emotional presence. I envisioned her to be VERY sensual in concert ""but NO!""

You get Sarah singing her songs; but, not much more unfortunately... as much as I enjoy her songs, this performance would not prompt me to see her on stage ""What a shame""",1142985600,3,513,4.4
1245869,5,B00001ODGH,"Mirrorball is the first music from Sarah McLachlan that I have purchased. It was recommended to me by an old and very dear friend. ( Thank you Betsy ). I have enjoyed the DVD immensely. I was surprised that the equivalent audio CD doesn't contain some of the better cuts from the DVD; in particular ""I will not forget you"".  The DVD is well produced and the sound quality is excellent. Sarah is quite a talented lady. The interview was also very good; a down to earth, low key sort of interview that reveals a lot about the artist.  She ends the concert with ""Angel"", a soul soothing piece of music.",1142640000,,599,4.387387387387387

1245871,5,B00001ODGH,This is one of the best female live concert dvd's on the market today. A class act. This one is a keeper.,1097971200,3,105,3.8181818181818183
1245872,4,B00001ODGH,"The performance captured here is tremendous as I think every would agree.

I didn't mind the visuals either, even though I was reluctant to get a 4:3 aspect ratio concert DVD.  It scaled onto 16:9 not that badly.  I liked the grainy film look but I suspect the visual quality and sync errors people are reporting are probably due to the DVD production house cramming 90 minutes of A/V plus extra angles into the stream.  I appreciated being able to focus on an set angle on some of the tracks but I think they used 4 angles for the entire duration of the concert.  I'm basing this on the fact my player was able to detect 4 angles at all times through the disc, even if those weren't 4 distinct angles.  That excess material probably steals bandwidth from the overall visual quality.

Audio is another story though.  I first came back here to check if my DVD was defective though because the 5.1 audio track sounded absolutely horrible - all boomy and full of echoes as if it had been recorded in a rink.  It was bad enough that I had to double-check my equipment and then search here to confirm the source is the DVD itself.

I suspect the people not complaining about the audio are maybe not audiophiles or more probably they are listening to the 2 channel track, which is excellent.  To my surprise and against my better judgement I find the only way I can listen to this disc is to use the 2 channel track and then let the receiver add the ambience - not a normal practice on my part and one which would ordinarily degrade the audio rather than improve it.

How does one rate this then?  I'd want to give it a 5/5 based on the great peformance and the length.  But a concert DVD like this needs to be rated against some of the standard bearers and I was very disappointed in how the audio stacks up.  Not that it would have to exceed say Eagles DTS, but a concert DVD should not attract negative attention because of its poor sound.

I'd want to chop at least a couple of points for the poor audio and 4:3 AR, but since the stereo track serves as an OK substitute in this case I'm going to go with a 4/5",1092009600,10,2107,4.269521410579345
1245873,5,B00001ODGH,"What can I say, this is an outstanding concert DVD!
Beautifully shot by expert video director Sophie Muller and she's done such a wonderful job in capturing
Sarah's natural beauty (Fumbling Towards Ecstacy in particular is absolutely brilliant, smashing sound, awesome stage
lighting with the thousands and thousands of fairy lights and Sarah's voice is just otherworldly.)
Watch how Sarah rips it up with her steamy yet elegant version of Witness and Fear is just amazing to watch her sing.
An awesome concert experience and if you're a Sarah fan and don't own this, then guess what? You're not a real fan!
A MUST HAVE!!",1089936000,3,621,4.923809523809524
1245874,5,B00001ODGH,"I really enjoyed this DVD!
I've read some of the other reviews where they complain about the sound, but my copy had no problems at all.  Everything was clear as a bell, & no synchronization issues.
Sarah McLachlan has an incredibly beautiful voice, & she is a wonderful & talented live performer, & all of that was captured perfectly on this DVD!",1071532800,2,346,4.580645161290323
1245875,4,B00001ODGH,"This is a good show.  Sarah always performs well.  One thing I would have to say is there is a lack of new material.  This is the final show of this tour and most songs are still from Fumbling, which was nearly six years ago.  She is beging to sound tired, after singing these songs for so long and a the end of the tour.  Also, it seems most of her new songs are very slow, almost lullaby like.
I would recomend instead the Fumbling towards Extacy VHS tape (not on DVD yet)  These were recorded when they were new and fresh and Sarah just sounds so much more enthusiastic with the songs.",1064534400,,588,4.15929203539823
1245876,5,B00001ODGH,"Just pour some wine, put on your 5.1 surrond sound (if you have analog output to your reciever then use it, it beats the digital sound)and let the waves wash over you. No, she's not much to watch, just swaying, playing guitar or piano with a big mike blocking her face, but the music is amazing, the sound is big and real (like your there rather than mix-the-live-studio-style sound) with back reverb on the rear chanels and the voice blended into the instruments (just adjust the center speaker volume lounder to hear the vocals better.)",1055808000,4,538,4.673684210526316
1245877,5,B00001ODGH,A very dear friend gave this DVD to me and I have truly enjoyed it. Late at night when all is quiet I love to watch this DVD. It is so nice to actually see Sarah and the band do all the great songs live. She is legendary and she is just getting started. Can't wait to see her career in the next 30 years.,1054252800,,304,3.6923076923076925
1245878,5,B00001ODGH,"I love this DVD for a couple of reasons.  For one thing, the DVD includes more songs than the Mirrorball CD.  Also, there's a really cool interview of Sarah that's probably about 20 or 30 minutes long.  She reflects on a variety of topics and talks about various songs.",1053734400,,269,4.448979591836735
1245879,5,B00001ODGH,"Im a progressive rock fan but this lady has a charm and a beauty

Great voice,good musicians,sober stage presentation
Highly recomended",1049846400,2,158,5.625
1245880,5,B00001ODGH,"Yes, the images aren't paper-cut sharp, but in my opinion, it's not a big issue.  I've viewed it on my 17"" computer monitor and my 27"" TV and have never felt it was a problem.  I actually enjoy it being the way it is, as I feel it adds a certain flavor to the concert, a certain mystique that's very Sarah.
I've read from other reviews that some people had issues with the sound quality and audio synching.  I'll address both in order.  First, sound quality.  I actually found the sound very rich and enjoyable.  To my ears, the music was pretty on par with the quality of the CD release of Mirrorball... but if you want die-hard CD quality, play the CD, I say.  Next, audio synching.  I had no problems with that on my DVD player and computer, but I had a friend who complained the audio synching was off on her DVD.  After she upgraded her DVD player (she had previously been playing it on a rather ancient machine), she says the concert has been playing well ever since, so we're suspecting the problem may be with DVD players and not the DVD itself.
Mirrorball is rich, dynamic, and above all, simplistic.  I love Sarah's style and it shows on the concert.  She walks around barefoot and doesn't once undergo a costume change.  The only effects are the lighting effects.  In essence, it's all about the music.  Her showmanship shines and in every act, Sarah commands the stage.  Simply put, every performance just gels together wonderfully to produce a fluid concert.  Each atmosphere is simplistic, dark, a little moody, yet vibrant and lively, and striking- just like Sarah's music.  She compromises nothing in this concert and everybody, including the band, seems absolutely at ease on the stage.
All in all, this concert epitomizes ""just enough to make it perfect.""  It isn't overdone and it isn't underdone.
The way each song is executed is absolute perfection.  In many cases with concerts, something goes missing.  This seems to be the case with many pop artists whose rise to fame rests upon commercialized ""canned"" music, those artists who rely on studio magic to make their songs good.  If you take away the glitz, glam, special effects, and outrageous costumes, the concerts would only be ""ok"" at best.  Usually, there's a horrible gap in music quality between concerts and CDs.  You'll find none of that on Mirrorball.  I was surprised to find that Sarah is really that good, as good on stage as she is in the studio.
On many of Sarah's songs, she creates music magic by overlapping vocals to create a more ethereal sound.  I was wondering how she'd duplicate that on stage, but her backup singer, Camille Henderson, is splendid.  Sometimes, the drummer backs up the sound, and I was surprised how just one or two more singers in the background could mesh with Sarah's sound so flawlessly.
I think one of the things I found most enjoyable with this recording is how Sarah keeps the energy going by staying ""into"" the music.  She moves around and grooves with the music, and I found myself entraced with her more so than watching other artists performing an extravagant dance number.  That says a lot when one lady up on stage can keep you entranced with only a microphone in her hand, compared to other recording artists who need a choreographed dance number, an entourage of backup dancers to sell their concerts, and thousand dollar effects.
Mirrorball was absolutely enchanting.  Sarah is penetrating and mesmerizing.  The entire ensemble that backed her up also deserves kudos for their performances.  The set up and concept were simple.  The music was truly what mattered and what took center stage on this recording, and it blew me away.  I own concert DVDs of the Corrs, Kylie Minogue, Britney Spears, Sarah Brightman, Charlotte Church, and Josh Groban, but this concert is the one that constantly makes its way back into my DVD player most often.
This was a very well done recording completely befitting of a beautiful artist.",1049068800,9,3950,4.736456808199121
1245881,5,B00001ODGH,"This concert gives you a glimpse that Sarah is a perfectionist. The audio is mixed very very well. Despite what the couple of other reviews say, the show is close to perfect sound wise and the way the track list flows very well. The show starts off with emotion, builds on it, and carries it through to the end. I am sad to say that I have not ever had the chance to see Sarah on tour. After viewing this show, I will try to catch the next tour (hopefully Sarah will release antoher studio album). This one is worth investing the [money]... to own your own copy.",1039046400,,562,4.212962962962963

It's just one superb song after another.  Besides her hits, try Path of Thorns, Mary, Fumbling into Ectasy, Into the Fire and, of course, my favorite, Possession. I think I'm infatuated now.

1245884,5,B00001ODGH,"It's unfortunate the CD version of this doesn't contain all the songs.  Nevertheless, Sarah McLachlan is a masterful entertainer & musician.  Her songs are stirring as they are romantic.  Her wit and humor emerge as she talks about a few of the songs (to-wit:  ""I Love You"").  This is one of those DVD concerts that a person can turn off the lights in their house, turn up the stereo and subwoofer and simply cuddle with someone they love while enjoying a good show.  I am biased, however, as I am a huge fan of Sarah.",1013126400,,518,4.4
1245885,5,B00001ODGH,"My husband bought this DVD a few days ago and we finally put it in last night.  If you even like Sara a little bit, you have no choice but to RUN (don't walk) and go buy this DVD NOW.  We watched it twice, straight through - I didn't want to go to bed last night - I just wanted to keep watching this DVD.  It has all of my Sarah favorites, plus you get to see her AMAZING band.  I have seen her in concert, but I never realized how incredible her drummer and guitar players are until seeing them on this DVD - WOW - This is a must have!!!  My husband and I said last night that this is the best $... we have EVER spent!  Buy it, buy it, buy it, BUY IT!",1011052800,,653,3.72992700729927
1245886,5,B00001ODGH,"After falling in love with Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, then receiving a DVD player for Christmas, I took the predictable step of buying this DVD. At just under 2 hours long it represents good value for money (9 tracks more than the equivalent CD release, plus an interview & extra features). The interview is pretty good, about 20 minutes or half an hour long. Check out the 'wacky' camera-work though.
But the concert itself is truly astounding. Sarah has always ensured her music is recorded to the utmost quality, with superb performance and production throughout, and this DVD is precisely the same. From the opening titles it is apparent that the emphasis is on clarity of vision and perfection of sound.
But it doesn't end there. I was astounded by the quality of Sarah's live singing voice - she's amazing! Not only that but her skills as a guitarist and piano player are superb too. She holds centre stage with great confidence, giving a solid performance of the highest quality, conversing with the audience and clearly enjoying herself.
I'd even applaud the running order of the tracks here: Last Dance sets the scene perfectly and leads into a glorious rendition of Building a Mystery - you get a great rush of excitement as the concert begins. Similarly, the first encore ends with a powerful majestic rendition of Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, a superb climax to the show, leaving room for a final (and quite gorgeous) recital of Angel, just Sarah and the piano, to round things off.
This has to be one of the finest concert videos (or DVD's) out there. Just sublime.",1010534400,6,1574,4.8118081180811805
1245887,5,B00001ODGH,"What an exquisitely delicate and wondefull DVD .... Sarah sings her most popular hits backed, of course, by her exceptional band.
Seeing her perform brings that extra magic and spice to the music as she effortlessly thrills the audience with her vocal range that seems to be rivers wide ....
On the technical side the only flaw that I can see is playing this dvd on a regular TV  with a total of one dollar nad fifty cent investment in speakers and try to compare it to your car speakers or your home sound system that probably cost hundreds if not thousands more.
Cmon now if you buy a concert DVD the better your sound system to take advantage of the Dolby digital 5.1 surround sound, the better you will enjoy this DVD, I mean you can not expect to get the full flavour of an action flick on a black and white TV either, right ....
This is one great DVD and I highly reccommend it as one of the best around ... hands down ....",1009497600,3,929,4.248587570621469
1245888,4,B00001ODGH,"I recently purchased Mirrorball after seeing it playing at a party I was at. It's absolutely beautiful. Even though you are watching it on t.v. you still feel as if you are part of the crowd at the concert. She stares into the crowd with such love and passion. She is very expressive when she sings, and that add's a little more beauty to each of her songs. She appears in a sparkling blue dress, barefoot, wearing a darling black boa around her neck. You fall in love with her as she sings and remember why you started liking her music in the first place. She has reassured me that talent in Hollywood is still alive and well.",1003017600,,627,4.322033898305085
1245889,5,B00001ODGH,"This DVD is excellent!  O.k. the coordination is a little distracting, but it's not anything that makes the DVD any less enjoyable...  If you're a fan, you'll like the DVD.  As for all of the other reviewers saying that the sound isn't good... Well they must not have a true Dolby 5.1 set up, because the sound is great...  With Dolby Digital 5.1, you are in the middle of the crowd watching the concert... You get the echo off the walls, the people, and the sound of a concert hall.... It is as real as it gets... It's not the clarity of the cd (which is a different performance) but it's a video, you're supposed to live it!  My opinion with this DVD is that you do live it.  You are very close to Sarah McLachlan and her band...
That is another good point that I'd like to add to this DVD.  You get to see her band perform which you don't get on music videos and such.  Her band is acceptional at performing just as she is. So this DVD is definately worth the money, especially if you have a Dolby Digital 5.1 set up!",1001462400,3,1020,4.168367346938775
1245890,4,B00001ODGH,"A very simple review then, for those (like me) who may be new to music video DVDs and are wondering what to expect from this DVD, since I wasn't very sure myself before viewing this disc.  This is not a compilation of MTV-style music videos of Sarah's songs.  The videos are filmed recordings of her performance before a live audience.  The camera work is much like that which you'd expect to see on a giant screen at a concert (e.g. wide angle pan shots interspersed with close-ups on Sarah and the band members).  There aren't any special effects applied directly to the film during the songs, but the stage-lighting effects are nice and combine well with some of the theatrical shots on Sarah.  Since these aren't videos shot in a studio, there aren't any sharp close-up shots (where their faces fill the screen).  As for content, I found this disc enchanting.  The whole band puts on a captivating show.  It's nice to hear Sarah introducing some of the songs with her feelings on the title, too.  These people make beautiful music.",997747200,5,1035,4.6740331491712706
1245891,5,B00001ODGH,"Ok, I know this DVD was released in 1999, but I just bought it here in Spain and I wanted to review it. It was extremely hard to find here, I was searching for it for months, and all of a sudden I found it hidden behind a bunch of Madonna's DVDs on a supermarket. It is an import, of course.
Well, the aim of this review is to belie those comments on the quality of the DVD version of the concert. If you are a real fan of Sarah's art you won't regret buying this. I mean, there's a couple of songs that seem grainy and sometimes blurry, but it is not a big deal. Take into account that it is a concert and there's no way this could have the quality of a movie. I own some music DVD's and none of them features a perfect image.
Probably, the worst thing in the DVD is the multi-angle camera choice, it is certainly a great idea, but the songs which feature this seem to actually loose quality. Anyway, you'll forget all these disadvantages once the concert has run 10 minutes. Sarah is unbelievably talented, her voice is a godsend for all of us, it never ever looses strength. From my point of view ""Into The Fire"", ""Witness"" (which amazingly weren't picked out to appear on the CD) and ""Possesion"" are the best played pieces in the concert. Besides, Sarah provides us with two shivering performances at the piano: ""Do What You Have To Do"" and ""Angel"", she must be in fact an angel herself.
Plus, the DVD contains other interesting features such as a picture gallery (really gratifying for all those who haven't seen much of Sarah's image as it happens in my case), lyrics to every single song on mirrorball or info about the fanclub. This adds to the DVD a great variety of possibilities specially for the foreigners who don't have much news about her. Add to this that the concert was directed by Sophie Muller, a well known video and video-concert director who worked with No Doubt on their ""Live In The Tragic Kingdom"", an amazing work on her behalf. So, please, avoid any hesitation and buy this if you consider yourself a fan of Sarah McLachlan.",994032000,4,2052,4.388451443569553

Obviously the songs are good but the lack of coordination between the audio and video prevents an enjoyable viewing experience -- I had to close my eyes -- and what's the point of that -- the audio on the CD is much better. During those times when my eyes were open the picture seemed unusually ""grainy"". This is the only DVD that I own that I truly regret having purchased.",991094400,,488,4.315217391304348

I went to my local CD shop and bought Mirrorball and Fumbling towards ecstasy. Incredible !. Each step brought me close to believe he was one of the best song writers ever. I ordered two DVDs  from her, this being one of them. And I hit the wall. The sound isn't bad, it's worse. The coordination between the image and the sound is poor (although it only is shows 6.2 over 10 in my DVD bandwidth level.. that's a problem from the recorder company!). So, I enjoyed the DVD anyway.. Later I used again my CDs, and man, that was awesome! They did sound crystal clear !. So, Icame to write this review. If you want to see Sarah in concert, buy the DVD. If you want to listen to the voice of Sarah, enjoy its music, and enchant other people, forget about it, and also save the money. The DVD quality is really low.  (And please, excuse my english.

I have a hi-res 21"" monitor and you can see incredible detail in this DVD. As a result the synching problem bothered me so much that I had to back off 10 feet from the monitor so it was less noticable. In spite of this I still recommend this disk (maybe the MFR will come out with a fixed, second edition) as it IS Sarah. I thought the filming was good and the song selection excellent.

Audio-wise is very nice, but not perfect.  Compression is used and keeps you away from that ""at the concert"" dynamics which are so exciting.  I do appreciate the mix, with only crowd and reverb showing up in the rear channels - very natural.  It's still 5 stars, but is not a reference-quality production.",980121600,,503,4.882352941176471

The video itself is adequate and the choice of songs is excellent.  Unfortunately the sound quality is the worst I have heard on a DVD.  It almost seems as if the music is an overdub on top of the video.  I tried changing processor settings to make up for the poor quality, but never could come close to making it work.  There are several excellent recordings available most notably The Eagles ""Hell Freezes Over"" and James Taylor ""Live and the Beacon Theatre"".

What I found fascinating is the interview segment, which covers her start in the business, her formal musical training, her method of composing songs, and a great look at her personality:  an intelligent and gifted musician, who is not shy in front of the camera.
There's also lyrics, Dolby Surround Sound or stereo, a photo gallery, and a discography.

There are a lot, and I mean a lot, of quick tight shots of Sarah and band members done in a what seems like an edit a second - a real distraction from the music.  Note to directors and editors:  These are concerts - we the viewers have longer attention spans than your typical 3 minute music video requires.  The only thing that saves the video portion of this DVD are the alternate angles provided on 4 songs - allowing the viewer to control what he/she sees.  I found this very beneficial.  Chose the ""wide angle"" option and left it there - MUCH BETTER!

Sarah is  brilliant here, as she is in all her live shows.  The choice of songs is  excellent, and the ""extra songs"" (not on the  ""Mirrorball"" CD) are a treat.
Technically, the DVD is terrific.  Camera shots are varied nicely, with crane moves mixed with slow zooms,  and the cinematography does justice to the sparkling staging of Sarah's  shows.  The audio is superb, with excellent miking of both vocals and  instruments.  (Audiophiles: soundstaging could be somewhat better, and the  use of compressors robs the recording of some of the dynamic punch of the  live event.  The sound is rich, however, and the low end has much more  definition than I've seen in a concert video before.)
One reviewer  mentioned audio synchronization issues:  on a quality DVD player, this is  not an issue -- players with inferior decoders or D/A converters may be  unable to keep up with the data coming off the disc, however, resulting in  apparent delays between the audio and video.  I use an external D/A  converter with my DVD player, and I've not seen any synchronization  problems with this disc.

Now watching her ten years later on the  Mirrorball DVD, I can't help comparing her from ten years ago.  Her music  and stage presence have obviously matured and the DVD reflects every subtle  note and nuance in her performance.  The extras on the DVD are also very  spectacular, especially the multi-angle footage.  It's good to see Ms.  McLachlan and the people at BMG/Nettwork have kept up with technology to  produce such an interesting and entertaining DVD.

Having now seen this, it really is hardly noticeable  and nothing to worry about. Sarah is sexy, sultry, and sweet. Performance  by her and the band is superb. Video is at times crisp and clear, but most  of the time is 'dulled' (deliberately by producers) This is how they wanted  it obviously, but if the quality is possible, why not offer it? It's still  fine, I was by no means thinking about it during watching it, but when  compared to the video quality in Eagles Hell Freezes Over for example, it's  not even close. There's a lot of reverb on guitars and vocals, if your  system allows, reduce the effect level. These little things that could have  been improved do not interfere at all with the enjoyment of the DVD. It is  an awesome concert and to experience Sarah 'live' in this way is an  absolute joy.

1245907,5,B00001ODGH,"I fail to see how I can possibly give a rating of less than 5 stars for this totally superb DVD.  At first glance, one would probably be tempted to give a lower rating - hey, for all intents and purposes it's just a concert  video right?  And no spectacular fireworks display, biting heads off of  chickens or anything at that!  So why the high praise?
Firstly, it's the  fact that Sarah Mc Lachlan was able to create an emotionally stirring  atmosphere amidst a ""simple"" concert stage backdrop.  Her songs  come out crisp and clear (5.1 helps a lot of course!), and the choice /  changing of camera angles and views was perfect - no glare or anything  (compare this with, say, Belinda Carlisle's Runaway Live DVD and you'll  know what I mean). Simple, yes, but it was ""near-perfect""  simplicity nevertheless.
Also, I personally liked the live versions of  certain cuts better than the standard ones.  ""Hold On"" and  ""Fear"" in particular, more, well, ""upbeat"".  I  especially liked the portion where she emerges from near total darkness  during the transitiion to the first refrain in ""Fear"" -  awesome!
And to cap this all off, you have a featured interview plus  multiple angle viewing options for select songs. And at a very low and  affordable price (at least when I got my copy!), what more can one ask  for?
Along with ""Eagles: Hell Freezes Over"", I rank this as one  of my favorite DVD's, worth revisiting over and over again.",956707200,,1433,4.662650602409639
1245908,5,B00001ODGH,"Wow ... I mean, like WOW! I am unable to rip my eyes away from Sarah. She is positively incandescent in this video. Her songs have been polished to a jewel-like finish, and every nuance of phrasing is right on. I can't  understand the quibbling with the editing. The camera lingers lovingly, as  opposed to that infuriating MTV-style of cutting every nano-second, which I  suspect is just a distraction from absence of talent.
But I digress. The  band is wonderful, and with 24 songs, you get fantastic bang for the buck.  My favorites are Adia, Vox, and the whimsical Ice Cream. Do yourself a BIG  favor and get Mirrorball. Thanks Sarah. I think I'm in love.",956620800,,659,4.637931034482759
1245909,5,B00001ODGH,"This is the second DVD Video I bought for my Toshiba DVD Player and I am very happy to say that Sarah McLachlan continues to shine in making quality DVD Videos. This one has tons of special features (more special features  than in the 'Sarah McLachlan Video Compilation 1989-1998') that are a joy  to work with, like an interview of Sarah, discography, photo gallery,  multi-angles (on 3 songs), and lyrics. The digital photos on these screens  are top, top, notch quality. However, I gave the DVD video 4 1/2 stars  instead of 5 stars because the quality of the sound and visuals in the  concert itself is not exactly what I had expected (like in the 'Sarah  McLachlan Video Compilation 1989-1998'; those on this DVD video are SUPERB  like I said in my review for this DVD video), and that's what you buy the  video for, mainly, mostly, for the concert, and not for the special  features, even though they're many and great. I guess it's because the  concert was filmed live and on stage in a theater, and that's why the  quality is not as good as MUSIC VIDEOS from the artist. But, it's still a  great concert, but I also gave it 4 1/2 stars instead of 5 because I don't  like concerts, ANY concerts, as much as music videos from an artist.",956534400,,1242,4.4622222222222225

Like many concert videos, it waspieced together from two back-to-back shows; that's how they makethem--they film two performances and take the best shots and make one video from it. That doesn't mean that the performances are fake. And as for the editing, maybe a few fades would have been nice, but overall I find it very enjoyable (love the close-ups of Sarah!) Of my current collection, this is the DVD I watch most often, and I haven't even been a fan of hers for very long.
 As for the picture quality, it is fantastic. I can't rate the 5.1 channel mix because I do not yet have a Dolby Digital receiver, but I am very happy with the quality of the stereo mix, and I think that's all you need for a music program anyway.  END",954201600,11,753,4.364285714285714

Enjoyed the performance by the band, although it would have been interesting to hear them shake things up a bit more instead of trying for  such a rote repeat of the studio tone. Some songs ventured out a bit, but  generally stuck close to the original.
What was really disappointing was  the sound. I ended up listening in stereo, since the 5.1 mix was so poor.  Sounded like they put one mic in the middle of the hall,then stuck even  more reverb in the surround channels. Truly bad.",951264000,,554,4.612244897959184
1245913,3,B00001ODGH,"I love Sarah's music, but I am disappointed with this video.  I went to a concert on her Surfacing tour, so it is painful to watch these canned music videos.  It is a very poor representation of her Surfacing tour.
I  would have much rather have had a few static shots from the angle of the  audience instead of the constant switching between closeups.  The viewer  gets no feeling of how great it was to be at a Sarah concert.

My only complaint was in the photography/direction.  Nowhere in this video is there a fade-in, or overlapping of two shots.  That kind of transition helps viewers to stay with the song.  Every thing  is cold take. Take closeup of Sarah, take drums, take guitar.  Also, there  aren't many shots where the camera moves with the performers (zooming  in/out, panning left/right). This kind of direction disturbs the continuity  of the performance.  You're getting into the song, but then there's all  these clicks to different shots.  It's somewhat like trying to watch  television while someone else keeps flipping the channels.
Also,  lighting changes make the overall presentation awkward.  In most places the  band looks soft, slightly dreamy.  Then later there are points where they  look ...raw, grainy or very much overlit.  Then Sarah does  ""Angel"" on piano and it's the best look of the whole video.  Blueish-white light but still crisp.
Compare it to her ""VH-1  Storytellers"" performance.  You'll see what I mean.",950140800,,1257,5.222222222222222
1245915,3,B00001ODGH,"First, I'll admit that I just bought my DVD player and am still experimenting with the sound setup.  That said, I feel that while this is a beautifully produced recording, I don't feel that the producers are being  100% on the level with us.  I'm reasonably sure that the audio tracks on  this DVD were not recorded at the same time as the video.  There are too  many times when Sarah moves quickly away from the microphone and her voice  does not change.  Too many times when her lips sound out something, and a  slightly different sound comes from the speakers.  I think that the band  met in a studio, recorded the tracks for this DVD live, then staged a  performance, again in a studio, where they synched to their live recording.  There is an audience shown on the DVD, but virtually no physical or eye  contact between the band members and people in the audience.  They all look  straight into the camera plenty, though.  In fact, with the exception of a  ""from the floor"" shot, we never see the band and audience members  on the screen at the same time.  Despite the fact that the  ""stage"" is brilliantly lit and all the band members are dressed  to the nines, we see not a drop of sweat on anyone.
My conclusion is that  this is a well-produced music video, designed to resemble a concert, and  using alternate, ""live"" takes of the musical material.  It is  well done, but not exactly a live concert in the way I define it.",949968000,12,1431,4.428571428571429
1245916,5,B00001ODGH,"This DVD demonstrates the effectiveness of the medium for concerts. The audio mix was outstanding and the visuals were stunning. I have never seen Sarah M. in concert but this really felt like being there, especially in  5.1. I really enjoyed the multiangle of Into the Fire focused on Ash the  drummer. I hope this is utilized more often in other concert DVDs. I have  an extensive DVD collection and this is by far the best music DVD to date.  Previously my favorite was Fleetwood Mac but this one is an order of  magnitude better! Wow!",949536000,2,538,4.5625
1245917,5,B00001ODGH,"This video was extremely well put together. Sarah kept the audience's attention with a wonderful flow of songs. Lots of color, different camera angles and motion onstage.",948672000,,170,5.333333333333333
1245918,5,B00001ODGH,"I first saw Sarah perform at the Lilith Fair in London in 98 and she is awe-inspiring live. The audience totally loves her and she obviously loves playing live. The DVD doesn't really show that as it feels slightly over  produced and music-video like. Having said all that, she is luminous to  watch and the 5.1 sound didn't sound too compressed on my system. The  editing between tracks was a little sloppy and the navigation was difficult  especially during the interview. The sync was definately out, too. Choosing  Logic 7 seemed to balance the sound. Fabulous!",948585600,,565,4.84375
1245919,5,B00001ODGH,"No matter what people say, the sound on this DVD is great.  The picture quality also is outstanding.  Good menus and extra's round out this DVD and make it worthy of the format unlike some other music DVD's (Paul Simon  comes to mind).  A must for any Sarah fan.",947289600,,262,4.285714285714286
1245920,5,B00001ODGH,"I just finished reviewing the cd of Mirrorball, and I figured I might as well review the video as well.  As for the technical problems other people mentioned, I didn't notice them, and if they do so exist, I don't really  care because I wanted the video for the music.  True, some of the versions  of the songs are not the exact same recordings as on the cd, but then  again, every single concert Sarah performed at did not sound exactly the  same.  As I said before, it doesn't matter to me!  Sarah is awesome and so  is the video!  I wouldn't know about the DVD because I don't have it, but  I'm sure that the bonuses are great.  I was very, very excited to find that  two of my favorite Sarah songs, Witness and I Will Not Forget You were  included the video.  I kind of missed them on the cd.  If you like the  Mirrorball cd, you will love the video.",946339200,,854,4.141104294478527
1245921,2,B00001ODGH,"After buying the Mirrorball CD and being totally impressed, and as Sarah has not done a concert tour of Australia, I was really looking forward to this DVD. Sadly I was bitterly dissapointed. The audio leaves a lot to be  desired, and is obviously *not* the same live  tracks as presented on the  CD. The audio is noticeably out of sync to the video in every song, in fact  some of the tracks don't even sound live, its like they took the studio CD  sound and added it to the video.
Dissapointed.",946339200,,496,4.3478260869565215

1245923,4,B00001ODGH,"Sarah McLachlan's Mirrorball DVD is a must have for any of her fans with a DVD player.  It captures the beauty and passion of her live show as well as the dynamics of the band and how well they work together. The clarity of  the DVD makes you feel like you are there.  The DVD also has decent extras,  the interview is a nice addition, the bonus angles and photos are a fun  novelty but I really wouldn't miss them if the weren't included.  I have  experienced the audio problems that other people have mentioned, I tried to  adjust the speakers but nothing seemed to help much. I was going to give 5  stars but I think it should get a 4 and a half due to the audio problems.  Worth the money.",946252800,,693,4.142857142857143
1245924,5,B00001ODGH,"One word comes to mind after watching this DVD:  WOW!  This video/DVD offers nine tracks not included on the Mirrorball cd.  As soon as Sarah and her band begin the opening notes of Building A Mystery, the audience and  anyone watching this concert is stunned by her beauty and talent.  Sarah's  voice is beautiful, especially on the spine-tingling Fear.  Sarah and her  band have a great chemistry and love for music that is so rare today.  Also, the interview footage of her reveals a very down-to-earth and classy  woman who definately has not let her success go to her head.",945734400,4,578,4.69
1245925,5,B00001ODGH,"I was fortunate enough to attend a Sarah McLachlan concert from the same tour of the video (a couple months before the video was made) and this DVD has captured some of the feel and energy of a Sarah concert.  If you have  never seen this amazing woman live and have only heard her studio music you  miss the essential Sarah.  The sound quality and cinematography are  excellent.  As a Sarah McLachlan fan I highly recommend it.  If you are not  a fan, but love good music, I also highly recommend you give it a try.",945561600,3,516,4.302083333333333
1245926,5,B00001ODGH,"It is been almost a year since the release of the CD version of Mirrorball, and I am still amazed by the CD even now. No surprise that how eager any fans will be thrilled with the DVD version of the event.  Thanks  to the DVD technology, I guess fans are glad to get the full version of the  event (inculding tracks like ""Plenty"", ""Vox"" and  ""Wait"", that was not released on the CD version). In addition, it  includes an interview segment with Sarah herself.  The word is out...  Sarah is gorgeous - both her talents and charisma. And the only way to  witness is to see it yourself. With the great sense of stage managment and  superb lighting arrangement... Sarah's powerful and emotional performance  makes ""Mirrorball"" a touching and grand visual experience in  times to come.",945388800,,779,4.613138686131387
1245927,4,B00001ODGH,"This is the best Sarah video released to date.  The song selection is perfect [pleasantly surprised to see the inclusion of Vox].  A year ago, my sister DRAGGED me to the Lilith Fair concert.  I walked away a true believer.  Now I have all of Sarah's CD's.  I even made a ""best  of"" Mini-Disc.  People who complain about the audio don't know how to  set up their audio/video options on their receiver.  If you like Sarah, buy  this DVD/VHS/CD.",944092800,,443,4.493670886075949
1245928,5,B00001ODGH,I have yet to experience the problems that a few other have with this dvd.  My 5.1 sounds clear and direct and i haven't any problems w/lyrics sync.  The only part of the dvd that i was disappointed with was the interview.  The cameraman was obviously trying to make an MTV/VH1 type interview and  completly failed.  If you could not pay attention to the camera zooms it  was a good interview.  Sarah sings the songs better than i think i've ever  heard her...,942019200,,460,4.457831325301205
1245929,5,B00001ODGH,"Warning ! Do not watch this concert with your socks on - Ms McLachlan's vibrant, sensual (& barefoot) live concert will surely blow them off!  Stunning visuals & great audio (5.1 surround) add pleasure to the  experience of Sarah's live interpretation of many of her best songs. Even  old favourites such as Vox & Ice are given new dimensions by Sarah  & her band, who were obviously having tremendous fun as well. The  atmosphere generated by an appreciative audience builds nicely throughout  the concert, & for me the highlights were Possession (stunning &  ballsy), Sweet Surrender (sensual) & Angel (emotive). For all who love  Sarah's records, this live performance is a must.",940982400,,682,5.026785714285714
1245930,5,B00001ODGH,"DVD is really good, offers a lot. You get an interview with Sarah, lots of pictures, multiple angles! The price of the dvd is worth it!! add a couple  of bucks over the price of the CD and you have the DVD. What else do you  want!!",940982400,,231,3.893617021276596
1245931,5,B00001ODGH,As an avid Sarah McLachlan fan I am always searching for new albums and such.  When I first bought the Mirrorball CD I listened to it over and over again.  Most of my favorite songs were there.  Then I heard that a Video  collection of the same album was to be released with more music on it.  I  bought it as soon as it was available and never regret the purchase.  It is  definately worth owning.,940723200,,398,4.144736842105263
1245932,5,B00001ODGH,"There is a little gotcha with this DVD, which may be common on other DVDs, but it certainly fooled me. The DVD defaults to ""Stereo"" mode which gives terribly compressed sound if played in Dolby Digital mode. You  have to select ""5.1 surround"" mode in the special features mode,  and then viola! the soundstage opens up and the sound is truly wonderful.  One might question why a DVD defaults to stereo mode or why there is no  warning of this on the packaging. Otherwise, an excellent DVD, by far the  best music DVD released to date in my opinion. Sarah's band, especially  Sean Ashby on guitar, are truly excellent.",939945600,,617,4.614678899082569
1245933,5,B00001ODGH,I purposefully waited on buying the CD in favor of waiting for the DVD to come out.  And I have not been disappointed.  Combining the stellar voice and warm appearance of Sarah McLachlan onto a disc that can be held between  two fingers is absolutely stunning and well worth the months (it feels like  years; perhaps it is years) that we have all waited for this achievement.  And let it also be noted that no other medium than DVD is worthy of Sarah's  talent.  It deserves its preservation on a medium that will capture  visually what her lyrics have already captured in sound.  Hail Sarah!!!  Hail DVD!!!,939859200,,607,4.588785046728972
1245934,2,B00001ODGH,"The concert was captured on film...too bad, it is poorly done. Sound is just as bad. In fact the concert sounds better in Pro-logic then it does in AC-3.

7914551,5,B00001ODGH,"A great late 90s concert video, and a better bargain than the US$15.99 CD (which has fewer songs, albeit different cuts). You can do as I do, just put it in the DVD player and turn off the TV after starting main video. Some nice little extras too, including multiple angle options on some songs. The latter allows you to select one camera for the whole song (e.g. side to side pan, close on Sarah, wide static shot of stage); you can get motion sickness from the constantly-on-the-move camera, but just watching the singer instead of cutting is a nice change of pace.",1426032000,,567,4.514563106796117
