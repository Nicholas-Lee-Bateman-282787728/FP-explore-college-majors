8365736,5,B002DPPH6M,"Heroes is a show that caught me by complete surprise.  Ali Larter of Resident Evil fame, headlines a cast of characters that is dealing with superpowers that they all possess.  These folks in the show are having to learn how to serve humanity,and themselves with their gifts.  Really interesting show that ran from 2006-2010.  Check it out....",1439424000,,343,4.964912280701754

So I Said To Myelf Why Not/In The Next Few Weeks I Got Around To Watching Heroes/and Was Hooked The More I Watched The More I Wanted To Watch/What A Complete Joy//The Acting By All the Cast is Wonderful And they Seemed to grow into what they were acting and Got Better And better as the series went on//And I Must Say That The
scripts for each episode were wonderful SO HATS OFF TO THE Writers//and let's not forget the director who kept this moving and Moving//Needless to say If I Had Payed ten times What I Payed For Heroes It Would Have Been Worth It//I Can't Wait For Season 4 5 6 and I hope It Will Continue For Many Years//So Keep Up The Good Work You People At Heroes//You Really Are The Best/////

Plus, I shopped around.  The price was good and the item qualified for free shipping.  How can you beat that?",1262822400,,279,4.392156862745098
