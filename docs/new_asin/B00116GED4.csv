A bit of cardio, a bit of strenght (light dumbells, few repetitions),workout for the whole body but not for advanced exercisers. This is for when you are already sore from another workout and need to go lightely on your body. Karen's posture is excellent. I liked the production and the option of doing everything (cardio+strenght+abs+core/back+stretch) in one 50min workout or separately.",1220400000,8,585,7.371428571428571
3060853,2,B00116GED4,"I bought this exercise dvd because I wanted to find a challenging workout that contained cardio, strength, and flexibility options.  While I appreciated that I could adapt the workout into separate, 20-minute ones based on my schedule and that there was a modifier available if I wanted to just do a low-impact routine, I just couldn't get into this dvd.
First, the warm-up semed too short and I still felt ""cold"" when the actual workout began.  Also, I found the cardio boring  because it consisted of lots of jumping, squatting, and rather quick kickboxing moves that were hard for me to follow even though I  just watched the dvd first.  Finally, I found it hard to perform many of the movements without the foam roller that was used in the dvd and thought it would've been nice to see modifications for people who weren't using one.
Overrall, I found Voight's The Complete Sleek Workout to be a disappointment and recommend it only for die-hard Karen Voight fans.",1216252800,17,967,4.766467065868263

8240687,2,B00116GED4,"Despite being 50+ minutes long, I barely broke a sweat with 'Karen Voight: The Complete Sleek Workout'. I agree with the reviewer who said she was still cold after the warm-up -- this workout is just really poorly designed. The exercises are generic and uninspired. The 10 minute intervals were non-committal, as if to say, why bother really getting into it when we'll move onto the next body part within a few minutes? The addition of the foam roller ends up being a hinderance rather than a revelation. Getting yourself in and out of various positions with the foam roller takes time, and prevents working up to any real momentum. This is why there's no sweat, no burn, no pain. I finished the workout with the distinct feeling that I had wasted my time. There are too few reps of each exercise to get any benefit, and there's too much starting and stopping.

Overall, this workout made me feel ripped off and frustrated, because 50+ minutes is a decent investment of my time, to get so little return. I own Karen Voight's Sleek/Sweat/Strength Effect DVDs and they too are a waste of time, unless you're a beginner in your first month of working out, when you just want to get used to the routine of working out regularly. If you have any actual fitness or weight loss goals, don't waste your time with this. It is quite heartbreaking to work out and not see results.",1380844800,2,1369,4.587755102040816
8240688,3,B00116GED4,"I was disappointed. I want to be exhausted when I'm done like with the original 6 Firms or Jari Love, etc. but I never got even close. I'm going to still try the 50 min total body workout sometime but the two 20 min WO's I did today (sweat & strength) were not ""time worthy"" and did not push me to the max!",1343088000,2,306,3.873015873015873
8240689,3,B00116GED4,"I love Karen Voight, but this one is just so-so. I have used her DVDs for more than 10 years. I like how organized she is, and she doesn't have an annoying voice (Denise Austin, hello?). The music on this is dated and it doesn't have any real new routines. Once you've been doing her work-outs, you see similarities in almost all her dvds. I love her Power Yoga and Streamline Fitness DVDs. Much better than this one.",1314576000,2,417,4.358974358974359
8240690,5,B00116GED4,"I love this workout, I wait to give the review more that 30 days because I want it to see the result.  I the true my arms and legs are showing better shape and toning.

Obviously, to have the optimal result I believe is six months.  However, in 30 days you notice if it will work.

I believe if this workout is good for me that I am 55 years old, it will work wonder for a younger person.  Take a while to learn the choreography one week, I never jump I do the modified version, and stil work very good.  I combined the workout with Circuit Training (steps) and Yogasculpt, but I used only The Complete Sleek Workout for two weeks.  (All the workout are from Karen Voight)",1312243200,2,672,4.162790697674419
8240691,5,B00116GED4,Karen Voight has an easy voice to listen too.  The moves can be a little difficult to follow at times but it is worth the effort to learn.  It is a tough workout that will challenge and strengthen you.,1290729600,,201,4.128205128205129
8240692,4,B00116GED4,"I've had this DVD for 2 years now and yes I'm still using it.  It's not explosive high-intensity workout but i think designed to warm you up and dig deep into those muscles and work on strength building.  I used parts of this DVD in my pregnancy (adjusting the movements and exercises) and since having my baby it has been excellent for strengthening everything up again. You do need the foam roller and you can adjust the weights.  I like Karen and would buy more of her DVDs. So, good for those low intensity or low energy days but when you still want to feel like you've workedout.",1288569600,3,584,4.388888888888889
8240693,5,B00116GED4,"The Complete Sleek (aka Sleek II) is a follow-up to the original 3-DVD Sleek Essentials set. As with the original SE, The Complete Sleek takes a ""triple threat"" approach by including cardio, strength training, and flexibility components, with the three combined here for one complete 50-minute workout. Equipment includes dumbbells and a foam roller, a physical therapy aid that is used to assist with balance and core work. This DVD offers each of the three components--Sweat, Strength, and Sleek--as separate 20-minute premixes, and there is also a 20-minute Foam Roller premix containing all of the roller sequences from the main workout.

The Complete Sleek workout starts with a 3.5 minute warm-up. Holding the roller between the hands, Karen gets you moving right away with squats, lunges, side steps, and twists. Sweat is next, and it's more intense and high impact (although low-impact modifications are shown) than the original SE Sweat DVD. The first part has a kickboxing flavor: Karen begins with twists and jabs, and she then builds a standing-in-place combo which includes elbow strikes, a twist and jab to the side, and knee lifts. She then does a front jab/uppercut sequence while traveling front, eventually adding a side-to-side hop. A hamstring curl/knee lift combination finishes out this first section. Karen then does more lateral movements (front-back, side-to-side) which incorporate knees, hops, and puddle jumps; she ends with bunny hops. In the final series, the choreography is a bit more tricky: Karen goes corner-to-corner with 3 knee lifts, but she then changes this to knee-lunge, adding a hop, and then knee-squat. There is another side-to-side movement with a two-footed hop, a jump squat from side-to-side, a side-to-side lunge with hop, and a twisting woodchop move, and then you're done with the cardio after an intense 16.5 minutes.

Strength follows, and it's nicely chaptered into different segments. First, Arms & Legs with heavy weights includes standard moves such as squats, bent over rows, dead lifts, and bicep curls, although the bicep curls add a side twist at the end. Next is Arms & Legs with light weights. These moves are a bit more unique: standing fly, moving to overhead; a single front elbow raise moving to a double arm raise and an ironman in and out; a side delt raise with opposite side leg raise; triceps kickbacks; and finally, a bent over rotator cuff rotation. Following this, you lie on the foam roller for the Chest & Back segment. Karen uses heavy weights and starts by moving the arms side to side, challenging your balance; balance is also an issue in the alternating chest press which follows. Karen then performs skull crushers and pullovers. The next section is Abdominals, and it uses the roller in a variety of positions (under the knees, under the calves, under the feet) for various types of crunches; there is also a move where you roll the roller in and out under your feet. The core work continues with Abdominals & Back, which starts with the roller between the legs for c-curve roll backs and crunches. Lying face down, you will do some arm/leg lifts, eventually using the roller under the hands to arch your back. Core Legs uses the roller for some inner thigh work, side elbow plank, and plank with calves on the roller. Finally, the workout ends with a nice stretch which also utilizes the roller: seated straddle with the roller between the feet, hamstring stretch and seated twist with the roller under one foot, and lunge with one knee on the roller. The actual Total workout time is about 51.5 minutes.

For the premixes, Sweat utilizes the warm-up from the full workout, but the Strength and Sleek premixes have their own unique warm-ups. Actual times for these premix workouts are Sweat, 20 minutes, Strength, 22 minutes, Sleek, 23 minutes, and Roller Basics, 18 minutes.

Overall, this DVD is a nice follow-up to the original SE set, especially for those looking to combine cardio, strength, and flexibility training all into one time efficient workout, and I would rate it 4 1/2 stars.",1280102400,13,4077,5.0
8240694,5,B00116GED4,"This is pretty typical Voight - it's low impact, so this is a good workout for beginner to intermediate.  Advanced may find it not quite challenging enough, but Karen gives power alternatives to the moves.  Karen is never jerky or cheerleader-like, she's not chatty or silly, she always cues you just before she changes a move (some trainers haven't gotten that!), and because of her background, her workouts simply FEEL GOOD.  I'm an advanced exercise, and the cardio portion did make me sweat.  The roller is quite interesting; it's worth getting just for fun. I've got nearly all Karen's workouts, she's a favorite.",1239494400,5,618,4.970873786407767
8240695,5,B00116GED4,"I got this workout when it was on the short-lived infomercial which included the foam roller.  This apparently is a re-mix of those 3 50-minute workouts.  I expected to love the ""Streamline"" workout the best.  To my surprise, my favorite is the ""Sweat"" workout, which includes fun, easy-to-follow kickboxing.  The Streamline workout just seemed a little odd to me, though effective.  Strength is a good solid mix of weight training moves.

I don't use the foam roller when she has you lay on it with the roller in line with your spine; I'm very prone to seasickness, and it makes me queasy.  Otherwise, you use the roller for balance on standing exercises and added range of motion on floor exercises.

If you find you must have something for balance, you can use a 4', 1-1/4"" dia. wood dowel from the hardware store.  Put some cheap rubber cane tips on the ends and you're all set.  For floor dumbbell work, you can substitute a wood 2x4 under your shoulders if you want more range.",1238284800,5,983,4.630057803468208
8240696,5,B00116GED4,"The DVD is well produced and has once again got Karen's excellent cuing and great form. Yes, you do need the foam roller for this workout, but it is a really well worth investment, as Karen shows a lot of different ways of incorporating it into her workout. I especially like the 20 minute preprogrammed options for days when time is tight or when you might like to add sections on to other workouts. The cardio is fun and the toning effective but not too exhausting especially for people like me ,who work out a lot. I want to feel energized after a workout , not completely wiped-out.",1222041600,10,586,4.435185185185185
