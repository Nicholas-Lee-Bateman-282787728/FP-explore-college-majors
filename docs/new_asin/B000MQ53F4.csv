8170610,3,B000MQ53F4,"The description makes the film seem as if it's about the dynamics of the party scene itself. While this topic is discussed in the film, it's more of an ancillary topic that goes to support their main focus of the film. The film itself is not so much about the party scene as it is about Asian-American identity, expressed through NYC's asian night life.",1280361600,,353,4.53125
8170611,5,B000MQ53F4,"For me, this documentary film made its strongest impact after I watched the film.  I thought about it for days afterwards, not only b/c I'm an over-analyzer(!), but also b/c the film deals with such a huge complex issue but did it in a simple fashion.  The storyline and dialogue are both easy-going and unassuming, but yet profound b/c it's so infrequent that you hear from young Asian-Americans talk about their self-identities and relationships w/ the mainstream society in a candid and direct way.  I think the real value for me, is being able to hear things about Koreans or Korean-Americans by other K/A that you just won't hear anywhere else, except in this film and in films like these.  It provides certain clarity and new perspectives about the common experiences of K/A and probably Asian-Americans as a whole.  At the end, I think you learn more about yourself and will probably view Koreatown in a new way. :)",1179878400,,922,4.773584905660377
8170612,5,B000MQ53F4,"You can tell the director's spent a great deal of time and energy in researching this topic.  Although this movie is focused primarily in NY, this occurs in every asian culture around the US, even here in TX.  The movie does a great job showing the behind-the-scenes view of what really goes on in these parties that most people don't realize.  It was an eye-opener and made me sympathize with the main characters struggle in life and acceptance.  I look forward to the director's future projects...",1171584000,,499,4.767441860465116
8170613,5,B000MQ53F4,"The filmmakers, Steven and Francis, hit their mark with their debut film, Party. Party unpacks the ""Asian"" party scene in New York city.  We enter the exclusive clubs, meet the people, and learn about their lives and motivations.  Amidst this dizzying introduction to a scene of which most non-Asians are unaware, some partygoers reveal startlingly candid feelings about why come those these parties, what they're seeking, and many comment on their place as an Asian minority in America.  The results are often unexpected and fracture many of our preconceived notions.  Still, one parent, an immigrant from the 60s, remarks, ""nothing much has changed, as far as I can see.""  Others are more banal and some appear even quite sad and pathetic.  All in all, the filmmakers don't make any judgments but neither do they pull any punches.  Everything is exposed, warts and all.

The cinematography, editing, score are uniformly excellent.  Sometimes, I couldn't believe that this was their first film.  I hear they are currently in production on their next film, a feature film set in New York city.  If Party is any indication, these guys have a good future ahead of them.",1171497600,,1167,4.994818652849741
8170614,4,B000MQ53F4,"The striking elements of this film, besides the sheer skillfulness of it's photography, are its narratives.  It focuses  on a few individuals and shares their stories against the backdrop of interesting questions about ethnicity, class, community, and identity.  This film connects at an emotional level evoking a powerful response.",1171497600,,332,5.73469387755102
8170615,4,B000MQ53F4,"While this may be Hahn and Hsueh's first foray into filmmaking, PARTY hardly comes across as an amateur effort. The subject matter, interviews, cinematography, original music and editing of this documentary kept me interested throughout. Documenting a piece of the party scene for Korean and Chinese Americans in New York, PARTY explores a topic that I believe has not been covered in documentary film. It was enlightening and interesting for me as an individual who has not experienced this world. For those at the screening I attended who *are* familiar with the scene, it clearly struck a chord (for better and for worse), a mark of a worthwhile work of art.",1171411200,,661,4.963963963963964
8170616,5,B000MQ53F4,"There are many similarities to the asian american experience to the Hispanic experience: Shame, feeling like you live in two worlds, and some infrequent difficulting relating to the ""outsider."" This film is a great teaching tool for racial reconciliation, and to get to know your culture of your asian american neighbors. I can't wait till Hsueh and Hahn's next film!!!!",1171411200,,370,5.183333333333334
8170617,5,B000MQ53F4,This is a very engaging documentary exploring the Asian American culture (specifially Korean American and Chinese American) through the lens of parties.,1171411200,,152,5.954545454545454
8170618,5,B000MQ53F4,Party is a really interesting and artistic movie about the asian-american experience in the US.  The themes of displacement and finding yourself more fully in your cultural community are far reaching and can be applied and understood by more than the asian american community. Definitely worth the watch!,1171411200,,304,5.333333333333333
8170619,4,B000MQ53F4,"My attention span is not impressive.  Most documentaries and cinematic stabs at intellect and insight bore the piss out of me; so it's worth noting that I saw this film at a screening and returned to purchase the DVD.

It's a very impressive effort for a couple of first-time filmakers (I'm sure we'll see more from them).  The visuals and the soundtrack are stunning for a low budget film (in fact, I like to play the movie as background distraction when I entertain).  Beyond that, substantively it's a worthwhile exploration of the Korean and Chinese American social scene in New York.  As a white guy, it gave me insight and understanding that I would never gleen for myself, even living in NYC and being open minded.  I simply would not have the access.

Interviews are very good, but one seems to drift a bit too long midmovie.  Through Helen's (especially) perspective one can understand the complicated layers and intersection of youth, Korean American culture in a big city, coming of age, and what seems like a condemnation to isolation, at least to some extent.  Definitely worth watching.",1170979200,,1100,4.839572192513369
