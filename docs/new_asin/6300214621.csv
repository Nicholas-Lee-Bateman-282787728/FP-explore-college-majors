280989,5,6300214621,"Wow, I can't believe that only 4 people reviewed this movie so far. For some reason, this movie is sadly overlooked which is too bad because it's John Candy's best film. It's just a tad corny but hey... it was the 80's  (the era of The Breakfast Club and Lucas). Anyone who's been on vacation at  a beach can relate to Candy's problems. From getting VERY bad sunburn to  getting a dump for a summer house; from getting a cast on your broken leg  to meeting a really rude local. It's a great family film and will make you  giggle alot and never goes on for more than it actually has to.",947116800,3,585,4.1875

After the Family gets there it is so loud that you have to yell what you want to eat and do and it's a public place for people to get to the beach on the sidewalk where there staying at ( after they went to the wrong place.) Kerri Green is SO HOT and SO SEXY wearing her 2 Piece BathingSuit ( and everything else she wears.) John Candy looks so much thinner in this movie and it's so sad that John Candy had a Weight Issue because he died so young with his Weight Problem!!!:( John's Legacy Will live on Forever because he's Very Funny in this Movie which has a lot of heart and Funny Scene's and I'm Glad that I have this to own on DVD!!!:),1473379200,,843,4.023809523809524

Have fun!,1471910400,,308,3.903225806451613
281262,5,6300214621,"I'm not a guy who likes to live in the 'wish it is the way it was' mindset, but this is a great old school movie that doesn't particularly go anywhere for the first 60% of the movie - just a series of funny events while this family is on vacation.
Then the last 30% of the movie concentrates on challenging the jerky permanent residents of the vacation town to save the rest of the summer for Candy's family.

All around feel good movie, good to watch for a nostalgic hit on movie night.",1471132800,2,487,4.180851063829787

Some scenes are classics, such as the one where the neighbor woman is eager to show off her new breasts. It follows the common theme of many 1980s comedies of the ""slobs versus the snobs"" or the common folk against the wealthy people who believe that they own the world. This is s cute comedy that my daughters enjoyed as children back in 1985 (at the beach when we first went to the movie house to see this movie) and I still enjoy. John Candy is a comedic genius and is missed. The dog, Archie is a gem.",1466380800,,632,4.188524590163935

281959,3,6300214621,"I enjoyed the story of a man in need of some time to relax and what better way to relax than a Oceanside vacation, right?  The main story revolved around John Candy's character who decided it was time for some away time with the family - so off to Florida it was.  And that was really where the story picks up as the family meets various characters in the neighborhood and around town.  I'm trying to be perfectly vague.  It was good to see this and I'm just sorry to see that it was John Candy's last film. :(",1461888000,,510,4.121212121212121

281961,5,6300214621,"Classic John Candy comedy. Candy and his family are the out of town tourists coming in and taking over the town in search of relaxation. They find they must fight the locals and try to find a way to become part of community, just to belong. Candy is always getting into situations that make you laugh in hopes he finds his way.

Its laid back movie on the shores of St Pete Beach, Sunset Beach, and Redington Shores on the Gulf of Mexico in Florida. Beautiful warm waters of the Gulf and memories of institutions long pass like the Lobster Pot, where John and his family meet the locals and lock horns, closed years ago. The rental properties have long been remodeled or rebuilt. The Theater scene was filmed at the Beach Theater in St Pete Beach. It closed back in 2012. Scully's as named in the movie is Billy's Stone Crab in T.  This movie is a great Saturday or Sunday afternoon movie that makes you feel good.",1461801600,,914,4.402366863905326

Just go with it, enjoyed the movie for a few good hard laughs and some lighter ones at that, not his strongest but worthy to pay homage to the late Mr. Candy.",1459296000,,541,4.161904761904762

Sure, it's not the greatest movie ever made and it's not even the best John Candy movie (that would be Planes, Trains and Automobiles), but it's John Candy doing what he does best.  In fact, It's hard to imagine anyone other than John Candy playing Jack Chester, and it's doubtful any other actor of the day could have made Jack Chester so endearing.  The rest of the cast is up-to-task as well, and Richard Crenna plays the self-important Al Pellet to a tee.
In all, a nice and predictable fluff comedy for a sick day or rainy afternoon.",1459123200,3,560,4.470588235294118

John Candy is, as always, a lot of fun to watch and Rip Torn is a perfect complement to him. A great summer film (or a good winter's escape).

282831,4,6300214621,"John Candy plays Jack Chester, a burnout air traffic controller in 1985s Summer Rental, where he takes his family to the beaches of St. Petersburg for some r & r. While the family has fun, they also clash with a champion yachtsman (Richard Crenna) and settle their differences in a sailboat race.

Candys always good as a comedic every-man and Karen Austin and Kerri Green shine as female eye candy (so you get the best of both worlds  older babe and younger babe, lol). The first half features the expected beach vacation antics while the second half focuses on the yacht race.  Rip Torn plays the pirate-like companion that helps Chester compete. The film delivers just enough amusement for this kind of flick to give a marginal thumbs up.

The film runs 87 minutes and was shot in the St. Petersburg area with the opening scenes in Atlanta.

GRADE: B- (or a weak 4/5 Stars)",1427846400,,876,4.625806451612903

282834,4,6300214621,John Candy shines as a patient overworked family man. Not many movies show fathers as funny and compassionate and so loving. It's a good family movie with laughs. Rip Torn casted as Scully the pirate is believable and his performance is terrific. Richard Crenna plays the intolerable sailor sick of the summer renter. Overall the story is thin but the meat on Candy alone makes the movie shine with enough weight to pull it through. Pleased with this forgotten flick!,1427068800,,467,4.85

283547,5,6300214621,"When I first saw this movie I thought it would be about a construction of a house during summer. I was very wrong! ""Summer Rental"" is a great funny movie! It really shows the bonding (and annoying but funny) family matters on a supposed to be vacation, but ends as a night mare!

When I first sat down to watch this movie I was thinking what was the point of this movie? I kept watching it hoping something big would happen and it did! A lot of exiting and funny scenes are coming your way.

The ""epic vacation"" starts when a guy with a normal family, normal life, normal day has quite a bad start at work where he directs planes that are landing. On the way to work he meets some rude drivers and to top that, one guy parks way too close to him. Not a very good day at work and his boss forces him to take a vacation. This ""vacation"" has lots of problems for the guy whose name is Jack and a few problems for his family. But there are number of exciting events on this vacation.

This movie is very funny and has a lot of lessons you can learn from it. That's all nice but there are a lot of inappropriate scenes in this movie as well a bit of inappropriate language. This movie may be funny to adults and teens but it's not geared for younger kids. The jokes are more geared for adults as well. I have to say my favorite scene is when Jack and his son go sailing but fail miserably. They make a hole in a much bigger boat and make an enemy as well. His son asks if his dad is ok, because Jack hits his leg badly and then the boy stands up for his father. This scene demonstrates how close those two are

I recommend this to ages 13 to 18. There are just a few minor items where I would add a bit more clarification but overall it's a great film so I would give it 5 out 5 stars. Reviewed by Gerry O., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic",1375315200,,1826,4.008241758241758

You can definitely tell it's from the 80's! Just one funny thing that happens is his family mistakenly stays at first in a really nice beach house, until the actual family that lives there comes home. When they finally move to the right address, the house is about 10x worse looking. To make things worse, they are right next to the path from the beach, so they get all the beach traffic too. Another funny event is when John Candy's character and his family go to a nice seafood restaurant and end up waiting over an hour for a table, only to have a rich guy come in and take their table and the last lobsters in the tank.

It's obvious this man needs a vacation, so he & his family high-tail it down to Florida, where our air-traffic controller & family rent the house of their dreams, a first stop along their journey of a delightful vacation, right? WRONG! Due to a mix-up regarding the address, the family moves to a small house on the beach - a public beach! Next thing we know, this man & his family are bombarded by beachgoers, thus having problems in securing any hope of any semblance of peace & quiet. Add to this difficult journey an obnoxious, country club member who's also a seafarer (Played by Richard Crenna), who challenges our air-traffic controller to a yacht race, & the winner is...you'll just have to find out for yourself by picking up a copy of 1985's hottest movie - ""Summer Rental"" on DVD today!

Though the video quality is somewhat better than the standard definition (DVD) release, it appears to be up-scaled video rather than an authentic new transfer.  It's hard to say, though the video quality seems a bit sub-par to the version available through Netflix streaming.

I have nothing against candy softening his image for a mass audience as he demonstrated so masterfully in ""Uncle Buck"" but there's no reason to appear in a flick that is so insignificant and forgettable.  Virtually nothing works here.  The antagonism between Candy's ""renter"" and Richard Crenna's yachtsman goes nowhere.  A possible dalliance between Candy's wife(Karen Austin) and John Larroquette's character is suggested but is dropped like a hot potato.  The sole reason to see this flick is the performance of Rip Torn as a salty nautical type.  Do yourself a favor and rent National Lampoon's Vacation"" instead.

If a box set ever came out of some of the greatest films he did, Summer Rental would be right there alongside Great Outdoors, and Uncle Buck, and Plains, Trains, & Automobiles. Candy in my opinion was always a great portrayer of a Father and family man. He provides great comedic laughs for his character, and the mishaps that bombard him. Rip Torn provides a great piratey good time with his character. All around good fun for the family too watch. Movies like this are few and far between.

As a way to both decompress and spend time with his family, Chester takes them to a Florida resort. Things immediately go wrong: their supposedly beautiful beach rental turns out to be a delapidated shack. Jack falls asleep and fries to a crisp in the subtropical sun.

Great performances by Candy, Crenna, and Rip Torn. I have only one problem with the movie....there is a great song by Jimmy Buffett called ""Turning Around"" which is featured in full as the credits roll, but the song is not available. I am a Buffett fan, but I have never seen the song in any recorded form, and there seems to be no ""Summer Rental"" soundtrack. It's frustrating to watch the movie, hear the song, and not be able to buy the song anywhere. Why Buffett never released it is beyond me.

283939,5,6300214621,"By MW, I mean, ""Most Watchable"".  This is one of those films which I love having in my collection.  I rank it very high, not necessarily for the same reason as other films.  I am not saying that it is the best performances you'll ever see - or the best writing - or the best direction, cinematography, editing, etc.  It's not ""Oscar"" worthy.

But then again, there are many ""Oscar"" worthy films that I was delighted to see on the opening weekend in the theatre, but am not in a hurry to purchase on DVD.  Some of these, while excellent quality films, and great to see once, do not have what I refer to as ""watchability"".

A ""MW"" film is one that is great for it's pure entertainment value.  Likeable characters.  Fun and interesting and endearing performances.  Clever and witty dialog that seemingly gets better with time.  A film that is like visiting an old friend (if you don't mind me getting a bit cliche, myself).

Anyway, Summer Rental, is one of those MW films.  For me it is one of the top 5 or 10 in that category - especially among comedies.  I just never get tired of watching it.  And after having seen it, I feel like I've been on a vacation, which is a rare treat.",1118361600,2,1180,4.324200913242009
283940,4,6300214621,"When John Candy had his moments, they were usually very good moments.  Such is the case with ""Summer Rental,"" where John Candy plays air traffic controller Jack Chester.  As everyone knows, air traffic controllers lead a stressful life, and all Jack is looking forward to is getting away from it all.

We can tell from the outset that getting away is going to be difficult.  Children Jennifer (Kerri Green, who starred the same year in ""Goonies"" and the following year in ""Lucas"") and Bobby (Joey or Joseph Lawrence) are fighting in the car during the trip to the beach.  Once at the beach things get difficult.  Their stuckup landlord does not like either Jack or his family, and tries to boot them out.  Jack thinks he is going to get killed when pretty neighbor Vicki Sanders (Lois Hamilton) asks him to feel how real her augmentation is and husband Ed (Carmine Caridi) walks in.  Fortunately Vicki has been doing that a lot and Ed takes it in stride.  However, clutzy Jack also ends up breaking a leg.  With all this action it seems that things are unable to get worse, which means they do.

Al Pellet (Richard Crenna) has agreed to race them, in a regatta.  If they win the race they can stay in the rental.  If they lose, they must leave.  At long last the Chester family pulls together, with help from Scully (Rip Torn) and a bizarre crew.  The group turns a restaurant into a real ship, barely making the race in time.

The joy of this movie is the last half hour.  There are short moments where the movie slows a bit, but in general the pace in the last half hour is quick.  In light comedies of this type, it is the ending where all the issues are resolved and everyone, except for the jerks, come out ahead.

John Candy generally ends up as the straight man in this movie.  The funny parts are what happens to John more than what John says.  John performs well in this movie, which was his first as the star.

Other than the brief scene with the breast augmentation, where the exposed portions stay out of camera view, this movie is somewhat family friendly.  I would feel comfortable with children in elementary school watching this.

This film is a winner and well worth having in a collection of comedy or family films.",1115424000,16,2233,4.483870967741935

He had a subtle way about him and a sincere approach.  This comedy, expertly directed by Carl Reiner, showcases his talent, and is a genuinely funny, funny movie.  Not as funny as his role in ""Spaceballs,"" but just as much fun as ""Uncle Buck,"" another Candy film that is nearly a classic.",1106352000,,434,4.2560975609756095
283943,4,6300214621,"The plot here really doesn't matter; it's pretty predictable.  This is a film that is enjoyable primarily because of the very funny and capable John Candy.  Candy plays a harried air traffic controller, Jack Chester, who takes his family to Florida for a well-deserved rest.  Of course, everything goes wrong.
Candy is at the top of his game here.  He plays a likeable family man who feels that everything that goes wrong is his fault.  He tends to take everything personally, and even though sometimes everything just goes wrong, he's not the author of all the mishaps.
He makes a turnaround when he meets the very funny Rip Torn, who plays Scully, a bar owner, sailor, and one-handed guy.  The scene where Candy gets drunk and plays a very haphazard game of darts is hilarious (one dart hits the ceiling fan, another a barometer).  Scully decides to show Jack Chester that he can succeed, and teaches him to sail.  This leads to the climax race against the rich and smarmy Richard Crenna, who has a beautiful boat and a crack sailing team.  Chester is in the race of his life, but he has a trick up his sleeve (so to speak).
I'll not reveal the outcome of the race, but suffice it to say, Jack Chester does OK.
Recommended if you want to laugh, enjoy yourself, and have a satisfying film-watching experience.  I did.",1082246400,,1318,4.594017094017094
283944,5,6300214621,"John Candy does an outstanding job in this movie, playing the part of Jack Chester, a burned out traffic controller who desperately needs a relaxing vacation.  Too bad he doesn't get one!
Taking his family to Florida, he does not know the cabin he has rented is right next door to a public walk leading to the beach.
Living in Florida, I certainly know how busy those walks can be, and that only heightened the laughter for me, as Jack had to deal with 'walkers' everyday, who wanted a glass of water or to use the bathroom.  Good Lord!
Add to that a budding teenage daughter, a neighbor who wants to show off her new 'breasts' and rich jerks who think they own the Florida beaches (oh yes,I have seen them as well).
This all adds up to a great movie, one that you will watch time and time again. Outstanding!",1073347200,33,809,4.3509933774834435
283945,5,6300214621,"This movie was so funny! This was John Candy's first leading role was in this film by Carl Reiner, in which the comic actor played a stressed-out air traffic controller who takes his family on a Florida vacation and has to deal with arrogant, rich jerks. Candy is good in what is almost a straight part and Reiner keeps the tone in check so his star has an opportunity to show more than one dimension. Summer Rental is great, but it could still be much better. It is so funny, and all the jokes work, and his daughter in this movie is so HOT! You must see this movie. John Candy's just pure funny, an it...that he isn't with us anymore. Oh well at least Jim Carrey is still around.",1052092800,,681,4.246153846153846
283986,5,6300214621,"Being a huge John Candy fan, I have to say that this is one of his best! Along with Uncle Buck, Once upon a crime and Armed&dangerous this one of John's that I've seen the most. Probably more than a hunderd times, and it's still funny.
I especially like the scene in which he threatens a guy, who's watching the smurfs in his house.(""have you seen the episode in which papa smurf beats the pooh (censored) out of a fat guy with a red hat?""; hilarious!)or the scene in which a lot of people walk along the window of his house, and he asks this guy why everybody keeps passing his window, and the guy just burps in his face and points to the -to public beach-sign as an answer.
The popcorn-chocking scene is also great and of course the scene in which his neighbour asks him how her breast look.
But there are so many hilarious scenes, I can only say WATCH THIS MOVIE!!",1046217600,3,867,4.260606060606061
283987,4,6300214621,"I thought this movie was pretty good.  I am a huge John Candy fan, so I will like pretty much anything with him in it.  I don't think he really had a chance to shine in this one.
John Candy works as an air traffic controller.  He works too hard and has to take a trip to Florida to cool off.  His first day there he becomes arch enemies with the local snob sailboat captain.  With a setup like this, it is inevitable that he have to defeat the snob captain in a sailboat race.
This movie is pretty predictable stuff, in my opinion.  If you want maximum John Candy try Planes, Trains, and Automobiles or Uncle Buck.  If you want a vacation movie, try National Lampoon's Vacation, or another good John Candy flick, The Great Outdoors.  I find all of these more satisfying than Summer Rental, but I think Summer Rental is still worth watching.",1015113600,,840,4.339743589743589
283988,4,6300214621,"Not quite five stars. I really like John Candy. Too bad he is gone forever. He had so much going for him. His characters in all of his films were so believable and likable.
This film is just another good example of his skills. I can't imagine if there was another actor that could have brought this movie off like he did.
I'm not going to give the plot of this one away. I just want to say this is a good film. Very funny to watch Candy in a family environment as a regular guy going to the beach on vacation.",1009324800,4,509,4.0
283989,3,6300214621,"This is one of my boyfriend's favorite movies and I have grown fond of it as well. It isn't the kind of movie that has you busting out laughing, but it puts a smile on your face and leaves you happy. The music is uplifting and the whole movie has a mellow tone, but I never considered it ""slow"" as some have.
I do have one issue with this movie, for which the lack of information is driving me crazy:
Am I the only person in the world to notice that there are scenes deleted from the pay channel, VHS and DVD versions? If you watch it on basic cable there are several scenes NOT found in the ""uncut"" (no commercials) versions:
1) On the drive down to Florida, they have fast food in the car, and feed the dog Archie the onion rings, who then has terrible gas
2) When they are in the wrong rental house the dog is continually shown chewing on the legs of the couch instead of the bones he is being offered by John Candy
3) Right after they leave the wrong house and the rightful owners sigh with relief, the couch falls over as a result of the dog chewing on the legs (they break)
Does Columbia Pictures have something against this dog? I thought those scenes added to the enjoyment of the film! I have purchased and returned the VHS and DVD versions, each time excited to be able to see the entire movie uncut.
If you're reading this, powers that can, please release a special edition with ALL the scenes!!!",1001116800,49,1407,4.234200743494424
283990,3,6300214621,"At 86 minutes and half a dozen subplots not being wrapped up or developed in any way at all. For example the subplot involving John Larroquette is never given the chance to become anything. His whole presence in the movie is totally pointless and I suspect there was a whole ""Candy's wife may be cheating on him"" plot that was cut out because it just too similar Chase/D'Angelo in Vacation.

We never know what happens to Richard Crenna or Rip Torn after the Regatta and we never know how the rest of the Summer Rental went. It's like the writers knew there was no plot, chucked in this Regatta crap and thought that would be a good place to end the film when it's over. And what was wrong with the popcorn Candy and Crenna eat? I found that pretty weird.

Although I have already made comparisons to Vacation I still feel like this film is good enough without being a copycat movie. It's seems more realistic and doesn't have any slapstick humor. Candy feels more like a real guy who needs a real vacation. We want him to relax but still can't help laughing when everything goes wrong. My fave scene is when he returns home to find it transformed into some kind of free-for-all Funhouse.

But for a film set in Florida there is a huge lack of nice scenery and the photography isn't so cool. I wonder why Kerri Green (who starred in The Goonies the same year) never made another mainstream movie tho. Joey Laurence did so why not her?

If you like comedies, but hate the scatological humor that most present day comedies have, then this is a good enough escape. I miss John Candy and wish he made more movies before he died.

The DVD has no features other than a trailer, is in utterly terrible Mono and is undermatted at 1.78:1 instead of the theatrical 1.85:1.",990489600,9,1762,4.442724458204334

283995,4,6300214621,"A great John Candy vehicle. While ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" satirised everything that can go wrong while travelling, ""Summer Rental"" satirises everything that can go wrong while on  vacation - going to the wrong beachhouse, sunburn, crowded restaurants,  hostile neighbours etc. The film is a pleasant, lightweight concoction  which uses Candy's acting style to good advantage. Candy would later show  more depth of character in better scripted films (Only The Lonely etc) but  he's in fine form here also.",949363200,7,513,5.443037974683544
