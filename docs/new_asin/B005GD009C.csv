4690385,5,B005GD009C,"bought this for our young son after watching some previews online. Buck Denver does not disappoint. All the characters, puppets and animation are extremely professional and well done. Volume One and Two (all we have in our collection so far) give a lot of church history, which we also love. Our son loves ""Chuckwagon"" the singing cowboy best and we have been very impressed with the amount of info our son has already retained. We will be purchasing the rest of the DVD's over time.",1453334400,,483,4.694117647058824

4690388,5,B005GD009C,I'm actually starting a second set of the whole series because it's such a fun and interesting way for my grandkids to walk through the Bible. The second group of younger grandkids don't attend Christian school so I feel this series is an important learning tool in their growing up years. I enjoy watching it with them too!,1450569600,,324,4.603448275862069

Phil Vischer is a real blessing, he really makes quality programmes and we go back to this and VeggieTales again and again. Highly recommend for the whole family, it's not dumbed down at all but accessible for all.",1440028800,,311,4.379310344827586
4690394,5,B005GD009C,"If you thought learning the Bible was boring, you haven't seen Phil Vischer's current work.  In this volume, which is the first one I bought, he covers two topics in a fast paced and interesting manner that held the attention of a 5yo and a 12yo and this adult!  This series is well done with both puppets and live action that hold kids' attention and provides great Bible information.

4690400,5,B005GD009C,"The primary idea behind the series is to give an overview of the Bible in 13 DVDs.  As you might expect, we don't get into too many specifics.  This is a broad stroke outline of the Bible.  Giant puppets are used to covey the lessons, with news reporter Buck Denver as our master of ceremonies.  Most of the content comes from Sunday School Lady with other characters like a priest and a pastor showing up to help explain things and a few other characters to ask questions.  Even Phil spends some time in front of the camera to explain the really important things.

The first video covered the first 11 chapters of Genesis, so we pick up here with the rest of Genesis and all of Exodus.  The video breaks the hour length into two shorter episodes, and the first of those finishes off Genesis.  We get God calling Abram to the Promised Land, a very brief mention of Isaac, and enough of Joseph's story to learn why the Children of Israel went down to Egypt.  I told you it was brief.

Episode two covers Exodus, focusing most of the time on Moses' early life and the plagues on Egypt.  When we get to the story of Israel building and worshipping the Golden Calf, the parallel is made to things we make idols in our lives today.

The videos are also trying to show how these stories fit into the big picture of the Bible, the story of God's plan to free us from sin.  These aren't just some dry stories out of context but shown to be part of something greater.

The secondary purpose of these videos is to give the audience some basic knowledge about how we got the Bible and theology.  To do that, the first episode talks about how the books of the Bible were chosen, both Old and New Testament.  They even take some pretty serious swipes at The Da Vinci Code here.  While the second episode was supposed to talk about Salvation and Redemption, most of that was in episode one as well.  They do a great job of explaining the terms and then give us examples of a brother and sister in a boat to fully illustrate them.

None of this is done in a dry manner.  With so many characters popping in and out, there are plenty of interruptions for humor or questions.  Naturally, things keep moving, but it is well thought through enough that you get the information you need without being bored once.

Of course, these aren't intended to be a complete course in every detail of the Bible.  They do make a great foundation for further family devotions and discussion.  I highly suggest that parents watch them at least once with their kids.  You'll learn a thing or two and know how to work what your kids learn into your discussions.

Personally, I am loving What's In the Bible?  Now that I've watched Let My People Go, I'll be impatiently waiting for disc 3 in this highly entertaining and informative series.",1429660800,,2802,4.421875
4690401,4,B005GD009C,"Our 10 year old son loved this and learning all this information about the foundation of his faith. It is definitely a lot of information which will be hopefully absorbed with multiple viewings. Though some of the puppetry skits were a bit young for him, in my opinion, he was still entertained and didn't lose attention. Don't expect a Veggie Tales experience though because of the fact that Veggie Tales founder Phil Vischer created this project. There is very little animation, relying mostly on puppetry for physical comedy and effects. It seems very thorough in its biblical content. The structure of the video is well paced with short puppet or Phil Vischer vignettes as the basis of its presentation. I have great respect for Mr. Vischer's resolve to put this information into the elementary foundation of the Christian faith for children. If we can help them to know this truthful support of Christianity as children, they will be better equipped to know what they believe and why and therefore better equipped to explain it to anyone who inquires the reason for their belief.",1429488000,,1084,4.9289617486338795

4690407,5,B005GD009C,"We are using all 13 of the videos as part of a Bible study we are doing with our kids.  We have daily reading from the Bible and discussion questions.  At the end of that week, we pop these in as an overview of what we have just read and the kids love to hear it again and see it played out with fun characters.  My kids love these so much that they watch them even when we aren't doing our study at that time.  They have learned so much about the Bible from these by reinforcing what we have read or studied.  Love these videos.",1423785600,,529,3.952830188679245

4690411,5,B005GD009C,"The first volume in this series covered the separation between God and man.

Volume 2, Let My People Go finishes the book of Genesis, and next covers Exodus, telling how God led His Hebrew people out of Egypt.

Each DVD in this series contains two episodes, 25 minutes each. Each episode also deals with many questions, including one big question. On this disk, those big questions are Who Chose the Books of the Bible? and What is Salvation?

And yes, this is a childrens series. And yet it is good for all ages.

Its worth mentioning that the back cover of all 13 disks in the Whats in the Bible? series has an endorsement by Max Lucado and another by Francis Chan. Lucado has over 100 million books in print, and Chan is also a best-selling author. Both men are pastors.

This episode covers the covenant God made with Abraham and the three promises to him: his descendents would be given land, they would become as numerous as the stars, and one of his descendents would bless all the nations. That last promise we call the Messiah, and who is Jesus, so there is a sense of how the first books of the Old Testament of the Bible point to the Gospels in the New Testament.

Just under one hour long, and a lot is packed into this. I highly recommended it.",1418342400,,1257,4.396551724137931

4690414,3,B005GD009C,"We were very impressed with volume one, however, I was somewhat disappointed with volume two. It's a complicated part of the bible with some heavy subjects and while I believe it's important to teach on these subjects I think could have been addressed in a gentler way. I have a very sensitive three and a half year old who has not been exposed to violent TV and after watching sin stain us, a boy and his sister in peril at sea, that same boy in jail, Egyptians drowning babies (not shown but mentioned and not clearly addressed) the plagues, and the angel of death we were ready for the bonus cartoon. Volume 1 is quacky the duck and learning about kindness. Volume two is a CREEPY old dude telling a story about a headstrong and impatient boy who ends up with a broken model airplane glued to his head and encased in cement and mistaken as a rhinoceros. My son broke down crying and I had to make up an ending where the boy's mommy finds him and gives him a bath and he's alright just to get him to calm down. Seriously inappropriate for young kids. Overall is say that this suddenly went from ""family program"" to ""I wouldn't show this to a kid under 7 or 8"". Some warning would have been nice. Now I have to vet the shows before showing them to my kids.  The teaching is sound and I do appreciate that element, I didn't expect it to be as harsh as it was.",1410998400,,1359,4.2471042471042475

The best part of this that it teaches Biblical truth very clearly in a very lively and interactive way. At times it does seem a little detailed which is fine but probably goes over the kids of those under 7, but doesn't dwell on these moments so keeps the story moving along.

I grew up in Christian Schools and the ""What's In The Bible"" series taught beyond what I learned in K-12.  It doesn't just cover the stories and issues, but also provides background information and clarity on things that kids and Adults might have about the Bible.

This is a sort of puppet variety show, injected with school-age humor, that focuses on teaching not only Biblical stories, but the importance, history, and development of the Bible as well.  Preschool children probably will not understand much of the content, and I would recommend staying with Veggie Tales until they're a bit older.  My kids have already learned so much from the first two ""What's in the Bible"" dvds, that I am eagerly awaiting the arrival of the next four in the mail.

Coming from someone who spent years studying at a well known Bible college, I can attest that it is loaded with clear, accurate and understandable doctrine. It also very clearly explains the plan of salvation and our need for salvation as humans in a way a child can easily understand.

So far I have only purchased the first 2 volumes which brings us through creation, the exodus from Egypt, Bible layout and church history and weaves salvation throughout the story. I will definitely be getting the following volumes as she grows. Right now she loves watching the same episodes over and over which is perfectly fine when she is memorizing such critical content as this!",1494374400,,1063,4.648936170212766
