8628435,5,B00GXHO046,"I always have to grin when I read reviews of these type of films where statements such as ""everyone in the entire movie was unappealing"" or ""I found it unexciting"" are made. It's hard to believe that these old ad campaigns are looping in the raincoat crowd at all, much less than that we may have gotten any evidence that they still exist.

Not that I'm trying to intellectualize Z-grade cinema, but I wouldn't be amazed if college courses are taught on this stuff and there may even be a few museum presentations on them in the future (full disclosure is that I'm not exactly mister nose-on-the-news myself, so this may already be occurring).

Personally, I put these films into context of what was happening in the world and/or country at the time, a pattern that i learned from studying the Film Noir genre. I realize some may find that statement pretentious and perhaps more than a little preposterous, but at this late date I find these movies fascinating (sociologically) and at times, absurdly hilarious; which I doubt was the intention of the filmmakers.

""Judy!"" tries hard (but in my opinion, gratefully fails) to be a ""roughie"", however this freed the plot and acting up to send my braincells into the sonic reducer factory contained within the sacred schlock-cosmos. That's right, I rid myself of much unnecessary brain-clutter, and you can tew. Bonus points for this being a detective-based story, as I love this genre mixed with almost any other recipe. Results may vary.

""The Night Hustlers"" was just a laugh-riot from second-one of the running time, completely jaw-dropping ridiculousness of that special variety so low in supply nowadays. The French ""accents"" have to be heard to be believed, and the vignettes just keep getting more mind-liquifying (the memory of 2 men attempting to climb up a greased pole is still making me laugh as I type this).

The bottom line? Everyone in these movies ARE unappealing, but that just makes them all the more appealing to me. If you too have found monotony with all the air-brushed phoniness found in abundance via the impossible-to-comprehend budgeted whatchamacallits of the modern age, then who could ask for anything more?",1517443200,,2184,4.923913043478261
