I especially like the ones where they take medical stuff (like the effect of cholesterol on the body, or fat in the blood, or consuming diet of x% dairy turns cancer on/ off) and explain it simply, and with graphics.

The packaging is a normal sized DVD case with good, sturdy plastic: two on a swinging insert and one on the back cover (ie, DVDs do not overlap).

I prefer to buy the DVD ... which I can keep as a reference ... than to attend the actual convention, although certainly many do both.

I got the whole kit & kaboodle of archives (2005 to present) for a discount at their website (veg source dot com) but most will want just the most recent edition.",1393891200,2,1519,4.462093862815885
8246905,5,B0012OLI9K,"I'll be shocked if anyone stumbles upon this obscure DVD set at Amazon and reads this review.  I can't remember how I did or what possessed me to buy it.

Imagine my surprise when I decided to give Jeff Novick's food labeling speech a glance and got fascinated.  I thought I understood food labels but couldn't believe what I was hearing, or how he transformed how I think about them.  I loaned the talk to a good doctor friend who put it in her DVD while working around the house to listen to in the background.  It wasn't long before she reacted like me with jaw to her chest, wondering why she hadn't heard this before and thinking of all the things she's told her patients that she wishes she could take back.

A lot of the talks were that way, such as the outstanding talks by Dr. Fuhrman.  These speakers are highly credentialed, this isn't some alternative medicine all-anecdotes no-facts set of talks that make your eyes roll in your head.

We formed a healthy eating group at our home that meets every week and these are among the talks we show.  Our group of 20 loves them (well, most of them). Our friends who attend are mostly professional, highly educated people from schools like Stanford.  They all arrived skeptical, but most of use have transformed our health without having to turn to Lipitor and the normal course of meds, after watching these talks.  This will sound bizarre and exaggerated, but probably 400-ish people on my photography forum are eating this way and have transformed their health as well.

Hahaha, I feel like I'm typing in an empty room where no one will ever peek inside.",1256774400,34,1611,4.574912891986063
