4208750,4,B003VB5E2E,I was at the concert and saw the 2 hr movie release. So little BB King was actually a blessing he did very little playing at the concert and mostly talked. The young dude with Buddy Guy and Ron Wood was Jonny Lang he has been around since he was a 15 or 16 year old kid. Very talented. I think the DVD will be more enjoyable I own the first 2 and they were excellent!,1280448000,4,367,3.8421052631578947
4208751,4,B003VB5E2E,"I saw the 2hr version in the theater and was very imppressed. It was a little long to sit through all at once -- that is why the DVD will be nice as you can watch it at your leisure. I thought Doyle bramhall (or whatever his name was), was very good. He added a different feel to the show -- a little more energy. He was perfectly placed in a mix with the older legeneds and John Mayer and the other young dude (who sounded like a 50 year old blues legend) that played with Buddy Guy (who was that guy?! The kid was excellent, but I could hardly watch him, as he was over-enthusuastic. ZZ-top was fun, Jeff Beck was awesome, and Robert Cray was spectacular. Cray is also very animated and is any wonder he can play so well as he shakes all over the place while he jams. Joe Bonamassa was great, but Derek Trucks and Susan Tdeschi stole the show.",1280275200,15,845,4.127272727272727
4208752,4,B003VB5E2E,"I couldn't disagree with the first review more.  I thoroughly enjoyed the 2 hour theatre release.  My big disappointment?  Only 30 seconds of BB King (in the finale).  The DVD is FOUR hours so I hope to see BB King on the DVD.  I am buying this DVD for two brothers, one a percussionist, one a guitarist.  The biggest query I have is about Citizen Cope.  Has Eric Clpton taken him under his wing, although the performer has been around 14 or more years?  ""Cope's"" performance showed a lot of Clapton virtuosity. I also hope the DVD has more 'Ronnie' Wood. ZZ Top can do no wrong. I thoroughly enjoyed the artists I was not familar with, especially the young man playing with Buddy Guy ""Five Long Years.""  I liked the performer and performance ""Chicken in the Kitchen""(Robert Cray?).  The first reviewer- pshaw.  $12.50 is a dinner at Chili's, this concert will satisfactorily stay with me in memory longer than my last meal.  The ""four"" is probably a bit premature because IF the DVD has more Ron Wood and BB King, I will rewrite my review and give it a ""five"".",1280188800,20,1061,4.49738219895288

4208761,2,B003VB5E2E,It was a shame that the mikes weren't on for some of the guitars. These tracks should have been omitted. Why put them in at all. What a waste.,1498953600,,142,3.9310344827586206
4208762,5,B003VB5E2E,"There's enough great stuff here to make it a no brainer 5.  I only listened to the first three tracks in the first disc because the third one was pissing me off.  The second disc really has no low points, though buddy guy looked and sounded about as stoned as a person could be.  All of the guitarists are spectacular except for Guy And Ronnie Wood but even they pull off a few interesting riffs.  Derek trucks and Susan tedeschi are fantastic and then warren Haynes is too.  Jeff beck shines as well.  Then this guy Cutizen cope does a strange but captivating blues song - he appears to be wondering around in  a mental institution and his voice seems to be affected by missing upper teeth.  Jonny Lang also seems fairly insane but boy can he play guitar.  Sanity is not one of clapton's criteria for inclusion.

But the concert really gets great on I shot the sheriff, with Clapton playing about as well as is possible.  Win wood comes out for three great songs and again Clapton is stunningly good. His only weakness is that he plays too much too often so it sounds like he's rambling which he is - but what rambling!

And there's twenty songs I've yet to hear.

The photography is very good too - nothing spectacular but it's blues so you don't want davidbowie4.0, not that it isn't great in his context.  Speaking of which I watched the reality tour DVD next and my god how do these people do it?  I'm a relatively decent musician and in always amazed at the precision and stamina of these people.  Bowie in particular could sing up a storm - I actually thought he was lip singing at one point on Sunday but I saw his Adam's apple moving so he wasn't - but those of us who were blessed to be alive to hear and see these fellows have to believe that there is another layer to this thing called life that extends far beyond it.  These people are imbued with it.

I had to chuckle that Steve win wood looks just like president George Bush the elder.  I keep waiting for him to tell the crowd to read his lips -,no taxes.",1498262400,,2022,4.301587301587301

4208786,5,B003VB5E2E,"I've all the Crossroads Guitar Festival series. I heard all of it for more than 20 times. The Best of all, and the Best of all my DVD's on Blues-Rock - a collection of more than 150 items -, is that one, from the year of 2010. There are 21 highlights here. 21 tracks with the best music you can hear on blues-rock and electric guitar show. One thing is certain, the last track (track number 18 - the DVD started with a track less or more) of the DVD n 2, ""The Thrill is Gone"", is grade A+. They did something here, with that incredible song: B.B. King with all other musicians (an Ensemble) playing all together. Only the best musicians with B.B. King playing for more than 12 minutes. Maybe more minutes. Alone, that song alone would pay the price of the whole DVD (two discs inside). It's a must to hear, to have, and to pay. After finishing my music sessions at home, I put that song to play, and repeat it 4 or 5 times. Nothing is best than the Crossroads Guitar Festival 2010. I'm totally sure about it.",1464480000,3,1008,4.227979274611399

4208888,3,B003VB5E2E,"I know its Clapton, so, I know its going to be Blues.  i realize it is the history of Blues, but, just how many 90 year old blues men can you take.  The beginning of the album is total confusion.  Lots of unrehearsed jammin'  that, often, goes off to ""Never Never Land"".  Many guitarist I have never heard of (and I am a guitar player).  The second DVD is much tighter and with artist that are alive and well - accept for Ronny Wood who has been dead for ten years and no one has, yet, told him.
Actually, ordered the 2013 Crossroads, but got this one.  Way too many artist for the period of time of the DVD (4 1/2 Hours).  Few were able to play more than two cuts with most only playing one.  Clapton is, mostly, in the background for most of the DVD until the end.  Then he does some cool stuff with Jeff Beck and Steve Winwood.  It ends with ""BB King Ensemble"".  The first song is pretty cool with 4 guitarists playing the blues with King.  King, at his age, plays little.  It ends with 30 guitar players on stage jammin' - All trying to play over the other - a fiasco!  Clapton, growing older, is not the guitarist he once was.  You want GREAT GUITAR?  Check out Joe Bonamassa.  He makes a guitar sing!  I'll, once again, check out the 2013 venue and be much more cautious as to who the artists are.  That is if Amazon sends me the right DVDs.",1394150400,,1347,4.127413127413128

The 2010 concert was held outdoors - I don't know if that had anything to do with it but the sound and the quality of the entire show just wasn't there.  I ended up returning the 2010 DVD's.  A few acts from 2010 could be cut from future programs as far as I'm concerned - Jimmie Vaughn needs to stick to playing the guitar, John Mayer didn't impress me either!  Derek Trucks is an outstanding guitarist!",1392854400,,563,4.365384615384615

This blu ray of the 2010 Crossroads festival is truly awesome. To me the photography pulls the concert together along with the editing. Truly beautiful. I've seen other versions of this festival and they've all fallen on their butts. This is the best, the holy grail of this date in time.

CD set with many guitar greats, from old timers (I mean some really old ones)
to ones I'd never heard of.  It's a great mix of styles too.  I could have done without
Bill Murray's introductions, but hey, that's just me.  The only thing glaringly missing
since there was a lot of bues played, was the lack of blues harp players.  When I
think of the giants that could have been there....(admittedly, I'm a harp player myself).

4208938,5,B003VB5E2E,For me this was one of the better concerts. Loaded with stars of past and some new and upcoming talent as well. Great chance to see and hear people of the past. As with all videos some will not like the angles of some shots but for the most part it's very good. As for the audio it's first rate and although this may be too long for some (4 hours) I didn't want it to end. My only complaint would be why two DVD's rather than one?

In my opinion, some of the artists don't really fit with the ""guitar festival"" theme and shouldn't have been included to make room for additional performances from others.

""While these concerts are benefits for Crossroads Center, Antigua, a nonprofit addiction-treatment clinic that Eric Clapton founded in the Caribbean, they are also rallies for what sometimes seems to be an endangered species: the guitar hero, the kind of player who can seize and hold an audience with chorus after chorus of an instrumental solo.""

The old and the new guitar gods strutted their stuff before over 28,000 fans, from gospel to blues,futuristic synth solos, funky rythyms,and searing guitar breaks, jazz,and bluegrass. A virtual banquet for the ears. These concerts are always top list, classy and unforgettable, that's why I keep buying them.

(I personally don't like ZZ top, but hey, not everybody likes me either!).  All the performances I don't like are made up for the ones I do.  Also, I gotta agree with a previous comment on here - The crowd is really lame!  Personal highlights - Jeff Beck, Ronnie Wood/Buddy Guy, Bill Murray, Eric Clapton/Steve Winwood and a couple of others too.  I find I only go back to the performances I like, rather than watching the entire concert, but seeing how long it is I guess this is what you'd do on the day too...

But the song selection they chose seems to have been ramped up. More of the artists joined together to accompany each other which made it super. Sonny Landreth, Robert Randolph, ZZ Top, Derek Trucks & his wife Susan Tadeschi were outstanding. As well as great performances by Sheral Crow, Jeff Beck, Winwood, Clapton and the rest. The only one I didn't like was Citizen Cope. Even Clapton couldn't save him. The only blemish on a thoroughly enjoyable concert. Also, I hope the next Crossroads has Black Country Communion with Joe Bonamassa, Jason Bonham and the rest. It seems that nobody has ever heard of them. Down here in Atlanta, they don't get any airtime on the radio. Bonnamassa is a word of mouth artist and probably one of the best guitarist out there. I totally reccomend this DVD.

Set in Toyota Stadium (Chicago Fire soccer) in June 2010, Clapton again manages to gather nearly all of the great rock/blues/country guitar players in the world today.  At least those that can still travel.  There's nothing bad here other than Clapton's hair, so I have a hard time picking favorites but I'll try:  Sonny Landreth on the first 2 tracks, Doyle Bramhall II, Gary Clark, Jr., John Mayer Trio, Derek Trucks & Susan Tedeschi Band, Buddy Guy with Jonny Lang & Ronnie Wood, Jeff Beck, Clapton & Steve Winwood and the finale with the great B.B. King.  The camera angles and editing are wonderful with interesting shots of crowds and especially other artists legitimately watching their peers perform.  There are no B.S unrehearsed jams that are not musical.  The transition between acts is brilliant and the voiceovers are brief and salient.  The 2 disc set clocks in at 4 hours and 39 minutes in lossless DTS HD Master Audio.  I could go on!",1321833600,,1038,4.8522727272727275

4208984,4,B003VB5E2E,"That Clapton continues to keep the flame of continuity of blues (and other genres) going is something for which music lovers owe him a great debt of gratitude. Unfortunately, some links in this chain are getting on in years and are more nostalgia items now to be wheeled on stage to be admired for what they used to be able to do rather than what they are now capable of. The end of the show with BB was almost tragic - the guy is in bad shape and can barely play - but then again he's been going at it since the early 1950s. The three guys playing with him had looks in their eyes that were heart breaking. Sumlin is still pretty feisty but I'm not sure Winter still has a pulse. I'm not knocking these guys (and I'm no Spring Chicken), all of whom were great in their day, but their day has passed; better to remember them as they were and not haul them up on stage. Just to finish with my negatives, a few of the artist selections were just plain weird, and some song selections by the non-weird were rather pedestrian. Teaming up certain guys to play with eachother seems to me to dilute their individual talents, like having Guy, Lang and Wood all go at the same song at the same time; putting folks together who don't normally play with eachother tends to erase their individual genius. However, there is plenty to like in this DVD: The Nashville players were great - the high point of the show in my book, along with a blazing Sonny Landreth at the start - and Trucks-Tedeschi-Hayes did a nice job, Cray was, as usual, on the mark, as was Beck and others. Some of Clapton's solos were trademark fantastic - how this guy avoids all-too-predicable riffs getting from point A to B while finding the perfect note every time still remains jaw dropping, but why play ""I Shot the Sheriff"" - yet again at Crossroads? Audio quality is good as is photograhy in my book. All-in-all, while we hope Clapton will keep this event rolling in the future as well as paying his respects to the greats who came before him, this event needs some new blood and formatting - and there is no lack of players out there who would give their right arm to be on this stage.",1309046400,5,2152,4.3424317617866

4208988,5,B003VB5E2E,"I went to the 2007 show with two of my best friends, and it was without a doubt one of the best days of my life.  That soccer arena on the South Side is not a huge venue, and there are absolutely no bad seats in the house.

Where do I start?  I love nearly all the music, and even the stuff I'm not crazy about is expertly done and easy to listen to.  The 2010 DVD is even better than the 2004 and 2007 ones, and they were incredible.

I love the loose snippets of history, all these great musicians hanging out backstage and enjoying each others' sets, the reverent nods to their shared roots and inspiration, the camaraderie, and the mutual respect (no egos or tantrums in sight).  It makes me feel like this is a big party for them too.

And it's not just a geezer-fest.  They brought in new acts like John Mayer and (as one previous reviewer mentioned) Orianthi, as well as a twenty-something GC competition winner every year.  I remember looking around me in 2007 at all the middle-aged, pudgy, suburban hubbydaddies just like me, in their baseball caps, prescription sunglasses and cargo shorts, their wives watching over the beer coolers and beach chairs.  Then Derek Trucks started his set, and a huge wave of college-age stoner dudes rushed the stage.  I realized all those people brought their kids along, too.  It's a big-city version of the Fourth of July picnic in the park, except the gazebo band is FREAKIN' ERIC CLAPTON.

I also love how they just toss genre out the window from square one.  Roots, Country, Rock, Jazz, Swing, Fusion -- if it's guitar-centered, it's on.

Is he going to do it again in 2013?  I'm there.  Until then, I've got this DVD.  Pop it in, crack a beer, kick back.

4208991,5,B003VB5E2E,"BB King once said: Eric Clapton is the sweetest and the most gentle guy in the music business. Not only for all he did (and does) for musicians and people who need assistance to deal with drugs/alchool addiction, but also for the chance he provides to many musicians to be introduced to huge audiences. For example, just have a look at the blond girl that appears playing guitar on Crossroads 2007 (extras on DVD 2). Her name is Orianthi Panagaris. She was asked to be in the band with the ""King Of Pop"", MJ, for the concerts in the O2 Arena (as we all know, those concerts sadly never happened). Second DVD in this pack (Crossroads 2010) is the best one, if you are really a blues guitar fan. Eric and Steve Winwood delivers the best version of ""Voodoo Child"" (slow version) that I've ever seen. Hopefully there are chances of another one in 2013.

After the 2007 Festival I would have thought they would have ditched him trying to MC the event, he was so poor. And Cheryl Crow? Gimme a break! Someone needs to rethink this and go back to Texas with the original format. Clapton, Beck, and ZZ Top rock but after that.....",1299110400,,530,4.257425742574258

4209001,4,B003VB5E2E,"There are many great performances on display here.  Many established artists who appear to have drunken from the fountain of youth.  Yet, in the middle of all this talent, is a young musician named Gary Clark, Jr. who only performed one song but was absolutely amazing.  His performance of Bright Lights alone is worth seeing.  I had not heard of him before and hope to see his talent better recognized in the future.  All in all, the whole show is a worthwhile viewing adventure.",1298678400,,480,4.666666666666667

It seemed that kids were behind the cameras. Obviously Eric Claptom contracted non-musicians probably to save $$$ but BIG MISTAKE.
This is evidenced because when solos were being performed, the camera was filming something other than ""hands-on-guitar"" shots.

DO NOT WAST YOUR MONEY ON THIS VERSION.  GET THE 2004.",1296864000,6,441,5.3768115942028984
4209005,4,B003VB5E2E,"If you like guitars and blues, you'll like this DVD.  After looking at the internet I note that not all the music was included.  For instance, Jeff Beck wasn't nearly as featured as he should have been.  Also, the trio with John Mayer was awesome.  Also Earl Klugh and John Bonamassa were great, as was Sonny Landreth w/Eric Clapton.  I must say Hubert Sumlin didn't belong on this DVD.  Same with Ronnie Wood (he's getting to look as bad as Keith Richards).  Thank the good Lord Johnnie Winters wasn't on the DVD.

Clapton's session had some very uninspired music included, but he's really good when he's playing with someone else.  Concerts are also great to watch and I'd buy this DVD if I didn't already own it.",1295740800,,715,4.566929133858268

4209008,3,B003VB5E2E,"I accidently placed disc two in the player and Derek Trucks started off with Susan Tedesco.  The first song sounded like a old Allman Brothers song but I just could not place.  It wasn't and was excellent. It was written by one of Derek's back uip singers.  They followed that with ""Coming Home"" from Delaney and Bonnie written by Eric Clapton and Bonnie Bartlett.  It continued on with Warren Haynes joining them with ""Soul shine""; David Hildago & Cesar Rojas (Los Lobos) doing the Allman's ""Please Don't Keep Me Wandering.""

Buddy Guy came on with Johnnie Lang and Ronnie Wood.  I really thought this would be good but........it dragged on the first song and ""Miss You"" was horrible and sounded like teenagers jamming.  It was an instrumental and it went on way too long.

Then we get the incredible Jeff Beck doing ""Hammerhead"" followed by what makes this whole DVD worth it, ""Nessum Dorma.""  OMG is all I can say!!!!!

Clapton comes out and does the usual but I ""Shot the Sherriff"" has an incredible solo.
Finally Steve Winwood does ""Had to Cry Today""; Voodoo Chile"" and ""Dear Mr. Fantasy.""
The end is BB King and the whole group doing, ""The Thrill is Gone.""  And it ran on too long and was boring

Disc One is just so so.
Sonny Landreth is incredible but poor song selections.  Followed by Robert Randolph who continually repeats his licks over and over and over, get it?
Cray, Vaughn, and Hubert Sumlin do two songs and again boring.
ZZ Top did not sound on.
Doyle Bramhall II is awesome and I loved his style with Arc Angels but these two songs were let's say, ""interesting.""
On and on.  Nothing new and as excellent as Bill Murray was on the other Crossroads he is very distracting and predictable here.
Overall enjoyable with some 5 star moments and some zero moments.",1295222400,,1777,4.6
4209009,5,B003VB5E2E,"I am not a huge blues fan, so this review comes from the perspective of someone who is not real familiar with many of the artists featured in this concert. That said, I enjoyed most of it. Some of the artists and music I liked better than others but then that's to be expected when you have a variety like this.  Many of the reviewers will give you their opinions (which some seem to feel are fact) as to which performances were the best but what one person thinks was great will be what someone else feels is not so great. All I can say is there is enough here for everyone and you'll wind up liking some parts better than others.

I purchased the Blu Ray version and the sound and picture are excellent, especially the sound. This is one to really turn up loud. Now that I've seen the entire concert, I'll skip a few parts next time around but overall this is one great disc and highly recommended.

4209012,5,B003VB5E2E,"So much coolness on these two discs...For me, the stuff I keep repeat listening to is the Susan Tedeshi/Derek Trucks set. All those numbers, including the tunes with Warren Haynes especially are just superb songs. A highpoint of musicality and energy. Derek Trucks playing with his fingers is just wildly talented, both soloing with and without the slide and his great rhythym playing, ditto for Warren Haynes, not to mention his great , bluesy voice. Susan Tedeshi's singing is just perfect and the crack band with backup singers, horns and TWO drummers (wow) was excellent. What a great concert Tedeshi/Trucks must be! I also really dug Bright Lights Big City by Gary Clark Jr. who I'd never heard of before. The climatic ending was great to watch with all the guitarists coming out to jam with BB King, if not quite awe-inspiring playingwise,  you do have to genu-flect on the great ones playing.  As on the on the first Crossroads discs a couple years ago , Jeff Beck was what I was most looking forward to...and he delivers. Loved his fusion tunes and his trademark expressiveness, especially on the 2nd tune. The sound quality is top notch and nicely filmed. You will most surely find something to enjoy here! The only slight letdown was oddly enough, Eric Clapton...his tunes didn't have a lot of energy the way Tedeshi/Trucks did, but still cool nonetheless. Something minor but cool, ..that looping music of a lone, droning dobro guitar at the disc menu and the pics there and on the setup,options etc was really cool.",1295049600,,1527,4.824427480916031

There's no ""comparing..."" it's apples and oranges...everyone has their own style of playing solos, and I say, ""hooray!"" What a great sample of talent we are treated to!

4209015,4,B003VB5E2E,"The artists were great, the music was great, however; the video work was done with the technique of a  middle school video class.

For example, out of focus shots and then zooming for a close up and then back out.  When the guitar players take a solo they would zoom in and out but not showing much of the player's hands on the guitar (that's what makes the unique sound for each player).  Sometimes they didn't even know who had the lead part on some sounds.  The cameras were twitching from shot to shot for some kind of effect I suppose, I know when I go to a concert my head would fall off it I jerked in around like these camera shots.

Crossroads 2004 and 2007 were produced much better from a visual stand point.",1294963200,,719,4.25

Great songs though they are - why did they have to once again include Killing Floor and Six Strings Down? I question why Sheryl Crow, whom I greatly admire as a pop artist, is included in such a line-up. Jeff Beck is once again the 'stand out' performer along with EC himself, but there are too many other non-legend, lesser knowns to make this a great compilation. We seem to be getting more talk too in place of the music.
It's time EC thought of inviting Joe Satriani to 'fire things up' or just get G3 to come and jam - that would really get the place jumping.
I hope if EC does this again - he's more selective with artists and the producers of the DVDs are more discerning than the stuff they dished up on these DVDs.

Yes, it has a number of the same artists from the 2007 Crossroads concert, also held in Chicago, but some of them are better in this one, and some of the ""newcomers"" really shine. All in all, it more than balances out and gives you four hours of very good stuff.

Who's good and who's bad is subjective, depending on which artists you like, but almost everyone I've talked to agrees the ""jam sessions"" are the best in this 2010 festival.

The groups of Buddy Guy-Jonny Lang-Ronnie Wood; Derek Trucks-Susan Tedeschi-Warren Haynes; B.B. King-Eric Clapton-Jimmie Vaughan-Robert Cray and the amazing contingent of Vince Gill-Keb Mo-James Burton-Albert Lee-Earl Klugh-Sheryl Crow are all so good it can bring tears to your eyes and a lot of life to your toe-tapping feet.

I defy anyone to submit anything of recent note that is even in the same ball park, or soccer stadium in this case.  From Sonny Landreths opening salvos though Robert Randolfs high energy romp and Derek Trucks more than ample fill-in for the Allmans, to Jeff Becks other-worldly sonics and the rousing finales, this is the finest accumulation of musical talent you may ever see & hear.  Turn it up loud!

As for the experience itself, I was there, and while the music was great the experience was less so.  Not because of the people or the event staff or even the inflated concession prices, be because of Toyota Parks irresponsible decision to run only hot water in the bathrooms just so they could sell more water.  To me that is not only negligent but boarder line criminal.  It was a blistering hot eleven hour day for most of us.  To do that at the expense of peoples health and safety is extremely dangerous.  I live downstate and don't follow Chicago news that much but I sure hope someone is suing there asses.  Although Clapton had said weeks earlier that this would be his last Crossroads, that evening he said he might have to do one more.  Do us all a favor EC and have it anywhere but there.

Bill Murray returns to MC a group that although aging (BB King, Hubert Sumlin, Johnny Winter) still rocks.

4209056,4,B003VB5E2E,"I would rate this year's Crossroads concert about as high as 07's...where most of it is enjoyable, but you think, ""Boy, I wish they had so-and-so play,"" or ""I wish they had played this song instead of that song..."" I myself prefer all the blues material, and can very easily live without the pop stuff like Sheryl Crow (WHY?) or Citizen Cope, whoever that is. And his song, btw, was very anti-climactic being sandwiched in between E.C's two songs--that was pretty dumb. And his song was way boring, to boot. There are several guitar players I would have loved to see in this concert who musically who would have fit like a glove, but OK, Eric C. is not necessarily out to showcase only the top talent in the guitar virtuoso genre, and I guess that makes sense, since very few guitar virtuosos command any mainstream popularity. I did enjoy the major talent that Clapton did include, such as Sonny Landreth, Joe Bonamassa, Derek Trucks, Robert Randolph, and Jeff Beck, of course. Personally, I would have loved to see Eric Sardinas, Gary Moore, Chris Duarte and Los Lonely Boys added to the lineup...I wouldn't say that any of those acts are any more obscure than Sonny Landreth (who is incredible and much deserves mainstream attention).

I'm not much of a country music fan, but I did very much enjoy the country portion of the concert with Vince Gill, Albert Lee and James Burton. What a lineup! Some down-home pickin' and grinnin' going on there, and the ol' Tele twang was in full force front and center! Great stuff...

Unlike other comments I read, I thought Eric's own guitar performance was inspired enough...it's amazing how he has defied age...his singing and guitar playing has not deteriorated one bit. He doesn't have quite the fire and fluidity as from the days of Cream in the late 60's, but he seemed to give up that kind of playing as soon as Cream broke up--lol. His singing, of course, has only gotten better. My only criticism of Eric himself is his hair--GET A HAIRCUT! :-)

Song after song. Just not there. Best I can recommend is the country set with Vince Gill.  Now, I don't like country, but this had my foot tapping. The rest, well, what can I say?  Already said it. Other comments - the sound was not great either. DTS, really? Could not get that great surround sound dynamic, at least out of my system. Same goes for the video blu-ray. Nothing spectular, which is what I expect. Now, this is not bad.  But not worth recommending. Frankly, I think other reviews here are way over the top.  More influenced by the musicians than the songs. I've seen lots of great blues and rock guitar concerts. This ain't it. Not even close.",1291420800,5,827,4.605442176870748

The genius of Jeff Beck is very clear on his version of Nessun dorma, an aria from Giacomo Puccini's opera Turandot.  Of course Jeff has his Guitar sounds arranged pre-song but, from the first note to the last, Jeff steps on no pedals.  Beck turns this classic aria into his own.  His dynamic use of the fret board, tasteful spin of the volume knob & touch of the whammy-bar, are crying out the desperation of Calaf, (the original arias narrator.)  Fellow musicians in the band help Jeff ride this superb music into pure electric bliss heaven! I feel that Jeff adds a unique nuance to this perfect music piece.  I could swear that the spirit's of Luciano Pavarotti is somewhere in the solid body of his Strat & Puccini's is within Beck's fingers.  An absolute fantastic work of music here folks.

4209064,3,B003VB5E2E,"I've got all three of these Crossroads festivals and 2010 is not the best of the bunch. Of course Eric is still top shelf, His performance with Steve Winwood on Voodoo Chile was terrific. The other stand outs where Susan Tedeschi's great voice and band. Jeff Beck's version of Nesen Dorma. Beck always is improving and is always doing something new. I know Derek Trucks is capable of far more than just sliding a piece of glass over the strings. There is way to much emphasis on Slide Guitar. I know it's a blues thing, but not every song. Enough already. David Hildago and his boys still light it up. The other great performance was Earl Klugh. Eric needs to allow more jazz players into the fold. Personally I think alot of these roots players are afraid of the musicanship of the jazz players. I missed McLaughlin. Mabey next year Eric, Larry Coryell or Mimi Fox huh? If it's a guitiar festival then lets see some other styles. Frankly there were alot of repeat type performances here. I love BB King with all my heart and he's getting on, but we've all heard The Thrill is gone. We've had enough of Killing Floor as well. To be honest, there are bunch of so called big stars featured here, which I'm amazed have a career at all. All in all it looked like a great event. We must keep the Blues alive and live music alive at any cost. Generally I got the feeling that they just showcased the usual performers because they felt that's what folks wanted. There was not the feeling or performances chosen that equalled that last two concerts. The last two I had I watched and still watched repeatedly but this one just doesn't give that feeling. Better luck next time. I hope the next festival, they might want to find some more innovative and newer talent. I also hope that the veteran players stop falling back on what they did and start thinking of new ideas. They should take note of Mr. Beck and Mr. Klugh.

The artist lineup had the potential to really wow the concert goer but IMO was a little lackluster.  My biggest disappointment was the video editing which is probably the main reason this rated a 3.  Too many out of focus shots coming into focus, shots of the audience clapping instead of focusing on the artist, jumping to new shots so fast it really took away from the performance.  I think the guy was trying to be too artsy-fartsy in the editing room and really messed up a good concert for those of us who were not actually there.

4209072,2,B003VB5E2E,"If you're wondering, it's not as good as the 'blow the doors off' Guitarfest 2007 DVD.

Remember, that disk had John Mayer, Los Lobos, Jeff Beck, and Clapton with Winwood and Buddy Guy all on disk 2.  All the performances just STUNG!  Some good stuff on Disk 1, as well.

This time around, the treats on are disk 1.  A very pleasing, well-photographed performance by ZZ Top inspired me to buy 'ZZ Top Live From Texas,' which I knew wasn't going to be as good -- and wasn't.  And John Mayer -- what is it about that guy?  He offers us 'Who Did You Think I Was,' a take on Joe Walsh's 'Funk 49,' the same song played sideways and MAKES IT WORK.  IMHO, it's far better than the other performances -- and fittingly ends the first disk.  I'm not saying that objectively, but Mayer does seem to have something other players don't.

Disk Two has the Ron Wood (world's most underrated guitar slinger), Buddy Guy, and umm, some other cat) on 'Five Long Years.'  Annnnnd that's about it.  'Who Shot the Sherrif?' Who cares?  I saw Eric do that on the Clapton/Beck Tour -- go watch it on You Tube, it's a better performance.

Funny but true:  you can find better guitar players than any of these guys tripping down the stairs of any NYC club.  Why put these guys on big-time film?

And the whole idea of just forcing good players to share a stage is lame.  Bonnamassa should have had his own set.",1290297600,8,1385,4.34375

You get to hear rare authentic musicianship with ""soul"" that comes through artists who do not come together otherwise, but love coming together for Crossroads (e.g. comments by Vince Gill ""I'd come even if I wasn't invited,"" Sheryl Crow ""this is my favorite gig,"" Buddy Guy ""I feel like I'm in heaven"").  Don't buy this DVD to hear your favorite artists do their usual things because there isn't enough of anyone for that.  Buy it for the rare opportunity to hear 4-1/2 hours of highlights from a group of friends having a 12 hour jam session.

The only major things missing are Bill Murray's hilarious opening (""give me less guitar""), Jeff Beck's song featuring bassist Rhonda Smith, and the ""Sweet Home Chicago"" finale (probably because Clapton thought 25 guitarists was too many).",1289779200,,996,4.841176470588235

It is mixed extremely well and is a pleasure to watch, although it is not done in the chronological order of the performances.

I'm a music fan of the Eric Clapton generation. Disc one was kind of a waste of time for me. I didn't know most of the people and never heard of most of the songs. I watched ZZ Top and really liked Vince Gill but that was it. The second disc was much better. Jeff Beck was awesome as usual. You never know what he will come up with but it's always worth listening to. I love Steve Winwood but why sing ""Had to Cry Today"" and ""Dear Mr. Fantasy"" again when it's on last year's Crossroad?. He's got lots of hits. Sing something else. The same with Eric singing ""I Shot The Sheriff"" again, come on. However, his and Eric's version of Voodoo Chile is amazing. They slowed it down and made it bluesy. It was worth the wait. I was kind of disappointed that Eric didn't play a George Harrison song again as a tribute. I thought he was going to do that every year - ""Wah-Wah"" would have been nice.

As a totally different aside.  Eric is beginning to resemble an old man who hangs around playgrounds looking for little girls. He needs to shave and get a damn hair cut. It's scary.",1289606400,7,1214,4.228448275862069

This was the best concert I've ever been to in my life and this DVD does it justice. If you were at the concert and/or are just a fan of great guitar work, get the DVD.

My only complaints (and they are very minor), are that I wish they would have shown a little more of Joe Bonamassa (who I believe is on the cusp of becoming the world's pre-eminent blues-rock guitarist), and I really would have liked to have seen Rhonda Smith's (Beck's bassist) epic bass solo again.

The entire concert was awesome, but Guy-Wood-Lang was a religious experience. Cudos to the producers for including all of 'Miss You', including Buddy busting his string. Epic.",1289606400,2,660,4.576271186440678
4209081,1,B003VB5E2E,"I waited for a year for this Crossroads 2010 blue ray to come out and watched it tonight...whew! what a stinkfest!.At this point Eric owes me $29.95 and 2 hours of my life back. I also must admit that i am a huge blues fan and have the other two crossroads dvd's and this borefest misses the mark completely.
The only light in this dvd is the VERY small part that John Mayer and Joe Bonnamassa play in this concert. There is not enough hydroponic weed in the world to make the tired sound of Jimmy Vaughan(listen to ""six Strings Down"" and try not to laugh out loud),Los Lobos and equally bad performances by Buddy Guy and a drunk as ever Ron Wood sound palatable.
Even Claptons performance was contrived and lacked the laser like intensity that his solos normally have...and why play""I shot the Sheriff"" again after playing it so well on the first DVD surely his catalouge is vast enough not to repeat this particular song as well as the other exact tunes he played with Steve Winwood on the 2nd Crossroads DVD.
ZZ Top was about as exciting as watching paint dry. This dvd is simply a re-hash of the other two Much Better crossroads dvd's that have gone before it...and that is a travesty considering what this festival started out as and the talent that could have been chosen to represent guitar and the blues.

This dvd is a pale comparison to the original Crossroads dvd that was filled with excellent artists and musical numbers that were bang on the money...this felt tired and old to the point that even Jeff Becks spot was just ok. And can someone please tell me why Sheryl Crow is still haunting this event? her contribution was about as good as Bill Murray was Funny that day and night..his comedy was non existent as the MC of the concert..oh i get it he's dressed like Jimmi Hendrix then stands there and mumbles as the crowd looses their tolerence of his lame act?.

Nope... this is not the concert dvd you want to spend hard earned dollars on period ...if i could return this turkey i would do so tommorow as i will not watch it again...absolute utter dissapointment.",1289606400,35,2081,4.502645502645502

My main complaint(s) are that many of the same musicians were invited back from CrossRoads 2009 - so much so, that it almost seems like a repeat of the year before. Also, some of the choices made for the DVD are not comprehensible to me.  Jimmy Vaughn gets more air time on stage than Joe Bonamassa? Almost 30 minutes of the DVD devoted to Derrick Trucks band? Why is Vince Gil back again?  I almost thought  Eric was too lazy to change his invitation list from last year and just clicked the send button on his laptop to last year's invite list.  I noticed that many of the positive reviews on this site for the DVD were from people who went to the live concert and are actually reviewing their experience from the live show. Their reviews I would imagine are colored by their good memories of the concert. Bill Murray is back again as MC as well. I like Bill Murray but his act here is the same as it was in 2009.

4209083,5,B003VB5E2E,"First off, I religiously keep up with these DVD's ever since the first edition in Texas.  Which still holds as the best one out of the 3, simply because This is Eric Claptons Event where you want him to SHINE.  He completely tears it up in the first Crossroads DVD on I shot the Sheriff, cocaine, and have you ever loved a woman.  The guitar solos never have sounded better on his Fender.  5 Star DVD

Now 2007 Crossroads in Bridgeview:  Somewhat very weak, eric doest want to be self-indulgent and barely solos with the same intensity he usually has.  John Mayer, Buddy Guy, Derek Trucks, and Jeff Beck the Show.  4 star DVD

2010 Crossroads in Bridgeview:  Great Mix of artisits- Although many of you were not at the actual event.  Let me say this- I had to actually leave the event early after standing for 12 hours and listening to BB KING ramble on for 35 minutes in the finale without just playing.  On a positive note, Gary Clark Jr. is a STUD just incredible musicianship and style.  The DVD did not have the memorizing Bass solo from the girl in Jeff Beck's band ( Prince's former bassist, I cant remember her name)  that highlight won me over, disappointing the dvd didn't capture that footage.  The Buddy guy, Ronnie wood, Johnny Lang set was easily the best highlight of the entire film- a must see.  What else was wrenching? Citizen Cope filling in or whatever he was doing- it was hard to watch in person-boring, nonchalant, and irrelevant.  ZZ sounded great, Midnight in Harlem with Derek truck and his wife excellent, and Mayer's rhythmic section in Aint no sunshine was top notch.",1289347200,,1597,4.566901408450704
4209084,5,B003VB5E2E,"I agree with the first reviewer's opinion. However, the Best Buy Exclusive 3 Disc Set has expired. Now, they only have the same 2 DVD version as Amazon. If you can find one available, the bonus third dvd includes 5 extra performances, plus an interview with Eric Clapton. The 3rd Bonus dvd includes Eric Clapton & Steve Winwood's ""Glad"", Sheryl Crow's ""Everday is a Winding Road"", Derek Trucks & Susan Tedeschi Band's ""Love Has Something Else to Say"", Gary Clark Jr.'s ""Don't Owe You a Thang"", & Citizens Cope's ""Son's Gonna Rise"".

As far as the basic 2 dvds go, this is ""Guitar Heaven"". Like Buddy Guy states during one of his performances, ""I don't know how you feel, but I feel like I'm in Heaven"". I love all of this guitar festival. If you like guitar rock, it doesn't get any better than this. Bill Murray is an excellent host as usual. Plus, the mutual respect and camaraderie amoung the guitarists and musicians is great to see. Plus, there are great commentaries by some of the guitarists themselves. You can tell they are all glad to be there, performing with each other. It's a great atmosphere.

Some of my personal favorites include the performances by Sonny Landreth, from my home state of Louisiana. He plays the guitar in a Louisiana, Cajun/Zydeco style, called ""Slydeco"". Also, there's Robert Randolph & The Family Band. Robert is awesome on his pedel steel guitar. I like the tribute to Stevie Ray Vaughan ""Six Strings Down"" by Jimmy Vaughan and others. I like Hubert Sumlin, he's a living blues legend, and he's still full of passion for the blues. I like ZZ Top, Doyle Bramhall II, & Gary Clark Jr., all from Texas. I like James Burton from Louisiana, on ""Mystery Train"" & other songs. James Burton started playing guitar on the Louisiana Hayride Radio Program, when he was 14 years old. He was in Elvis' TCB Band (Taking Care of Business). Also, he was one of the first ""sidemen"" inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.

I really enjoyed the Derek Trucks & Susan Tedeschi Band's performances, this is their first debut on a dvd, as a reorgainized new band. I love Derek's slide guitar playing. He is a master of the slide guitar, plus Susan is great on guitar, and a great vocalist also. I liked all the collaborations of different musicians playing together. I liked Warren Haynes, Sheryl Crow, Robert Cray, Vince Gill, Albert Lee, Buddy Guy, Ron Wood, Johnny Lang, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, and all the rest. I really liked Buddy Guy's perfomances, especially the Stone's ""Miss You"", where he breaks a guitar string, and handles it gracefully, and then is handed another guitar. Plus I loved the grand finale, ""The Thrill is Gone"", by B.B.King (another living blues legend) & Ensemble.

If you liked the first two EC's Guitar Festival DVD's, then you'll certainly enjoy this one, for sure. These festivals just keep getting better and better. Thanks!!!",1289260800,45,2894,4.736111111111111

A little spark in the 80's and some great albums up till the late 90's - But then.....Reptile? Back Home?And now: Clapton??
Ladies and Gentlemen...please!
The only thing we had left were the Crossroads shows where our hero would show that he can still do it!! And do it
great with other #1 guitarists too! Crossroads #1 and #2 were both excellent but now we have edition #3....and its starting to stink again....same 'ole same 'ole again and again - I cringe at the thought of Crossroads #4 next year.
I can either keep buying the latest Croassroads DVD's or simply watch the old ones over and over - there is no difference.
Try Netflix first and then decide for yourself.",1289260800,15,1131,4.544117647058823
4209086,3,B003VB5E2E,Looking through this setlist there is one major mistake. Not enough Joe Bonamassa and too much John Mayer. I'm glad Eric has finally recognized one of the greatest rising stars in guitar playing today and invited Joe to perform at the latest Crossroads fest. Now he needs to share him with the rest of the world and not the publicity hungry Mayer.,1288656000,12,347,4.612903225806452

4209088,2,B003VB5E2E,"Once again EC has collected his friends and heroes to play the 12 bar blues a few more times.

The GOOD:Jeff Beck, nuff-said. Derek Trucks smokes. John Mayer surprises. To me they were clearly the standouts.
And ZZ Top at least were a little sloppy, rawk- attitude filled raucus good time.

The BAD: Everyone has an opinion. My admittedly harsh one is this. Jimmy Vaughan is a snooze fest. The poor guy cannot sing at all.
And the whole thing just comes to a screaching halt when hes onscreen. NO stage presence at all. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.

Sonny Landreth and Robert Cray are gifted players, but to me its just, well....a bit boring. No personality. Buddy Guy shows everybody how it
should be done, but he barely solos...letting Johnny Lang grab the spotlight..which is OK...but why is Buddy not given the ""hero"" spot?
When Buddy Guy is onstage I want to HEAR Buddy Guy!

These types of events are always rife with too many guitarists on stage at once. I know its a ""guitar fest"" But when you have so many players on the stage at the same time evreybody gets short changed. And what the heck is Earl Klugh doing on a country jam of ""Lay Down Sally?""Tele,Tele, Tele....nylon string solo. Just does not fit. I don't get it....

The UGLY: Clapton's set. Oh man, I love Eric, but...no one needs another lame 12 minute long version of ""I shot the Sheirff."" No one!
And don't even get me started on Citizen Cope! I mean it was painful. Painful. Why oh WHY was he even there? Dreadful.

Clapton shows a brief glimpse of the power he still possesses with Steve Winwood and they do a pretty good version of Voodoo Chile. Then they get everybody, and I mean everybody on stage one more time, for Sweet Home Chicago. Look, Im a guitarist myself and many of the guys on the stage are heroes on mine , but for goddsake no one should be subjected to another version of Sweet Home Chicago ever again.

Ultimately I would prefer if you could buy a 10 disk set, (in 4 volumes) and get ALL of the FULL sets( or at least 20 minutes) of ALL of the big acts. At 2 disks you get a large quantity of artists but not enough quality performances.

Just my opinion, ya know.",1285891200,22,2152,4.430379746835443
4209089,4,B003VB5E2E,"I always look forward to The Crossroad Guitar Festival when it comes around, but unfortunately have never been as I live in California and it's usually sold out pretty quickly. The DVD's are about as close as I can get, and I consider these festival's to be like the World Cup of rock and blues. I was a little disappointed in this years festival (I saw the theatrical release), as I hold the 2007 festival to be one of the greatest concerts ever put on. However, this festival is nonetheless amazing. The same amazing, top tier lineup as in years past coming together to play some of the best music ever written. I even discovered a few new favorites, including Midnight In Harlem. It may not be like going to the actual festival, but it's as close as the majority of us can get. One of these days I am gonna go and see this festival (heck, I'd sell my kidney for a couple tickets). Until then, I can enjoy these fantastic DVD's. These are also good to keep around for our kids so they can see and hear what real music is after all the classic players have gone to the great beyond. Hey, gotta keep the music alive somehow, right?",1285200000,2,1131,4.339622641509434
4209090,3,B003VB5E2E,"I was all set to pre-order, but looked at what I was getting.  A re-mix of the last Crossroads fest!  I know most people purchasing this are guitarists also and had heard the Buddy Guy, Jonny Lang & Ron Wood set was amazing, but everything else is keeping me from ordering since I already have the previous two.",1284595200,5,311,4.344827586206897
4209091,3,B003VB5E2E,"I see that my original review was taken down, probably for the better. As I said in that review I did not watch the entire two hour theatre release because I was disappointed with the weak performances and left after only 30+ minutes. With that in mind I can see where my review may lack credibility. Since I have not seen the upcoming four hour release I could not possibly review it for either content or quality.
  My apologies to Jimmy Vaughan, ZZ Top and Doyle Bramhall for trashing your performances, I should have waited. Apologies to Eric Clapton for his noble effort which probably deserved better reviews from me and most definitely deserved better performances from the aforementioned.",1282435200,4,696,4.840336134453781
4209092,5,B003VB5E2E,"I was at the Crossroads 2010 show and eagerly awaited the theatrical release. The first thing you have to realize is that nothing, not a 2 hour movie or a 4 hour DVD will capture what it was like to have actually seen some of the brilliant performances of that day. The editing was shaky at best but the sound was quite good (I'm sure the sound varied greatly depending on the theater). Although I was dissapointed in the movie, I'd see it again and here's why. The movie missed a lot of the high points of the 11 hour show, but it caught enough to remind me of how great the entire experience had been, and that's all I asked for. I was pleasently surprised at the applause in the theater after some of the better performances. The most dissapointing thing about the movie was the performances that weren't included. John Mayer, Buddy Guy, and Jeff Beck all played sets that deserved complete coverage (and I would pay money to buy a DVD). ""Going Down"", ""Killing Floor"", ""La Grange"", ""Mystery Train"", and ""Comin' Home"" were all songs I was sad didn't make the cut. And although he didn't add a whole lot musically, Bill Murray's intro's were hysterical. Addressing a negative critism: I don't know what a ""I-IV-V progression in G with a capo"" is, but I could watch Robert Randolph, Jimmie Vaughn, and Hubert Sumlin play it all day!(I've seen a lot of pictures of Muddy Waters with a capo and I heard he's pretty good!). I'm quite sure the DVD will capture more of the esscence of the complete concert, but, as we all know, that's impossible.",1282176000,53,1542,4.510714285714286
4209093,5,B003VB5E2E,"The two hour theatrical is different footage than what will be used on the DVD release. The two hour movie was the same footage the crowd seen on the big screens. I don't understand how people can review something that isn't even out yet. It will be great, I am sure, but I cant review it until I buy it receive it and watch it.",1281744000,5,328,4.061538461538461
4209094,5,B003VB5E2E,"So far, it seems that the reviews are focused on the Fathom movie release, not the actual DVD itself.  Do we know for sure that the Fathom movie is a subset of what Rhino is releasing as the DVD?  I don't necessarily think so.  And I expect much better editing from the Rhino DVD (as with previous Crossroads DVDs).  The movie was worth my $12.50 and I would pay 10 times the $29.95 for the DVD, especially if it included the entire day.",1281052800,5,437,4.228915662650603
4209095,4,B003VB5E2E,"I have both of the previous DVDs of the Crossroads festivals, 2004 and 2007, I have played guitar for almost 15 years, I have been in the music business in one way or another for over 40 years. These are some of the best live music videos I have ever seen, especially the 2007 one, the songs Jeff Beck does are worth the price of admission alone. His technique is unmatched. I have pre-ordered the 2010 DVD just to see Jeff Beck again, but I know there will be more jems inside waiting to be enjoyed. The guy who gave it a one star is probably a guitar snob, I've had to deal with them over the years, not everybody who's good gets famous and makes a lot of money, in fact almost nobody gets famous and makes a lot money, especially people who are only trying to do just that. So buy this DVD, enjoy it, buy a guitar, practice and have fun, there is nothing wrong with playing a 1,4,5 progression 'till the day you die! It's a blast!",1280793600,15,933,4.1602209944751385
4209096,5,B003VB5E2E,"I love when people rate a DVD that they haven't seen because it hasn't been released it yet.  I especially like it when they are actually just getting some anger out and venting to the unwitting amazonian world.  And I love it when they sound pretentious about guitar playing and don't seem to like or appreciate the blues (which Clapton and many of his invitees seem to love).  But best of all about this person's emotional outburst: they watched only 30 minutes of a 2 hour theatrical release (which I would give 3.5 stars because the second half was very good), which is only 1/8 of the four-hour (as yet unreleased) DVD/Blu-ray of the film.  I love people that do this SO much that I decided I had to get into the action--at the very least to offset the maroon (as Bugs Bunny would say) that fits the aforementioned descriptions.

A lot of people seemed to think the film was pretty good--so I'm interested to see the other 87.5% of the performances when the DVD actually comes out.",1280448000,24,986,4.51685393258427
