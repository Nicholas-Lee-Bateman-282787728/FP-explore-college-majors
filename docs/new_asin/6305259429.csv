996529,1,6305259429,"This is one of the better Van Damme movies. I liked it. The reason for my 1 star review is because this is NOT a wide-screen presentation of the film (2.35:1) as shown in the product description. It is a full screen version of the film (4:3) like on the old Standard Def TV's. I already had this full screen version of the film. I ordered this because it was supposed to be the wide screen version. Now I have two full screen versions of the DVD. Luckily, this DVD was cheap and it's not worth the time or effort to send it back. I just wanted to warn others who were also looking for the wide screen version.",1443139200,,609,4.126050420168068

John Wayne's 'Rio Lobo' presented a similar mashup from his 'Horse Soldiers' and 'Rio Bravo', 'El Dorado' redux.  Although more predictable - it is John Wayne, after all - 'Rio Lobo' has more humor, better acting, Ford's direction and uncomplicated motivations.

In today's marketplace, 'Legionnaire' might well be considered a reboot and like its eerily similar predecessor, 'March or Die', commercially unfortunate.

For shovelling popcorn and action sequences, Van Damme is your guy and he does deliver.  But, typical of many action stars, the drama is best left to those who can actually act.",1403654400,,860,5.272058823529412

996746,5,6305259429,"The Jean Claude Van Damme Review Matrix (JCVD-RM)

1. Who is he? A 1920s French boxer named Alain Lefevre, a womanizing champion boxer who refuses to take a dive, and has his eyes/history for a mobster's girlfriend
2. Which family member/friend must be avenged? A long-time friend and boxing promoter gets 86'd after a crooked fight.
3. Does he take his shirt off? And pants in an all male shower, in a rare bare-butt scene for JCVD
4. Does he have sex with a C-List actress? No, but there is that shower...
5. Is there a tournament? No tournament at all, this is a different movie for Van Damme
6. Is training needed for this tournament? Aaaarmy training sir!
7. Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament? No splits are necessary when you have a rifle
8. Does he punch someone in the balls? Sadly, JCVD is breaking all of his movie rules in this one.
9. Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks? Unbelievably, he doesn't kick at all.  I guess being a boxer makes kicking forbidden.
10. Is his enemy unbeatable? A bunch of Berber warriors on horses are hardly worthy of JCVD's awe-inspiring will to win.
11. Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance? Throughout this movie there is more than one person who poses a roadblock for JCVD.  The love of his life is lost to him early on.  While in the French Foreign Legion he has to team up with a squirrelly Frenchman named Rosetti who can't march more than a day without falling out, a surly black American who breaks every rule, and a posh Brit with a drinking problem who was dishonorably discharged from the British military.
12. Does he win? This might be the first movie since No Retreat No Surrender in which JCVD is not the unequivocal winner and hero of the movie.

Straying quite a bit from his norm, Van Damme takes on a role and a script that strays from most of his standard practices.  Very little fighting immediately makes it foreign territory for him, but the fact that this plays out like a Lawrence of Arabia (maybe even Beau Geste) than Lionheart - another movie in which he plays a character on the run who joins the French Foreign Legion and gets stationed in northern Africa.

Production values and cinematography in this film truly reflect the 35 million dollar budget.  Stunning desert landscapes and multiple juxtapositions of the sun create foreboding dimensions which visually explain Lefevre's hopeless and weathered outlook on life.  Other aspects of the time period are perfect, with the music and costumes providing authenticity.  Even the supporting cast is superb, most notably Steven Berkoff as hard-nosed Sgt. Steinkampf.

Essentially this is about men running away from lives, seeking new future, finding camaraderie and danger in the French Foreign Legion, and fighting until the last breath for survival.  This movie is extremely underrated, and I highly recommend it.",1271376000,7,2872,4.722
996747,5,6305259429,One of the few and possibly only Van Damme movie where the character isn't a martial artist but a man running from his past and who joins the Foreign Legend around 1925. The DVD also features a history of the legend which was well presented and quite interesting. The film remains faithful to the grim life of the Legionaires and I give Van Damme credit for trying a different type of action movie. This movie stands with Time Cop and Sudden Death as great action films that can be enjoyed again and again.,1232928000,2,506,4.451612903225806
996748,5,6305259429,"Was that even a Van Damme film ? ... oh well , that's how I would discribe this Van Damme film .

Great sets , Great locations , Great costumes , Great props , ok acting ... this is Van damme after all !

The only 2 things I could complain about is the fact that Van Damme was a little bit cheesy about being proud to be a LEGIONAIRE and the ending ( I won't spoil it) .... it just seemed prodictable to me .

All in all , this is a good film and I recommend this as one of the best Van Damme films .",1149724800,2,500,3.611111111111111

996858,3,6305259429,"This is NOT one of Jean-Claude Van Damme's better efforts.  Lots of special effects, blood and gore, but very light on acting.  Historically, I'm sure the members of the LEGION ETRANGERE (French Foreign Legion), are laughing themselves silly, or rolling in their honorable graves.",1142294400,,280,5.340909090909091
996859,5,6305259429,"Definitely a good movie, Legionnaire, brings to the screen the story of a French boxer, who refuses to take part in a rigged match resulting in his joining the Foreign Legion.
It is the 1920's.  France's North African colonies are experiencing Arab national revolutions and the French Foreign Legion is looking for new recruits in Europe as they sense their hold is weakening.
The movie is action packed, the special effects are great, the acting is excellent and the cast are wonderful.
Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Berkoff, Nicholas Farrell, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!  Consequently, they have done a superb job of providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.
There is a wonderful feel of History; the clash between the French and Arabs is as fascinating as the interaction between the different nationalities found within the Legion, and both are presented very well in the film.
History, Battles, Intrigue, Duty, and Honor are all about.
The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the costumes, and the music are all wonderful!
The film combines romance, drama, action and adventure making it a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!",1134259200,5,1413,5.108225108225108
996860,4,6305259429,"Anyone who gave this movie a 1 star rating needs to go find a really high cliff to go jump off of. This is actually a pretty decent film, with some beautiful shots and cool desert scenery, and ok acting from Van Damme. Most of the supporting cast play their parts quite well too I believe (and seemingly good chemistry between the main characters). I mean yeah of course this isn't Lawrence of Arabia or Saving private ryan, but then again what else is? I can't tell you how many times I've watched this movie, it has some kind of pleasant addicting nature to it that I can't quite describe. A great film to watch if you are sick at home or just plain out of your mind bored. And also, I'll definitely have to give this movie props as being the best movie I've ever found in the Walmart 5 dollar bin. Even better than the lower budget clint eastwood flicks that I've found in there. It's THAT good!",1133740800,4,898,4.288235294117647
996861,5,6305259429,"This is one the best Legion movies to come out in recent years.  A straight-forward plot sets the action in motion.  I must confess to not being a Van Damme fan, and actually knew little about him before this film, but I give him credit for a good job here.  In fact he seems to have co-produced it which I also appluad.  He gives a solid performance combining humor with pathos and sadness.  The film provides a realistic view of the Legion during the murderous Riff Wars of the 1920s.  This was just after WW1 and France was hard-pressed to hold onto her Algerian colonies.  The movie accurately portrays the brutal atmosphere of the Legion from training to combat.  The harshness of life, the tough NCOs and the inadequate officers who indifferently lead the Legion are all well shown.  One can almost say that this is a modern re-make of BEAU GESTE, but it also combines elements of MARCH OR DIE as well.  Still, there is enough here that is original and allows LEGIONAIRE to stand on its own with those two earlier classics.  The film movies quickly and is handsomely produced.  Fans of the Legion will surely enjoy, and those use to Van Damme in a different kind of film may be intriqued as well.  No doubt the only Legion film we may see for a while it follows in the tradition of that genre.  Recommended.",1129593600,2,1313,4.485232067510548
996862,3,6305259429,"I think the television listing description I read on this movie was misleading - actually no, it was wrong. According to what my TiVo said the story followed a 1920s playboy who returns from a stint in the Foreign Legion to reclaim his former lover (a mobster's girl). Obviously the person who wrote this has never seen this movie. For starters he wasn't so much a playboy as he was a boxer and for second he never returns to France to reclaim his former lover. In fact we learn through the progress of the film that the woman in question has emigrated to the United States.

Okay, enough gripes about how inaccurate tv listings can be - what did I think about the movie in question. It's actually okay as far as Jean Claude VanDamme movies go, except he really doesn't do much in the way of martial arts as he has in previous films. Instead he relies more on a rifle to shoot charging North African tribesmen or fists to straighten out fellow Foreign Legionnaire's who get their kicks out of bullying their weaker colleagues.

Jean Claude plays a boxer who, after reneging on a promise to throw a fight, escapes into the French Foreign Legion to flee the clutches of a murderous mobster. There he is flung headfirst into the North Africa war between the local nomadic tribesmen and the occupying French forces.

What was really a treat was the presence of Steven Berkoff. It's been awhile since I have seen him in a movie. He was a very high profile in the early to mid 1980s in movies such as `Beverly Hills Cop,' `Octopussy' and `Rambo: First Blood Part II' but then seemed to disappear from view. Here he plays the Foreign Legion commander who must lick the raw recruits into shape - and he dominates every scene in which he appears.

The action scenes are also well staged and you feel the danger in which the troops are thrust into, the movie makers also do a good job of conveying the confusion and chaos that comes from close quarters fighting.

If you enjoyed other Jean Claude movies then chances are this one will also hit the spot. It's not quite as good as `Sudden Death' (my favorite Jean Claude picture) but it's an entertaining ride.",1100736000,9,2149,4.5141388174807195
996863,4,6305259429,"I grew up watching ""Beau Geste"" (which is a film which deserves to be on DVD)and all other films about the French Foreign Legion fall or rise to that film's greatness.  That being so, ""Legionnaire"" stands as a solid drama of the men who join the legion to forget their past lives and to rebuild new ones--if they survive.  The film is well-crafted and the wide-screen format is perfect in bringing the viewer the feel of the desert--its vastness, its heat, and its beauty.  The film's action scenes are sensational and the final battles are both memorable and brutal.  Jean-Claude Van Damme proves he is more than just a good body or fighting machine--he does some fine acting in this film.  One wishes that it could be seen on the large screen--it deserves it.",1072656000,17,761,4.649253731343284

996866,4,6305259429,"Legionnaire is a flashback to the old Foreign Legion films starring Gary Cooper like Beau Geste or Gunga Din.  The movie tells the story of a boxer who betrays a French mob boss when he goes back on a deal.  He is then forced to join the Foreign Legion when he has nowhere else to turn too.  The film follows the training of the new company and then there battles against the Rif tribesmen.  This film is very different from most of Jean-Claude Van Damme movies, but it is very good.  He doesn't fight throughout the movie instead actually talking although there are plenty of action scenes.

 Surprisingly, Van Damme is very good as Alain DuChamps, the boxer forced into the Legion.  He is very believable in the role.  The supporting cast for this movie stands out as above average compared to other Van Damme action movies.  Nicholas Farrell is excellent as Macentosh, the ex-soldier with a weakness for gambling.  Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje plays Alain's friend, Luther, a man fed up with his past and how he's been treated. He is excellent in the supporting role to Van Damme and Farrell.  Also starring are Steven Berkoff and Jim Carter.  This is an excellent movie with grand landscapes in the African landscape, well put together action scenes, and believable characters.  This movie deserved better than its straight to video release.  The DVD offers widescreen presentation, a theatrical trailer and teaser, rare photographs of the Foreign Legion in action, and several behind the scenes documentaries and interviews with the cast and crew.

I was so amazed by the acting effort Van Damme put into this film despite the fact that it had absolutely no supporting cast. Van Damme takes out all the fancy kicking and relys mostly on the acting performance which in my mind is rare to see. With action here and there the drama mostly really catches you up in the moment. Even though the Quest{Van Dammes 1996 release}takes place in the 1900's,Legionnaire as well in the 1900's show epic war effects,this is Van Dammes first real war type movie,and by all standards it's a damn good one...",1053302400,,648,4.692982456140351
996994,4,6305259429,"This is not the typical chop-socky Van Damme flick. Heck, Van Damme doesn't even do his crescent kick, his cherished trademark. Instead, it's a war movie about the French Foreign Legion in 1925 that is sent to war in Africa. Van Damme plays Alain, a fugitive boxer who signs up with the Legion as a way of escape from gangsters. This all happens within the first 10 or so minutes. The large bulk of the film has Alain befriending his fellow legionnaires and learning the values of friendship even in a time of war. True, this movie is rather predictable and many of the characters seem cliche, but the cinematography, score and (surprisingly) acting are all above average. Even Van Damme pulls off a convincing performance, proving that when he's given a good script, he can be believable. The reason this $40 million film was never released in theaters was because of its downbeat ending. Don't be fooled by its direct-to-video nature, though. This is a good  one for the war/action fan.",1039392000,,988,4.744186046511628
996995,4,6305259429,"Van Damme has a few movies under his belt, but they are a mixed bunch, that's for sure.  Legionnaire, however, is one of Van Damme's better movies. Van Damme plays a Frenchman who joins the Foreign Legion after a tangled love affair goes wrong.  We get some action before Van Damme joins the Legion, by way of boxing matches and then we are provided with some quality military action set in the desert. I must confess to enjoying this movie.  Van Damme didn't overact and he actually suited the role. His supporting cast also did a nice job.  The locations were quite inspiring.  The script was very cliche in parts, but was acceptable.  The highlight for me was the ambush and climatic battle scene in the latter stages of the movie.  They were very well done. Overall, a well done action movie set around an uncommon theme and location. Recommended.",1029456000,22,851,4.633333333333334
996996,5,6305259429,"This immortal piece of cinema pits the genius Jean-Claude Van Damme to join the French legion. After establishing himself as ""A Genius"", Van Damme impersonates a French legion officer and he becomes the lone survivor after a merciless battle. I can see he was trying to be Rambo, but he fell a little short. Rambo is pretty much an icon in American history, you can't touch that. This movie should have played in the theaters instead of going straight-to-tape. Tragedy! A good effort though Van Damme.",1023235200,,501,4.837209302325581
996997,2,6305259429,"Jean-Claude Van Damme needs to stay direct-to-tape after this slow, drawn out movie. He joins the French legion after he doesn't take a fall for a couple of gangsters. Ludicrous piece of film-making which never surfaces and grabs the audience's attention. Van Damme has never really made a good action movie and he needs to go down in history as one of the worst action stars to ever hit Hollywood.",1022112000,,398,4.7
996998,4,6305259429,"You will love this movie or you will hate it. People expecting a usual Van Damme karate movie will be suprised to see that there isn't much of that kind of action in it. I watched this movie only a half hour ago and I liked all the way. The acting of Van Damme is at its best (Though its stil not good)This movie goes deeper than other Van Damme Flicks. People who say its boring probably bought this movie because they wanted to see Van Damme kick and punch his opponents to death.
Alain Lefevre (Van Damme) joins the foreigner Legion after double-crossing some kind of Maffia guy. In the Legion he makes friends that include a black guy that joined the Legion so he could escape America and go to Africa, an addicted Gambler from the U.K. and a sissy that wanted to prove himself to his Parents in law. They will be followed during the events they have in the Legion.
With a good dose of drama and Action, placed in beautiful settings, this movie provided me an entertaining 90 minutes. Its a shame that this movie didn't ended up in the theaters and Universal Soldier: The Return did. This movie is outstanding and without a doubt one of the best movies Van Damme has played in. Not only for Van Damme fans, but for everyone that loves a good movie.",992736000,,1252,4.354700854700854
996999,1,6305259429,"VAn Damme's movies were going nowhere, each one worser than the last one  ... Then a good idea came up: why don't try to make a kind of  ""epic"" movie, taking a lengendary theme (the French unit called  ""Foreigner Legion"" )and changing from the custumary scenario of  karate kicks and sterotyphed villains who want to rule the world ? Great  idea. I bought it. So, what disapointment after watching this.. it became  clear that, no matter how many movies he has already made, Van Damme will  never improve as an actor... EVery frame of the movie is wasted, making us  think that he is being bad orientated by his agents or film-producers. IT's  a totally unconving history, without pace and rhythm...",968025600,2,699,4.710743801652892
997000,5,6305259429,"Great movie - a historically correct depiction of the Legion of the '20s, and Van Damme plays a character who embodies the classic heroic traits of courage, honor and nobility.
The desert scenes, especially the marches,  convey the sense of struggle and tribulation with which every infantryman  is familiar.
Credits at the end are run to a beautiful rendition of the  immortal tune ""Mon Legionnaire"", made popular in the '30s when  recorded by Edith Piaf.",962236800,3,456,5.04
997001,4,6305259429,". . . it was not intended to be.
I like movies about the French Foreign Legion.  I like this movie.
All of the stock-characters and stereotypes are here, and the plot is as old as  . . . well . . . as old as movies  about the Legion!
Van Damme is, of course, the recruit seeking escape in  the Legion from enemies on civvy-street.  It is that preliminary background  that rather drags (""Yes, yes, he's on the run . . . get on with  it!"").  The training stage in Africa is not particularly well done,  either.  But once the ""bleus"" get marching to that far-away,  isolated fort-- and the Rifs-- the action picks up.
A number of reviewers  do not like this film because it is not a martial arts film.  That's their  prerogative.  But this was not billed as a ""Van Damme martial arts  film,"" so I think their criticism unfair.
Van Damme actually does  some acting, here, and he is more at home in a besieged fort or boxing ring  than in a night-club or romancing the ""female interest""  character.  It's not high-art, but it's entertaining, so pass the wine  ration and quit your grumbling!",956880000,5,1086,4.35678391959799
997002,3,6305259429,"This movie had a limited theatrical release over a week ago out here in South Africa. I had the privilege of seeing this on DVD purchased from Amazon last month. Due to the lack of publicity, marketing, and it's limited release this feature did not do well at the box office out here. It  is a great pity, as this is one of Van Damme's better offerings. Fans that  wants to see their hero doing his famous splits and martial arts moves will  be disappointed, but if you are wanting a good old-fashioned action  adventure without any elaborate special effects which seems to have taken  over movie making these days, Legionnaire fits the bill. Good battle  sequences, foreign legion heroics, some sweeping desert photography, plus a  strong supporting cast makes this Van Damme entry a worthwhile one. Special  note is the reliable Stephen Berkoff in his performance of the sadistic  legion leader.",954201600,2,897,4.848684210526316
