4237918,5,B004047XY8,"If it wasn't for how often the Cirque de Soleil type shows in this series cheerfully break the lawa of physics this could have been filmed in live action rather than animated.  And it would have likely been a huge hit on Nickelodeon or Disney, the story it that good.

And that is what makes this series something special.  The story follows Naegino Sora who comes to the US to join a permanent circus based in an unnamed coastal town called Kaleido Stage.  Despite arriving late after her luggage is grabbed by a street thief she is offered a position by Kalos the owner of the show.  Thus begins a series of trials as she tries to win the repsect and friendship of the other performers.

This series has a lot of heart and humor.  Each of Sora's trials is approached with care.  She gets through them with a never say die attitude and a bit of help from a few close friends.

The animation here is nothing special.  The artists clearly understood that the story needed to be in teh forefront and avoided making the animation too good.  It is colorful and the motion of the characters is smooth.

Children will love the bright colors and the impressive arcobatic shows, but adults will likely also find the story well written and dramatic.  This series is a great example of how animated shows should no longer be considered ""just for children.""",1324252800,,1346,4.535269709543568
4237919,5,B004047XY8,"Kaleido Star tells the story of a sixteen-year-old girl named Sora, who moves from Japan to California to audition for a role on Kaleido Stage. The shows in said stage are like a ballet, a circus acrobat act, and a light show rolled into one. It's genuinely suspenseful, lighthearted, and at times, undeniably cool. The cast includes a buff cop, a girl who loves comedy, a guy who harbors a crush on the heroine, a cute baby seal, and many more.
The packaging says it's rated TV-14, but I really disagree with that rating. Yeah, there's a character who wants to see Sora naked, but Sora catches on to his game from the get-go and does everything in her power to prevent such a thing from happening. It's a clean show.",1317427200,2,717,4.480916030534351
4237920,4,B004047XY8,"I watched this when I was a kid and now I'm bringing some memories back with this DVD. The price is not actually reasonable, kind of too expensive for just season one.
The quality is great; not blurry at all.
If the price was set just a little bit lower, then that'll be great.",1312675200,,277,4.148148148148148
4237921,5,B004047XY8,"Great and brand spanking new. Nothing was wrong with any of the disc, all the features that were mentioned was definately available, and the full season was greatly enjoyable. I received my purchase within 5 days which was sooner then I thought and I'm very happy with it. I plan to make a lot of future purchases with this seller when it comes to anime. Thanks and keep up the good work

P.S.- Awesome packaging too, lol there was no way those DVD's would be damaged. I'm talking perfect condition lol",1297123200,2,502,4.516483516483516
4237922,5,B004047XY8,"I have watched anime for a few years now and picked up Kaleido Star on a whim. I was truly stunned at how good this anime title is. The story centers around a young Japanese woman name Sora and her quest to become a star on the Kaleido Stage (similar to Cirque du Soleil). The anime details her struggles to establish herself as a Kaleido performer, as well as her adjustment from life in Japan to the United States, where the Kaleido Stage is located. It is an anime title that is appropriate for all ages and one of the best titles I have ever come across.
Note : I normally watch anime in English but I would highly recommend watching this in Japanese because the voice quality is so much better.",1295222400,3,699,4.303030303030303
4237923,5,B004047XY8,"It totally swept me away from the start to the end! This is a great mix of comedy and tears that draws us inside a world following the adventure of Sora Nagino who is the upcoming star learning how hard it is to rise to the top as a circus star, and one day become the dreams of young children and parents alike.  Fives stars out of five won't even give justice to this amazing anime.  Highly recommended for everyone of any age.",1290470400,10,429,4.156626506024097
4237924,3,B004047XY8,"Kaleido Star is an good series about trying to make your dreams come true. It's great if you like slice of life anime mixed in with drama. The only reason I am rating the show a three star is that the main character's voice in English is very irritating. But that's ADV's fault, not funimation. I just recommend watching this series in Japanese to avoid having your ears bleed. Not a lot of extras but it's a save edition.",1391904000,,422,4.3544303797468356
4237925,5,B004047XY8,"I love it, and my 6-year-old girl is fascinated with the series! It is so beautiful to watch and cheer for Sora, the main character.

I bought this when the price was about $25.00 and have never been happier to own an entire anime series (especially for the price; it's hard to find series under fifty dollars). The box is compact and neat and makes an excellent addition to any collection.",1386374400,,356,4.758064516129032

4237929,5,B004047XY8,"""Kaleido Star"" is a beautiful show about ambition and the efforts that are necessary to make your dreams come true.  From the creators of ""Sailor Moon"", this is a wonderful show that captures the magic of the performing arts (specifically acrobatics and circus arts) as well as the many of the struggles and challenges that such performing artists experience and face in order to make that ""magic"" a reality.

NOTES ABOUT CONTENT FOR PARENTS AND OTHER INTERESTED FOLKS:
To be honest, there's nothing...amazing, right?  I found nothing that could be an issue for the family.  There was no language issues and absolutely no fanservice (unless you consider typical acrobatic/circus attire as ""fanservicey"").  The only remote thing that can be construed that way is that Fool (""The Spirit of the Stage"") does have a very slight pervy streak...but not terribly so.  It's their for comic relief and it NEVER goes anywhere.  It's also never explicit about it and is simply a subtle thing.  Generally, Fool is a trusted friend who sincerely cares about those he looks over...and when he does get his pervy side on, Sora is there EVERY TIME to dump cold water through many amusing means and ways.  In essence, this really is clean-cut family series with wonderful lessons and a beautiful storyline that shouldn't be missed.

PLOT (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):
Though you don't need to be a performing artist to enjoy the drama and lessons found in this show, it really is a show that people in that field (or simply interested in that field) can truly relate, to.  There are so many wonderful themes and lessons that make it's way naturally into the show.  And on top of that, I love how what happens in previous episodes does influences the future episodes.  I love, also, how not all the issues aren't exclusively related to the performing arts.  As many artists know, life experience is a key necessity when expressing in the arts.  Furthermore, there's a wonderful balance of heart-wrenching drama and uplifting, inspiring moments.  There's also a good sprinkling of humor throughout, so you never feel too weighed down by the more serious aspects of the show.  You really get to delve into many of the characters' backstories and motivations...basically, they are pretty well fleshed out.  The show is fairly predictable...but, for me, I could care less about that.  The story telling and pacing was simply well done.  I'd rather have a good story than ""unpredictable plot twists"", anyways.  And need I say, there are some pretty amazing action sequences?  If you are a performing artist...or at least interested in that ""culture""...this is definitely a show worth the watch.

DUB VERSUS SUB:
First off, just so that you know where I'm coming from,  I'm a person that is pretty neutral about the DUB VERSUS SUB issue.  I take it very much on a case by case basis. In my collection of foreign films and shows (it's not all anime haha) I'm pretty well split between shows where I prefer the English dubbing and shows where I prefer English subtitling.  In the case of ""Kaleido Star"" I will just throw it out there: I greatly prefer (and enjoy) the English dubbing over the subtitling.  But please allow me to explain.  Yes, it is true that some of the script of the English dubbing isn't always exactly the same as what is found in the subtitling, but this is not so much a case of ""inaccurate translation"".  For those familiar with the translation industry, this is known as ""Dynamic Equivalent""...basically taking the spirit of a phrase from the source language and reworking it in a way that keeps the general meaning while is more natural and draws a similar emotional response from the target audience's language.  After all, language is very much about culture, too; and some phrases and idioms in one culture just doesn't translate well, or is not as emotionally potent in another culture.  For instance, during a segment where some folks are badmouthing Sora behind her back, they are accusing her of ""getting on the boss's good side"".  Then the subtitles say ""I heard she's even maneuvered her way onto the stage already.""  Though the meaning is pretty clear, that is not how a typical American would word it.  So, the dub says it this way, ""I've heard she's even sweet-talked her way on to the stage, already.""  Same meaning, but the dub script has much more needed spunk considering the context and the character speaking.  There are also a few (very few...but still a few) minor lines that were swapped out in the dub for another line because they were kind of awkward and actually could feel ""out of context"".  Believe it or not, in my opinion, some of the original lines broke some of the mood and context of the situation...but the dub ""fixed"" that. I'll give you an example: this happens as part of the previous mentioned situation.  One character says that she can't believe how Sora got in when she herself had to try three times.  Another character (who is a ""wannabe-comedian"") tries to follow up by making a joke about how that other character took 3 tries to get in...but fails miserably and looks away in shame and embarrassment.  At that point the other girl responds:  subs say something to the effect of ""wow! you look so cute with that look on your face (referring to her look of embarrassment)!"".  The dubbing, on the other hand, says (and I paraphrase), ""uhhh (in an awkward sense)....let's just forget about it, okay"".  Both lines were meant to be a minor comic relief...but, frankly, I think the dub was much more effective in it's slight humor while maintaining the mood of the overall situation.  Point is, the dub was actually really well done and stays quite true to the storyline and situations therein...in fact, it adds the necessary ""umph"" that the original lines kind of miss (simply because we wouldn't say some of those things in that way).  As to the dubbing voice work, I love the voices...but I say that realizing that may not be the case for every viewer.  The voice types are not ""Cowboy Bebop"" where almost everyone universally agrees it's phenomenal, but a type that is more of a ""you'll love it or hate it"" kind of deal.  I personally like it over the Japanese voices.  Also, it helps that this show takes place in California, USA (looks like the San Francisco area) most of the time haha.  As diverse as California is, culturally speaking, I'm sure that not everyone there can speak fluent Japanese.

EXTRAS:
There are really no extras besides an episode commentary and textless opening/ending themes all in the last disc.  Also, of course, there are trailers for other shows.  Most of the fun extras are in ""Kaleido Star : The Complete Second Season"" (including the OVAs)

ALL IN ALL:
This is a wonderful show that captures the magic of performing...and hard work it takes to put together a beautiful production.  I love how, though it focuses especially on the performers, the background crew isn't too overshadowed and does play a fairly prominent role as well.  There are many wonderful lessons...but most of all, it is an inspiring story that leaves you feeling like you can conquer the word, and inspires you to use your abilities to bring joy and beauty to a world that is already filled with trials and tribulations.  I would definitely recommend the show.",1374192000,5,7305,4.795363709032774
4237930,3,B004047XY8,"I read the description of this series, and some of the reviews, and thought it looked like an interesting plot.  Unfortunately, I can't recommend this for adults.  It is a kids series.  I bought both seasons, and could only finish 6 episodes of the first season.  Each episode is pretty much a standalone episode, and the plots are very simplistic.  I didn't hate it, it just couldn't hold my interest.  But if you have kids, I think it would be a great series for them to watch.  There are good moral stories, and the characters are likeable.",1372896000,,543,4.536082474226804
4237931,4,B004047XY8,"This anime is not for those hate cheesy, predictable, corny, and slightly boring animes. If you loved Sailor Moon or Princess Tutu, then put this product in your cart, because you will love it.
I hold a special place in my heart for this anime for many random reasons.
But first: Kaledio Star is about Sora, a Japanese gymnast that dreams to make it big in America at Kaleido Stage. In the anime, making it to Kaledio Stage is like the Olympics or something. So she gets to the Stage, impresses the owners and boom, starts appearing in shows. Of course there are trials and tribulations for Sora, but she always believes in herself and makes the best out of every situation.
So the reason I gave this anime 4 stars is:
1. The animation is 90% amazing all the time. There are a few episodes where it is off, but most of the time it didn't bother me.
2. I did like the voice actors. One of the main males, Ken, voice is way off personally to me. But the rest are pretty spot on.

The Season One SAVE has the first 26 episodes. There isn't any commentaries or extras. The box is very sturdy and nice so I personally think it is work the $20-30 bucks.

That is pretty much it. The Story is very very predictable and corny. But if you like a story about believing in yourself/your dreams, and never giving up then this anime is for you. If you like an anime with action and a meaningful story, then STAY AWAY. The price is good and its a fun anime to add to your collection.",1370995200,,1469,4.242857142857143
4237932,4,B004047XY8,"Sora has always dreamed of coming to L.A. and becoming a member of the Kaleido Stage performing troupe. She makes the trip and with a little luck, gets accepted into the troupe. Her cheerful attitude and relentless determination quickly make her some great friends and fierce rivals. The girl she idolizes, Layla, is beautiful, graceful, strong, and everything that Sora strives to become. She eventually earns the chance to play a role as Layla's partner. The 2 of them have the potential to become a legend in the acrobatic world. But they will face much adversity and many trials on their way to achieving their dreams.

At first I was a little hesitant about this anime. Being a guy, I wasn't sure if a PG rated show about acrobatics and the circus would appeal to me. I'm glad that I took a chance on it. Even though it is definitely geared toward females and a younger audience, it has an uplifting and universal appeal that can grab the interest of almost anyone, despite their gender or age. Kaleido stage has a captivating story, great characters, and plenty of drama. The animation, soundtrack, and voice acting are all very well done. Watching this anime makes you forget about your troubles and escape into a dazzling would of fun, dreams, and determination. It has some great lessons to teach. Never giving up, always doing your best, and having faith in yourself & your friends, are all major themes in this series. It's extremely uplifting.

After hearing all the great things I said about it, and seeing all the other 5 star reviews, you are probably wondering why I'm not giving it 5 stars. I have seen a lot of anime, and I own over 300 titles, so my standards are a little higher. Than most I think. I can't give it 5 stars because I don't think that Kaleido Star achieved it's full potential. I think that there were some episodes that really didn't need to be there. Instead of some of the ""filler"" episodes, I think that they should have developed a stronger bond between Sora and Ken. Ken has very strong feelings for Sora, and would lay in traffic for her. Much to my aggravation, Sora didn't even acknowledge him most of the time. This is very annoying to me.

Another thing that I don't like about this show is the spirit of the stage. There is a spirit named Fool. He is sort of like the familiar for acrobats that have the potential to achieve greatness. I don't like him. He is totally creepy. His voice, appearance, and mannerisms all make my skin crawl. I think he takes away from the show.

I realize that these are not huge issues, and there is another season of Kaleido Star that can resolve my first complaint about the lack of romance. I just think that it could have been developed in this season. Despite my 2 little complaints, I really enjoyed Kaleido Star. I'll definitely get season 2. If I could rate this a 4.5 I would, but I can't. I'll just have to give it 4 because it doesn't quite earn all 5. Overall, Kaleido Star is very good. It is suitable for almost all ages and genders. I highly recommend it, and I hope that you enjoy it as much as I did.",1360108800,4,3095,4.4822695035460995
