This definitely won't be everyone's cup of tea though, it's pretty out there.",1380672000,,259,4.3061224489795915
8322051,4,B001MVYTS0,"Interesting film. Oddly enough, I stumbled across this film at a local library! I read the premise and had to see how this was executed.

It's filmed very amateur style, but not poorly. The fact that it's black and white I think adds to it. There are some really nice looking shots, as well as some truly creepy ones. The acting is well...hard to say. It really comes off as if everyone is just being themselves, but not in a way that looks bad. It almost feels like a home movie instead of a real film. I think in this way, it makes the events that unfold have that much more of an impact on you.

I only have 2 complaints: 1. It moves a bit slow at parts. 2. The killing scenes aren't very well filmed, especially the 2nd. All in all, it's an interesting concept and I feel it's worth checking out. The fact that there are 2 actual handicapped people in the film is neat. Make sure to check out the interviews as well, very good stuff.",1303344000,,937,4.2
8322052,5,B001MVYTS0,"Late Bloomer, is a film that many people have described as being interesting, but not for everyone.  I'd agree to that full heartedly.  But, what I'd add is for the people that enjoy films that respect the actors in allowing them to explore a fantasy.  Here, is a film about a handicap man (who is truly handicap) going on a killing spree.  It's also a film about taking a person that most people in the world would consider to be helpless and in away empowering him to take charge. He gets to be just one of the guys.  It happens that one of the guys is a mass murder, but it's his way it helps him let out his anger towards the world and join society.

When I first picked up this film I was interested, because the idea of a person in a wheelchair killing people sounded funny.  But, by the end of the film I wasn't laughing, but completely fascinated by this character and what he had become in a society that sees him as nothing, but a wheelchair.

In the end I give this film a full 5 stars, after watching this film, I can't stop thinking about and it's been 3 month since I've seen it. It's a good slow film that explores the relationship between a handicap person and their environment.

Also, if you are interest in film on the subject of handicap people that are done extremely well check out ""Oasis"" a South Korea masterpiece.  One of the most depressing and beautiful films I've ever seen.",1257897600,,1402,4.316793893129771
8322053,4,B001MVYTS0,"The material in this film about a disabled serial killer is very well handled.  The direction was excellent for a lower budget film and the acting was spot on - I am glad to have this film in my collection.  The story will def. upset those that are easily offended, but this is a genre gem and an original film to be sure.  The severe disability the main actor suffers in real life and on the screen brings an emotional kick in the pants with it as the story unfolds and be sure to check out the DVD interveiws of the cast involved!!!  I am glad I took a chance on this one.",1254096000,,574,4.053097345132743
8322054,4,B001MVYTS0,"This might be the only serial killer film featuring a handicapped actor that you ever see.  Late Bloomer completely upends the dust covered apple cart of Asian horror.  Filmed in gritty black and white, with sporadic, dissonant music, Late Bloomer comes off at times like a less frenetic Tetsuo, rather than the typical elaborately atmospheric Asian chiller.  I was impressed by the stylistic flourishes during the violent moments as it contrasted well with the mundane depiction of the lead character's day-to-day routine.  I liked that the handicapped lead wasn't looked down upon or made to seem overly sympathetic.  He is just a regular guy when it comes to the basic wants:  he likes to eat, drink, hang out with his friends, and has an appreciation for his young female  caretakers.  Despite his profound handicap, he has learned to exist in his environment.

Late Bloomer stands well apart from the rest of the crowd and that's why I recommend it to fans of lower budget, independent cinema.  Fans of fast-paced American style movies will most likely find many reasons to hate this film.  Rather than a true 4 star rating, this is more in the 3.5 star range to me.  I'm having a Catch 22 moment with the casting of an actual handicapped actor to play the lead.  The handicap certainly comes across as authentic, but due to the fact that the lead actor speaks by typing his responses into a voice machine and that he appears unable to show much emotion with his facial expressions, when the killing starts, it doesn't feel very real.  This effect is probably the intention of the director, and I can appreciate the thought behind it, but my thoughts and emotions weren't as involved as I would have liked.  Still, I appreciate the amibition of the film maker and the end result is something you should at least take a look at.",1247702400,2,1832,4.735015772870662
