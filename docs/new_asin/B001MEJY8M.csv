3695351,4,B001MEJY8M,"Probably the most solid slasher flick I've seen in awhile.
(especially considering the lack of slashing)
It's an Autrian slasher flick, (so it's in german, if you speak german)
though surprisingly every song on the soundtrack appears to be in English.
If you don't like subtitles, that's alright, 'cause it comes dubbed,
and can I just say.. I don't remember ever hearing a better dubbing job.

For those who know slashers:
It's acts like a 90's slasher (Scream, I Know What You Did, Urban Legend, etc.)
without any of the humor.
Picture those movies if their puppy just got hit by a missile.
It's not funny like ""Hatchet"", it's a lot more serious.
It's not overly gory like ""Laid to Rest"", (it does have it's moment though)
It's slower and more involving than both.
And it's probably 14 thousand times more engaging than ""Cold Prey"" could ever hope to be.
But it's not getting nearly as much love as any of the aforementioned.
The only issue I can see some people having with this flick, is that it drags it's feet at some points.
All in all I'd say this slasher ""should"" be the epitome of the term ""sleeper""

It's about a group of friends who all receive a message on their phone
saying that each will be dead in 3 days.
... they pay no mind to it... 'til one of them disappears.
Yes it's a vengeance plot we've seen before, but this time around it has;
actual characters, with real character development,
played by actors & actresses who can actually act,
some gore (1 scene in particular is brutal),
believable dialogue, excellent cinematography,
and for whatever reason the director seems either,
obsessed with water,
or is bashing you over the head with foreshadowing.
Every other scene is of water, and practically every death involves it.
But there is method to this madness.
There is method.

MORAL OF THE STORY:
Keep your friends close.. really close.. or they might disappear.

3695352,3,B001MEJY8M,"This was not as bad of a movie than what I expected even though it was a subtitled German film which I didn't know when I started it but overall it a pretty descent low budget scary movie. It kind of reminded me of the ""I Know what you did last Summer"" movies.",1250812800,,260,3.9245283018867925
3695353,2,B001MEJY8M,"(1.) The best part of the movie was the background to the opening credits and maybe, as the Amazon  reviewer said, the restroom. Anyway, after 3 minutes it goes down hill rapidly as most of the movie is devoted to weak partying and driving skills interspersed with a few minutes of retread of other ""disturbed slasher chasing after dumb graduates"" movies (if there's a survivor then it's usually a girl that survives these coed maulings  - guys, you need better script writers).
(2.) Serious inconsistencies: How is that people can be captured and bound by a rain parka hooded killer, sometimes in public, without a struggle or people noticing. Then rowed far out into a deep lake and thrown in with a heavy weight where later people on a dock can see the body and swim down to it. Or when tossed in, despite the fact that no one is within a mile, a police dive team some how appears out of no where to rescue the victim (victim must have gills). On top of that the police do not search boat houses nearby for evidence (duh!) and in fact the police play the dumb cop role so well they are always coming across the victims after the fact. Cops need better script writers.
(3.) Without realism and credibility this movie is an outside-the-restroom, washout. I suggest a ""SAWx"" rerun instead.",1247011200,,1289,4.575757575757576
3695354,3,B001MEJY8M,"Calling Dead in 3 Days a German take on I Know What You Did Last Summer would pretty much sum up all there is to know about this film, with the only exception being that Dead in 3 Days is far superior, and in reality despite the many horror/slasher conventions it follows, is better than a majority of mainstream American horror flicks.  The film follows around a group of attractive grads who all receive a text message telling them, you guessed it, they'll be dead in 3 days.  Before you know it, they're being picked off one by one by a hooded killer.  There's some decent gore, and even some decent scares to be found in Dead in 3 Days, as well as some gorgeous cinematography as well.  Other than that, Dead in 3 Days doesn't offer anything that you haven't seen countless times before, but the film is still worth a look at the very least for die hard slasher fans.",1243468800,4,871,4.3580246913580245
3695355,3,B001MEJY8M,"This movie was only so-so.  No in-depth plot that built tension, no suspense, no elan vital.  This is basically the story of a group of teen-agers who receive threats that they will be dead in three days.  Then they mindlessly go around worrying.  Sure enough...in three days each is dead. The movie was made worse by poor acting.",1242172800,,330,4.637931034482759
3695356,2,B001MEJY8M,"Dead in 3 Days is for the most part tedious and dull. I fell asleep about an hour and twenty minutes in. When I woke up the movie was over and I had to skip to where I was watching the movie when I fell asleep. A critic on [...] reviewed the DVD and said that it is the best slasher movie he's seen in a long time. I think it's one of the worst. It's a little better than Shrooms, but not by much. There's only one death scene that's even gory. Skip this and see a great slasher like Hatchet, Killer Movie, or Gutterballs.",1236297600,3,522,3.9339622641509435
3695357,5,B001MEJY8M,"This movie ran in Austrian cinemas some years ago and it`s really a well made slasher film, done on a shoestring budget with good non professional actors. Some setpieces remind us of the glory days of Argento and other great directors. Saw today Part 2, which is even better and a lot more gruesome than the first one. An absolute must have for any slasher aficionado who likes his kills with some depth to story and characters.",1230422400,8,428,4.571428571428571

""In 3 Tagen bist du tot.""
Ah, the sweet halcyon days of youth.  Graduation.  A fabulous future to look forward to, but first, let's party......and meet grisly ends.  This is why I don't read text messages.  In this case, some yahoo with a long standing grudge finally decides to seek revenge.  Why?  Why now?  Why this small group of friends?  Good questions all, and all is revealed as the story slowly builds momentum.  What I liked best about this typical slasher flick was the measured way it handled the suspense.  The killings were very matter of fact.  The story featured people going about their business, their ordinary lives, and then suddenly they were slammed by this unstoppable force propelled with a hatred unbound.  There was a lot of finesse at work here, plus some beautiful cinematography.  I especially liked that an image of water always preceded each killing, be it a dripping faucet or water trickling down a car windshield.  There was a sense of cold inevitability infused throughout the film.  Sometimes you just can't escape doom, or karma.

I watched this film in German, with English subtitles.  It helps to hear the actor's voice and not some substitute.  The actress playing Nina (Sabrina Reiter) won an Undine Award for best film debut by an actress (in her first screen role).  Supposedly, this film was followed by a 2008 sequel titled In 3 Tagen Bist Du Tot 2, also featuring the character Nina.

I'm glad I took a chance and bought this film for my collection.",1410220800,,1510,4.756756756756757
8320989,5,B001MEJY8M,"DEAD IN 3 DAYS is a vengeful-maniac-on-the-loose movie out of Austria. A group of young, beautiful friends is being stalked and killed in nasty ways, after receiving the menacing text messages of the title. At first glance, this is a clone of I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. However, I found it to be superior to SUMMER in both pacing (slower and more suspenseful) and atmosphere (more bleak). The characters were more believable as well. The claim that they made stupid decisions is humorous, considering A) the idiotic actions of teens / twenty-somethings in just about every slasher film ever made, and B) the idiotic actions of teens / twenty-somethings (myself included) in real life! As for the killer, I was impressed by the grim, determined manner in which this person dispatched the victims. The killer's identity might have been obvious, but the way it was revealed was, at least, interesting. DI3D is one of the better DIMENSION EXTREME offerings...",1368230400,,961,4.975155279503106
8320990,5,B001MEJY8M,This movie is one that will keep you wondering as it goes along. I am glad I bought it. :),1360540800,,90,3.55
8320991,3,B001MEJY8M,"After a close-knit clique of kids graduate from high school, their lives are still boring until they all get the same creepy text message, ""You'll be dead in 3 days"" (hence the clever title of the film). They all ignore what they think is a message from their creepy school mate Patrick (Julian Sharp) who is too much of a suspect for a movie. While the kids get kidnapped and murdered, the film doesn't show use the killer's face right away as the main suspect changes. The twist is nothing new to American audiences.

The film moves at a slow pace and is more of a serial murder mystery than a hard core slasher film. The swearing seemed forced and out of place, almost like Spock in ""Star Trek IV"".

My DVD defaulted to the German language. I needed to go into the set up and change it to English.

F-bomb, brief sex, brief nudity (Julia Rosa St&ouml;ckl,Nadja Vogel)",1333670400,,870,4.459119496855346
8320992,4,B001MEJY8M,"It isn't anything new nor does it bring anything earth shattering to the audience; but, it was enjoyable.  The movie was a bit slow in the beginning but once the group discovers the body of their missing member it picks up.  The reasoning behind the texts and the deaths are explained.  There's not mysterious ghost girl with dark hair covering her face or any effects.  It is simply a nice little slasher flick.  There isn't alot of gore or nudity.  I think there was only one sex scene and the killings were quick the most gruesome one involving a fishtank.",1298246400,,559,4.54
8320993,4,B001MEJY8M,"Some really amazing camera work and acting in this little film from Germany. A few odd plot choices and some INCREDIBLY stupid choices by the cops and possible victims (does no one lock their doors in Germany?) barely mar what is really a great horror film. Highly reccomended unless you watch these films to see boobs. If so, go back to Rob Zombie schlock.",1285200000,,357,4.59375
8320994,3,B001MEJY8M,"Breathtaking background and a decent story make this worth watching at least once. I liked it however I am a huge horror fan so perhaps biased. Just to give you an idea of My own taste I did NOT enjoy ""I know what you did last summer"" as the acting was HORRIBLE. To me this film had a plot, some decent acting (not all) and a decent story. I thought it was well made as I really enjoy the Dimension Extreme line of films.",1276992000,,421,4.023809523809524
