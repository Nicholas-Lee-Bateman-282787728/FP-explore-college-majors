7821954,4,6302168279,"I bought this for my granddaughter who is almost three because she's scared of bugs.  The DVD shows preschool children looking at insects, worms, snails, spiders and other creepy crawlies.  They play with the little animals and imitate them.  Throughout the DVD, the children are singing ""Bugs Don't Bug Us!""  I used the video when I taught kindergarten, and the children loved it.",1355961600,,381,5.0
7821955,5,6302168279,"This beautiful movie has our daughter very excited about bugs. Her favorite outdoor activity is now searching for bugs. We also shared this movie with a friend whose daughter was afraid of bugs, and it has done wonders to assuage her fears. The last segment, depicting the life cycle of the butterfly, is so calming it has put both my daughter and I to sleep on several occasions. We love Bugs Don't Bug Us!",1242432000,,407,4.513513513513513
7821956,1,6302168279,I show this to groups of 4-6 year olds and they are all bored and squirrely the whole time.,1144627200,,91,3.8421052631578947
7821957,3,6302168279,"We purchased this for my 16 1/2 mo. old to help him overcome his recently-developed fear of insects. A group of multi-ethnic as well as a couple of special needs children narrate this video.  Children are shown playing with,  searching for, and imitating the movements of various bugs (these particular scenes can go on and on and on...).  The pace is very slow  and lackadaisal (especially by today's flashy & fast-paced standards) as the children are shown sitting in circles, frolicking in tall grasses, and letting the bugs crawl on their hands and arms. I don't quite consider this video to be educational in the sense that insects are presented in an organized fashion with a narrator sharing little tidbits of facts about them.  In fact,  at times the bugs aren't even identified or mentioned by name at all,  which left me scratching my head trying to figure out what to call them.  It made me wonder if I could get some neighbor kids together and produce such a video myself!  I also noticed that while this video is entitled,  ""Bugs Don't Bug Us,""  it actually depicts a variety of invertebrates (which it mentions on the back flap).  For instance,  a snail is not really considered a bug;  it is a mollusk.  If you want your child,  especially your older child to learn proper classification,  I don't recommend purchasing this video.  If you,  however,  want to use this video as a ""psychological"" tool to help your toddler or preschool overcome a fear,  it's perfect!  In addition to this video,  you might take your toddler outside and go bug hunting or design your own antfarm (it's really easy - directions for this all over the internet).  This video depicts:  spiders, ants (in the wild and in an antfarm), snails, inchworms, earthworms, bees (on flowers and in an beehive/farm), dragonflies, preying mantises, caterpillars, ladybug, roly polies/potato bugs,  and many more I can't remember;-) One thing I really liked:  It demonstrated the process of two different caterpillars metamorphosing into butterflies.  Hope this helps!",1120435200,,2047,4.9411764705882355
7821958,4,6302168279,Bugs Don't Bug Us is an excellent video.  Children observe bugs in a gentle and confident manner as they provide bits of information about the bugs they are observing.  The video provides a view of bugs in a non-theatening way flowing from one small being to the next.,996019200,2,268,4.5625
