HIGH VOLTAGE is best for collectors of the earliest talkies and for fans of Carole Lombard and Hopalong Cassidy creator William Boyd.

2945125,2,B000VL8Z32,"In spite of the fact that this film stars Carole Lombard, I recommend that you pass on this one. The story is that a bus is trying to cross Nevada's alkali flats when a winter storm hits and forces the passengers to take refuge in an abandoned church miles from the nearest town. Carole Lombard plays Billie, a young woman being taken to prison. The other passengers include the cop that is accompanying Billie, a young girl, a banker, and, of course the bus driver. The group enters the church to find they are not alone. Bill (William Boyd) has found shelter there too, has a large stash of food, and wants to order everyone around.

This is one of those films in which a bunch of characters of diverse backgrounds are forced to sit through a crisis and talk about themselves. However, ""Petrified Forest"" this is not. Because it is an early sound film the director seems to think somebody has to be saying something all of the time, whether or not it is interesting or done in a non-monotonous tone. It will be the longest hour in your life.

This film was made by Pathe, a company that had been great in its heyday, but whose fortunes were flagging by 1929. This is a public domain copy. That means all of the problems with the video and audio - and there are plenty - are still there. The only thing worse than boring stilted conversation is boring stilted conversation you can't hear well.

8219353,5,B000VL8Z32,Interesting old movie. I could tell these actors weren't used to relying on dialogue to tell their story as talkies were still fairly new so it may seem boring and stilted to some but I enjoy old movies and the early years of this dynamic industry.,1514332800,,248,4.413043478260869

In fact, I understand this was Carole Lombard's first talking picture (billed as ""Carol Lombard""), at 20 or 21 years old!  I wouldn't have recognized the screwball comedy star she'd soon become.

Miss Lombard always had that underlining perfect comedic persona.,1475798400,,339,4.964912280701754

This makes it the first talkie for Carole Lombard and William Boyd (Hop-Along Cassidy). Watching the movie, it appears that more experience was needed before they were ready to make great talkies.
The description of the movie is a little off.  Bill (William Boyd) is not reluctant to share his food.  He just, wisely, rations it as they do not know how long they will be trapped.  The sound track is very poor and difficult to understand.  I tried closed captioning but it lagged so far behind the speakers that I really ended up watching it instead of the movie.
