""Madman's Paradise"" has Grimlock and Daniel emerge in a fantasy world, where magic reigns supreme.  The deep storyline, in that the Autobots must decide who is the good guys and who isn't, adds a depth seldom seen in American cartoons.

""Grimlock's New Brain"" features the origin of the Technobots.  (They were actually first seen in ""Money is Everything"").  In this episode, Grimlock gains enough intellect to become the smartest of Trnsformers.  However, this adds contention between him and the other Dinobots.

7897097,5,6305876738,"This is a great volume!  The first episode (Madman's Paradise) is about Daniel who is upset because he is lonely.  Grimlock follows him and manages to get the two of them flying through an old tunnel inside Cybertron.  they  find themselves in an old room that has old Quintesson markings and  pictures on the wall that seemed to have been carved out.  Daniel sees one  of the pictures and makes a comment about the dragon in it and Grimlock  defends it by saying ""It handsome like me, Grimlock"" but  accidently hits the picture with his tail and the floor opens up like a red  disc and the fall through.  Meanwhile, Daniel's mother is looking for him  so Blaster sends out Steeljaw to find him.  Blaster, Steeljaw, Rewind,  Ultra Magnus, Perceptor, and Ramhorn find the room and Blaster ejects Eject  to decifer what the inscriptions mean.  He figures out that the room was  made to send away Quintesson criminals before the Autobots were created.  All of the Transformers and Daniel's mother go through the portal except  for Perceptor, who stays behind to help them get back, and search for  Daniel and Grimlock.  Meanwhile Daniel and Grimlock find themselves in a  strange land and are soon attacked.  I'm not going to give anything away so  I'll stop there, but to find out what happens buy the volume but it is a  fairly good Transformers episode.  For the next episode (Grimlock's New  Brain)it starts out with Ultra Magnus giving a speech to a group of  Autobots about a new power platform that they are starting up.  Grimlock,  who is supposed to do the honors of activating the power platform, forgets  which switch to pull and sets off an alarm.  Rodimus and Perceptor race up  to help him and Perceptor makes a remark on how he wishes for the Dinobots  to have more sophisticated brains.  However, two fleshings hired by  Galvatron put anti-electrons into it to make the Autobots' circuits glitch  so badly that they will have to leave Cybettron forever.  So Rodimus, Kup,  Ultra Magnus, and Grimlock leave with Perceptor's electro-map to shut it  down but they have to go down to the ancient tunnels of Cybertron to do it.  After Grimlock breaks the electro-map, Grimlock have a tantrum because  Rodimus upset him because of a comment he made and Kup follows him to make  sure he doesn't trip an automatic alarm in the tunnels and Magnus and  Rodimus go in a seperate direction.  Kup and Grimlock find it and because  Kup is affected by the anti-electrons, Grimlock must turn off he machine  and of course he does it by hitting and kicking the controls but when he  bites a wire his mind becomes overloaded with energy and his knowledge  expands rapidly (he probably remembered everything he ever knew because of  it).  So, he and Kup go to find Magnus and Rodimus and save them from a  security drone in a tunnel.  Grimlock figurs out the problem was becuase of  anti-electrons and deduces that the anti-electrons were from Unicorn's body  before he exploded and hat the Decepticons have figured out that there are  more in Unicron's brain (which is true because the fleshings that were  hired told Galvatron where he could find more).  When the Autobots get  there they find Galvaton has an anti-electron gun the hard way and crash  land in Unicron's head, where a battle persues between the Autobots and the  Terrorcons.  Grimlock races from the battle further into Unicron's head and  starts to create Nosecone, the first of the Technobots, who then drills a  pasage into Unicron's cerebral cortex and he creates the rest of the  Technobots there.  I also don't wan tto give away the ending of this  awesome TF episode so to find out what happens buy it!  They are definately  awesome episodes with the third season openers and closers and the little  sequences after each episode that tell a little about the Transformers.  A  must have for any Transfan!",962928000,6,3872,4.741691842900302
