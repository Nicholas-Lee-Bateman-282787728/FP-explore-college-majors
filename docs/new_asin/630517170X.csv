I would've liked to seen more interviews of the cast (Bob Todd, Jackie Wright, Henry Mcghee, etc...) and less of the american actors.  It was good though to see actual footage of the great legend showing us where he grew up, and also him talking about his family.  They should've ended the video with a more sentimental note like a tribute, or a montage or something like that.",1058918400,,446,4.481481481481482
7884521,5,630517170X,"those are the words that poured out of Henry McGee's mouth every Saturday night when i watched Benny's TV show on my local ABC station. despite that all-new material was edited into other skits that could be 10 or 11 years older didn't seem to phase me. when Benny walked out on stage as Fred Scuttle or Chow Mein, it could be 1985 or 1973 and i wouldn't have a clue or cared for that matter. Benny Hill ran in America from 1969-1989 in syndication usually late at night or early morning. his rare 1960s shows on local BBC stations in England have never been shown on American TV but some of his skits from that era are on this video. he was born Alfie Hill and he took his first name from the one and only Jack Benny. i won't give out any other information except that this video shows the rise and ""fall(?)"" of Benny's brand of humor particularly in the late '80s when feminists were gaining respect from advertiser's. BBC canned Benny Hill because of feminists but that's only a few seconds worth of the nearly hour documentary on the versatile Benny Hill. i've often thought: i'm a guy who WANTS to see Benny Hill's show and so what makes the opinions of a feminist MORE important than mine? celebrity guest stars who talk about Benny include Burt Reynolds and Mickey Rooney among others. and yes, the Hill's Angels are also featured. this is a wonderful video, too bad it wasn't an hour or more.",1047772800,3,1400,4.430232558139535

This video takes you behind the scenes for a fascinating look at his life and times, from childhood and the early days of his career, to life at the  top, talking in-depth about his unique brand of comedy and the pleasures  and pitfalls of celebrity.  The only reason that I gave ""Benny  Hill-The World's Favorite Clown"" four out of five stars is because I  expected a little bit more regarding the content. I wish the tape was a  little bit longer than 50 minutes. I mean, surely, there must be more  footage from this tape somewhere! I hoped to see more interviews from cast  members and from the man himself, Benny Hill. I guess we're left wanting  more.  ""Benny Hill-The World's Favorite Clown"" is a candid  and revealing look at one of comedy's true kings, at home, and very much at  play! After viewing the tape you will love him even more, I sure do. My  advice is to buy this video, It's GREAT!",936316800,8,974,4.404494382022472
