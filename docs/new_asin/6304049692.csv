1937347,1,6304049692,My three year old who loves lions was sorely disappointed. We found the story telling slow and sparse. The ending didn't make much sense and we were left feeling underwhelmed. Even the Christmas aspect of it was not well represented.,1454716800,,233,4.85

1937375,2,6304049692,"I would give this about 2 1/2 stars if I could.  My children seemed to enjoy this, but I found the story was too absurdly contrived, even for a fairy tale.  I also found that Amy Grant's voice and accent was grating and completely miscast.  The cartoon creates a sense of nervous tension and even fear to then make its simple point at the end.  I felt the tactic was needless, and I could tell that it was negatively affecting my four-year old.",1424390400,,444,4.313253012048193

1937387,5,6304049692,"I wasn't certain just from seeing the title, if I would like it. When I saw the nearly 5 stars Review from others, I decided to watch it and I am so Happy that I did! This was a GREAT and a Wonderful Animated Story. Even with the Narrations of Amy Grant and Christopher Reeve it was an Excellent Story! Buy the DVD for the kids, grandkids and older kids at heart!",1418515200,2,363,4.055555555555555
1937388,5,6304049692,Wonderful story.,1418515200,,16,7.5
1937389,5,6304049692,My three year old and six year old nephews loved this video! I did need to explain the premise of the show as to how it related to Christmas because of their ages.,1417996800,,163,3.9696969696969697

1937405,5,6304049692,"A wonderful heartwarming story about the compassion, caring, and love between a full grown lion and a newborn lamb. A story that is filled with warmth and makes you wish the world could have these same feelings toward others. I would enjoy seeing more movies of this status.",1412121600,,274,4.729166666666667
1937406,5,6304049692,"We initially had this film in VHS, which was played every year at Christmastime.  My daughter has been especially touched in her heart by this video.  For her, this is Christmas.  She's now 27 and wants her daughter to fall I love with this story as she did.  It is well done, narrated by Christian singer Amy Grant and the late actor Christopher Reeve.  It is well beyond the stereotypical Christmas animated films with Santa.  No dancing or singing. But very thoughtful rendition of the lion lying down with the lamb.",1392854400,2,519,4.648351648351649
1937407,4,6304049692,Lovely story with nice narration. Something different from the usual canned cartoon story lines. Kids really liked it. Just enough suspense without being scary.,1391299200,,160,5.708333333333333
1937408,5,6304049692,This is one of my favorite Christmas stories for children. The wonderful narration by Christopher Reeves and Amy Grant is a plus.,1390089600,,129,4.909090909090909

1937410,4,6304049692,Cute movie to watch with our young kids. Wish or was a little longer as the plots a little thin.,1389139200,,96,3.85
1937411,4,6304049692,Really enjoyed it. Kept my attention even as an adult.i'm sure young kids would love it! Not dull at all.,1388966400,,105,4.3
1937412,2,6304049692,"The story is wonderful, but I don't think I could get my young grandchildren to hold still for the story.",1388361600,,105,4.3
1937413,2,6304049692,"If you are looking for something that would impart Christianity or tell about the real meaning of Christmas, this is not the movie for you. It was a cute story all the way until the very end, and then it got pretty cheesy. We had thought maybe it would tell about baby Jesus being born, or maybe mention God, but there was nothing. It was a pretty empty story. It had a lot of build-up and suspense, cause they kept talking about some miracle that was going to happen and then when it happened, my kids started laughing cause it was just weird. oh well.",1387843200,3,553,4.276190476190476
1937414,4,6304049692,"The Lion and the Lamb is a really sweet animated children's movie. It's about 30 minutes long, so that's just the right length for a child. The story is quite peaceful and simple. I would recommend it as a little treat before bedtime or during adult oriented festivities that don't make much sense to a little one.",1387843200,,314,4.526315789473684
1937425,5,6304049692,"Just like when I was a kid! ;] Great story about love and peace and ""the magic of Christmas."" There's something holy about it. =]",1387756800,,129,4.2
1937426,5,6304049692,"The story is told in a straight-forward way, no 'kiddie dialogue'. I enjoyed it a lot; would recommend it to all audiences.",1387497600,,123,4.636363636363637
1937427,2,6304049692,"You often think that if good actors/actresses are associated with a film, there's a decent chance it will be good.  Not so.  This was a goo example of very low-budget animation, inferior graphics, and a saccharin story.  When the animals put their Christmas plug in, that was it for me.  Good thing it was only 20+ minutes long!",1387411200,,328,4.603448275862069
1937428,5,6304049692,"My kids are 18 and 14 now, and they loved this movie so much that I decided to buy it in DVD format to use in my classroom with my Kindergarteners.....and, just as I thought, they love it too.  Such a good and wholesome story.  I will be keeping it around for my grandchildren one day.",1384128000,,285,4.071428571428571
1937429,5,6304049692,A lovely story of how peace brings comfort to the hearts of those who experience it. There will be those that will watch this beautiful little story and will try to pick it apart but it is those folks that have the most difficult time finding peace.,1383523200,,249,4.319148936170213
1937430,5,6304049692,one of the most heartfelt and warming stories of the holidays...would recommend it to anyone who just needs to roll back a years and remember the innocence of a child and how great holidays were with the family,1382400000,2,210,4.552631578947368
1937431,2,6304049692,"This one I clicked on and after the first few minutes realized this is for very, very, very small children and it didn't interest me at all.",1377216000,,140,4.222222222222222
1937432,5,6304049692,Excellent telling of a Christmas tale.  A must for most Christian church libraries for the children.  Clear way to teach compassion.,1360022400,,132,5.238095238095238
1937433,5,6304049692,"This story is such a sweet change for our little ones to see. And it is nice to hear the voices of Amy Grant and Christopher Reeves, since he is now deceased. Nicely done--nothing else like it.",1357689600,,193,4.243243243243243
1937434,5,6304049692,"Our family has enjoyed watching this video since it was first released on VHS.  Such a sweet story and the narration by Amy Grant and Christopher Reeves is well done.  The narration combined with the music and animation leaves an overall sense of peace, truly.  This is in no way flashy or hyper, but rather classic and subdued; perfect for Christmas.  Today, I was looking to see if its available on DVD because the VHS machine is worn out.  Thankfully it is available on DVD at rabbitears.com!",1302480000,6,495,4.64367816091954
