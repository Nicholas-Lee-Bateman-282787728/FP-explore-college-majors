5048608,5,B0071LEOV2,"Reading some of the negative reviews here reminded me of what I thought before seeing the movie. ""A side story? What about something after the end? This is going to suck!""

Then I actually saw it.

I'm not sure what movie some of the other reviewers saw, but the one I saw was pure FMA. It doesn't really add anything to the story plot-wise (how could it?), but it does a great job of expanding the anime's world. By taking us to the never before seen land of Creta, we are treated to some of the most impressive backdrops in the whole series. The new characters are also a pleasant surprise, as their plight seems to mirror that of the Isvalans, but has some interesting depth that makes it compelling. The self-contained plot fits into the Brotherhood canon if you want it to (around episode 20-21, IIRC) but has enough twists of its own to not need outside knowledge to understand. The animation is a bit different than either anime series, but is still gorgeous.

My only complaints are that the animation of some slower scenes is occasionally choppy (the cinematic format does that to anime movies, I tend to find) and that the blood/gore is definitely higher here than in any other incarnation of FMA. I actually thought it fit in with the symbolism of the movie, but not everyone will feel that way, so consider yourself warned.

Ultimately, this movie is a way to spend two more hours with Edward and Alphonse. Treat it that way and you'll have a blast.",1330128000,78,1461,4.5437262357414445
5048609,1,B0071LEOV2,"I saw this film at the premiere in Los Angeles. I never thought I would say this, but the Conqueror of Shamballa was way better (and that is not saying much). Pointless cameos, stupid plot which doesn't fit the main FMA story and poor animation make this a pretty crappy movie. Basically some producer said, ""let's produce a low budget film loosely based on the FMA franchise and milk it for all it's worth."" I'm a huge FMA fan who buys everything FMA, but after seeing this film I want my money back.",1329955200,19,501,4.397849462365591
5048610,2,B0071LEOV2,"I was really disappointed in the movie when I saw it in theaters.  It doesn't fit into the storyline of FMA: Brotherhood at all...  In deciding to make an FMA: Brotherhood feature length movie, there was some serious potential for making a badass, excellent addition to the anime.  Instead of adding more to the FMA: Brotherhood storyline, they go completely off on a tangent for this one, with a storyline that is 100% unrelated to the anime.  I had about a million ideas of awesome things that could have been done with this movie, perhaps involving Xing and alkahestry, as those were relatively unexplored in the anime, but still had a central role in the storyline.  Any of seemingly infinite possibilities of awesomeness existed, but whoever thought this was the best route to go was defintely off their rocker.",1329955200,9,816,4.841726618705036
5048611,1,B0071LEOV2,"I recently saw this and fell asleep. I have all the FMA manga and have seen all the episodes of both series and the first movie. This movie is mainly about characters you've never heard of before and end up not caring about. Does not give additional insight to any of the regular FMA characters, some of whom barely make an appearance and might as well have been cut out altogether.",1329782400,19,382,4.394366197183099
5048612,5,B0071LEOV2,"The series cannot be compared to the movies, since both the first and Brotherhood are amazing.
I saw this movie in theaters and it, as anticipated, blew my mind. Very much more violent then the series tough, because it surprised me I suppose, it flows smoothly along it's story line.
The story is great and the new characters are fun (even tough some are terribly evil of course!).
I will buy this on DVD for sure, not just because it is from FMA, but because it is a truly good movie.",1329609600,9,485,4.34065934065934
5048613,1,B0071LEOV2,"I have to agree on one of the reviews below, this was the worst movie, it doesn't have any action on it, it just don't have anything, some people say it has to much violence, or that it is very bloody, but i was very disappointed of it",1329523200,6,235,3.9166666666666665
5048614,1,B0071LEOV2,"Personally, I saw this film in the theater, and I have *NO* intentions of buying it on DVD, even though I have pretty much every DVD that ever came out for both the original anime, the first movie and Brotherhood, not to mention the manga.  This movie was such a let-down and really did not fit in with any of the series.  It was hardly about Ed & Al at all, and Mustang and his group were almost not in it.  It could have been an episode of any anime, because it really was FMA in name only.  I can't believe I was actually longing for humunculi, or *anything* to make it feel more like FMA to me.  Amazingly bloody, ridiculously convoluted plotline, original characters that kept popping out of the woodworks that I couldn't have cared less about.  As far as I'm concerned, I'm going to pretend this movie never happened!",1329523200,26,823,4.381578947368421
5048615,5,B0071LEOV2,"Apparently equivalent exchange for this film is just admission price at a local theater or waiting until April and paying the twenty-some dollars for the Blu-ray.

I personally am going to do both. I had the chance to see this at my local theater, a treat since they usually don't get such obscure titles and I'm usually forced to resort to waiting on blu-ray releases. This time I was able to see the beautifully hand drawn animation up on the big screen in all its glory. I will say upfront I can't wait to see it again but this time on Blu-ray and I hope they include some special features (*hooray for a US cast commentary being listed).

I am a relatively new fan of the series but have been well exposed to the mythos by now. This film, unlike the film tied to the earlier series (Conqueror of Shamballa), is not an ending/finale as much as it is a filler episode that fits into the Brotherhood series. In those terms I'd call it a great filler episode though. I suggest viewing this film as another chance to spend time with the Elric brothers, though perhaps this time on an ever slightly more different journey. I feel viewing it this way, which is how I went into it, will merit the most enjoyment. In short, this film had everything I wanted, some mythic intrigue, epic battles, epic alchemy (something Conqueror of Shamballa was light on), unique environments, character moments, some dark turns and some well dispersed humor. Could it have been many other things, yes, but I personally really enjoyed what it was.

I don't think anything needs to be said about the voice acting, this dub is terrific, truly one of the best. I know some fans only watch the subs but this is well known as one of those anime that almost every fan finds the English dub to be on par or in some cases above the original one. I will say, as I have in regards to Brotherhood, I miss Aaron Dismuke as Al but puberty happens and Maxey Whitehead does an excellent job in the role once you get used to the higher pitch.

The visuals were fantastic and the action was excellently staged. The only downside is that Ed and Al seem to play side characters in this film, whereas in comparison to Conqueror of Shamballa they were definitely main characters there. While I would have liked more of them and more stakes for them in the story that didn't stop me from greatly enjoying the film as an anime fan. The story keeps one eager to see what will happen and where things will go, even though a few too many scenes without any presence felt by Ed or Al left me wondering when they would return to the screen.

To be clear, it isn't that I didn't enjoy the side characters, just that Ed and Al were always on my mind when gone too long as this is a Fullmetal Alchemist film. The side characters are interesting and well designed, there is a large back story about two warring territories and another caught between them in a canyon. Then there is a smaller back story about a brother and sister who, like Ed and Al, lost their parents. The large amount of plot is well explained without getting too expository, for the most part, several flashback sequences definitely help. The film starts out very linear, light and fun but soon gets very dark and heavy as it begins to pile on the plot twists towards the end, back-to-back-to-back at one point.

On another note, if this film didn't carry the title Fullmetal Alchemist or if Ed and Al hadn't been in the story I would have felt like I was watching an older Hayao Miyazaki film, which I obviously say as a compliment. Even the character designs reminded me very much of Nausicaa or other similar films.

So while I do wish Ed and Al were more involved both physically and emotionally, they mostly stand on the sidelines and give their opinions to these new characters who may make the same mistakes the boys once did (at least during most of the second act), it is nevertheless a good if not great film. It is especially engaging for those who love hand drawn animation as much as I do or for those who can't get enough Fullmetal Alchemist, which I unfortunately can't. Hopefully another film or feature will be made. 4 stars in an objective sense as I wish the Elric's had been more involved and thought the middle of the story could have been more well paced, 5 stars for me on an enjoyment level and for the beautiful visuals and action scenes. Next up on the silver screen I look forward to Arrietty.

**Apparently many fans haven't enjoyed the film based on other reviews now posted. I still have to give it five stars as an anime film and 4 as FMA.",1327449600,75,4588,4.440617577197149

5048639,4,B0071LEOV2,"Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos is an all-around well-made, entertaining, and enjoyable movie. While to understand the world and some of the characters you do need to draw on some basic knowledge of the manga or Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, its best to just enjoy this as a story in itself, because it naturally has very little to do with the progression of a plot that is already complete.

The culture we are introduced to in this film is fully developed and you could easily believe it has as many levels of history and mythology as the other cultures in the FA world, if not more. There are also some new alchemy elements, as well as some different kinds of villains. The storyline was fairly creative, but just reminiscent enough of the subplots in the other series that it fit in pretty naturally. Actually, I felt that this was kind of a long, missing episode, a shorter version of which would have fit in nicely among the 2003 animes early episodes.

Is there anything particularly thought provoking in this movie? Not really. Its basically just an enjoyable fantasy tale. But I thought it was more humorous than Brotherhood; there were lots of ordinary funny moments near the beginning that aren't especially in keeping with the odd humor of the manga (or even with that of Brotherhood), but had me laughing like any normal comedy you might see in all kinds of movies.

There isn't really any character development for the returning characters, but that is already accomplished in the series. Ed and Al are more like travelers who end up helping the people they meet in a certain city, much as they do in some of the stories at the beginning of the manga and the first anime series. Theres very little you can criticize about them unless it is their appearance, and even then my complaints were only with Ed and Al. They just look plain weird, like they were drawn with a crayon and then filled in with paint, which isn't always the right color. Als eyes blink and move around a little too much in the beginning. Edwards facial expressions are not always quite right, and his eyes are yellow and green, which looks odd.

Another qualm had was the way Colonel Mustang just kind of stood around during the final climax, when there was lava flying everywhere and Edward, Alphonse, and another of the characters were all fighting to contain it. Colonel Mustang is the Flame Alchemist after all, and there must have been something he could have done to help. To be honest, aside from Edward and Al, none of the other original characters actually do anything of significance besides making a token appearance. I found this forgivable, though, because other than Colonel Mustang at the end, they merely behaved just as they would under their circumstances and it seemed more realistic than if they were dragged further into the events, which might have resulted in plot inconsistencies.

The new characters are very three-dimensional and believable, and none of them were annoying. If you're like me, you may have been worried that the main female protagonist, Julia, would be some kind of reincarnation of Rose, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that she was a complex, formidable, and original character.

I wasn't impressed with the animation in Brotherhood, so my expectations for this films art were low to begin with. What with that and the fact that there weren't any corresponding images in the manga to compare it to, I found the animation in this movie to be mostly good as far as the scenery and the new characters. In fact, the way all of the characters moved and carried themselves was probably the best in any animated movie or show Ive ever seen.

There were some real cool freeze-frames in the midst of the action at the end of the movie, in which the art was stripped down to a more basic, less shiny form. Not sure if that was compensation or creativity, but I rather liked it.

The music is lovely and sometimes Celtic in style, and it really helps you get a feel for the new culture. I was not especially impressed with the music in Brotherhood, and hearing the beautiful and versatile themes of this score was really enjoyable.

This movie may be the least of the FA anime, but its really enjoyable as a movie in itself, and in my opinion its a solid 4/5 star anime.",1437436800,,4313,4.67193675889328

I don't want to spoil the story, but the main theme of this movie is kinda old for FMA fan. and length of movie is reasonable but little short. for story wide, I think it's about right length, but they can put some more detail.

5048685,4,B0071LEOV2,"My score is 3.5 out of 5.  I suggest streaming or renting it to see if you want to buy it.

It's almost as if the creators were trying to represent all the diverse elements of the original FMA cast in this new roster of characters.  We have the oppressed valley people, a squadron of gliding bat-winged normals, chimera soldiers, and a skin-switching alchemist.  Even though there are SO MANY new characters in this movie, nothing comes off as especially new or strange.  Even Milosian/Cretan (sp?) alchemy, which seems to come from underground magma movements, fits right in with the rest of the canon.

It's the execution that really decreases the quality of the movie.  When the action starts to take off, we're introduced to no less than three separate enemy factions all at once, and it takes a long time for the movie to finally explain who everyone in the first fight scene was.  There was just too much to cram into two hours.  The frustrating part is, there were some things that could have obviously been cut.  Since they had the Sanguine Star, there was no need to put magma into the equation beyond just mentioning that it is a normal part of their alchemy.  They obviously aren't using it as a power source; that's what they have the stones for.

The Table City government and their local Yoki-clone just seemed unnecessary, even though at least part of the story could not have happened without them.  The excuse they came up with to put Winry in the movie was actually hilarious: ""Ed told me his right arm was feeling numb.""  Think about that for a second.

A lot of people don't buy this idea of eating the Philosopher's Stone to gain power.  I didn't see any real 'transformation' happen; I just assumed that they gained the power not just by eating it, but activating it once it was inside them.  (This might have been a method specific to Milosian/Cretan alchemy.)  The wild-hair and glowing eyes were either part of the alchemic reaction, or an artistic reminder of what was happening.

There will be some spoilers as I examine this idea of eating the stone in the context of the series.

When Edward warns them that eating it will 'consume their soul'...doesn't he have a point?  Both Wrath and Greed were created by a Philosopher's Stone taking over a human being (even though it was injected, not eaten).  It's possible that merely eating the stone like Kimblee does all the time doesn't do anything, and that the alchemist has to activate it while it's in their stomach to achieve the same effects as the movie characters do.

In fact, this would idea would neatly fit in with Kimblee's role in the anime.  Kimblee is somewhat of a transhumanist, who wants to see whether homunculi or humans will survive.  This would explain WHY he keeps a stone inside his body; not only does it make him feel like a homunculi, but if the homunculi win at some point, he could activate it from inside his stomach and attempt to become a homunculi himself.

That's it for the anime spoilers.

It would probably have been better if they released this movie during the middle of the anime, so it wouldn't seem out of place.  FMA fans like me will probably roll their eyes at past Ed and Al when they talk about things that the end of the anime changes.  While some people will see the 'recycled' characters as a problem, I feel that it was a neat way to integrate a new cast and pay tribute to the original series at the same time.  While 'Sacred Star of Milos' tries to fit too much into a single movie, it's also an enjoyable, if not rushed, look at a the characterization and plot elements that made the series great.",1374969600,,3626,4.550925925925926

Mustang and Hawkeye are in a movie, but they only play a small role. So you'll be a little disappointed when you don't see Mustang snap those magic fingers. I'm not a die hard FMA fan, but I love  watching the anime. Just like the series, it's violent and really bloody at certain parts. Yet I have to say, I thought the movie was excellent! I believe it deserves 5 stars, due to it's perfect flow of action pack animation (you don't see that very often in anime movies). You'll see action from the begging until the end.

The change in graphics definitely made it harder to get in to.,1353801600,2,420,4.6891891891891895
5048714,5,B0071LEOV2,"When the hit anime TV series ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" was coming to a close, BONES wanted to make sure the adventures of the Elrich brothers, despite their adventure ending in the series, would still continue in the movies.

Set during a time when both brothers were still looking for the Philosopher stone, this is where director Kazuya Murata (""Eureka Seven"", ""Figure 17, ""Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion"") and screenwriter Yuichi Shinbo (""Doraemon"" films) would base the story for ""Hagane no Renkinjutsushi: Mirosu no Sei-naru Hoshi"" (""Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos"").  The film would also feature music from rock band L'Arc~en~Ciel and the artist Miwa.

The film was announced during the final episode of ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" and premiered in Japan in July 2011 and screened in U.S. theaters in 2012.

For those not familiar with ""Fullmetal Alchemist"", in Japan, ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" (Hagane no Renkinjutushi) is a popular long running anime and manga series created by mangaka Hiromu Arakawa.  The original manga series was serialized in Square Enix's ""Shonen Gangan"" since 2001, while the 51-episode TV series created by BONES was shown on television in 2004 followed by a manga faithful anime adaptation with ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" airing in 2009-2010.

The popularity of ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" has led to many novels, OVA's, drama CD's, soundtracks and video games and a lot of these releases have been distributed in various countries and its popularity is a testament of how people have come to love the series which has won many awards in Japan including being voted for the #1 most popular anime series of all time.

VIDEO:

One thing I love about anime films on Blu-ray is the fact that you know that unlike TV series, studios tend to have a higher budget, more staff and more time is dedicated in the look and feel for an anime film.  ""Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos - The Motion Picture"" is a big example of how the film looks fantastic thanks to its beautifully painted art backgrounds, it's 3D use for vehicles and weaponry and more.

Presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1), one of the biggest differences that this film would have versus the TV series and previous film is the character design.  The character designs have a bit of a different style when compared to the TV series and I think that was part of the reason of the difference is to show that this is not a film derived from Hiromu Arakawa's manga but is its own storyline featuring the Elric brothers.  The art backgrounds are just heavily detailed and are beautiful too look at.  In fact, the Blu-ray really showcases the detail of the CG work and the art.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

Another reason why I love anime films on Blu-ray is that you also tend to get a Japanese soundtrack in the same lossless soundtrack as the English dub.  So, both are in Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  I did notice that the English version had a bit more of a dynamic range but yet both are wonderful when it came to using the surround channels during the many action sequences during the film.  Also, noticed the use of surround for ambiance as well.  And for those with a subwoofer, yes,  awesome use of LFE during the action sequences as well.

I watched the film in both Japanese and English dub and fans should feel great that both are done very well. In fact, as much as I enjoy watching ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" in Japanese, I will have to say that FUNimation Entertainment has always done a marvelous job when it came to the voice acting of this series.  Vic Mignogna and Maxey Whitehead have literally nailed the voice of the Elric brothers and from the TV series to the film (as well as the other voice talents), I have always been impressed by the English dubwork, as well as the Japanese voice acting, so I had to watch the film in both soundtracks.  Both are fantastic!

English subtitles were also easy to read.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When it was announced that ""Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos - The Motion Picture"" was being made, I was quite happy.  Mainly because it gave fans a chance to enjoy the Elric Brothers and the characters once again.

With the manga series completed and the TV series also finished, despite the characters and the series being so immensely popular, it was not a long running storyline like ""Dragon Ball Z"", ""Bleach"" or ""Naruto"", nor was there a film being created every summer.

And that is probably a good thing as non-canon films that are derived from anime series are usually not that good, but in the case of ""Fullmetal Alchemist"", the last film ""Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa"" was enjoyable but after watching ""Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos - The Motion Picture"", I had a smile on my face at the very end because in my eye, I felt that this film was excellent.

While it did focus more on the Elric brothers and we didn't see much action coming from Roy or Riza, they do make an appearance as with other popular characters such as Winry and Armstrong but the newer characters and the storyline created was so enjoyable and fascinating, and also a bit violent and kind of dark.

I loved how the film showcased both Amestris and Creta and seeing the people in Table City living in conflict and fear.  This really made the viewer enjoy these newer characters such as Julia Crichton and her friends.  And there are quite a bit of twist and turns, especially when transmutation starts to come into play...you know things are going to get crazy and by the end of the film, you're left satisfied with how the story ends and how things end up for these characters.

As a film, it was enjoyable but I don't know if I can see ""Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos - The Motion Picture"" as a final film, because just from this film alone, it does show that there are always potential to further explore adventures of the Elric Brothers.  But with that being said, I'm sure fans would even love it even more if a future film featured the involvement of creator Hiromu Arakawa.

But whether or not this film will be the last for ""Fullmetal Alchemist"", based on the film alone, I enjoyed it more than the first and I really the storytelling and the characters, especially the beautifully painted art backgrounds.  Especially the stylistic choice for the film's character design which is slightly different from the TV series.

As for the Blu-ray release, video and audio quality were great, but the making of was wonderful and for English dub fans, they will really enjoy listening to the audio commentary, especially coming from Vic Micnogna.  But you do get a good amount of special features with this release.

For those wondering if they can enjoy this film without knowing a thing about ""Fullmetal Alchemist"", I think they can enjoy the film as things are explained for viewers.  But I can only hope that if one watches the film, I hope they enjoyed it enough to watch the TV series in order for things to make more sense.

For parents, this is not for young children.  There are some major sacrificing done (ie. blood sacrifice), so there is quite a bit of violence and blood, so definitely not to be watched with younger children in the room.

Overall, ""Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos - The Motion Picture"" is a wonderful film with a captivating storyline, cool new characters, plenty of action and more.  The Blu-ray also looks and sounds great and you get a good amount of special features as well.  If you want an awesome anime film on Blu-ray, ""Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos - The Motion Picture"" is highly recommended!",1352332800,,9036,4.858915741345526
5048715,5,B0071LEOV2,It was a god movie. Was a little confused on when it took place in the series but other than that it was really good.,1352246400,,117,3.72
5048716,3,B0071LEOV2,"This is a standalone movie that takes place sometime during the Brotherhood series. I really wanted to like this movie but it's just average at best and this is coming from someone whose watched every FMA release. A lot of people are complaining about the animation quality not being up to Brotherhood standards, while that's true I didn't find it that much of a drop off. The biggest problem with the movie was the plot.

The plot is about the Milos people who need to reclaim their holy land and become a sovereign nation (basically think of Tibet and Palestine). The outline of the plot I felt was solid and had some potential but by the end there was way too many things going on and even in the end motivations of certain characters weren't really explained or how some things happened were left unanswered. Can't really go into detail since I don't want to spoil anything but I felt the last battle scene was confusing as I didn't understand the goal and I also didn't get the result as I thought they needed the Philosopher's Stone to accomplish it, I guess not though. There are a few big twists within the movie as well. I suppose that will appeal to some people but it really make the movie more nonsensical for me.

Another thing that bothered me was Mustang, Hawkeye and Winry, not that they were in the movie, but they don't have a big part in the movie and their addition seems forced just so Ed and Al aren't the only characters from the series in the movie.

Overall I'd say if you are a fan of FMA it is worth seeing as it is entertaining at times and who knows how much more FMA material will be released in the future. But if you can I'd recommend renting it or borrowing it from someone.",1351987200,2,1707,4.378548895899054
5048717,4,B0071LEOV2,The movie was done great and I loved that they kept the voice actors the same.  The only dislike is how they drew some of the characters.,1351468800,,137,4.074074074074074
5048718,5,B0071LEOV2,"The search for a fugitive alchemist leads the Elric brothers to a valley of slums inhabited by the people of Milos. These people are being exploited by bureaucrats. Ed and Al are caught in the middle of a rebellion lead by the young Alchemist, Julia. She will stop at nothing to get her people to their rightful place.

This movie is great. We get introduced to a lot of cool new characters. This movie doesn't continue the FMA story, it's easier to think of it as a several episode addition to the main story. Sort of a story arc if you want to think of it that way. Either way it's fantastic. I still don't think we've seen the end of Full Metal Alchemist yet. Hooray!",1350864000,,670,4.317460317460317
5048719,3,B0071LEOV2,"So, you haven't seen any new Fullmetal Alchemist stories in a while and you see this is in the store and you go ""Oh, cool!""  Well, no.  I advise skipping this one.

The story takes place some unknown time during the series.  Homonculi never enter into the plot.  The city of Milos is on the border of Amestris and Creta to the west, and is currently occupied by Amestris.  A faction of Milosians want Milos to be its own country.

An early scene in the movie is a good metaphor for the awkward, misfit nature of the film.  Ed and Al Elric are on a CGI train to Milos.  The CGI and cell animation almost, but not quite, blend, in much the same way this movie almost, but not quite, blends with the series.  The scene involves Ed and Al, the Amestrian military, a wolf-chimera, a rogue black-haired male alchemist, a young red-haired female alchemist, and a squad of bat-winged ""terrorists"" all interacting and you have no clue who's doing what to whom and why.

The twisty turny ending doesn't work well.  ""This is what's really going on.""  ""No, not that, actually, THIS is what's really going on.""  ""No, on second thought, THIS is what's really going on.""  It takes a lot of talent to make an ending like that work, and they don't quite have it.

The animation quality is variable: sometimes good, sometimes not so good.  The English voice acting is reasonably well done.  Ed and Al are the actors from the series.  Mustang and others are as well, but they're only in here for cameos.

This movie does NOT serve as an introduction to the world of FMA for newcomers.  Let me say again: do NOT start with this one.

5048721,5,B0071LEOV2,"I was fortunate enough to see this movie on the big screen in the short week it was available along with my sister (who is also a fan) and my father (who had no idea what it was about at all). When I first saw the other reviews I was a bit shocked at the negativity; while the art is a bit lack-luster (ok, I'll admit my sister and I laughed about how bad it was through most of the movie) and it doesn't really add anything or follow the original storyline consistently (quite a few inconsistencies actually) it was a brilliant movie. It wasn't really supposed to add anything to the original storyline anyway so that's not anything I was worried about. I was pleasantly surprised with how well I liked the new characters (I won't give anything away for those who haven't seen it) and the amount of blood was definitely much higher than normal (which my father wasn't too happy about ^^') but it was still wonderful. I definitely plan on buying this (I'm super-excited for the US cast commentaries!) and I would recommend it to any Fullmetal fan.",1348617600,,1047,4.458333333333333
5048722,3,B0071LEOV2,"Before i get into my review of the movie i want to let everyone now what a huge Full Metal Alchemist fan o i am. To me both the original and brotherhood and of course the manga are such great pieces of fiction. So this movie had some pretty high expectations coming from me.

I heard about the movie ""the sacred star of Milo's"" coming t the U.S in theaters last year and being the avid Full Metal fan i wanted to see it (i believe i was in the middle of watching the original series). Unfortunately it wasn't playing anywhere near me so i had to wait until it came out on DVD and now obviously iv'e seen it. So here it goes.

Plot: The plot of this movie revolves around a teenage girl named Julia who wishes to bring a race called the Milocian people back to grace/ power by using a philosopher stone. She meets ed and Al who decide to help her and of course learn more secrets along the way.

Review of the plot: I was worried that this movie was going to be a big shot clich shonen filler movie along the caliber of the Naruto and Bleach series. I can honestly say i was mostly right for the most part. this movie lacks the intelligent philosophical and raw emotional plot both Full metal series had. There were some good plot ideas don't get me wrong i found the story of of Milocian people interesting and other things but overall i didn't think it was to brilliant. The beginning of the movie wasn't done well and i only really got int it towards the end.

Characters: This movie as any filler movie does weaves the main characters from the series: Ed, Al ( of course), Mustang, Hawkeye Winry, and a little of Armstrong and Roy's men Breda and Falman ( they make very brief appearances ) with new ones.

Review of the characters:

Edward: I am ashamed to say this but i didn't particularly love ed in this movie and he's my favorite fictional character of all time probably! He felt way to generic in my opinion mostly with his dialogue . I still love the short (yes i just called him short! ) alchemist but i wasn't to fond of him in this movie, perhaps at the end was when he actually felt like the ed we know and love.

Alphonse: Al was pretty much the same as he's always been a happy go lucky boy trapped in a suit of armor. He felt like the same character.

Mustang, Hawkeye and Winry:were in it so briefly i really couldn't even tell1 such great characters serve little to no purpose in the plot of this movie. They don't even have the lovable. humor vibe between Mustang and Hawkeye that they usually do. As for Winry i don't get why they included her don't get me wrong i love her but she goes to a battle field and why would a character that doesn't fight be needed there? ( except to help ed of course). the others really are not worth mentioning because they have like 4 to 5 lines.

Julia: Our main star and biggest non cannon leading lady. probably my favorite part of this movie. She, like most of the women of full metal ( except Rose) has a strong personality and is very confident. I believe she almost could have been made my Arakawa herself.

Ashleigh: Julia's older brother ( why does he have a girls name?). I can't say much without spoiling but he was pretty interesting.

General Hershel: Reminded me so much of Yoki from the series. everything from his looks, to his personality even his voice. Not a very creative villain.

Miranda: I don't remember her name but she was an alright character. Not exactly good or bad.

Animation: The worst thing about this movie. It was poorly done and isn't Bone's usual breathtaking work. Maybe this movie was low budget. I think Edward suffered the most, his hair looked completely wrong and yellow not blonde.

Music: I loved the OST soundtrack to this movie it fit the moos usually. The opening and ending were great ( even though the opening was played so shortly i don't really remember it). I love the song ""Good lucky my way"" by Le arc en ciel. There back in the full metal series and i love it!

Overall: Sorry i know this has been a pretty long review but as a huge fan f the series i felt like letting everything i thought about the movie out. SO basically should you see this?: Yes i guess i would. It was entertaining and had some good parts to it. I'm just saying don't be surprised if you find yourself disappointed. People compare this to Conqueror of Shamballa and i think that's so unfair. C.O.S was meant to finish the original series off in a two hour movie tying up all loose ends. This movie though with the Brotherhood series is so unimportant to the series it's not even funny. I was told to wait until episode 20 to see this and don't get why. they don't even show Brotherhood only characters like Ling and Lan Fan or Oliver ( would have been a nice touch). Basically if you know the basic plot of full metal you can watch this. So i suppose watch it for fun one night and enjoy.",1346803200,,4871,4.296619411123228
5048723,5,B0071LEOV2,"when i first saw this movie i dint quite fully understand it but once you reach the end and you realize the plot twist you see it with different eyes because you realize whats going on towards the end of it and its just a great movie over all and it has the entire movie on commentary by the U.S. dub actors and its absolutely great specially towards the end when the actor the voice of ED speaks of how this series has affected his and fans life's and its truly moving.

there is also ""the making of the movie"" which is the creators of the series which is Japanese creators with English sub which is good but I'm not really one to be reading the entire time because they speak fast so you have to read the subbing quite fast which is a hastle but you do learn a lot from there cometary.

oh and by the way this movie has a great plot twist which i did not see coming also the characters do look a bit different but in a good way its a bit refreshing the big difference i noted is the characters eyes

ONE last thing which is very important if you have not seen the entire series yet in the commentary there are spoilers but not something that will ruin the ending for you just somethings that you would rather not know if you have finished watching the series.

if your a true fan of FMAB this is a great addition and i would say a must buy.

5048724,2,B0071LEOV2,"Ugh. It's the story of new characters (so predictable they seem recycled) and a new place that has no particular plot for Ed & Al other than as support. Their part in the story adds zip to what we know about them. Ed spends way too much time running around yelling ""dammit!"" and not quite doing anything he's trying to accomplish, and Al lumbers around being Al. I think we're just supposed to be grateful to see them again - and I wanted to be, but wow - what a wasted opportunity.
The story about the new characters is stock stuff; misunderstood underdogs with unswerving courage fight against all odds to rise above ridiculously unfair conditions. You're supposed to first believe they are criminals, then be slowly swayed until you're on their side. Problem is, the story and the new characters never really engaged me; so I kept looking to the FMA people to do something of interest, making it painfully obvious that their roles were uninspired and unusually one-dimensional.
Pretty unsatisfying if you're looking to jump back in to that connection with the regulars in the series. As others mentioned, Mustang, Hawkeye, Armstrong etc. all just show up as familiar landmarks and behave predictably, and you'd still have virtually the same story of you edited them all out. Even Ed and Al almost feel replaceable.
I've purchased or been gifted every other DVD set, the entire manga set, calendars, you name it for this series but I won't be buying this. Maybe it was because my expectations were too high, but this flat, flaccid piece of work was barely worth the minutes invested in watching it.",1346284800,16,1600,4.7797833935018055
5048725,4,B0071LEOV2,"Fullmetal Alchemist- The Sacred Star of Milos was kinda of uneven throughout its run and it truly did not start to get really interesting until the one hour mark BUT it does have its moments of greatness when voice acting,fluid animation and music all come together flawlessly to create quite a few very memorable scenes that will stay embedded in your mind for sometime. The most noteworthy vocal performances that stood out in the English dub are from Matthew Mercer,Vic Mignogna,Alexis Tipton and Patrick Seitz..all of them were excellent but particularly Matthew Mercer who truly shined in the last part of the film. I enjoyed the film for what it is a side story film to an already accomplished and finished franchise..it was a little to long but well worth my time in the end..highly recommend.",1344988800,,800,4.889705882352941
5048726,4,B0071LEOV2,"I've been loving FMA since the Classic series was still in its first run on Adult Swim. Loved the original series, grew to love Conqueror of Shamballa after watching it several times. Less fond of the manga and Brotherhood but still bought every volume of both and own all the OVA's, all the Light Novels by M. Inoue and even the Japanese imports of the live FMA Festivals with the voice actors performing for huge audiences. I had a lot of high hopes for Star of Milos before I saw it in Japanese without subtitles. After seeing it I decided that it was, at heart, an extended episode. If you watch the film with no expectations of being overwhelmed or blown out of the water by a masterful work, you'll enjoy it.

No point rehashing the plot like other reviewers--but here are the points I wanted to address:
GOOD POINTS: The viewer gets to explore a whole part of the FMA universe we have not seen in the series,the manga, the books, the games, or the novels. The FMA 'verse has expanded a little and I love that. Creta is allegedly inspired by India and the architecture is similar to the Dravidian temples Table City--what an uninspiring name!--was designed upon. The new characters fit well into the FMA 'verse--Julia does not have the fatal flaws Arakawa gave to Winry and Riza (building her inner world around a man)--she is quite a strong young lady. And  the Milosians are painted as another Repressed Minority like the Ishvallans,but it is Creta, not Amestris, doing the oppressing. The fight scenes are well done, and while I am not mad about the character designs they could have been far worse. And, thankfully, the score and theme songs are MUCH better than the dreadful soundtrack to Brotherhood. L'arc en Ciel is back!
Interestingly, Ed and Al are not the real focus of this story--Julia is...and it works. Alphonse gets to be The Hero this time and while Maxey Whitehead has always been, in my opinion, badly miscast as Alphonse (especially the older Alphonse in Brotherhood)Al is always wonderful to watch. And when Julia abuses the 'Star"" stone, she does not get away without paying the price. The dynamic between Julia and her brother definitely parallels that of Ed and Al--nicely done. And the backgrounds and animation are quite impressive.

The down sides? There is more BLOOD in this movie than in both series combined. Wholesale slaughter is pretty graphic for FMA in this film. Rivers of gore-which seems pretty gratuitous. The Black Bat takes steampunk to levels that don't quite fit--Amestris doesn't have airplanes and doesn't really use airships--but we have flying terrorists? The standard FMA characters are not used well--Roy has little screen time and is essentially useless. Hawkeye is there really for a brief action moment. Winry's appearance in the film is complete and utter fanservice--why in the hell would Roy bring her along on a military expedition where there are known terrorist threats for minor repairs to his arm? She's in the film as fluffy window dressing. She serves no purpose, does not propel the plot and is more annoying than usual.

This movie is best viewed as a 'special' episode rather than as a strong feature. On that basis, it's enjoyable. Lower your expectations and enjoy it for what it is...although it really wasn't a strong enough finale to the franchise. Personally, I think the OVA ""Yet Another Man's Battlefield"" about Roy and Maes as cadets and young officers during the Ishvallan war could have made a deeply moving and powerful final film for the series.",1344124800,,3530,4.829752066115702
5048727,5,B0071LEOV2,it was a great movie that got me sucked in right away! im a long time full metal alchemist fan and it wouldnt have been hard to follow along the story if i wasnt. it wasn't long enough even though it was 110 min! i would suggest this as a gift for any fan or a great movie to add to any anime collection!,1342656000,,304,3.765625
5048728,1,B0071LEOV2,"I had higher expectations for this movie.

The Conqueror of Shamballa wasn't a masterpiece by any means, but it did have a certain allure of a well-polished production that one might attribute to a studio such as bones. The visuals and art were up to par from what you would expect in a standalone FMA movie. Sadly, this is not the case for The Sacred Star of Milos.

Not only are the characters drawn inconsistently throughout the movie, the animation leads one to believe that everyone is just constantly melting for no reason (jittery animation and drawing). Some scenes look like they were severely upscaled, with the outlines thick enough to be considered a Lichtenstein painting. The background art, while not great, was the portion of the film that didn't completely let me down (the obtrusive CG is another story though).

The story and plot are just average, typical of a big franchise movie. To me, it didn't bother me as much that it didn't have much to do with any previous story arcs more than it did the terrible production. I seriously don't know how this got out the door of bones, and it makes me seriously question if they're starting to lose their (once venerable) edge.",1342051200,6,1189,4.706730769230769
5048729,5,B0071LEOV2,Good stuff. If you're a FMA fan you'll appreciate this. The Movie art is a little odd from what I've observed in the previous series/movies but I could quickly disregard it since it is FMA.,1339545600,,189,4.428571428571429
5048730,1,B0071LEOV2,"There are some great action scenes, but the story is jumbled and the artwork is shockingly poor. What's most unforgivable is that the faces of Ed, Al, Mustang, Hawkeye, etc. are not only drawn different, they're rougher and uglier. The backgrounds feature some beautiful artwork, but the human faces and forms are terrible, a real step back from FMAB. You will not enjoy this addition to the franchise if you loved the artwork of the manga, FMA and FMAB. What were they thinking! Watch it and weigh in for yourself. But this is not a movie I'll be treasuring, and I'll pretend it never existed. Shamballa was really beautifully drawn in comparison (remember the Victorian Ed?).",1338854400,8,677,4.844827586206897
5048731,5,B0071LEOV2,"I had waited so long to get this movie after missing the chance to see it in theaters but i am so glad I did. It was a nice little tale of the Elric brothers which if you hadn't seen brotherhood or even the original full metal you'll still enjoy. I had watched this with a friend of mine whose never seen full metal alchemist but she loved it. A lot action in the movie , solid plot line , great music and lovely voice acting. Plus the artwork was beautiful kind of studio Ghibli like. I'd recommend this to any full metal fan.",1338422400,,527,4.076923076923077
5048732,5,B0071LEOV2,"As a person that knows close to little about the full metal alchemist series, this movie blown my expectations out of the window. You would think that you would need to be a hardcore FMA fan to understand whats going on but that not the case. The movie simply creates a world on its own and lets the FMA universe invade. Also I felt that the director had an excellent feeling of how to balance plot, background, and action all at the same time. I've never felt that there was to much fighting or too much talking which is a good thing. By the End of the movie, there was a sense of completeness because everything made sense between all the events happening in the story which is one of the core factors that most directors have yet to master. And of course the animation and drawings are top of the line and enjoyable to watch. I really don't know why people rate this movie so low, if your planning on watching this movie stop seeing it as part of the FMA universe and enjoy it as a movie on its own, not only that its more enjoyable but you will start seeing how much of a masterpiece it is.

5048733,5,B0071LEOV2,"This movie steps back to the middle of the Fullmetal Alchemist series, When the main characters were still searching for the Philospher's Stone, and gives a middle story that doesn't require you to have memorized the series.

5048734,4,B0071LEOV2,"Yet another awesome addition to the FMA story. I won't tell you the storyline or give anything away, but anyone who enjoys the manga or anime will also love this movie. I gave it 4 stars due to the fact i thought it lacked the normal amount of action previously seen in the manga/anime. :)",1337385600,,289,4.2727272727272725
5048735,3,B0071LEOV2,"I love Fullmetal Alchemist.  This, however, I did not.  The art was sketchy (nothing like the lovely art in the brotherhood anime), but I could have lived with that (sketchy art happens sometimes when they make Anime movies).  What I couldn't live with were all the inconsistencies.

There may be 'spoilers' in my following reasons, I tried to keep it general so you wouldn't guess all the happenings, but I don't know if I succeeded.  So read at your own risk.  (Spoilers for either the movie or for the Brotherhood Anime).

For instance: Philosophers Stone: apparently swallowing it causes you to ""lose your soul"" and get glowing eyes and crazy hair, and yet, in Brotherhood, Kimbley is constantly swallowing his rock and there are no outward signs of change, the only difference is in his alchemy. (Plus you don't NEED to swallow the stone to use it)
Second: Gate of Truth, they kept on talking about how he wants the philosopher's stone to open the Gate of Truth.  Umm... You don't need to have the stone to do that (Ed and Al, Izumi, Hoenheim, and even Roy all access the Gate of Truth without the stone, in fact, the homunculi need people who've already opened their Gate to create their country-wide stone)
Third: Automail - a character loses their leg, and two minutes later they're walking around with crutches and an automail leg.  Um what?  Surgery talks longer than that, not to mention the person in question would be laid up in bed for a while after surgery.  Automail takes years to adjust to!  Ed was unusual and he did it in a year.

So yeah, all the little inconsistencies drove me insane, along with silly little add-ins that really weren't needed for either the movie or for the Fullmetal plotline.

So in all, something I'd rent, but not buy.",1336953600,16,1763,4.645161290322581

If I recall right at the end of the series they go off to both the eastern country and the western country for the first time, yet in this movie they are in the western country of Creta and it is set within the second series.  This kind of sets up a paradox if I'm not mistaken which is one of the reasons for my lower review the other being the new art direction.  Don't get me wrong by the end of the film it was an ok look it just took me a bit to get use to after I had been use to the animation in the series.  To sum up if you like the series you should like this film there may just be a few things that may irritate you however.",1336694400,2,877,3.9545454545454546
5048738,3,B0071LEOV2,"I went to see this movie when it was showing in theaters, and I honestly expected it to be pretty bad considering the art style was so crazy(that was a dumb assumption I know). Anyway, after about 30 minutes into the movie, I thought 2 things:
1. The characters were way out of character from what they were in Brotherhood.
2. The new setting was pretty awesome

I think the biggest problem with me enjoying the movie, was how unlike brotherhood it was. If the movie didn't have Brotherhood in the title, I would've been much more lenient, but that's not the case. Characters such as Ed totally change character, and in his case becomes much more reminiscent of a shounen protagonist than an athiest who isn't exactly the most social. I'm not going to nitpick every scene, but the BIGGEST thing that is totally unforgivable, is how he greeted Colonel Mustang in the beginning of the movie. In the show (and manga), Edward ALWAYS shrugs or grunts when he sees the colonel; in the movie, he LEANS out of a car window to happily wave to the colonel. I just sat in the theater thinking...wtf did they do to Ed's character? The other characters are a bit out of line too, but Alphonse seems to be pretty spot on, luckily.

The next thing that made it so different from Brotherhood was its use of alchemy and the physics of the world. The original Fullmetal Alchemist anime went wild with alchemy and it was more like magic than anything else. That's ok, it's fiction, they can do whatever they want as long as it's enjoyable. Brotherhood, however, is based off the manga which is very strict with the laws of alchemy and what can and can't be done. I don't want to get too into it to avoid spoilers, but a decent amount of the alchemy used is breaking the laws. I know what you're saying, ""Come on! It's a fictional movie, stop nitpicking!"", but the show it's based off of is very strict with how alchemy is used; everything that they do is explained thoroughly. A character who eats a philosopher's stone shoots lightning out everywhere, and I don't even know where to start with that! Characters also perform rather shounen-like fighting with Ed jumping 30 feet in the air from a moving train onto a pillar and back on the train. This ain't no Naruto, this be FMAB bro...

If this movie did NOT have Brotherhood in the name, I would take it as the 2nd FMA movie based on the first anime. I would've enjoyed it more too. It is much more similar to the first series.

The story itself is pretty good. I'm not gonna get into specifics, but the cental location is much different from Central. The new story focuses more on the character Julia than the Elric brothers. There was a lot of interesting fighting and pretty cool backdrops. I think the thing I enjoyed the most was the senseless gore in the movie. There was blood spurting out like a funnel, skin cutting off ect. It was crazy and unexpected, and that made me laugh.

This movie was not bad by itself as an anime movie, but as a Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood movie it strayed way too far from the path to be considered anything short of a disaster. It'd be like making an Iron Man movie, but making Iron Man's suit out of wood. I'm trying to be as fair with the movie as possible. It's enjoyable if you realize that the movie only uses the FMA characters and leaves everything else to the ideas of the movie's directors.

5048741,5,B0071LEOV2,"I have to say, when I saw the movie announced I was excited. When I saw it, I had mixed feelings about it at first. As the movie progressed though, it pulled me in and kept me until the very end of the movie credits.

First, you'll notice that the animation style has changed a bit. Let me give you my hypothesis on this. There is so much going on during this movie, action-wise, they had to use a more fluid animation style. That being said, the backdrops are beautiful and it portrays the Fullmetal world perfectly. The characters don't look any different, just the action scenes in the movie, I found, phenomenal.

Second, a warning to parents. This movie is pretty violent. The action in the movie is truly intense. (PG-13-R in some cases). There are fight and chase scenes that you'd expect from FMA, but much more drawn out.

Third, the story is hard to get into... at first. The movie has nothing to do with Brotherhood, it's just in that universe. It's about a brother and sister that get taken away from their home, Milos, into what seems to be a better life. Their parents are skilled Alchemists that are removed from Milos for research. The brother, Ashley, studies his parents Alchemic books and has an understanding of Alchemy... even the taboo. One night, Ashley and his sister, Julia, find that their parents have been attacked. The boy is murdered, and the girl faints at the sight of the murders of Ashley and her parents. Years later, in Amestris, Ed and Al begin hunting down an escapee from a prison who can use an unusual form of Alchemy. As eye witnesses, they are instructed to set off to Creta, a country not far from Amestria, to pursue him. In Creta, they see a beaten people... the Milonians searching for what is called a Sanguine Stone. And there they also find Julia.

5048742,4,B0071LEOV2,"I consider both Fullmetal Alchemist series to be the greatest anime of all time, so obviously I was very excited to hear of this movie. If you have seen any of the side story Bleach, Naruto, or even Pokemon movies, you should know what to expect. Your standard main characters go to a new town, meet some new characters and beat the bad guy story.

The story was very solid, although the first half was a little boring but it really picked up with twists and lots of action in the second half. What disappointed me was that this movie was missing the humor that Fullmetal Alchemist was known for. Yes we have seen the short jokes and cat-filled Alphonses before, but I would have enjoyed it for nostalgia and fan-services sake. It just felt like it really didn't focus enough on Ed and Al, which annoys me with these side story movies, because lets face it, thats why we are watching. I know they have two entire series and a movie dedicated to the brothers, but still I didn't watch it for the new throwaway characters. Overall though, very good.

The new art style is a mixed bag for me. They were clearly going for a mix of the series with a Ghibli-esque, very rounded, look. I enjoyed this for the most part. It was something new and different and looks awesome on blu-ray. It was still a shock to the system at some times, and background characters often looked horrible.

The animation itself was awesome. The music was pretty good too.

The dvd was 2 discs and the bluray 1 disc. The extras include u.s. cast commentary, and some funny history lessons from Roy Mustang, which unfortunately Funimation didn't decide to dub.

Overall good, but not the epic FMA I had hoped for.",1335916800,,1682,4.501639344262295
5048743,5,B0071LEOV2,"A great movie that I would highly recommend if you follow the series. There could have been more action with their abilities, but none the less, still good.",1335916800,,156,4.607142857142857
5048744,4,B0071LEOV2,"Sacred Star of Milos provides an interesting side story in the FMA universe. Taking place sometime after Ed and Al have discovered the true nature of the Philosopher's Stone.

While little in the movie implies that it must be fixed in either the original series' plot-line or that of the Brotherhood series, the spirit and tenor of the film is much more that of the original. The themes are mature, the violence more brutal and the general feel more intense than Brotherhood. FMA fans that preferred Brotherhood to the original may find Milos a little intense and graphic. Fans of both series will likely like the movie.

While I have read numerous critiques of shortfalls in the art and production, it didn't ultimately take away from the experience for me. In many ways, Sacred Star is one of the better attempts at a stand alone movie from a famous series. These are hard to make well (i.e. in a way that doesn't seem trite or contradict aspects of the original series) and Sacred Star doesn't mess this up.

I was honestly a little disappointed in how little the regular stable of characters figured in. Winry, Riza, Mustang and Armstrong all appear, but none of them play significant roles.

But ultimately this is a fun watch. Lots of action and good alchemy. Definitely recommend it to fans of the franchise.",1335830400,,1315,4.729257641921397
5048745,4,B0071LEOV2,"Being a pretty big FMA fan, I had some pretty high hopes when I heard about this movie. I'm glad to say that they were pretty well met.

Taken as a stand-alone story, the movies is very good. It's rather like a long episode, where Ed and Al go to a place to help deal with a situation. But the story is a lot more intricate and involved, with several twists and turns, and lots of action.

In the overall FMA story, it may not really add much. It does kinda flesh out a bit the state of uneasy peace Amestrias has with it's neighbors, in this case a place called Creta, along with some people caught between the two nations, the Milosians. For that matter, I'm not really sure at what point in the overall FMA story SSM fits. It seems like it comes in before the the Elrics meet up with the travelers from Xing.

The character of Julia is a good one, and story-wise she stands on an equal footing with Ed and Al--sympathetic, strong, determined to help her people. Concerning the overall FMA story, though, the evident fondness between her and Al does cause some problems, and that's probably the only part of the movie that may cause problems in the continuity. Still, it makes sense in the movie's storyline.

Various secondary characters make brief appearance, with Mustang, Hawkeye, and Winry receiving the most time. There is also Soyuz, who reminded me a lot of Yuki, but worse then the Yuki in Brotherhood. Though no homunculi make appearances, there are plenty of chimeras.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I would guess that any FMA fan would find this a good addition. I recommend it heartily.",1335657600,,1604,4.536332179930795
5048746,5,B0071LEOV2,After watching all the seasons of Full Metal I was a little disappointed to find out there aren't any of this progression style in Anime or very little but it was good ! Definitely worth it !,1335571200,,191,4.1891891891891895
5048747,4,B0071LEOV2,"Just bought this from Wal-Mart.  Could not wait to get home and view this.  I have been a 'Fullmetal Alchemist' fan for some years now and had high hopes for this new movie.

---Price Wise---

Not a bad price for the DVD.  14-15 bucks, on Amazon.com and Wal-mart.  Anime is notorious for being expensive, this will not break the bank.  The BLU-RAY is around 20.00  Still not too bad price wise.  DVD though is all you need.

---Special Features---

Nothing outstanding.  Trailers, tv advertisments, etc.  Disc-two is where the bulk of the materials are.  I have not delved into it yet, and I may not.  I am not a fan of commentarys.  There is a making of documentary, but from my experience, it will all be sub-titled.  I don't like subbed films/materials.  Although...I did like 'Trollhuhter'...

The only time I have ever been blown by a special feature was when I was playing 'The Street Fighter Collection' on my PS2, and discovered the entire 'Street Fighter 2: Movie' as a bonus feature.  I doubt any features on 'Fullmetal Alchemist...' will blow you away to that level.

---Film---

---Story----(***Some Minor Spoilers***)

The story is a bit confusing.  I am a avid fan of this series, and even I am not completely sure what is going on.  Also this movie REALLY jumps in and does not explain anything.  Again driving home the point this is for the fans.  New comers WILL be lost.

The main plot of the film are these two cities sitting side and side and hating/warring on each other much like our own Israel and Palestine do.  At the center is a young red haired woman named Julia.

The film begins with an alchemist escaping from a Central jail.  He is very skilled and wields a form of alchemy not witnessed by Ed & Al before.  FYI, he shoots lightning and can manipulate water, i.e. make ice and shoot it at you, that's his alchemy.  He bites his fingers and makes his needed transmutation circles with his blood, then busts out in a huge explosion.

The Elric Brothers go on the hunt for this escaped prisoner and wind up in Table City, where these two groups of aforementioned people are still fighting for who has dominance over ""the holy city"".  (This further drives home the reference to Israel and Palestine).

The main focus is as always the Philsophers Stone.  As usual the costs for obtaining one are of little consequence to the protaganists and entaganists.

Even if you are are a HARDCORE FMA FAN, you like me will still find yourself lost at times.  That is why I had to dock a star from my review, the story is just a little convoluted for my taste.  I don't believe the writers hashed it out enough in the conference room before proceeding into development.

Action-wise this Anime delivers.  The fighting scenes are of epic proportion.  Ed and Al's alchemy really comes life, although not much creativity is infused.  They mostly make columns and walls.  Col. Mustang's alchemy is NEVER showed, or at least nowhere I saw.  Save for him carterising a wound, he plays a small role in this, reserved by the writers to simply looked pissed in the background.

Animation quality varies from top notch all the way down to cheap tv anime series quality.  I never thought the wolf camerias ever looked right, especially during their transformations.

Where does this movie fit into the'...Brotherhood' series?  Your guess is as good as mine.

Still besides it's flaws, and the fact it is strickly geared toward fans and not to newcomers, this Anime film is still own-worthy, especially if you own 'FMA: Brotherhood' on DVD already, or plan to.

***In Conclusion***

DVD or BLU-RAY?  Personal choice, I would speculate, (and possibly have read), if you buy the BD/DVD combo pack you'll get a ""flipper disc"" with the DVD on one side and BD on the other.  I'm not a fan of ""flippers.""  Quality wise, I doubt you'll notice any difference in the BLU-RAY.  Only so much they can do with animation, although this title is stellar most of the time, I really don't think BD quality would alter it much.

Own-Worthy?  For the hardcore fans out there.  Not for someone who sees this and thinks ""Well that looks interesting.""  If you do think this, start with the series.

Despite it's hard to follow story, this film wins on other levels.  Keeping all the voices from the series, the same animation style and of course the heavy use of Alchemy.

Add this right beside your 'Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood' series and consider your set complete.  Of course there are the OVA's...

Hope this review is helpful.  As always sorry for any spelling errors.  I probably shoud read more and watch less Anime...",1335484800,,4613,4.6825
5048748,5,B0071LEOV2,"I'm not here to review the movie, just what it comes with. This set comes with a nice slipcover and a 3 disc combo. the movie itself with special features that include 1hour making of, US trailers, original Japanese trailers, Japanese tv spots, about a 20min japanese web promo about the movie, mostly about mr mustang talking about the country in the movie, a trailer for the 4 ova bluray of fullmetal alchemist brotherhood and some trailers for other anime. All of this was on the bluray itself.
this set comes with 2 dvds, i'm assuming half of the special features were split for the dvds. i know the movie is on one dvd and more features are on the second dvd. i haven't seen them i'm assuming they are the same as what is on the bluray just on two discs.
audio for both english and japanese language is 5.1 dolby which sounds awesome!
i hope this helps. i would say get the bluray even if you don't have a bluray player, this way you get everything in one set.",1335312000,,965,4.337016574585635
5048749,2,B0071LEOV2,"When I heard they were making a Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood movie, I was pretty darn excited. I kinda guessed it would be a side-story instead of something relevant to the overall plot, considering how FMA: B ended so neatly, so I wasn't surprised to see the story take Ed and Al outside their usual backdrop.

But ultimately I was disappointed by this movie as a whole. The animation is sloppy and overly-liquidized during the action scenes(as in it likes to think it's a Miyazaki movie but it isn't) and the work on everyone's hair is weird and sausage-like.

The plot consists of a simple formula. Waah waah waah, feel sorry for us and our plight, here's a sad scene, now go and do something actually interesting. Remind the veiwers ad nauseum about how the new characters are going to ""take back the holy land"" and voila. You have the plot for the Sacred Star of Milos. Guess what new characters? We don't care about you. You're boring. There are fifty other sob-stories in FMA that are more believable and touching.

Add to that the fact that the movie completely disrespects fans of the series who are already familiar with Ed and Al and their motivations, and you have a double-whammy of disappointment. The movie actually takes the time to remind us, with scenes, about just what Ed and Al are trying to accomplish (getting their bodies back), despite the fact that the only reason we'd even be watching this movie is if we were fans and we already knew that.

Tack on a twist ending that feels so phoned in M. Night must have wrote it, and there you go. The Sacred Star of Milos, everyone!

I'm not going to say that this movie is complete crap, the music is nice, the dubbing is done very well with the exception of the new redheaded chick whose high-pitched shouting and crying gets on my nerves.

But I still wouldn't recommend anyone buying this. Shoot, I wouldn't recommend anyone watching this for free.",1335312000,4,1923,4.624633431085044
5048750,3,B0071LEOV2,"The movie is not bad by all means, But the art style is just completely sloppy. Edward barely looks like himself. They put this movie together fast making lines sloppy, less detailed.",1335225600,2,183,4.75
5048751,5,B0071LEOV2,"Fullmetal Alchemist (particularly Brotherhood) has grown to be one of my favorite animes of all time involving great storytelling & action. When I heard of the Sacred Stars of Milos movie I was pretty excited about it, after finishing the Brotherhood series I just wanted MORE Alchemst. This movie is supposed to take place between episodes 20 and 21 in another country of Creta which would be to the west of Amestris of the Brotherhood series, where Ed gains newfound inspiration of returning Alphonse's original body back, in theory the storyline works but the inconsistancy of the movie's setting may annoy die hard fans, personally I can care less because the timeline DOES have space where the movie CAN actually occur so it does not bother me. The animation in this movie is distinctly different then the Brotherhood series, and I cannot believe the negative feedback it recieved. The animation is done beautifully in my opinion, filled with a bright variety of colors, well-incorporated moments of CGI and fight sequences that made FMA wonderous to watch. This style of animation is very reminicent of Hayao Miyazaki's films in the late 80's and 90's. The english dubbing was very well done, as expected from FUNimation productions, with all of the english voice actors reprising their roles including the flamboyant Vic Mignogna (voice of Ed) which is always a joy to hear. I am not going to spoil the plot for the movie, if you wanna find out about it buy this movie or read about it online, but in my opinion this movie was a great time.

The Extras, are pretty standard from FUNimation, a couple of trailers from up and coming anime series, a couple of web promos and trailers of the movie itself. However, they have included a nice 30 min (give or take) making of Sacred Star of Milos featurette with the Directors and producers as well as the original voice actors of the movie. It was a nice feature adding a nice in depth look towards the hard work behind the movie including the difficulties of intergrating a movie that would fit in the series canon as well as keeping true to the FMA world that Hiromu Arakawa created. It was a nice touch when compared to the awful special features that FUNimation is infamous for. Also included on the first disc is a humorous commentary track from the U.S. cast voicing out their feelings about the dubbing process and overall love for the FMA franchise. If you love FMA then buy this movie, there is no reason why an FMA fan would not like this movie.",1335225600,2,2506,4.695454545454545
5048752,4,B0071LEOV2,"I saw this at Otakon, and when I went in, my expectations were set at Conqueror of Shambala height which was ""this will probably be pretty bad and leave me with a disgusting taste in my mouth because it will screw up the story and butcher the characters"". What I saw was definitely above that, though admittedly I was disappointed with the lack of any recognizable characters for any length of time besides Edward and Alphonse. That disappointment went away after the director himself stated that they had a challenge because they could not mess with the story in terms of reveals or ""in depth"" anything with major characters, and so the movie was set at a point where a deviation would be able to work without too many problems: after the events of Episode 19, Death of the Undying. It's also a bit bloodier than the 2003 series or Brotherhood, so there's the only warning I'll give on that front.

The biggest criticism I have is the art itself. I think the best comparison I can make is that appearance-wise, it resembled a random filler episode's quality. The lack of sharp edges on characters' hair makes them look more like they're all sporting some sort of dreadlock-esque style. Edward's gradient eyes were kind of distracting if just because it made him feel more like he was a different version of the character altogether. The line quality seemed rough and unrefined. The animation felt a little choppy in places. For an animated work shown on the big screen, things like that are crucial. Perhaps the transition to disc will make up for some of those shortcomings by putting it on a much smaller screen.

As for the story itself, it's an interesting take given the limitations they had to work with: something that would wrap itself up and never be seen or heard of again so that it doesn't affect the overall continuity of the story. Had it interfered, I'd have liked it far less because that would have given it the ""tacked on as an afterthought to tie it in"" feeling. But reading the negative reviews, I guess some people like that sort of thing? The story didn't revolve around Edward and Alphonse, but around the new place they found themselves in.

While I wasn't terribly fond of the new characters, I did like that the Elrics weren't the be all and end all of the movie. They were the foreigners coming into a new place and getting pulled into the conflicts of the area. To focus solely on them would have taken the movie and made it into another Conqueror of Shambala where you really learn nothing at all except what Ed and Al are doing at every waking moment. It's the Sacred Star of Milos, not the Adventures of Ed and Al in Some City. If I wanted the ""Ed and Al Show"", I'd watch the 2003 series and CoS again.

Yes, some of the more well-known characters are relegated to being cameos. If you keep in mind the events of Episode 19 and you'll understand WHY they are. There is nowhere in the movie to really explain where it falls in the timeline, though, which makes the movie feel like it's a little out of place overall, much like the video games.

I did not see this dubbed so I can't say anything about the English track. Knowing the way FUNimation is where this series is concerned, though, it's probably not bad at all.

I'm going to be buying it because I want to support FUNimation and Aniplex, not because it was OMGTHEBEST. It was not my favourite, but it wasn't bad, and so long as you don't go into it expecting Miyazaki quality, you'll be fine. It's an anime movie based off of a series, not a stand alone movie in which the entirety of the world and all of the characters have to be given in that short span, and it shows.

In the end, whether you borrow it from someone, buy it yourself, or rent it first, I recommend giving it a chance.",1334966400,8,3777,4.465217391304348
