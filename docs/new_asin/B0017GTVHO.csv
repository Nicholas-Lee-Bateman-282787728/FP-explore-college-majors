8265813,2,B0017GTVHO,"Here are some comments about the 1965 Italian film, ""Bambole"" (The Dolls) as released by Video Dimensions. I had purchased several of this company's European classics DVDs and they were all in their original language with optional English subtitles. Unfortunately, this particular release is dubbed in English, and as was the case with most dubbed European films from that period, not a very good job. If you know what Virna, Elke and Monica sound like, you will be annoyed by this as all three have been assigned high-pitched, girlish voices. As far as my ear can tell, only Tamiroff and La Lollo dubbed themselves.

This was one of several European vignette movies from the 50's and 60's that were popular with producers as they gave the audience a chance to see several then popular stars for the price of one, and, to be sure, their paychecks must have reflected their limited onscreen time.

When I first saw ""Bambole"" in its original Italian release, I must have been so taken with the leading ladies, that I did not notice how weak the stories were. The first segment tells of the attempts of an aroused husband (Nino Manfredi) to get his gorgeous wife (Virna Lisi) into their bedchamber, a feat made impossible because she is engaged in a gabby and endless phone conversation with her mother. The second story has Elke Sommer as a nordic beauty who has come to Italy seeking the perfect Italian stud to sire her child with no other complications, including romance. The third story is about a fed up working class wife, a miscast Monica Vitti, much too glamorous for a part that calls for Magnani, though I'm not sure this would improve matters. She spends the entire segment trying to hire several town bumpkins into bumping off her slovenly husband. The fourth story concerns a beautiful and sex starved hotel keeper (a depersonilized Gina Lollobrigida in an unbecoming platinum wig) to woo to her bed the studious and seemingly indifferent nephew (Jean Sorel) of a visiting monsignor (Akim Tamiroff). Of course, given the recent revelations about Vatican goings on, this could be taken in another direction, but that's a whole different bag of beans.

The vignettes consist of drawn-out one-joke storylines that wear thin very quickly. The attitude toward sex is typical of that period: a one-note leer, the humor on the level of Catholic school boys writing naughty short stories during their Geography lesson, so you have to keep your perspective under control, particularly if you're a female. Maybe it is funnier in Italian. Who knows.

The print quality is about what I remember from the original release: rather dim and a bit on the inky side. Only a two star rating for the lousy dubbing and a print that could be digitally improved.",1393459200,5,2751,4.859275053304904
8265814,3,B0017GTVHO,"Four comedic vignettes dealing with sex. Directed by Nino Risi, a husband (Nino Manfredi) desirous of sex with his wife (Virna Lisi) must wait while she has an endless discussion on the phone with her mother. Directed by Luigi Comencini, a student (Elke Sommer) of eugenics attempts to track down the perfect Italian male to father her child. Directed by Franco Rossi, an unhappy housewife (Monica Vitti) tries to hire somebody to kill her husband without much success. Based on a story by Boccaccio and directed by Mauro Bolognini, a married woman (Gina Lollobrigida) lusts after the virginal nephew (Jean Sorel) of a Catholic priest (Akim Tamiroff) and uses the priest in an attempt to seduce the nephew. Ah, the Italian sex comedy. Quite naughty in their day but after years of graphic sexuality, today their mischievousness seems almost innocent. The first two are negligible but the last two are fairly amusing with both Vitti and Lollobrigida displaying their farcical talents. The melodic score is by Armando Trovajoli.

The Sony DVD via Italy is a decent anamorphic wide screen (1.85) transfer. Language options include both English and Italian as well as optional subtitles for both.",1323388800,7,1192,5.112820512820512
