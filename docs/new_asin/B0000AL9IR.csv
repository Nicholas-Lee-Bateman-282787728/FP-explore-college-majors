7997582,4,B0000AL9IR,"Great Kung Fu. It may not have been the first for shirt weapons, grappling, dui mak, and drumstick fist, but it is definitely the earliest to combine these styles with spirit. Oddly touching at times as the prankster meets his match, not oer fists but over dinner. Highly recommended, perhaps worth a remake? -1 star for quality of sound, OTW totally awesome!",1505001600,,359,4.806451612903226

7997585,4,B0000AL9IR,"I decided to purchase this based on a previous review.  When I received the disc, I thought I was in for a low-budget waste o' ten bucks. (I rounded off). I must say that I enjoyed this movie immensely.  As a major fan of old-school kung fu flicks, this one ranks up at the top.  Specifically because it's consistently good from start to finish.  In most martial arts movies of the late 70's, they start off dreadfully, in both humor and choreography, then get better as they go.  The humor is kept to a minimum and the fights are consistently good and inventive.

The picture quality is very good.  It does suffer if you compare it to remastered Shaw Bros. movies.  If you like the old-school, I can't imagine that you won't enjoy this.  The price is excellent.  My only complaint with this one is that it is not in widescreen, though i don't recall it being a big deal while viewing.
