Over the years I'd heard about Batman's new gritty relaunch, read some of the stuff, and didn't care for it (if I wanted gritty realism, why would I be reading comics? I can turn on the news for free.)

But I've been very much enjoying ""The Batman"" animated series on Boomerang. The depiction of Bruce Wayne seems to strike a perfect note - dark enough to take him seriously, yet still recognizably a human being (glory be, he even cracks a smile now and then!) Detective Yin is a strong, intelligent female character, and for the most part women are not portrayed with the impossible physiques and clingy clothes that characterized ""Batman - the Animated Series"".

I've enjoyed ""The Batman"" so much I'm considering buying the complete series - which will be the first DC-related purchase I've made in years.",1266278400,,989,4.64
