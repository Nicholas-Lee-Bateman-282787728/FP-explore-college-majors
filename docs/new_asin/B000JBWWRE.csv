2667404,3,B000JBWWRE,A cute but standard chick flick. It is good enough for a quick bit of entertainment but nothing thrilling. THe acting is okay but the story line could use some fine tuning.,1243209600,,172,4.40625
2667405,5,B000JBWWRE,"I stayed home sick one day and there was nothing on tv, so I decided to check out the free movies on demand channel.  This was one of the options.  I actually watched it twice!  It's a great lighthearted romantic comedy that was extremely entertaining.  Sit back, have a laugh and enjoy!",1220486400,,287,4.461538461538462
2667406,1,B000JBWWRE,"For any family that holds to any kind of traditional moral standard, this movie is deplorable.  Maybe if one thinks lying is 'cutsie' it might be comical.  But, I find nothing amusing about a whole movie premised on a knowing lie.  Then, to bring a young girl into lying as well, it becomes even more abominable.  Finally, to see that everything becomes 'okay' because the boss is known to lie as well, we reached the straw that breaks the camel's back.  So, if you have any desire to instill truthfulness in your kids, stay away from this movie.  Lying causes too much damage to make light of it.",1207785600,2,597,4.481481481481482
2667407,5,B000JBWWRE,"I watched 'Family Plan' for the first time on the Hallmark Channel. I started looking for it on DVD or VHS and at the time, no one had it. I'm so glad amazon is coming out with it. You won't regret watching this! It had me laughing out loud so many times. But the ending is sweet, a great gift for yourself or someone else.",1164326400,3,323,3.9846153846153847
2667408,4,B000JBWWRE,"I got this movie because I am a Tori Spelling fan and watched it on a relaxed Sunday morning. It was a cute movie and Tori looked very pretty throughout the film. Nice scenery too. You could see the ending coming a mile away, but if I like a film that doesn't bother me and I don't see it as a drawback. The only  problem I had with the movie was I didn't see any romantic chemistry between Tori and co-star Jordan. They had a pleasant, friendly chemistry between them  and he is an incredibly attractive guy but I didn't see any real romantic sparks there. Oh well, I still like this movie and will probably watch it again someday. It's a nice way to spend a couple of hours.",1402704000,,676,4.1923076923076925
2667409,4,B000JBWWRE,"This is a typical TV movie. It is the story of a girl who is talked into pretending she is married in order to keep her job when her company is taken over by another whose CEO stresses family values. She ends up hiring an actor to play the part of her husband and she uses her best friend's daughter to play the part of her daughter. Of course it's obvious from almost the first moment they do their act that they will eventually fall in love. In that sense, this is a pretty standard TV romantic comedy. It's not terribly original but it is fairly clean-cut and enjoyable to watch. Most of the actors do a decent job with their parts although a few of them seems a bit stilted or out of place in some scenes. There are a couple of twists to the plot that are somewhat unrealistic and overdone, but for the most part it isn't too bad. It is a nice little low-budget feel-good movie that's worth checking out.",1373587200,2,908,4.224137931034483
2667410,4,B000JBWWRE,"Family Plan is a bit contrived, as are most comedic stories, but it is a lot of fun. There are many funny lines--it is a hoot! To me, Jordan Bridges (who acts within acting) and Abigail Breslin steal the show. Tori Spelling is also acting within acting, and plays auncomfortable workaholic doing anything to stay on top. Greg Germann ios the boss of the perefcect family compnay, which of course is not perfect. Some good lessons in there somewhere. (smile)",1372550400,2,457,4.725
2667411,4,B000JBWWRE,"This film was first aired in 2005, so Abigail Breslin, child star, is left off Amazon's data of actors. She plays a 6-7 year old which is a year before her great hit: Little Miss Sunshine in 2006, followed by Nim's Island and Kit kittridge-An American Girl in 2008. Born in 1996, Abigail was really nine when Family Plan aired..and 12 in Nihm's Island. Today she has transferred from child star to adult.

PS: Family Plan is a sweat movie.",1362614400,,439,4.4875
2667412,5,B000JBWWRE,Just a really good movie. Would show it to almost everyone. Good one to watch when you need a pick me up.,1355788800,,105,3.8181818181818183
2667413,4,B000JBWWRE,"**** SPOILER ALERT *********

This was an enjoyable movie. The premise is far-fetched, but if you are willing to sit back and be entertained, then it's fun. I took off a star because it was disturbing that an employee's personal life was used as the basis for determining if she was a good fit for the company. She retained her job because she pretended to be married! How lame is that? By all reports, she was a great employee, and this never should have been an issue. Have they heard of Equal Employment Opportunity?

As for the characters involved, and the moral message, the movie is rated PG. I doubt very seriously if anyone past the age of seven would believe that living this lie is ok. So kids may enjoy it and laugh at it, but I'd hope parents see it as a vehicle for discussing why the lying, and the situations depicted, were wrong.  This isn't a movie I'd buy to keep small children entertained without adult supervision. But I'm an adult, and I'm not going to think it's ok to lie to keep my job. Why would I want to work somewhere if I had to pretend to be something I'm not just to keep my job?

When I just relaxed into the entertainmet and watched the movie, it was hilarious. It wasn't until after I thought about it that it rankled a bit. But I am planning to watch it again. And it will make me laugh and smile again every time it's played.  Just don't take it seriously, and everything will be fine.",1327104000,,1422,4.291044776119403
2667414,5,B000JBWWRE,"I can tell this movie is probably a little on the cheesey side, but if you are a Tori Spelling fan you don't care at all and will fall in love with it!",1294704000,,151,3.606060606060606
2667415,5,B000JBWWRE,"Family Plan is an absolutely delightful light comedy about a woman who fakes her marital status in order to get a job. Well, everything seems to be perfect 'till her boss moves into the house next door -- and she has to find a way to continue this sham! Of course, the always adorable Tori Spelling falls in love with the actor hired to portray her husband!

This movie is so cute, and almost seems like the kind of movie that Doris Day would have made years ago. So, if you enjoy a little screwball romantic comedy, I highly recommend Family Plan!",1285027200,,548,4.372549019607843
2667416,4,B000JBWWRE,This is a cute little flick.  I like Tori Spelling and think she did a good job in the role.  Cute chic flick,1267920000,,109,3.6956521739130435
