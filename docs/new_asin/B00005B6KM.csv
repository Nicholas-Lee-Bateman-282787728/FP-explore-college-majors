1420944,5,B00005B6KM,"Filming a dance piece designed to be performed live is, like any other translation, a compromise at best. The beauty and athleticism here is amazing. Black tights against a black background in some pieces made the dancers legs difficult to see. Maybe I was supposed to be distracted from their legs in the water piece, Reflections of Four, or not notice them in the silliness of The Envelope. In live performance, in was breathtaking to see David Parsons floating above the stage in his signature piece, Caught. In the recording, it was difficult to tell what was going on. Wonderful performances, but also see the company live if you can.",1014249600,20,639,4.818181818181818
7936776,5,B00005B6KM,"This DVD of the Parsons dance company would perhaps garner only four stars but for the amazing and hilarious ballet ""The Envelope"", with its perfectly chosen music by Rossini.  This is simply too good to pass up, especially if you have a quirky sense of humor.  The other ballets may interest you, as will the talks by the choreographer Parsons.  The dancing is excellent.",1505433600,,372,4.78125

7936778,5,B00005B6KM,"My mother saw this dance company in a dance called ""Envelope"" on PBS and raved about it.  I purchased the DVD and it is awesome.  Great dancers...I love modern dance ....all the things I like of the style are there. Whimsy, soft and hard moves, free spirit, and flowing fabric on the dancers.  The choreography is excellent.",1422748800,,324,4.649122807017544

7936780,5,B00005B6KM,"The talent of this  dance company is absolutely amazing.  I love their combination of excellence in motion and expression with whimsey, although some pieces are definitely more serious.  I would highly recommend it.  The pieces are rather short, 15 to 20 minutes or so, which makes it convenient when you have limited time, or you can watch all of the sets.  My favorite is ""The Envelope"".  It actually made me laugh out loud.",1404086400,2,426,4.767123287671233
7936781,5,B00005B6KM,Excellent dances and choreography I recommend to anyone who appreciate the art of dancing. I received the video really fast,1372636800,,123,5.2
7936782,5,B00005B6KM,"David Parsons not only owns the dance company, but is also the sole choreographer. The troops are all experienced perfomers and dancers, and the theme of each dance piece is so expressive and overt, I use this DVD when introducing ballet and dance to a novice. Most of the performers, and especially David Parsons, exhibit the decipline and skill to dance classical ballet if required.",1186531200,6,385,4.938461538461539
7936783,5,B00005B6KM,"Awesome dance DVD!!!!!!!!  Very thought provoking.  The dancers are amazing and the choregorgraphy is original, artistic, surreal, and avant garde.  A featured dance, The Envelope is perfect! Enjoy!",1178928000,3,198,6.0

7936785,5,B00005B6KM,"David Parsons had studied gymnastics before being introduced to dance through Alvin Ailey's association with Leonard Bernstein's ""Mass"".  Some years later, after a brief fling with audio engineering work, he joined the Paul Taylor Dance Company, eventually becoming one of the male lead dancers.  After hours, he experimented with his own choreography and some of these pieces came to be presented at New York City's Dance Theater Workshop.  Elliot Feld purchased one such work and it was this confidence, in Mr. Parson's talent, that lead David to starting the Parsons Dance Company in 1987.
""The Parsons Dance Company"" DVD features seven separate pieces that consist of two different styles of video translation.
The first three works on the disc, ""Fine Dining"", ""Brothers"" and ""Reflections of Four"", take full advantage of the capability of video as a recording medium. These pieces incorporate set design, editing, composition and lighting that would be difficult to translate into a live theater setting.
The last four works, ""Caught"", ""Scrutiny"", ""The Envelope"" and ""Nascimento"" are performed on a more or less traditional dance stage, with minimal set design and a surreal lighting sensibility.  These four works appear to proceed as live events, with the camera work and editing used mostly to support documentation of the stage choreography.
Each of the seven pieces is introduced by David Parsons and a short verbal portrait of the principle dancers, in the Parsons Company, is presented towards the end of the disc.
The music chosen for the dances is by David Linton, Igor Stravinsky, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Robert Fripp, Michael Raye, Gioacchino Rossini and Milton Nascimento.  The duration of the entire presentation runs some One Hundred and Sixteen minutes.
""The Parsons Dance Company"" DVD can be recommended, without reservation, to all fans of contemporary dance, for the physical zeal of the dancers, their humor, their grace, and also for the fine technical quality of the audio/video recording.",1039305600,57,2016,5.347003154574132
