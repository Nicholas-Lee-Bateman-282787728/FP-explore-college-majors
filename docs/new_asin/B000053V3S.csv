He has really humanized them by showing them in thier daily lives and following their careers as they progress.  Doug Church was especially endearing to all of us watching. However, we learned so much about many of the others such as Irv Cass and Johnny Thompson. It was also amazing to finally put a face to the name John Stuart. Our family has seen Legends in Concert dozens of times and now we know the genious behind the success of this show thanks to Paget's work. Thankyouverymuch from all of us. This is a fine tribute to those who have worked so hard to keep a dream alive.",983145600,6,757,4.518248175182482
1390159,5,B000053V3S,"Seattle's talk radio station The Buzz 100.7 FM called this the best movie ever made in the ""Elvis Phenomenon"" genre. This journey into the strange but true world of Elvis obsession is hysterical;  but it also has insightful analysis into the phenomenon, with running commentary from a professor of Elvis studies (not something you'll find at your local university). Also has powerful performances from impersonators who are so good at doing Elvis its eerie!  Especially the guy who wins the world championship Elvis contest at the end.  What a triumph!",983145600,5,552,5.111111111111111
1390160,5,B000053V3S,"I've been an Elvis fan since I first heard his voice and for the last few years, an Elvis Tribute Artist promoter. I therefore waited patiently for the film release of ALMOST ELVIS. Would it be complimentary? Or would it be  a joke? I've come to know many tribute artists, so was anxious to see what  a group of young guys from Washington could put together that would  compliment the talent and work impersonators go through to become  recognized tribute artists. Needless to say, I'm impressed.  This film is  for everyone who's ever heard the name ""Elvis,"" and invaluable to  everyone's collection. It's the ultimate and highest form of compliment to  Elvis Presley by worldwide tribute artists, fans, agents and promoters. I  shed some tender tears and laughed out loud as entertainers candidly  humanized Elvis for those of us who remember him well. It was wonderful and  refreshing to meet entertainers behind the scenes, to bring to life once  again our wonderful memories and to have them reveal their own  personalities, playfulness, work and their obvious love of spreading the  word of Elvis. Many of us have memorized every word of every record Elvis  ever made. So have the tribute artists. Many of us remember the boy who  dared to rock. So do the tribute artists. And, many of them don't,  therefore have become impressive in learning and recognizing the depth of  Elvis Presley on their own. John Paget and his crew have successfully  covered many aspects of the tribute artist/impersonator phenomenon in this  amazing video; we witness the rockabilly years, the beautiful love songs  and the powerful voice range of gospel, giving today's audiences exciting  examples of the reasons Elvis Presley was proclaimed Artist of the Century.  This dynamic documentary also gives us a glimpse into Elvis's musical  roots.  It's family entertainment at it's best, and a compliment to the  tribute artists featured, long overdue and well deserved. We can all take  time to learn about Elvis and listen to his music, but only a tribute  artist/impersonator offers us the opportunity to experience Elvis. This is  a film filled with positive energy and the unique fantasy of Elvis alive.  Experience ALMOST ELVIS for yourself - 5 gold stars is a rating earned.  Blue Shoe Productions can only continue their talented filming and bring us  more!",963619200,15,2349,5.005181347150259
1390161,5,B000053V3S,"This movie is absolutely entertaining and a must see for anyone who is interested in the Elvis subculture!  You will be surprised to find out who these people are and the love thay have for the King!  John Paget captures  their aspirations and fears in a sensitive documentary that will have  laughing with them not at them!  You see the sacrifices they make for the  thrill of the stage, you also meet their groupies - the 'sideburn chasers'!  Fame has it's rewards!",961027200,6,467,4.621951219512195
1390162,5,B000053V3S,"I'm a HUGE Elvis fan, and I thought this was going to be questionable, and maybe a little bit in bad taste.  This film did have some hillarious moments.  But it was absolutely beautiful.  There were guys who literally  became Elvis when they went on stage.  I think the concert performances  were the best.  The other thing that really struck me was how devoted these  guys are as fans.  There weren't really any goofballs or wackos like I  expected, just incredible entertainers and Elvis fans.  I'm proud to say I  was in tears at the end when they are talking about what Elvis meant to  them and why they do what they do.  Overall, I cannot recommend this  enough.  It's very informative, entertaining, and a big departure from all  the Elvis smut we see so much of.  A big thumbs up, way up!",959990400,,795,4.440559440559441

7930099,5,B000053V3S,I am a huge fan of Elvis Presley. I was not fortunate enough to see him in person. I enjoy seeing Tribute Artists. I have seen some really good ones and some not so good but I enjoy them and listening to Elvis music.,1346198400,,216,3.9318181818181817
7930100,3,B000053V3S,"Like TRIBUTARY and SIMULATION, John Paget's ALMOST ELVIS suffers from wanting to include a cavalcade of Elvises rather than focusing on why these folks pay tribute to The King or how it feels to make a living off the memory of Elvis.  More important, Paget ignores the folks who pay to see Elvis impersonators and barely touches on the cultural phenomenon of Elvis and the legions of people who choose to emulate him.

  ALMOST ELVIS starts off strong, following the path to the 1999 Images of Elvis competition in Memphis, Tennessee.  The main character of the documentary is Irv Cass of Niles, Michigan.  Cass does one hell of a tribute to The King; his sideburns real, his voice strong, and his jumpsuit snug.  While the cynosure of the film is the night of a hundred Elvises (which ends up looking rather shabby), ALMOST ELVIS indulges in a few vignettes, which feature other Elvis impersonators or trappings of the trade.

  Too late in the game, the audience meets Robert Washington, a battleship painter who seems destined to never take the grand prize at the impending contest due to the color of his skin.  The introduction of Washington and his racial ""dilemma"" opens a can of worms that no one in ALMOST ELVIS, including the filmmaker, seems comfortable in exploring.  Even in this potentially objective arena, Washington gets short shrift.

  If Washington is a serious Elvis impersonator being treated as something like a joke, another documentary takes a ""joke"" and shows the serious side of it, EL VEZ: EL REI DE ROCK `N' ROLL.  This work examines El Vez, a ""Latino novelty act.""  Director Marjorie Chodorov manages to go behind the perfectly coiffed faade of El Vez to present Robert Lopez, the brown bombshell's alter ego.",1149120000,3,1739,4.860544217687075
7930101,3,B000053V3S,"This is an interesting documentary. We follow three (we see and hear from many more) impersonators trying to get their chance to go to Memphis and become the 1999 Images of Elvis winner. It's strange to see the lengths some of these guys will go to trying to look and sing like E. We get to see impersonators from all over the world, Japan, Belgium; there are black Elvis', women Elvis', and young and old kings. In the deleted scene section we even meet the political correct Elvis. I was very disappointed in the presentation of the disc. It should have been presented in a wide screen format. Some of the information about the people like their names, places, or just general information about an event you can either barely read or you can't even make it out. It was like we were zoomed in to far on the picture. Anyway if you love Elvis Aron Presley or you just want a good chuckle check it out. Then rent Elvis: That's the way it is and check out the real thing.",1046736000,,968,4.3535911602209945

7930103,5,B000053V3S,"What makes a good Elvis Impersonator?  Is it the well tanned face below a black, greasy pompadour?  Is it the half-zipped jumpsuit, exposing a sweaty, untamed forest of chest hair?  Is it the pelvic thrusting, or the sideburns, or the attention to detail on the custom made rhinestone jacket?  We learn that it takes all this and a little more in Almost Elvis, a documentary conceived by Olympia filmmaker John Paget.
  Almost Elvis casts its spotlight on the oft ridiculed and frequently misunderstood world of Elvis impersonation.  Now numbering over 35,000 today, Elvis impersonators come from every walk of life and region of the country, with growing numbers in Mexico, Belgium and Japan.  It was this amazing statistic that first inspired Paget to make this offbeat film.
  ""I was tired of seeing documentaries on insignificant events like wildlife and wars, and saw that this was a subject that hadn't been investigated and deserved a closer look,"" Paget commented on his innovative opus.  ""There has never been a phenomenon in the history of mankind quite like this.""
  Before shooting began, Paget spent three months doing research and scouring the Internet for impersonators interested in sharing their amazing stories.  ""I started getting hundreds of emails.  People were sending me 8 x10's, and telling me that I had to feature them, claiming to be better than Elvis,"" said Paget.
  From this large list, Paget narrowed the cast down to a few standouts. The film follows the lives of these prominent impersonators as they prepare for competition, share trade secrets and explain how and why they took up the hobby (and in some cases, full time occupation) of emulating the King of Rock.  These dedicated men (and women) were once janitors, DJ's, exotic dancers and paperboys, united by the common goal of insuring the memory of Elvis Presley.
  While briefly showcasing the colorful cavalcade of the King, most interviews are with the frontrunners of the 1999 Images of Elvis competition held in Memphis each year.  The judges have their work cut out for them, as different judges are partial to different facets of Presley's persona.  Quentin Flagg is the youngest competing Presley doppelganger; at 17, his youth and waistline enable him to emulate the King at his rise.  Another intimidating competitor, with the looks, moves, and even the bulge, is Irv Cass, who has won numerous regional competitions as well as the hearts of lustful older women.  A third, controversial but well respected impersonator is Robert Washington.  Though African-American, Washington has the sound and energy needed to compete, but has only placed second year after year.
  In addition to impersonators, Paget also taps other key participants of this subculture.  Interviews with judges, die hard fans, and even the manufacturers of the gaudy replica jumpsuits add another dimension to this world.
  The film serves the dual purpose of entertaining as well as educating the audience with facts they didn't know they wanted to know.  The spirit of the film is often tongue in cheek; some impersonators are in on the joke while others fail to see the humor in their lifestyle choice.
Even if you're not an Elvis fan, as long you enjoy well made documentaries, Almost Elvis is worth your consideration.",1012089600,10,3294,5.078212290502793
7930104,5,B000053V3S,"By far the most energetic, exciting, hilarious and overall entertaining documentary I've ever seen (no offense to The Learning Channel.)  The director has a keen sense of humor which thoroughly documents the dillusioned world of elvis impersonators while allowing the rest of us to look in on it and laugh.  It's presented like ""This is Spinal Tap"" except it is scary because Irv Cass is real.  The poster hangs on the wall of my college dorm.",1012089600,,443,4.802631578947368
