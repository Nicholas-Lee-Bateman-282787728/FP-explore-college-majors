7002629,5,B00T73ANNK,"I think this film is really unique in its ability to address the struggles of both a teen and his parents in an authentic, non-commercial way. The music scenes were well-performed and believable. The themes of alienation and hope really came through, but I didn't feel like I was being hit over the head. I find myself thinking about this film -- and the family it portrayed -- often, as the film so poignantly addresses (and questions) our modern world: the choices we make, the values we hold dear, and what it really means to be a family.",1424044800,5,541,4.530612244897959

7002633,5,B00T73ANNK,"I LOVED this movie!!! The story is so inspirational and heartwarming. It's about following your dreams even if they may seem unrealistic, or too impossible to come true.

7002635,5,B00T73ANNK,"Thought this was a beautiful movie not only about a mother trying to
find herself after giving so much of herself to her family, but also a
reminder that a mom will always try to find a way to connect with her
child (in this case her youngest son). As a mom, this was a beautiful
reminder of never giving up...",1512950400,,310,4.098360655737705

7002638,5,B00T73ANNK,My favorite thing about this film is that I realized halfway through that I was smiling almost the entire time.  It's such a down-to-earth story with great casting and performances.  I also appreciated the fact that the script avoided the easy melodrama that is apparent in most films.  It touched on family issues without over-blowing them for dramatic effect.  Kudos to all.  A great family film that all can enjoy.,1511740800,,417,4.9
7002639,5,B00T73ANNK,"A great movie with a wonderful story.  Finneas O'Connell of Glee and The Slightly's fame is wonderful and so is his real-life mother, Maggie Baird.",1486684800,,147,4.88

7002641,5,B00T73ANNK,"This is a very good and believably authentic film with a very good soundtrack--especially the final song. Since music is so integral to the film, I was hoping the soundtrack CD would eventually be released as well.  I found the whole film deeply moving, and that doesn't happen very often these days! Nice to know that someone still knows how to make really good films.",1466812800,,369,4.676923076923077

7002651,5,B00T73ANNK,"This is a super film! Beautifully shot and directed with a true sense of reality. I laughed and cried (really) and enjoyed all the subtle moments and great music. Succinctly captures the challenges facing teenagers and parents alike in our contemporary world. Inspires a ""just go for it"" attitude. Especially worth watching a second time!",1440633600,2,338,5.163636363636364

7002658,5,B00T73ANNK,"Anytime seeing a low budget independent film you may have your doubts but movies like this are why we all take a shot on them. Being in a household and peer group that you don't quite fit in is tough and Life Inside Out manages to nail this perfectly. As a parent we hope to help our children to find their way and this film is a prime example of that struggle. If you have any interest in music and the story of a parent helping out a child trying to find their way, this is one you have to watch. They manage to capture the struggle of one that has missed out on the pursuit of their dreams but at the same time manages to help their child find theirs. Finding ones identity is something we all have struggled with but Life Inside Out manages to show how truly rewarding it can be to help someone you love find theirs.",1437264000,2,820,4.099378881987578

7002662,5,B00T73ANNK,"An excellent movie that I would highly recommend.  A movie about real people, living real lives, in a real house  that deals with the difficulties of being a teenager and the difficulties parents have relating to and trying to help their teenage child.  It also deals with the problems of creating, specifically creating music and being a person with creative ability but not an overwhelming singing talent and developing these and the struggle for improvement.  I don't like to know too much about a movie before I see it, so I won't say much more except that when I bought the movie, I expected it to be very good and it exceeded these very high expectations.  I recommend it highly.",1436227200,3,685,4.675

7002664,5,B00T73ANNK,"This is such a heart warming film. I loved when I first saw it at the 2014 Phoenix Film Festival and couldn't wait for it to be released. Whether you've a Mom of teenagers, or a teen thinking you don't fit in, this film says it all. I watch and find myself smiling through tears often  as the bond between a mother and son becomes deeper. Wonderful acting by Maggie Baird and Finneas O'Connell (real life mother and son) as they find more fulfillment in their individual lives.",1433808000,,477,4.420454545454546

7002673,5,B00T73ANNK,"I caught this movie at the Heartland Film Festival and loved it.  I've watched many independent films at such festivals over the years and this is a standout.  Although movie cynics may find small issue with acting, cinematography, or other film details, this is an outstanding effort for a first film from the cast, crew, screenwriter, etc.  Maggie Baird and Finneas O'Connell are great and I hope another film is on its way from their creative team.  I am still a little bummed that the music from the film is not available for purchase online.",1425945600,,546,4.71578947368421

7002675,5,B00T73ANNK,"Not often enough do parents and children connect on a molecular level but as this film shows it is possible and believable and that is an inspiration for all of us to try!

7002680,5,B00T73ANNK,"We watched this at the Beloit (Wisconsin) International Film Festival. The director was actually there to talk to as well which was great. What a fantastic and moving film, showing the growing bond between a mother and a son. This is based loosely on the real life of a mother and son. Those two are the actual actors in the movie! It's also great if you love music and writing songs.",1424995200,,384,4.422535211267606
7002681,5,B00T73ANNK,Just saw this film last night at the Beloit International Film Festival and it is definitely a must see for those who enjoy a good story which also happens to have a great soundtrack. It's a mother-son journey to discover who they are and how they can express themselves in this world.,1424995200,,285,4.5
7002682,5,B00T73ANNK,"This is one of those films that kind of gets lost in the shuffle.  It's not edgy enough for Sundance and it's not big enough to be marketed to a large commercial audience.  But it's a film that I am very confident recommending to just about anyone.  It's is REALLY wonderful.  A very sweet and enjoyable film that you don't hardly ever get to see anymore.  Anyone who is going through what the lead character is going through--and that's a lot of middle aged people--will enjoy this film and relate to it.  Saw it at a festival and the crowd was over the moon.  It won Audience Awards at several festivals because it's a crowd-pleaser.  So, no, you won't read about it in the arty-farty film magazines, and you won't recognize anyone in it, but don't let that stop you from checking it out. You'll be very happy you did.",1424563200,17,820,4.42
7002683,4,B00T73ANNK,"I wish they would make more movies like this. I saw this in theaters more than once, and it was a joy each time. You don't even have to be a musician to appreciate it (although it helps). This is a lovely, gentle -- but real -- film about people finding themselves.",1424390400,4,265,4.115384615384615

7002686,5,B00T73ANNK,"I had the opportunity to see this film in a theater. I really didn't know what it was about other than it being some sort of Mother/son story..... Let me tell you that the movie was pure cinematic fresh air! Great performances, fantastic music(I wish the soundtrack was available to buy), acting is excellent. I see a lot of movies, and what sets this apart from most is that everyone can identify with someone in this film, and when the movie ends you wish you could spend more time with these characters. Very few movies these day leave me with a desire to watch the film again, this was one of the few where I want to see it again.

So... What is it about? I saw it as a great family drama that focused on rediscovering your passion, being yourself, and finding a common thread to bond with your kid.
Roger Ebert once said that no great movie is ever long enough and no bad movie is ever short enough, Life Inide Out was not long enough!
Go see this movie!

I love the mother/ son relationship that builds as the movie moves through all while the mother is finding herself again.  It's got something to relate to for all.

This in itself gives us purpose yet we as mothers (as I'm a mother of two boys) we still are trying on our own accounts to ""find"" ourselves, our intended ""fulfilled"" purpose or maybe just trying to feel young again by inspiring to try new things or dig up some old dreams. I love how the movie brings the two together and the ending shines with true purpose.",1515801600,,547,4.5353535353535355
