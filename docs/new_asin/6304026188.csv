770257,4,6304026188,"REMEMBER WHEN JACKIE CHAN KICKED ASS? REMEMBER WHEN JACKIE CHAN WAS THE COOLEST MARTIAL ARTS STAR ALIVE? WELL, UNFORTUNATELY, THAT WAS BEFORE HE GOT OLDER AND BEFORE HE STARTED POPPING UP IN HORRIBLE MOVIES LIKE ''AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS'' AND ''SHANGHAI NOON''. IN THIS CLASSIC MARTIAL ARTS MOVIE FROM THE 1970S, JACKIE CHAN PLAYS A YOUNG MAN WHO'S CONSTANTLY HAUNTED BY THE FACT THAT HE WITNESSED HIS FATHER'S MURDER. AFTER LEARNING SEVERAL STYLES OF MARTIAL ARTS FROM SEVERAL DIFFERENT PEOPLE [INCLUDING A PRISONER WHOM HE BRINGS FOOD TO EVERYDAY IN EXCHANGE FOR KUNG FU LESSONS], HE SOON SETS OUT TO FIGHT THE WOODEN MEN AND AVENGE HIS FATHER'S MURDER. A VERY GOOD MARTIAL ARTS MOVIE THAT HAS MEMORABLE FIGHTS, WHICH'RE ALWAYS FUN TO LOOK AT. THE MOVIE'S WORTH IT ALONE FOR THE CLASSIC CONFRONTATION BETWEEN JACKIE CHAN AND THE WOODEN MEN.",1116201600,2,847,4.93006993006993
770258,4,6304026188,"I agree with the other reviewers who said the Columbia-Tristar veriosn cuts out so many good moments (what WERE they thinking!?!?!)!  I have the English dubbed version, and it's pretty good - I'd recommend it to all kung-fu movie-philes (and especially Chan-o-philes!).  The athletics are superb, although the film quality is not top-notch (it is, however, orders of magnitutde better than the ""pea-green"" situation with the Columbia release!!!!!!).  it IS one to enjoy!",1106092800,4,470,5.410958904109589
770259,5,6304026188,Jackie plays a young man who has vowed not to speak until he avenges the death of his father. In order to learn kung fu he goes to the Shaolin Temple where he finds work as a handyman. After some time the master takes pity on Jackie and starts to him on martial arts. But for a student to leave he must pass the ultimate test of the Wooden Men.,1037059200,2,344,3.9285714285714284
770260,2,6304026188,"Shaolin Wooden Men is my most favorite of Jackie Chan's early films. However, in my opinion the new Columbia/Tristar DVD version is such a terrible print of the film that I regret buying it. The entire upper 60% of the screen has a horrible pea green cast to it, making everyone look seasick. The contrast has been increased, presumably to 'remove' scratches, but this has darkened so much of the film that you can no longer see any detail in the woodwork of buildings, the shadows of trees, people's hair and faces, etc.

The worst part is this print is missing over 9 and a half minutes of opening footage that showed Jackie demonstrating the five Kung Fu disciplines used in the movie, as well as his first encounter with the wooden men, the opening overture and introductory scenes of Shaolin life.

The one redeeming thing about the Columbia/Tristar DVD version is that it is indeed true letterbox. As such you can truly see the full layout of the film as originally intended. The sound quality is also quite good, considering the age of the film. But despite, this is still the only instance where I've ever preferred a  Beverly Wilshire/Telefilms DVD version of a Jackie Chan film (fullscreen, scratches, video artifacts and all) to a remastered Columbia/Tristar DVD version. I am disappointed.",1032480000,28,1301,4.825112107623318
770261,3,6304026188,"This is good early Chan stuff. The acting is alittle slow, and sometimes typical of most kung fu flicks,but the wooden men scene and the last fight seen make Chan really stand out. I think that it is worth watching once and could be fun to watch with friends on a boring weekend.",1021248000,,279,4.283018867924528
770262,2,6304026188,"I own this movie but can honestly say I've only watched it once!
I can't put much rating on a movie which put me to sleep.
Jackie evidently had a little time on his hands to make this
movie.  And I do repeat a ""little"" time on his hands.  Not much
action,  too much plot.  Yawn, Yawn!!  Budget film at its worst!",1020643200,,312,3.967741935483871
770263,4,6304026188,"Shaolin Wooden Men is one of Jackie's best movies ever. Second only to Drunken Master 1 & 2, Snake in the eagle's shadow and snake and crane. This movie has some great pue kung-fu. And has all the makings of a great old school kung-fu movie. Also has one of the best lines in kung-fu history ""Your kung-fu is poor, you should go back there and practice some more"" CLASSIC!
The story line is simple but good and the final fight scene is brilliant. This one is out of print and hard to find on dvd, but if you come across it don't hesitate to pick it up. Pure genious.
4 1/2 stars!!!",1017705600,,581,4.150442477876106
770264,4,6304026188,"One of Jackie Chans better demonstrations of various martial skills.  The movie is 25 years old, come on it's not going to look brand new, but the story is good, and the myriad of kung fu demonstrations and styles is glorious.  Definitely worth the purchase if you are into kung fu movies!!!",1011139200,,291,4.576923076923077
770265,4,6304026188,"This movie is worth buying. Jackie is very young.  The beginning is typical Shaolin training, which was interesting to me. The plot is creative. There are some cheesy parts -like when Jackie meneuvers nimbly in  a pool of lard without slipping. The plot twists ironically into an almost  sad conclusion (but again a little cheesy). I would recommend it for no  more than ten bucks.",953596800,,381,4.815384615384615
7860398,4,6304026188,"The martial arts is too traditional in this film. That's why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. The wooden men fight scene is probably, the best part of the film!",1501804800,,155,3.875

7860402,3,6304026188,my customer was very happy to get this movie for a decent price. Too bad I had to double ship it (and therefore double price on shipping) to get it where it needed to go.,1364428800,,170,3.8857142857142857
7860403,5,6304026188,"Young Jackie Chan doing real Gung-Fu, what more can I say.

Some versions of this film have an openning with him demonstrating the animal forms for the monks. Some don't have it because there aren't too many copies of the original film that aren't damaged. If you can find the original with this footage it is worth it. Good Fights and not too much clowning around. Nobody Flies through the air and there aren't any special effects. It is old school from the 70s.",1358812800,,463,4.511904761904762

7860405,5,6304026188,"We are great watchers of Kung Fu films at our house, and for the longest time my husband raved about Shaolin Wooden Men but couldn't find a decent copy of it on DVD.  So, when I saw a new, unopened version of it here, I snagged it.  And I'm glad I did.

The version that I purchased was distributed by the Bonzai Media Corporation out of Taipei, rather than an American studio, and was completely uncut.  It has the opening demonstration footage of the different Kung Fu styles and it does NOT have the funky green colorcast that some of the other reviews mention.  In fact, when we finished watching it, my husband commented on how good the picture quality was.

Then, there's the movie.  This is the Kung Fu film at its finest.  I think a lot of people discredit Jackie Chan's abilities because he's in so many family friendly comedies.  Those people need to watch this film to truly see what a martial arts genius he is.  Beyond that, the story line is compelling and fits the classic Kung Fu mode (you killed my father/master).  It avoids a lot of the visual tricks and sound effects used in other Kung Fu films at the time, and there's no insipid love story to get in the way of Jackie's mission.  And the fight scene with the wooden men is just awesome.

The thing about this movie is that so many other films--martial arts and otherwise--make reference to it.  After watching it, so many other movies I've seen simply made so much more sense!  It would be untrue to say this is the ""original"" kung fu film, since so many came before it...but I don't think it would be a stretch to say that it is absolutely still one of the best.",1233273600,,1636,4.370860927152318
7860406,4,6304026188,"This is a very early movie from 1976, only the second starring role of his career. Although he doesn't get to speak until the very end it is a neat movie to add to your Jackie Chan collection. He is very young here, and you can see how his eyes looked before he had plastic surgery to 'open' them up. There isn't a whole lot of action here, but Jackie does get to showcase his skills and strength. There is a great sequence in which Jackie has to utilize all of his skills to get through an intricate series of tests against wooden 'men'.",1230422400,,538,4.1826923076923075
7860407,4,6304026188,"Shaolin Wooden Men was the second film Jackie Chan did for Lo Wei Productions and the first film he did under director Chen Chi-Hwa (who also directed Jackie in Half a Loaf of Kung Fu) - though Lo would get Supervising Director credit. Chan was lent out to this up-and-coming director who would give him more room to experiment. Jackie gave more effort on his martial art styles by mutating traditional forms like the snake form (one of Jackie's favorites) giving more flowing and flamboyant movement and being less classical in structure. Unfortunately, he did not have much say in his character development with a character that was still in Bruce Lee's shadow. Shaolin Wooden Men was considered the second flop in a row for a Jackie Chan led film.

Jackie played a mute young man (called Dummy in the dubbed version) whose father She Lan was killed by an unknown assailant. I've read a couple of different rumors on why Chan was mute in this film: to make it easier on him acting and the other rumor was that Lo did not have confidence in his acting skill. Jackie's character has sworn revenge and to increase his martial artist skills he becomes an earnest student in a Shaolin monastery. He has trouble at first adjusting to monk life. Such activities as using lead shoes to carry water up and pour in barrels and chopping wood was difficult for the mute but he would note be prevented from learning Shaolin martial arts. It would normally take five years of this training before he could start on his fighting training, but the mute was crafty. He learned balance techniques from a drunken monk (Miu Tak San). He befriended a visiting female Buddhist named Nun Woo Mei (Cheung Bing Yuk) who taught him ""Ten Shadows Eight Steps"" to make him lighter on his feet. Several scenes of this technique reminded me of several of Missy Elliot's videos.

In order to leave the Shaolin monastery Jackie would have to pass a test of fighting. He would have to go through a gauntlet of mechanized Wooden Men (strangely looking like a Monty Python gag) that many monks with more advanced training that the mute have failed. The mute was lucky in finding a Shaolin prisoner who befriended him and in exchange for food and wine would train him. Fa Yu (Kam Kong) is a curmudgeon character who says he is only captured until he learns ""The Lion's Roar"" which will shatter the internals of his enemies (or at least provide a cheesy sound effect.) He taught the mute several techniques which would help him pass the gauntlet as well as improve his fighting prowess.

The Shaolin Wooden Men only play a small part of this film. The mute inevitably passes the test and burns the dragon and tiger insignias into his forearms by lifting a searing hot cauldron that marks the opening into freedom and the beginning of his travails. First he must deliver a message from Fa Yu to a gimpy pharmacologist who owns the Tsun Chung Pharmacy in the town of Ching Ho who is part of the Green Dragon and White Tiger gangs. This pretty much establishes Fa Yu with those gangs and the rest of the film deals with the (other) inevitable aspects of his escape and why he was imprisoned by the Shaolin.

The martial arts are above standard, but not as good as the later Jackie Chan films. Though the final fight sequence does last awhile and is the highlight fight of the film. The plot is a martial art clich with a student enrolling in a Shaolin Academy to learn Kung Fu to avenge the death of his father. There is also the ubiquitous training manual ""Justice against the Devil"" given to Jackie by a blind monk. However, the relationship between the mute and his teacher Fa Yu is an interesting angle reminding me of the relationship of Yuen Biao and Lau Kar Wing in Knockabout. Chan seems a little unsure of his acting ability, even without voice, but he always looks professional with the martial art choreography. I think most people will like the later Jackie Chan films better, but if you find a decent copy of this film they will think it is a decent film -- though not much better. Note: look for an early small speaking role for Yuen Biao.

DVD Info: Choosing the right copy is also important. I own two different copies of the film both with their own problems. The Columbia copy reigns in about 96 minutes though it misses 10 minutes of the beginning. These ten minutes are very fun to watch. It includes the ""showcase"" beginning with Jackie fighting four monks each with a different animal style. It then includes his character having a nightmare dealing with the Shaolin Python Wooden Men and then a sequence showing normal life at the Shaolin temple. The Columbia version is also cropped to a 1.78 aspect. The line on the DVD about preserving the original aspect is hooey. The benefit of this DVD is that it has the Mandarin soundtrack and good subtitles. The second version I own is the Telefilms Internation DVD (also R1 and also hooey about being the Original Uncut Version) which has the original aspect, a more clear screen and the beginning that is missing in the Columbia version. This version is missing ten minutes that are in the Columbia version though it cost me only two dollars. It is missing any extras like subtitles or other languages. So the best thing to do is look for a copy that has 106 minutes or over, is not cropped and is not R1.",1161820800,,5335,4.5821989528795815
