Spanish singer Raphael worked under the direction of Mario Camus in three films. ""Cuando T&uacute; No Estas"" is the first of them.  The plot is straightforward.  A young and unknown singer, Raphael, moves to Madrid in search of recognition and stardom.  He soon realizes that voice alone is not going to take him to the top of the charts.  With the help of an agent, he surrounds himself with a marketing expert and a composer. Most of the movie is spent on how the four of them create Raphael's new artistic and public persona.  While Raphael and the composer work on writing the one hit song that is going to give him his big break, Raphael meets and falls in love with Laura, a beautiful woman who proves to be both mysterious and elusive.

The action of this musical drama moves slowly at times.  Also, the lack of chemistry between Raphael and the actress who plays Laura made it difficult for me to believe that a profound love could have existed between their characters.  However, if you're a true fan of Raphael, you may overlook these flaws because the film features superb songs by Manuel Alejandro. Among them, the title song, ""Cuando T&uacute; No Estas""; Raphael's signature song ""Yo Soy Aquel""; ""Desde Aquel D&iacute;a"" and ""Estuve Enamorado.""

In spite of the music, ""Cuando T&uacute; No Estas"" is not the feel-good type of movie that Raphael's compatriots such as Roc&iacute;o D&uacute;rcal and Marisol were making at the time.  But watching Raphael perform so many great songs was worth enduring the bitter sweetness of the film.  When I finished watching the movie, I forgot about it. But I kept humming ""Cuando T&uacute; No Estas"" for a week.",1241827200,,1807,4.756410256410256
