6554626,5,B00M35UW9Y,Newbie to yoga so this is a good place for me to start. Lillias takes her time to explain what you're going to do and does it.,1423008000,15,126,3.7037037037037037
6554627,2,B00M35UW9Y,"I am probably the same age as Lilias and used to watch her on tv. When I was young I taught yoga but having gotten caught up in a career I let it fall by the wayside unfortunately. I am recovering from cancer and surgery and so was looking for a ""senior"" yoga DVD to help me get back into the swing of things. This DVD says it is for beginners and seniors. I remembered Lilias and so I bought it.  For me this is like physical therapy and must be approached carefully as my abdominal surgery left me very tight and though I had some flexibility left I was dealing with pain and stiffness after my ordeal. If you want a truly beginner DVD don't get this one even though it says beginner and senior. It is nothing of the kind. I strained by back right away trying to do these difficult poses right off the bat without any warm up. I think she just wanted to  show off her flexibility at her age, and I found it annoying the way she kept tugging down her t shirt that was too short anyway to do yoga in. Very dissapointing DVD for beginners. Next I bought Peggy Cappy's ""yoga for the rest of us for pain"" . It is wonderful and will not hurt you. She truly gets what a senior is and how to get you there without hurting you. When I get my flexibility back I may try this DVD again but my thumbs are arthritic and there is too much time spent on the floor. Many seniors cannot even get on the floor. Peggy's DVD uses a chair and goes very easy on you to get you feeling better in no time. So unless you are a seasoned yoga practicer, I suggest you skip this one.",1468195200,27,1557,4.035598705501618
6554628,5,B00M35UW9Y,This is a wonderful yoga program. I just started it this week and am already getting stronger and my balance has improved. I intend to do this daily for the rest of my life.,1463961600,2,173,4.117647058823529

6554630,5,B00M35UW9Y,This is a good video easy to follow and relaxing I plan on buying other video by Lilia,1461801600,6,86,3.8333333333333335
6554631,4,B00M35UW9Y,I often have trouble finding a good balance in yoga DVDs - either too hard or too easy - and it is difficult to tell before.buying and viewing. I feel that this one is a bit challenging for a beginner who is not young and athletic. I do like Lilias' instructions for Sun Salutation so that is what I will use this DVD for. She is also very careful to give specific guidance on the proper form to help prevent injuries.,1461369600,22,418,4.172839506172839
6554632,5,B00M35UW9Y,Her instruction is simple and she takes her time so it is easy to change from one pose to the next. Also moves body parts to increase range of motion and strength.,1461369600,5,163,4.125

6554636,5,B00M35UW9Y,"This is an excellent yoga video. Lilias gives very good instruction and modifications...it's not too slow.
Her voice is wonderful for meditation/relaxation practice.
You can choose how long you want to workout and there is an excellent Sun Salutation workout.
I will get more of her videos on DVD. (My previous ones of hers were on VHS from years ago!!)",1425686400,21,353,4.9

8669968,2,B00M35UW9Y,Was a bit disappointed with this program.  It said it was for beginners but too advanced for me!,1518134400,,96,4.333333333333333

8669971,5,B00M35UW9Y,"I very much enjoy this video.  I have been taking yoga classes with a pro, and when I can't make them I use this video to fill in on the down time.  Lilias takes it slow and is very careful to describe the poses and what you should do and not do. This would be a good video for seniors and others who  want to at least do basic poses that give great benefits. What I especially like is the audio version which is very descriptive so that you don't have to look up to watch the pose if you are on your back or if you only have audio available.",1502496000,3,542,3.864864864864865
8669972,5,B00M35UW9Y,A gentle way for beginning yogis to enter the practice.,1490572800,,55,4.6
8669973,4,B00M35UW9Y,A good workout for strength. At first a little vigorous but has gotten easier with practice. I like it!,1489795200,2,103,4.473684210526316
8669974,2,B00M35UW9Y,"I saw ""Beginners"" in the title, which I am, but i'm also a senior citizen with a knee replacement, so this DVD did not work out for me.  Oh well, my loss.",1485907200,4,154,3.8125
8669975,4,B00M35UW9Y,At 61 I really like this tape,1476230400,2,29,3.2857142857142856
