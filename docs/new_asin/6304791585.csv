935048,1,6304791585,Poor video quality and below par all the way around. Elke Sommer can not save this. No amount of time can be justified to see this.,1389830400,,131,4.076923076923077
935049,4,6304791585,"A beautiful fashion model named Daniella (Elke Sommer- LISA AND THE DEVIL) travels from Munich to Rome for her big break. Another model has been killed, leaving a spot open for Daniella to fill. Of course, this isn't just a film about modeling, so Daniella is quickly caught up in a world of blackmail, espionage, and murder. DANIELLA BY NIGHT is a French thriller from 1962. Ms. Sommer is in almost every scene, and she's great! Yes, there is a nude Elke scene, but it's tame and mostly shot through a thin curtain. I especially enjoyed the jazzy soundtrack, as well as the recurring song ""Oh, Daniella!"". Great fun!...",1387152000,3,620,4.697247706422019

Film scratches, extreme contrast and low resolution
make this Elke Sommer classic difficult to watch.",1196899200,3,161,5.48
935051,4,6304791585,"Beautiful and cute Elke, I enjoyed the movies very much.

But I am greatly disappointed to see that the most inportant scene of strip tease cut off,the picture on the movie's package.",1179792000,9,183,4.71875
935052,3,6304791585,"This performance, the last by Ms. Elke Sommer, supposedly before she did films outside of Europe, has a moderately interesting story, where Ms. Sommer plays a fashion model caught up in a murder and some intrigue in Europe.  It has one brief, all too brief, scene, of some topless women and a brief bit of breast, and some bottom, shown by Ms. Sommer, which, I guess, for 1962, was pretty revealing, but less than promised.  (...)  She's cute, but not worth more than what I payed for it (...).",1066089600,24,494,4.52808988764045
935053,1,6304791585,"The opening title sequence is cut in half--enough said.  Not a good transfer.  In my opinion, this is one of the worst film transfers my eyes have ever seen.  Wait for another transfer of Daniella By Night to come out at some point, and then purchase it.",1055894400,17,254,4.361702127659575
