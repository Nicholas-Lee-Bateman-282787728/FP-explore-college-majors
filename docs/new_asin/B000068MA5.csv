8280699,5,B000068MA5,if you have never seen better man that you should definetely see it. It is one of the most unusal series you may ever see but at the same time it is one of the best it may seem at first that the plot does not flow well but at the end it really comes togther so pick this up (if you dare)j\k,1048377600,,290,3.619047619047619
