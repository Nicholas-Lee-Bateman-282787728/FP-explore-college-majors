5014452,5,B006QVRW80,"A wonderful documentary! Goes for years, is very interesting to see how a young occidental man embraces his family cultural backgrounds.",1366243200,4,136,5.523809523809524
5014453,5,B006QVRW80,One documentary you can see more than once and discover more each time. Namkai Norbu Rimpoche and his son Yeshi are seen through the years in the eyes of one quiet observer who puts the story together for you to elicit the lessons in between the lines.,1363046400,6,252,4.382978723404255
5014454,5,B006QVRW80,This film was brilliantly done. It let life speak for itself and was a wonderful statement about Buddhism as well as the dynamics between father and son. I would totally recommend this film,1360368000,5,189,4.757575757575758
5014455,5,B006QVRW80,"I . wanted to understand how a father with deep commitment to a tradition with sacred duties could allow his son to find his own true way.  you could imagine this story in he contexts of any traditional belief system, not just one of reincarnated teachers

 I found the father's statement that he did not want to ""condition""  his son's mind very moving.  The respectful adaptations to the wife's culture were also admirable.

many lessons very worthwhile",1358208000,4,454,4.8311688311688314
5014456,5,B006QVRW80,Good movie. I love documentaries and I have always wondered what the children of gurus think of their parent(s). It gave greater incite into the life of the Master personal life.,1352764800,3,178,4.774193548387097
5014457,5,B006QVRW80,"This documentary is fascinating.  At first glance, I wasn't sure if it would be interesting or enjoyable, but it turned out to be both things.  When the movie ended I felt like I wanted more, that I wasn't ready for it to be over.  Anyone interested in reincarnation should check it out.",1351296000,3,287,4.480769230769231
5014458,5,B006QVRW80,This was a fascinating inside view on the life of a man who is considered a spiritual master and his son in the tradition of Tibetan Buddhism (which encompasses Dream Yoga). It shows the human side of the man and how people put him up on an unrealistic pedestal. It also shows the son struggling with his birthrights from his father and his birthrights through reincarnation as a spiritual master himself. Fascinating is not a strong enough word to describe this documentary.,1350777600,9,475,4.804878048780488
5014459,4,B006QVRW80,"Dzogzen practitioners will find this DVD story about one of the greatest masters, Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche, and his son, about the realities of life, relationships and choices quite amazing.",1345248000,3,188,5.517241379310345
5014460,5,B006QVRW80,"But, even though life unfolds naturally, even beautifully, that doesn't mean it will be easy....

This documentary is perhaps the very best of many I have seen about Buddhism, and Tibetan culture and dharma. The documentary aspect is like being a fly on the wall of Namkhai Norbu's family's life, and especially his son Yeshi's, over a period of 20 years. And the content is very real and honest and uncontrived. It reminded me of times I've spent living with and around Lamas, the little lessons, the expectations and frustrations. And this is what living (and practicing dharma) is really all about.

What I like about this movie is that it shows the dilemma of living our individual lives, our individual destinies. The dilemma of not forcing the unfolding, not pushing or expecting it to go a certain way. The dilemma of honoring the past without repeating it's mistakes.

In this case the son, although identified as the reincarnation of an important lama (his father's main teacher in fact!), rejected the identity and role of a traditional master (such as embodied in his father's life), and instead pursued his own path of a normal secular Italian. The irony is that eventually he came to know himself better (from the inside out), and what he learned about being a normal modern father, husband and business man became just what was needed for the spiritual community his father had built up, and for his past life's followers inTibet.

The effect is we get a glimpse of the practice of dharma with enough specific dzogchen teachings - verbal and simply through example - to point out what is essential (recognition and appreciation of impermanence and the natural, effortless observation of our condition). And this is applicable for all of us, no matter what our nationality, spiritual views, or maturity. What is revealed is not so much the content, but the process of awakening.

This is thus a interesting story of Namkhai Norbu and Yeshi's specific paths, as well as a simple reminder for each of us about ours.",1345075200,27,2026,4.860869565217391

5014465,5,B006QVRW80,More than anything an interesting father-son relationship with small enlightenments appearing all the time. No big bang awakening which seems like normal life even given the circumstances of them both.,1408752000,2,201,5.733333333333333

5014470,5,B006QVRW80,"I really liked this movie and I keep remembering parts of it days later.
It is very unique in that the family was filmed over many years and all the footage is real... even when Yeshi was young.
It is beautiful to see his journey and how his spirituality developed. It is very special to be able to see day to day life of a spiritual leader and his family. I loved hearing Riponche's sense of responsibility and his Faith. I loved seeing how he interacted with his son Yeshi. I loved seeing the companionship of his wife. What a beautiful movie to look and think about how to live a more spiritual life in a real world. It was a bonus to see the shot with the Dalain Lama and his playfulness. Very inspiring.",1403568000,2,708,4.2518518518518515
5014471,5,B006QVRW80,"This film is a grounding portrayal of two prominent Tibetan masters. A position shrouded by mystery and supernatural expectations. In this film we see the potential of the art of Dzogchen and Tibetan culturE,  and the struggle to follow the path we are given. The heroines do embody incredible spaciousness, equanimity, compassion, and patience at times . A state that all can achieve, however and at other times there is struggle that we can relate to. the misconceptions and the actual reality of Tibetan Dzogchen masters are told here and unfold as a wonderful truth in the end. While many elements of these great men and masters of a living art do indeed seem magical they are simply the down to earth human potential we all posess .  Watch the relative and the beyond coexist",1399075200,2,780,4.770370370370371
5014472,5,B006QVRW80,"for me, it addressed some personal obstacles that I want to resolve. Learning about others always expands my narrow view.",1391212800,3,121,5.1

5014474,5,B006QVRW80,"First off, I am a fan of documentaries.  I am also extremely interested in different cultures and religions and particularly Buddhism.  So in that regard, my opinion is probably swayed.  But having said that, I thought this film was wonderful.  Interesting, well done, the individual personalities were engaging.  I learned from and enjoyed the film very much.  It pushed my wanting to know more about Buddhism further.  Left me with a positive feeling.  The Buddhist exhibit such compassion, really touches me.  I will definitely watch again from time to time.",1388880000,2,561,5.144444444444445
5014475,5,B006QVRW80,"I highly recommend this movie. I love how the father gave his son the freedom to make his own choices in life regarding what is most important. Aside from getting a unique look at an exiled Tibetan's story, and how his son fared in the spiritual community as well, this tale subtly speaks to our own individual hearts as well.",1388275200,2,326,4.45
5014476,4,B006QVRW80,Well made film about a son of a spiritual leader who struggles with his own views of reincarnation and his relation with his father,1382572800,,131,4.5
5014477,5,B006QVRW80,it's uncommon the chance to watch such amazing realization: the life of a young lama raised in a western culture sharing his difficult relationship with his father - a recognized tibetan master- and the end... well... you have to see it!,1375142400,3,237,4.804878048780488
5014478,4,B006QVRW80,Good story if you are already familiar with Buddhist traditions. Doesn't give much background info about the history and theory behind Buddhist reincarnation beliefs and practices.,1370995200,4,180,5.961538461538462
5014479,5,B006QVRW80,This film provides an amazing glimpse into the Tibetan Buddhist world as well as into the subtler aspects of reincarnation. A great double feature would be MY REINCARNATION and UNMISTAKEN CHILD. Om Mani Peme Hung,1368489600,2,212,5.085714285714285
5014480,5,B006QVRW80,"I found this documentary to be very engrossing, and extremely well made. The subject, while ostensibly about the life of the son of one of the great Tibetan masters teaching in the West (and reincarnation of another master in Tibet), is very much of interested to any Westerner with a strong connection to the Buddha dharma. It reveals the difficulties of juggling family responsibilities, job, etc. with one's spiritual search. The subject, Yeshi, is spiritually mature, and offers many insights which I found very useful. The issues surrounding reincarnation are also quite applicable in a larger sense to anyone who is drawn, for almost inexplicable reasons, to spiritual practice-something generally not encouraged in the West, and likely the result of prior causes and conditions. Similarly, the theme of one's responsibilities: to the Dharma, and one's teachers and fellow Dharma students, and spiritual integrity, while seeming to be pulled in other directions, is also of great interest. I recently had the chance to compare this documentary with another one made by ChogamTrungpa's son, and called Tulku, and found this one to be much more interesting and have much more depth. I highly recommend My Reincarnation.",1367107200,8,1223,5.309278350515464

8503378,5,B006QVRW80,"This is an extraordinary account documented over 20 years of the relationship between a father and a son, an exploration of the Tibetan culture and diaspora, and the story of a reluctant spiritual teacher slowly accepting his role. If you are looking for mainstream cinema this is not it; the pace is slow, but the filmmaker has astonishing access to the most intimate moments of this relationship. It is moving and beautiful and utterly unique.",1465171200,,445,4.946666666666666
