2169826,5,B000667HDG,"I originally saw this animated series on the BBC a few years ago when they broadcast all of the episodes. At the time I found it to be very funny and I am glad to see that over time it still hasn't lost its charm.

I'm not surprised that over in the USA this programme was pulled after only a few episodes. A great shame. I bet those individuals who campaigned for its removal never watched it at all.

I wonder have they ever shown The Vicar if Dibley in the US?

2169827,4,B000667HDG,"It's the age old story.  God's tired and ready to give up on us, but just at the last minute decides he'll give the world a break.  He says if one human can convince Him the world is worth saving, he'll not destroy us.  Being a sporting God, he decides to let the Devil pick who the one human is.  So, Satan picks Bob:  inconsiderate, beer drinking, porn watching Bob.  The show is pretty funny starting out, but it slides downhill pretty quickly.  God is generally hard to understand and obtuse in his meanings.  The Devil is petulent and constantly wanting God's attention.  In the middle, Bob tries to do right when his instincts so much want wrong things.  The first DVD is a hoot, but the episodes get old and stale pretty quickly. Acting is for the most part reading the lines. There's not a whole lot of variation in James Garner's delivery of God.  The Devil comes off as just being kind of spoiled and not particularly evil at all.  I'm glad I rented this one rather than buying.",1110153600,9,988,4.397790055248619
2169828,5,B000667HDG,"I truly enjoyed this series.  I liked it because they

took the very important subject of God and his presence in our lives.  It also

presented Biblical principals in a clear and funny way.

For example, it is a sin to pity oneself.

The devil

in this series has one pity party after another.

God asks us to just trust him, not be whining and

complaining, he wants us to enjoy life.  So you get a few

bumps, get over it and get on with working for the Lord,

loving his people.  The character Bob is a self serving

man who wants to change, but is hung up on his earthly

tendencies - swearing, drinking, being angry - we all can relate to that.  Throughout the series, God gently leads

him away from that - like going to bars when he

should be spending time with his family,  God shows

him how much better his life is when treasuring the gift

of a wife and children.

On and on I could go with this, but

what I'd really like to say is, give it a try.

I think you'll like it and perhaps if you aren't

reading the Bible right now and enjoying God's presence

in your life, you may just invite him in.  Life

is awesome when you recognize God's presence and

his love for you.",1107993600,9,1186,4.101321585903084
2169829,3,B000667HDG,"I had never heard of this series before but saw an advertisement for it with my King of the Hill DVD set.  I like animated shows, and this one sounded intriguing, so I decided to try it out.  The premise of the series is that God (voiced by James Garner) is tired of the poor state of the world and contemplates destroying it and starting anew.  The devil (voiced by Alan Cumming) is excited by the news but is disappointed when God begins to reconsider.  God decides to make a wager with the devil.  If the person of the devil's choosing cannot prove to God that the world is worth saving, he'll destroy it.  The devil chooses Detroit factory worker Bob Alman (I guess, he is to represent ALL of MANkind) voiced by Third Rock's French Stewart.  On the surface, it seems like a good choice from the devil's standpoint, as Alman is a beer guzzling, self-centered, porno-watching jokester.  As we get to know Bob better, however, he turns out to be a devoted family man.  His wife (Rosanne's Laurie Metcalf) is self-centered and his bratty daughter (Lisa Simpson's Nancy Cartwright) is impossible but he does have a warm, caring son who believes in him.

The series starts off very slow.  It does not have the in-your-face humor of Family Guy, the endless jokes of The Simpsons and, despite its theme, does not cover as controversial of issues as South Park.  Many of the topics are rather mundane. The acting also seems a bit flat. Although, for the most part, this show is tame, religious groups did not like it (probably not even watching it) and it was canceled after airing only a handful of its shows.  The show, however, does improve as the series evolves. The characters who, at first, seemed stale to me become more interesting in the later episodes. God is presented as a laid back, hippy, professor type who never gives his pupils a straight answer.  The devil's sidekick Smeck (who reminds me of Bill in King of the Hill) seemed annoying to me at first but later provides fresh and genuine comedy to the show.  Briefly, here are the episodes:

1. In the Beginning: The premise is established and Bob, unintentionally, stumbles upon what God is looking for.
2. Andy Runs Away: Bob's son runs away after Bob embarrasses him in front of his friends.  Not much profound in this episode.
3. Date from Hell: Bob becomes chums with his daughter's first boyfriend, until he discovers who he really is.  One of the best God lines: ""Girls are tough, that's why I never had a daughter.""
4. The devil's Birthday: Martha Stewart helps the devil reorganize hell while Bob discovers how overrated a world without evil is.  The devil being hurt that God forgot his birthday is just silly.
5. Neighbor's Keeper: God's new mission for Bob is to save his neighbor's marriage, while the devil tries to get Bob to commit adultery.  At the bowling alley, we discover that the devil's team is sponsored by Microsoft.
6.  God's Favorite:  Thinking he is God's ""special guy"" has gone to Bob's head.
7. Bob Get Committed:  Bob is put in an asylum while the devil takes his place, and then falls in love with Bob's wife.

The show starts improving on disc 2:
8. Lonely at the Top: God decides to find out what it is like to live in the real world and joins Bob's factory crew and softball team.  This show is very funny, especially the devil's attempt to create his first flower.
9. Bob Gets Greedy: Bob's mission to do charity work gets put on the back burner when the devil leaves his palm pilot at Bob's house that reveals future sports scores.  The ending is over-the-top, though.
10. There's Too Much Sex on TV: The title tells you what Bob's mission is, and he inadvertently succeeds beyond his wildest dreams.  This episode may be a little edgy for the kids.
11. Bob's Father:  Definitely the best of the bunch.  Bob's bullying father dies and Bob is shocked where his father ends up.  The idea about a father giving a ""softer punch"" is interesting.  If there is one GD&B episode that can promote enlightening tabletalk, this is it.
12.  God's Girlfriend:  Elizabeth Taylor voices a woman who God almost considers dating.  The most controversial of the episodes, theological consultant Father Kieser chose not to advise this one.
13. Bob Gets Involved: Bob puts together a group to fight society's ills but butts heads with his wife when he gets her play canceled.  Smeck in drag is hilarious.  The ending is terrible, but here's another source for your 6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon games.  The moral: progress begins at home.

The extras include a few commentaries that are insightful (we're shown that photographs were used in the animation), a ""Making Of"" special covering the art, voices, and controversy with remarks by creator Matthew Carlson and executive producer Harvey Myman, plus some silly interviews with God, the devil, and Bob.  While this series was a bit slow, in the end, it showed that it had potential.  Too little too late, I'm afraid.  If you like animation and want to see something less in-your-face, I recommend giving it a shot but don't expect any divine revelation.",1106438400,14,5079,4.6617977528089884
2169830,5,B000667HDG,"Someone here writes that this show wasn't as good as ""South Park"" and ""Family Guy"". So my answer is ""how many years did South Park and Family Guy get to develop as a series?"" This show should have been aired on Fox late or Comedy Central. It possibly would have survived. Since the Bundy's we've allowed Fox and Comedy Central to do whatever they want, without crossing the ""R"" line. It's a shame that this show couldn't have been saved by another network.

My son was 14 at the time it originally aired. He was in confirmation class and hated it. G/D/B was a conversation opener for us to discuss the business of the Lord. In my house we are not holier than thou. We do believe in God and many aspects of the Christian religion but with an open mind and heart. When our son showed total disdain for the Christian religion, it hurt. When this show came to us, it was God-sent. A way to discuss religion without an arguement or slammed doors. God, The Devil and Bob opened communication to areas we never thought possible. Then the network shut it down. THAT brought more conversations about people's fears and big business decisions. NBC inadvertantly taught my son about things I could never get across to him; disappointment in tv decisions and small minds.

Approximately four years later, I was one of the many proud new owners of the ""God,The Devil and Bob"" dvd. My family has been savoring it by watching only two or three episodes at a time. We've been trying to watch it together and not get ahead-too much. I can forget my problems and just throw myself into this show. I'm laughing and searching my soul all at once. My favorite episode, that had me sobbing, was ""Bob's Father"". I lost my mom 8 years ago and it still hurts.

My college student son is more of a cynic when it comes to religion than the 14 year old who hated to learn or talk about it. (The irony of life: he now attends a Catholic College that requires him to take religion.) The outstanding quality that he possesses that I am very proud of is his ability to feel another person's pain and to be there for them. Isn't that what life's about? Wasn't that what ""God, the Devil and Bob"" was about?",1105747200,7,2172,4.425
2169831,5,B000667HDG,"I actually saw this show when it originally aired on NBC (well, the 4 episodes that aired).  I was very disapointed that the show got cancelled, but I did tape 3 of the 4 episodes, and later obtained a tape of the first episode that I didn't record.

Now I have bought this DVD set of all 13 episodes, and I am thrilled to have it.  It is sad that this show didn't make it.  I think it is just as funny, if not more so, than The Simpsons and Family Guy.

In a nut shell, the plot is that God if tired of the direction that man kind is heading in, and is thinking about destorying the universe and starting over.  But he decided that if one man could prove it is worth saving, he would spare it.  He lets the Devil choose that man, who ends up being Bob.  It is a very entertaining show.  I particularly recommend the 4th episode in which the Devil hires Martha Stewart to redecorate his place of origin, and she ends up taking the place over.

Not that it really matters, but there is a sticker on the outside of the shrinkwrap that says it contains 10 unaried episodes, when in reality 9 of them didn't air (4 episodes aired, 13-4=9).  Either way, all 13 episodes that were made are on it, so it makes mo real difference.

The only real negative, in my opinion, is that the theme music is different than when it originally aired.  If you get this dvd set, you will notice that the various parts of the title ""God, the Devil, and Bob"" are bouncing around during the opening title sequence to some instrumental music.  Originally, there were lyrics to that music in which they would sing the title of the show (i.e. when the word ""God"" is in the middle of the screen, they would be singing that part of the title, etc).  I know its not a big deal, but that opening theme really sort of set the mood of the show, and for someone who hasn't seen it before, the words bouncing around seem kind of random and pointless without the lyrics to go with it.
***EDIT: Prior to writing this review, I had not watched the second disc in its entirety, and discovered that the original theme song is on the 12th episode.***

Sorry about the little rant about the theme, just something I noticed that was disapointing.  But the episodes themselves are intact, and that is what really matters.  I highly recommend checking this out.",1104883200,15,2315,4.30715935334873
2169832,5,B000667HDG,"Back in 1999, the producer of 'God, the Devil and Bob' rescued me, and a bevy of artists from Klasky-Csupo's 'Rocket Power' by calling to ask if we would be interested in working on this show.  We lept at it, and began serious careers.

While I directed on this show I was amazed to meet a person who still stands out to me as the most professional and gifted writer/creator I ever had the pleasure to work with; Matthew Carlson.  While the show suffered from a number of problems, it was held together by a core of very dedicated people like Matthew, Carsey & Warner, Margot Pipkin and Jeff DeGrandis.  By the end of the series, everyone believed we had made a very good family sitcom, with a core of excellent writing and acting.  Unfortunately it was met with middle of the road ratings, legal troubles and finally, religious activists.  4 episodes were shown on NBC in 2000 before it was torn off the channel.

The crew, from producer down, always felt the design choice for the characters was a mistake, seriously hindering the ability to animate and express fully.  But, there is a kind of scratchy charm at the best of times.  My favorite episode was 'Bobs Father'.  Pity it was never shown on prime time.

As GDB ended, I was asked to direct and produce 'Invader Zim' where I took a good number of the GDB crew in order to do something very different with far more technical aspects.  But, GDB still stands as the best experience with writer/creators, writing, and producers in the business.",1102204800,67,1499,4.573033707865169

Bob has been chosen by the devil to either save or destroy mankind through his actions.  Many times all three hang out & party together making it even more difficult for Bob to choose wisely & act accordingly.  Somehow it always works out for the best & the three continue on their separate ways until the next episode/test.

A short-lived series, to be sure, but ""God, The Devil and Bob"" was a well-written, keenly animated series nonetheless, featuring the voice talents of James Garner (""The Rockford Files"") as God, Alan Cumming (""X2: X-Men United"") as The Devil, French Stewart (""3rd Rock From the Sun"") as our ""savior"" Bob Alman, Laurie Metcalf (""Roseanne"") as his wife Donna, Nancy Cartwright (""The Simpsons"") as daughter Megan, and Kath Soucie (""Rugrats"") as son Andy.

2169856,5,B000667HDG,"Finally this amazing show is on DVD. I really don't understand why this show was cancelled after airing only a few episodes. It truly is a shame. We all know it was from the pressures from the Christian groups, but I am very doubtful that any of them even watched it. I always thought this show was a great platform to get people actually talking about Christianity. It involves the main character Bob's personal relationship with God. God is shown to him in the guise of an average person. Bob learns through the series that selflessness and having strong bonds with your family is what God want's for humanity. There is no hidden agenda to the show, Bob is a total slob, drinks alcohol and watches too much 'soft core' porn at least in the form of really bad made for TV movies. But throughout the series he is forced to look closer at his life and people around him. He does take huge strides towards bettering himself and his family. That's the message of the show; it's obvious the writers knew they had a time bomb on their hands. They are very edgy at times but no real lines are even close to being crossed. In fact it's a highly digestible show, that's it's brilliance. It's a funny adult themed cartoon that people will understand with a strong underlying message about moral values. It focuses around a very typical American guy and his marriage for a reason. The public can identify with Bob, he is like you or me but he is developing a personal relationship with God.

The cast feature a tonne of amazing actors from sitcoms of the past, Laurie Metcalf (Roseanne), French Stewart (3rd Rock), and the queen of animation Nancy Cartwright herself, who voiced Bart Simpson and a tonne of random voices on the Simpsons. There were a lot of antics along the way but the lessons Bob learns are truly strong Christian values. Perhaps it was just very much ahead of it's time.",1199145600,,1880,4.545722713864307

2169859,5,B000667HDG,"I briefly remember this series on television. It sadly did not last that long. This show has an amazing cast of characters. God, a Jerry Garcia-esque wisecracking deity, voiced wonderfully by James Garner.  Who did almost a great a job that Morgan Freeman did in Bruce Almighty. The Devil, voiced by Alan Cumming, is a loveable troublemaker and the banter between him and God is some of the best dialogue of the show. Then there's Bob... As average a joe that you can find. If he's not griping about his job, he is dealling with his unbearably caustic teenage daughter who hates her life or his off the wall, likes to get into his own kind of trounble, 9 year old son. By his side is his loving and very understanding wife. I mean she would have to be when you have been chosen as the newest prophet for God. It is the age old story... God and the devil make a wager. God is giving the Earth one last chance for survival. If one man can prove to God that the Earth is worth keeping around. He will... He lets the Devil choose this man... Bob Allman. This show is a funny and witty look at what it would be like if even with all the problems your life can hand you... you have to deal with all the problems God and the Devil have too.",1152403200,2,1233,4.2025316455696204

All I can say is that it just never seems to develop that spark that interests the viewer in the characters and plots.  It's like a relationship after millions of years.....the characters are blase toward each other and just going through the motions.  The animation was something that seemed detrimental to the series as well, in my opinion.  The style just seemed a little too childish and amateurish.

They were great and I wonder if the use of God and The Devil didn't spark some conflict with the rating system (Either way I loved them and I'm glad to say that I own the whole 13 episodes on Two Discs).  Here is what you get folks :

Disc One
* In The Beginning - Detroit autoworker 'Bob Alman' is dazed and confused when God and The Devil approach him with a bet on whether he can prove the world is worth saving.  (You also get an optional episode commentary by Matthew Carlson, Harvey Myman, Gary Murphy, Neil Thompson and David Sacks).

* Andy Runs Away - Andy (Bob's son) runs away to Canada in embarrassment after he tells his friends that his father has asked God to stop by the house after work and then God's a 'No Show'.

* Date From Hell - Upset that Bob seems to have no fear or respect for him, The Devil decides to make Bob sit up and take notice of his powers by going out with Bob's daughter (Megan).

* The Devil's Birthday - Upset that God has once again forgotten his birthday, The Devil storms off to Hell in a huff taking all the evil of the world with him.  (You also get an optional episode commentary by Matthew Carlson, Harvey Myman, Gary Murphy and Neil Thompson).

* Neighbor's Keeper - On his next assignment from God, Bob teeters on the edge of adultery after he's sent over to a neighbor's house to talk to the wife about her adulterous ways.

* God's Favorite - A series of brushes with disaster mistakenly convince Bob he's invincible and he tells a depressed devil that he is now God's new 'Special Guy'.  (You also get an optional episode commentary by Matthew Carlson and Harvey Myman).

* Committed - When Bob defaces a billboard along the freeway, he gets arrested.  When he tells the police officer he's God's messenger (He then gets committed).

Disc Two -
* Lonely At The Top - Feeling lonely up in heaven, God comes down to hang out with Bob at work, at home and to Bob's ultimate dismay (At the company's saturday night baseball game).

* Bob Gets Greedy - Bob goes on a winning gambling spree after finding The Devil's palm pilot and realizing it contains the scores of games yet to be played.  (You also get an optional episode commentary by Matthew Carlson, Harvey Myman, Gary Murphy, Neil Thompson and David Sacks).

* There's Too Much Sex On Television - God says there's too much sex on television and that Bob needs to go to Hollywood (The source of the problem), to do something about it.  (There's a special guest star : Sarah Michelle Gellar, in this episode).

* Bob's Father - Bob goes to see his dying father in the hospital with hopes of making amends, but he ends up telling the angry and abusive old man to go to Hell.  (You also get an optional episode commentary by Matthew Carlson, Harvey Myman, Gary Murphy, Neil Thompson and David Sacks).

* God's Girlfriend - While God is busy trying to avoid a woman he fears has fallen in love with him, The Devil and Smeck (The Devil's assistant)sneak up to Heaven to start a little mischeif.  (There's a special guest star : Elizabeth Taylor, in this episode).

* Bob Gets Involved - Bob leads a rather clueless vigalante group determined to fight against the evils of society (Totally unaware of how his actions will impact his family).

You also get a few additional special features :

* 'Series overview' (Making-of featurette)
* 'Revealed' Character interview featurette

Here is a series with the voices of French Stewart As Bob (From Third Rock from the Sun), James Gardner as God (Who looks like a Jerry Garcia cartoon character, another reason they might have cancelled this show having God look like Jerry Garcia), Laurie Metcalf (Actress in many movies and starred on The Roseanne Show), Nancy Cartwright (Voice from The Simpsons) and Alan Cumming (Actor in many movies and played the Nightcrawler in 'X2').  So you see here folks that this Animation has some big timers starring in this series.

The bottom line of this show, is that The Devil and God place a bet to see if the world is worth saving.  They pick Bob Alman to see if the world is worth saving.  Bob is a Beer-Drinking, Porn-Watching type of guy who doesn't want to be responsible for saving anyone or anything.  Can Bob save the world?  Start praying...And start laughing Folks, cause this is some awesome Animation.  Funny stuff!!!!",1131235200,7,4402,4.489949748743719

8039141,5,B000667HDG,"This show was well before its time in witty comedy. It's really too bad it came out when people were so uptight because unlike shows like Family Guy, South Park, and the Simpson, the characters were funny and dysfunctional, but not deplorable and without conscious. The networks never gave this gem a chance to shine. If you like intelligently written comedy that pushes the envelop without going overboard, this is definitely for you.",1452816000,,435,4.972602739726027
