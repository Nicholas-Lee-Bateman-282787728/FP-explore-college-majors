1067143,1,630569270X,This isn't a sequel to Dusk Till Dawn. It isn't even a particularly interesting addition to the original. It's really nothing more than a pathetic rehash and bald attempt to make more money off of what was originally a brilliant kitch-horror film. The characters themselves - perhaps save for Tarantino's staple actor Michael Parks' character - are both poorly acted and infuriatingly devoid of any interesting or even slightly redeeming qualities. They are cardboard cutouts. This really does cause me to ache for both Rodriguez and Tarantino - even though I haven't always liked ALL of their films - simply because it such a lazy insult to the original film they made. It almost feels as though they just OK'ed the project because Rodriguez's brother was directing it. Lesson to be learned: nepotism breeds strange and frightening outcomes. Save your money and watch the original Salem's Lot film if you want vampires. Or go and watch some of Rodriguez's more recent works if you'd like to see more from him. They are infinitely more enjoyable than this steaming pile of crap.,1410393600,,1078,4.961325966850829

1067190,1,630569270X,"Ever wonder about the origins of Santanico Pandemonium and the infamous brothel/bar infested with grotesque vampires?

No, honestly I didn't. ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" told me all I needed to know. But we got a prequel to that movie anyway. ""From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter"" seems to be a fairly standard ""gritty"" Western until the final third -- and then it morphs into a less funny, more bizarre clone of the original movie. And for reasons that escape me, it also adds Ambrose Bierce to the mix.

Bierce (Michael Parks) and a pair of newly-wedded missionaries are on their way to Mexico, but they are stopped by Johnny Madrid (Marco Leonardi) and his band of ruthless outlaws. Madrid recently escaped the local hangman (Temuera Morrison), and brought the hangman's beautiful daughter Esmerelda (Ara Celi) with him. Yes, he's falling in love with Esmerelda. Big shock.

After Madrid's gang robs the stagecoach, both groups eventually end up in the same location, a brothel/bar located far in the Mexican desert. Yes, it's THAT one. But Quixla (Sonia Braga), the seductive woman in charge, seems oddly interested in Esmerelda -- and when night falls, the party is attacked by the vampires that run the place.

""From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter"" starts off as a very dark, gritty Western movie, mostly focusing on the clash between the cruel outlaws and the not-very-likable ""good guys."" But in the last third, it starts feeling really familiar -- we have sociopathic thieves, missionaries, an evil vampire queen, and some nameless chumps with ""dead meat"" tattooed on their faces.

Yes, it's basically a retread of the original ""From Dusk Till Dawn,"" except it's in an old western setting. And it's not as good. Or funny. Or scary. Instead P.J. Pesce (who also inflicted ""Lost Boys: The Tribe"" on the world) throws endless boobs and blood at the camera, hoping that we won't notice that he isn't Quentin Tarantino. The plot just sort of plods along, and there's no real feeling of tension even when the vampires are attacking.

And unfortunately, he tries to be funny. Admittedly the TOTALLY RANDOM flamenco-dancing scene is kind of funny, but the others (the snake-head, the flying intestine snakes) feel like Pesce is trying -- and failing -- to imitate Tarantino's sick weirdness.

And the actors aren't anything to write home about either. Leonardi is too wooden and soft-spoken to be a credible outlaw, and he doesn't have the charismatic charm to make us overlook his casually murderous ways. Ara Celi is just as wooden, and most of the others are either nondescript thugs or hamfests (Rebecca Gayheart, Morrison). And while Michael Parks is decent as Ambrose Bierce, I kept wondering WHY Bierce was in this movie.

""From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter"" is a resolutely mediocre prequel to the Tarantino classic -- the plot is good, but the leaden direction and clumsy acting bog it down.",1367107200,2,2927,4.934959349593496
1067191,4,630569270X,"This is the prequel to the series that takes place in the 19th century. Freethinking brandy loving Ambrose Bierce (Michael Parks) is traveling with two evangelists (Lennie Loftin, Rebecca Gayheart). He hopes to join up with Pancho Villa. He meets along the way a group of outlaws lead by Johnny Madrid (Marco Leonardi) and the abused Esmeralda (Ara Celi), the hangman's daughter.

After 40 minutes of introducing and establishing characters, they all end up at a desert inn where we meet our favorite bar tender, Danny Trejo. At this point, anyone who has seen the first film knows that a blood orgy will ensue and it is just a matter of the outcome.

This production is better than the first sequel, but doesn't measure up to original. The dialouge contained some minor clever lines and on a whole a disappointment. The script suffers from attempting to imitate the first film using less quality stars and writers. My recommendation is to buy it as part of a multi-film DVD.

DO NOT buy any Miramax BD's! So far they all look the same.

I bought Hellworld, From Dusk Till Dawn 3, Dracula 2000 and others. They all look the same.

If you've ever seen an 80s movie where the scenes take place in a smoke filled bar, then that is exactly what you are gonne be watching in these so called
""Stunning Hi Def 1080p"".... Uh....Yeah...Right. Hi Def mosquito noise more like it, but if you like watching mosquito noise in HD, then this is for you.
If you've ever watched the Blu Ray of Predator then you know exactly what I'm talking about.

In my opinon there are no artifacts or ""jaggies"" like you get watching an upscaled dvd. So its actually above an upscaled 1080i dvd, but below a true 1080p BD.
Pulse on BD is another hideous BD transfer. That one is even worse than Predator.

Blade is just like all these BUT Blade 2 was actually very nice, not WOW!!! but decent BD transfer.

The colors are flat, they are not bright, but the picture is sharp in the sense that there are no artifacts. Just that never ending cloud of smoke, mosquito noise etc.

You feel like you need to wipe your tv screen down. These movies actually look ten times better on dvd watched on a standard tv (which thankfully I kept)

Also most of these have no sub-titles. I actually like watching movies with sub titles on but thats just my pref.

Just so boring, unoriginal, ugly, unfunny, not exciting.

1067226,3,630569270X,"This third film serves as a prequel to the series, where an outlaw escapes death and flees the noose with the hangman's daughter, only to befall a worse fate when the duo stumble into a den filled with vampires in the Mexican desert. While it is in every way a mediocre tread down a familiar path, the acting is competent enough for a direct to video release and it does offer several impressive set designs that add to the creepy atmosphere. It would appear that this is where the majority of the budget was spent, however, since the make-up and writing are both severely lacking. The strong visual canvas is no substitute for originality or substance, and the paper-thin plot ends up feeling like a rushed second thought rather than an epic back story. But, for every ridiculous looking vampire, there is a gratuitous gore scene, and the film does keep in tone with the two entries preceding it. An entertaining but below average prequel.

1067299,3,630569270X,"Even though the names Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, the pair behind the original film released in 1996 (Tarantino wrote the screenplay, while Rodriguez directed), are prominently displayed on the cover for the film From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter (2000), I didn't get a real sense the two had much to do with the actual film, other than taking executive producing credits.  Rodriguez is listed as a co-writer, and I'd say a smidgen of his flair is present, but only enough to make me think he probably contributed a few ideas and eventually gave the finished script a once over.  Directed by P.J. Pesce (Sniper 3), the film features Michael Parks (The Return of Josey Wales), Marco Leonardi (Once Upon a Time in Mexico), Temuera `Jango Fett' Morrison (Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones), and Ara Celi (Looking for Lola).  Also appearing is Rebecca Gayheart (Urban Legend), Lennie Loftin (Daredevil), Sonia Braga (Moon Over Parador), Orlando Jones (Evolution), Danny Trejo (Con Air), the only performer to appear in all three From Dusk Till Dawn features.

Set around the time just after the American Civil War, the story begins by introducing us to a few gringos traveling down old Mexico way, including Ambrose Pierce (Parks), a writer who has come to throw in with Pancho Villa and his revolutionaries, along with John and Mary Newlie (Loftin and Gayheart), a pair of uptight, preachy newlyweds who intend of setting up a bible school for underprivileged children.  While waiting for their stagecoach to leave, we see an outlaw character named Johnny Madrid (Leonardi) about to be hanged, along with the arrival of The Hangman (Morrison), with The Hangman's daughter Esmeralda (Celi), hiding among the onlookers.  Madrid escapes with a little help, kidnaps Esmeralda, hooks up with his old gang, and sets out to rob the stagecoach carrying Pierce and the Newlies.  By various twists of fate, all eventually end up at a sort of inn in the middle of the desert, and if you've seen the previous films, then you'll know this desert oasis is actually an evil place (the seedy bar featured in the first film), populated by no-goodnik vampire types who lure unsuspecting travelers with the intent on feeding on them.  Things get a bit hairy once The Hangman, whose real name is Mauricio, makes the scene (he and his posse have been chasing after Madrid), and the vampires eventually reveal themselves.  Turns out Mauricio and the head vampire (played by Sonia Braga) have some sort of history, one that involves Esmeralda, who is the key to some sort of ritual, so it is written, so it is told...after the initial bloody carnage following the revelation of the vampires, those who are left, including Pierce, Madrid, Mauricio, and a few others, band together in an uneasy alliance if only to survive, wandering the bowels of the inn/bar, in an effort to escape.

This film did seem to make an attempt to connect to the first film (the second film was really a sequel in name only), basically rehashing the plot in that of a group of unlikely misfits banding together for the sole purpose of surviving the vampire onslaught.  The main problem is, when comparing the two films, none of the characters here had any real substantial essence.  Five minutes after the movie is over, you'll begin to forget them.  What you probably won't forget is the excessive amount of disgusting scenes, some involving the various vampires slurping blood off the floors in an exaggerated fashion.  There's one particularly lovely sequence when Braga's character actually regurgitates blood from one of the victims for another vampire to taste.  I generally don't mind the gory stuff, but this just seemed, pardon the pun, particularly tasteless and unnecessary.  It was almost like the filmmakers knew they couldn't match various aspects from the first film (solid character development, interesting and viable storyline, etc.), so they decided to make their film memorable by grossing everyone out.  As I said the story does somewhat resemble the first film, but what's really missing is any real interest in the characters only because we never really get to know any of them.  There didn't really seem to be any true lead characters as the story often traded off focus from one to another.  As far as this being a prequel, there wasn't much to that...I was hoping for a bit more background to the story, how the vampires came to be, and how they settled where they did, etc., but none of that is offered up.  Santanico Pandemonium (played by Salma Hayek in the first movie) is brought up, but only in the sense of how she came to reside at the inn/bar, and not much else.  As far as the acting goes, it was mainly so-so, but only because no one really had a chance to perform much given the script.  The one character I didn't care at all was that played by Orlando Jones as a wayward brush salesman who later becomes a vampire, and an annoying one at that.  One thing that always puzzled me with regards to the inn/bar...how does such an establishment continue to thrive given the fact those who run it are always eating its patrons?  It would seem to me after awhile word would get out, and customer traffic would drop off...oh well.  One thing I did learn from this film is that vampires whores in the period just after the American Civil War sported G-strings, an undergarment I would have attributed more to modern times.  While there may not be much of an actual story here, director Pesce does keep things moving along, the wheels greased by copious amounts of blood.  The special effects, particularly those involving the vampires, aren't up to par of the first film, but a good deal better than those featured in the second movie.  All in all this wasn't a terrible film, but it could have been a lot better had they trimmed a number of characters and focused more tightly on those who remained (as it is there's about four different plot lines floating around, none of them ever really amounting to much).  There is a decent amount of nekkidness in the film (none featuring the main actresses), along with a few really disgusting, often blood-soaked sequences (one involving the removal of a vampire's gonasticles, which wasn't so much bloody but fairly disgusting), so viewers with tender sensibilities should stay away.

The film, presented in widescreen (1.85:1) format, enhanced for 16X9 TVs, looks clean, and the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround audio comes through well.  The only extras included on the DVD are a deleted scene, along with recommendations for other Dimension DVD releases.

Overall, it will come down to wether you like an action movie with vampires with a bit of fun and gore in it. Dont expect it to live up to the first one, but if you can manage to get through the slow start of the film and have patience to when it picks up, it's ok for a nights entertainment.",1124064000,,721,3.8322147651006713
1067301,4,630569270X,"Deciding if you want to see this one is going to be easy.  If you saw and liked the original ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" then you are going to like ""From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter.""  Even better, if you did not like ""From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money,"" you will find this one more to your taste . In fact, you can skip the first direct to video sequel in favor of this film and not miss a thing because this second sequel is actually a prequel. The bad news is that what makes this one succeed might spell the end of the series, because, after all, how many times can you draw water from the same well? Therefore, we may well be at the end of the Aztec/Mexican Vampire Bloodbath movies.

""From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter"" is set during the Mexican Revolution, tied to that period of history by the presence of Ambrose Bierce (Parks), American newspaper columnist, satirist, essayist, short-story writer, and novelist, an enigmatic figure who disappeared south of the border and is presumed to have died during the siege of Ojinega in January 1914. Bierce is in Mexico to bring something of great value to Pancho Villa, but he is also ill and has something of a death wish.

At the other end of the spectrum is the outlaw Johnny Madrid (Marco Leonardi, ""Like Water for Chocolate"") who not only escapes from the hangman (Temuera Morrison, ""Six Days, Seven Nights""), but the takes the hangman's sensuous daughter Esmeralda (Ara Celi) away with him. Madrid and Bierce first meet up when the outlaw's gang robs the stagecoach on which the writer is riding to join Villa (there is something to be said for having a blind man ride shotgun on a stage). But they meet again after the hold up when Bierce and a young newlywed missionary couple, Mary and John Newlie (Rebecca Gayheart and Lennie Loftin), end up that night seeking shelter at the combination bar and bordello that we recall from the first film (Danny Trejo is still behind the bar as Razor Charlie). Meanwhile, the hangman is still on the trail of his daughter. Eventually, wackiness ensues.

The film returns to the essence of the original, which finds a ground of humans forced by dire circumstances to band together against a horde of bloodsucking fiends. The first time around the scene was set in a Mexican biker bar. This time around it is essentially the wild, wild west, even if it is still early in the 20th century. The movie has a touch of class with Sonia Braga as Quixtla, the proprietress of the establishment, although the Bierce character also brings some dignity and ironic wit to the proceedings. Orlando Jones even plays it essentially straight in his role as an Andalusian brush peddler in the wrong place at the wrong time.

The script is by lvaro Rodrguez, based on a story he co-wrote with original director Roberto Rodrguez. Director P.J. Pesce (""Body Waves"") does not have the cinematic flair of Roberto Rodriguez, but then who does? The main thing is that he treats the first half of the film seriously as we deal with the possible romance between the outlaw and the hangman's daughter, the stagecoach robbery, and Bierce's deathwish. Then it becomes party time in the bar and all hell breaks loose. The special effects are over the top, but intentionally so; they are just part of the menu. The last half of the movie is simply a question of going along for the ride and waiting to see who makes it out of there alive.

Actually, I think ""From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter"" might be more enjoyable than the original. It is more of a classic horror film without the ""Pulp Fiction"" sensibilities that writer Quentin Tarantino brought to the table the first time around (with the exception of this film's ""dance number""). As always when it comes to such films, whether we are talking Tarantino or vampires, it comes down to questions of taste. Either way, this film deserved better than the fate of being direct to video.",1123804800,,3942,4.630901287553648

Also of note is the fact that the REAL director's name isn't listed anywhere on the cover. I know they did this to try and cash in on the name value of Tarentino and Rodriguez, but if I were those two, I'd be embarassed to have my name be associated with something as bad as this.

As if the last terrible straight-to-video B movie sequel of From Dusk Till Dawn wasn't bad enough, we now get a prequel of sorts. The story takes place 100 years ago in Mexico and follows an outlaw named Johnny Madrid, who has just escaped being hung. He kidnaps the hangman's daughter, Esmeralda, rounds up his buddies, and hides away in a bar for the night. But this bar isn't all that it seems, as mayhem suddenly unfolds (when I mention ""mayhem"", I of course mean the same exact thing that happened in the original happens again here, except with cheaper make-up effects). Luckily, our heroes escape into a pasageway in the basement and wander around for about 15 minutes. Suddenly, they all start fighting and they fall back into the main bar area where all the vampires are (Yes, that's right. They wandered for 15 minutes, only to find that they didn't even go anywhere). The vampires tie them up, and we find out that Esmeralda is really Santanico Pandemonium (the character that Salma Hayek played in the original. Apparently, someone actually thought that character was interesting enough to fill out a whole movie. Sorry guys, but when you don't even have Salma, the plan fails miserably). This movie gets even weirder as Esmeralda bites her father (which turns him into a vampire of course), and then, for reasons that aren't explained, starts making out with him (I'm not talking about her giving him a little peck or anything, as this appears to be full, French kissing action. Maybe the director has some sick fantasy about wanting to see kids making out with their parents, but nobody else cares to see stuff like that). Eventually, Madrid and another character leave. The End.

As you can see, most of the plot is pretty bad. The only thing is, with the right actors, a higher budget, and a director that doesn't have fantasies about incest, this could have actually been good. But in reality, we get scenes that don't make sense and many plot elements that don't go anywhere.

The acting, as you can expect, is usual below average B movie stuff. But one actress in particular (Jordana Spiro) annoyed me to end. This actress looks like a guy (for half of the movie, they only referred to her as ""Reece"" or ""The Kid"". I only found out she was a female when they mentioned her first name about half-way through the movie), and she has the most annoying voice I've ever heard. The only saving factors are Danny Trejo (who was also in the first one and the sequel) and Orlando Jordan. Jordan steals the scenes that he's in, as he plays a humorous salesman that would go on and on about the qualities of something as simple as a hair brush. Trejo is a fairly good actor that has a nice physique for his age, so I have to wonder why a guy like him is still appearing in B-movies.

Unless you enjoy senseless gore, I'd advise against seeing this one. And if you do like gore, just see the first one again. I've seen the original 20+ times, and would still rather see it again than watch ""The Hangman's Daughter"" a second time.",1100736000,5,3943,4.549295774647887

1067305,4,630569270X,"This third movie in the series goes back to the turn of the century (19th to 20th that is) and concerns author Ambrose Bierce who traveled to Mexico to aid in the revolution but was never heard from again (see the book The Old Gringo by Carlos Fuentes).  In this version of history, Bierce runs into some vampires at a saloon that becomes the bar in the first movie.
Bierce is looking for Pancho Villa to offer his services.  But on his way he runs into outlaws, highwaymen, would-be outlaws, posses, a half-breed, a Fuller brush man, and lots of vampires.
Several plots bring all of the characters to the vampire saloon.  There we see that even drunk Bierce would have been a fine addition to the revolution.  But the usual biting and bloodletting ensues and we discover that the hangman's daughter is an important figure for the vampire (although I wonder how the newly-converted brush salesman knows enough to announce that she has come).
Although this film follows the previous films in pitting outlaws against vampires, this one has a different feel due to the historical setting and characters.  It also sets the stage for the later events of the first movie.  Bierce is a wonderful character and very nicely portrayed.  I will not tell you if his historical disappearance is due to vampires or not.",1080518400,3,1305,4.722466960352423

This straight-to-video effort is actually very creative with both its direction and general story, not to mention some quality make-up effects from the KNB team.

1067308,4,630569270X,"This one is simple.  If you saw and liked the original ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" then you are going to like ""From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter.""  Even better, if you did not like ""From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money,"" you will find this one more to your taste .  In fact, you can skip the first direct to video sequel in favor of this film and not miss a thing because this second sequel is actually a prequel.  The bad news is that what makes this one succeed might spell the end of the series, because, after all, how many times can you draw water from the same well?  Therefore, we may well be at the end of the Aztec/Mexican Vampire Bloodbath movies.
""From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter"" is set during the Mexican Revolution, tied to that period of history by the presence of Ambrose Bierce (Parks), American newspaper columnist, satirist, essayist, short-story writer, and novelist, an enigmatic figure who disappeared south of the border and is presumed to have died during the siege of Ojinega in January 1914.  Bierce is in Mexico to bring something of great value to Pancho Villa, but he is also ill and has something of a death wish.
At the other end of the spectrum is the outlaw Johnny Madrid (Marco Leonardi, ""Like Water for Chocolate"") who not only escapes from the hangman (Temuera Morrison, ""Six Days, Seven Nights""), but the takes the hangman's sensuous daughter Esmeralda (Ara Celi) away with him.  Madrid and Bierce first meet up when the outlaw's gang robs the stagecoach on which the writer is riding to join Villa (there is something to be said for having a blind man ride shotgun on a stage).  But they meet again after the hold up when Bierce and a young newlywed missionary couple, Mary and John Newlie (Rebecca Gayheart and Lennie Loftin), end up that night seeking shelter at the combination bar and bordello that we recall from the first film (Danny Trejo is still behind the bar as Razor Charlie).  Meanwhile, the hangman is still on the trail of his daughter.  Eventually, wackiness ensues.
The film returns to the essence of the original, which finds a ground of humans forced by dire circumstances to band together against a horde of bloodsucking fiends.  The first time around the scene was set in a Mexican biker bar.  This time around it is essentially the wild, wild west, even if it is still early in the 20th century.  The movie has a touch of class with Sonia Braga as Quixtla, the proprietress of the establishment, although the Bierce character also brings some dignity and ironic wit to the proceedings.  Orlando Jones even plays it essentially straight in his role as an Andalusian brush peddler in the wrong place at the wrong time.
The script is by lvaro Rodrguez, based on a story he co-wrote with original director Roberto Rodrguez.  Director P.J. Pesce (""Body Waves"") does not have the cinematic flair of Roberto Rodriguez, but then who does?  The main thing is that he treats the first half of the film seriously as we deal with the possible romance between the outlaw and the hangman's daughter, the stagecoach robbery, and Bierce's deathwish.  Then it becomes party time in the bar and all hell breaks loose.  The special effects are over the top, but intentionally so; they are just part of the menu.  The last half of the movie is simply a question of going along for the ride and waiting to see who makes it out of there alive.
Actually, I think ""From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter"" might be more enjoyable than the original.  It is more of a classic horror film without the ""Pulp Fiction"" sensibilities that writer Quentin Tarantino brought to the table the first time around (with the exception of this film's ""dance number"").  As always when it comes to such films, whether we are talking Tarantino or vampires, it comes down to questions of taste.  Either way, this film deserved better than the fate of being direct to video.",1053993600,18,3919,4.649275362318841

FDTD3 is basically a spaghetti western meets vampire flick taking as its starting point the fact that Ambrose Bierce did disappear in Mexico in 1914.

1067403,5,630569270X,"My hopes were a little down with the production of From Dusk Til Dawn 2 because of its lack of material.  When I finally saw this one, I was very surprised.  It was the best western horror film I ever saw.  It also had an  interesting plot.
  The story takes place one hundred years ago, which  was the time when the infamous bar started.  It begins with a young man who  is sentenced to die.  The hangman is interrupted from his work by his  daughter, so he also has her to die.  Fortunately, they escape on a high  octane bloody chase of cat and mouse.  They meet strange people on the way,  and they join them to reach their destination.
  Meanwhile, two  yuppies are headig out somewhere until they are interrupted by a man who is  after the two who were sentenced to die.  The two lose their ride and are  forced to walk to the nearest place.  The days go by and it gets hotter and  hotter.  They finally reach a bar that also rents out rooms.  They decide  to sleep there overnight.  The husband wonders off and finds private rooms  full of beautiful women.  He is eventually pulled into their spell of lust,  adultery, and vampirism.  His wife begins to worry, and she wonders off  herself.  When she does find him, she is shocked at what she sees.
  The two on the run also find their way to the bar.  As the man is having a  drink, he is looks around to see a fist fight.  The fight turns brutal, and  it ends in a death.  The vampires smell the blood, and they begin to act  fast.  What happens next is the routine gratuitous violence and gore.
  The two sides meet, and they have to work together before they are the  next ones to be vampires.  With the help the hangman, the yuppies, and  others, they fight for their lives that seem to be in danger.
  Although it may seem like the normal vampire movies that have come out, it  isn't.  The movie is not all about vampires.  It is actually about how the  whole thing began.  Half of the movie is about a normal western town in  which two criminals are on the run, which may turn some away from it.  The  other half is action packed and has explicit vampire violence and gore.
  This movie may have a lot of violence, but is also has some scenes of  sexuality.  As the first, the movie conatined the traditional extensive  nudity and sexuality.  However, this movie contained some scenes which  people may call offensive and crude.
  The cast was very well done.  They combined some of the best actors and actresses for one movie.  They  read their parts very well.  They had emotion in them and they were read  loud and clear.  There was no sign of dullness in it.
  The settings  and special effects were incredible also.  The makers of this film had to  do a lot of work to make the oustanding background and excellent special  effects.  The makeup and vampires were done very well.  They look very  scary and has hardly been done by anyone.
  The movie may not have  contained any humor like some of the others had, but it was still  entertaining.  The other were sort of tongue in cheek, so you could expect  the natural dark humor and violence mixed together.  This movie was not  tongue in cheek at all.  It contained serious roles and a serious  script.
  I would also recommend the original From Dusk til Dawn.  It  was also entertaining.  Ii did not have the best background, but it was  funnier, gorier, and more action packed.

After  awhile - upon scrutinization - you start to see the creases in the suits  that the actors are wearing.  It's hard to not see, to be honest, and can  take away from the effect.  That said, however, there was some pretty  well-done CGI - mainly in the bat creatures as another reviewer pointed  out.
The special effects were, unfortunately, the only redeeming factor.  The acting was barely tolerable, and there were characters that made you  question their purpose for existance.  What's up with the wanna-be outlaw  girl, for example?  After nearly getting killed by one of the main  characters, you would expect her to be out for <fontcolor=red>blood</fontcolor>, & have some sort  of climatic vengence scene.
