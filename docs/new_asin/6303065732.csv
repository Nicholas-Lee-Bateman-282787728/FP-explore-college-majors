8133767,5,6303065732,"Ok.. one might believe that someone who loves this series must be gay, but that would just be ignorant! Actually, the beauty of these characters are found within all of us, that's why it's so great! I am (was) alot like the Paul Gross character and the cast of characters is so good that I think everyone finds themselves somewhere in here. And everyone gets along!! But ya, I also saw this on PBS when it came out, I remember channel searching one night (one boring night) and stumbled onto this thing and I was hooked! I had to watch it the next two nights and my new wife thought I was nuts! A few years later I again stumbled onto it, this time on Bravo and told my wife she had to check this out. Now she is hooked! Anyway.. straight, gay, reserved or whatever your thing is.. you will find it here and find relaxation that you may not have experienced watching anything else. This is special.",1111017600,7,898,4.319526627218935
8133768,5,6303065732,I have watched these movies more times than I can count.  I never grow tired of the stories.  Olympia Dukakis (as well as the entire cast) is/are amazing.  If you have never seen this RUN to your video store and rent them....better yet....just buy them cause you'll watch them more than once.,997056000,6,292,4.576923076923077
