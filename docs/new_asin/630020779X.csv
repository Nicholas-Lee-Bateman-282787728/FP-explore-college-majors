7805122,2,630020779X,"absolutely one of Flynn's WORST FILMS EVER !... ERROL IS LOST HERE -IN HIS ONLY FILM for REPUBLIC studios. The only saving grace of this BO-O-R-R RRING,  OVERLONG RIDE in a dismal  old- NEW ORLEANS surrounding, is VINCENT PRICE -- in a Halloween-costume type of character role he was starting to play around this period. He actually steals the movie from FLYNN; and as for AGNES MOOREHEAD(!)---  one would hope for something a little more creepier than the 'when do-I-get -paid?-look on her face that she carries all through the 100 minutes-PLUS DISASTER WHICH COMES OFF LIKE AN  UN-FUNNNY FUN-HOUSE RIDE THRROUGH 'CREEPVILLE'.--YUCK.!!! I find it difficult here to give a bad rating for ANY Flynn film,  but FOR 'CAPTAIN FABIAN'--I can say that ANYTHING with FLYNN-  is better than NO-FLYNN at all; and in this case, considering the time, place, and events BEHIND the making of this NON-ACTIONER , (made at the step-down studio REPUBLIC,)  was most likely a lot spicier than the FLYNN-SCRIPTED MESS OF A STORY here,.  Soon after this bomb( which he had tried to block the  release of),  ERROL  ended his long-running contract with WARNER BROS. with the  excellent ""THE MASTER OF BALLANTRAE"" (1953) . I must conclude here by mentioning  that  CAPT.FABIAN has been a rare and long-awaited -for- title in  the FLYNN CAMP; surprising most of us with a  BLU-RAY TRANSFER  which is absolutely STUNNING and SHARP,  letting  THE VIEWER,  absorb  an interesting VISUAL ride, for sure. Lastly, I was wondering WHY this title would come out on BLU-RAY  BEFORE any of his  TRUE CLASSIC TITLES titles awaiting  B-R transfers at this date.  TRUE FLYNNADDICTS  should FLIP  seeing this  RARE ITEM FINALLY reaching  the screen ---ITS BEAUTIFUL!!! ( but..no 'extras' on this release...!?!)

The contrast is good, the clarity is good and it hasn't been released on DVD ever, so it's nice to be able to get it since it was only released on VHS before.  I view my movies on over a 100 inch screen so I can easily be critical because I can see every little dot. The acting by Vincent Price is great as always ...Errol Flynn  I think does a fine job also. I recommend highly if you're Vincent Price fan.
It's not really a swashbuckling tale if that's what you're looking for. It's not Vincent Price best movie, but it's definitely a worthy addition if you are looking for some of his hard to find movies.",1442620800,,653,4.174603174603175

Errol Flynn brings considerable machismo to the role of the Captain Michael Fabian in Adventures of Captain Fabian, a romantic, swashbuckling adventure filled with intrigue. Set in 1860 New Orleans, Adventures of Captain Fabian, tells the story Lea Mariotte [Micheline Presle] a French Creole maid who seeks revenge against the Brissac family, moneyed blueblood who have wrongly framed her for murder. Coming to her aid is the handsome Captain Michael Fabian [Errol Flynn], whose personal animus propels the plot toward a spectacular finale. Vincent Price is cast as George Brissac, the weak willed Brissac nephew, with Agnes Moorehead, playing against type, and providing comic relief as Lea Mariottes confident, Aunt Jezebel.

Cast: Errol Flynn, Micheline Presle, Vincent Price, Agnes Moorehead, Victor Francen, Jim Grald, Hlna Manson, Howard Vernon, Roger Blin, Valentine Camax, Georges Flateau, Zanie Campan, Reggie Nalder, Marcel Journet, Gilles Quant, Charles Fawcett and Aubrey Bower

Andrews Blu-ray Review: The title right off is misleading; the alternate title of ""New Orleans Adventure"" is more apropos. Adventures of Captain Fabian, offers Erroll Flynn and Micheline Prelle in a romance, intrigue and swashbuckling capers. Possibly to give authentic Gallic backgrounds and flavouring to this heavy-handed tale of Old New Orleans. Producer William Marshall packed the stars off to France, along with Agnes Moorehead, Vincent Price and Victor Francen, and succeeded at the location shoot. Errol Flynn, apparently after a thorough perusing of ""Saratoga Trunk,"" wrote the screenplay himself, keeping his role down to a few suave walk-ons and pencilling in a fat one for his co-star, who happens to be the producer's spouse.

The story is about young maid Lea Mariotte [Micheline Presle], who is dissatisfied with her social position, or lack thereof, yet resentful of the upper class whom she has chosen to serve. When the family goes away on holiday, she invites all her Cajun friends and scruffy Aunt Jezebel [Agnes Moorehead]. Lea Mariotte dons the lady's clothes and beds the lady's fiance George Brissac [Vincent Price], and she wants to marry him, and his ill-begotten money, but George Brissac is obligated to his father's wishes and the family's society reputation to pursue the family business and marry according to his station.

As the vengeful Lea Mariotte [Micheline Presle] the French Creole who is framed on a murder charge by some local bluebloods, she is saved by the roving Captain Michael Fabian [Errol Flynn], who decides to help her strike back. Not that Ms. Micheline Presle needs much aid, although she is constantly moaning about the fate of her poor mother. That lady, it seems, was hanged but, it develops, not soon enough. For Ms. Micheline Presle ruins the whole situation. She tricks a weak nephew, George Brissac [Vincent Price], into marriage and the murder of his uncle, authoritatively played by Victor Francen.

When Captain Michael Fabian sails back into town, the inhabitants are abuzz; he has his eye on Henri Brissac, and suspects him responsible for his father's death and the disappearance of merchant earnings. When he sees Lea Mariotte putting on airs in the tavern, he buys the establishment for her on a whim, and then suddenly disappears again without warning, but this we never find out why.

On the night before George Brissac's wedding, he and his fellow drunken pals enter the tavern during their rounds. Lea Mariotte lures him to his mansion, where they spend the night. Henri Brissac [Victor Francen] is furious, and threatens to strip his no-good son of the family inheritance. For the first time, George Brissac asserts himself, but to murder. Lea Mariotte conditionally helps him bury his father's body, and sees to it that his jacket is mixed in with the dirt. The enigmatic Captain Michael Fabian re-joined the picture at this point. When he starts to demand a little affectionate payback for Lea Mariottes success, especially find something is found with the body of Henri Brissac when it is discovered.

This is a slightly bizarre storyline, with slightly flat exaggerated characters, especially Aunt Jezebel [Agnes Moorehead] to the point of being too cartoony, and there are plenty of plot holes. For example, Captain Michael Fabian's intense desire for Lea Mariotte later in the film, is sudden and unexpected. Earlier in the film, he appeared to regard her with passing amusement. Could it be that this was one of Errol Flynn's walk in the park type picture that is mentioned in several autobiographies, about that time in his life, on the other hand maybe it is possible that Republic Pictures meagre budget, would neither allow for a bigger budget or afford to stand up to the main star, still we will never know.

Anyway to sum up Adventures of Captain Fabian, we have the oh so wonderful thespian Vincent Price gives a wonderful over the top performance, one that we eventually see in other camp villainous roles in future films, and the mainstay of his subsequent fantastic film career. Meanwhile Ms. Micheline Presle is surprisingly convincing and calculating vixen in a Joan Crawford mould of acting, and a typical role for this particular actress, who I personally have never heard of before, but have been told that it is a typical role for this actress, who is better known for playing straight romantic leads. But sadly Errol Flynn did not show his full potential in this film, which is a shame, especially if you compare his vast acting talent in other worthy films for this actor. Finally, it is the contributions from these talented performers, which makes the film tolerable, if not strangely compelling at times, but you cant help cringing at the ludicrously contrived camp ending, especially Ms. Micheline Presle moaning and groaning when the ships mast falls on her, sadly Ms. Micheline Presle failed to get her OSCAR that year.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Adventures of Captain Fabian is presented on Blu-ray courtesy of Olive Films and Republican Pictures with a very nice encoded 1080p transfer, with a respectable aspect ratio of 1.37:1. And it is great to finally see a Republic Pictures brought out by Olive Films, and I hope there will be more releases will be coming out in the future from the fabulous Republic Pictures vast catalogue of films. Contrast is occasionally variable, but is mostly solid, delivering very good black levels and decently modulated grey scale. Grain is fairly heavy throughout the presentation. While the entire transfer is on a slightly soft side, close-ups can provide decent to very good levels of fine detail.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Adventures of Captain Fabian features a 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Mono. In this case it's higher than average amounts of hiss, which I suppose is related to some of its age related issues of the soundtrack. If you turn your AV receiver up a bit too much, the soundtrack problem of course increases slightly and so there is a fine balance needed to be maintained at a good level, but despite this, once you get into the film, this problem does not make me want to look out for the hiss problem. Within that context, fidelity is very reasonable, especially for the age of the film, because it offers good reproduction across all frequency ranges, but sounding typically ambience of its period, as per many of the lower fidelity soundtracks of that era.

Finally, if you are curious to see Adventures of Captain Fabian I am hoping it may offer you some kind of pleasures, if you like dashing swashbuckling heroes. The film is at times slightly hit and misses most of the time, but despite a rather over the top spirited performance by Ms. Michelin Prelle and a very good supporting turn by Agnes Moorehead, as well as a very sinister Vincent Price. As for Errol Flynn, his role is slightly and sadly diminished at times, to the point of only being in a cameo role, especially in this his own conceived film, hovering around the edges and trying not to intrude too much, for some unknown reason, perhaps in the hope that his absence will make the films heart grow much fonder. But despite lots of critics hating the film, I really enjoyed it very much and has some really good moments that I really enjoyed and I am glad I purchased this Blu-ray disc, as I personally had never heard of this film before or ever seen it in the cinema or on the television, but again I am so pleased it is now my Blu-ray Collection, as I love any film that has the swashbuckling hero of Errol Flynn. Recommended!

7805129,1,630020779X,"Be forewarned: Errol Flynn's ""Adventures of Captain Fabian"" (1951) is NOT a swashbuckler. The screen legend wrote the convoluted screenplay for this dreary French melodrama (with uncredited direction by Robert Florey). Boring beyond belief, despite the presence of Vincent Price and Agnes Moorehead. Republic Pictures distributed Flynn's low-budget misadventure  a production wholly deserving of its obscurity.",1343433600,11,410,6.321428571428571

How Errol ever got Agnes Moorehead and Vincent price to do this is a mystery to me.(I wonder if they were still talking to Errol when this was finished?)
Errol is credited with the screenplay(Ill bet he later regreted that)William Marshall,ex actor(Santa Fe Trail with Errol)director.
as for the story,1840 New Orleans. Errol is a sea captain who gets involved in a murder along with costar,Micheline Presle.
In this economy(or any other)My advice is save your money.",1322784000,15,614,4.80188679245283
