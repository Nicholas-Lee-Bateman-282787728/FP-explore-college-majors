8728438,4,B013PKHPPE,"This was a wonderful, near-perfect film.  An epic lifetime story and a rare glimpse of ordinary lives of Japanese citizens during WWII. A near-perfect film, probably the very best film I saw this year, and deserving of a much wider release than this limited edition of 3000.  I can't say exactly why I'm holding back a star, I just don't automatically give everything 5 stars like most Amazon reviewers.  This is a considered rating.  4 stars is very meaningful from me and hard to get. Thanks to Twilight Time for finding this gem!  More Yoji Yamada on Blu-ray PLEASE!!!!",1485820800,,572,4.737373737373737
