I think it will not hurt any body if this show comes out on DVD, it is just interesting for fans to see the show again.

Thanks, have a nice day :)",1151712000,9,1442,4.894957983193278

I think many people would like to see it again and I am one of them.",1151712000,18,232,3.8333333333333335
7940896,1,B00005JOED,"I've liked everything else which spun off from the Happy Days empire, so I thought that I would watch this show when TV Land broadcast selected episodes during one afternoon.

I now know why this show has the unique distinction of being a Happy Days spin off which ultimately could not catch on with the American people.

Joanie and Chachi set out with friends for Chicago. They hope to make it in the very competitive music industry as a teen band during the early 1960's. Yet, they fail miserably for several reasons which are consciously not mentioned in any of the episodes. In an attempt to continue milking the Happy Days cash cow, the production team made several critical errors which undercut the show itself.

First, Joanie and Chachi's 'singing voices' are horrible for a bubblegum pop band. I'm not sure if the fact Moran and Baio could not sing to save themselves actually was supposed to be an inside joke, or just that nobody in the production department had the guts to spare them (and the country) from the actual truth. If you have to watch this show for whatever reason, using earplugs during those parts prevents a very nasty migraine from soon developing. There's also the mute button of the television set.

Secondly, the wardrobe department is not even trying to maintain a 50's-60's motif at this point anymore. The long hair and/or perms of many a cast member should more appropriately be considered relics of the 1970's and early 1980's. At the very least, they should have been wearing wigs, or camouflaged their actual 'off camera' hair styles like Henry Winkler had attempted with his own long hair during the seasons of ""Happy Days"". It's not just a few people or non-descript extras with this obvious error, the lead characters (whom the audiences are expected to like) also had this error.

It's not really hard to figure out why Joanie and Chachi quickly lost their own show, returned to Happy Days, and their Chicago venture was never mentioned again on camera during that show. Sure, it had Al (who married Chaci's mother) on hand to give out advice and provide a place for 'the kids' to play, but that apparently only went so far.

Special guest stars Marion Ross, Tom Bosley, and Henry Winkler (who began directing with this series's episode ""Best Foot forward"") could not save it from being cancelled.

The only really interesting episode ""One on one"" earns such designation because Nancy Lieberman (who had played in the Women's Baskeball League and Women's American Basketball Association, precursors to today's WNBA) made a guest appearance as Joanie's college athlete friend. Chachi is initially convinced that women cannot play basketball, but VERY quickly  changes his mind after being beaten in a one-on-one game with her. Today Lieberman(-Cline) remains a women's basketball superstar and is a WNBA coach after having played in this same league.

""Best foot forward"" has Joanie and Chachi trying to devise an escape plan after they see Chachi's parents in the same adult (then 21) movie which they have snuck into. This episode was a nice change just because it challenged a preset notion that Joanie and Chachi are goodie-goodies who would never ever do something like this.

Maybe there is somebody out there who actually likes this series in itself, but I cannot see this show  actually garnering enough votes for a season DVD release. I am skeptical if 17 episodes are enough to warrant a season release.",1119052800,2,3454,4.887179487179488
