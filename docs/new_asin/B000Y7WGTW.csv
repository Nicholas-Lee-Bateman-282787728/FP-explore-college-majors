Out of all the girls I seem to find Rachel the most interesting. Kate seems out of it, like she is depressed, and decides that maybe GRACE is not for her.  In fact she wonders if GRACE and her really fit together.  To me this seems kind of petty when you think about the rest of the problems she has.  She is, after all, DEAD.  Yet she seems to come back to life, as it were, in the fourth episode of the DVD when she develops an interest in a certain boy.
Rose at least seems to have family issues bothering her and Claire is having a hard time just making ends meet.  Both had a lot on their plate before the first episode on the first DVD and I think they are handling things the best way they can by trying to act normal - or as normal as they can be.  The point is they have skills to deal with this kind of thing.
But Rachel, from my point of view, has had the filters taken from her eyes.  Her life really had no meaning and now, after she is dead, she can see it for what it was.  One big party, a social get together that never ended.  And a boyfriend who seems to want to dump her only after a few days of trouble.  At least the guy interested in Claire kind of hangs around her even when it pisses her off.
Which is funny because Rachel is the same type of girl who would have never talked to me in school.  And I would not have talked to either.  Hey, she would have been WAY out of my reach.  Yet by unpeeling her like a onion and showing the insides they show human being within.  And force me to see the human inside her also.
Why take a point away?  Not because the plot slowed down and the action slowed.  It isn't that kind of series.  I took it away because they took away the musical numbers that gave it that weird twist.  Not one song in the whole DVD in any of the stories.  Also it seems to be heading towards a romantic story, like Beauty and the Beast, and not really a horror story.  In fact there seemed to be very little in the way of horror in the DVD - only two fight scenes that I remember.
Also they changed the ending song by episode 12 and I LIKED that song.  Oh well, still good enough to watch and continue watching because of all the things they are starting to reveal.  The story is being unpeeled also, not just Rachel.",1237852800,,2430,4.0125
