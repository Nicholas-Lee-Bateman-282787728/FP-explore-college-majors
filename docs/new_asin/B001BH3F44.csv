8283227,5,B001BH3F44,"I am a flip this house fan. I watch it weekly on A&E. I liked how Armando and his crew took over the houses and made them into something that people want to buy. Also, the tips given on the DVD's are helpful to updating/flipping houses.",1251504000,2,236,4.1521739130434785
8283228,4,B001BH3F44,"Armando Montelongo is the flipper in these episodes, and his ego is as big as Texas, the state he works in. So the pleasure I receive from this show is mostly from hating Armando, and cheering for the people that quit when he abuses them. The main reason I bought this particular volume is for the ""Little House of horrors"" episode, which features the most disgusting house on the planet, and how it almost breaks Armando. If you love to hate bigger than life personalities, then give this a try.",1246233600,9,496,4.522222222222222
