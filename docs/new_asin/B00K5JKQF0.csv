8655986,5,B00K5JKQF0,"""Our Mr. Sun"" was originally, (in 1956), a television film written, produced and directed by Frank Capra, (yes, that famous director Frank Capra, from ""It's A Wonderful Life""), for the Bell Laboratory Science Series. Nine television specials were released in that series, but this one is the one, (along with, maybe, ""Hemo the Magnificent""), that most of us remember watching as kids. Wikipedia reminded me that AT&T ultimately distributed about 1,600 copies of the film to schools and youth organizations. (I remember going to the Bell Telephone office downtown to borrow the film reel and a projector to show these to Scout groups and church Youth Fellowships and the like.)

Everyone in these films was a class act or on the way to becoming someone, (Eddie Albert of all people), and the whole project has a gee-whiz sciencey feel that remains inspirational and endearingly corny. This is a treat for your memory if you're an oldster, and still interesting and fun, and surprisingly not too dated, for every budding scientist. A nice, fun find.",1457654400,2,1047,5.017241379310345

8655988,5,B00K5JKQF0,Takes me back over 45 years to the 16 mm films I first saw the series in. Well done and still enjoyable. I can't believe it is available in this modern format. Better than the original!,1419724800,3,185,4.166666666666667

8655992,5,B00K5JKQF0,I loved the AT&T science series videos as a child and now my grandsons like them.,1410998400,,81,4.125
8655993,5,B00K5JKQF0,"Our Mr Sun was the first of four films written, produced, and directed by the legendary film director Frank Capra-- they are entertaining, a great nostalgia item, and most, if not all, of the basic science still holds up.  The main host was Dr Frank Baxter, a charismatic educator... These films are highly recommended, and many highly entertaining stories about them are detailed in my new book (just out on Amazon) SONNETS AND SUNSPOTS, DR RESEARCH BAXTER AND THE BELL SCIENCE FILMS..",1401840000,2,486,4.926829268292683
