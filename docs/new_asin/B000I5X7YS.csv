8144072,5,B000I5X7YS,"In my quest to learn the German language I watch a lot of German language movies.  I usually watch the first time with subtitles and listen really hard to see how much of the words, phrases, and sometimes ! sentences I can distinguish.
I get really tired of all the movies about WWII, Nazi Germany, etc. so it's really refreshing to see a movie like this.
In a neighborhood group of kids who play together all the time and attend the same school, a boy and girl switch bodies and get the chance to REALLY walk a mile in each other's shoes.  I think Hollywood made a similar movie about a mother and daughter trading bodies, but this tops it.
I also like that one of the kids is a chubby little boy who turns out to have a really special talent.  He is not criticized for his weight or bullied by the other kids but is just part of the crowd.
Warning for American parents: there is some nudity (not sex) which is NOT offensive to Germans.
For Germans, guns and gun violence are much more disturbing than simple nudity.",1360886400,,1017,4.31413612565445
8144073,5,B000I5X7YS,"I found this movie entirely enjoyable, and watching it in German is much better than in the awful English Dub that was put out.

The other revieweres commented on the language and the nudity. I would like to remind viewers that this is NOT an American film. ""Cuss"" words are not as offensive there, and nudity is not something that really bothers people.

If you are offended my mild language and BRIEF nudity, than pick up the English dub. Otherwise, feel free to enjoy an extreamely well-made children's movie.",1341100800,2,512,4.741573033707865
8144074,4,B000I5X7YS,"Like the other reviewer, I wasn't quite expecting the amount of cussing that is in this film, and the nudity took me by surprise as well. The nudity, however, lasts only for about two seconds, so it wasn't that big of a deal to me. I would say that this movie is good for kids ages 12 and up. It has a similar storyline to Freaky Friday, but it's much better. Cute story, with pretty good child actors.",1235174400,,402,4.166666666666667
8144075,2,B000I5X7YS,"I bought this movie in an effort to help my child learn conversational German.  However, the sound quality is not very good, and the actors are hard to understand with a good bit of ""hiss"" sound in the background.  I also was not happy with the language used in the film.  It appears to be a childrens' film, but both the children and adults use frequent expletives (which are faithfully subtitled in English).  The film also includes nudity, which made me uncomfortable showing this to my young child.  If this were an American film, it would probably be rated R, even though the child actors appear to be 13 or younger.  I would have appreciated more information on the content prior to purchase.",1214697600,6,698,4.634146341463414
