8528354,4,B008I34YP8,"The Canadian film is rather well-done with a few surprises -- but only a few. There are many ambiguous moments, which is fine for a psychological mystery such as this. Controlling patients in a form of universal mind or consciousness is used as an alternative to keeping them sedated on drugs and making the BIG PHARMA even more wealthy. The end of the film shows that many of the patients can be cured with such unconventional and controversial methods. Heading the institution in the beginning is Patrick McGoohan, always an interesting actor. A wheel-chair confined controller of the patients is played in superb fashion by Amanda Plummer. I ordered this DVD partially for McGoohan but Plummer matches him with her role of a pathetic but strong person.

Michael Mahoney pulls his weight as a strong and handsome hero/psychiatrist who becomes both a victim of Plummer and a rescuer. At the end, certain roles in the Gothic mansion institute have been altered. A gorgeous but schizophrenic patient with overt violent tendencies is played by Emmanuelle Vaugier; her semi-nude swimming scene when she tries to stab Mahoney with a cork screw makes for stunning scene near the beginning.

Unfortunately, the condition of this DVD was not good. Like many that I buy through the mail, this arrived with many scratches and jumps that required my using my cleaning equipment -- not just cloths and liquids but an interesting device. This helped a little but not totally.",1423872000,6,1463,4.991803278688525

8528357,5,B008I34YP8,"In 1997, surrealist Dutch director Rene Daalder shot two films back-to-back. The first one was the widely distributed and wonderfully unique sci-fi/horror comedy HABITAT, which was released on both VHS & DVD, as well as having many TV showings. The second film was this one, which sat on the shelf since 1997 and had no distribution of any kind either theatrically or on home video until boutique label Cult Epics picked it up for distribution on DVD & Blu-Ray in 2014. This was one of my most anticipated releases for nearly 20 years and I'm glad to report it was worth the wait. I don't know the real story of why this film was held off for so long (from rumors that it was unfinished to rumors that the processing lab was holding the film until their bill was paid), but Daalder is best known for directing the cult film MASSACRE AT CENTRAL HIGH (1976) and the indescribable POPULATION: 1 (1986) and is also known for making one film every ten years (his next film was the bizarre documentary HERE IS ALWAYS SOMEWHERE ELSE in 2007), so to direct and write two films in one year is quite the feat for Daalder. I remember reading about it in FANGORIA back in the day and couldn't wait to see it, but I waited and waited with no news; nothing but rumors. It is also the final live action feature for actor Patrick McGoohan; (SCANNERS - 1981), who retired from acting in 1998 after doing a couple of TV appearances (including COLUMBO [1971 - 2003]; one of a few actors to put in four appearances as a villain and even directing four episodes of the series) and being called out of retirement in 2002 to voice an animated film before passing away early in 2009. This film contains some of Rene Daalder's best dialogue and the plot is about as ""out there"" as a film can get. Daalder has a really unique world-view and this film showcases it to great effect. The film opens in typical delirious Daalder fashion, where Dr. Dan Wyatt (Mark Bromilow) comes bursting through a door in an insane asylum, holding his neck, while Dr. Harvey Langston (McGoohan, with unkempt white hair) and his wheelchair-bound assistant Myrna Malloy (Amanda Plummer; SATAN'S LITTLE HELPER - 2004) yell at the retreating doctor ""Run, little rabbit, run!"" and ""Everyone is with him and all eyes are upon him!"" as if there is no escape. We watch the manic Dr. Wyatt run outside (while he imagines a crowd of mental patients chasing him) and takes off in his car, but a short way down the road his left arm and right arm act like they belong to different people. He hears, ""You are not alone!"" while his right hand tries to drive the car off the road. like it is possessed by someone else. While his left hand tries to take control of the car, he also hears, ""All for one and one for all"" (it will make sense shortly) and the right hand wins, almost causing a head-on collision and making the car to flip over. While hanging upside down, Dr. Wyatt's hands battle over a Zippo lighter while gasoline flows into the car. Again, the right hand wins, as the lighter is flicked and the car explodes. What caused a well-respected psychiatrist to go so insane? The police determine that is was due to Dr. Wyatt being drunk, but fellow colleague and friend Dr. Samuel Fry (Michael Maloney; LUNA - 2014) doesn't buy it, telling his soon-to-be ex-boss Dr Andrew Miller (David Francis) that his dead friend despised Dr. Langston and once called him a ""mad scientist"" for the methods he uses on his patients (Dr. Miller says this about Dr. Langston: ""A renegade psychiatrist forming a mysterious cult, sequestered away in a hidden mountain retreat. How romantic!""). The clinic that Dr. Fry is now working at is closing and Dr. Miller wants him to become a colleague at ""The Brain Spa"", a new psychiatric treatment center financed by Bob Biccardo (Louis De Bianco; the end credits lists his last name as ""Corrado"", but everyone is clearly saying ""Biccardo""), but Dr. Fry believes the new techniques that are going to be used at The Brain Spa are just a fad and may be dangerous for the patients (Dr. Miller replies, ""It's big in Japan!""). Mr. Biccardo asks the Oxford-trained Dr. Fry why he left England (Biccardo tells Fry that he attended Oxford for one semester and calls himself a ""summa cum f**k-up"") for the States and Dr. Fry says, ""The truth is, Mr. Biccardo, there are a lot more mental patients in America"", which infuriates Dr. Miller since Mr. Biccardo is his cash cow. Dr. Fry has scruples and believes that every patient deserves the same level of care no matter what is in their bank account and tells Dr. Miller that he is going to work at a free clinic, but Dr. Miller and Mr. Biccardo have more nefarious plans for him. Dr. Miller tells Fry that his patient, Veronica Bloom (Emmanuelle Vaugier; SAW II - 2005), is being freed (Dr. Miller sarcastically says, ""And free yourself in the process!""), but Dr. Fry doesn't believe she is ready. The clinic has already been emptied of most patients, who are sent to live with their families and when Veronica asks Dr. Fry why no one has come for her, he reminds her of the ""incident"" which sent her here. Veronica pitches a fit and says that she will let the voices in her head destroy her unless she can go with Dr. Fry. Dr. Fry decides to take her to Dr. Langston's clinic, but first he takes her to a picnic at the beach to see how she reacts to being out on her own. It ends badly when Veronica has some ants crawl on her and she strips topless and jumps in the water. Dr. Fry jumps in after her, but she tries to stab Dr. Fry with a corkscrew, forcing him to sedate her with a drug in a hypodermic needle. They drive to Dr. Langston's clinic and are greeted by wheelchair-bound Myrna, as an orderly takes a still-unconscious Veronica to her room. This is exactly what Dr. Miller and Mr. Biccardo wanted to happen, since Biccardo's son Bobby (Joseph Wynne), a bad stutterer, is a patient at the clinic and Dr. Langston refuses to release him to his family. Veronica was the perfect pawn (Chess does play an important part in this film) to set their plan in motion on getting him released. After noticing that the clinic is badly underlit (Myrna says that Dr. Langston purposely keeps the clinic dark because he believes ""Sickness is like a mushroom. Shine too much light on it and it retreats into the woodwork.""), Dr. Fry meets the obviously demented Dr. Langston, who shows him a collection of his patients. It seems that he has surgically inserted electronic transmitters behind their left ears in hope of creating one universal consciousness, or as Langston calls it, a ""group mind"", since he believes religion, normal therapy and drugs are useless. That night, Dr. Fry decides to investigate the asylum on his own (there are no bars on the windows and the front door has no locks), where someone behind one of the doors says, ""I know you are out there. I can smell you!"", a nymphomaniac bares her breasts to him, Myrna is forcing butch patient Blair (Joanne Vannicola) to dance around in a tutu and he sees Veronica being wheeled into an operating room, where Dr. Langston inserts an electronic transmitter behind her ear. Dr. Fry cannot stop him because a patient speaking gibberish is performing martial arts moves in front of the operating room door. When Blair (who speaks in rhyme or swears like a truck driver) tries to assault Dr. Fry in his room, he is saved by Dr. Langston, who recommends that he locks his door every night. Dr. Fry meets Veronica the next day and she seems like a changed woman. He also meets Bobby for the first time at Langston's insistence, since he believes Fry was sent here to take Bobby away. Fry assures Langston that he has no idea what he is talking about. Dr. Fry then watches one of the strangest group therapy sessions ever committed to film, as Langston plays the bongos and all the patients (including Veronica) dance around the room. When Dr. Fry tries to stop the session and is forced to punch one of the male patients in the face, he discovers that all the other patients feel the same pain, as if he punched them all in the face, too. Langston sedates Dr. Fry and implants a transmitter behind his left ear. He wants Dr. Fry to experience what all his other patients do and if he still wants to leave in 24 hours, Langston will remove the transmitter and gladly let him leave. Myrna holds her nightly ""dance therapy"" session, where Dr Fry, for the first time, discovers that he can dance fantastically with Veronica as his dance partner. That night, Dr. Fry and Veronica make love and we see all the patients feel the same erotic desires (Myrna talks throughout the whole act) and they all climax at the same time (The whole scene is as surreal as a film can get). It seems that Dr. Langston has truly created a ""group mind"", where everyone feels the same desires and emotions in equal measure. Langston's hope is to make the entire world a better place to live using his technique. Things go horribly wrong when Mr. & Mrs. Biccardo and Dr. Miller show up at the asylum and Mr. Biccardo demands that his son be returned to him since his stuttering hasn't gotten any better (Biccardo has also been financing this asylum!). Dr. Langston refuses and all the patients begin to stutter, while Dr. Fry strangles Dr. Miller and the rest of the inmates surround Mr. & Mrs. Biccardo. Dr. Fry discovers that it is Myrna, not Dr. Langston, who is the driving force behind this asylum (We watch as Myrna gets up out of her wheelchair dressed in a gold leotard and does the strangest interpretive dance your eyes can bear!), so Dr. Fry grabs Veronica and tries to escape the asylum (There's a funny scene where Fry kicks one of the inmates in his testicles and all the other inmates, including the female ones, grab their crotches in pain). After some kung fu fighting between Dr. Fry and Blair (the martial artist who speak gibberish shares his knowledge with Myrna), the couple escape in his car and drive to the nearest police station. While Veronica sits in the car unresponsive (Myrna tries to take over her body, but she is too far away), Dr. Fry discovers that Sheriff Grierson (Lorne Brass) is working in cahoots with Dr. Langston when he sees a chessboard with the pieces in the same position as the one in Dr. Langston's office (they are playing the game by phone). When Dr. Fry is unable to wake up Veronica, he has no choice but to return to the asylum, where he makes a horrible discovery: When he originally brought Veronica to the asylum, she was brain dead and in a coma thanks to an allergic reaction to the sedative he injected into her when she tried to kill him with the corkscrew. The only way she is able to survive is to stay at the asylum and use the ""group mind"" technique. It is also made clear that when he was making love to Veronica, he was actually making love to Myrna, who used Veronica as her puppet. Dr. Langston ends up dead when Dr. Fry pushes Myrna and her wheelchair down the stairs and the wheelchair strikes him in the head. A series of events happen when the Sheriff discovers Dr. Miller's dead body in the trunk of Dr. Fry's car, but when he enters the asylum all the patients explain to him what happened in verse, even Mr. & Mrs. Biccardo, who were not killed but had the transmitters implanted in their heads (therefore letting them spend all the time they want with their son). They blame both the deaths of Dr. Miller and Dr. Langston as the result of an argument they had with each other. The next thing we see is that Dr. Fry has taken over the asylum (this way he can be with Veronica forever, even though he knows that Myrna will be pulling her strings) as a line of taxis are at the asylum taking some of the patients away to the free world in hopes that ""group mind"" will infect the rest of the world. We then see a martial arts school, where every student has an incision behind their left ears. Maybe Dr. Langston wasn't so mad after all?  This is a weird and wonderful film that contains some excellent performances, especially by Patrick McGoohan and Amanda Plummer, who deliver some of Rene Daalder's dialogue with aplomb. (Example: ""You can't run. It's like trying to hide from your shadow.""). There's also plenty of nudity and foul language, but no blood or gore, because the terror here is of the psychological kind and you won't miss the red stuff one bit. The whole film looks like it was photographed a little off-kilter, as if to make us feel the same way the patients do in the asylum. Daalder proves he is great at dialogue and fills the film with black humor, such as when Myrna tells Dr. Fry, ""I won't stand for this!"" and Dr. Fry replies, ""Oh, you won't stand for anything!"". The only negative about the film is that the print Cult Epics uses for the DVD & Blu-Ray is sometimes scratchy (especially the sequence where Dr. Fry enters the police station), but my guess it was the best they could find since this is listed on the cover as the ""Director's Cut"". Still, this film is an amazing find and worth your time and effort to make part of your film library. Rene Daalder is one of the most unsung filmmakers of the past 40 years and this film is now one of my favorites. My highest recommendation. Also starring Gregory Hlady, Ralph Allison, Sam Stone, Lynn Snelling, Susan Glover, Rodrigue Proteau, Ren-Madeleine Le Guerrier, Gatan Gingras, Robert Higden and Jocelyne Zucco as Mrs. Biccardo (who flashes her breasts at the Sheriff when he visits the asylum). A Cult Epics Release. Not Rated.",1408406400,6,13524,4.535816618911174
