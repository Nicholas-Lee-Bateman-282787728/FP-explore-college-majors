Inadequacies based on our porn viewpoint of male size can really play havoc on male securities.  Kudos for Pat putting himself out there to address this problem.",1389139200,13,332,4.689655172413793
5969389,1,B00F7K5Q3O,"This movie is a scam. A stand-up comic figured he could get some publicity by pretending to have a tiny dick and making a pseudo-documentary (about as real as reality TV) about his travels all over the world, asking people in the street what they think about it (but never showing it) and looking to a few ""experts"" for a solution. The solution (surprise surprise) is that his only problem was thinking he had a problem, and he proves it by getting a dishy blonde to be his girlfriend.

I feel really stupid for buying this DVD, but maybe my stupidity will help somebody else make a smarter decision.",1387324800,13,600,4.504587155963303

Although the premise was about a man who felt he was rejected for having a small penis the film becomes a journey indicative of the journey we all must travel. Am I enough? Do I measure up ? And how do I find meaning and purpose despite the judgments of society?  Totally entertaining and, ultimately, very inspiring.  Highly recommended!",1386460800,18,399,5.015151515151516

5969399,5,B00F7K5Q3O,"I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was amazed at how important this film really is. Body-image seems to be so prevalent today, and plastic surgeons are cleaning up. Patrick Moote has laid it all out, courageously, to discover the answer to the age-old question, ""Does Size Matter?"". There's no clear answer, though any thinking human would know that substance of a person is most important.

The subject is one that, I'm sure, is of interest to many men, to beware of quick-fixes, pills, and witch doctors...as well as implants. This info is equally important to women. It's a $5-billion industry preying on innocent, good people. Patrick Moote compares his penis to a female with an A-cup. He goes all-out to find out how he can correct this, and travels the world to get opinions. Some of it's amusing, other parts are actually frightening.

The DVD is wonderful, and the extras are great, especially an interview with Dr. Dunas, and an extended interview with Dan Savage.

Anyone with a body-image problem should see this film. It's straight-forward, honest and to the point. Little is left to speculation, with no nudity. A few graphic scenes, but most are blurred out. The film is presented with honesty, sincerity and great information about being who you are, and not whom you think you might be. Just be yourself, and be the best person you can with what you have.

Mr. Moote is endearing, and quite adorable.",1408752000,,1418,4.799180327868853

5969404,3,B00F7K5Q3O,"Patrick Moote is certainly an engaging soul and deals with a theme (penis size) that apparently bothers an awful lot of younger men, to judge by the emails I tend to get with surprising frequency. I am an old man. The problem doesn't really interest me, if it ever did. But the lengths (so to speak) to which this documentary goes become a source of both fascination and outright amusement. If Moote was not just putting us on, I hope by now he's found a girl who likes him as he is and for who he is.",1403049600,,501,4.175257731958763

5969407,1,B00F7K5Q3O,"FAKE! FAKE! FAKE! I guess in today's celebrity culture and rehearsed/scripted/provoked ""reality"" programming it's more difficult for the viewing public to actually determine if an act being perpetrated as real is actually very unreal or not. A great example of this is another MOCKumentary, Catfish, made by two young men as celebrity-craving as Patrick Moote is here. Another obvious instance is the inspiration for this ""documentary"", the wedding proposal that was refused at a basketball game that ""somehow"" found its way to YouTube and went viral. The prank fumed of being staged, so poorly and obviously acted that anyone who believed it will surely believe a pig flying in a YouTube clip, and proving my point that people just don't know reality anymore. And now that this vanity project has followed that hoopla the confirmation of the proposal's veracity and Moote's true intentions have been proven. Aside from his appetite for attention, NOTHING in this film has a sincere feel about it. In fact, conversations with his mother, his brother, himself are so inauthentic they're almost awkward to watch. There's nothing satirical here, nothing ironic, nothing comical to indicate that Moote was in on the joke. The joke is Moote's apparent belief that he could manipulate an audience into finding his film spontaneous and valid. Watching such blatant dishonesty and someone's incapably disguised ulterior motives in a documentary is frustrating--not entertaining, not enlightening, and not informative. Had he skipped the proposal gag and this ridiculous stab at ""reality"" film making there might have been an indie film here with a semi interesting plot, but judging from the ethic, talent, and execution in Unhung Hero, it would have to be made by someone other than Patrick Moote.",1401321600,5,1790,5.2622377622377625
5969408,2,B00F7K5Q3O,"I'll be honest - I only watched ten minutes of this movie.  Perhaps I should have given it a chance, but the televised ""wedding proposal rejection"" seemed absolutely fake.  Staged.  From that point on I felt like I was being lied to.  So I started watching American Dad instead.",1401062400,4,278,4.612244897959184
5969409,4,B00F7K5Q3O,"When I first heard about this ""documentary"" I was really intrigued. The social pressures on women and their physical appearance is very well known in our culture and there have been many specials, talks, and other approaches to address the on going issue. However, the pressures on men isn't as well documented and I thought that this would be an interesting perspective to explore the insecurities of the other gender. Fast forward a few months and the reviews were less than encouraging for a potential viewer. Go down the road a few more weeks and I found myself watching this documentary while working on a project and I couldn't help but find myself distracted on occasion.

The short of it, Patrick Moote gets rejected publicly and it is due to his lower half being a little underwhelming. This inspires him to go on a journey to understand the importance of why size matters and what can be done about it. First he looks into his past by talking to friends from his adolescence to ex-girlfriends of recent. From there it goes to finding and using enhancers and exercises, finding out more about enhancers and exercises, and eventually traveling around to parts of the globe to see how other cultures view this topic, and finally back home with some insight on it all.

Let me just say that this isn't what we've come to expect from documentaries that we see on a regular basis. Whereas most documentaries will take a very specific problem and expand on exploring the causes, effects, and impact; Unhung Hero keeps it relatively focused with very little broadening of the material. The best we get are a few halfhearted interviews, a few minor statistics, and less than average witty animations. The majority of the film is Patrick exploring different methods on how to increase his anatomy and what extreme lengths there are to achieve a new personal best. He does speak with several specialists but it all seemed pretty superficial for some of them and they all seemed to end with the same theme: there is more to a man than his size.

This ""documentary"" honestly appears to be more of a joke than anything else with little stock put into it all. The ""hidden"" cameras and their repercussion scenes only serve as an annoyance and demonstrate how unprofessional they are in this area. A broader view of this topic would have been more effective than them just following Patrick around watching different ways to traumatize a person's penis. At the very least it could have lead to more perspective, facts, and much more in depth interviews. Some folks have stated that this is nothing more than a ploy to help launch Patrick's standup career. I can't agree with that since honestly I don't see this benefiting him professionally or socially.

Was this a good documentary: no. As a fact finding documentary it seemed very poorly thought out and sloppily put together. As a form of entertainment this is actually pretty decent if you keep your expectations relatively low. Not going to watch it again but if someone is curious about this title, don't let all the negative reviews make you hesitate from at least listening to this while getting some chores done around the house.",1399939200,,3182,4.790528233151184
5969410,3,B00F7K5Q3O,"I never heard of this guy or the massive publicity of becoming an internet sensation that spun this documentary. This poor guy got shot down when he proposed to his than girlfriend on a huge sporting even screen in front of hundreds of people. We find out later that the reason why he was denied was he was told that his penis was too small for her.
Well it seemed to me at that point that she obviously was a ""size Queen"" and that she was just a B**** to have turned him down for just that reason alone. But as I did feel sorry for him that she did that I felt that he should have just moved on, accepted that she wasn't who he thought she was and found someone else who was right for him.
Instead he obsessed over his small member that he never revealed how big it was or even shown it as to prove his point which made you feel as if he just might be making it up or it just wasn't good enough. He even goes as far as trying out all kinds of strategies to help lengthen his penis from pills, weights, pumps, and foods from all over the world. Even as going as far as pondering surgery.  Towards the end of this film he even ponders on wither it was a good idea to put this out there. He was so concerned that the entire world will know that he has small penis. Who cares if others or strangers know it when he seemed to have no issues with telling his mother, father, brother and all his friends.
 As some what entertaining I just couldn't get over that it took this man a bit of courage to admit he was small and all to his family and now to the world but that it took him to do all the things he did including this film to simply just accept who he was and to deal with it when it seemed kind of obvious to me.",1399420800,,1714,3.9508670520231215
5969411,2,B00F7K5Q3O,"A few of the interviews in this film were interesting, but aside from that it was a complete waste of time. Many parts were obviously contrived for the sake of drama. There were fake hidden camera scenes that were an annoying waste of time and a romance that seemed to have been created for the film. Patrick Moote never confirms the size of his penis or reveals it during the movie. The entire premise seems to have been created to sell the film and it leads me to believe that the initial failed proposal was a publicity stunt.",1397779200,10,529,4.408163265306122
5969412,4,B00F7K5Q3O,"""Does size matter?""

This seems to be the question on the minds of countless men and women in this over-sexed Age of Porn as ""comparison shopping"" pervades our daily love lives.

An over-confident young man plans an elaborate wedding proposal on live television during a major league game, only to have his ""intended"" refuse his plea. His humiliation was aired on U-Tube and scored over a million hits. When he later asked her why she turned him down, she explained that his penis was too small. Yikes!

This US documentary screened for a packed 2013 Seattle International Film Festival audience had more information about men and their ""packages"" than I ever want to see again! Eighty-four minutes of scams: witch-doctors, pumps, injections, pills, weights, massages, potions, lotions, notions, and many, many more dreams and schemes offered to our disconsolate swain.

We watched stand-up comic Patrick Moote embark on a wryly humorous international journey to find a ""cure"" for his slightly less-than-normal-size genitalia. He visits sex shops, therapists, and various spots in Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Hawaii, Europe and many more, only to return back to the U.S. where a local pundit reassures him that ""a handful is all you need.""

In my opinion, his best two bits of advice came from 1) His mother, and 2) Dan Savage, a Seattle columnist.

I would like to add that 50% of the audience was riveted by this documentary and the rest of us certainly were NOT bored. (Although I hid my eyes a couple of times.)

I thought the production value was surprisingly good, and the scenes employed the use of a hand-held camera were well-spaced and used to the proper effect.

It was very interesting to see how penis size is viewed throughout the world and by different cultures. I had no idea there are actually ceremonies held in it's honor!
I came away feeling sorry for any man that would be that obsessed with the size of his penis that it affects his life to this degree. Again...I am certain Patrick is fine...and some of this was exaggerated for Hollywood purposes.  My only one complaint...and surprise...I find it comical that despite the subject matter....you never actually see either Patrick's or any other man's penis throughout the whole documentary.

8612863,3,B00F7K5Q3O,"Funny is sometimes hard to define. This is an amusing movie once you get the hang of what the guys problem is. There should probably be a short tutorial video at the beginning for guys to help understand the definition of small compare to normal.  And maybe a measuring rod from Tim the Tool Man Taylor.

Whats really missing is, um, having the guy demonstrate his issue, or should we say what he was issued.  And of course theres the question of exactly how does he know how he measures up to the rest of us?

To be frank (or hot dogs if you prefer) this is one of the better mockumentaries Ive seen.  Some of it borders on being believable. Some of it is as funny as anything you would see in Young Frankenstein.  Hey, come to think if it, wouldnt that have been the easy answer to his situation  simply have a new one sewn on?

The guy who plays the lead part, and his part, is a dork.  If you didn't guess that from the title of the movie, no I mean hes a real dork.  He was probably chosen over a better looking guy (could I have phrased that better?) so theaters wouldnt have to turn the A/C up.  Hes quasi-attractive and quasi-funny and 100% dorky.

Was it funny?  Yes?  Would I watch it sober?  Um, Ill get back to you on that.  Would I recommend it?  Why not?

And I appreciated Patrick Moote representing the 50%, even if I'm not so sure he actually fits into that category.  But then, the interviews with his friends and family felt pretty real.

Anyway, I think it's best to view it as a real service to people just by bringing up the issue.  I think what is missing is that some of the real things that someone would have done just aren't here.  Where are the scenes of him trying to find women who are into smaller guys?  Or commiserating with his fellow unhung heroes?

In the end, Patrick gets a hot sexy girlfriend who he just managed to meet more than once.  That part felt either fake, or like it was a recreation of what really happened.  Did that bother me?  Not really, but I would have appreciated the conversation where Patrick asks whether being unhung is a deal breaker for her.",1447977600,,1010,4.405405405405405
8612868,2,B00F7K5Q3O,"Unhung Hero isn't good.  It's pretty terrible in fact.  After proposing to his wife at a sporting event only to be turned down because of his small package, Patrick Moote sets out on a mission across the world to find out if women are really annoyed/dissatisfied by their boyfriend or husbands small wiener.  Patrick even goes around interviewing women on the streets and surprise surprise, they all say they prefer big ones.  If you're a guy who's self-conscious about this subject matter I have good news- this whole ""documentary"" is probably staged.  In fact the more I think about it, it just has to be staged.  All of it except when Patrick visits Asia and the condom factory (hey, condoms of different sizes have to be manufactured somewhere).

Unhung Hero makes it look like all women you come into contact with except your own mother won't even consider being with a guy if he's not built for size, but the truth is none of that matters.  Patrick travels to all the wrong places.  It's like wondering if meat really matters to a dog and travelling to butcher shops and slaughterhouses to find out more.  Of course it does.  In this case Patrick travels to wiener and nipple pumping doctors, porn star conventions (gee no kidding THEY'D care about a bigger size), and perhaps the only one that looks believable, his mom and dad to explain why Patrick's girl didn't want to marry him.  At least his parents reaction seemed realistic but again, it probably wasn't.  This silly mockumentary/documentary unintentionally makes women look shallow, so women should be offended by it too.  I even question if the female doctor Patrick visits is real.  Sure didn't sound like it.

What really makes Unhung Hero look lame is that there's a ton of better documentaries out there that focus on realistic problems around the world.  This one is all about making jokes over trivial stuff, so I recommend skipping it.  Unhung Hero inadvertently makes all small wiener jokes seem like a serious matter which is another area of disappointment.",1441411200,,2033,4.826589595375722
