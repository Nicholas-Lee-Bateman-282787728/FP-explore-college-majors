8187508,5,B000OYAT0S,"This has got to be one of the best live concerts with incredibly beautiful music that I've seen in a long time.  I'm a huge Genesis, Marillion, Pendragon, and Porcupine Tree fan.  If you're looking for hard thunderous rock then you're looking in the wrong place.  Try Porcupine Tree.  This DVD makes me think of David Gilmour of Pink Floyd and his style of playing as well as some Eric Clapton.  Funny enough, I like some Pink Floyd and very little Clapton.  The lead guitar playing and lead vocals of Nick Barrett are mesmerizing to say the least.  These songs and every single one on there makes me feel emotional because of the beauty and rythym that the boys from Pendragon put together.  I have Passion and Pure  and don't like them as much as the music from this DVD (I know I'm probably in the minority here) which is evidently from The Jewell - their first album (I obviously don't have it).  I highly recommend this DVD to the romantics out there who just love to sing a long and watch this concert time and time again without getting bored.  Bravo Pendragon!",1359417600,2,1068,4.481865284974093
8187509,5,B000OYAT0S,"This is indeed a wonderful live recording. I personally feel that the Jewel was Pendragon's best CD, including the line-up. To see the tracks performed on DVD is as good as seeing the band on stage. Nick Barret hasn't lost his voice and blends well with the music. It was great to see Rick Carter back on keyboards. This is a definite must for Pendragon fans and progressive rock fans alike. Buy this if you are into Genesis and Camel. You won't be disappointed",1190937600,9,461,4.5
