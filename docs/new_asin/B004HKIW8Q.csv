8497578,4,B004HKIW8Q,"This is a beautifully composed, idyllic but believable view of children's lives in a village on a lake, far from the city where many of their adult relatives have moved away for better income and more sophisticated, hectic lives. The unhurried pace and simple dialogue gave me the feeling that I was present among children enjoying their freedom to run through fields, row out on the lake, climb rocky hills, and play in the bamboo thickets, with no adult supervision-- like kids growing up in the country anywhere.  The story takes place over the New Year's vacation, so customs typical of the celebration are shown, including non-stop throwing of firecrackers.  A cousin from the city is visiting, and delights all the kids with his magnificent remote-control airplane. His adoring sidekick is the 8-yr old little sister of the family, whose pig-tailed, earnest cuteness is a big part of this movie's charm. She is saving money so she can go to school by gathering herbs, carrying them to market to sell in their rowboat.
The popularity of the visiting cousin provokes jealousy in the alpha boy of the community, who goes home and demands his father buy him a plane too. When dad returns from town with the only kind of gift he could afford, the self-centered ""king of the village"" pouts and complains.  In contrast to the other children, this boy speaks to his parents very rudely.  This ""bully's"" subtle transition of character, thanks to the generous-spirited friendship of the other boys, is central to the movie's moral theme.
The only problem with this film is that the English subtitles are white and in many scenes blend into the background.  However, the straightforward, simplicity of the story makes translation almost unnecessary.  Appropriate for even young children, but at 1:28, a bit long to keep their attention in one sitting.",1343174400,,1846,4.957928802588997
