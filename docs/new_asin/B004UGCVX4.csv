4467042,5,B004UGCVX4,I love the Heartland series. All the characters are so perfect for their role.  Great country and awesome horse encounters.  I really like how they work with the horses and use their intuition.  As Amy says I am not a horse wisperer I listen to the horse.  That is what it is all about.  Keep them coming and please get the 4th season soon.,1315872000,,340,4.25
4467043,5,B004UGCVX4,"The third season of Heartland is truly the best, by far, yet.  I thought the first season centered on horses; the second season focused a bit too much on personal drama.  But the third season contained well developed relationships and horses, horses, horses!

I can't wait for Season 4!!",1313625600,3,287,4.816326530612245

When it arrived the package had been opened and when we watched the first eight episodes they were all from season two.  We then watched the final two episodes they were new.  All of the packaging was labeled season three.

When I received it I checked it out and found I can choose English, great, no problem so far. I wasn't ready to watch Season 3 until today and discovered this version has most of Season 2 and only 4 new episodes. So I paid around $27 for 4 episodes? Now do I order Season 3 of As Seen On GMC version? Will I get more episodes? Does anyone know? Or is Season 3 a rip off on both versions?",1415491200,3,534,3.908256880733945

4467072,1,B004UGCVX4,"I have the UpTv versions of season 1 and 2 and this season includes most of UpTv's season 2, along with 4 episodes I have not seen. I feel like an idiot because I didn't read the reviews of this DVD set where many people explained this...could have saved myself some headache. However, the reason I gave this a 1-star review is that the picture quality is so terrible I just had to send it back to the seller. There is no way that Entertainment ONE would allow this crappy picture quality and I think this set may be a copy instead of the original. I don't want to accuse anyone, however, I would recommend against this DVD set and go for the UpTv's version...no foul language and the picture quality is leaps and bounds better.",1407888000,2,728,4.360294117647059

Since there were much fewer episodes on the remaining discs I'm not sure I feel confident I've seen the third season. I will purchase the fourth season to see how I feel then...

This disc set was different than the first two season sets that were given to me as gifts...I'm not sure why the difference in the way they were set up and that many episodes were repeated from my first set of Season 2 on this new one.",1391040000,,587,4.1946902654867255

4467096,5,B004UGCVX4,"I love watching this series. The characters are so enthralling and the family drama is fit for people of all ages to watch.  It is a perfect show for everyone to follow.  They have great times and hardships like anyone else and you can see how they work together for a happier outcome. They make mistakes and it doesn't always have a happy ending.

4467115,5,B004UGCVX4,"'Heartland' is great TV for the ENTIRE FAMILY, without all the horrendous Hollywood trash that basically every other TV show produced today has.  * Most TV today is a race to the bottom of the toilet bowl - NOT THIS SHOW.

On Heartland (in the first 3 seasons at least) you will see no sexed-crazed anything, no poor 6th grader potty-jokes, basically no foul innuendo, no ""sexual-situations"", even if it is loaded with teen relationships.

This show is somewhat similar to 'Eight is Enough' and the 'Waltons,' only it is focused on horse farming/horse rescue/ranching.  The lead actor is Amy, a high-schooler who carries a full time job as well and deals with heavy work loads, very successfully too.  A great role model for any girl. She and her family have their heartbreaks and they deal with them one day at a time. In the first few seasons, the strong character -and integrity- of the family comes out and each person is seen growing and maturing in what can be called honest development. While many of characters have broken families, this family relies on the family to solve it's problems.

Filmed in Alberta Canada, the show often feels like a movie - - The mountain scenery is stunning and the horses are fantastic: from rodeo horses, to Olympic jumping horses, to cattle ranching & cutting horses, to wild mustangs, to newborn foals and high value race horses they cover the spectrum.  But the show goes beyond just the horses - plenty of cowboys/cowgirls and city slickers add to every episode, both young and old.

The show has villains of course, and they contrast the lead roles well.  There are a few fights and a few are pretty intense.  But everything works to the Good.  The grandfather has high expectations and that sense of character flows through the entire show - rarely seen in TV today.

I highly recommend Heartland for the entire family.",1373500800,,1865,4.739938080495356

4467122,5,B004UGCVX4,"I gave this 5 stars because this is the best program I've seen in quite awhile and it showed up quickly and in excellent condition.

Delivery & Quality: The product arrived quickly and was packaged well. It is a cardstock box with an opening at one end for thin, plastic dvd holders to insert in and the pictures are of good quality.

The Show: I started watching this show on Netflix and was so hooked that when they cut off mid 3rd season (one thing I hate about Netflix), I decided to just get all the DVDs so that I could continue to enjoy this program. It's about a teenage girl whose mother died and is being reared by her grandfather on a horse ranch with her sister and other characters. Her job is working with the horses as she has a special gift and understanding for them. There are many characters in the show that you'll get used to and know who they are (although new characters get introduced, there is none of this constant changing of characters like I've seen in some programs). This show is also full of adventure, love of family, and respectfulness as well as romances and life challenges. All-in-all an excellent show",1371859200,,1139,4.471153846153846

4467124,5,B004UGCVX4,"I absolutely love this series. I love horses, I've been involved in horse rescues so I can relate to it. Although I am no where near the trainer Amy is portrayed as being. I have taught three horses to drive. I am 77 and my husband is 80 and we still ride and drive. That is my claim to fame.
I could do without the tarot cards (past seasons) and sleeping around (Lou's character in past seasons). Otherwise it is tasteful and something a Christian can watch.
Keep it up and keep it moral.

4467166,1,B004UGCVX4,"I own EVERY Season of Heartland on DVD and every single set I have owned (bought brand new mind you) has been terrible quality. The characters look grainy and the colors are very washed out. The odd thing is that the episodes on Netflix are almost HD quality so I don't get it. It seems as though whomever is converting it to the dvds is doing a shoddy job.

My husband walked in while I was watching (he is an Engineer) and said ""Wow, that looks like a VHS"" and that is exactly what it looks like. We have two HD TVs and I have watched it on both TVs and still the same results. I think they are cutting corners and using a crappy company to do their conversions. I feel a little ripped off to be honest. Especially since I am such a loyal fan and this is one of the biggest shows in Canada so its not like they are low on budget. If you can get your episodes any other way Netflix, iTunes, etc...I would do that. I know its nice to have the box sets , but believe me when I say its not worth the $45.

Unfortunately I live in the US so I have no choice, but to buy the box sets since Netflix takes forever to post the seasons up and apparently there is a Canadian iTunes and a USA iTunes so it won't let me buy the episodes through their because they are only offered to Canadians.

If you have a choice skip the DVDS as they are terrible quality. I actually just bought Season 5 and its so grainy that I have been watching it on YouTube, thats how sad it is. I own the Dvds and I am having to resort to YouTube to watch it because the quality is so annoying. I even played one episode on Netflix on one TV and then the exact same episode from the DVD on my other TV and the difference in quality was astounding!! The Netflix version had vibrant colors and no graininess and the DVD version was very washed out (think VHS from the 90's).",1348876800,17,1839,4.032876712328767

4467169,5,B004UGCVX4,"This spring, my sister and I saw a commercial on GMC (Gospel Music Channel) for a television show called Heartland that would be aired from the beginning of the series. We decided to watch and see if we liked it. We LOVE this show and watched each Wednesday night when two episodes were aired. Waiting for the next week was difficult, as the characters are so likable and the stories so well written and acted. I decided to purchase Seasons 1-4 so that we could watch whenever we wanted and not have to wait for Wednesday nights. There is never a dull moment as Amy's mother, Marion, is killed in an accident in the very first episode and she, and her sister, Lou, and their grandfather, Jack, have to keep Heartland ranch running. Ty and Mallory become important members of the Bartlett-Fleming family and Jack loves and guides all four of the younger characters. There are other characters that, in the beginning, you may not like, but will grow to love over time - Caleb and Ashley. We have watched every episode in Seasons 1-4 and can honestly say that there is not a single episode that we did not enjoy. Each one was excellent. We even purchased A Heartland Christmas and thoroughly enjoyed that as well. The viewer learns a lesson along with the characters as they work with the horses and each other that leaves you feeling good at the end of the hour. There are many shows on television today that have no plot or characters with any depth. Heartland certainly stands above so much of what is on television. It is something that anyone, young or old, can watch and enjoy. The location (Alberta, Canada, in the Rocky Mountains) is absolutely gorgeous as well and adds even more to the show. We cannot wait for the fifth season (and future seasons) and we will purchase the DVDs as soon as they are available.",1342310400,2,1816,4.556574923547401

Amazon handled issue quickly and satisfactorily, including the question about

4467188,5,B004UGCVX4,"In season 3, we continue to follow the trials and tribulations of Amy and Ty and the rest of the clan.  I originally found this series by accident on Netflix and fell in love with it.  Due to some kind of law, we can't stream from the CBC site to watch the series that way, so, at my 10 year old daughter's insistence, I paid the cost to get the 3rd season on DVD.

To be honest, the picture quality wasn't crystal clear - that's DVDs for you.  I had much better picture streaming from Netflix for past episodes.  However, my daughter fell so hard in love with Heartland that she is actually reading the book series, which is actually set here in Virginia.  She's also now horse crazy and is anxiously awaiting a Horse magazine that I ordered for her.

I felt that season 3 was a good continuation from season 2 and anxiously await the release of season 4 to DVD so we can continue to watch this show.  If I had to describe it, I'd call it a more modern take on Little House on the Prairie.  The characters are strong, yet have their moral compass correctly set (for the most part).  Remember, though, if you see alcohol being drank in scenes that this is a Canadian show.  The drinking age is lower up there.

Overall, we loved season 3 and it left us wanting for season 4.",1316044800,,1274,4.240663900414938
