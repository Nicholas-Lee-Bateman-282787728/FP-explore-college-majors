8405594,3,B003U1YV88,this is from a time long ago when pupits and marionets were cheap and populare...the stop action that had to be used...long befor the computer...no CGI here you see all the bloopers...and it has its own history in broadcast...go to the chicago broadcast museum and take it for what it is in its own time...,1385251200,,306,4.581818181818182
8405595,5,B003U1YV88,"Nowadays I often wonder how children experience the holidays, and that question always comes to mind when I watch these 2 Claymation/stop-action cartoons, ""Hardrock, Coco and Joe,"" and ""Here Comes Suzy Snowflake.""  They were created in the 1950s as advertising for a Chicago furniture firm, though the firm's name does not intrude on the cartoons themselves. They were shown on TV during commercial breaks in the holiday season in the 1950s; I glimpsed them, albeit rarely, into the 1980s.  Since then they've vanished,  at least in the parts of the US where I've lived.  I've been delighted to have them again on DVD, re-issued commercially by the same furniture company.  (The DVD does include some advertising for the company, but it's done in a very lighthearted way by the now-adult sons of the firm's founder.  Their memories of the cartoons are a delight to hear.)

""Hardrock, Coco and Joe"" deals with 3 of Santa's helpers who accompany him as he takes his sleigh around the world on Christmas Eve.  The art work here is a little puzzling; to adult eyes it looks like Santa had more than a bit too much holiday cheer before he left the North Pole.  ""Suzy Snowflake"" is an elegiac look at the brief life of a lady snowflake who softly descends to help children build snowmen or take sleigh rides.  Both are accompanied by vocal numbers specially composed to illustrate what's happening.  The tunes are jaunty, and the words easily understood by young viewers.

If you have any desire to show your kids or grandkids what Christmas season was like decades ago, don't hesitate to invest in this gem.  The film is grainy, and I suspect original footage was used; the sound is also what you'd expect from original 1950s footage that clearly hasn't been digitally restored.  But you can't really put that kind of price tag on memories like this.",1372550400,,1845,4.7974683544303796
8405596,5,B003U1YV88,"I bought this EXACT DVD at a consignment store for $2.99........the videos are great to have as a keepsake, but only @ 5 minutes long each...I'm excited to have it, but did not spend a fortune...look around!!!!!",1355961600,3,211,4.72972972972973
8405597,5,B003U1YV88,"As young children, my two brothers and I so loved this animated short, when it was played here in the Wash DC area, we knew that Santa would soon be on his way. I am surprised how tough it has been to find a copy of it, and am grateful that the Walter E. Smith furniture company put it out as a promo DVD back in 2004. Although it looks like it was copied from a VHS tape, it is still a joy to see it again. Thanks to Loquasto for reselling it a fair price ($15.00), and it arrived in great shape. It would be great if Amazon or iTunes would use their clout to locate a perfect copy, and offer it to the whole world.",1354233600,7,616,3.858267716535433
