8343739,5,B001UHO0TY,"For those of you who haven't seen the old British Series, 'Black Adder': you simply must!  I am a big Rowan Atkinson fan, but did not know who he was when I first started watching this show many years ago.  I became a huge fan and recommend it to everyone I know.  It's also where i first discovered Hugh Laurie and became a follower of his as well.  This is right up there with 'Faulty Towers' as far as humor and silliness.  This was a great purchase.",1390953600,,453,4.160919540229885
8343740,4,B001UHO0TY,I ordered this for a christmas gift for my husband.  I was told it won't make it till 1st week of January 2014.  But came Dec. 23 and I was so happy.  The only thing that I wasn't aware is that it won't play in our XBOX because its a REGIONAL.  But was able to play with our laptop and connect HDMI in our TV so we can enjoy bigger screen.,1388448000,2,339,3.732394366197183
8343741,2,B001UHO0TY,"The product may be ok, but the DVD set I bought from MovieMars was Region 2 (UK) and could not be played on most US DVD players. This was not mentioned in the item description. Let's hope they will add that soon. So unless you have a special DVD player that can play DVDs from all regions, better be prepared to return the item, buy a new DVD player, resell it, or let it sit on your shelf.
Thank goodness Amazon has a A-Z guarantee, now I just have to buy the item again in the correct version and wait another week or so to receive it.
In short, it will save you time and frustration to spend a few extra dollars and buy the correct item from Amazon and not take a chance on some of the less reliable dealers.",1370649600,6,711,4.049645390070922
8343742,5,B001UHO0TY,"Black Adder is unlike any TV series done before or since, a very silly, but also
very smart comedy, each season took place about a hundred years later than
the series before, but always with Rowan Atkinson playing Backadder. However
each time not only the basic situation and story, but also Blackadder's character
was different. True, he's basically always looking out for himself, but in one season
he might be a sniveling simp, the next might find him dashing, handsome and
caustically witty. Some of the key supporting actors (including an the wonderful
Tony Robinson, and the always hysterical Hugh Laurie) go from season to season,
with Laurie playing a bevy of different roles, and Robinson the one true constant
as Blackadder's sad-sack abused and not very bright sidekick.

So rather than a TV series as we generally know it, what we really have is 4 different
series, in different eras, held together by casting. Even the theme song is re-worked
each time (although using the same basic tune)

By casting from such a wide net, from setting it in the era of Richard III for season
1 (and getting in some wicked parody of the Shakespeare play), to the dark
absurdity of WW I by the last, we really have an overview of time that makes the
series resonate long after you finish it.

While personally I find, for example, Fawlty Towers and Monty Python more
consistently laugh out loud funny, I find I remember more of the story and
characters from Blackadder.

I'd urge everyone to give it a look, and keep in mind that the many find the
first season the most heady, and least funny. It grows from there.

The quality on the remastered edition is a step up from the older DVDs,
but is far from spectacular, and really, no one is buying Blackadder for
visual quality anyway. So if you want to save money, and the earlier version
is cheaper, you're not losing much.",1347840000,6,1869,4.651515151515151
