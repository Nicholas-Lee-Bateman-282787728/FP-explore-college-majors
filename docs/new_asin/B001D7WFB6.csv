3526799,5,B001D7WFB6,"This show has not been seen on PBS for many many years now (at least not in my area) and so happy to get this finally on DVD.
Note:  if you get this one, the funniest thing in the world is the segment entitled ""the funeral"".  Laughed myself silly.  If you get this
DVD  watch for that segment... oranges will never seem the same to me. !!!!!",1354147200,,341,4.044776119402985
3526800,5,B001D7WFB6,"A good comedy series from Australia about the adventures of Arthur and his mother Maggie as Arthur takes care of his aging and ever more forgetful (or is she?) mother. While this show is definitely a comedy, it isn't afraid to tackle some of the fears and frustrations of growing old, and of caring for a loved one that is getting older. However, this show never strays too far from the comedy in the situation and, somehow, everything works out in the end. Well acted and well written. Ruth Cracknell and Garry McDonald are talented actors, and do an excellent job of creating three dimensional characters in a genre that is often very two dimensional. I enjoy this series.",1353456000,,674,4.6722689075630255
3526801,5,B001D7WFB6,"This is a request for the rest of the Mother and Son seasons to be released. Please.
This is an amusing romp through the oft-ignored aspects of living with relatives long after their 'better years' are past. The humor and warmth of the characters is funny and not without the poignant moments, not to the point of being soap-boxy. However, it is apparent, that to 'put mum in a home' is just the chant of a cad and so one learns to live with what will one day envelope us all...old age. This is done with such comical finesse that one watches this show just for it's comedy.
This entire series must be released for us.",1324857600,7,618,4.336206896551724
3526802,5,B001D7WFB6,"This is such a GREAT Australian series! This show aired with Six-Seasons from 1983 through 1993 and had a total of (42) episodes.  I used to watch it in the eighties when they aired in the USA on a PBS Station.  I have both Season 1 & 2, and Im still waiting years later for Seasons 3,4,5 & 6.  Whats the hold-up!?? Im not getting any younger!  I'd like to see the rest of the shows before I end up like old Maggie...Does Amazon have a 'request/suggestion' section?  Let Amazon know what you think.  These DVDS are really worth it!  PS: also check out 'One Foot In The Grave""",1300752000,13,575,4.220183486238532
3526803,5,B001D7WFB6,I love this! I used to watch it with my kids years ago. I have looked for the series for quite some time and was so thrilled that I was able to find it.,1281225600,3,152,3.5
3526804,5,B001D7WFB6,"I used to watch this series on PBS and just loved it. I was delighted when Amazon
included this in their 'offerings' - have purchased Series 1 and 2 and am hoping
that the rest of the series will follow but I contacted the Australian distributors
and it seems they have no plans for future episodes to be released so far.  I hope
I don't end up like Maggie with her 'senior moments' but I think I am on the way!!",1257033600,7,412,4.08641975308642
3526805,5,B001D7WFB6,"If you like British comedies, you'll love this. The characters are hilarious - especially the Mother. I first saw one episode while visiting England and was delighted to find both Season 1 and Season 2 on Amazon. I'm hoping for Season 3 to be out soon.",1232150400,,252,4.5
3526806,4,B001D7WFB6,a very funny australian comedy series shown on pbs a while back and never seen again. I don't why?,1228608000,,98,4.2105263157894735
3526807,5,B001D7WFB6,"This is a wonderful dvd set for the person who likes clean comedy. It is based on a mother, who her family thinks has lost her marbles but isn't quite sure if that's it or if she is just crazy like a fox. Ruth Cracknell does a great job portraying the mother, maggie, who's son arthur lives with her and helps look out for her. It's funny from start to finish. I love this dvd set and look forward to the next season on dvd!",1227571200,4,424,4.0

8292143,5,B001D7WFB6,I couldn't believe I found these after all these years.  Can't wait to watch the episodes.  Order came like lightning speed.,1419292800,,124,4.857142857142857

8292145,5,B001D7WFB6,I watched this show with my mother when I was a young teenager. I had to look online for a while to figure out what show this was. I was very happy to find it and be able to purchase it. It is just as funny as I remember.,1395964800,,221,3.5306122448979593
8292146,5,B001D7WFB6,"I loved this show in the 80s on PBS
I was excited when it finally came out on DVD but after several years passed with only season 1 and 2 ever having been released in the states I broke down and bought a multi region DVD player so that I could order the entire box set of Mother and Son (along with some other dvd favorites that won't play in this country)straight from Australia where it was released years ago. The entire boxed set containing seasons 1 through 6 was cheaper than trying to buy them all individually anyway. I highly recommend this show, but I do think the price is a bit ridiculous, and that is probably why the rest of the series has not been released in the USA.",1369612800,4,683,4.221374045801527
8292147,4,B001D7WFB6,"I liked it and would like to get more of the series.  I have the first and second seasons on DVD but do not know if the show went to a third season.  If so, I would like to purchase the DVD for it.",1369180800,,197,3.4545454545454546
8292148,5,B001D7WFB6,"Absolutely the funniest possible TV show...I might be prejudiced, being a life long bachelor living in close proximity to my mother... still, never laughed so hard. Me dear ol' Mum laughed too. Searched for this video a long time, having once seen a few episodes on PBS years ago. Every family has experienced these situations, presented here in the epitome of British (actually Australian) humor. You will NOT be disappointed.",1356652800,,427,5.114285714285714
8292149,5,B001D7WFB6,"I liked this as a series here in Australia,and after living with my husbands Alzheimer's for 6 years ..I can still smile..wonderful acting by all.. Both are well known here for their stage and film work. Though Ruth has passed away, she is not forgotten",1356048000,,253,4.644444444444445
