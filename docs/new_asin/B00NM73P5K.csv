As written she must have worked for the worlds dumbest police department. But it is ""B"" movie fun and Julie does a good job with what she was given.",1486425600,,260,3.9245283018867925
8679109,3,B00NM73P5K,"I originally saw this on Lifetime television and found myself spellbound. I couldn't turn it off. Originally it bore the title SOLE CUSTODY but remains a very good movie worth watching for Julie Benz who plays a cybercop and wife and mother who's husband's infidelity has led to a divorce which soon has deadly consiquences as the husband frames his wife for the ""murder"" of their child and she's been accused of being an arsonist. Buy it and watch it for the outcome. I promise, you will enjoy is. Especially the ladies. The only reason I give this movie 3 stars is because for a 90 minute movie, it's terribly uneven but remains a very good movie and worth watching. Enjoy.",1461110400,,675,4.586776859504132

8679111,4,B00NM73P5K,"I love Julie Benz portraying any type of character from Darla in ""Angel"" or ""Buffy"" where I saw her character for the first time through her survival with the help of ""Rambo"" to the Syfy show ""Defiance"" which is one of my favorites now.
The Arsonist plot was simple but Julie did a great job of drawing the audience in after being accused of being an arsonist.  She changed her looks to get away in a very drab ""living on the street' outfit.  There aren't many twists in the plot so I won't give away the ending.  It was an enjoyable movie to watch and didn't think that is got slow anywhere.  If you are a fan of Julie's then you should watch it to see how well she brings out a character.  Well, maybe it's just that she just has this charisma that works all the time.  :)",1443571200,,774,4.1610738255033555

8679113,1,B00NM73P5K,"Zooey (Julie Benz) and Barry (Rick Ravanello) are a married couple on the police force working different shifts, tag teaming raising their child Timmy (Maxwell Kovach) along with a babysitter (Chelah Horsdal). Zooey is busy at work attempting to entrap a serial rapist while Barry has to always work late and enjoys the company of other women. When arson kills Timmy, Zooey is blamed for starting the fire. We the audience know for a fact she was framed because the mystery aspect of the film was very poor due to lack of suspect development.

This is a made for TV film originally entitled ""Sole Custody.""  The acting and plot were lame. The most provocative thing about the film was a child's book ""Peter Tugboat.""  Fans of Lifetime type films might like it, I shook my head almost all the way through, especially at the editing which decided to give you clips of future events because they had to extend the feature to 90 minutes.",1422489600,,933,4.676829268292683
8679114,4,B00NM73P5K,"The movie was good, clever, and worthwhile.

I like that Julie Benz's character showed persistence in order to clear her name, disguised as someone else, and let everyone find out the truth regarding her son Timmy's ""death"".

This movie should be on Lifetime...or if it was on that channel, then that is great.",1418083200,,310,4.830188679245283
