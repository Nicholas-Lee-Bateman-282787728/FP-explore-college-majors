8738198,1,B0176YXSR4,"this is at the least poor sales work and at the worst deceptive sales.  I hate amazon postings that cant give clear information on what you are buying.  This is a perfect example.  The title shows that this is a bluray, the Amazon title says that it is a Bluray/DVD, but product description shows that it is DVD only.  So who knows what you are buying?",1511827200,,352,4.287878787878788
