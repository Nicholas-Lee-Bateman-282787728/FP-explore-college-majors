8224763,3,B000WOYS5C,I thought this would give me some insight to the Maui vacation weeks away. This DVD was really light on information. Just a glance over of the major highlights of each island. I feel I learned more from the Fodor's travel book I also read. I bought the used version because I couldn't find it for rent. I paid $10 but feel it's only worth $5.,1330214400,,342,4.196969696969697
8224764,5,B000WOYS5C,Excellent family oriented travel video; we're heading to Maui at Christmas and will likely use this video as our guide for what to do with families,1202860800,2,147,4.6923076923076925
8224765,5,B000WOYS5C,"It gave the whole family a good visual look at what Maui had to offer before traveling there, so we could each choose something that we wanted to do.",1181260800,2,149,4.172413793103448
8224766,4,B000WOYS5C,"As a former resident of the Island of Molokai, I thoroughly enjoyed this visual tour. The filmmakers effectively showed the tourist (and non-tourist) attractions of the island and went into helpful detail as to what to expect in each location. From the East end to the West end, the covered everything. The coverage of Maui was equally in-depth, but obviously there's much more on that island, so there's more to cover and more to leave out.

Overall, this is a great DVD to help get a visual idea of the trip you might take with a family to Molokai. I don't think that this video takes the place of a travel book or online research, though, and the price is a little steep for an hour long video. But if you want a preview of what you're going to see on these two islands, this is the DVD for you.",1176854400,3,798,4.32
