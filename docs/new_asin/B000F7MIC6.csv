2554541,5,B000F7MIC6,"The mothers were absolutely the best choice for their characters and the
two young men the same.  They each were so believable.  The story is about two homosexual young men, one dying from Aids and hasn't seen his mother in 15 years.  His partner wants his mother( a very busy and important executive) to go and tell the other mother( a waitress who lives in a trailer park in Arkansas) her son is dying and, hopefully bring her back.",1372464000,,434,4.468354430379747
2554542,5,B000F7MIC6,"A fine, insightful take on modern marriage with its compromises and unique solutions.  Suitable for adults who want to relax and be entertained.",1366675200,,144,5.260869565217392
2554543,5,B000F7MIC6,"I love Julie Andrews and Marcello Mastronianni for different reasons, but to see both in the same film is a miracle of acting, good taste and deep feelings. You don't need to see their spouses, because the story is between them, and believe me, you'll have a unforgettable romance before your eyes. It's a masterpiece totally underrated.",1361145600,,337,4.9298245614035086
2554544,4,B000F7MIC6,I enjoyed the way Julie's character changed in the movie.  It was interesting and fun!  Both characteres evolved as the movie played.,1324425600,,133,5.0
2554545,2,B000F7MIC6,"Not much in the way of a romance, fine or otherwise.  She's cold and stuffy, he's a pathetic buffoon.  They fuss and fume over being dumped by their spouses.  The only thing they have in common is her spouse is now with his.  The rest of the movie is a tepid plot to regain what they've lost (she repeatedly demands that he come up with a means of getting her husband away from his wife and is quite putout when he won't cooperate).  Since neither spouse is ever seen, one is left to wonder why the overwhelming desire to get them back.  Are they crazy or just desperate?  By all accounts, what they `lost' wasn't that great to begin with.  This makes them stupid and the ordeal they subject the audience to tedious and tiresome.  Not a good movie on any account.  I expected better from everyone even remotely affiliated with this doomed project.

Definitely not a keeper.",1304640000,,873,4.462025316455696
2554546,5,B000F7MIC6,I bought this movie because I am a Julie Andrews fan. I expected her to have a small part but to my surprise her part is huge.  It has a great story plot and I am very happy I got it.,1300406400,,183,3.4634146341463414
2554547,1,B000F7MIC6,"Take two mature actors, an aging story line that's been done a thousand times, halfheartedly do it yet again ---and voila! You have ""A Fine Romance""....one hell of a bad movie. The best thing about the movie is the Paris backdrop. But even that can't save this cow. Don't even rent this campy, amateurish attempt a cinema.",1254441600,4,322,4.666666666666667
2554548,4,B000F7MIC6,"Ms Pam Piquet (Julie Andrews) and Cesareo Grimaldi (Marcello Mastroianni) have one thing in common; their spouses, Doctor Piquet (Jean-Michel Cannone) and Marguerite (Catherine Jarret) have an affair with each other, and both Pamela and Cesareo are desperate to have their spouses back. This movie, also released under the name Cin Cin, is a hilarious light-hearted comedy involving two middle aged spouses caught of in a family and personal mess fall in love with each other. But it is not love at first sight; Cesareo is a middle-aged Italian, romantic at heart with strong addiction to alcohol. Pam is a good hearted British woman who doesn't drink or romance another man except her husband. The circumstances gradually change and force them to be with each other. There are several hilarious situations; when the couple moves from motel to motel looking for a room with a good view for their first tryst; or when Cesareo start calling for his wife in front of a residential building annoying the residents; or when he is caught making out with a nurse in a rehab clinic by Pamela. In the middle of all this is the son of Pamela who is trying get Cesareo marry his mother so that she moves out of the apartment building, and he can sell the entire building allowing him with a hefty commission in the real estate deal. The movie was shot on locations in Paris and you will enjoy this light hearted comedy.",1200009600,,1408,4.727642276422764

2554550,4,B000F7MIC6,"I was so excited when I saw that this film was available on DVD.  As a huge fan of Julie Andrews, this is one of only a few of her films that I hadn't seen.

I bought it immediately, but was disappointed.  The film isn't great, but it's not bad.  I'm glad I own it because I love Julie, but it's not one of my favorites.

It's the DVD presentation that I'm most unhappy about.  First of all, throughout a great deal of the film, the sound and picture are not in synch.  There also aren't any scene divisions on the disc.  It's just one big scene, and you have to fast forward to get to a certain place.

If you're a fan of Julie Andrews, you'll want this in your collection, but otherwise don't bother.  Hopefully a better quality edition will be released someday.",1168819200,23,764,4.206896551724138
