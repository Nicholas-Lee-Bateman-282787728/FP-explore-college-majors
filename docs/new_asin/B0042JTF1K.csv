8413784,4,B0042JTF1K,"This movie is especially nostalgic for me & was SO excited to find it! It was just as wonderfully weird as I remembered!
The only reason I took away a star is because there are no captions available. As a person with severe hearing loss, this ruins the watching experience quite a bit.",1527811200,,285,4.39622641509434
8413785,3,B0042JTF1K,"I really wanted to love this movie, but it just couldn't seem to gel into an adult movie or kids movie. There were some pretty funny scenes, and then it would degenerate into a poor kids adventure, then back to funny. My head hurts.",1398211200,,232,4.295454545454546
8413786,4,B0042JTF1K,"This movie is so weird and fantastic you just can't look away. After watching just a few minutes you will be glued to the screen and think about it years afterwards. The actors are all fantastic. I originally checked it out because my favorite actress Juliette Lewis plays 14 year old daughter and has such a beautiful voice when she sings. If you enjoy watching movies that are little off and weird I recommend this one, I've watched it several times and still cannot get enough of the whole idea of a world built around tubes.",1318377600,,528,4.510416666666667
