7852418,4,6303625894,"There are few musical pieces such as Tchaikovsky's 'The Nutcracker'...  few that will ever touch you as deeply... few that will make you as giddy as the clouds...  few that truly move one to emotion.
This is a spirited rendition of that classical piece and the classic tale.
This is not just for Christmas time.  My children enjoy listening to it and watching it all year round.  Who says Christmas cheer is only for one time of the year?
IMHO, ranks up there with Disney's Fantasia.  Excellent buy.",970790400,,499,4.625
