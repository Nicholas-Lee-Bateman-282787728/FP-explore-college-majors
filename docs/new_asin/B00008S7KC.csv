1860603,5,B00008S7KC,"When I think of my favorite video concerts, two in particular come to mind. ""U2 at Red Rocks"" and ""Pink Floyd Live at Pompeii"". The reason? LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION! How can you beat the early, classic Floyd line-up actually setting their gear up in the empty ruins of Pompeii (i.e., no audience), jamming out their awesome pre-""Dark Side"" material as the day's sun sets in the distance?? Then the huge spotlights come on, and they continue playing as night falls around them. No overdubs (unlike most, if not all, of today's ""live"" concert vids), and one of the best Floyd performances you'll ever hear. It all makes for quite a ""heady"" experience (if you know what I mean - so be sure to enjoy whatever it is you like to enjoy with this show!) Added bonus: in-studio interviews and clips of them making ""Dark Side of the Moon"" (to be expanded-upon in this DVD edition).

Tracks include live material from Meddle and ""A Saucerful of Secrets"".

I thought the performance was outstanding and viewers could see the brashness of the band and how they pushed each other.  Maybe the original version of Live at Pompeii featured more of the band playing.  But this sucks.  It shows boiling mud more than it does the band playing.  And the interviewer seems to be obsessed with getting the members to talk about the conflict within the band.  I just wanted to see a live performance by Pink Floyd.

1860696,5,B00008S7KC,"The original is better, by far. For music enthusiasts, this is a landmark, a classic, some of the very best recorded music in all history. You must see it regardless of you preference for ""genre"", this was a seminal moment in the confluence of music making and cinema. There is no doubt that this music will live forever. Don't miss it, if you did not grow up with Pink Floyd, you should watch this as your introduction ( the original cut, throw away the ""director's cut""). Pink Floyd pre-dark side of the moon was a great time, despite the success and obvious quality of dark side of the moon, Echoes was the defining moment for Pink Floyd, and this is the definitive recording. Careful with that Axe Eugene is also well done, as is One of these days,",1470268800,,752,4.456521739130435

1860703,5,B00008S7KC,"The Directors Cut is great, with funny interviews and some studio footage (that Brain Damage solo is very interesting). Some of the studio footage and random conversations in the director's cut feel slightly out of place, however, making the experience a little unfocused and loose.

The actual songs, interviews, and behind the scenes extra footage are a must see for fans of Pink Floyd. The added in computer generated images and videography are done to varying degrees of success. I would've appreciated some more shots of the real Pompeii as that is what's most impressive and of course actually looks weathered and real because it is real. Of course I recommend this to anyone who appreciates one of the greatest bands of all time, but adding in the CGI, for me personally, only takes away from the overall experience.",1461369600,,632,4.702702702702703

1860738,4,B00008S7KC,"This is one of my favorite performance films. What really bothers me about the director's cut is it actually makes some interesting improvements over the original, but then ruins it in other ways. The original film focuses on the music, the performance and visually augmenting the performance with complimentary footage of the environment (the ruins and volcano); though some things don't work great, overall it succeeds. The Dark Side footage added later can be relegated to the DVD extras, but what annoys me more is the compromising choice of throwing in the black & white outtake footage of the members dubbing the vocals in the studio AND screwing them up and laughing about them. This isn't a Beatles movie. It ruins the artistic effect of the Echoes performance, which is the point of the film--not a smorgasbord of footage that might as well be thrown in there since we have it. I do like new pictures of art and pompeii, which look very crisp, and it's nice to have great-looking footage of a volcano erupting when Roger Waters lets out his scream in Careful With That Axe, Eugene and it improves on the effect. Not sure what I think about the CG footage of Pompeii. All the CG looks pretty cheap--including the laughable ""morph"" effect that was getting popular at the time. These things look like something that was done because it seemed ""neat"", or some idea Maben had about the subtextual ""story"" of the film, but fails because it doesn't purely serve the film, besides the fact that they just don't come off very convincingly.
But you can always watch the original film, which is included in the Features section.

The film was made in an amazing place which makes this even better. The saddest thing is the lack of other songs as they had big technical problems during recording and filming and only a handful of songs were actually filmed and recorded.
The sound is variable sadly due to lost master tapes/multi tracks. Also lost footage sadly only gives us in one example Nick Mason on drums for the whole song.

1860848,4,B00008S7KC,"Without even reading any other reviews, I'm going to tell you straight up the deal with this classic piece of rock cinema. Find yourself a copy of the 1974 US version of the film. It is NOT on here. The ""Director's Cut"" version on here is the worst of the three. The 1972 ""original version"" you get here is fine, but it is not the best version. That's the third version, the 1974 US version. It's the easy to find VHS version and it runs 84 minutes. There's either the blue-ish cover with Roger on gong (1984?) or the pink/red cover with the pillar (1990?). As far as I know they're the same, and both versions have 23 minutes of ""fake"" Dark Side studio recording/interview/eating clips spliced in here and there that were added to the original 61 minute film (I say fake because I believe the band had already recorded Dark Side and supposingly ""pretended"" to be recording it later on for the sole purpose of having the footage added to this US release of Pompeii). Fake or not, the footage is great. Funny, classic Floyd stuff! Don't get me wrong, as a huge Floyd fan I'm kind of sick of Dark Side. But the extra footage is such a great behind the scenes look of the band that once you're used to it being there (I got Pompeii on VHS within the first year of getting heavy into Floyd) the film just isn't the same without it. This ""added"" footage is interesting musically (hearing the band working on incomplete Dark Side songs), philisophically (individual band member interviews ad their comments on society) and comically (Nick Mason refusing pie in the studio cafeteria because they only have pieces WITH crust). If you're anything more than a passive Floyd fan, trust me, get a copy of the US VHS. This is the single best rock video ever released. Happy gonging!",1397174400,,1769,4.53125

There had been some confusion over items being sold as, ""non-regional"", or, at least, ""Region-1""(for the U.S.)Yet, it was not to be and the disc that arrived was UN-playable(to my dismay!)So, watch for regional distinctions whenever purchasing DVD's. But, especially this product!

This is the creme De la creme of Pink Floyd classic's! This version of The Directors Cut includes the original concert-footage, as well as an interview segment. There are different versions available with, and/or w/o both elements. So, watch your detailed product descriptions. Please? And, THANK you!

Any true Pink Floyd fan should appreciate this for their self, or as a gift. I'm so glad the members of the band united with this director at this particular stage of their career. Real music can be a sacred thing. And, this performance marks a special place and time for the Floyd.

1860904,5,B00008S7KC,"This DVD is a look at the pure entertainment of music making by Pink Floyd. For most, Pink Floyd is just an awesome musical hallucinatory experience.  For a few that really know what the secret message is, every song of Pink Floyd is connected strands to a story about a guitar player that sold his soul to the devil to be a rock star and tortures him self to death in a hotel room.  There's a kid who had a big hallucination. Making love to girls in magazines.  He wonders if you're sleeping with your new found faith.  Could anybody love him. Or is it just a crazy dream? And if I show you my dark side, Will you still hold me tonight? (From The Final Cut-The Final Cut/1983).  The Wall is its centerpiece.  Listen to the man who raves at his wall.  Making the shape of his question to Heaven (From Set the Controls to the Heart of the Sun-A Saucerful of Secrets/1968) Who calls the tune in the court room? (From Free Four-Obscured by Clouds/1972) ""Making a date for later by phone, and if your alone Ill come home. (From San TropezMeddle/1971: Surprise, surprise surprise!).  We met just six hours ago, the music was too loud.. Tomorrow brings another town and another girl like you. (From Summer 68-Atom Heart Mother/1970; Dirty Women).  Most think Pink Floyd is a drug oriented band. Well, you can trust them.  But, you have to pay VERY CLOSE attention to the lyrics to understand the secret message weaved throughout the songs connecting them into one story that climaxes with the wall.  What are they whispering in Julias Dream?  Why would they be whispering that? What did you dream, its alright we told you what to dream.",1376870400,,1630,4.525597269624574

So, I can HDMI tether my laptop to the Phillips flat panel, and will also attempt to stream the show from laptop to TV via Wi Fi.

1860961,4,B00008S7KC,"First off, this is a review for the DVD version of the directors cut of Live at Pompeii.
The performance is amazing -- The band seems so in sync with one another that the music just flows (even when Nick Mason loses one of his drumsticks during the performance of ""One of These Days""). But hey, it is THE Pink Floyd, they can pull just about anything off! The picture quality is ok, but just keep in mind that it was filmed in the 70's. I would love to see this film make it onto blu-ray with restored film and sound.
The only problem i have with it is the studio footage that is placed in between the performace at Pompeii in the Director's Cut. Don't get me wrong, I love watching and hearing interviews of Pink Floyd, but I feel that the studio footage interrupts and takes away from the flow of the Concert Film.  However, you may choose, on the DVD menu, to watch the Original Concert Film without any of the ""Studio Time""

While the original was in a 4:3 aspect ratio, director Adrian Maben expands the ""Director's Cut"" to an anamorphic 16:9 wide screen.  While it fills the screen, some cropping is noticeable.

a century old).  The colors were still solid and crisp, no scratches, no dust
marks (that I noticed, at least).

should start with their better known works (like Dark Side of the Moon, The Wall)

1861000,5,B00008S7KC,"There's nothing one can possibly write about this and deem it a ""review"", for this live cut of The Floyd in their early days. Gilmore had become a staple and they were playing live in front of nothing but remotely placed cameras around the great ruins of Pompeii for over 2 hours, non-stop, the only breaks being editorial as it shows them in candid settings like a simple diner in England having toast and tea, when Nick Mason orders pie without the crust. By the 5th or 6th viewing, you'll realize exactly what Waters and Gilmore are describing in that diner. That their ""instruments are merely extensions of their creative thought process. Whatever [it is they're] using to make ""music"" with, it must be an extension of the mind and body, the musician masters the instrument, the instrument or any tool used to generate music from cannot limit, hamper or control the musician because the musician masters whatever that instrument is"". When Waters is screwing with the dials of an ancient, 2nd grade science project tool used to measure the pitch and tone of any frequency, a scientific instrument that wails an electronic high and low pitch depending on how he turns the dials; Using that genius talent, he turns the this archaic scientific instrument into an elegant musical device reflective of the time and era in which they were from, as a sharp contrast to their surroundings, which dates back to Julius Caesar. It's not just a video of Pink Floyd playing live, it's both an auditory and visually mind blowing presentation from one of the greatest bands, if not the greatest, to have ever played together as a group. There will never be another Pink Floyd like the one you see in this video, if you're lucky enough to have a copy of this rare DVD.

I write this with the most broken heart, as I just sold my new copy (although I still have an older copy), but I was hoping to pass the new one down to my prodigy, but alas, the PhD bill beckons, and Amazon once again delivers a rare jewel to a lucky person at the expense of another. Letting go of this was like letting go of a family jewel.

When you see Roger Waters standing atop the hill in the background providing rhythm using a giant gong, with Gilmore seated barefoot on the ground surrounded by the ruins of Pompeii, playing the guitar from another dimension (just look in his eyes, you'll see he's not on/from this world) you realize you're literally nothing but a speck of dust blowing by in their world. As lucky as those from Mozart's, Beethoven's and Francisco Tarrega's circa were to have been alive when those giants roamed this earth.

There's nothing like this of The Floyd and there never will be again.

Whoever took this prized possession from me, enjoy it. I'll forever remember having it. When it's worth $10,000 and up. But regardless of the value, I pray you will cherish it the way I did.

1861001,5,B00008S7KC,"I'll keep this review short as many have already expressed the incredible historical content of the group and this fabulous movie. The segment/song ""Echoes"" is worth buying alone, as the lead part is not recorded for the CD/record and only exists in this movie. It's an amazing lead guitar part that must be heard and seen to really enjoy. Gilmour, Mason, Waters and Wright are interviewed and express their emotions and insight on writing or approaching their song writing.
The best part is a small glimpse into the pre-Dark Side of The Moon synth-music that Roger showcases in this movie.

1861002,5,B00008S7KC,"The movie opens in darkness, we hear a slow melodic pulse, faint breathing. The darkness lasts until it segue into ""Echoes,"" bookending the movie. Being that this was filmed in October of 1971, the film is as vivid as though it were shot recently. I only wish Yes' Yesongs was of this quality. The film is punctuated by brief interviews with band members, and these snippets cut back and forth from color to black and white. These interviews give us a feel for the personality of the band members in a relaxed atmosphere.
 There are also scenes of Pompeii including murals, statues, and flowing lava; the eerie music seems a backdrop,  darkly commenting upon the horrors of what happened in Pompeii. A subtle comment upon our own mortality. We are shown Pink Floyd in the amphitheater, and then in a recording studio. Often, the film fluctuates in this manner. ""Saucerful of Secrets,"" seems to glide from cacophony, chaos, and then evolves into the more melodic, less avant-garde. I can see why Floyd is referred to as ""space music."" ""Set Your Controls for the Heart of the Sun,"" nebulous, haunting, dreamy, throbs a slow rhythm that characterizes so much of their music. Like most people of my generation, the first Floyd album I bought was ""Dark Side of the Moon."" I am not familiar with all their albums, so this is for me an introduction to some of their early songs as well.
I enjoyed both ""The Director's Cut,"" and the original. Although I am not a professional film critic, nor a professional photographer, I do feel that this film was very well done. Highly enjoyable.",1322352000,,1576,4.7272727272727275

1861006,4,B00008S7KC,"I found this DVD is the used bin when shopping the other day, and literally for pennies (ok $3), I couldn't believe my good fortune. I immediately snapped this up of course. I hadn't seen ""Live at Pompeii"" in many, many years. I didn't even know that a new ""Director's Cut"" had been released, so I was quite intruiged by this.

""Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii"" (171 min.) starts off with the ""Director's Cut"" (91 min; in 16:9 widescreen). I was a little surprised to see all the additional space footage, I mean how weird is it to see International Space Station footage from (I'm guessing) the 1990s in a concert film that was filmed in late 71/early 72! I also couldn't quite understand the logic behind adding footage (not concert footage, even) from the band messing around at Abbey Studios on various ""Dark Side of the Moon"" material. All rather strange. The original film (60 min; in 4:3 full screen) is also included, thankfully. While I prefer watching the widescreen ""refit"", the original shorter movie makes a lot more sense musically and thematically. ""Echoes Part I"" and ""Echoes Part II"" bookend the fantastic Pompeii-filmed set.

Am I the only one to think that as it relates to the Pompeii-filmed footage, Nick Mason had an inordinate amount of screen time? I'm thinking as much as the other three combined. You can't as much as catch a glimpse of Roger Waters until well into ""Echoes Part I"" for some reason. The DVD contains a 15-20 min. interview with the director Adrian Maben, and it's interesting hearing him talk about the intent of making this the ""anti-Woodstock"" film, with no spectators instead of the ""million"" at Woodstock. In the end, contrary to some other reviewers here, I don't mind all that much that Maben made a ""Director's Cut"", since thankfully the DVD presents both the old and the new versions.

I lost my copy years ago and have been wanting to replace it for some time now. I wanted to buy the original on DVD, but this is all I have been able to find. I was wary of it due to others' reviews being so poor. I didn't want a doctored version or to put my money into encouraging the changing of a masterpiece. So, I borrowed it from our local library, unwilling to shell out four times as much as what I had paid for it on VHS in the 1990s. Unfortunately, the disc I borrowed had a scratch on it, so I was unable to watch the original concert in it's entirety. I went to the scene selection menu to try and skip over the scratched area of the disc. The disc menu only allows you to choose from the Director's cut versions of the song., which I was avoiding like the plague. So, I was forced to watch the Director's version or none at all. I was horrified at how poor the Director's cut was. I am saddened by the computer graphics. Terrible terrible terrible. Shame on them for messing with a such a good thing.

I stumbled across some videos on the internet that were from the film and I purchased the video via Amazon. Com.

The 2003 director's cut (the only version available on DVD) is a terribly jarring and distracting cut, with goof-ball space cartoons randomly tossed in continually throughout the original performance.

The only saving grace is that it includes the original 1972 film under the ""features"" section.  The director's cut is NOT worth watching.

I can only hope and pray that they will eventually release this on blu-ray, and when they do, include a remastered version of both the 1972 and 1974 films.",1279152000,4,661,4.875

The director's cut version is great because you get to see some ""behind the scenes"" interview with the original band members.  The performance versions of their classic songs in my opinion are even better that the studio versions.  Of course if you like Pink Floyd then you already know that Echoes in epic, but the performance versions of Careful With That Axe Eugene, Saucerful of Secrets and Set The Controls For The Heart of The Sun are incrediable.

Lousy, pointless 80's style graphics and some innocuous interview material that should have been added as an extra - not part of the movie. (In the original release there were some behind-the-scenes footage of the band recording Dark Side Of The Moon --- that material worked well in the context of the film.) Oh and don't even get me started about the cropping of the material from 1.33:1 to 16:9. Just Plain Awful!

1861049,5,B00008S7KC,"Pink Floyd Live At Pompeii - Great, great, great, great!!!! This DVD contains the ""Director's Cut"" as well as the original concert film. Basically the Director's cut features lots of extra visuals, including computer graphic recreations of Pompeii, the exploding Vesuvius, and other things like NASA shots of rockets going up into space, space walks, images of suns and stars and moons and planets, all the usual things you'd expect of someone depicting a ""space rock"" band. It also has some extra bits from the studio in Paris when they were recording ""Dark Side of the Moon."" The Directors Cut starts out with space and planets animated instead of the big zoom-in to the arena in Pompeei of the original film. Not really an improvement, although it's nice to see something different I guess. Cool to see a grand piano in a roman ampitheatre. Gilmour and Wright shirtless, Waters and Mason in black. Integrates black and white studio shots with colour live stuff from Pompeii. Guys walking over steaming earth, awkward cuts to Wright and Gilmour screwing up their Echoes lyrics. Mason flips his drum stick. Broken drum heads on his kit - 8 drums and 5 cymbals. Racks and racks of amps - one shot goes behind them and we see the cameras and crews that face the band. Back of amps all say ""Pink Floyd. London."" Shots of the London Underground, clock going backwards, empty platform. Throwaway film experimentation. Pink Floyd's psychedelic breakfast at Abbey Road studios as Nick goes weird about apple pie, Roger's veins as he tries out weird keyboard sounds. Talking about over-using equipment. ""It's like saying `give a man a Les Paul guitar and he'll become Eric Clapton."" Did Clapton play a Les Paul? Constructing the ""On The Run"" sequence with sequencers and keyboards. ""Careful With That Axe Eugene"" with wild lava flows and screams. The and eating oysters. ""There's the danger of becoming slaves to the equipment, it happened before. Can't hide behind equipment."" Saucerful of Secrets - Waters smashing cymbols with toms, Wright attacking his grand. Fly on Waters' arm - smashes gong that we see on the cover art - all of the guys thin and trim and gangly in t-shirts and jeans, barefoot sand getting into the effects pedals. The band talks money and economics, ""rock is not dying like they say,"" and there's still money in it. Wright doing piano parts in shades fo r ""Us and Them"" as camera sweeps around. Gilmour ""we're not a drug-oriented group. You can trust us."" ""One of These Days"", mason on toms on ctymbols, weird geographic CG. Slow-mo on Mason as the song kicks into high gear, all you see is him, no Gilmour solo or Waters screaming. Mason loses a stick, then pulls a new one out. Nice butterfly logo on blue long-sleeve shirt. Keyboard too high in the mix. Interesting quotes about how well they've learned how to get along, ""we're happy together."" That wouldn't last. While the others are chatting, Gilmour pulls a perfect ""Echoes"" guitar solo. ""Mesdomoiselle Nobs"" with the wailing dog - Wright holding the dog, who sings on cue, Gilmour on harmonica, Waters on guitar (although it sounds like a bass) Address the topic of arguments and in-fighting by claiming that they have the same sense of humour and lust for money. ""We can still combine our interest. That's when it breaks down, when one person finds that wheat he's doing isn't interesting, thinks he can do better by himself,"" says Mason. Then shifts to Gilmour noodling on the guitar, gives a big beautiful smile when he notices the camera. ""What would rock `n' roll be without feedback?"" Gilmour plays heavy, thick guitar solos on ""Brain Damage,"" they obviously were never used since the finished product is much more relaxed. ""Set The Controls For the Heart Of The Sun"", Mason's purple butterfly t-shirt - he has two? ""Echoes"" in studio - Gilmour stops singing - is he being a prick? Images of Roman erotica, humans cavorting with fauns. Closing ""Echoes"" - sunnyday Pink Floyd with other backdrops.  TERRIBLE computer graphics bit (1:23:35).  DVD extras. Generally not great, although there is some good stuff.  Three posters, one of which calls the show ""A Zappaesque musical pastiche.""  Three newspaper articles from the day.  Five ""covers of bootlegs"" pages with two on each page, so 10 covers.  Four previous covers.  Four albums' with graphics, two songs' lyrics (why only two? why bother?), one 24-minute interview with directore Adrian Maben that was very interesting.  No voice of the interviewer, questions appear as banners.  He explains some of the reasons why there were so many wanky graphics and things, he complains that ""you are always unsatisfied with something, you never get it right,"" and I think that even after 30 years he's ruined his chance to ""fix"" his mistakes.  But he didn't have much to work with - apparently the rushes were lost, so he couldn't add any material from 1972 into the film, so he put 2003 stuff in.  Big mistake.  I read on the Wikipedia that the shots from the studio in Paris that was supposedly of them recording ""Dark Side of the Moon"" was actually faked - the band had already finished recording the album and were mixing it.  Other fake shots were done on a sound stage somewhere.  You can tell which ones they were because there are no ruins of Pompeii, the band are squeezed together, and Rick Wright is beardless.  But at least they try.

The ""Beastie Boys"" made a funny tribute to this movie for the video of their song ""Gratitude.""  Cz-Cz-Cz-Czech it out!""",1216512000,4,5493,4.826595744680851
1861050,5,B00008S7KC,"Compared to the original version of ""Live at Pompeii"" this one has more material in it, without anything dropped.

1861051,4,B00008S7KC,"""Pink Floyd Live At Pompeii - The Director's Cut"" could have been a better film than it is, even with the extra and new footage, if Adrien Maben hadn't tried to run the gamut here. It's total overkill. The audio is now more clear sounding, and the picture is now sharper than it was, and some alternate footage from the time is included to enhance the experience, but there is some serious inconsistency in the bigger picture.

In its original form, the viewer gets an opening sequence made up of some eerie music the band recorded for the film, some shots of the Roman ruins, and the preliminary stages of the road crew setting up the equipment. Now, there is a black screen, with a heartbeat and some heavy breathing. I felt like I was watching ""Friday The 13th."" You then get some nice spacey images during the first bars of ""Echoes: Part One,"" looking suspiciously like Stanley Kubrik's ""2001: A Space Oddessy."" It does fit the music, and it's probably what the band would have shown on ""Mr. Screen,"" as they called it, in the shows from those days, so I took this in stride. It is, after all, a new version. The visuals are really very beautiful during this, but the majesty of this performance is belied by footage of David Gilmour and Rick Wright recording the vocals to the original version in the studio. The sound itself is from the ""concert,"" but seeing them fumble through outtakes during this, takes the covers off them. And even though there is no acting, per se, Gilmour does what every film director says not to do; he looks directly at the camera between lines. But even with these glitches, the film still does look and sound good.

And even cleaned up, the original footage, already in existence, as well as some other exposition, has a slightly gritty look to it, causing the ""documentary"" feel, and it works. But there is some computer-generated imaging which jars the viewer out of the lull they achieve while enjoying the band's performances. Time and circumstance do not allow a complete play-by-play in this forum, but if the original footage had a digital-era clarity, or the segments of new digital-era footage were slightly grittier looking, the transitions would have worked wonderfully. This is only my opinion. But, usually, new treatments are supposed to fit seamlessly into the original piece; here, it's the metaphorical ""sore thumb."" And too bad, because it is a very ambitious cut, worthy of watching anyhow. The scenery shots, previously unused, are unbelievably beautiful. The landscapes, from the original cut, and the shots taken from the vault and added in, are breathtaking. For real.

Certain things I wouldn't have done (I know, this is Adrien Maben's film, not Jerry H's film) if I were the director, though, include one thing I didn't care for, in the original film. It's not bad, but not what I would have done.  In some of the outdoor footage, there are  some stunning landscapes, with the band members walking through it, on an outdoor hike, looking something like The Beatles in ""Yellow Submarine."" These shots should have been done without Waters, Wright, Mason, and Gilmour, out on some nature-hike. It's just pointless. They only worked together, they didn't go hiking and whatnot, but this is only a viewpoint. And the other thing: The newly included black-and-white footage of the interviews from the cafeteria. The only saving grace here, is some conversations with Rick Wright, conspicuously absent from the original cut. But, really, watching Roger Waters eat oysters for lunch, is one of the most disgusting things I have ever seen. I cringe at the sight of this, and even writing about it. And he obviously has a holier-than-thou attitude as well. He makes some very valid points in his conversations, but here, he is showing just how boorish he can be. But I guess, these parts show us that they are just a bunch of regular guys who laugh and joke with one another, they aren't embassadors from another planet. I just wouldn't have included these clips.

But, as I have said earlier, sometimes the new edits work very well. During the climax of ""A Saucerful Of Secrets,"" there is some stock film of a volcano erupting, and the flooding of a city with hot lava, including a shot of a horrified little girl watching her home town being destroyed by one of God's temper tantrums. But, some of the additional visuals look like something you'd see while using a Play Station video game. This is what cost this video a star for me.

Also, as a gift to the purist, the original ""concert"" is included in the bonus features, in tact, the first of the three releases, no interviews, no toying with the running order, just the band playing their best material of the day for the  camera crew, and this is a 5-plus rating on the 1 to 5 scale available here.

My favorite bands are Pink Floyd, The Who, Steppenwolf, and The Mothers. Videos like this are the reason.",1213574400,2,4913,4.7368421052631575

1861053,1,B00008S7KC,"Hey, Pink
 I hope I am not being presumptuous by using your first name, but familiarity seems appropriate in this case. I have a question for you. Exactly what were you trying to prove in Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii? I have been to Pompeii. I have been to the mountaintop of Vesuvius. The souls of those who died in the volcanic eruption one millennium, nine centuries, one score and five years ago heard your performance and they are groaning.
 You were given four pieces of electronic equipment and told to do something with them. The implication was that you were going to do something musical with them. What you concocted was a piece of work that only someone savoring the effects of an ecstasy-marijuana-crack cocktail could begin to understand.
 Pink, that was not music. Count Basie was music. Frank Sinatra was music.  The Beatles were music. Pavorotti looks like music. The Miracles and the Temptations were real music. Aretha Franklin defines music. What you presented will probably cause Vesuvius to come to life again.
 You are beginning to make me think that Camille Paglia was correct when she said rock musicians should be forced to have classical training before they are allowed to create their own art. I will take it one step further. I say artists such as Pink Floyd should be forced to sit at the feet of the classical artists to learn a thing or two. Since the classical artists are all dead, that will solve the problem.
 Pink, I suggest you relinquish your rights to the name. You are an insult to all that is pink. Even the panther is having second thoughts about being associated with the color.

Sincerely

The out-takes that have been put in detract from that mystique and make this seem a bit more of a joke. The visuals of celestial bodies and outer space don't add much eaither. Perhaps if I were not jaded by knowledge of the original I would be gushing about this the director's cut. Still, the film captures a time when there were plenty of new barriers to be broken and a new age seemed to be dawning. It's textures remind me of Nicholas Roege's ""Walkabout""--filmed in the early 70's too when lenses, light and spetral seperation thereof WAS the extent of ""special effects"".

1861080,3,B00008S7KC,"Pink Floyd, in their early years (immediately after Syd Barrett's departure) were musicians of seriousness and integrity, if not always of the most flawless technique.  In later years -- after Roger Waters's departure -- the integrity and seriousness gave way to bloat and laziness in the 80s ""Delicate Sound of Thunder"" tour, and the subsequent ""Pulse"" tour.  The four-piece (three, actually, in Roger's absence) was expanded to an eleven-piece, with every instrumental part doubled, and supplemented with a saxophonist (who doubled on rhythm guitar) and a multicultural trio of female backup singers.

What makes this such a fascinating document is the fact that it is, for the most part, a rare look at (and listen to) the Floyd without all the ""dressing"".  They are even short-handed, as it were; Roger has to switch off to acoustic guitar, and Dave to harmonica, for ""Seamus"" (re-titled ""Mademoiselle Nobs"" for the guest performer here).  Rick Wright switches between Farfisa organ, grand piano, and Hammond organ, sometimes having a bit of a walk to do so (notice his activity at the beginning of ""Echoes"").

The aural result is fascinating -- it seems strange to think it, given the polish and veneer of their contemporaneous studio recordings, but this vintage Pink Floyd has a raw, almost ""punky"" sound live.  Of particular note in this regard is Waters's bass sound; quasi-distorted, plucked-close-to-the-bridge, nasty as hell.  Gilmour's guitar tone remains closest to the studio version, lush with reverb and delay, but still aggressive, nonetheless.  Gorgeous, and bell-like, for the verse solo on ""Echoes"", it turns nasal and shriek-y for the solo during the long funk-rock workout section.  Also of note is Rick Wright's Hammond playing -- he, too, goes for volume and intensity during this section of ""Echoes"".  At times, the guitar and organ sound merge into a great orgiastic dollop.

Nick Mason, of the four, is perhaps a little disappointing.  He is solid, but one feels that his drumming probably only matured and became smoother with further and later Floyd efforts (particularly for ""Animals"").  Here, he comes across as nervous and a bit choppy, relying on repetitive, uninteresting fills to cover for ineffective groove-playing.

As a side note, vis a vis the Pink Floyd ""sound"", Dave Gilmour has, in his most recent tours, reverted to a more stripped-down live presentation.  His last tour included Rick Wright (and Rick Wright only) on keyboard, himself doubling on sax and guitar, and a rhythm section.  Also, he has begun playing ""Echoes"" live again -- the song benefits from the reduction in forces.",1201305600,,2629,5.177304964539007

1861085,5,B00008S7KC,"Pink Floyd released their Live at Pompeii DVD in October of 2003.
Pink Floyd first released this concert film Live at Pompeii in late 1972 in the UK.
The original film was filmed at the Pompeii Ampitheatre in Pompeii, Italy in October of 1971 with some footage filmed in early 1972 at a Paris film studio. That original version was 61 minutes long, and consisted only of performance footage from the Pompeii amphitheatre and a Paris studio, plus some extra footage of Pompeii. This was shot in full-screen 4:3 and is presented as such on the DVD. The band gave superb readings of Echoes (pt. 1), Careful With That Axe Eugene, A Saucerful of Secrets, One of These Days, Set the Controls For the Heart of the Sun, Mademoiselle Nobs and Echoes (pt. 2). This right here makes the purchase of the DVD justifiable.
In early 1973, director Adrian Maben went to Abbey Road Studios while the band was finishing their classic contribution to rock history, the 34 million selling and counting worldwide The Dark Side of the Moon shot some documentary footage of the band recording (or pretending to record according to guitarist/singer David Gilmour because the band were mixing by the time these sequences were filmed) and talking. The new footage was spliced in between some of the original performances for the film and the result was released in August, 1974 here in the US and was now 80 minutes long. Unfortunately, this edit is not on DVD.
Now, this new version uses the Abbey Road footage, plus some unearthed black and white footage of the band in a studio in Paris in March of 1972. Also, Maben filmed new shots of Pompeii, a whole bunch of archival footage of space exploration and new titles that look made for a straight-to-video release instead of the Godard-esque ones we had with the original. This is about 91 minutes long, and has been inexplicably matted to a 16:9 format. Although the new interview footage was good, the new computer-generated effects were not that great!
Gilmour nor Mason and Wright were involved with this DVD and weren't happy with the Director's Cut. Roger Waters, on the other hand, was and in fact his manager Mark Fenwick was one of the DVD's executive producers and approved of this director's cut.

Its absolutely amazing, period. If you are a pink Floyd fan, it is as indispensible to your collection as ""Dark side of the Moon"". If your not a Pink Floyd Fan, then nothing said here will shake you awake! Telling about all of the historic and archeological sites, the collesieum, the tour of the lava fields.......

1861087,3,B00008S7KC,"The rating given above is a mixed one I'd give four stars to the original cut of the film and two stars to the extended Director's cut. In  1972 Adrian Maben met with Pink Floyd and made the ultimate anti concert film. Live at Pompeii feature the band playing its early experimental music to the empty amphitheatre at Pompeii.

The effect of the ruins together with the music make for an interesting hour of viewing. Both the images and sountrack is haunting. The new Director's Cut extends the show by adding fly on the wall interviews recorded in Paris and some studio material from the recording of Dark Side of the Moon.

In 1971 Pink Floyd were in a transitional phase. While they had a large fan base they had yet to move into the concept music which would begin with the release of Dark Side of the Moon in 1973. This concert shows them playing the earlier music that would later be rarely played for audiences again.

The track selection is impressive. Starting and ending with the massive composition Echoes and includes Careful With That Axe Eugene, A Saucerful of Secrets, One of These Days,Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun, and a howling dog doing the blues piece Mademoiselle Nobs.

The disc, as did the film, will primarily interest fans of the group but it does provide an interesting look back into the days when the now classic rock era was being born.

The disc features an interesting 24 minute interview with director Adrian Maben and some conceptual art and other images. The main problem with the disc is that it does not offer anything but a standard stereo mix.

I rented it, brought it home and copied it to another video tape (which, due to the fact that I didn't have the right equipment for that sort of thing.. came out quite crappily) Still, at the age of thirteen, fourteen, fifteen... I probably watched this thing a few hundred gazillion times.

Now that I have the DVD, its a whole new aspect of visual brilliance... (only thing I find to be a little tacky on this DVD release is the addition of computer animated planets that appear at times) For the most part its all the original material that really carries. A real basic idea. The band would set up all their equipment amongst the ruins of Pompeii, and put on a ""live"" show. Genius.

I totally dig the feel of concert films that were made in the late sixties/early seventies (this was produced in '71, I think)... Just to have such a crisp visual account of what the band looked like back then is amazing. All about the power. This is pre-Dark Side or The Wall days, this is when, in my book,the band were best as functioning as a unit. And it shows. Highlights include... Gilmoure tearing it up on guitar, Nick Masons insanely huge drum set (watch him.. he hardly ever gets credit for being such a great drummer!) Roger Waters gets ill on some sort of giant gong! Rick Wright and David Gilmoure play a dog, like it was an instrument (not as weird as it sounds, but cool).

Added to this are vintage behind the scenes clips from the studio during Dark Side recordings... which I found to be very interesting. There are some odd clips of the band ordering breakfast in a restraunt, and  afew scattered interviews, via 1972..., any Floyd fan should not be without this. It goes to show that Floyd payed attention to their visuals, just as closely as their audio, since the beggining. Music for the ears AND eyes.",1175558400,3,1950,4.408333333333333

First off BOTH the original theatrical and directors cut are on this DVD and I think both are fantastic. The directors cut does add some poorly done 3D animation of space (with one or two shots that look distinctly familiar to 2001: A Space Odyssey... Echoes+Jupiter and the infinite beyond synchronization anyone?) as well as some 3D reconstructions of Pompeii, I'll admit it they are totally unneeded. However, the directors cut also adds about 20 minuets of interviews and recordings of their Dark Side of The Moon Sessions, which is really awesome to see.

The slow zooms in and out at the beginning and end of the film are interrupted with added clips of space scenes. There is even some computer animation thrown in somewhere of what appears to be a model of what Pompeii may have looked like before its destruction.

1861132,5,B00008S7KC,"Now THIS brings back fond memories... of midnight showings, wall-to-wall hippies, ""exotic"" tobaccos, and... well, I can't remember much else! LOL! But seriously, as soon as this was released, in a ""Directors Cut"" no less, I raced out and bought it... and you can't imagine how crushed I was by what the director, Adrian Maben, had managed to do to his original film.

I've made it a rule of sorts not to write negative revues, I'd much rather tell you why I liked something than why I thought something sucked; my first exception to that rule was for the totally execrable ""AvP,"" and this, I'm afraid, is my second. Thankfully the ""Original"" film IS included in the ""Special Features,"" and it's for this that I gave the 5 Stars.

The production, such as it is, is incredibly simple by todays standards, we're talking 1971 after all, so, there're no lasers, no circular screen, no Varilights, no ""Floyd droids,"" no mirror-ball, no wall, no pigs, no uber-show. What you do have are the four remaining members of the band, recently Sid-less, playing direct to camera in the Roman Amphitheater in Pompeii. Stretching themselves artistically in new directions, experimenting with new sounds and musical structures; in a number of the tracks presented here, you can hear the genesis of what they were to become, especially in the superb ""Echoes.""

Visually you get a mixture of static shots of the band playing, with the occasional tracking shot front and back of them. There's some footage of them walking on what appear to be the slopes of Vesuvius, looking at bubbling mud pools and clouds of steam. There're some over-dubs and front projection work done in a studio in France, but the most visually interesting numbers are ""Set the controls for the heart of the Sun,"" ""Careful with that Axe Eugene,"" and ""One of these days,"" which are all performed at night... VERY atmospheric! ""One of these days"" is actually quite bizarre as practically ALL of the footage is of Nick Mason playing up a storm, the rest of the footage of the band, with the exception of a couple of blink-and-you'll-miss-'em cut-aways, was lost!

So, what IS the problem with the ""Directors Cut?"" Simple. The performance of the band has been butchered; interview footage, some of it unintentionally hilarious such as an obviously stoned David Gilmour telling the director that they're NOT a ""drug orientated"" band, ""You can trust us,"" he says, has been edited into the breaks between the tracks. There's also footage of Gilmour, Waters, and Wright, in the Abbey Road studios trying out alternate versions of numbers from ""Dark Side."" All of this additional footage is well worth having, but, IMHO, it should have been edited into a separate documentary, or used to illustrate the obligatory interview with Maben, not shoe-horned in between the tracks themselves!

And then, as if to add insult to injury, Maben completely loses the plot and cuts in a bunch of grungy old stock NASA footage, y'know, Saturn 5 rockets taking off, a horribly pixilated 20 year old CGI'd planetary fly-by that looks as if it was produced on an Atari console, solar flares etc etc etc. This is embarrassing, I mean, the title sequence of ""Star Trek Voyager"" has better looking ""space"" footage than this old tat!!! Hell, if you want ""trippy"" visuals with your Floyd you'd be better off ripping the audio from the disc, converting it to mp3 and then playing it through iTunes with the Visualizer turned on!!! And if you're going to do that, edit the two halves of ""Echoes"" together via a 30-second cross-fade... I'm actually starting to like this version better than the studio one! Maben's justification for this travesty in his interview is completely bonkers, something about aliens in another galaxy picking up a faint broadcast of the Floyd's performance, then jumping in a ship and tracking the signal back to it's source!!! Oh, and did I mention the fake ""Letterbox"" format? (sigh)

My advice to any self respecting Floyd fan is to buy this and watch the ""Original"" film FIRST; just soak up the performances and marvel at how young and scruffy they all once were! LOL! Then, grit your teeth and watch the ""Directors Cut"" for the additional interviews and Abbey Road footage. So, in summing up...

I am very familiar with the older VHS cut so I know where the cuts and addidtions have happened.  It is still a cool movie for Floyd fans, but if you like the old school version it will take some getting used to.  If you are not familiar with the older cut, then by all means enjoy, it is still an entertaining flick, although it does have some flaws.  The additional footage that has been added dates from the original shoot (early 70's) to the presnt day.  The new footage (some of which is CG) can be kind of jarring when spliced into earlier stuff (seems to be an obvious afterthought sometimes) but it does still work.  Most of the added footage is space/NASA/stock footage which is also seems like an odd choice, but I guess it is just as relevent as footage of vulcanism and eruptions in a film about Pink Floyd (space rock?) playing music in a town destroyed by a volcano.

This is one of my most listened to DVDs - all the more so after buying Roger Waters In the Flesh and PF's Pulse, both of which I find sanitised overly-lush productions, and unfortunately highly over-rated and disappointing. I love the minimalist sound of early Pink Floyd - and this film captures them at their psychedelic best.

Unlike Pulse, there's no fancy light shows or distracting films to underscore how boring the performance is. A lot of reviews express disappointment at The Director's Cut - I've owned this feature 18 months and never watched the main film. I just watch the original movie - it's more than captivating enough.

It was a work of genius to film this in Pompeii, it emphasises the spacy nature of the music, the other-worldliness of their productions. It's hypnotic.

What I like about it best is the lack of extra musicians and backing singers - its just Pink. I listen only to live music, primarily to see musicians play. In South Africa, the major - or minor bands for that matter - never seem to make it this far, so seeing them live on DVD is the next best.

This is a slog fest  musically with banal if well-shot  visual poetry about volcanoes and ruins larded in.

In the ruins of Pompeii there is no audience; Only the band, their instruments, amps, and a camera crew. I'm giving it 5 stars, but a complaint I have is the cinematography. There's times when, instead of focusing on the band, the camera will begin filming other stuff. I want to see the band...Anyway, another cool thing about the show is that the performance stuff isn't even the best part. I particularly enjoyed the interviews, especially with the obviously high David Gilmour.

There's one part in an interview where Gilmour states ""A lot of people think we're a drug oriented band...But we're not, you can trust us."" This wouldn't be funny if he wasn't so obviously baked. While the setlist they perform, which is:

1. Echoes Pt. 1

2. Careful With That Axe Eugene

4. One of These Days

5. Mademoiselle Nobs

6. Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun

7. Echoes Pt. 2

The main problem I have with the directors cut is that it doesn't transition smooth enough between songs, it would start the song with the band playing in the ampitheater, and give you a jolting flash of some scene that more or less throws the mood of the whole song out the window.  I found it rough to watch, I wanted to see Pink Floyd live.  The directors cut is a bunch of random clips stuck together with little bits of Floyd actually playing.

On the other hand, the original version, focuses longer on Floyd actually playing, you see the effort that every echoing note requires.  THIS is the reason to buy this DVD!  This is Pink Floyd playing music in an ancient theater, a theater that Romans would have watched gladitorial combat in, this is the real deal.

Let's remember that all the material available at BBC and Granada TV as well as Belgian / French TV clips of the band have never been officially released and there are rumors that BBC erased in the 80's early Floyd material from their files.

Companies have released ""Pink Floyd London 66 & 67"" (first on VHS and recently on DVD), ""Stamping Ground"" (with two PF edited tracks from a 1970 Holland Festival), most recently the largely bootlegged ""Pink Floyd Live at KQED studios"" (aka Pink Floyd at the Fillmore from 1970; it won't be available in U.S.A. so look for it at Amazon UK), and the spectacular ""Pink Floyd Live at Pompeii"".

This film is simply great and a must have for any PF fan, either in the original film-only format or in the later release including shots at Abbey Road Studios during the final mixes for The Dark Side of the Moon.  Its shows the band as they used to be then (take a look at the candid interviews) without superstardom status, just the four of them performing their early hits such as ""Echoes"", ""Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun"", ""Saucerful of Secrets"", ""Careful with that Axe Eugene"" and ""One of these Days"" among others.

The so called Director's Cut is not good to me because it really changed the original sense of the film (fortunately the original film-only version is included).  This new version includes lots of new images that have nothing to do with the original film (rockets taking off, alien planets, outer space views, all of them representing other civilizations traveling to the earth, landscapes, museums, volcanoes, shore, even a computerized view of the old Pompeii) that are used in place of the original footage.

Great additions to the film are: the extra interview with the band in Paris, the vocals overdubs of the track ""Echoes"" in Paris, the improved image quality (it's an original 35 mm source!), and the interview with Adrian Maben (who sadly LOST the unused original shots of the different cameras available while filming - most notably on ""One of these Days"" so we can't see Waters & Wright).

New to me is that ""Careful with that Axe Eugene"" and ""Mademoiselle Nobs"" were actually recorded in Paris and not at Pompeii Amphitheatre (Of course! How I didn't notice it? Waters has cut his hair and Wright has shaved his face).

A perfect item that must be in the collection of the devoted fan of PF and very necessary to any person interested in 60's & 70's rock bands.",1144800000,5,2642,4.652360515021459

Director's Cut doesn't always mean a better movie. And this is only one example of it.

This includes all the songs that were in the original film.

Still I don't know why the space-theme were included in the beginning (and the end) of the film.

Since the ""Astronomy Domine"", the Floyd never had the space-theme in their songs.

As a matter of fact, why re-do this once again?

1861157,4,B00008S7KC,"As a fan of early Pink Floyd I've always grooved on this movie. What a fascinating idea: Britain's premier psychedelic band creates one of their greatest performances for 2000-year old ghosts once buried alive by the smoldering ash of Mt. Vesuvius in an amphitheatre once host to gladiators' battles. Sure, choppy editing breaks up the concert's trance spell too many times with unilluminating interviews and studio sessions, and while I love the volcano footage, seeing the band hike over a steaming lava field in their heeled leather boots is too reminiscent of a ""Spinal Tap"" escapade.  While it is fascinating to see ""The Dark Side"" under construction in the studio (even better, buy ""The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon"" DVD for much more behing-the-scenes production), it is also bittersweet to see the last of Pink Floyd's days of innocence before the overwhelming success of ""The Dark Side"" changed bassist Roger Waters from a burnt-out angelic bard into a spoiled and raging lunatic aka ""The Wall"".  Therefore, this movie inadvertantly captures the fragile personality balance of a wonderful group of musicians before they exploded into the Big Time beyond their wildest expectations.  ""The Director's Cut"" has many more interviews than in the original movie, and only a die-hard Pink Floyd fan will be able to sit through it more than once.  I highly recommend buying it for the Features section, which contains the Pompeii concert footage without any interviews or studio sessions.  Its much easier to connect to the profundity of nature's wrath, the fleeting fragility of life, and the grand artistic achievements of Roman civilization without being interupted by Richard Wright ordering pie at the Abbey Studios canteen.",1141257600,,1737,5.167259786476868
1861168,5,B00008S7KC,"Pink Floyd - Live at Pompeii (Director's cut), is simple extraordinary.

1861169,5,B00008S7KC,"I have no problem with the presence of 'The Director's Cut' on this DVD, as many previous reviewers do.  The one hour original film is included also, so ""the more the merrier"" I say.  Looks to me like the producer had his hands on some studio snippits and interviews from the 'Dark Side of the Moon' sessions that he didn't know what to do with, so he spliced them into the only film catalog of Pink Floyd from the same era.  Aside from the similiarity of 'Echoes' with the texture of 'Dark Side of the Moon' there is a disconnect between the two source materials, yet I found the DSOTM material entertaining and enlightening in its own right.

The original concert film is the prime draw, however, and there are very few like it from circa-1970.  While Monterey Pop, Woodstock, and the Isle of Wight festivals were filmed for posterity, very few bands engaged in productions such as we have here from the Floyd.  Fortunately, from my personal perspective, Pink Floyd is being captured at the absolute zenith of their appeal, having just released their masterpiece, 'Meddle'.  Four tracks are drawn from that disc (the 20+ minutes of 'Echoes' being split to form the opening and closing tracks, 'One of These Days' and 'Seamus', here titled 'Mademoiselle Nob').  Two tracks are drawn from 1968's 'A Saucerful of Secrets' (the title track and 'Set the Controls For the Heart of the Sun'), and 'Careful With That Axe Eugene' from 1968's 'Ummagumma'.

The concert is, of course, filmed in an ancient open-air arena in Pompeii, with only the film and sound crew and whatever undeparted spirits remaining as witnesses.  The surreal setting is a stark contrast to the futuristic sounds produced by Pink Floyd.  'The Director's Cut' supplants some of the images of the band with outer space imagery that, in itself, is in sharp contrast to the images of molten lava and steam seething from the ground that graced the original film.  These images also reinforce the '2001: A Space Odessey' connection played upon in Pink Floyd's compositions, vividly portrayed visually in the barren landscapes and the use of speaker towers as symbolic monoliths.  The filming alternates between day and night for the first three tracks, then settles in darkness for the remainder  of the film until 'Echoes Pt. 2' closes the set in sunlight.  The cinematography is comparable to other period pieces, such as Traffic's 1972 epic, 'Live In Santa Monica', with lengthy views of guitar fretwork from Gilmour and Waters, Nick Mason drumming, and Richard Wright keyboarding.  At times the approach is too one-dimensional, such as on 'One Of These Days' where Mason is the singular focus of the camera.  Teeming images of ancient Pompeii at times serve as the backdrop.

The music is the central focus, though at times the visual record demands attention.  Such is the case with Water's whispering screams on 'Careful With That Axe Eugene', and his assault on the cymbals and gong on 'Saucerful of Secrets'.  'Set the Controls...' augments its ancient Egyptian sounds some intriguing views of Richard Wright creating surreal sound effects from his keyboard, and the visual of the howling dog makes the unbearable CD version of 'Seamus' thoroughly enjoyable.

The best track on the disc is the unforgettable 'Echoes Pt. 1', with David Gilmour offering up scintillating lead guitar excursions over pulsing, rhythmic backing hooks.  'Careful With That Axe Eugene' and 'Saucerful..' extend the psychedelic, spacy, experimental feel, while 'One of These Days' returns one more time to the hard rock mantra introduced by 'Echoes'.  All in all, the song selection is about as diverse as the band's collected works at the time could produce.  'Fearless' may have worked well in this setting, and 'Saint Tropez' could have provided even deeper contrasts to Pompeii, though both possess Mediterranean allusions.

'Pink Floyd ' Live at Pompeii', with its rich mix of source materials and generous add-ons, such as printed lyrics, maps of Pompeii, and images of albums related to the tracks performed (even bootleg editions), is a true time capsule for adventurers into the psychedelic era of rock music.  Beyond entertainment, 'Live at Pompeii' is a serious work of art, and an expose on the mindset that fueled production of some of the most progressive music of the modern age.  Like '2001: A Space Odessey', this disc is worthy of shelf space and an occasional revisit into the DVD tray.  A must-see, if not a must-own.",1140825600,,4481,4.978523489932886

The whole concept people who judge this film because it's not a concert, they were there to create an atmosphere of sound in the whole arena, and it worked. That's why I liked it so much the songs fit the mood like 'Echoes' to start off with, because it did echoed all over that place. Next was 'Careful With That Axe Eugene', you can feel Waters really stretching the vocals to the point a volcano would erupt violently. Next we got 'Saucerful Of Secrets', the name itself explains it all, and when you mix Pink Floyd, and a place of ruins, it works there too. One Of These Days, well it's better on 'Meddle', but Mason really lays into those pig skins now don't he. Mademoiselle Nobs is probally my least favorite, but good effort with the greyhound. I like how they do a flip back and forth with pictures of distruction from Pompeii with the song 'Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun', they show figures on which almost human like from the ashes of that city that fell victim so many years ago from a violent volcano.

I always watched this on video (infact I would always rent it) and loved it. then this movie got released 1n 2004 and I bought it with my birthday. I liked the movie- but HATED THE DVD!!!! Here's why:

1. PFLAP was shot in a 4:3 fullscreen format. Here, they put it in ""Cropped Widescreen"" and cut off the top and bottom by putting black bars. Rediculous! Instead of a talking head during the interviews, we get a talking nose (lotsa nose-hairs!) more like ""Crapped Widescreen.""

2. They put in needless and boring interviews. Really annoying. They last for 10 minutes and get really boring.

3. Also, what's really a blasephemy is that they cut out ""Us and Them"". Rediculous! It's the best song they ever written. I can't believe it.

4. They edited ""echoes"" by making Nick Mason's sunglasses dissapear and reappear. How really crappy.

In the original (and complete) footage of Echoes Part 1, when the camera zooms in ever so slowly into the band playing Pompeii's ancient and empty coliseum, you are witnessing a young Floyd on the cusp of true greatness.

What I would give to see ""Atom Heart Mother"" live. Probably nothing, but it would be really amazing.

This movie gets you in touch with the band and holds some of their best work ever recorded. A must see and hear flick for any Floyd fan. This is rock and roll at it's best!

1861190,4,B00008S7KC,"Pink Floyd at Pompeii is an excellent document to a long lost era of one of the best bands ever, but most of you know this already. Like alot of people, the directors cut took a bit getting used to as I've owned the vhs for almost 20 years now.  However, I really believe some of the added parts are superior to the original. The added scenes usually take the place of the full band shots that occur during certain songs. These shots are of all of the band members and they look awkwardly close together and the whole shot just doesn't seem right. For example, in the original version during Saucerful of Secrets during the Celestial Voices segment the original would cut to all four band members playing. The problem is, it looks completely weird, Gilmour's hair is blowing from the wind and is covering his face when he sings in closeups , yet when it cuts to the group shot it's pefectly still. I could be mistaken here, but he also seems to be lip syncing in these ""group shots"" Another example, during Careful with the Axe, Eugene on the original group shot, Rick Wright appears to beardless, even though he has a beard the rest of the time. Now maybe he shaved during the recording of these shows or my eyesight really IS failing me, but these shots simply didn't work. It's hard to explain unless you've seen it but it looks really hokey and it happens during most of the songs. I'm surprised more people haven't mentioned this and I'm *glad* they replaced those parts. There are however, still parts where shots of pompeii and various pompeii artwork have inexplicably been replaced with inferior computer art and shots of abbey road. The ability to watch the original 60 min film is very nice, I just wish they made this a 2 dvd set and included the vhs film as well. Regardless, the interview segments in the directors cut have been  expanded over the vhs version and are really cool to watch. The studio footage is pretty good to watch as well but would have been better left as an extra, as some people have already stated. Despite these minor shortcomings, this is a very well done movie. The directors cut seems to get a bad rap from alot of folks. But the option to watch the original makes this worth the money in and of itself.",1120608000,4,2244,4.470731707317073

Plenty of extra features on this DVD - in which I believe that I might like a bit more so that I did the actual performance. Sound quality on this concert DVD could be better + there are too may extreme close-up - I thought.

1861212,5,B00008S7KC,"First off, let me set something straight. Pink Floyd Live at Pompeii is ""live"" in the loosest sense of the word. What much of the running time of this film consists of is Pink Floyd playing to an empty relic of a coliseum, there is no audience (aside from the viewer and a few sound techs). The track selection is utterly amazing and the execution is flawless: Echoes Parts I and II open and close the film and are undoubtedly the highlights of Live at Pompeii. The remaining tracks are some of Floyd's most challenging material such as Careful With That Axe, Eugene, Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun and Saucerful of Secrets. All of these tracks are interspersed with gorgeous landscapes and computer animation. But the real treat is being able to watch Waters, Gilmour, Wright and Mason flow off of each other's energy during performance. One of these Days is pulled off flawlessly with Gilmour's guitar wailing over Wright's pulsating keyboards. What really fascinated me about Live at Pompeii was the look inside the studio as Floyd was recording The Dark Side of the Moon. Just being able to watch David Gilmour solo over an unfinished Brain Damage should be reason enough for you to own this DVD. The interviews throughout the film have caught the band usually while eating. Waters is still content to be a jerk most of the time by mocking the director or the interviewers questions. Nick Mason has some prophetic words concerning the inner relations of the band which would eventually erode to nothing. Overall, this is a must own for any Pink Floyd fan and a fine addition to any classic rock fan's DVD collection.",1104796800,3,1631,4.706293706293707
1861213,4,B00008S7KC,"I tried to watch the Directors Cut with an open mind, setting my expectations low.  The graphics didn't bother me the way that they appear to have bothered a lot of reviewers.  I actually thought that they were kind of cool.  However, the shots of Gilmour and Wright singing in the studio during Echoes Part 1 completely ruined the flow of the movie for me, especially when they were shown making mistakes.  These shots would have made great special features or perhaps they would have fit in nicely between songs.  However, I thought that Maben's decision to insert them during the song was inappropriate and I am unable to understand what prompted that decision.  Fortunately, as many reviewers have pointed out, the Original Concert is still included as a feature.  Another bonus is that the shots of Wright recording the piano for Us And Them and Gilmour recording guitar for Brain Damage are given their own tracks in the Directors Cut.  Regardless of whether these were actual recording sessions or staged for the movie, they are very cool and I am glad that I can choose to go directly to them instead of having to rewind or fast forward to them.  This allows me to treat the Original Concert as the main feature and the Us And Them and Brain Damage tracks from the Directors Cut as special features.  If it were packaged this way, I wouldn't have any hesitation giving it five stars.  Because it is packaged with the Directors Cut as the main feature and the Original Concert as a special feature, I am deducting one star.  If you like Pink Floyd, this is definitely still worth buying.  In addition to the Original Concert and the Us And Them and Brain Damage tracks from the Directors Cut, I think the Maben interview makes this a worthwhile investment for Pink Floyd fans.  I found it very informative.  However, reviewers that warn fans of The Wall are correct.  If you are not familiar with the music that Pink Floyd did before Dark Side Of The Moon you are in for a bit of a surprise.

Do yourself a favor and watch the ""Original Theatrical Release"" version of it. It's in the menu there somewhere, and it's MUCH much better.

The songs are performed flawlessy, and matter of fact are even better than the ones on the original albums (the jam part in ""echoes"" for example). You are able to see the band close up, especially waters and gilmour (i figured out how to play the guitar solo is Echoes just by watching the movie). The best about this is that there is nothing from The Wall here. It's mostly from Meddle and some of their ealier stuff, before Waters got control of the band. Overall a must have for any music fan

This DVD contains great songs like Echoes, Set the Controls, One of These Days and a few others.

1861221,3,B00008S7KC,"I love this movie, because it shows the Floyd as a working band in a scenic location, even though it's dated, the overall influence of concert films has some roots in here (the focus on the band over audience)which you will see in ""Last Waltz"", ""Big Time"" and ""Stop Making Sense"".

The fans of the post Syd-era ""Saucerful"" to ""Meddle"" will absolutely love this film. It's basically the video version of ""Ummagumma's"" live songs, with some ""Meddle""(Echoes, One of These Days, Seamus aka Mademoiselle Nobs).

In between the Pompeii footage, you see the band working on ""Dark Side of the Moon"" (On the Run, Us and Them, Time, and Brain Damage/Eclipse) in the Abbey Road studios (which is also great for the Beatles fans), and chit-chatting in the commissary. The interviews are okay, not all that informative, although people will chuckle at Dave's comment about PF being a ""drug band"". I think that as far as it being in the film now that the ""making of"" has been released with most of that footage, I don't know if it should stay in...

Wasn't impressed whatsoever with the ""Director's Cut""...it didn't really add anything to it. It would also have been nice if one of PF took part in the commentary as well. Would rather have seen more ruins, or maybe some re-edits that would make the film look somewhat fresher and current.

Considering that there's so little of Floyd on video, they really could have put some things on here. The 1 hour ""Atom Heart"" concert they shot for PBS in 1970, the ""Brain Damage/Eclipse"" promo, and a ""Set the Controls"" filmed around this time would have been really nice.

But what is also sad when I watch this is that they didn't bother filming another live concert until ""The Wall"" which exists in bootlegs and has yet to be released as well as the post-Waters concert videos. What would be really great is if they did a video like Cure's ""Trilogy"", where they could do a full length concert of ""Dark Side of the Moon"", ""Wish You Were Here"" and ""Animals"" for posterity, which would be far more easier to pull off in 2004 than in 1977.",1096416000,6,2065,4.600543478260869

The original version is interspersed with archive footage of the band (David, Roger, Nick, Richard, etc.etc.)working on the Darkside Of the Moon album at Abbey Road. These snippets are interesting and informative - particularly wehere you see Roger operting an anologue synth for On The Run - for the first time around, but start to really grate on repeated viewings when you realise what a bunch of pretentious g*ts they can be, apart from Richard who seems pretty much down to earth.

The video shot in pompeii is one of the most atmospheric and haunting videos I have seen becuase it has no special effects to create the atmosphere, just an empty ampitheatre and the band. There are stunning versions of late early stuff, echoes, One of theses days, carteful with that axe, and saucerful of secrets.

The most awesome segment for me is the instrumental section of echoes with Dave gilmours guitar screaming amidst the theatre, capturing the experimental and exciting yet alienating and isolated atmosphere of their early work, some of it a bit disturbing and strange.

The DVD is a good package, with the recut version and and the original version presented in widescreen and 4:3 normal ratio. There is adocumentary, slideshows of screening posters, and different packaging for the VHS versions, as well as other stuff and a button which selects an item at random, very strange- trying to install the weird nature of the band, no doubt some of Storm Thorgersons work.",1095379200,6,1536,4.922779922779923

1/ Besides Dark Side and Wish You Were Here, I always thought that the Floyd flew a little too close to Spinal Tap territory but this DVD whilst nostalgically confirming that in parts they WERE Spinal Tap, it just doesn't matter, the rest is simply perfect.
2/ Corny visuals (revolving planets etc) and corny songs (Set the controls for the heart of the sun, purleez - Lotuses lean on each other in yearning, Under the eaves the swallow is resting??)
don't matter here, the overall effect is startling.
3/ Couple of genuinly beautiful and moving sequences (lump in the throat stuff) as follows:
(i)  opening Echoes part one intercut with the two lads in their Paris studio fluffing the lyrics is really effective
(ii) laying the piano into Us and Them
(iii)Gilmour putting guitar solos into Brain Damage, fantastic
(iv) when the keyboards kick in on Saucerful of secrets, magic
(v) final Echoes P2 with corny visuals really work nicely at the end.
4/ Interviews are funny and seriously nostalgic, look at Waters and Gilmour as they were back then or the drummer bloke who IS the guitarist in Spinal Tap, a classic English foppish twit complete with THAT moustache!

1861227,5,B00008S7KC,"Want to know if this DVD is for you?
LONG ANSWER:
Well, it depends on what kind of person you are, even if you're a Pink Floyd fan. There are many kinds according to the type of music and/or mood they prefer.
1)There are the solitary, silent people who prefer to stare at something and find beauty even in the patterns of the floor tiles. These people prefer to look beyond what can be seen or heard and find ""the spirit"" of something, no matter how caothic it may seem. These are the fans of 1968-1972 Pink Floyd's looong, strange pieces. I know somebody like this, a painter, friend of mine, and he was immediately hypnotized by ""Echoes"", in spite that he wasn't a huge fan of Pink Floyd. These people will really enjoy the original concert film. I did. If you dream about being alone in the desert and watch the sunrise listening to ""Echoes"", this is just for you.
2)Others prefer the glamour and the coloured lights of traditional concerts; they like interviews with artists, special 3D-effects, and Star Wars. They enjoy jazz and prefer more ""structured"" music. These profile correspond to Pink Floyd fans from ""Dark side"" through ""Wish You were here"". These could love the Director's Cut; however, some of them might be dissapointed.
3)And there are those who don't really appreciate jazz, classical music, or staring at anything. Those of you who listen to pop music all day or who think ""The Wall"" is the best Pink Floyd music ever, this DVD is not for you.
There are many kinds of art... There is simple-structured art, like pop music or naif-style paintings, whose beauty can inmmediately seen, but when trying to find the soul of it... well, there isn't any. And there is the other kind of art, that present in desolate De Chirico paintings, in El Bosco's obscure visions, and in the desert. This can't be appreciated in a first sight; instead, it needs to be studied and re-visited many times, in order to love it. This is the type of art present in ""Live at Pompeii"". I saw Shrek and liked it a lot the first time, second time it wasn't that fun and the third time it didn't capture my attention anymore. But Live at Pompeii is a DVD I will wear out.

If you really love the songlist, buy it. If you like Pink Floyd but don't like these particular songs, keep searching.",1086393600,10,2296,4.548309178743962

I can honestly say that it's the best thing that I own, and not just with DVD's.  It's the best thing I own, period.  I watch it pretty much every day.  The abstract clips of the history of pompeii complements the session so much, but even if it weren't there, it would still be amazing.  The four of them have never played so emotionally and thoughtfully, however drugged they may be.  This music really does transcend all things and it's worth every penny to buy this DVD.  Saucerful of Secrets... Careful with That Axe Eugene... Echoes... it's hard to pick my favorite out of the performances.  Don't be turned off by the fact that there aren't any of the more famous ""Wall"" songs or ""Dark Side of the Moon"" songs played live.

The visual effects of david Gilmour and roger Waters playing in front of the guitar is awsome, so is the fire in front of Waters singing. The pictures of the statues between shots are an extra treat. I only wish that the directers cut was better, but the lack of headings before songs is better, and the swimming letters are cool. The extra footage is good, and them making DSOTM is great.

1861254,1,B00008S7KC,"The thing about Pink Floyd is that when they are good they are brilliant but when they are bad (as with this movie) they are horrible. They have made classic albums that have stood the test of time such as Meddle, Dark Side and Wish you were here. But they have also made garbage. This usually happens when they let Roger Waters get carried away with his sound effects fetish. This movie displays the worst of Pink Floyd. How anyone can give this 4 or 5 stars is beyond me. I guess dropping acid before you watch it may be the trick. But for the sober crowd it is a big waste of time and money. One of the more annoying aspects of this movie: watching one of the best rock guitarists of the 70's, David Gilmour, sit on the ground and run a steel slide up and down his fretboard while Roger Waters bangs a gong (Gee-wiz I think I could do that). For some unforseen reason the interviewer/director badgers them about whether or not they fight with each other. He seems obsessed with that topic and whether or not they think Rock is dead. (It would be if Director Adrian was in charge). Bottom line - if you like sound effects and juvenile chatter then by all means blow your money on this ""movie"".

To set things straight, if the dvd had not included the original version of the film, it would not be worth buying. The director's cut version is quite lame (to say the least). Anyway, as far as the original film is conserned, the video quality is superior to the VHS version and the sound quality is great though it could have been better.

You'll love it.  It contains versions of ""Echoes"" and ""Careful With That Axe, Eugene"" that i personally think are superior to the original studio versions.

My beef is with the directing of the film.  For one thing, the editing is awful.  Usually with concert films like this, you try to at least roughly time all the scene changes on the downbeats within the music.  This was done (for the most part) very well and effectively in the original film, but on this directors cut he obviously wasn't even trying.  The scene changes are almost always either too frequent, akward, or just don't fit the mood.
The sound is certainly better than the VHS copy i have of the original film, but no amount of remastering can fix the low quality audio of the original tapes.  It's hardly distracting enough to make you want to turn it off, but it's a little dissapointing, especially after you hear Adrian Maben talk about how they went to great lengths to try and make it sound good... cuz it just doesnt.
Now, heres the obvious thing that other reviewers have pointed out... WHATS WITH THIS COMPUTER ANIMATION GARBAGE??  Its so cheezy and lame!  So is the whole concept he threw together of 'people from another planet coming to earth to watch the Floyd concert'.  Another sign that Mr. Maben just isn't a good filmmaker:  the opening scenes of ""Echoes"", which is a whole computer animation sequence of planets, satellites, ect. , the objects orbit at WAY too fast of a speed.  It makes the music suddenly seem rushed, when its supposed to be the opposite.
Bottom line... most of the added scenes are very out of place and should not have been added.
But, that said, there are some PLEASANT surprises as well.  Like all the never-before-seen b&w interview sessions, intercut into the original scenes that show them recording ""Dark Side Of The Moon"".

If you are used to productions like PULSE, you will be sorely disappointed. However, if you are used to watching some poor VHS transfers of concerts, this is an improvement.

1861263,5,B00008S7KC,"This is the best representation of Pink Floyd live you can buy.  It isn't Pink Floyd's best live material ever.  There are no official releases of the best Pink Floyd live music.  But this DVD gives you an idea of how good they would be in following years.
This was originally a concert movie shown in theaters in 1972.  The original movie consisted of Pink Floyd playing in ruins of Pompeii plus other sites in Rome.  In was 60 minutes of music and featured the standard Pink Floyd ""hits"" of the time, like Careful With That Axe Eugene, and Set the Controls For the Heart of the Sun.  It also included the new song from the album Meddle called Echoes.
In 1974, the movie was re-issued with about 20 minutes of extra footage.  The new footage consisted of interviews and showed some studio scenes of the group recording Dark Side of the Moon.  The new scenes were added between the music tracks.  I don't know if I liked the additional scenes.  They broke up the flow of the music.  Plus, when you went to see this at a midnight show, torched out of your mind, it was hard to keep awake through the extra footage.
This DVD contains the original 60 minute movie and the director's cut which includes the extra footage plus a few more extras.  There is also a extra interviews with the band, and with the director.  There is a history on Pompeii and footage of the band eating.  Video and sound quality are both very good.
The nice thing about this DVD is that it really gives you a sense of the power of Pink Floyd in concert.  You get a feel for the atmosphere of the concert, with the music blasting out of the wonderful surround sound system they used. And all the music is excellent.  I saw Echoes being played on a big outdoor screen at Universal City's downtown and it was very impressive.
There are some hokey, dated parts to the way the concert was filmed and the special effects.  Even in 1974, some of the effects seemed dated and cheap, like something you would see on your local TV station's dance party.  The direct even admits that some of the scenes didn't really work.  He wished he had the original film so he could redo them, but all the original tapes have been lost.
But, for the most part, the camera work and editing are excellent.  The correct member of the group is shown at the right time (except during One Of These Days).  It is certainly better than the filming and editing of many of the new DVD's like the ones from Gov't Mule or Roxie Music.  Those DVD's just jump all over the place and you never get the feel that you are at the concert.
Pink Floyd was a very exciting band to see in concert in the seventies.  They were always experimenting with the music.  They would try out songs before they recorded them in the studio.  Atom Heart Mother and Echoes were once combined.  Dark Side of the Moon originally started out as a piece called Eclipsed.  Sheep and Dogs were originally called Raving and Drooling and You've Got to Be Crazy and they were quite a bit different than what ended up on Animals.
In concert, Pink Floyd would also continually modify old material to keep it interesting.  When they went on tour to promote Dark Side of the Moon, they stretched it out to 60 minutes with wonderful solos.  They were so much more interesting in the seventies when compared to their reunion tours from 1987 and 1994.  In 1994, they played all of Dark Side of the Moon in concert, but is was pretty close to the studio version and had none of the energy or sponteniety of when they played in the seventies.
This is the best of Pink Floyd's live albums because it is the only one from the seventies.  The second best is the live version of the Wall called Is There Anybody Out There.  I think the live version of the wall is even better than the studio version (it works better as a live show).  Next comes Ummagumma from 1969 (which has many of the same songs as this DVD) and Roger Water's live release In The Flesh.  The live releases from the 1987 and 1994 tours, Delicate Sound of Thunder and Pulse are merely good.  There was also a TV show
done by San Francisco's KQED that is rarely shown.  But the video of that is not great and I think it was recorded in mono.",1077667200,5,4201,4.354755784061696

I hadn't ever seen this film prior to it's release on dvd, and I was only somewhat familiar with the music period featured on it.
So, from this perspective, I want to tell you that I think the Directors Cut is the better film to see for someone like myself, or especially someone new to Pink Floyd. I watched the straight concert film (non-directors cut) first, and while I did enjoy it, there wasn't always a whole lot going on to hold my attention throughout. When I watched the Directors Cut later on, I found that I enjoyed it more as there was more to see.
For the average person, seeing the unadulterated opening pan shot from the beginning isn't absolutely necessary. Maybe if you're stoned, as some reviewers seem to suggest here, slower passages where not much is going on such as this could be fascinating for you. I, on the other hand, drugless and with most faculties intact, found the ""punched up"" Directors Cut more involving with the inclusion of the space graphics & footage. Even with that, we still get a decent amount of the pan shot anyway.
I, contrary to some here, really liked the shots of artwork throughout the film too. These were some GREAT images to contemplate as the music was playing in the backround. I feel more connected to our shared human history when I see such great works of art and it was an enhancement to see them featured here on film. A wonderful marriage of sound and image, I thought. I also enjoyed the computer graphical representation of how Pompeii looked prior to the cities destruction. (I just wish there was a little more direct, one-to-one matching of graphics to actual scenic shots).
For those who have complained about the Directors Cut, I think the point to remember is that this film wouldn't have been made without his original idea and his drive to get it accomplished. If you think his new version is less compelling or isn't as well executed, fine. But,he deserves some slack here. I say we owe him some leeway to indulge in any way he sees fit, especially with the inclusion of the original film to salve any offended sensibilities.",1076371200,3,2384,4.638297872340425
1861266,5,B00008S7KC,"I saw a pristine print of this movie with a full house at the George Eastman House here in Rochester several years ago.  With its glorious opening zoom shot, great music (mostly from Meddle), insightful (albeit brief and scattered) interviews with the band members, and fleeting glimpses of them at work crafting Dark Side of the Moon, it instantly became a must-have.  But all that was available was a VHS copy, and I knew that this format couldn't do justice to the material.
I was elated when it was finally released on DVD, but also a bit hesitant when I saw that it was a ""director's cut"" - the original cut that I'd seen was just fine, thank you.  However, seeing that one of the extras was the ""original concert film,"" I figured that I couldn't lose, and went ahead and ordered it.
The bad news:  Neither copy is the same one that I saw at the Eastman - the ""original"" cut does not include any of the interview or recording session material ... just the music.  And the ""director's"" cut adds a lot of unnecessary outer space F/X and Pompeii art frills that sometimes distract from more than they enhance the core material.  (The continuity of the aforementioned opening zoom shot is destroyed, for instance.)
The good news:  At the very least, everything I saw previously IS on the DVD, even if I can't watch the movie in exactly the same way that I did originally.  And hey ... this IS Pink Floyd!  I've watched the film in its entirety five times since acquiring it and my fascination shows no signs of abating.  This is no self-congratulatory vanity 70's ""rockumentary"" (e.g., Led Zeppelin's ""The Song Remains the Same"") -- it's a true time capsule that yields innumerable insights (some unintentional) into a landmark rock group on the cusp of superstardom.  It captures the members at what would seem in hindsight to have been the apex of their camaraderie and collaborative music realization, and this makes it a must-see for any true Floyd fan.",1076112000,9,1958,4.662790697674419
1861267,4,B00008S7KC,"Pink Floyd was a very strange, intelligent and awesome band.
 I don't have any of them record but I have listened the classic albums The Dark Side Of The Moon and The Wall. I have also seen The Wall-movie, which was just great. Live at Pompeii was so intresting ans pleasure experience that I will buy some Pink Floyd albums.
  There are original consert and director's cut consert with interviews. The original consert works just great because there are no interviews that cuts concert intensivity and feeling.
 In my opinion, you can't find no filler tracks in the original consert. My favourites are Echoes part 1 and Saucerful of Secrects, which shows perfectly how creative, skillful and intresting band Pink Floyd was.
 Mademoiselle Nobs is a song in which you can hear dog's singing.
 Why I don't give this dvd five stars? Because interviews are stupidly put between songs in director's cut consert. If interwiews would have put on their option, I have maybe given this dvd five stars...
 There are also some extras for exemple pictures and history of Pompeii. If you like Pink Floyd's early songs, you should buy this dvd immediately.",1076025600,5,1142,4.855670103092783

I, like any loyal fan, already have it on video, but my copy was becoming run down.  Now with the dvd, I have the original and the new directors cut.  The directors cut has extra footage and is in animorphic widescreen, which I just love.  One of the great things about Floyd is watching them perform.  So, to see Waters and Gilmore together is cool.  I have the ""Pulse"" dvd, which is great, but is missing Roger Waters.  The scenic shots of old Pompeii and the ampetheater they play at are beautiful.  The whole movie is a trip, and any Floyd fan should enjoy this dvd.",1075680000,,677,4.275590551181103
1861269,5,B00008S7KC,"If you're a Floyd fan, then you know that the best way to experience their music is with both audio and visual.  That's why this new dvd, ""Live in Pompeii"" is a must have.  If you already own and love the video version like I do, you'll be blown away by the dvd.  It has both the original version (in pan scan, minus the interviews) and a new director's cut (widescreen, with added interviews) as well.  The visuals in this video are just amazing.  The ancient amphitheater among the ruins of Old Pompeii is awesome and a great place for the band to play.  There is a great mosaic shot of Nick Mason that is pretty trippy. The director's cut has footage from the band's recording of Dark Side, and some great interviews with the guys.  This is definitely a must have for anyone's Floyd collection.",1075420800,,797,4.417808219178082
1861279,3,B00008S7KC,"The music is great - I love the set list and their renditions.  However, this director's cut is not your typical ""director's cut.""  Typically a director's cut implies that there is more film footage, and that is true here with the extended interviews.  However, a lot of the original footage is deleted and replaced by cheesy (to me) computer animation.  And although the film as originally released is available on the DVD as an option, you can't watch it with the added interviews.  So that's why I've given it 3 stars - the movie's fluidity is lost with all these abrasive cuts to modern computer animation.  The coolest part of this movie, the slow pan toward the band in the amphitheater at the beginning, is completely lost by these edits.",1075161600,2,745,4.6923076923076925
1861280,5,B00008S7KC,"If you're reading this, you probably have already seen ""Pink Floyd at Pompeii"" at one time or other. The good thing about this DVD is that it includes the orginal cut. The image and sound are perfect. The main feature, though is not, in my view, as interesting and innovative as the original release once was. The diurector has chosen to add some scenes to the original cut, as well as some film from when he visited the band recording Dark Side Of The Moon. Ironically, an excelent DVD about the recording of The Dark Side Of The Moon has come out separately, but that is another story. In my opinion, this is better left untouched. It's still worth it, but always watching the original cut. The quality of the images in the Director's Cut looks inferior to me as well. Anyway: If you like ""The Floyd"" i guess my recommendation is buy this one, and watch the original (you' ll probably watch both and agree) and buy the Making of Dark Side Of The Moon DVD separately, which brings OWESOME footage and brand new parformances by Waters and Gilmour not included on this DVD.",1073865600,4,1072,4.5025641025641026
1861281,5,B00008S7KC,"Footage of classic period Pink Floyd is so rare and few, that Live in Pompeii is a real treat. It was filmed in 1971, at the peak of their musical genius and creativity (not to devalue the musical and conceptual brilliance of the masterworks Wish You Were Here, Animals and The Wall, but musically they reached their peak in the period between Meddle and Dark Side Of The Moon), and shows the classic line-up - Roger Waters (bass), David Gilmour (guitar), Richard Wright (keyboards) and Nick Mason (drums) - young, energetic, creative and unpretentious. At this point in time, pre-Dark Side Of The Moon, they weren't yet settled in a niche; they haven't yet made it into the consensus, and they kept experimenting and trying new things, messing about with synthesizers and recording techniques. In this DVD we see them both in the studio and in performance, as they keep exchanging instruments and experimenting, and that's what makes it much more interesting and alive than the Dark Side and The Wall concerts, let alone anything made after the split from Waters in 1983, in which point they were just bleating out their old hits again and again in the same way. Only just managing to break free from the influence of their originator, Syd Barrett, the Pink Floyd are still, in Live In Pompeii, in a transition and struggling to find their voice, yet at the same time not certain of the relevance of their music. Nick comments in one of the many interviews thrown in between the songs - `We might have become a relic of the past... to many we represent that childhood of '67, the underground scene...' - and at this point, there's little in their music that signals of their great break into the mainstream in 1973. In between the performances, we get to see little bits of the Floyd in the studio, in the first stages of creating their masterpiece, Dark Side Of The Moon. It's a fascinating historic relic and an engrossing look at history in the making.
The musical parts of the video concentrate on Pink Floyd's most experimental instrumental numbers - in fact, only two vocal numbers were included, excluding old stage favorites like Fat Old Sun, Remember A Day and Astronomy Domine and recent numbers like Fearless and San Tropez - which allows it to give us a real look at how they were experimenting with their sound at the time, and to see them live, undubbed, is priceless. Take the epic instrumental A Saucerful Of Secrets from 1968; as Mason keeps the savage and steady beat, Gilmour is sitting on the ground with his Fender in his lap, gently running a slide up and down it, barely touching the strings. Wright pounds chaotic and nearly random notes on his piano, while Mr. Waters, his bass laid aside, plays percussionist and strikes the cymbals fierce and hard. He then walks off to the gong, and starts beating the hell out of it. Wright moves over to his organ and Waters picks up his bass, and they pick up the rhythm. Not synths involved. On Roger's own Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun, he doesn't play bass at all; he just barely struggles with the lead vocals, and occasionally beats the gong.
The instrumental classics Careful With That Axe Eugene and One Of These Days we get to see the full ability of the Floyds' instrumental prowess, as they settle into hard and driving grooves with persistent drums and deep, powerful basslines. Careful With That Axe Eugene is shot by night, with images of bursting volcanoes juxtaposed with an ecstatic Roger Waters shrieking out the song's only vocals. The effects and editing may be dated, but the atmosphere is still mesmerizing. Synthesizers, whatever Floyd's criticizers may have been saying at the time, are used subtly and tastefully. In one of the interviews David and Roger discuss the suggestion that the synthesizers may have taken over their music, claiming rightfully that they're in total control of their music, and that electronic devices can ever only be means and equipment and never a replacement for the artist's creativity. Furthermore, they say, it's immensely important for a musician who wants to be in control of his music, to know all about the equipment, recording and editing. The film really does show Floyd to be a group of very conscious creators, who need to know and understand the final outcome of their efforts - it especially shows in the studio segments. This is and important trait that contributed a lot to Floyd's greatness.
A surprising and wonderful touch is the short number Mademoiselle Nobbs, a classic 12-bar blues. As Roger strums an acoustic guitar and David plays a soulful harmonica, Richard helps by holding the microphone for the lead vocalist - a lovely dog, who sings her bit in the finest blues tradition, in a soulful and heartfelt duet with Dave's harmonica. It sounds to me like the talented mutt is the same one who contributed her voice to the number Seamus from the 1971 Meddle album, and if you thought the dog's voice on that track was overdubbed, seeing Mademoiselle Nobbs live will change your mind. The concert is bracketed by the epic classic Echoes, which was split in half - a technique adapted on record only in 1975 on Wish You Were Here. Echoes remain, whether on record or live, one of Floyd's most wonderful and impressive numbers, and show their instrumental skill and creativity to the fullest. Strangely enough, this is the only song in the films that allows Dave and Rick to have their voices heard, while on their albums at the time they sang on most of the tracks.
Incredibly rewarding for Floyd fans, even those who are not as enthusiastic about the early material, is the extra footage added in 1973, which shows Floyd working on their upcoming masterpiece Dark Side Of The Moon. We get a chance to see David laying down the final layer of Brain Damage, dubbing the lead guitar part over the nearly complete song; we also get a glimpse of Waters messing about with the synthesizers while working on the classic electronic piece of musical paranoia On The Run, as well as Richard recording the vocals for Us And Them.
One final question - what's the matter with Rick's beard, and why is it fading in and out of existence throughout the movie? Because other than that, the illusion of a live concert is maintained most of the time, albeit one where the crowd is either centuries dead or carved in stone. The conception of the video, as well as the music, shows Floyd as what they were - one of the most original and creative (some might say pretentious, maybe) bands of their time, just one step before entering the pantheon of timeless music forever.",1073692800,156,6604,4.723570190641248

1861283,4,B00008S7KC,"I have seen the VHS version of this concert a couple of times in the past, and have always enjoyed it- I tell myself to be grateful that they have a live concert film from before Dark Side of the Moon. I have recently viewed the Director's Cut DVD and was delighted to find it had even more footage of the band ""behind the scenes"". Not only did it show them in the recording studio working on Dark Side of the Moon, but it also showed black and white film shots of just them talking- I think it's fascinating to see them doing something besides music, even if it's eating oysters. The sound of this film is perfect, and although the shots taken of the band while playing were kind of outdated (I'm thinking of the 32 shots of Nick Mason playing drums at the same screen), getting to see them play was awesome. I especially like seeing Roger Waters bang on their gong violently during Saucerful of Secrets. The only reason I declined to give this DVD 5 stars is the graphics that the director has added, supposedly to add to the ambiance and mood of the overall film. The shots from space and the shuttle taking off were actually on the distracting side, and I did not feel it played to the mood at all.
If you like Pink Floyd and the music they played before Dark Side of the Moon, you will definitely enjoy this- there are not too many opportunities for Floyd fans to see these guys actually play live- whether it be on a telivision screen or even on a CD. Enjoy!",1073520000,,1464,4.2888086642599275
1861284,2,B00008S7KC,"i got this as a gift and i was extremely excited, as Floyd has always been one of my favorite bands and i hadn't seen this movie in a few years (and not ever on DVD). The original film is amazing - clips of the band performing some of their best songs from the pre-""Dark Side"" era (Echoes, Saucerful of Secrets, Careful With That Axe Eugene, etc) at the ruins on Pompeii, interspersed with clips of the ruins and lava; there are also some good interviews and studio footage.
So I popped it in, thinking that ""director's cut"" meant maybe a little added footage in the studio, an extra interview. But NO!! The Director's Cut has all this ridiculous computer-animated outer space footage and slow motion clips of the band members in the studio spliced in over parts of the original movie - giving it a decidely modern feel (read: MTV/VH1 editing style) that, in my opinion, completely ruins the film. This could be forgiven if the original film was also on the DVD in its intact form, but the ""Original Concert"" in the special features is the performances only, with none of the interviews or studio footage from the original film. To get to those, you have to go back to the ""director's cut"" and scan backwards from the beginning of whatever chapter is after the interview - you can't directly access the interview at all.
Basically, this seems like director Adrien Maben's attempt to make some $$$ - he knows that hardcore Floyd fans will buy this absurd regurgitation of what was once a great concert film. My recommendation, buy the VHS on E-bay. This DVD strips the charm right out of Pompeii.",1073347200,4,1595,4.6

1861286,4,B00008S7KC,"Pink Floyd Live at Pompeii is one of the greatest concert films of all time, perhaps even the single best live performance ever put to film.  While I could appreciate the director's intent with this new version, his creative vision has past its prime and we're left with a rather uninspired spinoff of the original.
The director's cut features a few extra bits of footage thrown in, but they don't add anything special to the film.  What disappoints me is not so much that this footage was included, as it is used to ""cover"" bits of the original the director wasn't totally proud of.  For example, one of my favorite sequences in the original is the arrival and setup of all the equipment in the ampitheater.  That's been replaced by shots of cheap computer animations of planets with rough, geometric edges, obviously digital and saturated colors seeming to drift through space much too quickly.  Other additions include stock footage of the Saturn V rocket launch and the first moon landing.
I find it hard not to enjoy the film anyway, but that's strictly because of the music.  Fortunately, none of the music itself has been altered and the original cut of the concert footage is included as special feature, so I don't feel like I've been ripped off.  The other extras on the disc are satisfying, but not entirely up to the standard of quality I've come to expect from Pink Floyd releases.
If you're a fan of Pink Floyd, I'd highly recommend checking this out if you haven't already in spite of the changes.  If you're a purist though, you may be a little bit disappointed.",1072915200,5,1578,4.671480144404332

How 4 guys can produce master pieces, last time I saw them in Denver I think their was 12 or 12 musicians/singers on stage. In many respects they lost the raw energy they used to have prior to 'DSotM'. This DVD is a must have for new Floyd followers. It shows the masterpiece of 4 musicians. (And for once Mason is highlighted and you can see how well he really plays those drums!). It was during a concert at the Rainbow in London that all the power went out half way through Saucerful and he never missed a beat. Brought the tempo down, power came back on (they had their own generator! oil shortage and all) he brought it right back to where he was and on they went. Professionalism at it's best!
The video is ruined a bit by too many modern day images (it was 74! and actually shows how bad the original footage was.). Why use the space shuttle when a Saturn 4 blasting of the pad would have been perfect and it tune with the times. Graphics are great but again the computer-generated scenes of Pompeii took away from that 1974 look.  But, it's a keeper.",1072310400,,1187,4.299107142857143

There are some snippets of interviews with the band and the making of Dark Side of The Moon. You can practically forget the interviews - they're not something special. While Dave and Nick talk more about the music and being "" slaves to technology "" in the past with the music, Roger is on more of a political frame of mind ( surprise surprise ). A bit surpising that Richard wasn't asked for his opinion on things ( seems like a little flavour of things to come doesn't it? ). The making of Dark Side is a little interesting - some nice touches and an early glimpse of those Synthi AKS synthesizers or as Richard H Kirk of Cabaret Voltaire once said that they looked like "" suitcases.""

I saw Pink Floyd's Dark Side tour in 1973 and they performed all of the songs included here, except the take off on Seamus with the dog ( it is a treat). To me, this documents Pink Floyd's moment of ascension into their musical glory. I actually saw this underrated film on PBS back in 1975! The editorial reviewer hit the nail on the head with his cultural discription- completely in synch with seeing themself as ""Relics"" from the 1967 scene in London and San Francsico and wanted to break free of that stigma. A fate which the band managed to cheat!

 Truely, what is astounding to me is just what exceptional musicains these guys are! As when I saw them live, I was astounded that they could put on such an effective live show without studio manipulation. This movie also shows us this. The playing is what it is about.

  i've heard so many people say that pink floyd sucks live because it's just four guys standing around with their hair in their faces, and that's essentially what they do in this video, but that's the whole point i think, that four guys just standing around can exhude so much intensity and emotion just by being so into the music and their environment. it just shows that music isn't just about sight and sound, it's about atmosphere...",1070496000,3,1055,4.5661375661375665

You can watch them perform each track continuously one after another without any awkward breaks. The director's cut is just there to give some insight on the band and is just an effort by the director to create a different perspective.
I was amazed to see how well the original concert film was re-mastered. I couldn't believe that something filmed in the early 70s could be so crisp and sound so awesome. The band playing to an empty amphitheater sets the perfect mood and atmosphere for the concert. I have never felt so drawn into the music before. I liked how some of the songs were filmed at night. The dark setting adds to the eerie mood, as does the clips of the lava.

1861305,5,B00008S7KC,"This dvd comes with a widescreen directors cut and the original short 4:3 film.
The film was originally released on video years ago as a long version and a short version.  Until now, I'd never seen the short version so maybe it was only released in Europe.  The short feature doesn't have any interviews with the band or shots of the band recording dark side of the moon.  And the long version (not included here and probably the one you rented from your local video store years ago) was intercut with all the extra scenes.
The included directors cut is similiar to the original long version but has been rebuilt from ground up. It contains all the original scenes, interviews plus lots of weird scenes of moons revolving around strange planets, space ships taking off, plus new footage of Pompeii, etc.
Most people have never seen the original short or the directors cut.  And like a lot of purists here I watched the original short verson first and of course my first observation was the lack of scenes like Nick Mason complaining about the crust on his apple pie. I didn't mind the lack of interviews and such, and frankly, the original short plays just great the way it is. It sticks to the Pompeii theme and I like that a lot.
As a bonus the directors cut also includes some extra interviews which have never been previously released.  There is one very funny scene of a very stoned Roger Waters giving the director a very hard time during an interview.  It also contains new footage of Pompeii plus lots of scenes of space ships taking off, and moons revolving around strange alien planets.  It's kinda weird and you may not like it much at first, but it certainly grows on you and it was all done very well.
So my advice would be, if you're a purist, stick to the original short and then simply skip through the directors cut to see the interviews and studio scenes.
And also, the sound quality is just fantastic and the video quality will just blow your socks off.  It's just that good. It's amazing considering the original negatives have all been lost. And last but not least, the director Adrian Maben interview is also very interesting.  All and all, the entire package is simply fantastic and for the price of about $16, you'd have to be crazy not to get one.",1069372800,3,2272,4.5354523227383865
1861306,1,B00008S7KC,"Apparently, Pink Floyd should have renamed themselves the Nick Mason Band because the director was certainly infatuated with the drummer!!!  Occasionally we get a passing glance (and I mean ""passing"", because the camera moves right past them) at Gilmour, Waters, and Wright(about all we see of Wright is an extreme close up of his hands in the closing part of ""Echoes"").  This was frustating, because the Meddle album was one of my favorites. Except for a brief Dark Side of the Moon session, this baby is for friends of the director only.",1069286400,,539,4.8478260869565215
1861307,5,B00008S7KC,"First of all I would like to point for those who quite rightly did not like the director's cut, that included in this DVD is the original concert (minus the interviews) untouched by Adrian Maben totally unnecessary new indulgence.
Pink Floyd Live At Pompeii is probably one of the best music documentaries ever filmed, and captures perfectly the essence of the band, from choosing a location that fits the music and the mood of Pink Floyd so well,to deciding not to have any audience:the emptiness,silence and morbid history of Pompeii with its live volcanos add an invaluable depth (Echoes!) to the songs. Moreover,to watch the interviews, rehearsals and samples from the studio,recording Dark Side of The Moon,is to witness an unpretentious and raw creativity at work.
The film also offers an early indication and insight on the condition of the band, and the inevitable break up years later that was in a way waiting to happen. With all PF members admitting to a friction that resulted in many fights back in '71, and with Roger Waters obvious controlling and imposing attitude,it is surprising the band survived until The Final Cut!
The selection of the tracks is very good indeed, getting to hear again the 'forgotten' Floyd repertoire. The term 'Mind Trip' and 'Masterpiece' are overused these days, but one should really listen and as equally vital watch Pink Floyd to really understand what these terms mean!! To listen to Careful with that Axe Eugene, Set The Controls for The Heart of the Sun and the epic Echoes  is to be taken on a mind trip like no other music manages to take you in the true sense of the word(strangely and sadly these songs are very much omitted from Gilmour and Waters concerts-it would make a very interesting listen to hear them again using modern production/or with a new interpretation).
I also loved Maben's emphasis on Nick Mason's play, (in my opinion with Kansas's Phil Ehart and Eloy's Fritz Randow, the best drummer in rock, in all its genres).You will simply look in sheer amazement at this wonderful artist 'playing his heart out'.
Now to the Director's cut.
To be honest it was a total futile and strange exercise. In some parts I cringed at the new shots inserted! especially the Koyanisqaatsi influenced space rocket in first part of Echoes..the musuem shots of statues, or worst of all the virtual reconstruction of the Pompeii temples in the second part of Echoes!! It is bewildering!! Why would the very same man who conceived and directed the original film would want to tamper with it in such a cheap way?  I can not start to imagine!
Nevertheless, since the original concert is included, with little nice extras as well, and since it is Pink Floyd with their ethereal and timeless music, (hence my 5 stars) this DVD should at no account be missed.",1069286400,2,2801,4.8212058212058215

I've only seen the concert on VHS once about seven years ago, but I've watched the DVD version about ten times (ah, the joy of not having to rewind!). The empty amphitheater creates an eerie yet artistic setting. The sound, although only stereo, absolutely rocks.
I enjoyed the director's cut because it gave me a lot of insight on Pompeii and the state of Pink Floyd around the time the concert was filmed.
The DVD also has interviews of the band members during the recording of Dark Side of the Moon. It was intriguing to see clips of their recording sessions.

The emminent release of Live At Pompeii has been a hilite of my year so far, and since I ordered it I have been hanging around the mailbox like a moth to a candle. But I have to tell you, I am VERY disappointed with your product.
So this is the 'Directors Cut'...well Mr Director...you've had a shocker. Why oh why couldn't you have just left it as it was? The original version that i had on VHS was Perfect! But no, you had to go and throw a load of irrelivant shots of trains coming into stations and contemporary Italian Architechture into the mix, to what...make it better? Seriously Mr Maben, there was a time when you were a visionary, I mean to shoot a band like Pink Floyd in an empty Amphitheatre in Pompeii is genius, and the original Film was incredible, a real time capsule of a band at the peak of thier powers. Then to add in at a later date some footage of Them recording Dark Side Of The Moon along with a few crazed interviews and call it a 'Extended Version' was great! I mean, like you say, in the right place at the right time! But really, Mr Maben, that should have been it, you should have released the thing on DVD and been clear of it, for our sake.
The original film opens with a beautifully paced, log zoom of the band accompanied to the sweet sound of 'Echoes', lovely stuff, beautiful. So I have to ask you Mr French Director, what makes you think that by putting footage of a rocket ship flying through space towards earth over the top of the lovely zoom ENHANCES the film? What were you on? OK, you get the point, I'm deeply, deeply disappointed. As the Director of Live At Pompeii, you have a responsibility to us, the public, to do the best job you can to enlighten us with your film, but you have been selfish in that you have lost sight of what it was that you made all those years ago. Live At Pompeii is a Historical Piece of music history, and is something that SHOULD NOT be modernised to suit your wavering career. To those of us that love the Floyd, it goes beyond just the music. I cant speak for others, but for me, it's part of my heritage and who I am, and you, my friend, have desecrated that.
But there is hope.
I hereby say to you now Mr Adrian Maben, you can redeem yourself. Here's what you do. Re-release the concert WITHOUT  all your fancy irrelivant, out of context 'wizardry' and let us have, on DVD, the masterpiece that you once made, the time piece of a band overflowing with creative and exciting power.

1861320,3,B00008S7KC,"Pink Floyd Live At Pompeii
Pros:
On DVD - Finally!
Sharp picture and outstanding stereo audio!
The original concert footage from the 1971 Film is included as a Extra Feature.
Fantastic pre-Dark Side of the Moon - Pink Floyd space music.
The additional black & white interview footage from Paris in 1972.
Cons:
The so called ""Director's Cut"".  What a travesty!
Directior Adrian Maben seems like an intelligent man in his interview included on the DVD.
However, this so-called extended ""Director's Cut"" is a  good lesson in how to botch a really great concert film with bad editing and just plain stupidity.  It is difficult to believe that the members of Pink Floyd approved of these unbelievably inept changes.
The director's extras really detract from a pleasurable viewing of this film. For example:
Cheesy, worthless animation, inserted in the most inappropriate places. Even the animation of the reconstruction of Pompeii during Echoes part II adds nothing to the film.
Shots of a Subway (and a shot of an empty Subway station) during Echoes part I.  A truly bizarre decision. St. John's Wood? What could possibly be relevant about this random insertion?
Other random shots of modern day Pompeii - pointless and distracting.
Very Poor conception - Adrian Maben's idea of a rocket taking off from an outer space world and coming to earth to listen the the Pink Floyd concert at Pompeii is completely laughable.  As a result we get cheap space animation of planets and space travel which simply do not work on any type of conceptual level with this film.
Unfortunately, no additional film footage remains - it cannot be found.  The lost footage would have been a great addition to the extended version of the film and could have made for a decent Director's Cut.
Lack of the inclusion of the full 1974 release of the film which includes band interviews and DSotM studio sessions. These are included in the Director's Cut - but is it really worth watching again?
The ONLY reason I would recommend this film is for the Extra Feature that contains the concert footage only from the original 1971 film.  Five Stars for the Original Concert Footage on DVD!",1068336000,2,2153,4.866120218579235
1861321,4,B00008S7KC,"I just received my copy of this DVD from Amazon, and it's a wonderful DVD. Any film footage from the Floyd during the 60's/70's is virtually non-existent, so this original film, shot in 1971 at this ancient Roman Amphitheatre, finds the band at their pinnacle, enjoying a momentum that would last, at least, until their 1977 ""In The Flesh"" tour. The tracks are wonderful, and the sound, despite only stereo, has been beautifully remastered.
Then, why did I give it only 4 out of 5 stars? Because the new ""Director's cut"" is kitschy at best. Full of computer generated ""space footage"" (awful), plus DSoTM era interviews (some of them truly revelatory, and wonderful to watch), director Adrian Maben put in everything he could, despite the fact that most of that material was totally unrelated to the Pompeii concert. Thankfully, on the ""bonus features"" section, Maben had the good taste to leave the original theatrical film -unedited and uncut-, where the band performs their music, warts and all, as nature intended, and as millions of fans all over the world watched it originally. In my humble opinion, I think that the DSoTM interviews should have been included as bonus features, having the original film under the spotlight.
But, rest assured that if you like the early Gilmour era Pink Floyd, you'll absolutely love this DVD. The music is incredible, and the band are in top form. This is, probably, the definitive Pink Floyd live film we'll have from the classic years (at least, until something is unearthed from the 1970/1977 period).",1068249600,51,1544,4.9423076923076925

  Before this time Pink Floyd was hungry, had something to say and was looking for a direction, a vision if you like. Their early work was summed up perfectly with the release of this DVD.
It was not cropped like some may have you believe, the original was released 16:9 in theaters not 4:3 in VHS that was done later for the vhs release. The theatrical release came first. Also. not all of the songs are shot in Italy, Eugene,Nobs and STCFTHOTS were filmed in London because they ran out of time while in Italy and you can see them in a dark sound stage. It still makes this bloody DVD brilliant, and even though it is only stereo, wait until you hear echoes and careful with that axe eugene thru your DVD players surround sound. OMG, it is unreal!!!!Again, for just the sound alone it would have been worth it for the asking price. You can pretty much learn the entire song of echoes on guitars just from camera positions.
  Now to address some additions added into the film that were not there before. there are some space/planet features that are kinda confusing, as well as the CGI art of how Pompeii would have looked, which is not a bad idea given the whole concept of the ""Pompeii"" thing. Even the planet thing didn't bother me after the second viewing, and I am a die hard Floyd fan. I have a european version of the See Emily Play 45 Single that Syd drew of the ""Choo Choo Train"", though I must admit I am glad that they developed there own style and let the Beatles be the Beatles.
  It was somwhere in between a Saucerful of Secrets and the release of Meddle, particularly the line in Echoes starts everything special in Floyd to come, by its obsurdness and obscurness thatr makess it so wonderfull...

  Now I know they have have complete Live AUDIO/VIDEO Recordings of Dark Side of the Moon 1972-1974 tours, Wish You Were Here 1975 tours and Animals 1977 In the Flesh tours. If Jimmy Page can work his magic with his masters for both the DVD and How the West Was Won and that footage is older than yours(PF's). What is stopping you, third party Pink Floyd footage is nice. But we would rather se see something directly from Roger/Dave/Nick/Rick/Strom/EMI and best of, making of classic album DVD isn't cutting it any more, you have released, DSotM like 80 times allready, how about a live animals tour or a live DSotM 1972 Hollywood Bowl Tour. A nice DVD 5 1/2 hour Package is what we want. Not a 1/2 hour BBC VH1 presentastion is what we want.

1861342,5,B00008S7KC,"This new DVD release is different than the previous VHS version so hold on to your original video tape! (that version may never be re-released again).
""Live in Pompeii"" has been for years (and will remain) my #1 desert island video, music or otherwise.  The slow panning cameras behind the amp stacks, the bubbling mudpits and boiling lava scenes and the rough, unpolished band performances in the ruins of Pompeii's ampitheatre are powerful and at times scary.
The music, like the setting, is spacious and slow moving but haunting and bold below (and above) the surface.

DVD Director's cut: This is a real mess and would be even more confusing to those not familiar with the original film. My main gripe here is not the newly added ""space"" visuals and other non-related footage. The real bugger here (for me) is the so called ""widescreen"" format, bullocks! What they did instead was take the original film and squash and crop it to add black bars. It's simulated widescreen, so what we see is actualy less of the viewable print! It doesn't look/feel right at all and I found it unsettling to watch. Mind bogglingly atrocious.
But... we do get extra audio and visual footage of the band in Abbey Road which is prized by a (Water's era) Floyd fan like myself. And with the added visuals it does give us another, alternate version. So for that it's better than not including it at all.  Still, what were they (Adrian?) thinking?
DVD original concert : This is the jewel of it all. I'd never seen just the straight 60 minute performance film before. It's cohesive, effective. Pompeii was a dead on great choice choice for the band to re-create their heavy yet airy soundtrack.
There is only an occasional overdub or visual blip. (Overdubbed bass on Madmoiselle Knobs).  BTW- Seamus was Steve Marriott's dog and was being cared for by one of the Floyd while Steve was away on tour. I'm not sure if the dog in Pompeii is Seamus or not.
As for the lack of Rick Wright interview on the origianl Abbey Road footage, that never bothered me. He never was a very vocal or opinionated member, despite his priceless contribution to the band/music. What we do get is his utterly sublime, hovering and vulnerable high vocal along side Gilmour on Echoes. That always gives me goosebumps and itself is worth the price of admission. And to cut Echoes down the middle to bookend the film was a fitting and perfect framework.
DVD extras: Just more, good stuff to include. They even have the covers to several famous bootleg albums of the 70's! and a map of Pompeii! good fun.
The DVD itself is a fantastic value chock full of goodies.
The sharpness of the audio and video is  a vast step up from the
previous  versions.

I am rating this concert as the best Pink Floyd performance (although the recent Waters and Gilmor's concerts despite their age are very close). Nevertheless, the Director's Cut is actually quite inferior to the original movie (thanks God they included it also on the disc). First of all, it is anamorphic 19:9, i.e., parts of the picture is cut out and it shows. I would have rather concentrated on remixing the sound into 5.1 as they did with the Dark Side of the Moon. This was a missed opportunity to have an early Floyd in 5.1. Second, the movie is so watered down that the title ""Live in Pompeii"" becomes irrelevant. It looks like as ""Live in the Cosmos"" or ""Live Somewhere with Occasional Presence in Pompeii"". The original movie was perfectly balanced with respect to shots from Pompeii and around. I also don't understand the logic behind rearranging the original song sequence (I might be little conservative here). So hang on to those VHS tapes people (actually, the quality of the video of this VHS rivals many other DVDs and it is even better in some instances, as for example Peter Gabriel's Secret World live).",1066780800,,1213,4.780952380952381

We are fortunate that the original concert film is included on the DVD. Go directly there - it is in ""features"".
The Director's Cut pretty much destroys all the virtues of the original terrific film.
One of the best aspects of the original film is that you see each vocal, solo, etc. completely without the distraction of other scenes, and thus it gave you the feel of being there. This was aided by the exclusive use of tracks for the cameras, so any motion was a slow pan, much as if you yourself were walking across the front of the stage.
This is all ruined - in the Director's Cut - by using footage from outer space and the studio.
Plus, some of the footage is simply not in the Director's Cut, like the opening footage of the stage being setup, and the very slow zoom into the stage.
And, to top it off, the ""widescreen"" aspect of the Director's Cut is simply cropping (so it is not ""OAR"") - for example, in the great guitar solo in Echoes, the Director's Cut cuts off the left hand on the guitar in many scenes.
So, in short, Pink Floyd fans should buy this for the superb versions of Echoes and Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun, and go straight to the original version in the ""Extras"".",1066780800,12,1238,4.294871794871795

Here's the deal:
The original version of the film, released in 1972, was 61 minutes long, and consisted only of performance footage from the Pompeii amphitheatre and a Paris studio, plus some extra footage of Pompeii. This was shot in full-screen 4:3 and is presented as such on the DVD.
Maben went back into the Abbey Road studios while the band was putting together DARK SIDE OF THE MOON in 1973 and shot some documentary footage of the band recording and talking. The new footage was spliced in between some of the original performances for the film and the result was released in 1974 in America; it was maybe 70-something minutes long. Unfortunately, this edit has not made it to the DVD.
Now, this new version uses more footage from Abbey Road, some B&W
footage of the band in a studio in Paris, new shots the director took of Pompeii, a whole bunch of archival footage of space exploration, and new titles that look made for a straight-to-video release instead of the Godard-esque ones we had with the original (Willy Kurant was one of the cinematographers.) This is about 91 minutes long, and has been inexplicably matted to a 16:9 format.
I must say the new footage seems extremely out of place. It doesn't match visually with the old footage, looking very straight-to-video. Much of the editing of the original is broken up with splices to new stuff the director just couldn't keep out (""Hey, Pink Floyd is ""spacey""--- I'll put in computer-generated shots of planets!""); the result is more a series of thematically related music videos than a unified movie. What really gets me is that there's an interview on the DVD with the director where on multiple occasions he touches on why the original and almost-original versions of the film were so special, and then he proceeds to destroy that with his new version.
In the original, the ruined Pompeiian setting gave the movie a
palpable sense of silence and isolation; in the new version they're not much more than a pretty background. The original version held its shots long enough to give the viewer an opportunity to absorb the spacial setting for himself; now we're treated to the short attention span version of things. And why was this this thing masked to 16:9 for the new version? Having a dad who's worked on satellites and space probes my whole life has given me an appreciation for space footage on its own merits; but using simulated flyovers of Mars's surface to accompany Pink Floyd is worthy of a fan's website, not a feature film... please, let the spirit of ""Laserium"" rest in peace.",1066780800,509,2976,4.758220502901354
1861366,5,B00008S7KC,"I saw Pink Floyd at Pompeii in 1979 at a midnight theater show in college. It was part of a double show, the other being Flesh Gordon. Needless to say, very few in the crowd were there to see the Floyd. However, for a minority (including myself), the film
had quite an impact. I had to wait years to find the VHS version, but once I did, it was played over and over. I was always intrigued by the shots of the Pompeii ruins, artwork, bubbling mudpits, and lava flows intertwined with the soundscapes of Floyd classics, especially Set the Controls and Careful with that Ax Eugene. It provides a powerful atmosphere of isolation and despair. Unfortunately, in the DVD version, Adrien Maben has inserted some space footage (planets and spaceship) and other modern imagery (Naples) that distracts from the original mood of the theatre version. The DVD does contain some extra footage of interviews and Dark Side sessions, but the real power of the film is the concert footage. Fortunately, the DVD has an option for concert footage only. This is a must for all serious Floyd fans, and anyone who is intersted in their pre Dark Side phase. The performances of Echoes, Ax, and Set the Controls are probably the best ever recorded. Get the headphones, turn out the the lights,  put on the Concert Footage option, and enjoy.",1066780800,7,1316,4.696969696969697
1861367,5,B00008S7KC,"Hip-O Records presents ""Pink Floyd:Live at Pompeii"", from the concert featuring original cues from the legendary foursome performing classic originals.  Sit back and enjoy the classic performances by one of the great performers of our time.
Entire concert is a standout with the magnum opus ""A SAUCEFUL OF SECRETS"", ""CAREFUL WITH THAT AXE EUGENE"" and ""SET THE CONTROLS FOR THE HEART OF THE SUN"".  A few of these ""live"" renditions are better than their studio predecessors, such as the two part ""ECHOES PART II"" ~ and the puzzling ""MADEMOISELLE NOBS"".  This is one of those great things about concert films ~ it allows a band to see how they come off visually, and gives them a chance to improve their appeal. Only with ""At Pompeii,"" Pink Floyd takes that mirror-element and uses it to further display their innovations in music.
Hats off to Adrian Maben (director), Universal Music and all the staff who had a hand in bringing this to the fans.  A must have for all who have followed the careers of each musician that we know as PINK FLOYD!

1861368,5,B00008S7KC,"It's great to finally own this Pink Floyd classic on DVD in it's finest glory.  The Video transfer is fabulous.  I never imagined it could look anything but VHS-scratchy.  Now I can finally watch it as much as I want without fear of wearing out the tape.
The only down side to it is the Director's cut.  Pink Floyd's fan who have never seen the original might not have a problem with the new material but, to any fan of the original the new shots in the Director's cut are cheesy and distracting.  Luckily both versions are included on the DVD, so you have the opportunity to watch both and make up your own mind.  Along with both versions of the film, there are a slew of extra features such as a documentary, lyrics, photo gallery and other ""Odds N' Sods.""  All in all this is a must-have, for both new and experienced Pink Floyd fans. peace.",1066694400,,844,4.337579617834395
1861369,5,B00008S7KC,"This DVD is incredible. I would recommend it any fan. And Pink Floyd never went ""bubblegum-mainstream pop"" in their career. DSOTM was written at a time when David Bowie and T-Rex were taunting their pop fantasys' and PF wrote an amazing album with things we all experience everyday. It had the lyrics, music, and an incredible concept that was shown so incredibly. PF never gave up, sold out, or wrote easily-digestible-by-the-masses ablums. Roger Waters is one of the greatest lyricists' of all time and PF worked unbelievably hard to mold all their work to their vision. At no time did they make music like any other. As far as selling out goes, they never did it. Stanley Kubrick wanted ""Echoes"" for 2001: A Space Odyessy and PF told him no. They did do soundtrack albums but they did the whole album from scratch and soon after released those albums under their name. The only people that Roger Waters allows to recreate ""The Wall"" in theatrical form is young school children, not even college students. Their albums were never easily-digestible either. The song ""Pigs (3 different ones)"" from ""Animals"" was about Mary Whitehouse and how she tried to keep their ""...feelings off the street."" PF was never just trying to make a lot of money. They used to buy entire blocks in a town and give all the homes to those who could not afford them. They gave to charity and did a lot to help those who could not help themselves. When Roger Waters played ""The Wall"" on the Berlin Wall he donated all profits to charity. Keep in mind that there were four hundred thousand people at that show. PF doesn't try to brag about how they are generous because they are extremely humble, unlike U2. Yes they wrote some songs lamenting the life of being rich pop stars but don't forget they charitable things they did with a lot of that money and just because they are huge rock stars doesn't mean they enjoy it, if you analzye some lyrics you would understand that. Stardom just came with their amazing music, they would have made it even if no one was listening. (...)",1066176000,8,2054,4.63013698630137

1861371,5,B00008S7KC,"A classic concert film set on the backdrop of an ampitheatre in the ancient Roman city of Pompeii, until recently it was only available on VHS. Now, the film has recieved the DVD update and I'm quite pleased with it.
An assortment of earlier Pink Floyd songs are played by the band, including ""Careful With That Axe Eugene"", ""One Of These Days"" and ""Echoes"". While I am disappointed that the audio is only stereo, it sounds better than it ever did on VHS.
The film itself is rather interesting, mixing footage of planets and other space exploration with shots of the band and the destroyed city of Pompeii. The footage of Pompeii is best used during the beginning of ""Echoes, Part 2"".
Overall, it is a decent upgrade of the original film, featuring just enough new stuff to warrant a re-release. A great insight into Pink Floyd just before they hit their peak, and for a good price too!",1065830400,10,886,4.578616352201258

1861373,5,B00008S7KC,"This was my first visual experience of PINK FLOYD, I saw it at the midnight movie around 1978. I've been a Floyd fan since 1973 when I heard The Dark Side of the Moon for the first time.
 The VHS version was released in 1984,and I had to have it.
 I am now waiting patiently to purchace the DVD when it is released.
 The setting is the ancient ruins of a Pompeiian amphitheater in the Mediteranian Sea,recorded LIVE (no overdubs!) and is an excellent revelation of the Floyd's musical expertise and precision. It is a haunting setting, the Island was obliterated in 79 A.D. by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius,official excavation did not begin untill 1748.
  The music played is Pre-Dark Side of the Moon, obscure to many listeners, but a real treat for those interested and open minded enough to enjoy it. It is PINK FLOYD in it's purest form, before Roger Waters started controlling the band. It is a great music video, not like todays MTV videos, changing angles and clips so fast you can't keep up with what's being played (or lip synced and mimed)! It's about the music, playing the music and seeing the music actually being played! It does drift off of the actual band playing from time to time, but you don't even realize it!
  Also included is a scene of the band taking a lunch break, I love the part when Nick Mason orders a pie, without the crust!
And an interview takes place with footage of the making of The Dark Side of the Moon. Very cool!
  Some tracks are :ECHOES PARTs 1&2; CAREFUL WITH THAT AXE, EUGENE; A SAUCERFUL OF SECRETS; ONE OF THESE DAYS I'M GOING TO CUT YOU INTO LITTLE PIECES; SET THE CONTROLS FOR THE HEART OF THE SUN; and MADEMOISELLE NOBS(also known as ""SEAMUS"" on the album ""MEDDLE"")
  Also the original release was September 1972 (not 1974 like Amazon.com says)!
