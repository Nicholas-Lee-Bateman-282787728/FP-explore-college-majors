This is a disjointed collection of comments from artists and lacks the thoughtful analysis of the WGBH series.",1462492800,,248,4.904761904761905

Great price and fast service but Three of the tapes were damaged in shipping. Should have had bubble packing around tapes. Internal plastic parts had small pieces broken off and jammed and damaged tapes. I can hear them rattling around and see them stuck in the tapes.  These tapes damaged before shipment from seller because other tapes from Amazon in shipment were good.
Too much trouble to return.",1336953600,,444,4.766233766233766
7902209,4,B000002KPF,"I purchased this video series for my high school History of Rock and Roll class.  I was thoroughly impressed by a majority of the material in this series.
Good points:  Excellent footage of rock and roll heroes (Beatles, Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Led Zepplin, etc.) as well as lesser known groups (The Hollies, Gerry and the Pacemakers, etc.).  Outstanding interviews from artists and figures such as Hank Ballard, Carl Perkins, Ozzie Osborn, Dick Clark, Bono, Eddie Van Halen, Jackson Browne, Bruce Springsteen, Little Richard, Mick Jaggar, Tom Petty, Lindsey Buckingham, and countless others.  Footage of various historical events help put the music in perspective (civil rights, Vietnam, sexual revolution, etc.).
Bad Points:  Some material may not be for younger audiences.  Nearly all volumes (2 & 3 excluded) have some PG-13 language (including Pete Townsend's liberal use of the F-word).  A couple of tapes (I'm thinking of volume 6 & 8 in particular) have some female nudity.  Anyone thinking about letting a class view this should keep that in mind.  Some movements in Rock and Roll are touched on too lightly: Soul, Motown and funk are kind of grouped together, Jazz Rock is barely mentioned, etc.
Final Verdict:  Probably the best Rock and Roll series out there now.  We need Ken Burns's take on this subject.",980985600,136,1318,5.083720930232558
