7824894,4,6302379539,"Single Bars, Single Women was an 1984 TV Movie that takes on the singles scene mainly from a women's point of view. A wry sexy drama that explores close friends on the brink of womanhood who  attempt to meet men at a singles bar. The action takes place at Bandini's a water hole for the lonely and broken hearted.

A great ensemble cast of TV show greats make up the regulars at Bandini's including Paul Michael Glaser ( starsky and hutch) Shelley Hack, Tony Danza ( taxi ) Christine Lahti , Emmy Award Winner Mare Winningham, Jean Smart ( frasier) and also with actor/director Keith Gordon (christine and back to school). Rick Rossovich of Top Gun fame plays one of the single men.

They all come to the bar looking for action but really wanting love.  The film attempts to explore  the uglier side of the bar scene but only as much as a TV teleplay will allow. The cast does a a good job of providing a full range of personalities that populate the singles bar.

Director Harry Winer uses the Dolly Parton song Single Women, and a band called The Kincaids at Bandini's for pop song covers.",1219708800,,1091,4.457286432160804
