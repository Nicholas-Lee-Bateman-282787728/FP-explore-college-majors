The music is very good, the animation average. One of my biggest complaints with this series is the fact that Aya & Tooya are like Miaka & Tamahome clones, which really really takes away from the character. I keep associating Aya with Miaka's stupidity and Tooya with Tamahome's bland personality. Some of the episodes feel like fillers to drag out the storyline, but hey, the series moves along at a decent pace and ends pretty well.",1077753600,12,611,4.719626168224299
1904388,5,B0000A9GKQ,"I really like Ayashi no ceres (ceres,celestial legend)!
This is only the first 12 episodes, but everyone of them is great.
Only Downfall is Touya... hes annoying, and I mean reaaaaaally annoying... More annoying that Aya's dub voice (well i don't know about that)
I really like Yuhi and Chidori's dub voices, fans of Zoids; Chaotic Century will reconize them as Van and Fiona's voice. Another few they'll reconize is the Grandpa's voice (Rosso's voice), Shizumi (Viola's voice), Kagami (prozen's voice) and I think Aki is Raven's voice (i could be wrong). However great those voices are, if you hear Aya's voice it will be a giant turndown for this series, I suggest you watch it in Japanese first (Aya's voice is really good in the Japanese version).
This series has it all, Horror (things that WILL scare you first time you see it), Humor (Oda Kyu is the best, and so is Alex... really funny characters), Romance (Chidori loves Yuhi, Yuhi loves Aya, Aya loves Touya.. its like a soap opera... I think Ceres likes Yuhi too...) Action (what else would you expect from a athletic cook martial artist like Yuhi? Even Touya, I have to admit, kicks arse sometimes... Plus Ceres fights, and Wei ^_^) and blood (Who can resist blood? best part of the series, heh)
Who cant help but resist this serious? Its beautiful, and dark... Much darker than Fushigi Yuugi ever was",1072828800,10,1363,4.755274261603375
1904389,5,B0000A9GKQ,"I would consider this to be one of the best animes ever. It is like Sailor Moon, except with a better plot, more action, romance, and gore. It is the best ever!",1070841600,2,160,4.03125

7996389,5,B0000A9GKQ,"I had only read the books that this show is based on, and I was worried that like with most things they would cut things out for the tv series. However, they did not! The show followed the books almost spot on. The quality was great and if you love the books you will love the show.",1286150400,,282,3.9649122807017543
7996390,5,B0000A9GKQ,"Anime has become a fast growing form of entertainment here in America and should be looked at with a very different mind-set.  While some is indeed far to over the top and completely inappropriate to be classified as cartoons, others are simply there to provide a slightly more sophisticated take on the childish entertaiment of cartoons and animated movies.

Ceres falls in between these two absolutes.  While it does not contain some of the more explicitly adult material(sexual content, drugs, etc.), Ceres does have a more graphic element in the showing of violence. There is some sexual reference, but it also provides a medium for the correct questions to be asked about that side of interpersonal relations.  The balance brought into the story by well formulated questions posed by the characters allows for continued thought not just simple acceptance.

Viewers need to remember that these are not cartoons regardless of the fact they are animated.  If a person can step back and appreciate the difference between cartoons and anime, sound judgment can be made about what should be watched for entertaiment quality and content.  And what anime should be avoided based solely on the uselessness of the material.",1214438400,,1218,5.121212121212121
7996391,3,B0000A9GKQ,"Though I had rented the first disc of this item, Yu Watase is one of my favorites shojo artists,but Fushigi Yugi is litte better becase that anime has less blood.
  Overall this is one of the few shojo anime that action in it.",1205539200,,226,4.232558139534884
7996392,5,B0000A9GKQ,"Aya is a teenager girl and her twin brother name Aki, who are members of a wealthy powerful family. On Aya 16th birthday she was given a special present which was a test and she failed. She is found to be the reincarnation of a teenyo (celestial madien), and when shaken, she will transform into Ceres, the tennyo. Due to legend, if left to live, the recarnation of Ceres will bring ruin upon the Mikage family. Aya quickly found out she is haunted by her own family, who plains to kill her.",1124668800,10,491,4.3478260869565215
7996393,2,B0000A9GKQ,"As I read the plot in the item description, I thought this was going to be an awesome anime. I've also seen Fushigi Yugi (which I liked enough to give this show a try). Ceres Celestial Legend does not have near as much as romance drama in Fushigi Yugi, a plus for me, but it also lacks a strong bond between the characters. Aya is done pretty well, but the many of the other characters are introduced too quickly and then killed off too quickly. Things get a little confusing. For instance, after Aya escapes from her family, a couple guys suddenly pop in and bring her to their house. If these characters were people she knew from school, it wouldn't have been so bad. Their introduction could have been much better I thought.

Another problem I had was with the originality. SPOILER: It turns out that some of the people in Aya's family want to use her angel blood to make super humans. I wish the plot was more unique than that. How many shows have been around the government wanting to make super humans? The few filler episodes also don't help the situation.

I wouldn't bother with this anime even if you are a Fushigi Yugi fan. Everything feels rushed (the plot and the character development) and there is a lack of originality. Even the animation and music score is not that good.",1110931200,7,1288,4.476595744680851
7996394,3,B0000A9GKQ,If you are going to watch it read the manga first it is soooooo much better than the anime but nonetheless it was a good movie but aya's voice is really annoying!,1104451200,2,162,4.09375
7996395,4,B0000A9GKQ,"Wow, this is really close to being an EXCELLENT series. I will note that I actually would give this a 4.5/5. For a suberb English dub and descent animation.

To start off, the Opening Song is one of the hottest opening gimmicks of all time! This piano piece ""Scarlet"" is beautiful.

Watase Yuu's is the manga successor behind Fushigi Yuugi. And well, Ceres has proved to be much better.

Somehow, I agree that its somewhat similiar to Sailor Moon. It has fighting, romance...its your Modern-day fantasy drama. Yet, this is definitely not childish like SM. This series gets violent quickly. It just got the same elements of art and romance as the classic SM.",1103328000,5,657,4.745614035087719
