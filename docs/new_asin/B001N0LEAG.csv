8322690,1,B001N0LEAG,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD ABOUT THE BOISE STATE BRONCOS. This dvd is boring as heck, dry narrating voice, some of the players are referred to by they're position rather than they're name. Worst of all it does not even include Ian Johnson who is arguabley the best bronco ever. Thank goodness I only spent $10.00 at Fred Meyer on it. Plus there are many more legends left out. Also the legends should extend to the coaching staff as well as the players. How Boise state allowed this dvd to be made is mind boggling.",1258243200,3,508,4.3578947368421055
