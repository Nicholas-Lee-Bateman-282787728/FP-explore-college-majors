Do you really want to create more toxic trash for landfills? Say no to these things, unless you want to see them on the sides of all roads..only not picked up like beercans because there's no recycle value.",1100217600,13,233,4.4186046511627906
2176028,5,B00068RELO,"This film is amazing, which I had the pleasure of seeing at the Toronto Film Festival.  I laughed and cried throughout the film and I was especially moved by Penelepe Cruz's performance.  It is a great holiday film for the entire family.  Palminteri's direction really captures the spirit and magic of the holidays in New York, which is always a treat.  ...",1100131200,18,357,4.709677419354839

Keep the Quality that you now have in your products, and I Will

2176049,5,B00068RELO,"Noel is an amazing Christmas movie that few people know. It has an amazing cast, Alan Arkin, Paul Walker, Susan Serandon, and Penelope Cruz, with a wonderful role for Robin Williams. At first it seems dark and depressing, but at the end is full of hope, love, and the warmth of strangers helping each other through life's difficult moments.

The acting and the script are lame and boring. you can tell right off the bat that it is not going to be a good Christmas theme, and should not be rated PG, but at least PG 13 or worse due to the sleaze factor - I too was ""wondering why this would be rated PG"" with all the promiscuous scenes in the first few minutes?

2176180,4,B00068RELO,"This is a movie well worth watching if you want something pleasant  - and can handle something different.

I usually think these kind of feel-good movies are contrived, and come off a continuous print-mill of short stories that have happy endings.  Well, I have to say I figured out the ending for Susan Sarandon at the earliest possible instance (but I bet you don't), and I was very pleased with myself about that !!!

And all the other resolutions of the character's problems were equally brilliant and satisfying, if sad in at least one instance.

So why not 5 stars - well - it's a low-key movie and amply achieves what it set out to do, so let's be happily content with that.

Definitely worth seeing.",1427500800,,707,4.571428571428571

You can't easily predict the plot and even when you think you know how it plays out, it does not go so smoothly that you are left off the hook- excused from thinking. There are some bigbstsrs in this and I'm sure they didn't get paid big. They did the work because they thought the script was worthwhile. I do too. It has a real Christmas message - one that is clearly and refreshingly devoid of commercialism and consumerism. But it. You won't regret it.",1419120000,,508,4.473118279569892

2176256,1,B00068RELO,"I can't comment on the quality of the actual dvd as other reviewers have about this film (saw it on a DVD set with A Christmas Without Snow-that WAS a good movie) but as far as the story goes, it was a stinker.

I wouldn't even classify this as a Christmas movie and certainly NOT for young children. The acting, with the exception of Susan Sarandon, who was good, was overall unbelievable and contrived. The story did not have any message for the most part, which is what I expect and enjoy in Christmas movies.

SPOILER: Having a guy getting his hand broke to get into the hospital, domestic abuse topics, ""dirty dancing"" type tango with a scantily dressed,Penelope Cruz and in bed with her boyfriend, Alan Arkin acting like a crazy old guy after killing his wife's supposed lover...what kind of family Christmas film is this?

I even thought the name of the movie was so inappropriate, like they just didn't know what else to call this mis-mash of scenes so picked something off a Christmas card!!!

I liked the way it went between stories.  and had a little connection between these different characters and their situations.  The backdrop was Christmas time but it didn't dwell on that.  I will definitely add this to my list of movies to watch around Christmas, and probably other times of the year as well.  It showed how people can change; how we are better people when we show compassion.  I liked the ending; it was very touching without being over the top.

Susan Sarandon has been caring for her mother (who has Alzheimers) for so long that duty has overshadowed all other emotions. Until she meets Robin Williams. Dying priest or Christmas angel?

I miss Paul Walker dearly, which is odd to say for someone you've never met. But as an actor, his goal was to convey emotions that we can all share. He does an excellent job at it.

It's ironic and touching. People's chance encounters can have such a profound effect on the lives of others. We never know how a kind gesture or word could change the direction of a life or a mind.

I really liked Penelope Cruz, especially dancing the Salsa (very sexy).
The interconnected stories were pretty good although the old man in the reincarnation segment kind of got on my nerves. He acted as though this poor guy was supposed to accept his very weird beliefs/advances!

Despite this, this was a pretty good movie and well worth watching.

Some of the acting was not bad, but none of the actors had anything to work with, and I do not understand why some of these actors agreed to do these performances.

The cast and acting were excellent, and the story line ambitious, but many of the loose ends it tried to tie up and connect by the end of the movie were left somewhat unresolved. None of the stories, except perhaps the Susan Sarandon/Robin Williams plot, were strong enough to stand on their own. Presenting them as ""parallel stories"" did not work.

2176441,4,B00068RELO,"Anybody viewing this flick unaware be forewarned.  This film, though not taking a hardline against Christmas, examines those who approach the holiday with a sense of dread and grateful when the hoopla is over.  After the film was over I went outside for a cigarette.  I came back inside my wife was beside herself with tears letting the menu screen run over and over without shutting it off.  I've seen her react emotionally to other movies, Nicholas Sparks type stuff, but never to this extreme.  This is not to suggest ""Noel"" is a bad movie.  It's a very good one but one has to look past the Hallmark Channel packaging the disc comes in.  The film's positives have to be the assured hand of first time director Chazz Palminteri who juggles multiple, sometime overlapping, storylines beautifully.  I can honestly say I've never seen Susan Sarandon better.  She plays a woman who life serves a series of curveballs, most recently coping with an aged mother hospitalized with Alzheimer's disease, yet somehow perserveres.  The highlight here for me is the look of moral victory on her face after she wins a pathetic miniature artificial tree after dredging up the saddest Christmas story at a lonely bar on Christmas Eve.  I would have given this film the full five star treatment but that would indicate that I love this movie when the case is I strongly admire it.",1322956800,,1366,4.770212765957447

This movie has an all star cast which made it what it was.  If the cast was not as talented as it was, this could've been a flop.  Each actor brings life, emotion and believability to their roles.  If you are wanting to see another side to Paul Walker, this movie will do it for you.  It's not a typical Paul Walker role.  He's sensitive and shows emotion, not just a shoot 'em up, adrenaline rush.  His light New York accent was believable and not forced.  It was just a good, old fashion, feel good movie.

2176447,3,B00068RELO,"""Noel"" reminds me a lot of made-for-TV holiday movies that feature ensemble casts with a loosely connected anthology of stories. This time, however, the primary cast is almost exclusively A-list and features Alan Arkin, Robin Williams, Susan Sarandon, and Penelope Cruz. This is good, sentimental entertainment if you know what to expect and focuses on people who feel only tangentially connected to the holiday season because of the sadness in their own lives. This adds some welcome downbeat grit to a storyline that might otherwise seem very contrived. Despite what the DVD cover implies, Susan Sarandon's character is the central one in this story as it is largely through her interactions with other cast members that we see some changes in their lives.

On the positive side, there are some excellent performances here from Sarandon and Williams and it's a treat to see one of Penelope Cruz' earlier English-language films. The filmmakers also do a great job of supplementing some New York City location footage with more extensive footage shot in Montreal. This really does look like Christmas in lower Manhattan. On the negative side, not all of the subplots are well-written. Alan Arkin's subplot is, to be blunt, very creepy and I cringed to see just how disfunctional one of the romantic relationships in the film was. I'm not entirely sure if some of the more outre characters' redemptions are as sincere as the filmmakers want us to believe. Better writing would have improved this.

Regardless, this is a good adult-themed holiday movie that you should try after watching perennials like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" or ""A Christmas Carol.""",1293494400,,1649,5.103703703703704

But the stories of 6 individuals: young couple with pre-marital difficulties; middle-aged woman in crisis (mother with Altzheimer's; older man with psychological problems over an earlier murder... do not fit well together, and that's because of severe script problems... made further problematic, but two OTHER plot lines which make NO sense of an ex-priest/ghost on his deathbed AND a young man in search of re-creating a wonderful childhood memory of a Christmas spent in an Emergency Room Christmas party!

2176468,2,B00068RELO,"Ultra-realistic misery for six or seven characters for 85 minutes followed by happy endings that are improbable even by Christmas movie standards.

People who like socialist realism will like the first 85 minutes but will throw up at the end.  People who like Christmas movies will find the first 85 minutes torture, but if they stick it out, may like the last 5 minutes.

Two of the characters (Sarandon and the cop) are relentlessly obnoxious throughout the movie.  Two others (Alan Arkin and Penelope Cruz) are non-characters: their roles are one note.  Two others (the Robin Williams character and the young guy who broke his hand) are sympathetic.  All of them seem to be playthings of the gods, since every circumstance throws one more punch at them.

This movie bears no resemblance whatsoever to ""It's a Wonderful Life.""  I don't know why the Amazon reviewer is so desperate to promote this loser of a movie.

The about-face done by the cop character was psychologically totally unrealistic.  So, it's hard to rejoice with Penelope at the end.  She's going to be miserable.

There are several unintended belly-laughs in the movie.  For instance, the cop's partner keeps harping on the old guy as a dangerous nut case.  The first three or four times, it is understandable if annoying.  But when the partner pops up at the cop's apartment door and immediately goes into the same song and dance, it's a hoot, like one of those slapstick routines from a silent comedy.

Bottom line: there are so many good Christmas movies, many of which haven't gotten the attention they deserve.

Susan Sarandon is superb as the lonely editor who has spent most of her adult life caring for her ailing parents, and whose mother is now burdened with Alzheimer's.  Sarandon is a lonely woman, looking for love, but afraid to live for herself.

Paul Walker gives perhaps his best performance to date as young cop Mike, whose jealousy is jeopardizing his upcoming marriage to beautiful Penelope Cruz.  A chance encounter with a waiter (Alan Arkin, in a touching performance) gives him the incentive to change.

Marcus Thomas plays another lonely man who resorts to having his hands broken so he can spend Christmas in the hospital, where at the age of 14 as an abused child, he had his best Christmas and he wants to participate in the hospital's Christmas party.  Robin Williams has an uncredited but understated role as Charlie, a man who comes into Sarandon's life and whose secret brings her peace.

2176476,3,B00068RELO,"Good solid ensemble cast makes `Noel' a moderate success. As far as the script by David Hubbard goes, it is very earnest and sentimental, maybe too sentimental for some viewers. But that is not a problem to me. For all the impressive names included here - Susan Sarandon, Alan Arkin, Penelope Cruz, Paul Walker (yes, he is good), and uncredited Robin Williams, `Noel' might not be what you expect to see at Christmas or anytime you want to be sentimental, for the film is mainly about the characters (and New Yorkers) who do not particularly like the yuletide.

And probably that is exactly the point. `Noel' follows the life of those who'd rather stay out of the parties and feel-good atmosphere of the Christmastime. Susan Sarandon's Rose, hard-working divorcee, is so much occupied with taking care of her hospitalized mother that she is not willing to spend the night with the handsome co-worker who is clearly in love with her. Paul Walker's police officer Mike is so jealous a guy that he is always watching his beautiful fiance Nina (Penelope Cruz). Besides Rose, Nina and Mike, we see the life of Jules (Marcus Thomas), Artie (Alan Arkin), and Charlie (Robin Williams). The film is directed by Chazz Palminteri, who appears briefly as `Arizona.'

We find the lives of these people intertwined on the Christmas Eve. One life influences another in the unexpected way, but all lead up to the miraculous results. Some of their stories get sentimental when they cross the fine line between the natural and supernatural, but the same thing had happened in `A Christmas Carol' and no one would be offended with the appearance of the three ghosts.

[TOO QUIRKY TO SOME] In spite of its beautiful picture (by Russell Carpenter, `Titanic') you cannot call `Noel' all joyful or delightful. The pretty talky script is full of confessional monologues, which are sometimes painful to hear. Not that the film is dismal. It should be called heart-warming experience, but the characters are so quirky at times, and even plain weird at worst, so it is hard for me to relate to some of them. Arkin's character is a borderline case of stalking, and Jules that of obsession. What they do (which I cannot reveal here, but it is suggested that they do it every Christmas) is too much for me, but the film asks us to take it as it is.

There are some insightful moments in `Noel' when the characters are outside the weak story. Surely we say, as Rose does, we are very busy at this time of the year (as if it is a blessing) when we meet someone we know. And the fact may be that we feel really isolated. Susan Sarandon embodies the utter loneliness of Rose with her skilled performance, which could have been used more effectively with a better story. In fact, she is too good.

I say this complaint because the film does worthy attempt to show the people who'd rather not have the Christmas spirit, but finally come to accept it. Rose is the most natural, and convincing. As to the rest of the characters, their quirkiness is a little bit of a stretch to make us believe their personalities. Besides them we have the stereotyped images of Nina's family or Mike's partner, and the all-too-familiar jokes based on homosexuals, which are not helpful at all The film is good, beautiful to see, and so is Penelope Cruz, but with more ordinary characters it could be much better.",1135814400,5,3358,4.694397283531409

We love to sit down together and watch movies but this one was a disappointment. It was rated PG but to me it was more like a PG-13 rating. It had alot of bad language and scenes about sex and pre-marital sex. After about 30 minutes of the movie I finally turned it off, because it was offensive for my family to watch. As far as I'm concerned it will be going in the garbage. I consider it a wasted $19.99. Wish I had known about it before I bought it.

2176479,4,B00068RELO,"NOEL is an unabashedly romantic little film, the type of movie Hollywood used to make for Christmas seasons before the toilet mouth Bad Santa, etc type became popular.  Perhaps the time has returned for us to examine how the world can come together at this time of year, sort of a good omen that we just might all start taking care of each other again!

Chazz Palminteri takes on directing this story by David Hubbard, surrounds himself with a top notch crew of actors, and capably and sensitively brings off this little story of the interweaving of five lives on a Christmas Eve in New York City with all the tenderness and associated joy of placing old and loved garlands and bangles on a tree.  It is a perfect film for re-discovering the meaning of Christmas.

Christmas Eve in Manhattan finds various characters who are in turmoil at this special time of the year. Successful book publisher Rose Harrison (Susan Sarandon) fights off depression by being kind to everyone: her lonely life is centered on spending her non-work hours tending to her mother who has advanced Alzheimer's Disease (she is divorced without children and without love).  Across the hall from her mother's hospital room is a comatose man who never has visitors, and when Rose brings him an angel ornament for is window she meets Charlie (Robin Williams) who apparently has been visiting.

Elsewhere in the city is Jules (Marcus Thomas) who informs strangers that his only good Christmas memory as an unwanted and abused kid was one he spent in a hospital after a beating: he plans to have his hands broken so that he can spend the night in the hospital where he hopes to discover joy.  And then there is police officer Mike (Paul Walker) engaged to gorgeous Nina (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) whom he inadvertently drives away with his jealous behavior.  Mike is observed by old Artie (Alan Arkin) who recognizes Mike as the reincarnation of his deceased wife and longs to establish a close relationship with his newfound love.

All of these disparate characters interact by coincidence: Rose mistakenly intrudes on Nina's family gathering only to end up in a cafe with Nina sharing her secret grief for which Rose offers empathy and lessons.  Mike confronts the strange Artie who collapses and lands in the hospital where Mike senses his history and gently offers him empathy.  Nina and Mike face a condition that alters their relationship, Rose discovers a secret about Charlie that allows her to learn about love and compassion and forgiveness, etc etc etc.

These are little miracles, the kinds of everyday occurrences that our speed of life ignores.  If it takes a film of this nature to help us gain awareness of the importance of personal peace, companionship, forgiveness and love, then hats off to Hubbard and Palminteri - and to a wonderful cast of fine actors enjoying their craft.  Highly Recommended for everyone with a strong sentimental streak!  Grady Harp, October 05",1130284800,18,2952,4.887775551102204
2176490,4,B00068RELO,"For those who prefer nutshell versions, here's a review of Noel for you:  a good Christmas movie that will appeal to viewers that find themselves in the ""middle zone"" during the holiday season.  By ""middle zone"" I'm referring to those that aren't fanatically overjoyed by Christmas to surreal heights, but also not loathing December 1 every year.  The subject matter is ""middle"" as well...it's neither a fairy tale nor a depressing drama.  It's a slice-of-life look into the lives of what probably represents a good 75% of the population at Christmas time.

The movie stars Susan Sarandon, Paul Walker, and Penelope Cruz, and includes a supporting cast with some well-known names as well.  It was a surprise to me to discover how large a role Robin Williams (uncredited) plays in this movie.  I happened to stumble onto this movie because of three main factors:  its composer, its marketing, and its technological introduction.

Alan Menken is my favorite composer, so long before the movie was released, I knew it was coming out.  It was a surprise to me, then, when I visited my local theater last Thanksgiving to see ""The Incredibles,"" and nested within the lid of my soda was a promotional CD containing a trailer and the title song for ""Noel.""  Being curious, I visited the official website to find that it was also the first title being released on a new DVD format called ""Flexpay,"" a new process whereby a DVD (once exposed to air) would become unplayable after approximately 48 hours.  This alone peaked my curiosity and, along with the other two points of interest this movie generated, prompted me to order the Flexpay DVD from Amazon.com.

What I found was a movie I could relate to more closely than I would normally have anticipated.  Being one who generally looks forward to the holiday season, I found myself quickly relating to Sarandon's character--a middle-aged executive type living alone AND (with the exception of visiting her mother in a hospice) spending the holidays alone.  Her only true desire being to see Alzheimer's release the grip it has on her ailing mother for just one moment, she tends to miss some of the things around her many would label fortunate.  ""The hot guy at work"" wants to date her, but she freezes up; yet, her genuine character shines through as she shows a little extra love to a patient across the hall from her mother--a patient she knows NOTHING about.  Her story showcases a kind-hearted, sympathetic, and genuine woman you'd find more often than not at Christmas time.

Meanwhile, two separate (but eventually interconnected) strories are running in parallel:  one of a man whose greatest Christmas party memory was when he spent Christmas as a child in the hospital.  Finding that times have changed, his measures turn desperate as he tries to find some way to duplicate the experience and relive the childhood memory once more.  Doing so uncovers a painful past and an answer to newly uncovered emotions.

The other story involves a typical dating couple (Cruz and Walker) with a seemingly picture-perfect holiday life and a storybook romance.  This dreamland is threatened, however, by an overpowering jealousy Walker's character has for any male that comes in contact with his girlfriend.  Already hanging on by a thread, the relationship takes an indefinite pause after Walker walks in on Cruz decorating a Christmas tree with a coworker (as a gift for Walker) and violently erupts in a fistful of anger.  Along the way, Walker's character crosses path with a restaurant waiter (Alan Arkin) who believes Walker is his dead wife, reincarnated.  Arkin's character becomes a realtime test for Walker as he learns the fine line of balancing jealousy, skepticism, and realization.

I enjoyed the movie for it's lighthearted presentation of what could be considered hefty subject matter.  Because of this, the movie is not dragged down as a depressing melodrama; rather, it presents a look at how life is for most of us in some way or another.  Nobody wants to be alone...we want to be understood...and we want to feel a part of something.  Sometimes situations we might consider as enormous may seem trivial to others.  Sometimes we don't realize how blessed we may be.  ""Noel"" objectively presents all facets of life during the Christmas season, and leaves a couple of surprises for the viewer--all of this without leaving you with an in-your-face solution for how the holiday blues should be handled.

In my opinion, I was more excited about trying out Flexpay and hearing new music from Alan Menken--other than that, I didn't expect much.  What I received, instead, was a rather enjoyable film that dared to present Christmas as a reality that some may be too hesitant to acknowledge...all of this while leaving the viewer with a warm, positive feeling instead of depression or cynicism.  I found myself watching it more than once, and inviting others to watch the DVD as well (as long as the Flexpay system would allow the data to remain intact).

""Noel"" may not be THE holiday movie for everyone, but it certainly is something new, entertaining, and unexpected.  I recommend this movie to anyone looking for something different yet introspective during the holidays--especially those who, deep down inside, really DO believe that miracles can come true.",1126224000,18,5313,4.969457013574661

2176497,4,B00068RELO,"With Penelope Cruz, Susan Sarandon, Alan Arkin, Robin Williams, Marcus Thomas, Paul Walker, this a movie that's loaded with talent.

It is not your typical, light-hearted, Christmas miracle movie.  It is, without apology, a tear jerker.  Have your tissues ready when you sit down to watch it.

Each of the interwined stories begins with people that are at emotionally painful crossroads.  By the end, all have the characters recieve the miracles that hope, love, and forgiveness provide.  On the downside, all this interwininging, ddn't make the movie better.  It added unnecessary complexity that made it harder to form an emotional connection with most of the characters.

Since it seems that a lot of people are reviewing the Flexplay DVD (and not the movie) here's my two cents.

I really like the convenience this approach offers.

The disc played flawlessly, and I won't end up with my typical 4 plus dollar late fee my new release 2 day rental.  With late fees I usually end up spending $8 to $10 per rental movie.  This makes the $4.99 plus $2.50 shipping a virtual bargain.

I like having total control over when I can watch the movie.  With rentals, you're under pressure to watch ASAP.  I hate returning movies unviewed because I don't want the late fees.

With Flexplay, I don't find having a 48 hour view period after I open the package) to a problem.

Being able to give the gift of a movie at $5 is a plus.  Making a $20 to $30 investment in a permanent DVD is something I just don't do.  If that's your thing, more power to you.  I'll wait and rent it, but this Flexplay movie is an even better option for me.

To begin with, my wife ordered the movie back in November...and it wasn't until this weekend that we had a chance to enjoy it.  We're too busy to be able to plan on having time to watch a movie so having a DVD ready to go when we are is a big advantage.

You can't even buy an acutal dvd of it, and i also discovered that it is only playing in 12 movie theaters in the country.  No offense, but if you were to see this movie, you would ultimately wonder why.  I just hope something changes this stupid flexplay or at least apply it to bad movies.  Its to bad that a lot of people won't be able to see this movie, since it's next to impossible to see it unless you were just lucky enough to come upon it on tnt last weekend (mind you, it's not playing again on tv anymore also).",1101945600,9,802,4.141935483870967
2176522,4,B00068RELO,"I think the film has some good acting by Paul Walker, Susan Sarandon, and Penelope Cruz and some enjoyable plot twists that will entertain those looking for an enjoyable Christmas story in a modern-day setting.

The movie isn't likely to win any major awards, but it's better than most holiday dramas and many non-holiday films.  I think young and more mature adults alike will enjoy NOEL. It's an excellent ""date"" flick.

Penelope Cruz will appeal to both men and women but for different reasons, but I think children and young teen viewers should be ""spared"" her bulging cleavage and ultra-mini skirts.  I was most ""surprised"" by Paul Walker's performance.  Early in the film I thought his character would be 1-dimensional (i.e., an over-the-top jealous lover), but I think he gives a believable performance as the ""macho hunk"" who is a man of heart, soul, and some depth of character.

Robin Williams and Susan Sarandon redeem each other and contribute to an uplifting climatic twist to end the movie on a hopeful, redemptive note.  Definitely worth seeing.",1101859200,43,1060,4.988636363636363

The acting is great, especially Susan Sarandon and Paul Walker, and even though Noel is technically excellent, it feels like a labor of love rather than a big Hollywood production.

I watched Noel on a Flexplay disc, and I was very impressed by this technology.  I understand why some people want to collect DVDs that will last for ever, but I rarely watch movies again, so I rent most of my movies.  I got the Flexplay disc instead of a RENTAL, and if I had rented the DVD I would have it for less than 48 hours (until midnight of the next day), my time would start the moment I walk out of the video store, the DVD would probably be scratched, it would be about the same price (my store charges $4.25 for new releases), and I would still need to take it back.  If this was a regular DVD for such a new movie, it would probably cost more than $18.  I used to give Blockbuster coupons as stocking stuffers, but Noel will do nicely this year.

I wouldn't order a DVD by itself and pay $2.98 shipping for a $4.99 product, but ordering together with other items I can get free shipping, so that is not an issue.",1101686400,15,1235,4.32034632034632

NOEL presents the true spirit of the holiday season in an inspiring, contemporary story of hope, forgiveness, love and redemption. It's Christmas Eve in New York City, and with a little help from each other, five people discover new meaning on Christmas Day.

The message of the film is about hope; it is a movie about miracles that touches people of all ages, from all walks of life and in all circumstances. The problem is that it is too much ""pie in the sky, by and by"" for my taste. I kept expecting the story lines to merge, but they kept following their own course, however ridiculous and unbelievable that might be, and then it was over.",1101686400,,738,4.590909090909091

2176528,1,B00068RELO,"Noel played on TNT last night, and it was a pretty decent Christmas movie. Not groundbreaking, not classic, but enjoyable and life-affirming in just the way Christmas movies are meant to be.

Flexplay, however, is NOT life affirming. It just another manifestation of our disposable society, where ""convenience"" is king and the waste we leave is a secondary consideration, when it is considered at all. It will by its very nature create more waste, both in the useless-after-48-hours discs and the packaging these come in. Even assuming these were biodegradable, this would still assume an active role in recycling on the part of the consumer-which is nice if the buyer chooses to recycle, but this cannot be relied upon.

Moreover, Flexplay is simply unneccessary. For those who value convenience, Netflix and Blockbuster online deliver, more cheaply and with about as simple means of delivery and return as one might imagine. Don't want to drive to the store? No problem. Don't want late fees? There aren't any. And the discs are reusable.

If you want to see Noel, I'm sure it will play on TNT again and again during this holiday season. But with several major studios considering development for disposable discs, we have to send the message early that we don't want this wasteful product.",1101686400,10,1292,5.0
2176529,4,B00068RELO,"Perhaps the most interesting thing about Chazz Palminteri's ""Noel"" is its most unconventional screenplay. Since no one else has given one of the film's sweetest secrets away, I won't do it either, but suffice it to say that there's one more ""ornament"" in this cast.

From a young man whose only happy Christmas was one spent in the ER when he was 14 after his stepfather broke his nose, to a lonely, middle aged woman whose altzheimer-stricken mother is her only company at Christmas, ""Noel"" is full of strangely different characters whose Christmas threatens to be full of emptyness, sadness and abandonment.

Instead, their lives are transformed by the smallest, most seemingly insignificant acts of kindness-ones they perform for others. They (and we) learn that it is truly in giving that we receive the most.

A sweet story, ""Noel"" only asks that we believe in miracles and promises that our faith will make miracles happen. A lovely tale.",1101600000,7,944,4.962025316455696

2176541,4,B00068RELO,"I've been collecting DVDs for quite some time.  Out of the hundreds that I do have, I may have watched a dozen of them on more than one occasion.  The rest of my collection collects dust or gets borrowed by friends who often don't return them.  My point is, owning DVDs doesn't make sense for everyone. I've changed to renting more movies than buying but find often find myself without enough time to get my money's worth from an unlimited rental plan like I'm on at Blockbuster.  If there were a way I could rent movies and keep them for as long as I want without a committment to rent a certain amount, I would be all for it.  It's even better if I don't have to worry about returning the movie like with these flexplays.  I see this technology serving that purpose.  And in terms of cost, it's a bargain for $4.99.  Especially when you think of the movie Noel.  I noticed that the movies website says the Noel is (or was) in theaters this holiday season.  So to think I get to watch a brand new movie on my schedule without committment for five bucks...makes it a good deal for me.",1101600000,23,1084,4.295566502463054
2176542,1,B00068RELO,"I bought this movie and it was a good show, but the media it is on is doomed.  Eventually technology will be available to copy flexplay discs just the same as a standard DVD.  Not only that, most consumers want to ""own"" their movies.  Plus, I don't know of a video store that rents its movies for five bucks unless they're intentinonally trying to fail (but I live in a small area and don't know what the prices are like in the big areas).
  This will go the way of DIVX -- it will last less than one year.  Its only hope of survival is for rental purposes.  That means your local video store has to constantly restock the Flexplay discs driving the cost of the rental over five dollars because if they have to constantly restock their titles that means there is a demand and they will raise prices.
  Some !sshole wrote a review saying it is ridiculous to worry about the garbage these things are going to cause (he must work for Flexplay).  Well, the truth is that if it did catch on (which it won't), it would create slightly less garbage than McDonald's.  I know I threw mine in the garbage after I watched it.  Imagine hundreds of thousands of homes in the U.S.A. alone watching two movies a day on Flexplay -- how much waste does that make? The CD long boxes were eliminated for such concerns and so will Flexplay.  The Flexplay discs can be recycled, but how many consumers will actually bother?  If you have to recycle the disc isn't it the same as bringing it back to the video store?  Late fees?  Join netflix. It is easy.
  This is simply another attempt for movie studios to discontinue DVDs so consumers can never own their video libraries.  They want you to buy Flexplay discs so they can make a killing on their movies long after their theatre run.  That's what DIVX was and that is what Flexplay is -- a total and complete rip off espically when it comes to the honest consumer who does not copy their DVDs.  It's always the honest people who get shafted for what the dishonest people do.  Renting them is fine, but if they try to replace DVDs with Flexplay their sales will suck just like DIVX and have to go back to DVDs.
