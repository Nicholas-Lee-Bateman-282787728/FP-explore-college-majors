If you enjoy any of ""The Lost World"" movies or TV shows based on the book by Arthur Conan Doyle, you will probably enjoy this ""Land of the Lost"" series. This was definitely made for family entertainment and it does not fail. The cast is good, and the sets and music add to make a great production by Sid and Marty Krofft. Children will especially enjoy it.",1037836800,2,387,4.315068493150685
