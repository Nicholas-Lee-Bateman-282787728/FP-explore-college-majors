5297473,5,B009AGEZ8S,"It is, indeed a must-have for fans of made-for-tv sci-fi. Wow. Too many hyphens, there. It was not a pilot for a Star Trek series. As another commenter has mentioned, this Hugo-nominated Gene Roddenberry gem is post-Trek, and actually a pilot for its own series, ""Questor"", which never materialized, though several teleplay scripts were written. It was a brilliantly inspired concept in its day- a damaged artificial lifeform searching for its identity and purpose. I have often thought that Questor was the inspiration behind V'ger from ST: The Motion Picture, and the character Data, from ST: Next Generation. Robert Foxworth and Mike Farrell brought great chemistry to a fresh and original teleplay by Roddenberry and Gene L. Coon. I, too, have a closely guarded, treasured copy on VHS from cable. I consider The Questor Tapes, along with Colossus: The Forbin Project, to be some of the best sci-fi of its day. It's a definite TiVo alert. I would buy a half dozen copies if it ever came to DVD.",1181433600,24,997,4.905325443786983
5297474,5,B009AGEZ8S,"Years ago I taped this movie when it was shown own WGN  in Chicago.  It was very very good.  It was the original pilot for the star Trek series. It has some of the stars who went on to have roles, i.e. Majel Barrett and Walter Koenig in the Trek series.  I believe some of the stars even had guest appearanaces in the Trek series.  I don't know why it hasn't been put on DVD.  Maybe the Trekkies can campaign to ""make it so"".  It was written by Gene Roddenberry.  You can hear his ideas in the dialogue which was later included in the Trek series. I'm glad I still have my TV tape which I guard carefully.

The story line of an android with incomplete programming needing the help of a human is a unique point of view.  It's a shame this pilot did not take off.  They could have had a lot of fun with this.  It reminds me a bit of the introduction of R.

5297617,3,B009AGEZ8S,"A good pilot episode for a series that never was produced ""The Questor Tapes"" wasn't a complete loss--Gene Roddenberry recycled the idea for Data in ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". This could have been a terrific series and Mike Farrell makes a nice companion to Robert Foxworth's ' android. Forrester never got the career he deserved as an actor. The TV movie also does conclude the Mysrery at the heart of the show but opened up a world of possibility that was never explored. This would be a good candidate for a new series so I'm surprised that Roddenberry's son hasn't pursued this with Universal and NBC.

When the inventor (Lew Ayres) of the first andriod disappears, a colleague (Mike Ferrell) helps Questor (Robert Foxworth) attempt to find his creator to discover what data is missing and his purpose.

This on demand DVD presents the film warts and all in a decent transfer that hasn't been restored. There really aren't any special features for this. Given that this was a project done by Roddenberry it certainly could look and sound better with some special features.

The script written by Gene L. Coon (who died before the TV movie was aired) and Roddenberry is very good and is only let down by the conventional direction of pedestrian direction of Richard Colla.

Don't get me wrong--the acting is top notch for the TV movie and the writing also works quite well. Given when it was made, it's a surprise that NBC didn't want the series (it was all about ratings but they were fairly strong at the time--NBC has never had liked science fiction shows) as it was a smartly written film.",1445817600,,1603,4.714285714285714

5297655,4,B009AGEZ8S,"This pilot for a series that never came to pass remains a strong, solid science-fiction story from the mind of Gene Roddenberry. It's distinguished for being a story about ideas, not merely adventure --although there's certainly a fascinating mystery to be solved, as well as an exciting race against time. But as with ""Star Trek"" before it, what matters here is the human drama & the moral questions raised by the initial premise -- Just how human is an android? What constitutes life anyway? What is the potential of human civilization?

Robert Foxworth as Questor & Mike Farrell as Jerry Robinson are excellent in their roles, showing a real warmth & a very human bond. Of course Questor is essentially a rough draft for what eventually became Data on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" -- right down to a couple of identical lines of dialogue -- but I would love to have seen more of Questor, in a science-fiction series set in the then-present of the 1970s. While the special effects are simple compared to what can be done today, that's not necessarily a bad thing, as it forces the story to rely on an intelligent screenplay. The actual special effects of the time still look good, but what makes the film worth watching is the characterization & the concepts explored. Sadly, TV in the 1970s wasn't a good place for thoughtful science-fiction, or for thoughtful drama of any kind. The loss of the series that might have been is ours.

Still, the pilot film is a complete story in itself. You'll note some familiar Trek alumni among the supporting characters, and the always lovely & classy Dana Wynter adds to the appeal. Not only that, John Vernon makes a very good antagonist who turns out to be more complex than the average TV villain ... or is he really a villain? The story makes the viewer reconsider some TV clich&eacute;s & provides some good food for thought -- recommended!",1426204800,,1890,4.724242424242425

5297673,4,B009AGEZ8S,"This ""made on demand"" DVD played perfectly (some DVD-R's won't) in my 2005 Sony player so no concerns there.
The picture/color are very good with some ""specking"" on screen from time to time, not really a distraction. The sound level is way too low, you'll possibly have to turn your volume way up- much more than usual for a DVD. No closed captioning or subtitling.
I've read the reviews here and at imdb and tend to agree with the ones that call it good but would never have made it as a series. For a 40 year old TV movie the plot holds up pretty well and the ""look"" is generally very good (the London park looked like California & ""Mt. Ararat"" doesn't look right either) probably because, I suspect, very few sets were actually built- real buildings used instead. I don't remember how well I liked this movie 40 years ago (I did later buy the D C Fontana paperback novelization of it.) but do remember some bits & pieces on watching this DVD (unless you can see the casino table being lifted by Questor on YouTube that one reviewer here writes of I doubt it was ever broadcast).
Slow paced, TV budget- not big screen, better than pretty much anything SyFy puts out. Worth a look, maybe better than Roddenberry's Genesis II was- get a copy and try it out.",1416096000,,1257,4.422413793103448

5297675,5,B009AGEZ8S,"Just finished watching ""The Questor Tapes"" released by Universal.
""The Questor Tapes"" was an original pilot for a sadly unmade science fiction television series by the late Gene Roddenberry.
Actor Robert Foxworth gave a brilliant performance as Project Questor - an android who is seeking Dr. Vaslovik - his creator - as the clock has begun ticking down since his activation.  If Questor doesn't find Dr. Vaslovik in three days, then the portable nuclear fusion generator in his stomach will explode.
Looking back at this movie, one sees shades of Commander Data of Star Trek - The Next Generation.  Questor had an incomplete activiation, and therefore lacks emotion and human graces; but he is capable of functioning as a full sexual human male - just like Data would be.
Robert Foxworth gives an Emmy worthy performance as Questor.  Foxworth vividly potrays someone who is trying to learn how to be human.
What Questor was made for and his who Dr. Vaslovik is is ultimately revealed and the setup for the never-to-be television series is hinted at - and it would have made a great series.
I believe ""The Questor Tapes"" could be rebooted as a highly successful audio mini-series.
Highly Recommended!

New Questor series in the works?, April 23, 2010

It would appear that Roddenberry Productions has entered into a deal with Ron Howard's Imagine Television to develop ""The Questor Tapes"" into a new TV series, according to TrekMovie.com (Jan 2010).

Should this pan out, we might expect a respectable quality DVD of the original 1970's pilot TV program to be released at some time leading up to the new production. If not, we can only hope to be able to eventually get it as studio DVD-R like the rest of the mid-1970's Roddenberry titles.

It almost looks like it was sourced from a (slightly) scratchy film copy, then copied onto videotape, then captured on a computer and made into an interlaced DVD.

5297691,5,B009AGEZ8S,"BOTTOM LINE: An entertaining pilot TV film that would have made a very cool sci-fi series. Who knows, perhaps THE QUESTOR TAPES was just too far ahead of its time? Happily, Gene Roddenberry was able to re-tool his ""Questor"" android character as ""Lt. Commander Data"" on Star Trek: The Next Generation. TV audiences must have been ready for the concept of an android as a leading character by that time, since Data was perhaps the most popular member on that show. 5 STARS

THE STORY (contains spoilers): Gene Roddenberry & Gene Coon, creative team behind the original Star Trek series, teamed up again for this 90min pilot movie for a proposed series about an advanced android & his human friend. Calling himself Questor, the machine man is forced to seek out his mysterious creator when a sizable portion of his initial programming files are accidentally destroyed by a handful of greedy scientists eager to decode the cutting edge data before uploading it into Questor's memory banks. Without a complete set of instructions and full knowledge of who and what he is, Questor is forced to put his trust in the only scientist who didn't attempt to decode the data. Together, these two must solve the mystery of Questor's creator and locate this person before the nuclear power source in the android's chest detonates. (The power source doubling as part of its self defense programming, in order to prevent it from accidentally falling into the wrong hands and being turned into a weapon.)

THOUGHTS: Robert Foxworth (Falcon Crest) and Mike Farrell (M*A*S*H) have terrific chemistry together and play off of each other very well. The make-up effects for the android are pretty cool for a 1972 TV movie budget. The entire sequence of Questor prepping himself to leave the laboratory complex for his initial journey to uncover his creator's whereabouts is fascinating. The script, in typical Roddenberry fashion, is fun, well-written sci-fi that incorporates much of the same qualities that Star Trek TOS always had: a profound belief in the basic goodness of mankind and in his ability to overcome his baser self and triumph over adversity in a continuing quest to better himself and the world around him. Sure, this might seem rather heavy-handed & preachy in today's cynical, overly suspicious world, but it's these keystone beliefs that have guided Trek ideology for almost 5 decades and helped it endure thru all of its various incarnations. I only saw this movie one time, (on a late-night movie viewing I think), many, many years ago as a young boy. It must have made quite an impression, as many parts of it stuck with me over the years - though I must confess I'd forgotten as much as I remembered. The movie is certainly good enough to warrant repeat viewings

THE DVD: An M.O.D. (Manufactured-On-Demand) release from Universal Studio's Vault Series, much in the same vein as on-demand product from Warner Bros. Archives, Sony Pictures Choice Collection and MGM Limited Edition. As a DVD-r, that means the disc has ZERO extra features; just the film itself. I don't think it even has closed captioning. Still, it is a pretty rare movie and I was just thrilled to see it get any kind of release at all. The picture & sound quality are impressive for a made-for-TV movie that hasn't seen the light of day in years.",1391990400,7,3317,4.877659574468085

5297704,4,B009AGEZ8S,"Roddenberry produced several pilots between the initial run of the original Star Trek series and Next Generation. This is one that we enjoyed watching when it first aired and were not happy that it did not get made into a series. By today's standards, it is dated in terms of technology and FX, but it is still worth adding to one's collection, along with the original series. The four star rating is largely because it is what I consider a valuable addition to my collection, but the overall quality is more along the lines of three stars.

A word about the production values of this disc -- it is a ""vault"" disc, not intended for high sales, and as such, similar to those produced by Warner and Disney, done on an as ordered basis. Generally speaking, the quality is fine and the discs will play on most players, but there are some instances where a player will not play a written disc (rather than a commercially-produced pressed disc).

Love to see in TV serial BUT more updated for Today audience.

Have Questor part of some organz or working alone with buddy

Take TV show to 2040?? or 2080 to see changes in Questor from 70s birth.

Use CG & other FX, be awesome.

5297729,4,B009AGEZ8S,"This film is about an android named Questor, created for the purpose of secretly helping humanity fulfill its potential so we can seek our destiny beyond the confines of Earth. It's one of Mr. Roddenberry's numerous attempts to create a non-human SF character who can observe and comment on Homo Sapiens' strengths and weaknesses from the perspective of an outsider - much like Mr. Spock did on the original ""Star Trek"" series; and Lt. Commander Data did on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation."" In fact, one could argue that Questor was a sort of ""ancestor"" of Data, as he shares many of Data's personality traits and physical characteristics.
The movie itself is a direct-to-DVD print from the cleanest film print available; even so, a couple of scenes show some slight damage to the film stock. But that damage is minimal, and hardly distracted me from watching the movie (it lasted only five seconds, at most). The soundtrack was also clear and crisp, although some of the dialogue seemed a bit muted. Also, there is no main menu on this disc - the film itself begins the moment you put the disc in and hit ""Play."" And when it ends, the movie automatically starts right up again at the beginning.
Aside from those minor quibbles, I really enjoyed seeing this movie again after all these years. This DVD makes an excellent companion to my paperback copy of Dorothy Fontana's novelization of ""The Questor Tapes"", which I was lucky enough to have purchased back in the early 1980's when it was first published.",1370822400,2,1507,4.777777777777778
