8379273,5,B002SBFDNI,Are they ever going to put this out in a USA friendly format?,1411776000,,61,3.769230769230769
8379274,4,B002SBFDNI,"The editorial review for this product is pretty spot on. To put in concisely, this DVD from the Top Gear team (Clarkson is absent) is based on ideas of how motoring will work after a nuclear holocaust. Except that being Top Gear most of it is just cocking about in general.

Some of the more interesting bits involve a sort of car version of robot wars where armed vehicles try to smash each other up, a bid drive segment where we get a look at just how hard it would be to drive in zero visibility via GPS only and there is some fun to be had watching the guys try and choose what cars they would use the last barrel of petrol in the world on.

A good gift idea. Just be careful what region code you buy. Or, you know, buy a DVD player that is multi-zone. And then be able to buy discs from anywhere in the world.",1398384000,,814,4.049689440993789
8379275,1,B002SBFDNI,"Well, I am a huge Top Gear fan and am quite sure that this would have been incredible, as are all of their videos.  Unfortunately, I have a Sony BDP-S380 and, while it says it plays NTSC and PAL, the copyright warning comes up and then the player goes back to its menu (not the DVD menu).  So, while I'm sure this would have been great, it just won't play on my player.  Bummer.",1325203200,2,378,4.081081081081081
8379276,4,B002SBFDNI,A little bit out of the ordinary for Top Gear fans. Funny premise and entertaining...the blind drive was the best part of this DVD.,1311724800,,131,4.5
8379277,5,B002SBFDNI,"OK, seriously, if you like this program, how can you go wrong!  I've already watched it several times  :)  Arrived quickly and in perfect order.  Even coming in from overseas, it got here way faster than I thought it would.",1309824000,,223,4.5
8379278,3,B002SBFDNI,"I love TopGear and this was watchable, but driving around by GPS with painted windows was a bit boring and although the death match was interesting it was predictable. If you want truly classic TopGear go with the Challenges 1-4. Your money will be better spent.",1307836800,,262,4.717391304347826
8379279,1,B002SBFDNI,This disc will not play on your Blu-ray player or PS3 if you live in the US.  You will not find an update for your player and you probably won't find a player that it will work on unless you live in England and find the random player this format will play on.  And I really love Top Gear...,1302134400,9,290,3.8983050847457625
8379280,5,B002SBFDNI,I live in the UK and this Bluray (which is really good) costs 10 ($14.30). This is outrageous! Worth $15 but maybe not $50! Buy off ebay instead!,1299542400,7,145,4.214285714285714
8379281,1,B002SBFDNI,"Watch out! (1) TopGear: The Great Adventures 3, (2) TopGear: Apocalypse and (3) Clarkson: The Italian Job Blu-rays DO NOT PLAY on my new state of the art Samsung players. Both of my NEW Samsung Blu-ray players are up to date but they complain about changing the resolution of my NEW Samsung TV. It is interesting to note that TopGear 14 and TopGear 15 play stunningly!!! I will be sending them back for exchange or refund. I would prefer an exchange as I ""love"" TopGear UK"".",1298246400,5,474,4.523255813953488
