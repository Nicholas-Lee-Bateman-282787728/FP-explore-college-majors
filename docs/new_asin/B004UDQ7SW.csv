8441439,4,B004UDQ7SW,"It should have been paradise. A doting husband (Sanjeev Kumar) is happily married to a loving wife (Vidya Sinha) and they have one little son who is the naughty little apple of their eye. Except that when the husband is at work, paradise becomes hell as he conveniently becomes an unhappy husband trapped in a loveless marriage to an invalid wife to whom he is duty bound. This is a sob story that he convincingly spins to make his sweet, pretty, innocent, young secretary (Ranjeeta) fall in love with him. And so his life actually becomes paradise twice over - happily married at home and blissfully in love in the office... How far is the ""Pati"" able to juggle this blissful triangle? Does the happy ""Patni"" ever find out and what happens to pretty little ""Woh""?

Pati Patni Aur Woh is B.R. Chopra's only comedy, coming at the tail end of directorial career in 1978. Sanjeev Kumar and Vidya Sinha were so captivated by the plot that they worked on a continuous thirty day schedule in which the film was completed. Not only did it become one of thespian Sanjeev Kumar's most unforgettably comic performances, it won Kamleshwar the Filmfare award for Best Screenplay and has the entertaining song ""Thande Thande Pani"" which became one of Ravindra Jain's biggest hits.",1304467200,,1267,4.759090909090909
