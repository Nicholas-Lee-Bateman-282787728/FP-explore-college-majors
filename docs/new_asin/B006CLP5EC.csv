8496483,4,B006CLP5EC,"All segments but one are filmed in colorful and crisp, widescreen Hi Definition.  The final segment, Scotland's Islands and Highlands, is not filmed in Hi Def and not widescreen.  Still, it's worth the price and worth the adventure.  Most segments appear to be from the 2004 or 2006 travel seasons, so they are somewhat dated.

I have found that most of the episodes on Blu-ray collections appear on other DVD collections, usually organized by inclusive years as opposed to the Blu-ray collections that are organized by themes or regions or countries.",1341619200,,551,5.021978021978022
