118789,5,079075181X,"I loved it and so did my grandkids. Its silly and very entertaining for all ages.
A boy, his dog, grandma and grandpa, a sister, mom, dad, a greedy cousin and her lawyer, and of course Santa and his reindeer and elves-covers all the necessary characters for an enjoyable and interesting hour of fun.
It isn't exactly like the song, but most movies aren't exactly like the books either.",1197331200,4,385,4.594202898550725
118790,5,079075181X,"The only way for most adults to rate a movie like this is by how much their kids like it.  My 5 year old daughter just loves it and it seems cute and harmless to me, so I gave it 5 stars.  She watches it all the time, not just at Christmas.  Of course, she also forces me to keep a CD of Christmas carols in my truck so that we can be driving around in June singing Jingle Bells, but that's another story.",1142467200,11,405,3.7976190476190474

Some things were added in for the story line but I think that if you have kids, they will love this movie.  At least ours does.",1105142400,6,300,3.95

118794,1,079075181X,"When I was 15, I had seen this movie during Sunday School around Xmas time. Midway during the movie, everyone was falling asleep. I never want to see this movie again as long as I live. The song itself was good, but the movie was stupid",1081296000,3,236,4.1521739130434785
118795,1,079075181X,"Grandma got run over by a reindeer is this animated story of a song that was recorded in 1982, and yet this animated story has a couple of things diffrent from the song. (1) Grandma owns a store. (2) She is walking to a store when she gets run over by a reindeer. (3) There is a famiy member that hates Grandma and wants her store sold. (4) In this cartoon story the police are called and Grandma's body is not found and the scene that said she was found in the song. (5) A boy witness that all happening, and the song so doesn't sound like to me that Grandma was witnessed getting run over by a reindeer. (6) Grandma is missing and still is in September of the following year. There should be more things here that are diffrent in the song but I won't spoil it for you, if you do decide to watch this garbage. Grandma Spankenneimer (Susan Blu) owns this store. She reads stories to kids while thier parents shop. But then this young rich man that comes in and gets dressed as a troll to see Grandma to try to buy the place and her grandson Jake (Alex Doduk) tells her not to sell the store and she doesn't which angers Jake's cousin Mel (Michelle Lee). So she puts some bad stuffi  grandma' food and when she walks to a store she gets run over by a reindeer.",1039737600,4,1259,4.159836065573771
118796,3,079075181X,I always loved the song and this is why I bought the video. This is a cute movie and it's fun to watch.  The movie goes further than the song and tells a lot more about Grandma and her relatives. It'll cheer you up and you'll probably want to watch it every Christmas. The song always makes me feel good and it was great to hear it again.,1013040000,2,338,3.9705882352941178

118818,4,079075181X,"The annual Christmas song, ""Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer,"" has been a long favorite for the last forty years. Randy Brooks was composer and lyricist. Elmo Shopshire (also known as Dr. Elmo) sang the song. The 60 minutes special is faithful to the story of a beloved Grandmother getting hit by a reindeer on Christmas Eve. Grandmother Spankenheimer runs a beloved general store in Cityville where a ruthless businessman, Austin Bucks wants to buy the business and own Cityville.

Of course, Grandma's disappearance doesn't go unnoticed by her family. Cousin Mel sees her disappearance as an opportunity to sell the business and get millions of dollars. The song is a basis for the story and the rest of it goes along well. There are other additional music with songs ""Grandma's Gonna Sue The Pants Off Santa"" among others. Of course, grandson Jake Spankenheimer seeks to find his grandmother and bring her home.

The DVD features the songwriter's biography, costume gallery, song selections and Grandma's Guessing Game. Of course, I wished they added the original video of the song as a special feature.",1484524800,,1108,5.016304347826087

I really can't find any redeeming quality to this movie.  I grew up loving the song and the other reviews said it was cute with a nice moral and the price was right, so I went for it.  Big mistake.  You'd have to look hard for the moral, and the quality was like a poorly done Scooby-doo show.  I really wanted to like it... I tried.  It didn't happen.

118908,1,079075181X,"On the 11th day of Christmas 2014 I'm going to review...Grandma Got Over By a Reindeer. The plot is weak as a failed WCW gimmick. The setting is confusing as The San Francisco 49er Match. The characters are boring as watching paint dry. The humor is poor and sometimes dirty like Capitol Critters. Not only,the segues to all the songs are awful as heck but the songs themselves are bad too and NOT sung by Elmo Shropshire himself,the man sang them in the first place. The animation is solid. The voice acting is mediocre at best. The final act uses too many court terms for a kids film. Overall,while not the worst christmas film,it's still bad in it's own right. I give this film a 1 out of 10.",1419379200,,695,4.395348837209302

118915,5,079075181X,Loved this movie since I was a kid. Yes it is loosely based on the song but it's a children's cartoon and it needs to have a story to it. No movie ever made follows exactly a song or a book that it's based on. This has been  a favorite of my family  for years and it will continue to be.,1417219200,,287,3.6885245901639343
118916,2,079075181X,"This Christmas story probably started with the best of intentions. There are some  nice components in place: a touching relationship between the young boy Jake, who is the main character, and his grandmother; a plausible set up; and some potentially interesting family dynamics. Sadly, the story soon devolves into a variety of cliches (greedy cousin, two dimensional monomaniacal CEO, evil lawyer, etc.) and tired stereotypes (addled grandpa, obligatory valley girl sister, etc.) that undermine what could have been a fun show. One unique aspect was the rare experience of watching animated characters ""phoning in"" their performance. It is doubtful that a predictable Christmas story bothers most people, but a show that is too lazy to come up with semi-interesting ending is asking a lot.

In some ways, it may have worked better to create something shorter and more exciting rather than add all the padding that diverted the story's momentum (Grandpa doing an Elvis impersonation comes to mind). If you are looking for some Christmas cheer, you may  have better luck watching the classics (e.g. Miracle on 34th Street) than the disjointed, derivative aspects of them this show attempted to cobble together.",1417132800,,1209,5.286458333333333
