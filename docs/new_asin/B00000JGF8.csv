1231923,5,B00000JGF8,"Since there is no description of this product, I worried what I was purchasing.  I was happy to find that it is indeed the ""as seen on TV"" Facial Magic, with the great facial exercises, gloves and cream.  It works too! Exercises work the facial muscles to prevent sagging.",944006400,2,272,4.530612244897959
1231944,4,B00000JGF8,The only reason I gave it a four star is that there is a lot of talking at the beginning of the tape. Really great program though!!,1369267200,2,131,3.888888888888889
1231945,3,B00000JGF8,"I don't see any firming in neck, nose to laugh lines(think the are worrse) Eyes maybe better. I try to do them correctly.",1368576000,,121,4.304347826086956
1231946,1,B00000JGF8,the video look used and it  didn't look good and i return it i want my money back i don't like the way they send it to me,1367798400,,121,3.3214285714285716
1231947,5,B00000JGF8,"I started using Facial Magic years ago and it was so helpful but you've got to keep it up (this is NOT critical! - it's just common sense.)  So I see that when I get lazy my face gets tired and wrinkles start creeping back but as soon as I start ""exercising"" my face muscles again I'm amazed the way the wrinkles - especially around my mouth just start fading away again!",1312329600,5,371,4.152777777777778
1231948,5,B00000JGF8,"I originally bought this video years ago.  I just wore it out.  I have been using the program for almost a decade and the results are wonderful.  You look younger without having plastic surgery or BOTOX or any of those other Fountation of Youth scams.  Good luck.

1231949,5,B00000JGF8,"I have been doing the exercises recommended in this booklet for 9 months and I have to say that they are amazing.  The changes in your facial muscle tone is almost immediate.  I get compliments every day - I am 47 years old and my face is looks so much more youthful and healthy.  Yes, the exercises take time - but what does not take time?  It's worth every minute spent in front of the mirror (approx 30 minutes/day).  If you are truly interested in becoming the best you can be, I recommend getting a copy of this DVD ASAP!",1257897600,8,526,4.22
1231950,1,B00000JGF8,"Cynthia Rowland is a great salesperson.
Although I did a lot of research, I bought this tape because I saw very motivational presentation on YouTube. After watching the tape I got the true picture.
First of all, ten year ago, when it was taped, Cynthia looked different (very different), she spoke different, her personality was very strict.
What is most important is that exercises are just barbaric!
You put fingers in your mouth, and press, stretch, push, squeeze.
Models even couldn't put their hands symmetrical.
And according to these models, these exercises didn't do any good for them since their faces covered with wrinkles (the new DVD use younger models).
I am very glad that I bought THIS tape. It shows me how I can damage my face.",1197676800,7,744,4.8203125
1231951,1,B00000JGF8,"I have watched the Facial Magic video numerous  times since purchasing it and the routine shown  is very complicated and requires way too much time to do.  You need white gloves, a mirror and at least a half hour of undisturbed time to do the exercises, not to mention many tricky finger placements to  ""trigger"" the muscles. Even the narrator on the video refers to them as 'tricky'.  I honestly can't see myself  doing these exercises consistently over any period of time.
  I think that if you are going to try and do facial  exercises, they have to be fairly simple and you shouldn't need ""props"" to perform them.  I was disappointed in this  video and will ask for my money back.",991008000,11,684,4.524590163934426
1231952,5,B00000JGF8,"I had seen this video on TV about 2 years ago, and bought one for myself at twice the price.  Friends have commented about the youthful changes to my face, and wanted to know where they could get the video.  I went looking  on your web site and was thrilled to be able to find it.  I have gotten 2  more for friends, and have provided the website information to a dozen  more.  It is really that effective.",963100800,23,406,4.128205128205129
1231953,5,B00000JGF8,"Wow, what a tape and it does work.  If you are concerned about facial lines and wrinkles and you want a easy way to make them better or reduced the appearence, this is the tape.  Easy to do exercises for your face.  I  love it.  I would recommend to everyone.  Enjoy and see the diffences in  just 30 days.",946425600,28,306,4.084745762711864
7911970,5,B00000JGF8,Great video ; had it years ago but lent it out!  All below dvd are my all time favs!!!,1464048000,,86,3.526315789473684
7911971,5,B00000JGF8,"I started using these facial exercises a few years ago.
They work, they do definitely work.
I do the exercises each day ( it only takes a few minutes) for 6 days a week.
My skin is clear and the youthful contours of my face are a credit to facial magic.",1450483200,2,253,3.980392156862745
7911972,5,B00000JGF8,"I have been using these exercises for 15 years.  I have been told I am the most beautiful 80 year old there is. I look in my 60's and can only recommend this highly intelligent, brilliant video.",1440115200,2,194,4.243243243243243
7911973,2,B00000JGF8,The tape is so old it does not even play on my VHS player.  I did not bother return it,1433721600,,86,3.3

7911975,4,B00000JGF8,"I've been using this tape since I was in my mid 30's, I just turned 48 and it really is amazing! I came here to get the DVD, as my tape has worn thin and I was so disappointed to see you can only get the DVD with a ""pack"" for over 100.00 at the cheapest. That's a shame, I really would've preferred it on disk but I guess I'm going to replace the VHS with another, very outdated VHS. Sigh.",1412553600,,389,3.814814814814815
7911976,5,B00000JGF8,Love the detailed instructions ... very pleased with this product,1404000000,2,65,5.6
7911977,3,B00000JGF8,"It was a very amateurish video.  The women demonstrating the exercises all have wrinkles in the under the eye region, crows feet, frown lines and forehead.  So I don't do those exercises except for the under-the-eyebrow exercise which I already knew about from another program.
But the exercises are demonstrated lobsided.  Also, you can't see any muscle contraction at all.
The women do have nice necks, and since I was mainly interested in improving the looseness under my chin, I give the program 3 stars.
I do them lying down or sitting.
Cynthia Rowlands is much slimmer that in the youtube vids where she appears.  She also has a completely different voice.  Very strange.
I had bought it through the seller Sandclipper Books & Video which not only send the videocassette (which looked brand new), but also a DVD copy.  The order was delivered in 3 days time, to Canada.  I would definitely recommend that seller.",1384819200,,918,4.846153846153846
7911978,5,B00000JGF8,"This product requires work on your part but it is magic.  I am 57 and felt like my cheeks were drooping, jowls developing and was unhappy with my looks.  I was not ready for an expensive surgical procedure so I did some research and these exercises were highly recommended by all who rated them. I bought this product and started the exercises right away.  I was amazed that within 3 days that my jowls were receding and I felt much better about myself.  I have been doing the exercises now for 5 weeks and am thrilled.  My eyebrows are lifted, cheekbones higher and jowls 85% improved.  It takes about 15- 20 minutes daily to do the exercises but it is totally worth it.  In my research I also found that the Skinceuticals CE Ferulic Travel Size Serum and Infrared LED Light Therapy Skin Care Device were highly recommended so I have been using both those products in conjunction with these exercises and they all work great together.",1375056000,7,935,4.562874251497006
7911979,5,B00000JGF8,"This VHS has the same info as the MUCH more expensive DVD. I happened to accidentally destroy my DVD while moving. I didn't use it much (a Christmas gift) and so I was very disappointed. After sticker shock about the DVD cost, I found this VHS for much less. The exercises are the same. Get some cotton gloves to help with some of the moves and you'll have a much easier time of it. I have been doing facial exercise for 4 yr. and have gotten very good results so far. I have switched over to Cynthia Rowland's routine & like it very much, she focuses much more on muscle resistance and it works! Added to facial exercise, I use a microcurrent machine every other day, and do facial peels on a regular basis. My friends remarks claim I look 7-14 yr. younger than my actual age. I CAN say this routine has certainly slowed down the clock by what I see in the mirror. If you have the discipline to do it every day you'll get results.",1370217600,9,931,4.235955056179775
