2344194,1,B0009ZE9W6,"This trilogy started off bad and just got worse. It is full of moronic humor and the character of Stiffler is the dumbest, most obnoxious and moronic character ever written and performed to that level by a very poor actor. But I guess every generation needs it Porky's so, have at it. Its got a few good laughs all of them sophomoric. The first one is the best of the three and worth watching. The second was kind of funny but no where near the first and the third one... why bother... really. You have seen it all in the first one.",1138665600,,532,4.2254901960784315
2344195,5,B0009ZE9W6,"I got these two days ago and these movies are great. The unrated part adds to the greatness of the movie. These are the greatest movies ever.

2344196,5,B0009ZE9W6,"I too bought the boxed set from WallyWorld (aka WalMart). The cover appears the same as the rated set but one side (the sleeve) is marked as ""UNRATED"". Odd as well is the number on the sides ( Catalog # ?). They are different numbers. The set was only $20 bucks, but still... Since its been opened, I don't want to have to try convince the ""Brain Trust"" at my local Walmart that ""No .. I didn't buy two sets, mix them up just to rip off the store .. DUH .. ""

I love the movies and I'll keep the sets. I really wanted the unrated versions but for the price I'll keep them. Maybe a letter to the distributor of the sets would produce better results. I thought maybe it was just ""My Luck"" to pick up the only set in the world that was misloaded... Guess my luck has changed ..

Anyway .. 5 stars for the movie(s).. I remember 17 like it was .. ohhhhhhhh .. 27 years ago .. HEH HEH ..",1130284800,8,881,3.9717514124293785
2344197,5,B0009ZE9W6,"The ""American Pie"" trilogy is one of the freshest, funniest and most consistent comedy series in film history. I can't find one major flaw in any of the films. Oh sure, maybe there are a few quirks here nd there, but each film is absolutely hilarious and only seem to get better with age.

Here's my review for each film.

""American Pie (1999, Unrated) - The first film in the series introduces to the series' colorful assortment of characters: nervous, scatterbrained virgin Jim (Jason Biggs), levelheaded, suave Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), who is only one step ahead of Jim thanks to the fact he already has a girlfriend (Tara Reid), sexual mastermind Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), and one of the most dastardly comic creations ever, the unforgettable Steve Stiffler (Sean William Scott). The film chornicles their sexual mishaps (key words: pale ale, pie and flutes) and ultimate triumph over virginity. Plus, there's hot girls thrown in the mix: nerdy but lovable band geek Michelle (Alsyon Hannigan), levelheaded choir girl Heather (Mena Suvari), curious, nervous Vicki (the aforementioned Tara Reid), all knowing sex guru Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) and of course, Czechoslovokian babe Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth). The bevy of hot babes assembled for this movies is only rivaled by the classic beauties of the ""Grumpy Old Men"" movies. Eugene Levy is a real scene stealer as Jim's overly supportive dad, and Jennifer Coolidge is a hoot as Stiffler's mom, a.k.a. the MILF.

The film is very well written, and several of the scenes have since become classics. 5/5

""American Pie 2"" (2001, Unrated) - The second, and arguably best, film of the series, has all the cast members from the first film returning. In this one, the boys rent a summer home in which they will hold an end of the sumer party in which they hope toscore as many chicks as possible. Natuarally, lots of things go wrong, and old feelings start to arise, causing the boys to rethink their plans.

The film is as good as the first one, and actually improves upon it in some ways. While none of the scenes are as hilarious as, say, the pie scene, the humor in this one is more wittier and a lot of the one liners are better. The super-glue scene rightfully takes it place as one of the funniest things I have ever seen in my life, and the whole film is another laugh riot. 5/5

""American Wedding"" (2003, Unrated). Often considered the worst of the series. By this point, the formula was beginning to wear thin, plus the half the cast either didn't return or wasn't asked back. Still, these do nothing to diminish this second sequel, which fins Jim and Michele preparing to tie the knot. New characters are introduced, and the same old schtick is still just as funny the third time around. 5/5

Overall, this is a boxed set I definitely recommend purchasing. Here's hoping that somewhere down the line, a fourth ""American Pie"" will someday see the light of day.",1129334400,60,2945,4.774066797642436
2344198,4,B0009ZE9W6,"Now don't think that just because the title of my review is ""Misleading"" it has nothing to do with the movies themselves because they are awesome!!!  IT DOES HOWEVER, have to do with what the box says.  I recently bought this 3 pack at Wal-Mart and on the side of the box it said unrated.  I bought it at it's cheap price and got home to open it to discover that it was all of the rated versions.  I was somewhat upset, but kept it anyways because the movies rock.  The second one is awesome!  If you are buying this movie looking for UNRATED material STEER CLEAR OF THIS BOXED SET!",1128384000,11,582,4.198198198198198
2344199,4,B0009ZE9W6,"This is a bargain for 3 pretty good movies. The first two are quite equal in laughs, but the third just blew me away! This is most certainly geared toward the 16-35 or so age range. I don't know too many people in their 40's and over that really enjoyed these movies. They are full of raunch and NOT for young ears.",1126569600,8,315,4.096774193548387

2344236,3,B0009ZE9W6,"You get the American Pie trilogy in this 6-disc UK collection. Overall, the picture and audio quality are average. The unrated cuts of the films are provided (not the theatrical versions). While there is over 3 hours of total bonus content that fit on 3 extra discs they are not as meaty as the list would have you believe and the 213 minute American Pie Revealed from the American Pie US Blu-ray release is not included. However, there is an astounding 7 audio commentary tracks provided. US customers should know that the UK digital copy codes don't work in the US. I rate the films 4 stars but this release gets only 3 stars because it works as a value pack since it could have been more deluxe.

2344237,2,B0009ZE9W6,One of my children bought this. Suffice it to say that I am not a fan of this genre at all.,1388707200,,91,3.380952380952381
2344238,4,B0009ZE9W6,"This is the one of the movie series that grew with me, so I could be biased in my review here. What makes this movie so great is the fact that many of us could relate to it. It reminds me of high school time when all we guys talk about was pretty girls and getting laid. Even after all of us have grown up and starting to turn to 30s, the sentimental value from this movie simply appreciates as time goes by. One thing I have to admit, I thought the first one was the best and second still very good movie, and the rest just goes downhill from there.

Lastly, for those who love the movie as much I do, it is definitely worthwhile to watch 'American Pie Reunion'. Though not as good and memorable as the first one, it is reminiscent of the old good time and how everyone turns out after 12+ years!",1387756800,,797,4.076433121019108
2344239,5,B0009ZE9W6,"Ironically I wasn't a fan of the American Pie films back when I was a teenager. It wasn't untilI hit thirty that  watched them and started to really get into them. This pack contains the three best films in the franchise, although I have heard that the recently released American Reunion is pretty good.
  AmericanPie is where it all started. Responding to a rumor about a nerdy classmate, a group of guys resolve to lose their virginity by the time they graduate High School. Each guy has his chosen girl. Kevin seeks to win the college-bound Vicky. Oz joins the choir and becomes attracted to the beautiful eather. Jim seeks to get the beautiful exchange student Nadya into bed. Then there's the intelectual Finch. Of course nothing goes smoothly thanks in part to the antics of the jerky Steve Stifler. Will the guys mannage to score before it's too late?
  American Pie 2 picks up after the gang's first year of college. Most have moved on. Oz is sill with Heather, but Kevin and Vicky broke up after making love at the after-prom party. Jim is still interested in Nadya, though the notoriety brought on by the internet video in the prior film has given him an unfortunate reputation. After a part at Stifler's gets shut down, the gang decides to go to the beach for the summer, culminating in one big party. While they get jobs painting houses in order to afford their temporary digs, Jim seeks sex advice from his high School prom date, the geeky but sexually aggressive Michelle, before he reunites with Nadya at the big party at the end of the summer. But experimenting with Michelle could have unexpected side effects, always assuming that Jim can recover from an unfortunate mishap involving a tube of superglue. Matters are also complicated by the fact that in order to make financial ends meet,the gang was forced to invite the mean-spirited Stifler, with whose mom Finch had an amazing encounter at the end of the prior film.
  AmericanReunion picks up four years after the end of the second film as Jim Levenstein is about to propose to his longtime girlfriend, former band geek Michelle Flaherty. She accepts, prompting a whirlwind of preparational activity. Of course things go far from smoothly what with the unwanted appearance of Stifler, whose antics could pose a serious threat to the sanity of all involved. All i all these three movies are well worth watching. I bought this pack three years ago and watch them a few times a year.",1386288000,,2453,4.730679156908665

2344247,1,B0009ZE9W6,"After hearing so much about this movie franchise I bought this 3-disc set when it was offered at a good, used condition price. What a waste of time. What can you say about a purported comedy with no laughs? Honest, I did not laugh...NOT EVEN ONCE!! That's the worst crime a so-called comedy can commit. I can only assume the other reviewers commenting on how funny these are must be adolescents. Bad writing, bad acting, bad editing, bad direction...I could go on. With the exception of the somewhat charming and goofy Jason Biggs, the cast ranges from obnoxious to intolerable to downright hateful. Maybe the most annoying aspect is when one of these cretins is supposed to be having some sort of epiphany (cue the strings and tinkly music). They've been so unlovable, I don't give a crap! I want to lay these 3 discs out on my lawn and run them over with a lawnmower. To all 3 I say EEEWWW!!! Minus 5 stars on all counts.",1372550400,,923,4.5

I was a little disappointed to see that they were the UK versions. This was not clear, or in anyway implied from the page. I don't know if the 50Hz frame rate will be a problem or not. However I don't think it will be an issue, because they run fine on the blu-ray player on my computer. I would assume they would also run on most American blu-ray players.

Anyone who hasn't seen any of the American pie movies should definitely do so, and consider buying the movies, however it might be wise to double check that this particular set will work with your player!",1359676800,,740,4.355072463768116

2344266,3,B0009ZE9W6,"Before you give my review an ""Unhelpful"" vote, keep in mind that this is a review of this Blu Ray disc's functionality, not the movie.
This is the imported version as pictured on the product description page.
Sendit.com had it for 12 pounds sterling with free shipping, which translated to $19 and change with the current exchange rate.

If we have bought this movie set on blu-ray, it's probably because we're already familiar with the movies, and their comedic and sexy appeal.

The picture quality is great, hovering around 30 mb/sec. average; sound quality is very good, with very scarce surround sound effects however (probably due to the time period in which is was filmed).

The main detractor is the blu-ray functionality its self.
I left it paused for a couple minutes, and came back to find the studio logo bouncing around my screen like a screen saver.
Pressing play gave me the ""illegal operation"" symbol, as did fast forward, rewind, and chapter forward and back buttons, as well as the main menu button.
I had to sit and watch the Universal Studios logo do its thing for a couple minutes, followed by two or three minutes of FBI warnings, and a minute or so of total blackness before it gave me the top menu again, and I had to fast forward back to the point where I had left off.
Also, any time you press pause, it gives you a pop-up window on the screen that I don't want and can't get rid of.

Blu-Ray movies are great for picture and audio, but I hate, hate, HATE the way some of them totally take over my disc player like a virus and control the way I try to watch a movie.",1350777600,2,1592,4.441780821917808

2344268,3,B0009ZE9W6,"I enjoyed seeing the movies in Blu-Ray.

The first 2 movies were great.

The 3rd movie (American Wedding) was the theatrical release.  Horrible.  Previously I had only seen the extended version of the third movie.  This version is bad.  While some may like the lack of some of the more ""questionable"" scenes, the theatrical version ruins this movie.  Much of this version seemed to be cut and pasted.  This version of the movie doesn't seem to flow very well at all and left much of my normal laughter out.

After watching this I disposed of the ""3rd"" movie and just put my extended DVD version in the slot as I couldn't bare to watch the regular version.

If this set included the extended release of the 3rd movie I would have easily given it 5 stars.

Choose for yourself, but be aware.  People used to the extended version of the 3rd movie will be disappointed.",1343001600,,865,4.509677419354839

Anyways i seen the three disc box set on Amazon for dirt cheap used and decided to re-live these movies. My first opinion is these movies are still funny years down the road now, my second opinion is they are better watched back to back v.s. waiting and watching all these movies seperately. I watched all three on my Friday evening back to back and had a hoot.  Im not going to go into a detailed breakdown of these movies, chances are youv already watched them. Im just here to tell you they still hit the funny bone and i think its better to watch them all three together for impact.",1329091200,,786,4.3108108108108105
2344271,1,B0009ZE9W6,"hello:
 in the publication of the article states that the three films came with subtitles in Spanish, however, American Pie 2 only has subtitles in English and French, NOT SPANISH SUBTITLES. AS solution, if Sent back is more expensive than the commercial value it has.

Avoid",1474070400,,384,4.232876712328767
