I am giving it three stars because there are no chapters and barre exercises are only done on one side.  If the DVD were priced less or if it had chapters, then my review would be higher.  But 40 dollars is too much to pay for class directly copied from a VHS.",1294272000,2,432,3.942528735632184
7793231,3,0871272911,I only have seen the VHS version of this DVD.  The problem with this tape is that she only demonstrates the barre exercises on one side so I had to rewind to do the other.  The combinations are beautiful but the instruction is to fast and inadequate.,1167091200,,250,4.297872340425532
