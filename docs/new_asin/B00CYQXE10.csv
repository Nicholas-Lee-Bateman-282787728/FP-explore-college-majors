5757181,3,B00CYQXE10,"Was disappointed with this season's first episode. Sorry to see Danny's new partner is a permanent fixture -- I much preferred Jackie. She was a natural and had a worldly way.  This partner is too young and wooden. Very disappointed in the younger Reagan's even younger partner. Ugh. Another young girl with a squeaky voice and no grit. Jackie had grit. That's the kind of actors/actresses needed. Tom Selleck is what holds it together, however I'm becoming more and more disinterested in the cast and probably won't be watching it much, if at all, this season.",1380499200,2,561,4.84375
5757182,3,B00CYQXE10,"This writing was too formulaic as was the apprehension of the suspect in a cop killing.  Not quite believable, the premise that the suspect ""lived in the neighborhood"" and had a record was never convincingly made.  The family's interactions were tiresome even by the kid's standards who knew the request to eat in the other room away from the adult dining table was coming as family conflict grew.  Young Reagan's partner is far too gorgeous and, we learn in the end, rich.  Blonde, a Porsche, how could any ""Blue Blood"" resist?  Expect a romance in the offing.

This was disappointing as a comeback show:  stilted and predictable, a more complex and character-stretching script would have been appreciated.",1380326400,,707,4.9914529914529915
5757183,5,B00CYQXE10,"Blue Bloods is one of my favorite shows....and my favorite tv family!  The Regans feel like a normal family. They are close as can be, but have their differences between them at times, too. But one thing that stays true and constant is their loyalty towards one another!!  The cases each episode are always realistic & interesting!  By purchasing the tv pass, I never have to worry about missing an episode,  and can watch it on my Kindle whenever I choose to.",1380240000,7,460,4.573170731707317

5757219,5,B00CYQXE10,"About the only scripted TV show that I look forward to watching each week. I also own seasons one through five on DVD. I think the show does a good job of humanizing people on both sides of the law. It also presents the real dilemmas faced by cops, lawyers, and judges when attempting to balance the letter of the law with fairness.
I'm impressed with the restraint that has been shown to keep Blue Bloods from becoming another soup opera with the affair of the week. Most Hospital shows seem to lean that way. Good acting, interesting stories and I love the family sitting down to eat together. Maybe that isn't what is happening in New York, but if I want a documentary I'm sure they are out there.
Thank you Blue Bloods for a little weekly unreality.",1511740800,,753,4.424460431654676

5757287,3,B00CYQXE10,"I don't watch much network TV or cable TV so I had never heard of this show. Stumbled on an episode on ION while clicking around. Found it on Prime and decided to binge it. I enjoy it - so long as I don't pick it apart. Because first off, virtually no plot continuity. Things happen - big, bad things - in one episode and then never mentioned again, as if they never happened and had no impact on the characters. There was one exception recently - the youngest son had a head trauma and it was mentioned again in a later episode. Also, the kid who plays Nicky really chews the scenery. She's always pulling a face and pastes it on even after the conversation has moved on, so you keep seeing her reaction face to something else. Selleck has maybe two reactions and he's always a grump or the wise old man. Wahlberg is really good but also a bit one-dimensional (not his fault - that's the character). Jamie too - just a bit one-note. All in all, this is the fault of the writers, not the actors. And why on earth did they get rid of Jennifer Esposito?",1490572800,,1051,4.233830845771144

5757383,5,B00CYQXE10,"The wonderful CBS television series ""Blue Bloods"" provides its viewers with the masterful assimilation of a police drama into a larger family drama. This fourth season of ""Blue Bloods"" continues its depiction of the lives of four generations of the Reagan law enforcement dynasty, a family which has a rich tradition of both police service, as well as military service. Most episodes are structured around a specific police case, which is typically associated with some type of an ethical or moral dilemma, along with other complicating factors. ""Blue Bloods"" focuses more on the fundamental relationships between its characters, rather than on action and mayhem. The weekly Sunday dinner, featuring the four generations of the Reagan family sharing a meal, as well as pertinent stories, vigorous debates, and fatherly and grandfatherly advice, is decidedly heartwarming, and gives the show a gratifying interpersonal touch. The actors of ""Blue Bloods,"" led by Tom Selleck, Donnie Wahlberg, and Bridget Moynahan, consistently deliver excellent performances, and are truly the heart of the show. I give the outstanding police and family drama, ""Blue Bloods,"" an enthusiastic five-star rating, along with my highest recommendation.",1485561600,,1229,5.577540106951871

5757456,5,B00CYQXE10,"Blue Bloods is one of the best written series I have ever watched.  Each episode usually tackles three different issues by this family of law enforcers and upholders.  I think that all of the actors are perfect for their parts and love the way that they function as a family.  They do not always agree on every point, but each has their say, down ti the youngest.  In most ways they support each other, but if one has an issue they do not hesitate to let it be known.  It gives me great insight into the workings of law enforcement and the great responsibilities of each step that takes place there.

5757790,5,B00CYQXE10,"I love this show. I've watched it thru several times on Netflix. To me it's like a fantasy. Not so much a realistic depiction of NYC police procedures, or anyone's actual family as it is an idealized fairy tale of how things ought to be. The main characters are flawed, and human, and yet noble. I love the weekly Sunday family meals. The struggles to do things rightly, the struggles to figure out WHAT the right thing is in various confusing complicated situations.. And always, always, the love and loyalty of the whole family gestalt. I have only one criticism and that's not about the show, It's the closed captions! Here on Amazon the captions frequently have absolutely NOTHING to do with the actual dialogue! I'm all like, ""What the heck???"". It's often loud where I live so the closed caption can help, but someone goofed and put in the wrong dialogue. It should have a negative effect on the enjoyment of anyone who doesn't use closed captions tho.",1477872000,,958,4.674556213017752

5758829,5,B00CYQXE10,"Blue bloods, by far, is the best police show on TV.  The Reagans' are part of our family forever.  We get so involved that we sometimes forget they are just actors and actresses, they set the bar with family values and morals.  We started watching the series towards the ending of Season 5 and watch faithfully every week.  We have Amazon Fire and have been binge watching Seasons 1 thru the midpoint of Season 5.  We watched at least 6 to 8 episodes nightly and until we are  now current.  This is an extremely well done series, and we wish them the same continued success as Law & Order SVU, which by the way, is another favorite of ours.",1461715200,,640,4.3277310924369745

Tom Selleck is a standout as the CP (but seriously, when is he not a standout? fantastic actor!)  The supporting cast are also wonderful; really enjoy Bridget's portrayal of Erin Reagan, what a classy lady!  Will Estes ""Jaime"" is my secret crush, he's just adorable, and a man of principle!  Especially enjoy the family dynamic around the dinner table.  They don't always agree, and aren't always in harmony, but at the end of the day they respect one another and work hard to keep the family ties strong.

5758902,5,B00CYQXE10,"Police, Community, Family, Judgment Calls, Ego, Action, Twists. . .Blue Bloods Seasons 1 through 6 has it all and more.  Some characters are predictable, but we get just enough variation to remain interested.  The acting and interacting of children and adults is very good.  No episode is disappointing.  The underlying theme that is introduced at the beginning of each season, then touched on throughout each show is an excellent writing practice.  Tom Selleck, while Police Commissioner does not dominate the series.  He is fair with his children, staff, officers, politicians and reporters.  I don't always agree but he is fair.  I also appreciate African-Americans, Hispanics and other people of color in dominating, positive roles.  I take something away from each episode that makes me think about what should have happened, what I would do, what if the situation occurred in another City.

5758918,5,B00CYQXE10,"My current favorite TV series.  The characters are likable, smart, honest and you root for them.  As cops they are the kind of personalities you wish all cops are. The character of Danny is driven, street smart and resourceful and will not let up until the case is solved. though sometimes goes hotdog.  and in real life would probably get him suspended.. The character of Jaime cares deeply about about people and how his presence as a cop can affect their lives both good and bad. The character of Erin is a prosecutor who will stop at nothing to see justice served. The character of Commissioner Frank Reagan is smart, tough wily and resourceful  in his efforts to best insufferable government bureaucracy constantly trying to stifle him. The technical consulting is almost impeccable.  The only flaw I could find is ""Danny's"" service weapon if chrome plated.  That never happens in real life.  For two reasons.  There is added cost for chrome plating and it reflects ambient light, literally painting a target on him. Other than great! I particularly love the weaving in of philosophy and the scenes around the dinner table where they have no holds barred discussions about real topics in the news. It is almost as good as ""West Wing."" and that is going some.",1459036800,,1263,4.788018433179723

Although there is conflict in many dimensions, the producers are kind to their characters who are, in each in their own scrappy and stubborn way committed to ethical standards and a strong sense of loyalty.

The acting is excellent and the producers are not afraid to show a family with a strong religious background, using that to get them through the day without being preachy about it.  They are not afraid to show prayer or how it influences their actions.  And they don't apologize for that either.  Great job!

The writers go over the top on the interaction between all of the characters in their professional lives; the probability of ALL four of the characters getting directly involved in the same cases is unrealistic. The series continues its legacy of an extended family loving and caring for each other and working through problems and challenges.

5759635,5,B00CYQXE10,"As with all seasons to date, stories are well acted and the cadre of recurring actors blend well thus making the ""family"" side fairly believable.  Ahh but Tom Selleck is the real glue of the series.  If we had a few more common sense real life police commissioners like the persona Selleck projects, many of the police departments that are in today's (negative) news headlines might find themselves vastly improved.",1446854400,,415,4.914285714285715
5759646,5,B00CYQXE10,"Here's my two cents. I really don't like Tom Selleck's politics and positions. But when I put aside the real life issues I have to say he plays the NYPD PC role very well. As a former NewYorker it's great to see some of the scenes that show gritty parts of the city. Very realistic. The concept and family aspects of the show are very well done. I don't imagine there's s real life family quite like this one, but the actors are very good and we come to like them. The family bonds and history all play into various plots. Some of the cast changes with Danny's partner are kind of sad because they let some really good ones get away. I would like to see more ongoing overlapping plots like they had leading up to the Blue Templar episode where the family gets to the bottom of Joe's murder. I will always remember the scene where the PC asks his son Jamie why he didn't come to him sooner and he replied 'I wanted to honor my brother'. You could feel the emotions. Great acting.",1446854400,,978,4.235294117647059

5759912,2,B00CYQXE10,"My impressions of the first 3 seasons were much more favorable than my impression of season 4. In season 4, the plots frequently tend toward the annoyingly PC and the plots involving a new character, Eddie 'Edit' Jenko, are much less than believable - sufficiently so to warrant serious ""star"" rating reduction vs. seasons 1 - 3.  The most egregiously unbelievable moment occurs when Jenko aggressively supports the ""sham marriage"" of an American woman, who Jenko opines is 'untraditionally attractive', to a Middle-Eastern guy who is in the US on a soon-to-expire student visa - said groom-to-be openly claiming to be gay.  The purpose of this sham marriage: to obtain permanent resident status in the US for the gay guy.  The kicker: the US government views 'marriages' entered into for the purpose of gaining US residency to be felonies - the penalties for which can be quite harsh.  Yet, the series writers serve up a rookie NYPD cop, self-righteously aiding and abetting, in the commission of a felony.",1443398400,,1007,4.976190476190476

5760266,2,B00CYQXE10,"I think the writing/plots hit a high shortly into the second season and has been going downhill since. Danny's bordering on psychotic.. as is Grandpa, and Frank bumbles around scrunching his face up all the time. Maybe all the booze this family guzzles might have something to do with it. Jamie's less likable the further into this series it goes. The plots use every cop clich ever thought of.. Those nice family dinners have become battlegrounds, with only the subject matter changing from week to week! The morals and ethics of the family have gone from admirable to suspect at best!

I LIKE Tom Selleck.. I wish he had stayed with Jesse Stone!",1439596800,,647,4.725663716814159

I want to see more stories featuring 'Jamie' or 'Linda', though.  I don't like Donnie's new partner as well as the previous one,  but she is growing on me.  They need to stand Bibi on a step so she can look  the commissioner in the eye instead of straining her neck.  I don't often like what she has to say, but it is giving him someone new to growl at.

Can't go wrong with Tom Selleck as far as I'm concerned, but ALL of the actors are excellent and well suited to their respective parts. The show also brings home family values, something lacking in a lot of television shows today. I admit that when I still had cable, I did not give this show a chance - must have been opposite something else I was used to watching in that time slot. But now that I don't have cable any more and only watch DVDs, I borrowed the first 3 seasons of this show and I was hooked. So I purchased Season 4 and am looking forward to more seasons.

5760479,2,B00CYQXE10,"I am surprised at all the really positive reviews of season 4.  My wife says after almost every episode, ""They must have changed all the writers after last season!""  I am also surprised at the number of people calling this ""family viewing"".  There are a lot of things in these episodes it would be hard to explain to much of the family!  A few specifics about the show -- 1) the grandfather was the wise older cop in prior seasons.  Now he is plain annoying.  His wisdom is delivering lines like this: ""if everyone ever messed with this family, they'd be looking for the body in the East River"".  Thanks, grandpa!  He sounds more like a Dirty Harry wannabe than the former commissioner.  2)  Danny had anger issues in prior seasons that he was trying to deal with.  Now, he just gives in.  Ethics???  Just get the bad guy, no matter what it takes.  I would not want a policeman like Danny loose in my city!  3)  Danny's new partner Baez is a totally card-board character.  The writers seem to think the only things she can say are over the top tough things.  Basically, her purpose in life is to hold the bad guy down so Danny can beat on them.  She has no more personality than that.  4) Nikki is the teenage daughter.  Yeah, they can be a pain.  But teenage daughters have good points too... or should.  She is just a total pain who is always saying she is ready to live her own life.  No one seems to have an answer to her challenging authority.  Maybe her mom and grandfather really are clueless?  5) I won't go into the sexual morality or lack there of, but lets just say if there ever was any, its pretty much gone.  In sum, my wife and I got through the whole season, but it was starting to be painful to watch.  No season 5 for us!",1434412800,2,1739,4.251533742331288

The cast are all great and the show does not get too involved in their personal lives it is more about being a cop.  Sometimes I wish they would show more of the characters personal lives especially Jamie the youngest brother who is not in the show much.  His character could really be explored more.  This is the type of show that you can turn on and watch a marathon of it and be completely hooked.

Season four is even better.  Varied plots keep you coming back.  Several standing minor characters will change as integral to the overall theme of the year.  Never disappointed in any of the 15-17 episodes included in the full season package.  You get 8-10 hours of interesting entertainment for about the a same price as a new release top movie.  This is great photography, plots, family values, integrity, loyalty and lessons in trusting your heart and loved ones.  We usually watch two shows over our dinner and desert.  Can't wait to get season 5.",1426118400,14,701,4.815126050420168

Remembering him on a talk show (without a job) and saying he would ""retire"" if something did not come along soon -- it was still a few more years -- but look at him now -- gorgeous as ever!  (Hate that lifting the chin after speaking, though)  The reality of Sunday dinner every week is something I wish this should could bring back.  It is missed with all the part-time jobs of teen-agers and instant technology of today....I digress.  All the performers are so well matched for their role.  Wanna be as thin as Tom's daughter, as angry and insenced as his son Danny (and get away with it) but that's what makes a good show.

5760769,2,B00CYQXE10,"Blue Bloods Season 4 Review:
Say it aint so. This famous line could easily be used when reviewing Blue Bloods, the 4th season. I should hasten to add that I thoroughly enjoyed the first three seasons. A terrific cast and entertaining episodes caused me to look forward to Season 4  Well, CBS should have stopped with season 3 because Season 4 is a big disappointment.
The cast and setting, particularly the Sunday family dinners, are first class with the exception of Dannies partner who is bland and contributes almost nothing to the already bland episodes. I have to strongly criticize the content of each episode. The stories or plots (if there are any) are either boring or so convoluted that the viewer loses interest and gets bored once again. There are no exiting surprises, just the same old shop-worn dialogues.
I should mention here that I have collected some 1000 DVDs and have, in the process, acquired a critical eye for the good, the bad and the inferior Season 4 of Blue Bloods definitely falls into the latter category.

Tom Selleck (With his gritty, distinguished gravitas.) interesting that both impressive actors Wahlberg & Turturro have talented brothers, Moynahan, Roth even young Sami Gayle (Who was excellent in ""Detachment"".) the entire cast; Cariou, Estes etc. are all excellent.  The writing is outstanding, often including a Steinbeck type of moral. Camera, editing, sound, art, direction, and of course production top professional.

I really appreciate the thrilling episodes, yes a bit idealized, combined with the love, respect, problems & resolutions of this large wonderful Irish family (usually around the dinner table). I wish I could be a family member, but an artist would not fit into a family of urban defenders.

5760924,3,B00CYQXE10,"Note: I saw every episode, save one, of this show via XFinity On Demand.

Could Blue Bloods remain strong? The answer is yes. However, it's beginning to crack, with the second or third episode depicting a useless minority sypathetically. Same goes for the episode Mistaken Identity (and I was especially horrified to hear a main character say something in Arabic or whatever language Sikhs, Muslims or Hindus speak; they all look the same to me, anyway). I decided to skip the episode Manhattan Queens, because it dealt with she-he's. I knew that as with the afore-mentioned episodes, they would be treated sympathetically, and I don't like that. Besides, they make me puke. The season finale was very good, until the writers threw in a nasty curveball into the subplot with Jaime & Edie trying to help out an Arab freak and a beautiful Polish woman. I'm ashamed of the writers for treating these insignificant minorities so sympathetically.

All that being said, the writing for the rest of the episodes is very strong, with the twins Sean and his brother generating most of the laughs with their cute wisecracks. Of course, Magnum and his eldest son get in some great moments with their one-liners. The strong moral ground has inexplicably begun to shift.

Characters were very well chosen- a great variety, representing many aspects of family life. What I liked especially were two things: Catholic faith was well represented, especially by the Commissioner. Also the fact that each episode would include, mostly at the end, a family meal together. Family life was presented in a very favorable light, even though members did not always agree with each other.

5761003,2,B00CYQXE10,"This show represents nepotism carried to utterly ridiculous extremes, tediously characterized by the aggravatingly obligatory ""family dinners"", headed by Tom Selleck whose face seems permanently frozen in a perpetual scowl. In the long ago and far away, Selleck as Magnum P.I. was a great serio-comic character, a persona he maintained, at least to some degree, in his later TV and film vehicles. With the Jesse Stone films, however, he began taking on a darker, heavier persona, although still effective and often funny. With Blue Bloods, though, his acting seems to have become wooden and much too predictable, his mouth a perfect reflection of his grim, down-curling mustache. The twinkle of wit that once made him so likeable is completely gone. His rigid, moralizing righteousness and scarcely credible ""objectivity"" where his family members are concerned strains credulity.

Donnie Wahlberg's character is, like Selleck's, mostly just gratingly irritating and seems interminably locked into a constant, growlingly foul mood. Will Estes, as the boyish cop in the family, is just that  absurdly boyish and barely believable. Worse, he's Wahlberg's ""kid brother"" as well as Selleck's youngest son. What is this, Family Affair in Blue? Having more than one member of a family be a part of the police force or justice system may not be too far-fetched, but this is ridiculous. Even Len Carriou plays not only Selleck's father, but the former Police Commissioner and the supposed eminence grise at the invariable family dinners.

The least believable part of this series is this very fact that everyone in the entire family either works directly for or is part of the same legal system as New York Police Commissioner Selleck, creating endless conflicts of interest that no justice system could or should ever tolerate. Only Bridget Moynihan's character is even slightly tangential to Selleck's authority, but they are all perpetually airing their professional problems at those exasperating family dinners where even the kids get to throw in their two cents worth of wisdom and insight. For awhile, I liked this show, but its repetitive and entirely predictable formula eventually grinds down your tolerance for all the other situational improbabilities and annoying characters.",1394928000,,2279,5.360335195530726

  Instead, the guys all said, 'yup, I served my country (right or wrong?), and we'll talk about it when you get older. ' By the time the boys get older, many have enlisted to join a mirage of ""service"" where our tax dollars are spent killing people in other countries (lots of civilians) for the benefit of the richest (Cheneys, Bushes, Koch bros, etc.).  Our military personnel get killed and maimed ('We fight the war with the equipment we have'--like insufficient armor on trucks and people) --and we don't treat them when they return with PTSD, general mental problems, no jobs, etc. etc.

I love that here is a family of cops, a lawyer, and an ER nurse, and their kids, and they have family traditions which include they all get together at dads house for Sunday dinner.

5761165,5,B00CYQXE10,"The CBS crime drama ""Blue Bloods"" returns for an excellent fourth season in 2013-2014. In the City that never sleeps, the Reagan family seems always to be on duty. Tom Selleck is Frank Reagan, family patriarch and New York City Police Commissioner, two jobs that demand tough choices every episode. He is often advised in both capacities by his father Henry (Len Cariou), himself a retired commissioner. Frank's daughter Erin (Bridget Moynihan) is a deputy district attorney and single parent. Son Danny (Donnie Wahlberg) is a hardnosed and very effective detective who often bends the rules. Youngest son Jamie (Will Estes) is a beat cop with a Harvard law degree and a last name that puts a target on his back.

A great strength of the show continues to be its engaging mixture of crime-of-the-week police procedural and family drama. Its plot invariably set up tough choices for the characters, without easy outs. The cases always seem to find their way to the Reagan family Sunday dinner, with Frank called upon to referee disputes among his children.

Frank often worries about the dangers his family faces at work, as for example in one early season episode in which Erin is wounded and taken hostage at the court house by a desperate suspect, who will only negotiate with Danny. Another early case has Danny tracking a serial killer while trying to protect the personal secrets of a key witness, a handsome actor who draws the attention of all the Reagan women.  A season-ending thriller will find Danny enmeshed in a conspiracy inside the police department.

This fourth season brings some cast changes. After a string of interim partners, Danny seems set with new partner Maria Baez (Marisa Ramirez), an experienced cop who tries to keep him in line. Jamie also gets a new partner, Eddie Janko (Vanessa Ray), a fresh-faced and attractive blonde rookie right out of the police academy, who has a mysterious background and way more money than the average rookie cop. Erin's ex-husband will make a reappearance, also.

""Blue Bloods"" is highly recommended to its fans as solid, family-oriented Friday night drama.",1381536000,60,2118,4.971751412429379
