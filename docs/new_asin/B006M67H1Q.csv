5003897,5,B006M67H1Q,"I never heard of this movie, or of anyone in the cast.  I tried it only because Amazon feedback rated it as four stars, which I interpreted to be at least promising.  I was really surprised.  This film is great.  It's funny, realistic enough to be at least halfway credible, very good script and screenplay, and excellent acting.  It WILL be boring to audiences who crave explosions, superheros, and aliens from outer space . . . but that's about it.  If you enjoy well written and produced humor intended for educated adults then this film suits the bill.",1421452800,5,556,4.622448979591836

5003902,4,B006M67H1Q,"Funny and entertaining! A look into a crazy world of egos, money, promises, dreams, and hopes.
I just love Jeffrey Tambor in anything he is in.",1398816000,,143,4.538461538461538
5003903,5,B006M67H1Q,"As a fan of Jeffrey Tambor, I was looking forward to cozying up on a fridig winter evening to watch the movie.  I was not disappointed.  It was an intelligent, fun, well-paced movie with a nice surprise ending.  Full of wit and humor, but not crass in anyway.  A nice change of pace in today's market.  Enjoy!",1389139200,,309,4.350877192982456

5003906,3,B006M67H1Q,"NOT ""Scathingly Hilarious"" not hilarious at all, I wouldn't even characterize it as funny I didn't laugh out loud once. It was also a little slow. But neither of these short comings are damnable... I found this to be a pleasant and amusing little film that was populated with somewhat shallow but engaging characters. It was mercifully short at 1:25 if it had dragged on for 2 hours I would be less charitable. I see this as a watered-down version of The Producers, definitely not a bad movie.... just a little weak.",1461715200,,516,4.619565217391305

5003909,5,B006M67H1Q,"Essential ""small"" movie ,i.e.. film for the folks in the relatively newly formed  colony of Tribeca (  although Deniro says movie), that succeeds through
the energy,brilliance and enthusiasm of the ensemble cast and director. The ensemble cast features Jeffrey Tambor in the lead role-he turns in a remarkable performance that is the pivot for the rest of the ensemble. The challenge is the setting-the entire movie is set in one location-a restaurant. As you watch you begin to think this has more of the stuff of a play, not a movie , yet it works. It works not simply because of great dialogue, that's the stuff of theater not moving pictures, but primarily of the director's ability to tell a story.... and to find the performing talent to bring that story to fruition. The plot-so if you are interested in a very funny version of how a play gets to Broadway this is for you. It will hold your interest from the start.",1449014400,,922,4.6503067484662575

5003911,2,B006M67H1Q,"I could not watch much of this. It was overly predictable.
I had to skip much of it as it seemed to drag on.
I think there are better comedy movies out there.
Try Get Shorty instead for example.",1431993600,,194,4.0

5003913,4,B006M67H1Q,"Really good film with great parts, but several missed opportunities.  Jeffrey Tambor was great as were Jesse Plemons, Melinda McGraw, and Jill Marie Jones.  Melinda McGraw plays upscale sexy/sultry parts extremely well and she was perfect in this part.  Jesse Plemons played his part well, but they really could have cleaned him up a bit.  He looked like a homeless guy who had no business meeting anyone, let alone a famous Broadway director at a swank NY restaurant.  He looked better in ""Breaking Bad"".  I couldn't take him seriously in this role even though he played it well.  He never tucked in his shirt and his hair was terrible.  Overall, I enjoyed the film but there were several comedic misses.",1428278400,,705,4.816666666666666

8500604,3,B006M67H1Q,this movie will put you to sleep.conversations at a restaurant. nothing happens.,1517961600,,80,5.75
8500605,2,B006M67H1Q,"This was a film that took a lot to get through. I stuck with it because I was told the ending was the best. No, it was not. I understand this was a play or a farce of films and Broadway, but it really had nothing to offer. Most of the action takes place in a restaurant or outside on the street. It is slow going, with nothing to offer.

A nice cast, Jeffrey Tambor and Jesse Plemons, but it did not rise above mediocre.

Not Recommended For Me. prisrob 08-13-17",1502582400,,462,4.065934065934066
8500606,1,B006M67H1Q,"The only savory thing in this disastrous waste of time (mine) and money (theirs) is the irony of Tambor playing an illustrious theater director prostituting himself to get the financing for his next production. The irony being that Tambor himself consented to be in this mega disaster of a movie, thus prostituting his considerable talents in a feckless a piece of garbage that makes ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"" look like ""The Seventh Seal."" Sure, I guess even someone of JT's stature and gifts may occasionally have to lower himself for filthy lucre, but this thing is sewage of a rare ordure. I must have a streak of masochism, ordinarily, I would have stopped watching something this awful 10 minutes in, but then there was the fascination of seeing millions of dollars being poured into a script that could not be revived by an army of rewriters.",1499299200,,851,4.795918367346939
8500607,4,B006M67H1Q,"This movie is a parody of Hollywood and Broadway.  While it comes across as boring at first, the kickers come toward the end and leaves the viewer realizing that they, too, fell for this!

Almost the entire movie takes place inside an upscale restaurant.  A once-popular movie director is recruiting actors for his latest film and made arrangements to meet one man for the lead role.  This young actor reminds me of a very young Matt Damon.  The director is watched by a reporter for an entertainment magazine and there's even a man who brags about his high funding for potential blockbusters.  Are any of these people for real?!

The scenes are heavy on dialogue since most actors are seated inside this restaurant.  No one ever takes an order and no food is ever served, but the last ten minutes the plot quickly unravels to an amusing finale.  One must view this movie not so much as a comedy, but as a parody of the entertainment industry.",1484179200,,943,4.598802395209581

8500610,4,B006M67H1Q,"A funny, situational comedy that just keeps getting sillier!  Someone with a very vivid imagination wrote this crazy movie-perhaps a bit warped but talented for sure.  A nice short, ""sweet"", fun movie for adults.  At first you feel you are missing something, but can't put your finger on it.  Then you realize you have no idea what crazy thing will happen next.  This is a funny, well orchestrated movie that is pure entertainment.",1482105600,,431,4.8493150684931505
8500611,5,B006M67H1Q,"What a treat! Great acting, great script, great surprises: just pure enjoyment. I usually read the negative reviews first, if there is a significant proportion of them. With this film they are an insignificant minority and they are all WRONG. I am so glad that I ignored them and watched the movie. I have not been so pleasantly surprised in a long, long, time. I can't believe this movie isn't better well known.",1482019200,,413,4.671232876712328
