7912375,5,B00000JL3W,"These episodes, along with tape 7, aren't taken from the original Manga, but to draw out the Shin saga long enough, some filler episodes had to be made. Kenshiro finds himself in the midst of a battle between two rival gangs in episode 16, then a flashback episode in 17, and finally, in the best one, Ken has to destroy an entire tank- using only his martial art. These are actually pretty interesting episodes, but will still disappoint those that want Ken to hurry up and get Shin already. The subtitled version has a better soundtrack and better acting than the dubbed version.",992908800,,581,4.650485436893204
