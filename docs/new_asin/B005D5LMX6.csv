8466298,5,B005D5LMX6,"Of the various Yellowstone videos I've purchased, this is without a doubt the one I'd recommend.  Do not be fooled by its 63 minutes.  This video does an excellent job covering a lot of topics without stretching topics too long and ensuring it's not too short.  The perfect goldilocks!

If you only are going to purchase one video, this is the one for your trip.",1493596800,,362,4.523076923076923

8466301,5,B005D5LMX6,A nice video to reminisce a recent trip to Yellowstone Park. Also nice to share with others to enjoy the beauty of the park!,1440720000,,124,4.208333333333333
8466302,5,B005D5LMX6,"I live only about 800 miles from Yellowstone, but I have never been there. This DVD may have shortcomings, others have pointed them out. But, based on this DVD, I told my wife that we are going there for my 75th birthday next year.",1405641600,,231,4.2727272727272725
8466303,3,B005D5LMX6,"While the photography was lovely, some of it was repetitive, especially of the animals.  I was disappointed at the lack of description or even identification of the gorgeous Absaroka Mountains that form the eastern boundary of the park and frame Yellowstone Lake.  And the section on the Tetons didn't even mention or show Jenny Lake, which is not only one of the most gorgeous spots for viewing the mountains but also offers great--and easy--hiking. I just returned from Yellowstone, which is where I bought the DVD.  I thought it would be a great memento and memory jogger, but I doubt that I'll watch it again.",1402704000,,613,4.819047619047619
8466304,5,B005D5LMX6,A very good overall guide to the park. It shows step by step how to get around and where all the attractions are. It breaks down the roadways to small sections and shows the attractions along each section. It tells how far the hikes are to the different sites and how hard the hike is. It also gives the driving time to each area. I never realized how big Yellowstone actually is.,1394841600,,380,4.291666666666667
8466305,4,B005D5LMX6,This is a great way to revisit a fabulos vacation & not to have to run all over to find what you need. I love to go to Amazon to find what I want & I know it will be perfect. This is a great film of Yellowstone Park & I recommend it to everyone even if you have not been there.,1350691200,,277,3.4838709677419355
