1624347,5,B00005M2FI,I bought this for my son for Christmas and he has watched it at least once a day since.  He is 14 months old and bounces to the music.  We even took it on our recent trip to Florida and brought our laptop so he could watch it on the plane.  The only other DVD's that we had purchased before for our son were from the Baby Einstein series.  My son now prefers Elmo hands down.  We anxiously awaiting the release of the Elmo's World - Springtime in February.,1012435200,,456,4.078651685393258
1624348,5,B00005M2FI,"My 26-month old daughter asks for ""Wile Wile Wes"" every morning, and she could watch it all day if we let her.  It's got great songs for dancing to, and she loves horses.  I recommend it to any child who loves Elmo!",1009929600,,215,4.095238095238095
1624349,4,B00005M2FI,"I have four sons, ages between 2 and 8 years.  All four of them were riveted to this film, and have watched it a couple of times in the short time that we've had it.  It's wonderful to have found a movie I can feel completely comfortable allowing my children to watch - that they actually enjoy viewing more than once.",1008460800,,318,4.19672131147541
1624350,5,B00005M2FI,"My toddler daughter loves this DVD and seems to never tire of watching it- end to end- in a complete state of captivated rapture.  I think the nice thing about Elmo is that for some strange reason, most adults-myself included-find him to be entertaining as well.  I hope Sesame Street produces more of these extended Elmo's World programs.",1008028800,,339,4.827586206896552
1624351,4,B00005M2FI,"After a week's worth of viewing this tape, I'm still not sure how I feel about it.  Our daughter, age 18 months, is an absolute Elmo fanatic, and we have many, many Elmo and Sesame Street tapes in our collection.  We were excited to see this one come out, because she also loves cowboys/cowboy music, like ""Riders in the Sky"" (singing cowboy group) and so do we!  The Riders don't appear on this tape, but the guests who do seem to fit the bill just fine!
Overall, I think we've had a positive reaction to it, but it does make me understand why ""Elmo's World"" segments are only about 15 minutes long.  That's about how long you really want to hear Elmo do his high-energy exploration of any one subject.  This tape is a really, really long Elmo's World, more or less--and it can seem to go on and on and on.  Smaller viewers and less patient parents may get that ""when's it going to end?"" feeling.  However, you can see why they had to make it long--you get lots of cute extra things like footage of Elmo riding a real pony, songs like ""Home on the Range,"" a segment about Pecos Bill (with a mustached Elmo as Bill), etc.  Too many to fit in 15 minutes!  You also get a couple visits with ""Cowboy Noodle"" etc.  If your kid is a wannabe cowboy, and also an Elmo fan, this is like heaven!
The Sesame Street folks also tack on a few extras, which I believe are included in the total running time listed on the tape.  One is the ""Monster Clubhouse"" segment you may have seen them run on Sesame Street.  Four brand-new monster characters have a fun little meeting in their clubhouse.  No, your child won't learn much, but it's silly and cute.  I find it a tad too high-energy, and the character voices are a little annoying.  The second ""bonus"" is a short segment of Baby Bear and his hero (which he drew with crayons), ""Hero Guy.""  It's extra fun for the kids, but I can't help but feel that the Sesame Street people know they have a captive audience, so they use new tapes as a set-up to get you hooked on their new ideas/segments/shows.  I don't think either of these add-ons is exciting enough to be a stand-alone, but there's no ballot included in the video box. ; )",1003017600,40,2166,4.321782178217822

She is normally glued to the t.v. when he is on.  Unfortunately this video did not keep her attention as the skits with people imbetween the bits with Elmo are just too long.  I would stick to ""Best of Elmo"" or the videos with multiple topics such as ""Elmo has two Hands, Ears, and Feet"" (they are simply a collection of his shows from Sesame Street).",1122508800,,488,4.4

What REALLY matters is that my 2 year old son absolutely loves this video. He has several other Elmo videos, but this is his definite favorite. It's the only one he asks specifically for. He calls it ""Horsey"", in reference to the horses that they show in many different parts of the video. I think it's cute too, and the part where the Noodle siblings perform their western dance usually makes me giggle. BEWARE, though, of the horrid ""Monster Clubhouse"" short after the credits end! It's like some amateur boss' nephew at Sesame Street got permission to try their hand at their own ""show"". It's just plain boring, stupid, and irritating.",1119916800,,779,4.777777777777778

My favorite is when Travis Tritt (?) comes at the end so Elmo can talk to a real cowboy and learn more. It's just a lot of fun, the live action segments are great, and the music is catchy. The video also has a short segment after called Monster Clubhouse. I haven't seen these characters before, but it's okay. Nothing great. Then there's a very short Hero Guy segment after that that's also just okay. Gives you your money's worth, if nothing else.

Kids can learn about Pecos Bill, watering and saddling a horse, putting on a vest, and other ""western"" things. The music is catchy and the little dances will make the kids laugh.
Two additional features are included at the end of the tape, a Monster's Clubhouse and Hero Guy segment.

Elmo's voice tends to get on my nerves, but I'm not the intended audience, and the show makes my toddler happy.  I'm not so thrilled with the add-on's of the ""Monster Club"" and ""Baby Bear's Hero Guy"" so we usually end the showing before they start.

After about six months, as might be expected he tired of them.  But...he was given this tape for Valentine's Day by his grandmother and it is all he wants to watch now.
The style is actually one longer episode of Elmo's World about the Wild Wild West that includes not just Mr. Noodle and Mr. Noodle's brother Mr. Noodle, but Miss Noodle as well.  A number of the other Sesame Street characters show up in a segment about square dancing too.  Once that portion is over there is a ""Monster Clubhouse"" segment and a ""Hero Guy"" episode with Baby Bear.

All the Noodles, including Miss Noodle, riding their horse Macoroni and doing a really cute western dance in which Elmo joins them. And a good singer, Travis Trent, singing a song about Pacos Bill in which Elmo plays Pacos. It is a cute story too.
