8567346,1,B00BEY5SBM,The guitar was a great purchase that met my expectations. I'm not real thrilled with dadgad tuning because it conflicts with traditional tuning methods.,1398470400,,152,5.375
8567347,5,B00BEY5SBM,"this dvd is fantastic! But, because nothing is perfect, should be cool a version with different languages, starting in Spanish for my child, she have 12, and in other languages is hard to find something like this specially for beginners. If you have a version with titles in Spanish will be very welcomed.",1397088000,2,305,4.773584905660377
