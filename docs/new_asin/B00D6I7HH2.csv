5775178,5,B00D6I7HH2,"but this movie did.  I had originally watched the first one months ago but decided to re-watch before renting this movie.  I'm glad I did because it segued nicely.  There are two things I absolutely love about this movie.  One is that it never deviates from the message of Jesus Christ in order to tell a compelling, action packed story.  The second thing is Bruce Marchiano who plays an awesome Jesus.

I think sometimes people are skeptical of a Christian movie appearing to be too mainstream.  While this movie had a lot of action (at some points it had the feel of the Terminator movies), as I said previously it always focused on Christ.  The acting was very good.  The message was clear.  The production was crisp.

I would recommend this movie to everyone to watch and kudos to Pureflix for making another great movie...",1373673600,13,827,4.63448275862069
5775179,5,B00D6I7HH2,"Revelation Road 2 was really awesome. It had me on the edge of my seat for the whole hour and a half.

With respect for the reviewer who feels that the movie portrays a false doctrine, I personally don't feel that the movie is in any way pushing a particular doctrine. There are many good Christians, people who truly love the Lord, who do not agree about when the rapture will occur or if there even is to be one. I grew up in a church that believes in a pre-tribulation rapture. My half-sister believes it will be post tribulation, and I know of others who don't think there is anything in the bible to support that there will be a rapture at all.

To me it seems more important that these Christian movies are portraying Jesus for who He is, The Son of God and the Son of Man...part of the Holy Trinity, God Himself come in the flesh. Revelation Road 2 emphasized throughout the film the importance and wonderful joy of getting to know Jesus as a personal savior.

The quality of the movie was great, the effects were great, the story and directing was great, the acting was great and the soundtrack was great.

I highly reccommend this movie. Can't wait for part 3.",1373673600,8,1169,4.373271889400922
5775180,3,B00D6I7HH2,"I love the revelations road movies but, as a believer these movies that teach false doctrine will lead baby Christians or backslidden Christians astray. It about time that these movies companies makes a end time move about the truth. The catching up of the saints does not happen until after the tribulation. Matthew 24 explains that, and apostasy  means departure of faith not the secret rapture. The great tribulation is about Satan and him waging war against the saints it has nothing to do with the wrath of God, the wrath of God happens after the tribulation. I know there is gonna be a lot of christians telling me i am wrong, and that is fine, i am not gonna debate anyone. I just tell my other brother and sisters that don't have to take my word for it, they will have to see for themselves. But other then that it was still a great movie to watch. :)",1373673600,2,859,4.40251572327044
5775181,5,B00D6I7HH2,"Once again, Pure Flix does it--makes a movie that entertains and delivers a powerful spiritual message. Recommend seeing Revelation Road 1 to get the full impact of this movie. And while you're at it, check out the other well-done Pure Flix movies with David A. R. White, such as In the Blink of an Eye, Brother White, What If, Me Again, Marriage Retreat, among many others. Thank G-d for this film company, its actors, writers and creatives to make this films come alive.",1373587200,8,472,4.698795180722891
5775182,5,B00D6I7HH2,"I have been waiting awhile to see the sequel to Revelation Road. Once I saw the first movie I knew I wanted more and looked up if there would be a sequel (I kind of figured there would be because they left it open after everyone disappeared) I have to say I was not disappointed. Like most Pure Flix movies it was well done and very believable and tugged at your heart strings. I love David A.R. White and his wife Andre White, they work so well together. And I absolutely love Bruce Marchiano playing Jesus. I don't think they could have found a better actor to play him. When I have seen him in other movies playing Jesus he truly plays the part so well that he makes you believe that it is Jesus himself. He is so soft spoken, gentle in the way he handles people and the way he smiles it's like he glows when he is talking to his children. I loved him in Encounter, Encounter 2 Paradise Lost and Revelation Road and then this movie. All in all this movie was GREAT and I would recommend it to all my friends. If you have seen Revelation Road then I suggest you see part 2 if you haven't you should grab some snacks and drinks watch Revelation Road and then watch this one. I promise you will NOT be sorry you did...God Bless to you all...Sandi",1373587200,42,1246,4.195833333333334

It was an interesting take on end times themes I suppose....",1503360000,,350,4.661290322580645

5775276,2,B00D6I7HH2,"""Revelation Road"" is a Christian-based recruiting film for the unsaved. It depicts one man's journey from amoral government killing machine to acolyte of Jesus. The story is stripped down to simple basics and is somewhat ham-handed in the method by which it delivers its message, as many such movies are. It's as if they're so eager to spread The Word they get ahead of themselves. Special effects are clumsy, acting is mediocre to poor (except for a surprisingly rich performance by former NFL great Brian Bosworth) and writing is at times like fingernails on a chalk board. Still, it's an ambitious movie (it and its sequel, which I watched back to back). I'm not much on being proselytized but ""Revelation Road"" was entertaining enough. I would add it's surprisingly violent, with lots of shootings, beatings and whatnot. Maybe not suitable for vacation Bible school. The sequel is not as strong as the first installment.",1464652800,,924,5.0064935064935066

When I first started watching the Revelation series I was impressed, but with the continued experience, I was profoundly influenced so much so that I was moved to extend the experience to other Christians who, I dare say, were flagging in their faith.  This series lit their collective fires for Christ and for our Lord in such a way as to reunite them with God in the most powerful way one can imagine.  Now I am getting requests to see the series and read the book.

This movie shows what life might be like after the rapture takes place. Loved, loved, LOVED the rapture scene.....
God gets the glory in this movie and that is why I am rating it 5 stars. It is truly a message of love, forgiveness and redemption.
Realistic, great acting, lots of action, wonderful messages intertwined in it and how God can soften even the most hardened hearts.
Worth watching.... take inventory of your heart and make certain you believe and are saved IN YOUR HEART before the rapture takes place.... because it will CERTAINLY happen someday soon..... be ready so you won't be left behind. It will be a different world than what we know now. Loved the statement ""Don't you feel the difference?"" - that's what it will be like according to Revelation. Unrest and the world will be turned upside down. This movie is Biblically sound.
I believe this is even better than the ""Left Behind"" movies.",1407801600,,1098,4.689119170984456

I think we were expecting it to follow more in line of the Bible but it really doesn't at all.  But for a made up story and a continuation of the people in Road 1, it is very good movie.  You find out in Road 2 why the people are the way they are.  A little hard to see Brian Bosworth as the bad guy (in Road 1 also) because he usually played the good guys in his other movies.  (And to see him Old!  But I think that's because it means I'M old)  But all in all- I would recommend this movie to everyone-especially if you seen Road 1.

5775412,4,B00D6I7HH2,"The rapture became part of some Christians Doctrine only in the middle 1800's.  The belief is central to some sects for sure.  The whole idea is tinged with violence and death. And you get lots of both here.  This is like a low budget sci fi film ,  where people burn up in light and a pile of ashes are left. Only in this case it's the rapture,  still those people are DEAD. And you have to give the filmmakers real credit for that.  After all , most rapture believers don't think they will DIE in the rapture!.  But clearly they do , in a painless way. BUt dead , is dead.  Also jesus  strangely a white man, (he was  a brown skinned man), comes and asks a girl  to DIE.  The undercurrent of the rapture movement is dependent on violence.  Jesus can't come without mass slaughter and death, even of his followers.  IN this film a assassin battles a motorcycle gang as things fall apart.  It's a good sci fi action tale, in that way.  I liked this movie and it is far from boring!.  Eric Roberts is in this one in  a small role too.  The rapture can obsess people, so that even if jesus comes back , without the rapture , these people might self destruct or worse.  If it is real, then fine. But this is a new faith and this movie is from that new faiths belief system.",1402185600,,1270,4.148148148148148

I didn't know it starred Brian Bosworth, whom I had little respect for in the past because of his arrogance. Watching both parts, 1 & 2, I was amazed. What a GREAT story line and production. It was extremely satisfying to see a movie that had a Christian influence yet told a gripping story that all should be able to relate to somehow. I have since read of Brian's conversion to Christianity and am so happy about that as well.

This movie has drama, action, and even a SPOT of comedy (only in one spot that is).  There is some fighting but not near as much as in the first movie.  In this one alot of the PAST of the character's are explained which makes it really good.-------------

This movie does have a STRONG FAITH MESSAGE.  To me it is great to see a christian movie actually have ""Jesus"" in it.  Everybody knows when someone is trying to ""go around the bush"" so to speak and not actually use the name of Jesus or be kind of a ""hidden message of christinity"".  Come on--even sinners know what you are trying to do--so why try to hide ""the Message""?.--------------------------------------------- I agree with the message of this movie.....it is all about Jesus and FORGIVENESS!!

5775541,4,B00D6I7HH2,"I watched the first in this series, ""Revelation Road: The Beginning of the End"" a while back and absolutely loved it.  Pure Flix Entertainment is really bringing some great faith-based films to the table.  After seeing the first, I could not wait for the next...but I had to.  I waited until I could purchase the film because I didn't want to just stream it as I had the first.

""Revelation Road 2: Sea of Glass & Fire"" picks up where the first left off, and fulfills two purposes one is to give the viewer some more background on Josh with answering the question of why is he the way he is and is he aware of it?  We also get a little recap on exactly went down in the first movie and get more of an understanding on the relationship issues between the biker gang's leader Hawg and on Cat who seems so tortured through both films.  The viewer also sees how God has had a hand on their lives in a unique way for a unique purpose and even the negative parts can be used in a positive light.

Generally I'd say Revelation Road 2 has a smooth running plot that gives us some steps forward with some long glances back.  As with other films like this, there are people who are reeling after an obvious rapture scenario with most not understanding what went on and still others who do get it and know full well that somehow they truly weren't the believers they thought themselves to be.  This always gives me food for thought.  The actors and actresses did a great job.  You will often find people who are a bit more canned, but not in this film.  The cast definitely took the time to really grow into character which for myself was greatly appreciated especially because I am one who is often disappointed when I see a Christian film come out with a wonderful message but the message is relayed by actors who are wooden, and everyone I try to share it with just shakes their head.  This is a film of quality with many wonderful moments.  I look forward to the next film in this series.",1385683200,,1981,4.318918918918919

""I have been a Christian for over fifty years; I have been in pastoral ministry over thirty years. I believe I have a good handle on the Word and the Christian life. This film says absolutely nothing about either. From the standpoint of the ""rapture"" [so called] the film is totally lacking in a Biblical foundation. I am not sure what a non-believer would think about what is portrayed here, except that perhaps there is a second chance following Christ's return. This could not be further from the truth. And the last thirty seconds wherein God is portrayed by a scruffy old man welcoming someone who has spent the majority of his life in a motorcycle gang and knows nothing of Christ, absolute nonsense. Don't writers and producers of these films read the Word before producing them. Perhaps they should view a fine film like ""Fireproof"" wherein the Gospel message is graciously and fully presented before making up biblical fairy tales. Now please, don't think I am trying to be harsh for harshness sake, I am trying to wake up the alleged Christian film making community into putting Scriptural truth into their films and stop trying to attract the world through violence that they can get anywhere else. This is the Living Word of the Living God they're attempting to put on film. They must do it prayerfully, and reverently and honestly. God will use nothing less.""",1381190400,3,1451,4.735177865612648

5775575,5,B00D6I7HH2,"As a Christian who thrives on action/adventure movies, I REALLY enjoyed Revelation Road 1 and 2. The story itself isn't about events in Revelation, but rather focuses on a Mad Max-like story with the Rapture as a backdrop. The depiction of the Rapture itself was just AMAZING, a reminder of the wonderful hope we Christians are waiting for. I've seen others rag on this movie pretty hard, but I found that the acting was actually really good, the story and its characters interesting, and the overall quality of the film quite good for being on such a low budget. My only negative is directed to producer David A.R. White: dude, this is the second film project of yours I've seen that was mostly shot on dirt roads in back-country California (the other one being The Encounter); you've GOT to get out and film in mainstream America! It probably ups your budget a bit, but there's only so much you can do out in the California desert (though that setting fit this story pretty well).",1380067200,,982,4.649425287356322

5775577,5,B00D6I7HH2,"Christian movies are usually known for their wonderful message but low budget movies.

Well, I am hear to tell you that Pure Flix has done a great job of changing that stereotype about Christian movies.

Revelation Road 2, like the first one of this series shares the gospel in a very compelling way.  And it does it in a story that draws you in, involves you in the character's plights in a way that will leave you on the edge of your seat.  And has a surreal quality that will entice you throughout the whole movie

David A.R. White as the character Josh, does an excellent job of portraying a character that is beat down by his choices in life and even though he does not know it, is looking for answers.  He takes a truly unfeeling character and gives it life.  this is one of David A.R. White's best performances,and that is saying something, because he does a really great job in The Moment After II.

And you will just love the character Elizabeth!  Noell Coet is so good in this part, that you cannot imagine anyone else playing Elizabeth.  Her portrayal is spot on brilliant.

Ray Wise is perfect as the character that shares the gospel with Josh.  And as always, Eric Roberts does such a wonderful job in these Pure Flix Christian movies.  he adds the perfect touch to any cast lineup.  Andrea Logan White and Brian Bosworth (yes, the football player) play a very realistic dysfunctional family.  Their enmity is so well done, and their conflict takes twists and turns that have to be watched from the 1st Revelation Road movie.

And you can't leave out the portrayal of Jesus (The Stranger), done by the incomparable Bruce Marchiano.  Bruce Marchiano plays many cameos/parts in Pure Flix movies as Jesus.  He does the best job of portraying how the Bible shows us Jesus as loving, caring, compassionate and honest,  I have never seen another actor who does a better job of getting the whole character of Jesus across in a film.

I have to say, that overall, Revelation Road 2 is now one of my top favorite movies and it has to been seen with it's 1st part, to truly appreciate the message of the film.

If you love Christian movies, especially Christian End Times movies, then you will not find a better film in this genre.  And if you are curious about Christian end times movies, but never really have seen any, the action is really great too, plus some really spectacular special effects.",1379808000,,2402,4.563084112149533

5775582,2,B00D6I7HH2,"The film opens with the end of the world narration and a bit part by Eric Roberts, who sadly was the best actor in the production. We get to flashback the first film and relive the Rapture again. The whole world is plunged into darkness, except where the sun is still shining, or those who have generators. Joshua (David A.R. White) our main character is traveling west with Beth (Noell Coet) and attempting to avoid the evil biker gang that carries the Hammer of Thor. We find out this was a Christian biker group at one time and that Joshua is really Jason Bourne, but no Matt Damon.

Add a reading from the Gospel of Matthew, four bikers symbolizing the Four Horsemen, and a few bad bikers trying to be redeemed and you pretty much have it part 2.

The acting and script is still bad, but appears to be an improvement over the first one. Were those soda pop tops as part of a biker necklace?

No animals were harmed and no African-Americans were Raptured during the making of this film.

This movie is even better then ""Left Behind."" I thought the first ""Revelation Road"" was good but this sequel was hands down better.  The action in this movie was exceptional and not something you would ordinarily expect from a Christian movie. It kept you on the edge of your seat, that's for sure. Brian Bosworth is as convincing a bad guy as you'll find. In fact the entire cast was very good but that new young actress, Noell Coet, who plays the roll of Beth in the movie is a real comer. Mark my words she is destined for super stardom. She was funny and entertaining but at the end she had you in tears. She is really a remarkable young actress.

Everything about this movie is outstanding. It may be a low budget film but it is also a first class film.

5775631,5,B00D6I7HH2,"Loved It... Love David A.R. White's movies, his movies talk to you and not shove GOD down peoples throats like some of the other Christian movies out there.  Loved Revelation Road 2 from beginning to end.",1373846400,,204,4.666666666666667
5775632,5,B00D6I7HH2,Made me think a lot about how world is changing; we don't know when that time will be...but we really need to wake up and start living what we are called to do...Show others God's love and lead them to Jesus!,1373846400,,208,4.097560975609756
5775633,5,B00D6I7HH2,"It was exuberant to say the least! Loved how each character was explained. Still a tease to a sequel but not overtly so as in RR1.  I agree with others, very well cast movie. Movie screams that great line from The End of the Harvest: The End of the World comes to thousands of people every day... followed up by the Biblical Truth: Today Is The Day Of Salvation - Don't Miss It For The World.
