2666937,5,B000J4P818,I feel like I've been playing poker for a 150 years and this is the best film I've ever seen on the subject.  Just Buy It!,1162857600,24,122,3.6923076923076925
2666938,5,B000J4P818,"Great movie.  Being an amature poker player, I had no IDEA I'd be so riveted to what was a really fascinating social commentary on life, drive, ambition, family & the American dream.  It's a compelling story as much as a fun ride!  And I learned a whole lot more about poker.",1161820800,25,275,4.352941176470588
2666939,5,B000J4P818,"I loved this film.  My fiancee is a huge poker fan, and I bought this for him as a gift. It was the perfect gift for him. This is now one of our favorite films, even though I'd never really understood his obsession with poker. Now I get it. I was riveted by the personalities and determination of the main characters and the people we met along the way. Very entertaining slice of one wild way to pursue the American Dream! WE BOTH LOVED IT and highly recommend it!",1161648000,23,465,4.224719101123595
2666940,4,B000J4P818,"yes it's good and she is cute, that helps.",1166572800,,42,3.7777777777777777
2666941,5,B000J4P818,This documentary far exceeded my expectations. The interviews of the poker greats are top notch and they alone are worth the purchase price. The lead woman is annoying...but in a way that keeps you watching the film to see what she will do next. I'm not a big poker player but really enjoyed this documentary. Its a home run.,1165881600,23,325,4.52542372881356
2666942,4,B000J4P818,"But the real reason to watch this engrossing doc is the real deal poker players that surround that skinny, annoying (there should be a bounty on her head for chatting on the cell phone DURING PLAY!) woman - the filmakers (and editors) have done a great job putting the film together and it's exciting to be in the midst of the drama of poker playing and the family drama between Susan and her poor husband (at least he's in a better place at the end of the film - no spoilers here).  I do recommend this and look forward to more from the people involved.",1165536000,27,554,4.276190476190476
2666943,5,B000J4P818,"So yes, I couldn't stand Susan Genard, the lead in the film. Her voice grated at my nerves throughout the flick and got me physically ill... but movie on.

I freakin loved the poker star interviews. These guys (and a few women) are completely nuts. They explain how they get into your head and what their thoughts are ""destroy you at the table"". That I liked. No, that I loved! I actually felt a comraderie with the stars in the film; knowing they had to interact with Susan at one point or another, I felt we all hated her equally and had all been tortured by her at one point!

Don't expect a how-to guide, don't expect a deep documentary... expect some of the greatest poker interviews of all time and allow that to drive your purchase. I love poker. I love Vegas, I loved this!",1165536000,26,781,4.342465753424658
2666944,5,B000J4P818,"I wasn't sure I'd like this movie because I'm not into poker, but I really enjoyed this because of the odd characters who are poker players as well as the relationship between the two main people making the movie.  I assumed you would have to be a little different to play poker for a living and this documentary confirms it.",1165276800,25,325,4.416666666666667
2666945,5,B000J4P818,"I saw a review of this movie on Danial Negreanu's web site and had to get it. I'm an avid poker player and I thought ""No Limit"" was the best and most realistic poker movie I have seen. I have no idea what the people who gave it bad marks were thinking!",1164844800,27,252,3.8653846153846154
2666946,2,B000J4P818,"I too have read great reviews for this movie and put down the 25 bucks with little hesitation. This movie ended up being a stinker. I was sick of the 'bad beats' after the first half hour. if you are a true poker enthusiast than i reccomend watching this doc. if you can find it in your local video rental store, but don't buy it like i did.",1164499200,5,341,4.029411764705882
2666947,5,B000J4P818,"Great poker movie!  Incredible interviews and insights on what it

takes to be a successful in poker and in life.",1164067200,29,113,4.6
2666948,5,B000J4P818,"This movie gets you excited from the start.. It follows Susan through the trials and tribulations of being a true professional poker player.. It has interviews with some of the greatest poker pros of today.. It shows the true life emotional rollercoaster life that these pros face day in and day out.. How they juggle family, bankroll ect.. It captures the true element of inside the poker community.. I actualy went to the World Series of Poker this year and seen Susan playing in a cash game.. A true poker player at heart!

I would recommend No Limit to everyone as a must have!

2666949,5,B000J4P818,"These guys really nailed the emotional rollercoaster life of pro poker players, while covering all the bases with the best pro's in the business, they really brought it home for me with the family angle.

Brilliant!",1163376000,28,215,4.972222222222222
8149211,2,B000J4P818,"That's seriously all it is.

Pretty much the entire movie is this chick complaining to her ex-husband (the director of the movie) how she was so close to making the money at this tournament but got knocked out because she got unlucky.

If you're brand new to poker, this might be somewhat entertaining. But if you've been around the poker scene long enough to want to strangle someone whenever they start to tell you a bad beat story, this might as well be a horror film.",1400457600,,471,4.465116279069767
8149212,1,B000J4P818,"This was a real disappointment.  I watched it as a Netflix rental and I'm very glad that I did not have to actually pay to see it.
The first problem is that the title clearly implies that it is about no limit hold'em (probably to benefit from the popularity of that variation).  The games played are all PLO and stud games.  I cannot believe that this was not done intentionally to be misleading.  As you get to know Susan, it certainly seems to be within her character.  If you are not thoroughly annoyed with her by the end of the movie ... I don't know what to say.  I also have to feel a little sorry for Tim (her partner) and have to wonder why he would put up with her.

On the positive side, the moments/interviews with the pros are nice, but they get too little screen time.  Also, this is a real slice of life film (and bad poker is part of the poker world).

The current price of $25 is way too high for something you are ultimately not going to want in your collection.",1300406400,3,980,4.170212765957447
8149213,1,B000J4P818,"Don't waste your time or money on this movie.  It is absolutely the most boring movie.  Out of 1 1/2 hours there was about a grand total of 10 minutes of actual poker playing and they don't even show the cards really, the camera is just focused on this lady Susan the whole time sitting in her chair complaining about how unlucky she is.  She is an absolutely terrible poker player, she did terrible in virtually every tournament she entered and than complained on camera for 15 minutes about how unlucky she was, how her seat was unlucky, how the sweater that was on the back of her chair was unlucky and blah.....blah......blah..... Just the worst poker movie.  Also the title would lead you to believe that she is going to be playing no-limit hold'em, but the only games she played were pot limit omaha(eight or better) and stud hi-lo.
I would have rather them just have a silent movie just showing 1 tournament from beginning to end. The interviews with the stars of the poker world were interesting but they don't give any tips or even really talk about how poker should be played or anything. Really they are just portrayed as degenerate gamblers, and just money grubbing sleezeballs. Which is sad because a lot of the guys that were interviewed do so much amazing charity work and donate so much money.  Barry Greenstein for example now donates %100 of his poker winnings to charity and there is no mention of it.
If your really passionate about poker I wouldn't bother with this.  For someone who isn't very familiar with poker and is just trying to get an idea about what the life of poker players is about than....maybe.....",1251417600,3,1634,4.617241379310345
8149214,2,B000J4P818,"This is a very disappointed Dvd. First of all, it is not about no limit hold em. If you want to watch a girl losing game after game with little little nuggets interviews with the great poker players mentioned. Well... She has such a bad attitude on top of it. The only lesson is that poker is not as easy as other dvd or books make it seems like.

Really not worth you money, there is a lot of better one, like Phil Gordon's dvd for example which is excellent.",1202342400,3,460,4.111111111111111
8149215,4,B000J4P818,"They depicted the real life of a poker player.  The ups and downs, and the highs and lows of a true gamler.",1188086400,,107,3.8636363636363638
8149216,2,B000J4P818,"Ok first off, starting a poker documentary with nothing but shots of your kids and how great your family is and then saying ""two single parents from opposite coasts"" probably isn't the best thing for a film about gambling.  I knew I was in trouble when this was the case.  In reality, they are two people whom used to be married to each other and are now working together.  You can obviously see why they are not together.  Both have different goals and outlooks on life.

Next, the poker content.  What poker content?  All we see is the main character whining about how ""cold"" she runs but how great she plays.  She relies so heavily on luck that I believe her to be completely dillusional about the games she's actually playing.  She doesn't play No Limit one time in the film, like the title would lead you to believe.  Every tournament is either Omaha 8 or Stud 8 and that is all.  The main character of the movie just got insanely annoying when every table draw was lucky or unlucky, a shirt...yes a friggin shirt on her chair was her excuse for losing despite being at a ""lucky"" table.  She gets seated at table 44 seat 3 and says...""oh 11, this is really lucky!"" only to bust after just a few hours and blame something for her bad luck and cold cards.  I mean, seriously.  Are you going to try to turn pro and play poker tournaments for a living and dangle your every decision or result on how lucky you are?

Third, there are a ton of inaccuracies in the film.  Just a few are stating the Harrahs owns the former Binion's Horseshoe on Freemont street, which is 100% incorrect.  They own the WSOP and MTR has owns Binion's since Becky sold it in 2004.  Harrahs only managed it for 6 months until MTR got their people properly trained.  Others included the text on the screen saying ""tournament 2 day 1"" when it was actually her third event.  There were no ""day 1"" or ""Day 2"" of any events.  Everything she played was a single day event.  Why call all the individual tourneys at one location as just one tournament when in fact they are not?

The only saving grace of this movie is some of the interviews with top pros.  There is a lot of insight as to what makes these guys tick but it always seems to be money and nothing but.  There are no talks of charity, family, life, just how much money they can get so that buying things means nothing to their overall bottom line.  Devil Fish talking about how he rides in limos and takes private jets, and others talking about the same things.  It pretty much paints the pros out to be nothing but money hungry people with nothing to offer society after they've been trying to change this image for years.

2/5 stars only because of the production quality and some of the insight into the way the pros think.",1182816000,11,2758,4.365422396856582
8149217,3,B000J4P818,"It presents a girl going thru different omaha tourneys, but no good poker content... it shows that it's hard to become a pro, but i don't like the way that the girl relays on luck, but you can feel so many times like the main character on this movie... it will not help you to improve your game.. but will tell you that u cant win all the time",1179014400,2,343,3.9855072463768115
8149218,1,B000J4P818,"I was quite excited this afternoon as I found this DVD in my mailbox and settled onto the couch to watch yet another film about one of my favorite topics.  Within fifteen minutes, I'd decided that the two filmmakers/documentarians were so appallingly annoying I had to stop watching.  I must have missed the best bits which were sure to follow.  In the off-chance that they read this--beginning a poker film with cloying, kid-hugging moments is almost always a bad play.",1176508800,5,470,4.85
8149219,4,B000J4P818,"You gotta feel for the filmmakers of this film. It's clearly a shoestring operation filming Susan's quest to win big money in poker tournaments to make more movies.

So the story is appealing: the quest against impossible odds, the ultimate triumph, the ... wait there is no triumph. It seems at first that Susan is a rather poor Omaha player or an unlucky one.  Later on, she redeems herself with better results.

Ir is worth seeing for the numerous famous player interview clips. To keep the story moving, all the players appear in mini video bites.

However, there are differences between what you see and what you get here.  No game that she plays is no limit as it is mostly Omaha, a pot limit game.  And while poker fans will be expecting, Texas Hold'em, it's missing. There's  just Omaha and stud, fine games, but not at the center of the poker frenzy.

I wish I could have seen a few of Susan's live cash game, as apparently she trounced the table.

This  is worth seeing for the sheer chutzpah of the entire enterprise.

P.S. I read reviews here and elsewhere online and this seemed like a must-buy, or rather a must-rent.  It's nowhere to be rented.",1175731200,6,1159,4.545893719806763
8149220,2,B000J4P818,"I looked forward to seeing this dvd, as I enjoy poker. Clearly, the best parts were the sound bites with the players. The main character, Susan, was a big letdown. We follow Susan and her estranged husband as she drags her child along while playing in several omaha and 7 card stud tournaments. Despite the title, none of these games are no limit!

 Unfortunately, her constant whines about bad beats quickly become tiresome. As an aside, it's hard to believe that she was actually married to the co-producer, as they seem so totally different in their attitudes and goals. This leads to my real point about this movie.

The movie is subtitled ""A Search for the American Dream"". Nearly every poker player describes the ""American Dream"" as some variation of having huge sums of money, such that buying material goods is never a concern. Is this really our dream? No one speaks of using the money for charity; to help the poor, or the sick. Very few even speak of helping their own family members! It seems that the only interest among these shallow poker players is to eat, drink and live like epicurion kings. Ultimately, I found this to be quite sad. Do any of these people care anything about someone other than me,me,me? I assume some do, but you wouldn't know from watching this video.

I find it quite disturbing that the only thing that Susan seems to feel is important in life is more and more money.",1170115200,10,1407,4.616
