4330128,3,B004CYF712,I was disappointed that there was no dancing. It was interesting to hear some of the background of the show.,1436918400,,108,4.45
4330129,1,B004CYF712,I did not enjoy the gossip and hardly any dance going on in the version that is more like a trash-talk show.,1431475200,,108,3.9545454545454546
4330130,5,B004CYF712,I love Dancing with the Stars and it was fun to watch them when they where interviewed when they were fairly new on TV.  Especially liked listening to Derek Hough.  He is my favorite pro on Dancing with the Stars,1431216000,,212,4.275

4330135,5,B004CYF712,"Always wanted to know what goes into making up your favorite dancing show?  Well, this group talk session does a pretty good job of giving you the inside scoop.

Fans of siblings Derek and Julianne Hough will especially like that they talk quite a bit in this group discussion.  Cheryl Burke is the other pro dancer and she doesn't have much to say.

This session was filmed in 2008 at the beginning of the sixth season and includes celebrities Christian de la Fuente who came in third,  Kristi Yamaguchi who won and Marissa Jane Winokur who came in fourth.  All of them are just beginning their competition so have that perspective on the show.  Kristi says very little but the other two participate a lot.  As also does Drew Lachey who won the second season.  Tom Bergeron and Samatha Harris participate (this was in the days before Brook Burke became cohost) and one of the producers of the show as well as judges Len Goodman and Bruno Tonioli.  I was surprised Len said so little and let Bruno mostly speak from the judges perspective.

There are no scandalous revealations here but I for one found it interesting to hear some of their thoughts and some of the facts I did not know.  They answered a question about the music that I have always wanted to know.  I wish it could have gone longer and touched on more questions I am curious about.

I think it is a good buy for anyone who is interested in the show and a must for Derek Hough fans.",1359158400,5,1447,4.431818181818182

8423912,5,B004CYF712,"even after years this discussion was amazing, maybe more so now. anyone who scored one or two stars obviously has no use for the show in any case. this was an honest discussion of what makes the show end of statement. it is as interesting today as it was then. seeing some of the pro's at the younger age was nice.. .",1452384000,,317,4.129032258064516
