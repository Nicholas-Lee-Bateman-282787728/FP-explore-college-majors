8189100,5,B000P5XYTO,"Teen Species - Boys reveals the priorities of five different teenage boys with radically different real world concerns and backgrounds.  There is nothing even remotely erotic about the film.

With the pressures that boys endure in modern times, the film attempts to track the major changes that each teen experiences over a two year period.  There are no clinical undertones and much of the film appears to be unscripted.

As a film project, the subject matter caters mainly to parents and those in the social sciences.  The film is intended to be educational and is not likely to entertain the merely curious.

I applaud the film's creators for addressing a topic that has virtually no companion resources - a subject that deserves much more exhaustive treatment.",1255996800,,764,5.023809523809524
