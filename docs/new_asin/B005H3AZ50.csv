4699052,5,B005H3AZ50,Fantastic film.  I am amased that a two hour film can be made from a three page story by Poe.  This was a great find a 21 minute 39 second film.  True to the story and a real find.  Casting was perfect and met what many of my college students had written down as description of characters as they read the story.  A great fins.  Hiughly recommend.  The lesson plan and student worksheet were nice but more appropriate for high school.,1354924800,,434,4.283950617283951
4699053,5,B005H3AZ50,"I have to say this is the best version of the Cask of Amontillado that I have so far seen! David Bielewicz, whom I also communicate with on Facebook, is a stunningly handsome Montressor and Frank Tirio Jr. is convincing as the drunken, haughty Fortunato! These are two actors who I am sure will make it to the top  with their acting careers in the future. I give this 10 stars all the way if possible on here! See it if you are a real Edgar Allan Poe fanatic and want to see two actors who don't disappoint!",1327276800,,507,4.173469387755102
4699054,5,B005H3AZ50,"This film is a must see for any Edgar Allan Poe fan.  After attending the film's premiere at Pittsburgh South Side Works Theatre, I knew I needed to add it to my personal collection.  A great adaptation of a classic Poe tale... I will definitely be passing this film along to my friend who teaches Poe in his high school lit course.  I could totally see this short film being used to supplement lesson plans.",1318982400,4,408,4.413333333333333
4699055,3,B005H3AZ50,"While the other reviewers were correct with the DVD being almost word for word directly from the short story.  I was disappointed with the casting of both Fortunato (David Bielewicz)and Montressor (Frank Tirio Jr.).  Neither actor was what I have pictured in my mind through all my readings of this short story.  I felt that Montressor failed to convey the unreliable narrator efficiently enough and Fortunato was just not drunk enough to be lured down into Montressor's vaults.  As for writer/ director Thad Ciechanowski, I was also disappointed with the filming of the carnival scene at the beginning.  It was poorly done on the set rather on location and only those actually familiar with the short story would be able to make the connection to festivities that Ciechanowski was trying to convey.  It actually reminded me of the Thames Shakespeare Collection of Romeo and Juliet that was also filmed on a set rather on location.  Instead of mentioning the vaults being ""encrusted with niter"" instead Cienchanowski focused on being below the water table.  My biggest disappointment was the replacement of the flambeaux with lanterns. There was no thursting ""a torch through the remaining aperture and let it fall within"". The entire DVD screamed final project for senior film student on a limited budget; meaning it is good but not quite good enough.  For the almost $30 price, I would skip buying this DVD and just let the story ride in the imaginations of your student's minds.",1318723200,,1481,4.987804878048781
4699056,5,B005H3AZ50,"After reading Poe's ""The Cask of Amontillado,"" I showed this film to my freshman English classes, and the students absolutely loved it. Everything about this short film adaptation is perfect: the acting, the costumes, the set designs, the music, and the screenplay (it's almost word for word Poe). What this film also captures--and what students really appreciate--is Poe's dark sense of humor. The scene where Montressor tries to out-scream Fortunato is funny and unforgettable--it's worth the price of the DVD alone. I'm always searching for current film versions of Poe's stories, and this is undoubtedly the best. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys Poe.",1316736000,13,663,5.384615384615385
4699057,5,B005H3AZ50,"Definitely the best rendition of the classic Edgar Allan Poe story I've ever seen. Everything seems to have been done right, the lighting, the sound, the music and the acting. All while maintaining all the essential literary devices Poe intended, irony, revenge, etc. Set during the time of EAP, it brought me back to reading the story for the first time.",1315958400,4,355,4.836065573770492
4699058,3,B005H3AZ50,This is one of the best versions available!,1427414400,,43,4.5
4699059,5,B005H3AZ50,"Great! If you teach this short story, this is a wonderful adaptation of the story and very true to the story.",1417910400,2,109,4.238095238095238
4699060,5,B005H3AZ50,"Very good.  This is an excellent classroom resource.  It follows the story very closely, except for two minor alterations, and brings the unreliable narrator alive for the students.  I have been showing it for a couple of years now, and each time I do, I appreciate it more and more.",1417132800,,283,4.62
4699061,5,B005H3AZ50,"I just finished showing this to my English 9 class, and they really enjoyed it.  I like the fact that the film follows the original story and the narration uses lines directly from Poe.  The setting and props were realistic, and I loved it when Montresor does his insane laugh.",1391558400,,277,4.52
4699062,5,B005H3AZ50,Great! I used it in my class. It was a good representation of Poe's story! It helped illustrate and it followed the text nearly word for word! I definitely recommend it for classroom use!,1386288000,,187,4.529411764705882
4699063,5,B005H3AZ50,"I've been teaching this story for 10 years, and this is the best movie-version of this story that you can find. There's a free video on YouTube that I showed for years, but I finally caved and bought this one. Definitely worth it! The acting is great. The kids LOVE drunk Fortunado, and Montresor is appropriately insane and sinister. It retells Poe's story accurately without being either hokey or gory. This is one that my students remember in following years and continue to talk about.",1383264000,4,489,4.764705882352941
4699064,4,B005H3AZ50,"The film follows Poe's story well, except for the inclusion of the son of the narrator, an inclusion both unnecessary and compromising.
The story as Poe wrote it has the narrator speaking directly to an unknown listener, so that the reader becomes that listener.  The film eliminates  this direct address.",1376784000,,305,5.08
4699065,4,B005H3AZ50,The students enjoyed this video because they could see what the author was saying.  The visual effects helped them to understand what it was like in that time period and how far a man was willing to go for revenge.,1368057600,2,214,4.35
4699066,3,B005H3AZ50,The Cask of Amontillado is a fine DVD. It is very suitable for classroom use. The actors did a fine job.,1364774400,,104,4.0
4699067,5,B005H3AZ50,"Perfect Acting to show to my class after reading Poe's short story. I would recommend this DVD to instructors, teachers or anyone who wants to spend 20 minutes watching The Cask of Amontillado. Great purchase.",1360368000,,209,5.0
8472619,5,B005H3AZ50,Too short,1521504000,,9,4.0
8472620,3,B005H3AZ50,"3.3 stars

Follows Poe's original story pretty much to a T, surprisingly.  They didn't overdramatize it with inappropriate language or violence or anything else.  Nor is there extra filler.  Loved the setting and tone -- creepy!  The acting is so-so.  Not bad.  But not great.  I read and watch all things Poe... I've seen much better (and worse) renditions of his work.  This is just okay. Runs about 21 minutes.",1520640000,,413,4.785714285714286
8472621,5,B005H3AZ50,Excellent!  Poe would be happy with this version.  I repeat: Excellent!,1516147200,,71,5.363636363636363
8472622,4,B005H3AZ50,The length of the story is perfect for a class period and is a good accompaniment to the text.,1515456000,,94,4.0
8472623,5,B005H3AZ50,I used this video as a review before an assesment in my Poe unit. Very cool:),1484524800,,77,3.875
8472624,4,B005H3AZ50,"I watched this with my high school English class.  The movie starts with Montresor confessing to his military son (not a part of the story, but okay as an addition to the movie).  Other than that, this followed the story fairly well.  The actor who portrayed Montresor was a little over the top, which means my students loved him.",1480032000,,330,4.559322033898305
8472625,5,B005H3AZ50,"This movie is the perfect companion for a lesson on foreshadowing.  As a teacher, I value Amazon's exceptionally large number of movies that go along with the high school curriculum!!",1479254400,2,183,5.1
8472626,5,B005H3AZ50,"I purchased this for my 9th grade English classroom and was very pleased. Unable to find what I wanted on youtube or other sites, I finally decided to take a chance and purchase this with my own money. I am very glad I did. I would order anything else by the same director. The acting was very good. David Bielewicz's interpretation of Montresor went beyond expectations; he was brilliant. This twenty minute video was exactly what we needed to enhance our instruction of Poe's short story. Highly recommend.",1477526400,,508,4.784090909090909
