2400252,5,B000B5IONE,"This series is wonderfully done, I can't put into words how wonderful this series is and how to word this review without giving anything away.  The characters deveolpment and struggles throughout the series makes the ending that much more memorable.  It is so worth buying.",1139011200,5,273,5.044444444444444
2400253,2,B000B5IONE,"I really don't mean to offend, but I can't understand how the reviewers before me gave this series '5 stars'. Are their standards really that low? In my opinion, '5 stars' should be reserved for the best of the best, not just another anime. Chrono Crusade has its moments, but it's far from great (or good, for that matter). Ultimately, it's just mediocre.

The first third of the series is, for the most part, sluggish and dull. The action scenes are bland, mostly consisting of still shots of monsters while seeing gunfire bursts around them. Although the artwork isn't bad, the animation is stiff and sometimes clumsy like my previous example suggests. There's alot of stills, and scenes with limited action, which shows laziness on studio GONZO's part. Action gets pretty old when you see the character shoot a gun with only the hand moving, while the rest of the body remains completely still, or when monsters get shot in the arm or leg and reacts as if it took one to the chest. Worst yet, when the female 'summoner' commands her Spirit Guardian to attack, the scene turns black and all you see is a blue line cut across the screen, signifying a sword slash. Very lame.

What saves Chrono Crusade from utter failure is the final few episodes. I won't ruin the story with spoilers. All I'll say is that the mundane, scattered plot in the first half finally materializes into something interesting. Although the events that take place don't quite make sense, it's still interesting nevertheless.

The secondary characters (a little girl apostle and a Jewel Summoner) never really feel important to the plot as they should have been. They end up as just being very predictable and very annoying. The little girl cries every chance she gets, while the Jewel Summoner is bitchy beyond tolerable. Also, what is up with maniacal villains these days? Is it just me, or do they completely lack the ability to come up with an evil scheme that resembles something well-structured?

Another point worth mentioning is that the comedy aspect comes off completely unfunny and painful to watch. I guess their idea of humor comes from a girl tripping, or an old man trying to peek under girls' skirts or requesting to feel them up. It wouldn't have been so bad to have it happen once...but repeatedly, after multiple episodes? Spare me.

Although the last few episodes were somewhat redeeming, Chrono Crusade, as a whole, is just mediocre. Want to see something better, but with a similar theme? Check out Hellsing. If the main protagonist, Rosette, interests you, look into Scrapped Princess. I honestly don't mean this as an insult, but unless you are a child or a newcomer to the anime world, you would want to pass on this series.",1137801600,10,2724,4.787234042553192
2400254,5,B000B5IONE,"Chrono Crusade is the best if not the greatest anime i've seen thus far. The storyline is great the introduction of the characters the plot of the story was not rushed it flowed smoothly and the animation is awesome. ADV Films have done a fantastic job in getting the right voice actors for the job. 24 Episodes loaded with comedy, action, romance its soo good it will bring a tear to your eye seriously. Even though i give this series high praise........i wish the ending wasn't so sad.......From episoeds 1-15 its all fun and you get to know the characters but through episodes 15-24 things get all serious dark and gloomy.

But um if ur a person that really gets into the anime and the development of the characters this will leave in crying in the end. But with the collection bundle it doesnt include any special features but to sum things up Chrono Crusade is a great series to add to anyone's collection",1137542400,6,910,4.548780487804878
2400255,5,B000B5IONE,"This is probably my favorite anime series, and I have seen quite a few. The animation is brilliant and the characters are endearing. On the surface, this series tells the story of a battle between God and the devil, and on God's side there's a demon, an exorcist and an apostle. The character development is wonderful and by the end of the series you feel like you know the characters like the back of your hand. I cannot praise this series enough and I hardly suggest you check it out. :)",1135468800,8,489,4.384615384615385
2400256,5,B000B5IONE,"I'm really surprised at some of the negative reviews surrounding this series.  My wife and I just finished the collection, and we were both blown away.  If you're at all into Catholic mysticism, exorcism, angels, and demons, all with a good helping of Japanese existentialism, you'll love this series.  If you want mechs, you're on the wrong page.  Chrono Crusade has its silly, humorous moments, but by the time you've gotten to the end, you'll find yourself moved, unsettled, and sad that it's over.  It's worth seeing, and the five-disc collection is an excellent value.",1130803200,33,573,4.989473684210527

2400261,5,B000B5IONE,The show itself is very good and definitely worth owning. The product in general was in perfect condition and it was obviously new. Would definitely recommend.,1401408000,,159,5.153846153846154

2400264,3,B000B5IONE,"I was very skeptical about his at first but I settled into it.
A loud mouthed obnoxious young Nun running around with a bound demon fighting the supernatural. At times Rosette is funny and at other times she is really obnoxious and hard to take, almost enticing me to turn it off. Chrono always felt a little underdeveloped but finally shines through about 3/4 of the way. Other than that the animation is fairly standard, nothing outstanding or different,just standard anime with big eyes and emotes that drag away from the story at times. Also, at every opportunity they find a reason to expose the females characters breasts to the legal limit. Which at most times is completely unnecessary and adds absolutely nothing to the story, need or effect of things but is simply gratuitous prepube porn.",1393977600,,799,4.839416058394161
2400265,5,B000B5IONE,I would recommend this series to anyone who is a fan of anime. This was a wonderful and enjoyable show to watch and add to my collection.,1393372800,,137,4.111111111111111
2400266,5,B000B5IONE,I'd borrowed this before in the past from somebody and enjoyed the story because it was so different from other shows I had seen. I like watching the Japanese track instead of the English dub so it's nice that they included that on the rerelease version (some of the rereleased anime's don't always have the Japanese version for some reason).  The DVD set is a slim pack so it doesn't take up much space but it has the nice box art and the DVD case holds each DVD nicely so they don't get scratched like many new cases. I'm glad I finally picked this up and it was so much fun to watch again!,1390435200,,592,4.192982456140351
2400267,5,B000B5IONE,Awesome video and very comedy with lots of action. The video was in great condition and looking forward doing more business in the future.,1390348800,,138,4.791666666666667

2400269,5,B000B5IONE,"Chrono Crusade is one of the saddest anime I've ever watched. It's basically centered around religion. My initial reaction was that the anime series was boring. The ending was very sad. Basically, all of the main characters died. I was so close to tears when the series ended. If you like action, romance, comedy, and anime that moves you to tears Chrono Crusade is the anime for you. I am pretty sure this anime will move you.",1389225600,,427,4.558441558441558

2400272,5,B000B5IONE,I'm not going to go in depth and summerize the whole DVD collection because that would be spoiling it for other people. Instead I'm going to talk about the prompt shipping and delivery. Seriously I got it before the estimated delivery date and that was really awesome. It was all in good condition if i had to nit pick on anything it would be the super cheap packaging. I wasn't super thrilled to pop out the disc from it's super cramped case only for the plastic middle part to break. other than that though I'm really pleased.,1376784000,,528,4.453608247422681
2400273,5,B000B5IONE,"I when i got this it worked fine and came exactly as they had described it in the description. Only thing of note is that it smelled as if it came from a smokers home, and that wasn't mention, but it still worked and didn't effect how it played.",1372377600,,245,4.020408163265306
2400274,5,B000B5IONE,"Awesome anime, i've seen it before and i just had to have it! i've never read the manga, just bit and pieces and i've heard its similar to the manga, of course it has its differences though. I've heard that the endings in the manga and anime are completely different. SPOILER ALERT: chrono and rosette die in the anime, in the manga, i believe only rosette dies. again this is just what i heard, nonetheless, its a great anime, truly well done, awesome comedic moments and i feel like it really captures the heart :)",1371254400,,516,4.442105263157894
2400275,2,B000B5IONE,"Watched the whole thing no matter how much it hurt. It had its moments which were good, and to see how they went with the whole apostle, and prophecies which tied into history somehow was interesting. Not even a spoiler you see it coming the third episode in. I only watched it all because I wanted to see how they died together.
The
ending
is
horrible.
Its also very preachy in the end. The whole show throws religion at you because it's the basis, but to preach to you in the end with what was basically a 20 minute sermon. No. Saving grace was the loli when she wasn't singing as it is most of the time.",1370390400,,606,4.188034188034188
2400276,5,B000B5IONE,It was totally Awesome! Its was funny at times and tragic. I will definitely say it was a good buy.,1370390400,,99,4.0

2400278,5,B000B5IONE,This is a great series. My friend loaned it to me and I liked it so much I bought it for myself. If you're an anime fan you should buy this. :),1353110400,,143,3.5
2400279,5,B000B5IONE,"I watched the series first, and then read the manga (It was so good I needed more). So I didn't experience the typical disappointment with changes from paper to screen and ended up loving both. The manga made me cry huge broken sobs (and still brings mist to my eyes when I evoke the final graphics), with a sense of a great and hard love story. The series made me cry a soft hopeful emotion embedded in peace, whith a sense of sacrifice and justice. Both stories are well told and developed, with excellent characters and very interesting relationship dramas. The religious thing is put as a means to tell the story, so I think it fits to any belief. The story is about love and redemption, the rest just carries it through.
A very recommended series for all those who don't hate Anime. And a small recommendation for those who plan to read the manga and watch the series: watch the series first and you'll get the best of both.",1352764800,,929,4.43859649122807
2400280,3,B000B5IONE,"Chrono Crusade isn't bad, but it's not great either. It has a lot in common with the newer Trinity Blood. Rosette and Chrono are. members of a religious organization that kills the demons plaguing America. There is a lot of action in this series and a bit of comic relief. The animation and voice acting in this series are both good. It's just doesn't have that something that makes an anime great. I like the ending. It was a good, and brought a few tears to my eyes. I think the series would have been better if it had built more on the relationship between the demon, Chrono, and the nun, Rosette. There are some people out there that really like this series, so you might wanna try it out. If so I would recommend renting it or watching it on youtube b4 you buy.",1350000000,,766,4.289655172413793
2400281,2,B000B5IONE,"if you want to see a good story about good vs evil with magic, demons, and comedy get try Devil May Cry, Inuyasha, ect. this story was gutted from the original manga and isn't worth watching to the end as it well disapoint you if you want to know the real story read the manga",1332460800,,276,4.036363636363636
2400282,5,B000B5IONE,I'm only about half way through watching the episodes but so far I'm enjoying them. Even though it doesn't follow the manga that well if at all in some parts. I still enjoy the series enough on its own.,1326067200,,202,4.205128205128205

2400286,5,B000B5IONE,"I must say, I was very surprised by this anime. If you like dark, demons/angels, tragedy types of anime, I would recommend a watch for you. If you have read and love the manga of this series, I would advise to stay away from the anime. This anime is definitely different from what I like to watch but I was stunned how moved I was by it. You can read from a dozen other reviews what it is about, and if you scroll up, you can read the plot. I am just here to say my opinions on the show. I have read the manga from beginning to end, I actually now own all the books, so I am a big fan of the manga, but I was pleasantly surprised by the anime.  Yes, it does take a completely different turn, and after 24 episodes, the anime is over. I do wish they would have stuck to the manga and made it 52 episodes or something longer because the anime basically stops not even half way through the manga, but I must say, I do enjoy the ending to the anime better to the manga. ***SPOILER*** In the manga, Chrno goes off and fights Aion, and we don't see him again for I believe 7 or 8 years. Rosette is dying and waiting to see her beloved one last time. She sees him, and dies. That is how the manga ends, you never really know if Chrno lives on, or some say that Rosette saw his ghost in the church and she joins him in heaven, Im not sure. In the anime, Rosette unseals Chrno so he can fight with Aion, the fight is about a min long, and boom, Chrno wins and takes Rosette somewhere for a number of months, and Rosette dies because her time is up, and Chrno dies with her because he is so badly injuried he cant recover. So while the anime is much shorter, and the supposely epic fight between Chrno and Aion you have been waiting for is very short, I loved knowing that Chrno and Rosette died together, but that is me being a hopeless romantic.
So all in all, after that long review, I would recommend this to anyone who isn't in absolute love with the manga, which is very hard not to love, and likes a anime that has tragedy, love, some comedy, and is over all alittle dark.",1309824000,5,2069,4.058679706601467
2400287,5,B000B5IONE,"Enjoyed the series when it was on SYFy...I can enjoy it without interruption and follow it better...It raises a lot of questions about religion and idealogy, and it is entertaining, and true animae! Thanks...",1308873600,,208,5.147058823529412
2400288,5,B000B5IONE,"The scene is Brooklyn during the 1920's and the city is periodically plagued by devils summoned by Satan worshipers. When this happens, it is up to the Magdalene Order to banish the devils and restore peace. Rosette Christopher is an exorcist of the Order's, and with her controversial partner, Chrono, she destroys devils with flare... lots of flare and the destruction of whole city blocks.

Chrono Crusade is a surprisingly deep anime. It starts out with a devil-a-day feel, but quickly moves on to an actual plot. The first half is mostly action and and comedy punctuated with drama. The second half is where this series really shines by getting much darker and more tragic. The story has several background stories that really flesh out the main storyline and add complexity and realism as well. The characters themselves are never very complex, but they are likable and not too stereotypical.

A short warning for those who might take offense: there is a perverted old man employed by the Order whom often looks up the Sister's skirts. Also, this story is both flattering and damming of the Christian religion. Most of the bad things said about God and Christianity are said by the bad guys, but it is insinuated that even some of the good guys are of the same, or a similar, opinion by the end.

I've watched Chrono Crusade twice now and I was even more impressed with it the second time I watched it. The production value seems quiet good, the voice actors all did an excellent job, and the soundtracks one the best I've ever heard. One warning though: Rosette's English voice actor is completely intolerable. Watch it in Japanese, your ears will thank you.

Chrono Crusade is probably the best Christian influenced anime I've ever seen and one of my favorite anime overall (I've seen lots of anime). It isn't for everyone, with the heavy religious overtone and the darkness of the later half, but for those of you who don't mind such things it can be a very enjoyable series. And finally at a low price in a nice compact form!

I've also read the manga and found that this is one of those very rare instances where the anime and manga diverge yet both are equally good. If you enjoy the anime, try giving the manga a shot as well.",1297641600,14,2239,4.643939393939394
2400289,5,B000B5IONE,"I WATCHED THIS SERIES MANY YEARS AGO, AND WHILE THE MANGA AND ANIME DIVERGE AT A CERATIN PLOT POINT, BOTH ARE GOOD TO ENJOY.  BUT A WORD OF WARNING, THIS SERIES IS NOT FOR EVERYONE.  WHILE STARTING OFF LIGHT AND HUMOROUS IT TURNS DARKER AFTER A WHILE AND THEN EVEN MORE SO, ALSO IF YOU ARE HIGHLY RELIGOUS YOU MAY NOT ENJOY THIS SERIES FOR WHILE A WORK OF FICTION A LOT OF ACUTAL RELIGOUS IDEALOGY IS PUT INTO IT.

IT IS THE ROARING 20'S (JUST BEFORE THE DEPRESSION), AND THE RICH HAVE FOUND A NEW HOBBY - SUMMONING DEVILS.  NOW MOSTLY IT IS ALL SHOW, BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN SOEMTHING HAPPENS AND THE ORDER OF MADELINE SENDS ITS BEST EXORCISTS TO CONTAIN THE SITUATION....AND IF THEY ARE NOT AVAILABLE THEY SEND SISTER ROSETTE AND CHRONO.

2400290,3,B000B5IONE,"**********SPOILER ALERT*********
(Read at your own discretion):
I found this series while browsing on Youtube.  I watched a few episodes online and found it funny, nuns with guns hunting down demons.  I searched online and  bought the DVD and the manga.  They start off very funny and I enjoy the first few episodes but it soon turns deadly serious.  While both the manga and anime start out the same their endings are quite different.  While the manga's ending could best be described as bittersweet the anime's ending is downright depressing.  After watching it I felt like I just left my best friend's funeral.

The main difference is that the anime seems to get confused on who the bad guys and good guys are.  Aion and the demons make God sound like a prick who just doesn't care about the suffering of his people and the way Rosette and the church act they don't really seem to prove Aion wrong.  Maybe their trying to cater to the die hard church goer who never questions the teachings of the church, but since I'm not a very religious man that person isn't me.  (My apologies if I've offended anyone, I assure you that wasn't my intention) Watching the later episodes I really couldn't tell who I was supposed to root for.

Then the ending just makes it worse.  After the villain is defeated our heroes die, we fast forward years in the future and see the villain still alive.  So everything Rosette and Chrono fought, suffered and died for was all for nothing.  Call me old fashioned or a sellout but I like a happy ending.  I have nothing against deep philosophical topics (I like stories with that more than insubstantial fluff) but still I don't want to walk away from a show feeling like I've been to a funeral.

I'm not going to encourage or discourage you to buy this, that's for you to decide but I will state that, in my opinion, the manga is definitely better than the anime.",1268006400,2,1893,4.536873156342183
2400291,5,B000B5IONE,"Yes, this has nuns with guns among others.  I really enjoyed this anime.  I had watched the first half originally in Japanese with English subtitles and I wanted to see the rest but had to post pone that for later.  I admit I was a bit depressed at the end, but it has its funny moments for being very dark at times.  While most of this is fictional there are some facts incorporated with the time line which makes a little more believable.  I did watch some of the commentary with the English voice actors and the translators did a heck of a job trying to be accurate to the script but at the same time being accurate to the time period by using the language and terms most often spoken then.  While some of my friends are bit a hesitant to watch the anime due to its cliches' try to look past that fact and give Chrono Crusade a chance.",1263772800,,838,4.173913043478261
2400292,5,B000B5IONE,"Well a brief summary of Chrono Crusade is thT it is the 1920's and along with all the prosperity of the time immorality comes along with it and satanism is on the rise. Their is a special task force for this job, the Magdalen Order, who are are a trained group of exorcist that operate under the Catholic Church. The main characters are Sister Rosette, a little bit clumsy elite exorcist, with her soul bound demon, Chrono, and a girl Azmaria. They travel around and fight and vanquish these demons and evil creatures all while they are searching for Rosette's brother Joshua.

This is a pretty good show although it takes a little while to get started and explain itself, but definitely worth watching. *****",1258243200,,709,4.672
2400293,5,B000B5IONE,"Not nearly as good as the manga. Thanks to their loss of funding, Ayres and Carsrud rushed through the middle and end of the anime, losing sight of the manga's story. Despite adoring the manga and its story, I also enjoyed this anime and its story. If you're picky about what animes you watch, give this one a shot. I am very picky, and this one touched me in a way most animes have never done. I wish there was more of this brilliant series.",1250726400,,442,4.211764705882353
2400294,3,B000B5IONE,"The Chrono Crusade Complete Collection is a five-disc set that contains all twenty-four episodes of the series.  There the first four discs have six episodes each, with extras included on the first, second, and fourth discs.  The fifth disc in the set only contains extras.  I was disappointed by the packaging of this set.  When you open the box, you find that all five discs are stacked one on top of the other on one hub.  Also, there is no booklet or insert included in the box, so you don't know what episodes are on what discs unless you put the discs into a DVD player.

The extras on the first disc include the original on-air openings for the first five episodes, as well as commentary on episode one by the American voice actors for Rosette and Chrono.  The only difference between the five on-air openings is about ten seconds of footage in the middle; otherwise, it's the exact same opening.  Because the difference is so slight, it made this feature rather boring to watch.  The only extra on the second disc is commentary provided by the American voice actor for Joshua and ADR Director Matt Greenfield.  The fourth disc contains the unused on-air openings for the final four episodes.  These unused on-air openings are exactly like the openings on the first disc, but with different footage during the ten seconds in the middle.

The fifth disc contains several bonus features.  First is ""Azmaria's Extra Classes.""  These are a series of eleven three-four minute pieces that explain various aspects of Chrono Crusade.  The topics covered in this section include: America in the 1920's, the Magdalene Order, weapons used by the Magdalene Order, the Apostles, the beasts Satella summons, the devil worshippers, ""the Sinners,"" the pursuers and the Believers, stigmata, the ritual of Atonement, and the Head of Pandemonium.  Next, is the clean opening and clean close (which are the opening and ending credits without the credit text).

The ""Chrono Crusade Chronicle"" is a feature that is designed to look like a newspaper.  This is divided into four sections: ""Famous People Sighted,"" ""Mysterious Creatures Discovered,"" ""Mechanical Curiosities,"" and ""Chrono Crusade Slang."" All of these contain various pieces of information, and is done in a slideshow format (the only exception to this is ""Chrono Crusade Slang,"" which is a list of slang words from 1928 that the viewer can page through).  Outside of ""Chrono Crusade Slang,"" the viewer has no control over when the screen changes to the next page of information.

Next is ""Production Sketches.""  This feature is not done in a way that the viewer can go through at their own pace.  Instead, it is done as a 36-minute long video file.  The disc also includes ADV Previews and DVD credits.

While I was disappointed in the packaging of this set, and wish some of the special features had been done differently, this is a good set to own if you are a fan of Chrono Crusade.",1246924800,11,2933,4.855130784708249
2400295,5,B000B5IONE,"This is a great anime.  Religious viewers may find this a bit of a stretch. I too am religious and I just took the story for what it was. It is a story of true love between a devil (Chrono) and a human (Rosette) and their search for her brother (Joshua). In the end I believe the devil and human end up discovering that nothing matters accept how they feel about one another.
I will not take the time to go into the full details of this story; there are other reviews that let you know what this anime is all about. I definitely recommend this anime to anyone that loves a fun in your face kind of anime. Just a warning, you will definitely shed a tear toward the end of this anime.

I bought all the books, while I was deployed to Iraq, and I bought one DVD to see if I would like the show.  After that, I couldn't stop buying it, until I owned the whole set.  This box set is wonderful, I own it.  It's good art work, of course you lose the extras, but I never really watch them anyway, so no big deal.  The story is awesome, and the action is really good.

It was sad and the fight scenes are awesome as well, if your not into sad romance scenes or anything that deals with any type of serious emotions don't get it, its not for you.

The nun sold her soul to the demon to allow him to live and fight for her. She sold her soul to him as long as he promised to help her kill the person who kidnapped her brother.

Her brother has a magical power to heal people, A great demopn named Aion came out and gave the boy the horns of a demon. They made him go crazy and turn everyone in the orphanage into stone. Shortly after Aion took her brother josh away.

The nun is a a giant goof. She is always messing up, but everyone but her boss knows she is trying her best and she will do anything to save her brother and distroy Aion. Along their journey they befriend a witch who is looking for the person who killed her village and kidnapped her sister, and a songstress who can heal anyone with her songs.

They each have to over come their fears and weakness.

It is a really cute and sad series. Most people cry at the end of the series. Everyone loves the series, it's cute, actiony and sad.

2400303,3,B000B5IONE,"Chrono Crusade has too many episodes that don't contribute much towards the storyline. The premise of the series, although intriguing, is bogged down by weak character performances.

2400304,5,B000B5IONE,"This series takes place in the roaring twenties and tries to stay true to the figures of speech and meaning of words back then (which adds depth to the series). The main characters are part of a religious order that eradicates devils and such usually using specially designed bullets. The two main characters are Rosette and Chrono (pronounced ""crow-no""). Rosette is independent, impulsive, has a tendency to be a bit too destructive. And oh what a temper she has! Chrono is her partner and a devil, but he's in a docile state and looks more like a kid (which is explained later on in the series).

The series starts off more episodic based and focused more on humor but becomes more serious closer to the end. The animation is great, the voice acting in the English dub is really well done, and the ending credits song is one of the best out there. There are a lot of religious references but they feel more like a backdrop used for the setting.

The series would be in the 4 to 4.5 star range but there is a scene in the final episode that is so well done that it elevates the entire series up to five star status. It's the scene where we learn what happens to Chrono and Rosette and it is a very moving scene -- expect to shed some tears, if not several. It is masterfully done, rising to the level of sheer perfection. I don't want to completely spoil it but it's not a tragic ending -- rather it is actually a bit romantic. Buy the series and find out for yourself!",1189728000,,1470,4.341818181818182
2400305,5,B000B5IONE,"Chrono Crusade is about 16 year old Rosette Christopher, a member of the holy order of Magdaline. Their job is to exterminate devils that have been unleashed and ironically, Rosette is contracted with the good-willed devil Chrono. Together, they travel about sending the devils back and gain acouple friends along the way.

  Character design was excellent I thought in the series. They show true anime style with long hair, big eyes, and etc. I also like the fact that, as you will see in the show, that the characters all come from different countries. It could just be me but I like it when designers and writers go outside the box of Japanese lineage (no offence intended) and apply different nationalities to their works of anime.

  The storyline itself is good, but if you are hardcore religious (and I'm not saying that is a bad thing) then you might find it a bit controversal, but please keep in mind it is an anime. The story also does an excellent job of applying history to the prophesies, of which is up to you to decide if they are true or not. Due to my attempt to keep this review unbiased, I will not disclose my views reguarding the topic. The story also does an excellent job of adding a mixture of seriousness and laughter at a nice pace. For instance, I was watching the beginning and was laughing quite a bit, and then an episode or two later it got serious allowing me to understand what was going on in the story, then an episode or two later the laughter returned and I continued to enjoy it. I will say this and please understand this clearly, this is not the case with the 5th Gospel (Chapters 21-24) this Gospel is serious to the end, and I do not mean that lightly.

  As for feelings, I really, I mean THOROUGHLY enjoyed the Gospels 1-4 (Chapters 1-20) in that I felt like I was having fun, yet, understanding the entire series. I myself was hit with a ton of bricks though when I watched Gospel 5 (Chapters 21-24). I'm an 18 year old guy and I found tears coming to my eyes. I have just finished watching the series and I still have this feeling even as I write this. Gospel 5...It was like I said in the title...sometimes laughter comes with tears...I sit here and think about the very last episode (Chapter 24) and my eyes begin to water. If you have a soft heart like mine, I recogmend you seriously think about getting this series. I haven't cried in years and here I am tearing up over an anime, no joke folks, I mean it, if you have a soft heart, please make sure you are ready for the end.

  I suggest going by the ratings of the board if you are debating on getting it as a gift for someone based on age. No nudity is shown and the language is for the majority clean, although there are some undergarment shots and SOME sexual references. In all, I CAN NOT stress enough the emotional stability you have to have in order not to feel the way I did at the end of the series. I repeat, if you have a soft heart, please...please consider the possibilities at the end.",1183507200,3,3004,4.354203935599284
2400306,5,B000B5IONE,"Chrono Crusade is an action/comedy anime with religious undertones.

Sister Rosette is a gun-slinging, psychotic-driving, demon-destroying nun working a for a psuedo-religious Magalene Order. I mean how many orders do you know of that engage in destroying demons with special guns loaded with blessed bullets?

Sister Rossette is constantly crashing and destorying her car because she's a maniacle driver, she can act cookie most of the times while acting mischivious and always hyper active, but when she gets down to business and whips out dual pistols, she puts on a more serious face and starts blasting demons away regardless of the odds. She is funny, psychotic and sweet all rolled up into one. She lets her little friend named, Chrono tag along with her on those demon busting missions and most of the times they get along like silly siblings. But Rossette and Chrono are linked to each other in a special way adding additional twists to an already twisted anime.

Chrono is a young boy, seemingly shy and very mellow, but trapped inside that little boy's body is a devil which can only be unleashed by Rossettes pendant. Possessing demonic powers and appearance, Chrono actually fights for the side of good giving against other demons him that anti-hero dynamic. Even though, Chrono is loyal to Rossette, the longer he remains free, the easier he becomes more evil and uncontrolled.

Some people might get offended by this anime's religious undertones and references to the bible. But everything is subdued and the Chrono Crusade series overall is not very preachy. Most of the tone is action with some comedy and a bit of horror.

The dvd extras include anime previews and little cartoon skits explaining some of the story lines and characters, which in itself was fun to watch.

The musical score is excellent and moody, the animation is fluid, the action sequences are kinetic and intense, the sound effects and voice acting are also very good!

In conclusion, I highly recommend that you buy the Chrono Crusade series as it rightfully belongs with your best anime collection.

***If you enjoyed Chrono Crusade, I also recommend the animes series called Excel Saga.",1180569600,4,2177,5.011080332409972
2400307,5,B000B5IONE,"The message is clear... Appreciate the life you have because just like this anime it will be over way to soon...

This starts off really loud and obnoxious (Like the main character of Excel Saga). But very quickly you realize that is not at all what this is about.

You witness a sort of anti-racist commentary built into a fantastically well conceived story. The main character and her partner are not meant to be together the way Romeo and Juliet weren't (Just not in the stars), they occupy to different sides of the ""railroad track"" like beauty and the beast.

In the end ... well I won't ruin it... let us just say it is quite satisfying but leaves one with a bitter-sweet aftertaste.",1178496000,,689,4.540322580645161

2400309,5,B000B5IONE,"Chrono Crusade is one of those rare anime that is just outside of the traditional mold. It's story focuses entirely on Christian mythology, which is for the most part obscure and foreign to the Japanese people. But is what sets it's apart from other anime of it's time, or anytime for that matter. This series occupies a special place in my collection, and  should be added to your collection as well! This is the story of a boy and a girl who lived long ago, and whose lives defined the course of a single moment...

  The Magdalene Order is a non-denominational (meaning not belonging to any particular faith) group of people whose sole objective is the eradication of demons, and all other forms of otherworldly creatures. It is in the New York branch of the Order that this story unfolds, with the men and women who work to rid this world of evil and it's many forms. Rosette Christopher an exorcist of the Order, and her demon partner Chrono ""The Sinner"", have spent the last four years serching for Rosette's younger brother Joshua. Joshua was taken by a demon, ""The Sinner"" Aion, who needs his powers for an unknown purpose. Unable at the time to stop what was happeninig, Rosette makes a contract with Chrono, a contract that will eventually consume her life! Knowing full-well the outcome, Rosette and Chrono set out on a journey to take back Joshua and their lost time, well that was the plan anyway! After years of searching, they meet a young girl who also happens to be an Apostle like Joshua. FYI, the Apostles are people bestowed with powers by God in the form of the Seven Virtues. And like Joshua who could heal others but not himself, Azmaria Hendric can heal peoples wounds and hearts with her voice, but seems to only bring missfountune to those around her. Next Rosette , Chrono, and Azmaria meet another young women with ties to Aion,her name is Satella Harvenheit, a jewel witch/summoner. He killed her family and destroyed thier home,then abducted her older sister, leaving Satella all alone in the world. When the fact that the person they are all serching for is the same one, they band togehter to end this nightmare. But when Rosette and Chrono finally catch up to Aion and Joshua, it is revealed that Rosette was Aion's real target all along, not Joshua or the other Apostles. Rosette becomes Aion's tool to re-write the ending to the Apocalypse by making Heaven into Earth, and Earth into Heaven, and by taking God's position as his own! So is this the end....not quite, but you'll have to buy it and see for yourself!!!

  Another classic anime to add to your collections immediately,the story , the characters, everything is top notch. This is another of Gonzo's masterpieces through and through, animation , character designs, etc. This is the pinnacle of animation and a testament to the human spirit. This is what got me into anime and keeps me here, this is what it's all about!!!

  This is one of those stories that haunts you for along time after it's finished, I still find myself crying at the ending everytime I watch it. ""This is the story of a boy and a girl who lived along time ago, and whose lives not only defined the course of a single moment, but brightened an era filled with the darkness of night."" This is the story of Rosette and Chrono; ""Chrono Crusade""!!!",1172448000,3,3311,4.644444444444445

2400311,5,B000B5IONE,"The over all story is good fighting against evil.

I like that concept but the way its don't is, they mix truth with fiction to a large degree.

There are some vary weird things in this cartoon that you might want too know.

There is a demon called (Chrono) that fights against evil. Well its not a demon if its fighting against evil.

Call it a (weird looking powerful being) or whatever but evil fights against good. Evil will never fight on the side of good, that is why its called evil.

So although they call Chrono a demon, in his heart he is loving.

Demons are not loving. Call him a scary looking angel would be more of the correct term for him. If Chrono were fighting against good then  you could call him a demon.

Demons don't love, this guy loves therefore he is not a demon.

So keep in mind when they call Chrono a demon hes not really a demon. In my book he is a (weird looking powerful being) , so powerful that some would call him a demon but you can never escape the fact that he is a loving person who is fighting on the side of good.

So another words it's a story about a group of nuns that exercise demons. One of the nuns meet a powerful being called Chrono. Chrono calls himself a demon because that is how some perceive him. Really he is a (weird looking powerful being).  He was sent to hardies to judge the other demons and somehow got stuck there. He got out and now he helps the nuns fight off demons. The nuns only see him as a demon but its quite obvious that a demon would never fight on the side of good (for any reason).

This is how I see the cartoon. The makers of the cartoon say he is really a demon but that is too illogical, so assuming he is a (weird looking powerful being)  sent too hadies to judge the demons is a more logical conclusion. You may want too fast forward past some of the fighting scenes, they can get really boring and unnecessary. Some parts are really loud and its hard to hear what there saying. Over all its all a matter of perception. What is happening in the cartoon is all your perception of how it is. Never let the story control your perception and your imagination. You control the story through your perception and your imagination. That's what makes the story interesting. I don't see a demon fighting for good I see a supper powerful angel fighting for good. Its illogical to assume a demon is fighting for good so assuming the logical conclusion makes things make more sense.

My conclusion.

The music is so loud in some parts its heard to hear the voices.

The story is vary interesting.

You make the call of what Chrono is.

Its waaaaa to expensive. I Got Ruin soldier for waaa less and like it much more.

Its interesting entertainment but its fiction. Just remember the Jesus is the way.

 God bless.",1168560000,,2781,4.279158699808796
2400312,4,B000B5IONE,"This series would be a 5 star from me, I love it, but the box set seems to be missing the additional 2-3 minute video clips called 'Azmaria's Extra Classes' that were included in the non-box set series. As such, I rate the box set as 4 stars (if you buy the individual discs, that is a solid 5 stars). Azmaria's Extra Classes show clips of the series and explain what happens in the series and how it relates to the christian belief system. They offer a lot of background information (in a short amount of time) and help you understand what is being talked about in the episodes. Without these little classes, you can still enjoy the series, but with space remaining on disc 5 of 5 the publisher could have easily included the little clips.

It does take a while to get started though. I didn't really get hooked until about the 7th or 8th episode. What's neat about this series is it is something that parents can watch with teens who might be into anime and not be bored or embarrassed by it but actually get something from it. Without coming out and saying it, this anime actually has a message to it.",1146873600,,662,4.346774193548387
2400315,3,B000B5IONE,"Just to get this started, nearly every anime that's from Gonzo Digimation, tends to have a poor paced start.  Chrono Crusade shares this same problem.  The animation itself seems lacking.  The use of dark color tones just doesn't seem to mix well.  Few of the action scenes are interesting, when the sisters or devils aren't still images.  Aside from those lacking moments in animation.  The other half of the animation to me is refreshing and is smooth.  Generally these moments include the times when the cast isn't fighting evil.

The comedy in the series is not very different from some other anime series.  It's using borrowed comedy in a sense.  The Elder's antics could be reminiscent of Master Roshi from Dragonball Z, funny at first, but tiresome after frequent uses.  Then there's the corny remarks that's in the english language translation, it's not really that bad when you take it into context.  The anime is set in 1920s, it'd sound corny to those who aren't as mature, and it could still sound corny to those mature.  It's relatively close to what comedic remarks were in that day and age.  The dub job is adequate, as some of the lines seem a little forced yet others flow smoothly with eachother.  Hilary Haag is an appropriate voice for main character, Rosette Christopher.

The mix of mythologies is rather interesting.  Catholocism, the occult, as well as some eastern beliefs.  Mix it together in the cauldren that is Chrono Crusade, and it makes a nice little take on something that can be seen as mundane and overused in some of today's horror flicks.  Making the series revolve around said mythologies/religions proves some difficulty as it could turn predictable.  Chrono Crusade has it's moments in this, as each episode tends to be in a sort of format of The Devil Of The Day vs. Magdaline Order/Rosette.  Yet it still has it's moments where there are unexpected well-threaded plot twists.

Yet one of the things that I like quite a bit on this anime as well as few others.  Is that this takes place in 1920s North America, so in a sense, you could get a feel on what the creator thought of americans during that age.

Being limited in using only five stars, I gave it a three (would have given around 3-3.5) based on what I have stated in this review.  It certainly isn't the best that's out there, and for those who say that this is a terrible anime, may I point you to an anime such as Knight Hunters, then compare.",1146528000,7,2446,4.645687645687645
2400316,5,B000B5IONE,"In an initial review I wrote for the first volume of this series, I presented Chrono Crusade as no more than an action-oriented comedy that dealt lightheartedly with some rather controversial stuff. While I believe that was okay for the time, I've since learned, in watching the entire anime, otherwise. Yes, this series will make you laugh, especially at the antics of the two main characters. And about half of the of the twenty-four episodes are light-hearted, while the others are surely dark. Of those twelve more serious episodes, the last four or five are as as heart-wrenching as Aztec sacrifices. But, so as not to confuse, the constant contrasting emotions have no effect on the anime itself. The happy-go-lucky stuff happens early on, mainly to introduce the characters or the settings, or whatever, and the darker stuff comes later, during the main story line.

The story itself follows Sister Rosette Christopher, a spunky girl great at destroying things, and her trusted partner-in-mischief Chrono, a peaceful, child-like devil. Both of them work for the Order of the Magdalene, a fearless group of exorcists and devil-slayers. Early on in the series, Rosette and Chrono are sent on a collection of unrelated missions, either to destroy threats from devils or to save those in danger. In one of these missions, they meet Azmaria, a girl with a tremendous power to heal, yet a power she's unable to control. They take her under their wing. Soon after, the real story begins. Chrono and Rosette's histories are revealed, and the two main enemies, Aion and Joshua, Rosette's brother, begin their quest to start the apocalypse. This ignites a war between man-kind and devil-kind, and though the sides are sometimes blurred between the two, it's clear that the final outcome wanted by Aion is one that may be inevitable. Still, help for the good-guys comes from odd places, including a pagan jewel-witch who has the power to materialize creatures from gemstones, and a horde of devil/hell-police, who want to keep the order in place, the way God had intended.

By the end, I, personally, was floored. Not only did I like the idea of devils with morals, but I enjoyed the fact that Chrono Crusade was fearless in its attempt to present a great story, controversy or not. It uses stories from the Bible, as well as religious mysticism, and mixes things that would be considered sacrilegious in our society, such as the love between a human girl and a devil. Even with that controversy, though, the message of this series is deep, and one that tells the story of human history and how many mistakes we have made over the years.

And of course, there is the actual climax of Chrono Crusade, which I will admit brought more than just one tear to my eye.

Chrono Crusade ranks close beside Last Exile as one of GONZO's greatest anime. The story ranges from moronic to dead serious, and pulls this off well by presenting a message and a theme, something that's uncommon in anime meant for laughs. The ideas in this story, though rich with controversy (if anime were as mass marketed as Harry Potter, this would be a series in the burning pits), are unique for an anime, and the ending is one of the best I've seen, especially when you consider the history of anime endings. I recommend this box set to anyone who wants to see something unique and worth multiple viewing, because that's exactly what Chrono Crusade is.",1140739200,38,3419,4.819420783645656
