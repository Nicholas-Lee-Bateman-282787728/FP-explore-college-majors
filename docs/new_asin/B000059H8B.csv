1404663,5,B000059H8B,"The Opera Australia production of The Gondoliers, surpasses any other procduction.
The cast is superb, the singing strong and in perfect pitch.
The costumes lavish.
Orchestral playing first rate.
I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone, especially those who are now discovering Gilbert and Sullivan for the first time.
There is an abundance of thoroughly singable/danceable music
that is both thrilling to listen to and to watch.
I have lived G&S for over 40 years, and this production leaves me breathless.",1025654400,7,511,5.2439024390243905
1404664,2,B000059H8B,"This is the same production of The Gondoliers that was played at the Stratford Festival in Canada.  It is unfortunate that they have wasted an excellent cast.  Visually, it is a very good work.  I am not a total purist who objects to any alteration in the libretto but this is carried to extremes and not with any real style or grace.  The aria ""Rising early in the Morning"" for example is totally butchered.  It is altered from a very funny song showing the two kings are not quite up to the job of kingship to a mish-mash of topical references which distract from the story and the story does need that particular song.
The people act well, dance less well than the Stratford Festival people did, and generally do the best that they can with the distractedly altered material.  The soprano comes on weakly, as if she is either slightly sick or hasn't warmed up enough, but gains in strength and goes on to do an excellent job.  I'll forgive much of a live production.  She is also a rarity in that she can sing and also act.  Her acting when she is remembering past embraces is hilarious and definitely would have met with Gilbert's approval.
It is unfortunate that I can't give this a higher rating, the people are good, the staging is easily acceptable, and the singers do a good job in general but the audio isn't up to snuff.
If you purchase this DVD and this is your first introduction to The Gondoliers , please don't thing that you are watching The Real Gondoliers as envisioned by Gilbert.",1011484800,9,1499,4.481617647058823
1404665,2,B000059H8B,"This DVD has ABSOLUTELY AWFUL SOUND!  Products like this should not be put on the market.  As this was my introduction to THE GONDOLIERS (a bad mistake, I found out later, as the majority of the songs had been re-written), so it was quite irritating when I had NO IDEA what was being said, due to an operatic chorus that over vocalises and throws away the consenants, and the fact the the whole thing sounds like it was recorded in a tin can.
From getting to know the show later, this visually seems to be a good production, everyone looks their part (particularly the two *extremely* dashing gondolieri), and I have no quibbles with a man doing the Duchess of Plaza-Torro--BUT I STILL HAVEN'T WATCHED THIS ALL THE WAY TRHOUGH BECAUSE OF THE AWFUL, AWFUL SOUND!
AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",996105600,13,781,4.571428571428571
1404666,1,B000059H8B,"If you want to see a very good version of ""The Gondoliers,"" try the version distributed by Opera World in VHS. This version was very poorly miked and virtually incomprehensible. The added scenes added nothing interesting. The choreography and production values were poor. I was very disapointed as this play is my favorite by Gilbert and Sullivan.",991872000,9,347,5.105263157894737
1404667,3,B000059H8B,"Here is a great opportunity wasted.  A great cast, excellent choreography, fine costumes and scenery, and a director who has to have ""addtional material"" added to the dialogue and lyrics to get a few cheap laughs.
It is bad enough when the characters on stage show they are aware they are in a play; but unforgivable when the added lines make references to things and persons that existed after Gilbert's day. Yes, I know that Ko-Ko's Little List song was updated with Gilbert's okay. And so was a single reference in ""Patience"" to reflect the rising price of ominibus fares in London. But the reference to Princess Di in Act I and the tasteless reference to condoms in Act II is the linguistic equivalent of a recent ""Ballo in Maschera"" which opened to reveal the male chorus sitting on toilets. But at least the libretto was not tampered with.
Why do directors not trust Gilbert to deliver the laughs? Why do any G&S to begin with if that is the director's attitude? In Stratford, Ontario, an ""Iolanthe"" was given with practically every lyric plagued with changes (and even Sullivan's music here and there). But the most that could be said is that the changes were not offensive.
  Now before I get all sorts of ""not helpfuls"" from people who feel that G&S needs some pepping up, let me say this. Granted that G&S is not Holy Writ--although to many it is--but when one pays good money for a Gilbert & Sullivan performance, one reasonably expects to find in the bottle what the label promises. (Ditto for most Shakespeare productions also.)
I will never play this DVD again unless to show how G&S should not be done. Those who think as I do, be warned.",987552000,38,1653,4.615646258503402
7933212,5,B000059H8B,"I treasured this production on vhs, and was delighted to see it finally come out on DVD. Gondoliers is one of Gilbert & Sullivan's best, and this fresh & spirited version is by far the best ever released on home video. Great cast, handsome sets & costumes, and brilliant direction & choreography. As a long tIime G&S fan, I'm delighted to have this DVD.",1510704000,,353,4.53125
7933213,5,B000059H8B,"This 1986 production (recast as a DVD in 2004) is THE reason why ""The Gondoliers"" is my favorite G&S operetta. While Penzance, Pinafore, and Mikado see far more live productions to this day, ""The Gondoliers"" (the last successful G&S venture) takes the cake -- and this production is over the top with regard to professional choreography, vocal standards, and stage presence.

Don't let 1986 scare you: the videography is outstanding. There are no super- or sub-titles, and you'll never miss them. The diction is perfect, the lyrics perfectly captures. And this is a LIVE performance in front of a LIVE audience.

Some of the unforgettable touches in this production:

The choreography is off the charts -- and the entire cast nails it. (Who knew that G&S could be THAT visual?)

The Duchess of Plaza T'oro is a guy in drag. (Why don't more G&S productions have a guy in drag?!)

The trampoline table. Don't ask -- just watch. You'll know it when you see it.

Rich costumes, fun props and scenery, and top-notch vocal performances and character development.

One hint: DO watch the Special Features -- Glossary beforehand. There are lyrics that reflect 1986 Canadian/English politics and news, and they're more fun when you're clued in.",1510012800,,1235,4.966019417475728

7933216,5,B000059H8B,"Sadly, the above instructions from the Duke of Plaza-Toro to would be King of Barataria candidates Marco and Giuseppe are not heard in this Sydney Opera House production.  In every other respect it is full measure and overflowing.  To Gilbert and Sullivan's original operetta format are added elements of mime, pantomime, and ballet.  The chorus and principals are required not only to sing and act, but are choreographed to breathless limits and even made to be as acrobatic in the ""Cachucha"" as members of the ballet.

All the more regrettable, therefore, is the omission of `I am a courtier grave and serious' which already enacts the blend of music, dance, wit and pomposity.  If performance considerations dictated it omission in the live performance, it should have been specially filmed and inserted into this filmed production. You will find that the Overture is here in full.

Having watched oodles of productions of this work during a long life, both in Australia and the UK, I have always found that vitality characterized Australian productions compared to the usually staid and workmanlike English way of doing G & S.  Well, the vitality here will leave you breathless.  Color and costumes are dazzling.  The sound is natural but low in volume.  Contemporary allusions have been added here and there; while regretting this I must admit that they scan and fit beautifully and fall not too far below Gilbert's  original lyrics.  The chief pantomime element is Australian Opera stalwart Graeme Ewer presenting the Duchess of Plaza-Toro as a pantomime dame.  This works well.  The Duchess's vocal contributions are normally very difficult for a contralto to deliver, but Ewer projects everything clearly.

From the opening shot of the Sydney Harbor and Opera House to the final gallery shots of the principal singers, you'll find top quality entertainment here.",1183334400,5,1870,5.145695364238411
7933217,5,B000059H8B,"I reccomend this DVD version of one of the greatest-loved Gilbert & Sullivan operettas of ALL time.  ""The Gondoliers"" is sunny, funny and broadly accessible.  It is comedic as it is melodious.

Some of the greatest opera singers from the Australian Opera are featured here.  They include David Lemke (a masterful baritone) and David Hobson (one of the most beloved tenors in Australian opera, today).  They play the title heroes (the swarthy and romantic gondoliers).  Together, with Suzanne Johnston (a lovely mezzo-soprano) and Christine Douglas (a delightful soprano), they round out the cast of numerous other talented performers in the cast.

If you want to have a good laugh and be carried away to a sunny time and place, watch this one!!!",1135123200,4,745,5.057377049180328
7933218,5,B000059H8B,"This is my very first experience of Gilbert and Sullivan's work, and I found myself most pleasantly surprised. This operetta has a fast moving, smart and fun story line accompanied by brilliant music. There are beautiful tunes one after another, and funny scenes brought up big laughter in theater and at home!

The staging is simple yet incredibly effective and fun to watch. With colorful costumes and creative designs, it provided a wonderful backdrop to the brilliant singing and lively performance by a young and very talented cast. It's pure enjoyment to watch the fun and beautifully choreographed dances that are full of surprises! The two gondoliers by David Hobson and Roger Lemke give the most delightful performances and showed pure magic in their singing and dancing. Although some may not like the updates of the lyrics, I thought it was very funny, when keeping in mind of the year 1989, and adds wittiness to the production, too.  In all, this production has opened the door to a whole new world of Gilbert & Sullivan's music for me.

Watching this opera, who would believe that David Hobson was only at the beginning of his operatic career! I am one of many who are most impressed with his performance as Rodolfo in 1993 Opera Australia production of La Boheme. There is a new website dedicated to his career, [...] where I found the most comprehensive biography of this extraordinary Australian tenor.

I had no problems with the sound effects of this DVD. Like all live opera recordings, this sounded soft because it's from real singing in a theater, rather than produced from digital sound equipments. It's really a personal choice to find the suited volume for oneself.",1112918400,11,1690,4.898601398601398
7933219,5,B000059H8B,"I WAS NOT AWARE OF THE SYDNEY OPERA COMPANY UNTIL I SAW A PRODUCTION OF LA BOHEME.  i FELL IN LOVE WITH DAVID HOBSON AND LOOKED FOR MORE.  I FOUND THE GONDOLIERS AND FOUND IT TO BE EXHILERATING, ENCHANTING, IT SPARKLES, IT SHINES. IT MOVES RIGHT ALONG . UNLIKE SOME OF YOUR REVIEWERS  I FOUND THE SOUND TO BE PERFECT.

7933220,1,B000059H8B,"Okay, so I'm a purist -- within reason. I don't care a fig when directors want to update the production by locating it in 21st century China or precolumbian Mexico instead of Venice. But I care a great deal when W. S. Gilbert's clever and delightful words are thrown away and substituted with ridiculous new lyrics mentioning, of all things, disco and Kentucky Fried Chicken. This might have been a fun antic for a cast party but it makes this production excruciating to watch. Ugh. I haven't finished watching this, and I'm not sure I will.",1044921600,8,541,4.645833333333333
7933221,5,B000059H8B,"I love this production of ""The Gondoliers"" for its festive costumes, wonderful choreography, and lively young cast. It captured me the minute I started watching and it made me laugh to tears. It brings joy. Wit and humor are the soul of Gilbert & Sullivan operetta, and they are carried out through the delightful music and the jocose librettos. In this production lyrics and dialogues were amiably given some modern treatment, which, for some audience, adds vividness, but for others, vulgarity. Well, for me, I appreciate its freshness and enjoy every bit of brilliancy on the stage.
While the whole company is excellent, from singing, to acting, and to dancing, the two adorable gondoliers, played by David Hobson and Roger Lemke distinguished themselves with their dashingly good looks and fabulous singing (no wonder the girls fall in a faint one after another). They pair very well and sound very good together. Several years later they paired again in La Bohme, giving superb performance as Rodolfo and Mercello. From comedic G & S to tear-jerking Puccini, what great talent they have!
I experienced no problem with the sound quality. The volume tends to be softer, but on a good sound system with Dolby 5.1, it gives pretty decent sound. Louder or softer, it's simply up to your ears.",1042070400,9,1292,4.95852534562212
