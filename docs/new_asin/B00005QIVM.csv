7950572,4,B00005QIVM,"Dragon( Ekin) is finally released from the prison after being held for bout 6 years. See, he was part of some triad( very much like Y&D series) and he had to do this 'job'. Which went wrong and earned him 6 years in prison.
Now, he is a new-born man. Dragon is determined to live his life right, with a help of this old friend, he gets a job as a waiter in his friend's restaurant.
One day, Dragon meets this lil kid, whom is his son. Now Dragon has one more reason to live his life right. His son's mom, Helen(Karen Mok), Dragon's ex-lover , is now part of the triad and wants Dragon to come back. back in the days, Dragon was known for his fighting skills, and his passionate love for Helen.
But Dragon, does not want to go back to his good old triad days...so Helen sets up a trap................
Surpringly, Ekin was good in this movie(don't get me wrong, i loved Chan Ho Nam and Chicken in Y&D...), maybe cuz the character, Dragon, is like an older version of Chan Ho Nam. But even Ekin could not save this somewhat a slapstick triad drama. I still say it's descent because of Ekin, some fight scenes, and dramatic points.",1025827200,,1127,4.295774647887324
