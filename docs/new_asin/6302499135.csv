7827100,5,6302499135,"""Coto de Caza"" (retitled ""Violencia Criminal"" on the MexCinema Video label; also known as ""Code of the Hunt"" and ""Hunting Ground"" in English-speaking territories) is a very rare Spanish thriller that will leave you disturbed and grasping for meaning in the world. But, then, what would you expect from Jorge Grau, the director of ""Let Sleeping Corpses Lie"" (aka ""The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue"") and ""Blood Castle"" (aka ""Ceremonia Sangrienta"")?

Assumpta Serna (""Wild Orchid"", ""Matador"") plays Adela, a public defender of poor criminals. She gets some grungy-looking scumbags off, and what do they do? They steal her car, inside of which they find the keys to her country villa. They then stage a home invasion there, during which [SPOILER ALERT] her husband is killed with a graphically depicted shotgun blast to the face. For Adela this is the beginning of pure nightmare...

""Code of Hunt"" is a very gritty and bleak film that has to be seen to be believed. The acting is excellent and the violence is ugly and brutal. The climax is incredibly vicious and sadistic in its cold depiction of sexual violence and revenge. This little gem seems to be forgotten by fans of European cult cinema, but if you get a copy treasure it.",1299283200,2,1233,4.894736842105263
