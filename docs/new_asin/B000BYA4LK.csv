8094245,5,B000BYA4LK,"To pick up where the Pokemon ""Advanced"" Season left off, ""Advanced Challenge"" offers Pokemon fans more exciting adventures, featuring Ash, Pikachu, Brock, May, and Max! Plus, any DVD that features five episodes or more, in my book, is a winner. :)

Here are some comments and observations I had, regarding each of the episodes:

""Disaster of Disguise:"" For the first time in the series, Drew appears upset, as opposed to his usual confident self. Meowth's remarks about Timmy's mother's jewelry are classic: ""Check out the hardware on 'Ma'! Some major 'Bling-Bling' going on!"" Poor Ash gets strangled by Timmy's mother a couple of times during the episode! I get a kick out of how Ash and May repeatedly reveal their ""scheme"" to Timmy's mother by accident!

""Disguise Da Limit:"" Too bad that Pikachu sent Team Rocket blasting off instead of Dusclops ... That way, Dusclops could have had the spotlight, since it was the featured Pokemon in the contest, and the audience would have been all the more impressed. I also have to laugh at that scene, because everyone who was in attendance at the contest didn't have any problem with a member of the audience (Ash) getting involved, while disposing of Team Rocket! Since the villains were the ones eliminated by Ash, I don't think security would have kicked Ash out of the stadium for him being a face in the crowd getting in on the action, but it would have been a humorous plot twist if Ash was tracked down for his actions! :) Timmy's mother's flashback was sad, but I loved how supportive she was of her son, in the end.

""Take The Lombre Home:"" Brock's question to Mary is great: ""Mary, dear! May I have this 'Rain Dance'?"" :) Most unusual that Team Rocket's pitfall trap is not as deep as usual, once Ash and his friends fall into it! One of the highlight scenes includes Lombre and Mudkip cooling down an out-of-control Solrock! I get a kick out of the Lombre hats and Solrock emblems worn by Mary's grandmother and the villagers!

""True Blue Swablu:"" When May whines about getting lost, at the beginning of the episode, her expression is similar to Charlie Brown's, whenever he whines! I got a kick out of the scene where, after Swablu put Team Rocket to sleep with its song, Cacnea accidentally hit both Jessie and James in the rear with Pin Missile! Jessie: ""Would you be careful where you point that thing?!"" :) May saying goodbye to Swablu reminds me of Ash saying goodbye to Butterfree, from the Season One episode, ""Bye Bye Butterfree.""

""Gulpin it Down:"" Professor Jacuzzi laughs like James after Brock states that the Pokeblock is working, leading the Gulpin away! Notice how Gulpin makes a burping sound once it's enlarged! The visual gag and voice acting for Officer Jenny, near the end of the episode, is hysterical when she exclaims: ""Professor! Please put it back in the ball!"" Hilarious remarks from Team Rocket too, including James complaining about not having a bite to eat since breakfast and Jessie making the excuse that Team Rocket is entitled to three square meals per day, even though they lie, cheat, and steal! :)

There is only one negative point to this DVD (This includes all of the DVD volumes for this Season of Pokemon) ... Under the ""Bonus Features"" menu, both the opening and closing themes are featured, yet they are already featured within each of the individual episodes, so to feature the exact same thing again, in a bonus feature, is redundant. However, this sort of thing doesn't really bother me as it might other fans of the Pokemon series who expect more from bonus features, and it doesn't take away from my overall rating on this release ... I just had to mention this to upcoming purchasers of the Pokemon ""Advanced Challenge"" series who have high expectations upon checking out the bonus features. Fortunately, there is a positive point to the ""Bonus Features"" section, and this includes brief descriptions of a couple of the upcoming ""Advanced Challenge"" episodes from future DVD releases ... That was nice. :)

*Before I close, note that there are a couple of differences between the opening and closing themes of ""Advanced Challenge"" ... In the intro, there is footage of Drew and Roselia, but during the ending sequence, the footage is replaced by a shot of Professor Oak, Ash's Mother, and Tracy. Also, the tail-end of the closing theme features a far-off image of the heroes, with each character facing in a different direction. Usually, in Seasons past, the Pokemon ending themes are edited versions of the opening themes, but on this occasion, there are some subtle differences between the two! :)

In closing, I have to say that everyone who contributed in making the Pokemon episodes and the DVD sets did a fantastic job! :) Thanks for reading! God Bless...
