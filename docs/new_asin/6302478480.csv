7826626,1,6302478480,"While I was pregnant with my four year old son, we visited Peru. It is a beautiful, exciting country. So, I ordered this video for my children. It is abysmal. More time is given to a scientist studying potatoes than to the Amazon river. All speakers are ""doctors"" or ""experts"". Similar mind numbing panaromic shots are shown repeatedly and for far too long. Anything would be more interesting than this video. I mean anything -- pick your nose, read an actuarys' report for fun, take a valium and watch sand, but don't waste your money on this sad disgrace to the lovely Peru.",1055116800,,576,4.601941747572815
7826627,3,6302478480,"Experience the land of Peru, the third largest nation in South America and the home of the ancient Incas whose heritage is still visible. Video Visits introduces you to the land, culture and history of the country by giving you a visual tour of one of South America's most diverse nations. You will be enraptured by the physical beauty of the landscape and swept away by its rich cultural blend of the African, Inca and Spanish cultures.
  You are taken to Lima, the capital city, where you are given a sweeping view of the city, its architectural splendor, museums and colonial mansions. Moments later you are in the plush Amazon jungle of the country with its rich flora and  diverse ecological species. Ah, don't get bored for the next excursion is to the city of Machu Picchu, the lost citadel of the Inca.
  I simply enjoyed getting a first hand visual experience (through video) of Peru and yes, it motivates you to make this country one of your first picks in visiting South America. The land and people are too intriguing to ignore. The only thing ""negative"" about the video is that it shows many of the mundane tourist restaurants, souvenir shops, etc. but these are kept to a minimum. If you are a first time traveler to Peru I would recommend this film as an introduction to the country. It will give you a much better perspective in appreciating what Peru has to offer as a vacationing spot.",990057600,8,1403,4.618473895582329
