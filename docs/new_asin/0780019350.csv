By  Pam Drapala ""Pamela Carvajal Drapala"" (AZ, USA) -

I've owned this vhs for a while; however, now that I'm retired, I have extra time to view it. In any event, it is fabulous video and a real eye opener for me. Did you know that other artists are influenced by other artists and sometimes don't even know they are painting like others? This was new to me. So, it is okay to have your work resemble someone elses. So, when someone says I paint like Frida Kahlo, that's okay. She probably painted by someone else she knew, too! A great investment . . . see for yourself.  NEW UPDATE - You will not regret your purchase of this video on Jan van Eyck or Pieter Paul Rubens.  Wish I would have seen these videos 15 years ago.  Sincerely, Pamela Carvajal Drapala, Artist, Poet, Photographer, and Poet",1251158400,,864,4.408805031446541
