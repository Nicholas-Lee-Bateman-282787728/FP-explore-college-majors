44077,5,078310135X,The spare rural scenes and bleak urban scenes make an interesting background for the revenge tale plot of this underappreciated gem.

44110,4,078310135X,"The above quote opens the film ""Exposure"" (also known as ""A Grande Arte""), a well-crafted if somewhat low-key thriller that involves the equally fascinating and repulsive subculture of knife fighting.

Peter Mandrake (Peter Coyote) is a photographer working on assembling a coffee table book of photographs about Rio de Janeiro.  The book is to cover the dark and less 'tourist friendly' side of Rio--having nothing to do with the wildly costumed and intoxicating festival atmosphere of Carnivale.  Rather, his black and white photos showcase criminals, derelicts, people in crisis, prostitutes, pimps and train surfers (adrenaline junkies that climb up onto the tops of trains, riding them like a surfboard, dodging cables and overhangs).

As he moves about the seamier and more squalid neighborhoods in Rio, Peter becomes casual friends with one of his models, a pretty young prostitute/masseuse named Gisela (Giulia Gam).  When Gisela asks Peter to accompany her while she returns a computer disk belonging to one of her more dangerous clients, Gisella winds up being horribly murdered and Peter is mistakenly identified as her blackmailing accomplice.  Afterwards, Peter and his girlfriend, Marie (Amanda Pays), are savagely attacked in their apartment by knife-wielding thugs in search of the elusive computer disk.

Traumatized by the near-death knife wound he receives, Peter wants vengeance in kind.  To dispatch his and Marie's attackers with a gun simply won't do; it must be with a knife.  To this end, he tracks down Hermes (Tcheky Karyo), an elusive and mysterious professional assassin, who Peter saw earlier in a to-the-death knife fight in the street.  Hermes is a per-sev (short for 'perforate and sever') or Knife Master.  He reluctantly agrees to train Peter and finds an enthusiastic and obsessed pupil.  The training sessions are some of the most morbidly fascinating scenes in the movie.  Hermes maps out the body's kill zones with lipstick on a mirror where Peter practices slashing and stabbing.  They also practice the offensive and defensive maneuvering techniques required to inflict the maximum amount of damage on the opponent.  Peter then sets out to track down his assailants.

Before watching this movie, I didn't know there was an actual art to knife fighting.  I simply thought that you attempted to cut the other guy while trying not getting cut yourself.  The stylized choreography of the knife fights does have a certain elegance and fascination.  The cinematography is also quite striking, and the diverse countryside of both Brazil and Bolivia is visually arresting.  The seasoned and capable actors elevate what could have otherwise been a rather mediocre thriller.  However, this film will probably still have a rather narrow and specific audience appeal.",1156809600,31,2796,5.323462414578588

I couldn't follow the plot very well and there was some questionable acting and scripting, but I remember that I have rarely ever seen full speed fighting and the training leading up to it like in this film.  It made me want to buy kevlar clothing and a gun.
I don't remember any details of the movie today, but I remember the impact it made on me.",1071187200,8,497,4.380434782608695
44113,4,078310135X,"I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE VERY MUCH, EVEN THOUGH AT TIMES IT DID MOVE SLOW. FINNALY A MOVIE SHOWING THE REALITYS OF A KNIFE FIGHT, PEOPLE ALWAYS UNDERESTIMATE THE DANGER OF GOING UP AGAINST SOMEONE WITH A KNIFE, AND FINNALY THIS MOVIE SHOWS WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN YOU FACE SOMEONE WITH A KNIFE. I AM A STUDENT OF LAMECO ESKRIMA UNDER GURU FELIX VALENCIA, AND THE BOSTON SCHOOL OF ARNIS, UNDER PUNONG GURU GEORGE BREWSTER, AND COMPETED IN KNIFE FIGHTING TOURNAMENTS, AND KNIFE FIGHTS. ALSO THE BRAZILIAN MOB BOSS IN THE MOVIE WHO WAS CUTTING HIS INITIALS INTO THE WOMENS FACES WAS VERY BELIEVABLE, EVEN DOWN TO SHOWING HIS CUSTOM MADE KNIFE AND HOW HE WORE IT. THE MOST COMPLEX CHARACTER IN THE MOVIE WAS HERMES (CHEKY KARO) HE IS AN EXCELLENT ACTOR WHO WE HAVE SEEN IN A LOT MORE MOVIES LATELEY. HE ALSO WAS VERY BELIEVABLE IN HIS ROLE.

44115,5,078310135X,"One of the most troubling, and fascinating films I'v ever seen, leaving a permanent mark in my memory.
Far from actual Hollywood balet fightings, this is a movie in which you get a glimpse of the street life & death, and what the power of the knife really is.

I like this movie a lot, but be warned, there are only two action sequences involving the actual fighting technique, and, of course, the training sequences with Hermes (Tcheky Karyo).",1007424000,3,233,5.157894736842105
44117,4,078310135X,"Do Not be mistaken....This is not an action movie like a Steven Seagal movie. This movie is about a man who seeks revenge & to learn to defend himself through the discipline of knife fighting! Knife fighting is very real! The knife fighting in this movie is some of the best I've ever seen in a movie. The acting is terrible but the situation is somewhat believeable. I believe the knife fighting in this movie is from Spain; Not from South America or the Phillipines or Indonesia. Not even from Asia! Asian knife-fighting does NOT resemble the movements demonstrated in this movie. This is not even close to Indonesian knife-fighting. This is Spanish knife-fighting, possibly from somewhere like Seville, Spain. This a good movie for what it is. Learn to appreciate it. Do not try the techniques shown here -at home. Knife fighting is not a game! It's a reality! I know because I, at least know how to defend myself with a knife. I am not an expert, but a life-long student of the martial arts. I hope this was somewhat helpful.....Enjoy.",1005955200,2,1039,4.683060109289618

7790028,4,078310135X,"A film in the tradition of Death Wish with Charles Bronson- but set in the subculture of knife fighting instead of guns. More subtly filmed than a lot of action movies favoring dialogue and character over massive explosions and over the top special effects.  Worth a look for those interested in action films- specialized knives themselves- or a fictionalized version of the gory art of knife fighting subculture, which this film manages convey without excessive splatter, A look into a culture and situation most of us will thankfully never know first hand. Pick it up if you want something a little different than the standard action thriller.",1457222400,,645,5.02803738317757

Glad to pay the price for this gem.

Mr. Karyo at his deepest most menacing.  The supreme confidence in his only shown knife fight.  The training.  Then the exit in the rain.  Some pieces are just done right.

7790032,5,078310135X,"My very first exposure, no pun intended, to the eccentric and bizarre world of blended world film styles. Combining cold hard edged Euro-styling with raw South American moviemaking, Director Walter Salles creates an emotionally disturbing and visually stark film about revenge and the loss of one's soul to attain it.

In this gritty production, we follow Peter Mandrake, guerrilla photographer - an artist who delves into the dark shadows to capture the lives of people who dwell on the outskirts of civilized life. From far away eastern lands to the humid concrete jungles of metropolitan cities, he searches out the twisted and torn found in human garbage heaps the world over.

His most recent excursion has him and his equally adventurous girlfriend Mariet, portrayed by Amanda Pays, in Brazil. But he's not there to capture images of the world-renown dancing revelers or celebrated costumed goofs. He trolls the city streets for the damaged peoples - drug addicts, throwaway children and the forgotten.

It's on one of these nightly explorations that he stumbles upon a street fight - one man versus five - and they're all wielding knifes. Mesmerized, he almost unconsciously photographs the struggle as the single man deftly kills or seriously wounds all five opponents within a matter of seconds. But not without help. One of the group's wounded attackers gets behind the single fighter - without thinking Peter cries out a warning. He saves the man from being cut, possibly even killed. Suddenly sirens wail and the crowd quickly disperses from the carnage.

This moment will forever change the lives of Peter and the man he will come to know as Hermes, played by one of my all-time favorite actors, the incomparable Tchky Kayro.

While he considers the knife fight just one more strange event to document, Peter continues to scoure the streets in order to pursue his art, where he makes another fateful encounter, not realizing that the two are linked to one another.

He chooses to befriend and follow a prostitute that ends up being murdered. Because of this relationship, forces beyond his understanding believe he was somehow involved in the hustle the street walker had been running - stealing from her clients. Unknowingly, she pilfered something extremely dangerous - a computer disc with information that leads back to a South American crime syndicate. With her death, they believe Peter is the last person to have access to that item. And those very serious people want it back, at any and all cost.

A retrieval team made up of depraved and sick thugs is sent. While he's repeatedly beaten and stabbed - they rape his girlfriend in front of his eyes.

Emotionally emasculated during the horrific struggle, he finds that he can no longer continue as an outsider looking in. He wants to enter into the darkness, become a part of it - a resident, not a visitor. His damaged soul demands revenge and nothing short it will suffice; even if he has to give up his very soul to obtain it.

His attackers easily overwhelmed and neutralized him with brute force and knifes - so that's what he wants to do in return.

He seeks out Hermes. And the blade.

What follows is an incredible tale of a man who immerses himself in a subculture he didn't know existed. In the past he was able to dance around the edges of these underworlds, benignly peering in. But this time he wants, needs, to join himself into the ugliness. Hermes warns him that once you take to the path, there's no going back. No half measures, no half-hearted attempts. If he chooses to learn the knife - he does so or else he pays for it with his life. Peter won't back down. Having found his teacher and guide, he's going thru the looking glass.

Mariet is sickened by the changes she sees and desperately wants him to pull away, to let go of his anger and recriminations, start anew someplace else. But Peter is deadly focused. He's hellbent on a collision course with the bizarre and the sick; with the deviant and damaged. Ultimately, he will face the blood-soaked hands that set all the previous events in motion.

The question is: Will he find what he's looking for?

An outstanding and totally gripping film that I hope will one day finds a proper digital format and release.

Update: Added a custom poster for this favorite film. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did creating it.",1328400000,8,4360,4.779255319148936
7790033,5,078310135X,"I saw this movie and it had a lasting affect. I get real tired of the canned movies that show people doing what is politically correct. This movie is probably Peter Coyotes best movie. Why it has not made it to DVD is obvious to me. Since it's release in 1995 the movie industry, (influenced by more powerful government figuares), tries it's best to curtail anything that would suggest that people take matters into their own hands. I think some of them think it would be a good idea for the government to name your child and they would probably do it if not for people like me and the ones reading this review. This is a great Film and I highly recommend you see it at least once. It will change your idea of knife fighting forever.",1323907200,7,733,4.318840579710145
