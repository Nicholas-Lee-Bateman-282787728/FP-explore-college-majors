8330074,1,B001OB9L6S,"While this DVD is dramatic and somewhat realistic, I felt betrayed by the use of Vietnam War era footage including images of F-8 Crusaders, A-4 Skyhawks, F-4 Phantoms and A-7 footage that was represented as operations over Iraq.  I understand their need to have filler when they did not have enough original footage of their own.  As a Vietnam war air ops veteran, I was disappointed at the false representations.  At least there should have been a disclaimer anytime those images were shown.",1334534400,4,492,4.903614457831325
