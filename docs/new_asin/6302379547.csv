I have viewed some pretty bad films and this is definitely one of them. This is one of those movies one should only watch if they are like me and just have to check out every film in the genre despite the warnings of other Horror film heads. It's about a ghost town where the past is coming back to oppress the small community. An indigenous American woman was burnt for witchcraft and comes back for retaliation.
