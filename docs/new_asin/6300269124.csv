They are depriving us of one of the best films of all time, by one of the best directors. NOT FAIR
Not only that, but the version they DO offer is so horribly dubbed and what about that price!!!!
I am completely against this type of crimes.

Truffaut shows the foibles and glories of the people who make films, revealing even his own indiscretions.  The film is, at the same  time, a charming story.  And almost every shot reveals something about how  films are made -- stuntwork, set facades, directing extras, and even  working with animals!  A joyous ode to the people who make films!",915062400,7,437,4.746666666666667
284376,4,6300269124,"In the old days, the stretch between the early 1960s and early 1970s, around Harvard Square on the days, or rather nights, when you were not listening to folk music at one of the myriad coffeehouses around the Square or stretched out on Cambridge Common listening to some up and coming young rock and roll talent blast away you would in the interest of having a cheap date based on  your low side funds wind up taking your consort to the Brattle Theater or some such place (sometimes local churches or the various houses at Harvard also ran films) to watch a film. Not usually one of the then current American Hollywood productions, a place which seemed to be in a trough in the movie-making cycle, but some film noir revival with entries like The Maltese Falcon or To Have Or Have Not or foreign, mainly French films, like those of Jean-Luc Godard or Francois Truffaut (at one time friends but because of differences about the film under review that friendship was busted up). At that time anything by a French director like this one by Truffaut, Day for Night, was an automatic go see, whether it was up to snuff or not.

This one was, was up to snuff, although not for the powerful story line like there was in say his 400 Blows but for the almost parody-like way that he was putting on American movie-making (the whole bit about shooting night scenes in a studio during the day that was taboo in French films then but a process which produced the English title). Not a parody of the great American-made films but the melodramas Hollywood was increasingly churning out to satisfy the midlands mainstream audiences. So this is a film about making a film, a run of the mill film for mass distribution starring older faded stars who still had some box office appeal and about younger stars who seem to have lost their way.

The most interesting parts of the film centered on the problems that any such production is liable to encounter from cranky stars to an inability to get scene sets to work the way the director expected them to. Of course it helped to have a real director, Truffaut himself, directing this film within a film to push the film forward. Other than the inner workings of a film though there is plenty about the lives and loves of those behind the scenes you know the ones whose names and job descriptions like script girl or best grip you see at the beginning or ending of a film.

You know watching this film some forty years later and still finding it interesting tells a lot about how good it was. Maybe though back in those cheap date consort nights I wasn't always totally focused on the screen, okay. Some say this is the greatest film ever made about making a film. Perhaps. But I think that it had to do more with Truffaut paying homage to the ups and downs of his craft, and it showed.",1469750400,,2814,4.47953216374269

284434,5,6300269124,"Day For Night is one of the best films about movie making, ranking with Singin in the Rain, The Bad and the Beautiful, and Lost in La Mancha. A loving, partly farcical tribute to the art of cinema, it  focuses on film director Ferrand (Francois Truffaut) as he goes through the process of making a picture called I Want You to Meet Pamela. The films international cast consists of Julie (Jacqueline Bisset), a Hollywood actress recovering from a nervous breakdown, her co-star Alexandre (Jean-Pierre Aumont)  a veteran actor whose screen persona is the continental lover but who could be a closeted homosexual  and Severine (Valentina Cortese), a boisterous alcoholic Italian actress who was once a great screen lover but now has difficulty remembering her dialogue.

The viewer has a front row seat to the filming, both in front of the camera and behind the scenes as one problem surfaces every few minutes and requires immediate resolution in order to move forward. Director and crew are fully aware of the vast expense of filming and are all under stress to keep pace with the rigid production schedule. The film is a veritable valentine to the art of movie making with its artificiality, team effort, star egos, and pure joy of creating a story, one scene at a time. The basic plot shows Ferrand rushing around, solving crises, keeping peace among his cast, and managing a large crew. But that is precisely the films charm. For those who think movie making is glamorous and are unfamiliar with the rigors of film making, Day For Night will be a revelation. For those who love film, it is a must see.

Blu-ray extras include a new visual essay; new interview with cinematographer Pierre-William Glenn; 2003 documentary on the film; archival interviews with director Francois Truffaut and actors Jean-Pierre Aumont, Jacqueline Bisset, Nathalie Baye and  Bernard Menez; TV footage of Truffaut on the films set in 1972; and a critical essay.

I defy anyone to forget his dream of the young cinaste, tapping the pavement inscrutably as the director tosses in his sleep, only finally to extend the cane to snaffle the film poster of ""Citizen Kane."" I defy anyone to ignore how the director shapes the nervous actress's clasp of the balcony rail.

When I'd get off the base, I used to go to a movie theater in town that showed ""international"" films as well as Japanese ones, and I'd see everything and anything. One of them was this film, (with Japanese AND English subtitles!) and I enjoyed the experience. The passing of time can often """"Rose-tint"" former experiences, and I seem to remember this as a really great film. Well, some 40+ years later, I got to see this for second time, and...it 's just okay. Several elements of the film are unfortunately dated, but it's an enjoyable  enough movie-once.

Day for Night (La Nuit amricaine) is a flim about film. It was created in 1973.
It stars Jacqueline Bisset and Jean-Pierre Laud.
The decisions, the direction, the art, the problems, the love, the money, & the money.
Day for Night is about a director named Ferrand working hard to bring a film to life.
The actor playing the director (Franois Truffaut) is also the director of the actual movie.
This is humorous and it's clear this is a work of passion.
As in every film, there is a story within a story.
Day for Night attempts to tell both. In that sense, this film could be two films happening at once.
It could also be looked at as a documentary about creating a film under pressure.
So if you ever wondered what it could possibly be like to make a film, this very well
may be a classic place to start.  Day for Night presents a larger then life picture of drama on a film set.
It also shows how the on set chemistry can essentially drive the final product.

Truffaut was one of the greatest directors ever and this was one of his best.  The story is about the making of a film, Meet Pamela.  Even though it is a small picture there is plenty of drama, pregnant star, another having a nervous breakdown.

What makes this a masterpiece is the acting.  Truffaut gets the most from all his actors, including himself playing the director.  Jacqueline Bisset (who I still feel is the most beautiful woman alive) is the star of the fake film, who is suffering recently had a nervous breakdown.  Valentina Cortese is the veteran star who has a nervous breakdown during a scene (which impressed Ingrid Bergman so much she spent most of her Oscar acceptance speech praising Cortese.) Jean Pierre Aumont is the wise older actor who is the film's touchstone.  Also featured is Dani as a supporting actress with a secret that could cause the film problems.  And Truffaut is reunited with one of his early star finds, Jean-Pierre Leaud.

But the star of the film is the film.  This is a joyous ode to filmmaking and is impossible to resist. By the way, the title refers to a cinematographic technique were a scene is filmed during the day but the lens filter makes it appear to be filmed at night.",1371340800,,1455,4.511450381679389

The film tells the story of the director Francois Truffaut making a movie called ""Meet Pamela"" and shows the different components of film-making interwined with the day-to-day life of actors and crew.

284601,5,6300269124,"""Day for Night"" is one of the best movies about the movies ever made, standing right up there with ""Sunset Boulevard"" and ""Singin' in the Rain"".  It is director Francois Truffaut's love letter to the movies, and especially to movie making.  In it he plays a long-suffering director struggling with a tight budget, an impossibly short shooting schedule, nervous investors, labor problems, a neurotic cast and crew, and a kitten.  (The funniest scene involves a kitten who repeatedly refuses to follow directions and has to be replaced at the last minute by a more cooperative feline.)  One of the nicest things about the film is that it focuses, not just on the cast, but on the crew--assistant director, script girl, makeup artist, stunt man, cameraman and extras--as well, and shows that they are as unstable as the actors are.

Truffaut takes us behind the scenes to see the magic that is used to create the realistic world the cast inhabits.  He also shows the tedium involved, the endless retakes, the last minute script changes.  In a couple of very powerful moments, he shows how the filming process takes on a life of its own, overwhelming the personal feelings and better natures of the participants.  When one of the stars of the picture dies before shooting is completed, the director and his assistant are already planning how to alter the remaining scenes so that they will be able to use a stand-in, while they are still mourning the loss of their friend.  In another scene the director utilizes words that the leading lady says to him in confidence to improve a dramatic scene in the film.

The large cast includes, in addition to Truffaut himself, Jacqueline Bisset, Jean-Pierre Aumont, Valentina Cortese, Nathalie Baye and Truffaut favorite Jean-Pierre Leaud.  All are in fine form, with standout performances by Cortese and Leaud.  In one of the funniest, and yet touching, scenes Cortese, playing an alcoholic has-been, is forced to do endless rehearsals because she is unable to remember her lines or stage directions.

This film is a must for anyone who loves the movies, and is interested in seeing how movies are made, at least how they were made forty years ago.",1311638400,4,2185,4.888888888888889

They've previously worked together in Hollywood, we are told, and, apparently, are also better-acquainted than that, although Alexandre's sexuality will come into question during the making of the movie.

 The film's score, a tuneful beauty, is by Georges Delerue.  The script was written by Truffaut, with his frequent collaborator Suzanne Schiffman, and Jean-Louis Richard; it was, of course, directed by Truffaut.  It's one of his last films, and was meant to be, with the theater-oriented&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Metro-The-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B001O549F2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Metro: The Criterion Collection [Blu-ray</a>], one of a group of films saluting the French lively arts.

The picture is set largely in the south of France, at the famous -within France, at least - Victorine Studios, an old facility whose still-standing streetscapes, used in earlier movies but never torn down due to the expense involved, quite likely enabled Truffaut's movie to be made, from the financial point of view.  It deals accurately, lovingly, with the difficulties involved in making a picture, from finding a cat that can act, to the death of a principal actor during filming.  It shows Ferrand, the director, as a deaf man who lives what he does, and is willing to deal with any difficulties involved.  At one point, he explains to his troubled people that real life is not like the movies, things just don't happen as neatly.  However, Ferrand is also, as is Truffaut's director in ""The Last Metro,"" willing to use any scrap of the turmoil of his cast and crew, and/or to create more turmoil, if it will strengthen his product.

In sum, the movie's rather mild, as movies go, but it has some really hilarious scenes -- check out the poorly performing cat.  And there's rarely been a more clear-eyed, meticulous, or affectionate portrayal of movies as they are made.  So it's still worth seeing.",1264464000,6,4934,7.06568144499179
284603,3,6300269124,"A low-key, amiable behind-the-scenes pastry from Francois Truffaut about a film's clumsy production.

Props go awry, actors flake out, love is won, lost, teased. Truffaut directs onscreen and off.

This is amusing and always engaging, and certainly worth seeing, but neither the fictional film at the center nor the general article amount to very much. Most absorbing when it depicts just how hard moviemaking is (Valentina Cortese's breakdown is excruciating; a problem with a kitten, hilarious).

284604,4,6300269124,"This film is a great treat to those who like film but know little about how they are made.  You get what is supposed to be a behind-the-scenes look into how a master director manages a whole bunch of quirky, sometimes difficult, and endearing people.

On one level, it is really excellent drama.  You have a psychologically fragile star (Bisset, who was never more beautiful), a man-child co-star (a youthful Leaud), and busy director (Truffaut himself).  They perform within a wonderful cast, in particular N. Baye, but also many French character actors who make brilliant often hilarious characterizations.  SOmehow, they get it all done, even when they maipulate and use sex and coercion to keep it going.  This part of the film is wonderful and fast moving, a true treat of melodrama.  The story within a story is very fun and there are multiple layers.

When I first saw this in high school, I was utterly enthralled with it.  However, as I learned later, Truffaut's New Wave colleagues disdained this film as a completely inaccurate portrayal of what filmmaking was really about.  Indeed, Godard's sarcastic and critical article about it alienated the two until death.  While I certainly do not know what was so inaccurate about it, this made me pause as I watched it this time - and I did not enjoy it nearly as much as the first time.

284665,4,6300269124,"It may not be as sublimely rich and ultimately haunting as Federico Fellini's `8 ' but truth be told `La Nuit Americaine' is an astonishing film that is as clever as it is honest in its depiction of the art of filmmaking.

Director Francois Truffaut plays Ferrand, the director of the production `May I Introduce Pamela?' which stars an American actress named Julie.  The film follows Ferrand's struggles with his cast, which include the diva who can't remember her lines, Severine as well as the green and somewhat unconfident Alphonse.  What is also shown is the behind the scenes action, the production crew working together (and against one another), the numerous problems that can arise for any number of reasons (the cat scene is my favorite in the film) as well as actors interactions with one another and how that can affect the finished product.

It is a different approach to the same subject as `8 ', a film that tackled the creative side of filmmaking as apposed to the production side.  Here Truffaut shows us what goes into taking what is on the printed page and transferring it onto the silver screen.  It's a very large feat, and he delivers it rather well.

Some have stated that the film starts off slow, and sadly there are some slow spots throughout, but overall the film is redeemed by a witty script (which allows us to get to know each and every player intimately) as well as some superb performances.  Standouts here include Valentina Cortese (who was nominated for an Oscar) as well as Jean-Pierre Leaud.  Cortese is wonderful as Severine, displaying the true anxiousness from realizing you are past your prime yet refusing to acknowledge it.  She is marvelously entertaining here.

Yes, it plays out like a realistic soap-opera, focus being on the word `realistic' so don't worry; this film feels nothing short of legit.

This is a very smart and very entertaining film that should be high on the lists of any lover of film, for it is an ode to the wonderful art of making that said film.  This film should come with the tagline `please try at home' for this is a film that will make you appreciate film to a degree that you'll ache to try your hand at filmmaking.

284666,5,6300269124,"This is a wonderful love letter to the movies from Francois Truffaut who not only directs but also delivers a terrific performance as a movie director. Truffaut's character is directing what seems to be a fairly banal love triangle story. The very first scene is magical. We see a Paris street with a cafe, a square, people walking their dogs, chatting, cars driving by -- the camera picks up a couple of the characters and you wonder who the film will be about. Then someone shouts ""cut"" and we realize that this is a movie scene in which every tiny detail has been orchestrated. They play the scene again, but this time we hear the director's instructions and see the cameras moving around.
The director has to manage all kinds of personal dramas on his set -- the aging actress soused on wine who can no longer remember her lines, the spoiled male lead who is so childish and narcissistic as to be absurd, the fragile English star (played by Bisset) with the older husband -- and the lesser characters -- the stage hands, personal aides, the director, the stuntman -- each with their own little stories.

284667,5,6300269124,"""Day for Night"" is the 4th or 5th movie by Francois Truffaut that I have seen.  The other movies were good, some even very good, but I came away from them with the impression that they were over-rated.  If anything, I thought ""Day for Night"" was under-rated.  It has a subject matter that had me sceptical; a movie made about making movies.  I have seen a number of movies on that subject (""8 1/2"", ""Contempt"", etc) and I have certainly read more than enough books where the author makes himself (or herself) the main character in the story.  At times these semi-autobiographical works are very well-done but too often, it seems that the writers/directors have a better impression of themselves than I did.  Too often, the audience is left to observe (from afar) a world we don't belong in.  I think that is the beauty of ""Day for Night"".  Truffaut gives us the impression that we are participants rather than an audience.  We may not have any specific responsibilities on the set but we are in the midst nonetheless.

My second impression of the film was the completeness of the experience.  In a two hour movie, I learned more about film-making than I proably would have in a 5 hour documentary (and had more fun in the process as well).  Truffaut has a gift of including so many aspects of the process and he does it all with the personal touch of a cast that seems anxious that we get the most out of the experience.  There is plenty of humor, more than enough drama, and it all is woven together in a tempo that eliminates boredom or confusion.  There is always something that catches our focus just long enough to make us understand the purpose and just short enough to avoid overstating the point.  The way the different characters weave in and out of the different events give ""Day for Night"" a multi-dimensional aspect as well.

""Day for Night"" moves along as well as just about any picture I've seen.  Kudos to the film editor in an off-camera lesson in the art.  I got to the end of the film in a very happy frame of mind.  It was a sense of satisfaction that is so often missing in most movies.  ""Day for Night"" is a classic!",1221264000,7,2137,4.458762886597938
284668,3,6300269124,"In his films he shows considerably more technical skill, overall, than his great rival, Jean-Luc Godard; but even when Godard woefully misfires, as in some of his early films, he's at least striving for something. Truffaut, by comparison, likes shiny, pretty things, and anything that disturbs that safe universe is averse to him. Thus, his 116 minute long, 1973 filmic take, Day For Night (La Nuit Amricaine), on the behind the scenes goings on at the making of a movie amount to little, as neither the exterior film, the interior film, nor the extra-exterior of the viewer watching the film, satisfies on any level. The characters on all levels are rather vapid, if not outright cardboard characters, and it's a tossup as to which set of characters are more vapid- those who portray actors in Day For Night (whose title derives from film scenes that are shot day for night, wherein a filter is used to give the look of night while shooting in daylight, yet the metaphor of which is pointless to the actual film), or those the actors portray within the interior film Meet Pamela (Je Vous Prsente Pamela- literally May I Introduce Pamela). On either level, the action is purely melodramatic. Critics argue the film shows how much Franois Truffaut loves film. So? Love without action or meaning is rather sterile- the perfect description for this well made but dull and simply pointless film. There have been many films made about the making of film, or meta-films on the subject, even going back to the silent era. But, the two most interesting comparisons to be drawn with this film would be from films released a decade earlier. One by Truffaut's rival- Godard, who made Contempt (Les Mepris), and the other by Federico Fellini: 8 (Otto E Mezzo).... Still, despite its awards and reputation, Day For Night is not near a great film, merely an adequate one, whose greatest failing is its being too long for its banal and lightweight screenplay to sustain itself. If it lost 30-35 minutes it could have been more successful. Then again, I may as well grow wings, for the screenplay aspect of films was never high on the list of the French New Wave filmmakers, who were birthed out of the atrocious Cahiers Du Cinma magazine on film theory. The filmmakers who came from this milieu (Truffaut, Godard, Eric Rohmer, Jacques Rivette, Claude Chabrol) were generally not good writers (with the exception of Louis Malle), even if they were competent technical and visual stylists. Their writing, as critics, was routinely bad, consisting of purple prose that dealt with the criticism of intent, rather than substance, and was usually only undershot by the often worse ideas they espoused.
  Thus, Day For Night's failure is no surprise. It is too prosaic, flat, and hollowly predictable to succeed as great art, even if it is an interesting diversion, at times. Compared to a film like John Cassavetes Opening Night, which similarly details the dramatic goings on of a stage production, it is fey and forgettable. Say what?",1221004800,5,3015,4.88671875
284669,4,6300269124,"Day for Night has not aged quite as well as some of Truffaut's other films, since it feels like an homage to a bygone era, but that is partly because it has influenced so many subsequent portrayals of what goes on behind the scenes during the making of a film, and it is partly because the filmmakers wanted to make an homage to an older style of filmmaking.  Tom di Cillo's ""Living in Oblivion"" for example is the American indie version of Day for Night -- more cynical, even more funny, but not nearly so complex or profound.  Day for Night almost wants to be a tragedy, and while the fact that the film gets finished in the end lends the film a comic dimension, it is clear that Truffaut knows life is never so neatly packaged.  That is, in fact, the central theme of the film: that life is unpredictable and often tragic, but cinema makes magic of tragedy, and is worth the sacrifice that are made for it.  The acting is very real and compelling -- especially when you recall that most of the actors play essentially two roles: their stage role and their character.  The film itself seamlessly moves between scenes that are shot for the film within a film and scenes shot of the filming process and of the lives of the actors and crew.  I did enjoy the fact that Truffaut included himself as the director of the film with the film that he was also directing; I also enjoyed a great deal the glimpse into what seems to be his process of working with actors and improvising in response to the demands of situations.

My only complaint is that there are a few fairly heavy-handed elements in the film, that belie Truffaut's otherwise light and subtle touch.  At a few moments in the film we can hear what a character is thinking through voiceover -- and it seemed somewhat sporadic and inconsistent rather than the result of a coherent approach.  When Truffaut (playing a director) falls asleep he hears voices (usually his own) and then dreams -- and the dreams are always of a little boy walking down the street in black and white.  The dreams don't fit as clearly or as lightly into the film as similar sequences in Fellini's 8 1/2 (a film that this film is obviously comparing itself to at certain points).  Though it seems that the boy in the dream must be the director, it wasn't clear to me what the dreams revealed other than: this is someone who, from an early age, was fascinated by film (and, possibly, felt guilty about ""stealing"" from Orson Welles).  But I'm not sure why we needed three separate dream sequences (or any at all) to convey what seemed already clear -- at another moment the director opens a package of books and they are books about several of the great western directors including Orson Welles, Fellini, and Cocteau.  Even that seemed a bit heavy handed -- was the point to make a comparison or to suggest a feeling of inadequacy?

On the whole, though, in spite of a few reservations that may be peculiar to me, this is an excellent film that belongs especially among the very great films about film: 8 1/2, Stardust Memories, Living in Oblivion, Beware of a Holy Whore, State and Main, and a few others.

We see what goes on in the daily lives of those involved in the work, from the director (the same Truffaut) to the producer, to the cast, to the stuntman. There's a curious lady, a wife to one of the employees, who sits knitting and watching her husband so he doesn't cheat on her during work. Everybody keeps busy working and flirting chaotically, and the only one who does not mix work and pleasure seems to be the director (and maybe the producer). It's supposed to be funny, and even nostalgic. There are visual references to the great classic directors in film history, to how the film industry has changed... One thing to learn from this story is that fiction plays a role in our lives: it serves as a contrast to the frivolity and emptiness of our real lives.

""Do you think the story of a woman who falls for her father-in-law can still be interesting today?"", asks a reporter to the leading star. That question is quite revealing of what our world has become. Sex and alcohol keep these pitiful troupe working like gasoline keeps a car running. Another important moment is when the knitting lady (mentioned before) gets tired of watching so much promiscuity going around and starts yelling at the whole crew. What role does she play? Is she the typical conservative fun-spoiler? Or is she Truffaut's alter-ego? Hard to say. And that's one reason why this whole film is pointless. It just describes what goes on, which is not interesting at all, there's no plot, there are no interesting characters, only adults acting as children acting as adults.

This actually won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, and it is evident why.  Day For Night is really a valentine to Francois Truffaut's love affair with cinema.  This is a great and intriguing story (a sort of film within a film approach).  Ferrand (played by Truffaut) is the hardworking film director, trying to line all of his ducks in a row, to film and complete his movie, ""Je Vous Presente Pamela.""  As is often the case, nothing is going quite as was planned.  For starters, his beautiful lead, Julie (Jacqueline Bisset), is recovering from a breakdown.  Her co-star (Jean Pierre Leaud) is completely unreliable, and Severine (Valentina Cortese), an aging actress, is hitting the bottle pretty hard during the filming of their picture.  What's more, all sorts of other intrigues are taking place between members of the crew (romantic and otherwise).

I love this shot because it almost seems like a pseudo-documentary, as well as a loving tribute to the blood, sweat and tears that go into making a film.  How great that Truffaut got in front of the camera for this piece.  He really should have done it more often.

284727,5,6300269124,"Along with Fahrenheit 451, Day For Night is easily Francois Truffaut's most playful film. It works where so many subsequent moviemaking movies don't because Truffaut doesn't put the director at the center of the picture, or indeed the movies themselves: it may be set in a movie studio on a troubled picture, but it's all about people and about love in its various forms. Moreover, for all the pains and tantrums and breakdowns, there's a real love for and acceptance its characters that makes it a particularly joyful experience. Throw in some great performances from a fine ensemble cast - not least the oft-overlooked Jean-Pierre Aumont - and a wonderful Georges Delerue score, and it's hard not to fall under its spell.

Truffaut also shows us the actors, actresses, and production staff in all their glory (and all their pettiness, too): their genius, hard work, cleverness, generosity, and professionalism (and also their mediocrity, selfishness, narrow-mindedness, and intolerance). Although in his honesty Truffaut demolishes some of the myths about moviemaking (the biggest being that the seemingly well-ordered finished product that audiences see in the theatre is in no way achieved in a methodical, systematic manner), he doesn't lessen the magic involved. He reminds us, in an almost heroic way, how actors and actresses have to put aside their own personal problems and become, though briefly, yet still convincingly, somebody else.

While this movie is about making movies, it still revisists Truffaut's main theme in most of his films: the relationships between men and women.

A brilliant movie by a brilliant director (the best, actually).  The opening one minute tracking shot of the ""movie within the movie"" emptiomizes Truffaut's own unique style: a bus zooms by as we seemingly focus on the main character? A woman dressed in red walking a busy street? No.... an elderly couple walking their dog? No... Jean-Pierre Leaud coming up the steps of a subway stop? No... a red convertible pulling up and parking?  Still no... but alas, after nearly one full minute of the camera looping around this busy Parisian street, we finally land on the intended main character of the scene, Jean-Pierre Aumont, as he gets slapped by an approaching Jean-Pierre Leaud.  This opening sequence sets the tone for a truly original film about film.

I love the camera style of Truffaut, where either at the beginning of a scene, or in most cases after it, he will pan off of the main characters or action, and sneakingly dwell on some other non-significant character or scenery.

Even though we don't make movies like they used to in 1972, this is still a fascinating look into the movie making world of the time, with all it's facets, responsiblities, and relationships.

 I saw this film years ago, but, it was the English dubbed version. I found the dubbing distracting and it had an effcet on my overall feeling of the film. When the movie became released on DVD it included the sub-titled version. I am reviewing this version. By seeing the film with sub-titles I now think it is one of Truffaut's best films only behind ""400 Blows"".

 Maybe you're thinking I'm crazy. Can seeing a movie sub-titled really make that much of a difference? You have no idea. Just think about it. Now we can hear the original actors. We can hear the emotion they put in their lines. It is much different that hearing someone else plainly saying their lines. It is almost like seeing the film for the first time.

 As we watch ""Day for Night"" we see what it takes to make a movie. All the problems that can occur, amd unfortunately for Truffaut, everything that can go wrong, does. People die, actors get pregnant, crew memembers fall in love, actors forget their lines, and film footage is destroyed. But as the saying goes, ""the show must go on"". And why does everyone keep going on? Because they love movies. It's one of the many reasons so many people have called this one of the greatest films about films in a class with ""8 1\2"", ""Contempt"" and to a lesser extent one of my favorites ""Stardust Memories"".

 ""Day for Night"" won the Academy Award for ""best foreign film""in 1972 and two years later was nominated for ""best picture"". Film critic Gene Siskel even hailed it as the best film of 1974.

The film captures the French's love of film - from the way that Truffaut collects film books to the way that Leaud spends every possible moment going to the movies.  The best line of dialogue is when Truffaut says ""When I begin, I try to make the best picture possible.  Half-way through, I just try to finish.""  Anyone who has ever worked on a film set will see that some things are eternal - the way all actors are children, and all the drama that develops.

In it, Truffault rightly predicts the future of filmmaking -- that films would be made on the streets, independent of Hollywood.
Like any Truffault film, one must be in the mood to enjoy intellectual banter and slow development to get to the heart of it. This was very Altman-esque, with lots of activity and talk at once making the subtitles difficult to follow. Yet once I resolved myself to sitting close enough to read constantly, I was completely taken up with the beauty. Truffault brilliantly illustrates the experience of being an artist in a medium that requires so many tedious details to be taken care of. The actors are superb and the characters are developed brilliantly, beginning the film as the caricatures that they present to strangers, and becoming more developed as they get to know one another. The music was also a suprise, as instead of using it as background filler or to create suspense, he brings in distinct themes at certain parts to draw one into greater understanding. Long live the DVD format -- watching the accompanying interviews was a great learning experience.",1077667200,7,1250,4.818604651162791
284734,4,6300269124,"This DVD of Francois Truffaut's charming 1973 classic ""Day for Night"" is a wonderful little movie - very bright, funny, warm, cute, inviting, entertaining, informative, and fascinating. In the mold of other great films about making films, such as Fellini's ""8 1/2"" and Godard's ""Contempt"", Francois Truffaut let's us visit the set of a French film crew at work - with himself playing the deaf director in charge. Francois Truffaut does as much acting in this film as directing. Indeed, just four years later, he'd star in Steven Spielberg's ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" as the French scientist Lacombe. It's a sheer joy from start to finish and the humanity shines throughout. I loved this film.
The DVD is a nicely mastered picture with some pleasant extras, such as a documentary on the film by film scholar, Annette Insdorf (who always gives a wonderful introduction to any French film masterpiece).
Francois Truffaut makes wonderful movies and this is one of his best! An adorable movie by anyone's standards.",1066780800,5,1021,5.047337278106509
284815,5,6300269124,"Hollywood keeps making films that, since ""Sunset Boulevard,"" see filmmaking as some kind of gothic tragedy.  ""La Nuit Americaine"" sees it as a struggle towards just making a film done, inspite of all kinds of problems.  There is no question here however that love, sex, egos, alcoholism, and the rest are all part of just trying to make a film; still, it strangely comes together through a totally humane, generous and, when it serves, a self depricating genius of film making (Truffaut). Why else would Spielberg cast him as he does in CE3K?  Also, note that the film begins with Georges Delerue's musical optical track.  Great stuff.",1055116800,,635,4.906542056074766
284816,5,6300269124,"La Nuit Amricaine is an interesting movie with celebrated French director Francois Truffaut playing a director making a movie.  He proves to be a modest and convincing actor himself while patiently weaving a tale about how movies are made and how intense the emotional interactions among those making the movie can be.

Don't give up on this one too soon.  It starts slow and seems almost amateurish because of the relatively low-tech way the film within the film is being shot.  Truffaut gives us a glimpse of how the production crew works together (and sometimes at odds) while showing us some of the things that can go wrong while making a movie.  He begins with the technical details of the production but before long begins to concentrate on the personalities of the movie-makers and their individual stories.  Each story is carefully crafted in a somewhat leisurely way almost like the characterizations in a soap opera (without of course the phony drama and mass market sentimentality seen on TV).  Truffaut's fine sense of emotional conflict and how conflict might be resolved makes the various stories touching without being maudlin.

Jacqueline Bisset who stars as English actress Julia Baker who plays the title role in the film within the film (May I Introduce Pamela?) doesn't make her appearance until about a fourth of the way in.  She is a delight as an actress with a heart of gold recovering from a nervous breakdown married to an older man whom she does indeed love.  Jean-Pierre Leaud, whom most viewers will recall as the running boy in Truffaut's The 400 Blows, plays a young and not entirely confident actor who gets jilted by the script girl who runs off with the stunt man during production.  Bisset's warm and sisterly befriending of Leaud is, shall we say, entirely French (which gets her into trouble with her husband).  This really is a skillful showcasing of Bisset since she gets to play something like an ingenue with her husband and the older woman with Leaud.  Be careful you might fall in love with her.

Valentina Cortese in a fine supporting role does a most convincing job of playing the temperamental Italian actress just past her prime who quaffs champagne while working, who forgets her lines and can't find the right door, but when properly indulged gives a great performance.

My problem with this movie is I saw the dubbed version and of course that is disconcerting because one is constantly trying to reconcile the visualized actor with the dubbed one.  To see Jacqueline Bisset who is beautifully fluent in both English and French speaking French while at the same time hearing someone else speaking English for her is just a bit too much to take.  I understand that the DVD version is in French with subtitles.  I would recommend that you get that and not the dubbed video.

Truffaut is the kind of director who allows the audience to penetrate not only his characters to see what makes them tick, but also the stars who play those characters.  He does a particularly beautiful job with Bisset who is warm and wise and something close to heroic, and with Leaud whose childishness seems natural and whose pettiness forgivable.  Don't believe those reviewers who think this is a slight film.  It is carefully crafted and very well thought out and is a fine example of the work of the one of the great directors of the French cinema.  See it for Truffaut whose delicate genius is evident throughout.

Although its story is rather trivial and melodramatic, the good humor and wit, the beauty of the setting, and above all the extraordinary performances elevate this to the level of near masterpiece. Especially the amazing performance of Valentina Cortese as a vain actress whose son is dying of cancer. She clearly should have won the 1974 Oscar for Best Supporting Actress - so obvious was it to everyone (except the sentimental Academy voters, who instead gave it to Ingrid Bergman, of all people), that even Bergman, accepting the statuette, publicly said it should have gone to Valentina!
It's a charming movie, not Truffaut's best, but close to being his happiest. Terrific to have it out on DVD. Don't miss it!",1048204800,3,806,4.890510948905109

French and dubbed version and a boatload of extras including rare footage of Truffaut interviews. Needless to say that the images and the sound are perfect. But BEWARE, you have to own a DVD player able to read zone 2 DVD's.
In my opinion, if you must choose three titles in Truffaut's filmography, take THE 400 BLOWS, JULES AND JIM and DAY FOR NIGHT. With those titles, you'll have in your library the quintessence of his work.

284820,3,6300269124,"A wonderful film; the opening shot (with its surprise followup) is my second-favourite example of how camera movement can make or break a scene (my all-time favourite is that incredible crane shot in Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West""), and the peeks behind the silver screen that it gives us both de-mystify and increase our appreciation of the high art of film-making.
Something else it may point up for us is that, in Hollywood, in Dory Previn's words ""Female meat does not improve with time...""; movies continually cast lead actors in romantic roles opposite women twenty or thirty years their junior, but almost the only possible roles that allow an older woman to be romantically attracted to a younger male tend to portray the woman as a predator.  Severine, the older actress playing the mother in the film within a film complains that she and Alexandre, the romantic lead, hit Hollywood at about the same time and hsre she is playing mothers and other ""older women"", and he's still playing the romantic lead who gets the young girl.  (The irony of this is emphasised by the fact that, in 1973, Valentina Cortesa (Severine) was 48 and Jean Pierre Aumont (Alexandre) was 59 -- and she is cast as the aging actress playing the cast off older woman and he was the ""mature"" leading man getting the girl -- played by then-29-but-looking-younger Jacqueline Bissett).
The sequence in which Severine completely falls apart as she repeatedly blows take after take of a relatively simple scene is almost harrowing to watch; one almost wonders how Cortese was able to so convincingly simulate progressively broader problems until she is in near-hysteria without breaking down almost as badly as her character does.
The details of film technology are fascinating, as are the story and continuity problems that arise and (due to the fact that films are shot out of order and two scenes that take place one after the other on screen may well be shot in reverse order and days, even months, apart) must be taken into account and require rewrites and even reshoots (though one attempts to avoid those) -- such things as the death of the  person playing a major character before all of that character's shots are in the can.
The dream sequences (in black & white) are, in fact, actual events from director Truffaut's childhood.
The only things really wrong here is the abysmal English dubbing.  Not only is it bad, in and of itself, but it decreases the sense of how truly international the production of ""Je vous presente Pamela"" is.
Also, it leads to  absurdities in scenes like the one in which director Ferrand (Truffaut) announces (in French) that the important action scene will be shot in ""nuit Americaine"".  The stunt man (British and not speaking a word of French says ""What?"" and Julie (Bissett) translates to the English-language term ""Day for Night"".  Consider the absurdity of this, as rendered in the dubbing with everyone dubbed in English, no matter what language they were originally speaking: ""We'll be shooting it day for night."" ""Huh?"" ""It means 'day for night'."" ""Oh.  Thanks.""
Pretty please, could we have this on DVD with the original track and our choice of subtitles?",1033776000,3,3187,4.867158671586716
284821,4,6300269124,"In giving a star rating, I'm torn between rating the film itself and rating the video in its dubbed state. So lest anyone criticize me for ""giving it one star just because of the dubbing""...
I am not a cinema expert by any means, but I have seen the subtitled version and I have seen the dubbed version, and the subtitled version is much funnier and more enjoyable. So you have to read a little, so what? I am curious why they chose to release the dubbed version on video and not the subtitled one. Probably thinking that, since it is such an immediate and enjoyable movie about movies, it might actually sell to English-speaking audiences as a ""Player""-esque comedy, romp, etc.
I can understand this, but can we please please see a release with subtitles?
I know a lot of information gets lost in the subtitling, so it's far from perfect either, but at least it's not actively disturbing, like when hackneyed American voices with little (or the wrong) feeling come out of mouths that are moving completely differently. Also, I like hearing the language be spoken. I like the sound of French voices in French movies. It's what the movie is supposed to sound like. Just as westerns sound right with American voices.
Maybe I'm weird, but I can barely watch the subtitled version. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend it (2 stars perhaps). But the movie itself is wonderful! Don't buy the video, but do go see it in the theater if you get the chance.",1027814400,3,1442,4.614785992217898

It's engaging and funny, and (having worked on a couple film sets) right on about the behind the scenes antics of a movie set.
Also, this was my first encounter - I think - with Jacqueline Bisset. Man is she great. And what a looker. As I was watching the movie I kept thinking she looked like someone else and then I realized it: Elizabeth Hurely! I swear she could be Jacqueline's son. Anyway Bisset was lithe and elegant and spoke great french. Yummy yum yum YUM.

284823,5,6300269124,"Day For Night (also called La Nuit Americaine) is a captivating glimpse into the mechanics of the film-making industry. It is a film within a film - the plot concerns the trials and tribulations (both human and technical) involved in the production of the fictional movie ""I Want To Present Pamela"".
We are inducted into the world of director Francois Truffaut and his motley band of cast and crew as they cope with the seemingly endless difficulties in trying to make a film they can be proud of in a limited amount of time. There are tempestuous actors who storm off the set, canisters of film which go missing, and even the death of an actor during filming to deal with. And yet, through all this, the film itself reigns supreme.
Day For Night is a French film, so unfortunately for English-speaking viewers some of the feeling is possibly lost in translation (either through dubbing or subtitling). However, the essence of the film remains, helped in no small part by some montage sequences set to Georges Delerue's wonderful orchestral score.
The film was made almost thirty years ago, so looking at it from a purely historical perspective, it might seem a little dated. However, to see it merely as a representation of a point in time is to miss entirely the message contained within the movie; this message being that films are timeless. So whilst we might smile nostalgically at the clothes (most of which are unbelievably tight), the aspects of human relationships revealed are as relevant today as they were in 1973.",1020816000,,1526,4.806083650190114

This is one of the best movies I have seen about making movies -- the mechanics of making movies. Quality of the final product doesn't matter to many of the participants -- the stunt man, for example, focuses on his ""trick"" and moves on to another movie -- it may appear in a great movie, or a bad movie -- the stunt man doesn't really care.

Truffaut himself plays Ferrand, the director of a movie named Meet Pamela,; everyone involved seems to agree that it is going to be pretty terrible. But Ferrand doesn't seem to care; he loves the process, not the artistic achievement. And Truffaut as a master of both technique and the psychology of people who make movies for a living, has created a minor masterpiece.

Technical devices are accurate and informative; the title comes from a filtering technique that turns day into night by a filter over the lens of the camera..

Ferrand's philosophy of movie making captures the essence of this fine effort: Shooting a movie is like a stagecoach trip. At first you hope for a nice ride. Then you just hope to reach your destination.

And it is a movie for people like me that love movies. Another character replies to his girl friend interested in a nice dinner: Little restaurants? You must be joking! Dont you know Nice has 37 movies? We can grab a sandwich.

I kept catching myself up -- ""Meet Pamela"" and its mechanics are always there, of course, but ""Day for Night"" presents something very real. And the something comes from Truffaut himself who said in an interview: The most beautiful thing I have seen in a movie theater is to go down to the front, and turn around, and look at all the uplifted faces, the light from the screen reflected upon them.
