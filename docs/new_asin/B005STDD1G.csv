8485439,5,B005STDD1G,"The Charlie Rose series on Brain is powerful and beautifully produced.  The episode on consciousness is worth viewing by everyone.  Our human minds have a powerful and unique consciousness, but so much that is critical to how we live, the emotions we have, and the decisions we make are produced by processes for which we have little or no awareness.  The panel in the episode spoke clearly and openly about what we know, and do not know.  Charlie Rose is a master moderator and interviewer.  Its a great series.  This episode is my favorite to date.",1344988800,,550,4.677083333333333
