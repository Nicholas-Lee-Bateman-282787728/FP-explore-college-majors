3153620,5,B001675ZJW,"Though, initially, I was a bit dismayed that only half of Season 1 was released, since I never expected to see the show again, let alone on DVD, I'm just THRILLED to own it, even half of a season!  I've been a fan of the wonderfully talented Joe Penny for at least 23 years & this is my favorite of his many roles.  Word is that this partial release is supposed to be to test the sales market, so if Viacom/Paramount/CBS feel that sales are good enough, they'll release the rest of Season 1 & the rest of the 5 years, which will be BLISS for us fans!  I so enjoy the give-and-take between JL (McCabe) & Jake.  True, I watched the show because of Joe Penny, but I was also a fan of the late William Conrad and enjoyed watching him as ""Canon"" years before he played JL McCabe.  (I also loved him as the narrator of the Rocky & Bullwinkle show, plus his other voice-overs.)

Personally, I don't consider people who bought this DVD as stupid or mislead or ""puppets of the industry.""  We're just fans, fans who hope that sales are good & we get the rest of Jake and the Fatman on DVD!",1215993600,9,1079,4.183574879227053

It was a joy to revisit this show again.  William Conrad and Joe Penney are great together.  Also, who could forget Gertrude and her interaction with the Fatman!!

3153622,5,B001675ZJW,"I became hooked on this show during the 5th and final season so I am soooo thrilled that I can finally catch up on the other seasons.  I am a huge Joe Penny fan, and this show was perfect for him. I'm kind of bummed out that only 1/2 a season will be on the DVD but it's a good start!",1213401600,10,284,3.6557377049180326
3153623,3,B001675ZJW,"Unfortunately, once again DVD consumers get only half the product while paying full price. In case you hadn't noticed, this is only HALF of the first season. List price is $36.98. If you were to purchase the complete first season at list price (assuming the second half even gets released) that would come to $73.96 for a single season. How does that grab you? Even with the Amazon pre-order discount you'll still end up paying over $50 for a single season, not to mention having to wait for the next volume!

Please note that my rating is a reflection of the HORRIBLE decision to release only half a season with a pathetic ""rip-off"" price tag.

This is a very entertaining late 80's, early 90's crime drama. It deserves to be released as a reasonably priced FULL SEASON. If a production company is going to offer only half season releases, they need to price them CORRECTLY ($17.99 to $19.99 per half season).

Should you decide to purchase this set, you'll be treated to episodes featuring some great guest stars, such as; Robert Culp (I Spy, Greatest American Hero), Dwight Schultz (The A-Team), Joe Regalbuto (Murphy Brown), Mark Goddard (Lost in Space), and many more. While season five is a long way off, I really enjoyed the addition of Melody Anderson to the cast (Flash Gordon - 1980).

Great to see this series arrive on DVD. A shame that consumers once again get the shaft!

3153624,5,B001675ZJW,"This used to be one of my all time favourite tv shows and I can't wait to see it again.  Jake Styles was so 'smooth' as an investigator working for J.L McCabe who was the District Attorney.  The show started off in LA and later down the track it moves to Hawaii.
McCabe was a cigar smoking 'tough' guy who had his dog follow him everywhere (or sit still and do nothing) and Jake was a 'suave' (back then) guy who almost always got the girl.  Each episode was usually a new story and by todays standards, it's very old school but to me, that is some of the appeal.  I loved the chemistry between McCabe and Jake - almost like a father and son relationship.  There was also Derek Mitchell who always tried his best to impress McCabe, but never seemed to do so.  He was a little goofy, especially in Jake's shadow.
It's definately worth checking out.  It's much better than Riptide which Joe Penny (Jake) also starred in.  I recommend it if you like the old style of getting the bad guys.",1207353600,37,985,4.286486486486487
3153625,4,B001675ZJW,"It all started during ""Matlock's"" first season (1986).  The sixth episode of that series featured William Conrad as District Attorney James ""Fatman"" McShane.  The next year the producers took this character, changed his name slightly to Jason Lochinvar 'Fatman' McCabe, and with Conrad created the long-running series ""Jake and the Fatman"".  Conrad's deep voice gave him  quite a radio/television career, much of it unseen as he played Matt Dillon on the radio version of ""Gunsmoke"" and did voiceover commentary for ""The Fugitive"" and ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"".  But he was the featured on-camera guy for this series.

The 106 hour-long episodes of this police drama were originally broadcast on CBS from 1987 to 1992.  This DVD contains the first half of the 23 episodes from the first season, 21 regular episodes and a two-part pilot, which actually ran ""after"" the show had premiered. Season One was set in Los Angeles, then the series moved to Hawaii.  All 23 episode titles and their original air-dates are detailed below.

The interaction of the two title characters in the series will remind you of ""Hardcastle and McCormick "" (1983) and it is reasonable to believe that the producers copied that show to get the same dynamic.  But the two title characters in the first season of  ""Jake and the Fatman"" could be considered the most authentic looking of any police drama.  While Conrad's character on ""Cannon"" was dubbed ""Cannonball"" by Mad Magazine, lampooning was unnecessary with the ""Fatman"" character.  Like ""Cannon"" he groans and complains but manages to get his man by the end of each episode.  But while ""Cannon"" at least looked presentable, the ""Fatman's"" grooming makes him look he's been staying in a homeless shelter and staining his tie in soup kitchens.

Of course this was supposed to contrast with his suave police associate Jake Styles (Joe. E. Penny), who cruises for babes in a silver Porsche speedster.  But this guy isn't like the squeaky clean detectives on ""Hawaiian Eye"".  As Harry and Wally said:  ""Jake is some young, oily hotshot who works undercover to do the legwork....Jake looks like the kind of guy who would proposition your fourteen-year-old sister"".  He did seem slightly more wholesome once the two moved to the Islands but for DVD buyers that won't be until Season Two.

3153630,5,B001675ZJW,I love the Jake and the Fatman series. I have purchased the first two seasons. I loved the show when it was on television. I am anxiously awaiting the release of the final 3 seasons. When will the complete series ever be released? I would buy the complete series even though I have the first two seasons already. I just want to be able to see every episode. It is a wholesome and Family show.,1419465600,,392,4.24

3153634,5,B001675ZJW,"I just discovered this series recently...as it wasn't a show that I watched as a child. However, I thoroughly enjoyed this set and would love to see the entire series available on dvd.
For now, only the first 2 seasons out of five are available on dvd. However, I'll keep my fingers crossed!
William Conrad and Joe Penny compliment each other very well and they make for a good pair in this series!
Conrad, just as in the series Cannon, is a man that you DON'T want to mess with! His appearance might fool you, but
his character is not a man you want to cross!
I enjoy Joe Penny in this series also...even moreso than his performance in the tv series Riptide!
William Conrad portrays a District Attorney and Joe Penny plays his private investigator/cop, Jake Styles.
William Conrad was a fantastic actor and he has a screen presence about him that demands attention and respect!
This series plays as a courtroom drama, private investigator and cop series all thrown into one!
The plots are very well-written and this show entertains! This is one of my new OLD favorites!
Check it out!",1414022400,,1084,4.6217616580310885

3153638,4,B001675ZJW,"Although I tire of the murder/police/PI shows that America seems to be stuck on during that era (Charlie's Angels, Hardy Boys, Remington Steele, Moonlighting, Magnum PI, Riptide, Matlock, Murder She Wrote, etc etc etc etc etc) this show was pretty interesting. It held my attention after all these years of sitting down to watch it. I probably never watched an entire episode back when it was on TV. Anyway the first season is definitely entertaining. The second season is a HUGE turnoff. They move the shooting to Hawaii. I hate Hawaiian culture and when shows move filming there like Charlie's Angels did. One weird thing . . . ""Jake""/Perry doesn't seem as macho now as he was built up to be back then. The Italian thing was kinda weak . . . when it was leaned on.",1395878400,,766,4.598540145985401

Good looking Joe Penny and always serious in a funny sort of a way William Conrad carried a very ""vanilla"" show.  The show went for five years so I guess that might explain the dvd release, but why in volumes not seasons?  One favorite episode off this volume, but can think of a few other shows that rank dvd release dates more!  With that said, I hope shows get released in seasons oppose to season volumes!!!",1236038400,,526,4.326530612244898

3153650,1,B001675ZJW,"This is just plain arrogance by CBS/Paramount. They take a show that was only moderately popular in the late 80s and almost obscure right now and try to rip off the few loyal fans of the show by splitting up the seasons while charging almost full price. Why in the world they split up the first season when it only aired 22 episodes!!! This is absurd. It is nothing but greed by CBS/Paramount. They realize that this the only chance for fans of the show to see it again and really want to make them pay for it. I mean, if the consumer bought both volumes, it amounts to over $70 for 22 episodes of a mediocre-at-best show. I'm also guessing that music has been altered and there are no special features. This is just another pathetic attempt by CBS/Paramount to squeeze every last penny out of the consumer in a brutal economy. Shame on you, CBS/Paramount! I will be skipping this release!

3388127,5,B001675ZJW,I love the Jake and the Fatman series. I have purchased the first two seasons. I loved the show when it was on television. I am anxiously awaiting the release of the final 3 seasons. When will the complete series ever be released? I would buy the complete series even though I have the first two seasons already. I just want to be able to see every episode. It is a wholesome and Family show.,1419465600,,392,4.24

3388131,5,B001675ZJW,"I just discovered this series recently...as it wasn't a show that I watched as a child. However, I thoroughly enjoyed this set and would love to see the entire series available on dvd.
For now, only the first 2 seasons out of five are available on dvd. However, I'll keep my fingers crossed!
William Conrad and Joe Penny compliment each other very well and they make for a good pair in this series!
Conrad, just as in the series Cannon, is a man that you DON'T want to mess with! His appearance might fool you, but
his character is not a man you want to cross!
I enjoy Joe Penny in this series also...even moreso than his performance in the tv series Riptide!
William Conrad portrays a District Attorney and Joe Penny plays his private investigator/cop, Jake Styles.
William Conrad was a fantastic actor and he has a screen presence about him that demands attention and respect!
This series plays as a courtroom drama, private investigator and cop series all thrown into one!
The plots are very well-written and this show entertains! This is one of my new OLD favorites!
Check it out!",1414022400,,1084,4.6217616580310885

3388133,4,B001675ZJW,I have always enjoyed watching anything with Joe Penney and William Conrad and it makes you stop and think.  I miss these old shows.,1402358400,,132,4.5
3388134,1,B001675ZJW,cannot play it on my DVD player. should have been warned that these DVD may not suit all players. never had this trouble before with bought dVD. my player is not a cheap one and usually is compatable,1400976000,,199,4.2631578947368425
3388135,4,B001675ZJW,"Although I tire of the murder/police/PI shows that America seems to be stuck on during that era (Charlie's Angels, Hardy Boys, Remington Steele, Moonlighting, Magnum PI, Riptide, Matlock, Murder She Wrote, etc etc etc etc etc) this show was pretty interesting. It held my attention after all these years of sitting down to watch it. I probably never watched an entire episode back when it was on TV. Anyway the first season is definitely entertaining. The second season is a HUGE turnoff. They move the shooting to Hawaii. I hate Hawaiian culture and when shows move filming there like Charlie's Angels did. One weird thing . . . ""Jake""/Perry doesn't seem as macho now as he was built up to be back then. The Italian thing was kinda weak . . . when it was leaned on.",1395878400,,766,4.598540145985401

3388137,5,B001675ZJW,Its great to be able to see the shows in this series after so many  years .  It was a good series when it was current and still good these days too.  Thanks Amazon for making them available at a reasonable cost.,1374969600,,211,3.9761904761904763

3388139,4,B001675ZJW,"good action, some laughs,usual 80s-90s car chases, but it's typical CBS-Paramount rip-off HALF SEASONS FOR FULL PRICE!!!
WHEN WILL CBS LEARN????????",1363478400,,148,6.095238095238095
3388140,5,B001675ZJW,"Wonderful show, quality is ok, they could have done better, but I still enjoy watching it. Joe Penny of course is super eye candy!

3388142,4,B001675ZJW,"I loved Jake and the Fatman but was disappointed to learn that this was only part of the first season and not the whole first season.  The first season is a 2 volume separate set, which it did not state when I purchased it otherwise I would have gotten both DVDs.  I have since ordered volume 2 and can't wait for it to arrive today to start watching it.",1325548800,,354,4.115942028985507
3388143,3,B001675ZJW,"I guess I didn't really remember the show when it was on tv.....I always liked Penny & Conrad, but the show seemed to have something lacking, or maybe I should say corny going on.

The movie was in really good condition an arrived as promised, but I don't think I would recommend it to anyone else.",1296691200,,298,4.321428571428571

3388145,3,B001675ZJW,"Many questions about this show because I wasn't a big fans of it.  I thought it was basically a show for females.  Good looking Joe Penny and always serious in a funny sort of a way William Conrad carried a very ""vanilla"" show.  The show went for five years so I guess that might explain the dvd release, but why in volumes not seasons?  One favorite episode off this volume, but can think of a few other shows that rank dvd release dates more!  With that said, I hope shows get released in seasons oppose to season volumes!!!",1236038400,,526,4.326530612244898
3388146,5,B001675ZJW,"William Conrad and Joe Penny; a great combination in a genuinely sometimes funny always interesting take on the justice system when the bad guys got what was coming to them and the victim had people looking out for them.

Can't wait for the rest of the series to come out on dvd.",1229904000,,279,4.365384615384615
3388147,1,B001675ZJW,"This is just plain arrogance by CBS/Paramount. They take a show that was only moderately popular in the late 80s and almost obscure right now and try to rip off the few loyal fans of the show by splitting up the seasons while charging almost full price. Why in the world they split up the first season when it only aired 22 episodes!!! This is absurd. It is nothing but greed by CBS/Paramount. They realize that this the only chance for fans of the show to see it again and really want to make them pay for it. I mean, if the consumer bought both volumes, it amounts to over $70 for 22 episodes of a mediocre-at-best show. I'm also guessing that music has been altered and there are no special features. This is just another pathetic attempt by CBS/Paramount to squeeze every last penny out of the consumer in a brutal economy. Shame on you, CBS/Paramount! I will be skipping this release!

Grade of the Show: 3 stars. Grade of CBS/Paramount's release strategy: 1 star.",1228003200,10,969,4.505681818181818
