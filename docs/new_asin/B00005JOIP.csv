1539738,3,B00005JOIP,"The 3 stars (average) rating is a guess.

I haven't seen the Holiday Special myself but previous reviewers

imply that it would be appreciated most by people with young children

or strong Star Wars fans and collectors.

I would also like to add people who are simply curious.

I am one of the latter. I am not a Star Wars collector but I do

collect the films and see this title as part of them. I never got

to see this and I am sure the same is true for many other people.

All the reviews do tell you a lot of information about the Holiday

Special and everyone has a different take. Some like it and some don't.

Whether you do will depend on a lot of factors (age, taste, etc, etc)

but I think the title should be released at least.

Having a chance to buy or rent it will enable everyone who

wants to the chance to see it and judge for themselves.

So if you want to see it, or are curious, please register your

interest and you will receive an email from Amazon.com just to let you

know when or if it is released. This will depend on how many people

show any interest.",1142294400,4,1081,4.095693779904306
1539739,2,B00005JOIP,"Let my preface my review by saying that I actually do remember watching this as a wee lad back in 1978 and loving it.  Specifically, I remember that Han was trying to get Chewie home for Xmas (well, Life Day - what ever the hell that is) and that Chewie's tree-house dwelling family members were ""captured"" by storm troopers.  I also remember all the major characters being in it (except of course Governor Tarkin and Ben Kenobi who bought the farm in the movie).  Call it selective memory, but I LUCKILY didn't remember anything beyond this.  Seeing that I had fond childhood memories of this special, I was curious to see how it would play almost 30 years later.  Boy, was I surprised...

It starts off OK.  Our heroes, Han & Chewie are in the Falcon fleeing 2 imperial star destroyers (dj vu?).  The cockpit is the cheaped out TV version and actual movie footage of the space ships are used but no big deal.  At this point,  I'm just amazed that Harrison Ford agreed to this.  Obviously, stardom had not hit yet. And then Boo-yah!  They jump to hyper space and all is well.  Then the open credits role and announces the cast and ""special guests"":  Bea Arthur (what?), Harvey Corman (are you serious?), Art Carney (Norton in a galaxy far far away?), Dianne Carroll (who?) and the Jefferson Starship (no!!!!!!!!).  At this point, I'm thinking so far so good - maybe it won't be as bad as they say it is...............WRONG.

Back from commercial break, we go to the first scene at Chewie's tree house.  We are introduced to Chewie's family, wife = Mala, his cute yet annoying as hell son Lumpy (very creative name) and lumpy's perverted grandpa Itchy (OK, heads need to roll for this!).  Now begins the 15 plus minutes of pure torture with grunting wookies playing house.  Just when you think it can't get any worse Lumpy The Whiney goes for an electronic gadget.  Now we have to suffer through 10 minutes of Circus Solei type non-sense with jesters, jugglers and dancers.  BIZARRO WORLD times 100.  Note: whenever one of Chewie's family members go for an electronic gadget or gizmo, prepare to suffer.  Also note:  have the remote ready to fast forward through the things that are so bad, you will get nightmares if you watch them. Worth noting is the fact that after viewing this part of the show I got up and made myself a nice bourbon on the rocks.  Take that for what it's worth...............

After the viewer survives what just happened, I believe we are introduced the Art Carney the Space Trader.  I think he sells a nail clipper or something to a grumpy Imperial Officer.  It seems ""Norton"" is close to Chewie's family but more importantly, plays the comic relief role in the special. He pops up a few more times in the next hour plus and frankly, he annoyed me the least out of all the Special Guests.  Call me crazy, but I kind of liked Art Carney in this role!  He was given crap to work with and gave 110% effort. I loved the beer gut and the bi-focals too! CLASSIC.

 Next we go back to more annoying Wookie shenanigans. This time Itchy, who obviously got hit with the ugly stick, heads for an electronic gadget. NOOOO!!!!!!!!  This is where it gets really interesting.  Itchy attaches himself to this dream machine where your imagination runs wild.  In comes the sensual Diane Carroll as what I can only describe as a call girl in space.  It's borderline pornographic here.  Itchy is making noises that one should not hear on Network Television.  Soft core wookie porn is not my thing.  I actually got a kick out this part until she started to sing a never -ending song.  Time to hit the fast forward button again........................

I think at this point Chewie's family gets a video call from Princess Leia and C3p0 looking for Han & Chewie.  Relatively speaking, not a horrible scene really but Carrie Fisher has a mischievous look in here eyes (i.e coked off her gord no doubt).

Next, Luke Skywalker and R2-D2 check in via video to check on Han & Chewie's progress. SHOCKING MOMENT!  Mark Hamill is almost unrecognizable!  I'm guessing that this is one of his first appearances after that horrific car crash.  His eyes look weird and small and his nose, well rumor had it that he actually lost his nose in that accident (although never really confirmed).  Very disheartening actually.  He appears to be on pain killers or something too.  And the make-up - it's caked on big time covering huge scars I suppose.  So sad but interesting to see none the less.

OK, let's talk about Harvey Corman, funny man from the Carol Burnett show.  Not funny whatsoever.  In fact, every second of time he got was annoying and pointless. He gets the award for ""#1 Show Wrecker"" along with whoever wrote the crappy story.  Save yourself and fast forward thru every scene he is in.  Trust me............

I think at this point in the show, two imperial storm troopers and an imperial general come a knocking looking for rebels and what not.  They start harassing the wookies and trashing the place.  They even trash poor little Lumpy's room to bits (even his new toy!).  For some reason the scene where the stormtrooper trashed lumpy's room and toys sticks with me to this day.  This is probably where my feelings for the Empire went from dislike to hate.  Kudos to the guy that played the imperial general, he did a good job portraying a bad guy. I was hoping he would order the storm troopers to shoot either Lumpy or Itchy (or both).

Finally, we get something cool.  The cartoon that features our heroes and BOBA FETT.  You think that Boba may be a nice guy after all but in the end, we find out what side he is really on. Pretty cool.  Probably the best part of the special next to seeing Luke, Leia and Han act like idiots.

Next we go to Tatooine and the bar in Mos Eisley.  SO COOL.  All of the original characters are there: wolf-man dude , hammer head, the white bear thingee with one tooth, the dude that didn't like Luke, the band, the vampire guy etc etc.  In comes Bea Arthur as the bartender.  Real corny and stuff but when her ex-boyfriend, Harvey Corman the space alien, comes in you get the worst bit of television in the history of television.  FAST FORWARD NOW!  Corman leaves and you think the worst is over.  Wrong again!  Bea Arthur has to sing and dance around with the aliens.  WHY GOD, WHY?  Cut 10-15 minutes out of this scene and just have Bea offering a free last round of drinks and we are good to go.

To make a long review short,  Han & Chewie show up and save the day.  Han throws a storm trooper out of the tree house and all is well.  Han and Chewie embrace (real big hug - very curious???) and we get on with the queer Life Day celebration.  Anyway, we now have our heroes (han, leia, luke, R2, 3PO and Chewie back together again and here is when the show really shines.  The whole Life Day celebration is friggin ridiculous but the best part is when Princess Leia sings the Life Day song to the theme of Star Wars. HILARIOUS & CLASSIC TV MOMENT!

In conclusion, there' so much wrong with this special that I really could go on for hours about it.  It easily could have been cut down to 30 minutes (by cutting an hour plus of needless crap) and been a good little show for kids.  Really, the writers should be tarred and feathered for this pathetic effort.  Also, Lucas needs to take some blame here.  It's his franchise - He let them use his stars, his characters, clips from his movie, theme music from his movie, sound effects from his movie etc. Without a doubt, Lucas learned his lesson after this fiasco.  Oh, I forgot to mention Jefferson Starship because they suck and I fast forwarded thru that part..............

Was it worth seeing?  Hell ya.  At least for nostalgia purposes.  Now I know why Lucas wants to find and destroy every copy of this show!",1133308800,108,7806,4.510714285714286
1539740,3,B00005JOIP,"Why is it that it's easier to get the Holiday Special than the untampered  SW trilogy?

If you want to see the first appearence of Boba Fett then it's worth it, otherwise feel free to sit through 10 minutes of subtitle free Wookiee dialog. I'm just suprised the folks at Lucasfilm didn't splice in Mark Hamill's ""Luke, You'll be a Jedi Tonight"" dinner theater piece from the Simpsons, I would have given it an extra star and a nudge of respect.

On the other hand, it does have that train-wreck kind of appeal and is a good test of intestinal fortitude. You'll find out who your true friends are if they can watch this with you without violence ensuing.

Like arsenic, this can only be taken in small amounts at any given time so bring the pain.

PS, Mr Lucas, if you happen to read this, if you can make Greedo shoot first then you can get rid of Mr Hamill's overindulgence of mascara. He looked like he was auditioning for Motly Crue that same day.",1125100800,5,950,4.375
1539741,5,B00005JOIP,"Where does one begin...

A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, some fella at 20th Centruy Fox thought it would be a great idea to promote the hit movie Star Wars, keep the fans happy as they waited for Empire Strikes Back and make a few bucks in the process.

So, while twisting George's arm painfully behind his back, using stock FX footage and an AWFUL script he got produced what is the FIRST sequel to Star Wars, the very beginnings of Star Wars on the small screen (now its new home) and the first appearances of Boba Fett, Kashyyyk, Princess Leia and Bea Arthur's singing voices, Jefferson Starship actually in space and Harrison Fords embarrassed face, surely ruing the day he said ""You can type this **** but you can't say it."".

It is as much Star Wars as the ORIGINAL cinema versions of the trilogy (not the make-over versions we get now) and as such SHOULD be released asap.  The fans made this series of films as beloved as they are, and stuff like this, as cringeful as it is (and GOD is it awful) really should be out there, with a commentary by George and the cast, and treated with the good humour it deserves.

1539903,1,B00005JOIP,"In 2003, Barbra Streisand attempted to have unauthorized photographs of her home removed from the Internet.  Not only was she unsuccessful, but the resulting attention caused by her efforts led to the photos being more widely disseminated than they would have been if she'd ignored them.

George Lucas managed to create the same effect with regard to ""The Star Wars Holiday Special,"" by attempting to buy up and destroy every copy.  This has made it a collector's item, when it would have been nothing more than an obscure oddity, known only to the most obsessed ""Star Wars"" fanatics, if he'd simply left it alone.

As for the quality of the storyline, such as it is, it's abysmal, even within the context of the confused mish-mash that comprises the entire ""Star Wars"" franchise.  It reminds me of the scene in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-World/dp/B000ZLJOW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost World</a>&nbsp;where Scarlett Johanssen, in commenting on a band's performance, says ""this is so bad it's almost good,"" to which Thora Birch replies, ""this is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again.""

Lucas himself has clarified that ""Star Wars"" was never intended for adults - which the ""Holiday Special"" makes abundantly clear - but there's no reason why children's television programming must be so irredeemably awful.

My copy, recorded on videotape when the special was first broadcast, later transferred to DVD, has the image and sound quality on par with the acting, script, and production values.

1539912,1,B00005JOIP,"I'm a young guy who's also a scholar ( linguist, anthropologist).

I just read the Wikipedia article on this, watched the ""Nostalgia Critic"" review of it, and read around the internet for some thoughts on it.  I read a few of the Amazon reviews.  Everyone seems to think very similar things about it, but I have a different perspective.

Recently I've been doing work documenting, deciphering, and developing the made-up languages and pseudo-made-up languages in The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), Forbidden Planet (1956), and The Land of the Lost (1974-1977), and studying what went into them and why they were the way they were.

One of the things that I've found is that audience and creative crew expectations vary from year to year and decade to decade.  Wikipedia says that at the time, this was critically panned.  But did audiences like it?  My guess is that they probably did, based on what I've seen of 70's white and black variety shows.

My guess is that if you do enough research about TV, sci-fi, technology, and predictions of future technology, THS would come out looking a lot better and make a ton more sense.  I just read on Wikipedia that cable TV was invented in the early 1980's, so this format is comparable to the ""internet"" sequences in ""Starship Troopers"" which I have heard from international friends, were pretty cool at the time.  The extended Wookie dialogue sequences and the concept of showing a Wookie family in action are reminiscent of the father, mother, son family of Pakuni ( neanderthal-like people) from ""Land of the Lost"".  ( Many elements of the very-popular ""Land of the Lost"" were imitated by the ""Star Wars"" creative team, as well as Michael Crichton, ""Ghostbusters"", and others.  Season 2 of that series featured very long sequences of Pakuni dialogue which were not titled.  These were probably included for psychedelic ""value"", as it seems from my research that a lot of Americans were watching TV while stoned.  Another consideration is that THS was probably geared toward children and so was sloppily put together - kids were known as being more tolerant of inane programming.

I can imagine with the air date - Nov 17 1978, between Star Wars May 25, 1977 and Empire May 21, 1980 - that Lucas wanted to drum up some money and try to keep Star Wars in the minds of the American public.  The format chosen - like a variety show - was probably meant to appeal to families, not just children, and is somewhat consistent with the known Krofft Production children's works - 1969 to 1977 - was containing content appealing to stoners, people who used illegal drugs.  THS reminds me of what I've seen of 77-80 Star Wars comics - reminiscent of Flash Gordon and other past and contemporary works of similar genres.  Them holding disco balls and being transported to another plane where wookies are gathering around a Life Tree is similar to ""beaming up"" in Star Trek and also to getting stoned and various New Age concepts about inter-dimensional travel and drug use.

A lot of THS would be lost on audiences who didn't live in the 70s because it references TV and movies ( and probably current events ) from back then.  This is a big problem in the study of ancient media - going all the way back to Sumerian narratives - the problem of how much is in-jokes and references to things which haven't survived or which we just haven't read.  I recently read that ""H R Pufnstuf"" contained a lot of this - voices and characters of the residents of ""The Land of the Living"" were parodies of various Hollywood characters which parents and grandparents at the time would have recognized.  In-jokes can be really well done, but if the time comes when it takes a lot of scholarship to get them, something has been lost.

I and the Nostalgia Critic were especially surprised at Chewie's gift.  Similar to this is the circus act performed on the holo-chess board.  But the year was 1978 and the idea was probably that this would go over kids' heads and register with parents and other grown-up viewers.  Such things in TV and newspaper ad's are known from the 70's, and have roots going back, with decreasing intensity, back to 1400 and beyond.  At the time, it probably wasn't as shocking as it is now, as we're expecting family-friendly fare.  But I don't watch TV at all and am out of touch with what people will tolerate.  I later came to dislike Star Wars for its disconnect from traditional Christianity and the ways in which it reflects Hollywood atheism and adultery.  In their description of Hollywood folks, the South Park guys got it the most right of any I've read.

But I've got to give it 1 star because it ends up being more immodest than the original trilogy or prequels.

Here's my thoughts on the Disney Star Wars : I think they're going to be financially sucessful, but I think that they're going to be disappointing more than awesome, on a whole lot of levels.  I did see the Star Trek Re-Boot and am not impressed by the chosen director, not matter how good his box office is.  But one thing to keep in mind, when viewing anything or considering it, is that there's a logic that all TV and movies and books and media follow, whether they're sucessful or not, they reflect current trends in media-creation as well as past works which did well and are known to the creators.  Subtle understanding of movies is mostly lost on the vast majority - as with all the people who hated ""Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull"" - who see things only from one or more modern trendy viewpoints.  ""Crystal Skull"" was too ""camp"" for some modern tastes; THS is somewhat like that, too.

That version gets five stars. These guys will do more than bourbon or scotch to make watching this enjoyable.

The special itself, crappy as it is, is not spectacularly crappy.  If you do get to watch it, I hope you watch a version with all the commercials, as these will put it in context. Surely nothing else on TV at the time- the forgetten sitcom ""Flying High"" (Three's Company on a plane?  High on what, exactly?), ""Dolly's"" Holiday Special (or was it a weekly variety show?), The Wild Geese- Rated R.- none of the toys being sold that Christmas- Tobor is robot spelled backwards- not even the commercials aimed at adults- two for GM that mention ""vehicles"" and not ""cars,"" a hilariously jingoistic (and low budget) Whirlpool ad- none of it suggests that Americans in 1978 had very high standards for Holiday specials, or for anything else.  I especially liked the Pilsbury Plus cake mix ad, which showed housewives lustily sticking forkfuls of cake into their mouths, ""There's more in the middle of an Egg McMuffin than the egg in the middle of the muffin,"" which never caught on like ""two all beef patties.,"" and the Contac ad, with the capsule breaking apart, and the little globules of ""medicine"" spilling out.

As far as I'm concerned, J. Kenary's review is spot on.  I would have made an ""Ed Norton got fat"" joke- Art Carney looks like he swallowed Jackie Gleason.  Speaking of MST3K, his 'bit' in the shop he runs was a little like the famous ""invention exchange.""  And I for one, did not think the Boba Fet cartoon was a high point, although I probably did in 1978.

Watching this thirty-five years later was a trip.  It was like stepping into a time machine, only one about as limited in function as ""Tobor.""  That is, it would only go back to one night, in 1978, and you could only repeat what you did that night- namely, watch the Star Wars Holiday Special.

This is one just for the fans, and mostly notable because they introduced Boba Fett, and IIRC, they trotted out the action figure of Fett at Christmas 1978.

The plot revolves around Han and Chewie trying to get Chewie home to visit his family, at the time I figured they were having a sort of Thanksgiving celebration. There are some odd scenes of the Wookies talking in their language, and no subtitles to tell you what they are discussing.

As strange as it sounds, I would love to see it again.",1383264000,,648,4.252032520325203
1539969,1,B00005JOIP,"The suspension of disbelief is required for any fiction but more is needed as the scenarios presented diverge from real life. For the Star Wars Holiday Special, this works on several levels. One has to pretend that there really are Wookies, a planet called Kashyyyk, and Art Carney being overly social but one is also tempted to disbelieve that anybody could have produced such an astonishingly bad 97 minutes of adequate acting, terrible writing, mystifying musical interludes, bad jokes, and surreal filming. Knowing that the actress who played Leia was on cocaine during the filming raises the possibility the writers were on drugs as well (because we don't want to believe sober and sane people could come up with anything like this).

The special follows the family of Chewbacca waiting for him to return to celebrate Life Day. The meaningfulness of the day is never explained and it can only be inferred that it is similar to ordinary Americans' desire to be with their family on Thanksgiving. That the family has a mother, son, and grandfather living together in what looks to be a peaceful domestic environment certainly dates it and adds to the difficulty of accepting the scene as real. The lack of subtitles for the Wookie dialogue also means that we cannot relate to the characters based on the ideas they are trying to convey and can only guess at it from their gestures and actions. The efforts to present futuristic computer communication seems quite outdated but can be forgiven along with the melodramatic music. The costuming was excellent for the time and, apart from some stiffness in the faces, compares favorably with costumes in modern movies.

The Empire obviously wants to catch Han Solo, Chewbacca, and any Rebels they can. This would seem more of a threat if the Imperial troopers tried acting calm. Instead, one watches an overweight Imperial officer get distracted by the entertainment of the family they are searching, wander around without minimal attention to security, and random and senseless acts vandalism without realistic or dramatic justification.

The overarching plot of the family waiting for Chewbacca and getting harassed by the Empire is only a vehicle for the writers to insert all sorts of little acts into the show. These include an awkward semi-pornographic ""singing"" interlude with a holograph of Dianne Caroll (in a children's show no less), a comedic take on Julia Child presented by Harvey Korman, a video assembly guide presented by Korman acting as a robot, another appearance of Korman, the Mos Eisly Cantina somehow appearing on Kashyyyk due to sloppy editing, and an appearance of Art Carney (whose acting comes as a relief despite the bad writing). These are largely unconnected scenes strung together with the flimsiest of excuses.

There are moments in the special which are better than the show's reputation but which are still bad, just not the abysmal wreck the show is remembered as. The cartoon that is the first introduction of Bobba Fett is not actually well written, it is however one of the best parts of special despite some very odd animation of Han Solo and has developed a following. Harvey Korman's acts and the Cantina song deserved some credit for good acting but the context of their scenes destroyed any quality they might have had.

The ending with a surreal (and unexplained) celebration of Life Day coupled with Leia singing platitudes in a drug-induced haze reminds one of the inexplicable ending to 2001: A space Odyssey and jolts the viewer out of any connection to the scene that might have remained.

Individual acts deserve better than one star but the terrible writing, bad editing, and abused format deserve no stars. This is most useful as a study in how not to produce a show and may its failures teach future generations what to avoid. Certainly George Lucas learned his lesson.",1383004800,,3871,4.984520123839009

1540042,2,B00005JOIP,"I have come to like the Star Wars Holiday Special

Its incredibly strange. I read in a cover feature on the Special in SFX magazine that Lucas didn't really have too much input with the plot, which perhaps explains why nothing really happens

But if you enjoy it for what it is (Star Wars as variety show) I think its quite good. The music is ok (Jefferson Starship in a Star Wars tv show is incredibly strange, but the tune they do is not bad)

Some parts are very odd indeed (many of the scenes are just Wookies talking, and though you can figure out what they're on about, incredibly strange again)

There were worse tv shows (anyone ever see Pink Lady and Jeff) but the Star Wars Holiday Special was so very odd. Whats with the cartoon? (The first appearance of Boba Fett in the Star Wars universe btw!)

Whats with Boba Fett singing a song to clear out her bar? and whats with Harvey Korman wooing her?

I like Harvey Korman. Hes a talented man, and he was a hoot in Blazing Saddles. But here hes totally wasted. Its rather like watching a car accident, his bits (he plays the chef on the tv that Mora imitates, then a couple other bits later on)

I mentioned the cartoon - the cartoon is quite good, but it doesn't really fit. Thats the trouble with the Holiday Special and why I'm only giving it a couple of stars: much of it doesn't really fit. Theres musical guests, and an (endless) acrobat performance that Lumpy very much enjoys, and an Itchy masturbation scene (when hes watching this chick tell him hes very sexy). Its all so very odd..

There are classic bits. The intro is ace - you've got Hans and Chewie outrunning some ships, trying to get Chewbacca home for Life Day (something to do with the Tree of Life or something, I didn't quite get what it was all about!)

And you've got the original actors too (R2D2 as R2D2). Nice to see Leia, and Luke, and Han

But its so very odd. It really is. My superego is telling me to give this one star, but I think its better than Phantom Menace although some of the singing here I can certainly do without (Carrie Fisher.. gulp!)

And it is possible to enjoy the Star Wars Holiday Special. It helps if you're drunk. I remember one time with my friend Adam when we were crumpling up newspapers and throwing them at the screen, then just fast forwarding to the commercials

But its a definite grower. The first time you watch it CAN be painful, but you give it a chance; as I said, enjoy it for what it was, a variety show in the Star Wars universe with just a sliver of plot (Hans and Chewie trying to get home for Life Day)

Considering, thats more plotwise than the recent Star Wars Clone War film (Anakin and apprentice saving Jabba the Hutt's son - rubbish film)

Stick to the Holiday Special on those nights when you just need a laugh, just need something to bend your brain and you can't find any of your Residents albums!

PS the Star Wars song is utter crap. Try to fast forward through that bit at the end when Carries singing. Harrison Ford looks particularly pained while shes singing btw!",1227139200,,3057,4.357394366197183

1540047,3,B00005JOIP,"( Review written by Ted Buchanan )

It's been 30 years since this 'Holiday' Special aired on network TV and
it only aired once-For a reason! It has since become legendary as an almost forgotten piece of Star Wars history. If only Lucas could forget!(The rumor is that he tried in vain to delete the master tapes) Bootleg VHS copies have circulated for years, but I was lucky enough to find the European DVD on E-Bay. I probably paid too much for it, but I am a rabid Star Wars fan.
First off, there are two reasons to get the DVD: Boba Fett's Cartoon and The Cantina Band scene with Walrus-man, Snaggletooth,Hammerhead, and all the other 'regulars'. I loved it as a kid in 1978 and I got the biggest kick watching it again after all this time.

The basic premise is simple: Chewbacca'a family is waiting for him to come home and visit for Christmas,( changed to 'Life Day') hoping that the Imperials won't drop in and ruin the party. Of course, the evil stormtroopers do drop in looking for Chewie and his rebel friends and they ransack little Lumpy's room. One Death Squad commander even decapitates Lumpy's Bantha toy and then screams at poor Lumpy, ""Go clean your room!!""  It's halarious, but the writers didn't mean for it to be funny. That's the problem with the entire show: We burst out laughing at the wrong scenes! Good 'ol Space Trader Norton ( Art Carney) is the comic relief, but his outdated comedy schtick falls flat. The writers and special FX people ( which include Rick Baker, Tom Burman , and Stan Winston)had to be stoned when they created this show. Just watch the 'silly toy' sequence with the red and green Oompah-Loompah inspired acrobats!

Meanwhile, Harrison Ford and Peter Mayhew are on their way to visit, but have to repeat their spaceship scenes from the movie first. The only real difference being the low-budget Falcon set that stands in for the big screen version. Mark Hammil returns as Luke and gets 'smoked out' by R2-D2 in a lame engine-repair scene( or was that a Tusken made bong?) Carrie Fisher also returns as Leia but looks a bit tipsy when we first see her. (What was in those plastic Cantina glasses, anyway?) Anthony Daniels does his best with R2, but can't save the show from cheeseball musical numbers and droning, unfunny sketches. Even poor Chewbacca looks completely high when we flash back thru his mind and see all those cool clips from the movie!

Finally, one has to wonder how they got all the main actors to return for this head-trip experience. This was before Empire and Jedi, and Ford's career taking off at light speed after Indiana Jones. The producers and writers and actors must have been taking mind-altering drugs to create this trainwreck. One scene stands out in particular: Itchy, Chewbacca's elderly Wookie-father, is given a Christmas gift-A 'microchip' that induces a seductive virtual-reality 'fantasy' in the form of a goregous woman who writhes in tin-foil costuming. This gets Itchy so sexually excited that he can barely sit still in his chair! Itchy's moaning and groaning must have slipped right by the network censors. The other scenes in the Cantina with Bea Arthur nuzzling a giant rat is priceless as is the Death Squad Commander grooving to Jefferson Starship!

The climax ends with Chewie and Solo finally arriving for dinner and ambushing a stormtrooper who is angry that he got left behind so he smashes Lumpy's video games and is forced to watch never-ending out-takes from the Star Wars movie. Solo does a 70's style 'fake-out' move and the lone trooper falls for it, literally, over the wooden fence and into the rainforest. Han then awkwardly says he has to 'get going someplace' and tosses the troopers' blaster over the broken wooden fence.(Later, we see that this fence somehow got repaired while the Wookies were in church!) Ford's acting is actually very sincere as we then travel with the Wookies to another dimension wearing red robes. This 'Wookie-church' scene is wierd, but things get even stranger with Carrie Fisher belting out a somewhat sober 'Life Day' song at the very end.

1540120,5,B00005JOIP,"Why 5 stars?  What were we Rotten Reviewers thinking?  It seems unfair to penalize the creators of ""Star Wars"" for a mistake they perpetrated, but also ones that fans preserved and propagated.  Yes, the ""Star Wars Holiday Special"" is a horrible mistake, an utter train-wreck to watch.  Never officially released on video, it would have vanished into obscurity had its release occurred before the advent of home video recorders.  Now ofcourse, those who've somehow gotten their hands on this ""too bad for even MST3K"" can provenance their copy by watching for the all-important ""station identification"" label.  (My first copy hails from Kansas City, as revealed mid-way through the all-important animated short.)  Thanks to bootlegs and sci-fi conventions, those attached to this holiday-time horror can never escape their ignominy - they have been forced to relive their worst nightmare, become the victim of their own worst holiday special.  So the answer is, 0 stars for quality, five sympathy stars.

So how bad is it?  It's tempting to excuse TSWHS by admitting that all holiday specials are inherently evil, and that they age poorly even when compared to sit-coms and variety shows.  It's also tempting to consider how negligible TSWHS's faults would appear had SW itself not become such a legend - and comparisons would have been inevitable.  Neither of those theories, however, answers the overarching question of ""why"" it was made.  It appears that nobody knew why they were making a holiday show based on SW, and that instead of trying to find out, simply threw the same lame elements of similar celebrity specials over a threadbare Star Wars story.

The result?  A bag of tricks that's utterly painful to watch.  It's not like one of those character-building trials, like running a marathon for the first time, or climbing mount Everest - TSWHS is one of those debilitating experiences that makes you feel like you've shortened your life, with even the arguably good parts somehow suffused with embarrassing mistakes.

Wrap-around story - it's holiday time for Chewbacca's family, as we see in repeated and extended scenes containing nothing but Wookie grunts for dialog.  Had these guys forgotten ""2001""?  It only came out ten years earlier!  Despite the lack of dialog, we can tell what's going on when Chewbacca's father plugs into some VR porn (which beams Diahann Carrol's words of love directly into Grampa Wookie's cranium, in a scene that must be seen to be believed), or when Chewie's wookie offspring watches a holographic performance of Mummenschanz (talk about dating).

We've got a nonsensical animated short that's probably more fun today because it's a time capsule of what animated sci-fi looked like before it was taken over by Anime.  (Unfortunately, it falls out in the second half of the special, so it's too late to be a time capsule for the part of the special that wasn't irreparably bad.)

We've got Art Carney as Trader Saundan - a nutty traveling merchant whose bumbling manners get him past any imperial stormtroopers, but also make him practically useless.  Presaging Jar-Jar Binks by over 20 years, Carney is at one point reduced to channeling Ed Norton into his performance (an annoyed Imperial even barks ala Ralph Kramden ""Will You Get On With It!!?"").

We've got the wickedly great Harvey Korman who suffers by having to adapt numerous roles - a multi-limbed alien cook suggesting Julia Child; a soft-hearted bar patron who drinks through an aperture at the top of his head; an ""Amorphian"" who constantly runs out of energy - none of which tap into the man's comedic timing demonstrated on ""Carol Burnett"" or his films with Mel Brooks.

We've got Jefferson Airplane singing ""Light the Sky on Fire"" - it's actually a decent song, but the oversized `70's microphones meant to suggest lightsabres...unfortunately suggest something else.  We've got Bea Arthur singing!  And once your eardrums have forgiven you, we've got Carrie Fisher singing as well.

We've got low production values, horrible direction, bad jokes, painfully bad dialog, and (for a musical) hideous music - all of which remind us that while the legend of ""Star Wars"" may be timeless, it's still a product of the 1970's.

TSWHS may be unwatchable for many reasons, but there's one overarching reason for its utter badness.  While SW the saga was about a brave band of freedom fighters seeking to liberate the galaxy, TSWH is about a family of Wookies who do little more than the SW-universe's equivalent of watching TV and playing video games - it's basically an unintended and unflattering parody of people sitting through inane holiday specials.",1164758400,27,4653,5.058977719528178
1540121,1,B00005JOIP,"In the pantheon of projects which must have seemed like a good idea at the time, few reign more ignobly than a truly disastrous attempt at cashing in on one of the biggest movies of all.

Yes, Virginia, there is a ""Star Wars Holiday Special.""

As the public mania caused by the original ""Star Wars"" was peaking back in 1978, 20th Century Fox proposed a television special starring the film's main cast. George Lucas originally approved the idea but took his name off the credits after many unwanted revisions, including relegating most of the cast to brief appearances.

The result is so terrible it is both repellent and attractive, holding all the morbid fascination of a bloody car wreck. Nothing works, the brain-dead dialogue often borders on pure incoherence, the supposed action is virtually nonexistent and the whole thing seems to be some surreal fever dream.

The story, such as it is, begins with Han Solo attempting to get his sidekick Chewbacca home for ""Life Day,"" the Wookiee version of Christmas. (All together now: ""I'll be hoooome for Life Day..."") In pursuit of this lofty goal, the two of them take on terrifyingly vast numbers of ""Star Wars"" film clips, only some of which match what is actually happening. Meanwhile, back on the Wookiee home planet of Kazzook (!), Chewie's wife Malla awaits her husband's return, accompanied by her father-in-law Itchy (!!) and her son Lumpy (!!!). In what is evidently supposed to pass for a family atmosphere, the three of them grunt and growl at each other for minutes on end - without subtitles, of course, so we never really know what they are supposed to be saying. For all we know, they could be complaining about how Chewie got a great movie role and they're stuck in this TV show.

In the door stride Imperial troopers, supposedly on a mission to track down hidden Rebels except they often take a break to watch TV. And just to prove how nasty they are, they wreck Lumpy's toys and then sneer at him to ""go clean up your room."" In the midst of all this, Lumpy turns on what appears to be the distant ancestor of a video iPod to watch a hideously animated cartoon featuring the voices of the film's main cast and the first appearance of bad-guy bounty hunter Boba Fett.

Occasionally interrupting this riveting saga are ""guest stars"" Art Carney, Harvey Korman, Diahann Carroll, Bea Arthur and the band Jefferson Starship, presenting between them a sort of intergalactic ""Gong Show"" minus Chuck Barris. Carroll's bit is easily the most mortifying of the lot, as she appears to Itchy in a ""mind evaporator"" recording of what can only be called early virtual-reality porn. ""I am your fantasy,"" she coos as the Wookiee grunts with desire and the viewer cringes with embarrassment. ""I am your experience, so experience me. I am your pleasure. Enjoy me. This is our moment together in time that we might turn this moment into an eternity."" One wonders how parents explained it to their kids without warping them for life.

Not that the others do any better. Korman humiliates himself in several roles, including that of a manic alien TV chef (think Julia Child with extra arms) baking something repulsively called ""Wookiee Ookiees."" Arthur, still under the impression that she can sing even after croaking her way through ""Mame,"" appears as a bartender who clears out her Tatooine establishment by singing and dancing everyone out the door. Carney plays a Rebel sympathizer with a ""who me?"" act so incredibly transparent even Inspector Clouseau would have nailed him in seconds but which the Imperials just don't seem to notice. (With troopers this dumb, no wonder the Rebels kicked the Empire's behind.) Only the band escapes relatively unscathed, and that's just because they sing an admittedly forgettable song and nothing else.

Also appearing from time to time are people who appeared in the 1977 film. Harrison Ford is evidently concentrating not on acting the part but rather how best to dismember his agent for getting him into this. Mark Hamill, the facial scars he received in a car accident not yet written into ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" shows up caked with enough makeup to smother small animals. James Earl Jones provides the voice of Darth Vader in a brief film clip very badly dubbed with new dialogue. And a visibly stoned Carrie Fisher stutters her lines while tripping over scenery and gazing off into space.

With disaster all around, one can be forgiven for wishing the Empire would blow everything to smithereens just to put an end to this travesty. But since this is a holiday show, a happy ending is guaranteed, and one is provided as Han and Chewie arrive just in time to save the day. With everyone rescued, we are treated to a head-scratchingly strange clip of Wookiees walking through space (without spaceships, one should add) to a bright star where the Tree of Life is guarded by other Wookiees in red robes.

Luke, Leia, Han, C-3PO and R2-D2 magically appear to celebrate Life Day with their furry friends, and Leia wraps everything up by trying to sing, allegedly to the tune of John Williams' title theme, a heartwarming holiday tribute. ""A day,"" she warbles somewhat off-key, ""that brings the promise that one day we'll be free to live, to laugh, to dream, to grow, to trust, to love, to be."" And as Chewie, with the aid of those ever-present film clips, reminisces on the events of ""Star Wars,"" the show mercifully draws to a close.

The show aired once - and only once - to such scathing reviews that Lucas instantly ordered it pulled from rerun schedules and sealed off deep in the Lucasfilm vaults. The intervening decades have not seasoned his initial reaction. ""If I had the time and a sledgehammer,"" he once told a fan convention, ""I would track down every copy of that show and smash it."" Needless to say, an official DVD or even VHS release is just not to be.

But the special lives on, thanks to a then brand-new gadget known as a VCR. The show was taped off a number of TV stations and circulated by fans of all things ""Star Wars"" as well as fans of all things bizarrely awful. Today, with the show having achieved a warped sort of cult status, digitized recordings varying widely in image and sound quality can be downloaded off the Internet to be appreciated (?) by a new generation of fans.",1155600000,12,6296,4.750228728270814
1540122,1,B00005JOIP,"It's one of the greatest unsolved mysteries of our time.  Officially, it's known as the Star Wars Holiday Special, but I like to refer to it as the Night the Force Went out on Tatooine.  Many an intimidated witness will tell you that it never really happened, a secret government investigation concluded that those who claim to have seen it actually saw swamp gas, and George Lucas certainly isn't talking.  What really happened the night of November 17, 1978?  Was it really just a misguided attempt to keep Star Wars alive in the minds of fans waiting for The Empire Strikes Back?  Was it a hoax?  A mindless prank played on George Lucas?  A Communist plot?  Or something even more insidious?

Despite the best efforts of authorities, tapes of this unworldly event do exist - I have seen it, my friends.  OK, I admit it was a low-quality copy, somewhat fuzzy and impossible to examine closely, but I have every reason to believe what I saw was a recording of a real event.  Any analysis of the tape is difficult at best, as it seems to make less sense than Samara's tape in The Ring, so I'll just describe a few of the horrors I witnessed.

Part Star Wars flashbacks, part variety show, part reality show - all disaster - the Star Wars Holiday Special features the likes of Art Carney, Diahann Carroll, Bea Arthur, and Jefferson Starship.  It is ostensibly about Chewbacca's attempt to get home to his family on Kashyyyk in time to celebrate Life Day.  Chewy is overdue, as he and Han Solo have encountered some unfriendly Imperial forces on their way home in the Millennium Falcon.  That leaves us stuck watching Chewy's family (his wife Malla, his father Itchy, and his son Lumpy) grunting to one another as they go about whatever it is Wookiees do at home - for a good ten to fifteen minutes!  Highlights include Lumpy being forced to take out the trash, Itchy barking at Lumpy for running around playing with his toy fighter, Lumpy amusing himself by watching a tabletop video of the galaxy's worst circus, and - lest I forget - Lumpy's daredevil rail-walking exhibition.  Ever wondered how to make Bantha Surprise?  Do what Malla does - follow the recipe of famous television chef Gormaanda (Harvey Korman).  Did I mention the fact that the only actual communication going on all this time involves Wookiees grunting back and forth to one another?  Eventually, a worried Malla starts calling around to see if anyone has word of Chewy's whereabouts, thereby dragging Luke, R2-D2, C3PO, and Princess Leia into this disaster in the making.

Things take a turn for the creepy when Saun Dann (Art Carney) shows up with Life Day gifts for everyone.  Here we learn that Itchy is a apparently a dirty old Wookiee, as he takes great delight in firing up his ""Mind Evaporator"" unit and watching his fantasy woman, Mermeia (Diahann Carroll), perform a psychedelic video to a perfectly forgettable song.  This scene is just disturbing, on several levels.  Moving along, Imperial stormtroopers arrive looking for Chewbacca, search the house, and intentionally break one of Lumpy's toys, thereby giving us the one and only remotely human moment in the entire show.  Then, somehow or other, we end up watching a Jefferson Starship video and, a little later, a cartoon featuring the very first appearance of Boba Fett.  Then there's the infamous cantina scene from Life on Tatooine, apparently the Emperor's favorite show.  Just try to guess who the new proprietor of the cantina is now.  Yes, it's Bea Arthur - and she sings (when she isn't being romanced by Harvey Korman), thereby ruining all of the fun cantina memories of children everywhere.  I won't tell you if Chewy makes it home or not, but I can tell you that Princess Leia breaks out into song before the credits mercifully roll - a Life Day carol to the tune of the Star Wars theme song.  If all this sounds bad, believe me when I say I have barely scratched the surface.

Why?  How do we explain what is arguably the most ridiculous two hours in network television history?  Frankly, that whole ""trying to keep audiences familiar with these characters as the world waits for The Empire Strikes Back"" theory just doesn't hold water.  This special, if it did anything, drove fans away from the Lucas fold.  Perhaps Lucas was worried that the second film would be a complete dud and thus tried to lower expectations among the fan base.  Maybe he made some enemies at CBS, and they tried to sabotage his entire career.  Here's what really bothers me, though - I don't remember watching this special in 1978.  As an eight-year-old Star Wars freak, there is simply no way I would have missed anything even remotely related to Star Wars.  So why don't I, and countless others, remember this special?  1978 - isn't that about the time we started hearing about alien abductions?  Could it be that benevolent members of an alien race came to Earth to wash these awful Star Wars Holiday Special memories out of our fragile little minds so that we might have a chance of growing up sane?  Makes you think, doesn't it?  That still doesn't explain why this video was made, though.  You didn't hear it from me, but my research has led me to the startling conclusion that the Star Wars Holiday Special was actually an offshoot of Project Montauk - it was nothing less than a top-secret government experiment to slow down time, based on the theories of Nicola Tesla.  And guess what?  It worked.  Anyone brave enough to admit having watched the two-hour program will tell you that the show had to have been at least eight hours long.",1154390400,23,5571,4.707644628099174
1540123,1,B00005JOIP,"Among STAR WARS fans, nothing brings forth such a grimace as placing these five words in a single sentence: THE STAR WARS HOLIDAY SPECIAL.  Still, it's a sort of legend amongst fans.  It's become one of the most sought-after DVDs around, showing up only as bootlegs because George Lucas has famously stated, ""If I had the time and a sledgehammer, I would track down every bootlegged copy of that program and smash it.""  Lucas also attempted to purchase every master copy of the program, to make sure it would never be broadcast again.  This was not just the move of a filmmaker who feared the destruction of his work's reputation.  It was the move of a concerned humanitarian, fearing for the health of all humankind.  You see, I have seen many terrible films, but out of all of them, THE STAR WARS HOLIDAY SPECIAL takes the cake as the all-time worst.

The premise, or what little of it there is, involves Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford) attempting to return to Chewie's home planet for ""Life Day"".  Life Day appears to be the wookie form of Christmas, though it closer resembles Hanukkah, as - at the end of the movie - Chewbacca and his family don huge red robes, travel to some misty place in the stars, and hold up shining orbs.

Unfortunately for the viewer, Chewie and Han do not return home until about fifteen minutes before the end of the movie.  For the rest of the film, we are subjected to numerous forms of torture.  During the first thirty minutes of the film, we are left with Chewbacca's family (doting mother Malla, cantankerous old grandfather Itchy, and troublesome child Lumpy), the members of which proceed to growl and grumble in their native tongue.  Diahann Carroll shows up as a hologram which flirts with Itchy, much to his apparent pleasure.  Jefferson Starship appears to perform their song ""Light The Sky On Fire"" as a bewildered Imperial trooper watches.  Art Carney makes some jokes which, I suppose, some three-year-olds may find humorous, had they the courage to sit through forty minutes of this.  Beatrice Arthur plays a bartender at the Mos Eisley Cantina who decides to sing with the alien drunks.  Harvey Korman also appears as a frighteningly eccentric four-armed chef, who teaches Malla - yes, the wookie - how to cook ""Bantha Surprise"".  Of course, THE STAR WARS HOLIDAY SPECIAL also has its good moments.

Oh, wait - no it doesn't.

If the show did have a good moment, it would be a cartoon made by the animators who would later produce the 80's cartoons DROIDS and EWOKS.  This short cartoon is worth nothing because it introduced one of the most popular characters of the STAR WARS universe - Boba Fett.  It's a very interesting segment indeed, and the only thing which makes this pile of Bantha poodoo worth watching.

At times, THE STAR WARS HOLIDAY SPECIAL is laughably bad, but for the most part, it's just horrifying.  How could anything this bad EVER be shown on television?  How could anything this bad come from the STAR WARS universe?  How could anything this bad EXIST?  Friends, I have seen MANOS, THE HANDS OF FATE - often cited as the worst movie ever made - and THE STAR WARS HOLIDAY SPECIAL makes MANOS look like CASABLANCA.  There is an absolutely absurb script, filled with terrible dialogue.  The acting is atrocious.  Carrie Fisher sings a song about the joys of ""Life Day"" to the tune of the STAR WARS theme.

Need I say more?

Having heard so much about this TV-movie atrocity over the years, I found it to be quite an ... INTERESTING experience to finally see it.  I would recommend that every STAR WARS diehard give it a watch, as it is an important (and notorious) part of the series' history.  Anyone else would be insane to come within a mile of it.  I'm glad that Uncle George didn't destroy every copy of this - but I certainly sympathize with him.",1150848000,11,3843,4.652818991097923
1540124,3,B00005JOIP,"When the ""classic"" versions of the original Star Wars trilogy were remastered and released on VHS and laserdisc back in 1995, the advertising tagline was ""The Original...One Last Time.""  Following the 1997 theatrical release of the ""Special Edition"" versions of the original trilogy, and their subsequent appearance on VHS and DVD, a small but annoyingly persistant and vocal legion of Star Wars fans has demanded that George Lucas rerelease the original cuts of the films on DVD, something that up until last Thursday (May 4th), Lucasfilm spokespeople insisted was NEVER going to happen.

Hmm...it makes one now question the credibility of similar proclaimations that have been repeatedly made about the ""Star Wars Holiday Special"".

It's fascinating how a tiny handful of Betamax and VHS recorders back in 1978 apparently managed to capture a television special that has never again been officially screened within the United States.  Are these the most duplicated home video recordings of all time?  Probably.  Considering the technical limitations inherent in a 30 year old home video master, there are hundreds, perhaps thousands of suprisingly good quality versions of this program floating around.  An official ""Star Wars Holiday Special"" release, however, would put this entire subindustry out of business.

It's fashionable to bash the the ""SWHS"", although it's not that much worse (and a lot more interesting) than a lot of other prime-time network TV schlock that has passed for high art over the years.  Sometimes not-so-great movies can make wonderful DVD's--a case in point, Image Entertainment's ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" DVD which features an astonishingly outstanding print of the original feature and a fascinating 2-hour documentary about the film and about Ed Wood, the man who directed it.

Will the ""Holiday Special"" ever be officially released on DVD in George Lucas's lifetime?  Well...for whatever reason, he's letting us once again see that sorry-looking blob underneath Luke's landspeeder.  And again, more importantly, Lucas apparently has reconsidered his hardline ""one last time"" stance on the DVD release of the classic original Star Wars trilogy.  Who knows what else he might change his mind about releasing?",1146960000,14,2241,5.405172413793103
1540125,1,B00005JOIP,"I saw this at age nine when it originally aired. I couldn't wait. In fact, I'd say I anticipated it even more than the TV movie ""Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park,"" which came out right around the same time and was equally execrable.

Let's get this straight: this is one of the saddest, most embarrassing things ever committed to videotape. Possibly worse than Shatner singing ""Rocket Man"" at the Sci Fi awards.

But, if you must see it (and you've been warned), you can certainly find it out there if you look hard enough. For a taste, though, visit: [...] You'll get the idea...",1146700800,4,582,4.481132075471698
1540126,1,B00005JOIP,"Other reviewers have done an excellent job giveng the specific chain of events in this misbegotten chapter in the star wars legacy.  I will add my 2 cents.  As a 7 year old child my Twin borther and I waited 3 hours with our Dad to see star wars.  After that we clamored for anything star wars buyinmg every toy yada yada yada.  When the holiday special aired we were allowed to watch it on the black & white in my parents room.  even then I thought it was pretty bad but loved the cartoon sequence with Boba fett (the figure mail away arrived soon there after) my childs mind hoping for a moring cartoon (and not droids 6 years later was not what I wanted).  Over the years my Brother and I talked about it and reminiced about how truly bad it was.  let me say that I should have realized that if a kids mind thought it was bad it must have been awful.  I got a good quality bootleg dvd recently and sat through this drek for the second time in 28 years It was even worse than I remembered.  The Boba fett cartoon is still worth watching the rest not really but for that 1 glimmer of quality it should be released on DVD.  Lucas says it will never see an official release and until today when they announced the origianl unaltered triligy will make it to DVD I beleived him but now anything is possible

7941060,5,B00005JOIP,"Right off the bat, I want to say this is NOT cannon Star Wars, and was made at a time when George Lucas wasn't exactly sure which direcion he was going to take the next movie. He knew he had a hit on his hands, and doing a tv movie mixing footage from the movie along with new footage seemed like a good idea at the time. While it became a hit with the fans, it was a move George Lucas later regretted and tried to have it erased from our memories.

But some fan out there had already hit the ""record"" button on their VCR, and the rest is history. The special just won't die, and frankly...why should it? Besides the full Star Wars cast, it also has Art Carney in one of his final roles, and a few other stars from that era.

Sorry George Lucas, this program is still out there, and there are a ton of fans out there who are going to ne adding this camp classic to their collection...including yours truly.",1513555200,,906,4.112994350282486

It was a time when families watched TV together and shows like M*A*S*H and Three's Company were considered provocative. The ""Adults"" of the time were not at all interested in Star Wars. This horrible special was an attempt to bring something into the living room that the whole family could watch but aimed at the children. Although not completely true to the Star Wars feel, it was an attempt to instill family values into a very new idea that had just began to become accepted. The quality of this special denotes just how mind blowing the original movie was to those of us who lived in these times. I was only 8 yrs old when this aired and it was tailor made for me and my friends at the time and a great diversion from the regularly scheduled programs such as Rhoda, M*A*S*H, Three's Company, Barney Miller, Bob Newhart.

7941064,2,B00005JOIP,"Anyone who says that ""The Phantom Menace"" is the worst thing in the Star Wars cannon, has never seen this steaming pile of dog feces.

The words needed to describe the absurdity of this film have proven elusive for many reviewers.  In many ways, actions speak louder than words.  What am I referring to?  The fact that this made for TV Movie has never been released in the United States on VHS or DVD.  On top of that, it's never been rerun on TV.

Think about that for a moment.  Even complete train wrecks of movies make it to video.  This did not.

Why is this movie so bad?  I'm not going to write a thirty page overview (this gives you enough fodder for that).  I'm only going to mention a few things.

- There is a ten minute section of Wookie talk.  It has no subtitles.  I am not kidding or over stating this.  Ten minutes of confusing nonsense.  TEN MINUTES!!!

- Carrie Fisher, who appears to have just smoked a LARGE quantity of an illicit substance, sings a bizarre song for us, that is loosely tied into the Star Wars theme music.

- There is a disturbing scene where Chewie's elderly father is basically molested.

- A storm trooper dies.  No big deal right?  He doesn't get shot, beat up, or die in battle.  He trips over a log and falls to his death.

Those are just a sampling of the misery included in this movie.  That might lead you to ask why I gave it two stars instead of one.  To be honest, this movie is so horrifically bad, it's funny.  This is one of the funniest things you will ever see.  After watching this movie you will wonder how this was ever made and quickly realize that you just saw something special.  Only the drug fueled late 70's could have produced such a thing.  We will never see anything like this again.

My recommendation to you, is to watch this after a few (or more) adult beverages.  You will laugh so hard your stomach will hurt.",1450396800,2,1881,4.288571428571428
