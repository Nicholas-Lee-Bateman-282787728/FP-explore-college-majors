8570310,3,B00BL9RLEM,"OK pair of B quality thrillers from the 60's.

Anatomy of a Psycho is about a teenager in a lot of emotional pain because his beloved brother has just been executed by the state for a murder.  The guy did kill, but the teener will not accept that reality.  He starts on a campaign to avenge himself on those he holds responsible for the loss of his brother.  With his gang he beats up the prosecutor's son and frames for murder the son of the man who witnessed his brother's crime.  Adding fuel to his hate and pain is the fact that his sister is the girlfriend of his second target.  You feel for the guy, especially when locals look down on him, but you can't agree with his campaign of revenge.
The Lonely Sex is a stinker about a creepy loner who kidnaps a young woman and holds her captive.  Meanwhile a peeping tom is making his rounds around town.  More freaks than normal people in this movie.  The film ends abruptly without credits which means it has been badly edited or they got hold of an inferior master.  Other than that the picture quality of both films is the best I've ever seen.  Recommended for fans of this genre.",1433894400,,1134,4.327014218009479

8570313,4,B00BL9RLEM,"Vinegar Syndrome has done a great service to drive-in cinema fans by rescuing two rock-bottom exploitation ""classics,"" Anatomy of a Psycho and The Lonely Sex, from Public Domain DVD hell with the release of this set, newly remastered in 2K from 35mm elements. The former movie is a campy early entry in the ""psycho killer"" genre, coattailing not only on Hitchcock's Psycho, but Anatomy of a Murder as well, while the latter is actually a serious, heartfelt, if flawed, exploration of the pain and isolation of the sexual misfit, years before such a subject could be explored openly in mainstream movies, with enough ""smut"" elements to get it played on the raincoat circuit. Unfortunately, while the transfer of Lonely Sex is a huge improvement on the Sinister Cinema edition I already owned, it's disappointing to find that it's missing a few minutes of footage.

As I watched my copy of the VS release yesterday, it seemed that Lonely Sex ended rather abruptly, and was missing the end credits I remembered from previous viewings. So I dug out my Sinister Cinema disc and, sure enough, after the point where the VS transfer ends, there is a short scene of Mr. Wyler peeping at the strip club again (the VS DVD has just music and a black screen here) and a final Citizen Kane-like ""reveal"" at the psycho's shack of the flower lying on the floor, followed by the final credit roll. This amounts to about 1:58 of material. I also noticed a very brief scene of a bartender reading newspaper headlines about the sex slaying moved to a different position near the beginning of the film, but it doesn't make a difference.

It's really too bad, because otherwise the transfer blows away the SC disc; it's not immaculate, but still a huge upgrade. Which means it probably blows away the Alpha edition as well since many of their DVDs are sourced from old Sinister videotapes. I was pleased to finally have ""definitive"" editions of Anatomy of a Psycho and Lonely Sex, until I found that LS is still not quite all there. Bummer.

Fortunately, Anatomy of a Psycho looks so great that it makes the purchase of this set worthy all by itself. It completely destroys my Sinister copy, which was itself better than the PD DVD version (probably Madacy's) I had before that. There are a few very brief, isolated instances of print damage, and some minor speckling and reel-change blemishes, but otherwise the transfer looks terrific--crisp and detailed, with deep blacks, rich grayscale, and excellent brightness/contrast. This obsoletes every crummy PD edition out there, hands down, and Anatomy of a Psycho will probably never look better unless VS puts out a Blu-ray someday, or somebody unearths original elements.

Sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings; this would have been a five-star release for me, even with no extras, were it not for the problem with Lonely Sex. But I'm going to have to hang on to my Sinister DVD-R of Lonely Sex indefinitely now, instead of upgrading and being done with it.",1367366400,17,2986,4.803501945525292
8570314,5,B00BL9RLEM,"I have probably seen more exploitation films than most as my collection nears nears 8000 films in that genre alone.  Many of these films are quite honestly meh.  But the collector in me tarries on in hopes that once in awhile one rises to the top of the dung heap.  What does a film produced in 1959 really have to offer that will impress completists like me?  When in the following decades we are treated to films such as The Sinful Dwarf or They Call Her One Eye how can a black and white film in the genre really be memorable and more importantly a repeat view?

The acting by the three principle characters are believable, compelling with a subject matter that is timeless in todays world we live in.  The first character we are introduced to is a letchorous ""uncle"" who eyes the daughter of one of his associates.  You can almost see the bovine persperation on this sickos upper lip with each uncomfortable scene where her peeps or pops in on the girl be it in the bath or bedroom.  He is quite believable and each scene is pretty uncomfortable or hilarious depending on your sensibility.  I will not spoil anything, but the film is played out like so many other peeping tom like films we seen many times before, then it takes an unexpected turn in the third act that has you rooting for the slob.  It is this character arc as well as the tone of the subject matter that makes this one bubble to the top of the dung heap.",1365897600,3,1426,4.347169811320755
8570315,4,B00BL9RLEM,"Anatomy of a Psycho

Hot on the heels of the release of Elia Kazan's ""On the Waterfront"", Fred F. Sears made ""Rumble on the Docks"", which was basically a cheap juvenile re-imagining of the more famous film. This of course was only part of a larger, endearing exploitation pattern, because knocking off familiar properties surely is a whole lot easier than coming up with an entire original idea yourself. Judging by the title itself,  ""Anatomy of a Psycho"" does this one better and piggybacks on not one, but two famous movies: `Otto Preminger's ""Anatomy of a Murder"" and Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"". So we get a court sequence and some vague sense of the inadequacies of the judicial system as in Preminger, at the same time as the movie delves into the troubled mind of an adolescent. Nobody would expect a movie as good as its two most famous predecessors, but there's really a lot to enjoy here. The beautiful Darrell Howe makes for a truly fascinating psycho, even if he is obviously acting in the angst-ridden James Dean mode and it's a shame this seems to have been his only claim to fame. Juvenile picture mainstay Michael Grange puts in an appearance too and everything is directed with more than some sensitivity by Boris Petroff. I've never seen one of those public domain releases that have been floating around, but they probably don't even come close to this new Vinegar Syndrome release, which simply looks incredible. Of course there's some damage here and there, but surprisingly little of it actually, because most of it looks almost brand new. The beautiful contrast gives the movie a whole lot more class than you'd normally expect from a movie like this. Cheaply shot as it may have been, it still had all the advantages of the Hollywood Studio System behind it and this really shows on this DVD release.

The Lonely Sex

While ""Anatomy of a Psycho"" is far from a waste of  time, what makes this new drive-in double feature from Vinegar Syndrome truly worth watching is the second half of its double bill, the wonderful ""The Lonely Sex"". The theme of lonely people trying to connect with other people has inspired so much of our greatest artists and artworks, from Paul Fejos' ""Lonesome"" to John Cassavetes' ""Minnie and Moskovitz"" and from Antonioni to Wong Kar-Wai. One of the reasons for this is obviously because it's a theme very close to the heart and one that almost always seems to ring true emotionally - no matter how poorly executed, these films always are at the very least easy to identify with. On the most low-budget end of the spectrum comes ""The Lonely Sex"", which is one of those movies that seems to give the dictum `less is more' its true meaning. Beautifully shot in an impressionistic style with a minimum of dialogue, this obviously is much closer in spirit to an avant-garde short than a pure sexploitation (although these ARE naked tits in the beginning of the movie!), which probably makes it somewhat unsuitable for some people, but makes it all the more interesting for the more adventurous viewer. It's a film loaded with moments that are at once poetical and recognizable, both haunting and sad. Especially the subplot with Mister Wyler (who, had the film been made 20 years later would've been played by Paul Bartel) has some true melodramatic zest in it and makes you realize his situation is really not that different from that of the criminal protagonist. We all have to stay sane inside insanity, as `The Rocky Horror Picture Show' would have it. The image doesn't look nearly as good as `Anatomy of a Psycho', but it's certainly more than adequate. Just keep your expectations in check and let yourself be hypnotized by the beauty of the film itself.",1365292800,3,3706,4.766355140186916
