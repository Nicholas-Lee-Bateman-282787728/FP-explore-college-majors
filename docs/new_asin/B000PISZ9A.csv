Decent film, worth a watch imo.

XTRO most horror fans are familiar so i won't go into detail about it.

XTRO2 was okay, people are in a laboratory complex or something if I remember correctly and theres a monster thing that pops out of a pregnant lady and goes hiding in vents.

Im definately glad i bought this new for 8 dollars.  now its worth 100",1375920000,,588,4.518867924528302
8191822,2,B000PISZ9A,"I got this guy cheap like cheaper than buying xtro or xtro/xtro 2 on dvd by themselves so i figured what the hell free skeeter.  i had read that both those releases featured some good extra features on the first film which is ultimately the film you are buying this set for.

i was flabergasted however to find no extras on the xtro/xtro 2 disc.  it makes little sense to me though why they would change the disc after already releaseing the double feature with extras.  maybe they are hidden on there somewhere.

anyways xtro was fun the other 2 weren't so great i would suggest buying the xtro/xtro 2 release so you get some extras.  those extra features are probably more entertaining than skeeter and won't waste as much of your time.",1293494400,7,738,4.511278195488722
