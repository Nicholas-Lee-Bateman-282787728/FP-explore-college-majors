5445257,5,B00AKCUL3Y,The Golfer's Toolbox was everything it was advertized to be. As you get up in age stretching is very important to not pulling those somethings we didn't know we even had when we were younger. The alignment rods and setup for putting practice stored within the body of the tool make it handy and one less item you have to remember where you put them. I would recommend the Golfer's Toolbox to anyone  that wants to work on their game.,1370044800,,433,4.4125
5445258,5,B00AKCUL3Y,"Great multi-tool for practice.  This tool is everything it was advertised to be and more.  I especially liked the distance markings on the main alignment rod case. They really helped me with my speed estimation on our very fast greens.  (11, stimp).  This is expensive as alignment rods go, but the results are well worth the price.  Highly recommend!",1367539200,4,351,4.88135593220339

8553005,4,B00AKCUL3Y,Very handy practice aid and the exercise and swing tips on the video are worthwhile.  Not sure you could not accomplish the same thing with just a couple of alignment rods.,1413244800,,172,4.548387096774194

8553013,5,B00AKCUL3Y,"I'm a golf training gadget ""junkie"" and this tool is all-inclusive, well designed, convenient, and works as advertised.

I just wish they'd have developed it a few years ago--I'd have saved a lot of money.  I will now have a bunch of training aids that'll be going into mothballs be as this device renders them obsolete.",1373414400,,320,4.696428571428571
