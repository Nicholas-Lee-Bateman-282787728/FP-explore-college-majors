8570006,3,B00BKSL16I,"The DVD really helps you understand Excel in an easy and quick way. It divides aspects of Excel in different videos thus not making each video really complicated. However, the title of the DVD is extremely misleading. You will not be mastering Excel. I think these videos are AN EXCELLENT source of assistant to people that have never used excel or have not used it often. It will take you from beginner to intermediate. But it will not make you an advance user. It only have on video of PivotTables or the other Advance Business Models. I don't regret getting the DVD. I think I will certainly rewatch it in the future. But I definitely another source to learn advance excel.",1405209600,,676,4.595041322314049
