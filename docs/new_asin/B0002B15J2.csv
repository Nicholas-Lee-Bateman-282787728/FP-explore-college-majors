A bit shorter than the previous DVD sets(as thier were less episodes in the last 4th quazi 5th season(s)..  But I got to see two episodes that I did not know were even made(thought I had seen them all).. so Hazza!
Not as much Bender man on the comentaries for this season, but it is made up for by other people(including Al Gore's daughter) Lots of niffty extra features...
Worth every penny for diehard fans.. but for those who are not so hard core, they may wish to wait untill this drops in price a bit( I only paid 24.99 US to order from Europe, but it was region 2 so you have to have a region free DVD player)",1086825600,5,705,4.138686131386861
2074719,5,B0002B15J2,"TV networks have a history of messing with good shows and Futurama is no exception. When it first premiered it was slotted at foxes only good timeslot, after the Simpsons. It premiered to some of the higest ratings in Fox history. The rating dropped the next week but were still good. Fox, wanting to place other shows after the Simpsons to give it a boost, moved the show to the middle of the week. There, no one knew it was on and no one could find it (much like family guy). It struggled there for a while and was eventually moved back to sunday but at a much worse slot. It was placed a 7:00 which had two major problems
a) the show was a little too risque for 7:00 which lead to many arguments with the network (and the delay of the second X-mas episode)
b) It was cancelled week after week after week by football. Sometimes it wasn't even cancelled for football but for the aftergame commentaries. King of the Hill usually got shown, but Futurama was rarely seen.
Midway into the fourth season (right after they had one an emmy for ""Roswell that ends well"" actually) fox pulled the plug. They had never liked the series (too far out and weird) and the rating just weren't high enough. So the plug was pulled. Too add insult to injury, alot of the last episodes were delayed into the summer instead of being shown during the regular season. It wasn't even replaced. Two King of the Hills woudl be show rather than Futurama. The season faded out in the summer where few were aware that new episodes were premiering. It went on to get good ratings in reruns on CN, though those rating were still less then what it got on a average night on fox.
This is a Great Season. It's the first that had a few week episodes but overall it was still fantastic. It ranges from Political (A Taste of Freedom) to sad (Jurassic Bark), to just plain funny (The Fansworht Parabox). This also contians the best tribute to Star Trek that could possibly be made (where no fan has gone before) and one of the best last episodes in the history of TV (The Devil's Hands are idle Playthings). This is truley a wonderful show and to not own all the season would be a crime. Hopefully it will experience a revival like Family Guy did (New episodes and a movie on the way! Wahoo!)

2074720,5,B0002B15J2,"I cannot believe Fox cancelled this show while they promote pure garbage like ""The Swan"" and those shows with the Hilton sisters.  Futurama is better than the Simpsons.
While I must admit that some of the plots are aimed more at nerdy Sci-Fi nuts than at regular folk (whoever they are), most are not.  They're simply aimed at people with a true sense of humor.  It has the cleverness that made the Simpsons great, but more of it, and less of the dullness that makes King of the Hill drab.
Instead of canelling it they should've hired more writers and brought it's plots into a realm that more people could relate to.  It was just about regular everyday life in a funny world 1000 years in the future!  Who can't relate to that :)",1086220800,7,730,4.417910447761194

2074734,5,B0002B15J2,"Futurama is easily one of my desert island shows. If you're reading this, it might be one of yours, too!

NOTE to Futurama fans/potential buyers: Yes, this is the complete [original] 4th Season (4 discs). If you're confused by the ""Volume 1-7"" series (which, fyi, are 2-disc sets of half-seasons; and, if you're looking for Seasons 5-7, here is what you'll need to know:

SEASON 5 = is officially the collection of 4 Futurama ""Movies"" ('Big Score', 'Beast', 'Bender's Game', 'Green Yonder')
SEASON 6 = Volume 5 (First 1/2 of the Season; 2 disc set) AND Volume 6 (Second 1/2 of the Season 2 disc set)
SEASON 7 = Volume 7 (First 1/2 of the Season; 2 disc set) AND Volume 8 (Second 1/2 of the Season 2 disc set)

Unfortunately, I can't personally speak to how the Volumes 1-4 correspond to the actual Seasons 1-4, but I did note one reviewer on the Volume 1 Futurama did indicate that Volumes 1-4 are, in fact, Seasons 1-4. So, it would seem, after Season 5, the DVD manufacturer decided to mess with people and maximize their profit by dividing the subsequent seasons (*groan).",1489622400,7,1075,4.588541666666667

2074781,3,B0002B15J2,"Volume 4 of Futurama is the last one that's not a complete ripoff.  Seasons 5, which is contained entirely in the four discs in this collection, is the last one where the animated show was consistently funny.  From this point on, the series tries too hard to win awards, which isn't funny at all; it's just annoying when the show is MEANT to be funny.  Plus volumes 5 and 6 are both only half of a season each for the same price as this one.

Now why did the quality of the packaging slip so much?  Other shows have maintained a consistent level of quality throughout the duration of the DVD sets released, whereas this one is literally a cardboard envelope.  That packaging does not do well at all when it comes to shipping, evidenced by the fact that when I received my copy of this volume, I jury-rigged the box it SHOULD HAVE come in and made my own much more durable custom box alongside four slim empty DVD cases.

After this volume, if you got the set in intact packaging (which I did not), I suggest you just watch the episodes online and buy them individually if you like them.  Futurama Volume 4 (Season 5) is the last good volume there is.",1375747200,,1150,4.341121495327103

However, the paper box thing it comes in is not very good at all. Think of it this way: it's like the inside of a TV show box set without the box.

Wikipedia says this episode has several references of which I never heard.  To me, this was inspired by ""Gulliver's Travels.""  Remember that Gulliver was a giant among the Lilliputians and a bug compared to that larger group.  In this episode, Bender was a god to a civilization in outer space, then he met a god.  I liked how this episode lets you walk in the shows of a prince and a pauper.

The god Bender meets has a soothing voice and is surrounded by multicolored, differently shining stars.  If you like the five-note sound made by the aliens in ""Close Encounters,"" then you'll be pleased by the sounds and colors of this god.  The god says, ""When he helps, you don't even know it.""

Almost all the episodes stand the test of repeat viewing.  Fun, fun sci-fi humor.
A couple caveats - although I believe this is the best of the four volumes, unfortunately it is difficult for a newcomer to jump right into this one- this is a show that is more entertaining when one understands the background of the first seasons, plus by this point there is a steady stream of running jokes from previous episodes (what unfortunately kills a lot of television, in the end).  Secondly, though this show in the beginning tried to appeal to a wide audience, with the Groening label and primetime Fox slot (I watched the first episode on the air, like a lot of people), eventually it settled down to a niche market, those with at least a passing interest in twentieth century science fiction.  (a pinnacle of this is the Star Trek episode on this volume).  The commentaries, by the way, are highly entertaining, and add to the value of the DVD.",1208822400,,1162,4.648780487804878

2074836,5,B0002B15J2,"The 4th and last (so far) production season for Futurama is the best and worst.  This season also solidifies the range of great writing that the show has displayed in earlier seasons (like Season 3's ""Roswell That Ends Well""). Episodes like ""Jurassic Bark"" detail subplots regarding Fry's previous life with touching detail.  ""The Why of Fry"" also furthers the story of Fry's uniqueness and his importance to the future.  ""The Sting"" shows Leela how much she really cares for Fry.  ""Where No Fan Has Gone Before"" is an awesome blend of the world of Futurama and Star Trek.

As mentioned before this season also contained some of the most unpleasant episodes (though in my personal opinion, any Futurama episode is much better than the other ""adult"" cartoons in existence).  Notable worsts are ""A Taste of Freedom"" - even though Zoidberg is one of my favorite characters, many of the episodes Zoidberg stars in turn out less funny because he is less whimsical and more ill-tempered.  ""Bend Her"", ""Obsoletely Fabulous"", ""Three Hundred Big Boys"" also feel much like filler with very little plot and character development.

Unfortunately Fox cancelled Futurama and the last episode of the season, ""The Devil's Hands are Idle Playthings"", brings Futurama to a close that feels more like a cliffhanger than a satisfactory ending.  The superb quality of this ""circuitous"" episode shows how much potential still remains in the show.  There are numerous plot threads remaining that almost demand to be tied.

This season is a must-have for any fan of the show.  The rollercoaster ride through the season isn't entirely pleasant, but only because certain episodes are high caliber and it makes the lapses in writing more noticeable.

The episode deals with Fry finding fossilized remains of his puppy, Seymour. He and Seymour buddied around for three years and become Fry's best friend (Even learning how to bark-sing Fry's favorite song, 'Walking on Sunshine'.)

In the future Fry finds the remains of his once best friend and struggles with the moral implications of reviving Seymour in clone form (with all memories intact.) Upon finding out Seymour died when he was 15 and not 3 when Fry had left, Fry decides not to revive him, stating that Seymour must have lived a full life after Fry left and perhaps even forgot all about him.

At the end of the cartoon, we learn the truth; that Seymour had waited those 12 remaining years outside the pizza house for Fry to return. The last scene shows the 15 year old dog lay down and close his eyes.

It's an amazing episode that I honestly cannot see a second time. I own this 4th season boxed set and set that DVD aside :)",1177632000,7,1167,4.4392523364485985
2074839,5,B0002B15J2,"The fourth, and last, season of Simpsons creator Matt Groening's Futurama is a bittersweet end to a frequently hilarious animated series.  In these episodes, Leela discovers her parents, Fry finds the fossilized remains of his old pet dog, Kif gets pregnant, Bender gets a sex change (yes, you read that right), and Fry attempts to outwit the Robo Devil in the final episode.  Unlike the previous seasons, there aren't as many laugh out loud moments in this collection, but it has it's share of surprisingly poignant moments that set it apart from other prime time animated comedies.  One great episode included here though is ""Where No Fan Has Gone Before"", which features the voice talents of William Shatner and the rest of the original Star Trek cast.  This episode is reason enough to pick this season set up alone, especially if you are a Star Trek fan.  Like the previous seasons, the fourth season of Futurama featured many sci-fi parodies and in-jokes, which easily flew over many viewer's heads, but when they hit the mark, the show is at it's best.  Though Fox finally pulled the plug on Futurama, as well as Seth MacFarlane's Family Guy, both shows were reborn on Cartoon Network's late night Adult Swim lineup.  Staggering DVD sales and Adult Swim ratings spelled a comeback for Family Guy, and it appears the same thing is happening to Futurama as a DVD movie is on the way, and the show itself may return from the dead as well.

Futurama had potential but was given a terrible time slot, Sundays right after football. Word is Futurama might go the Family Guy route and make a direct to DVD movie. Then maybe get back on air.

Side note: Bender is arguably the funiest animated character ever. C'mon, a drunken-cigar-smoking robot, I love it.",1141516800,5,516,4.863636363636363
2074849,5,B0002B15J2,"Who could forget the sci-fi antics of Matt Groening's Futurama? It's funny to see (at its time) the guy work so hard on both shows-this and the Simpsons-and still make such a great acheivement, compared to Seth Macfarlane's handling with Family Guy and >>shudder<< American Dad.

So what about its final 18 episodes? In my opinion this is actually the best season of the show overall; The first season only had a hand-full of good episodes, but feels like it's trying so hard to get off the ground. Seasons Two and Three aren't without its charm, either.

Season Four really nails it though; the bulk of the set contains almost all of my all-time favorites, including THE FARNSWORTH PARABOX, where Professor Farnsworth invents a box/entry to a parallel universe; WHERE NO FAN HAS GONE BEFORE, where Trekkie Fry tries to brink back to Earth all 79 episodes of the original Star Trek series from the forbidden dimension, Omega 3; and LOVE AND ROCKET, where Bender becomes infatuated with the new AI of the Planet Express ship. But there are plenty more episodes to check out.

Now, Futurama's humor wasn't the only thing that made the show work, compared to Family Guy; Half the time it is its plotlines that count; Somehow, Groening and his crew was able to pull it off with a few really emotional episodes such as JURASSIC BARK, where we see what happened to Fry's pet dog, Seymour; In LEELA'S HOMEWORLD, we see Leela's past, what kind of ""alien"" she is, and what happened to her family. In THE WHY OF FRY, another one of my favorites, we learn how Fry was able to fall into the cryogenic freezer and come to the future with the assistance of an undercover Nibblonian.

Its character development/emotion is another piece of atmosphere to this show. Its biggest example would probably be the relationship between Fry and Leela, as it is showcased in episodes such as THE STING, where Fry gives his life for Leela in a sting of huge baby queen bee, and the series-finale itself, THE DEVIL'S HANDS ARE IDLE PLAYTHINGS, where Fry trades hands with the Robot Devil to improve on his Holophoner-playing skills and win Leela's heart.

However, this set isn't without its duds. Episodes like LESS THAN HERO and SPANISH FRY have good concepts that are ruined by terrible scriptwriting and weak endings. I couldn't understand what message A TASTE OF FREEDOM is trying to deliver, either. Luckily, those happen to be the only duds in this set.

Futurama's TV show may have ended on a high note, but it isn't the end of its phenomenon; As we speak, the show is becoming almost as popular as Family Guy as its DVD sets are having great sales and the show is getting huge ratings on Adult Swim and TBS. And already, Matt Groening has signed a deal to start sometime this summer on 4 Direct-to-DVD movies! That's more than what I expected from a show being pushed around by TV executives.

(Speaking of the movies, the series-finale DEVIL'S HANDS grows on me for one thing: In the end of the episode, you never really know if Leela and Fry have gotten together yet, since they left that open. I hope they won't become married in the first of the four movies; I'm hoping for a great love story between the ""seperate"" two in the first movie...)",1141430400,3,3227,4.650877192982456
2074850,3,B0002B15J2,"There are definitely some superb episodes on the season 4 DVDs especially where we get to see Fry and Bender and everyone as kids and we learn the truth of what happened on December 31 1999.  It's not the episodes that I give a low rating to but the features, or more to the point lack of them.

Also at the end of each episode we are forced to sit through copyright warnings in Danish, Swedish, Norwegian and Finnish.  You can press the skip button and skip to the next language but have to watch the last one for about fifteen seconds as it won't let you skip out of it.  This is ridiculous especially when you only speak English.  Makes you want to go out and copy the DVD just to spite them for wasting your time!

Not much in extras in this collection.  Just a few deleted scenes and audio commentary.  No wonder these DVDs are now so cheap in stores, they are not the value for money at full price that other comedies are.  If you want TV show season collections that show what extras and features should be all about check out the DVD of Season 1 or 2 for the TV show Scrubs.  They don't even make Futurama anymore so you'd think the cartoonists and writers could come up with some bonus stuff.  Draw the 'actors' in other parts before they got on Futurama or a where are they now section or something.  It isn't that hard to come up with something creative, just means putting in a bit of effort and caring about your fans and customers.

In summary, great episodes but that's all you are really getting for your money.  Might as well just tape them off the TV rather than fork over hard earned cash for a DVD with hardly any extras that forces you to sit through warnings.

Futurama was a show that did have a fanbase but thanks to Fox, it as well as many other shows got cancelled. This is the last season set to be released and it supplys the humor just as comfortably as any other season.

Season opener(it's the set opener actually, many episodes were aired out of order or pre-empted by football or something else) Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch finds Kif getting pregnant although the parent is not sweetheart Amy.  Similar to the 7 leaf clover episode, it's an emotional one as Leela discovers the truth about her real parents in Leela's Homeworld. Sigourney Weaver guest stars in Love and Rocket as a ship's personality who gets a bit too obsessive about Bender. Very good performance.

In probably one of my favorites, Jurassic Bark centers around Fry finding his dog who's been petrified and decides to clone him only it doesn't work out. Very sad ending. Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles centers around the gang getting younger and younger by the minute. And in the Why of Fry, the reason why Nibbler's shadow was shown when Fry fell in the freezer is explained.

Where No Fan Has Gone Before is a Trekkie's dream as the gang is on trial for going to a planet which has all the merchandise and old episodes from Star Trek. In a surreal but effective episode, Leela inadvertedly causes Fry's death only she keeps dreaming he's alive. Is he or not?  In the series finale(complete with self-knowing disclaimer gag) The Devil's Hands are Idle Playthings, Fry's want to finally win Leela's heart makes him strike a deal with the Robot Devil. Nice finale even if it is slightly ambigious. Dan Castellaneta(Homer, Krusty and others from Simpsons) guest-stars as the Robot Devil.

The episodes like the Simpsons have a small awesome-to-poor ratio. For every 2 good episodes in a row there's a crappy one. Namely the Bender ones. Quite frankly, I rarely laugh at a Bender episode. But the rest are great including some Futurama classics.",1133395200,4,2129,4.725067385444744
2074854,5,B0002B15J2,"Futurama is one of the best shows ever, and one of the funniest and all-around greatest I've ever seen, it has more heart and is less obnoxiously self-aware than Family Guy.

Unfortunately, this is the last Futurama volume, which is quite sad. It was cancelled before its time and that still rankles.

So, I bid a fond farewell to this intelligent and hilarious show, perhaps too good before its time for some, but this last volume is full of reasons how and why it was such a wonderful show.

Kif Gets Knocked Up A Notch - 8/10. I like this episode more than a lot of people, it's very funny (Evil Lincoln is a good subject on the commentary), the baby shower, the Dr. Bones character, and of course Kif and Zapp. All great stuff.

Leela's Homeworld - 8/10. A touching episode where Leela finally learns her origins. Nice montage at the end, too.

Love And Rocket - 8/10. One of the better Bender episodes, this episode is very well done, with some good parodies, especially 2001. The whole trip to the Romanticorp Headquarters is bizarre and hilarious (""My two favorite things are commitment and changing myself""). It stays good and funny with the delivery of chalky candy hearts to Omicron Perseii 8 and the ship's computer (voiced excellently by Sigourney Weaver) going crazy.

Less Than Hero - 10/10. Damn, I love this episode. The part in the credits where Bender opens and closes his door to show off his ""super powers"" always cracks me up, and the Justice Team theme is AWESOME.

A Taste Of Freedom - 6/10. This episode is okay, it carries a pretty heavy-handed message (an important one, but still heavy-handed), but the jokes are still pretty good.

Bender Should Not Be Allowed On TV - 6/10. Somewhat weak. It has a lot of Calculon, and Calculon is hilarious, Maurice LaMarche is amazing. I like the scene with Calculon and the grilling pirate captain. This episode still falls a little flat, but the rendition of Black Flag's ""TV Party"" is pretty good.

Jurassic Bark - 10/10. So sad! What an emotionally wrenching episode. That ending is just too much.

Crimes Of The Hot - 5/10. Not one of my favorites. Best line: ""Let the games begin!""

Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles - 10/10. Excellent, one of my top 5 favorite episodes. The ending is a gorgeous scene.

Why Of Fry - 8/10. Not so big on this one, as others. Good but not spectacular.

Where No Fan Has Gone Before - 10/10. Hilarious, the best Star Trek parody ever.

The Sting - 10/10. Maybe my favorite Futurama episode of all time, chock full of classic scenes. It's got great action with the space bees adventure, really good effects, and some great emotion. The Professor in particular has some great lines.

Bend Her - 6/10. It's got Calculon and a good wedding scene at the end. That counts for something.

Obsoletely Fabulous - 4/10. Not very good at all.

Farnsworth Paradox - 9/10. A fan favorite, but I wouldn't call it a Top 10 episode.

Spanish Fry - 5/10. Kind of lame.

The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings - 10/10. A sweet ending to the show. Oh yeah, it's funny too and features the return of the Robot Devil.

All in all, this is a great volume of Futurama. Better than the first one, nearly as good as third, but heck, all of Futurama is brilliant. I'll really miss this show, it had some of the finest moments I've ever seen on TV.",1128124800,8,3319,4.546218487394958

In other words, great characters with equally funny storylines.  The writing is absolutely brilliant and never underestimates the audience's intelligence.

Well! I was astonished at how well everything went together! Matt Groening has certainly out-done himself this time! I couldn't believe how much imagination and wit was put into this show.

Then the stupid number of reality shows began to emerge and FOX's so-called ""reason"" for cancelling this show and ""Family Guy"" began to surface. The reason for cancelling the shows in favor for reality shows (American Idol and all that other crap) was that FOX felt behind the times and decided to go with the ""reality"" trend. BAD MOVE!!! Now that the show ""Family Guy"" has had such a cult following in DVD sales, FOX has ""miraculously"" revived the show. But, chances are ""Futurama"" is not returning to FOX anytime soon, which pisses me off so bad because it was on for such a short while. Anyway here's the story about the show and characters. Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.

The series begins with Philip J. Fry, a New York City slacker who is cryogenically frozen by accident on New Year's Eve, 1999. He is defrosted one thousand years later on December 31, 2999 and finds himself in New New York City. Fry's attempt to escape from his now-mandatory job assignment as a delivery boy ends when he is hired on at Planet Express, a small intergalactic package delivery company run by his distantly descended nephew. The series covers the adventures of Fry and his colleagues as they travel around the universe making deliveries on behalf of Planet Express.

The futuristic time frame allowed the show's writers to be creative with their humour by introducing ideas and events from pulp science fiction of the mid 20th century into the series. As such, the show is as much a testament to the creativity of the writers as it is a story of Fry and his colleagues.

Characters

Philip J. Fry (""Fry"") (Voiced by Billy West) - was ""accidentally"" cryogenically frozen just after New Year, 2000, and thawed out in time to usher in the year 3000. Something of a misfit in the 20th century, he adapted to 31st century life with ease after finding employment outside the field of pizza delivery and taking up residence in Bender's closet at the Robot Arms apartment building. He generally has a lower intelligence than the rest but occasionally has moments of genius. Through a time travel accident, he is his own grandfather.

Turanga Leela (""Leela"") (Katey Sagal) - The ship's captain, and usually the most disciplined member of the Planet Express crew. For most of the series she believed she was an orphaned alien (mainly because she is almost completely human-looking, except for the fact that she only has one eye), and desired to learn of her origins. It was later revealed - in Season 4 - that she is a sewer mutant instead of an alien as previously believed.

Professor Hubert Farnsworth (Billy West) - Fry's great-great-...-great grand-nephew who runs Planet Express. In his 160s, he peers through cokebottle glasses, has bad posture and frequently forgets who or what he was talking about. Farnsworth is a mad scientist whose inventions are of variable usefulness. Has a long-standing rivalry with former student Professor Wernstrom. His catchphrases are ""Good news, everyone!"", and ""Oh, my no.""

Bender Bending Rodriguez (""Bender"") (John DiMaggio) - a foul-mouthed, hard drinking, misanthropic robot (catchphrase: ""Bite my shiny metal ass!"") built in America's heartland - Mexico. He frequently violates the Three Laws of Robotics. The only thing he fears is an industrial-size electric can opener. He also is known to uncontrollably sing folk music when exposed to a magnetic field.

Hermes Conrad (Phil LaMarr) - a Jamaican Bureaucrat with a flair for filing. He is also an Olympic Limbo-er. He manages Planet Express delivery business, and his responsibilities include paying bills, giving out legal waivers, and notifying next of kin. In direct contrast to most stereotypes of Jamaicans, he is an uptight workaholic, a stickler for doing everything according to regulations, and frequently admonishes the staff for not working hard enough. He frequently makes bizarre exclamations, such as ""Sweet manatee of Galilee!"", ""Sweet lion of Zion!"" or ""Sweet gorilla of Manilla!"" The character was originally named ""Dexter"" who did not sport a Jamaican accent; this was changed after the first few episodes were recorded.

Dr. John Zoidberg (Billy West) - a lobster-like alien from planet Decapod 10 who (as a self-proclaimed expert on humans) provides incompetent medical care for the crew. He is strongly disliked by Hermes Conrad and lives below the poverty line. Zoidberg combines features of several sea creatures, scuttling sideways like a crab, producing ink like an octopus or squid, and creating pearls in his digestive tract like oysters. He is often treated as the outcast in the group. Zoidberg is curiously a joke on a few levels. A famous New England sauce is named Lobster Newburg, while Zoidberg himself also exhibits many of the stereotypes of Jewish doctors, including his grammar, his accent, and his sandals.

Amy Wong (Lauren Tom) - an intern at Planet Express (kept around because she shares the professor's blood type) and heir to half of Mars. Her parents, who constantly pester her about the lack of grandchildren, came to own half the planet through a legitimate deal that parodied colonial exploitation of gullible natives. On the show, Amy is known for being somewhat shallow and ditzy, and for her overuse of futuristic 31st century slang. She also tends to dress provocatively, frequently being the person on screen wearing the least clothing. When aggravated, she occasionally starts cursing in Cantonese.

Well, there you have it! Now you know a little about the show, and why I'am angered by FOX.",1127088000,5,6303,4.957386363636363
2074859,5,B0002B15J2,"Some of the best episodes.  Especially the Farnsworth Paradox.  Every season of a show has its clunkers, and this is no exception however, the good far outway the not so good.",1125878400,,175,4.612903225806452
2074860,5,B0002B15J2,"Only four animated TV series deserve consideration for the best such series ever: The Simpsons, South Park, Family Guy, and Futurama.  I dismiss The Simpsons and South Park because even though they're very funny, the characters aren't very likable.  Over time, this makes me lose interest.  Family Guy and Futurama both have very likable characters, even though most of them are complete idiots.  And even though Family Guy is cleverer and more consistently funny than Futurama, Futurama is still my favorite.  The reason is simple: Futurama has more heart.  Every frame of Futurama is a labor of love.  And every so often, an episode will break out of the comedy mold and enter another category altogether.  A perfect example of this is the episode ""Jurassic Bark"" which is included in this compilation.  A friend of mine (who is not a big fan of the show in general) told me that he thought that that episode was the best single TV show he had ever seen.  After watching the episode, I knew what he meant.  Although there are lots of laughs, the main point of the episode is the power of friendship and loyalty, and the ending (which I won't give away) is one of the saddest and most touching things I have ever seen anywhere.  It's certainly one of the high points of the entire series, and it's the kind of thing you have no right to expect from a comedy show.  Another episode that's just as good is ""Leela's Homeworld"" which, in addition to being hilariously funny and clever, has a beautifully touching ending.  Yet another episode like this is ""The Sting"".  It seems that the show's creators were aware that the show was going to be cancelled and wanted to put all the great stuff they would normally have left for a later season into the last few episodes.  Whatever the reason, this is some incredible TV here.  You should buy all of the Futurama box sets as a way of showing support for the show, and hopefully Fox will bring it back (as they did with Family Guy).

To give you some idea of how good this collection is, I went through and considered all 18 episodes.  Of these, I would rate 10 of the 18 as outstanding, two of which (Jurassic Bark and Leela's Homeworld) I consider among the best things I've ever seen on TV.  You can't go wrong with material this good.",1124064000,4,2281,4.544117647058823

I like that Futurama shows more then only humor, there is emotional, fascinating stuff in it.

The only thing i find misplaced in a sci-fi cartoon or movie would be the sometimes medeivil stuff. But only sometimes, for the rest it's alot futuristic. Example Scruffy the janitor pulling on a rope to get the elevator up, this stuff should be replaced by some cool Sci-Fi style elevator.

All in all, these series r so great.

I own all 4 DVD boxes, and saw all episodes allllooooot of times, and still see them now and then.

2074864,4,B0002B15J2,"Futurama is one of the rare shows that started off good, and stayed good all the way through.  This might be due to the fact that it was cancelled before it should have been.  The cancellation may have been a blessing in disguise though, since it didn't allow Futurama to become one of those shows that kept on going past its prime, churning out sloppy episodes long after running out of ideas.

In my view, this isn't the best set of episodes, but it's a good set none-the-less.  In this particular set, my favorite episode has to be Spanish Fry, which includes a sub-plot about a search for Bigfoot.  The Planet Express crew watches a short film that explains how destroying the forests would be detrimental to Bigfoot, if he exists.

Bender Should Not Be Allowed On TV is great too.  Calculon's character is hilarious, doing only one take no matter how bad the scene is ruined by Bender.  Bender's message about turning off the TV and sitting down with your children to hit them really makes this episode a classic.

It's also enjoyable to see Bender living the high life in 300 Big Boys.  He steals a valuable cigar and blows smoke in everybody's face, then delivers his patented evil laugh.  I love that laugh.

Even though I like to make Bender the highlight of everything, this set's real highlight is the wonderful and surprisingly touching last episode of the series.  It's one of the more unusal episodes, since it has a long musical number, but I guess with the presence of the Robot Devil, you have to expect that.  I really think this episode was a great way of saying good-bye.",1120176000,2,1591,4.575971731448763

Bender was fantastic, Fry's loserly shtick was great, and Dr Farnsworth and Leela were funny! WHY WAS IT CANCELLED? Well, consolation can be taken by watching the last 18 episodes on DVD:

2074868,5,B0002B15J2,"A brainchild of Simpsons creator Matt Groening, Futurama launched itself into homes across the galaxy in Spring 1999. Employing the same quick wit and visual humor that has made The Simpsons one of the most successful shows in television history, Futurama (despite its early cancellation in August 2003) maintains its own loyal cult following...

Set one thousand years in the future, Futurama follows the life of a modern day American pizza delivery boy named Fry who finds himself reanimated 1,000 years after being accidentally cryogenically frozen. Brought back to life, Fry hunts down his great, great, great nephew - a tinkering scientist named Professor Farnsworth - and spends his days working for his distant relative's intergalactic delivery service alongside good friends, Leela (a female Cyclops) and Bender (a morally-challenged robot). As the characters (usually Fry and Bender) engage in various schemes throughout the universe, Professor Farnsworth and his crew meet up with a number of interesting characters and civilizations...

The Futurama (Season 4) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the first episode of this Volume 4 DVD ""30% Iron Chef"" in which Bender's dream of becoming a famous chef is dashed when his hero, Elzar, rejects his cooking. Joining a band of vagrant travelers, Bender meets Helmut Spragel - formerly the world's greatest chef. Spragel personally trains Bender and provides him with a secret vile which contains ""the essence of flavor"". Confident in his newfound abilities, Bender challenges Elzar to a one-on-one cook-off on the ""Iron Cook"" TV show... Other notable episodes from Season 4 include ""Where No Fan Has Gone Before"" in which Fry travels to the planet Omega 3 where all things Star Trek (including the show's cast) have been banished by the galaxy, and ""Jurassic Bark"" in which Fry and Professor Farnsworth collaborate to bring Fry's old dog Seymour back to life...

2074869,5,B0002B15J2,"Aw, another great season of Futurama.  The fourth season contains some great episodes, and I feel it's more consistent that season 3.  The first two episodes were pretty mediocre (which was discouraging to me, as I worried what was to come), but they quickly picked up with the third episode (in which Bender falls in love with the Planet Express Ship), and I heartily enjoyed all the rest of the episodes.

 One thing about Futurama is that it has a variety of episodes.  Some are silly and shallow (aka hilarious), such as when Bender gets a wooden body and when aliens intend to harvest Fry's ""lower horn"" for an aphrodisiac. Others have very interesting plots ( such as ""The Why of Fry""-which reveals a secret that Groening had planned from the beginning- and the episode where Fry is killed).  Probably the best meshes of laughter and plot are when everyone ages backwards, or when the characters go to an alternate universe.  The finale is also good, and features the return of Dan Castenella (Homer Simpson) as the robot devil.  I also have to give kudos to Billy West for managing to sing quite well in Zoidberg's quirky voice.

There are a couple minor complaints I have about this season.  The writers are inconsistent with Fry and Leela.  A few episodes have them get together at the end, but then this is quickly forgotten about in the next episode, and the plot of Fry trying to woo Leela will start from scratch again a few episodes later.  Also, seasons 2 and 3 had included the episodes ""Anthology of Interest I & II"" which are homologous to the Simpsons ""Treehouse of Horrors"".  Those episodes were alot of fun, and I don't know why they didn't make a third rendition for season 4.  Finally, I wish they would have only recorded selected commentaries for the DVDs because when there is a commentary track for each episode like there is here, the cast and crew run out of things to say.

Well, its sad to see Futurama go, but at least this show was allowed enough of a run to fill four boxed sets (it did a heck of a lot better than other short-lived Fox greats like Greg the Bunny or Andy Richter controls the universe... stupid network).

Sure, they had guest stars like Sigourney Weaver and most of the cast from the original Star Trek, but the season was too balanced.  Everybody got an episode, even Kif and Zoidberg.  It was interesting to see how easy it was for his people to take over the Earth, but who cares about lobsters?  Bender is the reason Futurama was so special.  He is a ROBOT and that's what the future is all about.  We get to see Bender in love, Bender made out of wood, Bender on TV, Bender as a female, Bender jealous of a dog, Bender as a gold robot and, of course, Bender drinking, smoking and pick-pocketing.

There is nothing like a night of TV watching with my daughter when we are joined by our good friends Fry, Leela, Bender, 'Dr. Z', Amy, the Professor, Kif, Zapp, and the under-rated yet awesome character Morbo.

Volume 4 will not disappoint anyone who is familiar with the show or has DVD sets from other seasons. Possibly the jewel of the set is 'Where no fan has gone before'. Even the most devoit Trekkie will have trouble keeping up with tall the Star Trek references.

Maybe I'm just being biased, (AND I AM!!!), but Futurama was a better show than The Simpsons and King of the Hill. Only Family GUy could match it laugh for laugh.

Here's my brief thoughts of all the episodes on this season:

Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch - Pretty funny, good ending. It could have been better though. 6.5/10

Leela's Homeworld - Good episode and very touching. I kind of wish they had let Leela's past remain a mystery though. I liked that element to her. 7/10

Love and Rocket - Very funny, quality episode. Touching stuff with Fry and Leela and, as usual, Bender shines. 8/10

Less Than Hero - Funny at points but not all that great. 6/10

A Taste of Freedom - Great episode. Good that they finally had another Zoidberg-centered ep. Loved the polygamous lawyer. 8/10

Bender Should Not Be Allowed on TV - Funny, but kind of overly ridiculous. 7/10

Jurassic Bark - Funny and, at the end, very sad. I love the flashback episodes. 9/10

Crimes of the Hot - A little odd, but still pretty funny. 7/10

Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles - Great episode, the Professor was rippingly hilarious in this one. 9/10

The Why of Fry - Another VERY excellent episode. Probably the best of the season. They have made the story of Fry a very complete and interesting one. 10/10

Where No Fan Has Gone Before - I'm not even a fan of Star Trek and I like this. 7/10

The Sting - Creative, well-done episode. Touching and kinda trippy. 9/10

Bend Her - I love Bender episodes and this one was one of the funniest. 8.5/10

Obsoletely Fabulous - Again ... 8.5/10

The Farnsworth Parabox - HILARIOUS EPISODE! I love it! It also had my favorite line of the show ""Your granny can go to hell!"" 9/10

Three Hundred Big Boys - Interesting episode and very funny at points. 7.5/10

Spanish Fry - Very funny sharp episode. 8/10

The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings - Another touching episode and a fitting end to Futurama. It leaves so much up in the air though. 9/10",1099872000,8,2060,4.430851063829787
2074879,5,B0002B15J2,"I own all four Futurama box sets, and I couldn't be happier with them.  This show has become one of my top three favorites of all time, along with The Simpsons and Coupling (a British sitcom).  It's unfortunate, though, that Futurama is a show that FOX set up for failure, what with assigning it an unstable and too-early time slot and failing to promote it adequately after the first couple of episodes aired.  Thank goodness the reruns have found a home on Adult Swim, but it's a shame that new episodes are no longer being produced.

The DVD presentation for this box set is excellent, with high quality episodes, funny and informative commentaries, and awesome special features, which include deleted scenes, artwork, a storyboard, an animatic, and 3D models.  The episodes themselves contain just the right mix of humor, intellect, and emotion, as well as spectacular animation.  Here are comments on my favorites from this season:

-Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch - An amusing role reversal story, with the emergence of Kif's maternal instincts, and Amy having trouble facing unexpected new responsibilies.

-Leela's Homeworld - The truth about Leela's parents is revealed.  The music montage at the end of the episode is very sweet.

-Jurassic Bark - Similar to season 3's ""Luck of the Fryrish"", the story cuts back and forth between the 21st and 31st centuries, showing how Fry's disappearance affected his faithful dog.  Quite moving.

-The Why of Fry - A callback to ""The Day the Earth Stood Stupid"", Fry must face his destiny and decide who to trust: the Big Brains or the Nibblonians.  Fabulous 3D graphics!

-The Sting - A very strange, surreal episode, with a twist ending.  It was nice to see Leela's feelings for Fry finally developing.

-The Farnsworth Parabox - One of the wackiest and most philosophical episodes ever.  The different parallel universes are all hilarious.

-Spanish Fry - A more risque episode, where Lrrr and Ndnd (of Omicron Persei 8) attempt to harvest Fry's ""lower horn"" to use as an aphrodesiac.  Silliness ensues.

-The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings - My all-time favorite Futurama episode.  A bit of a callback to ""Parasites Lost"".  Not only are the Holophone graphics and the singing awesome, but this episode features Hedonism-Bot, one of the funniest guest characters ever!  A very touching, yet upbeat, ending to the series.  Talk about going out on a high note.

Again, it sucks that this was the final season, but nevertheless, it's a gem.  Congrats to Matt Groening, David Cohen, and the rest of the gang for all your hard work.  Fans like me really appreciate it, and if there is a network out there that has the wisdom to order new episodes, I will faithfully watch them.  But if not, then great job with what was created!",1099440000,7,2774,4.857142857142857
2074880,5,B0002B15J2,"Futurama was released is a flood of good will and hope among many as a new Simpsons, particularly because at that time Simposons was losing some of its flair.  Unfortunately, Fox Network frequently shafted the show and...well just about every review points this out so I ain't gonna.

What I do want to point out is that this season in particular is worth buying.  It has some of the most heartwarming and heart wrenching moments in the entire show.  Jurassic Bark, a story about Fry's DOLOMITE encased dog made me cry and laugh at the same time, a extremely painful if fulfilling physical oddity.  Both I and my father were first shocked, then incredulous and then laughing to hard to care, even though we both were totally sickened.  This moment was really indicative of this season, with amazing stories, outrageous laughter and surprisingly emotional content.

A further proof of this and a great example of Futurama's other great qualities is the episode The Devils Hands are Never Idle...possibly one of the funniest ""artsy"" shows I have ever watched.  The laughter is classic but the music, much like the Simpsons, is amazing.  The characters literally break into Opera style byplay and pull it off better than something I would pay for.  And yet again, at the end, there is a surprisingly emotional finale.

All of Futurama is good, no one could argue.  But much like many fans usually skip buying the first several seasons of the Simpsons to start, maybe interested parties should start here, where the Futurama team obviously was in its stride.",1098316800,4,1554,4.866920152091255

In my opinion, this is the second best season of Futurama. If you don't have any of the Futurama box sets, then watch it on Adult Swim (Adult Swim is on Cartoon Network and it is recommended for people 14 and older) at 11:30 pm (thats for all U.S. timezones) on Monday- Thursday and Saturday.",1095897600,3,466,4.306818181818182

I may never understand the reason for it's cancellation.  I can only pray that some other network begs the creators of Futurama to pick up where they left off and continue the series.

Season 4 has a great variety of episodes, the worst of which is still worth seeing at least once.  We get to finally discover where Leela really comes from.  The episode Where No Fan Has Gone Before is a special treat for Star Trek fans.  I found the ending of episode 7, Jurassic Bark, to be the saddest moment in the whole series.

DVD extras include audio remarks from characters during the menu screens, commentary on ALL episodes, deleted scenes and artwork.  All good stuff.

It wasn't for a lack of trying, 'tho...hell, the majority of 'em got pre-empted by the NFL so much in my area, I wasn't even 100% sure if Futurama was on the air anymore!

Ofcourse, you can watch reruns on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, I highly recommend buying this dvd set and the previous 3 volumes for yourself. Upon doing so you will find that not only do you have one of the best animated sit-coms/sci-fi spoofs ever created, but a dvd set with the coolest extras ever installed into the medium. For example, once you watch any episode with the audio commentary ""on"" you will never be satisfied with another non-Futurama dvd commentary again. Matt Groening, along with voice talent from the series, and other co-creators are so funny you will actually use this audio option over-and-over again. And every episode has a commentary not just one or two like some series sets.

Now about the show, it self, what can I tell that you don't already know. It is super! Irreverent and like ""The Simpsons"" it became better with each passing season. Treat yourself, go on you deserve it.",1094428800,2,1054,4.666666666666667

And every year since then, like clock work, I've bought the new one on the release day. This past time, however, was tinged with sadness, as it looks like Futurama has expired like the dinosaurs.

This was one of the funniest seasons (with season two being the only vaugly disappointing season) and the season where the writers really let loose with some off the wall episodes.

One of the hilights of past season boxsets were the audio commentaries. This last season is no different. The commentaries are simultaniously funny, informative, and feel rather like a party sans the balloons.

2074888,5,B0002B15J2,"Does anyone remember ""Soap""? Not only did it rip off ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman"", but it wasn't the least bit funny. Its most irritating trait was trying to inject honest (?) sentiment in the middle of (what was supposed to be) cutting satire. It didn't work; the heavy-handed attempt to manipulate the audience was cheap and obvious.

Sarcasm and sentiment don't mix. So I was surprised by the end of the ""Jurassic Bark"" episode, which >almost< reduced me to tears. (I'm getting a little teary writing this -- and I've never owned a dog!) It is really, really sad, especially coming at the end of an episode in which Bender is at his most repulsively obnoxious. It worked, I think, because the story >built< to this point, rather than simply tossing it in.

Season Four isn't quite up to Season Three (though the Star Trek episode is charmingly nasty), but it's still head-and-shoulders above most TV comedies. It's a shame Fox cancelled it, just when it looked as if Leela was about to start appreciating Fry...",1093996800,,1014,4.755681818181818

2074890,5,B0002B15J2,"Futurama definately will be remembered by those who have been fortunate enough to watch it. Unlike Family Guy, Futurama was not a continuous string of one stupid person doing the same stupid thing over and over in different scenarios in order to make the audience laugh. Mind you, I'm not saying that Family Guy is a horrible show, it just does not have what Futurama has. That's soul. There is some genuine emotions tied to each character you associate with. Fry, the stupid but loveable fool who continuously fails to impress the high strung Leela. However, Anybody who has watched the first three box sets knows this well already.

This particular box set is slightly different from the rest. There are, like the previous bow sets tons of laughs to be had. From the antics of Zoidberg turning into every imaginable sea creature, to Bender getting wasted and becoming a celebrity because of it. However, unlike the other seasons, this one has a lot of sad moments too which Matt Groening has done masterfully. Instead of making the characters always funny, there are those moment when you truly relate to Fry's plight in trying to win the affection of Leela who never gives him a chance. However, in this, you will see the relationship between the two blossom.

Also, there are some impressive guest appearances in this season. From the ever popular original Star Trek crew, to the amazing snag of ex Vice-President Al Gore. Both episodes will make you laugh till your sides hurt. So click buy, pop in the DVD and sit back and enjoy what is unfortunately the very last of the Futurama show. Lets hope us Futurama fans can somehow save the series like Family Guy fans did.

The final episode is definately the highlight of the box, a trying fitting end to what was truly a superb show.",1093737600,6,1786,4.699680511182109
2074891,5,B0002B15J2,"Here we have another stunningly constructed and packaged DVD set for the final season of Futurama, with the remaining 18 brilliant episodes. In this fourth season, the show was still getting better and better, with the writing, animation, and voices still improving and reaching heights of excellence seen nowhere else on television, even on sister show The Simpsons. Yucks again to Fox for condemning one of the most outstanding shows in television history to ratings purgatory, leading to an early death for the show in favor of another round of useless reality shows and inconsequential sports specials. That shows you where the priorities of the TV networks really lie these days.

The regular characters in the series went through very important developments this season, from Amy in ""Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch"" (Kif himself even surpasses his hilarious boss Zapp Brannigan in this episode), to the dramatic revelations of Leela's origins in ""Leela's Homeworld."" Fry's cryogenic journey to the future is revisited with exceptionally intricate storytelling in both ""Jurassic Bark"" and ""The Why of Fry,"" in which our humble dork becomes the most important person in the universe. Outstanding writing skills are also evident in ""Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles"" in which a fountain of youth goes disastrously wrong, and the hysterically preposterous ""The Farnsworth Paradox"" featuring infinite parallel universes.

The brilliance of the basic Futurama episodes carry this DVD set just fine, but one major bonus is deleted scenes from 16 of the 18 episodes, many of which are hilarious. The audio commentary that accompanies every episode, as usual, is mostly for trivia-obsessed fanatics, except for the final episode in which the creators wax philosophical a bit about the show's untimely and misguided cancellation. There is a popular movement afoot to revive Futurama, hopefully bypassing the misguided Fox network. Television, the world, and the future all need more Futurama!

2074892,5,B0002B15J2,"stick it to those fox execs by purchasing the last production season of the best show the network ever aired (and swiftly cancelled)!

no shortage of laughs here, but this season also has a new abundance of emotion and depth, with many episodes ending in heartwarming or even tear-jerking (if you let down your guard enough to cry at an animated sitcom) final scenes. the animation style isn't really any different than the first three seasons, since futurama was already pretty well developed by the time it aired, but this show certainly presents the most stunning visuals and expert colorization of any animated sitcom to date (as far as this guy knows).

by far the greatest thing about this DVD and the entire futurama DVD set in general is the commentary. billy west and john dimaggio are as funny as their fictional counterparts (fry & bender). even the writers, directors and producers (notably david x. cohen) are full of funny and interesting comments.

let's not forget that this DVD set also has the most comical and involved animated menus i've ever seen.

In the four years that it was on, it had no promotion, and was frequently cancelled on it's normal showing and its timeslot was moved.  Yet it still managed to last for four years.  The only reason I think it was taken off the air is because of it's originality.  Fox was afraid that it was going to overtake the simpsons (which is becomming less creative)  If it overtook the simpsons they would have felt it was too different, and would only appeal to certain people.  Then they would have nothing to fall back on.  Another show that was different and creative (family guy) was also cancelled. With it's return, hopefully they will bring back the great creativity and originalisn of futurama. Notice now how good both of them do when they have a consistant timeslot on adult swim, and 2 episodes were nominated for an emmy after the show was cancelled for a year.  This DVD set was the best of the series.  Episodes like Jurassic bark, Leela's homeworld, The Sting, and the series ending The Devil's hands are idle playthings were really outstanding plot based episodes that made the characters seem more in depth than just funny images with catch phrases.

2074896,5,B0002B15J2,"I have completed my Futurama collection as of tuesday, but I can't help but feel a bit sad. After all this show was pure fun and cancelled before its time due to FOX's own incompetence (and they have still not redeemed themselves, both Futurama and Family Guy caused Adult Swims ratings to skyrocket and, while they will bring FG back, they have yet to take back Futurama?!?!). Aside from that, episodes like the ones in season four show why it is a popular show on Cartoon Network (or any network for that matter). Episodes like ""The Sting"", ""Where No Fan Has Gone Before"", ""Jurassic Bark"", and (the final episode) ""The Devils Hands Are Idle Play Things"" make it worth having even if you don't own any of the previous seasons. Not to mention all the easter eggs and special features that the dvds are loaded with. Fans must have it, if for no other reason than the sad fact that there will be no season 5 to look forward to. While I watch the episodes over again and again my fingers will remain crossed. But i suppose a 5th season is to much to hope for...stupid FOX network...just know that season 4 will leave you craving more of Fry and the rest of New New York!",1093564800,3,1167,4.407407407407407
2074897,5,B0002B15J2,"Futurama series 4 was every bit as funny as the first three seasons, which is saying a lot. Why the show was cancelled at the peak of its quality is beyond anyone who watched it; it was both hilarious and thoughtful. The only problem this show ever had was Fox network's poor treatment: constantly preempting it, moving it around or showing it ""in progress"", thus making it difficult for the series to gather a casual following. Only devoted fans who made an effort to keep up with the weekly changes were probably able to see the show regularly and even then it was a struggle. I know because I was one of those people trying hard not to miss it in spite of the constant time changes, delays and preemptions due to football.

By season 4, the Futurama writers were comfortable with the characters and setting and had honed the show's humor to a razor edged sharpness that cut incisively into the foibles of modern life. Like all good science fiction, this show used its futuristic setting to illuminate the everyday problems of today, the science fiction setting allowing the writers to work with topics that might have been otherwise censored if dealt with more ""realistically"".

While making hilarious social commentary, the show also took great advantage of its futuristic setting to make light of some of the more absurd and incredible story ideas of many poorly conceived science fiction stories, like time travel, super heroes, nearly identical parallel universes and more. Even some of the better science fiction stories and TV shows get poked a bit, as in one episode devoted almost entirely to making fun of the original Star Trek series and its fans, featuring guest voices by most of the cast from that series.

I bought this set the moment I saw it and highly recommend it to anyone interested in the kind of outrageously funny humor prevalent in Matt Groening's other works, Life In Hell and The Simpsons. Futurama was still fresh and funny at the time it was cancelled and the 4th season of shows are not to be missed. The extra features on this DVD set are great and include commentary by writers and production staff, deleted scenes and more, but it's worth buying just for the shows alone.",1093564800,5,2207,4.7272727272727275
2074898,4,B0002B15J2,"Futurama is a great cartoon, and in only four volumes, it went through quite a big evolution.  The first volume introduced the characters and the particular brand of humor, the second was the most consistently funny, the third had a combination of the best and worst overall episodes, and the fourth took its chances with some plot and emotion heavy episodes.  While Volume Four is certainly a good buy, I did find myself dissapointed at times with the lack of laughs (as compared to previous seasons).  In spite of this, there is still a lot of good stuff, and the highlights are as follows:

HUMOROUS EPISODES

Love and the Rocket: Bender gets romantically involved with the A.I. of the Planet Express, and lots of great gags occur (especially in the first half).  Overall: B+

Less Than Hero: The crew gains superhero powers. Hilarious homage ensues.  Overall: B+

Crimes of the Hot: This is a very funny piece about global warming.  It's consistently funny and creative all the way through, and one of the best purely funny episodes in the set.  Overall: A

The Farnsworth Parabox: The Professor creates a paralell universe where everyone has a double.  After a somewhat slow start, this episode gets funnier and funnier.  Overall: A-

PLOT-BASED/EMOTIONAL EPISODES

Jurassic Bark: Fry tries to bring his petrified dog back to life.  The plight of the Robo Puppy and a very memorable, upsetting ending makes the episode a must watch.  Overall: B+

The Why of Fry: The evil brains are back, and this episode reveals a lot of secrets regarding Fry's past.  Plot heavy but very interesting, this is an excellent episode.  Overall: A-

The Sting: An emmy-nominated affair about killer space bees that end up killing Fry early in the episode.  Following his death, Leela begins to go crazy.  Very plot heavy again, but also very trippy and creative.  Too bad some of the jokes fall flat.  Overall: B+

The Devil's Hands are Idle Playthings: Fry trades hands with the Robot Devil in order to play the holophoner and impress Leela.  It's the final episode, and it's funny and emotionally rendered.  I was left wanting more, but that's probably what the writers intended.  Overall: A-

----------------------------------

Final Thoughts: There's still great humor present, and the emotional journey of the characters is suprisingly well done.  The best episodes are still to be found on Volume Three (Rosewell, Parasites Lost, Amazon Women, Luck of the Fryrish, and Anthology of Interest II are all-time classics), but the stuff in this season completes the evolution of the short-lived series.  My only other complaint is Dr. Zoidberg: Previously hilarious in volumes Two and Three, here his dialogue is frequently flat and pointless.

They have enough guts to put on ""Futurama"" or ""Firefly"" or ""The Tick"" or fill-in-the-blank (your favorite cancelled show here), but then do everything they can to sabotage them.  Schedule ""The Tick"" opposite ""Friends"" and ""Survivor,"" for instance.  Run ""Firefly"" but run it out of order (they aired the pilot last).

And poor old ""Futurama,"" it got sacrificed to the NFL every Sunday.  Baffling.

Expectations were incredibly high for this show and in my opinion, it more than lived up to them. Sadly, fox seemed intent on burying it in terrible timeslots, pre-empting at every oppurtunity, and just neglecting it. With this box set, which includes some of my favorite episodes, this will complete the collection.

Comparisons to the Simpsons are inevitable and some characters are quite similar (Fry-Homer, Professor-Grampa, Leela-Marge...) but its still its own show and in my opinion is easily on the same level of quality as the Simpsons.

2074908,2,B0002B15J2,"I have purchased the first 3 volumes of the futurama series.  i never really watched the show when it was on t.v.  since i have and love all the simpsons seasons that have been release as well as every season of south park on dvd, i have to say futurama is really funny, SOMETIMES.  you pretty much have to sit through idiotic episodes to get to the funny gags.  when they do hit, they are right on.  but this show is far inferior to the simpsons.  with the simpsons you get good plots, strong characters, and of course funny jokes.  the simpsons are just more streamlined.  futurama's plots many times don't make much sense (same problem with the Family Guy).  with a better plot the gags are much funnier.  i can completely see why fox canceled this show and it did not catch on with the general public.  i am a fan of animation stitcoms, so i will be buying vol. 4, but if your not sure, you're better off sticking with the simpsons or south park.  those shows are much better.",1090972800,8,980,4.324175824175824
2074909,5,B0002B15J2,"I have seen most of the Futurama Episodes. I did not see all yet thanks to Fox Network's habit of pre-empting this fine show for football (which I thoroughly HATE). I own the first three sets, and greatly look forward to the fourth. Why Fox canceled this show, I cannot fathom. The ONLY other Fox program I watch is the Simpsons. Family Guy is the WORST animated show that I have ever seen, but I understand this since the American audience obviously likes idiotic garbage such as reality shows, etc. I even wrote Fox network. I asked them why they found it necessary to preempt Futurama for football when they have a sports network (along with the plethora of sports networks and programs), and true to American business practices these days the did not answer my queries. Oh, well. It still is one of my most treasured favorie programs.",1090886400,16,838,4.630872483221476
2074910,5,B0002B15J2,"It goes without saying that FUTURAMA was the greatest cartoon television cartoons ever produced. It is more hip and far more witty than the corporate produced The Simpsons. The vulgar South Park. The uninspired Family Guy or the bland suburban King of the Hill. I live in Europe and have watched Season 1-4 on DVD at least five times. The show just has classic pop culture parody appeal. The only weakness of the show was the tendency to focus on obvious parody (the cameos by the original Star Trek cast) rather than the subtle implied campy Sci-Fi humor that made the show great. The last season hads it's extremely weak moments which make me realize why the show was cancelled such as the ""ROUTE OF ALL EVIL"". There is a sequence in that episode featuring a paper delivey route that is just idiotic. Other than that the show is hilarious and any fan needs the complete set.",1090022400,12,876,4.585987261146497
2074911,5,B0002B15J2,"it's a shame this show got canceled because it is superior to the simpsons in almost every way. while the simpsons is funny, it is hasn't changed at all and is way too politically correct. the story in futurama actually evolves and it managed to be an interesting show throughout it's run. one main reason for this is because there are so many more different characters, places, and situations in the 31st century.",1089763200,4,414,4.684931506849315

Even though all they show now are reruns on Cartoon Network, I stay up until 12 just to watch the show. In my opinon Fox should bring the series back. If they can bring back the lame ass show the family guy they should give the future another shot. But all I can say in my opinion Fox has booted they best show around PERIOD.",1089676800,4,430,4.070588235294117

I'd like to know where people can see sales totals for DVD releases.  If the crude and highly esoteric ""Family Guy"" could get revived, I don't see how Futurama couldn't, FOX is clearly selling enough Futurama to have put out all the volumes onto disc...
Still, Futurama was an intelligent and witty animated show.  That type of show, in America, is few and far between. I'm highly grateful 20th Century FOX has released these episodes and using dual layer discs using the utmost quality transfer.  I may not dig their politics, but at least they respect their consumers.",1089417600,5,661,4.681034482758621
2074915,5,B0002B15J2,"Very little on television could match Futurama.  At it's height (seasons 4-8) the Simpsons squeaked a narrow lead in the laughs-per-minute category, but it was also allowed a better chance to grow and mature than Futurama did.
Futurama, quite obviously, takes place in the future.  And while it has sci-fi themes and many references to ""classic"" sci-fi, it's more a show about the pop culture of our time.  Pop culture references are mostly endless, and always very, very sharp.  One needn't appreciate science fiction in order to adore this show.
This season gives us the following:
- Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch - Not one of the best episodes, but still quite humorous.  As the name implies, Kif finds himself pregnant.  6/10
- Leela's Homeworld - Slightly better than the previous episode, this explores Leela's past, and how she came to the orphanage. 7/10
- Love and Rocket - A Bender episode, and a high quality one.  Bender woos the new AI in the Planet Expresship.  We all know how serious Bender is about commitment, and you can see disaster coming lightyears away.  8/10
- Less Than Hero - Fry and Leela manage to aquire superpowers and fight evil with Bender, who forces himself in the group.  Largely a parody of 60s superhero shows, this is another quality episode.  7.5/10
- A Taste of Freedom - An episode with deeper meaning, and an episode centered on Zoidberg, leading to an episode low on laughs.  4/10.
-Bender Should Not Be Allowed on TV - Bender finally makes it onto All My Circuits.  Biting commentary on the impact of television on children.  8/10
- Jurassic Bark - Fry delves into his past and manages to find his dog.  His petrified dog.  Hilarity certainly ensues, 9/10.
- Crimes of the Hot - Global warming is looming, and the professor realizes his robot design (used in all robots) is the cause.  A solid episode, 8/10.
- Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles - An instant classic, and surely the highlight of this set.  All the characters find themselves aging backwards, slowly becoming infants.  Ever wondered what the professor was like as a young man?  Hysterical.  10/10.
- The Why of Fry - The brains are back, and again only Nibbler and Fry can save the world.  Well made, chock full of big laughs.  9/10.
- Where No Fan Has Gone Before - This episode features the original Star Trek cast.  I'm no Star Trek fan, don't believe I've ever seen an episode, yet the world around it is common knowledge and pop culture.  Big laughs are again ever-present.  9/10.
- The Sting - A surreal episode, beginning with Fry's death and Leela blaming herself.  A risky episode, yet the team has the talent to pull this together quite nicely.  9/10.
- Bend Her - Bender changes his gender.  Bender episodes are never as funny as the rest, but this is still quite entertaining.  7/10.
- Obsoletely Fabulous - Another Bender episode, as Bender fears he has become obsolete.  7/10.
- The Farnsworth Parabox - Farnsworth has created a parallel universe in a box.  Sharply written with numerous hysterical paradoxes, this episode is a distinct winner.  10/10.
- Three Hundred Big Boys - Thanks to a dubious military victory, the whole planet gets $300 to spend as they wish.  8.5/10
- Spanish Fry - Fry awakes from a camping trip without a nose.  Yes, it sounds like a simple plot, but this episode has a great deal of fun with its setting.  8/10.
- The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings - Ah, the irony of making deals with the robodevil.  Ah, the irony of Fry outsmarting someone!  10/10.
Yes, some of these ratings are low.  The reason for this is they're rated relative to each other.  Had they been placed on their own merit against nearly any other series they'd all be 9s and 10s.
All of the episodes contain commentary, often quite biting towards Fox, often a bit chaotic, and always hysterical.  Many of the episodes contain cut scenes, some of which are also very funny and worth watching.
If you love Futurama I'm sure this series is already yours and you're merely reading the episode listing to see how wrong I have my ratings.  If you aren't familiar with Futurama, or have only seen a few episodes, jump on this!  Jump on it now!  You won't regret adding this to your DVD collection.
The end of a great series.  For shame, Fox.  How could you have denied the world of such pleasure and laughter?",1088467200,210,4321,4.626315789473685
2074916,5,B0002B15J2,"I view the release of this, the final collection of Futurama DVDs, with mixed emotions.  In my opinion, the fourth season was the best, and I have been waiting for this collection, well, almost since the last episode aired on FOX.  Finally, it's here.  But now, sadly, there is nothing left to wait for.  If you buy only one animated, sci-fi parody DVD collection this year, make it Futurama.",1088467200,,392,4.63768115942029
2074917,5,B0002B15J2,"What a sad state of the Fox network that they continue to bombard us with crap like ""The Simple Life"" yet cancel one of the best shows of the modern age.  It's actually a bit depressing.  Though this season lagged a bit in the beginning, it ended on a high note.  The final episode ""The Devils Hands are Idle Playthings"" is perhaps one of the most entertaining episodes of Futurama's entire run.  It includes almost every character, except it sadly leaves our Lur and gives only a passing glance to Zapp Brannigan.  AT any rate, even if you are a passing Futurama fan, this DVD is definetly worth the money.  The sheer cleverness will keep anyone familiar with pop culture thoroughly entertained.",1088380800,7,696,4.663934426229508
