7960476,5,B0000648XJ,"David Del Valle gives a fantastic interview with Vincent Price covering many of the great highlights of his career. Some very nice additional content on this disc as well. I was quite happy to find this for such a decent price considering it is long out of print.

Well worth a look for Price fans.",1498780800,,298,4.418181818181818

7960478,4,B0000648XJ,"This DVD presents a super great interview with Vincent Ptice.  Otherwise, there are 2 tv episodes in the special features which require mention.  Both of the episodes have very good picture quality.  The Goldfoot episode includes the original commercials and the Half Hour to Kill pilot does not.  Unfortunately, All Day Ent. has the deplorable practice of adding their watermark to their special features.  I found that it could be removed by scaning back to just after the program started and letting it play from there.  However, it comes back at each chapter stop, and then the process has to be repeated back to the chapter stop.  If not for this issue, this would be a definite 5-star.",1329523200,,691,4.805084745762712
7960479,1,B0000648XJ,"The intervview was interesting.  However, I downloaded this feature so that I could use the content focused on Three Skeleton Key.  This 30 minute feature doesn't seem to be included, as stated in the decription.",1193011200,,212,5.0285714285714285
7960480,5,B0000648XJ,"this DVD contains an interview with Vincent in 1987 at the peak of his career. Vincent talks about all parts of his career spanning 1935-1987 and he seems to get the most fun talking about his plays or the friendships he has made in his career. When the host of the special brings up certain segments of his horror career, Vincent says what he thinks about his movies or the scripts or whatever without apology. Some of his critiques of his own films are too negative. He's often too hard on himself in some aspects. Aside from the 1987 interview, the DVD also contains a 42 minute radio {audio} interview and two TV shows he appeared on. There's also a radio show called ""Escape!"" that you hear. There's also a 1965 TV show called ""The Wild World of Dr. Goldfoot"" that ran as a promo for the Goldfoot film. The DVD ends with 200+ pictures of him at various stages of his career. This DVD is wonderful and a nice companion to Victoria Price's book about her father and Lucy Chase Williams' book on Vincent's films.",1056758400,11,1014,4.456989247311828
7960481,4,B0000648XJ,"this video was really good except for the Shindig episode. Dr. Goldfoot was kind of awful.  With Vinnie having done so many great shows, i would have preferred to have seen him recite some Poe work or even the Thriller Rap!  Vinnie lives!!!",1041638400,,240,4.558139534883721
7960482,5,B0000648XJ,"An absolutely wonderful disc dedicated to the memory of one of the greatest actors of all time. I have always been a Vincent Price fan, and was overjoyed to see this come out on DVD. If you love Price this is highly recommended for you. The interviews are wonderful and very informative, the extras are just as good. My favorite extra on here was the Shindig special of The Wild Weird World Of Dr. Goldfoot. Get this DVD right away!!",1023235200,6,433,4.425
7960483,5,B0000648XJ,"If you are a fan of Vincent Price, this is a must-have DVD.  The main interview alone makes this purchase worthwhile.  Called the ""Sinister Image,"" this hour long televised interview focuses on Vincent's career in horror and fantasy films.  It is a real gem, allowing the viewer to see the real Vincent -- witty and entertaining.  He tells some great stories and makes you laugh again and again.  This DVD also contains a second audio interview that is just as informative.  The image archive is also a real treat.  This features lots of very interesting and unique production stills, promotional shots, and candid photos.
The rest of the DVD focuses on a part of Vincent's career that often gets overlooked -- television and radio.  Included are two television episodes and a radio show featuring that famous voice.
Overall, this DVD features some rare and truly great stuff.  A must buy!",1023062400,7,889,4.873333333333333
