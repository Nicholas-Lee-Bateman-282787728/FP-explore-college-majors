8393448,5,B003B3OVCQ,I'm a big fan of Yuri Shapochka and I actually appear on this DVD.  His movies are deep and thought provoking while being entertaining.  His filming style is creative and innovative.  The two films that are on this DVD will have you guessing what is coming next and may also make you shed a few tears.,1421884800,,301,4.339285714285714
8393449,5,B003B3OVCQ,"Honestly, I think that these two short films that writer/director Yuri Shapochka has made are amazing.  I read his bio and from computer genius to writer and director is quite a jump.  Maybe it took a leap of faith, but for sure, Shapochka has found a niche in the industry with these films.  Curious and clever, deep, dark and thoughtfully funny, there is satire and conundrum, and even a little sideways humor in his artistry.  What a refreshing new face!  The actors are genuine and believable.  Be careful what you ask for.  You will get it in these two films.  Worth the money spent!",1267833600,,588,4.586538461538462
