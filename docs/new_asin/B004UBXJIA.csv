8441377,5,B004UBXJIA,Hadn't had Anthropology 101 since 1953.  Now content and methodology have extended themselves tremendously.  My old professor (Robert Bell) would have welcomed the voluble Edward Fischer with open arms and a basketful of yams.  --Richard Wilson,1470268800,,244,5.722222222222222
8441378,3,B004UBXJIA,"I hate to have to say this, but this series could have been accomplished in far fewer than 24 lectures if the lecturer hadn't repeated things so much in every lecture.  It got to be seriously annoying...and I tend to overlook a lot of ""flaws"" in Great Courses lecturers.  He also spent way too much time focusing on the peoples in whom he was interested....areas could have been better addressed with a more globalized approach.  If these two issues had been non-existent....this would have been an 18...or perhaps even 12....lecture series....and earned five stars.",1365897600,3,566,5.0
