1381077,5,B00004Z4VE,"When I first began to study film history, Fritz Lang's ""Destiny"" was a film I never expected to see. It was widely considered a ""lost"" film. When prints surfaced in the '60's, I anticipated seeing it very eagerly. I saw it as part of a course in the aesthetics of German expressionism/surrealiism while in graduate school, with a synchronized taped music track especially created by one of my fellow students. I was enthralled. Since films were available ""as film"" in those days, I knew that, sadly, my budget precluded my ever hoping to own a print. Thank the gods for DVD!

""Destiny"" is surely one of the finest films of its time and place -- a pinnacle of German filmmaking.  It contains humor, adventure, pathos and visual poetry. the acting, executed by a top-rank German cast, is stylized, but in ways very suited to the distinct art of the silent film. The special effects, done by means as old as film itself, and far cruder than today's computerized examples, still surprise and delight. ""Destiny"",

as a whole, tells several stories within an elegiac framing, but is still tightly organized and coheres to reveal itself as a visual/dramatic poem

a ballade. It is one of the most beautiful silent films I have ever seen.",1163030400,12,1230,4.76056338028169
1381078,5,B00004Z4VE,"I am very cautious about recommending silent films but some transcend genres. This is such a film.  Basically, Death takes
a woman's lover, and she embarks on a quest to save him. The theme of the movie is the Song of Songs...""love is as strong as death.""  Here the Death figure takes pity on the lover as
the Queen of Hades took pity on Orpheus in the Underworld. The photography is dreamlike, transporting the viewer to distant, exotic lands.  This is not one of Fritz Lang's best known works but I believe it approaches the genius of his other film oevre. I am privileged to own this DVD and I see it once a year.",1139356800,8,616,4.339130434782609
1381079,4,B00004Z4VE,"I bought this movie on a whim.

I knew of Fritz Lang and I am a fan of silent films so I thought I'd take a chance on this.

I'm glad I did,

This is a wonderful movie, and the visual effects for a film that is over 80 years old are impressive.

The three sub-stories, where the heroine tried to win back the life of her fiance, are sad and unique from each other.

I'm giving this film 4-stars.

I was disappointed that there was no film history information or discussion on this DVD. I thought that the Image Entertainment release would include this, but I guess they didn't think it was necessary. Oh well.

Otherwise an outstanding film and in great condition, considering it's age.",1135987200,8,686,4.354330708661418
1381080,5,B00004Z4VE,"Destiny is one of Fritz Lang's lesser known films, but it is one of his best. The story begins with two lovers who find themselves separated from each other when Death moves into the neighborhood. Death has created a huge burial ground surrounded by walls almost up to the sky and no door to enter. He takes the man away from the woman who desperately tries to get him back. She follows Death and finds him beckoning spirits through the tall walls, her lover in the crowd. She begs Death to return her love to her, and he shows her three candles that are getting shorter as they speak. He tells her that if she can save one of the three people whose life's flame is growing dim, he will return her lover to her. She then enters three different historical settings to try to win her lover's life.

The film is somewhat similar to DW Griffith's masterpiece Intolerance in that it switches between four stories, each similar to each other but in different time periods, to establish one overall story. However, Destiny achieves it better by a mile, effectively switching between them so the audience understands and by not letting any of them run on for too long.

Destiny is an eerie, supernatural type of a film but it is also quite relatable and interesting to watch.",1135900800,8,1267,4.552631578947368
1381081,5,B00004Z4VE,"DESTINY or to be more precise WEARY DEATH (Death is tired of man's hatred for just doing his job) was the first big international success for Fritz Lang and his collaborator Thea von Harbou. She would marry him after this film and be responsible for his scenarios until Lang left her and Germany in 1933. They made quite a team with von Harbou's romantic quasi-mystical stories softening the hard edge of Lang's no-nonsense direction. He gave her stories depth while she gave his films compassion. I digress about Lang and von Harbou because DESTINY reveals the various aspects of their developing relationship while engaging us with its allegorical story of Death and Love triumphant.

The plot is relatively simple. In an old German village Death takes a young maiden's fiance' and she tries to get him back. If she can prevent any one of three characters from suffering a preordained fate (hence the English title DESTINY) Death will restore her loved one. This allows Lang and von Harbou the opportunity to use exotic locales for the three separate stories making this one of the first anthology films. After she fails to alter their fates Death gives her one last chance. She has one hour to bring him a life in exchange for that of her betrothed. The sets, the lighting, the camerawork are all exemplary. German expressionism meets Scandinavian pastoral meets film noir. The performances may seem exaggerated in places but remember this was not meant to be realistic. Bernhard Goetzke however is outstanding as the weary but compassionate Death.

This new Kino Blu-Ray version is a significant improvement over the old Image DVD. The framing has been corrected and the color tints used are not as saturated as before. The editing in the climactic fire sequence is tighter but it's still somewhat disjointed which may be due to the fact that Lang's original version no longer exists. This edition restores the original German text to the title cards as well as the the different styles of font used for each story which is a nice touch. There is a new musical score is by Cornelius Schwehr and it's performed by a full sized symphony orchestra. While it sounds impressive, I prefer the old Rodney Sauer score for its immediacy and intimacy.

DESTINY remains my personal favorite among Fritz Lang's films for its allegorical nature and striking fairy tale imagery. Having just watched this new Kino Blu-Ray, I find it necessary to revisit and to upgrade my old review. A new restoration requires a new review after all. This release from the F.W. Murnau Foundation is certainly a 5 star affair although the new score, as mentioned earlier, is not completely to my liking. The new title cards are subtitled but there are no English ones which may bother some people. In closing (considering the nature of the film) I should report that Thea von Harbou died in Germany in 1954 while Fritz Lang died in Hollywood in 1976.

1381082,5,B00004Z4VE,"A young couple, very much in love, stop off at a tavern in a small 19th century German village.  A gaunt, grim faced stranger joins them.  Just recently the stranger had purchased a 99-year lease on a tract of land adjoining the village's cemetery.  The stranger had built an impregnable, `without door or gate', wall about the estate.

 The stranger, of course, is Death, and within the walls of his `garden' reside the souls of the newly dead and the innumerable candles whose flames melt the tallow of all human life.  Death attends the young man he is about to claim.  The woman leaves the room for a moment, and when she returns the stranger and her beloved are gone.  The woman gives chases, sees the shade of her beloved pass through the impassable wall to Death's garden.  An old apothecary finds the distraught woman and shelters her in his pharmacy.  The woman drinks a potion from an ancient bottle and is again in front of the walled garden - although now there is a door opening to a steep staircase.  The woman enters and meets Death of the staircases.  I want to go where my beloved is, the woman tells him.

  Death strikes a bargain - if the woman can save the life of just one of three whose candle has grown short, he will return her fianc to her.

  I liked Fritz Lang's DESTINY (Der Mde Tod) a lot.  Death's bargain plunges the movie into three episodes, as the actors playing the loving couple and Death reenact endangered love stories in Arab, Italian and Chinese settings.  Lang employs primitive, and effective, tricks - camera angles, double exposures, etc. - to show the dead filing past the living, to make carpets fly and to transform pagoda into elephants.  Underpinning it all is the fascinating struggle between Death and Love.  It's Lang's meditation on this struggle that I enjoyed the most.  After that poignant scene on the staircase I was hooked on the woman's quest for reunion.

  The musical underscore is appropriate, tasteful and unobtrusive.  The print is in good condition, watchable with flares and scratches.  Although this disk is a little pricey, it contains no extras of any kind.",1115683200,21,2129,4.681081081081081
1381083,5,B00004Z4VE,"Destiny is not a particularly good title for Fritz Lang's Der Mde Tod. Translated literally the title means `The Tired Death' and this is much better, for the film is about Death being tired of the work he has to perform. The figure of Death thus becomes a fairly sympathetic character trying desperately to help. When he is appealed to by a young woman who has just lost her fianc, he gives her three chances to bring her beloved back from the dead. Lang shows a room full of candles each representing a human life and then shows three of these candles flickering and about to go out. The task that Death sets the young woman is to save any one of the three lives represented by the candles. Lang then shows the woman and her fianc in three stories representing each of the candles. These stories are wonderfully imaginative and present vivid images of Persia, Renaissance Venice and China.
Lang's film is full of amazing special effects including a flying horse and flying carpet sequence which influenced Douglas Fairbanks when he made The Thief of Bagdad. However, it is the emotional atmosphere of the film which makes it truly memorable. Lang shows the desperation of the young woman and makes us care about her plight. But it is with his image of the compassionate Death that Lang really shows his originality. This is a Death wishing and willing to resurrect the dead and going as far as he can, because he cares about the woman and her fianc also. Finally Death becomes a caring friend wrapping his arms around the couple. It is an ambiguous image, but one of great power.
The quality of the print used for this Image DVD is superb. It is colour tinted in a variety of shades and shows very little damage. This is a beautiful film and all the details of the amazing production-design can be seen and appreciated. There is some slight cropping of the film on the left hand side, but this is hardly noticeable. The credits and the title cards have been reconstructed and newly translated. The original fonts have been reproduced, which is fine, but it must be said that the Gothic typeface can be a little hard to read. Finally the film is accompanied by a fine score which fits in very well with the eerie mood of the film.",991699200,90,2231,4.552238805970149
1381084,4,B00004Z4VE,"I've only ever found really poor quality, often chopped up versions of this early Lang film (Der Mude Tod is original title), but this DVD looks fantastic.  The film itself is pretty unique, worth watching, but not a masterpiece, especially in light of Lang's other achievements.

1381132,4,B00004Z4VE,"The story is interesting - a bargain with Death, to restore the loved one take from her. She is assigned three tasks ...

Well, I won't spoil it for you. This silent film captures a lot of its era, not always for the better. Dramatic faces and makeup carry a lot, and the optical effects were state of the art almost until Harryhausen's day. The story's end leaves a thoughtful ambiguity, too: who actually won, Love or Death?

On the less favorite side, one of the three tasks takes place in some anonymously Arabian country, and another in China. I understand the need to invoke immediately-understood icons to orient the audience, especially in a silent film, but that can easily degenerate into stereotype and caricature. But, in fairness, one era's popular culture is another era's culturally offensive slur, as seems to be the case here. Looked at that way, it captures, like a bug in amber, xenophobic attitudes that we are well rid of.

Enjoyable in itself, if you can accept the antiquated idiom, it's also a fascinating look at the popular culture of that time and place.

A young and bitterly grieving widow conspires with Death to cheat Fate in an attempt to win back the soul of her beloved.  Death gives her three chances to change the detiny of a doomed lover in three different scenarios.  Wonderful special effects, a story that gallops along, and very thoughtful reflections on the human condition.  There are particularly wonderful scenes towards the end when the widow begs various cripples and infirm citizens to give up what's left of their lives and free themselves from the painful life they affect to despise.

1381175,5,B00004Z4VE,"A young couple meets and falls in love.

Tragically, the woman loses her man.

Her love is strong, so she has the power to chase down death himself.

Citing the Bible (at Song of Solomon) she says:  ""Love is stonger than death.""

For his part, Death, relents in his mission to give this woman not one but three chances to be reunited with her man.

Dramatically this movie portrays those three chances as three burning candles.

""Save one and your husband will come back to you.""

Only in the portions of this movie following the story of those three candles does the woman truly shine and earn the reunion her heart so desparately craves.

In my opinion, this is not only the finest silent movie I ever saw, but also one of the finest movies period.  In fact, in my future dealings with non silent movie fans I intend to use it as an example (along with the Melies classic, Journey to the Moon) as an example of just how rewarding this particular art form can be.

But don't take my word for it.  Check this movie out for yourself...and be amazed.",1288051200,5,1048,4.401041666666667
1381176,5,B00004Z4VE,"Though this movie wasn't Fritz Lang's first, it was the one that catapulted him to fame.

And viewing this classic shows why.

Set in the same anywhere and anytime that all fairy tales seem to take place, Destiny is the story of a young woman who tragically loses her husband to be.

Desparate to bring him back, she tracks down Death himself in search of a bargain:  Tell me what I can do so that you can return my fiance to me?

Fortunately for her, Destiny's Death is a particular compassionate one.

He shows her three candles and tells her if she can keep any of them burning...then her love will be returned to her.

Through those stories we follow our lead to Arabia, mideval Italy and China as she tries to keep those candles alight.  Each of these vignettes is a compelling story in its own right and utilizes what were then cutting edge special effects.

But it's perhaps in the movie's closing scenes, when the story is told largely shorn of special effects that the movie assumes its perhaps most poignant moments.

This movie originated in a dream and Fritz Lang's certain directorial hand shows the confidence that would so become the hallmark of his later career (see, e.g., the better known Metropolis and of course M).  This version retains the score that Lang intended for distribution and in this way it can be said that this serves as the ""director's cut"" of Lang's vision.",1287878400,4,1393,4.59919028340081
1381177,5,B00004Z4VE,"The enormous importance of ""Destiny"" resided as a perfect transient movie that linked two key stages in the cinema. One on hand, as untamed creator, Fritz Lang was also influenced by four giants films. Cabiria (Giovanni Pastrone), Intolerance (David Ward Griffith), The Golem (Paul Wengerer)and Leaves from Satan's book (Carl Dreyer). But also, he exerted notorious influences over Ingmar Bergman (You will realize that  it's more than obvious the personage of the Death in ""The seventh seal"" was adapted from the main personage of this film), Marcel Carne (whose incorporeal nocturnal poetry in Les portes de la nuit or the vanishing end in ""Les visitors of the night""), Erich von Stroheim (""Greed"") Murnau (""Nosferatu"" and ""The last man""),  Jean Cocteau (Orpheus) and Alfred Hitchcock, Robert Siodmak (in lesser degree) were part of some of the countless directors that were decisively inspired by this monumental movie.

Told according the mythical canons, the film tells us about a weird and dark personage, who erects a huge wall that hides a dreadful mystery, will ruin the destiny of two young lovers, inquiring so, the sorrowful beg of the bride. He will deal with her, proposing her she is capable to save just one of these three lives in extinction, he will bring her back his lovable fiance.

A monumental masterpiece that well deserves to be watched by all those new generations. Let's turn our eyes to the unerring classics.",1244160000,,1437,5.076271186440678
1381178,5,B00004Z4VE,"""Destiny"" is surely Fritz Lang's most unusual and memorable silent film, standing out from his very different commercial successes with popular themes about crimes and intigues in films such as ""Spiders"" and ""Dr Mabuse"" - and of course, his most renowned classic, ""Metropolis"".  But ""Destiny"" is a world away from these, and in fact, it has a completely other-world atmosphere throughout, from its medieval-style European village setting, unusual and mysterious characters, and the frequent transitions from the real and present world to other dimensions.  Described as a gothic fantasy, it is also a profound love story, and tugs at the heart and soul of all viewers because it addresses a universal fate and question:  death, and whether our lives are destined to end at a certain time.

Along with visually enthralling scenes and haunting images, perhaps the most poignant part of this special film is the young woman's deep love for her fiance, whose life was taken much too soon.  Determined to reclaim his life somehow, she firmly believes that ""love is stronger than death"" and sets about making a deal with the mysterious dark stranger who represents Death who dwells in another dimension, in a dark room full of many burning candles, each one representing a human life.  It is his unenviable job to extinguish a candle's flame when God has decided someone's time to die has arrived, but the man called Death has grown tired of this chore and the suffering it causes people.  In the course of making this deal with Death and Destiny, the desperate young woman is transported to three separate realities:  old-world Persia with the charm of the Arabian Nights; Renaissance Venice and ancient China with all its rich traditions, but each setting contains the same tragic fate of lovers separated too soon by death which she cannot prevent, no matter how hard she tries.  Fine attention to detail, costumes and exquisitely designed sets give these three other worlds extra vibrant beauty, and the superb musical score by Rodney Sauer and the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra heightens the beautiful, poetic and mesmerizing atmosphere of the film.

Destiny is far more than a ghost or horror story, or a fantasy with supernatural themes; it is a beautiful work of art, crafted by a master of cinema, whose work continued to excel in later decades in the United States in the Film Noir genre, but reached its creative zenith already in the silent era of Germany in the 1920s.",1243123200,7,2480,4.968599033816425

  The casting is likewise appropriate, especially Bernhard Goetzke, with his gaunt chiseled features and languid look.  Many filmmakers were impressed and inspired by this masterwork, including Douglas Fairbanks, whose ""The Thief of Bagdad"" drew much from it.

I wish people would not give the entire plot away in these reviews; leave it to the viewer to see and judge for themselves.

7928188,3,B00004Z4VE,"Destiny doesnt quite rank with other Fritz Lang films, particularly Metropolis and Dr. Mabuse. However, its notable because it marked a shift in the German expressionist movement away from crime and horror into more epic material.

Based on a dream that Lang had as a child, the film is about a woman (Lil Dagover) who saves the life of her husband (Walter Janssen) by agreeing with Death (Bernhard Goetzke) to go back in time into three different eras and attempt to rescue her husband in each story. Her time travel takes her to ancient Persia, 17th-century Venice, and Imperial China. Death is bored with taking lives, and thus offers to play this game for his own amusement.

Production design is impressive, especially in the sequence in which the young woman locates an entrance through a cryptic wall leading to Deaths realm. She climbs the stairs to encounter Death, who brings her to a candle-filled room. Each candle, he notes, represents a persons life and each flame is permitted to burn or is extinguished by the will of God. This scene is eerie and suspenseful, but the bulk of the film is static and talky  a major drawback in a silent film. Lil Dagover appears too old to convince as a young bride, but Goetzke as Death turns in a terrific performance.

The structure of Destiny (1921) resembles D.W. Griffiths Intolerance (1916), with its multiple settings in different periods of history blended with a modern story. The movie doesnt reflect Langs later mastery of tracking shots, and therefore often appears stage-bound. Editing is often sluggish, undermining the build-up of tension. A rumination about love, loyalty, and fate, Destiny eventually settles into a cinematic morality play.
