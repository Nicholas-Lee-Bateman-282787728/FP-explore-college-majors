1622712,2,B00005LMBA,"Well . . .Lemme see it wasn't horrible the sex scenes and do not have enough life in them it is as though actors are bored, although the opening sex scene with Amber Newman saved it all, the only reason I watch the film over and over and over again, I gave it a whole star just for that scene",1087084800,4,292,3.8833333333333333
1622713,5,B00005LMBA,"I love Roxy (Shyra De Land), so a beautiful woman. the guys are bodybuilders and bad actors. Had anybody informations about Shyra DeLand, I need more satisfaction!!!!!!!",1074729600,2,169,5.296296296296297
1622714,4,B00005LMBA,"I've seen bits and pieces of this movie on Showtime or Cinemax I believe and I thought it would be good to have if it ever came out on Video. I found a copy here on VHS ... I heard from other reviews that this movie is softcore which I believe, but I have to admit there are a lot of sex scenes like one where this guy gets it on with this girl in front of everyone in a bar place and I liked some of the Lesbian Scenes, but they could've been a lot better. Anyway it's pretty cool of what i've seen so you might check it out. I would buy it if I were you cause it's kind of hard to see this movie on cinemax or showtime!",1048032000,4,621,3.712121212121212
1622715,3,B00005LMBA,I was expecting to get a copy of the show that I had seen on cinemax. This was little less hardcore &  unrated than the original version.,1374192000,,137,4.074074074074074
1622716,4,B00005LMBA,It looks like they are just dryhumping.they always find a way of hiding what they are really doing so its in your imagination what they are suposed to be doing.,1370044800,,160,4.366666666666666
1622717,1,B00005LMBA,"I've got several DVDs from Surrender Cinema, but this is definitely NOT one of the better ones. Judging from several of the other reviews on here, I must have gotten the edited version of ANDROMINA, since on my copy the sex and nude scenes are really short and tame, although my copy does not show any rating at all. Several times a couple of the ladies are shown nude only for 5 to 10 seconds before the movie switches to another scene!! There's one odd scene where 2 of the ladies get in a fight, tearing off each other's clothes, but they're hardly shown without clothes AT ALL, and the film there has clearly been severely and sloppily cut. The longest sex scenes run maybe 1 minute or so, which is also short compared to similar movies, and really are just the beginnings of sex scenes. Even the way most of them are filmed is tame. For instance, on some scenes the camera only shows the actors' upper bodies.

The premise of the movie is ludicrous too, with some male ""astronauts"" going to a ""pleasure planet"" full of women to look for some ladies to work in a strip club back on Earth. The most absurd aspect is that the women on this ""pleasure planet"" hate men, so WHY would they be good choices for a strip club??? Also, the ""astronauts"" aren't even shown traveling into space. Looks like even on a very low budget the producers could have found some stock footage of a spaceship taking off from Earth! The cover is also misleading, since it shows women in alien makeup, while in the film itself they do not appear alien at all.

I was going to give this 2 stars since ANDROMINA does have numerous hot actresses in it and a decent number of nude scenes, as brief as they are. BUT I dropped it to 1 star because the DVD looks bad too, with some odd picture noise, mainly black specks, running through the whole film. I'm trying to figure out what good I can get out of this DVD, but it's not going to be much!",1331596800,,1917,4.322222222222222
1622718,3,B00005LMBA,"Okay this is the first review I have done so dunno where to start. The obvious if you like the cover art and think it might be a more r rated Avatar, don't buy this movie. There are no blue girls or waterfalls like in the cover art. But it does have one remarkable and savior in it's mist. One of the leaders on this planet is played by Flower. She is beautiful and reminds me a little of Grace Park from Battlestar Galactica, but is no means as beautiful as Grace. Her scenes are a little disappointing because there wasn't enough skin. The movie itself really has no plot and the acting is quite horrendous and the sex scenes are barely r rated at all. I would save your money for something better.",1331164800,2,700,4.231343283582089
1622719,1,B00005LMBA,This movie was crap it was so edited that it could have been mistaken for a childrens movie I wish that I never bought it.,1301270400,,122,3.92
1622720,1,B00005LMBA,"I made the mistake and bought the Unrated DVD version and it stinks.  I am currently trying to give it away and see if anyone sales the Director's cut version.

Please do yourself a favor and don't buy this version of the movie.",1216684800,2,228,4.27906976744186
1622721,1,B00005LMBA,"If you are watching a Surrender Cinema film for the plot and production values you have problems I am not going to go into but if you want goofy fun sexuality this company an this movie can be a real winner. I will warn you the unrated version they are selling is the edited version. I have seen 3 cuts of this movie NC-17 very hot, R for cable etc. and the one being sold here, if they just edited out an additional 36 seconds it would be rated PG-13",1170460800,,451,4.022222222222222
1622722,1,B00005LMBA,"There appear to be several versions of this movie floating around. There is an ""unrated"" version and a ""directors cut"". I know there is a ""directors cut"" on VHS but I don't think a DVD version has been released yet. The DVD ""unrated"" is a bit cleaner then the directors cut in that scenes are shortened and things have been trimmed down. If you saw this movie on t.v. as I did then you saw the directors cut and will probably be very disapointed in the other version(s) as quite a bit is taken out. Its noticeable how much is taken out after seeing two different versions of this movie. One version looks PG 14ish with so much having been taken out and seeing a censored version of a movie with simulated action is kinda pointless.

To be clear and to try and help someone avoid being disapointed, as I was, if you really liked this movie on t.v. or saw it on video you probably saw the directors cut and may want to check carefully which version you are getting when you order it. I am not sure the directors cut has come out on DVD yet I only know the copy of the DVD I got when I ordered is way different (a lot toned down) from the vhs directors cut version I got a couple years ago.

I gave this product one star. If it had been the directors cut version brought out on DVD like I thought it was then it would have got a lot higher.",1140048000,25,1337,4.118773946360153
1622723,1,B00005LMBA,"Once again, Koch, for reasons that I cannot possibly fathom, assumed that people would enjoy this movie more if the brilliant story and dialog weren't being constantly interrupted by those annoying sex scenes. I know I'm feeling large amounts of gratitude. It's gratitude when you want to disembowel someone, right?

At least the copy I bought was used, so Koch didn't make a dime off of me. Anyway, this is another Koch release that you should definitely avoid.",1114905600,24,462,4.923076923076923
1622724,3,B00005LMBA,"This is a strange movie even for this type.  Andromina is a pleasure planet although all we ever see is a small strip bar with peeling cinder block walls.  The aging proprietress is now all alone as virtual reality has killed the business.  Some space truckers (or whatever) decide to help the place out.  They will go find new girls to work as ""hostesses"".  Now it gets really weird.  Apparently the best place to find women to serve men and play ""hostess"" is a planet where men are forbidden and hated.  Sure.

So the group gets to the forbidden planet and encounter various tribes of women.  Apparently, except for a severe-looking blonde with a cattle prod (no lines), all of the women on the planet secretly want men.  Sex, captivity, and seduction fill out the bulk of the movie until Andromeda is ultimately saved.

Ok, we know what this film is supposed to do and it does it fairly well.  An attractive cast and some interesting twists in the plot make this one of the better offerings of this type but they really should have done something about the opening premise.",1108684800,15,1076,4.575916230366492
7944039,2,B00005LMBA,You rent this for the skin. There isn't very much and the acting is EXACTLY as bad as you think it'll be. Not entertaining and not good enough for a wank. Pass.,1497916800,,160,4.03125
7944040,1,B00005LMBA,"One of the lousiest 'adult' videos I have ever seen. Filled with bad porn music and slow-motion 'erotic' scenes that were not at all erotic and had little nudity. Let's face it you aren't going to rent a movie like this for it's great acting or dialogue. But this is so disappointing. If there is some prohibition on showing soft porn on Amazon, then instead of showing what are either badly made or weirdly censored movies they should remove them completely. Apparently this gets 2 1/2 stars because the DVD and VHS wer not censored.",1486857600,2,534,4.631578947368421

7944047,2,B00005LMBA,I bought this soft porn DVD as a gift for someone else. NOT ME. However my Gran said she didn't enjoy it and would have preferred something with more c**ks in it.,1406592000,2,162,4.09375
7944048,4,B00005LMBA,"I was fortunate enough to get an R-rated version of this film.  it delivers everything and then some that I expected from softcore Surrender Cinema. If I were younger than fifty something, I'd have watched it half a dozen times the first day I got it.  You don't buy this kind of film for the acting ability, music or background architecture.  I can't imagine anybody viewing the R-rated version and being disappointed.  Really attractive women and lots of variety and frequency of them showing off.  The writers, directors, and editors weren't very creative, and well, they don't have to be.  It is supposed to be Sci-Fi Fantasy by genre, but it doesn't take long into the movie before you don't care about that anymore.",1389830400,,721,4.774193548387097
