8599216,3,B00DYFUYNQ,"I have watched the first 12 minutes and it reminds me of all the lectures I sat through in Nursing School. Truly not what I was expecting. I then pulled the presentation forward & noted there is a wee bit more which may be helpful...the information is good but I have the Wheat Belly book & cookbook so this isn't anything a person would really need in addition. BUT, it cuts it down so if you are a person who does not like to read, you could get the basics of the book in this DVD. The DVD arrived early and well packaged. The vendor is good. Thank you. NOW, WHO is Patricia Steele? The narrator is male.",1393891200,,606,4.1440677966101696
8599217,5,B00DYFUYNQ,Now this is a best kept secret. I have tried almost everything out there and this information seems more on point than anything else. I'm looking forward to getting the results . I recommend this to anyone who is serious about getting a head start on their belly fat issues. Thank you for the super quick shipment and the professional packaging. This seller takes great pride in customer service .,1388534400,,397,4.685714285714286
