8574582,5,B001JP668U,"If you love the ocean north of San Francisco, the Golden Gate headlands, Point Reyes, Cronkite Beach, Limantour, Sea Ranch, this DVD will help soothe your homesickness for these amazing places.  Broad vistas as if you are sitting high up above Muir Beach and dreaming...

This dvd is perfect for meditation, yoga or just having on -- for those who love simple, calming (but not musak-ish) music playing with waves gently crashing in the background, the sounds alone make this dvd worthwhile.

I'll put this on for dinner parties, mornings with coffee, soothing candlelit baths, or a romantic evening for two.  Also good for those who own and run a spa for many reasons!",1225497600,,669,4.842105263157895

Aquarius

Atmospheric HD Art. Change the mood of any environment with cool ambiance. Leave it on and relax.

Bring the hypnotic healing effects of the sea to your screen. Soothing gentle waves crashing onto sand, rocks and beach. This is unlike anything you have ever seen before. Aerial ocean views intercut with shore level waves breaking, and wide overview beach shots set to clear, crisp classic piano music with the sound of the sea subtle under it all. The abstract aerial coast views creatively turns the ocean into art. ""Aquarius"" is refreshing like a cool mist. The sea has long been a destination for rejeuvination. The sea air and sounds seem to clear the soul.

This is part of the Earth, Wind and Fire series. Called Aquarius because pure h20 is the true elemental liquid not sea water. The astrological symbol for Aquarius is said to represent waves or ripples of water. Water plays an important role in many legends and myths. There are mythological water beings and gods, stories of heroes that have something to do with water, and even stories of isles and continents lost below the surface. Some say staring at the Sea is wanton and addicting. Ask any sailor.

Some find the sounds waves elixr to fall asleep at night. ""Aquarius"" is meant to be part art, part meditation, part cooling and part relaxing. It's not meant to be watched like a film, but if you do, it will take you away.

Filmed on the Northern California Coast in Marin County.",1225411200,,2476,5.368556701030927
