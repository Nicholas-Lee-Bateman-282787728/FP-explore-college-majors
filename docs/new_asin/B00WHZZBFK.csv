8713469,4,B00WHZZBFK,"Extremely well put together, this anime actually does a better job of reflecting real life than most.  The problems it addresses in terms of age and behavior gaps are not really resolved, and while the story progresses, it never resolves the issues.

It is enjoyable, it is fun, but it is only the first part of the story.  If this was a novel it would be the opening chapters, the beginning of change, but apparently the resolution is in the next volume.",1528329600,,455,4.524390243902439

8713471,5,B00WHZZBFK,"- Synopsis: An anime showcasing the life of a student that falls for another resident at his newly arrived apartment complex. He has a tough hurdle to jump over, as she is reticent and is a huge bookworm. Much of the interactions between them is awkward, which often creates misunderstandings. Not only that, his other roommates are of unique personality and backgrounds. Tune in as this whacky slice of life comedy filled with romance takes you into the lives of these eccentric residents.

===========================================================================================================

- Comments: This anime is obscure and underrated for sure. The cast is likable, and the main character often gets trolled by his other roommates. Though he's a pretty innocent kid, so watching him cringe and such was funny. Overall, this is one pretty happy anime that makes you feel good inside. The viewer might end up cheering for the main character throughout the series. That, or might find him annoying due to his hesitation or mistakes.

- Features: Japanese audio with English subtitles. Contains 13 episodes on 3 DVDs with a run-time of about 5 hours. Rated TV-14 due to some fan-service and suggestive dialogue.

- Conclusion: Great anime if you're looking for laughs and to smile. I also liked the songs that were played in this anime. Fits various situations perfectly. It's a nice refreshing comedy with some silliness and 4th-wall breaking, but not so much it cannot be taken seriously. Excellent combination of  comedy, slice of life, and romance.

8713476,5,B00WHZZBFK,"The artwork and story is good. It simmler to Love Hina. It has 12 episode. The only problem is the story is to short. It about the boy and the girl. Both go to the same high school and houseing complex.  There is no real end. It seem to left thing open. I would like to see what happen with those 2 kids. Also with the rest of the supporting cast, I like to see what happen with them!",1440892800,3,384,3.8607594936708862
8713477,5,B00WHZZBFK,"Usa Kazunari was hoping to escape his middle school nickname of ""freak show"" by attempting to be an ordinary high school student living a typical average life. Unfortunately the residents of the Kawai Complex all have bizarre issues, and they are much stranger than the students he hung out with in middle school. His saving grace is the owner's granddaughter, Ritsu Kawai, a quiet bookworm who also tries to live a normal life, but secretly enjoys doing the silly activities the other residents are fond of doing. He soon finds himself ""managing"" them just as much as he had done in middle school.

It's mostly slice of life, following Usa and his interactions with the other residents of the dorm. There is some romance, but I found it kind of dull until a girl he used to go to middle school with shows back up.

The comedy is what helps make the show worth watching though. It's always fun watching Mayumi complain about not being able to hang onto a boyfriend when several of her younger female co-workers are getting married. She can't seem to understand that it's because she always goes after the playboy jerks who tend to cheat on women, and always blames someone else for it.

Or a lot of things Usa attempts to do to impress Ritsu gets commented on by the adult residents, often making it seem very perverted, such as when he's reading on a hot day in his work uniform while leaning on a wooden support beam. Mayumi and Shirosaki, another resident, comments on him ""standing erect"", with ""fluid gushing from him"". They then mention that Ritsu went to the library earlier, so she wouldn't have seen this anyway.

I first saw this show on crunchyroll, and still watch it every now and then to help relax before going to bed.",1440028800,5,1733,4.616883116883117
