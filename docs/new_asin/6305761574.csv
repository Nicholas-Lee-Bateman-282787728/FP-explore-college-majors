7893953,1,6305761574,"The basic premise behind this drivel is simple. Kid's Mom has died, has new Step-mom, makes friends with gorilla, gorilla gets shot, gorilla gets better, everything works out just fine.
Except that is, for the film itself. Fan's of this genre of film would do better to avoid this and go for the far superior ""Born to be Wild"".
Even Malcolm in the Middle's Justin Berfield (Reece), who is usually pretty good, can't hold this dreadful film together.
He manages to pull off a couple of nice emotive scenes, but that's about it.
The gorilla is about as convincing as a trash can in a dress, the music is lousy, the direction is tired and dull, and the less said about the script the better. Not even worth catching on TV.",1053129600,5,719,4.4961832061068705

7893956,5,6305761574,"Justin Berfield is so Hott! This is about a boy who just wants a pet, mom, let him keep her!",970272000,,92,3.65
7893957,4,6305761574,"I ONLY RENTED THIS MOVIE BECAUSE I THINK THAT JUSTIN BERFIELD IS REALLY QT.  IT ACTUALLY ENDED UP BEING REALLY GOOD, I GUESS.  IT FOCUSES ON A BOY WHO DOESN'T LIKE HIS STEPMOTHER AND ENDS UP HAVING TO GO BUY HER SOME MILK  FOR A RECIPE SHE'Z MAKING.  HE ENDS UP SPENDING THE MONEY ON A DOG.  HE  TELLS SOME CRAZY STORY AND KEEPS THE DOG IN HIS ROOM.  SHE ENDS UP FINDING  IT AND HAS TO BRING IT TO A SHELTER.  HE'Z REALLY UPSET AND HAS TO CLEAN  THA GARAGE AS A PUNISHMENT.  THEN HE MEETS THA GORILLA WHO HAS ESCAPED HER  EVIL TRAINER.  HE HELPS HER AND A  BUNCH OF FUNNY STUFF ENDS UP HAPPENIN.  IT ALL ENDS UP BEING A HAPPY ENDING AND THATS ALL THAT MATTERS.",960595200,8,660,3.9692307692307693
