5598559,3,B00BEJL4XS,"I can see why Spring Breakers is meeting with the greatest financial success of anything Korine's done-- well, aside from the fact that the title and poster gives it a built-in ""confused audience"" who will go in thinking this film is something that it is not. All the revenue-friendly acres of skin totally aside, the film is just plain more slick and mainstream-friendly in its overall look and feel than most of Korine's earlier efforts.

Korine's made mostly uncomfortable films, but in Spring Breakers, most of my discomfort stems from the fact that the main characters (save Alien, whom I never would have encountered on campus to begin with) are the very same types of people I went out of my way to avoid back in college. This film is as close as I ever want/wanted to get to the real spring break experience... and particularly on the big screen, it's close enough, thank you.

But while the slo-mo party sequences seem believable enough to me, my biggest problem with Spring Breakers lies in its believability. Practically out of the box, we see the girls engaging in a criminal act that would be well outside the behavioral scope of 99.999% of college-enrolled millennials, no matter how totally self-absorbed.

That act, as it turns out, is needed groundwork for what happens later in the film, after the four girls meet with James Franco's Alien character for the first time. Alien is a ""street entrepreneur."" He acts not so much as a devious corrupting influence on the girls, more as a natural catalyst for bringing out their barely-hidden inner sociopaths. If not for the early crime the girls took on of their own volition, we'd never be able to buy what happens after they meet Alien.

Franco's portrayal of Alien is really, really great and truly believable, at least to the point of what he's given to work with in realizing the character. But therein lies the problem: again, in the real world, a foursome of college-enrolled girls would tolerate Alien's creepy advances for about five minutes before bolting, no matter how deep-running their bad-girl streak. Instead, they inexplicably stick around and ultimately help him form a merry, scantily-clad band of gangstas, leading to the film's admittedly fun and totally absurd third-act climax, none of which ever would have happened in a million, billion years in reality.

There are other believability problems with Alien himself which aren't Franco's fault. Namely, we are supposed to believe he's a big / rising player in his local underworld, requisite for the plot to advance as it does. Alien's definitely not the sharpest razor in the pack. If this were the real world, he'd have ended up popped from one boneheaded move or another before advancing past the corner-dealer stage. But answering deeper questions about his actual suitability as a major criminal force on-screen would definitely cause the desired plot trajectory to come completely apart, so we're just shown a bunch of dope / guns / cash and asked to buy in.

This film moves surprisingly slowly. The slowest-moving section is the first act, the process of the girls figuring out how to get out of Dodge, slow / overdone to the point where when they finally get to meet Alien roughly at the film's midway mark, it already felt like third-act time to me.

Maybe Korine wanted us to get to know these characters in detail, but there's simply not enough to them as people to get to know. The four central girls are purposely one-dimensional characters with nary a personal thought or genuinely reflective tendency in their heads, and I'm quite sure that's by Korine's design, so he should have known better than to try and explore what simply isn't there.

Adding to the pacing issue is the repetitious, heavy-handed editing. In addition to repeating scenes as flashback fodder, Korine is fond of playing snippets of the same dialogue over and over during montages to ""make points"" about the characters or over-explain their motivations. It's irritating and unnecessary. I can't emphasize enough how much better the film would have been without this eye-roll-generating dialogue-looping. I was reminded of The Room's endless ""transitional"" shots of the Golden Gate Bridge - except that I rolled my eyes *less* at that.

I strongly disagree with a read of Spring Breakers as some kind of ""cautionary tale."" To do so would be pure cynicism about millennials, borne of the perpetual generation gap. I don't think much of what happens in this movie could possibly apply or happen to real people resembling these archetypes. I left the theater saying, ""So... what was the point of all that?"", which is something I sort of expected going in based on past exposure to Korine's work.

Still, the film did stick with me somehow. The visuals / cinematography make up somewhat in terms of realism for the aforementioned problems with plot, dialogue and character development/interaction, giving the film a distinctive, palpable vibe.

This is a guilty pleasure movie, not even so much for the copious amount of flesh on display, but just as a pure escapist / style flick that does have just a little more brains, soul, and squirm-in-your-chair to it than the average mainstream escapist flick.

Is it an arthouse film? If so, barely. Is it a must-see? I definitely wouldn't say that either, but at the very least it should make for interesting water-cooler discussions with the fellow indoctrinated.",1364169600,29,5427,4.951648351648352
5598560,5,B00BEJL4XS,"A true modern exploitation masterpiece, Harmony Korine delivers on every single level and then some. Great performances all around... yes even from James Franco. His character is so vile and outrageous, definitely a career best from him in my opinion. The green band trailer really does not do this film justice, what's offered here really is a tour de force. I can't wait to buy the DVD and watch this over and over again. By far the best film of 2013 so far. Highly recommended!",1363910400,32,480,4.658823529411765
5598561,4,B00BEJL4XS,"""Spring Breakers"" (2013 release; 93 min.) is the latest movie from writer-director Harmony Korine, best known for writing the controversial 1995 movie ""Kids"" and his subsequent directorial debut ""Gummo"" a few years later. His latest project has been buzzed about for months, due mostly as a result of an intruiging premise: 4 girls, including once Disney TV ""good girls"" Vanessa Hudgens and Selena Gomez (the other 2 girls are played by Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine), descend on Florida for spring break and become ""bad girls"". As the movie starts, we see Selma's character (Faith) as being ""the shy one"", while the other girls are ready to rock, except they don't have any money. The three girls decide to rob a fast food/diner-type using a fake gun and a hammer, and pull it off. Once in Florida, all four party it up (and up and up). A few days into their spring break stay, a party goes out of bounds and the girls are arrested for drug use. They don't have the money to bail out, but a local rapper-gangsta called Alien (played by an almost unrecognizable James Franco) decides to put up the bail money. At that point we are about 40 min. into the movie, and to tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: I felt the movie started off quite tentatively, if not predictable. The highlight of the first half of the movie is easily the robbery of the fast food/diner, as Korine films it from the outside (riding along in the pickup truck of the girls), and we watch as the girls intimidate/threathen the diner's customers for money. As the girls settle in for spring break and the partying goes on and on, I felt the movie needed a jolt to provide it some direction. As if by magic, that is when James Franco comes in and takes the movie to another level, and correlating, we slide away from the non-stop frat boys parties to the real story of the movie (sorry, don't want to reveal more). What to make of the ""bad girl"" performances of Hudgens and Gomez? Let me just say that Hudgens gets the far better end of that deal, and comes across far more realistic and believable than does Gomez. At one point in the movie, the James Franco character tells her ""you're so pretty, but you look like you're only 15"", and right he is, she does look like she's 15, and not just being ""the shy one"" but also ""the weak/scared one"". If this is Gomez's idea of an ""image change"", she may have misfired badly.

The music plays a huge role in the movie. Skrillex and Cliff Martinez scored the original soundtrack, and it sounds great. But there is plenty of other music in the movie. For some reason, Britney Spears gets big ""thumbs up"" (at one point, the 4 girls start singing ""...Baby One More Time"" and later in the movie Britney's ""Everytime"" comes at a key moment). But there are also songs from the Black Keys and Ellie Goulding, just to name those (""Lights"" plays over the end credits). Bottom line, ""Spring Breakers"" is an intruiging, if ultimately flawed movie (mainly because of the first half of the movie), but the second half of the movie has enough interesting elements to it that I can recommend this, warts and all.",1363910400,9,3216,4.533562822719449

5598793,4,B00BEJL4XS,"Released in 2012 and written & directed by Harmony Korine, Spring Breakers chronicles events when four freshmen girls (Ashley Benson, Vanessa Hudgens, Rachel Korine & Selena Gomez) dubiously acquire funds and go to Spring Break in Florida where they party hardy and eventually land in jail. The situation takes a potentially hazardous turn when a stranger, a gangsta rapper named Alien (James Franco), bails em out. Gucci Mane is on hand as Aliens rival.

This is a combination art film and serious crime/drama, but it also satirizes Spring Break libertinism and ventures into fantasy in the final act. The overall filmmaking is top-of-the-line, including the surprisingly excellent acting of the four anti-heroines. Franco is unrecognizable (to me) as the rapper, obviously modeled after Dangeruss and RiFF RAFF (the latter suing Korine because of it).

The movies entertaining as a mesmerizing look at Spring Break hedonism and all that goes with it. Rachel, the directors wife, is particularly fetching. The debauchery is interestingly balanced out by some spiritual references, particularly one of the girls Christian fellowship. However, the second half switches gears once Alien is introduced. I liked the message concerning the anchor of faith, hope & love making a person sensitive to impending peril, granting the wisdom to abscond.

What lowers my rating are some eye-rolling vulgarities (e.g. the gun fellatio scene) and, especially, that I couldn't buy the two main girls as intimidating lethal hoodlums, whether at the beginning with squirt guns or later. The ending in particular was thoroughly unconvincing, IF were to take it as reality.

The picture runs 94 minutes and was shot in St. Petersburg/Tampa/Sarasota, Florida. Be forewarned: This is a hard R movie with loads of profanities, vulgarities and nudity but, like I said, surprisingly balanced out by pious elements.

5598887,5,B00BEJL4XS,"Harmony Korine's film SPRING BREAKERS (2012) is wayyy underrated. Has anyone even seen it? I saw it in theater with my dad four years ago when it came out. Only on second viewing does its significance resonate.

This is serious 1990s-2000s zeitgeist material. Read that sentence twice.

Funny, disturbing. Sexy, horrifying. Fiction-flashy, hyper-real.

Glib MTV product one minute, deep critique of same the next.

What's so amazing about many scenes is you can take what's being said literally and feel it and believe it from a teenager/early 20s in 90s point of view, and at same time see it ironically and as absurd from an adult perspective (eg when Faith is reflecting about how spring break epitomizes the beauty and ultimate meaning of life and spirituality -- it's done as satire, but I remember feeling exactly like that in perfect moments on hedonistic vacations with my friends in teens and 20s).

Ambiguous and complicated depiction of 90s/2000s hip hop culture and psyche. ""Pretend it's a videogame. Imagine you're in a movie or something."" And yet entertaining throughout, never seeming pretentious or ""arty"". It's an action comedy after all, just so dark and satirical and ... something ... that it is so much more.

Albert Camus would love this movie. And be horrified by it. 1950s post-war nihilism ain't got nothing on contemporary consumer culture and celebrity worship.

""Why did this happen? We were just having fun. We didn't do anything wrong. This was supposed to be forever. This can't be the end of the dream.""

The overvoice narration punctuates themes in a natural, unobtrusive way.

The character ""Alien"" is James Franco's most ambitious role by far. Brave acting. What actor in their right mind would take this role? Should have gotten an Oscar.

Great writing. Beautiful cinematography.

Franco's exhortations about ""All my sh*t! Look at all my sh*t!"" -- ie clothes, shoes, colognes, guns, high tech apartment accoutrements -- is pop culture gold.

Universities should be holding conferences on this movie.

See it.

Or see it again.

The good girls that go to school, great family, morals, education, innocence, immaturity and a boring life in a small town vs a life of a drug dealer, lost all his siblings, never had a real dad or mom around, is into drugs, guns, violence, murder, etc...Ultimately the two worlds clash in an unrealistic way which was not inline with the msg since it swayed away from the brutal reality to fantasy of the girls killing a hole gang had that had nothing to do with reality and the msg that we live in two separate worlds and mostly don't realize or even think it is possible that the other world even exists, and often as close as 20 min away. The ending def killed the msg or I would have given it 3.5 stars. (not possible but that is what it would have been worth since the rest of the movie also had nothing to do with the msg but could have easily been tied into it and they failed to do it.
I used to live in a nice Chicago suburb with a great, non criminal, lifestyle with top High Schools. But a 20 minute ride along 290 east, and you are in ""west Chicago"" =drugs, killings, prostitution, broken buildings, empty dirty lots, crack heads acting crazy, shoot outs every week, bar wires on liquor stores etc... I went to a Chicago Public HS so I experienced the other world early on. Mothers sell their body for dope  in front of their young kids. A HS football teammate tells me that he lost his virginity at 7 when his uncle caught him spying on him and his aunt having s.ex. So his uncle ""makes him a man"" by making him f his aunt. Also seen two 6-7 yr kid cousins fight until bloody and the family doesn't stop them but encourages them and gives them pointers. When they finally stop them. There is no room for crying or they would get whopped by elders for being ""soft"". They are told to take it like a man and its tough out here, they better learn not to back down now or the streets will eat them alive. Then they have the kids hug each other and tell them that they are supposed to protect each other no matter what and that this was just a lesion and practice good for both of them...It was a shock for sure. I think this move just touches on the surface of that subject and fails to complete the moral of the story. It had no real ending, so the semi fantasy ending made it even worse. Overall ok to watch when bored. Wont watch it again or recommend it. There are better movies portraying the msg. I thing they cared more about attracting young kids to watch all the party scenes with naked girls, and the waned to show a msg for the more mature. They def failed on their second point and made the first intention less interesting for young kids because their ending had nothing to do with either of the two sides of the movie.",1488240000,,2925,4.204626334519573

This movie is so dumb it hurts.  Anyone claiming it's some sort of deep social commentary knows nothing about the actual breadth and depth xpanse of youth culture and the party or drug subcultures.  I'm not saying I'm an expert, but even from my limited knowledge/exposure i immediately realized how shallow and absurd the characters and subtext (or lack thereof) are.

I like some of this director's work for its absurdist surreal atmosphere and unique view of the world, especially his depiction of certain horror aspects of rural youth.  However, this movie missed the mark on so many levels and was so one dimensional and boring that I can't begin to understand what happened to this director.

My only thought is that he's become so removed from the subject matter he once explored so ingeniously that he can't relate and has therefore become irrelevant in his the areas he once explored and seems to be unwilling to move on from.

I hope he evolves his expression to look into what his life now encompasses rather than trying to explore old tropes that are no longer relevant to him or the world because I respect some of his past work, but if this film is a sign of what's to come, his future isn't promising.",1481846400,,1223,4.660465116279069

It's a movie about youth existing outside of reality where life is all about them and where consequences don't exist.",1481241600,,475,5.2631578947368425

The surreal feel to the culmination of events all brought together by fantasy birthing harsh reality made one single point clear; be careful what you wish for, you might get it then lose it all.

5599075,3,B00BEJL4XS,"Spring Breakers is the sort of movie that a person doesn't quickly forget, having once seen it. Unfortunately, that's not necessarily a compliment.

The premise is that four young girls are aching to get away to the Florida vacation spots on spring break. They've been good little college girls, but now they want to experience something different from their every-day drudgery. Unfortunately, they don't have a lot of money saved up for the big event, and so they steal a professor's car and hold up a diner and suddenly they're flush with cash... at least to a point that will allow them to take the vacation.

They head south, taking a quick break along the way to burn the vehicle they stole. Once they arrive at their ultimate destination, they make the party rounds, when not riding rented scooters. Some of them call home, to assure concerned parents that they're just fine. They also spend a lot of time in the swimming pool, talking excitedly about how they came here to ""find themselves."" They hope that this can last forever.

But of course, it can't. The girls are soon arrested at a party, and thrown into jail. Then they are bailed out by a guy they don't even know, who saw them in court. ""Alien"" (played convincingly by James Franco) is a white man who fancies himself a drug kingpin. He has ""Scarface"" on constant loop on the DVD player in his crib, which he watches while lying on a bed of money, with automatic weapons hanging on his wall. He is a horrifying figure, and now the girls have to question whether the new identities they are forging are really the identities they want. There's no law saying they all have to arrive at the same answer.

At 94 minutes long, Spring Breakers doesn't sound like it should last long enough to meaningfully tell the complex story it presumably hopes to tell (and no, I haven't summarized more than the first half or so). Movies with subject matter in this vein commonly bump up against the 2-hour mark, and Spring Breakers feels more like it was trying to be a comedy. Even with the abbreviated duration, scenes drag and repeat. There's very little dialogue of any importance that isn't repeated two or (more often) three times, and very little of it is profound enough to warrant even the first instance. There also are a lot of scenes that play out in slow motion, or with quick flashes from one perspective to another, which depict obnoxious partying: girls guzzling beer from hoses attached to kegs, guys licking drugs off naked young ladies, topless women screaming and yelling for the camera.

Some other viewers have argued that all of these scenes serve no purpose, that they're gratuitous filler and too numerous besides. However, I see them as actually the primary point of the movie. The girls are trying to find themselves, after all. They're just going about it in all the wrong ways, surrendering to temptation and deluding themselves into believing that they're doing something meaningful. That, or they're just falling happily into the self-destructive roles society has arranged for them.

There are some beautiful, poignant moments that serve no apparent purpose other than to be beautiful and poignant. They stand out, unfortunately, because they are so uncommon. And there are some absolutely gorgeous shots, from an artistic standpoint, and there is a bunch of ridiculous dialogue that says ""This is satire"" and expects you to either get the joke or to respond with disgust. Either reaction, I think, is just fine. Either reaction seems to be what the director was probably going for.

I'm left unsure just who the movie was most intended to satisfy, though. There are parts of it that worked well for me, but the bulk of it either bored me or depressed me. I don't need a movie to tell me that life sucks and people are self-destructive and hung up on the wrong things. Getting through to the end of the film was sometimes a struggle, though the effort involved did lessen by around the halfway point. I wouldn't say that Spring Breakers entertained me in the conventional way that I like movies to entertain me, and the message I got out of it wasn't complex enough to challenge me, either. But I'm hesitant to dismiss it as pure garbage, the way some have. That's because I believe there's art here even though a lot of it isn't to my taste. The director clearly tried to do things differently, and he managed to make that work in spite of things. It just didn't work in a way that I can recommend to anyone who isn't looking for obnoxious satire.",1474848000,,4531,4.698992443324937

5599117,1,B00BEJL4XS,"I have no idea what I just watched....This movie seems to be totally lost and confused in it's own self! I didn't know if I was watching some kind of porn, a gangster movie, a drug/alcohol movie, a musical or a teenage film.

It was hard to keep track on what was even going on in the film. There were too many flashbacks moments or too many flashforward moments, you easily get lost on what the movie is trying to show you. The characters were not even entertaining and we're boring. There was so much butt shaking and breasts, they would just show it for no ryme or reason in connection to the plot of the movie except a bunch of kids at Spring Break. I know they say ""Sex Sells"" but come on! This was way too much and point less. There is a lot more that happens then just sex at spring break.

I remember when the movie released in theaters that people were upset with Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens were in this film. I give them credit for wanting to branch out of the Disney scene, but clearly they picked the wrong movie to do that. The ending wasn't even believable!

****Spoiler******:
I mean, are you really going to tell me that 2 teenage girls took out an entire gang and not 1 of the gang members could shoot them? That's an extremely hard sell and a big middle finger to the viewer. Very hard to believe.

This was one of those movies that was trying to be something and it flopped (and hard)!  If you're thinking about giving this movie a shot, I wouldn't waste your time. Even if you saw the DVD at a dollar store, I wouldn't even look at it. Let sit in the bin and let it go back to the manufacturer to be destroyed.

This was pretty bad film. I feel sorry for those who have purchased the movie ticket, dvd or any other format of it's released on. Just avoid this movie at all costs!",1474329600,2,1804,4.199421965317919
5599118,1,B00BEJL4XS,To be generous - it's garbage.

Sorry to say it, but if you didn't like it, you need to think outside the box!  James Franco rocks his role!  This is a non-conventional story, with a story line you'd not expect with a title like 'Springbreakers' but the way it's directed is uncanny.

There's lines in the movie that will be quoted and people will know exactly what movie your referring to!  And trust it!  Awesome or not to critics - if people are quoting it and know the movie, sorry ya'll.. but the director did his job and it rocks!

5599465,5,B00BEJL4XS,"Most poignant social critique of our time in the vein of Dostoevsky, David Foster Wallace and Breaking Bad. It offers an understanding of true morality that transcends and trenchantly critiques the ridiculous pop-morality peddled by our entertainment and media. Ours is a morality that gladly accommodates pleasure-seeking as the goal of life and the definition of 'pursuit of happiness'. We end up with things like the self-defeating contradictions of feminism that porn culture creates. Pleasure and thrill-seeking as full-time pursuits turn into a horror story, but unlike previous artful depictions of nihilism, Spring Breakers actually suggests an alternative by juxtaposing the character of Faith's moral struggle with her Christianity with the scenes of partying, crime, violence, power-plays and empty boring, meaningless sex. Believe it or not, to me  this just might be the best Christian film ever made. It presents faith, modesty, humility and prayer as an appealing alternative to all the nauseating porny trash. That's why it confuses and even enrages so many viewers who were expecting just to be titillated. People  who are watch porn and violence regularly (who doesn't now? it's all over prime time not to mention most movies) are claiming the film is misogynistic and unnecessarily graphic, but really we don't like to be confronted with our own participation in the sick and destructive trends of an imploding society. The viewers immortality is is thrown back in their faces and even if it's colorful and shiny and glamorous, somehow it's not cool at all-somehow it's unbearably uncomfortable. As the characters imitate pop culture, we realize we don't want to be like that. No Tarantino wish-fulfillment and pats on the back for not participating in the failures of past generations.

5599601,5,B00BEJL4XS,"It is understandable that maybe this film is not for everyone's tastes, the subject matter itself depicts the underworld and debauchery of modern American society and all of it's social ills in terms of the attraction to a degenerate ""party driven"" and ""hedonistic"" lifestyle of drugs, alcohol, sexual perversion, and a general foul immorality.

 In retrospect, even though one might not believe it when looking at this film's cover, James Franco's character is actually the good guy in this story and his acting is actually superb and believable for what this film's message, and plot is trying to depict.

 Basic premise: Young 19 year old bikini clad semi naked college party girls decide to go on an endless ramp of debauchery and indulgence in Florida, not wanting to take mature responsibility nor having any desire whatsoever to attempt to work at all in college.  These girls take advantage of their very attractive looks, and sexual prowess to further their agenda of an endless anarchy driven party.  The youngest, and mildly smartest  among this group of a very low IQ level, gang of teenage dimwits is played by the gorgeous young brunette pop singer Selena Gomez.  Gomez is exposed early on during her first semester in the Florida to former Pro-Wrestling super star Double J Jeff Jarrett's preaching.  On some level the message of human decency & basic Christianity sinks in ever so slightly, but thus young Gomez is tested by a trial of fire when her friends recruit her into engaging in a series of violent crime robberies.

 If one is a fellow fan of rated R adult level material, then this is exactly the film for you because on that level I was satisfied.  I also walked away feeling a really excellent message was addressed and stressed throughout this movie to younger teenagers and 20 to 30 somethings alike, that partying all the time and behaving like a vicious debaucherous low life has very serious consequences.  The engagement of negative behaviors which include the abuses of alcohol, drugs, and irresponsible out of control sexuality never led to a life of success or general human fulfillment, all the charms and enticements from that type of life provide in the end is a one way ticket into the gutter.  All of these characters, including Selena Gomez pay a price on some level for their actions.

 This film, judging from the reviews here has received a tremendous amount of hate and visceral, generally because the depictions in this movie are of an extreme sexual, and outlandish nature.  One can expect the rejection of this film from a audience base that has never spent any real time in the Florida's teenage to college age partying lifestyle subculture and its ugly underworld which lies behind the venura of fame and glamor.  As some one who has spent a fair amount of time in one of my favorite state's, the Sunshine State, this movie's depiction of that underworld was remarkably accurate and very well orchestrated in what I had personally perceived as a general documentarian showcase.  With the exception of young Selena, the girls in the story become so decadent, corrupted, sexually depraved, and so immoral in their crime spree that they ultimately transform into evil. The cynicism is quite disgusting too regarding the character's philosophy.

 Speaking as a generally very conservative, traditional republican I honestly believe sex and nudity are awesome subjects, particularly for film and television drama format, but what we have here is an accurate depiction of youthful indiscretion and hormone driven lust gone psycho to the point where many youths of our modern society have gone so astray that they the real people of reality are depicted accurately in this fiction.

The girls in the story are true portrayals of many American or Western youths of our modern world, who have been misled, not brought up correctly, and have corrupted visionless national failed leaders who have neglected their responsibilities to show the youth a fine example of proper ethical adult behavior that they should aspire toward.

 I absolutely enjoyed this film, recommend it as a warning morality tale for ages 11 to even 30 something adults (reason why is because movies like this show teenagers why behaving like a wild animal or a scumbag has serious consequences over the long run), and give it a big thumbs up with a grade of an A-.",1452902400,,4378,4.941336971350614

I'm willing to excuse the constant bikini wearing since it's a spring break movie but in a f*ing courtroom?! If you are under arrest, in a jail pending a court appearance you get a jumpsuit. Bikinis in a courtroom is just a bridge too far for me and sadly the movie just took a crap shortly there after.

Lots of wasted screen time dedicated to repeating the same inconsequential dialogue over and over again. If we are to believe or identify with the broken individuals why not develop them as characters. Instead we got a couple hot girls in bikinis who like doing bad things and not talking and a tattooed local thug who has a crew but then doesn't going up against his best friend/mentor with the aforementioned bikini babes.

I don't consider myself a critic in any way shape or form, but this was the worst movie I have ever seen.  In all honesty, I only watched the movie in its entirety to make sure it's just as terrible all throughout just so I can write an honestly scathing review. If I could give negative stars, I would.

The words ""Spring Break"" are said probably 100+ times. Many lines and shots are repeated over and over again, and scenes drag out much longer than they need to. There is no coherent structure to the story or any depth to these characters. I feel like this was just a chance for everyone involved with this film that they are ""tough"" and edgy but only fail to do so. I don't understand how this movie did not kill any of these actors' or the director's/ producers' careers.

If there's one person I sympathize with in this movie, it is the editor of this film. They had the daunting task of trying to piece together about 50 minutes of storyline and drag that out to a full 90 minute film by adding excessive amounts of topless girls and bros binge drinking and fornicating.

5602382,4,B00BEJL4XS,"This is a very divisive movie.  I get why some people have it rated one star.  Watching on Amazon Prime, I was close to turning this off after 15 minutes and giving it such a rating.

I'm very, very glad I kept watching.  The movie turns when you least expect it.  When it seemingly takes forever for one girl to make an obvious decision, the 'real' goods of the movie are ramped up.

I didn't even realize James Franco was the gangster, this is one of his best performances.  You're shown a world of violence and sexuality that may seem surreal and over the top.  But the gangster is based off a real life guy, so that makes it even more interesting.

Granted, some will feel like nothing happens in the movie, but I think they're missing the point.  Enjoy the ride, enjoy the characters, enjoy the view into this part of life that most of us have no idea of.",1441670400,6,860,4.285714285714286

You can't go in watching it without an idea of who James Franco is, the roles he portrays, and the meanings behind his movies. It starts one way and takes an incredible turn that my friends and I did not see coming! We have watched it time after time and still enjoy it like it's the first time. Of course, if you're expecting some serious plot and insane scenes - this isn't the movie for you. It's low key. It requires an open, fun mind. It's not MEANT to be hilarious.

5602713,4,B00BEJL4XS,"Harmony Korine made something very unique and special.  A movie with an underlying sub context of the drug underworld that somehow got mixed up with young and pretty college girls.  The movie plays as if it is a drug trip, so I recommend being high while you watch it.  Real life rapper dangeruss, the local St. Pete rapper  is among this cast of depraved drug lords like Gucci Mane and Franco's character Al (Alien).  The movie doesn't get into depth about the situations these drug criminals are in, or any history, but some of the scenes like the one with Franco and the girls singing Britney Spears is really trippy.  (youtube search  Spring Breakers Britney Spears)

All in all, it's worth adding this to the collection, cause it has some awesome parts.

The director purposefully leaves most humanizing details of the four college women on the cutting room floor, suspending for us too much identification or empathy with them. Kind of anti-Hitchcock in a very effective manner. Despite lots of gratuitous T & A  from these former Disney stars, the overall effect is more horrible than erotic. The usually Adorably squeaky cute Vanessa Hudgens does a great, if limited job of invoking the positively Faustian in her Machiavellian performance of a drug and alcohol addled gun moll harlot.

The first time you will hate it (I admit that I did too).
The second time you will be more open, but still skeptical (""hmmm..."").
The third time, you will be able to identify everything that makes this movie different from the rest,
and you will start to appreciate the uniqueness and cleverness of its many STRANGE aspects.
The fourth time you will simply recognize it for the marvelous piece of artwork that it is.

I have heard good things from around the way. I will be blunt, this is not a very good movie. If you are looking for a good story, good acting and substance well look elsewhere. The things that were going on in this movie were laughable and I don't see many people partying like this and I am 23, I am living it. The only good part is Franco's presence, he kills it as the criminal/rapper ""Alien"". Gomez isn't good, Hudgins isn't good but they try. Try to break from their pixel perfect disney channel images. It's like everyone is trying so hard ""LOOK AT HOW KIDS PARTY THESE DAYS ITS DISGUSTING"". The tone reminded me of the movie ""thirteen"" which was a movie with a story and well acted check it out but I was waiting for the entire hour and a half for me to salvage the movie and convince myself I enjoyed it.

5603141,1,B00BEJL4XS,"Note: I originally posted this as a comment on another review that had boiled all the one-star reviews down to men in their early twenties who were either looking for a good time and didn't get it, or didn't like the social commentary it presented.

I am 23, and I hated this movie.  So far, you have got me.  I did not watch this movie for a good time but rather because so many people said it was so bad, that one day at my friend's house I had to watch it when we saw it on Netflix.  ""It can't actually be the worst movie ever!"" I said to him, but he assured me that it was.  I had been under the impression that this movie was intended as a film for a 'good time,' as you put it, and I still thought that after viewing it, until reading your review just moments ago.
I do believe you are correct on Korine and his intended message, but the film was just unpleasant.  Many viewers may have seen what it was supposed to be and just didn't care, as with its cover and choice of actresses they did not go into it for moral complexities but just to see beautiful girls showing off their bodies.  They did not get quite what they wanted.  Personally, I could not have cared what this movie was about or what content was in it because the incessant repetition of lines and scenes (not to mention bad ones) and the scatterbrained timeline would ruin anything for me.
For instance, Predator is one of my favorite movies ever.  I love the over the top attitude it takes to so many scenes, the violent themes, and the classic Last-Man-Standing plot.  While these are very different films, these elements are all shared with Spring Breakers.  However, if you viewed all the scenes in a different order while listening to some one-liner rumbled by the heavily accented Arnold over and over and every ten seconds you got to watch five more seconds from the scene in which Arnold covers himself in mud, the movie would only exist to be laughed at.  No one could enjoy it as a serious action movie and it would forever be given one-star ratings by people who did not enjoy watching it, regardless of how good it could have been.
Most one-star reviewers apparently didn't feel a one-star movie was worth their time to write about and so you have short uninformative reviews that might not reflect their complex reactions.",1439424000,5,2308,4.404705882352941
5603142,5,B00BEJL4XS,"This is a cinematic masterpiece. James Franco is truley inspiring in his role as Alien, y'all. This is a social commentary, stripped down to a cautionary tale to our troubled youth. Although spring break is not this dramatic (I assume...)

Franco has taken our modern ideals and blown them up to the extreme. Spring Breakers depicts the epitome of a culture of consumption and disregard for human beings. All the while, the camera work and shots take you through an almost otherworldly trip (not so otherworldly if you've been to college) of the parties and drug abuse of our disenfranchised youth.

As someone living in southern California, the surrealism shown here is not lost on me. Spring Breakers is a potentially true story.",1439337600,3,554,4.821052631578947

It was visually well made, shocking on many different levels that challenge your perspectives and expectations of characters.  I was very uncomfortable through it, and that alone made me realize how different this movie really was made.  Be ready for a ride, when you watch it.

If you were hoping for anyone on the album cover to ""express"" themselves, you will be disappointed.

James Franco plays his part fairly well, but there is only so much you can do with a bad script.

5604031,1,B00BEJL4XS,"Oh good lord, how can people rate this a 5 star movie.
Look I watched this movie in July 2015 and the reason for it is that my friends pestering me to watch this movie. So for those so called ""five star"" reviewers I just want to point out that im not watching this move to expect soft porn in it (a lot of 5 star reviewers mention that the reason a lot of people give a one star is because they expect porn in this movie). Here are some points that I dislike about this movie:
- it is too unrealistic, the story from the begining to the ends seems too bias. First you have this nice girl (selena) trying to savor the taste of freedom, then she hung out with the wrong friends, got in trouble, went to jail only for a day when sudenly james franco character freed them from jail without any means behind it, she got scared and conflicted : ended up going back home. Then her role ends. After that its just bunch of girls with 1 dude doing all sorts of stuff, 1 girl got scared and she also went home. Then whats left of em' barging out to a drug dealer house with no logic what so ever and ended up killing all the guards and the boss with the cost of james franco character.
- The acting was painful too watch, they were decent when they are playing the role of girls that trying to have fun (like its hard to pull off.. pfft). However when they tried to do criminal act and such it doesnt seems real. The way they hold the guns, their body language, its just.. not right.

There were still a lot of things I want to say but it would just be a waste of time. Seriously, do not watch this movie. If I have to rate it by my standard it would be 4/10
It actualy has  nice basic plot, but ruined by the story line.
Props to selena for pulling of the good girl act

5604094,3,B00BEJL4XS,"Halfway through I realized what kind of movie it was and it reminded me of the Sofia Coppola film ""The Bling Ring"". I thought it was super predictable though, but I have a weird habit of calling movie endings about 20 minutes into it and being right most of the time. I liked what it was trying to do, so I applaud the artistic direction and the message. Also it was refreshing to see some of these young stars (two of them Disney stars) take on a seriously challenging role and clearly branching out of the social norm.",1437264000,,520,4.316326530612245

Good movie to watch if you aren't in the mood for anything specific. Heads up though, they do curse a bunch and there are numerous drug references and sexual innuendo, so definitely don't watch it with a young child.

As a side note, I feel this movie is good less because of the plot (as the story line is vague at best) and more because of the way it was filmed.",1437264000,,497,4.02020202020202

5605014,1,B00BEJL4XS,"I had very low expectations leading up to watching this. Setting the bar that low usually allows me to enjoy a film for what it was intended to be, rather than looking for deep hidden meaning or Oscar worthy performances. However this is one of the top 3 worst films I have ever seen in my life.

If zero stars was an option, I would have used that rating instead of the minimum one star. I almost turned the movie off 2 or 3 times. I kept watching hoping for an epic ending like scarface. I won't post any spoilers here but what they did in the ending is just the worst stupid unbelievable trash I've ever seen in a movie of this genre.

James Franco's character Alien belongs in a comedy or satire film. The piano scene where he sang actually hurt my ears. The behavior of the girls was entirely unbelievable and contrived throughout the movie. I am especially ""impressed"" at their military sniper worthy shooting skills, and their ability to dodge bullets by sheer bikini power. Any eye candy in this film was overshadowed by the terrible plot, dialog, and the ""acting"" attempted.

The ending of this movie made me angry. It was their one chance to redeem this film, and they pulled a twist that made me feel the director was intentionally trying to insult the audience.

This film was pure trash.",1435276800,,1300,4.495762711864407

5605021,5,B00BEJL4XS,"This movie went way beyond my expectations and easily Harmony Korine's best work.  The scene with Britney Spear's song ""Everytime"" is masterful on so many levels.  It's this uber poppy song with these extremely dark undertones; a product of Britney's rise to fame and fall from grace.  The visual imagery Korine uses of the girls dancing with guns perpetuates the metaphor.  This movie is about holding a mirror up for all of us to see and looking our popular culture directly in the face.  Harmony Korine is building toward a cinematic technique that could be masterful.  Less narrative and more palpable on an emotional level; something that cinema in America is completely lacking.",1434931200,,684,5.008849557522124

5605103,5,B00BEJL4XS,"Disappointingly misunderstood, ""Spring Breakers"" is modern satire at its finest. A movie that most found dumb, trashy, and kind of disgusting. No one thought ""hey, maybe that's the point"" and just kept their one sided thoughts in their minds. Well let me say, that is most certainly the point. This film is supposed to be trashy and filthy, because the people it is talking about are that way. This is not a glorified view of teens drinking, smoking, and stealing, it is simply the truthful view of it. It is presented as teens see it, in a hazy, drug fueled binge on excess. It is scary to think that most people around college age view parties and drugs and things like that this way, but they do. Modern culture has taught them to. This film is simply the fictional, movie version.

The film itself, on a technical level is outstanding. Harmony Korine has crafted a hazy fever dream that is hard to come out of. Every shot, every line, every scene is a magical nightmare. The story of the girls can be described as a drug filled drop into darkness and evil.  Benot Debie's darkly beautiful cinematography captures every little bloom of neon, every line of coke being snorted, every over-saturated shot of beaches. Cliff Martinez and Skrillex's score provides an assaulting aural attack that combines with the images to produce a true experience. The performances are also great, with James Franco being the standout. His character Alien is the embodiment of bad influence. A man who behaves however he wants, who takes the innocent and makes them guilty. He is like the demon who drags the girls into hell. The casting of prior Disney actresses was an impeccable choice. Showing that many innocent people can be corrupted and lured into darkness like moths to a flame. Overall, ""Spring Breakers"" is a masterpiece of the modern age. A dreamy, neon filled, nightmare.",1434844800,,1868,4.798136645962733

Other than the glaring bs above I thought it was a better movie the second time through. Alien (James Franco) was an entertaining sociopath and the girls fit right in with him. I did think it was strange on how Faith left so early in the film, it's almost like they asked Selena to play the good girl role and it was only good enough for a third of the film. The rest of the cast was sexy and forgettable.. This is not because of their acting or them, it was because the director didn't feel it was prudent to provide any more information them other than they have the devil in them???

5606370,5,B00BEJL4XS,"Don't let the negative reviews fool you, this film is brilliant. It is a surreal, subversive romp through a morally ambiguous world of sex, drugs, and violence. It presents a caricature of young millennial entitlement, and the moral is clear: choices have consequences . . . sometimes. Don't bother watching if you're afraid to think, because you'll just end up leaving another irresponsible 1-2 star review because you failed to comprehend the subtext of the film, and it deserves better.

I'll admit it isn't perfect. There were cinematographic choices that I felt didn't quite work, though I can respect taking the risks. Namely, the time jumps and flashbacks that are meant to invoke the feeling of the drug-addled haze the characters spend most of the film in do make the pacing of the film uncomfortable at times. But whatever its flaws, this is a movie that ingeniously captures the darker side of this generation's zeitgeist.",1430611200,,933,5.019354838709678

""Spring Breakers"" takes us much closer to 'Scarface' than our lovely spring break girls ever planned ... but three of them go for it: St. Pete FL is paradise, and they will stay 'forever' no matter the personal cost.  James Franco (in one of his best roles) is both teacher and pimp, and watching him is the best part of this flick (even better than all the dumb topless party girls).

James Franco is almost unrecognizable as Alien, the gangster/rapper who springs the girls from jail after they get arrested for underage drinking and drugs, and he proceeds to lead them down a dark, dangerous path of destruction.

James Franco delivers a great performance as an uneducated drug dealer wannabe kingpin, but the rest of the cast are unremarkable in creating characters we feel anything about.

I wouldn't call this a deep movie, but it conveys what it's trying to say in a unique and interesting way. Don't take it too literally, it's not a typical over-sexualized teen movie (though I'm sure 13 year old boys everywhere will manage to love this movie without ever grasping any true meaning from it).

5607754,5,B00BEJL4XS,"I have become a huge admirer of James Franco, and still I avoided this film for the longest time.  There was a lot here that I just didn't feel I would find entertaining.  Something recently made me change my mind; maybe I wasn't being open-minded enough?  Well, the film opens with a lot of spring break.  A LOT!  The opening story is about 4 young college women who decide that they will do whatever it takes to be part of these festivities.  Mr. Franco doesn't appear for some time, and when he does, he presents a visual shock.  This is a role far outside of anything I've seen him do.  At first I wasn't even sure I was going to keep watching, but the main characters keep you watching, especially his.  Later, when I thought I would never feel sympathy for this character---he turns the table on me --- I develop an understanding of Alien under the hood, so to speak.  What he goes through reminds me of a lost boy looking for his place in the sun, albeit in the only way he knows how ---as a criminal.  Im not going to give away any details here except to say, if you really watch this film like I did and give it a chance, its going to stick with you.  On the surface, there seems to be nothing but wild behavior and extreme characters, but its like that scratch off lottery ticket, you don't know what you're holding until you rub a quarter on it.

Francos transformation for me was reminiscent of Aileen Wuornos as played by Charlize Theron.  Its a pretty fascinating transformation, at that.  Im sure he stepped waaay out of his comfort zone to do some of the things he did here.  I would have thought this to be a perfect example of an Oscar worthy performance, but then many were probably not able to look beyond the over-the-top window dressing.  What a shame.  He really deserved it.

This character of Francos makes me recall his hosting of the Oscars a few years back.  Here he was paid to play a role, where at the Oscars he was hired to host, and be himself.  Which he did.  I thought he was just fine.",1425427200,,2021,4.305039787798409

I have one big complaint though: The scenes containing and the dialog between Alien and his rival and former friend ""Big Arch"" are absolutely cheesy and poorly acted and scripted. I was finally starting to get into the movie up until this point but their exchange was so amateurish and it almost ruined the movie. They tried to create tension but it was not convincing in the slightest, the bad acting and dialogue completely ruined the two main parts where they talk to one another.",1423872000,,743,4.586466165413534

However, it wasn't totally poor in that the visuals were impressive. Miami is an amazing city. Although I've seen better shots of the area on CSI: Miami it was still decent filmmaking. It could have been a better crime drama if they did more with the characters then have them twitch around in bikinis for almost the entire second half of the film.

In my opinion, James Franco set the movie off! The film is definitely NOT predictable. Any audience will stay guessing. If you think you can handle ALL of the AK-47's and bikini's, give it a chance. And what man doesn't like that combination?? The ladies will be in to this one too, pulling for these lovable but fiesty female characters. That's the main reason why i'm trying to pimp this movie.

5608361,5,B00BEJL4XS,"This movie is not designed to be some dumb, funny sex comedy. It has messages. So when it's labeled as ""boring,"" it's because the viewer came into this expecting something entirely different, more run-of-the-mill.

""It's not about anything, it has no plot"" The movie is about something & it certainly has a plot, the viewer just didn't get it (probably because the viewer expected it to be a dumb, sex comedy)

If there are no characters to symbolize with or cheer for, it's because these characters don't want your sympathy. The average bubble gum chewer movie viewer doesn't understand that not every movie has to be/cares to be formulaic. So when stuff like this gets thrown their way, it hurts them.

If some of your favorite movies are Iron Man, The Avengers, Thor, & Captain America, this movie isn't for you. This is the antithesis of your a-typical ""dumbed down"" hollywood movie. This movie actually asks you to look way beyond the face value of the previews & cliche spring break imagery. If you're the type of viewer that can appreciate a movie with undertones, try this.

5608363,1,B00BEJL4XS,"I was looking for something a bit lighter and fun.  Not...this.  This is not fun.  This made me sad and upset after seeing it.
I hated all the characters in the movie: nobody was sympathetic, nobody to root for.  I kept wondering why I should care about any of them enough to watch the rest of the movie.  The girls start off as drug-addled, criminal, wild hoes who have no sense of morals or self-respect.  They are hard, nasty girls and you wonder why and how did they get to be that way.
One of the most disturbing things about the film is how it keeps repeating itself, skipping ahead to a scene, getting out of context, jumping back, repeating dialog until you realize that stuff has happened and what you hear and see is not quite what you hear and see.  Sometimes there are four girls, then three, then four again, then two, then three, then two again.
In the end, before they go home, the girls call their parents and tell them how they've changed and how they want to be good and how different things will be now, as if some profound change has taken place after all that's happened.  But it hasn't.  Despite the bad stuff the girls do with and for James Franco's character (with the annoying grille work and the dirty cornrows), they are no worse really than when the movie started.

5608706,5,B00BEJL4XS,"First off let's cut the crap, no one who watched this movie was looking for complex plot lines or oscar worthy drama. It's not that kind of movie, nor did it ever claim to be. But you would know that the moment you laid eyes on it's cover adorned with teens popping out of their bathing suits. My guess is most of the reviewers on here thought Girls Gone Wild and were intrigued by James Franco sporting cornrows so they gave it a go. But you wouldn't know that from reading their reviews. The reviews read like people expecting Schindler's List got tricked into watching robberies committed by coeds in g-strings. Puhleeze.

That doesn't mean this movie isn't entertaining. It's great! Several of the lines in this movie by Alien (James Franco) should be in contention to make anyone's Top 10 (movie quotes). James Franco is no stranger to taking risks on roles but Spring Breakers was a stretch even for him. Kudos to him for taking it on. Whether he based his character on either the rapper Riff Raff or Dangeruss, one thing is for sure, you will love Franco playing a white piano oceanside while he serenades two break bunnies with his rendition of Brittany Spears. Another scene featuring Franco pointing out his collection of guns and clothes is down right hilarious. Of course most of the movie is mindless action and the plot is questionable at times but it's enjoyable and I highly recommend it.

It is almost like they marketed this as the ultimate party movie on the beach, I thought it was a comedy from the posters and boy was I wrong. I almost wrote it off and did not watch and I am glad I stuck around.

Four college friends do not want to spend spring break in the dorms or back at home, they wanna live it up and after some booze and drugs they decide to rob a bank and then with the money they head to live the good life with the stolen money at spring break.  It is there that they meet Alien a rapper, playboy, enigma of a man who after springing them from jail decides to teach the girls all about life and living it to the edge.

This movie has everything you want beautiful people, fast cars, killer soundtrack, 4 women on the edge over their heads but caught up in the lifestyle they want to live, James Franco at his seediest and most out there role yet.  It is sad and striking and seductive. Please do not let the trailer make the case for you, as this is a really good movie about life and how far you can go before you can't turn around.",1417305600,,1273,4.179591836734694

5609290,3,B00BEJL4XS,"I'm on the fence about this film. On one hand, we have interesting and often beautiful cinematography where the colors are so saturated, everything is neon. Visually, this movie is top notch. On the other hand the story is weak and the dialog (or lack of) is almost laughably bad. So  any aspects of the story as left unexplained. We are lead to believe Faith is our protagonist, but then halfway through she decides to go home and we are left with three completely unlikeable characters that we know nothing about except that they robbed a chicken shack with a hammer and a toy gun to finance their spring break getaway.

There are a few things that do stand out in this movie that kept me from rating it lower. The first being that James Franco is almost unrecognizable as Alien, the wanna be rapper who seems to be running a semi-lucrative drug business. Alien is over the top and ridiculous. You just want to laugh at his gangsta affectations until you realize he really buys his own put-on persona. Franco steals every scene he's in, and seems to revel in every sleazy and uncomfortable moment to be had here. There are three stand out scenes where this is apparent: the creepiness of a scene with Faith (Helena Gomez) as he tries to seduce her and convince her not to go home; the screen where he makes his gleeful ""Look at all my s***!!!""  speech while jumping up and down on a bed covered in cash and firearms; and a scene where he serenades the three girls with a Brittany Spears song while they dance around brandishing shotguns and wearing pink ski masks. The latter is flat out ridiculous, yet comes across as oddly sweet. It's laughable, but at the same time memorable.

What is not memorable are the names of the other 3 girls. For the life of me, I can't recall if they ever mentioned their names. Ashley Benson and Vanessa Hudgens are given a lot to do, but little to say and absolutely no depth or character development. They want to rob, party, do drugs and play with guns. At no point does the movie ever delve into the ""why"" of it all. They have no back story, other than they've known Faith since kindergarten and they jus really, like, wanna do something for spring break. Alien had a great deal more back story than our protagonists which I found strange, considering Alien shows up at the halfway point. In fact, the only point at which either girl stood out was a really disturbing and excellent scene where the girls prove to Alien that they're capable of more than partying.

This film makes use of some alternate POV for certain scenes, which works for some scenes and doesn't for others. I particularly liked the chicken shack robbery scenes, told from the driver perspective, and then later, the girls inside. What doesn't work is the repetitive dialogue. While it worked in the beginning for Faith's phone calls to her grandmother, after a while, it got repetitive and unnecessary when the same 6 word conversation was repeated 5 times.  Ditto Alien's voice-overs chanting ""Spraaaang Braaaaak, Spraaaang Braaaaak, Fo-evah."" It worked the first time, but it got stale really fast.

And can we please talk about Alien's accent? As a resident of the Tampa Bay area for most of my life, I can honestly say that the natives don't speak with a southern accent, at least not one that heavy, and not even in the rougher parts of town. Alien sounds much more North Florida/Georgia to the native ears.  Just sayin'.

Overall, I have to say this movie had a lot of potential. Unfortunately, I think some of that potential and the potential for a great story got lost in film school gimmicks. I get the point and what the filmmaker was trying to convey here, but sadly it's hard to see through all the over - used devices, extended scenes of partying and debauchery (we get it, spring break is crazy) and repetitive dialogue. And while it's pretty to look at, I couldn't get past the feeling I was watching a really, really long movie trailer. In the end you get an idea what the film was about, but you're left wanting so much more.",1412121600,4,4052,4.570247933884297

5609376,3,B00BEJL4XS,"It's certainly artier than I expected.  Much of the film seemed to be told as hazy drug-infused memories, voiceovers that begin as dialogue, and repeat.  I enjoyed the minimal dialogue, since words are often wasted with ""you know, Bob"" explanations, and other stupidity.  The cinematography was disturbingly pretty, golden-hued, and psychedelic.  It's a touch of glossy Miami Vice with deep, popping color contrasts, and shallow drug lords.  Music was always a strong feature of Miami Vice, as it is here.  At times, Skrillex evoked a bit of Jan Hammer or Tangerine Dream.  It's fun to watch, and I don't regret watching.  The acting is convincing enough to get me to believe they are a bunch of crazy, super-entitled college girls.  James Franco is completely nuts and earned several well-deserved awards.  It makes one wish he would get back to acting instead of wasting his time spoofing himself.

Surprisingly, it passes the Bechdel test with flying colors.  The female characters with lines never talk about a man.  They talk about partying, other girls, getting to the Spring Break celebration they are worthy of, money, committing a crime, and feeling powerful.  For that, it's interesting.  Is it a feminist film - or does it toy with feminism?  Does modern feminism toy with women?  It seems that the more empowered we become, the sexier we have to be.  The more we achieve, the higher the hemline and the heel while we wear it.  And so, this spawned bikini killers for Spring Breakers.

Spring Breakers misses the Dostoyevskian mark of the great films like the French new wave film Pickpocket, which explores the idea of the lead character turning to crime as his entitlement.  In both Pickpocket and Crime and Punishment with George Hamilton, the main character commits crimes while explaining to police that superior people don't get caught and should be allowed to behave as they wish for the greater good.  Spring Breakers offers no greater good.  But spring break girls do talk about being superior and feeling powerful.  I'm just saying this could have been fleshed out more.  Either that or these things were implied by the girls celebrating their criminal acts, and penetrating Alien with a gun in his mouth on his 80s-style bed while saying, ""You think you own us?""

Franco's portrayal of a Riff Raff/DangeRuss type character serves as a catalyst and deus ex machina to get the girls out of the slammer.  I seriously doubt that the girls would have appeared bikini-clad in court.  Judges are outrageously harsh on the common people.  It's quite likely that they would have been booked and released to make an appearance at a later time - unless they do something else for spring breakers that I've never heard of happening in court.  Being booked means fingerprints and mug shots, as well as connecting them - via fingerprints - to the earlier crime they committed without wearing gloves.  This is the part that is least believable.  The deus ex Franco/Alien wasn't shown meeting them or hanging out with them prior to their court appearance.  But skipping that, it's believable that Faith would chicken out and the rest would go along with whatever, enraptured with the moment, descending to their nadir of evil.

If it's a moralistic film, it didn't come to a proper conclusion.  Though its unlikely that they got away clean if they drove off in the car of a man they just murdered.  If they were true to character, they ought to have gone back to Alien's and cleaned him out, along with cleaning out Gucci Mane's character's house.  Everyone's cash was ill-gotten and wouldn't have been missed.  But cars are registered.

If they are going to be portrayed as Dostoyevskian superior, they ought to plan better.  If this is a moralistic film, they ought to have been caught.  They do seem to regret it at varying points, but being arrested and finding out how they got the money only sent Faith into a tailspin.  The rest kept going with their crime spree.  And no, society need not be so worried.  Most of us never went on spring break trips to Ft. Lauderdale or Palm Springs - never mind holding people up to raise the money.  I found myself thinking that if they hadn't been doing drugs all along, and had been responsible girls who actually saved their money, they would have been able to afford a spring break trip.  But then again, that wouldn't be the story.",1409356800,,4385,4.809906291834003

5609619,4,B00BEJL4XS,"Lighten up!  This film isn't going to send nubile young girls into the arms of white gangsta wannabes.  Basically, it's an inverted MTV Spring Break with Harmony Korine pumping up the volume to make you squirm in your seats as his camera crew lavishes over our femmes fatales for an hour and a half in what has to be every parent's worst nightmare.

I give the guy credit for not holding back and finding a kind of poetic justice in this sordid story.  Franco is utterly mesmerizing as the self-styled gangsta-rapper who lures these girls into his messed up world.  Of course, he wants all four beauties after bailing them out of jail, but Faith (Selena Gomez) wisely takes the next bus home.  Not quite sure how she pulled this off with the local magistrate, but it doesn't really matter.  This is a fractured fairy tale and we aren't supposed to ask too many questions.

It's too bad Gomez didn't hang around but it was clear she didn't want anything to do with this crazy caper.  You almost feel the tears are genuine when she bids her three schoolmates adieu.  Alien gets over her soon enough.  Harmony Korine could have gotten really ugly with this story.  The remaining girls are in way over their heads, but he keeps the film in a fevered state, giving them chances to get out before it's too late.  It essentially allowed the Teen queens to vicariously play bad girls without having to go through rehab like Britney Spears, whose song ""Everytime"" is wonderfully invoked in this movie with the girls doing a hilarious impersonation of Pussy Riot.

You don't want your 12 year-old girl watching this movie but it wouldn't scar her for life if she did.  The movie is surprisingly tame given the situations.  No worse really than Miley Cyrus' ""performance art,"" only much more fun to watch.",1406332800,,1794,4.647619047619048

The movie is not linear in the standard story sense. If your familiar with Kroin's work you already know that.  Just watch ""trash humpers"".
Korin's brilliant and uses the film to convey feeling or sensory overload through sight and sound rather then through story line and dramatic acting.

The only reason I watched this is because Vanessa hudgens is in it, then I read the summary or whatever it is, and said james franco is a drug dealer that gets them into life of crime, from that alone it seemed like it would be a cool movie, maybe the girls sell drugs on the beach and at party's, rob a bank even maybe....what the hell was the point for them to rob some place with the girls heads covered and james franco head not covered for everyone to identify him, so stupid!

basically this entire movie was just one huge music video with very minor intermissions of dialogue of people talking but still not making any sense...

..
oh by the way, it looks like a bootlegmovie when you watch it because almost every single scene is so dark and has the smallest amount of light imaginable making some scenes even look fuzzy and def not clear at all...

the end is one of the girls calling her mom talking about her spring break being different and wild and remembered forever ect.. as if they never gonna do any of that kinda stuff again.....

yea im gonna pick one week every spring to go live with a drug dealer party non-stop shooting people robbing banks then go back to my everyday life and job ect... makes no sense at all...

the thing I really hate is that this could have been a good movie if it wasn't so dark and depressing, didn't have depressing music all the time, good lighting, plot summary conflict ect... good story of 3 girls coming to spring break, partying, then get into dealing drugs and making cash, buying cars and whatever,, could have been a real cool feel-good movie that every stoner around the world would be watching and it wouldn't be free to watch on amazon.....

that's how you know when a movie is bad, when amazon has it free to watch with amazon prime, cause even bad movies are like $1-$3 to rent even for just 1 day on this garbage!",1406073600,,1892,4.357954545454546

I was prepared to absolutely hate this movie with its Skrillex soundtrack, Harmony Korine directing (he made a movie I despise, Mr. Lonely), a cast of Disney alumnae and James Franco with a grill and a cornpone accent -- YET I LOVED IT.  Make no mistake, this is not a teen film in any way, this is an art film.  I think most teens I know actually hated it because it's so twisted. If you understand that and are prepared to watch an art film, then you are ready to watch this movie. I think the typical Vanessa Hudgens fan who grew up with her is going to be kind of shocked if you don't realize that she did this film to break out of her Disney mold (much like Miley) and show that she's not squeaky-clean. There is plenty for a film fan in this -- the robbery shot from outside in a moving car, the day-glo neon colors, the slo-mo of partiers bodies to the point of grotesquerie. There is a lot of displeasure here for satirizing exploitation of the female body via exploitation of the female body, but nonetheless -- this movie is pretty.

5609660,3,B00BEJL4XS,"Okay, so I admit that I only watched this movie because it had Selena Gomez, Ashley Benson, Vanessa Hudgins, and James Franco in it. The previews also made it seem like a mainstream action/comedy, so I thought to myself, well, it can't be too bad. Well, after 90 seconds or so, I began to think I had accidentally found the pornographic version instead. So, I kept watching, thinking to myself that the first five minutes couldn't possibly be foreshadowing the entire movie, but again, I was mistaken. About halfway through the movie, I began to notice that this film was nowhere near mainstream. it was more of an art film, which I have very little experience with. So after analyzing it with an artist/writers perspective, I began to understand the movie a lot more. It was nothing but parallels to the degradation of mainstream culture. The girls in the movie are seeking adventure, so instead of doing something productive, they fall into the ""real"", not TV glamorized, gang banging lifestyle. The irony is in the fact that, if you are familiar with most of their previous/earlier works, they are portrayed by the media as the most innocent girls in America - all three of them are ex-Disney stars (I'm including Ashley Benson in that because ABC family is owned by Disney.)
  So anyways, moral of the story is: if you go into the movie expecting to see four girls have an awesome spring break, chock full of drinking, boys, some mild drug usage, and itty bitty bikinis, you are gonna hate the movie. But, if you go into the movie with the perspective that it's more suited for an indie film festival full of amateur directors (yes I know the director is not an amateur, but I'm making a point) trying to make political statements, then you will at least be more prepared, and might understand the movie a little better.
  The fact that this is an indie movie, but they advertised it as a big motion picture with three of Hollywood's hottest young women is another parallel, by the way, of just how persuasive media is on our culture.",1405728000,,2038,4.652777777777778

It pokes fun at what society has become: a money, sex, violence-loving culture. There was one line in the movie that really stood out for me--when James Franco says that he has ""all this s***"" and has accomplished ""The American Dream."" It's a little sad because when he says these things, you can tell that he doesn't know any better than this--and truly does believe that he has reached his maximum potential in life because he has ""all this s***.""

The first thing about this movie for me is that it's made me laugh harder than I have from a film in a long, long time, and has continued to make me laugh over the half a dozen or more times I've seen it again. The definition of satire.
Next, the look of the film is beautiful. It has the same Cinematographer as Enter The Void, so what do you expect.
The editing is flawless, the liquid narrative is revolutionary in mainstream cinema. The sound design pulls you in and tells jokes and horrifies you, seamlessly. Definitely the best film any of the disney kids are going to be in.
Harmony Korine's last film was Trash Humpers, also a masterpiece. He made Trash Humpers, then immediately made a movie with James Franco and Selena Gomez and Gucci Mane in it. Genius.

5609782,1,B00BEJL4XS,"This film tries to titilate and shock by shoving nudity and meaningless, hedonistic behaviors into every nook and naked cranny available, so why was I nodding off?  Probably because there was nothing more to Spring Breakers than that, an attempt to titilate and shock.

The plot was minimal, and character development was lacking all together. Usually, through the course of a film, you come to care about at least ONE character, but I found it difficult to identify with any of these shallow, empty characatures. I ALMOST cared about Faith, the only distinguishable female principal as the others blend together into a singular, amoral, three headed, one dimensional bimbette who is more object than human.  There's just not enough there before Faith disappears from the storyline all together. Alien is interesting at first sight, but again, it never goes anywhere. He's laughably sad in all the wrong ways.

5609785,1,B00BEJL4XS,"(written by Karen Fahel): I am so glad that Prime had ""Spring Breakers"" for free.  I would have hated to have paid money to see this dreck.  There was more sex, nudity, drug use and horrendous language - for no reason other than just to have it - in the first 5 minutes than most movies have in their entire run.  While I am not a prude (I loved the movie ""Drive Angry""), so much of what was in ""Spring Breakers"" was in for no real reason other than shock factor: seeing former Disney girls Selena Gomez (""Wizards of Waverly Place"") and Vanessa Hudgens (""High School Musical"") in skimpy clothing performing simulated drug use.  James Franco was so over-the-top as Alien as to be laughable.  It seems like he was told, ""See how long your character can brag about himself, and put in as many ""M-F""s as you can fit."" Normally I can find some kind of redeemable message in almost any movie (once again, ""Drive Angry""), but this movie had none.  Bad writing, bad acting, no real plot...I would stay as far away from this movie as possible.",1402704000,,1034,4.444444444444445

However, the script was just fowl, full of street slang euphamisms, and with and no real structure.  It didn't allow the moviegoer to just become a part of the experience until the climax (no pun intended).  You actually didn't care for any of the characters with the exception of Selena Gomez and she was gone half way into the picture.  The characters had a nice core to expand upon but Harmony never took it beyond their excesses.  It almost had a ""Ten Little Indians"" feel as one by one each girl was leaving St. Pete until the non-sensical ending just made you question why this film was made in the first place.",1402531200,,779,4.642335766423358

This movie prompts you to think about the Spring Break fantasy in our culture--just what it means, what its connection to excess, or living beyond our ordinary life is, what living your fantasy means, etc.  If you don't like thinking about those sorts of things, this is not for you.  If you don't want a deep movie, but just one filled with boobs and blood (and this movie has plenty of both), this movie is not for you.  Its a movie you'll be prompted to reflect on.

That most people are in a bubble of their own design and stay isolated until it is popped/shattered is perhaps the Macro plot summary this film lacks as fair warning to viewers hoping for something else. I think the aspects of this film that people revolt against--the shallow characters, pointless violence,  and tautological plot are essential to the point Korine is trying to make. Overall, if you are interested in an articulate critique of consumer/escapist culture and going for a hedonistic dive into the nature of contemporary solipsism and the loneliness of the human condition, you will find more joy in this film than those looking for a party film, action film or skin flick.",1400889600,,893,5.074829931972789

5609853,3,B00BEJL4XS,"I went into this movie with an open mind. I read a few reviews prior to watching. It gave me a small idea of what the film entailed, but I still opted to watch it. This movie features the story of four girls who yearn to venture from their small-city town to Florida for spring break. The movie starts off with the girls lacking the funds to make the trip happen, so three of them (all but Selena Gomez's character) rob a small diner. This ends them up with the money, as well as a new awakening of their 'bad girl' side.

Selena Gomez, on the other hand, plays Faith, a girl who never truly finds her 'bad girl' half. Faith is a semi-reserved Christian who yearns to follow the Bible, yet experience more than the boring and stereotypical. She's caught between loving the idea of being free, and loving God. If you're hoping to find Selena naked in this film, then you've picked the wrong movie. Some people even seem to have rated this film based merely on the lack of nudity from Selena. I find that ridiculous- but hey, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. The movie also seems to target Selena as a main character, but she's not. Her big name is plastered all over the advertisements for this movie. But she's only present in about half of the scenes. I was really proud of Selena for taking this role. Would I want my teenage kids seeing this movie? No. But I feel like Selena, although experimenting with a more adult-oriented film, still held true to the 'good girl' image that I feel works well for her in Hollywood. I think she was cast appropriately for the part. Going into the movie I really thought Selena should not have been a part of it, but as the movie went on I'm happy she played Faith.

Rachel Korine, plays a pink-haired girl. I'd say she's more of a follower. She's not the leader of the pack, but she loves being involved in everything bad. The beginning scene in which the girls rob the diner, Rachel supplies the car and is the getaway driver. Throughout the movie she's the only girl you'll find breast shots of. She's the girl who maybe isn't so deeply in love with the violent side of 'being bad', but rather the male attention that coincides with it. I recognize Rachel's face, but I don't know from where. With that being said I feel she was cast appropriately. There were a few parts I questioned how 'true' she was to the character. I feel like she couldn't really portray her 100%. But I think she did okay.

And then there are Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Benson, the leaders of the pack. These two girls get the idea to rob the diner, are the actual robbers, and essentially become the sociopathic characters of the story. Vanessa didn't surprise me. I knew she definitely was old enough to play this part. I think it's a part she really yearned to play after being cast as a 'good girl' in High School Musical. She really wanted to break-away from that. And I think she tried a bit too hard in this film to show she was no longer 'a little girl'. Some of her acting I felt was being pushed a bit. Like it didn't flow. But by the end of the film she toned it down a bit and it came more naturally. At first I wasn't buying it- but by the last scene I'd accepted her in the role. Ashley on the other hand, did a pretty vivid job of portraying the bad girl right from the start. She's the hard-core druggie of the group. The true sociopath. I was honestly really surprised by her acting. She blew away my expectations.

So essentially the girls find themselves in Florida, get arrested for underage drinking, and then are bailed out of jail and meet up with a 'Gansta', played by James Franco. This guy was unbelievably stupid. I have no idea why James decided to pull off this uneducated douche, rather than sticking to more of an arrogant greedy gangster. He was like a half red-neck, half-gangster. It did not work at all. The film lets you in on the fact he was a white kid raised in a black neighborhood- but I don't see that inner-city black aura in him. I saw white in him- lots of white. And I know a few 'white' inner city sort of 'bad boys', and none compare to James' character. This guy came off as more of an idiot. Had he tried to mimic more of an Eminem attitude, I think it would have worked. I have no idea what he based his character off of. It was embarrassing to watch half the time. I just don't get why he acted so stupid and had this weird half-southern accent.

I won't spoil the rest of the movie, but as the film goes on you find out who the girls truly are. That's how I'll leave that,

Now onto the part of this film I hated. The reason it's rated R. There is a lot of cursing. This I found acceptable- as it honestly portrays the characters correctly. The characters definitely would use that kind of language in real life. And then we move along to the nudity. I've seen plenty of films involving full-nudity. Many European and indie productions. Nudity doesn't bother me at all- in fact I find it to really accentuate some films. But this film totally just exploited women. The filming was not done tastefully at all. There is a difference between nudity and pornography. This film was pornography. If you're looking for plenty of breast shots, then by all means- watch this movie. There is plenty of that. Shots that totally degrade the female body. None of the filming was done tastefully. It was pretty much 'Girls Gone Wild' with a storyline. The film could have been done so much better had it been filmed without the slow panning over females and focusing on weird angles that only pornographers would use in a film. There's also a lot of violence in the film. That didn't really bother me. Just the stupid camera-work did.

As for the storyline- it was... unfortunately real. I felt like some of the casting was a bit off, which didn't help with the storyline at all. But to be honest, it was a pretty legitimate portrayal of the modern American 15 to 25 age group. I'm 22 and female, and I really feel like it was right. Granted, MOST girls I know have matured beyond this 'bad girl' phase that's being portrayed in the film. But there are a few who will inevitably fall into this kind of behavior. Although this is more of an extreme case- it definitely shows the unfortunate truth of our generation's self-indulgent activities. It's all about money, fame, and sex appeal. This film brought those specific things to the surface. It's heartbreaking, tragic, and in a lot of ways true of what our generation has become. I don't like the honesty of it, but I appreciate the fact nothing was left hidden. Definitely unique. Not for everyone. Had the casting been more accurate and the filming done a bit more professionally, it would have been worth five stars. But because I really couldn't grasp the storyline with the actors that were chosen, and the film-work was overwhelming and distasteful- I can only give it 3 stars",1400630400,,6899,4.4275590551181105

5609856,4,B00BEJL4XS,"This film is much more than a skin flick, which is why the reviews are so bad: A lot of viewers just don't get it.

The film is supposed to be absurd, not realistic or literal; if you take the plot seriously, you're missing the point of the movie (look up Absurdism on Wikipedia, and I guarantee the film will make more sense). It's tough to discern which reviews to listen to, as I've seen some reviews placing this as one of the top movies of 2013, which I certainly don't think it is (maybe an honorable mention in a top 10 list). But a majority of these reviews are by people that:

a) wanted more nudity and were disappointed
b) misinterpreted the film
c) took the film seriously

I don't want to go into any themes or motifs deeply, just know that the characters are supposed to mock (in a comedic way) the stereotypical ""I'm going to find myself during spring break through drugs, alcohol, and sex"" teenager. The characters were very well thought out, although I'm not sure the execution was quite right (whether it was the acting or the directing is up to you to decide). Plot is what you'd expect given descriptions of every character's personality, but the end has an absurd twist.

If you decide to give this movie a chance, remember all of this. Just don't take it at face value. I think it's an above-average movie, but certainly not one of the best of 2013 and certainly not one of my favorites.",1400544000,,1409,4.428571428571429

Other thoughts:

- I felt like il was on a bad acid trip the entire movie.
- James Franco was the sole bright spot, but that's like saying you have one keychain flashlight during a total blackout.
- Apparently constant shootouts by your pool don't wake up the neighbors in this universe. Then again, it is based in Florida so it kinda makes sense.

5609879,3,B00BEJL4XS,"First things first three is generous and two this movie is certainly not a comedy, so if you selected this looking for an evening of endless laughs, I implore you to go back to the search menu. And again SPOILER ALERT!

Ok, now that everyone looking for a good comedy to watch for their date night is gone we can get down to business, but that also means their may no longer be anyone left to read this, as I certainly expected more of a ""Hangover"" feel from this film. Looking at James Franco with corn rolls and more metal in his mouth than Lil Wayne how could you not expect it to be funny. But if you come with those expectations, expect to be let down. While it does not have much to offer in the laugh department (unless you find Disney Stars Gone Wild funny) it does have its moments. The film is visually a work of art apart from the same repeated montages of spring break parties. The film never offers much depth into any of the charters, leaving us with a very two dimensional film with very two dimensional characters. This film really is a bad reflection of the indie film ""Havoc"" with Anne Hathaway. A film about a privileged white Beverly Hills white girl who seeks adventure in the streets of South Central LA (which is a great film to watch if thats what you were looking for here). James Franco, our resident Alien of the film, fails at coming off as a hardened product of the street, growing up with two crack head parents in an all black neighborhood of Miami; and succeeds at an excellent rendition of Jamie Kennedy, in ""Malibu's Most Wanted"" (rich white boy obsessed with being a gangster (which actually is a comedy and a good watch preferable to this.). His character, a wanna be scar face ""gangsta"" who seemingly has amassed a rather large drug racket seems very unbelievable and more like a con on naive spring breakers until Gucci affirms his hard knock upbringing. This however leaves you wondering where the film is heading, at least  now that we have all realized this is not the comedy we expected. Gucci merely had to be himself for this role which he did an excellent job at. It is when he stops being himself and tries to act that he fails miserably though.

 Our anti-protagonist of the film, a group of young college coeds, seem more like sociopathic brats with impulse problems than they do as depth-ful lost souls trapped in a world they cant escape. Seeing as they find robbing a store a reasonable idea merely to finance their trip to spring break in miami. And why? All because their safe college campus lives are to much to bare. The film continues to spiral in this fashion with a series of bad choices that leave them dropping off one by one as their new world becomes to much. Starting with our one foot in one foot out voice of reason and Bible thumper  Selina Gomez. We end with our two standing avenging angels who are now elevating from robbing to murder as they take out Gucci Mane who threatens and wounds their friend because Alien is cutting into his ability to ""feed his children""..... Right. Why they choose to continue with the hit after calling their mothers to say they are going to be better people and watching  Alien whom all the drama surrounds fall in battle before the battle even began, we don't know, maybe to solidify their bad ass no going back nature. Any way, they proceed to take out his entire crew only to steal his car and drive off into the sunset. WHY? Because l guess when your'e a white girl, former disney star, hottie and all you've done is rid the world of Gucci Mane and a bad white rapper and even worse gangster its ok to drive off in a stolen Farrai after murdering its owner. We will forget all the  other plot holes and the fact their is not a single cop around ever in this film except to raid a hotel party, despite the string of armed robberies they commit with 3 un masked white guys with metal teeth(soooo believable). But their is an important message in this film live life to the fullest but just reading that here may be preferable to watching this film for some.

There's not much to say, its aimed towards this generation I am guessing?  No direction, bad acting, unbelievable... The movie is just all around bad.  I literally sat there halfway through with my mouth open dumbfounded, and then turned it off finally.",1399075200,,268,5.068181818181818

5609914,5,B00BEJL4XS,"Low reviews may often reflect a movies failure to make a poignant connection with the audience however in rare cases an exceptional work may be poorly received simply because it transgresses expectations of those who measure according to the status quo.  I can certainly understand the disappointment of viewers with expectations based on the title and marketing of  ""Spring Breakers"" which suggests an entertaining escapist experience.  But should we really be disappointed when we expect superficial and receive something insightful and thought provoking?  This movie is a large package miraculously squeezed into a small box with a tawdry inauspicious appearance. Spring break fosters expectations of a superficial comedic adventure while the film's actual content uses this expectation so the viewers experience mirrors those of the characters who search for themselves in an escape of excess.  The entertainment value of this movie is not based on it's portrayal of spring break rather it's portrayal of spring break is used as a means to explore the humane psyche which is driven to such experiences.

The handful of original ideas have already been harvested and what remains are new ways to understand and relate these ideas to modernity.  Spring Break is a modern Bacchae  - the Greek comedy with a conspicuous absence of humor that suggested we provide ourselves with a ritualistic means of escape to provide a guise of freedom and ensure a return to our pre determined social roles.  In this sense the pursuit of a ritualistic right of passage and freedom actually functions as a type of prison.  Scenes from the Bacchae later appeared in the New Testament such as the apostles release from prison.  Did film makers create an intentional resemblance and contrast between the James Franco character, Dionysus when he released the spring break girls from jail?  While this may be debatable it is clear that this movie has roots in our history and attempts to understand the human condition.  While this content may be ancient the attempt to explore these ideas in modern terms is astoundingly original, courageous and entertaining on an introspective level.",1398902400,2,2166,5.207492795389049
5609915,1,B00BEJL4XS,One of the worst 2 hours (I'm not sure if it was 2 hours long but it felt like it) of my life. Basically the plot was horrible and I just couldn't wait to get out of the theater !,1398902400,,179,3.5

5609925,2,B00BEJL4XS,The acting is so bad it seems intentional. I just didn't get it. It was trying to say something but maybe not to me. I almost felt like the whole point of the movie was to trick people looking for a spring break movie into watching an art film. I have seen movies by this director and enjoyed them but for me he missed the mark with this one. The first half of the movie is really bad. The second half is slightly better. Everyone seems to either love this movie or think it is racist and promoting rape culture. I feel it does indeed suck but not due to racism or rape culture promotion.,1398816000,,588,4.121739130434783
5609926,5,B00BEJL4XS,"Its pitch dark and two of Aliens Spring Break Bitcheswalk along his rival gangs neon pink pier, shooting anyone who gets in their way. The dark, unfamiliar territory illuminates their skimpy neon yellow bikinis. Their pink ski masks with unicorns on the front conceal their faces so we cant identify who is who (does it matter?). They shoot men on balconies, men in pools, and finally Big Arch himself in his bathtub. While all of this is happening, we hear one of the girls talking on the phone with her mother: Yeah mom, it was really great. I think we found ourselves here. It was way more than just having a good time.. God, it was so nice to get a break from reality for a little while. Something so amazing, magical Feels as if the world is perfect. Spring break, forever. For Korine, spring break is a crime spree superimposed over a fake phone call home to your parents.

Sun-kissed skin, flat abs and big tits. A group of about three hundred people in their twenties drink copious amounts of alcohol and party on a beach. Boys pour beer down girls chests; their wet cleavage shines as the camera pans up their bodies. Boys grab their crotches and jump in the air while taking sips of their Budweiser cans. There aren't any overweight people at this party; its a party for hot bods only. Beer bongs and their funnels are in the air while alcohol is thrown everywhere, soaking everyone in sight. Boys mimic jacking off with their beer bottles until they come, shooting alcohol into girls mouths below them. Of course they swallow.

Swallowing, whether literally or metaphorically, is an important concept in Spring Breakers. As girls swallow beer poured into their mouths by boys, they're also swallowing their gender rolestheir places, as they know it, in the world. On the other side of this, Alien swallows his Spring Break Bitches disrespect, and he loves it. The girls swallow the boys objectification; they're sex symbols, prostitutes, pieces of ass But the girls do what they want while they continue to swallow. In Korines Spring Break, everybody swallows.

5609945,4,B00BEJL4XS,"I've read many of the reviews before watching this movie, and thought it was just.. another flop. But upon watching it, I was sucked in to the movie as a whole. Yes, the plot may be a little predictable, but the concepts and meanings that the movie is just trying to tell you is astounding. It shows you the struggles, more or less, of these girls overstepping their boundaries and how they are adapting and responding. The way some of the scenes kept repeating was almost as if to make it hypnotic, to give you that feeling of uneasiness as you watch you, in a way to show you the uneasiness and the blurr of the whole situation. I was impressed. However, if you just to watch the movie to look at the pretty pictures, it would be cliche and cheesy and just overpredictable. A good movie nonetheless. And definitely something you could only sit down and watch once",1398384000,,865,4.446540880503145

Only one character is sympathetic and she leaves the movie fairly early on to take the bus back home. (she doesn't return to the movie). The movie is violent and has what I consider racial undertones. The white drug dealer was raised in an all-black neighborhood (see what it did to him?)

Anyways, this is a story of some brainless girls that go on Spring Break after robbing a hamburger joint for money. They get in trouble with the law while on break and get bailed out by a guy (James Franco), braided hair, gold teeth, tats, etc. They start hanging out with him. In real life, would girls really be drawn to a miscreant like him? I hope not but maybe. They get drawn into his world of drugs, violence, etc.

I thought it sounded like an interesting and all around entertaining movie (I mean, who doesn't enjoy a movie every now and then about angsty teens who party, use lots of drugs and get reckless?). Let's just say I regretted wasting both my time and money on this film by the end. James Franco earned a few more notches on his cheesy meter with this role, to say the least.

The film started out enjoyable enough, the dynamic of the female actors was intriguing at first, but as the film went on the plot grew less and less interesting. I hated how the movie ended, the last scene was just ridiculous in the worst way. There is a scene near the end worth watching just for a good laugh because of its sheer ridiculousness (that word comes to mind a lot when trying to describe this movie). Franco's gangster (cheesy) rapper character and the girls sing a terrible rendition of the already horrid Britney Spears song while Franco plays a piano on the beach. That scene pretty much sums up the essence of this entire movie.",1397260800,,1123,4.504901960784314

I've seen many reviews of the movie where the reviewer missed that point entirely and took the movie at face value, and it can be easy to see why. This movie's message is wrapped in a thick layer of sex and meaningless parties that is more like a documentary than a movie with an easy to follow plot. The spectacular that this criticism hides in can be enough to disgust you in depravity and/or distract from the undertones.

It was an unrealistic portrayal of three friends going on a spring break. They decide from moment one to empower themselves through violent crime and coincidentally fund their trip. This marks the high point of the story and the downward spiral of the plot. They get busted while on spring break and sent to jail for a misdemeanor. While there, they meet a stereotypical antagonist who gets them out of the bind. If you close your eyes and imagine the next stupidest choice they could make, you've guessed the next plot ""twist"". The conclusion of the girls' spring break  was impossibly unfulfilling and was only shocking in that it was actually put into the final cut of the film.

The acting was passable even though the roles seemed more an attempt to break out of the actresses' childhood roles into anything else.

It begins as an over the top girls gone wild exploitation film but within the first twenty minutes the sense of doom is completely overwhelming.  You can't take the movie too literally.  Of course it's ridiculous.  Of course it's obscene.  Of course it's unbelievable.  That's the point.  Korine uses hyperbole to show greed, apathy and amoral character of a segment of society that is completely without empathy.  These girls illustrate a generation that has grown up disconnected from other humans by computers, television, video games etc.  The fact that these girls see no moral problem in robbing etc is sort of the point.

There is a fantastic scene when a Brittany Spears love ballad plays and the girls and Alien go on an obscene crime spree thats more like a gangsta rap cop killer video.  For me its a really great illustration of how these girls think.  In their minds they are living the Brittany Spears dream but in really life they are hurting people and putting themselves in grave danger.  I love that Korine makes the story a sort of satirical fairy tale almost.  Any other telling would be heavy handed.

The movie does have flaws but in all I found it to be very entertaining and honestly kind of thought provoking.  If you can go into the movie with no real expectations the way I did I think you may enjoy it.",1395532800,,1470,4.635658914728682

It goes overboard with some of the acting but It's a very watchable movie with an interesting look into how a spring break could go. I'm not quite sold on the overall plot but it's an enjoyable movie to watch. Moving from 2 to 4 stars.
-----------------------

Ugh, James Franco, spring break, and a spattering of popular pop stars. How can it go wrong? Clearly, after watching this, you're thinking where's the plot and that's where I'm at as well. For what I thought this movie would be, it's the slowest movie ever. I blame this on the editing of the movie but nevertheless, it's a very slow movie. Just awful.

It takes half of this movie to get to any sort of plot and leaves you with the rest of the half to realize the first half might have been okay. It doesn't get better and the first half is at least exhibitionist of boobs and butts to hide the lack of plot and story, the second half doesn't have that.

The only way this movie gets more than 1 star is that there is gracious nudity. To be honest, it's not worth the nudity to suffer through the plot.",1395360000,,1238,4.304721030042918

It's beautifully filmed - I read somewhere that the ""camera practically licks the girls' near-naked bodies like an aggressive tongue"" - and realistically acted.  It's a glimpse at a lifestyle unfamiliar to me that neither glamorizes nor exploits.  I have a strong aversion to beaches, bikinis, and barely-adult college kids binge-drinking and listening to dubstep, but the film made me see why kind of party was appealing to them.

It's not always a realistic movie, but it's entertaining, surprising, unsettling, SURREAL, and funny.  Watching these four girls go from singing Britney Spears to re-enacting their heist in the span of minutes was chilling.  James Franco is a funny villain while still being believable as a villain.

Clever awareness of the survival of the narcissistic world of the child and the absence of healthy mature mirroring of a mother's empathic concern depicts the culture of today in a state of violence dominated, hedonistic ""Lord of the Flies"" world.

Overuse of scrambled sequencing betrays the screen writer's own lack of restraint and detracts from the story and a brilliant performance by the lead actor.

The entertainment industry's appeal to the under neutralized aggressive and immature libidinal instinctual life of adolescents, bears some responsibility for unfair competition with reality based healthy parenting, diminishing influence over the culture.",1394323200,,886,5.314285714285714

I think the only reason I watched the entire movie was because I was hoping it would get better - it didn't and became even worse. I get the debauchery surrounding spring break but I was hoping there would be a story behind it all. Not so much. It felt like I was watching a music video - gee go figure, MTV was associated with this movie.

While not the deepest character actor, Franco's talents were wasted and frankly, for an actor with potential, it's a shame he associated himself with this wreck. This movie fit more in-line with Hudgens, Gomez, and the other two bit actresses - meaning no talent and shallow. The ending was beyond believable and just plain stupid.

With a critics eye, I don't see how. The characters were not likeable or redeemable. It was essentially a movie glorifying sociopathic/nihilistic behavior. If there's this much teen angst going on, I feel sorry for the next generation of teenagers...and I'll know to cross the street if I see a group of them coming.",1394064000,,487,4.7976190476190474

5610277,2,B00BEJL4XS,"Okay, yeah, the movie has some nice atmospheric elements.  I even thought the way they looped some of the dialogue was clever.  But it started to unravel as soon as the only character that the director bothered to develop took a bus home.  Later, in the most unbelievable ending ever committed to film, the two remaining suburban white chicks turn out to be super human killing machines and take out a kingpin (Gucci Mane), in his mansion, guarded by a gang of his men all while wearing neon yellow bikinis and hot pink ski masks.  Riiiiiiight.  I guess that's where the ""American dream"" part comes in.  After the slaughter they ride towards home in Gucci's Lamborghini.

Good luck w/that.

Selena Gomez a great singer with half decent music, caught up in all kinds of media drama, this I can see her playing a role in and her interview about the flick makes it all the more convincing why she would do the film. It was a horrible cliche-cascade of spring break madness.

Specifically, I feel it implied a lot of rape or sexual abuse - you get a palpable sense that, for instance, Alien was going to abuse the girls, and that the drunken boys surrounding the nearly blacked-out girls would respond to the girl's taunts of ""you're not gonna get THIS P****."" And yet the only explicit things the director chooses to take privileges with is showing us topless girls.

This is one of those films that attempt to imitate cinema veritea, or the cinema's take on reality TV (actually the form predates even television by a couple of decades but lets not get sidetracked.) Essentially the camera is handheld and moved in seemingly random, jerky movements to imitate how an amatuer might take home movies. The dialog is mumbled to burbled or overcut with background noise, with characters talking over each other. In this particular film things said are often repeated, and not just once but several times, as if the filmmaker is nudging you, making sure you heard that.

These characters are bored college kids looking for kicks, but we fail to care. We don't even care about the one girl we are stridently aimed at caring about by her Christian upbringing and fall from grace. There are just too many people in the world with real problems for these brats to get much of our empathy.

Short images offer vague foreshadowing throughout, but almost nothing is revealed. Spring Breakers is wonderfully edited in this way. Shots are repeated both before and after they take place.

The film has this constant dissonance between the material and the presentation.

5610469,1,B00BEJL4XS,"There wasn't anything I enjoyed about this movie. The plot sucked. The script was beyond awful, including the narrator repeating over and over the same sentences throughout the movie.
Also for some reason the producers of this movie thought it would be cool to randomly play gunshot and reloading gun sounds every minute throughout the entire movie.
Out of 20, I give this movie a 0.2; and that's being generous.",1391904000,,412,4.9

5610471,2,B00BEJL4XS,"The half-improvised dialog mostly falls flat. There's little character development and you never really learn what motivates any of these people to do what they do.

Scenes lack continuity from one to another and the film has only the slimmest suggestion of a plot. In the end, it's excessive enough that it simply becomes repetitive and dull.

It gains a star because of Korine's visual abilities and the odd compelling scene. But, all in all, this derivative mash-up of gang and bikini exploitation films isn't worth a rewatch.",1391904000,,529,5.0

5610476,1,B00BEJL4XS,"Weak. The story line was less than believable. This was definitely a low budget film, but that doesn't excuse the content. I've seen great films made on a cobbler's salary that would put this to shame.",1391904000,,201,4.611111111111111
5610477,1,B00BEJL4XS,"The cinematography was ok. The plot was derived. The slow motion, opening scene was less tasteful than a girls-gone-wild video. The acting sucked.

5610485,1,B00BEJL4XS,This is one of the worst films I have ever seen.  The script is terrible.  The film editing is pathetic.  The story-line and the editing yield an end product that is very difficult to follow.  The editing is over-stylized to the point that the editing itself becomes another distraction from the story.,1391731200,,302,4.75

5610487,4,B00BEJL4XS,"This is a bizarrely serious and well-made film. It has both an eye for aesthetic presentation and a (wisely) disjointed and untrustworthy narrative.

5610492,1,B00BEJL4XS,Half the time it's a voice over and they cuss for no reason and they sound like regards. Not at all what it was made out to be by the trailer. I wasted ten bucks buying this and now I'm never going to watch it again.,1391644800,,216,3.717391304347826

5610500,1,B00BEJL4XS,"I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.

5610505,2,B00BEJL4XS,After much fanfare in the media and on large blogs I decided to fire up my roku and watch Spring Breakers. What started out as a cliche teen movie morphed into a highly stylized (cue michael bay circa 1990s) ode to cruel intentions. There is no resolution of the plot lines of key characters and those that are followed are shallow and uninteresting.,1391558400,,350,4.571428571428571
5610506,2,B00BEJL4XS,"What can I say. This is a boring, takes you nowhere movie. I love love love James Franco but even with him in it, It still is not worth the money or the time. Just has no point to it Not even entertaining",1391558400,,204,3.7674418604651163
5610507,5,B00BEJL4XS,I had to know that the director was Harmony Korine before I was able to have a full love for this movie.  Its ridiculous but entertaining.  Not a movie for kids but definitely a good watch.,1391558400,,189,4.222222222222222
5610508,5,B00BEJL4XS,Wouldn't request for someone who just wants to watch a fun party scene movie since that's not exactly what the movie is about.  It's a great movie and I plan on watching it again.,1391558400,,179,4.264705882352941
5610509,2,B00BEJL4XS,"While James Franco gives an interesting performance, in general this is a surprisingly slow and monotonous movie. The movie focuses on some pretty, party-focused young women on spring break. There is then scene after scene after scene after scene of slow-motion, soundless ""woo-hoo"" spring break partying, followed by shallow chatter, with an ever-so-slowly developing plot.  The movie picks up at about the 3/4 point. but it's so plodding. As the USA Today review put it, ""it manages to be both mind-numbingly dull and off-putting.""",1391558400,,533,5.345238095238095
5610510,1,B00BEJL4XS,Um I don't know where to begin. I knew it was going to be mediocre at best. But I live where this movie takes place and it's embarrassing. I couldn't finish it. It kept saying spring break every 2 seconds. Do yourself a favor and find something else to watch,1391558400,,258,4.18
5610511,2,B00BEJL4XS,"I'd be surprised if this movie had a script.  If it did, it was probably ignored.  Scenes where people are dancing and going 'whooo' linger to kill time and fill out the 90 minute requirement.  Sporadic voice over is used to glue scenes together.  Teenagers-in-trouble movies are a staple of indie film, and Korine practically founded the genre with Kids, but this movie is more shallow than most, it's hard to even remember the girls' names by the end because they are being talked at, and talked over, more than they are talking with each other.  James Franco is as underwhelming as he always is, smiling a lot but bringing little imagination to the role.",1391472000,,657,4.678260869565217

Biggest mistake ever. This is THE WORST MOVIE. Seriously. Just don't even bother starting it, or you may, too, get trapped into watching it, thinking it's got to get better somewhere. And it doesn't.

Maybe it has an awesome ending but I'll never know because having the first 75 minutes be such a waste of time made me not want to invest any more of my life.

I am sure there is a website that will compile all the nudity in one place for those who are really looking for that. There are some pretty girls wearing bikinis or less throughout the movie but it isn't nearly as thrilling as you might expect.",1391472000,,540,4.294117647058823
5610517,3,B00BEJL4XS,"Lots of T and A, but what a weird movie. Couldn't help but laugh pretty much every time Franco was on screen. Confusing editing, jumps around a lot. Just all around weird. Was nothing like I expected, except for all the T and A.",1391472000,,228,4.204545454545454
5610518,2,B00BEJL4XS,Not what you expect. Story Line is horrible. A few topless shots is supposed to cover up a bad story line. A complete waste of time.,1391472000,,132,4.115384615384615
5610519,1,B00BEJL4XS,"Couldn't see the point or value of the film watching from start to finish. Just girls gone wild mostly. Though some good points are James Franco in a funky role & Selena Gomez still playing a good girl, though a bit wild, she was the least crazy of the group, and first one to leave to go back home. Then another leaves later after getting shot, with 2 remaining that stay until the end before leaving.

And it was disappointing to see Franco the thug get gunned down at the end so easily while the two remaining idiot girls with no real gun experience mow down all the thugs of Franco's rival along with the rival as well, and come out unscathed. WTF?! If I wanted to see a silly wacked movie in that sense, I'd rather see something that's more funny and sorta wanna believable like Machete Kills.

This film is like trying to be a blend of cinematic drama, documentary, and cheesy mild comedy, without actually blending it all very well.",1391472000,,939,4.421965317919075
5610520,2,B00BEJL4XS,"I did not begin watching this movie with great expectations. I began watching it because I wanted entertainment, but this was not entertaining. It was just bad. Don't get me wrong, some movies are so bad they are mind numbing, cheesetastic fun; this is not that kind of movie. The story line was not well planned, the acting was terrible (even for James Franco) and there are so many missed opportunities to make it better that it is just sad. I won't even talk about the end which I watched just to know if it got better... if only rewind could give me that time back. All the reviews on this film being about social satire - WRONG!

However the realistic morals on of this movie is; The diversity of college classes, the personnel struggles with good and evil inherent within all of mankind. The ""putting aside"" willingly of what one knows within ones soul the knowledge of right and wrong and comprehending the consequences of following the bad choices life has to offer. It's despondency within the four girls lives that ignites their decision to pursue what takes place within this movie. One of the main actors ""Alien"" ,aka Al, sports a tattoo on his neck with the dollar symbol ($), I had to wonder if the Producer had the same thought that I did ? Could that tattoo also be symbolic of ""Satan"" ? Since ""Alien"" plays the Tempter in these girls out of control lives. I won't go into detail of the movie as I watched it and you may wish to do so as well. It is a action packed movie. One of the girls' name is Faith. It's ""Faith"" that leaves the group first after her inner struggle with the wrong of her part in the over all action. I believe the message this sends is that faith, once abandoned allows evil to enter one's life.",1391212800,,1199,4.429864253393665

I've never been interested in Harmony Korine in the slightest, but he blew me away with this film.  The way he reversed gender roles and empowered these only barely post-adolescent girls in bikinis, in a gangster film no less - I still don't quite know how he did it, but he did and it's mesmerizing and brilliant.  The film is a hypnotic fantasia of sex and violence and absurdity, with a kicking soundtrack (two days later, I'm still addicted to the ""Scary Monsters"" track by Skrillex) and extraordinary performances.  James Franco reaches a completely new level here.

Where have we yet seen a smoking hot, teenaged girl in a bikini lying around with dangerous thugs, smoking pot and taunting them with, ""you ain't NEVER gonna get this pussy.  Never.""  Answer: nowhere.  This film is exhilarating with its daring and energy.  If you love film and aren't looking to see just the same ole thing repackaged and microwaved to lukewarm temp, then you have to see this film, it's as simple as that.

We don't know their names. They have no redeeming qualities. The movie tries to fill out their characters by inserting some kind of false conflict into their lives. They are conflicted about the meaning of life, so they express that confusion by killing people. Selena Gomez might be the only one with a conscious, but she leaves on a bus and never comes back. It's as if the writers didn't know how to develop that line, so they just let her move off screen, permanently. Just a silly, ridiculous, and awful movie.",1391126400,,693,4.596774193548387

With all the talent that James Franco has, he seems to have settled for mediocre roles about getting high (Pineapple Express, This is the End).

5610641,3,B00BEJL4XS,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

'Spring Breakers' can best be summed up as a mixed bag. On the positive side, this is a film with some excellent cinematography and editing as well as a surprisingly good performance by James Franco, as a tough as nails drug dealer.

The story, on the other hand, is problematic. We're introduced to four attractive female college students, who are bored to death attending school and believe that their salvation lies in going on a spring break to St. Petersburg, Florida, where all the action supposedly is. Only one of the girls, Faith (Selena Gomez), a member of a church group, appears to have any conscience at all. Some of her friends try to warn her about the other three, but probably due to peer pressure and probably because she's a bit of an airhead herself, she decides to join them on the spring break.

The only problem is that the girls don't have enough money to go to Florida. So Faith's friends put on masks and using squirt guns, rob a fast food outlet and obtain the necessary cash. For almost the next half hour, nothing much happens, as there are numerous shots of the girls partying with other out of control spring breakers.

The girls are finally arrested and lucky not to be hit with drug charges (as drugs were found in the house they were in). Nonetheless the judge tells them if they can't pay a fine for what appears to be disorderly conduct, they'll be jailed for two days. James Franco as 'Alien', bails the girls out and he introduces them to the scary drug scene he's part of. Franco is unrecognizable as Alien, sporting a set of silver metal braces on his teeth. Franco is quite convincing as Alien the drug dealer, with his menacing demeanor and thirst for violence. Faith is scared by Alien's lifestyle and decides to return back home.

The other three girls remain with Alien and like Charlie Manson's girls, decide to join him in his life of crime. Alien's rival is another scary drug dealer, 'Big Arch', who threatens to kill him on more than one occasion. The girls commit a number of robberies with Alien and then one of them, Cotty, is shot in the arm by one of Big Arch's girlfriends, in a drive-by shooting. Now demoralized, she too decides to leave the group.

The end of Spring Breakers proves to be completely ridiculous. Alien and the two remaining girls, decide to assassinate Big Arch at his island lair. Instead of trying to shoot Big Arch where he's accessible, we're asked to believe that Alien takes a speed boat out to his rival's island retreat and assisted by the girls, go up against Big Arch and an armed posse of at least six or seven bodyguards. Sure enough, Alien is gunned down as soon as he steps off the boat; but the girls, in slow motion, shoot the bodyguards and then gun down Big Arch, while he's inside, in his sauna (I wonder why Big Arch didn't hear the gunfire outside, before he's dispatched).

So the two bad girls go on their merry way, back to school, and the two drug dealers, meet a dismal end. The conceit that these two girls would so easily be able to kill all these dangerous criminals, is of course, absurd. Only the slick production values coupled with the Franco performance, saves the film, which notably has little character development (except for Franco's part). 'Spring Breakers' is worth seeing for the visual experience but don't expect much of a brain massage at all.",1390348800,3,3405,4.590460526315789

5610652,5,B00BEJL4XS,"On the surface, this film appears to be about a group of young women's obsession with hedonistic desires, particularly sex, drugs, and money, which primarily occurs during the annual ritual known as Spring Break. However, once you delve deeper into the film's meaning, you come to a much more significant realization. I will not taint potential viewers' opinions with my own interpretation, but this film is much, much more than what it seems.

Korine does an excellent job of providing visually stunning scenes, and the soundtrack to the entire film, which was scored by Skrillex, is perfectly complemented to each scene, at times instilling the viewer with feelings of youthful exuberance, while also maintaining a sense of foreboding and ominousness. Ultimately, this film is surprisingly relevant, and in many ways, displays the same artistic tone of Drive.

Give it a chance. You may enjoy it more than you think.",1390348800,,918,5.154362416107382

5610657,2,B00BEJL4XS,I loved all the other movies he created or was at least involved with. I think it's the editing on this one. It's mainstream and dilutes all the embarrassing emotional connection of his other films. It could probably be another great if the editing connected with me (the viewer).

5610658,5,B00BEJL4XS,The biggest problem with this film is actually what the viewers expect when they go to see this.

5610664,5,B00BEJL4XS,Spring Breakers is totally not what I expected. The film is incredibly oddly shot. Much of the film is told through voiceover and monologues thrown over scenes. James Franco is hilarious as a Riff Raff style rapper that meets up with the girls and saves them from a short stint in jail. I don't really want to say much more than that. You should probably watch Spring Breakers. You should totally watch Spring Breakers.,1390262400,,419,4.675675675675675

5610668,5,B00BEJL4XS,"I liked that the movie didn't try to apologize for anything. It was exactly what it was, a movie about a white rapper raised on the street that doesn't have any remorse and only cares about one thing, money.  Don't forget about the four college girls that doesn't want to miss out on spring break, so they find a way to get the money to go to spring break and they live ""the life"" while they are down there.  What really made the movie for me was the way that it ended, Spoiler alert, I am glad that they didn't die at the end, ""the girls that is"", and that they got away with all they did at spring break.  Most people won't like this movie, but for me it was a nice get away something I found my self laughing at James Franco many times...

Then of course I read some on here that said it was a good movie it was more to it, etc. Yes there is more to this movie...never allow your child to go on spring break! There are horrible people in this world who prey on young college students. That is basicly all this movie is about that and drugs. What was Selena thinking and the poor girl that plays Hannah in PLL. Then you have James Franco in it as well. This movie was the biggest joke for a movie.

5610672,2,B00BEJL4XS,"The movie itself lacks much in the way of plot and substance. It feels like an art house film, which is great. But the subject matter belie its obvious intent which is to show as much T & A as possible. I expected that, and indeed, that was part of the reason why I rented it. But without a decent storyline and point, I felt like I was watching pornography instead of a legitimate film.

Sure, you can laud the 'art noir' aspect in an effort to find something positive, and you can congratulate the director for discordant, in-your-face cinematography, and call all of this dark, satirical commentary on spring break, but this movie is still pointless and wandering, and every single character is shallow and unsympathetic.

The description, previews, and even the movie poster makes the movie sound and look ridiculous but its actually quite dark. There are a couple of cheesy moments, but overall this film is a satire that takes you inside the minds of four young women and the very dark, demented side of a select few.

(Good thing it was free for Prime members!)  I don't know what the director was after with this.  It seemed like he wanted it to be both an art house style film (the low dialogue, the moody music, the montages super-imposed with the dark, brooding college girls) and a bankable mainstream flick (the colors, the music, the sex, drug and rock-n-roll type partying; Yes, we get it- kids get raunchy and naked when on Spring Break.  Now can we have a different scene here?!)  If he was trying to make a point, I think it got lost in there.  I wanted him to make something out of this, but there was just nothing.  It was also paced incredibly slow.  I kept waiting for something exciting to happen but the next scene was just another shot of the girls drinking from a beer bong and calling their grandma to lie about what a wholesome time they were having.  I also felt zero for any of these characters.  Did the director want me to feel sorry for these girls?  Did he want me to think they were cool?  Did he want me to think that they were at all justified to go start a life of crime because they were just so bored at school and just had to get away?  Give me a break!  Bottom line, if you are really hard up and can't afford some soft core porn, then go ahead and watch this movie.

5610826,2,B00BEJL4XS,"Despite the talented visual look the script lacks true character depth. James Franco is very convincing as Alien, but you get the sense that he was let loose to create his own character when the script didn't provide much of one. There are too many slow-mo scenes... far too many to re-establish the cliche images we've seen for decades on MTV. Plot moves far too slowly and character development is even slower. It always feels as though a better script could have told this same sarcastic look at bimbos with too much time and not enough morals in a deeper way and truly meant something to the audience. The only thing the film really accomplishes is being just as surface and hollow as the characters within. Harmony's past films have always had skewed perspectives and light plot, but the characters were interesting enough to let him get away with it. If Gummo or Julian Donkeyboy had this many slow-mo shots within it the same complaints would have risen. It's too bad the director/writer couldn't have lassoed this one in as there were a lot of mishandled good stuff.

Three reasons to watch it:
1. Visuals. I don't mean girls-in-bikinis (though that doesn't hurt). Sumptuous and exaggerated use of color, lighting, shot composition, filters. Eye candy.
2. Editing. Clever, non-linear. This doesn't just ""tell you the story"" but uses extensive jump cuts, foreshadowing, slow-mo. Fast moving, throwing away the action and suspense where other movies chose to focus alighting on dialogue and establishing mood where violence-and-sex-obsessed others skip.
3. Story. This is not a movie where you can watch the first 15 mins and guess what happens in the end. Charaterization may be thin, but all experience journey and epiphany. Hudgens takes a 12-gauge to her HSM image.

I was pleasantly surprised with the nature of the film and how, while full of wild spring break party scenes, also depicted the real dangers of spring break in an extreme kind of way. Theft, drugs, sex, guns, deception, you name it...this movie got it all.

""Spring Breakers is a movie that pushes artistic boundaries requiring the viewer to come face to face with the type of society our youth lives in.  This satirical masterpiece requires the audience to really think about party culture and gender roles.  A thought provoking performance by James Franco paired with strong female lead characters will leave you floored!""

SB'ers is the type of movie that is trying to make you feel bad for ""not getting it"".  There's an obvious focus on empowering the female lead characters throughout the movie but the result is more insulting to women than anything else.  I say insulting not because of the ""sexualizing"" of these characters but more because they make the female lead roles so typically one dimensional (for example, Selena Gomez is the God fearing girl who realizes she made a mistake).  If the movie is really about these girls life journey then why is it that James Franco's supporting character is far more fleshed out even though he doesn't really appear to about half way through the movie?  It's obvious from the start as to where the movie is going so any plot twists are unsurprising and fall flat.  Spring Breakers purposely tries to enrage and gross out the audience.  And in that point it succeeds (hence 2 stars instead of 1)... I just feel that it takes itself far too seriously as an artistic satire.

And it'll make you miss the days when you were partying hard too. And if you are into indie flicks, well half this movie is actually flashback montages of other points in the movie. Seriously, if you were to take out all repetitious scenes, it would run well under an hour. It's a rebellious critical movie of teen excess that just begs to be hated... and for that, I can't hate it. It's perfect for a get together to watch a bad movie.

If you think this movie is ""Harmony Korine's best film"" then there is no hope for the future of cinema. Be more critical! I deeply loved Korine's body of work up until Mr. Lonely - he has unfortunately lost his craft, likely because of his recent history of substance abuse, and is now looking to make money to support his young family.

5610995,3,B00BEJL4XS,"Reading some of these other reviews it often amazes me how little people know about a film before they go into it. Now I don't research every film before I see it, but before I go blasting a movie in a review I do check into it. Since very few people have even mentioned the rapper James Franco character is loosely based on, I'll start there.

RiFF RAFF, (yes his name really is RiFF RAFF) is the rapper that inspired Franco's character. Being familiar with this rapper before the movie I wasn't thrown off by his antics & persona. Franco's interpretation alone is enough to watch the film. Now if you have no idea about RiFF RAFF than I am sure you struggled with the concept of Alien in the movie. Glad I got that out of the way.

When I first saw Harmony Korine's Kids I was in high school. To this day, it still ranks up there as a movie who had such a scarring ending that stays with you forever. What Spring Breakers does well is accurately depict the level some college students today reach when it comes to partying. Kids introduced the world to a lifestyle some NYC teens grew up in. But to me thats where Korine will always excel and this was definitely the case here.

In short, this film struggled at times especially with story development. It wasn't as cohesive as it could have been for a director as talented as Korine. If you're a fan of his work, curious about how twenty-somethings party, or like RiFF RAFF check this movie out. But by no means is it the worse movie ever made.

This is where the guy fantasizes exploits women and says ""You know you wanted it"" Truly traumatic for young adult  who has been exploited with fabrications that they wanted it.  Continues the male myth of exploitation of women.

Contains drug scenes and is probably a want to be fantasy for some creepy male that does not value women as anything more than animals for their pleasure.  Seems like the person who wrote this had a warped mind.  Uses the sex and drugs genre.  Maybe if you are a drug addict and take ecstasy and participate in orgies would you find this plausible. I could not watch the whole thing as I was disgusted.  Borders on porn.  I do not recommend it unless you want to see breasts and women on women or other wild things.

Some of the more positive reviews have praised SPRING BREAKERS for its brilliant and misunderstood nuances of plot, complex interrelationships between characters, and so on. Like many others, however, I just see this film as a sleazy tale of a couple of psychopathic college girls who, while on Spring Break, chance to fall in with an obnoxious--and murderous--gangster, immediately becoming his groupie-cohorts. Despite their lack of experience as felons, they prove remarkably adept at armed robbery and automatic weapon-fights with hardened criminals. Really cheesy and unbelievable, one of those films that can't quite make up its mind how seriously it wants to be taken.

As one or two others state, however, this film DOES do some interesting things with lighting, semi-animation, choreography, and that sort of thing, which helped keep my attention and is probably the only reason I made it all the way through SPRING BREAKERS. Even though they both play characters who don't contribute much to the storyline, Selena Gomez and Rachel Korine also give nice performances.

Ah, well. There's definitely an audience for this sort of thing. Even if it's the stuff of fantasy, there's plenty of heart-pounding violence with a fair measure of sex and nudity thrown in.",1388620800,,1281,5.269607843137255

I finally gave it 3 because of the amount of ""scenery"", and because I appreciate a movie that takes some chances and goes places I haven't seen a movie go before.  That being said, the style of this movie, and the camera work are really annoying, and the ending is laughable, stupid, and too unbelievable.  It scares me that the makers of this movie think that we will buy and believe that two girls who, as far as the movie has shown us, have no experience shooting guns, can go into an unknown mansion full of seasoned gangsters, with one gun and one clip per girl, and wipe out everyone, not run out of bullets, and not even get wounded.  Riiiight!  I'm wondering if all the repeated scenes and lines are for an audience that is too busy texting, facebooking, and tweeting, during the movie, that the director wanted to make sure they actually got to see the whole movie.  Personally it annoyed me to the point of wanting to smack the director, editor, producer, or someone upside the head for releasing the movie that way.

There's little to no character development, plot, or even acting, just a lot of slow-mo montages of coeds partying on the beach or red-lit places. There's probably less than 20 minutes total of dialogue. It's like a long Skrillex music video (seriously half the soundtrack is Skrillex singles) except I'd rather watch a Skrillex music video. I guess Franco just wanted to be K-Fed and simulate sex with some young girls and Harmony wanted to shoot some boobs. This is a satire in the way Blurred Lines is a satire: it isn't. Party movies usually have no soul but this took it to a whole new level with banal, semi-existential bits of dialogue and cheap 'trippy' editing for cocaine sequences.

However, i give props to second the half of the movie which kept me entertain with its flashy grils, bed soaked money, topped with guns on top,  Oh I got excited.  One scene stands out of all when the two girls arouse James Franco where they sexually put the guns in his mouth as if their going to kill him, which only excites him more. mmmmmmmm damn girl that'd turn me on two.

No one becomes a monster just to go on Spring Break and then do the unthinkable.  I gave the movie two stars because I think t's unique.  With that said, it's not a good film.  It's not a deep film.

5611112,1,B00BEJL4XS,".... but found absolutely nothing redeeming or credit-worthy.  I could only give it one star, because that's as low as we can go, but if zero (or -1, or better yet -5) were possible, that's what I would give it.  Read the previous reviews for a more-or-less accurate synopsis.  I didn't catch any satire, social or otherwise; nor would I call it pornographic.  Porn is usually titillating, at least on some level or another.  There is nothing titillating about a bunch of young women bouncing around topless pouring cheep wine on themselves, nor a bunch of young men engaging in such utterly pointless and self-destructive behavior as guzzling down cheap beer & vodka, smoking bad pot and snorting coke from a girl's bare-breasted chest.

Four young women are bored in college (while no-doubt racking up thousands in student-loan debt just to be there).  Oh please, cry me a river!  So they engage in an armed-robbery (yes, it's still considered armed-robbery, even if the weapons used are only toys) to procure the funds to go on their desired spring break along with the rest of their college friends and dorm mates.  They get away scot-free, no consequence for their actions.

Upon arrival, it's just more of the same bad behavior, with virtually no consequence for their choices, save for a few days in a county jail.  And they get bailed out by a local gangster, a lone-wolf of sorts, and become part of his pathetic little gang.  Ultimately two of the four leave, while the remaining two go on to commit more egregious acts.  The film ends with the gangster dead, and the last two returning home, ostensibly to their normal college life.  Oh PLEASE!

While the film may slightly exaggerate spring break behavior in Florida, certainly in real life young college students make some stupid choices.  But unlike in this film, in the real world, there are consequences for the stupid choices we make as youth.  And in the real world, we're held accountable, we learn from our mistakes, we accept the consequences, and we progress and mature.  Not so in this film. I kept watching, hoping that the characters might actually learn something along the way.  But that didn't happen. There was no growth; no maturity.  These kids learned absolutely nothing!  And I missed any component of satire.

A suggestion to any poor lost soul who is bored with college life and wants to see more of the world, who wants to find deeper meaning to life: Don't go to Florida on spring break to find it.  Try Haiti.  Or somewhere in Central America, say Honduras or Nicaragua.  Or Baghdad.  Or Kabul, or Kandahar.",1388188800,,2595,4.775280898876405

Very little character development for all of the cast.  I liked the shots of the Sunshine Sky Way Bridge but that's about it.  Unrealistic ending with all the shooting; as if police are nonexistent in St. Pete.  Was this a comedy?  I thought the 727 tattoo was funny.  I heard an NPR brief on James Franco's character in this a few months back and it prompted me to watch this movie.  The commentary on NPR was very misleading.

The only revelation here is that college kids do some really stupid things on spring break.  The writing is poor, the plot meanders, and overall the film feels like a drug induced cinematic experience with an over exposure of images and repetition of dialogue. As I'm writing this I can still hear Franco's voice going, ""Spring break, spring break forever"" echoing through my mind.  In fact the only thing that recommends this film at all is Franco's acting which caused me to watch the film for an additional 20 minutes, other than that there is nothing here.

People don't understand that these things actually happen and are currently still happening. The reason things kept being repeated during this movie is because people (especially young people) are prone to be controlled and they get an idea stuck in their head and they just keep fixating on that idea and they will do whatever necessary to accomplish that goal. They repeat it almost as if a mantra in order to reassure themselves they are doing right. The film style, acting, directing, producing and local of the movie were excellent. This film gives anybody willing to listen all the fuel and ammo they need to understand what's going on in our nation. This message that I am about to say is in the movie but not the main focus. White and black, and black and white should make no difference anymore. This nation is more segregated now than it ever was before. People blame things on blacks and people blame things on whites. Why cant there just be idiot's that things get blamed on? The answer is because black people are so focused on what happened in this country with slavery and civil rights and all that they cant see they have an option to be people NOT BLACK. White people are so busy trying to make sure everybody is all politically correct and don't focus on what needs to be focused on that nobody can see past anybodies skin color at this point. It's not black people committing crimes and it's not white people committing crimes. ITS CRIMINALS. Now there may be a larger number of BLACK CRIMINALS, but that is simply because they think they are protecting each other when in fact they are making it worse by continuing to blame white people as they are represented as the MAN in most black peoples eyes. Black people believe white people are trying to hold them down when in fact black people are holding themselves down. What I mean by that, is black people think white people or anybody that isn't black is the enemy! When in fact our own government is the enemy. Our very own government is the one propagating this dissolution to make it seem like black people are all dangerous and should never be trusted. It is power hungry government officials and big corporations that hold us down. There are specific things going on in the country right now to hold black people down. The government hates poor people. Black people think that they cant make any money with the white mans system so they hustle and sell drugs or whatever illegal means necessary to get by. If people worked as hard at honest work as they did at illegal activities and hustling they would make enough to support their families and make enough to make a change in the world. People need to just be people. Nobody needs to be black and nobody needs to be white. WE ALL JUST NEED TO BE GOOD HUMANS. We were not put here to see skin color.",1388016000,4,2969,4.5307262569832405

No one felt it necessary to tell them what they were doing was wrong...only character with some level of morality cried until they ""let"" her go home.  I felt like Franco was riffing most of the time in his role, and took his character wardrobe a bit too far into the freaky as Alien.  Not a movie I would recommend and don't let young people watch it.  A lot of people when they hear it has Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Benson in it might think it's okay to be viewed by people under age 17.  I'd recommend this be viewed with parental supervision because the lack of repercussions to the behavior might confuse younger people who are already having a difficult time in this society in determining right from wrong.",1388016000,,1019,4.540983606557377

The movie is also filled with video sequences that are obviously designed as filler material.  The direction is terrible also with choppy sequences and sequences flipping backwards and forwards in time.  By the end of the movie, the phrase ""Spring Break Forever"" made me nauseous.  Perhaps, it would have been better if I did a shot each time I heard someone say repeat that phrase.

Also, it is another movie where someone gets shot in the arm and apparently only a small flesh wound is made.  Hollywood does a real disservice to society each time they do not portray the serious damage made by a bullet hole.

5611218,4,B00BEJL4XS,"Spring Breakers is one of those movies that seems like it's going to be one kind of thing but is actually an entirely different kind of thing. In this case, it seems - from the ads, the artwork and to those unfamiliar with the work of its director - like some kind of, well, spring break romp, of which we have seen millions of previous examples. What it actually is is an art film that employs (some of) the tropes of the teen sex romp/crime film to create a biting, darkly comic, nihilistically violent satire on pop-consumerist amour propre.

Naturally, anyone hoping for the first kind of film - or for a straightforward cautionary tale about being young, dumb and full of cum - is going to come away confused, bored or pissed off. But for those who have long watched Harmony Korine's career with curiousity and interest, and hoped that he would eventually find the right medium for the expression of his cynical, twisted outr pop sensibility, this is that film. It's a brilliant achievement.",1387584000,,996,4.659090909090909

5611220,5,B00BEJL4XS,"People misunderstand this film as glorifying the actions these girls portray, or argue the little character development. Spring Breakers does neither of these, admittedly, but it truly is a mirror of the society we live in today. Marked by the Neo-Spring Break advertised relentlessly by MTV in the 1990's and 2000's, Spring Breakers serves as a warning about the kids raised by the DJs and the programs that forced hyper sexualization, violence, and poor judgement down our throats.

Born in 1991, and being 22 years of age today, Spring Breakers is a shocking reminder of the kids I grew up with and really helps reinforce the fact that life spent this way may be entertaining in the short run, but after a long time of living like this, there is an emotional bubble. This film does not deserve its 2.5 star ratings. The music is beautiful and so ironic in its usage, because it exemplifies the gangster-obsessed, self-entitled culture. The cinematography like Drive, but dirtier and far less glamorous. The production design an excellent homage to the early 1990's in its neon skimpiness. The acting is left desired from Harmony's wife, but the other three excel in expressing what kids born in the 1990's and late 1980's are truly like.

It is NOT Project X. It's Spring Breakers and it's usage of non-linearity, lack of strong storyline and character development is completely Korine in every sense of the word. His work is not meant to appeal to every single person and if it did, it was done in the completely wrong intention. My favorite movie of 2013.",1387584000,5,1560,4.8389513108614235

Nothing in this movie is remotely accurately except some of the bulk footage and that is heavily exaggerated.

It made me feel sorry for those poor college kids being exploited, oh well, they'll learn their lesson. And I found it odd that only one of the other actresses did a real topless scene. Ok, the other 2 we saw their backside, and Vanessa Hudgens' sort of blurred out body in the swimming pool. I guess they thought that if they snorted cocaine and smoked weed in the movie, they'd finally get rid of their good girl image.

There is some violence and uncomfortable moments, and while many films make those moments add to the story, Springbreakers just let all the opportunities to propel the story fall flat.

5611276,3,B00BEJL4XS,"This was a very interesting choice for Amazon to make as the first major film it made available to its members.  Although the main characters are all college-aged teen girls, it's clear that the market for this film is men.  The entire film pushes the boundary between softcore erotica and actual cinema, with most of the film being shots of college or beach parties with cocaine being snorted off of boobs or babes chugging brews.

Overall, the storyline was interesting enough to keep me watching but the actual plot was poorly developed.  As mentioned, the only character that actually developed was Faith, and she left halfway through the film.  Two of the three girls that were left we know almost nothing about until the end, and even then we know very little.

People will probably watch this film and say that it promotes teen violence, drugs, alcohol, etc., I'm not sure exactly what this film promotes.  As a college-aged male who has seen his share of parties, I will say that the depictions of the parties are somewhat realistic (although very exaggerated just like anything in a film).  But is this the point?  Was the point of this to create a film about partying going wrong?

The gang violence undertones attempted to turn the film into a Scarface-esque rivalry but did so unsuccessfully once again because of insufficient character development.  I find it difficult to believe that this script was written with anything but the intent of creating a forum in which it would be acceptable to film naked and near-naked women for an extended period of time.

Overall, the film isn't horrible - I have seen way worse films that were, again, filmed as an excuse to get naked women on the screen (""Zombies vs. Strippers"" comes to mind).  However, considering the sort-of kind-of maybe all-star cast, was it wrong of me to expect more from this film?  Perhaps, but I'll never know.",1387238400,,1890,4.79320987654321

I didn't even mind my daughter seeing her shows and listening to her music as I liked watching Selena too. But like most young stars, the older they get, the more they fall into the sex and sin sells.

This movie starts out with young kids doing drugs and from then on, everything from drugs to sex to swearing to theft. Smut is the one word I would use for this movie. But not surprisingly, it is consistent of the Selena who stayed on our islands to film the movie. While here, she turned her nose up at all our resorts and hotels. Like a spoiled brat, they finally could please her by renting an upscale house in one of the nearby neighborhoods. I wasn't impressed when Justin came to visit her either.

Once a fan of both Selena and Justin, both have fallen into the world of trash. I hope that there are role models that our children can follow. This movie just sums up everything that makes today's society bad. The worse movie ever!!",1387238400,,1036,4.335051546391752

Ostensibly a story of four girls from a small, unexciting school who rob and steal to go on college spring break and get more than they bargained for, what you actually get is far more exceptional.

The title and poster suggest bikinis, wild teenage debauchery, and laughs. You get all of those things, though perhaps in a manner and choosing that is also more than you bargained for.

Then a beach appears out of the blackness. One built as much by MTV as nature: a paradise of endless youth and unlimited pleasure, overflowing with sunburned bodies, booze, drugs, and depravity. All in the slow motion of fantasy and half-remembered memory.

But the vision slips away as suddenly as it began, vanishing as dreams abruptly do upon awakening, punctuated by black and the sharp, echoing sound of a cocked handgun.

What follows is not just the compelling story of these girls and their ""vacation"", but a kind of modern fable: a visual and visceral exploration of the desire simmering below the surface of an outwardly orderly and conventional society.

You can almost feel the darkness and danger of it. Even beneath the Florida mid-day sun it's the ever-present and un-billed co-star: a presence that is alternatively subtle and suffocating. But it's this very darkness that intrigues us the most - the suspicion that beneath the distractions and amusements this desire is forever unquenchable, and that truth is as thrilling as it is terrifying.

Some might say this is a story about escape, but in the end it's ultimately about death - or more specifically, about mortality. About the paradoxical allure of risk and danger, and the promise of a party without an end.

See it for that, or see it for the boobs. See it for James Franco's performance of a lifetime, for the unlikely actresses, or for the striking music and visuals. See it because it's only an hour and a half or because you are curious. But see it. You will not regret it.

These girls find that the paradise they were looking for was not what it appeared to be. But there is a twist in the story and two of the girls actually do seem to like what they have found. There are some metaphors for growing up and developing into adults thrown into the mix as well.

It is an uneven but brilliant commentary on what happens when the current culture of no limits goes to it's extreme.  For those over 25, it is so disconnected that it is ridiculous.  For those under 21, I bet that some of the themes of this movie hit home.  75% of teen boys with smartphones have some sort of porn app on it.... 50% of girls have one too.  This is the generation of Special Ops, endless war in the middle east, and generations before them who have spent their future before they have one.  I am 46, and I don't talk to this generation every day.  I listen to them every day (big difference).  This is a movie for this decade and beyond...and not for those of us who went to high school when Reagan or Clinton was president.

It's genius even if Alien is just a carbon-copy of the real-life Riff Raff, just not as good.

5611435,1,B00BEJL4XS,"I initially wanted to watch this film for the few actors Selina Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, and James Franco. I was a little excited for a film based on spring bring thinking it would fall more along the lines of a comedy.

I'd give this film a 1.5 star if possible, but its not worth the two star upgrade. I actually didn't expect this film to be so dark. I usually really enjoy dark films, but this one threw me so off guard that it wasn't even funny during the funny parts.

I will start off by saying the cinematography is beautiful in my opinion, especially the night scenes. But like most ""film-school students"" this film lacks heavily in the plot department. Okay so Harmony Korine is 40-something, but film-school students are supposed to make such heavy plot errors not ""professionals"". And I am not sure, is Korine a pornography director, because thats what I think I just watched? (Sarcasm). I thought it was very amateurish to have the characters repeat dialogue so many times throughout the film. Don't waste dialogue is what I have always been taught. Make everything count. This film didn't do that, it wasted so many minutes with unnecessary dialogue repetition. There was countless unnecessary spring break footage. Sure throw in a few spring break scenes that mean something to the movie, but not scenes that have nothing to do with the film.

I did think the acting was good. But there is not much I can say about that.

In the end this is a bad film, that probably should have been reworked before being distributed. It is amazing how this script got the green light. Now this had potentially to be a good movie, but fell very short with a lack of attention to details by the director. I am seriously placing all the blame on Korine for this one.",1386633600,,1762,4.584126984126984

5611451,1,B00BEJL4XS,"This movie is really not good.

The first problem is there are no actual characters in the movie. Just stereotypes. Selena Gomez plays the stereotypical christian good girl (named ""Faith"" of course, because everything has to be obvious in this movie). Three other actresses play the three other leads, all raunchy college girls. They are all pretty much interchangeable blonde party girls. Then there's Franco playing the white trash wannabe hiphop gansta.

Much of the story is told through tedious voiceover on montage scenes, with soliloquies that sound like they were written by 14 year-old creative writing students. Of course, none of it sheds any light on the characters. It's pretty boring and you keep waiting for something interesting to happen.

Hopes are raised when Franco's trashy Alien joins the story, but then quickly things spiral down into the tedium and banality once more. Finally, in the third act, things go off the rails, but none of it resonates or seems important because we're left with the least-formed characters of the movie and you don't really give a f*** at that point.

If you're a Prime subscriber you can watch it for free. The movie looks nice in spots forward along to those parts. If you can't watch it for free, I don't recommend wasting time on it.",1386460800,,1289,4.89908256880734

James Franco was ridiculous in this movie and I am shocked Selena Gomez accepted the part.

Not the nudity, not the gun violence, not the lifestyles and choices portrayed, not the rehashed phone conversations or any other scene.

James Franco is in it for a reason. It is a controversial, pushing-the-envelope material, that seems to appeal to him, and I can appreciate it.

There are some recognizable settings and St. Pete Beach is mentioned, but this movie certainly does nothing that the Chamber of Commerce would be proud of.

PLOT: Basically four idiotic young college girls are dying to go on ""Spring Break.""  One is a supposed ""good girl"" who is kind of religious and three vapid friends.  The three friends commit a robbery to get enough money to go.  Then the four think their lives are ""perfect"" when they are able to spend all day and all night surrounded by other young people only wearing beachwear -- lots of bouncing backsides and breasts and an occasional topless shot.  When the girls get arrested at a wild party which includes tons of alcohol and drugs, the four girls are bailed out by a rapper/drug dealer who just happened to be sitting in court.  I won't go any further in the stupid plot in case you want to waste time on this, but there is a fair amount of violence and language.

There is nothing good about this film other than a little bit of TnA.  No good moral lessons.  No interesting plot twists.  No likeable characters.  No common sense.  No realistic behavior. Some characters commit horrible crimes and simply walk away with no consequences.  It is a pointless, stupid film unless you want to spend time watching a bunch of partially dressed young people bouncing up and down for about 1/4 of the film, some ""R"" rated language and some gunfire.

This is a really great representation of 'nobody tells me what to do!' There is mocking story of Peter Pan and some really great cinematography.  I especially thought James Franco played the part of a Riff Raff archetype quite well.  Unfortunately it also seems that this movie was marketed and interpreted as some sort of comedy/teen film.  It has elements of both of these, however, it is not by any means a conformist Hollywood film.  It is certainly worth seeing.  It may make you uncomfortable at times, but stick with it.  I give this a high rating because it is worth seeing and well acted.  For those who saw Korine's other films, it is better than Mister Lonely and still not as good as Gummo.

Do not watch this movie if you think it is going to be some sort of Seth Rogen rom/com teen summer movie, you will not like it.  But if you feel like watching a movie about girls gone wild with no laugh track, then this is for you.

5611584,4,B00BEJL4XS,"While it's extremely easy to see this film as it portrays to be (an MTV music video on steroids), I believe that Spring Breakers achieves something much more than putting up 90 minutes of nudity, violence, and typical college/teen spirit on the big screen.

Spring Breakers shows us a journey of four college girls, bored out of their minds and yearning for something ""more"" in life, turn (or rather, become exposed) into (as) gun wielding thugs very much like the figure that gives them the key out of the mediocre they have been desperately trying to escape. This entire transformation begins with these girl's preconceived notions of ""Spring Break"" as being this heaven-like, euphoric, eternal paradise. Multiple times throughout the movie, Spring Break is either portrayed with smiles, partying, laughter, and reckless, irresponsible freedom or spoken of as a place that is so perfect that the girls admit to wanting to never leave (pausing time and just staying there forever). Eventually, the girls finally lash out and perform illegal acts in order to obtain their entry into ""Spring Break"". (Note: Perhaps this was the proper entrance into ""Spring Break"", to prove their mettle as the law breaking and dehumanizing inhabitants of Spring Break).

Fortunately for these girls, Spring Break does turn out to be all that they have hoped for and more. Their stomachs, addictions, and lusts are completely overwhelmed by the mass beautiful and titillating chaos that this film accurately captures. Although this section of the film is drawn out, the point is clear that not only these girls but rather a representation of America's youth seeks this kind of paradise (admit it, days and days of partying seems pretty good, especially in freaking November). The teen version of the American Dream or The Pursuit of Happiness is clearly depicted in this section of the film as a culture of overindulgence and self gratification (look at this scene and just absorb that...). It's satirical, humorous, and frightening all at the same time.

Obviously all good things must come to an end (so much eternal paradise), these girls find themselves in prison. Thankfully it's here that this film takes an interesting turn and introduces Alien, an embodiment of all that Spring Break is. Alien, at the very core, is the figure that these college girls want to become. I love the scene when Alien is listing all the things that he possesses. Guns, colorful shorts, cologne, and DVDs on replay are his weapons of charm and credibility to convince these girls that his life is THE life. While it seemed funny that this is Alien's pride and joy, yet again the film is poking fun at the very thing that is driving the American youth into this Spring Break culture: money and lots of stuff.

This film accurately takes this SB (spring break) culture and pushes it to the extreme by revealing Alien's true occupation as a thug and drug/lord/crime boss of the city. (Note: Alien seems to be not only a participant of SB by taking part in its booze and women, but also it's engine by facilitating crazy parties, manufacturing drugs, and attracting young girls to become Alien's lackeys). Alien's thug world becomes too much for two of the girls and sends them off home (Note: It's interesting how ""home"" is either back in school for some of the girls, while ""home"" can also be SB... It's also interesting how the girls who decide to leave are never heard of again, as if they've died and passed into a different side of eternity into the previous world of mediocrity and dorm rooms). The film naturally ends in the complete transformation of two girls, nearly identical to their superior, clearly achieving what they've desired most ever since the beginning of this movie, and it's not just a Spring Break. These girls were looking for dominance, freedom, power, dominion, and god-like sovereignty of their own life choices and circumstances (note: the scene where these girls are calling their parents and giving them a taste of their side of eternity and offering them advice on what ""life"" is and how life should be lived, they feel like they're grown ups).

In conclusion, Spring Breakers really is just 90 minutes of bikinis and machine guns. But it also is a sort of coming of age film that accurately depicts the creation, maturation, and finally fruition of the American Dream/Pursuit of Happiness at the very core of today's American youth. This film was very entertaining and obviously thought provoking.",1385424000,,4495,4.940476190476191

5611589,1,B00BEJL4XS,"Really a bad movie. The story is ridiculous and flat out silly. James Franco actually does a good job with the garbage role he is given. I guess this was a stylistic attempt at something... I just don't know what. Not enough T &A to make sitting through this thing worth it. Selena is terrible.

The film has no direction. Is it a rap/gangster movie... sort of. Is it a T & A National Lampoons sort of deal... kind of. Is it a girl empowering friendship movie where they happen to wear bikinis the whole time... I guess so. I don't know how this thing got 66% on Rotten Tomatoes. The film stylistically is somewhat interesting. I guess the fancy reviewers wanted to give it credit for that.

This is really unwatchable. If you want the Girls Gone Wild aspect, just watch porn. If you want a gangster/rap crime movie, there a lot of those you can watch. I mean I watched this as part of my Prime membership and didn't pay for it specifically, but I still feel ripped off. If someone tells you this is good then they are: a) some kind of film school wanna be who thinks the style is amazing, b) someone who gets off on the T&A aspect, or c) a fool. Again Selena, while very attractive, is just awful.

As for other reviews discussing how deep it is or how advanced the film making is .... pure nonsense.  These are pseudo-intellectual wanna be film makers who love telling people ""oh you just didn't get it or see the nuance.""  Do not believe it.  The fact that it got 66% on Rotten Tomatoes from critics but only 40% from viewers is indicative of this.

If there is any redeeming merit to the movie, it is that wannabes never win. Movies should evoke some kind of emotion. Some kind of feeling for the characters. This movie was cold and lifeless. Watching it was like watching a glass on the dinning room table.

I avoided paying for it and I am glad I did. I waited til it was free on AMAZON PRIME!  Amazon Prime is SO worth the paltry $79 Annual Fee. I have seen a lot of GREAT movies for free, and I have seen a lot of TRASH, like this one, for free. As much as I hate I wasted the time, at least I didn't pay $3.99 to rent it or $14.99 to BUY IT!!

The cinematography (if you can call it that) is apparently based on an unending series of grainy, poor color, and out of focus shots to create ""realism""...which actually creates apathy and irritation onthe part of the viewer.

From my ""viewing"" of the ""film"":
It starts with a too-long scene of spring breakers (well, not real spring breakers, but the hollywood kind where everyone is fit and has big fake boobs) partying on the beach.  Lots of TnA here, but the accompanying sound track is awful and seems contrived to try to create some sort fo ""shock and awe"" feeling...it does not.
It introduces the main characters separately in their out of focus poorly colored grainy pathetic lives.  This is done to try to make us care about them...it does not.
Then they go on spring break, rob something or someone, meet up with a sleazy drug dealer, do a lot of other sleazy drugged up stuff, and then the movie ends with a shootout and a monologue.
God awful.

5611604,5,B00BEJL4XS,"I was really, really surprised by this film. The preview does not really do it justice, as this is NOT a film about a white gangsta and a crew of Girls Gone Wild armed robbers. Yes, there is a white gangster, and there are sexy girls in bikinis robbing and shooting. But the film is not actually about those facts. The film is a study in CONTRAST (both visual and thematic), and in challenging your expectations. The filmmaker is really, really good at changing gears once you think you understand the characters' motivations, or where the plot is going. At first, Franco's ""Alien"" character seems like a con-man hustler, and you feel an almost paternal fear for the girls as he sucks them into his world, but this perspective does not last long, and soon you are starting to wonder if the girls are really just using him as he grows more emotionally attached to them. They turn the tables on his apparent supremacy in a scene involving his gun collection and his bedroom, and the sexual dynamic of the group shifts radically.

On that topic, there is surprisingly little sex in the film. The scenes of spring break debauchery leave the actual act to the imagination for the most part, and by the time sex actually occurs in the Franco-Girls gang, it is far more emotional than you have been expecting. The scene where Franco's ""Alien"" serenades the ladies with a Brittany Spears song SHOULD have been a point of ridicule, but as it was happening, all I could think was that this is EXACTLY how a character like Alien would express his genuine emotions.

The film is shockingly beautiful, visually. The moments of color contrast are perfect. At one point, Alien, in an electric green jacket stand opposite his ethnically black arch rival, decked out in vibrant red, and their color profiles (white+green vs jet-black+red) seem as opposite as their position on each other. The entire movie is a study in contrast. Innocent Faith (Selena Gomez) standing in a crowd of pool playing gangsters, ski masked girls in bikinis, the sub-tropical beauty of Tampa against its urban ghetto. Bad-looking Alien expressing (probably) real emotions compared to the girls with their secret motivations.

The film moves in a curve, with some elements repeating at the beginning and the end, and it has a dash of the Kirosawa 'Rashamon' technique of alternative perspectives (but never heavy handed). The entire film moves like its a 90-minute preview of a movie itself, and I don't recall being bored for a single minute.

As I said, this movie really, REALLY surprised me. I found it to be quite intelligent and artistic, and the film maker played with my emotions and expectations in a really interesting way.

5611621,5,B00BEJL4XS,"I wouldn't recommend reading this unless you've seen the film.

The bright sun glistens off the bright blue water as the warm sand squishes  between your toes. Laughter and joyful screams fill the air. The beer funnel is  full again and you're up next. ""Woooo!"" echoes throughout the beach. Smiles  surround you and everyone is inviting. This is Spring break. This is the dream.  Though just as all dreams do it is sure to come to an abrupt end. Bright lights  and neon swim wear can only last so long before the harsh world comes bounding  upon you. How far would you go to make it last? What would you be willing to do  in order to have spring break forever? These are just a few of the questions  Harmony Korine posits in his newest effort Spring Breakers. A study on the youth  culture today and how amoral and corrupt just having fun can become.

Korine's nonlinear editing is a thing of genius here and really drives the film  on. The constant foreshadowing and hints of the future assure that the tension  never lets up and the view is never able to be at ease. Something isn't right  here. Even through all the partying and seeming happiness something darker lies  just beneath the surface. It will not be all laughter and smiles. Something will  go very wrong. This feeling is met with truth as the film unfolds. Korine uses  erratic dubstep music and quick cuts to illustrate the ever decomposing attention  span of today's youth, then slowly eases the film into a more lingering and  abstract statement on the moral decay of society at large.

Selena Gomez and Rachel Korine do well with what they have to work with. Vanessa  Hudgens, Ashley Benson and James Franco however knock their parts out of the  park. In particular Hudgens and Franco.

Hudgens' Candy is so disconnected from reality that when a friend who she's known  since kindergarten is fearful for their lives and wants to go back home her first  instinct is to roll her eyes. Her constant finger gun shooting is very telling.  She wants to ""have fun"" and do whatever she wants no matter the cost. Life to her  is a video game. A movie. Drugs, alcohol, mindless robbing, unlimited money and  no consequences. Sound familiar? Almost like a description for the newest Grand  Theft Auto video game. This is her perception. This is how she makes the world  around her. This is her reality. A girl making out with another girl and dancing  raunchy is considered edgy and when she sees this happening at a party her  reaction is to gyrate around and scream in joy. Something that many girls would  do as well, but this is only a small glimpse into her psyche. It's not the act  that excites her it is the fact that it is edgy and considered by some to be  wrong. Money excites her because of the power it brings with it. She, several  times, becomes aroused in the presence of money. Of all the girls she is the one  who seems to be the first and most accepting of Alien and his lifestyle. After Cotty has been shot and tells Brit and Candy that spring break is over Candy  again seems to not care. Just as Faith wanting to go home this only interrupts  Candy's fun. She just wants this annoyance to be over. Get back to the fun stuff.  Get back to being bad.

""I always wanted to be bad."" A statement made by Franco's Alien that completely  defines his character. Guns, drugs, money and power are his American Dream.  Alien's idea of having fun is robbing spring breakers and blowing tons of money  at strip clubs. He is gangster rap fully realized and defined. As he tells the  girls he is a hustler and a rapper. It is quite important that he lists them in  that order. It's as if being a rapper comes with the territory of being a hustler  and plays second fiddle to it. The idea that all gangsters and hustlers are also  rappers means he has to be one as well. Music is not his first love nor why he  does this. He just wants to be bad and rappers are ""bad"" so he must do it.  Scarface is the ultimate bad guy so it plays on repeat in his house. He surrounds  himself with what he sees as bad. The necessities of being a bad guy. Just as  when he is explaining his back story he says it's the same old sob story. It  doesn't matter. All that matters is being the baddest guy he can be. There  doesn't have to be a reason why other than he simply wants to be. This is his ultimate downfall.

Spring Breakers is worth seeing for Franco's performance alone. Hudgens  performance, Harmony Korine's brilliant direction and hyper sensual style are  just the icing on the cake. After seeing this for the second time it only got  better. I expect the third time will only reveal more about this masterwork.

5611622,5,B00BEJL4XS,"Yes, I said it.  This film is an artistic masterpiece.  Forget all other films you have seen before, forget their cliches and story lines.

Harmony Korine is a genius for creating Alien.  Alien made me a James Franco fan for life. Werner Herzog says, ""Three hundred years from now, when people want to look back at this time, they won't go to the Obama inauguration speech, they will go to Spring Breakers.""

5611623,4,B00BEJL4XS,"If you go into ""Spring Breakers"" expecting a dumbed-down, flesh-jiggling sex romp, you may be sorely disappointed. What you'll get instead is a sobering cautionary tale about four sexy coeds who get more than they bargained for when they head down to St. Petes for a week of fun-and-games in the Florida sun.

The allegorically named Faith (Selena Gomez) is a good Christian girl who yearns for a chance to break free of the confines of her tedious college life and thinks spring break the way to do it. The problem is that she and her three girlfriends don't have enough money to make the trip. So they opt to steal a car and hold up a diner, then use their ill-gotten gains to get them to where they want to go. After a few days getting stoned and plastered, the girls find themselves in jail with no one to bail them out. Enter ""Alien"" (James Franco), an uber-creepy street hustler with a mouth full of silver teeth who posts the money they need on the condition they spend some time with him. What is he up to, and can a venture that started on such a violent note end on anything but?

The thing ""Spring Breakers"" has most going for it is its total lack of predictability, for just as you think you know where it's headed, it turns right around and goes off in a different direction entirely. The girls remain strangely underdeveloped and undifferentiated throughout (except for Selena), but, in a way, that's perfectly in keeping with the theme of female objectification that permeates the work.

Writer/director Harmony Korine has conceived the work almost as a tone-poem, with long lyrical stretches punctuated periodically by the sound of a cocking rifle. That symbol for the ever-looming threat of violence serves as the refrain for the story the movie is telling. Some of the scenes are astonishingly realistic, while others have an almost hallucinatory quality to them. This makes it so that we don't really question the plausibility of some of the plot choices Korine makes. It's all in the service of the thesis that there's a yearning ""to be bad"" lurking deep inside each and every one of us. All it needs is that one special circumstance to set it free.

""Spring Breakers"" is one of those odd films that keeps hammering us with titillating visuals, while at the same time warning us against the dangers of partaking in what it's showing us.

It may make you depressed about the youth of today and make you despair over the future of the nation, but, love it or hate it, as a movie, ""Spring Breakers"" is definitely a one-of-a-kind experience.",1383177600,,2557,4.660753880266076

5611626,5,B00BEJL4XS,"Having seen other Harmony Korine movies like Kids and Gummo I knew this wouldn't be a typical T&A spring break movie which it wasn't. I love this movie because it shows the dark side of an American Tradition as compared to MTV's one sided coverage of it for several years. I watched it 2x with no commentary then put on the commentary and it helped me appreciate this movie alot more. I have to give props to Vanessa Hudgens Candy and Ashley Benson Brit for really going for it in a pool scene, and also to Rachel Korine Cotty for the party scene. Faith (Selena Gomez's character) is pretty much a good girl throughout this movie but she does some of the best acting I have ever seen her do (only ref is Wizards of Waverly Place) especially in her scene with Franco in the back of the pool hall..  As for James Franco he was amazing, I wouldn't have known that Alien was James Franco if his name weren't billed as a star of the movie. James Franco kicked arse with his portrayl of this character, his one liners and speeches and nursery rhymes he made up. A If you know about Harmony Korine and like his stuff you must see.

If you were a young adult in T-Town or around there, early 2000 on up this movie might be a great representation of the feeling and attitude of your younger days.

To those ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say thank you for saving me the ~$30 movie tickets. (I live in NYC, so our theather prices are inflated.)

This is the type of movie that you would rent from your neighbor or Netflix when there's nothing else to watch or you want to feel like you're high but can't afford to call the dealer.

The movie started off kinda okay.. it showed the backgrounds of the characters, their desire to escape the monotoany of a small town, and party it up in Spring Break. The rest of the movie was essentially a mashup of drugs, liquor, violence, co-ed boobs, and gun cocking noises. Lots and lots of gun cocking noises.

Towards the end of the movie, you'll feel like you just did a decent amount of drugs and will probably feel as high as Gucci Mane looked throughout the movie.

5611652,5,B00BEJL4XS,I remember years ago when MTV was actually showing music videos their annual remote from Florida Spring Break.  Despite the sunny faade they tried to paint of this annual college midterm event it always struck me that there was a dark underbelly of hedonism and excess.  Director Harmony Korine uses this annual bacchanalian event as a cautionary vehicle to say that good kids grow up to be good adults if they make the right choices in their formative years.  Bad kids are just plain bad not because they made the wrong choices but made the ones that serve their self interest.  I never thought that a movie with so many perfectly toned young physiques in their most naked form could make me depressed but I think that is the intention of the filmmaker.  Judging from the negative reaction of some of the other reviews I can sense that this is most definitely not the sunny feel good party-all-the-time movie they were expecting.  Give Korine credit for not exploiting his targeted audience unlike some cynical Hollywood types and showing life as it is.

It's truly a beautiful and interesting movie visually, and quite an experience, but if you go in expecting to be entertained as one is usually entertained when watching a movie, you will absolutely despise it.

Spring Breakers consisted BAD ACTING, TONS of NAKED GIRLS shaking their breasts and butts and partying. The first five minutes is random clips of kids at Spring Break partying and acting disgusting. The only highlight was James Franco playing a character unlike anything he has done before. However, even his acting abilities were awful with such a bad script.
Basically this movie is about 4 college girls who want to go to Spring Break. 3 of them rob a small diner to get the rest of the money they need. They party, kiss, shake their bodies, party, do drugs, party, get arrested for drugs, get bailed out by a drug dealer/rapper/gangsta (James Franco), party, rob people, and so on.
The best part of the movie was the credits, which we fast fowarded through the second half only stopping to see if it was getting better. Nope, still sucked.
I don't know if Im more disgusted by this film or the fact that I will never get any of that time I spent watching it back in my life.

Most of the film is composed and shot like a music video, an appropriate creative choice given the euphoric MTV fantasy the protagonists of the film are expecting to find on their escape from the boredom of their everyday lives. All of primary actors portray their roles convincingly, but Franco's perfomance is outstanding. Audiences watch as one-by-one, the characters find their delusions shattered by reality, their self-directed lies exhausted by the realization that consequences do come.

This is far from my favorite movie, but 'Spring Breakers' makes the very most of its theme and techniques to leave an impression on its audiences. This movie will divide its viewers, but it is well worth experiencing at least once.",1379808000,,777,5.166666666666667

5611677,1,B00BEJL4XS,"The only redeemable quality about this film is James Franco, who must've been friends with the director or lost a bet or something, because he usually doesn't sully his trackt record like this.

Spring Breakers, from what I heard, is a satire/social commentary on today's party-crazy youth. I don't know where that was in the movie though, because it seemed to get caught up in whatever it was trying to criticize. So instead of Spring Breakers showing the dark side to the party life, it instead descends to some petty gangster movie. Basically James Franco bails these chicks out of jail, and some of them help him kill a rival. *Yawn*, oh sorry was that story supposed to be interesting? When he bailed them out one of the girls gets cautious and starts wondering why he bailed them out, what ulterior motives James had, which could've gone in a far more interesting direction. But no, instead we get some glamorized shoot out complete with ironic Britney Spears music on top.

This movie also has a tendency to repeat dialogue over and over again, as if James Franco groaning ""spriiing breaaaak"" is meaningful only once, we need to hear it instead like 50 times. The story just flat out sucked, many shots that could've been spent attempting to develop these flat characters instead shows them dancing/posing for pictures in slow motion with voice overs repeated ad nauseum. Before the remaining girls and James Franco go to the final shootout, they have slow motion sex in a hot tub repeating the same ""scaredy cat"" line for about 15 minutes. Finally they stroll over to his rival and basically just kill everyone, no consequences for the girls, just pussy power or whatever. I wasn't focused on the ending so it looked like they just shot James Franco in the back and were about to leave, but I rewinded and saw that he just got shot by the first guy and they resume the murdering rampage without him. So what we know about these girls is that they like to murder, which doesn't seem like an accurate depiction of most girls on spring break. Again, another missed opportunity where it would've been much more interesting to see them just shoot James in the back and walk away from his mess.

Overall this movie's plot development moves at a glacial pace with vapid uninspired characters in glitzy neon locations. Whatever Spring Breakers was supposedly trying to lampoon turned into a self parody where it devolves into a crappy gangster movie; don't waste your time and watch Pain & Gain instead.",1378944000,3,2503,4.749425287356321

There is nudity (no, not Selena Gomez, Ashley Benson, nor Vanessa Hudgens) But I was pleasantly surprised with Gomez's performance.

5611681,1,B00BEJL4XS,"I never seen such a movie that has over 1,400 reviews saying this movie sucks!!! This movie has only 200, 5 stars positive reviews. That's nothing compared to the negative reviews.  So, as you see can by many bad reviews, if you watch this, you already know, this movie will most likely have you hating it at the end! That is because nothing about this movie was worth wild to see.

However, I wanted to give it a shot. So, I actually did watch it, and form my own opinion about it. So, to me, it is a Girls Gone Wild video without all the nudity in it. There isn't much of a story to tell and the simple story doesn't seem to go anywhere. You are basically paying to watch a pimp having his way with these young, messed up girls. There was 4 girls that went on the spring break trip, but only 3 girls stayed there after spring break with the pimp. The smarter one Selena Gomez, left because she was the only smart sensible one in the bunch.

It really seemed like these girls have no meaning in their lives, so they are trying to figure that out, but not in a good way. They do it by partying, drug use, and a whole lot of sex. It looks like they're looking towards the pimp as their life coach, which they also have sex with him. Also, the pimp gets the girls to do a murder job with him, which is the supposed to be the highlight of the movie. WTF? That's their climax. This really is a crappy movie! What's the point really for him to do this big murder you ask? Well, it's because he wants to prove that he a true boss to others. I wasn't impressed.

In the end, the movie was never good. I did regret watching it and if you want to just watch this for the girls in bikinis with little story, then be my guest. This is probably for you anyways. There's nothing but that and there's no directions from it. To add, with the really poor acting skills they have will be a perfect match for this movie.

Being already short, removing those scenes probably leaves us with 70 minutes of actual movie. And while I am not opposed to nudity whatsoever, it seemed to be in this movie just because ""why not"" and it was there quite often with no real purpose.

To me that actual movie is fairly entertaining, especially the second half. James Franco is ridiculous. Between the four girls they have a few different personality types covered which I liked. And in general it's a twisted, strange ride.

5611697,4,B00BEJL4XS,"After leaving the theater for Spring Breakers, I had ""WTF"" written all over my face. When a friend asked what the film was about, I searched for the words to describe it, but the only phrase that came to mind was ""ass and titties.""

 For at least five minutes, I watched, mystified by a montage of beer bongs, drug use, and topless young women jumping in slow motion. Little did I know that montage would set the tone for the entirety of the film. Little did I know, I was going to actually enjoy said film.

 Harmony Korine has made his share of controversial social commentary films in the past, including KIDS and Trash Humpers. Having been exposed to his past work, I had an idea of what I was about to see, but the cast of young former Disney starlets threw me for a loop.

 The film centers around four college girls who want to add some excitement to their lives by taking a spring break trip to Florida. Right off the bat, Candy (Vanessa Hudgens) and Brit (Ashley Benson) are made out to be the bad seeds of the group. After getting into trouble with the police after a night of partying, the girls meet a gangster, Alien (James Franco), who bails them out, gives them a place to stay and shows them a new way of life. Some are enamored with his way of life, but Faith (Selena Gomez) has a hard time with it and leaves halfway through the film.

 Franco's portrayal of Alien is by far the best performance in the film. His character is dark, but somehow manages to be the comic relief. In a stand-out scene, he sings a Britney Spears song on an outdoor piano, surrounded by the girls in bathing suits and hot pink face masks. Most of the time, he made me so uncomfortable that I didn't know if I wanted to laugh or cringe.

 It was odd to me that a film that was almost completely void of an actual plot was so captivating. I was in awe of the aesthetic brilliance that Spring Breakers displayed. There is beautiful lighting that lends itself to the allure of the spring break experience for today's young people. The sounds complemented the visuals perfectly, with a mixture of dub-step songs and a video game-like score by Cliff Martinez.

 This is a film that could very easily be written off as boring or lazy. I disagree. It is one of the rare films that you can look at and know that every artistic choice was made for a very specific reason. It was much more than ""ass and titties,"" it just took a while for me to peel back the layers of Spring Breakers.
 If the film itself is boring, it only serves to make a point about our culture. No matter how much fun the girls are having, the tone is dull. Similarly, no matter how fun MTV makes spring break look, there is a darker side to it, and that side is seldom put on display. Korine delves into the dark side in an extreme way with a film that is rich in style and depth alike.",1378425600,8,2843,4.281716417910448
5611698,4,B00BEJL4XS,"Completely unexpected- These former Disney stars really shocked me with this performance and James Franco was amazing and perfectly grating.  Does have a bit of a ""Devils Rejects"" vibe.",1378425600,,185,5.379310344827586
5611699,1,B00BEJL4XS,"Four girls, three of whom, we know absolutely nothing about, hold up a fast-food chicken joint. Why? Because they want to go on spring break, and they don't have enough money. Nothing like planning ahead, huh? There is no indication why or how these girls got to be so uncaring and brutally wicked, so you really don't care much for their cause. After partaking in a variety of criminal activity, they get busted. Some scumbag who resembles James Franco pays their fines, incorrectly stated as ""posted bail"" in the movie, and they are set free, only to become a naive and, frankly, unbelievable part of his dysfunctional, and even more unbelievable, world.

That's the story. Nothing more. Oh, except for a completely impossible and obviously contrived ending.

It takes two hours to tell that cheesy story, because most of the movie is busy showing butts, boobs, cellulite, and other assorted idiots and their parts, who have no idea what life is truly about.  Over and over again, we are taken to scenes of the beer bongs, and the pass-outs, and the pukers, and the floozies, and the losers partying in their jockstraps, etc., etc., etc., ... utterly ridiculous! In some cases, the same exact shots are shown again thirty minutes or so later in the movie. The director was hoping we wouldn't notice; I'm sure.

If you want pornography, then buy pornography, not this trash!  I heard some guy at work say, ""You get to see Vanessa Hudgens naked!""  You know what? So what? You can buy a Penthouse or a Playboy and see women, real women, who will strip down for you, if you're into that kind of thing. Believe me, Ms. Hudgens is no great prize. Her hips are wide. Her but is flat, and she's just a child, for God's sake.

Then again, in retrospect, that may have been the point of the movie after all. A subtitle for this movie could be: ""F-Bomb Gone Wild"", especially as it relates to the James Franco character. I'm no prude by any means, but what was the point of that?

Understandably, many movies require a certain level of ""suspension of belief"". If the movie is good, one can easily do that. But if it's not, it seems unforgiveable. For me this movie was unforgiveable. One example: the police breaking up a spring break party and arresting the girls; this was germane to plot. However, during the rest of the movie when crimes are being committed (shoot-outs, murder, etc.) there isn't even the background sound of a police siren. And the ending? Simply, WT$!

Some get out early, some don't).  It's definitely more for those that enjoy an independent film as it, honestly, shouldn't have been advertised to the masses.
This is legitimately one of my favorite roles by James Franco, believe it or not.  The casting altogether was spot on.  I was expecting the worse from the Disney princesses, but they delivered.  No one seemed to be forcing their lines/emotions.  It almost seemed like the movie was written around the casting.

I get the point of it but it was so unrealistic,  I can't put my stamp on it & I love disturbing movies, good ones tho! I didn't find what most find disturbing at all. Laughable. Sorry. Spring break itself is disturbing. Its girls gone wild live. Pathetic, sad, unfortunate. .. But for the movie, 1st off, no way would those inexperienced little brats make it out of a chicken shack robbery!  They'd end up getting plugged by a customer. If I saw some uncoordinated teeny bopper waving a mallet my way the way she was, she'd get my blade in her neck b4 she could even blink. Tape on the gun is a dead giveaway. Maybe in some middle class restaurant & neighborhood w/ patrons w/ no guts, but a chicken shack? B.... PLEASE!  Same w/ the end. They never would've made it off the dock. Those girls would probably shoot themselves by accident. Not saying women can't shoot. I am & I can, but when they can't even swing a mallet convincingly,  they'd last 2 sec. TOPS! Maybe if they were more apt for the role, cool.

  Was it entertaining?  Sure. Stupid? Uhhh, yeah.  Ridiculous done right is 1 thing, just feel like they missed the bar on that 1. Spring break part was accurate, just as sad as it is in real life. That they got right, except it gets worse than that. Ev1 entitled to their opinion & I won't hate on any1 who loved it. I thought I would too but found it disappointing. That's just how I feel.

I get that most people saw that Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgins was in it and assumed it was some kind of teenage Hangover. It's not. Spring Breakers, I feel, is on the same artistic level as True Romance and Natural Born Killers. It is not meant to be some Project X type movie about bored girls that go on Spring Break. This movie is gritty, visceral, and you may want to take a shower afterwards...in a good way. James Franco is a marvel in this role. In his scenes with Selena Gomez he was almost so greasy I had to look away. He made my skin crawl. What I thought was the most fascinating part of the movie was that when you meet Franco's character, you believe he's this monster who's going to take these girls and turn them into victims- and what happens is that they make him one instead. When the really bad stuff goes down, there is a shot of Alien with this look in his eyes that makes you know he's scared sh*tless and is only doing this because the girls are much worse than he ever dreamed of being. He's brilliant.

Is what happens in the final scene ridiculous? Yes. But even knowing that, as I watched, I wasn't thinking of that. I was thinking that it worked, somehow. Not all movies require to have this linear plot where everything is tied up in a neat little bow. I call the ones that don't snapshot movies. These are movies that are pieces of time taken out and shown to you, then put back; you got the idea, you get the emotion. Then it's done. This is one of those.

5611741,1,B00BEJL4XS,"Some films are disturbing, but they seem authentic, and they are done with artistic integrity. Spring Breakers is utterly revolting, and its artistic rendition is highly contrived. Reviewers who have rated it highly have used primarily two arguments: (1) The director intended both its depravity and its artistic artifice; and (2) Those who don't like it, don't ""get it"". This is the film of a nightmare. There are great films made about nightmares. This is not one of them. If someone asked me to describe hell, I would ask him/her to see this film. The fact that the film claims to represent one of America's well-established institutions (Spring Break for kids), it tells us that our kids look forward to walking into hell in spring of every year. There are two possibilities: either the film distorts reality beyond recognition, or what American kids consider ""fun"" has crossed all bounds of reason. Each viewer of the film can form his/her own judgement on these.

I saw it because a significant number of film critics rated it highly. I respect their judgement, but disagree with them. I see a large number of films, and have a fairly high tolerance for films with upsetting subjects. I accept films whose subjects or representations I disagree with. But a film has to have some redeeming qualities to justify its subject. I did not find any redeeming qualities in this film. I sat through to the end hoping that something extraordinary will give it a new vision. No such luck. The film suggests that you can find enjoyment in hell, and then walk away from it whenever you like.

Ok, not just watched, I watched it last night (and to be honest turned it off 3/4 of the way through because it was just too strange/bad) and gave myself a night to sleep on it and process it.

This movie has zero plot. There is hardly any dialogue happening throughout the entire film; mostly it is just a pretty decent soundtrack shot in the style of a music video (which was actually pretty well done, and would have been more fitting for a short film or a music video). There is no character development, whatsoever -- I don't even know all 4 of the girls' names. We know nothing about them, who they are as people, why they feel this burning need to ""break free and get away"" or what is going on in their lives. The only time we do actually get any dialogue from them it is broken up into flashback-esque, cryptic nonsense which contributes nothing to the plot of storyline. Seriously. What?

Then James Franco's character comes in. I actually thought Franco did a marvelous job at adapting to is character, because he was shady and creepy as you-know-what. But again, strange. Just so, so strange.

Some might argue I can't give an accurate review of this movie because, you know, I didn't actually finish it (and that should give you an idea of how bad it was, because I was thoroughly stoned throughout the whole thing and if a stoned person can't sit through a film, you know it's bad). This movie gives the viewer and extremely strange, uncomfortable and dirty feeling, and I actually liked the way it was shot -- very gritty and unsettling. I don't really know how to describe it, but the way everything is portrayed and shot just makes you feel very, very uneasy and like a shower afterwards would be a great idea to rinse off all the strange drug and booze-heavy scenes.

I think this movie could have been much better with more dialogue, more backstory into the girls and why they seemed to be obsessed with getting away and breaking free. But all of this went unexplored and turned into a strange, lackluster, pointless film.",1376870400,3,2142,4.512886597938144

5611749,2,B00BEJL4XS,"As far as what the film sets out to do (whatever it is), Harmony Korine's latest film is a success. With Oscar nominated James Franco and two Disney Channel starlets in bikini, ""Spring Breakers"" is sure to attract the attention of the potential audiences.

The story itself is simple. Four bored college students Brittany (Ashley Benson), Candy (Vanessa Hudgens), Cotty (Rachel Korine) and Faith (Selena Gomez) travel to St. Petersburg, Florida, where they make some easy money before getting arrested by the police. When they think their spring break is over, the girls are bailed out by a local rapper (and drug/arms dealer) ""Alien"" (James Franco).

It is rather easy to defend the film by pointing out its attempts to make commentaries on whatever it wants to deal with. The film seems to make its point in a visually unique fashion, and many critics and reviewers have expressed their ideas as to what it is all about (satire on modern youth culture, etc.), but none of them is convincing, and more importantly, interesting.

5611753,5,B00BEJL4XS,"So, tonight I finally was able to see the film that everyone has been talking about this year; `Spring Breakers'.  It's been a long time coming.  I should have seen it in the theaters, I know, but my life is far too hectic and busy to allow for that kind of thing.  When you have three children it appears that unless it's a cartoon, I don't get to the theater to see it (an exaggeration, but not a very big one).  I've refrained from reading very many reviews, mostly because I didn't want to spoil for myself what was bound to be the highlight of my cinematic year.

Right?

Before watching `Spring Breakers', I sat down to watch Harmony Korine's very first film; `Kids'.  While he didn't direct it, he wrote the screenplay at the ripe old age of 19, and so I was interested to see how these two bookends complimented one another.  I must say, watching these two films back to back brought so much perspective to both features and helped highlight the raw honesty of Korine's vision.  Despite being 18 years apart, the themes and even the way in which those themes are expressed and expounded on show the bleakness of youth and their culture and how little it has evolved over the years.

""Life is short.""  A taxi driver makes that statement to a grief stricken Chloe Sevigny in `Kids' and that very statement, while a very common one, makes itself extremely prevalent in both of these features.  The truth in that statement looms over every frame like a dark cloud that permeates every moment, every sequence, every nightmarish reality.  Harmony Korine is not afraid to exploit the darkside of modern youth, and finding fragments of apathy and ignorance to lace the development of character gives both `Kids' and `Spring Breakers' a chilling sense of honesty.

We hate for it to be true, but we can't deny that it is.

That is what makes these films so socially important.  They are not shy of social relevance, no matter how unattractive or uncomfortable it may be.  Watching either film, especially `Kids', is not pretty.  In fact, I squirmed during some moments and found my stomach tensing as certain sequences of events were unfolding in a way that made me feel almost dirty.  Korine doesn't sugarcoat a thing.  He lays it all bare for us to decipher and dissect.

With `Kids', Korine exposed the ignorance of youth in the way they viewed sex.  With innocence being wasted on a group of children thrust into life, wholly unaware of where it is going to take them, `Kids' is a brutal look at the effect that growing up too soon can have on an entire generation.  With `Spring Breakers' he exposes a more apathetic view towards life itself but showing the steady decline of morals and value of life as these young girls fall into a pattern of reckless abandon.  Together they paint a stark yet accurate picture of the very problem with society today.  Children are oppressed by the very image of immorality that corrupts the heart of pop culture and creates in them a complete disregard for life because to them they are invincible.  In `Kids', young Telly is blinded to facts by the fantasy idea that sex with virgins will keep him safe from STDs, while in `Spring Breakers' the girls fall into a video game mentality, even using that very inspiration for their behavior (""just pretend it's a video game, like you're in a movie"").

Littered with provocative and lived in performances, both films thrive thanks to the dedicated performances throughout.  James Franco, Selena Gomez, Chloe Sevigny, Rosario Dawson, Justin Pierce and many more lend their surprising talents to creating characters that feel far more than mere caricatures.

These are not easy films to watch and yet they are important because they expose something that many people are afraid to embrace.  Our youth are being polluted, possibly by the very films that are exposing that pollution (the controversy surrounding `Spring Breakers' alone points to the detractors to this very kind of statement piece) and yet adults are afraid to look that pollution in the face and work to clean it up.  Harmony Korine has seen that pollution, and he has given it a voice and, in the process, lent us his eye.",1376524800,8,4173,4.706611570247934
5611754,5,B00BEJL4XS,"This is not a teen party comedy. Its so much more than that and so much better. Its a deeper look at hedonism in modern society with an emphasis placed on impressionability. The characters are heavily influenced by media and their mentor, Alien. In Spring Breakers, morality is negotiable, but the ride is thrilling. The use of repetition throughout the movie to highlight the major themes stuns while promoting an introspective response from the audience. To put it simply: This Movie Rocks!

However, Don't let your kids watch this movie. Its not anything anyone under 18 should watch. Scenes include heavy recreational drug use, blatant sexuality, including a 3-way and about a million boobs, and turf war violence.",1376524800,5,718,5.084745762711864
5611755,4,B00BEJL4XS,"I just finished watching Spring Breakers and I have to honestly say it was amazing. Many people saw the trailers and thought it was going to be fast-paced, funny, action-packed, and cool, but it was actually very dark, confusing, boring, and repetitive. It's basically Harmony Korine showing us that the ""spring break"" world portrayed on MTV and Girls Gone Wild is not real, as in a dream world. Despite all the bright neon colors, beautiful cinematography, and hot beach babes looking like something straight out of a music video the film is incredibly dark and disturbing, just like the real ""world"" of Spring Break. It's quite a cinematic accomplishment if I do say so myself. The film is rich with symbolism and metaphor and it took a while for me to fully grasp and understand it all. The James Franco character ""Alien"" is so named because he's living in a different world, the dark real ""world"" of spring break devoid of the humor, action, and coolness you were expecting, and what many college kids who seek after this world end up discovering. His sole purpose is to wake them up from the dreamworld, to guide them back to reality.

He seems cruel and evil, but deep down there is a kindhearted tenderness you wouldn't expect from a guy like him, which is illustrated many times throughout the film, most notably during the scene at the piano when the haunting Britney Spears song ""Everytime"" plays. The truth is, in reality he wasn't the villain, but the hero of the film, perhaps even an angel sent to guide them, who ""dies"" when he realizes that the last two girls are never going to wake up.  Selena Gomez's character ""Faith"" is the closest to the light of god and heaven and because of her innate spirituality, or ""Faith"", she has the intuition to see that ""something"" bad is going to happen. She leaves early on, not wanting to descend into this different world, a world that only she can see for it's true nature. She tries to warn her friends, tries to wake them up, but they're still asleep and all she can do is hope they wake up before it's too late. Regarding the scene towards the end involving the remaining two girls, this properly illustrates this point. They've descended so deep into the dream world they're no longer even willing, it seems, to wake up from it even though we the viewers can clearly see it's not real, and it's THESE very people that you see on Spring Break Fever and Girls Gone Wild, the dreamers who are still fast asleep. And regarding how you never learn the fates of the final two girls, played by Vanessa Hudgens and Rachel Korine, that was actually an incredibly smart move on Harmony's part, because it really doesn't matter, of course you can assume all kinds of things like they get caught and arrested or even killed but that wasn't the main point. The main ""point"" is that they're trapped in the dreamworld, and this film shows the dark fate of those that never wake up and begin living in the real world. In the end, while I do appreciate the art-house quality of the movie and understand what it is was trying to say, the message itself is so dark and depressing that I can't award it a full five stars. If there had been more hope, optimism, and light involved it would have gotten five stars from me, but because it failed to do this it gets only four. A dark surreal masterpiece if there ever was one, it borders on being a horror film. I highly suggest you at least watch it once. There's a LOT more going on than you think.",1376524800,2,3485,4.521394611727417

5611761,3,B00BEJL4XS,"::::::::There be spoilers::::::::

Harmony Korine crafts a bright, hyper, lunatic film of four girls who just have to go to spring break. The question is, who are these girls? By the end of the film I didn't know their names. I know Selina Gomez is the bored church girl who seems to live with her grandmother and hangs out with her three skank friends Fake blond 1, Fake blond 2 and Pink hair. They have saved money to go to spring break (as if that is actually a place, it's not addressed where they actually go!) but not enough, so the three not Selina girls rob a restaurant with water pistols and a mallet. They jet off to ""spring break"" (via bus) and do a lot of coke & weed. They get busted at a party and bailed out by James Franco, Alien, a drug dealer with twin henchmen (who's characters seem menacing, but who just vanish before the film ends) and a seeming love of Fivesomes.

Church girl bails, pink hair girl gets bullet in arm, bails, fake blonds stay, have three-way in swimming pool and go out to get revenge on the rival dealer who shot pink-hair girl.

The film ends with two blond girls holding guns limp-wristed at arms length looking like they are going to drop them at any second and may at best shoot the dirt in front of them manage to take out an entire gang Martin Rigg's style!

For all the bare breast our Disney alum and friends stay mostly covered, so if that's what you're looking for, you're not getting it. Karmine has shot and edited the film in frenetic Oliver Stone mode, but without the control or finesse. Scenes are glimpsed out of context and out of continuity and lines are echoed over and over and over -- Franco ""spring break, forevah!"" get's so grating you want to hit him for saying it once much less a hundred times! Yet there's really no moments to know any of these girls save the Gomez character. There's a scene near the end where two fake blond make what sound like good-bye phone calls, to give the viewer a sense they are going to die. Do they? Who cares? You don't care about them, they are just eye candy.

And so is this film, just a frantic, lunatic ""natural born killers"" wannabe that forgets first we have to know and care about the characters then the action has meaning.",1376438400,,2233,4.371084337349398

5611782,5,B00BEJL4XS,"First off let me say I have long been critical of so-called art films. If you mesh tons of explicit content together this doesn't automatically qualify it as art. This film is way way out of mainstream and it really surprises me that it received a wide release. It does not appeal to a wide audience and most people will be shocked and hate it. Others will appreciate it but in all sense it is not a likable film. It is very disturbing in parts and overall powerful but very uncomfortable. The film is thoroughly broken but that is what makes an exploitation film an exploitation film, it embraces it's flaws.

The film differs greatly from it's trailer as it is not a lighthearted, trashy, ""Project X"" on spring break. Most people going into this film probably expected that and were disappointed when presented with a quality, thought-worthy film. Harmony Korine gave a real slap in the face to people who expected that. Going into this film I knew of Korine's other works and knew this was going to be no different. The film is dark with a menacing and uncomfortable feel throughout.

Many criticisms of this film are of flaws that were done intentionally. Such as the repetitive dialogue or overly innocent main characters. The acting is excellent as all the actors are out of their comfort zone and deliver. The cinematography, as always, is beautifully artistic. This film most likely went over the majority of peoples heads who gave it a negative review. It's a thought-provoking social commentary that delivers on all levels. I don't want to give any of it away as you need to dissect it yourself.

This film is certainly not for everyone and is an unpleasant watch. Do not go in expecting trash but instead be prepared for a shocking and unorthodox masterpiece.

5611791,3,B00BEJL4XS,"SpringBreakers cant make up its mind what it is, so u get a lot of stuff baked and served to different degrees. Eye-candy teen girls who've known each other since kindergarten do a robbery to get money to go on Spring Break.
Selena Gomez is the ""Christian"" in the group,which for some odd reason was planning to go on SB, but never bothered to find out how much air fare and rooms would be.
OK, so the metaphor of wanting to get away exists strongly enough. The cinematography is excellent but anyone whose been through these forced days of drunkenness, stupidity and drugs knows the down-times exist within a lot of pseudo-spontaneighty and everybody hugs everybody when ur high. So ""SpringBreak"" exists as a state of mind vis-a-vis 'escape.'
Here there is LOTS of ""feeling"" shots: young girls hugging, kissing, you get the feeling there's commiserating and affection thats real, but not enough writing talent to bring it. Nonstop cinematic warm-fuzzies without words.

We forgive that and join the girls as they drink, dance, flirt - maybe have some sex (?) and snort coke, the latter landing them in jail, only to have their fines paid by a local-drug lord-rapper with a mansion and millions.
James Franco is GREAT as a slimy creation that anyone with half-a-brain would run from, and Gomez' character appears to be the only one with such an organ functioning.
Gomez senses these are not the people to be with and goes home. Too bad, she was terrific, and actually had lines that helped to define A CHARACTER; something very unusual in this movie.

One of the remaining girls gets wounded in a drive-by and also goes home, but here the other two TAKE A HUGE TURN and become gangsters cinemetography-wise like at the end like Tropic Thunder, killing everyone ala Natural Born Killers. In those movies, we get a feeling for those characters that matches up with their actions; even ridiculous ones as in Tropic Thunder. But here
there's NO DIALOGUE to even attempt to create the last two characters. Young girls having sex with drug lord and are then willing to murder and/or die for him... and, it's just tossed on the screen like its a music-video. I believe the creator's of the movie simply ran out of ideas and simply gave up.",1375660800,,2232,4.73521850899743

5611794,1,B00BEJL4XS,"I honestly already kinda knew what to expect going into this flick. I knew Selena Gomez was gonna be the church goin one who would not involve herself in all the sinning that was going on but I figured maybe she'll surprise me. I was expecting a raunchy teenage movie, but after watching this that's putting it lightly. So you have Vanessa Hudgens, Selena Gomez & 2 other girls I don't know, they all attend some small college in the middle of nowhere. It's that time of the year when all the young college types go down to Florida & let loose, only problem is that Vanessa & her friends don't have enough money for the trip so then, we're 4 young smart college girls, how do we get this money? A bikini carwash, no that would take too much work & we need this money right now. I know, lets rob someone or someone's. So then, now that we have the money, onward let's go. The girls make it to Florida & start doing what young college girls do, party & tease all the horny guys lookin to get laid. They somehow end up at a party in the hotel they're staying at which gets raided by the local cops, it seems there is other girls there but when the cops show up they seem to be the only ones that get arrested. In comes James Franco who for this movie is playing a wannabe black drug dealer gangster, he springs our four main characters from jail. Franco lives in a lavish looking home with cash all over the place but for some reason drives a crappy junk looking Camaro. He seems to think these 4 girls have potential even though they've done absolutely nothing to show him that. Now this movie could've gone in various directions at this point but the director had a small budget to work with so let's keep it simple. He takes them to a pool hall where all the local black drug dealers hang out to have some fun, no not that kind of fun, really, just playing pool. I honestly think that the script for this movie probably started out a certain way, but then Selena Gomez read it & said ""No, i'm a Disney sweetheart, I can not allow anyone who doesn't match Beiber's eloquence to even get close to this"". So then her part in the movie was re-written to keep her pure & free of sin. She's visibly creeped out in the pool hall at the site of all these shirtless gangsta black guys she kept referring to as ""These People"" saying I do not want them touching me. The other three girls didn't have a problem with anything so then, Selena takes her leave & heads back to pure small town America where she clearly belongs. Franco enlist his remaining 3 new friends in a series of robberies of other drug dealers & such & everything is awesome until the town kingpin gets wind of what's going on & gives him an ultimatum to get out of town, shooting one of his female soldiers in the process. Well we can't have that, who do these black guys think they are? So then, the girl who got shot gets scared & decides to tuck in her tail & run, no such thing for Hudgens & the remaining girl. They along with Franco go get revenge pulling up to Mr Bigs house in a cig boat & when Franco is shot down right away, Hudgens & the other girl rampage the house killing everyone, & then kill Mr Big & then steal his Lambo to boot just like in some kinda Saints Row videogame, that's it. Now remember, these are just regular girls with no formal defensive or weapons training & yet they take down all of these thugs with relative ease. There now you don't have to waste 2 hours of your life watching this horrible flick. Now if your drunk with friends & just want some background noise during a house party then this may work. The movie had lots of T&A only problem was that barely any of it was of our 4 main characters. Gomez other than being in a bikini, which she looked pretty sexy in, never shows anything. Of the other girls, there were a few hints of breast but that's it. I mean there's the pool scene but they're so hugged up on eachother you don't see anything. I'd have given 2 stars if Hudgens had a clear breast shot or some full frontal at some point or if Gomez had been made to pay for her bail with some tail but nothing. In the end, this movie seemed more like a college documentary filmed with an iphone than an actual movie.

I find it better than average, but again she needs a bit of tweaking.  For the awful plot of this movie and its bling-like role-playing, I think she could have done better to ""break out"" of her ""goody-two-shoes"" reputation from Disney.  Still, at least she isn't doing a Lohan that I've heard of so far.  She seems to have a good head on her shoulders despite Hollywood's pressures and false ""coolness"".  I hope she stays well-grounded, and that this minimal role will be just a brief bump in the road.  She has talent, and seems to be a good person besides.  Hollywood can corrupt even a saint.  So I wish her well, and though this movie has a little bit of ""sexy"" in it (bikini girls), I find it no more than ok.  Nothing special.  Typical shoot-em-up with some diverting gore that destroys any quality it might have had.  As a vet, I don't care to see more killing and viciousness from criminals.  It may be exciting to young people who haven't experienced the real world yet, but for those of us who have (includes a number of my police/military friends), it's just money-sucking from the gullible, and teen titillation.

If you are just looking for a short well done fantasy movie where basically the trailer pretty much tells you what you are exactly renting and I think all of the haters were expecting some hollywood over budget type of movie and clearly this movie is not like that at all. This movie was VERY well done with the camera work, the actors/actresses did a good job portraying themselves as stereotype people that you pretty much see today in the real world and actually poke fun of it at the same time. Sure the four girls who star in this movie are probably not you're favorite actresses but don't let that bother you since this is not some reality TV E! movie or some crap. The movie does a good job showing how sick and boring the real world is when everybody is stuck in the same 24/7 routine and bends a little bit into the fantasy type world of being showered in money and fame. I really don't understand why there is alot of hate in this movie but Once i started reading some of the bad reviews, it is clearly obvious those bad reviewers are the same type of people that think adam sandler movies like ""grown up"" is the best comedy movie of all time or they think the fast and the furious movies are the greatest action films of all time which is absolutely hilarious, so I chose to ignore those type of reviewers and I was glad I did because Spring Breakers will actually surprised you if you give it a chance. Plus Spring Breakers is a brilliant example of saying ""you may hate this movie but at the same time you will love it"" if you know what I mean. The awesome bright neon lights, the superb raw energy and a great cultural reality check type of movie as well. It is worth watching once and of course this is not the movie of the year or whatnot. Also, the director of Spring Breakers was also the writer for the underrated controversial ""Kids"" movie back in 1995 and even THAT movie got bad reviews by religious people/parents but turned out to be a great wake up movie for people who actually enjoy watching movies without being so damn judgemental. Plus, he directed ""Gummo"" as well. So if you have not seen ""Gummo"" or ""Kids"" then this movie is clearly not for you and you may be better off with watching some over budget hollywood movie.",1374969600,10,2336,4.370114942528736

5611828,5,B00BEJL4XS,"Spring Breakers is one of the most beautiful and enjoyable films I've seen in a long time. It's 94 minutes pulsate with a manic, magical energy for which most filmmakers would gladly trade their first born. The plot is self-consciously crass, silly and deeply superficial (not an oxymoron), and the acting is average at best - with the major exceptions of James Franco (the best performance of his career, without question) and Gucci Mane (who steals every scene he's in). But the point of this film isn't to dazzle you with great acting or stir your soul with a gripping narrative. The point is to convey an energy, to take you on a trip, to mess with you and mess with your expectations of what film-making could be.

It's entirely possible to watch this film and hate it for completely legitimate reasons. But 90-95% of the 1-star reviewers here and elsewhere are completely missing the point of the film is trying to achieve; indeed, they seem totally disinterested in even asking the question, or wondering whether the expectations they have for what a film ""should"" be are, in fact, the only expectations one can or should have. For many reviewers, it's hardly their fault. After all, the majority are likely between the ages of 12 and 18, lured into theaters by the bright light of Selena Gomez's celebrity and the movie promoters' remarkably effective social-media campaign. To them, ""unconventional filmmaking"" begins and ends with their blue-ray directors cut of The Notebook. They've never seen Gummo or Julian Donkey Boy, never heard of Werner Herzog or Russ Meyer. So it's not surprising they'd react so harshly.

Like I said - it's entirely possible to watch this movie on its own terms and still hate it. But most of the criticisms here are by adolescents or prudes or just plain dullards- people with no interest in questioning what makes a movie good or bad, fun or boring, kinetic or lifeless. Personally, I think this film is flat-out brilliant. But you to watch it with an open mind about what 'brilliant' can mean.",1374883200,3,2035,4.811428571428571

I wanted it to be over but I realized it was because it rung true with a lot of people I know and have known in the party culture. It's about distopia and vapidness. The ending sort of diverts into fantasy because none of what happens before leads you to believe it could happen for real.

5611832,1,B00BEJL4XS,"James Franco is my favorite young actor. But this movie is a waste of his talents. It is the biggest piece of garbage I have ever seen. I can't imagine how or why it made money. It is absolute rubbish---zero plot and utterly misogynistic.  It is offensive in every way. It has no script, it has no plot, it has no real cinematography.

This movie presents all young women as slutty and all black males as thugs and drug dealers.  Besides Piranha 2, it is the worst movie I've ever seen. Do NOT believe the 5-star reviews claiming that all the low reviews are the result of ""not understanding the subtle genius"" of this movie. That's utter nonsense. I'm a student of cinema, I go to indie movie houses all the time, and this film has no redeeming creative qualities.

And Franco's alleged ""brilliant"" performance?  No chance. They cornrow his hair, they laquer his teeth, they stick a pair of 70s shades on his face, they dress him gangsta, they give him cheap, silly dialogue. But what makes Franco so appealing is that he doesn't need all that stuff; his expressive face exudes a powerful inner pain and torment far beyond his years. Heck, he's at his best in a pair of ratty jeans and a black t-shirt, not disguised as some LA rapper.

The 4 female leads aren't in Franco's acting league. But they are not bad actresses. They do have potential that is never explored here. I don't think you ever see them not in bikinis, which means the director had no faith in their acting abilities.

The beach footage shows acres of bikini-clad women, with a sprinkling of men. Yeah, get real. Here's what spring break is really like: 10 drunken guys to every girl and if you're lucky enough to have a girl talk to you, it's because she wants to soak you for free booze.

When I rented this from redbox I didn't know what to expect. Having not seen a preview or even heard about I gave it a chance via the hot Selena or Vanessa. When I put it on I thought time to see the girls in bikinis. When I started it I had no idea what the films point was.  I got very  hooked especially when James Franco appears. The  music and unpredictable style of filming will keep you interested. The characters have simple minded almost ignorant and generic motives, power,money,sex and just all out to have a good time.  But it really starts to get interesting about 20 min in, when they meet Alien (James frano) a white rapper drug dealer born and raised in all black community. He is an annoying but very sincere character.  I had allot of sympathy for Alien. The scenes in ths film are very powerful and play off of raw human emotions ( happiness,love,hate and fear. There is not allot of dialogue its almost like watching an 80 min music video, but I believe a good movie doesn't always need allot of dialouge. The scenes with Franco and Gucci Mane are very raw and eerie feeling. It has an epic feel and the bizarre bond these characters have, kept my attention till the end. Like the movies Crash, Haven it is a very dreamy feel. This is acheived by flash video shots, anda clever mixture of Gangster rap, pop,dance, and classical score layered with sweeping and appregiated synthesizer sounds.

5611856,3,B00BEJL4XS,"Not too often will I write a bad review. I have seen very many movies both good and bad. I am honest, but I try my best not to do bad reviews( if at all possible). This is a movie that has been hailed as being both good and bad. So in my 56th review, I am going to give my take on the movie: Spring Breakers.

Spring Breakers has a star studded cast that includes: Selena Gomez as Faith(ironically enough you will see why), Vanessa Hudgens as Candy , Ashley Benson as Brittany, Rachel Korine as Cotty, a rapper by the name of Gucci Mane as Archie, and James Franco as the character Alien (yes ALIEN). For the type of movie this is, and the way this movie was shot, I honestly liked the acting in this movie, and I feel that each performance was well matched.

The story line is as the title suggests; IT IS Spring break. That being said, the story line is not meant to as memorable as say, a Toy Story movie. I will not go into full detail, but initially, 4 girls who are friends take a trip during their spring break. No one could have predicted it would be a spring break they would not soon forget.

Spring Breakers is not a classic by any means. It is not the best movie I have ever seen, nor is it the best Spring break movie I have seen. And normally, a movie with such gratuitous nudity, drug usuage, and lack of stellar acting, would be in my ""Movies I tend to avoid"" book. This movie is a movie that will undeniably make a person laugh at some points, make another person shake his/her head at certain points, and will probably at a few parts make you ask yourself, ""why in the world am i watching this movie?""; but, Spring Breakers will also surprise you with the tone of seriousness it presents at other parts of the movie. And despite all that, this movie still does have a meaning, and unlike some movies, it shows you exactly what it is. There is not much going for this movie as a whole, but if you are able to bring yourself to watch the whole movie, then you will see exactly what I am saying.

Again, Spring Breakers is not a ground breaking movie at all. And I completely understand why certain people dislike this movie. It is not a movie for kids it is not. But on a scale of 1 to 10, I give this movie a likeable

There is lots of killing and profanity. I think the only reason people like it is the nudity. Which is also too much of.

There was nothing sexy or funny or real like about this movie. No real like action... I couldn't even say this was drama. It was just stupid. A waist of money. A waist of time watching.",1374364800,,803,4.15483870967742
5611877,3,B00BEJL4XS,"Ok, so this movie is getting trashed a lot on the web.  I almost didn't watch it because of what some were saying, but I had to find out for myself.

Let me start by saying that this movie is NOT for your average movie go'er.  The filmogrophy is amazing, as well as the lighting and the style of the movie.  The characters have more depth than you think.  We know very little about their past, and I like this quality because the audience can build their own views and opinions of each character.  James Franco knocks his character out of the park in my opinion!  He is supposed to be creapy, and sickly feeling.  The girls do a good job too, they are the MTV/Youtube generation, and the movie isn't as far fetched as you may think.

Now, I would not buy this movie; but if you are a fan of artistic indipendent movies then give this one a try.  Its not nearly as bad as some people are saying it is.",1374364800,2,900,4.1502890173410405
5611878,1,B00BEJL4XS,"The actual plot of the movie was only about 30 minutes long. The rest was filled with repetition and bizarre camera shots. The movie took itself way too seriously and tried to pretend like it was very profound, but that just didn't work for the subject matter. The worst was James Franco's repetitive ""Spring breeeeaaaaak.... Spring breeeeeaaak forevaaaaaaa..."" line.

There are also lots of random shots of nude breasts in what can only be an attempt to prop up a horrible movie with titillation. But even this was weird and awkward. In my male opinion, it is hard to do nudity in a way that actually makes the movie worse, but this one somehow pulls it off.",1374364800,2,659,4.632478632478633

5611884,1,B00BEJL4XS,"You might like this movie if you enjoyed:
Kids (1995), Project X (2009)

Long Story Short: Four suburban college girls (Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine) who are planning on going on their spring break vacation of their life. But not all of them enjoy this trip full drugs, sex and alcohol. And when they get involved with a drug dealer named Alien (James Franco) everything changes.

My Thoughts: This was the biggest let down of the year. The trailer made it look like the audience can expect a fun, fresh, provocative portrayal of the new generation, but it is definitely not! The movie is so stupid and senseless, I didn't care the tiniest bit for the four girls, and if it was up to me, they all should have died or gone to jail for being so dumb, which would be at least some kind of decent ending. Wow, we see Jennifer Hudgens as a bad girl... wooohoooo. I couldn't care less. The characters had no depth, development, nor had they been appealing in any way. Selena Gomez was probably the only one who delivered an okay performance, because she stuck with the innocent Disney - character, but the other three just seemed ridiculous. And what was up with James Franco as Alien? How would he even consider playing such an annoying role?
This movie comes from the man who wrote the script for Kids which has been an eye-opening and very thought- provoking movie, but this movie is total bull$#!t and I think a ten year old could have written a better script.
Stylish? No!
Thought- provoking? No, but provoking my last nerves!
Fresh? Of course not!
Fun? More of a hell ride... and not in a good way!
I admire the commercial success this movie had, but if you don't want to waste your time, I would suggest to watch something else.

Fine acting and cinematography especially.  Beautiful movie.  Visual poetry.  Clever dialog; inane dialog.

James is by far the most solid thing about this movie.  Quite possibly his best acting to date.  Very believable and likeable character.  Selena Gomez was quite good too.  You're going right along with a nice arty concept and beautiful filming and bang -  you're in a cartoon beaned upside the head by the cast iron skillet of really bad dialog & ridiculous plot, thinking to yourself I'm better off thinking of this as a comic book acted out by humans.

5611890,5,B00BEJL4XS,"A transfixing blend of stylized visuals and over-the-top narrative, all presented with a tone that insists on being realism, creates this top rate criticism of modern American pop culture. By showing us exactly what we think we want, the film is able to make us question what we glamorize and why. Almost everyone will see some form of an idealized dream at some point in the film, and they'll all be flipped around and used against you to really make you think. In an interesting, meta fashion, even the cast is used to make a statement about who we are and what we desire. Teenage girls sit through this gritty art film because it has Selena Gomez in it, and parents allow it for the same reason.

At its core, Spring Breakers is just a semi-original gangster flick, but it's the social criticism overtones that really take it to the next level. That and the beautiful cinematography...raw, gritty, rough, and yet so apparently deliberate, the choice of a specific and narrow color palate (and how well they managed to stick to it) truly stands out. It seems at times cobbled together, but a careful eye reveals that this feeling is the result of carefully calculated choices.

Though the movie suffers from marketing that seems to have misplaced it and altered expectations, those that go in for a tantalizing art film won't be disappointed.",1374192000,2,1344,4.763948497854077

5611892,4,B00BEJL4XS,"Using one of the quotes from James Franco's character, this was a surprisingly good movie.  It started off like a typical spring break film, lots of bikini's, boozing and partying, but it turned a little darker than I expected.  Not that it's a bad thing.  I enjoyed seeing James Franco in cornrows and wearing a gold grill, and found him to be pretty convincing.  The rest of the cast was good as well, and Selena Gomez managed to tarnish her squeaky clean Disney persona.  A little.
While having gone to a couple spring breaks in the past, I can attest none of the partying that I witnessed ever came close to what Hollywood came up with.  The Hollywood version is interesting, but a little unbelievable at times.  All in all, it was a fun way to spend an hour and forty minutes.",1374192000,2,781,4.457746478873239

James Franco is entertaining to watch, but quickly becomes more annoying than anything.  The editing is such that you never really build any sort of interest in any of the actual characters and the story is about as thin as rice paper.  I kinda wanted all the characters to die after about an hour.  Definitely skip this one - watch it on cable if you must, but I'm not getting my $20 back and you won't get that hour and a half of your life back.  Who will like it?

5611897,4,B00BEJL4XS,"First off, this film is intended to be disturbing, and to create knee jerk reactions.  Sometimes art wants us to examine ourselves, and often, through that process, things may hit a little too close to home.  This movie is a huge commentary on the ""party"" scene and the absolute idiotic, reckless, behavior college age adults will put themselves into in the meaning of having fun.  I have no doubt parents out there will be mortified to think their teenager is on Spring Break participating in the hedonistic lifestyle choices portrayed in the movie, or more mature older adults will think back to their own shameful mistakes of their youth, which is kind of the point.  The characters are mostly one dimensional, plot is sparse, violence, nudity, drugs use, and hedonism are abundant but it's obvious all of these factors contribute to the message of the movie and Harmony Korine's comments on the the culture he is mocking.  I also love that the slow paced ""art"" film quality of this movie  is a harsh and fascinating contrast to the gratuitous excess of the violence, drug use and overly sexed party scenes.  A lot of people are not going to like this movie at all, and I actually feel sorry for someone who goes into this movie thinking they are going to see a feel good road movie about Spring Break.  This is a very dark, satirical, look at what today's youth are exposed to and what they might find themselves falling into.",1374105600,225,1430,4.669322709163347

5611906,1,B00BEJL4XS,"I watched this movie under the recommendation of a friend of mine, who kept insisting that this is the most amazing, breakthrough and momentous movie ever. It's supposed to be about two college students who end up making money and living the dream or so she told me.  I thought I was going to watch something incredible, memorable with astounding performances and a strong storyline I was wrong, dead wrong. As soon as Spring Breakers started I knew It was gonna suck and it did. Terribly.

First of all let's talk about the most basic thing a movie should have, a story. I guess you can say Spring Breakers have a story of some sort except it's very disoriented and unfocused it doesn't seem real. The Characters are ghost like, the movie keeps skipping from one scene to another without much depth or transition, we don't really know what exactly is going on. There's a lot of partying, drug abuse, nudity with vocals in the background of the characters talking about how they feel but that doesn't really add depth to them or portray them as human beings because guess what, the narration doesn't matter if the characters themselves keep acting like cold blooded robots for the entire film. I swear they're all very one dimensional and have a one track mind, The girls all they care about is alcohol, partying, drugs, money and sex. Typical of college students but they do seem to go a bit over the top with their vices. James Franco is completely boring in his role and the only thing he cares about is money, besides drugs, sex and partying. So, it's no wonder the girls and him hit it on since they have common interests but that's about it. After that it's a series of killing sprees that lack in action and drama. Boring!

The Execution is terribly bad. If it were up to me I would give this movie zero stars cause that's all it deserves really. There's nothing to be seen here. If you want nudity you can watch a porno there I said it! Not even seeing Vanessa Hudgenes and other chicks in either a bikini or topless is worth watching this train wreck. It's like the director itself didn't know what he wanted to do with this movie, he had a premise in his head but just wasn't sure how was it supposed to go so he just brought a couple of big names together, gave them tacky lines to recite, hired expensive cars with a little bit of gun and partying scenes here and there and called it a movie. Very Lazy!

In the end this movie doesn't really know what it wants to be seen as, it's not a porno although the cast is naked 99% of the time. It's not an Ocean's eleven retelling of college girls who get introduced to the world of robberies and money scheming. It's not thelma and louise. It's not an action film or a comedy or a romance. It's none of those things there's no exact gender and there's no exact story.

I would like to watch something with more depth and morals to it. Something I can relate to at least. If you're gonna do a movie then follow some guidelines at least give the characters some chance to talk and introduce them to us. Instead of having them say a couple of lines and then just party and have sex 90% of the time. There's no passion no nothing. It's all empty.

I'm sorry I just didn't like this movie. It's just a 120 minute of irresponsible college girls who have no sense and no logic whatsoever. Materialistic, superficial blondes who are only interested in having sex, binge drinking, drug abuse and oh well shooting people in order to gain money more precisely drug lords and get away with it eventually without being caught by the police or even questioned. Then You have another boring character who does nothing but repeats his lines it's like he's stuck in some time frame and he's not likable or admirable in anyway either. Morally corrupt characters with no shame. No redeeming qualities whatsoever! Except maybe the dub step soundtrack maybe that'll justify the one star I'm forced to give. And why is everyone so superficially perfect, beautiful and model like? Completely unrealistic.

5611907,1,B00BEJL4XS,"I think the positive reviews must be from people involved in this uninspired, horribly acted movie although Franco has his moments.

5611908,5,B00BEJL4XS,"Let's face it, if you're looking into this movie you probably fall into one of two categories.  You either want to watch topless partying and delight in the perversion of wholesome Disney characters, or you're just looking for a damn fine film.  I suppose you could be one of the latter and still look forward to in-your-face nudity, but let's face it, unless you frequent Girls Gone Wild releases, spending 90 minutes watching bouncing flesh is not how you try to educate your mind with eye-opening genius.  I like nudity as much as the next guy, but it can't advance a plot very well.  And I imagine 90% of the 1-Star reviews here are from people looking for mindless entertainment supported by a semi-competent story.  Instead, with Spring Breakers you get a moving picture of rich hues matching sound, pulsating beats layering words, and a half-waking hang-over of a dream.  A formula for art, yes.  A formula for popcorn and witty one-liners, no.

Harmony Korine manages to pull off a truly spectacular feet by capturing the viewer's senses and taking control of one's perception.  The only other guy that takes me for a ride as well as Korine with this film would be that of a film by David Lynch.  In fact, how I felt watching this movie was like a hard blending of Wild at Heart's weirdness, mixed with (Baz Luhrmann) Romeo + Juliet's musical cadence of action and words, and all of it boiling over into a hyper-real context a-la KIDS.  Spring Breakers does play like a dream, as many have mentioned before.  And it works (if you let it).  One element that I found to be true genius was the occasional flash of detail that presented as a mystery and at the same time a clue to the story's future.  Like a bloody finger playing the key of a piano, while the cause for that blood is only revealed a short time later.  But the anticipation, the confusion, the answer, it all leads to an exhilarating result.  I want to follow where that blood is going, find where it came from, to follow the rabbit to see what the party is.

Spring Breakers has plenty of girls, guns, clichs, and trick edits to make any summer watch list.  But the way all of these elements are presented, bombarding the viewer (and the listener), is what it's all about.  What it does for you.  Each character, each act, each plot (or lack there-of), all work seamlessly together to present you with an experience.  Don't go into this looking for a by-the-numbers entertainment device.  This truly is art.  Not the boring ""I don't get it"" no matter how much I see.  No, this is simple art.  The eyes and ears of moments strung together with feelings of excitement, enticement, enrichment.  None of it works on its own.

Definitely won't be for everyone, it's been split down the middle with most people I know. I think the big names gave some the wrong expectation, this IS a Harmony Korine film. If you've never seen his work, he is not a traditional filmmaker, which a lot of folks cannot handle. It's weird, uncomfortable, edgy, there is not a very comprehensible plot.

Few months later its releases... I go to check it out and the cash wise cashier is saying its bad to, I realize everyone has different opinions and not everyone likes the same movies so I decided to ignore their advice and rent it anyway.
I get home an pop it in with my husband and five minutes go by... I wanted to shut it off but my husband insisted we at least wait until the robbery to give it a chance...

The random stock footage of Spring break scenes.

There was little to no character development, the plot is non-existent, the dialogues is pointless. At the end of the movie I didn't feel any connection to the character. I cannot blame the actors because they had nothing to do in the whole movie (not that they were very good anyway).

5611934,3,B00BEJL4XS,"What I loved:
 The vibrant colors and use of neon accents
 All of the camera-work was phenomenal - loved all of the obscure angles
 James Franco as Alien - I bought into Franco's entire character, loved every minute of it.  From the guns to the grill, from the car to the house, Franco brings an imaginary character to life and makes you believe he really is ""living the American Dream"".  My favorite scene is where Franco is in his bedroom talking about all of his ""shit"" haha - absolutely hilarious!  Got to take my hat off for this performance.

What I hated:
 The Britney Spears scene between Franco and the three remaining girls
 Gucci Mane - I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of Gucci and I am glad that I didn't.  I am surprised that Harmony Korine gave him as big of a role as he did.  I went in thinking Gucci would be playing a rapper and have like 1 minute screen time, tops.  I was wrong.  Korine casted Gucci in a role opposite of Franco, where he is vastly out shined, due to the fact that Gucci can't speak and sounds overly scripted (when you are able to understand him)
 The ending, which may be one of the worst in the history of film cinema - I could probably write an entire paragraph on why I hated it, but I think that would just be a waste of time.

Everything else aside, this film found a way to keep me entertained throughout (up until the end).  Looking back on it now, I feel as though I almost became lost in the entire art aspect of the film and was therefore able to ignore the ""bad"" plot that so many others have pointed out.

I played the part of the History Professor in SPRING BREAKERS because the director, Harmonie Korine, needed a real history professor who could ad-lib lines of dialogue for the famous (or infamous) ""fellatio scene"" at the beginning. This scene has generated a good amount of critical attention--the NY Times devoted about 1/3 of its review to this scene alone. While I agree that the film ultimately fails on a narrative level, please understand that the intention had little to do with good storytelling. This film is a painting, a splash of colors, a riot of intense camera work, and I can attest that the director spent most of his energy in making sure the film looked right. He was obsessive in capturing every visual element he saw in his mind, prowling around the set, pushing us further--I gave my lines in at least 30 takes. I spent the day with Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Benson, and they were completely consumed by their characters, to the point that they scared me. I thought they were insane, deranged lunatics. But at the end of my scene, I said good-bye, and they came out of character and were very friendly and sweet. I gave them each a copy of the book linked above. They asked me to sign their copies, which I happily did. So SPRING BREAKERS might be a mess, but it came from a pure place and everyone was willing to take risks.

5611968,5,B00BEJL4XS,"People either love or hate this movie. If you watch it thinking that it's going to be another light and humorous take on spring break adventures, then you're going to be in for a shock. If you go into it realizing that it's more about deep cultural observation, you may be able to appreciate what's going on.

Arguably, Spring Breakers is about how people in generation Y view spring break (shoot--maybe even something deeper, like the Good Life itself). They idolize it as a time where the usual social norms are forgotten, where one can enjoy unbridled hedonism. Of course, in reality, spring break isn't always as much fun as people expect it to be, and Spring Breakers illustrates this too. For this kind of insight, I find it to be a valuable and interesting movie.

There's much more to this film than just cultural observation, but hopefully, knowing this will help you get more out of your viewing experience.

It's also worth mentioning that the film has a beautiful aesthetic. The color palate and music are wonderful; candy for eyes and ears. And James Franco's character is already a comic legend.",1373500800,7,1109,4.765625
5611969,2,B00BEJL4XS,"This is a poorly developed film. Four College girls didn't want to be stuck at college during spring break so they stuck up the Chicken Shack for csah, except for Faith (Selena Gomez) who like her name, has faith. She supplies some ridiculous first person narration and is the only character they bothered to develop and PLOT SPOILER, she exits early on a bus leaving us with a bunch of people we don't know much about, behaving badly because they can.

While on spring break, the girls get into trouble, imagine that, and they get bailed out by a scuzz-ball who looks like James Franco.

The film is interlaced with amateur style party video which consists of drinking, drugs, and boobs. I suggest if you want to watch girls on Spring Break, get those films instead, they have about as much plot sense as this one. The theme of the film ""Every Temptation has a way out"" was poorly developed also.

There is plenty to look at for both genders in the audience. I only hope that the actresses continue to do grownup roles instead of the kiddie movies. Oh yea, Franco was pretty convincing in his role too even knowing he plays a role that has been done many, many times.",1373500800,5,588,4.166666666666667

5611972,1,B00BEJL4XS,"If you ever wondered what it would look like if someone turned Girls Gone Wild into a pretentious art film then Spring Breakers is the movie for you.  Spring Breakers was being touted as the most accessible of Harmony Korine's career.  While that may be technically true, when you have the likes of Trash Humpers and Gummo on your resume that really isn't saying much.  In spite of the bikini clad babes on the cover and the presence of James Franco this is still a Harmony Korine film--so Spring Breakers is self-indulgent to the point of viewer torture, it has no plot or barely anything that could be construed as narrative, the dialogue makes everybody in the movie sound profoundly stupid and generally sounds like it was improvised or written by somebody who was stoned rather than ""written"" in the conventional sense that a real screenwriter would use and the characters are interchangeable, one-dimensional and forgettable. Only James Franco really makes any impression at all as a small-time rapper/drug dealer who thinks he's a gangsta.  It's a shame Franco wasn't this good in Oz The Great and Powerful.  Other than Franco, who is pretty amusing, Spring Breakers is empty-headed and mind-numbimgly boring, in spite of the frequent female flesh on display.  When Selena Gomez did an interview saying her mom was the biggest Harmony Korine fan in the world it made me laugh because a) of the extreme unlikelihood of that actually being true and b) it indicated that she had probably never actually seen a Harmony Korine film before, although she did look up some titles before doing the interview.  Like the James Franco character in Spring Breakers Harmony Korine is more of a hustler than anything else.  He has convinced some people that he's an artistic genius.  I don't think he has a scrap of talent, but if you are one of those people who are inclined to like Korine's films then you will undoubtedly be impressed by this one as well.  I recognize that I was hustled by the promise of bikini clad young ladies and the possibility of a fun exploitation film but when it comes to Harmony Korine--I won't be fooled again.",1373500800,2,2134,4.790190735694823

5611975,1,B00BEJL4XS,It wasn't a fun movie. It didn't really have a point and was all over the place. I truly thought it was a boring movie,1373500800,3,118,3.76
5611976,4,B00BEJL4XS,"First and foremost, I have to say this: THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR EVERYBODY!

There, I got that out there because I am going to state my opinion about this movie. I bought this movie today and I had watched this movie on its opening day in theaters and I remember enjoying the movie and was able to see what the movie was truly about.

Prior to seeing this movie, the only movie I had watched of Harmony Korine's that I had seen was ""Kids,"" and he wrote the script for that movie, but he didn't direct it. Before today, the only other movie I had seen of his was ""Gummo"" which I kind of enjoyed even though I saw that it was a really weird movie.

Now I remember what led me to seeing this movie was the amount of curiosity I had for it. I remember seeing some promotional pictures and some set pictures of the four girls in bikinis and it enticed me to see it. Then I watched the trailer on YouTube which made me realize what kind of movie this was going to be, especially after seeing who directed it. I had a feeling that it was going to be a stylish indie flick that was also a social commentary.

I didn't expect this to be a typical party movie. I knew what I was getting going into this movie. However, that isn't to say that I didn't see any flaws in it. I remember when I saw it, I somehow found James Franco's character to be a little annoying but after seeing it for the second time today, I saw that he played that role well. I also have to hand it to Selena Gomez for trying to break out of her Disney image. Too bad she left halfway through the movie.

Overall, all I can say is that if you want to watch this, you have to know what you're getting yourself into and that this was never meant to be a party comedy to begin with. Also, for fans of independent cinema, I recommend it. I felt that the movie got a little better for me after the first time I saw it. I liked it enough to buy it, now I feel that it's a little better than my first viewing of it. That's all I can say. Peace.",1373414400,18,1995,4.00251256281407

5611979,1,B00BEJL4XS,This was a waste of my life. It doesn't even deserve one star. Worst movie I have ever seen! Don't waste your time,1373414400,,114,4.0
5611980,5,B00BEJL4XS,"Spring Breakers is difficult to approach largely because of its reputation. Many critics also state that the film is so complex that it requires multiple viewings to understand, and this is likely to intimidate many viewers. But the truth is that, in spite of its surrealistic flourishes, Spring Breakers is more straight-forward than its reputation might lead you to believe.
The storyline itself is very simple. A famous director is preparing a new film, but finds himself suffering from creative block: he is obsessed by, loves, and feels unending frustration with both art and women, and his attention and ambition flies in so many different directions that he is suddenly incapable of focusing on one possibility lest he negate all others. With deadlines approaching the cast and crew descend upon him demanding information about the film-information that the director does not have because he finds himself incapable of making an artistic choice.

What makes the film interesting is the way in which Korine ultimately transforms the film as a whole into a commentary on the nature of creativity, art, mid-life crisis, and the battle of the sexes. Throughout the film, the director dreams dreams, has fantasies, and recalls his childhood-and this internal life is presented on the screen with the same sense of reality as reality itself. The staging of the various shots is unique; one is seldom aware that the characters have slipped into a dream, fantasy, or memory until one is well into the scene, and as the film progresses the lines between external life and internal thought become increasingly blurred, with Korine giving as much (if not more) importance to fantasy as to fact.

The performances and the cinematography are key to the film's success. Even when the film becomes surrealistic, fantastic, the actors perform very realistically and the cinematography presents the scene in keeping with what we understand to be the reality of the characters lives and relationships. At the same time, however, the film has a remarkably poetic quality, a visual fluidity and beauty that transforms even the most ordinary events into something slightly tinged by a dream-like quality. James Franco offers a his greatest performance here, a delicate mixture of desperation and ennui, and he is exceptionally well supported by a cast that includes Selena Gomez, Ashley Benson, and a host of other notables.

I would encourage people not to be intimidated by the film's reputation, for its content can be quickly grasped, and when critics state the film requires repeated viewing what they actually seem to mean is that the film holds up extremely well to repeated viewing; each time it is seen, one finds more and more to enjoy and to contemplate. Even so, I would be amiss if I did not point out that people who prefer a cinema of tidy plot lines and who dislike ambiguity or the necessity of interpreting content will probably dislike 8  a great deal; if you are uncertain in your taste on these points you would do well to rent or borrow the film before making a purchase. For all others: strongly, strongly recommended.",1373414400,8,3127,5.019267822736031

5611985,5,B00BEJL4XS,"Tape loop music has been around for decades, everyone from Bowie to the Beatles has used it. Combine that with statements Harmony has made such as:

""After 100 years, films should be getting really complicated. The novel has been reborn about 400 times, but it's like cinema is stuck in the birth canal.""

So he went and presented a narrative in a very well-distributed major motion picture in tape loop fashion. Yes, it does repeat itself, that's what tape loops do, they are designed to pull the listener into a dream or drone-like state, in fact sometimes the music itself is even called ""drone music"". Spring Breakers is a massive success to this end, it absolutely gives the viewer the same drone or dreamlike state that lulls them into the narrative. While what he presents in the loops isn't really the point, they are worth noting, but the fact he even pulled it off is remarkable. I strongly suggest everyone read Harmony's interviews about this, there's seriously a massive amount of details going on that are difficult to catch but once they are pointed out, they are astounding to watch in action.

You can also watch the film for the best performances ever from every actor involved, James Franco especially. His creep-thug ""Alien"" is always in the moment and extremely real. One thing I noticed though, is that if you removed the entire cast and replaced them with nobodies, you would still have the same movie, and it would be more ""typical"" Harmony. The casting of the Disney chicks is akin to self-trolling, he knew he'd get millions of people who would hate this film to watch it because their superfans have no choice. Or maybe there are a few cool Selena Gomez fans who would get how remarkably deep this film is and would get exposed to Korine's back catalogue and explore even further into the people that influenced him, like Werner Herzog, Fellini and all the rest.

Spring Breakers is one of my favorite films ever. Mostly because every time I've seen it (4 times in theaters, once on a plane) I've gotten something completely different from it. It's a prism of sorts, there's a lot of different ways you can even watch it, like paying attention to whats being looped/repeated, the acting, the societal commentary, the overall fever-dreamlike state the film is in and whatever else comes to find.

If watching on a movie night, I'd pair it with Enter The Void for a very dreamy, modern avant garde, surrealist adventure in film. It's trippy, mane.",1373414400,10,2472,4.752913752913753

You came to watch a movie about them on spring break, which includes partying, drugs, girls, along with other mishaps. Also keep in mind, you are watching a movie directed by Harmony Korine, who has more of a different style and approach. Mainly, most of ones I've come across that complained about this movie are females, probably because naked chicks and partying doesn't seem to interest them.

5611990,1,B00BEJL4XS,"First 20 minutes was INCREDIBLY difficult to get through. No idea what was going on. Then you think it's going to pick up and make sense... but then it still just repeats something over and over again like at the beginning. I eventually was able to be amused by it because I thought they were trying to make fun of themselves... they weren't. James Franco played the same key on a piano over and over again for like 10 minutes almost sort of singing? I learned they weren't making fun of themselves and I felt ashamed for ever being amused by this movie. I got sick of overly sexual girl thrusting at the camera all the time. If you make it past the first 30 minutes you'll probably make it through the rest of the movie, but only because you're confused, too lazy to turn it off, and/or too hopeful that no movie could possibly continue to suck as bad as it was.

WTF was with the ending. That's what made me realize they thought that those girls were actually ""hardcore"" and ""totally cool"" instead of just dirty dumb sluts with f'd up brains.

Overall, however, this film limps along slowly and leaves the viewer perplexed about whether it could actually be as shallow as it is.

Franco can more or less sell anything, but the disney girls have a long way to go before they can sell being felons.  If you're curious about Korine's portfolio, check out GUMMO or KIDS.

The movie is such a mind blowing experience that you can't stop watching it no matter what. James Franco was the best actor of this movie, his talent is undeniable and it's not absent in this movie.

Next ensues endless scenes of jocks and skanks partying with cheesy phone calls home a la diary style - ""Grandma, this is the best place on Earth... we found ourselves here..."", etc., etc. They then meet some white trash guy, two of the girls remember they have school and aren't digging hanging on the jock of the type of guy mommy and daddy always warned them about and go home. They rob other idiots on spring break while wearing pink masks and bikinis. All this ""story"" culminates in the the two remaining skanks going after a drug dealer that lasts about five minutes and ends. There is a silly/stupid scene where they are pool-side while Mr. White Trash sings a cheesy song - I suppose trying to fail at being artistic and making some sort of commentary that's over (well, under really) my head.

That's your plot, and it pretty much summarizes the entire movie. The movie is so lacking that they had to put in four hot girls just to get anyone to watch it.

So I went to see it..and I was blown away. Harmony Korine take on good girl gone bad was something I have never seen before. These four girls, the main characters, are from a small town, going to a small college, in a remotely small area. All of these girls want out; they want fun. Most of these girls want an adventure, I say some because Selena was the timid one of the group, to the extreme. They don't just want parties with frat boys and girls drinking the night away, they want drugs, sex, and violence. Everything that modern society would consider bad they want, which is where James Franco's character, Alien, comes in. This movie was explicit and raw. I say raw because in some scenes the emotions and interactions between actors seemed real, and I don't think that the scenes of spring breakers flashing boobs in such a massive number was fully pre-planned in the movie as well. There is repetition in the movie as well that simulates a hypnotic felling, as you see delusional girls go about their life in a childlike manner of forever having ""fun"" as each girl learns, the hard way, about the choices they made like a domino effect. I loved this movie in its entirety and that is my opinion. This is honestly either a love it or hate it movie. And the only thing I can say is to see the movie yourself and see if you like it because you might love it despite all the discouraging review you hear from friends or online, or you might hate it despite all the positive critics review.

5612023,4,B00BEJL4XS,"Upon first impression, Spring Breakers will,  to its detriment, always appear to be little more than a tasteless exploitation of its cast of overly willing ex-Disney channel teens. Which is a shame as the film - at very least - attempts to achieve at least some level of profound introspection and commentary.

The film can best be described as a present day take on A Clockwork Orange; exaggerating and parodying the flaws of our American youth, highlighting the all too realistic melding of childish ignorance and a world of very real and very ugly landscapeof crime, violence and sex.

Despite his lofty aspirations, to be perfectly honest, writer/director Haromy Korine simply doesn't appear to have the talent or skill to make the most of his story, and while the concept is consistently strong, and his desire to prove his overall point is always evident, his script lacks the ingenuity and vigor to make a name for itself as a film people will talk about for years to come.

Still, there is plenty to like about the film as well. While obviously not the best writer in the business, Korine most certainly is an extremely skilled and intelligent director, and through his knowledge of the art, he's able to turn his film into an eery yet beauty dreamscape. Through insightful editing and use of music and sound, the movie always maintains an extremely lucid and serene tone, as if nothing we're seeing is reality, but is rather the warped and quite obviously untrue perception of our main characters.

The creation of this atmosphere lends itself greatly to the overall characterization of its characters and girls who are most definitely quite wholly vapid and obnoxious are, at least, humanized and we can, at least, begin to understand their motivations and actions.
Which, again, is a very intelligent method of characterization and expression of theme. A lesser director could have easily fallen into the trap of attempting to detail his thematic intent through heavy handed dialogue or entirely unlikeable characters, but Korine avoids those usual pitfalls.

The other consistently noticeable and impressive aspects of the film is its cinematography and color palette. I can't say it enough, it's a beautifully shot film. Maybe not one of the best I've ever seen, but Korine's use of the bright neons of beachwear and nightlife combined with Florida's naturally gorgeous geography make for an impressing melding of the artificial and vibrant and the serene and subdued.

In terms of the cast, it's only Gomez and Franco who turn in memorable performances. Gomez's strength comes from her seemingly natural born innocence and childlike moral fortitude, with one tear-filled scene acting as a crescendo for her entire performance. It won't win any Oscars, but it's solid nevertheless. For Franco, his ability to so drastically morph and envelop himself into his role as a south Florida ganger wannabe is incredible. Again, he maintains a constant balance of tongue-in-cheek humor and underlying condemnation of the real life people and culture he mimics in the film.

Overall, Spring Breakers is not a movie for everyone. If you're paramount concern with a film is deft scripting and likable characters, Spring Breakers will probably come off as rather wholly loathsome. But if you're like me, and can appreciate the beauty of the visual, thematic, and philosophical art of filmmaking, as well appreciate the subtle but undeniable parody of the entire production, it might very well be a film you'll want to add to your collection.",1372550400,2,3541,5.072164948453608

5612037,1,B00BEJL4XS,"Wow....
Where do I begin with this one. Spring breakers is a movie I stumbled upon recently. Seemed like it had a solid cast (we all know James Franco can really pull of some sleeper hits) but I have to admit I was a little hesitant with the ""Disney"" cast (2 MAJOR Disney stars, from the same generation of Disney hits, together in a movie like this....HARDLY a coincidence) Now you can look at my profile here, I have been a member of amazon since its first year! and I hardly EVER write reviews, but I thought this one definitely deserved my two cents. This movie is what you would expect from someone who sits at home in a nice big wealthy home watching MTV and listening to Eminem if they were to imagine and FANTASIZE what the underbelly of society is really like?. Hence this movie, which make no mistake, is garbage, plain and simple. and unfortunalty even james franco's excellent acting cant even save this one. Unless you grew up on Disney, I'd stay away from this one. There is not ONE ounce of reality in this WHATSOEVER. Now believe me, Its not that I look for reality in a movie starring little Disney princesses trying to play gangster when the only ""hood"" they know of is the one that their ""Help"" is from. But this one just goes to far. It tries (and miserably fails) to be something daring, and smart. But when someone who has no idea what these lifestyles are really like, it REALLY REALLY REALLY shows. I wouldn't be surprised if the only black man Harmony ever saw was on T.V. but just in case you think im being harsh, here is the plot points.

Four bored WELL-OFF college girls (damn right they are well off, THEY ARE TEENAGERS IN COLLEGE!!!) want to go on a trip. They put their money together and come up 100 dollars short. so they decide they want to take a mallet and rob a fast food restaurant  so these four 3 foot, 80 pound little teenage girls who can afford a 4 year education, but cant seem to come up with 100 dollars, decide to go full on felon and run into this chicken shack,mallet in hand and scare everyone into giving up their money, which actually works (god knows how imtimidating those teenage white girls are)and what do they need this money for...? a spring break trip. so they end up in florida, (I think its florida? or the frontlines of Iraq??) where every day is literally a stage four riot of kids sniffing cocaine. then they get locked up, which is surprising in itself considering how out of control everything in florida is according to this directors viewpoint. Next they meet a white boy who thinks he's a gangster, except unlike every other wanna-be out there, this one actually is. She drives that point home with how he takes these girls to a party and all of us ""brothers"" are practically BOWING to him,(because GOD knows all of us colored folk, myself included, are in the hood just WAITING for a white man to come along and take over) then overnight the girls decide they are gangster too, and just like that, they are. I mean FULL on gangster. I hate to put it like that, but that's what it is? This director has NO idea about the subject she is exploring here, so she goes off the deep end. Just as she did with kids. Every child a whore, drug addled, monster who beats on older people. But considering she chose a bunch of pop girls to play these parts, im sure they assumed that's how it is as well. Its trash from start to finish. If you want to sit here and talk about its symbolism, and its underlying meaning, go right ahead. This movie has been flopping around like a fish for two years now, so at least I can rest easy knowing the director who is responsible for this bold LIE will never sit behind a camera again!",1372118400,15,3685,4.370262390670554

After I saw the movie one of my friends told me how they don't have spring break in other countries - I never even really thought about this. Spring Breakers is almost making fun of the Generation X type movies. It's revealing how stupid and dumbed down kids are these days, how disturbing and disgusting the reality of spring break is. People who don't like it may claim it was stupid and unrealistic, and as a fan of the movie, I sort of agree with them. This movie was partially stupid and unrealistic, but that's the point, and that's what makes it smart. It shows how stupid this generation is. Two young girls in neon bikinis shoot a bunch of experienced thugs and don't get shot - of course it's unrealistic, half the movie is very gritty and realistic, and then there are the dream-like sequences towards the end.

5612042,4,B00BEJL4XS,"Spring Breakers is a film written and directed by Harmony Korine, the controversial director of the acclaimed movie Kids. If you've seen and liked Kids, you'll probably enjoy Spring Breakers because you know exactly what you're about to get into. If you haven't however, this experience could be either hit or miss.

So here's a brief plot summary to entice those who aren't really sure what the movie will be about, since the trailer doesn't exactly tell you anything.

Four girls who are best friends and attend the same college, Faith (Gomez), Brit (Benson), Candy (Hudgens) and Cotty (Korine), want to go down to Florida for their spring break vacation. After saving up all year, the girls only manage to pull together a little over a hundred dollars (which is kind of sad, they've been saving all year, and between the four of them, that's all they have?).

So, the girl's decide that there's only one way to get what they want: no, it's not whoring out their bodies, it's robbing the local chicken shack (what were you thinking, weirdo)! Faith, who actually has faith and is the voice of reason/Christian among this group of misfits sparingly disapproves, but in the end decides that Miami is bigger than Jesus.

And thus, our scene is set. The girls party up in Florida during their week of Spring Break (which seems more like a month), and eventually hook up with an up and coming rapper/entrepreneur, Alien (Franco). Alien shows the girl's his way of life, and the rest is history.

Personally, I loved this film. I saw it twice in the theaters because I genuinely thought it was a good movie because I took it for what it was. Depending on how you go into the film will leave you either disgusted or wanting more. If you go into this movie with the intentions of seeing a very coming of age film where four girls go crazy and eventually find the error of their ways, and expect it to be a drama with a hint of Nicolas Spark romance intertwined, you're not going to like it.

If you take the movie for what it really is, a movie that enjoys making fun of itself, and despite it's crudity, is actually well written, well directed, and just ""real,"" then you should have no problems.

In short, don't watch this movie if you're expecting an oscar-nominated tale and the meaning to life. Just watch it for fun, that's what it is for. It's a fun film, and is meant to be as goofy as it comes off as.

I will be picking up this movie as soon as it comes out on BluRay, and I will edit this post a bit more just to toss in some comments about the special features, if there's a need to.

Until then remember,

5612043,5,B00BEJL4XS,"I am probably just as surprised as you are: Spring Breakers is actually a really good movie.

It follows a deceptively simple plot, of a Good Girl and her longtime friends, three Bad Girls, who are bored in their university setting and are desperate for any kind of change. Their solution is to go to Florida for a wild and unforgettable Spring Break. Even after saving money for months, they are unable to afford this excursion, prompting the Bad Girls to rob a local eatery.

The bad behavior continues at the Spring Break resort town, eventually landing them in a local jail and involved in a greater crime ring. One of the drug lords is played to over-the-top perfection by James Franco, who delivers a chilling yet comical portrayal.

The story is told with an engaging intensity unique to films of this genre; we've seen plenty of movies like this before, of young girls gone wild, so the direction doesn't waste time on the narrative. What's interesting is how the story is told, through lucid montages flashing around through time and space, often with disembodied voice-overs describing the sequence we are viewing, as told by characters before or after the incident actually takes place.

Take one scene, for instance: We know the girls are going to get into trouble. We knew that from the movie poster. So for the scene in which they get arrested, we get flashes of the different girls in police cars with red and blue lights shining on their faces; then we return back to the incident in which they get arrested. This constant back-and-forth makes this movie, whose narrative is otherwise simple, consistently compelling.

But it's not just the storytelling that makes Spring Breakers a fascinating work, but the story and theme itself. Simple, yes, but also profound. This is a twisted representation of the American dream, almost a contemporary remake of Where the Boys Are, of young women rejecting mainstream society and opt to make a life for themselves in any way they can. The plays of power move so instantaneously and so driven by individual initiative, that one can't watch without the unsettling feeling that power, and perceptions of it, are so fluid.

On its surface, Spring Breakers is a sticky, neon trip of house music and marijuana smoke but at its heart (or lack of one), it is a disturbing and revealing look at what we value in our American life, and how far we will go to achieve it.",1369440000,5,2416,4.767942583732057

The cinematographer did ENTER THE VOID and you can definitely tell in the 3rd act of the film, as everything just becomes a hazy sequence of slo-mo and glowing neon. Personally, I saw this as a middle finger to the current eMpTyV generation. Obviously, the audience got none of that, though they certainly proved their lack of attention spans. The raunch has been over-hyped. It's still an R-rated movie and beyond a decent amount of breasts and drug use, it's nothing you can't see on TV. But the real raunch is in the attitude, the way the camera leers at the teen girls just goofing off. I think if you appreciated a movie like DRIVE, you'd probably dig this, too. It certainly isn't a teen spring break comedy a la National Lampoon. It's full of long, slow shots and voice-overs of narcissistic teens thinking they are being deep, which is pretty hilarious, kind of mocking the very audience who may well be watching.",1369094400,2,1085,4.68586387434555
5612045,5,B00BEJL4XS,"This film is already a post-postmodern classic. A great artistic success for one of the most interesting artists of our time. The film has already made back its budget about six times over (almost unheard of when it comes to avantgarde art) and this dvd/blu-ray is selling really well.

My first reaction to the experience of seeing ""Spring Breakers"" was one of absolute elation, as if I was witnessing an extraordinary piece of transcendental art. The film feels somehow beyond the jumbled postmodern dichotomy of good/bad or high/low - rather - it reads like some sort of hyper-simulacrum that reflects contemporary culture in an extremely complex manner. The themes of the film are similar to what Korine has touched upon before: mundane reality vs. an intense ""heightened"" or elevated existence beyond good or evil, where reality is replaced by a (or the) dream that goes on forever and ever. But in ""Spring Breakers"" those themes are presented in more dimensions than in for example ""Mister Lonely"" or ""Trash Humpers"". ""Spring Breakers"" also include themes that are pro-feminist and anti-racist in a more explicit fashion than any of Korines previous works.

The liquid colorful cinematography is amazing throughout, though some scenes especially stand out, for example the robbery and the montage that goes along with Britney Spears ""Everytime"", spectacular examples of great art. There is a method of repetition that runs through the film (which I'm sure will annoy quite a few people), dialogue is repeated, scenes are repeated, images are repeated, the sound of a gun being loaded (used brilliantly as poetic punctuation) is repeated - every time eschewing the original meaning of said occurrence - thereby adding another level of analytical value and another point to the already complex sentiments. It really speaks volumes of contemporary culture where the ""dreams"" of the populace is nothing but representation and spectacle in its purest form. With ""Spring Breakers"" Korine has really managed to reflect, deconstruct and subvert (the way the great fun of it also becomes the grim menace of it, I find genuinely subversive) what some might see as banal popular culture and escapism and turn it into radical poetic hyper-cinema, and I truly found that masterful. I'm particularly impressed with some of the levels of performative marginality that retained veritable counterdiscoursal subversive potential towards all matters of the hegemonical cultural powers that be.

I do think this film will appeal mainly to fans of arthouse exploitation or experimental genre-cinema, but I'm sure some of the mainstream audience will be taken with it as well. One does however need to put some genuine thought into the act of witnessing the subversive artistry on display to appreciate the depth in the seemingly superficiality of the film. In any way I'm sure it will remain a classic artistic statement regarding the zeitgeist of 2013. A must-own dvd/blu-ray!",1368576000,2,2962,5.231578947368421
5612046,4,B00BEJL4XS,"There's no need to beat around the bush with this review - because this day has been on the calendar for quite some time.  Spring Breakers, a film that has been making waves in the land of film festivals for the last few months, has finally been released nationwide.  Based on the early reviews (because it's hard not to hear about a controversial locomotive heading your way), Spring Breakers is a film destined to illicit a response (good or bad) from anyone that views it.  For better or worse, Harmony Korine has another controversial picture on his hands (see Kids) depicting teens doing drugs, having sex, and essentially any other activity college kids could possibly do over spring break.  Only in this film, Korine's college kids are none other than some of Hollywood's squeaky clean young actresses - who will, by the time the film ends, shed their spotless image.

Directed by Harmony Korine (Kids), Spring Breakers is a story about four college girls that make the trip to Florida for spring break.  Prior to making the trip, Candy (Vanessa Hudgens), Brit (Ashley Benson), and Cotty (Rachel Korine, the director's wife) rob a diner in order to have enough money to make the trip - prior to meeting up with their church-goer friend, Faith (Selena Gomez).  Once in Florida, too much partying with drugs and alcohol lands the girls in jail, only to be randomly bailed out by Alien (James Franco), a local rap artist/drug dealer.  Alien uses his money and power to impress the impressionable girls, and it eventually pulls the girls into Aliens way of life - climaxing in a face-off against another local drug dealer, Big Arch (Gucci Mane).

As far as the content of the film goes, Spring Breakers pushes the envelope, and then it pushes it even more with its sexist and racist character portrayals (but we won't get into that here)  - which oddly enough didn't earn itself an NC-17 rating.  The film begins with spring breakers partying on the beach, most of which are college co-eds in all their topless glory - quickly setting the mood for this film.  The consistency of sex and drug use over the course of the film is typical of Harmony Korine's style of film-making, but it's still a bit shocking if you've never seen his previous work.  There are plenty of hippie-ish drug induced segments, not to mention a threesome pool scene that will make Wild Things look tame and innocent - which also happens to be the scene that will completely shatter the spotless images of former Disney star Vanessa Hudgens and Pretty Little Liars star Ashley Benson.

Let's be honest, this film caters to teens and young adults - most of whom will show up to theaters looking to see Selena Gomez parade around in a bikini.  If that's what you're after, then you'll enjoy the film, but her character adds little more to the film, other than to keep her squeaky clean Hollywood image intact.  James Franco, on the other hand, is the showstopper in this film.  From the moment he hits the screen, corn rolls and all, he's nothing short of sublime.  He portrays a quirky, odd individual - and at first, you'll have to do a double take to make sure that's really James Franco.  He displays a complete confidence in this role, providing a slew of memorable moments in which his too odd, too funny gangster rap character will completely win you over and have you rooting for his success.

To say Spring Breakers is a twisted, unorthodox film would be an understatement.  One minute these four girls are disappointed about not having enough money to make the trip down south for spring break, and the next thing you know they're randomly robbing a diner.  There are scenes in which the film feels very cartoon-ish, and then there are scenes that are so dramatically fulfilling that at certain points it feels like two different films are mixed into one.  For instance, in the diner robbery scene, these girls put a dramatic 180 degree spin on their characters by verbally assaulting random diner customers as they rob them (with a fake gun and sledge hammer), and the next thing you know they're sitting outside singing Britney Spears at the top of their lungs.  While we're on the subject of Britney, the girls bellow a few of her tunes over the course of the film - one of which is in a rather humorous scene helmed by James Franco's character as he plays the piano, while the girls sing.  And - oddly enough, it works perfectly for the film.

In the end, Spring Breakers is a mind-blowing experience with its share of ups and downs.  With sheer certainty, you'll either love this film or hate it with the fiery passion of a million sultry suns.  If you look past the abundance of drugs, sex, and other offensive content, you will see a film that aims to tell a dramatic story about loyalty, and the meaning of a life changing experience.  Without a doubt, Spring Breakers has cult classic written all over it.

GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD! This was an ART film! I commend this movie, James Franco's performance as Alien, the color scheme, the plot twist, everything about this film was original and set new standards for the exploitation film. If you can't handle this movie, NOBODY CARES",1367452800,3,472,4.9125
5612048,5,B00BEJL4XS,"Spring Breakers really opens your eyes and mind through an ensemble of characters, going through and causing emotionally scarring situations. The four main girls are hard partiers, but however far in danger they may get, they are the ""unstoppable."" As ANY rebellious or risk taking teen on spring break would feel. Every character brings their own insight on just how fun or dangerous it is to put trust into people who may have bad intentions. harmony is one strange dude, to say the least, but what he tried to do here is absolutely brilliant.

I believe no one but Korine himself and a few of his closest friends and family will know exactly what he was trying to prove by this film. It's an intense film. It's scary. It's also funny at times. However, it is one of those movies when the director intentionally tries to create a horrific scene, but show it in a humorous way. This is when movie-goers in the theaters laugh at an emotionally heart-wrenching scene. This could be a little disturbing in certain contexts. This movie is very dark and not for children. Unless the children are fearless.

I recommend seeing this movie. The music fits perfect with the theme of the film, although gave me a headache...",1366329600,6,1215,4.699530516431925
5612049,4,B00BEJL4XS,"I suspect that young people old enough to see this movie, thinking it was another ""Project X"" or something like it, were in for a surprise.  Sure the movie starts out with all the ""B's"", i.e. booze, beer, bongs, babes and boobs.  And make no mistake, there are plenty to each to go around. But there some shockers on the way.

The story has 4 extremely bored small town coeds focused on getting to the sugary beaches of St. Petersburg, Florida.  Running short of cash, three of the girls (Vanessa Hudgens, Rachel Korine - wife of director Harmony Korine - and Ashley Benson) decide to knock over the local Chicken Shack.  It works and later they reunite with the fourth girl, Faith (Selena Gomez) whose name is consistent with her religion.  Off they go and when they get there, its party hardy with Faith pulling back a bit and Cotty (Korine) at the other extreme.

In a night of debauchery, the cops haul the young cuties in to the calaboose still in their bikinis.  An observer from the beach scene earlier, ""Alien"" (James Franco) bails the ladies from the grips of the man.  Franco in full-on crazy complete with cornrows, a grill and a pimped out Z-28 Camero is quite the character.  Raised in the hood, he's all that, just white.  He's also trouble, but the visceral excitement he brings is an aphrodisiac to 3 of the girls.  Faith, the early focus of Alien's interest has the good sense to head back home.

Sometimes ultra-violent, always sexy, often comedic and usually campy, ""Spring Breakers"" takes a Tarantino-like turn that takes 2 of the more frisky gals (Candy and Brit) into new territory.  Certainly not for everyone, I found the movie exhilarating, highly entertaining and way out of the mainstream.",1365292800,178,1716,4.695652173913044
