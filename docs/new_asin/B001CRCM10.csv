*Superman: The Movie is definitely the best movie about the caped crusader hero as it stands still. It combines drama,humor,tension and suspense in one complete package. Aside from that,the casting was perfect from Marlon Brando as Jor-El,Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor,Margot Kidder as Lois Lane and of course,Christopher Reeve ,who turned out an iconic performance as the both the bumbling Clark Kent and the hero,Superman. This film has the themes of Superman's character,humanity and his vulnerability.

*Superman II is a great follow-up to the first film considering that it retains all the delightful characteristics that the first movie has like adventure,tension,suspense and humor. Also,this one goes deeper into the love story between Superman and Lois Lane as well as the sacrifices each one is willing to go forward into their relationship; and the battle between Superman and the Supervillains.

*Superman III may have turned more into a slapstick comedy especially with comic Richard Pryor's presence. It definitely has changed its direction but nevertheless,it still manages to provide entertainment with the Clark Kent returning to Smallville and having a new love interest in Lana Lang and witnessing a great performance from Christopher Reeve,who proved himself to be have great acting skills when portraying the good and evil Superman.

*Superman IV:The Quest For Peace could probably the least interesting film that Christopher Reeve has done as Superman but nevertheless,it still has great themes about World Peace.

This collection is worthy of purchase for there is no other actor that played Superman and Clark Kent than the late actor until today. Added to that,it will definitely be appreciated by people who speak Spanish fluently in many countries like Spain,Mexico,Puerto Rico and majority of the countries in South America.",1414108800,,1982,5.44299674267101
