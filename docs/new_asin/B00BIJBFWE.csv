8569035,4,B00BIJBFWE,"I don't think a majority of even those that consider themselves experts know much about Terri Hooley or the story of Punk Rock during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The really interesting part of the story is that it is in a large part about those that were stuck in the middle and how they coped.

Of course the driving force of the film is his drive to get the music around him out to the world and the self destructive effect that drive had.",1398124800,,447,4.258823529411765
8569036,5,B00BIJBFWE,"For those of us of a certain age, this movie brings back a lot of memories. But there is more to it.

This is the story of Terri Hooley and his Good Vibrations record shop in Belfast, which became the home of Northern Ireland's punk scene in the late 1970's, as well as the first record label for many of its bands. While, being a Yank and having  never set foot in Ireland, North or Republic (as yet, still hoping), I remember the bands and the music.

Of course, if it were only for the nostalgia, then the CBGB's movie might have been good. Thankfully, what we have here is a wonderful story with engaging (and often maddening) characters, marvelous performances and direction and editing that capture the anarchic sense of both fun and danger that great rock n roll can inspire. Set down plop in the middle of the Troubles, fun and danger are both constant presences here, along with a look at the way that music can build bridges in the damnedest of places.

I don't know enough of the actual, historical particulars to know how faithful this story is to real life, but then again, I don't care. The movie works as a movie and I suspect that the veracity is pretty close. I was also pleased with the way the filmmakers refused to tack on, or weave in, a happy ending, letting the climax be bittersweet the way life usually is. Hooley is presented warts and all, and if the character behaves badly in some (important) parts of his life, in others he shows a quiet nobility.

The soundtrack is terrific and primarily features the bands the movie portrays (Rudi, the Outcasts, the magnificent Undertones' magnificent Teenage Kicks - still one of the greatest singles in r n r history).

You don't have to have been there, nor do you have to be the right age, to find this a wonderfully moving, witty and in many ways joyous film. Go to it.",1395964800,5,1841,4.464285714285714
8569037,5,B00BIJBFWE,"This tells part of the story of the Northern Irish music legend that is Terri Hooley. He grew up in Belfast at a time before the troubles and when that dark period came he found himself in the middle of people he considered to be friends, but now they divided themselves along religious lines and not on political, social and musical lines that had been so invigorating.

He though is one of lifes optimists and so as the bombs go off and the sectarian violence becomes the norm on the ever emptying streets he wants to bring music to the benighted people of Belfast and what starts out as a venture into reggae, via his record shop,  all gets turned around when one night he is drawn to a gig to see Rudi and the Outcasts playing to a packed house. He does what any sensible, red blooded male would do; he gets drunk, does some pogoing and then signs the band!

We then follow him on his ups and downs as he gets involved with launching The Undertones, his marital woes and being on the road as well as the financial problems, the music industries fickleness and the sheer enthusiasm of the kids for this new music. Along the way we get a load of laughs a few tears and an appearance by the greatest DJ of all time ever  John Peel.

I completely loved this; it is well acted, the period detail is really good  some of the wigs are a bit obvious -, but so what. Starring Richard Dormer as Hooley who has been in Game of Thrones and My Boy Jack  he puts in a fine performance helped along by the lovely Jodie Whitaker as Ruth his long suffering wife. Dylan Moran puts in a cameo too and great support from the likes of Adrian Dunbar (My left foot and The crying game) who is massively under rated and always reliable and the brilliant Liam Cunningham (Game of thrones and The wind that shakes the barley). This is how I remember that part of punk and it is great to have some new life breathed back into some of these old songs.  This is one that will give you more on subsequent viewings and I can absolutely recommend.",1388361600,4,2019,4.267015706806283
8569038,5,B00BIJBFWE,"Good Vibrations is not a hilarious ""laugh out loud"" movie as proclaimed. It is however, witty, energetic and triumphant, set to a background of conflict and unrest, as the police, army and punks fought on the streets at every opportunity [...]",1382313600,2,243,4.951219512195122
