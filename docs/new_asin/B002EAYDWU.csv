8367124,2,B002EAYDWU,"If you like afican adventure, forget this one it feels like it was shot on a backlot, the animal scenes were stock footage straight form King Solomans Mines, with a very predictable storyline. A good cast wasted on a D grade movie.
Save your money",1376524800,,247,4.511111111111111
8367125,1,B002EAYDWU,"While there is some ""campy"" value in seeing Frankie Avalon in a safari pic .... the failings far out weigh any other value the film may have.

This pic includes some actual footage shot in Africa, and the rules about filming animals were much different then.  This film contains actual footage of an Elephant being shot in the head and killed.

Do NOT buy this movie if you like animals.  The scenes will stay with you.  Very disturbing.",1311206400,2,437,4.551282051282051
