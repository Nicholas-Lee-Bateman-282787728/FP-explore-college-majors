I initially gained interest in the film after reading about Scott's love for Townes Van Zandt, one of my favorite, and probably the best singer songwriters ever.  I was immediately biased and knew that someone that proclaims Townes as an influence, has to have some skill!  And fail did he not!

I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of Believe you me.  The lead actors were charming, and very fresh, not the typical over the top stuff we normally see.  I loved the small town vibe.  Scott captured this mentality in every shot, location, and character.

With all this being said, hands down, what makes the film is the writing.  The script is unique/interesting/different- and that is hard to do these days.  A dark story, that has hilarious moments- I especially love the scene in which (don't want to spoil it for you) "" a lot of wine is consumed.""

I can't wait to see any future work from Scott, as well as the actors.  I highly reccommend this film to anyone that loves a good original story told via the camera.",1334620800,2,1120,4.545
8608207,4,B007TNGR4O,"A man takes up work at a suicide hotline after the untimely death of his brother and discovers a woman with a secret. With a whimsically jaded performance from Matt Olsen, Believe You Me has moments that will have you laughing at the banality of life. Dark & funny, the first film from Scott Honea is not one to be missed.",1334534400,2,322,4.295081967213115
