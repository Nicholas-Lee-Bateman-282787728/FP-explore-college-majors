8269905,5,B0018KMBI0,"This is a bargain double DVD set featuring two of Mae West's most classic movie offerings.

Mae West's very first starring vehicle in 1933, SHE DONE HIM WRONG (based on her Broadway play ""Diamond Lil""), is still one of her all-time best. In it, she co-stars with a very young and boyish Cary Grant, and while their physical pairing doesn't entirely sit well, their sizzling chemistry more than compensates.

Mae West is Lady Lou, the reigning singing star of the Bowery. Although she's wooed and adored by just about every man that crosses her path, Lou wants the unattainable: Captain Cummings (Cary Grant), the local mission director. In a plot overflowing with jailed former lovers, stolen diamonds and a Barbary Coast white slavery outfit, will Lou land her handsome Captain? Watch and find out...

In SHE DONE HIM WRONG, Mae West cemented the archetypal character she'd more or less reprise in all of her subsequent movies. Cary Grant perfectly pairs her, and the two would be reunited in West's next movie, ""I'm No Angel"" (released later the same year), an even bigger hit which helped pull Universal Studios out of it's financial reverses.

Mae West sings ""A Guy What Takes His Time"", ""She Done Him Wrong"", ""Frankie & Johnny"", and ""Easy Rider"". The supporting cast includes Rochelle Hudson, Owen Moore, Gilbert Roland, Noah Beery, David Landau, and Rafaela Ottiano.

MY LITTLE CHICKADEE paired the two great anarchic comedians of the 1930's, Mae West and W.C. Fields, for their one and only co-starring appearance. By all accounts they couldn't stand each other, but you'll get no impression of hostility while watching this breezy, infectious western comedy.

Flower Belle Lee (Mae West) is run out of town after she's seen kissing a masked bandit in her bedroom. On the train bound for the wild west city of Greasewood, she meets Cuthbert Twillie (W.C. Fields), a fast-talking con man. She brings a new meaning to the term ""shotgun wedding"", when, after an action-packed Indian attack, she manages to bribe a phoney minister and marry Twillie, so she can get her hands on his carpetbag stuffed with cash--later revealed to be as fake as the man carrying it! Once in Greasewood City, Flower Belle dumps her 'husband' like a sackful of potatoes, but Twillie plugs away, determined to impress his beautiful bride using any means he can...

It's not Mae West's finest hour, but MY LITTLE CHICKADEE is inexplicably one of her most popular titles. West and Fields each had screenwriting credit, and the script has lots of comic schtick so both can shine. But when they come together, it's completely charming (especially during the Indian attack, and that great scene with the goat). W.C. Fields was a compulsive drinker and would often turn up on the set with foul-smelling breath, much to the annoyance of Mae West, who refused to be subject to his drinking habit on any level. You'll notice that Fields and West never actually get very close at all in the movie. That's the reason. Mae looks a treat in her Vera West-designed costumes, and button-nosed W.C. Fields has lots of physical comedy gags.

Mae West sings ""Willie of the Valley"". The supporting cast includes Margaret Hamilton, Dick Foran, Joseph Calleia, Donald Meek, Ruth Donnelly, and Fuzzy Knight.

There are no extras but the quality of the prints are first-class.  Recommended.",1241913600,,3469,5.158362989323844
