59789,4,0783227361,"Filed in 1993, it's American Graffiti in 1976 rather than 1963, but actually better than American Graffiti.

Unrealistic portrayal of a small town Texas high school in May 1976 because of at least the following:  no one would have been allowed in school wearing a t-shirt showing a marijuana leaf, no student could have openly and brazenly smoked pot in a school or on school property, and no teacher could have openly denounced the Founding Fathers and the Revolutionary War as slave owners who didn't want to pay their taxes

Good acting

Lots of up and coming actors/actresses including Matthew McConaughey, Ben Affleck, Mila Jovovich, Jason London, and Parker Posey (so stunningly beautiful thogh she basically burnt out & faded away)

Great music from that time

Linklator is right that the 1970s was a decade of uncertainty which lacked the organizing principles of the 1960s (Civil Rights, Vietnam & the Sexual Revolution) or the 1980s (crass nouveau ruche conspicuous consumption) though the 1970s had the ending of the Vietnam conflict, the humiliation of the 1973 Oil Shock with the realization that the USA the would have to change radically for the economy to grow again, and the disillusionment and humiliation of Watergate.  It was clear that USA would not grow in the 1970s as it had in the 1950s or 1960s.  The USA seemed stuck, not moving backwards but not moving forwards.  It the time economic stagnation and inflation called stagflation.  Politicians seem unable to stop stagflation.  The future looked bleak.

Even the Women's Liberation Movement lost momentum and was unable to pass the Equal Rights Amendment.

Young people wondered what their future urea would be.  It seemed unrealistic to think the future would be better.  It was unclear what could or should do:",1504915200,,1789,5.037414965986395
59790,1,0783227361,"This movie may not be for everyone, and even though it's notable for its cast with many of them eventually moving on into superstardom, there is virtually no plot to this - it's basically two hours of watching a bunch of teenagers smoking, drinking, and hazing. It's very exaggerated, it tries to be funny, but it's just not funny, the movie is too slow, and it's way too long. Without a plot, the whole thing is meaningless. It's not even entertaining. Maybe this movie just hasn't aged well? Whatever the case, I'm truly dumbfounded as to why this is still to this day considered a classic.",1504396800,,592,4.59433962264151

59816,5,0783227361,"It's the last day of school in a Texas town in 1976, and according to the rising seniors, rising freshmen and some guy named Wooderson (Matthew McConaughey) who is long out of school but can't get enough, it's time to party! The movie follows the students as they smoke pot, chug beer, smash mailboxes, philosophize, make out, haze underclassmen and pretty much every other activity that prolongs adulthood's inevitability. While very freeform, its use of familiar tropes here and there gives it just enough structure. For instance, there is an audience surrogate in wide-eyed rising freshman and baseball star Mitch (Wiley Wiggins) and a sort-of protagonist in Pink (Jason London), a rising senior and quarterback who is ambivalent about signing his coach's commitment to swear off drinking, partying and everything else he and his friends enjoy doing together. There is even a ""villain"" in O'Bannion (Ben Affleck, naturally), a total jerk on the five-year plan who takes the hazing ritual a bit too seriously. Luckily, the movie gives enough attention to each of high school's walks of life for you to recognize and/or identify with at least one of them (I myself was a bit of thoughtful outsider Tony and a bit of thin-skinned outsider Mike). It is also bound to especially appeal to children and children's children of the '70s because the clothes, decor, lingo and especially the music will make you look twice at the release date. It all amounts to an often hilarious, often sad and wholly definitive living portrait of the most painfully transitional period of our lives. Well, now that I've said more than enough about it, did I like it? Let's just say that I've had Foghat's ""Slow Ride"" stuck in my head and a contact high every day since I watched it.",1498176000,,1761,4.892976588628763

So, if you grew up around 1976, if you cruised around town with your friends with "" Slow Ride "" playing from the 8 track tape player, then this movie is for you! What I wouldn't give right now to take a trip back to 1976 to re live some of the old memories that were no doubt some of the happiest times of my life. We weren't bored with life, rather, we were ""HIGH"" on life! Some of you may have heard about these times from your parents. We bragged about how much fun we had while growing up to the music from the 70's. So if you think your parents were crazy, and we made up stories about the mid/late 70's, then please check this movie out!. Then you will see just how much fun and excitement you missed out on.

All taking place in the 70s, an evocative transportal for those who can appreciate it, from familiar experiences in clothing, automobiles, speech, terminology, mannerisms, architecture and automobiles, to music and hairstyles.

Schools out for remmus, and the senior cretin jocks are out to get the scrubs, or freshmen, for a veritable rite of passage into full herd prominence. A party is thwarted, so its off to find another location, where everyone finally congregates to copulate, compete, and ingest large amounts of liquor, nicotine, and various amounts of narcotics in a nest of human and environmental nature. Even KISS makes an appearance in mannequin form!

For those who resonate with retrovolutionary presentations / visualizations, this film is sure to transport the viewer into a most amusing timewarp! ",1478736000,,1163,5.344262295081967

59988,3,0783227361,"I watched this movie for the first time the other night and have a couple critical remarks:

1.  This was American Graffiti; the remake.  I mean just about everything in the movie screamed ""watch this scene of American Graffiti to know how to make our movie"".  So for a lack of originality, or more for being so blatantly the same movie from a different decade, ""Dazed and Confused"" gets a few points off.

2.  The film missed on what I feel was a very important miss.  I grew up at the time the movie portrays.  I lived this film.  However, just about all of us who lived this time period acted respectfully toward figures of authority, including football coaches, police, you name it.  In this film there is a glaring hole there with the characters.  They don't get it.  I'm left to assume the director really doesn't get it there.  In the mid-seventies teenagers would have at least given the guise of respect to adults to their face.  Later on they would have talked to each other about how much they hated the authority figure, but in the presence of the adult?  That was something completely lost on the director and the actors.

3.  A lack of any conflict whatsoever.  This is somewhat excusable because the movie is a time capsule, but there was not even a hint of conflict in the film resulting in no tension whatsoever.  Let me dangle on something.  Give me at least one thing to remember that needs to be resolved toward the end of the film.

Other than that it was a good movie.  Like I said, I lived those very years at that very age.  I was called ""junior"" by some of the seniors during my freshman year.  I would have been one year older than the eighth graders who were about to become freshman.  The film nailed the period in some ways.  Not a bad film at all, just not so original (really, to say the least) and missed in a couple areas.",1472083200,,1855,4.366568914956011

This film is the closest I have ever seen to portraying the way things really were. I was a Nerd/Head in late 70s so I didn't really relate much to the jocks in this film but the choices and freedoms of that era are accurately presented.

60119,5,0783227361,"One of my all time favorite movies. I own this on Blu-Ray, but couldn't resist also buying it in Prime Video so I can watch it anytime I want from any of my devices.

This is the ultimate ""coming of age"" or ""finding your path"" movie. It's based around the '70s; there is stoners, there's hot chicks, tons of pot smoking, high strung morons getting themselves shot at, and in case I forgot to mention it - stoners (you can't have a true '70s storyline without one). What else could you want from a movie of this genre?

The movie follows several protoganists through the last day of school before summer vacation. There's the newly forged senior, a jock, but ""cool"" in the '70s sense of the word (laid back, always chill, only riled up about inportant things), still deciding what he wants in life yet knowing he won't let anyone else decide for him; then there is the geeky kid, who has accomplished middle school to find himself in the chaos of being a freshman (and it's barely the first day of summer vacation). That chaos made worse for the young freshman, Mitch Kramer, by the senior (who has the ""honor"" of being a high school senior two years in a row) who is intent on beating on the freshly minted freshman theoughout the film. The hell-bent senior begins as a protagonist yet quickly grows into an antagonist in the plot. Perhaps the only antagonist (aside from the coach) who is human - by which I mean, the plot's primary antagonist isn't a character but a feeling of undefined duty each character is pressured with. Those who finally disregard this nameless duty to ""find themselves"", come out haply at the end of the film.

Other perspectives followed throughout the film are those of a pair of seniors with a nerdy yet rebellious spirit, as well as another freshman who began as a shy girl and was pulled into the story line in much the same way as the freshman boy mentioned above. Then, of course, there is the iconic '70s hippie stoner - Schrader - who, throughout the film, personifies the literal definition of ""dazed and confused"". Think ""Shaggy"" from ""Scooby Doo"". Naturally, Schrader's my favorite character in this film, despite a relatively small part (by which I simply refer to minutes on screen).

There are many more perspectives followed throughout the film(i.e. Matthew McConaughey's character with the famous yet simple line of repeating two words in success - ""all right, all right, all right"") - a line I now associate with modern comedian Kevin Hart, however. Despite the other important and not so important characters who are followed on this iconic day of their lives', those are all the key characters, in my opinion.

In all seriousness, watching this for the first time a decade ago gave me a new perspective on my high school life; despite being an entirely different era than that of the '70s era painted in Dazed and Confused. Also, knowing that high school in the '70s was not like this at all for most, doesn't detract from the magic of this film or the fictional world within.

This is one of those rare films that I could watch an endless number of times without growing bored of it.

The name of this movie is based on the Led Zeppelin song by the same name. Yet, this film is summed up my an entirely different song; the track played at the ending credits. If you're a fan of this movie, it's impossible to hear the song Slow Ride by Foghat without thinking of this amazing film. Am I right?

This film, in my opinion, embodies righteous rebelliousness combined with level-headed musings on life: coupled with unleveling the head with some bong rips and fat joints, courtesy of characters Schrader and ""Pink"" Floyd.",1463529600,,3665,4.645061728395062

Take for example, Matthew McConaughey, who went on to win an Academy Award for his performance in Dallas Buyers Club (2013) and by the way, 'Dazed and Confused' is his debut movie role as an actor. Speaking of Academy Award winners, a very young Ben Affleck who also stars in this movie went on to become a two-time Oscar winner...and not to mention, the new dark knight of 2016.

Why most Americans find hazing, bullying and abuse such a treasured and amusing part of their forming years, is beyond me.

The only happy ending for the movie, would bee to see the city center overran by Al-Queada, where they proceed to slit the throat of every single character in the cast, and then finally the whole town is nuked into oblivion.

Two stars only because the soundtrack is objectively awesome. Everything else is just pathetic, in the most deep meaning of this word.",1455840000,,695,4.688524590163935

I don't know if I should have been born in a different time or if the themes of this movie never change, but it succeeds in capturing a moment in time in which most Americans can relate.

61099,5,0783227361,"If you graduated anytime after 1970, you'll probably recognize most of these kids. There's no story, as such, just the last day of school, and everything that goes on that night. If you don't recognize them all, you'll at least relate to some of them. Lots of great young actors: Matthew McConaughey and Ben Affleck as guys that are having trouble realizing that high school has an expiration date. Jason London and Sasha Jensen as a couple lovable jocks, Parker Posey and Milla Jovovich as seniors to be, initiating the incoming frosh girls. Rory Cochrane as the stoner, and many more. Not deep, not laugh out loud funny, but very close to the real experiences many of us had. There's hardly a false note in this movie-you'll like some characters, hate some, and be indifferent to others; a lot like high school, but much more entertaining. This movie has been around for over 20 years, and I saw it when it came out, but it has lots of potential for repeated viewings. Don't go in expecting either a big comedy, or a deep social statement-more of a slice of life type of film.",1453507200,3,1078,4.590673575129534

61263,4,0783227361,"This movie has no real plot.  For me it's purely nostalgia - I graduated high school in 1976, and this is a fairly good depiction of some of those times.  The clothing, long hair and cars were spot on.  The whole paddling/hazing thing was not anything I remember (maybe it was something done in small high schools in Texas), but the drunken and stoned parties I do remember.  We didn't have today's problem of obesity, but a lot of kids smoked and used drugs.  It was referred to it as ""The Stoned Age"" for fun.  The movie soundtrack was excellent - lots of songs of the early 70s, before disco took over as the popular music.  It was a post-hippie and post-Vietnam war time, when everything was in a sort of transition and there was nothing political to fight for anymore.",1452297600,3,773,4.439716312056738

There's a few things thrown in here and there but nothing that's really of note. Acting for the most part is not that good. Milla Jovavich barely does or says anything in the movie. Mathew McCaunehey is actually the funniest and most entertaining in the whole movie. Most of the other characters aren't that interesting or entertaining. The movie is a relaxed and easy watch. The soundtrack is very good, and it undoubtedly brings many back to their high school party not a care in the world days. However it is a bit lacking in the humor and plot department. There's no real place the movie seems to end up in and there's no real character we can follow or get behind.

Set your Way Back Machine for the 70's and a Wild Night on the last day of school.

61328,2,0783227361,"This is more or less a re-make of American Graffiti from the perspective of someone who thinks American Grafitti was about a car crash. (According to Wikipedia Linklater commented that high school was not so dramatic as car crashes, it was about getting Aerosmith tickets.)  Fair enough, but American Graffiti was really about the universal experience of having to grow up (with the subtle commentary at the end that 1/2 of the main characters did not grow up - one dies in a car crash, presumably a car crash resulting from a drag race, and another dies in Vietnam.)  Dazed and Confused isn't really about anything, except maybe the banality of high school (and perhaps the banality of the 70's). That is exactly Linklater's point (see http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/07/richard-linklater-filmography). But, that is lost on the later generations who made this a cult classic. If you understand Linklater's point this is as painful as watching Waiting for Godot, if it makes you wish you were in high school in the 70's then the movie basically failed.

Note: American Graffiti had a story.  Dazed and Confused does not, but it seems to have many of the same incidents, but with no particular role to play in the story. Consider this sum up from Variety ""One-liners and dry sight gags still abound, but the ennui-sodden formlessness of Slacker doesnt fly as well in this $6 million, smoothly lensed package, which calls for shapelier narrative and resolution.""

Also, I think it got the 70's wrong.  About 1/2 the cars are 50's classics and there are no station wagons and despite ZZTop's ""Low rider"" it has no low-riders. I kept thinking it was set in the mid-west. It is set in Austin Texas and there are apparently no Mexican/Chicanos -- really?  EVERYONE smokes pot.",1441670400,2,1779,4.96969696969697

This movie is about high school senior boys chasing rising freshmen boys around so they can paddle them with a paddle and high school senior girls who somehow force rising freshmen girls into penitentiary-style calisthenics while being berated and covered with filth. I don't understand how anyone could give this movie a good rating. It's honestly one of the worst movies I've ever suffered through (full disclosure - I could not finish watching it). There is no plot, no character development, and no laughs. None. It seems to me like they wanted to make an American Graffiti meets Porky's movie and they failed miserably on both accounts.

I graduated high school in 1980, so I thought this movie would be right in my ballpark, but I (and my wife) found it pointless and depraved. If you want to see a good ""stoner"" movie set in the 70s, watch Detroit Rock City.",1437264000,2,887,4.759740259740259

The lawyer, the administrative organizational freak,  the hair stylist, mechanic, soldier, entertainer, biologist, management leader, animal lover....so in one way, though the movie reflects Linklater's love affair with childhood and adolescence, we can peer through the looking glass into a familiar world most of us experienced and see ourselves once again struggling through those difficult years treading across life's bridge from childhood to young adult.",1405641600,,904,5.474820143884892

61821,5,0783227361,"This review is strictly my opinion of the MOVIE itself!

*******That being said,...there WILL be spoilers!*******

This movie takes place in the Bicentennial year, 1976. It follows several groups of high schoolers during the last day/night of school. Some returning Seniors next year and some entering as lowly Freshmen. The movie begins with the football players meeting up for the last periods of class and getting into a confrontation with their coach, whom wants them all to sign a ""promise"" to keep out of trouble (among other things) during the summer. Everyone agrees except the quarterback, Randell ""Pink"" Floyd (Jason London). He thinks it's stupid to have the players sign it and disregards the letter. Off to class. In the halls we meet, Slater (Rory Cochrane), the local stoner. Pickford (Shawn Andrews), the local dealer, fills in Slater about his killer party that night and agrees to meet Slater earlier for a little ""something"" which excites Slater. During this time, we meet Benny O'Donnell (Cole Hauser), who is in woodshop crafting a new ""paddle"". This leads us into the introduction of next years incoming Freshmen class! But not before we are introduced to O'Bannon (Ben Affleck). Apparently, O'Bannon failed his Senior year and comes back just to torment the incoming Freshmen for another year. Either way, they all head off to the Middle School.

This is where we meet Mitch Kramer (Wiley Wiggins). He is the younger brother of Jodi Kramer (Michelle Burke), a popular soon-to-be Senior. Outside the Seniors express their desire to thrash the incoming Freshmen all at once and make sure to tell Kramer they're especially coming for him. After hearing their threats, the Freshman make a break for it after school and luckily get away unscathed (for now).

After the local baseball game, Mitch Kramer is finally caught by the Senior guys and is given a SEVERE beating with the paddle. Apparently, this is more a term of endearment to Kramer as they invite him to Pickford's party that night. Of course, the party gets cancelled when the beer guy shows up 3 hours early and Pickford's parents refuse to leave for the weekend. They all decide to go to the local hangout, The Emporium, to shoot pool and drink beer. It is here that we first hear the famous words, ""Alright, alright, alright,..."" by the one and only, Wooderson (Matthew McCanaughey). Wooderson is THAT guy that every town has that never really does anything with his life and continues to hang around the high school (even though he's around 30 or something). During this time girls are met, beers are drank, pool is played, crimes are committed, and O'Bannon is finally given the proper revenge for his past actions. Afterwards, the whole crew decides to throw a beer bust at the ""Moon Tower"".

The moon tower is apparently an abandoned oil rig of some sorts? But the movie finishes out with everyone hanging out and causing trouble.

There is a LOT of story elements I left out because I don't want to give everything away and you really just need to see it for yourself. Again, this movie is SPECTACULAR! Total classic that will be watched by my kids and my kids kids! Hopefully.

FINAL VERDICT:  If you haven't already watched this,...WATCH IN NOW!!!!",1391817600,,3238,4.885245901639344
61842,5,0783227361,been looking for this movie on dvd for years and in less than a week it went from ordered to in my hands,1391731200,,104,3.5652173913043477
61843,5,0783227361,This is my favorite movie of all time. I got such a deal for it. I am very satisfied with this product,1391472000,,102,3.6818181818181817

61845,4,0783227361,This is one of my favorite movies.  Classic music and entertaining characters.  This is a movie I can watch over and over.  I will not review the plot since you can find that information on IMDB or elsewhere.,1391212800,,208,4.421052631578948
61846,3,0783227361,"I bought this to see just one scene for something I'm writing. I watched far more of it (but not the entire movie) because it was kind of a train wreck. I kept waiting for it to get better or worse.  Instead, it intrigued me because it was neither here nor there, and I just couldn't put a label on it.

The cast is kind of amazing, considering how bad the movie is. I recognized several people who've have had successful careers since this film. Other actors include plenty of ""oh, yeah,THAT guy!"" actors you've seen in small roles for the past dozen years.

The actual story left me cold. Maybe it was funny when it came out. Maybe it's a kind of humor I'm just not getting.  I winced at some of the stereotypes, and... well, it's just not my kind of film.

However, if you can look at it as something strange and campy, I think it could be fun.  Not massive fun, or wildly entertaining, but... fun. Maybe. It's odd. And quirky and dated and wall-to-wall cliches. I can't put a label on it, but if you put it on the TV as background at a party, I'll bet it would spark conversation... and some people might sit down and actually watch it.",1390953600,,1140,4.25462962962963

61882,5,0783227361,This film takes place in the Summer of 1976 which is the same year that I graduated High School. It follows a group of students and their activities after the last day of school. I must say that most of the antics going on were spot on to the things my friends and I were into. This is in no way a film to help support clean living and wholesomeness but hey. we were all Kids once too. The music is incredible and I had to get the soundtrack as well. This Movie has brought back more memories than I ever thought possible. I must say that even though I was involved in most of the antics going on in the Movie I was still able to become a responsible member of society LOL. If you were in High School in the Seventies you owe it to yourself to pick up a copy of this Movie. I think you will enjoy it as much as I have.,1380672000,,818,3.904191616766467
61883,5,0783227361,"Wow!  I'm actually saying ""wow"" for two reasons- one, obviously the first reason is because Dazed and Confused is a great movie but mostly because I had the soundtrack to this movie for over 15 years and *never even realized it until now*, haha.  As the movie rolled along and kept playing 70's rock and roll music that the film is based on, well, I first thought ""Hmmm, I think I have an album by the name Dazed and Confused"".  20 minutes later, after numerous songs have been played by this point (since basically one song after another plays regularly- something that I LOVE since the music is so good) I then realized that all these songs sound familiar not only because I've heard them countless times for over 30 years, but because they're all included on the Dazed and Confused soundtrack that I've been enjoying all this time!!

Anyway, usually I'm the first one to complain when I feel a movie is lacking a substantial plot of any kind, but in this case, all is forgiven.  Why is that you ask?  Well when you're able to deliver not only a star-studded cast of characters, but ones that have plenty of memorable lines and memorable scenes, it's probably the second best way to write a movie, or rather, the best way to make a movie that's missing a meaningful plot.  And it's not like Dazed and Confused is completely plotless.  It's more like, even though it's obvious these teens love the drugs, drinking and partying lifestyle and the film isn't going to head in any other direction, there's more substance taking place besides just these same old cliches.  These characters are all entirely awesome.  Every single one (and there's at least 20).

You have older teens giving the younger teens a hard time by, in one instance that takes up a good amount of time near the beginning, chasing them around with paddles because apparently paddling freshmen in the behind was the cool thing to do back then (or with the girls, making their cheerleader squad go through hazing incidents).  These are actually REALLY enjoyable segments to watch and they're always done with a feel-good intention.  It will not only remind the generation before mine of their time going through high school during the 70's (since the film does a *tremendous* job presenting these characters and the setting exactly like the laidback days of the 70's) but even though you're well-aware that this particular formula is never going to be truly original or mind-blowing, none of that matters in the slightest.  Dazed and Confused is just downright *fun*.  A real treat to watch.

It's hard to believe I'm giving the movie 5 stars because normally I'm pretty critical of plotless films, but this one HAS to be a major exception.  I love it!  And the soundtrack?  Well I'm a bit disappointed that my Dazed and Confused soundtrack doesn't include *every* song you hear in the movie (such as Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Tuesday's Gone"", Ted Nugent's ""Stranglehold"" or Black Sabbath's ""Paranoid"" to name a few) it's totally fine since those songs can all be found on numerous other discs/sources.  Expect lots of Alice Cooper, Foghat, Peter Frampton and Ted Nugent in particular, among the occasional Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Seals & Crofts, Steve Miller Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd in between.  Fantastic film.  Highly recommended!  Oh and on a final note, the women are absolutely *smoking* hot too.  I just had to get that in there. :)  Look at Milla Jovovich!  LOOK at her!!!",1380153600,,3443,4.783417935702199

The characters are true to life.  The simplicity of the story is marvelous and Linklater works small wonders within this setting.  There is a beautiful moment which occurs between an elderly married couple and the rebellious quarterback Randall Pink at the conclusion of a little league baseball game which conveys something of the nature of Texas.  For me this is a highlight.  For others it may seem a mere detail or filler moment.

When you strip everything away it's just a stoner movie with an awesome soundtrack - the problem is, the film's not's very funny or interesting.  There's the meandering storylines (since everyone is either drunk or stoned through most of the movie I guess we don't need a real plot), the glut of way too many characters whose names you can't even remember at the end of the movie, the weird obsession of the male jocks to pound the butts of younger boys with paddles, the female hazing rituals that sexualize the young freshman girls in uncomfortable ways, and perhaps most importantly, the creation of a false 1976 reality that no one actually experienced. In this world, the students roam free in the high school (with hardly a teacher around), pot and beer are freely available to any underage person who wants them, and hardly anyone in the whole town seems to have a curfew.  As another reviewer noted, Fast Times at Ridgemont High is a far superior coming of age film with a lot more believable situations and sympathetic characters.",1327968000,3,1137,4.675

While my high school days were in the 90's (in fact the movie came out my freshman year)this movie still takes me back to my high school days.  Just about every person in this movie reminds me of someone I went to school with, the clothes and music are just different.

I really can't put into words how great the performances of some the actors in this movie are.  Mathew McConaughey just owns his role.  Just shows signs of what is to come for him.  I am very disappointed Jason London didn't get more opportunities after his role as Pink as he also owned the part.

The worst part about this movie is the dumb quote on the original cover.  ""It was the last day of school in 1976, a time they'd never forget... if only they could remember.""  That quote is just so ridiculous and really doesn't describe the movie accurately.  With that quote, you would expect something more along the lines of Cheech and Chong.  These are just some high school kids, which partying does play a big part, its about the context.  With other stoner movies, partying is the main plot of the storyline, while with this movie, the partying is a part of the storyline, just the same as how they are at the pool hall in the movie.

62095,5,0783227361,"This movie had the exact feeling I remember during that bicentennial year. What Dazed and Confused does absolutely brilliantly is setup and execute a period (even if it's a recent period) piece.  From cars to clothes to hair to furnishings, Richard Linklater's film feels of that moment.  The soundtrack--a huge reason to watch the film in and of itself--blares great rock tunes from beginning to end.  Black Sabbath, ZZ Top, Bob Dylan, Aerosmith, Alice Cooper, KISS, The Runaways, and Lynyrd Skynyrd are just a few of the bands you'll come across listening to the movie.

There is a contingent of people who truly love this film, like me! If you're someone who can relate to the characters or lived a similar experience, you're sure to enjoy what Linklater offers up.  In this scenario, the film will work because of what you, the viewer, bring to it, Linklater offers all too few relatable characters and moments for the rest of us.

This Blu-ray release comes with deleted scenes, a ""filmstrip"" depicting the dangers of marijuana, and some retro public service announcements.  With neither the filmstrip nor the retro service announcements is it really particularly easy to tell (unless you are aware of their history) whether they're real or made more recently as a joke.  There is, in short, not much in the way of bonus features available.
The technical aspects of the release, however, are excellent.  The colors are rich and vibrant, particularly when they're part of a shiny automobile.  The level of detail, too, is quite good, as are the black levels.  Much of the film does take place at night, but there is little difficulty making out what is happening in the shadows.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack is very good as well.  The surrounds do come into play to help situate the viewer, but mainly you'll hear them blasting away the aforementioned soundtrack.  The audio is crisp and clean and well balanced with the rest of the track.  The film isn't terribly old and has been released and rereleased a number of times so it is no surprise that the source material is quite good.

62096,5,0783227361,"""Dazed and Confused"" details the last day of high school for the typical youths of America in 1976. Shot in and around Austin, Texas, the film failed at the box office in 1993-94, but has gone on to achieve a well-deserved cult status. I never even heard of the film until this year when I saw most of it on tv and promptly decided to pick it up the dvd when I got the chance.

To my mind, ""Dazed and Confused"" is one of the best high school comedy-dramas, along with 1982's ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High."" The difference between these two films is that ""Fast Times"" contains more goofy antics whereas ""Dazed"" is more of a docudrama with amusing flashes. In other words, although ""Fast Times is generally realistic, excepting the over-the-top parts with Spicoli, ""Dazed and Confused"" is more like a slice from real life.

What makes ""Dazed"" work so well is that it gets the LOOK of the mid-to-late 70s just right, particularly the hair & clothing styles. Secondly, the actors pull off the material expertly. In fact, a large part of the film's success is the excellent casting choices. Both are no easy feat. Speaking of the actors, you get a few up-and-comers here: Matthew McConaughey, Milla Jovovich, Ben Affleck and one or two of lesser note (as far as future popularity goes).

All the standard school archetypes are here: the jock who parties on the side, the bullies, the hot sister and her little long-haired brother, the black dude, the hot (feminist) teacher, the streetfighter, the cool guys, the geekier crowd, the babes, the guy who graduated years ago but still hangs around, the mentors & mentees, etc.

And then you have the standard school experiences like parties at friend's houses, keg parties, fleeing bullies, dealing with coaches & teachers, flirting, the possibility of sex, hanging out, meaningless conversations, fights, smoking pot at school or in your friend's bedroom, etc.

Like ""Fast Times,"" ""Dazed and Confused"" is a joy to watch -- whatever your age -- because it successfully takes you back to the high school years with all its joys & agonies.

Some don't like it because it's more of a slice-of-life film than a plot-driven, contrived story. The plot here is simple: It's the last day of school and the youths want to celebrate. If they can't party at their friend's house (because the dad catches wind of their plans) they'll have a party at the park or wherever, but they WILL party. The rest of the film involves their interactions within this context.

I've heard some complain that the film conveys a terrible message. What message? There is no message. The message is that school's out and it's time to celebrate! Besides, there are a few positive points that can be mined from the proceedings: the arrogant bully gets what's coming, make a stand and fight when you have to (even if you get beat up), ultra-tight pants must be put on with pliers & the help of a friend, be true to yourself, etc. But -- really -- this isn't a movie to look for deep messages, its simple purpose is to take you back to the school years -- in this case, 1976 -- and all the fun & painful experiences thereof.

No review of ""Dazed and Confused"" would be complete without noting the excellent soundtrack. You get some great rock/metal of the 70s like ""Sweet Emotion,"" ""School's Out,"" ""Stranglehold,"" ""Do You Feel Like We Do,"" ""Love Hurts,"" ""Paranoid,"" ""Rock & Roll Hootchie Coo,"" ""Rock & Roll All Nite,"" ""Slow Ride,"" ""Cherry Bomb,"" ""Tuesday's Gone"" and many more.

As this goes on I already start cringing my teeth thinking Oh Not another High School movie Im too old for this senseless hierarchies. But as the movie progresses you get to follow each character and each is shown not as a stereotype but as human being. Yes the seniors get to catch a freshman and start paddling him but also give him a beer on his way out. Pink (Jason London) a supposed jock seems to move around every social circle without a problem. Scared Freshman Mitch (Wiley Wiggins) turns out to be more astute and aware of his surroundings by the end of the day. And all this happens very subtlety.

Dazed and Confused is not a movie mimicking life but is a slice of life itself. It doesn't glorify anything or anybody. You don't get out of it feeling anybody was cool or evil. Well Affleck's character was indeed a douche. But they are all just kids trying to make something out of their lives. Teenagers pretending to be men and women. We really don't know what the future hold for them. Some might become lawyers or engineers, maybe some would never move out of their mom's house. Because that is how life is unexpected and how some people can surprisingly turn their lives around any day.",1302825600,2,1746,4.3919753086419755

Kegger tonight at the Moon Tower!

This is easily a cult classic!  It is my favorite party movie.

This is one of those movies that don't really have a plot or a goal (such as our teen-age lives in the 70's). It's just about 10 or so little semi-stories involving about 24 different actors and actresses. All these characters share a common goal: ""What do you want to do?"" Nobody seems to think they're going anywhere, so just getting together with their fellow classmates after the last day of school for a beer bash at someone's house is very likely the only thing that matters right now. Everyone sort of questions their existence, they think their life is a bore. We may have thought this then, but we sure do miss those empty, easy-going days now.

Many agree that this is just another ""American Graffiti"" but set in 1976, which is the year I was a high school freshman. I guess the movie ""American Pie"" is for today's high school teen. Thank God, ""Dazed and Confused"" is not nearly as tasteless.

""Dazed and Confused"" came out about 1993. What makes this film work so well is that the 24 main characters are all unknown actors (at the time). Just like ""American Graffiti"", many nobody's became big stars afterwards. In 1993, we really didn't know Matthew McConnahey, Ben Affleck, and maybe about 3 others who have gone on to do other movies. The other stars in this film will always be remembered only as the teen they portrayed in this film...which makes this film, all the more, precious and a gem to get lost in. However, I know this film has to have a cult following. Wouldn't it be great if it were possible to get these 24 actors and actresses together again for a sequel?

This movie touches on the many nuances of personalities that I'm sure everyone knew somebody ""just like somebody here"". But, there is one really ""dumb"" line used in this film. It still irks me when I hear Mike (Adam Goldberg) say ""I wanna dance!"" It's really out of text when he describes how he doesn't like his decision for wanting to ""Help needy people"" after college. But, other cliches' are priceless. I love McConnahey's approach when he says ""All right! All Right! All Riiight! I've adopted it myself. Oh, and that classic line ""Are you cool, Man?""

This is truly a fun party movie to have on with friends over (you know, the 30+ crowd). Linklater really captured the essence of the moment. The extras thrown in (a few deleted scenes in the bonus features section) is nothing really necessary, in fact, I'm glad that they were removed from the movie.  They showed some of the characters in a darker persona that would hurt how I would like the character overall.

 ""Dazed and Confused"" captures mid seventies culture, all the cliches', nuances, and teenage confusion that we all shared together, back then. Rent it first, either you'll relate to it whole-heartedly, or it just wasn't your era at all. This film might just serve to please a small specific age group, just like ""American Graffiti"", and ""The Big Chill"". Either you were there, or you weren't. We understand.

Anyway, buy this film came in a twin pack that comes with ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" on DVD.  This film also comes in the new 5.1 stereo sound.  These are two excellent films to have together.  And I understand that this movie will be on Blu-Ray soon too.",1299283200,7,3399,4.595041322314049

I highly recommend this for anyone that graduated from high school in the 1970's...I graduated in 1971, and the movie is set in 1976 but it doesn't seem to make much difference. The music soundtrack is great and brings back many memories. It just seems that this movie does a perfect job of re-creating the good memories of high school.

62126,5,0783227361,"""Dazed and Confused"" is a great movie, one you will want to watch again and again!
If you were in junior high (middle school) or high school in the 1970s, you will be able to re-live that era through this movie.
And this movie is also great for people who were either too young, or too old to be a student in the 1970s, so they, too, can get a taste of what life was like as a teenager in the '70s.
While I was not familiar with the ""initiation"" rituals being done to incoming freshmen, the events and scenarios of the rest of the film rang true.
This film gives a good all-around look at the different types of groups we all remember back in school.....the jocks, the pot-heads, the intellectuals, etc.
One character in the movie is able to move seamlessly throughout the different groups, and while this movie is an ensemble effort, Randall ""Pink"" Floyd seems to be the main character throughout this movie.
This movie was made in the 1990's, but they did a fantastic job of depicting school-life back in the mid-70s.
As you continue to watch the movie again and again, you will inevitably have fun repeating the key lines in this movie....
""Check ya later!"", ""That's why I love those high school girls, man. I get older, and they stay the same age!"", ""Alright, alright, alright!!!""
and other memorable lines.
Get this movie,and re-live that era that was such a brief time in your life, but the memories of which will always be with you!

62148,5,0783227361,"In Quentin Tarantino's (REPRESENT! Oh sorry) list of the 12 best movies ever made, among Taxi Driver (hey, not a bad choice anyway), kung fu movies I've never heard of, Carrie, a blaxploitation film, and a Spaghetti Western, this movie almost seems out of the place on the list.  However, when watching it, it's no wonder that Tarantino loves this movie.  This is an ultimate pop culture filter, a movie that, from what other people who have lived through the 70's, say it's just like this (can't quite say, anyway).  And while, sadly, Robert Plant refused to let any of their songs be in the movie(too bad, because it's sorely missed), it still doesn't detract much from the time warp 70's feel.  The greatest asset, I must mention, that is really doesn't feel that dated.  Maybe because the 70's warms up to me more than, say, the 80's (no, I don't wish I was in the 70's like some other losers.  the 00s isn't bad because every other decades' great movies and music that transcend their time still exist).

Who knew a comedy from 1993, one that grossed less than eight million, would become known as a favorite movie of one of the most influential new directors of the era (not to mention the only Director I am a fan of).  While Dazed and Confused is not among the most influential, ground breaking movies ever, it's one of the loosest, most fun movies ever.  For a movie that doesn't feature much of a plot, it's a compliment that this movie is so great.  And while the sound track, cars, and 70's culture gets much of the rap, nothing quite captures the fun of this movie more than the ageless good times on display here.  Even when filtered through the 70's culture.

This is based in High School, but unlike your average lame teen movie, this has real moments, real kids, and absolutely no lame drama of any kind.  I'm not quire sure what the exact message of this movie is, but I don't think any other high school movie really tells it like it is, not even Heathers.  There's some real teenage stuff going on here, and not just angsty _______ like heavy drama when dealing with girlfriends.  Sure, there are hazing scenes, and yes, there are talks about life and other things like that, but that's another reason why this movie is great.  Talks about decades, and the greatest quote about High school (as well as College) ever: ""If I ever Start referring to these as the best years of my life, remind me to kill myself"".  And hey, while that's true, you have to love Dawson's reply of getting the most out of High School as well.  Yes, this is real stuff that teenagers should think about.  Great messages embedded within, and it's stuff that I already knew. it's just great to hear it among this movie.

But it's also a whole lot of fun, which helps it stand out a lot (much how Heathers stand out with it's use of Black humor).  Backed by a bunch of ordinary, yet totally memorable cast of characters with a bunch of future stars in the cast (among the funniest are Ben Affleck and Anthony Rapp), it avoids the third person syndrome trap (a syndrome that deals with the question ""WHy am I watching fiction instead of living real life?"") and features cool cars, sheer fun, drinking, and great dialogue, all the while making one of the coolest movies out of one day, which, as everybody and your mother knows, the last day of school.  Watching this movie takes a certain mood, as I probably wouldn't watch this movie everyday.  But when the moods hits, nothing is quite as fun and satisfying as reliving the last day of High School with these people.  The sound track kicks @$$, and like a Tarantino movie, it gains more meaning when used with the movie (HOLY S***!!!!!), the cars are great, and who doesn't love watching Fred get pissed off or going along for a ride of Baseball mailbox (or whatever it's called)?  Really, I can't say enough about this movie.

Oh, and the Flashback edition is lame as hell.  That stupid featurette is no Reefer Madness.  This version,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dazed-Confused-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000F6IHSG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dazed & Confused - Criterion Collection</a>, has excellent picture quality, has great special features, and features a great packaging that stores the movie in the packaging it deserves.  Sure, it's a bit expensive, and if you find a copy for fourty dollars, please swallow your pride or something and find it cheaper.  This kind of money for one movie is bad.  Still, I digress.

Richard Linklater is something special, and being part of the VCR generation of film makers like the great one, Smith, and Anderson, safe to say, what a cool batch of directors.  I still can't believe the guy who directed this and other free form movies like Slacker and Waking Life (a movie that features Wily Wiggins and some of the coolest use of animation known to man) also directed a hit comedy movie like School of Rock (not like that's a bad thing)!

62153,4,0783227361,"Richard Linklater wrote and directed this tribute to his mid-1970s  high school days. ""Dazed and Confused"" follows the exploits of a group of students on the last day of school in 1976. Randall ""Pink"" Floyd (Jason London) is a handsome, amiable quarterback who gets along with everyone: jocks, stoners, nerds, but is reluctant to sign a no-drugs-or-alcohol pledge that the football team requires for the next season. New seniors haze the incoming freshman from the junior high school, led by a bully named O'Bannion (Ben Affleck), who is determined to wallop young Mitch (Wiley Wiggins) in particular. Pink takes Mitch under his wing, and they all spend the night cruising around, boozing, smoking pot, and bashing the occasional mail box.

Not a whole lot goes on during this night of revelry and mayhem, but ""Dazed and Confused"" does as much to capture suburban teen culture in the 1970s as ""American Graffiti"" did for the 1960s. This was the tail end of the Baby Boom generation, caught between the idealism of the 1960s and the materialism of the 1980s, feeling that they missed out on anything meaningful. Tired of thinking of the present as ""some minor, insignificant preamble to something else"", they go about living life as it presents itself, to a 1970s soundtrack of more than 30 songs. The film was made in 1993 with an ensemble cast of up-and-coming stars of the 1990s decked out in 1970s attire: Ben Affleck, Joey Lauren Adams, Parker Posey, Mila Jovovich, Matthew McConaughey. It's a fun and fond trip back in time to a more laid-back America.

62190,4,0783227361,"THE TOP TEN THINGS I WAS 'DAZED AND CONFUSED' BY

1.  Dazed and Confused spent 16% of the budget securing the rights to 70s pop songs for the sound track--but did they use ""Dazed and Confused"" the Led Zeppelin song from which the film took its title? No. Linklater asked Led Zeppelin if he could use it, and Jimmy Page said ""yes,"" but Robert Plant said ""no."" They did get the rights to ""School's Out"" by Alice Cooper, ""Love Hurts"" by Nazareth, ""Tush"" by ZZ Top, ""Cherry Bomb"" by The Runaways, and the song that seems to sum up the zeitgeist--the spirit of 1976--almost as well as the Zep song would have, though the title isn't nearly as catchy, ""Slow Ride"" by Foghat. It is used at least twice, and the final time is for the ending, to sum up the whole experience.

2.  Richard Linklater directed 'Dazed and Confused,' and he also directed 'Slackers,' 'The School of Rock,' and 'Through a Scanner, Darkly.' The latter was roto-scopped, a technique that converts live action to animation, and then the special effects can be animated as well. It saves lots of money, so they got a lot of heavy weight actors to play the parts, like Keanu Reeves, Winona Ryder, and Robert Downey Jr. Actually, they all wanted to do it because they were fans of Philip K. Dick. Rory Cochrane, who plays stoner Ron Slater in 'Dazed and Confused' is also in it. It is based on a book by Philip K. Dick. The Dick Estate was really hoping that they could finally capture a Dick book on celluloid. Hollywood has tried many times, but never really got the escense of his writing. I really wanted to see it, but it disappeared from theaters so fast I never had a chance. By the way, if you notice when I mention a movie there is a link, but it is at the bottom. I don't want to interrupt the flow of reading so I mention now, and Link Later (Rim shot denoting a supremely punishing pun).

3.  Richard Floyd, Andy Slater and Bobby Wooderson were the actual people from Linklater's Huntsville High School daze that he based some of his characters on, but they claim Linklater never asked them if he could use their surnames, and they later ended up suing him in October of 2004. Floyd, who now works at a car showroom in Huntsville, Texas, says, ""We had fun in high school, but there is nothing true about that movie. Yet I am having to deal with it all the time."" The lawsuit was filed in New Mexico rather than Texas because New Mexico has a longer statute of limitations.

4.  Dazed and Confused only grossed $8 million when it was first released, but it has gone on to cult status. Quentin Tarantino cited it on a list of the 12 greatest films of all time. Roger Ebert gave it three stars out of four, calling it ""art mixed with anthropology"" with ""a painful underside."" Entertainment Weekly put it third on a list of the 50 best High School movies.

5.  Call me crazy, but in spite of the posthumous acclaim afforded 'Dazed and Confused' I think that 'Varsity Blues' is the better film. Both were about football crazed high schools in Texas, yet D&C never had a single scene of anyone actually playing football. VB has some great football scenes. Also, the reluctant hero of VB won the big game, but didn't let football define his life, going on to college. The quarterback of D&C makes a stand by refusing to sign a pledge to not take drugs and hangs out with stoners. Not exactly an inspiring message. Granted, D&C was more realistic while VB had some scenes of comic relief that verged on the silly. Also, VB was at times powered by the fantasy/wish fulfillment engine. While Tarantino may have put his Seal of Approval on D&C, VB garnered a shout out from 'Mean Girls.'

6.  Mike Newhouse (Adam Goldberg) is what could be described as either an intellectual outsider or a nerd. He belongs to a trio of misfits who have banded together. As their High School days come to an end, they decide to go to a beer bust, tired of thinking, thinking, thinking and endlessly discussing their thoughts.

---------
Mike: It's what everybody in this car needs is some good ol' worthwhile visceral experience.
==========================

Goldberg wanted to do the movie when he read that his character would get into a fight, and thereby have an epiphany of sorts at said beer bust. Adam will be familiar to most viewers from his numerous television appearances where he proved adept at ""mining the neuroses of his characters for both comedic and dramatic effect.""* For instance, 2005's ""Head Cases"" where he played a lawyer with explosive disorder, would seem made to order for a man of his talents, but it only lasted five episodes on Fox. He was on both ""Friends"" and the ill considered spin off, ""Joey,"" but as different characters. He played Freud in fellow nerd cast mate Marissa Ribisi's film, 'Some Girl.' I would be curious to see his performance in drug noir film 'The Salton Sea' with Val Kilmer. He was once engaged to Christina Ricci.

7.  Tony Olson (Anthony Rapp) is another one of the misfits. A major part of 'Dazed and Confused' is the hazing that occurs for the incoming freshmen and freshwomen students. Though they observe (and by ""observe"" I mean they watch, not partake, in it) the ritual with disdain, it serves as an icebreaker when Jodi Kramer hazes Sabrina Davis (Christin Hinojosa):

-----
Jodi: Ask Tony to marry you.
Sabrina Davis: Will you marry me?
Tony: Oh god, what am I supposed to say?
Mike: I don't know.
Tony: Uh, whadda ya do for me?
Sabrina Davis: Umm, anything you like.
Tony: [turns to Mike] Imagine the possibilities.
======================

They later connect at the beer bust where he uses this classic pick up line:

---------------
Tony: We were just discussing the utter stupidity of these initiation rituals, and we were wondering how someone such as you would subject themselves to the losing end of it all.
=========================

Anthony Rapp went on to star in 'Rent.' He originated the role of ""Mark Cohen"" on Broadway and also played him in the film version. He also appeared in the original Broadway production of 'Six Degrees of Separation' and the film adaptation. He was a childhood friend of Andy Dick, an experience that no doubt scarred him for life. He was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance of a cast in 'A Beautiful Mind,' an honor that he shared with Adam Goldberg and Russell Crowe. Christina Hinojosa hasn't done anything acting-wise since 1997, but as a freshman at the School of Social Service Administration at the University of Chicago she founded the organization Wage Peace in 2002. She currently is one of their most prominent public speakers.

8.  Cynthia Dunn (Marissa Ribisi) is the third member of the intellectual High School misfit trio. It is her red hair and good looks that get them invited to the beer bust by David Wooderson (Matthew McConaughey). Though Wooderson is a 22 year-old who still hangs out with High School kids, Cynthia is flattered by the attention.

-----
Cynthia: God, don't you ever feel like everything we do and everything we've been taught is just to service the future?
Tony: Yeah I know, like it's all preparation.
Cynthia: Right. But what are we preparing ourselves for?
Mike: Death.
Tony: Life of the party.
Mike: It's true.
Cynthia: You know, but that's valid because if we are all gonna die anyway shouldn't we be enjoying ourselves now? You know, I'd like to quit thinking of the present, like right now, as some minor insignificant preamble to something else.
======================

Marissa Ribisi is the twin of Giovanni Ribisi, though obviously they are not identical. They were born 15 minutes apart. Like her brother and Adam Goldberg, Marissa has also appeared on ""Friends."" One of her film roles was in 'The Size of Watermelons.' She wrote and appeared in the film 'Some Girl' which was about four unstable twenty something women living in Los Angeles and looking for stable relationships. She found one herself, and is also officially the Queen of All Nerds, as she is married to Beck.

9.  Mitch Kramer (Wiley Wiggins) is one of the freshmen who is singled out for harsh punishment by Fred O'Bannion (Ben Affleck), and it gets even harsher when his big sister Jodi Kramer (Michelle Burke) pleads for leniency.

-----
Mitch: [after seniors threaten him] Er, Mr. Payne. Sir. You know every second that you could let us out early would really increase our chances of survival.
Mr. Payne, junior high school teacher: It's like our sergeant told us before one trip into the jungle.
[shouts]
Mr. Payne, junior high school teacher: Men!
[the boys jump]
Mr. Payne, junior high school teacher: Fifty of you are leaving on a mission. Twenty-five of you ain't coming back.
Mitch: Okay.
================

Mitch's punishment becomes harsher still when he evades Fred's initial attempt and his mother (Mona Lee Fultz) greets Fred's knock on the door like Dick Chaney--with a loaded shotgun. Mitch is the pitcher on the baseball team, and therefore his whereabouts are disclosed to Fred. But don't worry; soon he is partying up a storm with his former tormentors, running in the same circles as big sister Jodi:

-------------
Jodi: Is that a beer in your hand?
Mitch: Why, yes it is.
Jodi: Have you had more than one of those?
Mitch: Few. No one's counting.
Jodi: When were you supposed to be home?
Mitch: Few hours ago I think.
Jodi: That's ********. That's major ********. You know I was barely let out at your age?
Mitch: Aww.
Jodi: Aww. Well don't think she won't be waiting up for you. And she is tough. I've been through it.
Mitch: Just don't ask her to take it easy on me.
===========================

10. Fred O'Bannion (Ben Affleck) is perhaps a little too invested in the hazing ritual, as he flunked and was held back a year, some conjecture just so he could participate a second time in the merciless paddling of freshmen. Funny thing, though Ben Affleck is the biggest star to participate in 'Dazed and Confused' yet I didn't even recognize him until I saw the credits roll. Rene Zellweger had a bit part as Girl in blue pickup truck but it was uncredited. Perhaps that is where she met Rory Cochrane, who played stoner Ron Slater, because they lived together for four years. Back to Affleck, he co-starred with and chased Joey Lauren Adams (who played Simone Kerr in 'Dazed and Confused') in 'Chasing Amy.' In the links below I chose 'Reindeer Games' as his most embarrassing movie though I was attempted to use 'Gigli.' Reason is because he was teased about it in 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' and director Kevin Smith ought to know what gets his goat--or reindeer as the case may be.

62217,3,0783227361,"DAZED AND CONFUSED is the story of a group of High Schoolers enjoying ""Senior Day"" back in 1976.

As a product of that era, this used to be one of my favorite stupid movies. And, truth be told, the presentation of this version is excellent. But with the passage of time I've come to realize that my affection for DAZED AND CONFUSED has more to do with my own sense of nostalgia than with this film's actual ability to accurately reenact the mid-70s. This is far better than THAT 70S SHOW, for example, but it's still utterly ersatz.

It may have to do with the setting, small-town Texas, as opposed to Long Island, where I grew up, but my gut feeling is that the shortfall has less to do with geography than with gestalt. DAZED AND CONFUSED is too one-dimensional. The film gets the stoner elements just about right (""And it's green!""), but it just doesn't address my generation's then-prevalent desire to see ourselves as post-hippie hippies, the heirs of the Sixties counterculture; nor does it touch on our bitter cynicism about Watergate and Vietnam and our concomitant distrust of authority, something that endures to this day. It wasn't all about rollin' and smokin'---a lot of it was, but not all of it---and it was the substance of those homegrown conversations that defined us, not the mere act of lighting up.

Granted, DAZED AND CONFUSED isn't a social history, but ANY period film has to capture its times in order to be authentic. This doesn't.

Lest I sound TOO cynical, this is a little gem of a film that's well worth seeing, and it will take you back---you'll just never forget that you're watching actors act.

We did not go hunting down Sophomores just to 'whack' them or 'air raid' them.  Fast Times at Ridgemont High was a much better movie.

The first time you watch it you will be entertained. Upon each successive viewing you will discover more elements of the fine storytelling, character development, and nuanced commentary on the dynamics of adolescent development in the ubiquitous setting of a boring, suburban, football-crazed town. Though it's fun to watch this filim with friends and maybe have a beer or two to feel some of the buzz that the characters have practically thoughout the story, it's also a good idea to watch this film attentively. There's a lot to see.
Many potential buyers will likely be interested in the deleted scenes. As is the case with most DVDs, you can clearly see why these ended up on the cutting room floor. All but one are totally worthless. In the most interesting one, an argument on the Vietnam War ensues between Pink, the ""protaganist"" we love, and Benny, his one-dimensional football teammate. Pink argues that the U.S. lost the war and ruined a country, while Benny argues that the U.S. won because ""we killed way more of them dooks (sic) than they did us."" Dawson says nothing.

Linklater crafted a film that is very ""real"". He doesn't mince words and he certainly tells how it is. Age-wise, I would have been Mitch Kramer, but man oh man how I would have loved to have been Mitch Kramer. To have gotten the stew beaten out of me once and then be brought under the wings of the cool jocks would have been awesome...it happened to more than a couple of buddies of mine, but I managed to only make the perifery.

The cast is full of really great performances by young actors who actually seem to be channelling real people from 1976. Jason London, Sasha Jenson, Wiley Wiggins and Rory Cochrame all deliver well tuned performances. Parker Posey IS ""that"" girl in high school who thought she ran the place.

Now i know what you fans are asking, ""Why couldn't they give this treatment the first time."" The problem was universal studios initally were gonna do a 10 year anniversary dvd for the film. This 10 year anniversary edition was only going to exist if Richard Linklater (director) would do a commentary. Unfortunately universal studios imposed a short deadline for the 10 year anniversary release, there wasn't enough time for Richard Linklater to put all the special features, hence, the behind-the-scenes doc. aired on AMC this past September.

It doesn't necessarily have a plot, it's basically about the last day of school at a high school in a small town in Texas in 1976. The soon-to-be seniors are initiating the soon-to-be freshmen, A few friends are trying to get Aerosmith tickets, and everyone is trying to party or get stoned, drunk, or laid. Oh yeah. Dazed and Confused is definitely a cult classic, and a movie I could watch easily over a million times. Even though it's about the END of the school year, it's still fun to watch whenever. Oh, and Slater is my favorite character by far. The soundtrack is AWESOME as well, featuring songs by: Aerosmith, Foghat, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Alice Cooper, Ted Nugent, War, ZZ Top, Peter Frampton, KISS, Steve Miller Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd to name a few bands.

This is, hands down, one of the greatest teen movies ever made. People who grew up in the 70's claim this movie captures the time perfectly (just read some of the reviews here!), and this movie is definitely a must see. It'll make every young viewer wish they were there partying and having a good time, and every adult remember the good times they had during their teenage years. So, if you're looking for an entertaining flick to watch or want a flick that you AND your buddies will enjoy, check out ""Dazed and Confused"".

62306,5,0783227361,"I love this movie; it's one of the most honest and hilarious teen movies EVER. I really have lost count of all the times I've seen it and yes I do have a friend that is exactly like every one of these characters.

PLOT: There really is no plot to this movie. It's the last day of high school in 1976. Th upcoming seniors are hazing the upcoming freshman. The boys by paddling the other boys with very thick paddles and the girls by making them propose to older boys, pouring food on them and taking them through a carwash. One of the boys is throwing a party but is caught by his parents when the kegs of beer is delivered too early. So we watch as the jocks, nerds, stoners, etc. cruise around for the rest of the night. I know it doesn't sound too interesting but it is a hilarious, accurate movie that is suprisingly thoughtful and observational.

CAST:

Jason London(Randall 'Pink' Floyd): London isn't very funny at all in his role but he is great as the guy who is popular because he gets along with everyone and is laid back. He's the star quarterback and is pressured to sign a pledge not to indulge in sex, alcohol, or drugs all of which he is active in.

Rory Cochrane(Ron Slater): Cochrane is hilarious as the stoner who goes through most of the movie out of it with his eyes closed throwing out great rambling about weed, sex, aliens and George Washington.

Sasha Jenson(Don Dawson): I think Jenson gave the best performance as the football player who doesn't care about much of anything except girls and partying and having a good time. Everything he does is hilarious. He gets suprisingly more contemplative towards the end but not much.

Adam Goldberg(Mike Newhouse): Goldberg is solid as the neurotic guy whose uncertain about his future and life in general. He has some good lines and I love it when he gets in a fight at the end just because you wouldn't expect it from him.

Matthew McConaughey(David Wooderson): McConaughey was outstanding as the aging party animal who still hangs out with the high school kids. We all know someone like this. He was hilarious but his character is ultimately sad especially at the end when he tells Floyd he should choose not to follow rules and do whatever because while it sounds good at first you realize that there comes a time when everyone has to grow up.

Ben Affleck(Fred O'Bannion): I really liked Affleck's also performance because its another one of those you can easily recognize from your own life. He is the school jerk who lives to torment the freshman. He was really over the top especially with his temper tantrums.

Cole Hauser(Benny O'Donnell): This character didn't really get as much screen time as I would've liked but I enjoyed Hauser's role as the other bad*** who is actually a little more thoughtful than the other jocks.

Other standouts include: Shawn Andrews as the would-be party thrower Kevin Pickford, Jason O. Smith as the token black jock Melvin and Joey Lauren Adams as Pink's girlfriend Simone.

CONTENT: This movie has an extreme amount of drug use and bad language. There's also some violence such as the fight scene and the freshman getting viciously paddled.

EXTRA STUFF: The one liners are classic and the movie is suprisingly thoughtful and contemplative about life and whether you should do what you want or conform for the sake of your friends.

FINAL WORD: This is one of my favorite movies and it's sure to bring back memories.",1124755200,4,3428,4.646280991735537

Because the teen years are a joke to begin with, even tragedy seems perversely amusing through the looking glass of time.  The boys resemble David Cassidy, or Roger Staubach.  The girls all look like Stevi Nicks.  The patter is accurate with stoner kids talking like black folks sort of.  I'm high man, so high, blah, blah, pass the bong.  You get the idea.

The hazing incidents, boys getting paddled, girls getting slimed, seem to be a small town, Mid-Western ritual, I'm not familiar with within my secure East Coast cottage, but I thought it was fascinating when the senior, dominatrix in training chick, whips the little freshman girls into shape, hmm, perverse.

Every teen film has to have a party and these kids get bombed outdoors, a massive kegger and bong fest.  One of the last scenes, a romance on a blanket was unexpected, and I will not spoil it.  Is there anything new or important here to learn about kids or their world?  No, not much, but film is amusing at times, and it certainly nails a time and place.

'93, the late 80s were still being wrung out of American culture, and there was only grunge, and it was about to disappear.  Then, this movie came out.  Though it wasn't huge at the box office, it got to video quickly, and as word of mouth spread, so did this movie-along with its clothes, music, etc.-and the 70s were back, sort of.  Flared pants returned, tight pants returned, long, straight hair came back, copycat movies and/or retro-type movies started appearing more, 'That 70s Show' went on the air, the original KISS got back together, etc., mostly due to the impact of this movie.

Linklater hit this era right on the mark. We didn't have the amount of hazing freshmen that went on there, but I remember being ""initiated"" on my second day of high school and I know others that got it a lot worse - especially the freshmen jocks. I'm now 44 years old and this movie really takes me back. It's hard to believ it's been over twenty years since those days - but they were very good days. I remember toking the grass with friends. Hitting the beer bash, crusing the town in some cool cars. The ladies were so hot back then. I really dig those tight jeans and the long hair. I remember all of it and now as an adult when I need a dose of sanity I put in this DVD, light-up a little MJ, kick back and soak it up. Thers' not plot - except life - which has no plot. The music then was incredible and this soundtrack has almost all of it except for Boston's fist LP which came out in 76' and was huge. Could have at least heard som Zepplin in there - I mean, come on, the movie's called Dazed & Confused! to all you who were too young or not around, those days may be gone, but the mindset and attitude can be brought back.

I am here to talk about the ripoff of companies releasing several different versions of DVD's. All of them have a little tiny bit of an interesting extra feature but none of them have enough to justify the extra money charged.  This is a blatant attempt to get the consumer to pay a lot of money for very little reason. This DVD has almost nothing to make it worth the extra $15 you have to pay. There are some mildly amusing moments in the extra features but nothing of substance. Stick with your old copy or buy it cheaper if you really must have it.

However, a note to those of you who are reading this because you've seen the movie and want to know more about the DVD itself:
I was disappointed with the Flashback Edition. There are no commentary tracks and the extras, while funny, aren't too exciting and seem to be there for the purpose of having SOMETHING new for a second edition that they can make more money off the movie and pacify those who complained that the previous version had no special features at all.
The only extra segment that I enjoyed was the montage of 9 deleted scenes, some of which explain inconsistencies in the movie. For example, how did O'Bannion and others know that Mitch would be pitching a baseball game? Now I know. Having missed those scenes all these years I don't feel like I needed them. What I really wanted was some insight from Linklater. I watched it with the subtitles on (are those considered a ""special feature"" if they're embedded in the movie itself?) and that really did add to my enjoyment of the actual movie. Like I said, I can recite a lot of the lines. Now I can recite more and the ones that I'd misheard have been corrected.
If you already own the previous edition, save your money on the new one or buy another DVD.

62364,5,0783227361,"As one who briefly glimpsed but still remembers the 70's, I have to say Dazed and Confused completely captured the atmosphere. The characters had a perfect blend of post-hippy idealism balanced with the melancholy and betrayal of Watergate and Vietnam, they looked forward to an uncertain future but were unable to see far beyond getting out of High School. The open-ended storyline, while remaining elusive and unresolved, is an accurate snapshot of High School life of the era (the funny thing is i grew up doing the exact same things in the 80s). It's dialogue is a bit dry at times, the pacing is somewhat flawed and there's lots of scenes of driving cars, but thats what the decade was  actually like. so whenever i want to get my 70's nostalgia on, this is the movie I watch.",1104105600,2,781,4.659420289855072

It shows normal life (or at least what we have been made to believe was normal in the 70s) of high school teens, or at least a day out of their lives. There are stereotypes, peer pressure, a future looming ahead, drungs, alcohol, school, and everyone wants to party but... they have to find one first. It is a great movie to watch with friends while sharing beers or just hanging out without a point.

I really can't describe what it is that makes me put the movie back in the DVD player again and again. The acting is just ok, the plot is almost non-existant, there isn't any one feature that is special about it. I guess it just makes me feel at least for 100 minutes that I am in a different world yet somehow this world is familiar and feels real.

The movie is great but the DVD ain't up to scratch. Linklater has said he is working on HIS OWN special edition with Criterion, which will include loads of cool stuff (much like Criterion have recently done with Linklater's Slacker).

It's hardly qualifies for a special edition, as there's barely an extras, and to think there are films out there crying out for a special edition but aren't entertained - Titanic for example. There's lot of alcohol & drug (ab)use in this, although the ill-effects are never really shown. The film is more focused on the guys experiences, rather than the girls, and actresses like Milla Jovovich have virtually no lines to say, and just act stoned all the time.

There's some great actors in this, in the time when some of them were virtual unknowns and the rest were unknowns. These include: Jason London,  Adam Goldberg (Eddie from Friends), Matthew McConaughey (really unrecognisable), Marissa Ribisi (Giovanni's twin, who's also in Friends), Joey Lauren Adams, Ben Affleck and Parker Posey. Apparently, Renee Zellweger also appears in this, in a blink-and-you'll-miss-her-role (I blinked), but she's not listed in the cast list.

62410,3,0783227361,"The 3-star review above reflects my disappointment in this DVD which I haven't bought & have no intentions to. The film, otherwise, is a 4-star pic, for sure.

  There's so much I like about this unaffected film, but very little that hasn't been stated already. Although the ""party"" aspect of this picture is part of its charm, to be sure, what I most appreciate about it is the true character of teen life & 70s period flavor, captured with the help of the most appealing, magical cast this side of American Graffiti, to which this film owes a great deal. Something familiar & real comes through in the backwoods parties, initiation rituals and lost glories that many of us may look back upon with bittersweet remembrance, while other unforutnates - as we see through some characters - never move on, remaining stuck in a perpetual high school fog. But what about those who still have time? For most young people, these are the times that set the template for the future course in life. Will it be one of conformity? Will it be one of lucidity? Will Slater be another Wooderson? For now, the road leads to an Aerosmith concert. Great, but then what?

Not to blow my own horn, but these messages are often overlooked by audience members taken by the spectacle of ""good times"" on the face of the story. But while these are important themes, Dazed & Confused is certainly a very fun, humorous, special movie that should be enjoyed on all these levels (although I would argue that its purpose is not to condone most of the behavior portrayed within). Considering the fanbase its built, this so-called ""special edition"" is an incredible cheat, if not insultingly thin. As it's been mentioned in other reviews, Linklater did in fact plan on doing a commentary. Here's some info from the Nov. 5th edition of Entertainment Weekly:

  ""Dazed fans will be confused about what happened to a promised commentary by director Richard Linklater; paltry extras don't extend much beyond 14 minutes of deleted scenes (with more of Ben Affleck and Parker Posey as senior sadists), a witless new faux anti-pot short put together by the disc's producers, and a Vans ad. In a personal note spread across the Internet since appearing on a blog by actor Wiley Wiggins - who calls this the 'Ultimate Insult Edition' - Linklater laments the studio's 'continuing lameness toward this title...I feel like I'm in an 11-year echo chamber with these idiots.' He tells Wiggins he turned down Universal's commentary request after it spurned his attempts at including a behind-the-scenes doc and 10-year-reunion footage, 'because, after all these years, they're rushing the title out to make some sort of deadline.""

  Linklater and Wiggins, hoping for an eventual Criterion edition, decline to comment further. Universal insists 'we have received positive response' to the DVD's 'substantial bonus features.' Despondend Daze-ees may have a different message for whomever planned this 'Party': Lay off the bong!""

  Kind of surprising treatment after the highly-successful ""School of Rock."" Let's keep our fingers crossed that Criterion will pull through!!",1099958400,10,3123,5.005791505791506

It's a 70s-style ""American Grafitti,"" but without all the profound life lessons of the original as befits a decade more about fun than changing the world.

They also got rid of the trailer and cast/crew bios that were on the first release, which is inexcusable.  Universal went through the trouble of finding the deleted scenes and cleaning up the picture, so why couldn't they get Richard Linklater to do a commentary track or get any sort of featurette that has something to do with the movie?

Most of us who review these movies have no training to do so.
We know what we like and don't like, what we expect in movies,
and we try to communicate our reactions in some graspable
language, either to show off a little or to stimulate someone
to watch or avoid a film.

Like all of the arts, cinema has a history, and an awarenesss of it,
going into a theatre, is critical to a valid evaluation - a review that
has any merit.

I thought that this was a horrid, mean-spirited movie, without
humor, or a point of observation that  I  could appreciate from
any angle, except this one: Sometimes there are kernels of
hope in even the lowest of appearances. Richard Linklater
and some of the actors have done better work since.

There are many far better school movies to watch, including
Linklater's own "" School of Rock. "" And also "" Blackboard
Jungle "", "" Elephant "", "" even "" Real Women Have Curves. ""

The meanness I refer to may have been commonplace in
high schools, and apparently it still is. But the taunting of
underclassmen shown here is supposed to be farcical,
I think, and isn't. A senior chasing a boy to spank him, right
up to his front door, and then shouting, "" Your ass is mine!
You're dead! "", et al, after the kid has scuttled in safely behind
his mother's drawn weapon just sits in the brain like road
rage.

See "" Elephant "" instead. The taunting and bullying that some
students have endured is consequential, if abhorrent. The director
had a conscience. "" Elephant "" is far more than just a reminder
of what it was like to be in high school thrown together with some hot contemporary songs. It's a responsible exercise in film as art,
and not as fast food.",1099353600,10,1741,4.351851851851852

- David Wooderson (Matt McConaughey), May 1976

I was born in 1986, so not only did I not get to experience the '70s, I had to survive crap like Chingy and Nelly and ""sooped-upp rhyz birnurz"" being the dominant pop culture, as opposed to Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd and Chevelles and GTO's. Which is why I love this movie. Next to hearing stories from my parents/uncle, this is as close to the '70s as I'm unfortunately gonna get (unless I'm drivin' a '70s car). It's quite a movie; drugs, booze, rock & roll, and the spirit of '76 rolled up (no pun intended) in one classic comedy!

The movie focuses on the last day of school; May 28, 1976 (one decade and one day before I was born). As one I Love The '90s commentator said, it deals with the high of the last day of school, and the high from smoking all the [narcotics] you can. It follows Randall ""Pink"" Floyd, an okay football player, Slater, the druggie we all knew in high school, O'Bannion, the jerk we all knew in high school, and of course, good old Wooderson, the older guy who hangs out with high school kids (and yes, every high school has guys like these). Wooderson's my favorite character; his lines are the best (see the one above). Not to mention he has the movie's COOLEST car, the 375-hp '70 Chevelle SS, ""Melba Toast"". Yeahhhhh.

Another great aspect of this movie: THE MUSIC! Foghat, Aerosmith, Edgar Winter, Steve Miller, ZZ Top... great '70s rock! They don't make 'em like that anymore.

One day they might make a movie about teenagers in 2004, and I cringe at the thought of it... everybody reminiscing about Lil Jon and little rice burners with huge, tacky spoilers and designs. * shudders * But who cares? As Wooderson says, ""Keep On Livin'"". Although the DVD extras leave much to be desired (but they're releasing a new version soon so be patient), the movie itself kicks. Check it on out.

62447,3,0783227361,"The year was 1976.  Though I was only in Junior High at the time, I knew almost every character in this movie from the popular jock to the stoner.  Our main ambition at the time was indeed to rock and roll all night and party every day--or at the very least, every other day.

This film captures the sights , sounds and feelings of that era with an almost eerie realism.  Its a real blast from the past for anyone who grew up during the 70's, but that's where it ends.  The movie seems to be designed to fill in the spaces between the soundtrack.  It has absolutley no plotline whatsoever.  If you can get past that little point, you could find worse ways to spend two hours.

I liken this movie to a modern day  Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  It is full of nobodies, who later became somebodies.  Mathew McConaghey, Ben Afflek and Mila Jovovich spring to mind (there are many others), and that is one reason to check this flick out.

I'm torn on this review.  I like the movie for a number of reasons but from a technical, or even artistic standpoint, it is not a good movie, nor is it ""the funniest movie ever made"".  Simply stated, it is a piece of nostalgia.

If you have ever encountered an old GI Joe, or some other toy from your youth and have been momentarily transported back to a simpler time, you might just like this one.  If however, you have a low tolerance for terrible acting (Wiley Wiggins is truly awful) and a meandering plot that never really takes you anywhere, you might want to skip this one.",1095379200,6,1515,4.319148936170213

The only thing that I can find fault in is the fact that since it is all studio versions of the songs, some of the tracks seem ""stiff"" or ""hollow"", case in point, Rock and Roll All Nite by KISS, which has seen much better versions produced even in later studio versions.

Another thing is that the selections seem to be reproduced exactly from the master tapes without thought given to re-mastering them for a fuller sound, which again is noticeable in KISS' signature song.

Aside from that, Ted Nugent's ""Stranglehold"" has long been a favorite of mine, and Lyrnyrd Skynyrd's ""Tuesday's Gone"" has a special kind of feel to it, no matter how many times you hear it.

Thrown in for good measure, and for the free-wheeling kind of fun that the film itself reflects, we have Rick Derringer's ""Rock and Roll Hootchie Koo"".

""American Pie"" is hilarious, but it's too bogged down by clichs. ""Dazed and Confused"", however, finds the perfect middle ground. Set in Austin, Texas, on the last day of school in 1976, the film follows a rouges gallery of colorful (if not fun-loving) teenagers who plan to spend the afternoon and night having as much fun as possible, and that's an understatement. The story itself is very simple, yet captivating and intriguing. Each teen spends his/her night doing something different, yet they all eventually convene at the party at the moon tower. It's like a combo of a day-in-the-life movie, an in-depth character study, and a great teen comedy. And it is of course the comedy that more then any thing explores the alienation and unsettling nature that teenagers feel, regardless of age or timeframe. We see this through such lines as: ""I came here tonight to do two things: kick some ass and drink some beer. Looks like we're out of beer!"" and ""If I ever refer to these as the best years of my life remind me to kill myself."" That captures how these kids feel about school, and about life.

62454,4,0783227361,"""Dazed and Confused"" represents one of the better entries in the film genre fans affectionately refer to as the stoner picture. After viewing this movie, I started thinking about this much maligned cinematic rubric. How many films, I wondered, fall within this category? Well, there are the Cheech and Chong movies that emerged in the 1970s, a series of films that really deserve their own special niche. What else? ""The Stoned Age"" came out one year after ""Dazed and Confused"" arrived on the scene. There are probably many more that I could not recall, but the mother of all stoner films has to be the amazing ""Over the Edge,"" a movie notable for showcasing Matt Dillon in his first film roll, but also because of its gritty '70s feel and its wonderful fusion of youthful alienation with suburban sprawl. ""Over the Edge,"" sadly unavailable on DVD as of this date, should serve as the standard by which viewers should measure all other stoner films. In that respect, ""Dazed and Confused,"" while suffering a few problems, does a nice job of keeping the tradition alive.
Set in a small Texas town in the 1970s, ""Dazed and Confused"" follows the various misadventures of a group of high school students on the last day of school, covering a period of mere hours from the end of the school day to the obligatory beer bash held that evening. The cast of characters here is huge, ranging from a small band of junior high students about to become freshman to high school juniors about to become seniors. There's Randall ""Pink"" Floyd (Jason London), the high school football star who is having some doubts about signing a team pledge to refrain from drugs and alcohol during his senior year. Several of his buddies, including Fred O'Bannion (Ben Affleck) and the team coach, give him grief about his hesitancy to give in to this blatant attempt at control. In the meantime, the gang of jocks and their female counterparts take great joy in engaging in the time-honored ritual of hazing the incoming freshman class. This activity involves chasing the hapless kiddies around town in automobiles in order to administer a rather vicious beating with a stout wooden paddle. One of these new freshmen, Mitch Kramer (Wiley Wiggins) attempts to avoid the inevitable until some seniors catch him after one of his baseball games. Floating on the periphery of these scenes is a trio of eggheads (played by Adam Goldberg, Anthony Rapp, and Marissa Ribisi) and an aging stoner, David Wooderson (Matthew McConaughey), who cannot let go of his high school years.
The scenes in ""Dazed and Confused"" unfold in a chaotic manner, perhaps in an effort to mirror the randomness of American youth during the 1970s. A planned party at the house of a kid whose parents are going on vacation comes to naught when a delivery truck attempts to deliver a keg as the shocked adults look on. With this party effectively put on ice, the search is on for a new place to toss back a few cold ones. Most of the kids spend a lot of time driving around town, always on the lookout for some action. After receiving his beating, Mitch Kramer discovers a newfound friendship with Randall Floyd, who invites the diminutive frosh to accompany him on an excursion to the local hangout. Meanwhile, the three brainiacs cruise around town throwing out the most hilarious observations about their future and the state of the country (my favorite line equates Gerald Ford's football injuries with the state of the economy). The kegger contains the things those who went to these atrocities in high school would expect: someone gets in a fight, new relationships form and dissolve, and the stoner archetype goes off on a rant about drugs. The movie ends with no concrete answers about where these kids will go or what the future holds for them.
The movie is notable not for its party hard theme, although that certainly plays a big role here, but for its introspective mood. Director Richard Linklater punches up the film with plenty of humor, such as Affleck's over the top role as the school jerk, but he also shows many of these characters worrying and wondering about the future and what it holds for them. Some of these scenes will break your heart. For example, David Wooderson tells his high school buddies about how the real world is a drag because of its rules and how he just does what he wants no matter what the cost. Everyone knew this guy, and also saw him fail in life. Randall Floyd muses about his high school career, stating that ""if these are the best years of my life, remind me to kill myself."" The last scene of the film, with that open road stretching into the distance--and into the uncertain future, for that matter--really sums up the what this movie is about.
I think the viewer who will understand this movie the best will be the person who went to high school and has been out of that place for a period of years. That way you can appreciate the humorousness of the various characters while understanding the implications of their actions. The people who were not caught up in high school because they understood that four years is only a small part of the grand sweep of life were the ones who generally succeeded after leaving the hallowed halls. ""Dazed and Confused"" makes you realize this fact. Although the film is a little too fractured, resulting in several undeveloped characters, it really is an honest look at a painful time in our lives. I highly recommend it, but prepare yourself for nostalgia pangs and a heavy dose of even more painful '70's atmosphere along the way.",1075593600,80,5554,4.72680412371134

Every Seveties High School party seems to have some part of it represented in this movie. The film does a wonderful job of capturing the atmosphere of the late Seventies! Sometimes a movie that has an incredible cast does not live up to its potential, this movie not only lives up to its potential it surpasses it. Dazed and Confused is clearly a case of a film where the collaboration of its actors exceeds their individual contributions. To put it simply this movie ROCKS !!!

I'm not even into the whole drugs/drinking/partying thing, and I still love this film. Kinda makes me wish I was.
You know what I miss about the 70's? Okay, I was never there in the first place, but anyway, it's the driving around and talking to people in other cars as you pass. That just doesn't happen anymore, you know? At least not in my town. I was driving around in my '85 Dodge Caravan the other day, by myself, with the windows down for a good half hour. I didn't see anyone I knew, man! It was depressing. But then I came home and watched Dazed and Confused, and it lifted my spirits again, taking me back to a time where that kind of stuff happened, and the people were awesome and weren't in such a hurry all the time and could just  kick back and have fun.

That was excellently portrayed by that Freshman guy in the movie.  The music, the clothes, the partying...everything was exactly true to life.  Mr. Linkletter hit a home run with this move.
This is a must for any child of the 70s or anyone wanting to know what it was like!!",1054252800,,518,4.14
62533,5,0783227361,"It is amazing in 2003 to realize that when DAZED AND CONFUSED it was filmed with a cast of unknown actors and actresses.  Although very few of the performers had many parts on their resumes in 1993 when this was made, most of the principals have worked steadily in film since then, and several have become prominent performers, including Joey Lauren Adams, Milla Jovovich, Parker Posey, Ben Affleck, and Matthew McConaughey, while performers like Nicky Katt, Adam Goldberg, Marisa Ribisi, and Rory Cochrane turn up in a host of projects.  As if this were not enough, I have read that Renee Zellweger can be spotted at some point in a nonspeaking part, but I have failed to see her.  That is a lot of talent for a low budget film featuring a group of unknowns.  Even Wiley Wiggins, who winsomely plays Mitch Kramer, one of the new freshmen and who has been in few films since, managed a memorable turn as the real life model for the animated main character in Linklater's superb WAKING LIFE.
All this talent combined with a great script means one of the best films about life in high school ever made.  Like a Greek drama, the entire film takes place in less than 24 hours, beginning on the last day of the school year and the first evening of summer vacation.  Tension is provided by the future seniors harassing the new freshmen in one form or another.  There are also a host of individuals either drifting or attempting to rethink the roles they are playing in their time in high school.  The debt to AMERICAN GRAFITTI is obvious, but Linklater is so deft in his direction that the film never feels derivative, despite the fact that he borrows the device from the Lucas film of having a continuous soundtrack of some of the most recognizable hit tunes from the period.
The greatest thing about this film is the way it takes you back to high school, even if that has been quite a few years.  All the characters remind you of someone you have gone to school with, and so many details seemed to have been drawn from my own set up memories of school.  For instance, at one point Milla Jovovich is strumming a song on the guitar, and stops for a second to light a cigarette, but as the burning lighter gets closer to her face she becomes mesmerized by the flame and slowly moves it back and forth before her face, transfixed on the flame.

Watch it on a summer night, in the dark, with only the dim light of the street lamps sneaking through your window.  It makes it 100 times better.

62539,5,0783227361,"If I am feeling nostalgic for the glory years of high school I have a very simple cure.  Dazed and Confused.  Now I didn't go to high school in the 70's or in Texas, in fact it was the 90's and in Georgia, but it doesn't matter, Dazed and Confused is universal.  Perhaps that is the ultimate truth behind Richard Linklater's gem.  In any case this film serves as a testimate to the fact that while we might get older, high school will always be the same.
So maybe this sounds familiar.  It is the last day of school and everyone from the jocks, to the geeks, to the stoners, to that lone senior that flunked, can't wait for the Summer to begin.  Why?  To party, chase girls, beat up incoming freshmen, get, um, ""enlightened,"" muse about life, go to concerts, tangle in fights, and drink beer, what else?  This is pretty much where we find the amazing young ensemble cast of Dazed and Confused that includes Ben Affleck, Parker Posey, Cole Hauser, Matthew McConaughey, Adam Goldberg, Nicky Katt, Milla Jovovich, and Joey Lauren Adams amongst others.  And they deliver in one classic scene after another.
Undoubtedly if you watch this movie some of these people will remind you of people you knew, another one of the gifts of the film.  In addition to the cast is the soundtrack which is one of the better soundtracks ever essembled for a film.  It seemlessly drives and motivates the action from scene to scene.

As the Amazon review states that the movie asks the question of ""What happens next?"", and we see the kids wonder about they're uncertain futures, and have a fun time doing it.  It's stoner comedy at it's best, one scene in particular is when Slater (Rory Cochrane) is discussing how cool of a lady Martha Washington was and how she took care of George, is laugh out loud hilarious.

62575,4,0783227361,"Instead of reading it as a loving elegy to the bygone days of the mid-1970s, like I think most people do, I read Richard Linklater's ""Dazed and Confused"" as a condemnation, not of the era per se, but of the generation that survived it.  And by extension, every generation's high schoolers.  Let me explain.
Linklater is making fun of his characters.  Of this I have no doubt.  Witness how everyone speaks in stilted, unfinished sentences.  This is a function of either their excessive pot smoking (""Dazed"") or their inherent ignorance (""Confused"").  Either way, it doesn't look good.  I mean, can you imagine more purposefully disjointed and jumbled opening lines to a movie than the following?:
SIMONE:  I'm heading this way.
PINK:  Oh.  Later.
SIMONE:  So what have we decided?
PINK:  About what?
SIMONE:  About tonight.
PINK:  Oh, er. Look, I'll probably get, you know, hung up with the guys, maybe, you know, later. Why don't we just you know, meet at the party?
SIMONE:  Okay
They're hardly ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times"" or ""Call me Ishmael"".  But, they do set the stage for the aimlessness to follow.  Perfectly.  Couple this intentional idiocy with a preoccupation with the acquisition of beer and pot and a place to consume said beer and pot, and the most intense yet apathetic hazing rituals ever put on film, and you've got high school nihilism drawn out in all its colours (those colours being nothing more than black and white).
But my best argument for this point is the soundtrack.  Supposedly compiled as a loving tribute to seventies music, it comes across more as a criticism of the milquetoast tastes of those in control of the stereo.  Every song is bigger and dumber than the last, beginning with Aerosmith's ""Sweet Emotion"", traipsing through Peter Frampton's ""Do You Feel Like We Do"", wallowing in the muck of a couple of Alice Cooper numbers, before landing squarely on the Edgar Winter Group's ""Free Ride"".  These are all fun tunes (I admit to a certain soft spot in my heart for the beautiful guitar work in Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Tuesday's Gone"").  But these are high school kids listening to them, not their twenty-years-down-the-road-nostalgic-baby-boomer counterparts.  Shouldn't their music be more dangerous and defiant?  If the soundtrack to the revolution contains Kiss' ""Rock and Roll All Nite"", then we're all doomed.
The biggest offense is in the way the kids use Bob Dylan's ""Hurricane"".  A song about one man's struggle to free himself from jail -- incarcerated almost two decades for a crime he didn't commit -- scores a scene at an arcade hangout, where the goals are to drink a lot of beer, and kick butt at the foosball and pool tables.  Linklater is laughing at the obliviousness, the ridiculousness, of these people.
To further this notion, Linklater has cast atypically wooden actors.  In an average movie of this kind (enormous ensemble cast of teenage and twentysomething actors), you'd expect many breakout stars, and many careers to be made.  Unfortunately this hasn't happened.  Sure, Matthew McConaughey is now a household name, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a bigger star than Ben Affleck, but the rest of the cast has disappeared mostly without a trace.  Jason London, who does a passable job as star quarterback and all around good guy Randall ""Pink"" Floyd (even his name is obvious!), followed up ""Dazed and Confused"" with a series of small roles in movies no one saw.  Wiley Wiggins, as an incoming freshman taken under the wing of the seniors, is very good at showing the awkwardness and potential of his character.  A scene where he buys beer, mimicking the drunken mumblings he'd heard not moments before, is played straight but manages to be very funny.  But until his starring role in Linklater's ""Waking Life"", where had this boy gone?  Rory Cochrane, who plays a stoner named Slater, carries a lot of comic weight and is the most often quoted character in the cast.  He pulls off both aspects.  But does Slater make a deeper impression than, say Sean Penn's Jeff Spicoli or Bill & Ted?  Not really.  Slater's supposedly wise spaced-out ramblings are specious at best.  Parker Posey, as a queen-bitch, and Adam Goldberg and Anthony Rapp, as the film's Greek Chorus, are all fine, if underwhelming.
The rest of the cast is uniformly awful.  Affleck, as a bullying buffoon, Shawn Andrews, Milla Jovovich, Sasha Jensen, Jason O. Smith, Cole Hauser... I could go on.  They're all pretty bad.  Unbelievable and boring.
If anything, ""Dazed and Confused"" is an opportunity to laugh at the people on screen, and in turn at yourself.  We were all once this young and dumb and aimless, weren't we?  So laugh at the stupid hair, the ridiculous clothes (I love the way Linklater dresses up his football coaches in skin tight shirts, Daisy Duke-like shorts, and knee-high tube socks), the faux-philosophy, the nihilism, the crudity, and the buffoonery.  Linklater doesn't want you to look back nostalgically on these days.  As he has Pink say near the end, ""If I ever start referring to these as the best years of my life, remind me to kill myself.""",1018396800,2,5121,4.868208092485549

Yes, episodicaly following the social rites of different cliques of teenagers, during a 24 hour period had already been done in George Lucas's classic film, ""American Graffiti"". Richard Linklater more then matches Lucas with probably one of the best films ever made about being a teenager during that nostalgic age that we called the 70's. Linklater's script gives us a realistic, yet very funny portrait of a night in the life of these kids. Also,like Lucas's classic, ""Dazed & Confused"" features a shining young ensemble of actors at the begining of their careers including Matthew McConaughey, Ben Affleck, Parker Posey, Joey Laurence Adams and Adam Goldberg. The film also features a killer soundtract of '70s rock and pop tunes that feature such favorites as Aerosmith, Alice Cooper, Peter Frampton, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Foghat, Deep Purple etc. For a great nostalgic '70s trip, I highly recomend this movie!",998611200,16,1204,5.116751269035533

I've dreamt since i saw back in 1996 to have that party. Or at not the least that life. though the more restricted laws in sweden keeps me away from it. But enough about swe. The movie has great characters and the right suiteable actors for'em. It's really sad to not almost ever seen those actors again. I've seen only 7 of those actors in anything else! Jason London, Joey Lauren Adams, Rory Cochrane, Adam Goldberg, Anthony Rapp, Milla Jovovich, Parker Posey & Matthew McConaughey. And still so many talents gone. But maby its just me and sweden.

62634,4,0783227361,"To say ""Dazed and Confused"" was a trend-setting film would be, for the most part, accurate. This 1993 comedy/drama inspired the television series ""That 70s Show,"" and such films as ""54,"" ""Go,"" and ""Sunset Strip."" In addition, it spawned the careers of such soon-to-be stars as Matthew McConaughey, Ben Affleck, Parker Posey and Milla Jovovich. But the true joy of ""Dazed and Confused"" is its lovingly detailed recreation of high school life circa 1976.
Owing a respectful nod to George Lucas' ""American Graffiti,"" another nostalgic cruise down the confusing yet crucial roads of youth, director/screenwriter Richard Linklater has given the generation known as X its own celluloid high school annual to cheer and embrace. What sets ""Dazed and Confused"" apart from similar teenage comedies is the respect Linklater shows for each character -- from the geeks and freaks to the jocks and cheerleaders. His parade of multi-dimensional individuals is a colorful hodgepodge of friends we all had in high school. These kids, for the most part us (if you grew up in the 70s), are likeable, identifiable and at times haunting.
The conflicts these souls must go through, from trying to find a place for a beer keg party to deciding rather or not to succumb to the authority of a dictator-like football coach, are the realistic choices faced by most teenagers no matter the year or American locale. These Linklater teens are not necessarily obsessed with sex, drugs and rock-n-roll, though all three are prominent factors in this film, their obsessions are with the future and their place in the world created for them.
The backdrop of this immensely enjoyable chaos is the last day of high school in a town somewhere in Texas (the movie was filmed in Austin), where teenagers cruise the city strip listening to the music of Aerosmith, Ted Nugent, Black Sabbath, Foghat and Kiss. In the span of one night, geeks find romance, jocks find humility and children become young adults.
Perhaps the greatest success of ""Dazed and Confused"" is that it serves as a respectful document to American teenage life. Look closely through the haze of marijuana smoke, bell bottoms and puka shells, and you will see a universal mirror into a youthful past.
The performances, almost too many to mention, are uniformly terrific, with exceptional nods to McConaughey, Posey, Rory Cochrane and Wiley Wiggins. Quite simply, ""Dazed and Confused"" was one of the most underrated and memorable films of 1993.",990835200,2,2470,5.056372549019608
62635,5,0783227361,"OK, I'm a teacher and I can definitely appreciate anything that has to do with the last day of school!  I love this show!  All the stuff you used to say and do when you were a kid.  It's got a great soundtrack too!",990057600,,214,3.8181818181818183
62636,4,0783227361,"This film's massive cult following has led to the recent rise in marijuana use among teens in the small town I hail from. The film does depict a nostalgic, care and consequence free look on an era of casual drug use. As a high school teacher, I have heard more than one of this film's many fans say ""I wish I could go back to that year, it must have been a more innocent time."" My jaded side would absolutely relish Linkletter making a sequel to this fine film and re-examining characters thirty years or so later as they confront the ultimate consequences of their choices and maybe even meet their offpring behaving the way they did. These characters, like most teenagers (I certainly remember my years) are all pretty much hedonistic, self centered and consumer driven individuals. I really would love to see what happened to them as they matured and became producers (if ever). Would their lives mirror mine (and Lester Birnham's ?).
Anyway, that weak attempt at moralizing aside, Dazed and Confused is a great movie that focuses on character, situation, and setting as opposed to any real plot. There is no great conflict and therefore no real resolution and questions asked in the narrative. In fact, because he (unlike me, the viewer) refuses to judge his characters, Director Richard Linkletter allows them to truly live in the unnamed Texas Town of 1976.
Like his earlier film ""Slacker"", Linkletter simply allows the film to evolve without any imposistions of classic storytelling structure. He wants his characters to tell their stories on their own terms. Scenes happen as opposed to beginning and ending in a set pattern. His camera is so completely neutral and manages, by avoiding the whiplash editing beloved by so many of his peers in favor of long, loopy and dreamy takes, to become close to a documentary. He, through his camera honestly creates honest and personal spaces.
Scenes are funny not because of snappy, slogan filled one liners like so many other teen flicks are, but rather due to clear clean truthfull situations that the characters can honestly respond to: moments sketched exactly out fo the hormone driven evolutionary soup that is high school.
The film is also extremely economical and tasteful. There really isn't a wasted scene. Linkletter also refuses to bow to current trends by not tacking on any extraneous nude scenes or explicit sex. Such and inclusion would be ultimately exploitive - a quality this film avoids.
The film begins en media res and ends much the same way. The performances and writing in the film are seemless and natural in their execution. Many may be turned off by the super natural delivery as it opposes any sort of dramatic tension. These young anctor inhabit their characters completely without a false not struck. The body language and coded linguistics of teenage life is dead on.
The young cast is made up of many folks who have gone on to do great things. Watch the fine performances of Nicky Katt, Anthony Rapp and Adam Goldberg in addition to the more famous debuts.
Granted not everyone in 76 or now uses drugs and/or drinks to the extent idealized in the movie(it is interesting that we don't see anyone puking or wrecking their muscle cars-again that would be moralizing, explotive. etc.), but yet the costumes and the behavior are dead on.  I especially love the dorky tight shorts and pulled up socks of the super macho football coaches.
What more could be said too of the excellent soundtrack? The DVD sparkles visually and aurally. I just would have liked some extra commentary.
Linkletter captures perfectly the fears, hopes and overall attitudes of teen life better than John Hughes could ever have hoped to. With the exception of Cameron Crowe's superb ""Say Anything"" this is the greatest teen film ever made. It also stands up to the many, many repeated viewings I have enjoyed.",988675200,6,3860,4.857359635811836
62637,5,0783227361,"Dazed & Confused takes place on all on the last day of high school in a small Texas town.  The year is 1976 and the town has a bizarre tradition of the seniors-to-be hazing the freshmen-to-be.  The film has no real plot.  We just follow the kids from school, to the hazing, to the local arcade to a party.  They don't care about much except for getting high and having fun.  The fact it has no plot sounds like a detriment, but it is the real beauty of the film.  We just follow the kids around during the day and get to hear their musings.  The movie is quite funny, but not in a slapstick manner.  The humor is subtle and the writing is razor sharp.  The film is also notable as many of the cast have gone on to bigger things.  Ben Affleck, Matthew McConaughy, Adam Goldberg, Milla Jovanavich & Parker Posey all appear as do actors like Jason London, Rory Gallagher, Cole Hauser & Michelle Burke who you may not know by name but will recognize by face.  But singling out those actors does not do the other lesser knowns like Wiley Wiggins, Sasha Jensen, Anthony Rapp and the rest of the cast who are all great.  The movie is chock full of 70's rock classics and the clothes, cars, hair and settings are quite authentic.

Whatever company put out this DVD (Gramercy I think) didn't go to the original print for the letterbox.  They just took the pan & scan version and chopped the top and bottom off!  This is for real!  I compared it with my full screen VHS version!  Then I checked my other DVDs and found that they did the same thing with Reservoir Dogs. This is totally unacceptable and I'm working on getting in touch with the jerks over there to make sure this stops.  Who's with me? It's bad enough that they have to steal 80% of the movie to begin with by making it ""fit your TV"" but then they have to take another 80% to make it look similar to the orginal?  I don't think so.

62640,4,0783227361,"Part of the problem, I believe, is that the movie captured the attitudes of the time so accurately that those with short memories or who were too young to have lived it can't possibly believe that that's the way things were for a period in the 70s.  Our big brothers and sisters had fought the revolution of the 60s, and won us the right to get high every day after school and sit in the park and talk about nothing at all.  Naturally, our more motivated little brothers and sisters of the 80s rebelled against our sloth.  That's simply evolution.  Dazed and Confused should really be packaged with ""Breaking Away"" as companion pieces for that particular time and place in American History.

62676,5,0783227361,"Of course, for the been there done that drugs and alcohol crowd the film rocks, but beyond that it's truly an outstanding film -- something that  we've lost since the era when Hollywood could be counted on to put out  strong products. Interestingly, the film to which I see many compare this  -- and to which it's definitely comparable -- is ""American  Graffiti,"" a film which came out during that era. What I love about  the film is that, like the Lucas film, it doesn't place any characters  above the others, it memorably recreates an era, and Linklater is able to  garner strong performances from all of his characters -- similar to,  believe it or not, the best Altman work and, by 90's extension, Paul Thomas  Anderson of ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia"" fame.
Like  the best film work, this movie also does contain, contrary to what many  seem to notice, issues of significance. It shows a time when people are  definitely ""Dazed and Confused"" and searching for an identity,  and the ability to make sense of the world and issues around us, regardless  of how far we may become removed from the concerns of our youth as time and  different responsibilities encroach on our thinking -- and by extension,  our ability to truly think. If you don't believe me, think of Wooderson  (the only post high school character who has a legitimate connection with  the others) and this paraphrased quote: And the older you get, the more  sh*t you're going to have to deal with. Pink having to sign his pledge is  only a prelude to the adult world; for as us older reviewers know, the  Coach Conrads are only too common in the world. Finally, keeping in line  with the pedantic nature of this review, my favorite part of the film is  the final shot: For the first time in the film we have an overhead shot of  the action -- we've been on an equal footing with the characters the whole  time, seeing them from eye level, but now we can look down and show that we  know what Linklater knows, the ride's uphill the rest of the way and as  much as we think we may be ready or prepared we don't know what's on the  other side. Look out the windshield shot and you'll see it's uphill: what  was once life in the fast lane becomes a slow ride.",968025600,6,2227,4.456575682382134

All the characters are amazingly  scripted, especially Ben Affleck as the villain of the movie, the character  Slater perfectly depicts the stereotypical high-school pot head, with way  too much knowledge about drug paraphanelia to be healthy.

Linkletter could so easily  have turned this film into a farce, a big blatent parody of the Seventies  that would have been humorous, perhaps, but with a bad taste in the mouth.  Instead, his direction is gentle and unassuming, and we're allowed the  experience of traveling back into time, when pot was everywhere, parents  were tolerated, and the village idiot running the corner grocery believed  that everyone was old enough to buy beer.  It's a pleasure to see Mitch  follow in Pink's footsteps, while wondering uneasily if Pink is going to  follow in Wooderson's footsteps.  It's even fun to hear everyone, girls and  guys alike, overuse the word ""man"", because that's just what we  all did.

This is one of those movies  that captures exactally how I perceive the mid 70's to be.  This film is  about, well, graduation night and future freshmen and seniors.  They  basically go around smoking weed and trying to terrorize the up coming  freshman.  The line up is an all star cast of who's who in movies.  Ben  Afleck, Mathew Mcconaughey, Jason London and Milla Jovovich.

The girls who  were into cool music didn't purposely make themselves look scary, the bands  you listened to actually relied on musical talent to reach their status,  not how they looked on MTV.  Oh yeah, and EVERYONE got high.
The movie  and the situations it displays are pretty much timeless:  high schoolers  pulling pranks, defying authority, and searching endlessly for something to  do.

I watch it  sometimes to remember that period of time, which, compared to the  ultra-post-modern times we live in (including the very means by which we  are communicating right now) seems so innocent and full of hope.

Seriously, there are scenes in here that I can think of no other reason for their being included, beyond showing a good side to ""bad guys"" or showing a bad side to ""good guys"".  This is very unusual in Hollywood, of course, and is probably a healthy, or at least thoughtful, approach.
Beyond that, watch for all the up-and-comers in here.  Ben Affleck, Jason London, Joey Lauren Adams, and many others.  Oh, that reminds me. Watch Joey Lauran Adams' character, ""Simone"".  She has the most lethal glances at her casual boyfriend, Jason London (""Floyd"", the quarterback) when she walks past him and sees him with other girls.  You have to be on the lookout for the times they walk past each other, but it is so worth it.  The ""smart kids"" have a few really good moments, which somehow I hadn't expected in a party movie...

Dazed and Confused is a great film, with some of the most memorable qoutes ever.  For once, a film that  doesn't make being a teenager some emotionally signifigant moment.  Nobody  finds direction and meaning, they just go and get drunk and stoned.  The  characters are excellent, and the dialogue classic.  It takes you back to  the 70's, with it's cars, music and clothes.  Even if you weren't around  then, this film still has the effect of putting you there.

62769,5,0783227361,"I am fed up with people saying that nothing happens in this film.  To say this is to miss the point entirely. This is a film made in documentary style, a style which gives maximum credibility to the wide and varied  selection of characters.  We are seeing them in their natural environment,  be it the pool hall, the beer bust, or indeed within the confines of the  school walls.
I defy anybody to watch this film and not be reminded  along the way of one or two, if not several, of the people from their  year-group in school.  They are all there: the sporty ones, the ones who  did drugs, the ones who were good at sport and did drugs, and of course the  nerds.  What I love is that none of these groups is portrayed by way of  charicature; they all have complexities which are evident in every  scene.
The result of these complexities is that some of my favourite  characters are the ones who might be considered minor.  Melvin (the black  guy) and Hirschfelder (Mitch's chubby friend) are two perfect examples.  And there is of course Wooderson, the epitome of Texas cool!
I disagree  that nothing happens in this film; however, the fact that plot for once  takes a back seat means that these wonderful characters are given the  freedom they deserve to show their worth.

The music is outstanding and I highly recommend buying the first soundtrack -- if not the second one, too.  This film takes a pretty  realistic look at life as a worthless teenager.  Though some may slam it as  a movie that doesn't have a point, I think there is a theme that can be  summed up rather easily: although it's a lot of fun to be a careless  teenager, people naturally want direction in their lives, even if that  direction means going against what others might want for us (this is best  demonstated in ""Pink's"" unwillingness to sign the football team's  petition to not drink, do drugs, etc.).  The movie's ending -- an open road  from the perspective of the people sitting in the front seat of a car -- is  a wonderful way to conclude the message of this film: the open road of life  is right before us, and it is our jobs to make sure ours is a fullfilled  journey.",951782400,,965,4.283333333333333

62806,5,0783227361,"This is the best film about high school ever made. It is also a great film about America. Linkletter has a perfect-pitch ear for dialogue and a keen understanding of the nuances of high school politics. It's an odd film.  Only the weakest narrative is supplied, and little of real moment happens.  This proves to be one of its strengths, as it allows Linkletter to focus on  his characters. With deft understatement, he renders dead-on depictions of  American high schoolers. It's a thoroughly enjoyable film, but it's more an  experience than a story. And it's an experience you'll want to have again  and again. I've seen it at least ten times and have yet to grow the least  bit tired of it.
Dazed and Confused was pitched as a zany high school  hijinx flick/70s nostalgia trip. That's not a completely inaccurate  description: it *is* a hilarious film and, because its portrait of 70s teen  life is so studied and honest, it's like bottled nostalgia (well, at least  for those of us who were children of the 70s).

62810,5,0783227361,"Much more than an ""American Graffiti"" for the '70's, because the characters and scenarios in ""Dazed and Confused"" are less contrived, and more of an actual ""slice of life.""  I graduated  from a suburban San Francisco Bay Area HS in '72, so my experiences were  just a bit different, but everything rings true, and the depiction of time,  place, and character are dead accurate.
Besides that, ""Dazed and  Confused"" is an extremely well-crafted piece of filmmaking, satirical,  funny, with stand-out performances by all.  The opening sequence, utilizing  Aerosmith's ""Sweet Emotion"" to great effect, draws you right into  the film completely, and keeps you there until the closing credits finish  rolling.  This is definitely a good time movie, whether you get dazed and  confused yourself or not.

The hairstyles and clothes were  a total hoot.  But mostly, when I was actually living in those times, I  remember feeling the same way many of the characters in the movie feel --  when will real life start?

Both movies used a stellar cast of young actors and both went to a lot of  trouble to get all the details of the particular time period right.  When  you see a movie like this you realize how all the mega-budget special  effects often get in the way of the typical Hollywood movie.  The  advertising that accompanied the movie made it seem like it was just a  stoner flick, but it's a lot more than that.
