2555400,4,B000F9UEES,"Well explained. It's just a pity that there is no information on tactics for mulihulls though some of the information can be applied to multihulls, it is unfortunately not tested by the Pardeys in storm conditions. They are extremely competent sailors and any advice given by them is certainly well researched and tested. A remarkable humble couple that put things into perspective without any heroics or fanfare.",1218672000,,413,5.17910447761194
2555401,5,B000F9UEES,Clearly and concisely presented information for anyone who is seriously considering venturing offshore. The Pardeys describe and demonstrate their proven techniques for safe control of a vessel in the worst conditions. No cruisers libarary should be with out this for first tiem and repeat viewing!!!,1192924800,,300,5.688888888888889
2555402,4,B000F9UEES,Important knowledge for any sailor. Only wish is that there had been more storm footage.,1191369600,,88,4.933333333333334
2555403,5,B000F9UEES,"As a new sailor, I've watched a few videos and I  believe that Lin and Larry's techniques and recommendations are at the top of the video list!  A must for your library. I would have liked to see a bit more sailing video, but imagine that Lin and Larry have their hands full sailing during a storm. That said...excellent value. I plan to purchase their other videos as well.",1190505600,,374,4.405797101449275
2555404,4,B000F9UEES,"The production is very well done, they explain very clear. But frankly, I was expecting a bit more. I understand that it is not easy to film ""on the spot"" with ""real"" bad weather, but it all seemed ""too perfect"". Another flaw, is that they only show the storm tactic that they like most. That is, ""to heave to""",1168300800,3,310,4.271186440677966

8119300,5,B000F9UEES,"I have read many books on sailing heavy weather  and many many chapters in sailing books on the subject. Larry has provided a really good book on how to survive the storm and debunked those who have dismissed his methods as too technical or difficult. I believed those doubters until I read this book for myself. If you are going to sea, READ THIS BOOK!",1453593600,,353,4.430769230769231

8119303,5,B000F9UEES,Really? you'll going to go out there without knowing what you could face? Dont think about it. Buy it. My family worth every effort of safety education I can get.,1437696000,,162,4.433333333333334

8119307,5,B000F9UEES,"""Storm Tactics"" DVD (along with the companion handbook) are the quintessential works for learning and applying the techniques necessary to survive--and to survive undamaged--major storms encountered at sea. Whether you are on a 4-hour sail (a la Gilligan's Island) or crossing oceans, the weather can and will change. Lin and Larry Pardey are veterans of offshore sailing, having built and sailed their two boats, Seraffyn and Taleisin, over 150,000 miles in virtually every weather condition you will ever encounter.

Not only do they cover techniques such as heaving-to, the correct deployment and use of para-anchors, and the choice and use of storm sails (tri-sails, staysails), they also detail the best methods of testing and perfecting your equipment ahead of time so that you will be confident and ready for any condition you encounter. You will feel better about casting off for adventure armed with the knowledge and skills they teach--and so will your crew.

I cannot recommend anything more highly than the Pardey's ""Storm Tactics"" DVD and newly updated ""Storm Tactics Handbook."" Don't leave home without having prepared properly; and if you have not studied and applied their universal (for monohull sailing craft) techniques well ahead of your departure then you really are not fully prepared. It will be the best money you will ever have spent on sailing.",1246320000,,1370,5.251141552511416
