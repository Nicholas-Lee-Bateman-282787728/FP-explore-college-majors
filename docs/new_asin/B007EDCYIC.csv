Basically nothing about Eminem and just a bunch of British rappers trying to promote themselves. There was at least 3 music videos on here  by other rappers!. waste of money!!!",1354492800,,329,4.875
8525425,1,B007EDCYIC,Was crap I thought I was getting an eminem DVD but its just a bunch of nobody's talking about him was hugely let down,1353456000,,117,3.9166666666666665
8525426,1,B007EDCYIC,This movie was horrible there was nothing really on here about eminem i thought that this was a real documentery but it is not. this was a waste of a half hour. all the guys in this film talked about how he inspired them. there was 1 or 2 songs that i did like but the rest was crap i'd rather watch barney than this shit. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you don't,1349481600,2,381,3.8974358974358974

8525428,1,B007EDCYIC,"WOW! Unbelievably bad! I'm just glad I got this for free.

Pros:
There is NONE!

Cons:
-No Eminem whatsoever. No music, no videos, no interviews......absolutely nothing! Not even a single person who is affiliated with Eminem is featured.
-It's all British wannabe rapper's (all of which whom you will never ever hear from again) talking about how much they're on Eminem's jock.

Note to British Rappers: STOP TRYING TO IMITATE US, AND FURTHERMORE STOP TRYING TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF US! IT DOES NOT, NOR WILL IT EVER WORK! YOU GUYS CANNOT RAP, PERIOD! YOUR VOICE AND DELIVERY ARE GARBAGE!",1336867200,10,585,4.83
