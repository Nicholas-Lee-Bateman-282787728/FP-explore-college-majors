8580666,1,B00CDX0J3A,Talk about a B- rated movie.  This movie was simply a horrible bore. I've  heard better dialog between two 4 year olds. Don't  waste your time on this one unless you have a quick fast forward button.,1523750400,,199,4.324324324324325
8580667,5,B00CDX0J3A,"This is not an easy movie to watch but it is an important one to absorb. There is a foreboding from the get go with some complicated characters in this town that could represent so many towns across the U.S.A. The character back stories evolve centering on the echoes of PTSD, bullying, gender identification and gender misdiagnosis. There is also a budding love story which gets crushed and annihilated. There is violence which speaks its own truth. It is worth the watch with its artistic and brutal honesty around so many untouchable topics.",1476230400,,544,4.860215053763441
8580668,1,B00CDX0J3A,I watched maybe 5 minutes of this. I want my rental fee back. Horrible!,1471824000,,71,4.142857142857143
8580669,1,B00CDX0J3A,"I have never written a movie review but this movie is SO bad I am taking the plunge. From my perspective it has nothing of worth.  A bad script, poor acting and poor directing.  There is a lack of everything that makes a movie good.  At times, the background music is louder than the dialog.",1470009600,,291,4.254545454545455
8580670,2,B00CDX0J3A,"I have seen worse, but just barely. I keep hoping that someone would start acting. Didn't happen.",1440633600,,97,4.764705882352941
8580671,5,B00CDX0J3A,I love the cinematography and the dramatic story line. All the acting is believable and it leaves you wanting more.,1372982400,,115,4.8
